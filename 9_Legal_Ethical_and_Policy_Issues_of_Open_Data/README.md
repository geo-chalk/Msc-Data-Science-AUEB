# Legal, ethical and Policy Issues of Open Data (Y2Q1)
Data Science is growing rapidly being nowadays a key tool for an increasing number of 
aspects of social and economic life, influencing the ways in which we create, we produce 
or even the way we live. The legal and ethical issues that data science faces have such 
a variety and depth that their investigation, in the framework of a course, cannot be 
but indicative of the emerging issues in the field. Similarly, it may only touch upon 
the tools, institutional, technical, economic and legal that we have at our disposal 
in order to address such issues. Hence, this course has as its primary objective to 
devise a methodology for identifying, analyzing and resolving legal and ethical issues 
that relate to data science, rather than providing a specific solution.
