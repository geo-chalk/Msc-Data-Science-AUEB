# Deep Learning (Y2Q2)

Deep Learning has gained significant attention over the past few years leading to state-of-the-art methods for several
tasks concerning text and image processing (e.g., machine translation, object recognition in images, etc.). The course
will be a mix of theory and practice, covering the basic deep learning theory and providing examples of how to build
deep neural networks in practice with popular Python tools, e.g., Keras, PyTorch, etc.

## Professor: Prodromos Malakasiotis

## Dependencies
It is suggested to use a could platform (either Kaggle or Google Colab) to run the notebooks.
All dependencies will be installed by the notebooks.

If you wish to run the notebooks locally, you should create a conda environment with python3 and jupyter.
The notebook will take case of all dependecies.
```
python>=3.8
jupyter
```

## Weights and Biases
[Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/) was used to track the experiments and log the models in both projects.
WANDB offers a free account for academic purposes. 
In case you don't have access to a WANDB account, you can edit the corresponding cells in the notebooks
and skip the logging part.
