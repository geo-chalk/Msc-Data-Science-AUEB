## Project 1


Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/1-5-million-beer-reviews-from-beer-advocate

* Find a rating-based or matching-based (binary) dataset that can be used to inform a recsys based on collaborative filtering.

* Email me your dataset of choice to confirm before working on your recsys.

* Build a Python Notebook that:

(1) Loads the dataset

(2) Tries at least 2 different recommendation methods based on collaborative filtering (Tensorflow, Matrix factorization, Count-based)

(3) Uses quantitative metrics to evaluate the recommendations of each of the two methods that you selected.
