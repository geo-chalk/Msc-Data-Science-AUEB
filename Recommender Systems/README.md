## Projects


### Project 1
* Find a rating-based or matching-based (binary) dataset that can be used to inform a recsys based on collaborative filtering.

* Build a Python Notebook that:

(1) Loads the dataset

(2) Tries at least 2 different recommendation methods based on collaborative filtering 
(Tensorflow, Matrix factorization, Count-based)

(3) Uses quantitative metrics to evaluate the recommendations of each of the two methods that you selected.

The dataset was [downloaded from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/1-5-million-beer-reviews-from-beer-advocate) and contains 1.5m beer reviews from beer advocate.

### Project 2

* Find a dataset that can be used to inform a content-based recommender systems.

* Build a Python Notebook that:

(1) Loads the dataset <br>
(2) Creates a content-based recommender system. <br>
(3) Uses quantitative metrics to evaluate the recommendations of the system.

The dataset was [downloaded from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/1-5-million-beer-reviews-from-beer-advocate) and contains 1.5m beer reviews from beer advocate.
Additional scraping was done through the notebook.
