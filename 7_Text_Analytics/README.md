# Numerical Optimization and Large Scale Linear Algebra (Y1Q2)
The course is concerned with algorithms, models, and systems that can be used to process and 
extract information from natural language text. Text analytics methods are used, for example, 
in sentiment analysis and opinion mining, information extraction from documents, search engines 
and question answering systems. They are particularly important in corporate information systems, 
where knowledge is often expressed in natural language (e.g., minutes, reports, regulations, 
contracts, product descriptions, manuals, patents). Companies also interact with their customers 
mostly in natural language (e.g., via e-mail, call centers, web pages describing products, blogs 
and social media).
