# Data visualization and communication (Y2Q1)
Communicating clearly and effectively about the patterns we find in data is a key skill for a successful data
scientist. Visualizations are graphical depictions that can improve comprehension. 
Collaborative filtering Visualizations will be paired with verbal analyses and reporting. 
Different tools will be used to transform data and create visualizations, including Python, Google Charts, 
Tableau, and Spotfire. Assignments will give students experience with reporting on complex patterns and 
results with graphics and prose.
