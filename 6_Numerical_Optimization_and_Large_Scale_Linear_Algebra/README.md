# Numerical Optimization and Large Scale Linear Algebra (Y1Q2)
Numerical linear algebra is of great practical importance in scientific computation and 
is used in mathematics, natural sciences, computer science and social science. 
Even nonlinear problems usually involve linear algebra in their solution. 
This high level course provides in-depth knowledge of matrix computations. 
Learn the numerical solutions of systems of linear equations including direct methods, 
error analysis, structured matrices as well as iterative methods and least squares. 
Explore applications in industry including direct implications for Internet applications. 
In addition, one of the important objectives of this course is to use computers for 
solving scientific problems. Assignments can be done in PYTHON and specifically 
using SCI-PY.
