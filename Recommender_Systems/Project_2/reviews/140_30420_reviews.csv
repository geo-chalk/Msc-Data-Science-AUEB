140,30420,whitro17,4.4,"16 oz. can - 2 for $4 - canned on 1/16/2023 Look - deep amber, creamy head, good lacing left behind Smell - pine, floral, spice Taste - caramel malt, spice, citrus, hoppy resin Feel - medium body, medium carbonation, hoppy resin and sticky finish Overall - One word, classic. It's been a while since I had a Torpedo but this was the best available option at a convenience store a few weeks ago. Can't tell you how happy I am this happened as it made me remember why this brew was my favorite go to for quite a long time. It's easy to overlook with so many other options available but this baby still delivers. Fantastic flavor profile of caramel malt, citrus notes and that sappy hop bitter lingering aftertaste. It's delicious! And back in my rotation too. I suggest a pairing with Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple as they share the hallmark of greatness. Both are iconic and of course, classic. Enjoy!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JesMartinez,4.22,"Hazy light orange color. Rocky one finger head. Intense smell of orange, flowers, and light mildew. Foamy light and pleasant carbonation and medium body, medium high bitterness. Huge hop bomb! More hop flavor than any other west coast IPA. Strong citrus taste and powdery coating of resin.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,robed,4.54,This tastes like pine and pineapples to me. Love the taste. Perhaps not as complex as other IPAs out there but for the price it is tough to find better than this,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ReverendSoup,3.84,"Amber in color. Off-white 2-finger head. Nice ring and scattered dense lacing. Wonderful hop aroma, as advertised. Smells a little pineappley. Citrusy with a lingering bitterness. Fuller bodied than anticipated, but respectably so. Solid carbonation. It's a great beer. Maybe I've been having too many good imperials lately, that this doesn't stand out to me much. That said, it's tasty (if simple) and accessible, so I can see this being someone's ol' reliable, go-to IIPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,besottedfool,4.84,"Zippy, mega hoppy, yet so complex and satisfying! It's a little intense, so I'd switch over to something light and refreshing during a session. Torpedo IPA pushes all of my go buttons!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,sawhite245,3.17,Strong IPA hoppy flavors. This beer is bitter and leaves a lingering taste. Reminds me of the smell of my kitchen when when adding hops to a home brew. Bitter but not citrus. Can only stomach one.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,alexaedita,4.31,"It's hard not to give top rating to this beer. It's a very solid beer. Thing is, there are a lot of beers that are equally good brews and even slightly better. 15-20 years ago, these guys were untouchable. Well, most of Sierra Nevada was. The competition build up in the past 15-20 years changed that spectrum. But it is still an excellent presentation of style, nonetheless.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,artsybrewdude,4.3,"Just a solid beer. One of the first IPAs I ever had and it still holds down the fort to this day. A bit maltier than some of the IPAs I would go for today, but still has a good hop balance. Tis a classic what else can I say, will always have a special place in my heart.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JesseJames81,4.1,"Appearance: Pours a beautiful clear amber color with a medium white foam head. Has decent retention and leaves behind some really sticky lacing.  Aroma: Mellow blend of citrus fruits and malted grains. A lot of malt in the backbone.  Taste: A blend of citrus and pine up front, barley malt in the middle, and a bitter fruit peel(ish) hop bite that lingers in the finish.  Overall: This is a good beer. It's not over complicating anything. It's simple but incredibly well balanced. I can see this becoming a go-to.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Luscious_Malfoy,4.34,"poured from a 12oz bottle into a CW snifter. pours kind of an amber color with almost three fingers of firm white foam. big malt and hop presence on the nose. resinous and citrusy hops mostly. more citrus and pine on the taste with a malty finish. thick, full mouthfeel. this is an incredible WC IPA. great body with a pleasant amount of bitterness. i dig it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,kotocar,4.75,"I don't know why I am reviewing this beer because I always know how it tastes. That's because it's always in the fridge. One of my favorite beers and that's not just because it's affordable. I love the color. Head, retention. ABV. It's great bang for your buck. And when fresh this beer is so good. If I want a IPA then Torpedo is the gold standard for me. It's not a 5.0 because IPA's aren't my favorite but in the IPA world this is close.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Jaybaby,5,"Excellent, and..... no surprise....it ranks high because it's an ipa. Go figure. Peeps who love this need to stop rating adjunct lagers. Just stay in your lane.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,MichaelKristensen4,3.5,"Sierra Nevada and hops go hand in hand. What began as a crazy idea scribbled in a pub eventually became our newest year-round hop bomb, Torpedo Extra IPA. The first beer to feature our “Hop Torpedo”—a revolutionary dry-hopping device that controls how much hop aroma is imparted into beer without adding additional bitterness. Torpedo Extra IPA is an aggressive yet balanced beer with massive hop aromas of citrus, pine, and tropical fruit.  Lækker potent IPA, den er kraftig, men med en god balance. Den har en aroma af pine og citrus. God fyldig øl til den mørkegyldne side",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,nizzle8287,4.5,"Pours a nice dark gold to copper with an off-white finger of head that reduces to something like a bubble sea with some larger bubbles forming islands that stick around, leaving some nice lacing. Smells of pine and citrus with a nice bready aroma hidden underneath Taste follows the smell; quite nicely balanced hop-malt ratio... Resinous, slightly sweet, moderately bitter. Mouth feel is medium-full; slightly above average carbonation. Alcohol is there but not overwhelming. Overall a nice brew, but seems to be hit or miss at my location in Texas. Possibly temperature issues affecting some batches here earlier this year, but this current case dated 4//7/22 is definitely on point.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Zekehound,4.4,"Excellent IPA. Not quite as hoppy as the Hazy Little thing, but a tasty, high-alcohol brew. Usually found in bottles, not cans. Hooray for that!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TheBricenator,4.04,"Look: Nearly clear rich red in color with a dense and quick-forming off-white head that holds as a pillow, slowly settling and leaving behind nice lacing Aroma: Oranges, grapefruit, pine, fresh baked bread, limes, fir needles, and the prototypical Sierra Nevada yeast phenolics Taste: A rush of citrus fruit and rind start it off and start to mingle as layers of bready malt slowly filter in and join. Pine and fir flex some once the citrus subsides and closes with citrus rejoining the coniferous notes along with a big hop bite in tow Mouthfeel: Full, lightly slick, medium-high carbonation, and moderate dryness on the finish Overall: I dig it. A classic and delicious WCIPA that drinks like its name as an ‘Extra IPA’ – bigger than an IPA but not quite in full-blown DIPA territory. Lots of citrus and conifer hop notes on top of an ample malt backbone and a welcome bite and medium dry finish. I haven’t had this in a bit but will now make a point to keep it in the regular rotation",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: Lots of hops, a little sweetness in the finish from the malt to balance it out. A little bit of citrus/fruit flavor as it warms. F: Smooth but with enough pop and bitterness that you have to sit with it a bit. O: For hop lovers it's a step up from their flagship. Don't seek it out much anymore with so many other IPA options out there, but it never fails when I do.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,barneyrubble,3.84,"L- Nice clean burnished copper color, beige head light lace. N-Hoppy nose reminds me of produce dept.

140,30420,highdesertdrinker,4.29,"Pours a medium dark copper gold with ample head and carbonation. The smell is pungent, herbal, dank, some fruit and alcohol; it’s a hoppy IPA. Taste is similar with herbal, dank, grassy hops, good bitterness, bite, with some fruit flavors that are a little more pronounced as it warms. Sierra Nevada calls it an Extra IPA and it packs a good punch and gives bitter beer lovers a good alternative to their flagship Pale Ale. If you’re a hop head and this sits in the cooler with a lot of other options then buy this without hesitation and enjoy, cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mikeinportc,4.22,"Bottled 9/7/21. so about 9 weeks old.  lightly hazy orange, with 1.5 fingers of long-lasting head, that leaves a 1/4""ring, some surface sheeting, and a 1"" ring of spotty lacing.  Smells of candied orange rind, pine, a little fresh tangerine, and slight crackery malt when swirled. .  Taste is slightly sweet orange rind, light pine and grass, barely-there (sauteed/carmelized) green onion, and a touch of biscuity malt. Moderately bitter, but in ~ perfect balance with the sweetness.  Feel is medium, with moderate, very,very fine, soft-ish carbonation tingle, that balances the light sticky/syrup base.  Overall, well-balanced, and easy-drinking. I'm enjoying it even more with analysis, & trying to notice the particulars - the mark of a very good beer.

140,30420,lagrluvr,4.25,"You either get it or you don't. It's the big boy of the Northwest, and of US IPA. Bold deep amber, off white head, big malt and Cascade hop aromas and flavors. Classic",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,imnodoctorbut,4.5,"pours a hazy deep amber body with a crazy big fluffy tanned-cream colored froth head that has very high retention and leaves big slathers of thick sticky sudsy lacing behind as it SLOWLY settles to a mid-level island cap with defined halo  aroma is big, dank, floral and pine drenched with juicy citrus vibes and thick caramel malt backbone  taste is big but balanced doses of pine, citrus (orange, lemon, pineapple), caramel malt, and undertones of the earth and spritz variety with sweet overtones. classic west coast done big and pleasant.  mouthfeel is mid-level in both carbonation and body, running moderately crisp and prickly though billowing which comes across as mostly smooth but vibrant. it finishes dry and lemon drop with pine aftertaste  overall: insanely flavorful and easy and complicated and big and balanced. it's one to beat, an instant classic, and damn-near perfect IPA of the West Coast variety",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DarrellFine,4.47,"Looks great, nice yellow-amber with decent carbonation and lacing. Smells slightly sweet with hops and pine. Fantastic. Taste is great, full of hops, pine, bitterness, slight sweetness. Mouthfeel is carbonated but smooth. A quick swish on the palate makes it slightly slick and even more pleasant.

140,30420,Bluerabbitbell,3.87,"10/27/21 A freebie from Rafe. Pours a deep cloudy amber. Smell is every so slightly sweet and malty with apricots. Nicely bitter on the tongue, particularly on the end.

140,30420,md3kcn,4.58,"Purchased as a single bottle from Kroger for $1.67. Poured into a nonic pint glass.  L - Clear amber with an incredible four-finger slightly tan and very sudsy head. Head retention is really good on this one. S - Bright, floral pine. Grapefruit rind and a bit of pineapple. Some woody notes (cedar, maybe?) and a slightly sweet earthiness. T - A bold punch of earth, right before a smooth pine note. While relatively well-balanced, this thing is seriously hoppy! Dank [cannabis] notes are hinted underneath a wonderful citrus mix; orange peel, juicy grapefruit, a hint of lemon, and a good amount of pineapple. Finish is a bitter pine tar. F - Strong. Creamy. Full-bodied and with medium carbonation. Despite being a little over 7% ABV, this thing is surprisingly easy to drink, and warms on a cold, rainy day like today. O - A fantastic representation of what Sierra Nevada is all about - hops. For any IPA lover, this is a must-try. Highly recommend.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Fenderbender0789,4.38,Reminds me of the Hoptimum (which is excellent!)- but with lil less hops n alcohol. Excellent go to dipa. Real Glad it's a year rounder! It's no Waldo's but at least you can buy it year round!!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - A good amount of piney, bitter, juicy hops and sweet malt - some earthiness and caramel as well T - Follows the nose: a balanced amount of piney, bitter, juicy hops along with notes of earth and caramel malt that comes together perfectly.

140,30420,German-Helles,3.86,"I poured this 12oz. bottle into a classic 20oz. beer glass. This amber colored ale is hazy but clear enough to watch the medium carbonation, the head was a solid three fingers of thick off white foam. As the foam receded it left thick lacing left behind. The foam never completely disappeared. The aroma is slightly sweet malts mixed in with the citrus hops. The flavor is malt first, smooth, touch of honey, then the citrus giving way to a dry, bitter, piney finish. I am very surprised by how thick and smooth this ale feels before giving way to the dry, bitter bite for the finish. This ale looked near perfect, it has a very nice feel, everything else is exactly what I expect from an IPA, bitter and dry.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Rickmeister,4.7,"This beer is so hoppy that its aftertaste reminds me of Cannabis. By this I mean the hops content is downright skunky, but 110% inoffensive in nature. The flavor is akin to the smell of a large, fresh bag of medical ganja.  I am really amazed at the number of hops they manage to pack into this fucker without ending up with a bitter, smoothie-like beer. Immensely hoppy as far as aromas and flavors are concerned; sometimes if I've been drinking it and engage in a physical activity I can actually smell the hops aroma coming out of my pores.  Carbonation is perfect, bitterness is perfect, strength is a bit stronger than moderate. I can almost not get enough of this beer; after drinking it exclusively for a few months I've gotten mildly burnt out on the flavor, but I'm about ready to go back.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BeerWizard,4.19,"Hmmm, the enigmatic Torpedo - why an Extra IPA and not just a DIPA? I've always wondered. Anyway, into a tulip this one goes.  Not much of a head generates from the pour, but it seems to be slowly making it's own just sitting there effervescing. The color is copper, and it is a clear-bodied ale. Malt and hops are pretty balanced on the nose, maybe leaning a bit to the hoppy side...maybe not.  First sip: this is a well-balanced IPA, with two things going for it: hops and malt, and lots of both. Maybe even some extra, who knows? Mouthfeel is medium to heavy and syrupy, with decent carbonation. Just solid. This piledriver of an IPA also has an unexpected floral quality in the finish, followed by a lingering bitterness.  Solid longtime offering from Sierra Nevada. Classic (Extra) IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,MadMadMike,4.13,"Every region has its local brewery that cranks out their everyday IPA. Here in Florida, the king of beer is Cigar City Jai Alai IPA. Always one in the box. Or 6.  I poured out this Torpedo into my Cigar City pint glass - I got a rule, no snifter for anything under 8.5% ABV - and it fizzed up quite nicely. Dancing bubbles, nice white head.  Right to the point, it’s hoppy, quite dry, more than a little bitter. It’s nice. Good for day drinking, probably easy to quaff at the beach. And it travelled 3000 miles to get to my hand. Good stuff.

140,30420,Blankira,4.19,"Look-Pale Amber color like you would expect from a pale ale, nice head with light lacing.  Smell-Hop forward aroma with earth notes, pine, and citrus notes  Taste-The taste follows right up with the smell, the head gives it a creaminess that goes nice with the hops, earthiness, and slightly sweet earthy notes.  Feel-Feels amazing! Smooth, creamy, and crisp it definitely gives you what a IPA should with the mouth feel of the beer.  Overall-I will buy this regularly and that is one of the biggest compliments I can give a beer. For the price point($9.99) a six pack, its arguably the best beer for the style at that price on the market.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mpyle,4.22,"Pale amber color, a slight bit of hop haze. Pours a nice 1 inch head, creamy and long lasting  Aroma struggles to get through the head, but getting an earthy hop aroma, and some caramel malt sweetness.  Great melding of malty sweetness with hop flavors from the beginning. Nice pine/earth kinds of hop flavors, and the hop bitterness on the back end hits gently at first, but grows into the finish. Nice smooth bitter finish  Medium body and carbonation. No astringency, no real warming despite the ABV level. A bit of a tongue coater, though, with the hops.  A nice, hoppy yet drinkable IPA. I like that it has a pretty assertive malt character to balance out the hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mmontalto,4.31,"Look - Dark amber, bit hazy Smell - Absolutely terrific. Pine, earthy, hints of citrus Taste - Plethora of different flavors.

140,30420,davisdahlberg6,4.04,"From a bottle and packaged on 11/03/20 and enjoyed on 2/11/2021 in a pint glass. A: Nice amber color with a half inch head of foam. Short retention time. The beer is clear with no haze or sediment. S: Dank and resinous smell with a bit of pine and maybe a hint of grapefruit. Malts smell of caramel and a bit biscuity. T: Taste follows the nose with a refreshing piney, resin taste with a bit of grapefruit and orange rind. Hoppy bitterness is well balanced with a medium body and the caramel and biscuity taste. Reminds me of Rye bread with a bitter aftertaste and a little boozy. F: Feel is grainy, its difficult to describe but I am not really a fan. It is a bit too carbonated and lacking smoothness. Leaves the mouth dry and wanting more which is a positive O: It’s a solid beer especially considering that it was $10 for a six pack of 12oz bottles. I like the piney resiny flavors of the hops and the malt flavors give it complexity and balance, but the mouthfeel isn’t pleasant and the taste is a little boozy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Big bold fruit sweet roundness into bitter dryness mmm Feel...full bright edges. Great zest carbonation. I've had this beer many times over a long time. It's very good bordering on great but its in the neighborhood of awesomeneness. Overall...This is a very good beer and if you never have had it then it is time,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,LoganFarinhas,3.66,"This is a pretty solid beer for the price. The Overall gets a worse score because the bottle was from May and it is December, for a hoppy beer, especially as advertised, they shouldn't sell past 3 months in my opinion (that also could be more on the beer store, but I digress). That being said the hop profile was still there and delicious, just heavily hindered by the age of the beer. At around 7%ABV and $1.99 for a 12fl. oz bottle, is still a great deal for a good tasting beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Aroma is pleasant though a little muted - mainly citrus and some caramel malt - hint of pine. Taste makes up for any aroma deficiencies with an explosion of caramel malt sweetness followed quickly by grapefruit pith, resinous hops, mango, and a touch of dankness. Medium full (pushing to full) mouthfeel - bittersweet, moderate carbonation, a bit of piney floral hops sit on the palate. Fantastic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,rob_likes_beer,3.98,"Torpedo IPA is one of my typical go to IPAs if I'm in the mood for something decent and consistent. Somehow, it seems highly carbonated to me which makes it initially a little harsh but it mellows out and is dry and hoppy. It's easy to get almost anywhere which is a plus. Overall, a solid standard that never lets me down.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Rug,3.87,"Bottled 1/29/20  Seems like this is a night full of discount rack beers, as I just had Red Flag from Heavy Seas. It was disappointing to say the least, but could be attributed to freshness. However, for this beer being nearly 8 months old, the price of $1 is not surprising. Still, I'm sure it held up better than the last  Pours a cloudy orange copper with 2 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing  There's a decent amount of sweetness in the nose here, with caramel malt and brown sugar balancing out dank, resiny hops with mild notes of lemon and grapefruit. A simple aroma but very nice  The hops go from heavy to mind blowingly heavy over the course of the sip, and this is an old bottle! At first, the piney hops are balanced out by subtle honey and a touch of spice. On the swallow, it turns to straight up resiny, oily hops, even a bit too much for my palate. Not necessarily bad, but it just feels like overkill  This has a medium body and mild carbonation that leads to a smooth drink, even with all the hop bitterness. Almost entirely drying on the finish and quite bitter  I'm a little conflicted with this one. I think it had good flavor, but I prefer more balance in my IPAs. I know this is a preference thing and many disagree, but it's just how I like it. Regardless, I do think it's well made and not half bad",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Limazulu,4.32,"A-beautiful dark copper with creamy foam head S-the only area where my expectations were let down. Pretty modest hints of the piney earthy citrusy contents T-Really good balance between the hops and the malts. Dank apricot, citrus and toasted bread. Above average bitter, average sweet.

S: Piney backbone, yeast funk, barley. T: Grain: Caramel, honey, toffee. Hops: Citrusy, floral (honeysuckle?), sweet notes on the front. Alcohol: Peppery pine on the back. F: Very full-bodied. Warming.  Overall: Really delicious IPA. Comparable in flavor to Terrapin's ""Hopsecutioner."" Being a grainhead, this adds something special for me, as the grains don't play second fiddle to the hops and instead say something unique alongside their whole-coned cohorts. The honeysuckle notes suggest spring, the toffee/caramel suggest winter: Just like ""Hopsecutioner,"" this is a beer for all seasons!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T - Taste follows the nose. Getting caramel and pine up front with peach as secondary.  F - Medium bodied with good carbonation. A bit dry, but easy to drink.  O - Really love what this beer brings to the table. Very well balanced, which makes it easy drinking. Enjoy the sweet caramel combined with the earthy pine.

Color is dark amber/maple with great clarity. Dark resins and pine dominate on the noise; bit of juiciness hiding way back there as well, but sticky sweetness expected from the aroma.

140,30420,Sharkbite20,4.44,"L - Dark amber looks very appetizing with nice creamy off white head. 2-3 finger head that settles to a thick cap (vs the SN Pale Ale) with lacing.  S - Goodness i could smell the aroma from a meter away. Bouquet of stone fruits, peach, pine, and some sweet malt.  T - follows the nose, starting with peach, slightly floral, pine, wet grass, herbs, citrus. Spicy. Hop bitterness is present but surprisingly not as much as in the Pale Ale! Maybe because the finish of sweet bready malt and light toast balances every off.  F - light to medium bodied and moderately carbonated but has a smooth and pleasant finish despite the pronounced bitterness. Goes down sweet and easy, before it leaves the mouth dry.  O - now i understand why this achieved an outstanding score. The special hops is highlighted yet there is perfect balance all through out the drink. The emphasis on the hops is perfectly match by the sweetness of the malt and both have a fresh, and distinctive premium flavor.  My first time to taste this type of hops and malt for $2 a bottle. Watch that sneaky alcohol. Perfect!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S- I get pine in the nose with some citrus. Can pick up some of the malty sweetness aroma hidden behind the hops. Definitely a west coast IPA.  T- Very slight toasted flavor from the pale malt and can pick up some sweetness. Earthy bitterness from the hops that linger in a good way. Some citrus as it warms up.

140,30420,CoryNaplesFlorida,2.53,Ok...2 stars because this beer does not taste like an IPA. Tastes like a nut brown ale. There is Zero Citrus. Not very Hoppy either. I only bought it cause it was 2 for 1 at Publix. Now I have to go back and get some real IPA. I'll keep these other 11 bottles for a BBQ or a party.

The taste is pretty much identical to the smell, piney & citrusy; has a nice bitter aftertaste that I'm quite fond of. The feel is pretty coarse with light carbonation, not to fizzy. Overall, this beer is an okay double IPA. I think that the OG Sierra Nevada IPA is far more desirable to drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Appears amber, clear, with a nice foamy head and lacing that lasted. Smells floral, piney, lightly bready. Taste follows the nose, all balanced, together.

140,30420,CCStix,4.48,"This is just a well balanced IPA. Haven't had a Torpedo in a while since the space is so crowded these days and I'm always trying something new. After going back to this I realize why its such a staple. Pours a nice copper color with a 2 finger head. The smell is of some sweet malt with a soft/medium hop profile which leans more piney. It's exceptionally smooth on the download with a medium bitterness upfront that lasts just long enough on the back of the palate to not be off putting. It strikes a nice harmony between malts and piney hops in a way that captures the essence of a solid IPA. A classic, a gem and something I need to bring back into the mix more frequently.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

And...as much as I love the thought of continuing to try new and exciting beers, I realize I've gotten to the point where I know my comfort. And that's my favorite, go-to IPA, Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra. It's an outstanding amount of hops, but not overkill. Very well balanced nose, with a nice citrus/floral flavor, and a wonderful finish. Easy on the carbonation as well, so much so, that it drinks a LOT smoother than a 7.2 ABV should, and ends up smacking you around, but nicely. All this being said, I think save for the occasional stout/porter to mix with it, whenever I 'do' go pick up some beers, it is, without question going to be the Torpedo.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Mindcrime1000,4.11,"Poured from a can into a nonic glass.  Pours a dark orange--nearly amber--with a great fluffy and creamy white head that lasts for several minutes. Even after it subsides, there is some nice soapy foamy lacing.  Classic down the middle American IPA aromas. Grapefruit, evergreen, guarded caramel and pale malts, and hints of floral and earthy hops.  The brew's flavor follows the nose, and is well-balanced. Caramel malts hit the tip of the tongue first, but are quickly balanced by some firm but not heavy-handed hop notes from all quarters--earthy, floral, evergreen, and citrusy. Pale malts in midstream. A touch of white pepper and herbal/chive flavor at the finish, along with a bit of warming alcohol.  The brew has a great feel. Solid and medium-bodied, it still has a naturally drying quality that mates well with good carbonation to make this very drinkable, although a 7+% probably shouldn't be called sessionable.  A well-balanced approach to the style that has an excellent dry finish that makes it really drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,irs,4.38,"The deep bronze color is not unattractive, but somehow, it seems wrong for an IPA. Foam is light with lingering lacing. The citrus is all in the smell. Once I drink, its dominant hop bitterness with a light mouthfeel at the front of the tongue. Malt sweetness in the middle. In the back of my mouth I'm getting a lot of hop oils and the other side of that bitterness. Somehow, there is something very distinctive about the bitterness of Sierra Nevada ales.

Taste - a blast of hops to the mouth. not all bitterness, but does come in waves and lingers for a good while. similar to the mouthfeel, mostly pine flavor that is supplemented by the slightly malty finish. Feel - medium bodied, average carbonation, and decently strong at 7.2% ABV. Overall - this is what I would call an old school American IPA.

I am not a connossieur who can articulate the flavor nuances, but I have been a beer enthusiast for 50 years and I have found none better. I was introduced to Sierra Nevada by a relative who is a chef in a high end restaurant in Portland, ME with an on-site micro brewery. One day he wandered back to the brewery area and the brew master was drinking a beer--Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.

Nice champagne streaming bubbles. Opaque with lots of tiny particles floating around. Great thing note worthy about the bottle presentation: Its classic and from what I know has not changed. Moving along to the smell. The aroma is that of a classic west coast IPA. I get the most similar aromas from west coast beer. Upfront with Pineapple and maybe passion fruit. It leads into a pine resin. Very sweet and tropical. Now for taste. The flavor is simple big rich pineapple and passion fruit leading into a resinous hop finish. Very simple IPA with good flavor.

The aroma is full of hop character - citrus fruit, pine, and floral notes come to the front. There is not much in the way of malt in the aroma.  The flavor follows suit with big hop character - a firm bitterness followed by notes of grapefruit and pine. The malt is balancing without subtracting from the hops.  Medium bodied and drinkable.  Great example of the style. Always a good choice when fresh.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,defunksta,4.06,"Look: Pours a darker, sexy, clear amber color, almost representative of an amber or cider ale. A good off-white head that lingers forever. SRM of 13-15. This IPA lets you know it's going to kick you in the mouth. (4.50)  Aroma: Strong aroma of caramel, soapy orange citrus, and some pine. Lots of red fruit, grapefruit, passionfruit, unripened pineapple with some coconut cream to it, which I suspect is the malts. Some floral notes. A massive piney backbone. Subtle mint. But the aroma finish sweet with a strong caramel malt backbone. (4.00)  Taste: Interestingly i was hit first by the malt flavors. Some toasted bread and caramel profile. Then come the hops. Strong resinous and soapy tangerine, red fruit, and grapefruit citrus as expected. There is also some pineapple and coconut This is followed by a pine and dark caramel suds bitterness that is classic for Sierra Nevada that is quite sweet. Thinking it's going to finish sweet as you put the glass down this bitterness builds on the palate like a hot pepper that hits late. (4.00)  Feel: Medium-bodied yet has a ton of malts. Very chewy. Carbonation is moderate. Not too syrupy. (3.75)  Compared side by side to Founder's Centennial IPA 6/28/20: This one has a slightly lighter color. Lighter body. More citrus flavor. Equally hopped bitter finish. More caramel. This one is more light and orange citrus flavored, whereas Founder's heavier with more candied tropical fruit and melon.  Compared with Stone IPA: It is much darker in color. A much stronger Sierra Nevada style spicy caramel malt profile. Heavier and sweeter. More bitterness and astringency. I think ultimately Torpedo more resembles the Centennial than Stone.  Compared to Surly Furious IPA 5/7/20: Pours a lighter, orange color. Milder aromas. More resinous tangerine, redfruit, and caramel. Less hoppy and more alcohol burn. Winner: Surly 1/14/21: Pours a lighter, orange color. Milder aromas. More resinous citrus and pine soap. Less burnt caramel and pinecones. Sweeter, and less bitter.  Compared to Surly's Overrated West-Coast IPA 5/23/20: Pours a darker color. More dank and resinous pine and caramel. Less soapy citrus flavors but more sudsy. More spicy caramel, yet I think less sweetness. More smooth though and less bitter.  Compared to Jai Alai 6/14/20: Pours a darker orange color. Aromas of more earthy & resinous citrus/pine. Less soapy orange juice. Less hop flavor and less orange. More caramel overall.  Compared to Celebration 2020 10/30/20: Pours a lighter color. Stronger aromas/flavors. More orange and pine soap. More hoppy overall.  Compared to Deschutes Fresh Squeezed 2/5/21: Clearer. More citrus/pine aromas rather than nectarine. Similar resin profile. Similar bitterness too, although this may be slightly more bitter. Overall, quite similar.  Compared to Walnut River's High Beam IPA 2/19/21: Pours a similar, slightly darker color. More resinous and candied orange/caramel & pine soap. Less apple and nectarine. Heavier bodied and sweeter, but similar bitterness.  Compared to Dogfishhead 60 Minute iPA 4/19/21: Pours a darker color. Stronger aromas. More sweet and orange and classic pine soap. Similar caramel malts. Slightly less spice, but more fruit flavor.  to Terrapin Hopsecutioner IPA 1/21/22: Pours a darker color with a larger head. Milder aromas. More caramel malt and spice. Less orange and tangerine.  to Revolution Anti Hero 6/14/22: Pours darker, stronger head, milder aromas. More smooth caramel and resin. Less spiced caramel, pine, and citrus. Sweeter and less bitter.  Overall: This is a really great west-coast IPA worth coming back to. It has a nice chewy, darker, sweeter, caramel malt profile. Great red fruit, nectarine, caramel, yet soapy. Chewy ORANGE, CARAMEL, and SOAP. The bitterness crawls out of the underbelly. One of the best west-coast IPAs made and and will tickle the tongue enough for you hop heads. Not the best out there, but a traditional and staple for the style.

Its not really that complex, but it smells really good. Taste: Taste pretty much follows the nose, but the IBUs are a tad deceptive as this is a fairly bitter beer, Chinook maybe? The hops also give the beer a slightly sticky quality, but there is a good sized malt backbone that is just a touch sweet. As Torpedo warms, it becomes more grapefruit forward.

Close to a two finger, white colored head, which slowly recedes. Leaves behind sheets of lacing. Expressive aroma of citrus and pine hops, with some caramel malts (more in the background). Taste is redolent with hops (orange citrus, piney resin, and lighter floral). Certainly a caramel malt component. Bitterness is there but not overboard. Balanced by a slightly sweet aspect. Medium to full mouth feel. Good carbonation. A beer that begs each sip to linger in the mouth in order to experience the full spectrum of aroma and flavor. Years ago, before the explosion of craft beer choices, this beer was in my regular rotation. Coming back to this beer again emphasizes the craft expertise of this brewer.

Smell is amazing - sweet malt, sweet grass, hops, fruit (strawberry, pineapple, peach). I would not drink this with a super heavy meal such as prime rib because it is a fairly heavy beer. I love drinking this as dessert, after my meal or with appetizers. I love the fact that the carbonation is very low, i don't like super carbonated beers. The taste is so great because it isn't too bitter, it's sweet bready malt, medium oily body with strong hop taste on the back end. The hop oil really makes this beer stand out. My body feels good when i drink this beer which is unusual.

Upon taking a mouthful, the malt unfolds its sweetness up front before it makes room for the complex transition from pine and resin notes to fruity grapefruit bitterness from the hops, which stays well into the finish with relatively gentle warmth and a tannic zing.

140,30420,Nass,4.34,"This is one interesting west coast IPA. I am not a big fan of a west coast IPAs, but this is one that I can sit back & tolerate. There is just enough maltiness there to make me want to stick around & finish the bottle. I can see a place for this style of beer, this something that I can actually enjoy every once in a while. On the taste their is some sharp citrus, some pine, some malt, slight herbal, slight spice, & a slight earthy vegetal character . I definitely do not see myself drinking this type of beer every week but once in while this would be a real treat. This is a really well made beer where nothing is really outdoing each other, the piney hops leave a lingering tingle on the tongue. One thing that I notice that is as soon as this beer starts to warm up a bit after sitting on the stand out of the fridge for 10-15 minutes this beer starts to intensify & get more bitter tasting, with that being said this would definitely not be an everyday drinker for me. Furthermore, the date on my bottle shows that this beer is almost 2 months old, not bad. Man I tell you this is the type of beer that really sits on your palate like you just ate some spicy food & the pepper is still lingering around. If you're new to craft beer you problem won't be able to tolerate this but as you become a novice then you would see the bright side of things that this beer has to offer.

140,30420,ManapuaMan,4.1,"Reached for a cold six pack while visiting family on Oahu; the grocery store pickings are slim out here in the Pacific so it’s a boon to be able to lean on SN’s trademark consistency and availability. Bottled about eight weeks ago so nothing to complain about from a freshness standpoint.  Nice golden copper hue with a puffy white head; looks like a classic IPA that, for me, Sierra Nevada basically sets the standard.  Aroma is marked by an earthy spiciness but also pine, resin, rind and a touch lemongrass all laid atop a slightly sweet and toasted malt. Green, citrusy and spicy. Great combo.  Taste is hops - green pine, citrus rind, grapefruit and papaya - and toasted and bready malt. Unbalanced balance, if you know what I mean. Nice bitterness that ties it all together.  Finishes with a kiss of resin but still crisp and dry. Lingering bitterness is pleasant. Perfect carbonation washes the flavors over the palate. No alcohol presence.

140,30420,Snowcrash000,4.25,"Pours a slightly cloudy, deep amber coloration with a large, creamy, lasting head. Smells of bready, caramel malt and citrus/resinous hops, with notes of orange rind and a hint of pine. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt and fruity, bitter, resinous and slightly floral hops, with citrus notes of grapefruit and orange rind, as well as some pine also coming through. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some grapefruit and pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  I had previously rated this at 6 months old, which was still perfectly enjoyable, but have to say that it's so much better at 3 and half months old, with the citrus hops and resinous bitterness really standing out a lot more here than I remember, with a less pronounced malt sweetness, although there still is a good malt backbone to this. Really shows what a difference 3 months can make when it comes to freshness. Terrific old school IPA that I really wish I could consistently get fresh and at the same price it's in the USA.

Almost clear and golden orange in color with a 3 finger white head becoming thick and clingy as it recedes.  Grassy and piney hops predominate. I thought a caught a bit of funk initially, but decided it was a hint of caramel or toffey from the malts. Sweet and hoppy from the bottle.  Definitely not skunked. Initially, the taste is nearly dry and moderately bitter on the tongue, Then, on the swallow, the bitter piney hops try to duke it out with the rising sweet malts before the flavors fade with no clear winner. Taste of alcohol.  Moderately full in body. Crisp yet creamy. Moderate syrup coats the mouth. Drying, but not really astringent.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Not my favorite but would drink if handed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Reviewer says it’s just ok but not too complicated, then goes on to describe it as follows; ( “ dank, floral, herbal, caramel, pine, sweet, flavour is actually quite fruity, sweet fruit, orange, lemon, melon, cantaloupe, dank, piney, floral, some caramel and a hint of vanilla perhaps, some brown bread malt flavour too,”)  OMG.

Not too strong for the hop flavor but a solid IPA. My buddy likes this beer and I had yet to try it. I'd never turn one down but there are other IPA's I'd rather have. This is an easy drinking beer and maybe an excellent palate cleanser. Overall I enjoyed the Torpedo but it wouldn't be on my favorites list for IPA's today.

140,30420,cleefwood,3.94,"One of my go to IPAs. Probably has something to do with availability and price, but I'd still pick this over any other IPA in this price range (Sam Adam's is the only other one I can think of).  So, on to the beer. The appearance is an amber orange hue with a nice foamy head that dissipates rapidly. On the nose, I get some mild pine and copper malt notes, and that's about it. Once I take a sip, I get strong pine hop flavors with a light malt backbone. The mouth feel is moderate and indicative of it's 7.2% abv.  Overall, this is a solid IPA especially considering it's price and availability. However, there are better offerings which offer more complexity in flavor and aroma for a few dollars more.

140,30420,scooob,3.02,"I've tried this occasionally through the years, always wanting to like it, especially since it's often the only DIPA at the grocery store, and since SN Pale Ale was the first hop-forward craft beer I ever had and loved, way back in the day. But I've never taken to the lingering one-note harshness that Torpedo finishes with. To each his own, but I'd much much rather have a Lagunitas Maximus or Hop Stoopid (to name a couple that aren't too hard to find). I need things to end on a sweeter note, in life and in beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,UtahBeerPleb,4.18,"Very classic look. Smells quite nice but without anything overpowering. The taste is very similar - quite piney, with some grapefruit and an above-average maltiness for an IPA, which is alright by me. The hoppiness is prominent but not overpowering (you won't find a hoppy sensory overload here), and there's no overly bitter after-taste. Nothing jumps out at me as exceptional, but it's remarkably well-rounded and quite tasty - deserving of its reputation. It won't be my go-to IPA, but will always be a solid choice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Aroma is mostly malty, with slight hops & a bit of a sour mash scent. I was hoping for more hop on the nose. Upon tasting, I'm getting a full malt flavour with decent smooth full mouthfeel but not all that much in the hops department. There's some mild pine bitterness which lingers until the end of the sip, but not much more than that & certainly no complex combination of hop flavours - not really even quite what passes for an IPA these days.

140,30420,thebiglebowski,3.98,"I love this beer - however I'm rating it as I drink it after having a Saint Arnold's Endeavour (double IPA, probably my favorite IPA right now). This is a very bitter beer (which I love). The aroma is not quite there and it tastes very hoppy (65 IBU). Alcohol content is 7.2% but you can kinda tell that it's high, which to me is not ideal. I like high-alcohol-content beers but I like the ""smooth"" ones, not the ones that you can necessarily tell that are heavy in alcohol. That being said, this one gets a 4/5 in taste. Overall it's a great beer, ideal for those who like hoppy American IPA's.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,GarrettB,3.66,"January 29th, 2015 - Torpedo is everywhere. EVERYWHERE. But the omnipresence is a good thing. Wherever you go in San Diego, if you need an impromptu six-pack of reasonable quality, just like the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, the Sierra Nevada Torpedo is a solid choice. The brew looks like a dark amber beer, promising a depth of flavor, which is reaffirmed in the nose. Hoppy and bready, it tells a tale of sociable bitterness, but without being heavy, sticky or sweet. The flavor is pronouncedly balanced, and while the hop profile doesn't sound out, it plays well with all the other ingredients. Slightly metallic, slightly sweet, it offers enough of interest to give a beer drinker pause, without interrupting the evening's event.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Just very well balanced.  O: I love this Extra IPA just so well balanced on Hops, citrus and pine. Has perfect balance in all flavors. Mouthfeel is great. Perfect balance of hops and I'm a Hop head.

Smells of sweet fresh cut grass and bitterness. The aroma doesn't knock you over.  Tastes strongly of bitter pine and resin dankness. Can also pick just a touch of alcohol.  Mouthfeel is sticky with a very strong bitter aftertaste. Even with the bitterness, it's fairly easy to drink.  Overall, this is a great old-school IPA.

A: The body recalls a west coast IPA, having that orange-y, coppery tone with a crisp tone, absolutely no haziness. The head is white to beige, has a 1 finger thickness and besides having an average to low retention, there's some good lacing. S: The aroma is very creamy of citrus and also some belgian candy (very weird). Almost a bit biscuity. There's a minor hoppy aroma resembling some resin and if you concentrate, you can feel the alcohol. T: The taste begins with a citrus of orange and tangerine and also some pineapple like flavour. It then extends to the weird super sweet flavour that, for me, tastes like belgian candi but it's totally impossible to have this on such style. In the end, a mild hoppiness with a bland character. M: Body is medium. Carbonation is great. Alcohol is in fact unnoticed. Bitterness is mild but being packaged almost one year ago, who wouldn't expect that? O: It's a bad idea to have this without being fresh. However, there's a sense at how this beer can taste when it's fresh and I really want to try it again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JackRWatkins,3.77,"A: Pours with a creamy, off-white, one-finger head and a golden-amber body, very nice to look at. S: immediate pine and fresh orange, very juicy (and though I don't imagine this was true when originally put out) and minimal/straightforward in presentation. The pine and orange dominate with a wet lemon bringing up the rear. T: One sip of this and the defining traits of America's brewing resurgence in the late 70's becomes clear, hoppy beers yes, but more significantly, hoppy beers with a strong malt body to back them up. I also get some phenolic notes in the form of banana and a prominent, though not overwhelming bitterness (how far we've come, no?). The bitterness is clean, with a somewhat subtle astringent pinch that is very satisfying. M: Full bodied and sticky, but with a nice carbonation. O: It's no sierra nevada pale ale, but hell, what is? This is a very pleasant beer that still holds up after all this time (a feat in it's own right. A testament to the skill and dedication of Ken Grossman and Co.

The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is mixed with citrus, pine and caramel malt all showing up at times. The taste is resiny pine up front with semisweet caramel in the middle before sticky, piney bitterness finishes the sip. There is a hint of citrus in the taste as well.

The color is a copper medium light amber. There is plenty of aroma from floral piney hops which seem like they will never end. There is plenty of taste from hops which is a distinct citrus/pine. Bitterness is full throughout the palate with a hint of malt which offers a pine finish. They claim 65 IBUS. I believe it!

The smell is clearly IPA, with citrus and herbal notes as the prominent components though they aren’t intense as I would have guessed, and there is also a significant sweet bready malt presence. This beer has a blend of hop flavors with herbal and pine notes being the most obvious. Some light citrus character, caramel, and toasted bread flavors round it out. The finish is fairly dry and the pine bitterness lingers a bit. The body is medium. I remember that this was probably the first extra IPA (or DIPA) I ever tried and when I first tried it about 15 years ago I thought it was amazingly bitter and not to my taste at all. Now after having lived in SD for a time and having drank a wide variety of IPAs it seems actually pretty measured, even a bit malt forward, for an extra IPA. I recognize that this is kind of a classic, but it’s not one of my favorite Sierra Nevada beers.

140,30420,torrid_nc,4.31,"I'm still kind of new at the IPA game. This was the first time I'd tried this particular beer after working my way through Two Hearted Ale, Dogfish 60/90 minute, etc.  I let it set a bit as I have never enjoyed an IPA ice cold. It poured a beautiful golden amber color with a nice head into a pint glass. Generally with an IPA I am overcome with competing citrus/bitterness at first, and it takes me a while to appreciate the full flavor of the beer. This one was immediately balanced from the first sip, and stayed that way through the last.  A very good IPA for the intermediate IPA-drinker.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,MackT,4.23,"Wow, u mean I can find this easily? Yes I can, Wal-Mart , grocery stores, etc. I'm having misgivings due to the popularity of this easily obtainable ale.

L: Clear Copper, two finger off-white head that's super foamy and retains very well and sticks to the glass like nothing I have seen before.  S: Rich hop profile here, citrus with grapefruit, floral, leafy/herbal, spicy and pine.  T: Again, lots of hops making themselves known here, you get a citrus dash with an herbal middle and a piney finish. Really complex. Surprisingly there is a malt note hidden in there too.  F: Medium-Full, dry, below average amount of carbonation. Smooth, almost chewy.  O: Simply superb.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Dr_Gonzo,4.56,"This is a really fantastic and neat find in any ordinary store! It's fairly carbonated and has a very thick head to it with its rich, hazy amber color. There's a blast of awesome bitter hoppy, floral, and citrus flavors that quenches the mouth every time I take a sip, most notably pineapple juice to balance out the spicy hops. Grapefruit peel is prominent in the aftertaste. It smells really great and has a combination of different scents, pine being a strong indicator.  Overall I like to have one on occasion as a delicate treat.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Stoutmaster9,4.21,"Poured from a 24 FL. OZ. into a pint glass.  Amber-orange. Clear with bountiful bubble streams. Half a finger head, willowy-thin.  Smells minimal. Bread, malt.  Swift, sour bread flavors charge in the vanguard, then stale grapefruit. Tangy is the initial aftertaste, tart & tangy. Pine flavor begins subtle, grows intense, yet is kept in check by the crushing carbs, dominant hops.  A zesty buzz, busy and bold.  I gave this a try back in the 90s, if memory serves, me very first Pine brew experience, a pint handed to me without any warning. Shock and revulsion. The tides of time have refined my pallet, but I have been gravitating towards the ""Emperor"" (Imperial) style of late, be it IPA, Red ale, or Stout.  Torpedo is a delicious, ground breaking brew! A perfect staging ground, perhaps, before moving on to a Double IPA bomber!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Caveworm,4.5,"Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA | Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. Poured from the bottle into a Southern Tier 2xIPA glass, the head is three fingers thick and off-white, with webbed lacing, and a rather deep golden amber body.  Smells like a solid representation of the hop characteristics mentioned on the label : citrus, pine, and herbal without being too cloying. I also get a whiff of Townhouse cracker malts. You know what I mean; buttery, cracker-y, etc.  I taste the ""pine"" note upfront, which also lingers to balance the underrated malt base going on help prevent such a hop-forward brew. The citrus comes into play about mid-swig to really bring out the ""juiciness"" of this beer.  Medium mouthfeel with mild carbonation.  Overall, I'll give Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA | Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. a 4.5.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Sak3,3.89,"Look: A deep amber in extremely low lighting, even less then normal. Smell: I smell mostly pine and there is a hint of fruit to it. Taste: This beer lacks a taste for the most part of the instant it touches my pallet. Until it sits in my mouth for a little bit and then I got a real kick of fruit. This was a little off touching for a general expectation for a beer. Feel: A smooth feeling after it first hits my mouth. After I let it sit for a little bit and then swallow it there is a real tingle from the high levels of carbonation. The carbonation felt here might have been a bit too over the top for me, but still overall it was fair.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,california_republic,5,"Look: Slightly cloudy amber with ample 2-finger head that leaves lots of laciness when subsided.  Smell: Bold, strong grapefruit followed by an undertone of pine and subtle malty bread. Smells like it's going to taste good.  Taste: Although it's described as an extra IPA, there's plenty of malts here to give it a bready taste. Hoppy sweetness and some subtle lemony tartness to balance out a flavor profile dominated by malts and pine.  Feel: Incredibly crisp on the tongue, even when pouring with more head than I probably should have. The maltiness of it gives it huge body and flavor, making it feel great to drink without it being sickly malty sweet like a heller bock. The main fruit I get out of the finish is actually watermelon; it taste much more like watermelon than Ballast Point's Watermelon Dorado. The hops finish it off with pine and bitterness.  Overall: The extra hoppiness of this one will probably take an enthusiast to appreciate, but an enthusiast will also appreciate how strikingly balanced Sierra Nevada's IPA is. Despite setting the trend for American pale ales and describing itself as an ""extra"" IPA, it's really the maltiness of Torpedo that makes it stand out amongst the many excellent American IPAs out there that have come to follow. Sierra Nevada is a big believer in balance, and it's really the balance of Torpedo along with the boldness of flavor that lets Torpedo stand out. While this beer might be too much for some tongues, it's absolutely iconic and just about perfect for any fan of American pale ales. The uniqueness of this masterpiece and its amazing drinkability probably makes this my favorite IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,downhillpunk32,5,"It always bothers me when beer snobs say Sierra Nevada is good ""for a big brewery."" This beer shows that SN is better than good, they're amazing, period. For a company that could be living off of brand recognition, Torpedo is a recent addition to their line of beer that shows they're not afraid to try something new. They hit the nail on the head. This is my favorite beer of all time, bar none. I've had IPAs that cost 5 times as much and would sell their soul to the devil to taste half as good as Torpedo.

I am getting some light herbal scents and it has a bit of a flowery aroma but they are very soft.  Taste: It is immediately noticeable how clean the beer is. The flavors come through very crisp and clear. Up front there is a light herbal pine flavor that flows through the mid-palate all the way to the end. It finishes with a nice woody and mossy flavor at the end.  Mouthfeel: It is a very clean and easy drinking beer. Great carbonation, great bitterness, and it is just an overall enjoyable beer to drink. It has a nice dry finish that accents the flavors.

It pours with a very small, but adequate head and has nice crisp carbonation bubbles for the entirety of the glass as you drink it. Nice somewhat above average IPA. I usually am unwilling to buy a 6'er of a non-Texas beer, but this one might be a winner for me. The ABV level is just about right in terms of bang for the buck for those who don't prefer Double IPA's. Overall I prefer a Double IPA, but I would definitely put this high on my list.

Citrus, lime, pineapple, tropical fruit, melon, passion fruit, pine, grassy, some spice, and slight herbal, all of these aromas are derived from its good hop profile. Malt is also there with notes of biscuit, dough, and sweet caramel.  Very well balance taste, it is hoppy at the start with notes of pine, resin, grass, some spice, subtle herbal, citrus, and lime. Malt dwells and speaks in the undertone with its sweet, biscuit, and caramel while hop wraps up again in the finish by clean, solid, and good lingering bitterness.  Full body with good crisp and some lively carbonation through the palate, smooth mouthfeel, refreshing, finish is very pleasantly dry.

140,30420,TooLucid,4.53,"A personal favorite and go-to. Wonderful color and head. An ideal level of carbonation and a pleasing mouth feel. Smooth and nuanced at the beginning with what I consider the most delightful bitter finish. If I'm in the mood for an IPA Torpedo always delivers. Not to mention it's notably cheaper than the next best ""find it most anywhere"" IPA, Bell's Two Hearted Ale.

Nice medium body mouthfeel. Sierra Nevada is the embodiement of ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". This is probably my favourite ipa and one of my daily drinkers. Nice bitter IPA with a medium body. 7.2% abv, enough to be good after one or two. But not too high so it wouldn't be hard to drink a 6pack on a hot summer day.

140,30420,Jeffo,2.88,"Got this one at an Albert Heijn somewhere around here.  From a bottle into a snifter Best Before 25 August 2017 IBU: 65  APPEARNCE: Pours a three finger, frothy, creamy white head with excellent retention. Perfectly clear tangerine orange with medium levels of carbonation. Head foams up and slowly fades to a full foamy cap and leaves foamy lacing on the glass. A foamy wisp remains leaving chunky lacing on the glass as it empties.  SMELL: Pale malts, some melon, plenty of grassy and hay-like character, and a touch of citrus aroma on the nose. Barnyard qualities in this one.  TASTE: Pale malts, some hay and melon notes up front. The barnyard qualities to this one are pretty evident. A medium but lingering finish of pale malts, grain, flavors of grass and hay, light notes of citrus fruits and some hop bitterness linger. This is closer to a bitter Belgian pale with some light funk.  PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Plenty creamy and frothy on the palate, goes down fine and finishes a touch on the drier side. Some light bitterness lingers.  OVERALL: A good beer but not my favorite take on an American IPA. This one’s got a good deal of grass and barnyard character to it, which reminds me very much of some of my favorite Belgian strong pale ales. This is not a hoppy, citrus forward example of the style, which is what I look forward to when picking up bottles marked “IPA.” Worth checking out if you like hoppier, more bitter Belgian style strong pales, but not if you’re up for an American hop bomb.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I would rather have sierra's original pale ale although the torpedo does have a 7 abv vs 5.5, however when it comes to ipa Founders centennial or Bells two hearted wins me over. Still this a delicious beer if you have it. I prefer only getting it when it comes in variety packs but would never get it on its own unless you never tried it. Sierra has a black iPa that out does the torpedo as well does their hoppy lager. But I must say this beer is perfect for spring, summer, and fall months. It is delicious with its bitter hops but just doesn't excite me as others on the market. And yes it's best in a tulip glass and color is a golden orangish brown color.

140,30420,ChristianAlexander,4.21,"A strong IPA weighing in at 7.2% ABV but with a drinkability of a Belgian wit Beer. Its bold and complex aroma is reminiscent of the Sierra Nevada mountains: pine, citrus, and a host of other herbal varieties which are insufflated up your sniffer so when you chug it down you are actually well prepared for the hoppy storm that's soon to come. I've found myself many times pouring a bottle into a large wine glass so I can really smell its aroma as I sip it down. For the more advanced beer drinkers, I recommend throwing a straw into the cup and shoving the top end up your right nostril while plugging the other with your finger. Let out all the air you can from your mouth until there is none left in your lungs then finally inhale as hard as you can through your nose for a glorious onslaught of taste, smell, and mind-numbing feelings.

Doesn't offer a tremendous amount of nuance beyond that, but is satisfying through the whole swig and lasts on the palate well beyond the point that you finished it (you can still taste it after you finished it and that's both a good thing and not just the alcohol lingering).  Highly recommended to anyone who fancies a good bitter IPA and doesn't want to go hunting for exotic breweries.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,jamesroses,4.55,"355ml bottle. Bottled on April 2nd 2016, drank on August 3rd 2016.  Appearance: pours beautiful amber with 3 finger head of small bubbles that stays there for a long time. Very good lacing.  Smell: took a sniff from the bottle and knew I was in for a treat. Great floral, piny and fruity aromas: cantaloupe, pear, red apple and a little peach come to mind. A little of a honey and bourbon character too. Absolutely amazing.  Taste: piney and fruity as the smell with a strong malty backbone that makes it a solid beer. The hoppiness is really balanced, not agressive nor astringent.  Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied, but you feel the hoppiness in the mouth for a long time. Not astringent but finishes dry.  Overall: my first IPA ever, and I think this is a great great beer. Very well balanced between hoppiness and malt, great look, smell and taste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,biegaman,4.12,"Torpedo pours with beefy eggshell white foam that leaves decorative lacing nothing short of lovely. The body is a little clouded and its deep tawny amber colour is a shade or two darker than many IPAs. That said, it looks absolutely afire when held above eye level and has a complexion resembling a fully illuminated stain glass window.  Just when IPAs were starting to feel redundant, leave it to a widely available ten year veteran to rekindle my interest. This aroma had me fully captivated from the first sniff. There are many dimensions to this one, ranging from leafy and resinous to zestful and spicy to citrusy and just a touch tangy. It's fetching in a way only whole-cone hopped beers can be.  There's also a noticeable amount of toasty, buttery-sweet malt, a feature that also plays out on the palate. The pine and candied citrus are still there, but there's a reliable amount of nutty, caramelized grain they've got to compete with, especially in the finish. The two sets of flavours compliment each other splendidly.  The question must be asked: what makes Torpedo an ""Extra"" IPA? Admittedly, it has a lot less restraint than is typically for a Sierra Nevada beer but it still pales in intensity compared to other American IPAs. On the spectrum of ""hop bomb"" to ""hop sparkler"" this probably ranks as a ""hop grenade"". It's impactful but not maximum damage.  Sierra Nevada's branding is modest and elementary, but also consistent and charismatic - their recipes are much the same. Torpedo is probably their boldest regular offering yet still has the brewery's trademark approachability, balance and purity of flavour. It's these reasons I appreciate it even more now than when I first tried it 8 years ago.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,cha0scypher,4.3,"An explosion of flavor! Dark Amber color, citrusy hoppy scent and flavor, taste and mouthfeel are great but the finish is what I love best about this one.

140,30420,jzeilinger,4.03,"Canned on 06/09/16.  A - Pours a nice clear, deep color with a thick, frothy bright white head that's very sticky on the sides of the glass.  S - A hint of herbalness, and dominated by spicy pine aroma with a thick sweet caramel malt.  T - Follows the nose. Strong caramel malt backbone followed with citrus, and towards the end the palate gets hit with an assertive dose of piney resin bitterness that scrubs the sweetness away and then morphs into a lingering pine/bitter grapefruit bitterness (with a little bit of floral buried in the mix).  M - Thick and full bodied with a little bit of boozy effervescence permeating up to the sinuses.  O - It's been a long time since I've had this beer and can""t figure out why I never reviewed it before (probably because it's been so hard to find in my area anywhere close to fresh). I forgot how good and how solid this beer is and for the price point, it's hard to beat.

Also sweet malt characteristics  Taste: Well balanced, hoppy , bitter & spicy with malty sweetnes. Mild carbonation  That is an awesome beer, really. Strong aromas, very tasty.

That doesn't mean I don't think this is a great beer, just can't consider this to be on par with so many great IPA's out there.

Taste something sweet, initially, with something spicy as well, something like coriander, but I cannot identify it. Seems to better in big swigs. Has an extremely bitter, grapefruit-seed after-taste that really digs in and entrenches itselfinto the palate. Fades to sweet linger. Getting better as I'm going.  Has a biting mouth-feel.  Good, but not nearly as good as what the BA score says. Worth a try, but I'm not having this again, not with the plethora of other, better IPAs out there. Don't believe all the hype.

Small half finger white head, which lapses into a ring.  Smell: Sweet floral hops. along with pine, resin, and citrus fruits.  Feel: Medium bodied, closer to the light side, with mild carbonation, Easy drinkablity.  Taste: Bitter hops balance citrus and tropical fruits perfectly along with sweet malts.

Feel- 4 – Medium body with moderate carbonation, very smooth with a nice warm alcohol feel to it. Overall- 4.25 – The extra hoppiness adds a great bitterness that isn't citrusy.

Taste is biscuit malt, maple, caramel, piney and floral hops, and a papery malt and woody hop finish.  Medium body with fluffy carbonation.  Solid IPA, good aroma, pretty pour. Flavor could stand to have a little more richness on the malty side. Bready notes are a little stale feeling. The hops balance fine. Not very fruity which is fine, but perhaps surprising for a west coast brewery. Drinks heavy. Overall solid and worth trying.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste: Although there's the slightest hint of malt upfront, overall this one's a bit overly one-dimensional for my taste; Heavy citrus that builds on the palate.  Feel: well balanced.  Overall: Wanted to like this one, but for anyone who wants/needs a little malt/sweet pushback in their single/double IPA's, this one comes up short. Can't recommend SN's 2016 Big Foot Barleywine enough though, if you want a beer that offers sweet and bitter in the same glass.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

You get a smell of floral, pine, orange, apricot.. man this beer has some strong flavors. Perfect taste. If you're an ipa guy you would love this one. Just a perfect flavor that is so well balanced and crisp.  Look for the date on this beer. If you can get it within 10 days of the bottled date like I did you are in for a treat.

Lots of pine, herbs, dankness, citrus peel, fruit pith, biscuity malt. . . . Slobberingly good, and the taste delivers the same profile. Light-ish body, gentle alcohol warmth, medium carbonation.

140,30420,Squire,4.21,"Appearance: Looks hazy at first until you realize that's just the depth of the rich amber color. Like bottled late afternoon sunlight. Rich, small bead white cap with good lacing.  Aroma: Earthy, spicy hops, rich malt core, good interplay between the two.  Taste: Tasty hops announce the entry like a trumpet voluntary. Rich caramel malts follow with hops sailing above the solid malt structure. This is good stuff. Finish is is the reverse with hops away followed by rounded rich malt. It's 7.2 % ABV, you mean I can have only one? Aw, man.  Texture: As full as one could ask.  Overall: Someone is on their game here, the hop mixture used is beautifully balanced. The malt core is sufficient to counter the hops and the whole just works so well together. I thought the high hop level might be a bit off putting . . . I was wrong.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Harrison8,4.2,"Pours a hazy, murky deep orange. The white foamy head features tight bubbles, with strong retention. The glass is smothered in lacing after each sip. Minor notes of citrus, and pine hops. Smells rather quaint. Citrus and tropical hops make up an easy-going, but hoppy flavor profile. Mouth feel is border line DIPA territory, with plenty of body, and yet feels more like a thick, filling IPA. Overall, a fantastic brew that warrants any beer drinker's attention. Simplistic, and easy drink make this a beer for most any occasion.  Served in a 12oz snifter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I liked it well enough to order a 15.5 gal keg of it for my kegerator. It takes me about 6 months to finish a keg, so I guess it says something that I liked it well enough to drink it for the next 6 months.

Soapy, medium bodied texture, hoppy bitter twang endures, but not unpleasant.  Great price point for this high quality IPA - and excellent representative of the style. Not my cup of tea, but I recognize its merits and would recommend to those seeking a pine predominant IPA",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,KenSkyHopper,5,"Everything you have read about this beer is absolutely true. It is amazingly delicious. Pleasantly dry and hoppy, a little smokey, floral, umami. It's like drinking a fine liquid cigar. There are many higher priced ipas that would fall to their knees and pay homage to this benchmark of what an IPA should be. Beautiful sticky liquid lacing my glass maintaining a nice head and lingers on the tongue like the best morning cup of coffee. Robust, toasty, rich, not too heavy. This is the best beer I have ever had. Very drinkable...I can drink all six without palate fatigue. I love this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The taste has a solid and prominent hop bitterness, the caramel malts and again present and there isn't much in the way of hop flavor. Al the hop additions seem to have been very early in the boil. Decent mouthfeelwith a light-medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall this is a decent beer but I don't feel it fits what I would call the exceptionally broad category of American IPA.

As you might expect from an American / Imperial IPA, with every sip it leaves an obstinate ring of foam on the glass.  Aroma: Citrus and pine resin along with malt sweetness. Pretty standard for an APA.  Taste: Upfront piney hops melding into bitterness and a sweet malt backbone. Slight taste of booze in the background. Again, fairly standard for the style, but still well-rounded and enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with light carbonation and a lingering bitter / piney aftertaste. Very dry. Exactly what I look for in a good APA.  Overall: there are APAs I enjoy more (Bell's Two-Hearted especially comes to mind), but this is not offensive at all, and in fact is rather enjoyable.

Flavor follows much the same, though the malt backbone is overwhelmed through the course of 12oz, as the fairly bitter aftertaste builds and dominates. I really like this stuff for the first half of the glass, then the aftertaste wears on me.

Smells like a fresh mountain morning with pine and floral hops shining through. Seems to be some citrus smell far in the background.  Taste is very balanced for an ""Extra IPA"". The hops jump out front but are quickly backed by some very nice sweet malt characters.  Mouth feels fairly light but borders on medium in the back of the swallow. Very refreshing mouth feel in all.  I really have to say Sierra Nevada has a big winner on their hands with this one! A very tasty and refreshing balanced IPA with a whopping 7.2 ABV that does not show in the taste.

Someone below uses the term ""white grapefruit flesh"" and that is right on. Big bit bite of the grapefruit, nice malt wave, and pine on the finish.  I would venture to say if English bitter is not your taste, this beer may not be for you.  From what I can see, this should be SV's flagship beer.

140,30420,BrokenEdge,3.4,"Seems I wasn't as impressed as most other reviewers. Pours a clear amber with a white head that's fluffy but short lived. Lots of lacing. Smell is very piney, with some citrus notes. Taste is unbalanced, in my opinion. Very bitter without any other flavors coming through besides pine and sheer bitterness, just kind of a one note beer. Feel is medium with moderate carbonation, somehow feels a lot more boozy than I would expect for 7.2% ABV. Finishes very dry, with lingering bitterness. I guess if you're a major hop head, it's worth checking out, but I found it hard to enjoy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Poured medium to somewhat heavy.  S – Piney hops, with some mixed tropical fruit in the background. A fairly heavy bread crust, biscuit malt profile holds up the hops.  T – Pine, resin, a bit of grapefruit in there somewhere. Malt profile is very prominent, mostly bread crust.  M – A medium-full body thanks to the malts, with moderate carbonation only. Moderate hop bitterness though it escalates a bit on the finish.  O – Overall, a serviceable IPA, though I don’t know that it stands out much from the pack anymore.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jimboothdesigns,4.38,"Definitely outstanding. One of my favorite American IPAs. Just has taken me a while to rate it, so here it is. Pours a nice copper straw color with a nice bubbly and foamy head. Smell has a hint of malt but is dominated mostly by hops with some piney notes. Taste is similar. Malt, pine and hops.

Smells of citrus zest, sliced orange, stone fruit, reserved caramel malt and piney hops.  Tastes of white grapefruit flesh, bitter orange, peach cobbler, biscuity caramel malt and more pine resin.  Feels sturdy and refreshing. Medium-light bodied with firm carbonation. Finishes dry.  Verdict: Highly recommended.

140,30420,Czequershuus,3.74,"This beer pours a rich amber with a generous head. The aroma gives me sticky pine, a touch of tangerine, and pineapple.

140,30420,carolinahophead,4.44,"Always want to rate this very underrated beer from Sierra Nevada now brewed in NC (Mills River).  Nice Color ..lets say more orange than amber .. creamy head Aroma does have the west coast hop and mellow malt coming through, The taste is full of citrus then the toasted malt is there.

140,30420,That_Bearded_Guy,4.69,"Look: Dark amber color, pours a finger of head that dies down but never fully diminishes.  Smell: Bright hops with a solid punch of west coast pine and a slight sweetness.  Taste: Big hop presence on the front end followed again by a tight pine flavor. Transitions quickly into a heavy malt profile which balances the strong hops very well. The finish is of a prickly bitterness with a residual citrus note. That finishing taste lingers for quite a while and is excited nicely right back into the hops of the next sip.  Overall: This beer is a classic and admittedly has always been a go-to of mine. What separates this beer from a lot of the IPAs coming out now a days is the incredible balance of the beer. Each flavor from the hops on the front end, to the malt in the middle, and finishing with the bitterness on the backend is perfectly in balance with one another. Torpedo may not be the biggest hop bomb, citrus explosion IPA out there but it is a damn well balanced IPA, and for the price, cannot be beat. Make sure you check the date though and pick it up as fresh as you can. I have seen this beer on the shelf well past 5 months from the bottling date, almost guaranteeing that your buying a malt bomb. Fresh however, an amazing beer and a perfect example of a west coast IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Feel: Pleasant carbonation, medium bodied, slight alcohol noticeable around tongue and cheeks  Overall: This was one of my first IPA (Feral Hop Hog being the first) and it is probably the best imo.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,ACon204,4.64,"A: A vibrant and clear copper. Fluffy white head with decent retention.  S: Mostly floral aromas with hints of pine and grassy notes.  T: Hops are at the forefront. Slightly spicy in the beginning, moves to a malty sweetness, and finishes with a clean citrus bitterness with notes of pineapple, berry, and peaches (I assume from Citra hops).  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly light and refreshing, despite the darker than gold color. The crystal malts provide sweetness (balance) and darker color with little effect on the fullness of the body.  Overall: A pleasantly complex beer. The malt build and bittering hops balance the beer without getting in the way of the star of the show, the Citra hops. The finishing flavors of these hops will take minutes to fully develop. While they are in the process of developing, enjoy the show, as you will discover new flavors by the second.

I prefer citrusy/grapefruit ipa's first of all, and this beer is just too hop forward and not drinkable enough. Too bitter and actually makes me nauseous. Leaves a lingering terrible aftertaste. Headache type of buzz Ipa. This IPA would be a 5 star ipa 5 years ago but today it's terribly outdated and weak. Not a fan. Could just be my preference but I like refreshing, and this stuff is draining and tiresome. I could see why some people like this but for me it's old hoppy hat, longing for some refreshing hydrating citrus. Did I mention it gives me a stomach ache? Yeah this stuff kinda blows. And I love good IPAs. Oh well. Its tasty don't get me wrong, but just not my style at all. Every IPA lover should try this though, as it is unique.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,vladdswrath,4.36,"Pours a deep red amber with a solid two finger head that sticks like memory foam and laces beautifully as it sits. Aroma is slight. Pleasant, the usual citrus and pine, but you really have to dig in and snort it to find it. Taste is nice, hops forward, the bitterness leading with just the slightest amount of sweet malt in the background, which is a nice change of pace from the usual sweetness into bitterness schtick. Mouthfeel is fantastic, just enough texture to let you know it means business but not overly oily or syrupy.

Perfect, creamy, aromatic head that retains well and honestly just makes the beer look so good. I have an awful nose, so I'm not the best to ask on the subject of that but this beer had a lot of good smell to it. Citrus, pine, herbs. Taste is dreamy and perfect. Sweet but tart. Refreshing, but bitter. Fruit rind with just the right amount of spiciness. Floral and earthy notes, as well as citrus and even sort of... melon?? Then it hits hard with hoppy, herbal, bitterness that will make any hop head very happy. The dankness tones down into a subtle malty finish. This is a good beer for a flavor journey. mouthfeel is easy and pleasant. Perfectly drinkable. Very slight tingle of carbonation. Overall I loved this beer. Its 7.2% alcohol so I'm not planning to finish this sixer tonight, a couple have left me feeling good.

140,30420,1000lbgrizzly,4.45,"Orange body, prodigious carbonation, perfect clarity. The head deserves its own paragraph, but in a sentence, off-white, velvety, building itself into a mountain of smooth isohumulone alpha-acids and protein chains, dense, creamy, bitter, and utterly beautiful. The nose is intense with the bitterness of the usual orange peel, grapefruit, and pine notes, with some sweeter pineapple and apricot notes, faint malt. Taste favors the fruit, particularly grapefruit, but gives more reign to the bready caramel malt than the nose does, yet remains dry. Medium body, crisp carbonation. It's got plenty of diverse hop notes, just enough mature malt to balance it out, and the right refreshing body to tie it all together.

140,30420,HotDogBikeRide,4.24,"Poured from a bottle dated 9/15/2015, now almost four months later. Don't know if it is an accurate portrayal, but I digress. Poured into a small pint glass. The color is a beautiful amber gold, with some cool lacing dissipating quickly. A small ring of foam stays on top throughout drinking.  Smell is absolutely nice, but is Extremely faint. Lots of fruity, rad hops, but I would love if it was about 5x more robust. The taste is quite different from the smell, with a strong bitter component and piney, resinous compliments. Leaves a bitter taste that is not too unpleasant. Very drinkable, I could put back about 5, but satisfying enough in the belly to not need to.  I wish that it was a bit more liberal with the flavors, but what it does right is the refined balance I've come to expect from Sierra Nevada's hoppy selections. They all seem quite reserved from my albeit limited experience. I like really loud, citrusy IPA's I must admit. I can definitely see the appeal to these beers; strangely enough the '15 Celebration with it's lower alcohol content had me buzzing a tad more.  Would certainly love to give it a go on tap or perhaps with a more recently bottled batch. Maybe I am missing out, and these have sat on the shelf for a while, but I have tried one or two from the style that stand out more (this beer seems to get a lot of hype on here).

The head has great retention and lacing and is a great, creamy froth. The scent is a mild to moderate punch of hops, subtlely balanced with a touch of sweetness. When the beer hits the tongue, a mild burst of piney hops preside throughout most of the front half of the drink. The back half of the drink displays a bit of malt underneath the bitterness that balances the drink nicely. Mouthfeel is smooth and decently thick, but still light enough to drink it.

Smell: Has a Sierra Nevada malty aroma. Very malt forward on the nose. Taste: Malty sweet on the tip of the tongue and the malty sweetness mixes with hop bitterness but is not eclipsed by it until it hits the back of the tongue. The bitterness comes through like a reward that you have waited for. Flavor: Besides the expected pine citrus flavor there is a bit of black pepper, herbs and some spices I can’t quite identify. As it warms floral note become more perceptible. Current temp is 65 F. To me it comes alive between 60 and 65. (YMMV) The malty sweetness blends perfectly with the now classic hops (Magnum, Crystal and Citra). Lately I have been drinking a lot of beers that featured hops over malt. This is one BALANCED beer! Feel: Feels full, carbonation is light. Kind of a slick mouthfeel, not in a bad way. Overall: Awesome beer. I have bought it many times but have not yet reviewed it. This is delicious.

Full disclosure: I am not an IPA aficionado, I'm more of a porter or stout kinda guy. But in wanting to give SN another try I decided to give this Torpedo a shot. I'm glad I did. It has a very nice orange glow with thick head and great lacing down the glass. The citrus aroma mixes well with the hops and it does even better when you taste it. It is a perfect mix of a fruity and citrusy flavor mixed with the strong hops - how they do it is amazing, but it's there nonetheless.

Beer is clear and well carbonation with lots of bubbles rising quickly towards the surface. Beer is amber in color. 4.25/5  S - Pine and a citrus fruitness dominate the aroma with a bit of caramel sweetness showcasing the malt. Citrus is more citrus fruit than rind. 4/5  T - Caramel malt comes out right off the bat and then transitions to multiple flavors of hops. Light citrus (tangerines), pine, citrus rind, and some herbal hops all present themselves throughout and in quick succession once the malt flavor is passed up. Lingering bitterness upon swallowing due to the amount of hops present. 4.25/5  M - Moderate to high carbonation with a moderate carbonation burn throughout the profile. Light and very crips with some drying on the back end and a decent amount of lingering dryness. 4/5  O - The amount of hops used in this beer is not surprising but the amount of different hop flavors is a welcome sight.

L: Pours a rich caramelly orange amber color with a 3 finger cream head of bubbles that blend into one another until they float to the top to rupture leaving little craters of tiny bubbles, beautiful. The only thing it could do to look better would be to be a pitch black stout.  S: A soft fresh rising dough smell covers over sharp pine and ruby red grapefruit with some candied orange and pine in the background, lovely.  T: That fresh bread flavor is prominent, and so is the bitter, tangy hops. Very nice balance between the two. Tons of great malt character; much more than usual in an IPA, and I like it. A hint of fruity sweetness and just a hint of roastiness, like thick cut bread out of a toaster on low heat.  F: Exactly like an IPA should feel. Smooth, frothy, dry on the finish, nice thickness for an IPA too. The bubbles linger in your mouth, keeping that sweet, bitter twinge present. It isn't a bad thing.

Overall this is a unique and great tasting IPA. Hoppy, but not too bitter. It has the right amount of sweetness and fruit notes to balance everything out. Very well crafted, and boasting with flavor.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,matcris,4.42,"LOOKS: Poured into a Nonic pint glass aggressively. Two inch, creamy tan head. Small bubbles streaming up glass. Beautiful thick lacing down glass. AROMA: Not a crazy amount of hop aroma, but the pine and grapefruit come through nicely. I do get the herbal quality along with it. TASTE: Big Pine and grapefruit rind up front. Nice balance between bitterness and sweetness, lingering but mild bitterness. You get some sweet malt, so it is not just hop water. MOUTHFEEL: Not under carbonated, nor over carbonated... Perfect. Medium body. 7.2 abv and easy to chug....careful. Easy to get, and easy to like. If you love those pine and grapefruit qualities with some nice balance from the sweet malts, you'll probably dig this one. Edit: Bumping this one up a little, bottled on 12/17/15 drinking on 1/15/16. This beer is so readily available to most people, there is no reason to buy it with almost any age on it. And when it's fresh, it really is a good IPA.

140,30420,Back_in_the_Saddle,4.24,"This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within a good pace. Light stringy lacing clings to the sides and eventually slides into the beer. The smell, reminds me of their regular APA, but the spice hits just a bit harder with the bitter pine even bursting forth heavier than the caramel base malts. The taste copies the aroma nicely proving that the caramel malts slides even further into the background. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a nice sessionable feel about it. Bitter pine bursts in the harshness hitting my tongue appropriately as an AIPA. Overall, when one isn't re-inventing the wheel, and looking at this beer as it is and what it was before the beer snobs got here, you know this is the standard.

And for the life of me, I own a tulip, but I have never poured this beer into a tulip. According to Beer Advocate, we're supposed to put these in pint glasses, nonic glasses or mugs or steins. End rant, whatever, to each his own, right, here's the rest. Tonight, this is from a pint glass. The appearance was a gentle hazy burnt orange color with a sly transparency about it. Carbonation could be seen rising at a nice pace to glide into a one finger white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Lacing was moderately string and thin. The smell takes some citrus fruit to grind into a delicate spice with floral, herbal and piney hops to bounce into a delicate malt backbone. The taste was fully bittersweet blended into the spicy component and offering a crisp sweet to spicy aftertaste and a nice enduring bittersweet finish. The mouthfeel was about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonation runs right as an AIPA should. Spice clings to my tongue in a harsh way along with the bitterness. Overall, for those that have taken a charge against Sierra Nevada in picking on the fact that they distribute everywhere, why is that bad if this beer is so good?

Head retention is quite good.  Smell: Tart fruity smell from large amounts of aroma hops. Rich malt also comes through the nose.  Taste: There is a decent hop bittering bite at first, but not as strong as I expected. Sweet malty flavors come through quickly. There are fruit flavors that blend together (orange, citrus, pineapple, mango). The sweet malt and fruit fade and then the bitter hoppiness comes back and fades to a dry finish.

The beer has a burnt orange-light brown appearance with good head retention (started out with a big head but dissipated) and patchy lacing on the sides. Really absorbing aromas of fresh, grassy hops mixed with spiced bread and ripe citrus fruits.

The grain load feels light, the IBU's feel very light and the hops don't have much bite, the yeast is clean but underpitched.  I taste cane or corn sugar the most in the flavor profile, and that makes sense, considering the $3.99 price point. Majority of fermentables are cheap adjunct ingredients. On level with those crappy Sam Adams attempts at IPA's.  You get what you pay for.  I would have purchased Hop Hunter instead but it was bottled 6 months prior.

You can find Torpedo in hella places, from a Bodega in Brooklyn to upscale supermarkets to (odds are) wherever you happen to live. And it isn't expensive. My first take on this was that the smell, look, and feel were interesting, but it tasted like drinking pine tree juice. However, now that I've become much more accustomed to drinking IPAs, I think it's balanced: it tastes citrusy and floral (like a pine tree), but in a tasty way. It ends a bit bitter, but not overly so. This beer is proof that good things don't necessarily have to come with a 20 dollar price tag or overly hopped.

140,30420,Wer34truh,4.23,"Dark amber color with quite subtle visible carbonation. Relatively large head. Retains well.  Has a distinct sweetness to its otherwise very hoppy smell. Notes of malt and pine.  Not at all as big of a hop-sensation as I thought, with the hops taking a split second before making an appearance. The distinct sweetness of the smell makes its appearance in the aftertaste which stays for a delightfully long amount of time.  Additionally, this is an incredibly smooth beer. So much so that the beer it reminds me the most of that I've had recently is Lagunitas Imperial Pils.  I can't think of a beer that is more price-worthy than this.

140,30420,breadwinner,4.33,"Total classic, and I kinda love that the taste is ""classic IPA"" in nature -- oodles of piney bitterness in this one. Some caramel sweetness as well that pokes through, but the story here is that piney bitterness that sits on the back of your tongue well through the last gulp. Nose is nice, pine, caramel, some faint citrus and a light herbal/earthy character. It's a funny thing -- I may not score something like this quite as high as some of my other favorite IPAs, but I also view it as a sort of beer equivalent of comfort food, the sort of thing I want to reach for more often than some of those higher scored brews. I suppose that might suggest a higher score here. I'll have to chew on that.

140,30420,Strat58cat,4.06,"Can you drink a meadow? Can you drink a pine tree? Maybe not, but you can drink Torpedo. The aroma is matched by a fresh flavor. None of the fruity esters run wild here. It's pure mountain ale, if such a thing could exist. This ale is like what Coors claimed to be.  The color is a medium-amber. The head suds up well and retains, lacing to the bottom of the glass.  The smell is a strong point. A strong execution of dry-hopping makes itself known in an aroma that contains a hint of mountain pine forest. It's an aroma that is fully consistent with the Sierra Nevada theme of mountain beer. If you could brew in a piney forest, from a piney forest, it seems like this aroma is what you would get. It doesn't fade out or dissipate while you're enjoying it (I'm looking at you admittedly subtle Total Domination). It doesn't make your eyes water with excess and require decanting like a fine wine (I'm looking at you Rebel). Open, pour and drink.  The taste is totally consistent with the aroma. It's not harsh at all. It's a refreshing ale that seems to revel in its aesthetic. There's no bland toast feeling here, as with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It's loaded with citric flavor. While the IBU is elevated, it's fully supported by the experience and seems appropriate. As with several powerhouse IPAs, eating cheese or another such dish with the ale can amp the experience up to 11 and avoid experiencing too much bitterness.  The feel is solid. It's appropriate. It doesn't feel watery at all. Nor is it heavy. Really, I was too busy enjoying my metaphorical hike through the mountains to notice the feel at all, even while trying. That tells me it is consistent and right for the ale.  Sierra Nevada has an aim - an ultimate aesthetic. They never have stopped trying in all these years to capture it more fully. It's right there in the graphics on the bottle. It's what all that Coors advertising was going on about (shamelessly, since Coors is swill). Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is just a rough draft, although it does have a remarkable note of mountain freshness in the finish. In Torpedo, that single remarkable note in Pale Ale is more fully realized.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JohnL9013,3.59,"An exceptionally strong-flavored IPA that bears a striking resemblance to Stone's Arrogant Bastard in terms of its bitter, roasted malt backbone. I do like this IPA, but it is not a sessionable beer in the slightest.  A: Great dark amber color with a medium sized head with small bubbles. Hazy.  S: Medium hop presence with a sweet malt aroma.  T: The bitterness is refreshing at first when many brewers these days are malting the heck out of their IPA's to make them tolerable for people who don't like bitterness, but it will wear you down by the end. Aroma hops are a little lacking but flavor hops are reasonably present. Bittering hops are almost spot-on - just a little less would be about right. I like the roasted malts - they add a lot of complexity.  M: Highly carbonated and on the bitter side, this beer does not go down especially smoothly.  Overall I just don't think this is a beer I'll pick up again. It's really kickass for the first 100 mL or so, but the bitterness just wears you down after a while and gets in the way of tasting everything else in this beer.

S: This is, IMO, where this beer is incredible. The smell is so delicious I could spend the days just smelling it. The first impression is just freshness. Piney hops, and citrus (grapefruit or lemon). After some sniffs, I could detect some rose or caramel. T: Even though the taste is a bomb of bitterness, this beer tricks you at the beginning. First, I started tasting the grapefruit and pine I smelled, along with some grass, and very subtle malty/bready notes. Then the bitterness kicks in. And it does it so it takes over anything else. This feeling keeps going on even in the aftertaste. To me, this amount of bitterness blew my mind. However, after few sips, I got used to the bitterness and could appreciate more notes I could detect with the smell before. F: The feeling is, of course, bitter. Except for the first milliseconds, the bitterness is there. Medium carbonation, but a nice feeling. The taste evolves as you drink more and more. The beer is quite heavy, and I could feel the alcohol when I was finishing it. O: Very nice experience.

140,30420,CDTDubstep,3.96,Tastes like cat piss. Hoping this is just a bad bottle.  Edit : not sure what was up with the first time I had this. It's actually grown on me now that I'm at the end of the 12 pack. There is still definitely a cat piss flavor going on here that is absurdly growing on me.  Some Starburst like fruit flavors with some light biscuit bready tinge. The hops are not as strong as I was expecting but they are very pleasant. Mouthfeel is excellent and the abv is on point. Very drinkable.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Cure_Tap,4.25,"A swirl of pine, flowers, and citrus. Surprise appearance by some sweet malt here as well, which easily could have been drowned out by the hop bomb. It's not a ton of malt, but it is there, and gives this some nice balance. I get sort of a pleasantly bitter grapefruit aftertaste here. Definitely more bitter tasting in the aftertaste, because this goes down very smoothly. It's 7.2% ABV, but you'd never know it unless you looked at the can or drank too many in one sitting. An excellent IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: Citrus right up front, to be honest it reminded me a little of the musty sweetness synonymous with white wine, other notes of toasted bread, slight pine  T-Again, for me it's all citrus with a little bit of tropical fruit, I'm also getting some bubblegum, finishes dry and just bitter enough with a slight malty backing  F-Excellent carbonation, very drinkable, could maybe be a little heavier for my taste, but that's just preference  O-A great, classic IPA. The balance and restraint used by Sierra Nevada really makes this a standout beer. In a game where so many breweries are trying to blow your tastebuds off with hops, it's refreshing to find a beer that manages to emphasize the punch of the hops all while incorporating the right level of malty sweetness and fruity esters/citrus. Drinks easy and refreshing-a homerun for Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

On the nose, right up front with the classic pine aroma, followed up with a nice grapefruit , not detecting much else, maybe a slight hint of clove.

S: Grapefruit, citrus, pineapple, pine, tropical fruits, sweet malts, caramel, and herbal hops.  T: Sweet malts, citrus, grapefruit, caramel, pine, tropical fruits, and resiny earthy hops.

Would definitely recommend.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DabblinWiscCraft,4.32,"Picked up a six-pack at my local Stein's Liquor. The bottled on dates states that it's two months old. Poured right from the fridge into a perfect pint glass.  L: Pours a rich amber with about an inch of eggshell head that sticks around for a long time and leaves very nice lacing on the glass. Crystal-clear, with moderate visible carbonation.  S: Pine and grapefruit hop notes and caramel malt in the nose, though they are not particularly assertive. Just a bit of pineapple/tropical fruit in the mix. There's more malt coming through than I was expecting--this is a pretty complex bouquet.  T: Somewhat sweet caramel malt at the outset, but there's a tartness from the hops that kicks in almost immediately. The pine and grapefruit rind hop notes begin at the front and build throughout the taste. The middle is characterized by the pine and citrus hop flavor, though the malt underside is still assertive. There's also a bit more of that pineapple and tropical fruit coming through. There's a bit of earthiness in the mix, as well. The back end has more of the pine hops, more tart than outright bitter and still a nice malt presence to keep things from being overly bitter--there's actually a bit of sweet fruitiness to the close. This has a very well-balanced flavor.  F: Spot-on for this style: Medium bodied, creamy in the middle but still with plenty of brightness on the palate. Very nicely-carbonated, fairly clean-finishing, but leaving you with just enough stick and bitter.  O: This beer is probably my standard--along with Bell's Two Hearted--by which to measure all other American IPAs. This one does everything right, from the look, to the taste, to the feel. I do wish that the bouquet was a little more assertive, but it's hard to complain about a beer that drinks this well. I highly recommend.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Hellvira355,4.79,"This beer. What can I say about this beautifully forged creation of the Norse God Ullr... well for starters it's basically a bottled version of what an orgasm feels like. The bright bronze glow that emits from a glass of this liquid ecstasy is reminiscent of the victorious glowing halls of Valhalla. The cathedral-like web of the head brings a feeling of distinct victory to any who attempt to consume such a piece of art. When one attempts to put their nose to such a prestigious pour, he buckles at the knees and bows in sheer fear it will offend this triumphant nasal display of pine and hoppy-love. If you haven't passed out by way of ecstatic cardiac arrest by this point, you're in for a pleasant surprise when the cold, sexy, nectar pours down your tonge like an Icelandic waterfall.. in which you will reach Shangri-La because now you've reached enlightenment and are no longer a Norse Warrior, but a spirit who's reached taste bud Nirvana.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Scents of grapefruity citrus and damp pine needles grow more complex on the palate as tropical and herbal flavors emerge. Smooth and creamy—perfectly carbonated for a 7.2% beer. Some alcohol harshness mars the finish for me. But who cares after a sip or two?  This was one of the first Citra-hopped beers I tasted, back in 2007.

Amber in color. Mild bubbles. Has an amazing balance of citrus, floral, pine, and malt aromas with none of them overtaking the other in strength. Initial taste is strong with floral flavors that combine with mild malt flavors. Strong pine flavors and mild citrus flavors enter shortly after as the intial floral and malt flavors persist to create an explosive symphony of deliciousness. Medium-bodied with a crisp finish that leaves the mouth dry. Sierra Nevada has once again created a work of art.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Related to the aroma, the taste is fairly sweet and mild; not too bitter. A blend of various fruity flavors are vaguely present, accompanied by a pleasant sweet malt flavor finishing up with a peppery and spiced taste. Vague sweet aftertaste present.  M - Incredible feeling beer. Very smooth, creamy and drinkable. Medium bodied and average to little carbonation. Semi-dry aftertaste though really not that present.  O - An amazing beer brought to you by SN that wow'd me. Very drinkable and incredible mouth-feel.

Very nice! Very clean bitter hop taste with a nice kick of the citrus in the end. A honey-lemon pokes through. Crisp and balanced taste with enough bitter hanging around to make it great.

140,30420,E-McFarden,4.03,"Crystal clear amber with a moderately poised creamy off-white head. Lacing is moderate to high. Initially I get caramel malts scents intermingled with piney aroma hops and dark fruit scents. This one rushes at your palate with substantial bittering hops from start to finish. Caramel malts peak through from time to time on the taste, but the bittering hops dominate. Mouthfeel is moderate, not too heavy on the palate and a good amount of carbonation. Overall a good brew, staying true to the American IPA style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hoptheology,4.11,"I heard this was good.  Appearance : Colossal off-white-to-almost-grey cap, 3 fingers tall, staying pretty steady at this point (about 2 minutes since the pour). Where it has receded, it leaves its mark like a serial killer or hieroglyphic to show where it once was. The body is iced tea colored - hazy is the word, reminds me of Evans short-lived Hazy drum heads line. 90% opaque from here.  Aroma : Peach pit and flesh - in that order, tropical melon rind, cantaloupe, and upon deep inhalation some dirt and faint armpit/urine going on but not too strongly. Grapefruit can be nosed as well. Largely a fruity and tropical IPA aroma. Points!  Taste : Now granted, I am not a fan of IPA's (although my fridge has at least 12 different kinds - one of each for review), but this one is damn respectable. Right off the cuff it's not too strong; it gives you a second to take a breath through your nose, and then once you're ready, it hits you with strong dark fruits - plum, raisin...and also light honeydew, melon, elderberry. The hop character is slightly dirty, but sharp and cutting at the same time. On the wide stereo of your mouth it ends light, crisp and fruity, and towards the center of your tongue it's dirty and bitter - almost trashy but not bad - in the finish.  Mouthfeel : Super sharp and stabbing carbonation, like fireants in your mouth. That quickly subsides to a melting creaminess that coats the palate and slides down like foam. Nicely done, SN.  Overall : Again, not a fan of IPA's. But this one is pretty awesome.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,brianwsnyder,4.7,"It's kind of halfway between regular IPAs and double IPAs. Very good! This is definitely a go-to beer for me now. Good price, too: $9.99 for a six at Wegmans.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,MUTINY,3.89,"12oz bottle into a solo cup.  A: Clear, bright-gold with about 1 1/2"" of pillowy off-white head that recedes nice & slow. Retention is good, lacing is just great.  S: Not getting much aroma here. Some piney, resinous hop notes. A little graham-cracker malt, faint spiciness. I'll say that the hop-character on the nose is enticing, though.  T: Oily hoppage. Brilliantly bitter throughout, balanced just right by some semi-burly crackery malt. Just a touch floral. There's a bit of grapefruit present, but this palate doesn't really read to me as fruity. Finishes bitter with a trace of pepper & lemongrass.  M: Ideally suited to this flavor profile. On the heavy side of medium-bodied with solid carb & a slickness all around. Very drinkable, maybe too much so.  O: This has been & remains a classic.

140,30420,911CROFT,3,"350ml bottle into a conical 2/3 pint glass. Paid £2.00 for a single bottle.  Pours a semi opaque, shiny dark orange/ copper body with lovely reddish pink tinges that show through when held to the light. A thin off white head made of large soapy bubbles quickly forms to two fingers in height and later condenses to a thicker foam upon a short rest. It leaves excellent lacing all the way down the glass, even towards the bottom when the head has been reduced to a thin white cap.  Powerful citrusy hops dominate the nose. Grapefruit is the main scent but also noticeable are marmalade, pine and floral notes. It has a medium bodied feel with a very slight oily consistency. Small bubbles rise quickly from the bottom of the glass to give a lively carbonation that playfully foams up with a light swill around the mouth. The initial taste hints at a slightly sweet, fruity malt that doesn’t last long enough before handing over to more dominant dry bitter hops. Pine and citrus fruit pith are the main overriding flavours after this point. To my tastes, once these have kicked in, they are all that is left. The finish is a little too bitter, it has a slight astringency but not so much that it leaves the palate dry, in fact it is quite crisp and refreshing. At 7.2% the alcohol is well hidden, perhaps it was just masked by the bitterness but my bottle went down quite easily.  Overall I found the further I got down the glass, the more I liked the beer. I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it had a stronger malt backbone, or if the hops came in a little later. I will probably look to revisit this one in the future if I develop a greater taste for more hop forward or bitter styles.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

M: Medium-bodied, not extremely carbonated  O: Loved this beer even though I am not an avid IPA drinker. With an IBU of 65, it was a great level of bitterness that accented a great flavored beer.

There is also a nice off white head to this IPA. The smell is rich with flavors, you pick up on hops, grains, and toasted malts. Now for the taste is bold with mild bitter flavors. You pick up on the hops in this brew. There is a lot going on in Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA, it has a nice balance to it. There is nothing overpowering about this brew. The mouth feel is bold rich and full bodied. I like how the hops are there , but they do not overpower the brew. Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., did a nice job with this one.

140,30420,ARoman,4.68,"12oz bottle poured into an IPA glass. The initial aroma is a bright evergreen forest that quickly ducks to a fresh cut grass, which in turn, fades and is replaced by bright peaches and grapefruit and pine with a hint of fresh baked, crusty bread sneaking in underneath. Near the end there's a warm, sweet honey and caramel note that starts to dominate. It pours a brilliant, shimmering orange with effervescence, and just a slight haze. The head is a dense soap / gelatin texture with an egg white hue that leaves a dense, heavy lace, and has great retention. The taste is a medium high bitter and sweet; well balanced. The texture is a slick, waxy quality with a soft fuzz and a medium full body. Flavors of juicy bittersweet citrus and waxy pine are first noted with caramel and honey pushing through as it warms. It finishes dry with a zip of pine and waxy grapefruit membrane. It's zesty and potent, but not offensive, long, and astringent with an aftertaste that'ss clean, chalky and dry.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

There are soapy webs of lacing left all over the glass.  The smell is dank and resinous pine, citrus pith, herbal, toasted bready malts and a hint of caramel.  Taste is very similar, but there is additional depth. I honestly can't put my finger on what makes it seem that way, but maybe it is because the malts come through a bit more clean in the taste. There is plenty of bready and sweet caramel malts apparent, but they still manage to take a back seat allowing the hops to shine.  Feel is medium to full bodied, resinous and well carbonated. Sometimes this beer can come across slightly syrupy, but I enjoy the fuller mouthfeel.  Overall a great beer. One of the classics.

Taste is citrus-tart throughout, strongest up front, moving on to piney, resiny, and vegetal with malt character coming through.

140,30420,maedhros09,4.12,"Look: Golden amber with huge lingering fluffy head Smell: Big grapefuit-like citrus notes and some floral soapy notes. Taste: lightly sweet maltiness but mostly dry bitter resiny soapy citrus hops. Alcohol flavor is noticeable. Feel: light to medium body with medium carbonation.  Overall: It had been a while since I last had the Torpedo. I was hoping I might come back to it with a more positive opinion, as happened with Bell's Two Hearted (now a favorite), but I think my impression remains mostly unchanged. First the positive - it looks great, smells delicious and I like the fairly dry maltiness (too many oversweet IPAs out there). However the flavors associated with the hops just don't get me very excited, particularly the soapiness. Also, it has a pretty high ABV, which to me should imply more depth of flavor. In any case, I find the Torpedo enjoyable - it just doesn't live up to the hype in my view. I will say, however, that the Celebration Ale remains one of my very favorite beers.  Update 4/26/2015 - A subsequent tasting led me to soften my view of the Torpedo. For whatever reason the things that didn’t sit right with me the first time didn’t stand out as much this time. It seemed a bit maltier this time as well.

Look: Looks like an IPA should: classic deep amber color, slightly off-white head, and ample carbonation to sustain the hearty head. Absolutely beautiful in the glass, especially when the sun shines through it leaving rays of dancing amber light like flames on the table.  Smell: Full on aromatic hops with pine, stone fruits, mango, and caramel malts. As timeless as it is inviting.  Taste/Feel: The bitterness is piney and pleasantly lingering. The malt provides a solid balance standing up to the sharp swath of hop goodness that washes across the tongue. Hops are pine, grapefruit pith, kumquat, apricot, pineapple, and resinous dankness. Malts are caramel, biscuit, and cracker. The lingering bitterness is pleasant and reassuring. All of the components are in harmony.

Torpedo has a nice two centimeters or so of off-white foam for a head and a vibrant, deep sunset orange color.  It smells of fresh bread, honey, sweet lemon and orange, and herbal pine.  The flavor is a beautifully balanced ride, starting with tangy citrus, moving to sweet white bread and marmalade, and ending with a fairly dry finish of biscuity malts, citrus rind, and resinous pine. Lingering dank and bitter hops tease my palate for another sip.  I'm fond of the feel. Pretty well-carbonated but not too prickly, and ever so slightly sticky.  Kind of a classic IPA.

Aroma: good citrus and pine aroma overall but not nearly as intense as expected given this is an extra IPA with unique dry hopping technique provided by the Torpedo and the fact that whole cones are used. To that extent is was a bit disappointing compared to plenty of Aussie IPAs I have tested. Perhaps I had a batch close to expiry or not so fresh and some aroma freshness has gone. Flavour: some citrus notes on the front palate and good strong hop bitterness on the finish. Enjoying the extra bite with higher alcohol content. Mouthfeel was very good with smooth and slightly creamy finish.

There is about one and one-half fingers of very-off-white eggshell colored foam. The head is dense and pillowy with nice lacing and good retention.  S-The aroma is sharp with notes of pine, mint, toast, and a buttery sweetness that exposes this beers age but -- unlike most IPAs -- does not detract from the beer's aroma.  T-The taste is similar. It has that recognizable Sierra Nevada yeast/malt profile with some pine, a little bit of grapefruit, mint, buttered toast, and just the slightest hint of tropical fruit.  M-The feel is medium in body with a bit of oil and hop grit. Very drinkable.  O-This is a great beer.

140,30420,Pantalones,4.13,"Re-reviewing this one now that I have a significantly fresher (~1.5 months vs. 5 months) bottle than the last time.  Appearance is just like before, of course -- pours dark golden/amber, settles into a mostly clear (very slight haziness noticeable with a flashlight) dark coppery-orange once in the glass, with a pretty huge layer of off-white foam on top and lots of little rising bubbles. The foam gradually recedes, but seems like it's going to stick around for quite a while.  Noticed a fruity thing to the smell right away, much more so than in the older bottles I'd had before. In my old review I described a little bit of ""very ripe orange"" smell but I can't really pin the fruitiness down to a specific fruit here; leaning in the sweetish citrus direction though so maybe orange works. I'm not picking up as much in the smell today as expected, but since I woke up with a bit of a sniffly nose my sense of smell might just be a little off so I'll just leave my smell score from the previous review.  The taste is similar to before, with lots of leafy/herbal bitter flavors from the hops and a bread-crust background malt flavor mixed in, a little bit of pineyness here and there. There's a nice bit of a fruitiness similar to the smell when I first start to take a drink, which definitely adds something to the beer when comparing it to the not-so-fresh version -- seems like the fruity flavors are the first ones to fade while the other hop flavors hold up for a lot longer. Interestingly, I found that the malt flavors stood out *more* in the last fresh bottle I had (compared to the not-so-fresh one I had years ago), but that may just be me getting more used to high-IBU beers and being able to identify the malty flavors in the background over the much ""louder"" hops. Aftertaste is a blend of leafy bitterness and toasty/bread-crust malt flavor. Burps are leaning in the fruity direction I'm noticing.  As said in the previous review, mouthfeel of this beer is really nice -- has that ""lots of carbonation, but it feels soft and bubbly rather than prickly"" thing that I tend to like in most beers, and which Sierra Nevada in particular tends to be very good at. It's amazingly drinkable for something over 7% ABV and 60 IBUs, but still feels pretty hefty so you don't end up wanting to drain half the glass in one go. It basically comes across as sort of a midpoint between a standard and double IPA in that regard. And despite the sweetish orange/fruity flavor that pops up at the beginning, this is a very dry beer -- which is not surprising for the amount of hops that must have gone into making it.  Overall, I have to say I'm glad I grabbed this six-pack and re-reviewed -- I like fresh Torpedo even more than I like 5-month-old Torpedo. I'm still surprised at just how well it held up with several months on it, now that I've been able to compare fresh to the not-so-fresh bottles I had the first time around -- although it's certainly BETTER at only a month or so of age, the ""IPAs are no good after 2 months"" claim does not apply to this one, the leafy/herbal bitter hop flavors are very much present at nearly half a year of age even though the fruitiness mostly fades away by that point. This is still one of my favorite IPAs, and if I ever stumble across a six-pack that's less than a month old I'll have to try that and see if I notice any difference from my current six-pack at the month-and-a-half mark.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,zfw,4.39,"This is my go-to IPA.

KBS, Pliny, etc. This, to me, is the best beer in the world. This has the hops that every IPA strives for. More importantly you don't have to pay 22.99 for a 4 pack if you're lucky to get there at the right time. You don't have to show up on a Tuesday morning and whisper ""george the animal steel likes butterscotch crumpets"". This beer is $7.99 a sixer at Wegmans.

140,30420,Gajo74,4.02,"Look- Massive foamy head. Clear reddish/Amber. Excellent sticky lace retention. Smell- Sweetness from the citrus. There is also a perfumy and floral tone. Taste- Mostly hops forward and rather intense at times. The bitterness is medium to high; the piny hops predominate. Floral, soapy, herbal and tobacco like. However, as he drink warms, some of the citrus/grapefruit fruitiness comes out. Very subdued bready malt backbone, however, this one is mostly about the hops. Feel- Medium bodied, smooth and drinkable. The palate is mostly dry. The alcohol is practically untraceable. Overall- Hoppy, dry and bitter, but with a light citrus sweetness that prevents it from overwhelming the palate. If you are a hops head, this one is pretty good.

140,30420,mdexter,4.68,"It's among my favorite of the high-hop-content American IPAs at 65 IBUs with some unique ingredients and inventive hopping techniques. It pours a deep amber with soapy head and resilient lacing. The aroma is that familiar hallmark of American West Coast IPAs: fresh Magnum bittering hops with their pungent citrus, juniper, and grassy notes and typical floral charm. Take a sip and the smokey-sweet malt coats your mouth while the Citra hops - the sour diesel of hops - settle on your breath for the long haul. The balance is perfect.

This beer would be worth it at 2-3$ more a six pack - it just happens to be cheap, available and wonderful. With that caveat out of the way, into the review.  L- Poured into a weiss glass (not sure why) poured from a 16oz can. Poured clear and copper with a big, fluffy off-white head. It really is a good looking beer. Darker than many west coast IPA's. S- Pine and citrus steals the show with a subtle sweetness. T- mmmm - big pine and citrus flavor (dry hopped with citra). Super balanced and not too bitter but still allows for HUGE hope flavors which is what I think makes a great IPA, all the things that we love about hops without the palate wrecking bitterness. F- Medium bodied, pretty sticky for an IPA (boarding on DIPA) carbonation is really good.

Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, pineapple, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, pineapple, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange peel, pineapple, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Outstanding complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish.

140,30420,hopphead31415,4.5,"This is an updated review. I had reviewed this before, but got a fresh batch in a four pack of pint cans and I must say that there is a noticeable difference. This beer has a cool 7.2% ABV which is sort of the sweet spot for this variety even though I generally prefer a more stout content like 8.4% as you would see in like a Rebel Rouser by Sam Adams. The carbonation is perfect and pours a thick head that lingers, but can get rather thick if you pour it properly. Chill this beer down to near freezing and you will find it difficult to coax that silky thick head out of it.  A-This beer pours a cloudy dark golden brown that glimmers a golden hue in the right light. The active and plentiful carbonation bubbles tickle the lips and make for a large head if poured correctly. The lacing is slightly drooping, strong, and white like the head.  S-The aroma of this beer is more floral and full of dank citrus hops than anything I have smelled before—except for some imperial IPAs like Rampant. I think that this prepares the palate to receive this highly drinkable beer. If you do the Belgian dip properly then you will have a nose full of the true essences of this beer as you drink it.  T-The malty flavors and character of this beer are exhibited by a toasty nutty cracker that is perfectly balanced by the alcohol content and a punctuated hoppiness. This beer has a lingering grassy herbal taste that melts into waves of cascading citrus like mango and apricot.  M-The mouthfeel is smooth and very quickly gives way to the zingy qualities that come with the carbonation and then you get the bite of the hops. If you inhale through your nose simultaneously you will pick up more floral content at the end of your sip.  O-Overall I would say that this beer is all that I had hoped it would be. I was worried that it might not have the right complexity of flavors when I bought it, because most reviews focused on the hops and couldn’t precisely describe the background flavors and complex aromas. I was pleasantly surprised and I think you will be also. Be sure to find a very fresh pack of cans and I think you’ll love it as much as I do.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JohnnyI,4.53,"Holy carbonation batman!! This one had me slurping the top of the IPA glass to prevent a waterfall of suds. What a pretty looking beer though. The chilled auburn appearance is graced with a massive cream colored crown of epic proportions. So fluffy and rich, like a giant dollop of whipped cream. Incredible lacing remains as the head recedes. As if it were perfectly etched in to the glass itself. This is easily one of the most picturesque beers I've ever seen. The aroma is a big, bold bouquet of hops. Complex and aromatic. Perfume-like. Elements of grapefruit citrus, lemon zest and spicy floral scents dominate. Malty bread notes punch through a little too. So fresh and vibrant! The taste brings a delicious blend of caramel sweetness and puckering hop bitterness. Amazingly, the malts hold their own here, striking a very improbable balance. Wow, simply delectable. It's quite a feat to pack in so much complex hop character and still have the backbone to bring it full circle. The mouthfeel is smooth, robust and full. Juicy, yet creamy and soft. An incredibly rich texture. To me, this beer stands tall on the sheer impact of the whole cone hop potency and remarkably sturdy malt base. The feat of balance is commendable, given the mega-hopped nature of the brew. It is certainly worthy of the name ""Torpedo"" because it is an unmistakable West Coast hop bomb. However, the stealth and sturdiness of the malts are equally fitting for this explosive namesake. World class all the way.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jadpsu,4.48,"LOOK:Pours bright, clear copper with a slightly off white creamy head with excellent retention as well as sticky side glass lacing. AROMA: Hops, and more hops.

Still subtly sweet. It coats the tongue nicely and lingers. This it the right amount of hopness, solid bitter; bready sweet combines for a true IPA treat.  Mouth is slightly creamy thats the slightest watered (just a little so you are not chewy, its not bad). Bubbly carb, definitely from yeast which is nice.  Along with Alaska Brewing Co.

Smell: Floral, a little sweet, some grapefruit, some biscuity malts. Pretty mellow overall.  Taste: The hops have actually held up pretty well.

Beautiful, almost clear copper color. Bright piney fragrance gives you that hint as to what is to come with the 1st sip. Mouthfeel matches what the rest of the beer is - balanced perfection.

140,30420,interzen,3.8,"350ml bottle served in a tulip glass  Look: Quite a dark amber, almost brown - quite clear. Couple of fingers of off-white head which diminished in good time. Some lacing.  Smell: Has that lovely, pine-resin aroma that heavily hopped beers tend to have. Fairly overpowering though - swirl it around a bit and you'll get some citrus fruity notes (lemon, grapefruit etc.)  Taste: It'd be nice to say that some of the fruity notes come through in the taste, but they don't. It's hops, pure and simple. All other things considered, it's actually pretty one-dimensional. There's almost no evidence of malt whatsoever.  Feel: Not too bad - it's crisp, clean and there's not much in the way of carbonation Fairly dry and astringent finish.  Overall: I'm trying to get excited about this but it's not doing anything for me - I get that American IPAs tend to be hopped to death and, slowly but surely, my palate is getting acclimatised to them but with this it feels like the hops are trampling over any other more subtle flavours that might be present. May be worth revisiting at a later time once I've got a few more IPAs under my belt.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,JLaw55,4,"A very hoppy IPA option. I usually prefer IPA's and DIPA's to be well balanced or leaning more toward the malt side. This one is on the other end of the spectrum, with little malt backbone. This not a bad thing though when a beer in this style is made so well. It really lets the hops shine through, with nothing to cover them up or mask them. It is something I would need to be in the mood for though, when I want a hop bomb and something a bit different. As far as IPA's go, this also pushes these boundaries, almost flirting with the line between an IPA and DIPA.

The defining characteristic for me is a grape-like presence in the taste. I don't get a lot of citrus/piney-ness that I like in big IPAs. Lacks much malt. It's more enjoyable in the 16 oz can.

140,30420,SmashPants,3.9,"Format: reasonable 355mL brown bottle with an original and decent label.  Appearance: pours a bright orange-brown in colour with with very sparse visible carbonation. An off-white head froths up to a finger before settling to a thick half-finger. Thin lacing.  Aroma: a fairly moderate aroma of grapefruit and particularly pine hops. Some biscuit malts behind also.  Taste: stronger on the palate than on the nose. A great mix of grapefruit, pine and those biscuit malts. As expected there is some bitterness, but predominantly the hop flavours which is fantastic.  Aftertaste: some sweetness from the citrus hops and a nicely metered out hop bitterness. This really is a damn good IPA.  Mouth feel: medium in body with a moderate carbonation. Still reasonable, but it feels a touch flaccid. I wouldn't mind a touch more carbonation.  Overall: quite a nice AIPA as expected fro Sierra Nevada. Not sure it's worth AU$92 a case, but I'll take a 6-pack every now and then.

Aroma: Smell has a big, citrusy/piney hops presence.  Taste: The taste is even more heavy on hops. The pine and citrus in the nose are even more present on the palate. Lots of bitter hop bite, and some alcohol burn. It's a sipper for me - one to drink slowly, though the taste isn't very diverse, it's more like just really bitter.  Mouthfeel: It has the right depth for a really hoppy IPA. Not watery, but not too thick either.  Overall: Pretty good hoppy IPA.

The head leaves ample sticky lace and the glass supports loads of busy CO2.  Smell - Very obvious lemon and resinous pine hops from the American whole cone hops used. This beer smells fresh and inviting like a pine wood early in the day when the sun hits the canopy.  Taste - Very heavy pine and resinous hop flavour from the outset. This beer is very herby and has some very light sweet bread malts making it full and punchy, boisterous and confident.  Mouthfeel - Full in the mouth with decent body and a lovely puckering tingle from the heavy hop. The final element is a great drying feel in the roof of the mouth that leaves you sucking your gums and causes the mouth to water.  Overall - If you are going to drink American IPA then drink one that is brewed in the USA as they simply do it better than we do. Stands to reason that it is their baby after all. This beer is rounded , boisterous and punchy with great hops flavour it is refreshing and confident. This is a great example of the style.

140,30420,jcance,5,"Try as I might, I cannot find a beer I prefer to Torpedo.  I'm going to try and keep this succinct, because I could go on forever about my love for this ale. So here are the basic points:  This brew is strong, tastes like a hops orgy, and you can hardly notice the flavor of alcohol. Must I say more? Sure!  This beer is so hoppy that its aftertaste reminds me of Cannabis. By this I mean the hops content is downright skunky, but 110% inoffensive in nature. The flavor is akin to the smell of a large, fresh bag of medical ganja.  I am really amazed at the amount of hops they manage to pack into this fucker without ending up with a bitter, smoothie-like beer. Immensely hoppy as far as aromas and flavors are concerned; sometimes if I've been drinking it and engage in physical activity I can actually smell the hops aroma coming out of my pores.  Carbonation is perfect, bitterness is perfect, strength is a bit stronger than moderate. I can almost not get enough of this beer; after drinking it exclusively for a few months I've gotten mildly burnt out on the flavor, but I'm about ready to go back.  I really don't even know what else to say about this beer, aside from that it is probably my favorite beer I've ever tried and that if you haven't tried it, you ought to now. There are some brews I enjoy thoroughly which I don't really consider a necessity for existence, but this is NOT one of those brews.  ***THIS IS A NECESSITY FOR EXISTENCE***. Swear to god. I almost wish nobody had turned me onto it so I wouldn't realize how good beer could really be. Enjoy guys",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: The most present notes are pine and grapefruit, with hints of blueberry, mandarin orange, and bready malts. T: Bold grapefruit and other citrus flavors from the hops hit the tongue first. Resiny, piney, hop oils linger on through the palette. A body of malt adds slight balance to the hoppy flavors, and lets the alcohol become more and more present. However, it is balanced more towards the hoppy side. A lasting bitterness carries into the finish, leaving a mild aftertaste. M: Medium-bodied. Crisp, refreshing flavors and lasting hop potency. Nice carbonation tingles the tongue. O: This has become one of the most popular IPAs in America and it certainly deserves that honor. I ""judge"" other IPAs in comparison to this. It has tremendous flavor and an instantly recognizable name that has proven popular to many.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The taste is reminiscent to the pale ale but much more complex. It has a almost sweet quality close to that of a pineapple but not quite, a lot of other flavors that I can't quite pinpoint.The after taste is almost too bitter and seems almost unbalanced because of the almost nonexistent malt.

Appearance - clear rich bronze color with a few reddish hues. One finger of head tops it all off, with some streaky curtain lacing left inside the glass. Small amount of visible carbonation.  Smell - citrusy with some lemon, grapefruit and nectarines. Smell is subdued for a substantial IPA.  Taste - fairly good citrus flavor lemon and nectarines again. Some earthy and pine elements. Even some caramel flavor blended in.nice balance and substantial boldness, I only wish I had gotten this fresher as I imagine it would be considerably more flavourful. Malt flavor blends very nicely with citrusy hops.  Mouthfeel - smooth, medium carbonation with medium to heavy body. Moist juicy finish.  Overall - a very nice IPA, that I think would score at least a quarter point higher across the board if fresh. Definitely worth a try for IPA lovers and important to have fairly fresh, but still pretty solid if sitting on the shelf for a little longer than you'd like.

It is amber, almost translucent, light tan color head, very creamy head too. There is a good amount of retention and lacing.  S: This is a very balanced, typically called east coast style IPA. There is a good amount of ripe pineapple juice in this, as well as mango. But, there is also a good, solid, amount of biscuit and caramel malts. Seems quite sweet.  T: The taste confirmed what I smelled. But, this is quite a bit more bitter than expected with a strong orange peel and pine (typical west coast though) like attack right at the front. Then, the pineapple and mango are still there, a bit subdued than in the smell. You still get a good amount of caramel and cookie dough.  M: On the heavier side of medium feel, not too sticky. Carbonation is lively.  O: This is very drinkable and solid. I admit that I suppose the bottle is around 3-4 months old after the tasting, so I admit I may not have the full, correct experience that this beer can offer (I adjust my score accordingly).

Big hops predicted. Rich tasty hops, fruity, crisp, with lots of lime and grapefruit, some peach and faint pineapple, bathed in some floral honey, on top of caramel ""covered"" biscuity malts. Nice pine and hop resin afterwards, developing into a bigger leafy bitterness in the finish, hinting some ""sticky icky"" dankness. Medium body, a bit oily, low to medium carbonation. Very bitter, sure, but the aftertaste is full of fruity hoppy tastiness. Big plus in my book. This is a really gentle monster.

Nose is a little weak for me but I do get a little pineyness from some hops. Maybe some earthiness as well just the nose was really weak and hard to make out.  Taste really makes up for the smell. Really bold, hops flavor with pine, and earthy hops taking center stage. I get a little bit of the malts that attempt to balance it out but the hops are just too much for them to counter weigh.  Mouthfeel has a decent fullness to it. Not too much though, it is just about where you want it to be for such a powerful beer.  Overall, this is a good beer just a little too much for my taste. I tend to prefer an IPA that is well balanced or a little to the malty side of balanced. This one is the other side of the spectrum from that.

Hop flavor is bold but not soapy or astringent, and some light malt sweetness contributes balance and complexity. Soft carbonation, medium body, slight carbonic bite.  Very smooth, quaffable, and balanced. The hop qualities are bold but stop short of overwhelming, and the supporting roles are gentle and harmonic.

O) Very good, enjoyed it more than I thought I might, not being a fan of American-type hops.

SMELL: initially sweet molasses, bread, flowery with some citrus and pine.  TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet malt, the taste of bread and then a pleasant citrus and pine hop profile that does not overpower but lingers in a very good way. This is a very balanced beer when you consider malt vs. hops. The 7.2% ABV is imperceptible so beware :)  PALATE: medium body and slightly higher carbonation for the style, somewhat chewy.

As it warms, malt sweetness becomes more apparent, which complements the hops nicely.  Body: Well balanced, not too heavy, not too thin.  Overall, I find this a well-balanced double IPA - not as hoppy as I was expecting, but I think their focus on balancing the malt and hops in a complementary fashion, as opposed to creating a hop-bomb, works out in their favor and results in a very enjoyable beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste follows the nose, but this is all about a citrus blast of bitterness in the way of apple/ pine. Astringency here in the biting finish is something I recall from the prior time I tried Torpedo years ago. It's still there, and it's kept me from trying it ever since until now. Let me check the bottle date just to be sure of freshness... Dated 4 months ago. Not super fresh, but certainly new enough to get accurate impressions. This beer bites hard with the citrus. I normally don't mind aggressive IPAs, but this one just takes that direction using a taste that doesn't please my palette as much as it's imperial version does, for example. Too much sharp citric acid bite overtaking even the pine, and the sweet malts seem to remain far apart from that. Curious. I will revisit this down the road nonetheless. I certainly love Hoptimum.

140,30420,Jadjunk,4.09,"""At Sierra Nevada we take hops seriously. Torpedo Extra IPA starts with the work's finest whole-cone hops and intensifies their flavors with a little magic from our ""Hop Torpedo."" A revolutionary method of dry hopping, the torpedo brings this beer alive with a rush of complex hop aromas and flavors not found in any other beer. Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA is a big American IPA - perfectly balanced yet full of flavor and aromas that highlight the complex citrus, pine, and herbal character of whole-cone American hops."" Brewed in the style of an American IPA, initially released in 2008, this is one of the brewery's newest year-round releases. Available in 12 oz. 6 and 12 packs and on draft.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a Sierra Nevada tulip glass. Served above 53º Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a golden-white head of a creamy foam consistency over a deep orange amber body with a moderate haziness and trace sediment. Carbonation is light and relaxed. Retention is good and lacing is light and speckled. 4.25  (Smell) Fresh, juicy citrus and grapefruit zest with fruity, floral and peppery undertones. The malt body consists of a biscuity and mildly grainy caramel malt, moderately sweet but aromatic and clean. The aroma is well balanced and aromatic- a role model west coast IPA. Potency is medium-high. 4  (Taste) Very hop forward, with zesty citrus and grapefruit up front, merging to an assertively bitter floral, peppery and spicy hop finish. The malt profile is nearly the same as the nose predicted, a clean moderately toasted caramel syrup malt profile with a moderate sweetness that does a fair job at balancing the hop profile without stealing the show. The overall flavor is very clean with lots of enjoyable hop flavor and a mildly dry finish. 4.25  (Mouthfeel) Texture is clean, slick, mildly chewy. Carbonation generates a light frothiness for a relaxed mouthfeel, perhaps a bit softer than expected. Body is medium+ for the style, medium+ overall. Balance is equally bitter to sweet. Alcohol presence is low, and there are no discernible off characters. Altogether, it's got a great drinkability. 3.75  (Overall) For the hop lover in all of us, Torpedo is a great pitstop that can be enjoyed anywhere between those highly sought after and crazy expensive hop projects. A great bargain and a widespread availability is the final straw warranting any beer enthusiast to at least give it a chance. Provided you love hops and hop flavor, you'll find it worth a try. 4  Sierra Nevada Brewing Company's Torpedo Extra IPA 4.1/5.00",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,leantom,4.2,"Got to have this at a local barbecue joint. Here goes:  A: Quite nice. A dark orange with a decent one-finger white head. A good amount of lacing as well.  S: Very robust, but not too overpowering. Can smell lots of pine, lemon, grapefruit - definite presence of cascade and chinook hops. Kind of mellow, however.  T: Great. Can taste lots of hops. The grapefruit, lemon and pine tastes are balanced against nice amber malt. In fact, this beer is quite balanced for the style. The resiny taste isn't overpowering, making the beer quite drinkable.  I have to note that it's the pine that really predominates in the beer. The grapefruit and lemon are rather muted, which is actually very interesting. I loved it.  M: Excellent. Nicely carbonated and goes down the throat with minor resistance. The taste really coats the palate quite nicely.  O: A very good IPA. Will try it again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,LagerCognoscenti,4.06,Best before date 11th april 2015.So presumably about 2 and a half months old.Dark orange/amber colour. Moderate carbonation. Good lacing that sticks around. Big bubbles and some small ones too.  Aroma is appealing with oranges and marmalade noticeable. But not a very strong aroma.  Tastes bitter but also has a very strong malt backbone. A big flavour indeed with some booziness and wonderfully complex hoppy and malty interplay at work.  Mouthfeelk is rather oily and resiny. Pleasant but encouraging slower completative drinking.  Overall a very enjoyable big tasting beer. One of the most widely available American IPAs in the UK and seems a worthy benchmark for the style.  My mark out of one hundred would be 89.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,PaulyB83,4.15,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pilsner hourglass. Bottled 05/12/14  A- Pours a medium copper with a medium white head and high degree of clarity.  S- Lots of citrus of grapefruit and orange peel, light floral and pine.  T- Similar to aroma, but with the floral and pine more noticeable. A bit more bitterness than most IPAs, finishes with pine and a nice medium sweetness.  M- Medium, a very crisp and clean IPA, very drinkable.  O- I usually don't get this beer due to living in Kalamazoo and the abundance to cheap Two Hearted, but I picked up this bottle to give it a full review. It is an exceptional single IPA that's only knock for me is that it is a bit too piney form my tastes, but that is in keeping with West Coast IPAs.

Color is a slightly hazy amber-orange.  Aroma: citrus, pine, and yeast rolls.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied, sticky, highly carbonated with a quite dry and lingering bitter finish.  Flavor: grapefruit, orange peel, pine, medium roasted barley, some caramel.  Overall: excellent and well done to the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,VALIS666,3.88,"Pours a an attractive copper/rust color, sticky lace abounds. Smell is surprisingly faint, a bit of pine and floral hops.

140,30420,DenverHopHead,4.5,"Poured from a bottle with a packaged on date of 5/7/14; into a pub glass. Appearance - A clean, crisp, light orange. Bubbly carbonation and a foamy, white head. Sticky lacing left on the glass! Smell - Citrus and pine, some faint sourdough bread malts. Taste - A really easy drinking beer, that is a bit addictive! Hops, swiftly taken over by a strong malt kick, but a grapefruit bitterness to finish it off! Feel - This just grows on you. A tame hop bomb; bitter, but balanced with just the right blend of malts! Overall - Just one of those beers you want to keep drinking!

Beautiful head that holds, too. It smells amazing and tastes great. Floral and hoppy as an IPA should prove. I dig the hop flavor of this extra IPA and enjoy gazing over the hop crop artwork on the beer's label. You can judge this IPA by the cover. Definitely a strong, bold beer.

Nice citrus flavor with a hint of caramel and malt.  M: slight bitter aftertaste and dry finish, but in this case that's a good thing.  My local shop sometimes puts a 6er of Torpedo on special for $7.49, a steal for a beer this good. I'm no hipster trying to be cool plugging an IPA, just a middle-aged midwest dad who has yet to find a better IPA. Sierra Nevada deserves all the credit they get for this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BeerSnobsUnited,4.5,"I fell in love with this beer. It is definitely my new favourite.  Appearance: Nice orangeish-brown colour (slightly brighter than copper). Carbonation was crazy, putting 3 1/2 fingers of head in my tulip. Head retention was outstanding, and spotter lacing never faded.  Smell: Huge sweet citrus notes. A lot of pineapple, red grapefruit, tangerine, and Clementine. Has some huge floral and grassy notes as well, with other earthy tones. Very subtle caramel malt squeaks through the aggressive hop to add some contrast.  Taste: A little bit of every type of hop melds perfectly. Small pine, large citrus, and aggressive floral tones sweep across the tongue. Bubble gum sweetness and caramel take charge half way through and finish with subtle booze and bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Aggressive carbonation makes for continual stimulation, mild alcoholic glow, and the light/medium body is refreshing at first and sudden dramatic astringency follows.  Overall: I would have sex with this if I could.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Beerwitched,4.88,"Rich-Brown/ Red-copper (medium tan), decent head. Good consistent presentation.  Hops and citrus flavours in the appealing aroma.  Good strong taste with rich, chocolate and hoppy notes with a citrus tang, yet balanced and not too zesty.  Decent mouthfeel even though I don't usually palate citrus notes.  I will definitely be coming back for more of this!

140,30420,SaltofOH,4.23,"16 ounce can from a mix-and-match six pack.  Appearance: Red-copper, hazy (chilled). Light, tan, thick, foamy head. Little effervescence.  Aroma: Intensely hoppy. Citrusy, with pineapple. Grassy, and not hot.  Taste: Bold. Sweet, rich, hoppy goodness. Soft, sweet arrival with a hint of citrus. Earthy hops present across mid-palate, with strong but not overpowering earthy bitterness at the end. Balanced, but tilted toward hops.  Mouthfeel: Midweight-to-heavy. Slick. Mild effervescence. I like the way this feels, but BJCP guidelines say it should be lighter than it is.  Overall: A killer IPA, and from a can! Not as heavy as (recently-reviewed) Big Vic (by Elevator Brewing Co.) but still not an ""easy"" drinker. I will definitely buy this again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,silverevo9,4.5,"This IPA is about perfect. The appearance is of a copper that is really light for IPA. The pour creates a slow building liquid/head effect. It takes at least three pours to finish. The head just wont go away. The thickness of the head that rises past the lip of the glass is, the impenetrable wall that cant be defeated. Juicy notes of sweet hops and a good malt backbone. Each pour leaves plenty of residue in the head. Alcohol on the palate is virtually non-existent. Will nail you when your not looking though. Each pour will bring on a different take on this beer. I taste more flavors as i continue to drink. Lacing is excellent and invites you with its mural. This IPA is a lot smoother that its little brother SNPA. The beer itself is a lot better in my opinion. Can easily drink a copious amount of this beer.  Awesome beer!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,doktorhops,4.53,"Here's a big one for me from them old boys at Sierra Nevada - big because up until now I've been a Torpedo Extra IPA virgin and big because I know that I'm in for one hell of a ride - no need to descale my tongue of that 4.3% Ruddles County then...  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a nonic pint.  A: Clear copper bodied (I'm really running out of adjectives to describe 'amber' but who cares?) with what was once a proud white head but is now an even prouder minimal lacing - prouder because you know this beer is going to be a 7.2 ABV hop slap in the face.  S: Bitter bitter orange and pine hops assail the nose fairly lighter than expected but nonetheless with welcome arms wide open crying ""Hooops!"". The rest of the aroma is candi sugar water. Not bad, not great; no doubt a deceptive aroma for what lies ahead.  T: As expected this concoction is all about tripping the hop fantastic - a real hop lovers brew here. The hop characters are as diverse as the characters in a Robert Altman film; we have Sir Pine (the fourth Duke of Resinton), Madam Marmalade (of the prodigious Citrus line), Lord Tea-Leaf Tannin (part-time Sinonese adventurer) and the earthy (and seductive!) Eartha Kitt - also known as ""Catwoman"". Aside from the bold and varied hops there is a faint and sweet malt base at play here, thankfully though it doesn't distract from those fantastic hops. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this brew is the restraint of the bitterness. Yes it is bitter but not all-the-others American IPA bitter, well done Sierra Nevada. Would I be as bold to say dry even? Yes, yes I would.  M: Medium bodied with an oily but well balanced (i.e. light) carbonation.  D: Aside from the better than average aroma this is a damn, damn fine IPA, damn fine (in case the first two 'damns' weren't enough... and the extra 'fine' too). Expensive if you live in Real-beer-hater-land, aka Australia, but well worth the price in my opinion. If you love hops, and your nickname on Beeradvocate is ""doktorhops"" (that is one hell of an exclusive criteria) then this beer is for you.  Food match: I would savour and enjoy this excellent ale on its own if I were you. However if I weren't you and you were you and I was recommending something for you who I wasn't; then this beer would pair well with bold cheeses, dark meats and spicy food, but I am you and I'm telling you to ""Shut up and enjoy this ale on its own"", there.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Lacing fair; many small islands with medium to large bubbles Body medium yellow with slight haze Flavor begins with slight melon and flower taste which quickly dies, leaving only an astringency. No malt, no alcohol, no diacetyl. Palate light to medium, watery, soft carbonation  Basically a weak ""extra"" IPA, possibly due to age, but still no malt break through.

Appearance is a great gold color, very similar to a standard American ale, but much richer looking. The smell is what I imagine to be a perfected West Coast IPA with PNW like pine, fresh all around.

A: Bright and clear, orange tinted auburn coloring, light carbonation immediately after pour, which quickly fades away. Thick and creamy one and a half finger off white head with substantial pitting. Slowly fade to a moderate cap leaving lots of lacing along the way.  S: Generic citrus, pine, and malt. Not as big of a nose as other high ABV IPAs, but there is plenty of grapefruit and floral notes to remind you what it is you are drinking.  T: Smooth, with a distinct hop bitterness, and a toasted malt backing. Tastes Raw...whatever that means.  M: Juicy to start, medium body, medium carbonation, fairly acidic, leaves with a dry finish.  O: My IPA standby here on the East Coast. Lots of bitter hops, plenty of character, high ABV, readily available, and reasonably priced.

In the taste there is a good sense of a light malt backbone,but it is clear that the piney and tropical hops are in the drivers seat.

I can't explain how the entire experience of ordering a Torpedo and drinking it is so complete. Adjectives disappear. I become one with the total experience. If it's not the perfect beer for me, it's as near perfect as I have ever found. I have tried to describe the experience to friends and family, but lately, I don't even care if no one else likes it.

Rich citrus notes. Definitely hop forward but a nice biscuity malt on the backend to balance it all out. Mouthfeel was slightly carbonated but at the same time was rich and coated the mouth with the beer's essence. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer.

140,30420,hreb,3.42,"24oz ""extra"" Torpedo IPA. Served in pint glass. Pale orange amber and crystal clear with giant soda bubbles. Also a very healthy sized head, which quickly leaves lacy goodness. Pretty tame aroma for an IPA that looks like this one, though. Flavor is a bit better, with serious pine-hop flavor and a really dry finish. I can't say this is a great brew, but at under 13 cents an ounce (purchased today at QFC), dollar for dollar, you could do a lot worse. Carbonation is a bit too high for my palate. Also the finish is bitter, and while not quite chalky, is not nearly as refined as an IPA of such proportions (flavor-wise) ought to be.  I was not a big fan of the ubiquitous Sierra Nevada pale ale when I first tried it years ago, finding it was a completely unbalanced one-note Cascade disaster. I've avoided it ever since. This doesn't offend me nearly so much, but I suspect that it's actually a better beer, too.

140,30420,thehyperduck,3.97,"355 mL bottle picked up as a mixed-six in MI; bottled Oct 25 2013 and served slightly chilled.  Pours a clear, orange-amber colour, topped with just over one finger's worth of bumpy, foamy, off-white coloured head. It recedes slowly over the next few minutes, leaving behind an uneven cap and a doily pattern of lace around the edge of the glass. Fairly typical aroma for the style - orange citrus and grapefruit, earthy pine and some bready malt notes. Approachable enough.  This one strikes me as a textbook West Coast IPA, but not an incredible one. The malt backbone offers up some mild caramel and bready malt sweetness, but the hops are clearly the main focus. White grapefruit, orange peel and floral notes soon lead into an earthy, slightly spicy finish that leaves a lingering bitterness behind on the palate after each sip. Medium-bodied, with moderately restrained carbonation that provides a relatively crisp, refreshing mouthfeel for an IPA. Not particularly sticky/oily, and the alcohol is quite well-masked. Easy to drink quickly at first, but the abv and bitterness catch up to you.  [Updated Dec 1 2021]  12 oz can from a beer advent calendar; dated 06/08/21 and served barely chilled. Haven't had (or even seen) this in years, so I figured a review update was in order. I don't disagree with much of what I wrote up there - Sierra Nevada's Torpedo Extra is no doubt a classic West Coast IPA that holds up even to this day, but I wouldn't say it blows the competition out of the water or anything. Solid, well-constructed brew, one that I'd purchase on the regular if it were available in Ontario.

Just a hint of booze can be detected.  T: Unlike the nose, it's not your usual IPA. The hops are moderate and don't assault the palate. More piney than citrus from the hops, even a bit spicy at first. Malts are in there but not too pronounced. It's even a little sweet and floral with some earthy notes in there somewhere. It ends with the faintest touch of booze.  M: Medium-heavy bodied. Not too heavy, but you'll know you're drinking something. Very crisp and clean. Barely leaves a slickness in the mouth. Goes down well!  O: Not my favorite of IPA's, but I finally tried and I'm glad to say that I have. I really enjoy it and might even pick up another 6-pack if given the chance.

S: Fantastic aromas of pine and citrus and I am also thinking of sweet cherries. Pine dominates this beer but not quite like alba scots pine ale.  T: Strong pine again dominates but gives way to a biscuit cracker like flavor and then a nice bitter.  M: Smooth, easy to drink.  O: This has to be one of my favorite IPA's it has a strong bitter and pine profile but it tastes so good I could enjoy it anywhere, I had this sitting at a beach house on Anna Marie Island in FL and now I'm enjoing it in Indiana where it's snowing in April (why!?!?!)

140,30420,Bis4beer70,4.69,"L- Clear golden brown & magical. One/two finger of persistent,stubborn white head & a lacing that lasts and lasts and lasts!  S - Nothing overpowering smell-wise, surprisingly for an Extra IPA, but the hops are very apparent with a super-spicy & still,yet very fruity smell in the back.  T - Hops and alcohol (7.20% ABV ) are apparent...also a slightly toasted, ""in the pines"" taste...""where the sun ALWAYS shines"".  M - Melts a bit in your mouth at first with a moderate body..& i'd guess, probably a little less than moderate carbonation compared to most bigger name brand IPA's.  Overall - It is a 'go-to beer'...a pleasing and fine tasting IPA! Sierra Nevada always comes through w/whatever they do and this, along w/their porter is my favorite of theirs.  My grocery store nearly always seems to have it on sale for around $13.99 for a 12 pack case,so how can i argue with that?...between them & the ""mound builder IPA"" at People's beer,i am torn on which IPA to buy on a weekly basis...(so i usually buy both..if my wife and our budget tolerates it).

I like this because it reminds me of a home-brew the old man next door made as a ritual.  Initially, I think the hops will strike the funny bones (maybe muscles) in my cheeks and force a squint, but the flavor stops short. For one ominous moment it threatens to unhinge my jaw as the taste expands my mouth cavity, but it backs off. It is more than most familiar IPAs, but not in a crazy lot-of-hops way.  Pleasant actually. No flaws, no wishes for more of this or less of that. Near perfect balance. Very enjoyable with a fleeting aftertaste of something resembling gingerbread, and pine, and citrus, and phenolic resins  A random synapse fired linking this with Anchor Steam Beer which I love, only it's different. Both are something like the home-brew the salt of the earth neighbor made.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,WyethBednar,3.5,"Not my favorite IPA. A little piney for my taste without enough of a citrus backbone to balance it out.  Appearance: Really nice. Light amber, bright, very visible carbonation. A nice off-white head and good lacing.  Smell: Really heavy on the pine. Very earthy and natural smelling.  Taste: Way too piney and floral for my tastes. I like more citrusy hops, and this was sort of like drinking an evergreen forest. Not a bad taste, but I don't think I'd get a 6-pack of it. It's a niche taste profile.  Mouthfeel: Really nice. Good carbonation, smooth and drinkable.  If you have more of a disposition for floral hop profiles, you'd probably love this beer. But it's a more subtle taste than the heavy, citrusy IPAs I tend to prefer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,porter_collie,4.36,"Bottle poured into a pint glass  A - Beautiful golden color, with a thick frothy head.  S - Pine, lemon, and yeasty esters.  T - Grapefruit, pine, and a pleasant biscuit flavor. Some booziness from the 7.2% ABV as it warms up.  M - Enjoyably creamy mouthfeel, with just the right amount of effervescence from the carbonation.  O - When I think of a well-done basic IPA, Torpedo has the type of tastes, smells, and sights that immediately come to mind. Certainly not as trendy as the modern citrus-bombs, but it perfectly balances new-school and old-school IPAs. A great bargain to boot.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,greentam2,4.43,"This is the perfect beer for those who have graduated to an ipa with a bit more of a full hop and abc. Beautiful amber color, floral hoppy aroma, a mild front taste, but a very full citrusy spicy hoppy backside. It lingers to inform you as to when the best time to take the next sip is. West Coast, it is unmatched. But, journeying to the far reaches of the piney woods marsh, Dogfish Head, I must admit, does even better. For the price, for the abc, for the ipa essence, this is the best beer you can buy at the convenience or grocery store.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Gozillasnack,4.77,"Pours clear, very orange. A little on the foamier side. Hoppy aroma with a prudent but not overwhelming citrus blend. Initial taste is mildly acidic, quickly becomes smoother and the malt opens up on your palette, blending with the citrus. Has an average thickness for an IPA and leaves a pleasantly hoppy aftertaste. A good blend of traditional English IPA while having enough of a unique taste to set it apart from the others and avoid being boring. Did not expect this much quality from this beer, I've been missing out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Mikus,3.53,"Rated this as a 3.5 from previously enjoying it a couple of years back. On closer inspection, I recently bought a sixer and sat down for a more detailed examination. Poured from a 12oz bottle into my snifter. Packaged 8/1. Nice and fresh. @ fingers of white head on top of a nice, hazy copper brew. Orange and lemon on the nose, a bit of the resiny, piny note, and the nice characteristic SN fresh smell. Nice pine on the tastebuds, good balanced bitterness overall. Medium body, nice carbonation throughout enjoying the glass, and a nice clean aftertaste. Overall, this is a truly solid IPA.

140,30420,TexasRedskinFan,4.8,"Wow. Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA is a true ""World Class Beer"". I've enjoyed standard Sierra Nevada Pale Ale over the years but today was my first time sampling this beer. Bought a six pack at my local Spec's.  Pours a orange hued, deep amber with a 1.5 - 2 inch egg shell head on top. Beautiful!! You can smell the hops from 5 feet away. Intense. Tastes like an over hopped, intense kick in the mouth. But somehow it manages to be completely balanced and actually very dry for the style. I keep sipping then chugging, then sipping and then staring at the bottle. I'm almost awestruck at how incredibly perfect this is. Standard SN PA is kinda ""one note"". This is not. Mouthfeel is not overly carbonated and not too thick. Overall this is a religious experience of beer. I'm so intrigued that I will be bringing this to the first barbeque of the year just to blow some minds.  Congratulations Sierra Nevada, you have created a masterpiece!!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Caj1,4.66,"Quite a nice IPA from the brewmasters at Sierra Nevada, this beer is fruity and complex with the right amount of bitterness to balance out the sweetness of the beer. The Torpedo pours a very nice copper-gold and foams quite nicely, leaving plenty of lacing. Smell is good, and brings the expected citrus, grass and piney notes that one would expect from an IPA; it's delicate but quite fragrant.  Taste is excellent as well; a nice kick in the mouth at first as the grapefruit and oily pine notes hit, which is underscored with plenty of astringent and bitter qualities; as the beer warms in the mouth, it releases more of its profile, and the sweet, sticky, bready barley lingers along with the hops. Mouthfeel isn't bad at all; it's crisp and refreshing, but definitely warrants sipping and enjoying over slamming down like some other pale ales I've had.  So, what can I say? It's a good IPA, tastes great, and does exactly what it needs to do; gives a nice buzz and helps balance out a meal.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,yardkl,4.19,One of my favorite IPAs. This one of the more dry IPAs out there. Some IPAs can be slightly sweet but not this one. This is definitely a grown mans beer.

I can understand why some won't necessarily be wowed by this beer but there is no denying that it is a well made ipa. Torpedo pours a really nice autumn red with a glowing hue about it.

After having a couple other brews in this style, I can conclude that for me personally, it doesnt get much better then this. No sugary, syrupy mouthfeel or aftertaste just bitter, upfront hops balanced by some citrus.

Bitter and dry on the end.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated and somewhat sticky in the mouth after swallowing.  Overall: This beer is still one of my favorites from SN.

140,30420,BigGold,4.08,"Have enjoyed many a Torpedo, even before its 2012 arrival in Mississippi, most recently poured from 12-oz. bottle, label stamped ""PKGD 02/11/21,"" into nonic pint.  Pours amber with clarity and 1-finger light-tan head, with excellent retention, leaving sketchy lace down the glass. Aroma is initially spice and dry malt, with fruity aromas also revealed as warms. Begins with moderate carbonation and piney hop resin, and some fruit flavors as warms, which together carry into light caramel malt, before a West Coast bitter hop finish.  Primarily a piney malt bomb, and still the best big IPA for the money you can usually find, just about anywhere.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ZagZagg,4.04,"12oz bottle poured into tulip  A: Amber with a copper tint. Plenty of clarity letting a decent amount of light pass presenting a moderately carbonated appearance that produced a weak head, but drags along some lacing.  S: Dry nose upfront, pine and earth. Muted florals with sweet fruits, without too much citrus present; nice spice too. Lightly zesty, citrus peel, grapefruit.  T: Surprisingly malty in the forward feel, resinous, dry, ginger mixed with other spices. Hop profile is more muted that I would have anticipated. The resinous feel exchanges with subtle notes of caramel – really well balanced, almost too well balanced if that makes sense. Alternative citrus, nectarine, lemongrass – finished slightly sweet, tropical mango  M: Nice body with strong crisp mouthfeel that is refreshing. Medium carbonation plays on the tongue and imparts a zesty-dry aftertaste that is vaguely sweet.  O: Wow, not exactly what I expected. This beer is crisp a very drinkable. The malt profile here is very significant, beyond balancing the beer. Hops are around, but in the leading rolls I was expecting, but still imparting their fruity zest. Honestly this reminds me of Nugget Nectar a lot. Just because it wasn’t what I anticipated doesn’t mean I didn’t enjoy.

140,30420,ThePaintedGrey,4.36,"12oz. bottle poured into a pub glass.  A: An absolutely gorgeous aged-copper color with a slight haze. An absolute behemoth of a head as a result of a fairly aggressive pour. The head is about two full inches in stature, sporting the color and texture of a homemade vanilla milkshake. Phenomenal amounts of lacing down the glass. Pure, unadulterated aesthetic perfection for the style.  S: Floral hops with trademark grapefruit notes. A bit of Earthy pine meshes well to give it a very rustic aroma profile. Some peppery alcohol spice underneath. Well-executed simplicity is very pleasant and satisfying.  T: Some floral and herbal hops with a lot of grapefruit notes and citric zest. Those pine and grassy notes seep through to give this one an amazingly Earthy character. A tiny bit of peppery spice underneath with some bready malts. Lots of hop bitterness overall, but does well to straddle the line between bitter and pungent. Near flawlessly executed.  M: Medium-full bodied. Silky smooth and wonderfully creamy with a well-controlled carbonation that adds a tiny bit of bite, but doesn't get in the way of the smooth textures or tingle the tongue enough to shroud the flavors. Superb drinkability.  O: Sierra Nevada has put themselves in the running for my favorite American IPA. This is an absolutely perfect example of the style and is near-perfection in a bottle. I usually do in-depth conclusions, but I think I'll leave it at that. Damn near flawless. Tells all other AIPAs to step their game up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Not a bad aroma, just not easy to pick up. Most prominent aroma is the pine aroma of the hops. There is a slight citrus scent to the beer most likely from the citra hops used.  T: Taste is intially hit with the aromas of citrus and pine but soon subsides into a bitter punch that falls away to a nice pine and grapefruit finish that last long. Good finish on this brew.  M: Medium to light-medium bodied. Smooth, likely due to magnum and crystal hops. Aftertaste leave astringency in the mouth, perhaps just a little more than I like.

Smell: Orange, light grapefruit, floral pine notes, hint of caramel  Taste: Smack of pine upfront with a orangey citrus finish. Caramel malt sweetness throughout  Mouthfeel: Medium with appropriate bitterness.  Overall: Once upon a time i thought this was a top notch, world class beer. My palate has been through the wringer since, and i no longer think that. It's good, perhaps even great, but it doesnt have the juicy tropical character i go for in these new school IPAs.

Smell is a bit muted, a little bit of carmel from the malt but mostly citrusy tangerine aroma from the hops.  On the tongue the malt takes a bit more presence, the carmel is still present but hints of dark fruits and burnt biscuits are faintly detectable. The hops also make themselves known, mostly imparting pithy citrus as well as pine. A fair amount of sweetness that is perhaps overbalanced by the pithy qualities of the hops.  A nice beer on the tongue, quite thick and nicely carbonated. Easily drinkable and does a good job at hiding its high alcohol content.

I just love the way this beer feels and tastes. Very hoppy mixed with rich flavor. Makes my mouth salivate! I've been trying many IPA's and XX IPA's over the last couple months looking to find the perfect one. This is the hands down winner in my book. Celebration is a top 5 beer for me also.

Very earthy hops flavor with the perfect carbonation. This one was a gem in my book. Very comparable to their Celabration ale for 2013, but more hoppy. This beer will find its way to me again since I only got to enjoy half of a bottle.

140,30420,Copernicus,4.54,"Poured 22oz bottle into a nonic pint glass.  What gorgeous color! It radiates a warm and somewhat fiery amber, like the color of honey with golden and copper highlights. Substantial clarity and a pleasant rocky head clocking in at a finger and a half in a luscious khaki-stained white. The lace was moderately sticky.  The aroma rivals the color. It releases obvious American hop characteristics with a weightless and biting citrusy tinge of mostly grapefruit and pine. Beneath this lies a supportive grassy and floral sweetness that moves into a meatier malt character that smells more of orange, tangerine, and pineapple than grain or caramel. Everything here elicits cool early summer nights.  The taste is excellent, but somewhat predictable after the aroma that lends itself to the initial sip, a cool and light quaff of grapefruit, pine, grass, and flowers. Though this is quickly severed by an intense hop bitterness. What little malt characteristic there is works behind the scenes simply to balance out the aggressive hops. As the bitterness dissipates, it all dovetails into that pleasant, distinctive Sierra Nevada finish.  The mouthfeel is good. It's medium body slips and slides with a mild and pleasant effervescence from the subtle carbonation.  Honestly, this beer is explosively fresh and one of the most drinkable IPAs out there. And at 7.2%, you could get yourself into some hefty trouble with this one. I could drink this aaallll day long.  *I'd risk an unconventional food pairing here: seared scallops with tangy grapefruit pan sauce. Of course the standard spicy and aromatic cuisine would be great too...like Thai, Indian, or Moroccan.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Lots of pine and citrus even a little grass. From the smell this almost seems like a double more than just a standard ipa. The flavor follows suit with a ton of pine upfront (almost gin like) followed by a lasting citrus flavor. Not alot of malt in this one but still very well balanced and enjoyable. This is definitely and ipa that you could sit and drink a number of and not get tired of. Excellent work sierra nevada.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Of note, it is not boozy (though some claim it is), I think the huge portions of hops lead some to interpret the booziness. Get some spicy food, and drink a few of these down...the food will taste great and the beer and will still come through onto the palate for a pleasant accompaniment.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Diggitydustin,4.16,"I thoroughly enjoyed this brew. Great color, smell, and taste. I'd recommend it to anyone who can handle a bitter beer. I bought a 12 pack of bottles my first time having it, and honestly I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not but once I opened the bottle and caught a whiff i knew I was going to love it. One of my favorites in recent memories. Also, in my opinion, it's great cold, however, I think it tastes a little better after letting it get just a tad warm.

140,30420,WunderLlama,4.36,"Bottle poured into a Sam Adams glass  Great foamy head with exceptional lacings as the beer settles. Translucent honey amber with some carbonation.  Explosive of fresh, clean crisp pine with citrus. Hint of sweetness.  Pine hops smoothly flow over your tongue. A well crafted beer. Gentle bitterness on the first taste. Bitterness resides in the middle and back of the tongue. It's not a sharp bitter, but, a more flavorful tasting of the hops. Really like this beer, worthy of a repeat and stocking in the fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CrystalGregory,3.78,"This beer has a very crisp, clean, and refreshing taste. The hoppy flavor smells and tastes so good to me, especially after a long day. You can smell it immediately after you pour it. It has a beautiful amber color, No bad after-taste. Very easy to drink. It leaves a nice lacing behind on the glass. I could drink this by itself (preferably), or with a meal. I love the taste so much I even use this beer in some of my cooking.

140,30420,Jay_Ulreich,4.75,"This is the best beer for the buck. Beautiful amber color, great head retention. Nice sticky lacing. Smell is outstanding. Almost instantaneously I get a kick in the face of hop aroma ask I crack the bottle open. I get pine, citrus, flowers,- a field of hops in my nose. I can also smell malt, I dont know how they accomplished that, but its there and its great. Mouthfeel is great, not too thin, not too thick, although for the ABV I would almost expect it to be thicker. Everything about this beer is awesome, its easy drinking, alcohol is non existent in the taste. Its well balanced for an ""extra"" IPA, the malt really shines and I love that about it. Sierra Nevada out did themselves with this one. My go-to brew for sure. I love this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,AName,4.69,Beer was from bottle and poured into a Sierra Nevada pint gas. Light head with citrusy smell. Hoppy and dry taste. Bitter flavor and taste did not linger too long.

140,30420,Tsar_Riga,4.21,"A - Copper orange, very clear. Full, and persistent, pillowy off-white head that produces extensive lacing.  S - Big citrus and pine from the heavy hops, with undercurrents of floral notes and minerality.  T - The flavor delivers on the scent, with strong citrus in the form of orange and grapefruit, combining with pine, leading to a strong, bitter finish. This is an unapologetic hop explosion. The beer, given how big and bright it is, nevertheless balances fairly well. The close does quickly dissipate, and the bitterness build that I've experienced in other bright, hop-forward brews is minimal.  M - Clean, crisp, with high carbonation, and only some drying to close. The slight building of resins is restrained, and only noticeable to me when I'm drinking this brew without food to cut it.  O - After discovering the West Coast IPA through Stone, particularly in the form of the Enjoy By line, I branched out, trying various brewers. In search of Celebration, I came up empty initially, but found this fine entry. Torpedo, for being so solid, is surprisingly affordable, making it a great option for the every day quaff. But just because this beer is relatively cheap doesn't make it any less impressive. It is a very well crafted beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Michaelcbyrnes,4.18,"Appearance - deep golden with reddish hues, nice creamy white head.  Aroma - citrusy grapefruit and pine under that is a grassy floral sweetness and hint of orangey maltiness  Taste - pine and grapefruit, some hints of alcohol mixed with a earthy hoppiness. Finishes slightly bitter tending toward but never reaching harshness before dissipating.  Mouthfeel - heavy smooth and round to start but finishes with a very slight astringent hop dryness.  Overall - a very hop forward beer, as its title Extra IPA suggests. There is a strong malt presence here which is mostly hidden under the powerful hoppiness of the beer. This a very fine IPA and a fine substitute for Celebration Ale after it becomes unavailable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,dc87,4.05,"A - Hazy amber body with a thick white head. A very good looking IPA.  S - Hops. Earthy, pine, a little citrus. A little subdued compared to the taste.  T - Deliciously hoppy from start to finish. Piney hop bitterness. Just a little, barely noticeable malt in the background. Dry pine and grapefruit finish with just a little sweetness to keep it interesting. As the beer warms the sweetness increases. Refreshing and flavoursome but never overstated.  M - Pleasant, quite full bodied and creamy.  O - A wonderfully hoppy and drinkable IPA. Bitter. A go-to beer when needing a hop fix.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Niceroad77,4.75,"Wow, this is just a truly amazing IPA! Wetter you drink it early in the evening or as a closer, it will never let you down. Not a session beer (even though I can really see myself bingeing on it) but one of the most drinkable complex IPA out there. Introduce it to non-IPA fans out there and they might very well like it. Ok enough of this bragging, lets get down to the serious stuff. For reference, I poured this one from a 710ml bottle into a regular tall pint glass.  A: Pours a copper/light amber colour with a good foam head that leaves a beautiful long-lasting lacing.  S: Floral and well balanced citrus with the slightest pine needles. A hint of sweetness and honey.  T: This is where this IPA truly reveals its world class character. Extremely well balanced light grapefruit and pine needles but with what it needs of malt sweetness for a well balanced IPA. Not too bitter or too malty, just what you are looking for.  M: Feels great. Thick but not too much. Good carbonation.  O: IPA's are my regular session drinks and whenever I try new ones, which is most of times, I still get at least one of these Torpedos for reference as it is honestly the best IPA I've had this far. And believe me, I've tasted quite a few!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BastardKing24,4.15,"Pours a dark gold/amber with a small white head that falls to thin bubble layer with lacing that clings to the edge.  Smell is sort of simple with grassy and earthy hops,a mild malty smell, and citrus.  Taste is Lemon and pine, with grassy undertones, and a mild bitterness. It has a decent malty backbone to balance things out. Aftertaste is bitter hops with a fragrant mellow hoppy character.  Feel is nice with medium carbonation and a good balance of feel right between slick and light.  Overall a nice IPA that I won't hesitate to have but I like to see what other IPA's are out there since there are SOO many on the west coast its hard to pick from.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,xabyss,3.89,"Pours a copper orange that's both dark and brilliant. Loads of fluffy batter-like head; body is free of carbonation. Pretty standard stuff for the style. Lots of hops on the nose, with some caramel and biscuit malt buried in the mix. This particular bottle isn't as fresh as I'd like; it's wasted away in my fridge for some weeks now, and spent God knows how long on the retail shelves before then. So perhaps the hops aren't quite as bright and alive as I recall from this brew in the past. Pine and citrus hops open the sip, followed by balancing malts and a resiny, bitter aftertaste.

140,30420,BaronRogue,4.47,"Torpedo is everywhere here in California, so it can often get overlooked or forgotten as a ""had"".  Picked up a bottle for this very reason and remembered why it is a benchmark for the style... bright amber gold, with the bubbles in this beer appearing to be magical, with heavy lacing all the way down.  Smells of intense pine and citrus, the beautiful Cascade hop shining like a diamond, definitely enough to make most novices take a step back and go ""whoa"" if they're used to the lighter end of the spectrum.  Taste is the knockout for me here... intense hops but with a heavy malt aftertaste (along with the lingering bitterness). If you like beers that ""one-up"" other beers and make them taste like water, then Torpedo is a great place to start (Hoptimum would be your ace in the hole though, I have to admit).  Standard, comes in cans and bottles, is bottle conditioned (I think?), and is everywhere. What more could you ask for? Great go-to when you dont feel like experimenting with a diceroll random and want something you know you'll enjoy.  P.S. If you don't know what an actual ""torpedo"" is in beer speak, you should look it up and check it out, it's really interesting (I won't spoil it for you).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Lots of sticky lacing sticking to the glass.  Smell: Strong grapefruit, hoppy, some sweet malt.  Taste: Strong fruity hops and is well balanced with a kiss of malt. Fruity and delicious. Hop bitterness lingers a bit. Bitterness ramps up slowly as the beer warms. I get a lot of grapefruit rind and more citrus as the beer warms too.  Mouthfeel: Highly carbonated, hops go through your palate smoothly. Feels like an IPA should in my opinion.  Just a solid IPA. Wouldn't expect anything less from Sierra Nevada.

Buttery finish that lingers almost as long as the taste.  Excellent ABV  I really appreciate the grapefruit taste. It lingers long after the beer is gone; I'm convinced my breath actually smells better after drinking it.  This beer is a little slick.

Mouth feel is moderate with medium carbonation.  What sticks out to me about this beer is the bitter finish. Usually I expect that to soften a little and mellow, but it did no with this beer.

Well folks that's what this is; a very desirable IPA which is exceptionally good!  I had this poured from a bottle into a Tulip. Appearance is without flaw. Just a sexy looking brew that might remind you of a Canadian whiskey, if not for the wonderfully full head which sticks around and heavily laces throughout the experience. To the nose there is an enormous bouquet of floral hops. I definitely picked up some pine, biscuits and yes...I even got some Violet. As for the mouthfeel....well I've rarely experienced an IPA with THIS pleasant of a mouth-feel. In the mouth it is very very crisp but not unpleasant, actually it's as if your palate is being cleansed for the ""fireworks"". The taste is in fact the fireworks. My God! I can't say enough about how this beer has exceeded my expectations. Up front there is an amazing flow of hops, pine, biscuits and yes some violet. The beer finishes with something you'd think might keep the bitterness on you but in-fact it just teases you with more of a rustic pine...but a different ""pine"" than you'd think. This is the epitome of a FINE BOLD IPA. Yes, this is a very bold brew but one the ""newbie"" should be interested in and one where the ""seasoned"" enthusiast should be ecstatic about.

Middle is tangy and smooth with a hint of barley and a mid-palete kick of hop alkalinity but little hop taste. Finish is where the hop tastes hit me: pine, citrus, chlorophyll...nice. Aftertaste was long and featured more of the lovely hop notes battling it out for dominance.  Mouthfeel 4.5: Good, but slightly off for me. It does not take away from the session, but does not completely match the other outstanding characteristics of this brew.  Overall 4.5: Great IPA. Very smooth, very warm and inviting and entirely sessionable. This baby has a big kick from its 7.0 ABV, but it is entirely unnoticeable, so be aware.

Steller. 4.25 T – juicy ruby grapefruit, cherries, tons of citrus and tropical fruits, passionfruit, pineapple, a thorough but gentle bitterness, this is juicy and balanced.

You will not detect the ABV because its not real high and it is very well hidden. I really like this beer a lot and it will be one of my regulars. The bottle describes a revolutionary dry hopping process and perhaps this is the defining element of the distinctive qualities of this beer. I drank the first one about a week ago and loved it. Decided to wait a week and see if I liked it as much on the second bottle I had. I do. Its a great beer and to me so far, very unique! I am now going to add a new parameter to my review. I am going to call it ""Afterglass"". This is when I leave just a little beer left in my glass and let it warm up all the way and then smell it and taste it. I had to smell it a few times to get a full nose of the beer. The ""afterglass"" had a very pleasant aroma that I am not sure how to describe. It reminds me of something but I am not sure what it is yet. That having been said, I now understand even more why I like this brew so much.

Color is amber/copper with a light cloudy diffusion of light. Effervescent.  Aroma – nice citrusy hops, with herbal/grassy notes. Light caramel malt and balanced.  Flavor – Balanced herbal bitterness with smooth finish. Lemon grass notes begin midway and pleasantly linger on top of mouth and back of throat. Caramel malt provides a nice sweetness that plays well with hop character.  Mouthfeel – Medium body with carb tingle.  Overall: Well balanced beer with strong hop character. A fine choice that I will revisit with frequency. Substantive enough to pair with beef or pork.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A: Dark amber color with a creamy beige head. heavy lacing on the glass  S: Citrus and grapefruit hops. Piney notes as well.  T: The perfect amount of bitterness. Citrus and strong pine flavors.  M: Great mouthfeel with just the right amount of body.  O: Im not a giant IPA fan but this one is good. Its $3 for a bomber and has a good amount of alcohol in it.

I would recommend checking the date though to ensure a fresh beer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Spikester,4.19,Amber with a pale yellow two finger head. Good amount of lacings. Aroma is floral hops. Taste is piney grapefruit resinous with a full malt backbone. Good mouthfeel and good carbonation level. Good drinkability even though 7.2%abv. Hard to believe it is 7.2% until later. Awesome value.

Absolutely nothing to change here,  Smell: Restrained nose with pine notes and grapefruit/citrus fruit aromas.  Taste:The pine and citrus fruit aromas carry over to the taste. i also pick up some mild caramel notes. I'm not sure if it's the age of the bottle, but the hop notes are more integrated than some of the other IPAs I've had recently.  Mouth-feel: Just on the light side of medium-bodied with a fairly high level of carbonation.  Overall: A good tasting IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,redearth329,4.08,"Served in a tall pilsner glass around 40 degrees F. This is my third one of the night. The first two I had while I was eating some spicy vegetarian chili, which was a good pairing.  Appearance: Medium clear gold color with fine carbonation. 2-3 fingers of dense, cream-colored foamy head at first that settled down to about a half-finger width after a few minutes with substantial lace on the glass.  Smell: Perhaps a bit too cold, as I'm not getting much aroma. Pleasant but mild hop aromas that are balanced between citrus and herbal qualities. Mostly lemony as far as citrus goes, but a bit of grapefruit is detectable. Not much in the way of malts or yeast.  Taste: Very well balanced. Light malts up front with long progressive bitterness from the hops. More towards the herbal side than the citrus. I'm definitely salivating on the finish from the bitterness that I'm experiencing on the sides of the front part of my tongue.  Mouthfeel: my first few sips of this one seemed fairly aqueous, but after it warmed up a bit it's feeling more integrated. Very lingering astringent quality from the hops. Actually, I still feel like some of the flavors are separating a bit about two-thirds of the way through the sip. Man, it does stick to the roof of your mouth on the finish, though! Medium-bodied.  Overall: I suppose they call this an IPA, but I feel like Sierra Nevada tends towards the APA side of things, as far as having earthier hops and a bit more malt presence. This one is no exception, but it does have extremely lingering astringent hop bitterness. This property paired very well with my spicy chili, and I imagine it would also go well with fatty foods such as some pork belly or cheese, etc. Now that I'm drinking it on it's own, though, it's a bit much. I'm going to go see if I have any cheese in the fridge...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Dope,4.18,"A: Pours a beautiful clear ruby red. Enormous and frothy offwhite head. Head fades very slowly; top notch head retention. Quite good lacing as well.  S: Lots of sweet citrus/grapefruit. A little pine and lots of caramel sweetness.  T: Hoppier than the aroma, oddly enough. Loaded with grapefruit. Big, bold grapefruit crispness and bitterness everywhere. There is a pine element backing it up but it's mostly overpowered. Pine shows up more towards the finish and in the aftertaste. Nice sweet caramel malt makes itself known primarily in the finish as well....just prior to a decent wave of bitterness kicking in. Bitter pine and grapefruit floating around between sips.  M: Medium bodied, sticky hops.  O: Very nice IPA. Doesn't smell as pungent as you'd expect but the flavor is quite hoppy and bitter with just enough caramel to back it up and keep it from getting too unbalanced. Relatively simple but well done regardless.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TheDoctor,3.93,"A: Pours a clear orangish honey color that looks like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale does, with a pristine white head that dissipates to a nice film. Decent retention; good spotty lacing.  S: Pretty mellow. Hoppy and delicious dash of nutty maltiness, grapefruit, lemon rind, pine.  T: Rich but refreshing. Malty in general and the tiniest bit nutty but the brunt of the taste is hops. Tastes like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale but there is a noticeable citric hoppy tinge that takes a while to fully form in your mouth.  M: Light to medium body, okay carbonation, kind of dry.  O: Pretty good IPA and for being as cheap as it is it is a great ‘good’ IPA for anytime. Bitter enough but not overly so. Basically something that you graduate to from SNPA. Would get again, worth trying.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DeFaz,4.3,"This is an IPA that has great hop flavor while also being balanced. I think some who will try this ""extra IPA"" will be disappointed because of the balance--they are looking for a very dry and bitter beer with a lot of bite, and this won't deliver. But this is a great IPA because of the complexity of the hops, which leave a somewhat sweet floral and pine taste. No, the ABV isn't very high and the bitterness isn't either, but it's a nice, powerful beer that isn't lopsided. This beer showcases the hops without burning the palate with unchecked hops. The pour is great--a good sized head with very nice retention. I liked the nose for its floral and citrus aromas, which were also present in the taste. And the mouthfeel is spot on--not too bitter, and a thickness and carbonation that are good. Overall, I feel fortunate to find such a high quality beer at a reasonable price. It won't please the IPA fans looking for the boldest, hoppiest brew, but it is likely to satisfy those who recognize that an IPA isn't just about how many hops you can throw in there--it's about complexity, balance, and nuance.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,StrongAleSkeptic,4.17,"A - There's never a disappointing Torpedo pour -- tawny, clear amber body with a thick frothy, pearl head that retains oh so well. Lacing stands so well throughout the entire glass. S - While not as pronounced as I wish this could be, there is some hop bouquet to enjoy T - Citrus hop bombardment right from the beginning! I realize this is an IPA, but for an IPA, its hop profile is so balanced, with a little trending forward. Some resiny, piny character, but mostly citrus, grapefruit, some toffee, lighter malts with a touch of caramel. Some sweet character in there, likely a lil' SG left on the hyrdrometer, but it is oh so balanced. Hops shine through, with just enough malt backbone to propel the bitterness forward. M - This is the epitome of quaffable, sessionable IPA's. Hands down. Just enough of a body to balance and retain the spicy bitterness from the hops, but never too much. I could quaff and quaff and quaff this all the live long day. O - This is probably one of my favorite session beers. It's balanced, not dry, not heavy in body nor light.

140,30420,joeworrall,3.2,"overall, I'm a big fan of the products Sierra Nevada makes: consistent flavor, quality ingredients, reasonable price for a craft beer... but this is only an average IPA. It's not what I would consider an ""Extra IPA"" as listed on the label. Sierra Nevada's website goes into detail describing the ""hop torpedo"" they developed to infuse hop flavor into this beer. Back to the drawing board SN, the hop flavor and aroma in this beer are pretty subdued. It doesn't have any of the bite, or the citrus/pine elements that are found in other IPA's. That said, it's very drinkable and for $13 per 12 pack at TWM, it's a good deal for a craft beer, but if you are looking for an IPA to knock your socks off, you are going to have to spend a bit more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,tkdchampxi,3.86,"Bottom Line: Great example of a typical IPA that emphasizes Hops more than flavor, but still has a nice subtle flavor profile.  Food Pairing Recommendations: Pair with something creamy and rich. Things that have cheese, like pizza or hot sandwiches, go well with this. The beer does not have too much flavor of its own, but the flavors it has are subtle and incorporate well with food without being overpowering.  My Story: I bought my first 12-pk of SN Torpedo, because I was looking to buy SN Big Foot Ale and the liquor store was all out. Needless to say, drinking my first Torpedo while being in the mood for a Big Foot Ale left me sorely disappointed.  Fast forward one week - I was eating cream of chicken and broccoli soup, with a turkey sandwich with mayo and mustard, and I needed a beer to wash it down with. My girlfriend cracked open a cold Big Foot Ale to enjoy, so I decided to crack open one of these. Lo and behold, my second bottle of Torpedo REALLY HIT THE SPOT! Compared side by side, the Big Foot Ale's flavors were too overpowering to pair well with what I was eating and made the experience less enjoyable. On the other hand, the Torpedo was a perfect pairing IPA. Cold, refreshing, and great for using to wash down a big bite of grub.  I'm sold on Torpedo now, and at the $14-15 price for a 12-pk, I'm happy to say that it deserves a place as a household staple.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Cramletram,2.01,"I fall into the minority of, ""Why all the glowing reviews, folks???"" for this particular brew. I've been right up there in agreement with the previous BA reviews I've based beer purchases on until this one. This one puzzles me greatly, as it is my first ""double-u tee eff"" experience with this site. IPA's are my go-to. From regular to hop-tacular, to double, triple, 90, 120-minute, evil, sinister, unforgiven IPA's. Bring on the attacky, hoppy, citrusy aromas. Can't get enough. Unfortunately, SN Torpedo Extra IPA has none of that. I struggle to understand how the term IPA is even associated with this beer. I wanted to love this beer... especially since SN's Pale Ale is so above-average as a mass-produced beer.  The look of this beer is fine. A promising, rich, dark amber, with a respectable head. But anything beyond what my eyes can observe turns negative.  My first reaction to the smell was, ""Really?"" It immediately brought me back to the overpowering, sickly, yeasty smell of going past the Sleeman brewery as a child. It smells skunky, like a Labatt 50 that's been soaking in the sun too long. Definitely lager-esque. But surely, this is a well-respected IPA, so it must not taste like that.  It tastes like that. Maybe the only positive thing I can say is that it tastes like beer, but not any beer I've tasted. Did I get a bad batch? Maybe it sat for a couple weeks in a hot truck during transit?  The nose has a fun bite and attacks my taste buds alright. However, it is not nearly worth the 5 milliseconds of fun my mouth enjoys until my brain deciphers the flavor and has to endure it for another 10 seconds. Overly yeasty. I keep looking for those bright, piney hops and subtle grapefruit. Nowhere to be found. I hate wasting craft beer, so I finished it. Even gave it another shot today before writing the review.  After drinking my first SN Torpedo, I immediately emailed a fellow IPAer to warn him to steer clear. Unfortunately he'd already experienced this beer, but didn't have the decency to warn me. Oh well -- maybe I can save others the trouble. I know how harsh it sounds, but this is easily the most disappointing beer I've ever bought. Sierra Nevada, I know you can do better.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BethanyB,3.84,"Appearance: A light amber, with excellent clarity. The hefty ivory head is determined not to go anywhere, a trend I see with all Sierra Nevada beers.  Smell: The hop smells are of fresh earth, herbs, and spearmint. Not as hefty as other American IPAs, but still fitting for the style. The pale malt provides a solid base for the welcoming bouquet.  Taste: Nothing about the taste reminds me of an ""extra"" powerful ""torpedo,"" but it's definitely a good, albeit surprisingly mild IPA. The hop flavor is more substantial than the bitterness, but it does not disappoint with its complex fresh and earthy profile. The pale malt produces a bit of vanilla sweetness as the beer warms, but this does not detract from the IPA character. Bitterness is mild, and does not linger long in the finish. Would have liked to have tasted more of a bitter ""bite.""  Mouthfeel: Medium fullness, with medium carbonation. Only slightly dry. A good mouthfeel for the flavor.  Overall: A tasty, notable IPA, that I would certainly have again. I would have liked more bitterness...the ""torpedo"" descriptor is definitely misleading!

Lemony citrus and orange peel follow, supported by a perfectly sweet caramel center.  M: Mouthfeel is awesome - full, creamy, yet still effervescent.  O: The big, bitter, older brother of SNPA.

Smell: Hops.  Taste: I love the piney, resinous, liberal amount of hops SN puts into this one. This beer has a depth of flavor character that I can't do justice with my limited-knowledge tongue. It tastes like an IPA fan's wet dream.  Mouthfeel: More of the same (excellence). It has a sticky resinous thing going on that I dig. You continue to taste it after the swallow.  Overall: Torpedo is one of my favorites from one of my favorite breweries. I see this one as a kind of standard I measure other IPAs to. I know it's technically not a ""single,"" but I see ""singles"" with alcohol contents similar to this one all the time. If you've, for some reason, never tried this beer, do yourself a favor.

The hops attack, but don't completely overwhelm, a delicious beer. I would look at it as being quite well balanced, hops dominant, but there is more than that, a overall mild sweetness that takes just enough of the edge off. Would likely satisfy hopheads and balance nuts alike.  Mouth is around medium, the hops bitterness stays on the top of the tongue for some time.

They come to the fire and stay through the finish. Abv is relatively high but doesn't influence the taste. May be a bit hoppy for some, but you wanted an IPA so what do you expect?

140,30420,archyquaffer,4.18,"Poured from the big bomber into a shaker pint. A standard sort of pour yields about an inch of a slightly tan colored froth. This settles down into a frosty lace that's just a bit clingy. (The wake of some indistinct subsurface projectile can be seen rippling beneath the waves). The beer is hazy, and a pale reddish-golden in color. The beer is quite beautiful, with a unique color.  Lots of piney and citrusy hops on the nose, which would make me hesitate on that first sip- if I didn't know any better. The first sip or two is a citrus and pine needle hop bomb, but as the tongue habituates, a rich, somewhat biscuity malt taste manages to come through. The bitterness lingers and is balanced out in the aftertaste by malty burps. The mouth feel is full enough to stand out.  I'm not a hophead but I like this brew. I also like the extra large bomber- good to fill with my homebrew, and a bargain compared to most of the other ammo in the tubes.  Note: after partaking of a bit more of this, my initial impression was perhaps a bit high, so I modified my score. I will say that the hop happiness can be wearing on the palate if you're not a hopeless hophead. I still rate it pretty damn high for the style. Moral of the story: savor brew a little more, THEN run yer damn mouth (or pen, or whatever).  Update: Since my initial review, this has become one of my go-to beers. It's nice and malty, with a very up front hop character but well-balanced and very easy to sip. It is an excellent value, and widely available.

This one is a step up from SN's Pale Ale, with a generous dose of pleasantly tangy IPA bitterness and a higher ABV that normally makes one bottle enough for me. If I were stranded on a desert island with only one kind of beer forever, I would be perfectly satisfied with Torpedo.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Weisseguy1,4.21,"A. Golden amber , more reddish than gold,full head that hangs out while you admire the smell. Plenty of lacing. S. breads malts citrus and little raisin with a slight spice. T. Heavy bitterness, malty goodness and more distinct hop, magnum, citra and crystal to be exact, the combination of these hops make a great tasting burp M. Full mouthfeel, sticky resin flow, cotton mouth O. Awesome beer for hop heads, and wannabes like myself. A simple IPA with an impressive taste",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Succorbenothi,4.58,"A wonderful trip into the Hop Flavored land called Sierra Nevada.  When I first opened the bottle I was assaulted, in a good way, but the heavy hop smell. Then came the tasting. A rush of bitter followed by a serene mouthfeel.  We all know that Sierra Nevada is a great ale, whatever they make. This is a great addition to the family.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jngrizzaffi,4.19,"Pours amber/honey colored with thick foamy head. There is excellent lacing on the side of the glass. Strong citrus and floral smell. You can smell the higher alcohol content as well. Smooth malty taste. You don't get the hoppy bite until the end. More of a piney, resin like hop. Smooth bitter after taste at the end. A very, very well balanced beer. Excellent!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ElijahRivera,3.88,"12 oz. Bottle with no freshness date.  A- Creamy two finger, light tan head. Transparent reddish amber with noticeable but not lively carbonation throughout. Good and decent head retention.  S- Herbal, citrus hops with some mild sweet malt aroma.  T- Very hop forward IPA. I taste hops all the way through. The same herbal/citrus notes I was getting in the nose. Bitter and dry finish with some grapefruit in the aftertaste. Malt backbone is subtle and dominated by the hop profile, but it does offer something in the way of balance.  M- Mouthfeel is really where this beer shine for me. It has a full and creamy body for the style, and an appropriate amount of carbonation.  O- Hoppy and satisfying if not a little lacking in complexity. Great for a tasty buzz from a reasonably priced “Extra IPA”. Certainly worth getting again sometime.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,puboflyons,4.23,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped: 08913-C-21115-S. Sampled on August 3, 2013.  This pours a handsome looking medium amber with great clarity and a full off-white head that lingers for awhile and leaves lacing as it dissolves.  The nose is a hop feast with a great floral and piney ester that makes me realize thism is a high quality IPA. Dimmer biscuit malts on the backside.  The body is bold and decent with a nice smooth texture.  The taste has the briefest flirtation with biscuit and grainy malts but then the hops pour in from the backside and take over everything leaving a solid hop bitterness at the finish. This is one American IPA that other brewers strive to emulate.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JohnnyBarman,4.17,"Single bottle from Premier Gourmet in Buffalo, enjoyed on IPA Day.  Poured into a nonic. Deep amber-caramel in colour, with a half inch of sticky head which leaves some lovely icicles of lace. Great retention on this - quality looking brew.  Nose is citrus (orange and grapefruit), pine, earthy hops, a herbal quality and lots of malt.  Tasty IPA that offers some different flavors to explore. There is a bitter earthy grain to the finish, a sweet citrussy opening, and lots of herbal hoppage in the middle. Generously hopped, to say the least.  Medium bodied, nice assertive carbonation, a bit sticky.  Great IPA, this. Probably my favorite every day Sierra Nevada brew. Big hopped IPA with lots going for it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Tr0janSlay3r,4.38,"Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA is often referred to as the best fair priced IPA. It is consistently stated as a go to beer for many hop-heads out there such as myself. I cannot wait to review this ever so respectable brew. Enjoy!  Appearance- Beautiful golden amber hue to this beer. With the initial pour, there is about a one finger head that seems to be lasting quite a while. Definitely a creamy head but there are some large bubbles. It has low transparency and has medium to high carbonation. Great appearance to this beer.  Smell- With the first sniff of this IPA, I get a reasonable hit of floral and piney hops. With the second waft, I get some tropical hints of orange with a crisp finish to the nose. Final smell with a swirl of the glass there is definitely more presence of bitter hops there is a strong bit of hops in this beer without a doubt.  Taste- Right on the back of the tongue you get a beautiful dry pine and floralness to this brew. Followed directly by that sense of orange that I pick up before with even a little grapefruit possibly. Second sip I get wow way more of the tropical tastes with just a bite of hops to finish it off. Very impressed with the taste especially the dryness on the back of the tongue.  Mouthfeel- Very very smooth to drink for 7.2% it’s totally hidden and well balanced. It is a medium bodied beer that is just light enough to enjoy multiple in an evening. This mouthfeel is how I expect an American IPA to be.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoy this beer and would definitely keep a six pack of this at all times in the fridge. I would recommend it to every craft beer drinker and even to those who are just now exploring the realms of IPA's. There is a bitterness to it but not too overwhelming for anyone. This beer is a two thumbs up. CHEERS!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CarlosDanger,4.1,"This is one of the best readily-available IPAs I've ever had.  The fact that you can wander into an average NYC deli and walk out with this beer is astounding to me. I got one of those awesome ""bomber"" bottles, they're just so darn good to look at.  Very hoppy, almost aggressively so, with a nice bite. Aggressive in a good way.  Fruity, citrusy, refreshing.  Sierra Nevada in my opinion walks a fine line, and to be as popular and widespread as they are, I think this beer is a reminder that they can make some pretty amazing stuff on that large of a scale. I really like this beer and if I'm going somewhere (party/bbq/etc.) and need to grab something to take with me, it's great to know that I can get this in almost any deli or supermarket in my neighborhood.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hokieguy95,4,"Appearance - Deep brassy orange, with good 1 finger head. Nice lacing and a little sticky. Crystal clear.  Smell - Big and piney with some orange peel notes and light esters. Some malt comes through as it warms.  Taste - It's like drinking a big pine tree. The hop bitterness is strong and upfront. I would not call the taste balanced as what SN was clearly going for was a hopfest. Some grape fruit citrus flavors work their way through.  Mouthfeel - Some see this as medium bodied, but I think it is rather light. The ABV is hidden well. Smooth and crisp.  Overall - Torpedo is a great example of the style and an excellent beer with complexity and what every hophead wants. I am an occasional IPA drinker and prefer others with more balanced hop character, but if you wants lots of California style hops, this is the beer to get.  Poured into a snifter",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Haydn-Juby,4.21,A: Honey in appearance with perhaps a finger of white head. Long legs and rings of lacing coat the sides of the glass.  S: Very hoppy with citrus fruits with the highlight being pineapple.  T: Once again a complete hop bomb. Very west coast tasting with bold citrus flavors being very prominent. Pineapple and fresh mango immediately come to mind with perhaps a bit of sweet tasting orange or tangerine in more diminished amounts. Slightly piney and floral as well .Sweet delicate malts are present in the finish and provide a nice balance even with the beer being very hop based.  M: Carbonation is appropriate and moderate as is the body.  O: Very good beer. I wish it was available closer to home. I would probably pick it up every now and again if I could. Thoroughly enjoyed it.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,UncleBart91,4.01,"Appearance: Pours a coppery orange with a decent 1.5 finger head. It has a shine, which could be the extra kick of hops.  Aroma: Yeasty with a well balanced hops. I'm thinking a centennial hops. The smell was definitely misconceiving to the taste.  Taste: Decent hops, somewhat weak for a hophead. I was expecting a mouthful of bitterness, but almost resembled an Arrogant Bastard which is one of my favorite pale ales.  Mouthfeel: Perfect mix of bitterness and citrus blend  Overall: A decent Imperial IPA for 8 bucks a 6er. Definitely a go to beer if you are strapped on cash. Now there should be no excuse for drinking crappy beer because the Torpedo is a fair price. You get more drinking two of these beer than drinking a 6er of any piss water beer. Definitely a good beer at 7.2. Not sure if I would label this beer an imperial, but none the less a great IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,dakotaben,3.35,"A- Clear golden brown and lots of bubbles. One finger of persistent off-white head. Lacing lasts.  S - No overpowering smells, which I would expect from a beer named Torpedo Extra IPA, but the hops are apparent with a spicy, fruity smell in the background  T - Hops and alcohol are apparent along with a toasted, piney taste.  M - Moderate body and carbonation.  Overall - It is a decent tasting IPA and Sierra Nevada is always does well, but this is not my favorite.  It seems that people love this beer, but I just don't see it being a 93 or a 99. I enjoy this beer more than average and will likely drink again, but this just does not excite me as much as everybody else.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smells piney, fruity; the classic smell of a strong IPA  Taste follows the smell. Strong hops but not brutally bitter. Nice citrus. A smooth finish for something that is so hoppy.  Doesn't come off as too heavy, even though it has a lot of flavor.  Very good IPA. Up there with NOLA Mechahopzilla in this price/ABV range.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,beerjerk666,4.47,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Poco Grande glass. Bottled May 16, so it's around 2 months old, although I bought the case and have been drinking it since the middle of June!  Forms a nice fluffy white head with small tight bubbles and some large one's too. Leaves beautiful lacing all over the glass. Bright clear golden color in the body. Nice stream of bubbles constantly rising up from the bottom.  Aromas are HUGE! Pine and citrus - grapefruit, orange peel, pineapple and spruce.  First taste is a bitter pine and grapefruit! The smell = the taste. The hops really come out and there is a nice sweetness from the malts on the end. A great IPA flavor profile. A smooth drinker, just the right of carbonation for me and is a very refreshing IPA.  Overall this is a world class IPA and a go to beer when found fresh. Always available in my area and should always be in the fridge. Such a delicious beer that it's tough to have just one. A very decent representation of a west coast style IPA. Haven't had it? What are you waiting for?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Khoolkat,3.99,I'm new to expanding my horizons beyond macros (only cause I'm cheap). SN beers are always cheaper where I live than any other craft available so why not give it a try. It exceeded my expectations. Will definitely will be a familiar face in my fridge from now on. To pass on this would be to pass on an excellent IPA experience. This is gonna sound weird but I'm not a huge fan of the SN Pale Ale (that's blasphemy to some people I know LOL) and this to me taste so much better.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,VictorWisc,4.08,"Torpedo is one of the most reviewed beers on BA (almost 5700 at last cont) with outstanding ratings. Between local prices dropping beyond belief and ridiculously hot weather, this seemed to be a good opportunity to do a long trial with a 12-pack over several days. Given the official BA review granting it a near-DIPA status, I expected much.  I got a 12-pack with date code 144--that would make it exactly 50 days old today and I've been trying it for the past three days. Sampling involved trying it at different temperatures with/without food, plus an extra store sample from a different batch.  Pours easily out of the bottle without incident. Cold and lightly chilled (38F and 45F), there is almost no head. Warmer (50F and 60F) pours with a finger's-worth of off-white unstructured head. Clear, completely translucent, dark copper color, substantial lacing.  High-ester hop aroma hits you as the bottle cap is popped off, slightly muted once poured in a glass, but still has substantial hop presence. Very floral, mint, licorice, light tobacco note, straw. On aroma alone, would have rated it a 5, with a slight deduction for appearance. But moving on to taste proved difficult.  The first sample was mildly chilled--store-chilled 12-pack, 30 minute drive home, plus a few more minutes for incidentals (about 45F). The first taste is a sharp, strong hop hit. I was expecting hops, but the aroma promised a lot more--on first impression, the taste seemed one-dimensional, bitter, but with no floral or citrus notes. Warmer pours proved better. At 60F, the taste opened up with floral and resinous features, light orange notes, some grass and lots of fairly pleasant bitterness. Not a lot of complexity--expected more, given the variety and composition of hops. No discernible malt flavors despite color suggesting otherwise. Finish still bitter, becoming somewhat boozy and malty sweet, before yielding to off-sour note on the tongue (decomposing residual sugar).  Light-to-medium body, with alcohol more felt than tasted. Light carbonation that quickly disappears but leaves enough effervescence to be pleasant on the tongue. Pretty good mouthfeel, actually, fairly smooth, not quite dry.  Significant variation from the alternate sample (store tasting). The date code on 12-pack was 144, at store tasting--126. Somewhat less floral, but more complex, earthy notes, with less bitterness and smoother finish. It's possible that those extra 18 days made a difference, dulling the hops and rounding out the malt. Don't know. Also could be different storage conditions, different temperatures, etc. Bottom line is that I can't make a final determination from a single 12-pack alone.  This was not quite the benchmark I expected, but a nice every-day IPA, especially given the price. Not sure how long this is going to stay here, but SN 12-packs cost less per bottle, right now, than full cases of Sam Adams, Harpoon and Smuttynose, which are all local (and this one is clearly better than Harpoon IPA, but not in the same league as DIPAs). The high ABV and high bitterness make it an easy one-and-done selection (no session beer this is). But that is really all I can say about it. In a way, it mirrors my reflections on the basic SNPA which I've always found competent but boring. Torpedo is definitely not boring, but it's not a top contender either.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Fl1pzomg,4.67,"What can I say? I love this beer.  It's bold and has a great hoppy front with smooth malt finish. Very floral and crisp and appealing to the nose and the tongue.

140,30420,dar482,4.23,"Bottled on 3058. You only need the first four digits. 3 is 2013. 058 means end of February. Being 4 months old, this beer surely holds up well.  The beer pours out in a rich, deep red orange that is actually quite hard to see through because of how deeply red it is. It has a fluffy finger and a half of off white head.  The aroma has tons of sweet orange and tangerine, then also that juicy tropical mango. There’s sticky sweet caramel malt in there too. However, it may just be the malt sweetness coming through with that hop character in the background, not really the hops dominating your nose.  The flavor packs a wonderful sweetness and tropical fruit flavor at first, which then becomes a combination of the caramel sweetness, then the huge bittering just attacks the tongue. The bittering is huge on the pine . It really is unrelenting on how much pine is in there, which then turns more earthy and almost herbal bitterness.  The combination of the sweet grapefruit and caramel malt with that huge pine bitterness is wonderful. The finish is a bit strong on this one, but still really well balanced and hop forward.  For value, availability, and balance, this is truly a classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Libationguy,4.63,"Reddish-copper in color with some orange hues. Slightly hazy in the glass, but still carries a nice healthy brilliance to the color. Firm off-white head with a nice level of retention.  Loads of citrus, fresh pine needles, resin and some mandarin orange zest in the background. Underneath the hop assault, white flowers, gentle fruitiness, and light malt sweetness. Aromas hang on quite well.  Great structure to the palate of this beer. Very dry with a moderate-plus amount of tannic astringency. Beautiful malt flavor builds through the mid-palate, before being replaced by the hop attack on the back end. The gentle citrus and floral notes come back to linger after the beer is gone. There is a small amount of alcoholic heat that is not covered by the malt in the beer, but overall, a very nice balance.  Mouthfeel is full, rich and very clean. A nice amount of carbonation, without being over the top. The hop attack tends to eat everything else up on the finish. Nice long aftertaste to the beer with the hop bitterness and resin lingering for some time.  If you are a fan of hops, you will not be disappointed by this beer. It is as advertised and gives you a full frontal assault. The wonderful part of this beer is its complexity and overall sense of balance.

More nose hint of hops is evident as it warms and is drunk.  t: Hoppy! No particularly evident flavor, but a powerful hop bite. Pretty strong hop aftertaste. A winsome cedar note evident near the finish.  m: Smooth until the hops hit the taste buds, which is not long!  o: A beer with a built-in wake-up call. I bought a twelver on sale assuming I'd like it as a summer brew because of the reviews. Just about what I expected.

The malt is bread, caramel and honey. Little soap on the nose. Very floral with a touch of yeast . Malt is pretty sweet. On the palate it greets with malt first, then a quick piney bitter then lots of perfumey floral hops. The alcohol is just a bit on the palate. A small bite from carbonation to finish it off dry and a little toasted, sticky and some resin too. I wanted to like this more than I did. It became heavy after a while and hard to drink from the oily bitter on the back palate. The hop perfume translated into the drink astringent and I didn’t care for it.

T - This is a beer that is near-perfect for the style. Huge notes of citrus and pine hop flavor, with solid bitterness, and a smooth malt backbone that compliments without making itself particularly known. There's some sweetness, but not much.  M - Absolutely great mouthfeel. Easy and pleasant, a very mild carbonation sting, and a thin hop oil sheen. Slightly dry, more so as the drink goes on. As thin as it seems at the time, I feel absolutely full. A pleasure to drink.  O - Not much could make this beer better for style. ""Extra IPA"" is a pretty decent qualifier: it occupies a niche between most single IPAs and double IPAs, packing a huge dose of bitterness, but plenty of flavor, and very smooth drinkability. Definitely fits the bill as SNPA's big brother.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Clean balance between citrus, pine and herbal hop flavors and the malt background.  Feel is on the heavier side for a single IPA, but given the ABV that is no surprise.  This is one I used to grab all the time but have not for a while due to my Lakefront IPA and Two Hearted addiction...

S - WOW. Grew a little extra nose hair. Lot's going on. Typical IPA hoppiness, but stronger. Pine, mint, dankness.  T - Very strong IPA taste, and all of it quality. VERY strong. Not much of the subtly sweetness I notice in many IPAs here. Not a bad thing, I suppose. Very little malt noticeable. Mostly hops and a touch of mint.  O - An excellent powerful IPA. I highly recommend.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jaz58,4.29,A good Extra IPA served in a clear pint glass.  Deep orange marmalade colour. Slightly cloudy in the glass.  Thick blonde coloured head with a decent lace.  Nice round mouth feel.  Gentle lemon flavour in the taste.  A decent bitters finish. Not in your face yet a good finish.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Wufdogger,4.68,This is a great 'go to' IPA. I can rely on this beer any time whether from bottle or from tap. Great smell and not too hoppy after taste while still assuring it is an IPA.

140,30420,Pdh32,4.87,"This is a consistently well balanced, well hopped beer. It's my first choice wherever I go.

Just damn perfect. All other ipa should bow to this beast. Pairs well with uhhm...breathing. Mouthfeel is full and creamy like it should be. Nose is like walking through a Christmas tree forest.

140,30420,oi_scout_jessie,4.38,"Appearance: This poured a light brown, slightly orange color. It had a puffy, off-white, 1 finger thick head. And it had a thin lacing that stuck around for a while.  Smell: It had a nice Hoppy smell to it. I could sense a slight citrus and piney smell.  Taste: This was a really tasty brew. The taste went along hand in hand with the smell; but the Hops had a higher presence in the taste. It had a nice hoppy bitterness to it which was directly followed by a smooth malty presence.  Mouthfeel: This beer was very refreshing; it had a nice crisp carbonation to it and it had a medium to full-bodied feel to it. Once the beer was gone, it left a slightly warming and dry taste in my mouth.  Overall: This was definitely a good beer. Sierra Nevada just never seems to disappoint me. This was a solid IPA. It had both, the scent and taste that I was looking for. This left a nice hoppy aftertaste, and I’ll definitely be drinking this again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,barczar,4.03,"Pours a slightly hazy copper with a dense one inch cream head that dissipates slowly, leaving modest lacing.  Grapefruit, pine, resin, and floral hops complement a savory toasted malt backbone to form the aroma. Fresh cut grass and caramel notes emerge.  Underpinnings of muted grapefruit and pine become fairly bitter and resiny mid palate, finishing grassy and moderately bitter. The toasted malt backbone is ever present, but does not outshine the hop profile. The aftertaste is earthy and herbal.  Body is moderate to perhaps a tad full, with moderate carbonation and slight alcohol warmth.  Resin and bitterness dominate overall, but there's a great malt backbone and enough citrus and grassy notes to keep things interesting. Great bang for the buck.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,zac16125,4.12,"12oz bottle into a pint glass No bottled on/best before date. I love Sierra Nevada, but come on guys start bottled dating your IPAs!  No clue how Ive never rated this beer before, so here goes.  A: Pours a crystal clear, quintessential amber with 2.5 fingers width of light khaki colored head that has good retention. Leaves lots of lacing down the side of the glass.  S: Sweet citrus and piney hops, pale malts, some tropical fruits. Pretty good, fairly mild though.  T: Follows the nose except stronger hop characters. Some tropical fruit notes accompany a big piney and citrus rind bitterness. Soapy notes, lemon zest, resinous. Balanced well by a firm malt backbone. Really well done beer.  M/D: Full bodied, moderate amount of carbonation, drying the finish, ABV well restrained, drinkability is good.  O: From top to bottom, a really good IPA. For my money, its one of the best beers you can get in a six pack under $10. Always worthy of a drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Some floral pokes through but I really just love the citrus smell on this beer.  T- My first thought was that this is a very balanced beer. It's got some good complexity to it as well. Not overly choppy, but just right. The malt provides a subtle sweetness and some bready/ crackery character to the taste as well.  M- Full-bodied, creamy, smooth, and slightly slick. Nice.  O- All I can say is this beer is solid.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jdhowe,3.29,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.  A: Pours a clear reddish amber, pretty deep in color for an IPA. A half-finger of light, off-white head dissipates quickly. Minimal lacing is left down the glass.  S: Citrus and pine dominate, but the earth, alcohol, and spice show up, along with something that lingers a little unpleasantly in the nose. It takes me a full 5 minutes of smelling this beer off and on to identify what it is, and, after all of that, I can best describe it as ""earthworm."" Just a little off-putting.  T: The hops are a little weaker here, but still prominent. Thankfully the earthworm is nowhere to be found (not that I'd know, but I don't taste anything too off). Alcohol again shows through very strongly for a beer of a mere 7.2abv -- many 8-11abv beers mask their alcohol much better. Otherwise, the flavor is earthen, maybe a little wheaty or grassy, with a malt sweetness. All-in-all, not too bad.  M: Probably the best part about this beer. Beer is nicely carbonated and has a light, drinkable mouthfeel. Starts and finishes pretty light and smooth, but lingers/coats the mouth quite a bit.  O: Pretty good, but not something I want to have all the time (or even often). Many others seem to like this much more than I did. Even without the earthworm scent, the flavor profile just wasn't really what I wanted, but that's preference. Above average, but not by a lot.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,tikk,4.62,"One of my favorite everyday beers, I try to keep this in my fridge all the time. On to the review.  Pours an amber color with a light, quickly disappearing head.  Smells like a piney, citrusy hop monster.  Taste just builds off the scent. A strong bite of pine and grapefruit, bitter but amazing, the bitterness hangs on lovingly in the finish.  Mouthfeel is nice and light, with good carbonation.  Overall it's a refreshing light beer with a bite, just the way I like it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,45nDown,4.68,Pours into an oversize wine glass an almost dark yellow amber with a puffy off white head. The scent is what it should be like nicely hopped IPA good stuff builds anticipation.

I've had since but not recently (its 7-26-22 today and the last time I had this [at least that I can remember] has to be at least 5 or 6 years ago). Literally no recollection to what this classic tastes like.  Random notes jottes in a wordpad:  Wow thats one of and edging towards one of the best of IPAs that I've drank in the last year-ish (maybe much more). Literally went into with zero recollection of what it tasted like. Smell doesn't match BA description of pine and herbal. I said damn thats all papaya and pineapple fruity. Flavor has so much fucking malty body its awesome, and so well tip toeing back and forth between edging on bitter (pine develops) and sweet (amber toasted malt with just a hunt of molasses and pineapple).

140,30420,who2host,2.41,"I was very disappointed with this one. It tastes nothing like a ""Extra"" IPA, more like a severely outdated domestic malt liquor with a couple of hop pellets thrown in. It was almost hard to finish but I stuck it out. It has an almost metalic taste to it. The smell is off and the mouthfeel is just too syrupy. I'm not exactly sure why this has such a high score.

140,30420,Siriusfisherman,4.52,"Appearance: Deep Amber/Gold with a touch of haze and very good lacing. Nice frothy white head as well, two and a half fingers with a semi-aggressive pour.  Smell: Pungent, spicy, fruity citrus, herbal notes, with a crackery, sweet malt back. Very clean and sharp.  Taste: Very similar to aroma, a big bite of bitterness hits first and then come in pungent notes of herbal spice and fruity citrus, as well as some pine on the finish. The malt makes a nice appearance as well, giving a nice toastiness to the beer that balances out the abrasiveness of the hops.  Mouthfeel: Well carbonated and a slightly oily, medium bodied mouthfeel. Very smooth.  Overall, a great hoppy ale! Not the typical pine/grapefruit character you get from the swarms of other west-coast ipas on the shelf. This boasts a pungent fruity citrus character with big amounts of hop spiciness, as well as some very nice toasty malt notes without getting to sweet. Take into account the ease at which one can find this beer, and that it now comes in 16oz cans, you have a real winner.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,KYGunner,3.94,Copper coloring with a bright white and expansive head this IPA sets up in classic form.  The scent is far too weak for my blood it is a nice piney hop aroma. A light substructure of caramel malt is hidden within.  The taste is nice and smooth and easy and flavorful. Piney hops and earthy tones meld well with the malt backbone. So simple and so easy this is a great starter IPA for the craft beer novice.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,HopHeadRyan,4.67,"A great IPA I've had many times...it almost an east meets west approach. Excellent western clean Hop bite with that heavier caramel backbone I'd expect from the east.  A - Shiny coppper with a minor amount of haze, excellent head, fades down a bit to a nice layer and great lacing  S - Fresh herbaciousness, fresh mint leaves, pine and a hint of citrus - its not in your face but very nice. The whole cones did their thing!  T - Excellent flavor...nicely balanced but a lingering bitterness that hopheads like me drool over. Delicous bright caramel sweetness to balance the agressive hop character. Definitely pine with a kiss of tropical fruit. Very nicely done but still agressive and maybe too much for most newbys.  M - A little heavier...not too syrupy but close...if you drink it too warm youre gonna have a syrupy tasting beer. If its cold enough (but not too cold) its fine.  Ovearll - A great ipa that blurs the extremely bright hop forward IPAs of the west with the extremely malt forward darker ipas of the east.

140,30420,KickInTheChalice,4.21,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip.  Torpedo pours a golden caramel color, hazy with a full, frothy white head. A nice spiderweb of lace is left on the side of the glass as the beer wanes.  The aroma has a general citrusy tone to it, with grapefruit, tangerine, and orange blossom notes. There is a spicy pine presence as well. A little bit of sweet pale malt exists in the background.  Each sip starts with pale malt with a light honey sweetness. The hop presence moves in soon thereafter, with a balance of citrus and pine hop flavors. Sierra Nevada does such a good job of providing a well-rounded and robust hop flavors. The grapefruit and pine come through the strongest, with tangerine and oranges as well. The finish is bitter but clean.  The carbonation is vibrant and consistent with what I want from the style. There is a little bit of hop residue that is left in my mouth after each sip. It is a smooth and balanced IPA.  Overall, this is a nice and balanced IPA. A rounded aroma and flavor and smooth mouthfeel make this a solid beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,lordofstarside,4.21,"12oz to a pint glass, bottled 038...so February 7th? Anyway, somewhere really close to three months ago, should still be acceptably fresh  Pours a very dark gold with a finger of foam. Good visibility, though very clouded with yeast particles that probably would be absent had this been more fresh. Retention has dropped to a light froth covering the top after about three minutes, good lacing  Smells of juicy hops offering almost exclusively earthy pine aromas. Some citrus squeezes through the cracks, but this thing really reminds me of the mountains. Robust malty backbone has a nice grainy caramel and a splash of alcohol, comes together well  Taste is on the nose pretty well, upfront piney hops with some floral undertones. Sweet malt that's noticeably present yet quietly subdued followed by a touch of alcohol. Pretty good  Mouth is good also, very crisp with a strong filling medium body. Very bitter, very drinkable  Overall this beer is pretty great. My first time having it was six years ago in high school, and I remember having trouble drinking it without gagging. Now I'm 23 and I wish it was even more bitter than it is now. Oh how the times change! This stuff would be a lot better fresh, which is hard to do because it's a staple beer at every gas station and grocery store. When it's always on the shelves and so little people drink it, it's hard to find fresh. Anyway, depending on the date it can make it's way into my regular ipa circle, must try for hop heads",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Jacurdy60,4.23,"A-Pours a pale amber color with a thin, but creamy, white head that retains fairly well. Quite a lovely looking brew  S-Notes of pine hit the nose first and is followed by sour grapefruit, lemons, and a touch of malted sweetness round it up.  T & MF-The piney notes mellow out at the front of the palate and the bitter grapefruit takes over for a brief moment. Astringent hops take over after the brief grapefruit appearance, which is followed by a pleasant alcoholic bite. Body is thick for an IPA, very creamy. Finishes crisp with a flash of malted sweetness. Very smooth and rich for an IPA. I like it. A lot.  O-Absolutely exceptional. Mildly complex, but nothing you will have trouble deciphering. The mouthfeel is perhaps the best of an IPA I've ever had and it still finishes crisp. Hops aren't too in your face either, but they are definitely present. The alcohol is hidden exceptionally well, too. SN did it again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

It has a bitter aftertaste. But both the hoppy flavor and the bitter aftertaste are not overpowering. Very good balance for a 7.2% ABV Extra IPA geared towards hopheads.  M - slightly creamy, medium carbonation  O - Although I wish it was slightly less bitter, this is a very good beer. All hopheads should check this beer out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T - Hops right out of the gate. Pine, pepper, and a citrus thread throughout. Wide spectrum. There is a malt element that keeps this very drinkable. Bready but not biscuity and dry.

It was very different to the lagers I'm used to drinking. After a while, it grew on me and was able to drink it with ease.  The main thing I like about this beer is that it actually tastes like beer, not a watered down carbonated drink such as Bud Light. Even thought it's alcohol content is higher than usual, I can't taste the alcohol in this one as much as in other beers. What I do taste is the strong aroma and rich complex flavors.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jschwanke84,4.18,"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Live review.  A: Pours an attractive dark amber and copper color. Pretty clear. Half a finger white head that dissipates in about 30 seconds. Leaves a nice lace. Very inviting.  S: Pine and citrus dominate. Faint hops and pear scent. A bit resiny. Pretty average for an IPA.  T: Pine and citrus again dominate here and I can really taste that hint of pear. Tastes very much like it smells. Hop forward with a nice toasty malt finish. Solid bite at the end that I love in an IPA. Perfectly balanced between pine and citrus. Really enjoy this flavor.  M: Medium body. Slightly chewy but still rests well all over the palate. Pretty good carbonation but maybe a bit under what I would expect in an IPA.  O: Nice dark amber color is very attractive but an average scent is a bit disappointing. Smell of pine and citrus with a bit of pear is nice but not nearly hoppy enough for an IPA. Redeems itself greatly in the taste department. Wow! Piney and citrusy with the pear underlay is amazing. More hops than you would expect based on the scent, but very hop forward with a nice smooth toasty malt finish and a bite. This amazing taste outweighs the disappointing scent and average body.

140,30420,estlinska,4.55,"Poured from the bottle to a tulip glass on 4/14/13. The color of this beer is a deep orange to amber, like thick pine sap. It is quite lively in the glass with lots of carbonation evident. The light penetration is pretty good; no haze or sediment evident. There is a thick 2cm of sandy white colored head to the top of the glass, but dissipates rather quickly. Lacing is pretty thick throughout the glass. The smell is almost exclusively hops. The malt is muted and maybe lends a caramel sweetness. The hops, like in most good IPAs, takes the front row in this show. The most dominant note at first if the piney and resinous prototypical smell of a good northwestern IPA. Then there is the sweet tropical fruit that is muted at first, but blossoms throughout the glass as it warms a little. There is lots of juicy oranges and nectarines especially as you continue to smell it. The taste is definitely showcasing the hops for sure. The pine is there up front, but then the citrus takes the bulk of the flavor. The juicy oranges and nectarines are there still and are the star of this show. There is a good, strong bittering backbone that plays balance to the muted caramel malts. The caramel malts are sweet, but I would like a little more to handle the hops. The mouthfeel is very dry, very bitter, and has a good body.

140,30420,Hendry,4.27,"Transparent light rusty orange hue with a generous foamy head. Nose is middle of the road, has a nice piney aroma with a touch of grapefruit peel in there with some bready notes.  Nice crisp flavors here, reminds me of the McNeil's Sunshine IPA: basic, but a darn good, no frills IPA that is kind on the wallet. The tartness factor comes into play, but that shouldn't scare off IPA fans that crave that element.  Beware of price differentials on the bomber: a local supermarket sells them for $5, but some of my favorite beer stops sell it for $3. The aftertaste is pleasant but not overly long lasting, somewhat sticky and resinous with decent carbonation going on. Overall there a solid drinkability factor going for Torpedo that eludes the $3 price tag and tops a number of $4-$6 bombers I have tried. Put this one on your list, as Sierra Nevada proves that a quality IPA doesn't have to empty your wallet to be enjoyable. High marks for overall value and quality @ $3/bomber,very solid.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hockeymatt,3.71,"I figured I would do this as my first review. I am not an expert yet, so don't review my review too harsh.  Okay, I wanted to do this as a first review because it's a beer that sticks out in my mind. I will start out with what I like: It has a very citrus taste to it. Very clearly stronger than your average beer. Leaves a slightly bitter citrus aftertaste that for some reason I really enjoy. The smell and taste both have a hint of pear, but the aftertaste really leaves you feeling like you just took a big bite out of a pear. Very pleasant. Would be an excellent beer to have alongside a savory meal, I imagine.  Neutral: It pours, looks, and smells very run of the mill. Once you taste it you see it's very much not run of the mill, though it may not be for everyone. If you don't like bitter beers, you may not like this one.  Negative: Not a lot to say, but I will mention that is a very characteristic beer, I think your Average Joe will either love it or hate it. It would not be something I would stock at a party unless you know the participants have already tried it or a similar drink and enjoyed it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,stephenjmoore,4.26,"A- Medium amber body with a frothy cream colored head. Somewhat cloudy, but transparent enough to see carbonation bubbles rising through the body.  S- Lots of piney cascade hops with some citrus and some sweet malt. Slight earthy aroma apparent as well.  T- Great balance of piney hops with just enough of a malt backbone. Rich and bready, but hop-forward at the same time.  M- Full bodied, medium carbonation, great feel.  O- One of those distinctive, timeless IPAs.

140,30420,--Dom--,4.33,"When I think of what makes a great beer. I think of a few things. Is it available? Is it affordable? Does it check all my boxes? Torpedo meets those standards, and then some. I couldn't care less about an amazing beer being brewed half a world away that I'd have to move heaven and earth just to taste. Give me a beer that is big on ABV, massive on taste, and always $7.99 at the grocer down the street. Checking my boxes? Big hoppiness-check... good malty backbone-check... high ABV-check..... low price-check.... God bless whoever makes this beer because I honestly can't imagine a life of beer-advocacy without it. Don't you ever stop making this SN, it's as American as apple pie, except apple pie doesn't get me drunk, but Torpedo does.

Moderate to full body with light carbonation Pretty decent.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JohnF,4.31,Great IPA and readily available. Stronger than the original Sierra Nevada and darker plus more bitter.

140,30420,Roman5150,3.99,"Bottle from Frugal Mcdougals in Nashville, TN.  Appearance: Amber, cloudy, with a slight off white head.  Smell: Piney, very coast coast IPA typical smell, hops really hit your nostrils on this one, and it smells pretty damn good.  Taste: This beer has a lot of hops. Very tasty hops at that. This is what I think a typical west coast IPA should taste like, although not quite as good as Stone IPA. The alchohol comes through a lot more on this one than say a Two-Hearted, its not quite as balanced, but it's still very drinkable. It tastes more like an 8 or 9% IPA. Subtle citrus initial taste followed by a slightly bitter, yet still smooth hop aftertaste.  Overall: I will probably buy this again, as it was on sale for $9 a 6-pack. It does the west coast IPA style very well, however, it does not compare to a Two Hearted or Stone IPA. I would reccomend anyone that has a fondness for a well crafted, hoppy beer, to give this a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JMScowcroft,4.67,"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. - Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA  I tend to be skeptical about the major craft brews that are available all over, but this brew set me straight. This is one of my ""bucket list brews"" and it is a great addition to the beers I have had.  Look - Pours hazy amber/copper with a full, foamy head. Great lacing. Minimal carbonation.  Smell - Floral, pine, and citrus hops with malt underneath. Good all around blend. Nothing stands out but high quality nonetheless.  Taste - Mirrors the smell. Each sip picks up a different hop among floral, pine, citrus, and resin flavors, all over a snappy carbonated bite with malt riding underneath. Torpedo is right!  Mouthfeel - Hops rest nicely while the malts fade, not too sticky. Good drinkability.  Overall - Phenomenal brew by Sierra Nevada, I enjoyed the blending and feel on this one. Two thumbs up, would recommend.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hopfen,3.1,"Picked up a bomber for $3.49 at Winco while doing some grocery shopping this weekend. All the great things Ive heard about this brew I had to give it a shot.  A- Poured into a tall tulip golden hazy honey with a thick clumpy head. Interesting.  S- Hoppy, piney, with a light grapefruit back bite. Nothing hit me as wow, good aroma, but not a home run by any means.  T- I was expecting to like this a lot more than I did. It had a nice hoppy kick with some hints of citrus and flowers. There were moments of real good followed up by not so good. Im not quite sure what it was but this just wasnt doing it for me. Actually became a struggle to finish.  M- Aha! Heres the culprit. Can you say medicine? Thats how it felt in my mouth, syrupy, thick, oily. Not very pleasant. Almost wanted to do a drain pour but stuck with it.  O- Dissapointing to say the least. The mouthfeel just killed this brew for me. A barely average experience that I wont be revisitng very soon. Interestingly the score and reviews just didnt coincide with what I tasted.

140,30420,YardmanFTB,4.54,"I've tried this beer in both can (tall) and bottle (12 oz) servings. The 7.2% ABV is hidden/blended very well for a smooth finish on the malt/alcohol end. While the IBU level is not off the charts (65), it finishes very hoppy due to the abundance of aromatic and dry hopping via the ""Hop Torpedo"".

T: Smooth, excellent crispness, piney, with hop bitterness, citrus, grass, toasted bread, jammy fruit, herbal, drying finish. Lovely finish. A hike in California.  Feel: Medium bodied, good weight. Great tongue tingle and finish. Like a well balanced friend, between sweet and bitter, and a clean, sunny finish. Alcohol is very subtle. Be careful because you dont notice it!  Overall: Let it warm, let it come to 55 degrees. Try it with different foods and friends.  Great with most foods. Tonight with Pasta & meatballs, but fish, cheese, sausage, lamb - all work.

As for taste, I will qualify this by saying taste is, admittedly, subjective. This just doesn't work for me. I do prefer balance in my IPA but can still appreciate a really hoppy IPA. This one, while very popular, just doesn't work for me.  Medium mouthfeel.  Overall, I've picked it u before and realized it wasn't the IPA for me. I picked it up by mistake this time and decided to review it. I know there are many who love it but it just doesn't work for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,MisSigsFan,4.16,"Pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a white head that leaves a lot of lacing. Smell is mostly of pine and citrus, your usual West Coast IPA flavors. Taste is mostly of pine as well with a good amount of bitterness that lingers for a while. A bit underwhelming when it comes to flavor though. I wish there were more citrus and floral notes in there, but the flavor seems to pass pretty quickly. Mouth is smooth, maybe a bit too heavy, but with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall this is a pretty good IPA, but nowhere near the best I've had. I've always been slightly disappointed with Sierra Nevada's offerings, and this isn't an exception. I always find myself comparing different IPAs to Stone's and this is one that just doesn't come close. The balance seems slightly off compared to other IPAs I've tried, most notably Green Flash Imperial IPA, Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, and of course Stone IPA.  Re-review 4/19/2015  Pours orange in color with a huge white head that leaves tons of lacing. Smell is grapefruit, orange, pine, and bready malts. I get a very ""beery"" smell from this. Maybe it's the yeast, but something about it reminds me of a macro. Taste follows the nose. Just a bit of mango in there as well. Really bitter. Maybe a little too malty for my IPA tastes. Mouthfeel is pretty good, if a little thick. The bitterness lingers a bit too long as well. Overall, this is a very good IPA. I was a bit too harsh on it last time. It's been a few years since I've had it last and my palate has really evolved. I'm able to appreciate this beer a lot more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,sam_bliss,4.28,"A little off-white head covers a visibly carbonated, rich, deep copper brew. Smells of pine and soapy hops, caramel malts, and some red fruity yeast scent. It tastes of ruby red puckering grapefruit. A few sips in, the circular lacing is spectacular. There's a bitter-sour hop aftertaste, but malts in the mid-mouth adequately balance out this extra IPA. Some earthy and roasty flavors ground soaring scents of an excellent hop mix. The carbonation is milder than I expected, just a little tingly and perfect for the beer and style. Medium, pleasant mouth feel.  This is a great IPA, with a fuller and stronger version of the Sierra Nevada signature, most brilliantly displayed by SNPA. Love it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,standardcherry,4.2,"On tap at some weird bar in Miami. This was surprisingly fresh though.  A: Nice amber color. A bit hazy but not much. Nice white head that lingered for a while. S: Fresh pine, citrus, and spiciness dominates. A nice malty aroma to back it up as well. T: Excellent tongue bashing hops. I get the first huge hope bite that later balances out with the sweet malts. A nice pine and citrusy taste followed by some grassiness and malty sweetness. A bit of an alcohol bite as well. M: A bit heavy. Syrupy. Reminds me of fresh 120 minute. Sticky, resinous and a bit dry. Carbonation was great for the style. O: A great beer that was only hindered by the syrupy mouthfeel.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smells like pine resin, grapefruit, pineapple, and slight bready malt.  I don't get any malt in the taste here, just a big hop explosion. There's a good amount of spicy and peppery hops, a good amount of searing pine bitterness. This is balanced out by some juicy orange and grapefruit citrus flavors. This definitely has the classic Sierra Nevada hop flavor to it- rustic and earthy, and very full- due to the use of whole-cone hops, I'd guess.  This one is medium bodied, with a higher amount of carbonation, a crisp and juicy mouthfeel. This one is really, really drinkable for it's intensity.

The torpedo is well balanced, brewed with delicious hops, and is available at an affordable price. Citra Hops are the best. The balance between the bittering hops and tasty subtle citra flavors make this IPA almost perfect. Against any other mass produced IPA the Torpedo towers over all.

140,30420,Hopinista,4.43,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass.  A: Pours a nice honey amber color, just a touch cloudy, nice head that stays a while and leaves a nice abstract pattern.  S: It has a delicate piney hop aroma, the smell is really subtle compared to the taste.  T: The smell gives no indication to the massive amount of hops you get right up front. Very nice and fresh punch of hops, followed by a good amount of bitterness that's balanced well by the slightest bit of sweetness at the end. This is probably the most refreshing IPA I've had in recent memory.  M: Light and nicely carbonated, but a little cloying and syrupy, this is the only downside to this beer.  O: I really enjoy this beer, I love the excessive amount of hops SN is accustomed to using. The ABV is at 7.2% which is right around where I like my beer. The only thing that keeps me from absolutely loving it is the syrupy feel on the palate, keeps it from being truly sessionable in my opinon.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Andrew041180,4.15,"A - Poured into what I believe is a pilsner flute. The beer is mostly a dark copper with some orange highlights. An inch or so of bubbly head recedes slowly and leaves nice lacing on the glass.  S - I detected mostly tropical hoppy notes in this one, pineapple and mango mostly. There was some pine in the background and a hint of sweet malt.  T - Nice combination of the smells, but in reverse. The pine was much more pronounced, particularly on the finish. This one was nearly three months old, not sure if some of the other flavors have faded by this point. Torpedo is rounded out with a strong bitterness, but not one that over-exerts itself.  M - Medium bodied with a fairly clean finish considering how much pine I detected. Very drinkable.  O - Torpedo was one of the beers to convince me that the search for better beer was a worthy pursuit. Since my first Torpedo over a year ago I have found better, but few that combine the price, flavor, and drinkability as this one. It has, and will continue to be, a staple in my refrigerator.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Pours an orange/red and somewhat cloudy. Big frothy head. Lacing and head continued as I drank, even to the last sip--impressive!  Floral, piney and sweet malt.  Just enough grapefruit, resin and sweet malt. Hop aroma is vibrant in every sip. Maybe some sharp fruitiness.  A thick resinous, bitter, malty libation that covers well.  This is a perfectly balanced IPA. Hops, bready malt and a sweetness that works. This is a Sierra Nevada classic I've been going to for the past few years, over and over. This needs to be had fresh.

Head was very soapy and stiff, reluctant to dissipate, left light lacing.  S - aroma of delicous fresh hops dominates, pine, citrus, and slight fruity, a nice malt aroma is present as well, overall though the aroma is a little subdued.  T - delicious, massive fresh flavoring hops up front with a more than adequate bitter finish. hop profile in the taste is on par with the smell, nice pine, citrus and fruity taste. Malt character is there in the back ground lending some sweet support. There is also a nice fruity yeast character that creeps up as it warms adding to the mix. Freshness is very tangible here, the finish is bright, and each refreshing sip reinforces his freshness, superb.  M - the mouthfeel is medium for the style, a little syrupy. The malt is more present in the feel than the taste, finishes a little sweet despite the Bittering hops, making it interesting and very enjoyable.  O - Sierra Nevada never lets me down with their egregious use of hops. Their ales are always fresh tasting, easily attainable and fairly priced. Although IPA/DIPA is my favorite style of beer that I'm always chasing down new examples I haven't tried, at the moment this would be my goto IPA to just buy a 12 pack of and have around the house.

M Medium, almost full due to the malt. Smooth finish.  O Not bad at all. On the Sierra Nevada spectrum, this sits somewhere in the middle.

A - Pours a somewhat murky amber color with about one finger's worth of head hanging out on top. Some fairly significant lacing.  S - Very fruity peach hop smell. Some dry malts, but faint and far away. Smells kind of like a Peach Faygo or a dirty sock, if you ask me.  T - Initial blast of hop bitterness. A very bitter IPA and very malty also. Fairly well balanced. Floral tasting in the beginning, and then finishes off with somewhat of a spicy hot, wet-hopped kind of taste. Fruity sugars are present, but they are placed well in the background, away from the potent hop bitterness. Some honey makes itself known near the end. Not a bad beer, but simple.  M - Sticky, dry, resinous mouthfeel. Some sweetness & green apple sugars present in the near end, just a pretty dry aftertaste. Nicely bodied, and well-balanced.  Not overly carbonated, and with a nice 7.20% abv it is definitely drinkable, although I have had this beer and the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, and I do feel that these brews are somewhat overrated. A good beer for being a year round offering, but there are far more interesting brews to be had.

Head dissipates relatively quickly into a film. Definite fresh citrus aroma from the hops. Lemons prevail, along with grapefruit and maybe a touch of sweet Kiwi fruit.  Body is perfect for an IPA - Not too malty and not thin either. very balanced.  There is an aftertaste that lingers in the throat for awhile. This is pleasant and leaves me wanting more.

A: Massive head on this gal... about 2-3 fingers at least. The brew was a toast brown-orange color, extremely murky, and kinda dangerous looking.  S: Sorta had the same fresh clean linen scent as the standard Pale Ale which suited me fine. Still, lots of zippy citrus (orange in particular) came through as well.  T: I tasted VERY similar to the Pale Ale on the front end, but teeth-stainingly bitter at the end, which is certainly a hophead's dream. I wouldn't categorize the hop profile as piny though. Yeast with liquified plant stems might be a better descriptor.  M: Like I stated, bitter, but the drinkability is fine if your used to a lot of the hop bombs out on the market.

140,30420,Guyute,4.22,"This is my go-to beer these days. The local grocery store has twelvers for $14.99 so I can't rationalize buying something else. Extra IPA really defines this beer. Lots of hops, a little bit sticky mouthfeel. Smells awesome, piney, hoppy, you get the idea. Not quite balanced enough to be world class, but really, for hopheads this is a sure bet.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Jugs_McGhee,3.58,"16 fl oz can served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass in Los Feliz, California. Acquired as part of a four pack at a local Von's grocery store. Expectations are average. I don't recall the cost.  Served straight from the fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  Paired with salted hard pretzels.  A: Pours a five finger beige colour head of nice cream, pretty good thickness, and very good retention for the high ABV (~5-6 minutes). Body colour is a clear translucent textbook copper. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Pretty typical of the style; there's nothing unique or special here. Standard fare, though the head retention exceeds expectations.  Sm: Evocative floral hops, nectary hop character, dominant grapefruit citrus, and hop bitterness. Pale malts. A bit too assertive and seemingly imbalanced, but conventional for middling examples of the style. A fairly strong aroma. I'm excited to try it.  T: Floral hops, messy grapefruit citrus, and overwhelming hop bitterness. Lacks balance; it's really off. A slight nectary touch on the climax is the best attribute of this beer. Light hop oil notes. The grapefruit is rather poorly executed. Lacks complexity and subtlety. The entire third act is just plain bitterness, irritating the palate. I'm not a fan. No yeast character or alcohol comes through, however. Whatever hops were selected for this beer were a poor choice; that or it's just poorly brewed. Pale malts form the foundation.  Mf: Smooth and wet. A bit nectary. Overcarbonated. Independent of that wretched bitterness, the mouthfeel is actually quite pleasant. Decent presence on the palate.  Dr: An imbalanced IPA and an underwhelming beer from Sierra Nevada. I wouldn't get this again unless in a pinch.  High C-  *** 03/21/17:  Had a bottle in a variety 12 pack.  C / AVERAGE  *** 02/15/20: bought a sixer of bottles at a Walmart since I wanted beer late after work and this seemed like the best option:  Currently ranked #85 in the top American IPAs list...seems like I owe it another fair shake.  Drinks floral and oily with some grapefruit bitterness and pith livening up its 2-row pale malt backbone. Some subdued pine is in there too...I'd figure this for Centennial hopped but apparently it's Crystal, Citra, and Magnum. I don't think it showcases Citra well (lacking the varied citrus profile that hop imparts and only really offering grapefruit in terms of citrus fruit notes) and I think of Magnum as a bittering hop almost entirely so I guess the pine I'm getting is from Crystal.  Digging into the Crystal hop flavours, this does taste a bit woodsy and herbal, with hints of hop spiciness trickling in on the back end as well. Its complexity is adequate, but I find even Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale has a bit more going on while being better balanced, and their Celebration Ale is far more complex yet lacks the woodsy subtleties this seems to provide. It's certainly a better IPA than I remembered...  Smooth, wet, medium-bodied, oily, perfectly carbonated, refreshing. Hides its ABV quite well.  I always remembered this beer as being simple and a bit too bitter. Maybe my palate for hop bitterness has shifted or maybe I've just realized and understood the subtle woodsiness of its hop profile suddenly, but this is - even drinking a Walmart bottle packaged almost 3 months ago - a lovely and serviceable IPA with plenty to offer the discerning drinker at a crazily reasonable price point. I wouldn't count it amongst the 100 best IPAs out there. but it's a shockingly well-executed beer given its price, widespread availability, and the scale on which it's brewed.  High B- / WORTHY  *** 01/11/21 sixer from a Total Wine for $7.59 USD plus tax. Packaged 11/12/20.  Woodsy and piney with a floral hop burst and a clean pale malt/2-row malt backbone. Myrcene hop oils. Ludicrously drinkable for its 7.2% ABV...I could drink a few in a sitting (and I plan to).  Impeccably well balanced. Aptly medium-bodied with a coating mouthfeel that accentuates the oily pine and myrcene.  An IPA I ought to add to my regular rotation...possibly the best bang for your buck in the style outright.  B+ / VERY GOOD  *** 01/24/21 $7.59/sixer is tough to pass up...  Woodsy and herbaceous with a firm 2-row malt backbone and just enough caramelized malt to give it an even balance of malty caramel sweetness and hop bitterness.  A classic IPA and a hell of a good bargain.  B / GOOD",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,khensley,4.77,"Amazing beer, unbeatable price. Looks like an IPA, a bit on the darker side, white head pours a beautiful bed of bubbles that sit around for the entire duration, lacing is as expected from Sierra. Some sedimentation, but who cares. Smells pitchy, rich. Tastes even, balanced, with a firm spine of hearty ole' fashioned cake doughnuts, washed away quickly by damp, piney notes of hop bitterness. The bitterness will linger only until the next drink, and it starts all over again. Feels plenty big, bigger than the gravity it boasts. If it's high quality IPA you desire, and a price that wont send you to the poor house, Torpedo might be a mainstay in your fridge. It is in mine. I cant find a better IPA for even close to the price.

Poured a clear copper color, produced a thick off white head, excellent retention and it left a very nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma of this ale contained large amounts of citrus. Medium bodied , this AIPA had a foundation of malted grain that was overpowered by bitter piney hops, and citrus )mostly grapefruit.)- there is also a slight hint of spice (white pepper) Excellent mouthfeel, very smooth- Semi dry finish. Excellent example of an American craft brewed AIPA, use of only American Hops and a special technique of dry hopping make this a great session beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - lots of hops and citrus, along with a touch of sweetness  T - follows the nose well, a ton of beautiful hops and grapefruit. I taste a little lemon/orange for the citrus along with the obvious grapefruit, followed by a little sweetness, has a bit of a bready finish (which I think makes it more drinkable)  M - medium/heavy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.

140,30420,MCain04,4.08,"Long time drinking this brew, figured I should write a review. 12 oz bottle poured into a Mikasa wide-based tulip. Not sure of the freshness. Off the shelf for $8.99/6pack  Appearance: An opaque amber/orange with 1 finger of off-white head, excellent lacing, modest retention.  Smell: I don't know if there's a more classic hop profile than SNPA's. This smells just like SNPA does. Extra grassy and piney, not much citrus. Somewhat more subdued than I recall.  Taste: Hops taste are forward but far from overwhelming with more grassy notes. Not too malty. Bitterness on the finish is nice. Well-balanced, but not exceptional tasting.  Mouthfeel: Exactly what you want out of an IPA: Crisp, smooth, and dry. Moderately carbonated.  Overall: I may have had this one a little less than optimally fresh, but still enjoyed it. This is a solid IPA that I turn to time and time again for the value, availability, and reliability. Nothing mind-blowing, but gets a lot of points for balance and drinkability.

M- Nice carbonation-not too much, but just the right amount for the style. The body is actually pretty light considering the 7.2% ABV although I would say it is about in the middle.

Not getting much citrus which you get a bit of on the nose. Really bready.  M: Medium bodied with a fluid like feel. Bready and malty on the feel.

That is because Sierra Nevada has always been recognised more as more of a mainline brewer than a micro-brewer and one just comes to expect potent ""craft beer""perfections from short-run micros. NaDa! I have had several impressive offerings from this company BUT the Torpedo absolutely EXCELS as a season-round, readily available IPA. It has all the markings of a top shelf, microbrewery craft IPA: Strident sniff, malty mouthfeel and the longlasting romp through the meadows of a hop aftertaste! True to the IPA profile in all categories and style expectations. But what I found most amazing was the LONGLASTING hop kick aftertaste - it is POSITIVELY EQUATING to an amorous afterglow! I've found very expensive IPA and 2xIPA microbrews coming up quite short and soundly failing in this style profile. If you fail anything else in this style, you must AT LEAST have the AFTERGLOW...and this mass produced IPA has it in spades. Granted - I've found several microbrewed IPA's and 2x IPA's that defeat this offering - but NOT at this price and at this nationwide, season round supply!

Slightly off-white head that crowns the brew and settles down a bit, leaving a nice bit of lacing most of the way down. Aroma is heavy with hops all the way up and down; pine-like in character, resinous, a touch oily, leafy, very slightly floral. Malts were present but merely a supporting role that became a bit stronger as the beer went on. Citrus, grapefruit, orange peel, all being tossed about as well.  Taste is a nice personification of the aroma, hitting first with a nice hop bitterness that tingles the taste buds; full of pine and resin, they slowly cascade into an array of citrus flavors, most notably grapefruit and orange zest. Some grassy and oily notes on the edges as well. Malt oversees the whole process in a biscuit-like form, adding some structure from which to build on, as well as some sweetness to counteract the hop bitterness. A slight touch of spice from the hops fades as the beer goes on, but the aftertaste is always resounding with a nice 50/50 mix of leftover pine resin, wet fruit, and sweet bread. Alcohol is noticeable at times, seemingly random times, but it never hinders or becomes harsh - it's simply a bit-part. Medium body with a reasonable amount of carbonation.  Celebration may be my favorite SN brew, but this one is pretty damn good and it's available year round.

Taste: Man, these hops are great. The beer is a double IPA, so it's obviously got the bitter hoppiness aspect, but there's a discernible malt presence as well that balances it out perfectly. It has a bit of piney taste, as well as a faint grapefruit hint. No, I promise I wasn't just paraphrasing the label. A rare instance of truth in advertising... Refreshing!  Mouthfeel: The medium body on this one gives way to a little bit of an oily finish, which isn't offensive.  Overall: I may be a new fanboy of Sierra Nevada. This beer kicks ASS.

140,30420,TheCondor,4.23,"A classic Sierra Nevada brew. Those guys have made a killing on Pale Ale and their IPA's. No introduction needed. Poured with moderate vigor from the bottle into a glass.  Appearance - Pours a cloudy orange/copper color, difficult to see through. Carbonation can be seen heading to the head from the bottom of the glass. Nice two finger head eventually recedes to one finger, but it stays there for the whole drink. Nice and foamy, stick to your nose kind. Awesome lacing is like glue on the sides of the glass. Very impressive presentation.  Smell - Just what you would expect out of an IPA, no slack from Sierra Nevada here. Big floral notes intermixed with powerful citrus and pine make for a delectable scent.  Taste - Just like the nose, nice amounts of strong hops in there. I am not a hop head, generally don't drink IPA's and such, but I had to try it. Very well balanced. The citrus is the first hit, followed by nice herbal and floral tastes and rounded out by the piney resin. Awesome tasting beer.  Mouthfeel - Finishes clean, crisp, dry, and semi-bitter, just like I would expect. Love it. Light bodied, medium carbonation.  Overall - This is an excellent beer, if you didn't read the average ratings up top and skipped straight to my review. Highly recommended for hop heads and average doods alike. Not too much hops to overwhelm you (i.e. Ruination), but enough to let you know this is certainly a big IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,lizzlethenurse,4.03,"I drank this right out of the bottle, so I can't really comment on the head.  The smell is just absolutely wonderful - very hoppy, but not overpowering, with almost a faint pine scent hiding behind the hoppiness. There's a slight citrus sweetness to it too!  One sip and I was almost too overpowered with hops, though.. and believe me, I am a hop-addict, so that's saying quite a bit. The carbonation was about average. Although it's an IPA and relatively light body-wise, it's not a beer that you can drink like water (such as Sam Adams Summer Ale or Monsta IPA). Because of the initial hop-explosion in your mouth, it's much more small-sip friendly.  There is a noticeable bitterness after the initial hop'splosion, which is then followed up by a lingering malty aftertaste. I would say that it tastes ""drier"" than I would prefer, but full of flavor nonetheless.  It seems to pair very nicely with a big hershey's milk chocolate bar.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Melikeydahop,4.33,"A little sweeter (yet pleasantly so..not too swet), than most IPA's but still manages to master the dry and semi bitter finish. Smells of grassy and fruity hops yet still has an indescribable smell that is unique to Sierra Nevada. Great look for an IPA...a beautiful reddish/amber with a nice off white head. As it's predecessor before this, SNPA...another great beer to convert BMC drinkers into true beer enthusiasts as well as to satiate the much more experienced palate. And for the price point there are few better. A beer worth trying as well as seeking out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,rev3rb,4.5,"Bottom Line Up Front: This is a great american extra IPA with the floral and resin aromas and a good bitter taste.  Decanted a 12oz bottle in a clean pint glass.  Appearance: Nice dark copper color with good head pour and lacing around the glass when drinking.  Aroma: Great floral and resin hop aromas.  Taste: It is a full bodied extra IPA with medium to heavy bitterness expected in an extra IPA  Palate: It has a medium body with average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Overall: This beer is a house favorite IPA that goes great with spicy food whether chinese or indian. It also goes great with a good burger or pizza. If you like IPAs and haven’t tried this, then find yourself a six pack and enjoy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,danreitz,4,"My buddy bought me a sixer of Torpedo IPA as a thank-you gift. Drinking as I review. Poured from the bottle into a mason jar. Sits penny-copper with a pillowy head and a hoppy aroma. Intense hop taste with an immediate pine bitterness that stayed on my tongue long after each sip. Feels thick and swirly.  This is a great IPA, one which I look forward to finding on tap somewhere. Its flavor is bold but not menacing. If anything, I wish the aftertaste was a little mellower.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,silverking,4.32,"I poured it room tempurature into a snifter. The color is a beautiful amber, but it lacks that bottle conditioned murkiness that I have come to love from sierra nevada. It sports and off white head with decent lacing. The nose is dominated by pine, citrus, alcohol, and a hint of yeast if you look for it. It is moderately heavy on the palate, and it starts with pure grapefruit and then finishes bitter with a wonderful yeast/bread taste that lingers for quite a while. This is an exceptional beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,andrewjraab,3.92,"A - Copper burnt orange. Nice off white head with good retention and nice lacing.  S - Robust hop smell, fruity, lemon zest, floral.  T - Full bodied american IPA. Huge juicy hops up front balanced by a semi sweet, but bitter finish.  O - This did not disappoint after the highly acclaimed reviews. Full flavored, huge floral smell, nice hop profile. This brew gets it done - A must try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DrinkMoreBigBeers,4.23,"Not the freshest bottle and was brewed on the 258th day of this year = September 15th  A - Poured out a off white yellowish creamy 4 finger head with crystal clear golden bronze color. Lacing is really nice on this one.  S - On the nose you get a balanced nose of Hops and Malts. The hops have a pine, grass, skunk, dankness, followed by a nice caramel sweet bready malt back that really can push ahead of the hops hear.  T - This one is bitter with a nice hop bite up front of pine, light citrus, and some grassy earthyness, definitely can taste the bitterness more hear then on the nose with a caramel bready bitter finish that goes on and on. No alcohol detected.  M - This one drinks nice and smooth with a medium light mouth and a good amount of carbonation that takes over in the back and tickles the tongue. Goes down easy and is relatively dry and crisp.  O - This is a classic IPA by SN, that definitely lives up to a great brew. I could go to this as a regular not only for the price but the quality on this one. This one I will revisit on a regular basis. If you have not tried this one give it a go you will not be disappointed. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Maltmaiden,4.27,A: range with a little brown color. Tall thick head that leaves a strong film and decent lacing that lingers for the entirety. Tiny bit cloudy. Little bit of carbonation… could be more.  S: floral and citrus hops right away. Some grassiness/pine. Some caramel malt in the background. Grapefruit.  T: Bitter grapefruit hops right away with some caramel malt. Earthiness. Pine. Finishes with a bitter breadiness taste.  M: Smooth and tacky. Leaves the mouth dry and begging for water. Could stand for a little more carbonation. Medium to thick body.  O: I really enjoyed this Extra IPA though I’m not sure I’d like to have more than 2 in a session because of the intensity of the hops (not saying that that’s bad). Only qualm: more carbonation. I need water!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BigBarley,3.82,"A - Foamy, white head that recedes to about half a finger ring. Deep, amber orange color, that allows distorted light through. Looks strong!  S - Piney feel dominates. Like smelling a forest of hops and pine trees? Mild malty sweetness underneath, hints of floral hoppiness. Not extremely strong, but fairly pleasant  T - Lots of piney hops and bitter backing hit at the front. Very faint malt sweetness supporting. Aftertaste is a little unpleasant, as it tastes like a bad mesh of the pine and bitter notes. Still, very intense, hoppy flavor, with that signature sierra nevada pine presence. Very unique flavor, accenting a different combination of hop flavors than the standard imperial IPA. I prefer it after having a chance to warm, as it balances a little better and brings out more of the subtle citrus and floral notes that are hidden at first by the piney forest explosion. Interesting to say the least. I can see how some people could love this beer like a child. I personally don't prefer it over a few choice IPAs, but I do love how unique the flavor is, even if the aftertaste sort of cheapens the experience.  M - I will say, this beer feels amazng. Perfect balance between a thick ale and a refreshing hoppy beverage. Carbonation isn't extreme, but it does glaze enjoyable on the tongue without coming on flat. Feels good going in and drinks fairly smooth considering the volume of flavor.  O - I enjoy this beer to an extent. And I can easily see how someone with a slightly different taste could go nuts over this beer. The only detractors are the aftertaste (which is like mild bile, unfortunately) and the lack of a strong smell. The smell itself is wonderful, but if it only came through a little stronger I'd have given it an easy 5. I do, however, recommend this to any hophead looking for something a little different that still satisfies the thirst for bitter",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,beerzerker,4.17,"Surprising taste not overpowering. It does have a lingering after taste that hurts the beer however, this is def. top two IPAs i have tasted.

140,30420,ThePaleRider,4,"A - Almost the color of wildflower honey. Egg shell colored one finger head that lasts a while and leaves and pretty lacing. Crystal clear and shows plenty of light through the glass.  S - Lots of pine and malts. Piney hops backed up by toffee, a light coffee, and grains.  T - Super mellow (is that a real description?) hop bite. Way too smooth for the amount of pine I'm picking up. Very drinkable, which is what I would expect from Sierra Nevada. Very nice malts to balance out the mild hops. For the price you can't match the ABV and flavor.  M - Heavy IPA that has medium carbonation.  O - Great Extra IPA that delivers ease of drinking and a higher ABV.

140,30420,Grohnke,4.22,"Billowing cream colored head, forms and holds remarkably. Sticky lacing around the glass as it falls, presumably from the copious amounts of hops. Beautiful light copper, with the color orange coming in a variety of hues.  Sharp citrus hops, intense fresh pine. Soft sweetness. Medium Toasty/biscuity malt aroma. Hops are certainly the highlight, but the malty aspects come through wonderfully.  Bursting with hop, reminiscent of the aroma. Bright pine, herbal, and citrus assault. Firm toasty malt profile develops briefly, then is carried away by an onslaught of sticky dry hops resin on the swallow. Finishes dry, and long. Piney citrus hops linger with a soft biscuit/toasty malt in the background. Aftertaste remain hop forward.  Medium / medium, in good balance. Well crafted.  At this time in my life, I am tired of a style: IPAs. Whether they are double, black, Belgian, or petite, I'm just done with them (for the time being, im sure it will pass). However, whenever I am in a style funk, and regardless of degree, there will always be a beer that sets my short term, possibly unjust, disdain for its style aside.

Just a hint of pineapple. Nice, crisp, bitter hops. Just enough malt to balance the bitterness but not making it sickly sweet.  M: Medium body and medium carbonation. Crisp and refreshing. Good as a session beer.  O: This is an amazing beer for the price point. In my area, it is about $1 per 12 oz. bottle. The other competitors in that price range are Harpoon IPA and RedHook Longhammer IPA and this blows them out of the water.

T: Bold hop bitterness on the palate which lingers at times giving way to biscuity sweet maltiness. The hops are mostly citrus, herbal and piney with minimal tropical fruit notes. Strong hoppiness with some but overall minimal depth of flavor.  M: Smooth, full, with good linger. Moderate amount of carbonation.  O: Citra hops give this IPA some great citrus notes.

Orange hue to the amber body: on top an impressive show of white foaming bubbles, the body has a slight haze, the head as white as the driven snow.  Hop nose (surprise, surprise): struggled to find the citrus notes others have mentioned, even as the beer warmed in its chalice. Pine, nuts and floral hop esters for me with a semi-hint of pink grapefruit as it changed temp.  There is a malty undertone but the hops rule the roost here in all aspects, the taste is supposed to be 'Extra IPA' and that is what the brewery has provided. The after-taste is dry and fairly bitter, had a whole lot hoppier stuff when over in the US though.  My taste buds are subtle and European (OK English): so this is too heavy on the hop front for me. I knew what I was buying and I've enjoyed this brew. I couldn't however see me buying a case of this and passing it around my mates (if I had any).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,KKB,4.2,"A – Has a nice yellow/caramel look to it, off white head, a good amount of carbonation coming up, about a finger of head with really nice retention, and great lacing.  S – A nice hoppy aroma, not exactly blown away by the smell, but it has a bit of pine resin in it as well. Also definitely some very slight fruity aspects like orange/tangerine… as it warms up there is a little bit of a biscuity/malty scent to it as well that is entirely pleasant.  T – Quite nice, tons of hops right off the bat that are bitter on the palate. It is sweet also, and very refreshing with a slight stickiness and pine element that I like in my IPAs. This really is just a hop attack with an obvious diversity and blend of different hops. I actually really like that.  M – The mouthfeel is medium to full. And if I’m being honest it’s really just closer to medium. There is a great carbonation that lasts throughout that provides for a lighter feel than you would think even though this has a slight sticky quality to it. Great mouthfeel.  O – This is a really solid IPA, or rather, “Extra IPA.” It is unique and has a nice refreshing quality to it that I did not see coming. I don’t love this IPA but I do really like it. The taste is just more of a hop exploration than it is flavorful and delicious. But it’s still rather good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,PancakesbyMail,4.35,"Bottle, poured into glass. Bought at Henrietta Wegman's.  A: Nice golden-bronze color, translucent. Small amount of head that doesn't stick around, no real lacing on the sides.  S: Smells sweet and hoppy, with definite notes of citrus. A clean, clear smell that's almost as bright as the actual taste.  T: Exceptional. Lots of citrus, bold hop character but without any lingering bitterness. Up-front and with serious bite, it could be described as ""an experience."" This isn't one that you could knock back a few of to relax - this one demands attention. Bright, clear flavors that are downright exciting, even as someone who's not a real fan of IPAs. For something with over 7% ABV, it goes down very smooth in spite of the bold flavor.  M: Crisp and not syrupy. Excellent amount of carbonation. Full taste and body.  O: An incredible IPA and my new standard for the style.

My personal favorites are regular ales or dark porters so i just simply am not used to the strong flavor of IPAs. This beer has a very piney/citrus flavor and i think is comes from the hops used in this brew because i know most IPAs have extra hops or malts but i did try another IPA before and it simply did not compare the the flavor of Torpedo. This is just a flavorful beer and the mouth feel and taste lingers for a while but in a good way.

Smells a lot sweeter than it tastes.  T - wooh, very bitey. I like this beer because it's not a passive drinking experience. Every drink is very considered, and it's difficult to have more than one in a sitting because of the strength of the taste.  M - my only significant complaint is this.

After taking a whiff, I noticed lots of citrus and piney notes, but also some honey and vanilla from the malts. The taste was sweet and bitter...perhaps bittersweet? I really enjoyed the mellow sweetness that Torpedo brought to the table, but I wish the hops were more prevalent For a California, ""extra"" IPA, I was expecting a little more on that front, but the taste was overall quite enjoyable. As for the mouthfeel, the carbonation was nice and moderate and it left a slightly bitter aftertaste.  Definitely a solid IPA. I really enjoyed it, and I think it would be a great intro for someone who is looking to transition from Pale Ales into the hoppier IPAs. Looks great, smells great, and tastes great.

140,30420,OSUBeerStudent,4.18,"Good old Torpedo. So glad this is in cans now as it makes for a perfect camp/pool beer. Poured into a glass for the review.  A - pretty glorious actually. Nice copper color but fairly opaque. Fairly large off-white head that sticks around ok with excellent lacing.  S - a nice citrus and pine nose. Fairly sweet citrus (hi there citra) and resin gives it a pretty sweet nose but the pine balances it nicely.  T - balanced. Plenty of the sweet citrus here again but that leads into a grassiness that's not so present in the aroma. The grassiness heads off and is followed by piney, resinous bitterness. A little bit of backing malt but this is a hop show. The bitterness is fairly resilient. Tasty.  M - on the slightly thicker side. Carbonation is nice enough to give it a slightly creamy mouthfeel. It's a bit juicy but not in the extreme. Quality.  O - a good, solid IPA. I'm a big piney/grassy IPA fan, so this is right up my alley, and the citra gives it some nice fruitiness to balance that out. More malt backing than some of the typical ""west coast"" IPAs. This is pretty unique. For the crazy low price, convenience of cans, and basically nationwide year-round availability, it's hard to do better than this for a quality IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,RollTide05,4.85,"I love how this beer is so readily available in the states. I must say that this is right up there with all of the best IPA's I've ever had. The hops are very complex and loaded with citrus and pine flavors. I think that torpedo hop thingy that they use to infuse the hops makes a big difference. You can really taste ALL of the hops. The malt and hops are absolutely perfectly balanced as well.  I absolutely cannot fathom why anyone would buy a six pack of Coors, Bud, or Miller for $6.99-$7.99 when you can buy a six pack of the Torpedo IPA for $8.99-$9.99. One of the best beers I've ever had...seriously.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Fusion_Pirate,4.68,"A: Poured vigorously from a cold 16oz can into a weizen glass, Torpedo Extra IPA yielded a massive 2 and 1/2 fingers of rich, cream-colored head which died very gradually, leaving extensive, elaborate lacing on the glass with almost glue-like retention. The color is a dark, opaque almost rusty burnt orange. One of the best-looking beers I've ever seen!  S: A fruity, robust magnum hop scent hits your olfactories immediately, along with notes of pine needles and a faint caramel malt back end. What a righteous smell...  T: A true marriage of bitter, citrus hops and caramel-candy maltiness with a vaguely boozy finish. Balance is the theme of the day here...carbonation is extremely mild, barely tickling the tongue as a functional vehicle for the hop/malt dynamic duo to do their thang. Poetry in motion!  M: Although mild in carbonation and very balanced in flavor, that tiny bit of lingering booziness tends to cause of a bit of 'tongue jumping' that accumulates gradually as you drink the beer. Hell, I don't even know if it's a good or bad thing...it just 'is'.  O: Torpedo Extra IPA blew my sensory doors off...while it's not quite the smorgasbord of perfection that their 'Hoptimum' Imperial IPA is (not a fair comparison, after all), it's probably in my ""Top Five"" when it comes to medium gravity, moderate microbrewed IPAs.  A little over halfway through this beer and my weekend has improved immeasurably because of it. Thank You, Sierra Nevada!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Maybe a little malt sweetness.  Taste is outstanding. A nice hoppy blast that lingers. A little malt sweetness in the middle and lingering hoppiness. This is what an American ipa should taste like. Really good balance.  Mouthfeel is nearly perfect. Just the right amount of carbonation and really smooth. Nice.  Overall a great American ipa. A hophead delight. If you like the hops - a must try and for me, a go to ipa.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,SerialTicker,4.2,"Appearance: Pours with a nice head, and some sticky lacing. The color of the beer itself is a deep amber color.  Smell: A lot of spiciness with the hops... really doesn't taste all too much like it smells.  Taste: Floral, spicy, grapefruity. That's the best way I can describe it. The slight bitterness at the end is really great. The malt also comes through on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Perfect. Right middle-of-the-road, and it makes this an easy and pleasurable drinking IPA.  The more I drank it, the more I enjoyed it. I got this in a mix-a-six, but I'd not hesitate to buy some more of this stuff. The hype is well-founded ... this is one of the most popular IPAs in America, and for good reason. It's tasty, it's affordable, and you can find it just about anywhere. A quality beer.

Can be described as astringent, but extra IPAs are hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Hornet2003,3.7,"Appearance: Standard IPA, pale orange/copper. Nice fluffy head-retains decently.  Smell: Not quite the kick in the face I was expecting, but definitely strong hop aromas. Mostly pine needles and lemon zest. It's definitely nice, but not as strong as I was expecting.  Taste: Torpedo has a strong West Coast hop presence and is definitely living up to the West Coast stereotype. The malt gives a little bit of sweetness but the bitterness is definitely winning the battle here. There is a touch of alcohol too. Actual flavours: Pine, orange, grapefruit, lemon.  Mouthfeel: Softer than I expected. It's got low-moderate carbonation, which is actually ok with this ridiculously bitter beer. Any more carbonation and it would be a bit of a mess. Malty sweetness is there to maintain some balance in the mouth.  Overall: Good! Not great, but a definite winner as a daily drinker IPA. The alc/vol (why the frig don't we rate drinkability any more?!?) is kind of high even for an IPA, but I could see this being a great Sunday afternoon beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: Spicy orange and pine with a bready backbone. Hop profile is pungent and zesty.  T: Taste follows the nose with sweet orange and pungent pine needles, grapefruit pith...a bit herbal with some resinous and oily hop characters.  Small amounts of malt presence shine through, cutting the bitterness a bit and lending to the overall body of the beer.  MF: Bitter and creamy medium body, moderate carbonation, a bit oily.

140,30420,mlazzaro,3.51,"4 pack of 16 oz cans labeled 03/08/12.  Smells of fruits like pineapple and grapefruit. Some pininess going on. Nice smell but honestly quite mild for an IPA. Being 5 months old, I hope this isn't due to age. These can were just released here in Mass.  Appearance is a clear amber color. Pillowee off-white head that has decent retention.  Taste is bitter dominant. Flavor hops are mild by comparison. Hop flavor comes off as more of a piney resinous flavor. Body is thin. Sweetness in minimal, and kicks in right at the end of the sip with a little caramel. Bitterness lingers afterwards.  I think the ""extra"" of the extra IPA is found in the bitterness. Magnum is an intense hop, even though it is of Nobil decent. It could be my palate, but this beer is just not balanced. And I typically love bitter beers. Its all about how the bitterness communicates with the rest of the flavor profile.  NOTED- It's really interesting they can condition with sugar and yeast. I confirmed this as the second pour was significantly cloudier.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Sum1tohate,3.93,"A fine beer that I have had before and enjoyed. I decided to pick up a six pack while grocery shopping to see how much I really liked it. Noting the look, it is filtered to a translucent amber color and a frothy creamy head, very nice. The smell is a subtle bitter scent, not too remarkable. The taste carries a bold hops flavor yet balances well with the malt. It hits the back of the tongue with it's bitter, spicy and moderately effervescent goodness. Smooth finish. Overall a very good beer for the price and, where I am, its fairly common in stores that normally carry less than quality beers.

Some rich malt at first. Hot and spicy. An overabundance of hops, but that's why you bought this stuff. I don't taste much else, but it is a sophisticated and mellow flavor in a world of over-excitable hop bombs.  Well made as with all of the Sierra Nevada products. It fills the niche for extra-hoppy in their beer range. Actually more drinkable than I remember from previous attempts. Bitter aftertaste mellows out eventually, but it is quite hot tasting.

Pleasant malt as tge beer warms. Almost perfect.  M: Medium. Bright. A good bit of carbonation here too.  O: Absolutely top notch IPA here. Classic. Refreshing.

But I wrecked a car I bought a couple weeks ago today and this is one of my favorite quality beer that you can find quite easily.  A- After the pour the beer ignites an explosive beige head; very rich and creamy looking. Love at first sight. The color reminds me of SueBee Brand orange honey, (which happens to be the honey used in Arizona Green Tea.) You cannot see through to the other side of the glass. Almost as foggy as a wheat beer.  S- the scent is much like christmas. pine and snow. (some of you may be thinking why it is i know the smell of snow) but trust that this beer has that smell. For an IPA the smell is faint but still has intrigue.  T- Superb flavors of aggressive hops and definetly pine. Smells like Christmas, taste like Christmas. SOOOO prefectly balanced; no one note over the other.  M- Very medium bodied for an IPA... almost light. And almost too easy to drink. A 6-pack will run you about $10. Think of getting rid of $10 within 1 hr 15 mins all buy yourself in your oun kitchen. Too good to be true.  O- someone on the westcoast loves this beer with all their heart.

140,30420,hoody711,4.21,"Well, I suck, because after sucking back tons of SNPA before I really got into craft, I dismissed this brewery as sellout, macro-style, garbage. Idiot, idiot, idiot. Hoptimum? Holy shit. SNPA - still the standby at any bar. And here we find Torpedo, the only beer I could find worth buying while picking up some odds and ends at Walmart. A lot of people buy beer at Walmart. Don't worry about it. Here we go.  A - poured from a bottle rather vigorously into my new Founders tulip. Yeah, I'm fancy now. Beautiful, deep, golden orange. Large and fluffy off-white head that settles to 1 finger size and leaves great lace. A beautiful beer.  S - not sure what's going on here, I'm not getting much hops. I know I've smelt more from a previous Torpedo. Don't see a date on the bottle. Hmm. What I do smell is sweet and malty. I was really expecting more pine, but I'm just not getting it. Strange.  T - following suit at first, then the nice bitter burn of hops comes in. The start is a nice, full, chewy, malty sweetness, with a tinge of tropical fruit, followed by a fresh hop ""pow!"" Lowercase because it doesn't knock you on your ass or make you hate your mouth, like, say, Devil Dancer. This is much more subtle and complex. Almost no alcohol on the way down.  M - medium-to-heavy at first, but a solid medium after all is said and done. The carbonation is good. Quite easy to drink, which makes it dangerous.  O - even though the smell of this particular bottle underwhelmed me, Sierra Nevada proves that it is nationwide for a reason. They have made a ridiculously good IPA and put it on the shelves for a little more than half the competition.

140,30420,TheDudeAbidesMan,3.83,For National Ipa Day I grabbed a six pack of Mostly Imperials or double Ipas as some would call them. So of course I grabbed the always reliable torpedo. The hop to malt ratio blends together perfectly the moment it hits the back of your mouth the hops scream out and you cant bare but take another swig. All in all I have had better but for the price and taste this one is balanced and always worth picking up a sixer. Strong pine/resin after taste with perfect carbonation.

140,30420,rickyleepotts,2.86,"Today is national IPA day! Good thing… because I love a good IPA. We only had one in the fridge and it was the Extra IPA from Sierra Nevada. I have had this before, and what I remember is the big calorie count. I can’t recall the hops or the bitterness… but from what I am reading, it is loaded with both. I mean, the “extra” came from somewhere. Let’s celebrate national IPA day with… an IPA!  In the Glass: It looks like an IPA in the glass. It might even be darker than I expected, but still has that golden appeal that a nice IPA brings. It has a decent lace, too and produces a thick, white head.  Nose: Holy hops does that smell good. This beer is just loaded with hops. The tasting notes talked about a lemony overtone… and I am not getting that. The Citra hops is what would produce that, but all I am smelling right now is hops, hops, and more hops! Also, isn’t it cool that there is an IPA day? This beer is being served ice cold, and I can imagine that would help it create a more crisp, bitter flavor.  Flavor: The flavor is boring at first, and then the hops kick in. But they don’t really do much. They don’t kick in the way I expect them to. For this to be an “extra” IPA I was expecting a lot more. Sure, there are hops and there is some subtle bitterness, but man… what a let down. I expected more from such a good brewery. Maybe that’s why it’s so cheap.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is malty at first (boring, really) and then the hops kick in and almost numb the tongue as you swallow. The best part about this beer is the aftertaste. But we will get to that. The burp is nice, though.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste is dry, and provides the most bitterness that you experience along the way. When a beer is an “extra” IPA, I immediately think double IPA or imperial IPA. Man, what a let down. Oh, speaking of IPAs… my buddy Mike Bravo ordered one of those last week. The server told him it was an Indiana Pale Ale. Yeah. Servers should know better. I hope he loses his job! Not Bravo, the server!  Well Sierra Nevada, I am upset with this one. You could have and should have done SO much more. I have had basic IPAs that have more hops and more bitterness than this. Try again!!!

140,30420,JamesMN,4.25,"Appearance: Copper and almost completely translucent. Off-white head, leaving great lacing.  Aroma: The hop sweetness of tropical fruit. A little pine underneath all that.  Taste: Real nice flavorful bitterness throughout. Just a tiny hint of heat from the alcohol. Pine in there as well. A little pale malt in the background to balance it all out.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated. Smooth meets bitter. Not a thin beer by any means but also not too full bodied, which makes it very drinkable especially considering the style.  Final Thoughts: Yet another diamond in the rough. IPA's can be a gamble sometimes considering all the different styles (English, East Coast, West Coast, and everything in between) when they aren't specifically labeled. This American IPA will really hit the spot for any hop-head. It is a must-have for any beer enthusiast.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The taste follows the nose but is much more heavy on the pine. Still getting some grapefruit but a very clean tasting pine hoppiness steals the show. Caramel malt adds a touch of balance but this is reppin the west coast pretty well.  Full to medium in body as far as IPA's go. The carbonation is a little on the high side but it is still in the appropriate range. It makes me feel like the hops are stabbing my tongue with each sip so I'm definitely not complaining. Drying hop finish. Very nice!  This is the epitome of the beer that is always on the shelf but I always pass it by. Definitely going to have to start picking up a sixer of this on the reg.

From the bottle: ""Sierra Nevada Torpedo Ale is a big American IPA, perfectly balanced yet full of flavor and aroma highlighting the complex citrus pine and herbal character of whole cone American hops.""  The humidity of the day is really playing hob with my initial pour! Once more, I began to see a massive head building and had to back off. I finally ended up with just over a finger of dense, tawny head with great retention. Color was a coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was minty, like an evergreen forest in the dead of winter. Man, if that doesn't set your mouth to watering, turn in your hophead status soonest! Mouthfeel was medium and the mintiness of the hops was counterbalanced beautifully by the caramel of the malt. I have heard of hops candy, although I have yet to try some, but this is what I imagine it would taste like! The dense stcky lacing that began to appear was riotous.

Earthy and piny hops noticeable with some light grapefruit and citrus there too. Not much for malt except some faint toastiness.  Taste is an improvement. Piny/resiny and grapefruit hops are most prevalent with some earthiness and citrus there too. Decent amount of caramel and bready malts back it up. Pretty classic IPA taste that's very well done.

After taste is of hops and a hint of the alcohol content.  Mouthful tends to a light heavy. Very pleasing but with a hint of ""warning"".  Overall this one has ample availability and priced right.

As with the aroma, the pineyness of the hops is more immediate, with the citrus coming into play in the finish. Good mouthfeel. Not too heavy, but you know you're drinking a real beer, not beer-flavored water. Very nice buzz, but the alcohol is well hidden by this beer's amazing flavor.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,healeyg,4.25,"Really nice IPA. Full of flavor. Citrus. Definitely strongly hoppy, have to be in mood to be satisfied with it. Way stronger hops than the Pale Ale. Not as much as the hoptimum. Not a session beer as it is too sharp. But wonderful when having 1, 2 or 3.  Likes to be opened up to the air.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,SouljaSaia17,4.13,"Picked up a Pint of this beer for only $2.50, so not a bad deal for this quality of beer.  A: The appearance is a pretty golden amber color with a 1-finger, soapy white head that slowly dissipates.  S: The smell gives off a faint, sweet citrus and a bit of honey and what seems like a hint of lemon as well. Surprisingly, not a lot of pine aroma here.  T: Starts out with some hop bitterness and is followed by pine and grapefruit. Has some honey and spice on the back end. Not too strong or bitter.  M: Minimal carbonation, mouth feel is sweet and satisfying. Very drinkable  O: Overall this beer is a great buy. A nice quality IPA for not a lot of money and is good go to after a hard days work or for just hanging out in the backyard!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,leaddog,4.33,"Bottle purchased from ABC store in Honolulu.  Appearance- Pours a dark amber with a finger width of foamy bubbly head.  Smell- Piney hops, citrus, breadiness, and caramel.  Taste- Piney earthy hops, citrus, and caramel. This brew is balanced nicely between hops and malts. Leaves a pleasant lingering bitterness.  Mouthfeel- Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A tad sticky.  Overall- An enjoyable American IPA by Sierra Nevada. A definite go for those hop-heads out there.

140,30420,EnjoyTheFlavor,3.36,This is my go to. With the reasonable price good taste and ok abv this is a beer i can relax with. The flavor is smooth with a little bit of a bite at the end. Alot of the other beers i have had in the same price range are much more bitter and malty than this beer is. I much rather prefer other IPAs but as i said for the price per a 6 pack its hard to complain.  This beer is considered a high gravity beer. That meaning it has a bit of a a maltier taste due to its brewing process and a higher abv than most putting it at a 7.2 which is right in the middle of high gravity ipas.  This is a beer that goes great on a warm summer night. It has a nice citrus hint to it making you feel all warm inside. It goes nicely with bbq food. I would say give it a try.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Herbs and citrus up front, dry hops all the way through and a strong malt backbone. Great hops and malt balance that lingers on the tongue. Taste of resiny pine is apparent. I'm not gonna dissect the herbs... c'mon now.  M: No complaints, It's da bomb - get it? Anyway...  O: Elite? Debatable. Great IIPA, will enjoy many more. My favorite Sierra Nevada release.

140,30420,viverlee,4.44,"Now this is how you make a beer. No honey added, no orange twist, no shandy of lemonade. It would make an ideal complement to wedge fries and curry sauce.  STYLE: American IPA  ABV: 7.2%  LOOK: Let’s start with the head. Fluffy isn’t the right word. It’s more like one of those moon rocks with holes throughout. The volume is there facially, punctured though it is. The color — a creamy, mellow amber.  NOSE: Sunflower seeds, pistachios, sweet pine needles, black licorice, fresh mint. Unfathomably complex.  MOUTH: Predominantly lemon, fresh, black cardamom, buttered nuts. Strong malty backbone, pizza crust and English muffins. Maybe a tad astringent with the finish, my only real complaint, if you can call it that, is that I wish more of the nose came through in the mouth.

140,30420,rdilauro,4.35,"Pours a dark golden amber with a nice off white creamy head. Once I put my nose into the glass, all I could detect was Hops and Grapefruit. In fact, the amount of hoppiness I got from the aroma, made me think that this was going to be one of those high IBU bitter but great beers. I need to contrast this with their Pale Ale. This is darker with more of a hoppy aroma. Taste wise, they are similar... But this one definitely has more hops and more citrus going on.  The mouthful was very big and very soft, then some of the hops came through with just the right amount of bitterness. The finish was perhaps a little short.  Still, this just make like Sierra Nevada beers more and more",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Jesse13713,4.65,"16 oz can poured into a Hoppin' Frog snifter glass.  Appearance - A delightfully springy and lively pour. A porous head that appears whipped at the surface. Huge ducts of carbonation. An amazing pale amber that is reminiscent of a fresh blood orange. Thick lacing. The carbonation allows a constant vortex of bubbles to twirl in the center of the glass.  Smell - The carbonation gives the aroma a huge lift. A throbbing forest of various pine notes. Excellent citrus qualities with a bit of lemon/lime behind the curtains. Fresh sage with a light sprig of mint added. This is one of the freshest beers I've smelled to date.  Taste - A beautiful marriage of strong hops and caramelly malts. The malt backing is sweet and very toffee-esque. Assertive hop bitterness accompanies tastes of pine, tangerine, lemon/lime, fresh mint, and pink grapefruit. A very well-balanced extra IPA that quenches the thirst. I am truly torn between giving this a 4.5 and a 5 in taste. While I have had Torpedo before, this is my first time reviewing the beer. I may upgrade to a 5 after drinking my 4th can.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability - This beer prides itself in presenting itself as a whole product. The whole-cone hops embrace the sweet, ambery malt perfectly. Medium bodied and a very consistent tasting beer no matter the temperature. Bitters are strong, but not in any way overwhelming. Everything is balanced to perfection; perfectly brewed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,srv33,4,"Dark yellow pour, fine two inch head, medium bubbles. Very hop-heavy scent plus a bit of pine and sweet maltiness.

140,30420,ChiPool,4,"Poured can into imperial pint glass.  Everything about this says ""very good AIPA"" to me. Can't say it has crazy aromatics, but you get some spicy hop notes on the nose. Taste offers such a great balance: complex hop profile with piney/bittering, and a respectable malt backbone. Just the right amount of lingering bitterness.  When one is just looking for a no-nonsense, predictably solid IPA, look no further than Torpedo. Great value as well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Danny1217,4.15,"Pours a somewhat see-through orange-ish color. A big white head with excellent retention. Smells of hops, citrus, and all that stuff. Also has a bit of a malty caramel smell. The taste somewhat follows. A good IPA, with a bit of a malty balance to it. Sort of an IPA that will go down well for people who aren't accustomed to them yet. I don't care if it isn't the boldest tasting IPA, it still tastes damn good.

S - Hops mixed with sweet caramel and malty biscuits.  T - Strong hop presence, with minimal ABV presence. Smooth due to the caramel and warm malts. Simply fantastic balance.  M - Lots of hops with the carbonation up front. Followed by sweet warm malts, medium bodied. Concludes crisp. Salute.  O - Great drinkability, sophisticated hop profile; a winner.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,turnerk3,4.88,"A: Pours a gorgeous dark golden color with an exquisite, half-inch head that admirably embraces the glass. Truly an impeccable first impression.  S: An paramount hop essence floods the nose well before the first sip. Upon a more in-depth observation reveals an underlying malt sweetness. However, the extensive citrusy odor from the hops is still a little overwhelming.  T: Almost identical to the smell, but this is where the malt sweetness combines perfectly with the hoppy bitterness. Perfectly balanced and undeniably delicious.  M: The malt sweetness makes it appear to be quite smooth initially, but this is quickly removed by the sticky, bitterness of the hops.  O: When I think ""IPA,"" I think Sierra Nevada Torpedo. This brew perfectly defines American IPAs, and the gratification of knowing it is readily available at an impeccable price makes it the perfect choice. Definitely worthy of a try!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,looktowindward,3.3,"Poured into a De Ranke tulip glass, clear bronze appearance, small fingers worth of cream head.  Aroma of caramel and biscuit malt, citrus - grapefruit and orange. Floral hints and minty herbs.  Grapefruit and lemon zest, supported by a strong backbone of sticky toffee sweet malt, a fair touch of alcohol licks the back of the throat. Herb, pine and tropical overtones but these are negligible compared to the malt.  Feel is is medium/heavy, sticky in the mouth, with gentle carbonation.  I was expecting a hop masterclass, but left a little flat. Lacks the assertiveness I would expect and the malts are more prominant than I would have expected. Perhaps the trip over to the UK has sullied the flavour and complexity.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,dbrauneis,4.13,"A: Pours a very lightly hazy golden orange in color with some light visible carbonation along the sides of the glass. The beer has a two finger tall foamy beige head that reduces to a thick film covering the entire surface of the beer and a very thick ring at the edges of the glass. There is very significant lacing observed.  S: I detect notes of citrus, pine, and herbal notes from the hops which pretty much dominate the aroma of the beer. Very little malt presence but very inviting.  T: There is a bit of bready malts upfront in the taste but then the hop characteristics really take over. The primary flavors from the hops are pine and citrus though there are some herbal notes present as well. There is a very pleasant (not harsh) light lingering bitterness in the finish.  M: On the lighter side of medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly thin for the style and slightly sticky.  O: This is a very good beer and certainly one that is easy to drink. I could easily see this as a session beer and a really good one at that. Not overly bitter though there is a great hop presence. Nice combination of flavors and aromas from the different hops used. I would get this one again - I think I prefer this in the can to the bottle but just slightly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The smell is of grapefruit, a little orange, pine and and mint. Also a little spicy.  The taste is grapefruit followed by pine, a touch of mint and a touch of pepper and carmel. There is a strong hop taste with a roasted malt backbone followed by piney hops and hop resin which lingers on the tounge after swallowing. The finish is dry.  The mouthfeel is filling and bready. Crisp and oily with pine oils lingering on the tongue.  This is an edited reveiw; I think I got a bad batch the last time around because the beer I just had was simply incredible.

T-Floral notes,bready,grapefruit, very high hops, pine, and grains. Hints of sweet malt. Complex flavor and a very balanced taste. The aftertaste was dry, bitter, and black peppery. Nice warming effects from the 7.2% ABV. Quite refreshing for a high alcohol IPA brew.  M-Balanced and medium-bodied. Too complex to really distinguish everything about this. It was just smooth going down.  Overall, this is one of the best IPA's I have had. Nicely balanced flavor and aromas. This is a must have if you like IPA's. You will not be disappointed.

140,30420,FightingEntropy,4.5,"The awesome dry hopping technique used to create this IPA is from Sierra Nevada's hop torpedo. The hop torpedo is a cylindrical device that controls the hop contact. Normal dry hopping is inefficient because placing hops in a bag hides much of the hoppy goodness it the center away from direct contact from the beer. A quick search yielded this pic of the hop torpedo. More hop, less cost: everyone is hop happy.  Thick creamy off white head that continues to grow from the strong effervescent bubbles flowing up in the afternoon sun. Overflowing with grapefruit, citrus, a bit of lemon and clean, assertive spice in the nose. Sweet biscuit caramel notes support the Magnumb, Crystal and Citra hop combination. The promise of hops in the nose is fulfilled with a strong bite that spreads along the tongue. 7.2% alcohol points to a fairly large malt bill and it shows in the mouthfeel. Alcohol hotness is slightly apparent. Excellent IPA and it's a bit over the top for the style--which is perfect for me.  If you have any inclination to savor hops, try this beer. I love the 16 oz tallboy bans, but the packaging was terribly inconvenient. Hard to carry and no obvious way to hold on to it. A minor issue but not great marketing. Take home the awkward four pack and enjoy.

It's cool because you can tell it's probably exactly the same, but everything works better from the can. On top of that, you get a huge can of a good, piney, citrusy AIPA.

A very nice ipa which covers it's high abv very well. Also comes at a very good price $3.50 for a 24oz bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,HarrySTruman,4.43,"Dark copper. 1 and half finger head. Head retention is high. Lots of lacing.  Smells of resin and pine, coupled with strong citrus and floral scents.  The taste is more of a cornucopia than the smell. Many different flavors, malt, pine, resin, citrus. Very bold and well balanced flavor. Not quite the over the top experience of some AIPA's, but certainly well balanced. Strong drinkability.  Mouth feel is smooth and not too carbonated. Easy to drink, strong finish.  For the price, this IPA can't be beat. Although the nose and the flavors aren't as bold as some of it's competitors, the price point is perfect and it is very refreshing. Good beers should taste good, smell good, and look good, this beer does all of that for less than many other beers. Great choice for a year round beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BlackBelt5112203,4.46,"24 oz bottle poured into a tulip at cellar temperature.  L - Medium amber color with a towering 4-finger bubbly and sticky cream-colored head. Really good retention and amazing lacing. Crystal clear with a good amount of carbonation bubbles. Sierra Nevada always seems to get the look down perfectly.  S - Very interesting aroma. There’s a solid bread-like and caramel malt presence along with a broad hop bouquet with grapefruit, orange, pepper, grass, pine, floral, and marijuana notes. I’ve heard that Humulus and Cannabis are related and I’ve always heard people talk about marijuana hop aromas, but this is the first time I’ve experienced it. Even with this diverse bouquet, I’d like to see the hops more involved here. The sweet malt presence is a little too much.  T - Starts off sweet with caramel, orange, and pine flavors and builds to a very pleasant bitter finish with spicy floral and grass notes. Not as bitter as I expected this to be, and as much as I love bitter beers, this turns out to not be a bad thing at all (see Overall).  F - Light-to-medium-bodied with good carbonation, a sticky, chewy, and creamy mouthfeel, and a pleasantly bitter and dry finish. Spicy and floral hop bitterness lingers for a nice amount of time. This spiciness blends nicely with the smooth throat-warming sensation from the alcohol.  O - Due to the smooth bitterness (as opposed to daring, palate-wrecking bitterness that a lot of DIPAs have these days), this is probably the most drinkable DIPA I’ve ever had. With the lack of strong bitterness, one would expect the hop aromas and flavors to be subdued. That is not true at all. All of the hoppy goodness is still there and is really more enjoyable due to the pleasant bitterness as opposed to in-your-face bitterness. Great DIPA. I can see why everyone loves this so much. The fact that it’s not only delicious and drinkable but also widely available, cheap, and available in cans makes this a 5 overall.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Skywave,4.1,"Pours to a thick white head and laces all the way down. Orange and hazy, very typical. Aroma presents a nice blend of spicy, minty and citrusy hops and sweet pale malt. Flavor is light and pleasant--there is nothing ""extra"" about it really. Good balance of citrusy and earthy hops with a sturdy malt backbone with a lot of sugary goodness. You can tell there's a ton of hops in there by the flavor, but the malt sweetness really obscures the bitterness. Feels light in the mouth and easy to quaff. This is a good IPA and worthy of having again. Just don't confuse it with extra or double anything. That's just marketing hype.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Some hits of pine and grapefruit. Malts are bready with a touch of caramel sweetness. A little earthy and herbal, as I've come to expect from Sierra Nevada. Mild floral underpinning. Some gritty, crusty malts. Roasted malts are mellow. Slightly toasted.  Taste: Pith. Orange marmalade. Touches of mint. Lots more going on than the nose would indicate. Earthy/herbal hop note pulls over the pith. Citrus in good measure, but it's more fruity. Touch floral. Malts are sweet, but not overly so. Some hints of bread crust and caramel sweetness. Some dry, mealy fruit as well...something like a pear. Mild toasted character.  Mouthfeel: Moderate body. Creamy and smooth. Carbonation is moderate to light and really helps carry the body of the beer. Some dryness on the swallow.  Overall: This is another one of those paragons of style.

140,30420,Rantingfury,4.5,"I poured from a bottle and was greeted with a three finger tan-colored head of foam. This faded to some lacing. The color was a clear sweet tea amber color. The nose is interesting as I get a sweet character as much as I do the pine, orange, and ginger notes from the hops. It's a nice hoppy aroma with a sweet malt finish... A combined arms blitzkrieg on the nose. The flavor was of the citrus hops first, fading to the pine and ginger note in the aroma... The sweet malt makes a short closing appearance. The mouth feel was tingly from the carbonation and stays on the palate awhile after the last gulp of beer. Overall this isn't the super bitter hoppy ipa's I usually like, but this is a dang fine drinkable one.

Taste is hop-sweet initially, with notable malt notes taking away the hop edge. Hop bitterness emerges after the sweetish notes, grow and then fades with nice sustain of hops minutes afterward, although bitterness is one-dimensional.

Citrus, spicy and herbal hops on the nose, dry grains in the background.  The flavour is a straight-forward hop bomb with several layers of hops. Herbal hops up front, which become floral and then spicy in the middle, gaining some grapefruit pith towards the finish, and some astringent dandelion greens in the aftertaste. As it warms some clean grainy malt can be discerned up front in the flavour behind the citrus hops.  Medium-bodied mouthfeel, silky smooth texture, with medium carbonation.  An enjoyable and well-executed showcase of what American hops are capable of in unison.

140,30420,mtlasley,3.65,"Won't be able to hit the bottle shop til tomorrow and I didn't want to break into the cellar so I picked up a six pack close to home.  Appearance: Torpedo hits the glass and produced a strong, brownish red amber color. A gorgeous white, two-finger head stood tall and sudsy. Quite the eye appeal.  Smell: Hops are of course the strongest scent. Slightly lime like with a hint of grapefruit. The malt backbone is there and has a great sweetness that balances everything out.  Taste: Although the malt stands tall in the scent, it lets the hops do the work on the tongue. Powerful bittering that can only be described as ""hoppy"". The flavor never strays into too aromatic or too bitter and it constantly invites another taste.  Mouthfeel: Torpedo doesn't exactly live up to it's name in the mouthfeel department. It's slightly sticky but the carbonation carries it well and it goes down quite refreshingly.  Overall: Another hit from the boys in Chico. As a hop fan, it's a great session. And at 7% I don't feel as guilty drinking 4 of them as I do when I'm putting Hoptimums down. A tasty everyday drinking brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,AlCaponeJunior,3.83,"Poured a nice looking amberish tan color, clear, small rising bubbles, decent head and nice lacing.  Smells typically IPAish, piney, hoppy, noticeable sweetness not typical of an IPA, perhaps some faint caramel malts.  Tastes piney and hoppy. Sweetness comes thru in the taste but not too much, adds a nice touch. Fairly bitter. Malty character provides good balance. A little bit of resinous oiliness from the hops.  Pretty nice mouthfeel, fairly thick and rich, pretty good feel but the bitterness lingers a bit long.  Drinks pretty well. Definitely a fine IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,shigg85,4.25,"Bought a pint-sized bottle of this from Bevmo in Ontario, California. Poured into a Baird pint glass. Lovely thick white head on this grassy brew that turned from cloudy to clear as the carbonation settled. Wonderful hop aroma coming off it with notes of pine and citrusy grapefruit. I enjoyed this beer a lot, but I am not a big grapefruit/sour citrus fan, and this was a bit too sour/acrid for me. I love Sierra Nevada, and I was happy to try this. I suggest you do too.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,spunionring,4.27,"Appearance is a thick amber with a slight cloudiness. Only a bit of head that settles into a light fizz.  The smell is nice and hoppy as it should be, but not particularly strong.  Now this is the hoppiness you are looking for from an extra IPA! Manages to stay in competition with the fanciest craft beers out there. The malts are mild in comparison to the hops, which I find to be well balanced. There is also a very nice fumatic bouquet that expands in your mouth on the back sip.  Torpedo is a solid extra ipa that I always enjoy. Better than most new-brew craft ipa's, and its merely a premium 6pack pricing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TSJ4000,3.56,"Ok, the appearance had a nice fluffy head and some schticky lacing. I got a good wiff of this beer and I wasn't sure I was in the right place. I was expecting a hop explosion on the nose but didn't get one. Torpedo is a solid English-style IPA in my book. The hop finish this beer left me with was the taste and smell I wanted but I only got a hint of it on the finish.

Now that is what an Extra IPA should smell like. Lots of hops... Citrus Zest.. Pine.  T - Hits hard with the hops. Bitter, even at the tip of the tongue.  M - Excellent. Very full. Sticky and chewy the longer it is swirled in the mouth.  O - Somewhat surprisingly, a very excellent Extra IPA from a large craft brewer.

140,30420,ThomasMetal75,3.37,"*I bought this (from the shelf) as part of my Mix-A-Six for $1.89 in a 16oz can. When I got it home, it was in the fridge for maybe 2 hours and in the freezer for about 15 minutes. It was probably close to around 50-55 deg F. My review may be off since the beer was not real cold.*  A- Cooper with an extremely soapy head. Very effervescent, with bubbles racing to the top of the class.  S- Floral and citrus hops. A good deal of caramel-type malt in the nose as well. A nice balance between hops and malts!  T- Sharply bitter! The thing that is detected right away is the citrus/grapefruit notes. The initial sip is very pungent on the palate! The finish is of floral type hops. What bothers me (and I like IPAs) is the finish is just so bitter and lingers in your mouth. There is a really awesome caramel maltiness that comes out, but it doesn't balance much of the bitterness from the hops. The beer has tons of flavor, but nothing that wows me.  M- Medium. I didn't think that this beer sat too heavy or was in any way watery. Easy enough to drink  *This beer is slightly above average to me overall, even for an IPA. I just think the bitterness is too one dimensional and not well rounded enough for any other flavors to be detected. I say this is a slightly above average beer because as the Torpedo Extra IPA has an immense amount of flavor, it's very lopsided to me in terms of it's flavor profile. I would try this again only if it were ice-cold.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,crob3888,4.5,"Pours a golden yellow with a very lace-heavy head. Smell and taste are first of citrus rind (grapefruit and a hint of lemon oil) and then the bone-dry bitter hops hit you with pine and resin, with a leafy and oily finish. Some biscuit malt and spicy hop as well. Basically one of the best year-round and easily accessible IPAs out there.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Damian,2.89,"Drank from a 12 fl oz bottle purchased at Julio's Liquors, Westboro, MA Served in a pint glass  Slightly hazy and medium amber in appearance. The liquid was topped by a dense, frothy, two-finger crop of sticky, off-white foam. Patchy blocks of lacing clung to the sides of the glass.  The nose was much more tame than anticipated. Light pineapple notes. Slightly floral. A dry, yeastiness was apparent as well. Overall, pleasant yet far too subtle for the style. As the beer warmed, the yeast notes became stronger.  The flavor profile was tremendously dry, pithy and bitter. Tons of orange rind. Strong lemon notes. Peppery. Grapefruit peel dominated the back end. The super piney, resiny and dry finish bordered on astringent.  For a 7.2% ABV beer, the mouthfeel was disappointingly thin. The liquid contained a crisp, large bubbled effervescence that was quite distracting.  People typically have a strong affinity for or against Sierra Nevada's beers, and I happen to be in the later camp. Their signature yeast strain dries out their beers far too much for my liking.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S- Grapefruit, peaches, pineapple and pine sap! Has a really nice malt bill that shines thru as well.  T- The hops come in and wanna strip your tongue clean... but then this nice sweet, maltiness comes in and adds some caramel sweetness. Nice balance of orange, grapefruit, caramel malt, pineapple, pine and fresh cut grass.  M- Sweet and malty with a ton of tangy citrus! Grapefruit, orange zest and pineapple but with a nice dryness. Very well done!  O- Really nice interplay of sweet, dank pine, and citrus with a nice dry mouthfeel. This is a top notch IPA!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,steveh,4.23,"Needed a hop fix and saw the Torpedo 24 ouncers at the local. Didn't realize I'd never reviewed it before.  A -- Pours a hazy golden-apricot color with a foamy, but dense, off-white head that holds up well.  S -- Mildly piny, citric, and earthy hops with light biscuit malts eeking thru. There's even some mild DMS in the character that comes off as fresh.  T -- Very appetizing, piny-citric-earthy - even mildly herbal - hops in a nice blend up front. Some very mellow, but well-balancing biscuit malts in between, then finishes with a resiny, dryish bitterness that cleans up before it smashes your palate. Maybe the vaguest of alcohol pepperiness blending with the bitterness in the finish, but very deceiving.  M -- Mouthfeel is smooth and almost syrupy with some mild astringency from hops and alcohol. Body is medium to lightly-heavy.  O -- Overall, is it an IPA or an IIPA? Whatever the debate, it's a well-made, character-ful, hop-ful beer that is deceiving in its drinkability, but certainly not a session beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - Extremely hoppy citrus aromas that are quite pronounced. I get some lemon and a hint of like tangerine.  T - Citrus hoppy notes allround with some pine nut and a little grapefruit along with a little sweet malt on the rather dry and slightly bitter finish.  M - Medium bodied with good carbonation that is rather crisp and refreshing  O - Overall a pretty decent IPA with the hoppiness and bitterness at the finish balanced nicely.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,BeerFMAndy,4.53,"16 oz can poured into a Sierra Nevada imperial pint. 7.2% ABV, 2019717:12 on bottom of can.  A - Brilliant clarity allows the gorgeous bronzy amber color to shine vibrantly. It also shows tiny floating particles throughout the beer, gently rotated by the streaming carbonation. Rocky and tall, the ivory head lowers slowly, caking the pine in mounds of gooey lace!  S - Full-on hop-forward, Torpedo blasts an earthy combination of aromas into the air; from sticky pine resin to dry leaf and mulch pile, the aromatic nose is aggressive. Smooth Vienna-like malt imparts notes of caramel cube and toffee shard in the background for nice, albeit lopsided, balance.  T - Sticky caramel malt coats the tongue with it's base characteristics, slowly adding in toast notes before the hops totally take over. Earthy, almost musty like the aroma, the hops impart dry leaf, woody notes, and resiny pine that lingers through the finish. You won't find those bright citrusy characteristics here!  M - Medium-full bodied, Torpedo's sticky sweetness balances out the bold hop additions which fill the finish with a ""I-need-another-sip"" dryness and resiny, lip-smacking bitterness.  O - Total hop domination from Sierra Nevada, experts at balancing their bold hop creations, Torpedo meticulously combines smooth, caramelized malts with strong earthy hops and a faint warming alcohol finish for an awesomely bitter, delicious IPA!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

While I might enjoy a slightly lighter, fizzier mouthfeel, this was overall quite a good beer.  Pours a pleasant, 1.5cm, dirty white head that gradually fades to a thin ring around the glass. Leaves some lacing along sides of glass as head fades. Body is an orange-gold color, transparent, with plenty of carbonation along the sides.  Aroma of peach, pine resin, grapefruit rind, and balanced by light, sweet malts.  For the flavor of the beer, grapefruit mingles with pine resin and plenty of bitterness, with mild, cracker-like malt flavors arising as this washes across the back of the palate.  Beer is medium-bodied with fairly minimal carbonation, making this a bit sluggish on the palate. Resulting mouthfeel is generally smooth, though a bit turgid due to the less than desired carbonation.

S: Tons of pine with some floral/grassy characteristics and a little bit of sweet malt.  T: Really similar to the nose. There is a lot of pine, some floral hops, grassy notes and a bit of sweetness from the malt. The finish features a little bit of the sweet malt.  M: Drinkability is medium. It’s not the MOST abrasive IPA that I’ve had but there is plenty here to slow you down a bit. Body is medium, texture is dry, carb is lively and the finish is sort of sweet yet astringent. Weird.

The head is a three finger offwhite color with solid retention/lacing.  S: Not quite as citrus-y as I would have liked, but the smell of floral hops and underlying caramel malt works just fine for what this is trying to accomplish.  T: Much like the nose, the initial hop flavor is very floral, with subtle undercurrents of pine and citric notes, as well. After the dryness hits the palate, the citric quality is cranked up a notch (always a good thing!) The malty backbone pops up in the midtaste like it should in an IPA. After a while, very slight traces of alcohol appear, giving a faint fruitiness. Nothing groundbreaking, but V-E-R-Y drinkable with a great taste.  M: The hop profile leaves moderate bitterness on the palate, and while the finish is dry and slightly resinous, it encourages drinkability without ruining the palate. Body is slightly heavy with moderate carbonation.  O: One of the better IPAs I've had - and it's so readily available and well priced.

S: Nose of earthy hop with a citrus grapefruit background. There is definitely a balance of a sweet roasted malt as well.  T: Earthy whole cone hops really compliment the malt in this IPA. Certainly has the hop forward presence you would expect from an IPA but it doesnt leave you with a bitter face. Leaves a pleasant after taste in you mouth that keeps you sipping.

140,30420,SeaOfShells,4.42,"Straight from the can into my mouth.  A: This is purely based on memory, as I drank this straight from the can. It's really a typical looking IPA, with an off white, creamy head that sticks around for quite sometime.  S: Pungent, aromatic, piney hops coupled with biscuity malt and bread. Tropical fruits are present, but the pine dominates as far as hop profile goes. It's really an exception smelling beer.  T: For me, this is probably one of the best ""single IPAs"" out there, and out of the can, it's simply that much better. This beer is really, really bitter, but manages to be exceptionally balanced. Pungent hops, and sweet malts work in tandem to provide just the right flavor profiles. I wouldn't say it's underrated, but I also wouldn't say it gets the recognition it deserves. If you haven't had it, I suggest you pick up a four pack sooner rather than later. I believe Torpedo can stand toe to toe with any similar single IPA on the market.  M: Medium bodied, with a strong amount of carbonation. The hops leave a ""coating effect"" on the palate. This one stays with you long after the swallow. Very crisp, and clean. No complaints about this beer whatsoever.  O: This was already one of my go-to beers, and now that it's being canned, I can see myself always having this on hand.

140,30420,MadCat,4.5,"Well, I can see why so may people were excited for this to come to cans... it is great! Picked up bottles because I couldn't find cans, no biggie as its the same brew. Probably going to pick up the cans when I see them though.  Appearance: A golden amber color with a good light tan head that leaves good lacing  Smell: When you pour it, tons of floral hops come through, when you put your nose to it, you can pick up some pine and citrus and biscuity malts  Taste: Starts with pine hops and bready malts, then moves to the floral and citrus hops and caramel malt and fruit. The brew is weighted in favor of bitterness though some sweetness comes through  Mouthfeel: Medium to thick body with medium carbonation  Overall: An excellent brew, and I love how it is balance more towards the floral and citrus hops than pine and resin hops, and doesn't over do the bitterness. I feel some IPAs lean too much to bitter pine and resin hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,markmiller,4.35,"I sure do love this beer. My go-to for casual drinking, priced right at $15 for a 12pk. I'm reviewing this from notes after getting one on tap, which was even better.  Pours from the tap with a golden orange hue. Nice lacing and rings as its sipped.  Torpedo explodes with awesome hops aroma. Spicy and full of grapefruit and flowers.  High bitterness that tastes like pine and citrus in the best way. Just enough malt to make this so delicious and smooth.  This beer is sticky! Bitterness lasts and lasts and makes you want more.  Tastes so smooth and wonderful, the 7.2%ABV will sneak up on you!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,cosmicevan,4,"Have had this many a time but never in a can, enjoyed from the can to my Sierra Nevada pint glass.  a - brew poured the same transparent copper, orange with a nice frothy white head and sticky lacing. Steady and even carbonation throughout.  s - Nice balance of hops and sweet grassy malts. Citrus undertones. Smells great. More earthy than I remember.  t - Very even flavor. Balanced hops and malts. Some grassiness and earthy tones, not as hoppy as memory serves, but still very wonderful.  m - medium bodied and even, quality that you'd expect from Sierra Nevada.  d - is it the best IPA out ther? Not by any stretch of the imagination, but is it a beer you can count on? You bet. Sierra Nevada don't mess around and you can always rest assured in getting a quality brew from them.

Bitter lime peel and copper/metallic aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is great. Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Head added some substance to the beer and created a more hearty beer.

The head is thin but long-lasting.  A: The aroma is pine and citrus with some earthy herbs and just a bit of caramel.  M: Medium body and plenty of carbonation.  T: Begins with a mild caramel sweetnes that is quickly surpassed by an earthy herb-type bitter hops with some pine and a bit of citrus. There is just enough sweet malt to balance the hops burst. It leaves an aftertaste the is earthy and just a little spicy.

140,30420,MattSweatshirt,4.03,"Bottled on the 47th day of the year. So two months old.  Kinda reminiscent of the SNPA with a fluffy white head, clear body, and the carb bubbles, yet it differs in the body coloring. It’s got a deep orange/copper/gold mélange thing going on.  The first thing that really tickles my fancy in the aroma is the grapefruit hop. Their is also some pine and floral going on. A little caramel and bread. Hop dominate aroma for sure.  Mild hop bitterness grabs the attention of your taste buds. All the different hop aromas are present in the taste with citrus and pine but gets a little grassy/leafy. It seemed quite hop forward in the nose but the taste seems quite balanced with some caramel and bread/biscuit malt. I know I have had fresher based on the taste of this, but still a yummy IPA.  Medium bodied and dried the hell out of my mouth. Right up my alley.  Ya, I love this thing. A classic perhaps?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A bit of earthiness and black pepper come through mid palate. Finishes slightly bitter with spicy hops and a lingering graininess.  M - Smooth and slick. Crisp. Medium bodied with good carbonation.

140,30420,MONKandTUCK,3.13,"A - Deep Amber, almost a light brown. Good clarity and nice head. Kinda generic.  A - Not as stunning as I remember. A little vegetal. Kinda bland. Of course, most beers still don't have the citrusy blast and piney bite this one has, but it's not an on-tap IPA. Not sure it's not become too over-industrialized at SN.  T - Good hops, sometimes sharply bitter. It's hard to finish it all considering the hop quotient. However, it is sweet. Seriously, this is a sweet bastard. It tastes of a lot of caramel. leaner and dryer and I think I would be A LOT happier. I can't tel you why, but I remember this beer being so much more enjoyable.  M - Thick, somewhat creamy at first, but then it's fat and heavy.  O - As low as my review is, consider that I did not see this can filled. I have no idea how long much time passed since it was brewed until it hit my lips, but I was underwhelmed.  The reason I bother posting is because even though cans make sense... for IPA's and Pale Ales, they might be an absolute waste of product.

Some hints of floral scents, overall though the smell is not as present as I expect from other IPAs.  T: Hop hop hops, front end of pine sap and grapefruit rinds. Its a dry brew, something like a dry wine, which adds to the complexity. some taste of fresh cut pineapples, citrus and a little musky.  M: Medium body and good level of carbonation.  O: This is a good hoppy IPA. I find it a little weak on smell and less complex in flavour than Red Racer or Fat Tug, but still a good flavourful brew. I found that I actually preferred this one a little on the cool side.

Peel is there too, nice hoppy bitterness, with a good fruity finish and aftertaste.  M: Medium to full bodied, very good, not too fizzy to mask the taste but lively still.

140,30420,Morey,3.91,"INFORMATION: Pint sized can with no freshness date. I was hoping with the switch to cans that SN was finally going to start dating. No such luck.  APPEARANCE: Pours a copper-orange color with pretty nice clarity. The head initially stood a good 2 fingers tall, but has now settled to a spotty layer with some really impressive lacing.  NOSE: The aroma on Torpedo is definitely on the malty and earthy side for the style. Some piney resinous hops in there as well. Not really too much in the way of citrus though.  TASTE: What this beer lacks in smell, it more than makes up for in flavor. Malty and earthy flavor blend nicely with the bitterness from the hops. Just the right amount of sweetness towards the middle to help balance the beer. Finish is filled with that signature SN lingering hop bitterness.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium bodied, but for the style...it’s actually on the heavy side of medium. Moderate carbonation.  OVERALL: A nice IPA at an even nicer price. Glad to see this in 16oz cans.  Morey’s Bottom Line: This is my first Torpedo out of a can. Taste just as good as the bottle, although I was hoping for a freshness indicator of some kind. I really like this beer a lot.

S: Pine, citrus, and grassy hops over a sizable bready malt background. Not a huge nose though.  T: Nice hop punch up front - citrus pith, fresh grass, pine, grapefruit, herbal. The malt backbone stands up against the hops fairly well, and lend a sweetness without much caramel flavor. Not overly bitter, even into the hang.  M: A sturdy body for an IPA - seems closer to a DIPA. Alcohol is quite well-hidden on the tongue, although I do feel some warmth after the swallow. Moderate carbonation sensation.  O: Truly a solid, easily accessible IPA. Nothing spectacular, but a nice change of pace. Now that Jai Alai comes in cans, though, I don't know how many times I'll be buying this one.

Smells heavy on the pine at first, with roasted malt and alcohol becoming more prevalent as it warms. Taste is warm peppery lemon/pine hops with a good amount of caramel malt in the background. Oily feel due to the amount of hops, making it finish syrupy and semi-sweet, the sugary malt mixing with the dry bitter hops.  Overall, a good IPA that borders on being a double.

Nice after taste!  O - A delightful IPA, quite enjoyable!  I've been coming to this site for a few weeks now, but this is my first crack at reviewing a beer... ever. Honestly, I've only rather recently been introduced to the world of craft beers. Kind of embarrassing, but I've spent most of my beer drinking life (I'm 32) drinking mass produced schwag. To me, beer served one purpose and one purpose only - to get drunk... and to do so cheaply. About a year and a half ago I started to get into wine, which is when I actually began paying attention to what I was drinking. So naturally I started to become more discriminating in my selection of beer. As a recent transplant to central Texas, I discovered several nice local craft brews like Real Ale, Ranger Creek, Freetail, St. Arnold, 512, Live Oak, etc. From there I've discovered other great craft beers like Stone, Sierra Nevada, Boulevard, and New Belgium, and I can't wait to try the thousands of other craft brews out there.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: hops, hops, hops! as the smell suggests there is plenty to go around. and they compliment everything that's happening in this beer. front pallet is quite overwhelmed but balanced as the bitterness calms down and accompanied by a slight strawy taste with big notes of citrus. bitterness still lingers at the end but much more relaxed. some slight malt feel to help keep this one tame. amazing!  M: quite light in the mouth and as strange as it sounds, a pleasant harshness relating to the bite of this beer. extremely session-able for a 2IPA.

Appearance 8/10 - Outstanding offering by Sierra Nevada, I just find it one dimensional.  Smell 9/10 - Glorious hop activity, beginner hop head's dream.  Taste 6/10 - Again, too one dimensional for my liking, bitter hops too assertive and lacking a malty balance to cleanse the palate.  Mouthfeel 5/10 - Abrasive. I honestly wish hoptimum would replace this, for it has more balance.  Overall 5 out of 10 - Not worth going out of your way for.

White one finger head doesn't linger and only sparse lacing remains.  S: Relatively strong. Mostly pine, some grapefruit. Surprisingly lacking in pure hop oil aroma, which I like in my IPAs - a little disappointing.  T: Fantastically balanced. Starts with a nice bready malt that gives way to that wonderful SN pine and a nice amount of citrus. Finishes with a grassy bitterness and a bit of booze. Hints of soap, ash, aspirin - bit of everything. Delicious.  M: Dry and perfectly carbonated; crisp. Not much else to say.  O: SN hits it on the head, as always. A great IPA almost DIPA.

Sierra Nevada loaded a hop flavor in torpedo that is unmatched by anything else, huge aroma's and tastes of fruit and pine. The 7% alcohol tastes like it might as well be 3% as it is completely drowned out by the taste of fresh hops. Some how the beer has very low bitter foreground with a nice bitter finish.

The retreating head leaves plenty of sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Toasted malt and citrus and piney hops dominate the smell. It's a very pleasing aroma. The slightly sweet malt flavor hits the tastebuds up front as does the creamy head. Coming in on the back end are the citrus and piney hop bitterness that help balance this beer's flavor. The ABV is at 7.2%, but the alcohol does not come out at all in the taste. This is very well balanced and very delicious. The sweet and bitter balance only improves as it warms up. This is a medium bodied beer. The hops remain in the aftertaste and the carbonation is abundant enough to prepare the mouth for the next sip.

140,30420,ZethOfTheNorth,4.42,"12 oz bottle (dated March in a cryptic code, unintelligible without Google) poured into a mug. Six pack was bought at Whole Foods in New Orleans for the bargain of $8.99.  A: Pours a nice, rich, opaque amber-gold. A hard pour gets you a one-finger head that dissipates quickly. Lacing is slightly clingy but not hugely impressive.  S: I'd advocate letting a Torpedo chill out for a few minutes after pulling it from the fridge. That trademark pine smell really comes out after some warming -- so does a strong grapefruit aroma.  T: Superb. Actually a little malty up front, then tasty citric bitterness and that gorgeous resiny pine. A unique and fantastic IPA taste. Incredible that a 6 of this is less than $10.  M: A little sticky. Quick carbonation prickle at first, then it really smooths out nicely and the piney hop taste clings to the back of your throat a little. Very drinkable. Dangerously so.  O: Obviously BA gets it, but this feels like a still-underrated IPA. Dying to find it in cans, but still haven't seen that in New Orleans.

140,30420,Darkmagus82,4.33,"Poured from can into pint glass  Appearance – Pours a deep amber color with a huge off white head. The head is billowy and very persistent. Over time the fluffy head fades to give some very nice lacing. The look of this one is quite good.  Smell – Most potent is a very nice pine hop aroma. A little bit of floral and citrus hops are present as well and are mixed with a bready smell.  Taste – Throughout the whole taste the pine and the citrus hop flavors are present and mixed with a nice bready malt flavor. At the start the pine is the stronger of the hop flavor, but as taste moves on it becomes less piney and more citrus in nature. Toward the middle of the taste there is a lighter sweetness that becomes apparent. While the citrus is a more potent at the end, the pine taste is still quite prevalent. Overall the two hop tastes share the taste experience quite well and the transitions are all quite smooth. Well done.  Mouthfeel – The body is nice and creamy and has a medium level of carbonation. The brew really sooths the mouth with its body and really allows the flavors to permeates the tongue; allowing all those nice hop flavors to really be experienced.  Overall – this is quite a nice IPA. It has a very nice body and a very smooth, but still hoppy flavor. Easy to drink and very enjoyable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,TheQuietMan22,4.62,"Serving type: 12-ounce bottle. A cryptic batch code is printed on the label but no freshness date is provided.  Appearance: Straight pour into a pint glass. The color is light copper and is a touch hazy. Two fingers of beautiful, thick, eggshell-colored head dissipated very slowly, leaving trails of foam along the sides as it dissolved; it eventually left an even foam cover across the surface.  Smell: The definition of “balanced.” Caramel, toffee, and toasted malts tinged with grapefruit, orange, and lemon citrus. There may also be a little pine in there (it is an IPA, after all) but it does not stand out as much as the citrus.  Taste: The smooth caramel and toffee malt foundation is just as strong but is less noticeable because the hop flavors shine, providing an even zest and astringency that is a perfect blend of grapefruit, orange, and lemon citrus. As the beer warms the malt foundation becomes more pronounced and creates an excellent balance with the hops.  Drinkability: Whoa. This is very well crafted and I should have never expected anything else from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,rudzud,3.63,"Picked up a 16 ounce tallboy of this at Julio's. Poured into a Duvel tulip.  A - Pours a crystal clear coppery amber hue with a sudsy one finger white head that fades to leave a nice blanket and good side lacing.  S - Smell is of dank, wet hop leaves. Slightly herbal with light malt sweetness. Very earthy, almost like soil.  T - Taste of very piney. Pine needles though. Not very oily, but like I'm chewing on some pine needles. Especially in the aftertaste. I like a good piney beer, but, this...I dont know. There is a slight mineral/soil note to this, along with pine needles. I like that thick piney resin quality...not herbal. Just not my thing.  M - Mouthfeel is really good. Super drinkable, the ABV hidden nicely. Little sweet but with a bitter finish. Very drinkable.  O - Overall this isnt a bad beer, just not my favorite type of an IPA. Its good, and its drinkable, but I personally feel there are better offerings from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,stakem,3.66,"Pint sized can care of Kegatron, thanks again Heath! Poured into a standard pint glass this brew appears a perfectly clear, polished color of copper. Sitting atop is more than 2 fingers worth of yellowish stained froth. The cap maintains with solid retention that slowly fades leaving a webbing of lace sticking to the glass.  The aroma of this brew is fresh and herbal with hoppy notes of pine and resins. There is a bit of mineral character running through the nose coupled with a bit of alcohol sting. Across the back this brew is a bit cheesy with notes of sulfur and yeast. As it warms up, it gets a little vegetative with more of a focus on the leafy aspects of the hops. Not a bad thing, but overall not my favorite aroma that hops impart.  The taste is surprisingly toasty with plenty of malt backbone. A bit of toffee-like sweetness sits on the tongue before the resinous bite of hops comes into play with a flavor of herbs and pine. Just like the aroma led on, there is a bit of mineral component that blends into some sulfur/yeast/cheesy notes that while not bad is a bit distracting. As it warms up, the focus shifts to a flavor that is vegetative just like the aroma indicated but is accented by a slight spicy touch that keeps things interesting.  This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. For slightly more than 7% abv, the alcohol is really felt here with a warmth down the throat but it works to blend into the rest of the character. I am a fan of sierra nevada and most of their offerings but for some reason I just wasn't feeling this brew tonight. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to give this a try Heath, perhaps I need to give this one another go sometime.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,raynmoon,4.05,"The beers color is sort of orange/ tan straw like color, with a creamy head on top. It looks really nice.  It smells of half pine needles and citrus and caramel malts. Kind of reminds me of the complexity of their Pale Ale. It's not so one dimensional as other IPA's or DIPA's are.  One the taste, there is a nice piney hop presence followed by a smooth and strong malt backbone, but not so much that it pushes into East Coast IPA territory. Very sessionable. Get a 12 pack!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Hopdaemon39,4.08,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Corsendonk chalice- pours a clear copper color with visible effervescence, a one finger head, mild retention, and beautiful thick lacing.  Smell is ordinary for an IPA- a sort of equal mix of pine and citrus hops with some resin. Doesn't smell TOO ""bottled"", just a bit.  Taste is surprisingly very good for such an attainable IPA. Pale/amber malt background easily surpassed by the hops which come in waves- first a sort of citrus taste that I associate with Cascade, then some heartier, piny-er hops (Chinook and/or Centennial) that finish out the taste with a medium dry finish.  Mouthfeel is very good- medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Excellent bang for your buck with this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TheSixthRing,4,"Appearance - Pours a deep, reddish copper with a white, 2-finger head, giving away in due time to a decent, semi-sticky lacing.  Smell - Lots of citrus hop aroma, primarily a sweet, ruby red grapefruit aroma, backed by some sweet malt character and a faint bit of astringency.  Taste - Big, sweet and bitter grapefruit hops upfront, complimented by a nice, sweet malty backbone that doesn't detract from the major focus of the beer. Big, long lingering piney bitterness in the aftertaste, which I don't care much for. Sip after sip can snowball into an out of control hop attack on the tongue.  Mouthfeel - Medium body, great carbonation.  Overall - I'd love this beer a lot more if the aftertaste weren't so damn long lasting. Makes it rough to drink beer after beer. I feel like my tongue's gone to war with an acid bath. That said, this beer, in moderation, is damn good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CHADMC3,4.2,"Pours a deep copper body with amber hues beneath the dense, rocky off white head that dissipates to leave a scattered, yet sticky lacing.  Oily hop aromas leap from the glass, earthy and floral, almost herbal with hints of sweet citrus as it warms.  The flavor is equally packed with hops; earthy, piney, floral, and more citrusy than the nose lead on, with just a hint of malty sweet backbone.  Medium to fuller in body with generous carbonation and an oily, puckering veneer left on the palate.  Another great beer from SN with very style appropriate character and plenty to offer the nose and palate with a generous variety of pungent hops. This beer gets consumed quite quickly as you find yourself going back for more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Kegatron,4,"16 oz can into a tulip glass.  Pours a crystal clear copper, with several fingers of slightly of head. This settles down into a rich finger, leaving back robust sticky lace that clings in heavy swathes down the sides of the glass. The aroma smells leafy, spicy, and maybe even a touch minty, with some borderline medical feeling herbal character and tight green citrus character. Buttered cracker and caramel notes from the malt sit across the back of the nose with some softness.  The taste has leafy and spicy accents that spread out and surround a fresh and crisp feeling bitterness. Sweet flavors of bread and caramel from the malts balance the bitterness here well while simultaneously pushing that bold hop character to the front of the profile and helping keep it front and center, as this finishes moderately aggressive with a touch of raw pith and then some leafy spiciness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a soft crispness that firms up on the tongue yet still has a smooth slick creaminess to the overall feel that lets this go down easily. There’s a touch of alcohol on tail end of this but it isn’t overly noticeable.  Man, this is just a really solid American IPA, with full hoppy flavors and a malt backbone that balances yet still keeps the focus on those hops. It’s awesome that are packing this in tallboys now. I definitely see more of these in my future.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jarmby1711,3.5,Another American brew where experience was exceeded by expectations. Steeling myself to be assaulted by a bitterness of some proportion I was disappointed.

140,30420,enfield249,4.15,"A - Pours a perfectly clear amber with rust highlights. Lots off-white foam that fades to a thin layer.  S - Strong smells of medicinal hops. Slight maltiness.  T - Hop forward for sure. Lots of resin, pine and medicinal flavors. Then a little maltiness, that turns to a little sweetness.  M - Full, but also very strong hop bitterness. Almost like sucking on a fresh hop cone.  O - A very powerfully flavored AIPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,thecheapies,4.05,"Sierra Nevada Torpedo from a 16oz can into a pint glass. I believe, can dated 2/22/12.  Pours a true amber with great clarity and a foamy crystalline head that hangs over the rim. 4.0  Chalky malts and grapefuit hops with a touch of pine in the nose. Interesting dusty character. Fresh-smelling and hoppy. 4.0  Nice juicy grapefruit and grassy/leafy hop flavor and subsequent bitterness. Bready malts have that flour-dusted crust dryness that is ideal to back the green stuff. Clean, a bit floral, and garden-y to remind you that this is not Celebration. Traces of ethanol in the finish. A beer that induces the happy face every time you take a gulp. 4.0  Great body for an IPA. Nice slurping noise when you get a little air in your sip. Sudsy, creamy feel with great drinkability. Well above-average. 4.5  The best ones I ever had were on-tap, but these cans beat the bottles in my opinion. A knockout IPA that's on a shelf somewhere near you. Pick it up.

M: Full but not too heavy or ""thick.""  Value: How can anyone complain about Torpedo? For the price, this is THE BEST strong IPA out there and they sell it in my nearby 7-11. There is one neat store in my neighborhood where I can buy this in a 12 pack for $12.99. At a little more than a buck per beer, I dare you to find something even close.

140,30420,tewaris,4.18,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. The code on the bottle is 125721... per freshbeeronly, this is not very fresh. I haven't had any luck before so here it goes: pours hazy amber with an awesome off white head... a beautifully thick, creamy, pillow-y head with excellent retention and lacing. Taking a point off for the haze though :/  Aroma has the SN signature on it: West Coast hop profile leaning toward dankness, with the malts introducing some balance. Tastes clean, and flavourfully bitter. To me it's a cleaner, crispier, and drier version of SNPA. A lingering bitterness follows the finish with hints of tropical fruit. Light mouthfeel and good carbonation aid the experience tremendously. A good beer, steal at its price, and very enjoyable. I wish the ABV was 4.2 instead of 7.2... regardless, next time I buy a six pack of a straight up IPA, I will have another option besides Bell's Two Hearted, Founders Centennial, Furious and Mama...

Taste follows smell. Very bitter hops that lighten up in the middle then punish you at the end. Very hoppy for a non DIPA. Quite tasty.  Mouthfeel - nothing notable, pretty spot on for style.  Overall - a great go to beer. Very consistent, and I find that it lasts a bit longer than some other IPAs (flavor wise).

Pine and citrus for the hops as well as a slight peppery alcohol  T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the hops and goes into the malts followed by a slightly salty note and alcohol plus more hops. Finishes slightly bitter but very well rounded off  M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Slick and resiny from the hop oils  O: Definitely one of the best every-day value IPAs out there, hands down. This is slightly better out of the can, but that also might have to do with it being a couple weeks fresher than out of the freshest bottle I've had. In the long run, this will probably hold up better in cans because of the light issue, but that is yet to be determined because of the new addition of the cans.

140,30420,indiapaleale,4.47,"From the can (finally)...  Pour - dark auburn in appreance with some orange and reddish hues and big, frothy white head that sticks inside the glass like crazy glue. Absolutely fantastic looking beer coming out of the can and certainly flatters our plain can-shaped glass.  Aroma - spicy and floral with some sweet citrusy notes along with some raw sugar and burnt caramel aromas. Plenty of pine and tropical fruits as well. Quite aromatic and certainly appealing enough to make you want to stick your face to the glass and take a big sip.  Taste - malty sweetness hits the tongue first before the wave of bitter hoppiness, citrus and fruits like mango and pineapple assualt the palate. Smooth and balanced with a lasting tropical fruit flavor on the tongue and a friendly amount of bitterness. Sierra definitely did the right thing when they kept Torpedo and got rid of the other IPA they were brewing for awhile. This is a great beer.  Overall - Torpedo may be heavy on hops but it won't sink your palate like some of the double IPAs out there. With 65 IBUs and a solid malty backbone this is a balanced IPA with some serious drinkability installed. Pint cans are being sold in four-packs which is just about perfect.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S) I've had this out of the bottle on a number of occasions, and I recall the aroma being a bit more pronounced. This was just light pine and a little citrus, mild malt sweetness.  T) The flavor was much more bold than the aroma, and well balanced. Piney and full of zesty citrus taste, malty sweetness evens it out just enough. Rind on the backend, with a slightly bitter and tingly aftertaste. No alcohol detected.

In this IPA, you totally experience hops, both in taste, which is piney and citrus, and in mouth-feel, which suggests dry-hopping.

I am not sure if it's because it's canned versus bottled I've heard mixed feelings about both). Regardless drink it!  Mouth: Exceptionally smooth to the point that you will definitely not hate.

Resinous and piney with a forceful bitterness and muted fruity-citrusy notes. Clean and very drinkable, but on the heavier side for an IPA. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with that spot-on natural carbonation SN is known for.

The aroma is packed with piney hops and not much else.  Surprisingly, I didn't find this ""Extra IPA"" to be all that hoppy. Maybe after having Hopslam and Hoptimum so recently trying this was a bad idea. I got a lot of malt out of this, but only a subtle amount of hops. Again, maybe I should have waited a week or so after I have sampled such other hoppy beers.  Not a bad beer, but I really didn't get the hops too much and that's really what IPA's are all about.

After the head settled a bit I took a good whiff, nice and citrusy. It had the sharp smell typically noticed with a Double IPA, but I knew I was in for a treat. First sips were initially bitter but turned fruity and grainy soon after. Had a smooth, grainy finish.  In my opinion, this beer is easily drinkable but has a wide range of flavor that I am unable to capture. I like the bitterness of the hops, I really love hoppy beers. This is definitely a different kind of IPA compared to others, such as Stone IPA, which doesn't taste as grainy to me. I am no expert.

A few sips in the bold hops really kick in. As you drink the citrus, pine and bold American hops play off of each other to make for a fun drink.  M: Smooth, light and creamy, mildly carbonated.

I've been drinking this beer for a few years now so I have a handle on it. What I love is that it manages to remain unique among the onslaught of American IPAs. Crystal and Citra drive the hop profile, but it's not a citrus/tropical bomb like the other high-profile west coast IPAs (not saying I don't love those too). Torpedo features a strong spicy, black pepper note along with mint, herbs, and a background mango quality, pine sneaks into the mix as it warms.

Nicely constructed IPA. A slight sweetness accompanied by lots of nice citrus-like, sappy, tongue-bashing hoppy bitterness. The finish seems to leave your mouth coated with bitter hop oils, making you continue to taste this beer long after swallowing. Mouthfeel is firm and the beer is very drinkable.  This is easily one of the best bargains I have come across in craft beer. It is, in my opinion, the craft beer equivalent of Jim Beam Rye (a whiskey that's easy to find and costs less than $15 per bottle, yet is better than most ryes costing 2-3 times that much).

Overall another solid, drinkable, enjoyable, affordable beer from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,b3shine,3.36,"Bottle to pint. Looks good; burnt-orange with nice head. Smells Pretty average. This might be an old bottle though; hard to tell without a date. Tastes slightly better than average, but that’s not saying much. I hope it’s an old bottle... Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is MUCH better than this - and I prefer IPAs. Mouthfeel is average. Overall, nothing special - at all. The only way I’ll drink this again is if somebody buys it for me - before I can stop them.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Pahn,3.95,"16oz can into Duvel tulip. ""2040721:04"" printed on the bottom of the can, and the box said something like ""best by 9/12"" (threw it away already). The beer just came out in cans, so it's obviously fresh.  Appearance: Free pour yields a 2 inch frothy white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a few spots of lacing. Pours an almost translucent gold and leaves small, irregular lacing.  Smell: Greenhouse-y pungency, orange, some melon, and a lot of herbal aroma. Very fresh smelling, but not very bold. Gets more assertive with time and warmth.  Smells good enough that you're doing yourself a mild disservice if you drink it out of the can.  Taste: Herbal hops, some pine, with a toasted grain finish. Mild bitterness, clean finish. Smooth overall impression. A little citrus and tropical fruit, but mainly a very pleasant interplay of herbal, woodsy hops and pale malt. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Light side of medium bodied. Moderate carbonation. Neither dry nor sticky. Occasional wateriness (not juicy but *watery*) is the only overt flaw in an otherwise excellently crafted beer.  Overall: Great beer, great price. Particularly happy about it coming in cans; this beer needs to be shielded from light and oxygen as much as possible, as freshness increases the enjoyment exponentially.  As a sidenote, I really like the ""softness"" of the bitterness, belying the sort of ""every beer punches you in the face,"" reputation that Sierra Nevada occasionally seems to have (perhaps due to SNPA being so many people's first exposure to beer other than macro lagers or sweet Belgians). Despite the bravado in the beer's description, its delicate flavor balance is the real story here.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,SebD,4.67,"Appearance: It has a nice golden/orange color to it. It has a nice white head that dies down moderately and leaves nice lacing.  Smell: The aromas definitly give out hints of citrusy hops with tropical fruit (pineapple and mango) and some light caramelly malts.  Taste: Like the aromas, it has nice hop character giving it a beautiful tropical fruitiness, with some piney and floral notes and caramelly malts in the back.  Mouthfeel: It has a medium carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel and a nice lingering bitterness.  Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. Possibly one of the best IPA's I have ever tried.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,pschul4,4.51,"Have had this a million times but never reviewed it.  A- Pours a wonderful golden hue with a couple fingers of off white head that pull back to a nice ring of lace.  S- This has always been what I thought was the weakest part of the brew but when it's this good all around being the worst part is not a terrible thing. Faint hop scent that doesn't get stronger even when I practically dip my nose in it.  T- Boom! Remember all those hops you couldn't smell? They ambush your palate and make it beg for mercy. Huge fruity/piney flavors. Malt? We don't need no stinkin malt!

Poured from a (12oz bottle..not!) 16oz can with a canned-in date of 2 01 05 A 3 BT into a 22-1/2oz Libbey Citation snifter (embossed with the Dogfish Head logo and slogan)...third review to Beer Advocate's member: Avantyawn and kawilliams81  NOTE: The date coding on the can is not yet defined on their website, but do not think it is the same as the bottle, as the cans arrived to my retailer only days ago. Looking at the bottom of the can, I see 2040709:44. If interpreted correctly, that means that this brew was canned on February 9. 2012 @ 9:44AM.  A- Abosolutely clear amber colour with an enormous, 3+ finger frothy, white head with incredible lacing.  S- Sweet Orange, bitter (white) Grapefruit, and copious amounts of pine pummel the olfactory hues.  T- Malt sweetness is quickly subdued by the hops. Dry, tacky, piney finish is left with you wanting nothing more than another sip.  O- For a year-round offering (especially on the scale of Sierra Nevada), Torpedo is resinous and bitter citrus treat! A stellar brew from a ""can do no wrong"" brewery. For the price and accessibility, this has become a staple in my 'fridge.' A day is not complete without one of these beers. For me, 4-packs of 16oz cans will populate my cooling vessel until they stop.

Grapefruit, pine and underlying biscuit smelling malts. A hint of what almost strikes me as spearmint.  T- up front is a big bitter blast, very oily and coating. The hop flavor is quite complex, citric at first and turning piney and earthy, almost like an English IPA, but much more hop forward. There is a caramel/biscuit malt base to balance, but that is overshadowed by the finishing bitterness. Bitterness does hang on a bit long for my preference.  M- decidedly medium bodied, crisp on the palette. Dries pretty well on the finish, perhaps a little too aggressively.  O- you can certainly taste the family resemblance between this and SNPA. I could do with just a touch more citric hop character, but I'm honestly nit-picking. This stuff is top-notch. In Pennsylvania, the only year round IPA this good, at this price, is HopDevil.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,pburland23,4.32,"I've been meaning to try this one for a while and finally got around to picking one up.  Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a dimpled mug.  Appearance: Beer pours a bright, slightly hazy orange amber. Very clean looking pour. About one finger of white head. Head didn't stick around long but did make for some delightful lacing.  Smell: It definitely smells like a Sierra Nevada beer...a pepped up version of their pale ale. Huge piney hops notes with wildflower notes. I was pleased to detect a sizable caramel malt aroma as well. There's a strong sense of balance in the nose.  Taste: Flavor is similar to smell. There's a mouthfeel of bitterness in each sip. Citrus fruits...mango, grapefruit, some papaya. There's a minty herbal tea flavor in the middle of the sip which was unexpected but very pleasant. At the end, there's enough caramel sweetness that stands up to the intense hops characteristics. Finish is very dry.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with some sharp, upfront carbonation. It's resinous and slightly sticky. Alcohol is on the high side for an IPA at 7.2% but it's not altogether noticeable.  Overall: Sierra Nevada definitely unleashed the full potential of whole cone American hops. Big flavors, very drinkable. A very enjoyable American IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Givemeyourtiredandhungry,4.36,"Giving this a 4.5 overall because I'm sure that another beer is better than this one, BUT that's not to downplay this beer, it's a fantastic beer.  Appearance- The head was nice and thick and makes itself well known. The color of the beer was golden, but a few shades darker  Smell - Hoppy.  Taste - Wow! This beer has a plethora of different tastes. The first taste is bitter, but I get notes of citrus (faintly) and a bittersweet flavor. Caramel notes here also. It's a very rich experience of taste. The best way I can describe this beer's taste is Bitter with a sweet ending. I would recommend this beer, indefinitely.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Appropriate amount of bitterness that I would expect from an IPA. not overpowering though, and it feels well balanced. some piney/earthy undertones. Pretty nice.  Medium carbonation, it does not feel like it's 7.20% ABV. Quite smooth.  Sierra Nevada never disappoints me =) Good stuff. and a competitive price to boot!

140,30420,CPDalton,3.12,"Appearance: Pours a golden brown, with a sticky half inch of head. Not much sediment floating around, just some bubbles. Lacing isn't bad.  Smell: Not a fan of the smell, there's not much to it. Maybe mine is old or something, but the smell reminds me of Heineken. A little sweet, but kind of blah.  Taste: The taste is much better than the smell. I get a little fruit upfront, but the hops come in immediately. It's one big bite of hops, and the bitterness lingers. This is balanced with a little bit of malt presence. Finishes really dry.  Mouthfeel: Feels a bit thick. The dryness might add to that. Stays with you.  Overall: I've had this before and remember liking it a little more than this. The smell was terrible, and I didn't get much of a complex flavor, just a really big in-your-face kind of hoppy bite.

Some malt is detectable along with a hint of alcohol.  Bitterness is present from the get go which is to be expected. There is wonderful tropical hop flavor along with some pine. There is a solid malt base underneath with a slight caramel flavor. Everything cleans up nicely leaving a pleasant bitterness.  This is really an outstanding IPA. Very well balanced with a hearty strength. Really one of the better bargains out there.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

SUPERIOR I said.  A: Huge frothy head, filtered copper appearance.  S: Delicious fresh hop aroma! Creamy graham cracker, spicy earth, very very rich and complex. Unusual for an IPA.  T: Spicy hops, some nice sweet breadiness, but never does the taste settle on bready or malty, always the spicy hops. Tastes wonderful.  M: Super creamy, medium thick for an IPA, very full bodied and satisfying.  O: This beer is a whole new ballgame in the can! I have always been lukewarm on this beer from the bottle, but this is simply splendid in the can. Super fresh and creamy. Never will I doubt the power of canned IPAs from here forward!

I love how the hoppy bitterness just melts away in your mouth.  m-there might not be another beer that makes me want to say ""ahhh"" more its just so clean and the flavors all linger for a second as the beer interacts with the entire palate.

140,30420,TechTriumph,3.91,"Bottled: 12/22/11 at 3:36pm; Poured in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.  A - 1-1/2"" of off-white fluffy head with excellent retention; Appearance is clear with a copper/caramel color; Lots of visible carbonation within the glass; Lovely webs of lacing left behind  S - The aroma is pretty faint, which is probably due to this being a 2 month old bottle, but pleasant from what I can tell; Notes of pine, grapefruit, apricot, and some sweet caramel  T - Hops dominate the taste, but seem like they have mellowed a bit in this bottle; Hop flavors include pine, grapefruit, pepper, apricot, light apple and pineapple, with just a bit of onion in the finish; Sweet caramel and toasted toffee provide a little bit of balance; Decent bitterness up front that fades by the end of the taste  M - Moderate carbonation; Medium bodied; Fairly dry finish  O - Even though this beer is 2 months old and the hops seem to have faded somewhat, it's still very delicious. Sierra Nevada releases quite a few IPA's throughout the year, and while this beer may not top them, it's right in the same league and great to have year-round. This is a beer I could drink often, but I'll be sure to get a fresher batch next time for maximum enjoyment.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TonyC,5,"Have to say that this is one of my favorites.  A: Very nice white head. Light amber color with great carbonation.  S: Subtle earthy/citrus hops aroma.  T: Strong hops flavor with a nice citrus touch.  M: Nice mouthfeel with excellent carbonation.  O: Awesome choice for true hops lovers. Flavorful, but still smooth enough to enjoy.  As a home brewer, I do love hops. But, it's easy for some beer companies to just pile on the hops and brag about it. But unless the hops are balanced to work with each other, it is just a waste. Torpedo uses Magnum, Crystal and Citra hops, which work so perfect together. Excellent hop balance!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TempeBeerMan,4.48,"Poured from a bottle into a nonic pint  A – Pours a hazy deep bright gold with a one-finger head of eggshell colored suds. Good retention and lacing, lasting until the glass was done. (Although that’s admittedly not that long, haha)  S – Resinous hops and citrus. Overall aroma fairly pungent.  T – Grapefruit bomb alert!! Seriously though, this beer does have a rich malt profile balanced with bitter, piney, west coast hops. In addition to the aforementioned grapefruit, also has esters of orange and tropical fruits (papaya). The hop choice is excellent, as it manages to be suitably grassy and some herbal character comes out in the finish. Very flavorful, and everything blends together wonderfully here. 7.2% abv not detectable but adds body and depth.  M – Medium bodied with prickly carbonation, and a perfect accent to the flavors. Finishes dry, letting the hops linger and dance on the back of the tongue. Absolutely nailed it here.  O – Outstanding. Just a really solid, balanced, flavorful, and complex IPA. Enough going on to keep your taste buds from getting bored. I immediately wanted to down the whole glass. Now is my staple beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JimHulley,3.75,"12 oz bottle poured into pint glass.  Medium amber color, little head.  Torpedo is always a pleasure to drink with a delicious piney and citrusy taste. GREAT balance of fruity essence with hoppy flavors. In my opinion it’s really the that balance that sets it apart from your everyday IPAs as it has strong, but not overly one-sided flavor.  Another beer that goes great with cake.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,grannaniwa,3.62,"Big nose, very pungent hop aromas, kind of pot-like. Reminds me just a touch of the normal Sierra Nevada pale ale nose, but has much more of a bite. Flavor is very much in-line with the aromas... a bong-water bitterness at the beginning of the swallow, medium body in the middle, and a nice piney bitterness left in the back of the mouth at the very end.  “Sierra Nevada Torpedo is a big American IPA; bold, assertive, and full of flavor highlighting the complex citrus, pine, and herbal character of whole-cone American hops.”  Overall: B+, but not an everyday fit for me",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Tucquan,4.23,"Had this on 2012-02-18 in Marietta, PA at McCleary's. Had this again on 2016-03-12 in Columbia, PA from a 16oz can that is 75 days old. Still tasting really good. Amazing how well these hops hold up. I didn't change the verbiage below or the ratings from my initial review from 2012.  A - Very clear, Amber-orange with a 1-finger head and decent lacing.  S - Mild orange flesh, floral hops and pine. Pleasant but not extraordinary.  T - Medium roasted malt with light caramel sweetness. Bold and bright grapefruit juice, orange rind, pine. Bitterness is nicely aggressive and lasts long into the aftertaste.  M - Smooth and crisp with light-medium body and medium-high carbonation.  O - I had this after a 13-mile hike on a warm, winter day and I'm here to tell you, this really hit the spot.

I did not like the beer the first time, so I held out on reviewing so I could give it another chance. I am glad I did.  The beer pours the typical clear amber color of an IPA, but maybe slightly darker than the norm. In the smell, I get a good mix of citrus and piney hops. Smells like a well-balanced IPA.  Plenty of hops as promised, but more of the piney bitter hops than the citrusy hops. Still a very drinkable above average IPA that is probably more hoppy than the average IPA too, and you can't beat the price that Sierra Nevada sells this for.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Etan,4.27,"12oz poured into a Libbey regular pint glass.  A: Pours a crystal clear dark copper, with a thick off-white head and good lacing.  S: Smell is mostly sweet citrusy hops, with notes of pineapple and orange.  T: Opens with some breadiness mixed with spicy hops, followed by the citrus components comprising the smell, followed again by bold malt breadiness. Good dose of salty bitterness lingers from the hops, lining the mouth and inviting another sip. Hop spiciness reminds me of rye; one of the best balances between bready maltiness and hops in a single IPA I've had. The hops are juicy and sweet, and then pithy and bitter. Yum. Faint taste of alcohol in the finish.  M: Creamy carbonation carries the beer well.  O: One of my favorite single IPAs. Great hop flavor and great balance with the malts, with that signature Sierra Nevada taste. Delicious.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: Bitter citrus and pine. Some herbal, leafy greens mint. There is some bready, malty sweetness as well.  T: Bitter citrus hops, grapefruit and oily herbal pine. Nice malty, bready backbone to balance things out nicely. Bitterness lingers with a dry finish.  M: Creamy and smooth, medium bodied, nice crispness.  O: Liked this one a lot.

Taste is hoppy, citrus and grapefruit up front, nice dose of pine rolls in, semi sweet biscuity malt, perfect bitterness throughout, pine in the finish with a long hoppy aftertaste. Medium carbonation, incredibly slick and oily, full body and nice feel. Nice IPA here, incredibly flavourful, even though this is a hop bomb it doesn't feel that way and actually has a decent balance for something so hop driven, really good stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,coalcracker,4.22,"Appearance: Pours a dark gold with just a little carbonating head. Light lacing forms through the tasting. Smell: Assertive hop aroma consisting of pine resin, grassy aroma. A little bread also noted but is pleasantly overpowered by the hops. Taste: Immediate big hop presence with moderate bitterness. Again, piney and grassy with just a touch of biscuity malt presence. This hop punch exerts a slow but lingering burn throughout the tasting. Finish is dry. Mouthfeel: Medium to just above average body- bigger body for an IPA (thus the term extra-IPA?). Not quite a DIPA, but close!  Overall- Just a big hoppy treat!

A: dark orangey amber in colour, coming with mild carbonation, a thick and tight dark beige frothy head, and very good clarity. S: clean citric hop aroma intertwined with perfumy, sour-sweet esters and lightly sweet pale malts; a good swirl brings out nectar-like intense sweet liquid, lychee shell-ish flowery aroma of hops, some pine-ish notes of hops (again), toasted tea, a touch of sultanas or overripe white grapes, and many good elements harder to relate to anything specific. Very enticing and yet well balanced. T: a refreshing swallow of lubricating bitter-sweet malts and piney-resinous hops shows a beautiful integration of malt’s dark fruity edge and hop’s juicy citric & pine-ish flavour; growingly bitter, chewy and even dry (like the dry-ish touch of roasted tea) in the aftertaste with an edge of phenol, with an intensifying flow of herbal hop tannins creeps up to render a satisfyingly long and complex finish. M&D: moderately carbonated but very refreshing on the palate, this is a full-bodied ale that tastes ever so light and even thirst-quenching due to a marvellous balance.

Weeds and bittersweet pine sap formulate the main aroma, a little sickly sweet over ripe pear accents puncture in the foreground as well. First sip starts out mellow then quickly turns to bitter one sided hops. Pine, pine and more pine on the palate. If you wanted to show a friend what piney hops tasted like here's your go to.

It finishes with orange and hops.  M - It is very smooth but could use a bit more carbonation. A bit heavily bodied for the style but finishes crisp.  O - Good IPA, especially for the cost and ABV.

SN always nails appearance, its what separates them from Sam Adams.  S: Not a whole lot, piney hops, a touch of bready malts. From my experience older IPAs lose smell before taste, so I can deduct too many points.  T: Yummy, taste is a complex arsenal of hop flavors. Primarily pine based, also a lot of flowers and grapefruit as well. Just enough malts to balance it out and make it more session-able. I can imagine how good the hop presence would be fresher. A pine-y west coast hop profile.  M: Highly carbonated, a bit oily, ""wet"", rich, impressive. For an ipa reasonable session-able.  O: Man o man, for a 4 month old IPA this is really awesome.  Edit: 5 weeks old More of a Pacific northwest hop mix of pine and flowers. Big caramel backbone. Classic Americano.

As it warmed up the smell started coming through much stronger. T- lots of citrus and floral notes with a strong pine aftertaste M- It was on the medium/light side, smooth and easy to drink, medium to high carbonation  overall: This is a very good session beer and because of the availability and low price, i will likely be coming back to this one very soon. The only downside is that i think some people may be put off by the high carbonation after knocking back a few.

S: I'm getting a nice even balance of piney and citrusy hops and bready malts.  T: Very true to the nose except a little more hop forward. Starts off with some citrus and finishes with a big piney hop flavor. Just enough malt backbone for my tastes. Finishes dry and bitter.  M: Nice lively carbonation. Crisp and medium bodied.

Nice citrus smell from the hops and a hint of pine with a good amount of sweetness from the malt. The taste is very solid, good citrus taste mostly a grapefruit taste, then a very slight pine flavor this all balances well with the sweetness from the malt. The malt gives this beer great body for the style also the amount of carbonation is on point. Overall at the price point of $9-10 this is one of my go to beers to keep always on hand.

Taste- Excellent as always.Love the slightly neutral creamy taste followed by the hops slapping your taste buds for the bitter finish.

Smell: Citrus fruit, grapefruit, grapefruit pith, possibly a bit of malt sweetness (faint, most was covered up by the hop aroma).  Taste: Citrusy, mostly grapefruit like the smell would suggest, slightly dry, definitely like eating a bit of a grapefruit's pith (I'm being repetitive, I know). Hops up front with just a bit of maltiness sliding in afterwards. Carbonation is on the money.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation was spot on, body was solid (not too thin, but not chewy. More towards the thin side though.) I think this is right where an IPA should be, especially for a west coast IPA.  Overall, this is a very good beer. A very solid IPA and an enjoyable drink.

I'm guessing it's probably chill haze because the first time I had this beer I remember it being perfectly translucent. About a 1/2 finger of off-white head forms and fades to a thin film within a few minutes. Thick rings of lacing line the glass all the way down.  S - Big citrusy notes up front. Some sharp grapefruit and pine as well. Also a definite background of sweet honey-like malt.  T - Sweet honeyed malt up front with lemongrass and citrus notes. Bitterness definitely comes in toward the middle and lasts well after each sip. Orange rind and light caramel malts predominate through the finish. Great straightforward west coast IPA with a little extra oomph.  M - Medium body with good drinkability.

140,30420,TheBrewo,4.11,"This was served from the bottle at Jembetat Gallery and Café in Rochester, NY. It was poured into a footed, Weizen-style pilsner glass, and glowed a rusty brown color. It held a two finger whitish head. This showed insane retention. We couldn’t even get close enough to smell it until fifteen minutes had gone by. It stood there like fresh whipped cream. The lacing left when it finally did start to die was equally as impenetrable. There was modest haze, and light carbonation. The aroma was bright with piney hops and earth. There was an additional grapefruit sweetness that nicely complemented the solid, more pale malts. With warmth came faint lactics. As we sipped, holy pine cone!! As in the nose, there was deep earth and huge hop activity. The malts were also present up front, completely balancing everything, a shade better than in the nose. On the back, pulling us to the middle, was a light tropical fruit flavoring. The middle showed red grape sugars, malting sourness, and clean hops, keeping the palate fresh and alive. The finish was with thick hop oils and resin. There was more beautiful balance, but by the last drops the hops became more bearing, with a lemony, citric sweetness. The aftertaste breathed of bitter minerals, ridiculous pine, lemons sugars, and drying tannins. The body was on the lighter side of medium, and the carbonation was medium. There was great slurp and smack, with phenomenal cream and sip from the head. There was a slight astringency, making this a well-rounded feel. The abv was appropriate, and the beer drank easily and smoothly.  Overall, what we enjoyed best about this brew was the balance, and smooth flavoring throughout. The peaks and dips in flavor are not too extreme, but offer nice variety through the evenly balanced base. The light tropical fruits were nice, helping to lighten things up a bit. This is a great standard that doesn’t hold back on the flavoring at all.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,coachdonovan,4.33,"Hard to believe this one has been around for only three years; now it's the best-selling IPA in the country. The beer in front of me was bottled last Dec 2.  Let's make this one a special occasion and pour into a tulip. The golden orange has some haze to it, and if I look closely I see some fine particulates. HUGE airy puffy head shoots up beyond the glass and as it settles, the intricate lace is like sea foam. The aroma has some citrus to it, but pine is more prevalent with spicy pepper and herbal hints in the background.  Given the lack of powerful citrus smell, I'm pleasantly surprised by the sweet fruit flavor that shows up first. Things dry out quickly as the hops wreak some havoc on the tastebuds. SN absolutely nailed it with the mouthfeel.  Only the intensely bitter finish keeps me from wanting a whole six pack at once; for IPA fans and hopheads that won't be a problem. This is a fantastic beer, but you already knew that.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,damndirtyape,4.08,"12oz bottle poured into a milkshake pilsner glass. Batch/date stamp is 128722356 - whatever that may mean.  Appearance: Coppery-orange translucent/slight haze beer with a persistent 1/16"" off-white head. Very persistent lacing in big sheets, and strands. Nice looking beer.  Smell: Grapefruit citrus, pine, orange, and a nice malt backbone. Quite appealing.  Taste: As expected, a very hoppy beer. Bitter at the start and the finish, with pine notes, a good malt in the middle to counter the hoppiness a bit, and then a strong grapefruit citrus flavor throughout.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, but nicely thick and creamy underneath the carbonation. Some hop oil sticking to the teeth.  Overall / Drinkability: Nice looking beer with an outstanding mouthfeel. Very hoppy and pleasurable to drink, but one is enough per evening. The grapefruit citrus does get a bit tiring after awhile, but that's the point of this beer, isn't it?

Delicious.

But this is one hoppy beer, pine and some citrus but this is full of some strange skunky hops (Marijuana), and I mean that in a good way . Not as much bitterness as I expected either. M- This is a fairly easy to drink IPA, not an overwhelming amount of bitterness and an caramel structure. A bitter aftertaste but a good overall feel afterwards.

Clean flavor profile, could use a bit more malt backbone.  Mouthfeel and drinkability both get high marks.  Overall another solid offering in an ocean of American IPA's.

140,30420,GetMeAnIPA,4.36,"A - nice rich amber color. Looks very inviting. Good light creamy head with a good amount of lacing. I gave the look a 5 because when I see the beer in a glass I can think of nothing else but how much I want to drink it!  S - smell is a nice balance of hops, pine, and citrus. The smell isn't as powerful as I thought it would. Has the classic Sierra nevada smell but with a little backbone to it.  T - the first rung to hit the taste buds is the citrus and pine, and followed up with the bitter hops. The malt keeps the hops from betting too bitter. The great thing about this beer is it has enough hops for the IPA lover, like myself, and enough balanced malts to keep non IPA drinkers reaching for a 12er or 6 pack, or even a bomber...that's another great thing about it. You can get the beer year round in whatever amount you prefer.  M- all Sierra Nevada beers have a more heavy/chewy mouth feel. When I preferred the lighter beers the Sierra Naveda beers were a little chewy for me. However, as my palate changed the mouth became a little less heavy. Medium among of carbonation which I prefer, not a big carbonation guy.  O- one of my favorite IPAs. It fits nicely between the standard IPA and the double IPA. You can't taste the booze and goes down smooth. Great balance of hops and malt, but heavier on the hops side for a great IPA.

Nice whispy lacing on the glass.  The aroma is per description with the aromatic citrusy piney hops coming forward atop the amber malts.  The flavor follows the nose with a definate citrus/pine hop flavoring character, but the bitterness is just enough to keep the sweetness of the malt in check. Very well balanced in my opinion.  The mouthfeel is slightly higher than medium and the carbination is lower than medium and the hop feel hangs around for a bit.

I originally found this beer at the local Albertson's (a chain supermarket) a couple of years ago and I had never seen it before, even though Sierra Nevada beers have been a staple of mine for 10+ years. I was pleasantly surprised by the boldness of the hops, usually you dont find beer with this much hop character in a mass chain supermarket.  This beer has become one of my favorites when I am looking for something with a little edge to it, and by 'edge' I mean hops... anyway, ON TO THE REVIEW ;)  Appearance: Caramel color, slighty opaque, 1cm head on pour which easily reforms with agitation, head consists of nice tight bubbles which almost give it a nitro appearance. Head will hold 1-2mm for duration of drinking  Smell: Piney, resin, with some malt sweetness with agitation  Taste: Hoppy bitterness jumps on the tongue with first taste, carbonation ""pops"" on tongue for a ""bright"" taste  Mouthfeel: Hops grab the tongue and do not let go without a fight!

140,30420,Chadpaq,4.13,"Look: 4.5 Soap-sudsy head that rises quite quickly with a semi-aggressive pour. Darker than a hophead's IPA. The skepticism sets in. Even so, one can't deny that this brew is gorgeous. Fresh viscous caramel when penetrated with light. Lacing's big. As I said: Sudsy.  Smell: 4.0 Initial burst of citrus, but I soon realize this isn't the star of the show. Bitter hop strains. Semi-malty backbone. I smell more alcohol than 7.2% would lead me to believe. Undoubtedly fresh...this thing wet-hopped? I need to know more about the apparatus that is this beer's namesake.  Taste: 4.0 Mimics the nose. Slightly better. Wish I could give it a 4.25 here. Fruity initially, followed by lip-puckering bitterness. Medicinal, but the type of elixir I'd like to be prescribed to for the duration of my days.  Feel: 4.0 Smoother than your run-of-the-mill IPA. Seems slightly less carbonated, and more concerned with the integrity of its ingredients than the number of its bubbles. A very well-built, enjoyable product as it slides down thy gullet.  Overall: 4.5 Considering the freshness, availability, and, most importantly at this point in my life, price of this beer, it's pretty darn unbeatable for a hophead like me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Hops is definitely the featured player here, but it's not all hops.  Nice mouthfeel, slick and oily with some chewiness.  I'm not generally a hophead, and it's only four or five times a year I get in the mood for a hop-centric brew, but this is very good!

Lots of lacing, and few cm of head retention.  S: Strong citrus and pine hop aroma, and quite a bit of sugary sweet sticky malt. More malt than you might expect. The citrus aroma is very heavy on the rind more than the fruit itself. Smells a little too sweet for me.  T: Bittering hops hit right from the start; lots of grapefruit and pine, hints of floral. The sugary malt picks up with a very solid body, but doesn't quite match up to the hop bitterness. Finishes dry and bitter with lasting hop flavor. The lingering hop flavor reminds me of green bell peppers.  M: Solid medium body with just enough carbonation. Almost sticky at times, and a dry bitter finish.  O: Very tasty and enjoyable. I keep forgetting this isn't an imperial, which I'd say is a plus.

140,30420,xmorgan,5,"I had a chance to attend an event Sierra Nevada did a few years ago at the Bistro in Hayward. Damn fine beer establishment!  They were coming out with Torpedo and a few others.  The Bistro is Hop Beer Hevean and I was having at that time a love affair with Russian River's ""Blind Pig"" or ""Ex-Girl Friend"" as I like to call her.  I was not super flavorful of Torpedo. Well tonight I worked late, was out of beer, I stopped at the 7-11, hoping, I might find something other then pissy yellow beer, as I really, really wanted a beer and it was just before midnight.  They had Torpedo. Well, Sierra, you get another chance. Apperance: Pours a orangish red color with lots of foamy deliciousness in the head. smell, at first, the hop aroma is faint, but it is there. Not overwhelming and you have to hunt for it. Taste: Nice bitter, citrus, piney and MALT balance. It is too drinkable.

140,30420,VaterRoss,4.47,"Serving 12oz bottle into New Belgium snifter, no best by visible.  Looks a slightly hazy amber (almost copper) with a white head that falls away a bit too soon for me, lacing clings to side of the glass. The smell is of piney hops, with some grapefruit grapefruit citrus. Very fresh smelling. detecting some malt at the end of the smell. Taste: again with the grapefruit citrus but way more pine going on, some malt, finishes with delicious and clean hop bitterness. Mouthfeel has some tingling (spiciness) from hops and a moderate carb. As it warms, alcohol can be detected.  Not too complicated but fairly bold tasting, an excellent benchmark IPA. Wow, a world-class IPA with near ubiquitous distribution at 9 bucks a six pack? A very easy recommendation. Like drinking a pine-cone, in a good way.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,PorterLambic,4.5,"I will freely admit that I rarely drink IPAs because they are too hoppy for my tastes under most circumstances. But with this high a rating, this beer deserved a chance.  Pours a clear, bright orange/amber with a full 1 1/2"" of light tan head. Fairly creamy though nowhere near a tap drawn Guinness quality. After the initial settling, the retention on the remaining 1/2"" is truly amazing. A very nice lacing, though a bit scattered, remains. Smell is well-balanced with notes of wood, floral, citrus with lighter notes of citrus and evergreen and a faint malt and yeast in the back. Taste is a nice mix of malt and hops, lighter citrus and some woody resin. Balance is good and for an IPA I would consider this pretty complex. After warming some alcohol presence is seen. Medium bodied, fairly high effervescence, dry finish with a woody/resin/citrus aftertaste. This is a really good IPA and a pretty good beer overall, in fact, this is better than their Pale Ale by a good amount. And less hoppy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,BigDoug,4.25,"Had this beer several times and this is the first time I've had it in a while so I figured I'd review it.  Poured into a tulip.  Pours a brilliant dark orange, very clear. Nice frothy white head that built up nicely about 1.5"" or better. Letting it settle down to a thick crown, leaving perfect sticky lacing on the glass.  Smells wayyy better than I remember! Maybe a super fresh case? Very very bright floral, piney, fruity dank hops. Smells like high quality marijuana almost. Very potent and addicting to smell. Amazing aromatics flying outta this thick crown of head settles on top this beer. Hints of mango, maybe pineapple? All the characteristics of the complex Citra hops and Cascades. Don't really pick out much malt notes other than maybe some slight caramel notes that keep this smelling like a beer and not a bag of hops. Very pleasing.  First sip punches ya with the same as it smells. Very aromatic. Gets the sinuses overwhelmed with hop glory. Hophead dream. Follows with a strong intense but very clean bitter. It's the kind of bitter that a true IPA lover craves and appreciates. To get the best flavor outta this beer or any good beer especially hoppy ones is to drink them at the right temp. This beer was straight off my porch so it was right around 50-55 degrees F. Could taste so many different flavors. The malt is there jus enough to keep all that hop kick in check. Balanced enough but still way hop forward.  Mouthfeel is on point for the style. Nice carbonation. Smooth but enough carb to keep the bright flavor popping out. Creamy finish and leaves the palate clean with a little hop oil left behind.  Drinkability is pretty good considering the pretty big ABV and big time bitterness. It's a beer that the flavor keeps ya wanting more. After a few you'll be pretty good feeling.  Better IPA's out there? Absolutely, but you'll pay a whole lot more for them. This beer you get way more than what you pay for and that makes this beer a top world class IPA in my books. It contends with the baddest cuz it is one of the baddest. Love that it's basically the same price as their amazing Pale Ale but way more of a beer. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T- A fantastic combination of piney hops, grapefruit, sweet bread faint esters, and a long lasting and powerful bitterness.  M- As previously mentioned this is a rather bitter beer with a medium mouthfeel. It could potentially be a bit too bitter for those less inclined to the taste, but to me it is fantastic.  O- As a recent transplant to the west coast, I think I can confidently say that I've found my go to everyday IPA.

140,30420,cmq103,3.95,"Poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.  Appearance: Amber in color and with a semi-aggressive pour I was able to produce a 1/4"" off-white head, which yielded sticky, spotty lacing as my glass emptied.  Smell: Citrus hops and pine dominate with a mild malt sweetness. Aroma is lighter than I expected for an APA from Sierra Nevada.  Taste: Bold citrus hops with a definitive pine bitterness. A mildy sweet and light maltiness is present, but humble enough to sit in the back of the class. What you'll remember most is the hoppy pine bitterness in the finish, as expected for the APA style, which just stays on the tongue long after each sip.  Mouthfeel: A moderate body, with just the right amount of carbonation to ensure the bitterness lingers on the tongue long after the swallow.  Overall: This APA will appeal to all ""hop-heads"" out there. More hoppy than their pale ale with an added kick from the 7.2% ABV, which is very well hidden. The sharp bitterness is what will keep IPA fans coming back for more. A little too bitter for me to have more than 1 or 2 in a sitting. I prefer when the malt is able to pull back the reigns of bitterness somewhat.

140,30420,McStagger,4.23,"Re review! Now that I've seen the field, so to say, I'm going back to give the old stand by a review.  A: Pours a dense, opaque copper/orange. Two fingers of slightly darker than khaki head. Retention = stellar. Lacing = stellar. Hard to get a gauge on the carbonation. Looks moderate, but there's quite a bit of particulant in the suspension. Looks like we're bottle (can) conditioned here.  S: Big monster caramel malt. Massive pine needle and grapefruit pulp presence noted as well. The malt is dominant, though. Bit of...cinnamon? Nutmeg maybe? Not sure. Definitely a dessert spice in there. Combined with the breadiness of the yeast, leads me to believe this beer may be sweet.  T: And it is, for about 2/10's of a second. Hops take over the malt fairly quickly. Grapefruit, pine...a lot of evergreen in this one, actually. Malt presence isn't completely subdued and you get a bit of husky graininess. Still, the piney quality seems to dominate here. Floral, borderline astringent bitterness on the end. Finishes fairly dry, but there is some malt sweetness intermingled.  M: Huge bodied. Quite the opposite of the leaner, crisper bodied IPA's I prefer. That's purely subjective, though. The massive body works with the pine and evergreen dominant hops.  O: A damn good IPA. Fuller in body than my liking, but that's a stylistic preference and not a knock on the beer's overall quality. This is my first choice for camping beer. Seriously, I can't think of any other beer I would rather camp with than this. Perhaps it's genius marketing, or the brewers at Sierra Nevada managed to capture the awesome scent of a pine forest in a pint glass, but I will forever link camping with this beer.

Lots of small bubbled carbonation coming up from all sides. 2+ fingers of off white head that's extremely rocky on top. Nice lacing. The color is a nice burnt caramel with exceptional clarity. This beer looks amazing!  S: Whoa... lots of really dank hops. Some citrus notes but really I'm getting that full cone dankness. Nice caramel malts are providing a good counterpoint to the aroma.  T: Lots of bitterness hits me up front. There's a great citrus quality to it. When I really chew on it I get tons of that bitterness. However when I sip on it I get a really nice bready/caramel maltiness. There actually is a really good balance in this beer. What I'm left with on the finish is a really great spiciness from the hops.  M: Medium - light body. Great carbonation carries this beer. The hop oils are very easy to identify too.  O: Worth the praise it gets as being an excellent single IPA. I'd place it somewhere in between a 4.0 and a 4.5 overall. Love the spicy and citric qualities in this beer.

Cascade is a guarantee, maybe some centennial going on too, but just a guess. pretty bitter over all and leaves a clean finish, the mouthfeel is full but clean.

140,30420,jazzyjeff13,4.2,"A 350ml bottle with a BB of Sept 2012. Purchased recently at Waitrose - a new addition to their beer line-up.  Poured into a Duvel chalice. A hazy orange-amber colour with medium carbonation. Yields a large head of white foam that lasts for a few minutes before subsiding to a surface layer. An intense hoppy aroma with notes of grapefruit, citrus and pine, accompanied by a background whiff of alcohol.  Tastes intensely hoppy with a overpowering bitter finish. Notes of tropical fruits, citrus and pine underpinned by a barely discernible malt backbone. A flavour like refreshers (a fizzy sherbert sweet from the UK), and a hint of booze upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, prickly and spicy - a very astringent brew that dries the palate. Very bitter aromatic hop aftertaste.  Intense - this one knocks you for six. I've tried it before on tap, but it's more bitter than I remember - powerful stuff. Tons of aroma and flavour, but the bitterness is almost too much and drowns out some of the other flavour components. Nonetheless, I like my hops so it gets a thumbs up from me.

T: Sharp, resinous pine; thick, sweet caramel malt; growing bitterness that lingers.  M: Medium body, medium carbonation; creamy, with slightly dry finish.

140,30420,Royalenfield1990,3.63,"Poured from a bottle to a glass.  A- It's a nice golden-coppery color and a good thick cream-colored head. Leaves a fair amount of lacing.  S- These American Cone Hops give a pleasant scent of herbs, citrus and pine.  T- Very bitter like a double IPA should be, a nice piney and citrusy and dry aftertaste. Not bad.  M- Medium carbonation, kind of light for its kind  O- This was a decent brew. I can see myself buying another sixer again sometime.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Hophead717,4.12,"A 12 ounce bottle, poured into a DFH Signature Glass.  A: The beer pours a dark golden brown, with a one finger head. The head dissipates in time, leaving a strong amount of lacing.  S: Nice hop scents. A lot of pine, with hints of citrus and spice. No maltiness coming through in the nose.  T: Bitterness up front from the hops; notes of piney resin. Nice sweetness on the back-somewhat fleeting and with similarities to the citrus hops. Good balance between citrus and piney hops. No alcohol to mention on the back, but the beer has a pleasant, light bitter finish.  M: A lot of carbonation, somewhat creamy on the back.  O: A good beer. I love (!) it on tap; out of the bottle was good, but not great. I definitely will get it again and I recommend Torpedo!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Cadebro,4.09,"A - Pours a clear golden copper color with two fingers of yellowish white head which is quite foamy and leaves a good lacing behind.  S - Smells strongly of pine with a hint of citrus and caramel. I caught just a whiff of skunk.  T - Piney with a hint of citrus and caramel again. The nice hoppy bitter at the end covers up the average grain bill.  M - A nice medium body, but perhaps a bit light for an extra IPA. There is medium carbonation as well.  O - I enjoy this IPA. It is hopped well and contains a few nuanced flavors. It's a bit light bodied and clear for double IPA though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BeerdedEric,4,"Light golden straw color with a frothy white head that fades into a film. Decent amount of carbonation. Some lacing sticks to the glass.  Floral, pine, citrus and a peppery zing that sneaks in. It's quite potent as I smelled it about a foot away.  A bready doughi-ness in the beginning, pine and citrus fruit in the middle. As with the aroma, a peppery taste is evident towards the end mixing with dry bitter after taste.  Light body, medium to high carbonation, it leaves the mouth feeling dry, very easy going down.  This is a easy drinking IPA. This is a all around nice brew and should be enjoyed by hopheads.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,MacQ32,4,"A - Pours a very clear copper orange color with a solid finger off near white head, good retention, nice lacing. Really clean looking  S - Mostly citrus hops, some floral aromas as well. Plenty of grapefruit and a little caramel.  T - Bitter and citrusy up front, slightly dry at the finish. Simple but a great combination of citrus and bitter. A little bready at the dry finish as well..  M - Lighter bodied, pretty carbonated appropriate for the brew. Pretty drinkable, very refreshing.  O - Solid all around, a good affordable go to if you want something bitter/citrusy and very refreshing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,NuclearDolphin,4.27,"Poured into a 12oz Tumbler  Appearance - Pours a mildly hazy orange/amber color with a 2 finger head. Leaves behind some mild yet surprisingly sticky lacing.  Smell - Very potent citrus smell with some fairly strong floral hops. There's also a faint grapefruit taste mixed in with some caramel.  Taste - While there was a stronger citrus smell, the piney hops are easily the strongest (but not overwhelming) when it comes to the actual taste. I'm also picking up that citrus/orange flavor as well as some minor caramel flavors.  Mouthfeel - It's actually a pretty smooth IPA with some very mild carbonation. Much like Cream City IPA, this one is pretty easy to drink and it feels fresh.  Overall - This is an awesome IPA and the quality of this beer is exactly what I would expect out of Sierra Nevada. Even though Sierra Nevada is one of the bigger craft brewers in America, they do not skip out on quality at all, something which I commend them for.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,bennetj17,3.95,"Bottled 21 days ago. Clear, copper colored, with medium foam and subtle carbonation. Hoppy aroma with pine and fruit character, not so much on the citrusy side though. Very clean and overall reminds me of many of Sierra Nevada's IPA's.  Sharp bitterness jumps out instantly, paired with a nice dose of caramel malt. These clean, pine laced hops are almost medicinal, and I believe I'm overdue for my medication. It's a good thing there is some decent balance from the malts, because this thing is a bitter monster and lingers heavily on the tongue. The body actually comes up a bit soft, but perhaps it seems that way due to the carbonation being so fine.  A solid IPA that you can find available anywhere, and it offers a bit of a different flavor profile than many other West Coast IPA's in my opinion. It's classic Sierra Nevada style, and it's good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Pintofbrown,3.91,"Torpedo was poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance- A large and in charge cap on this one! Off-white that looks like it has yellow stains. A great two and a half finger affair that has great retention. The sheet of bubbly lace just absolutely holds on for dear life to the side of the glass.  The body is reminiscent of an apple cider with dark brown highlights.  Smell- There is a little bit of pine and some floral hop scents. Maybe some citrus here, but it is almost inferred. The beer also has a quality biscuit malt smell to it. The slightly lower score is due to the fact that it took a lot of effort to ""smell"" anything on this nose.  Taste- The hops used to bitter the drink are the most prominent throughout and last very long into the finish. Pine resin follows up on strength of tastes. This also becomes easy to pick out in the finish.  The malt backbone shows up and does a nice job of sweetening up the drink. I was also glad to find some herbal/floral hop notes in there as well. It keeps the experience interesting.  Mouth feel- Sierra Nevada handled the mouth feel on this one really well. It has a solid medium body and is quite creamy. A dry finish still manages to come through thanks to those bittering hops.  Overall- A very solid IPA. It uses the sweet malt well alongside the hop profiles. Speaking of the hop profiles, in order to really hit it out of the ballpark, they need to make them flavorful! It would suit this IPA well to really have the hop flavors distinguish themselves from the malt backbone.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,haz77,4.08,"A - Pours a clear light copper with and in of firm white head. This reduces slightly, but a firm half-inch cap sits resolute. Minimal carbonation visible.  S - Resinous/citric/herbal hops, molasses, hint of banana skin, fig, melon.  T - Citric hops build towards the middle of the drink, along with some light fruit. Dark fruit and molasses move in at the end. The long finish is all caramel and resinous/herbal drying hops. Nice.  M - Very good. Medium carbonation gives way to a quite syrupy, full body. Some carbonation remains to ensure the palate is cleansed.  D - Doesn't disappoint in any area. Not hugely complex, but plenty of interest and a good all rounder.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,madeofsteel,4.5,"A - Poured into a pint glass, has a nice darker orange color. The initial head is about a finger high, which stuck around for about a minute. Very nice lacing, clings to the glass!  S - A very lovely citrus aroma with plenty of piney hops. Not much else going on, but it smells gorgeous nonetheless.  T - Tastes just about how it smells. Very hoppy, with nice citrus details. It has that recognizable Sierra Nevada taste, but with more hops, which I am all for.  M - Very, very drinkable. Smooth on the palate, with a dry finish that hangs around for a bit.  O - This is simply a wonderful IPA which I can see myself coming back to again and again. Definitely a must-have! Just beware of the 7.2% ABV ;)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Hopfenpeter,4.2,"The beer poured a nice clear medium to dark gold, with a bubbly tan head building about one finger high. It dissipates fast leaving nice lacing. Smelling the beer, I detect a beautiful composition of citrus, pine hops, as well as some malt. Just like the smell, when I walked into the deep beerkellers back home in Germany! The taste is just like the nose. Nice citrus hops up front, a nice balance of malt in the middle and some more pine flavors and a more bitter hop finish. Great beer!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,KELPAK,4.15,Loved this beer. Poured a nice golden color with quarter inch head to it.  The taste was nice and smooth with a fantastic floral finish to it.

140,30420,TheAlamoWrocker,3.81,"Reviewed November 2nd, 2011. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a JFF is my BFF novelty Pint glass.  A: Poured a nice creamy one fingered head. The body of this drink is a beautiful Tawny while a slight carbonation rises to the top. This is definitely the way I''m used to seeing a IPA.  S: Hops dominant this drink with a citrus coming to the nose.  T: Hops are what hits the mouth mostly and a twang of citrus comes at the end of this drink and is also this drinks aftertaste. As this drink becomes more closer to room temperature then the pine really comes out and damn does it bite.  M: The textrure of this drink is confusing it feels smooth, but almost oily and creamy at the same time. The carbonation is also medium.  O: This beer is best after it warms up a bit. I was actually really surprised by the quality of this IPA since I'm able to buy this at local grocery stores. Sierra Nevada did not disappoint here at all.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Shiredave,3.61,"A bright clear deep yellow beer with streams of carbonation and a dense clotted head.  Aromas of citrus and hop acids flood the nose but not in a POW! in your face way of many (well) dry hopped IPA's. As it warms some light malt sweetness came forward but for the most part this is a ""lite"" IPA in terms of mouth feel and balance. Hop bittering dominates - and not in the best way - almost makes me wonder if whole cones were really used as advertised and not pellets - it tastes like over boiled generic high alpha pellets to me. No distinctive flavors or intensity in terms of hop or malt. This may have been a tired bottle but it should have been fresh this time of year. I didnt check for a date on 6 pack - none on bottle.  Over all I enjoy this more on tap - less carbonated and harshly bitter on the finish for me. Not a bad IPA but not great and not nearly as good in any way as Celebration Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TheMultiYeast,4.1,"Pours a slightly hazy yellow/orange with a fluffy white head.  Smells like dank full cone hops with lots of pine. Subdued citrus in the background. Resinous pine is just goin strong, some mint. Really fresh scent.  Taste is full of hop flavor and then bitterness. Really nice balance with malty sweetness. Fresh pine and grapefruit lead into a moderate bitterness. A little sweetness and lingering grassy flavors in the aftertaste.  Feel is a bit sticky, semi-dry finish  Everything an IPA should be.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jimithebeerguy,4.79,"Sierra Nevada's Torpedo is simply an amazing beer. This IPA pushes completely the boundary of what ""hop-i-ness"" is all about while sustaining a very unique pine-cone-like taste.

S-mostly pine with a bit of citrus  T-very piney and maybe some sweet grass. I'm not picking up much citrus the label mentions. Pretty hoppy with a bit of a malt backbone, but definitely not balanced.  M-very easy drinking, almost goes down too easily for what is nearly a double IPA.

140,30420,Klym,4.08,"Poured into a stone nonic.  Feel like i'm always dragging nets along craft obscurity so I decided to give a try to some sierra nevada i've never had. Felt in the mood for an IPA so this seemed appropriate.  Huge hops burst through the nose with dry grasses and some dank and resin. The head retention is awesome and lacing is splatter. The taste was a little bit cloyingly sweet at time when I first sipped; i honestly even thought about drain pouring. As I drink more though the unique flavor has come to grow on me with its mysterious spicyness and still major hop character. Sweetness is hard to understand and describe, a very unique IPA. Worth trying, and I imagine for most this will be a love-it-or-hate-it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,tjkinate,4.05,"Poured into a a standard pint glass which produced a 1+ fingered, bright white, soapy head with solid retention. Unfortunately, no lacing from this transparent, pale orange brew. I smelled lots of pine mixed with the more subtle floral scents. Malts were also present. I could taste the hops, but they weren't as strong as I had hoped, malts were stronger than most of the variety. Medium bodied brew that felt soft and silky.  Overall, a very good brew!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JohnnyChicago,4.1,"Poured from a 25oz bottle into a shaker pint.  A: Pours sticky amber with a cap of white head.  S: Smells surprisingly sweet, with a marshmallow sugar element. Hops are all pine and resin with a dash of lemon.  T: Sticky, evergreen tree hops are prominent. Sweetness carries over and the balance is pretty nice.  D: Easy drinking stuff! Its a bit more balanced than I'm used to in West Coast IPAs, but that makes it all the more quaffable.  Overall: Not a bad brew at all, and I wouldn't mind having this as a staple in the fridge. That being said, it didn't exactly ""wow"" me, but that's just fine. No-frills IPA done right.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A - Pours a nice copper colour with an orange hue, slightly hazy, two solid fingers of soapy head with solid retention (reminiscent of a Belgian brew) and some nice chunky lacing.  S - Cedar and pine notes dominate with a touch of musty caramel and citrus on the finish.  T - The flavour is fantastic, the cedar and pine hops come off surprisingly sweet and mask the bitterness. The bready caramel comes through on the finish and lingers alongside a touch of citrus.  M - Medium bodied, incredibly smooth and finishes nice and wet. Talk about an easy drinking IPA.  O - This stuff goes down like water, but boasts a solid flavour profile to keep your tastebuds wanting more. Hats off to joe for sending this one my way.

Grapefruits and pine needles mixed ever so perfectly. Quintessentially west coast.  Taste - Again, a quintessential IPA from the west coast. Big juicy grapefruits, lemon zest, great bread quality and underlying toffee characteristics in the background  Mouthfeel - Perfectly carbonated, bubbly and slightly chewy  Overall - IPAs fresh are one of my favorite styles. I have had this beer not so fresh and it was terrible, if it is fresh it is gorgeous. Make sure you check your labels or if you find it in a place that you think has been sitting around for awhile dont bother!

140,30420,UnderPressure,4.05,"Yellow-orange color. White one-finger head. Half finger lingers. It's got that foamy lacing that I like to look at.  Strong American hop aroma. Not sure whether it would be described as ""citrus"" or ""floral"".  Tart bitterness. Hops in aftertaste are the same as the aroma. Bitterness lingers in mouth. The flavor is good, but lacks any kind of complexity.  Light to medium bodied mouthfeel. The carbonation coupled with the strong bitterness feels pretty harsh on the tongue.

T: bitter, a bit of pine resin, very heavy on the hop side, ends with a mild caramel malt flavor/sweetness which mellow out the bitterness  M: bitterness and spiciness linger, the beer is very smooth on the palate  O: a great brew, I wish I could get this on tap here in Houston.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,imasloth,4.42,"When people are selling Sierra Nevada sixers for $6.29 you don't pass them up. I chose the Torpedo because I'd had it in singles and liked it.  A- Poured into a pint glass it gives a nice pastel yellow head about a finger's width that withstands the elements for some time. The beer itself is filled with rapidly rising tiny bubbles and is a transparent copper color.  S- It's all hops, and quite citrusy at that- more specifically I'd say it smelled like ruby red grapefruit juice with a certain sweetness.  T- One again it's all hop with a good mix of bittering and taste. The grapefruit taste remains, but an added piney bitterness comes through that I quite enjoy.  M- For as bitter as it is, the mouthfeel is tremendous. There is no wincing of the jaw muscles, the body is light and smooth, and the feeling after swallowing is minimal, leaving you ready for another swallow.  O- This summer I have had two IPAs that have really stuck with me: Real Ale Lost Gold and this one. The Lost Gold is more delicate/nuanced with its hops and perhaps a bit more complex. This Torpedo is just as strong, but with the bitter component that is lacking in Lost Gold.  I really do enjoy, and could see myself having several in a row, which is saying something for a beer as hoppy as this one.

T: Pine way out in front with citrus present, but not as much in the nose. There's a big tea quality to this that I like a lot. There's some bread and sugar like tastes that balance things out a bit, but this still a pretty big hop bomb.  M: Full and creamy. Finishes dry.

It is not the best IPA I have had, but very close. It has a lot of hops and a nice malt finish.  The mouthfeel is the part of the beer that isnt amazing.

Lurking in the back are some sugary caramel notes and I swear I'm smelling weed with this. The good kind.

D: Loaded with hop flavor at lower than expected bitterness levels make this one an easy drinking IPA. There are many IPA's out there that will crush your palate but not Torpedo. Nicely balanced and lots of frsh aroma/flavoring hops.  A definite staple in my beerfridge and one beer I would have to say I take for granted.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Dave128,4.03,"Poured from a dark green 12 oz bottle into Duvel tulip.  A - A pretty rigorous pour yields a 2 finger head that has some surprising lasting power. Beautiful semicloudy amber in color. Lacing is pretty nice as well for this one.  S - American hops! Smells mostly piney. I was expecting this one to be super cascady like a super version of SNPA, but still smells great nonetheless.  T - Alcohol is hidden fairly well. I didn't realize this was a 7.2% abv until I started feeling the buzz off of one bottle. I can tell this beer is generously hopped. There is not much flavor on the malt side of things, which seems to be my opinion of SN's other hoppy varieties, but it's sweet enough to provide a good base for the hop blast that follows. As this beer warms its getting so much better. The citrus is starting to pull through on the hops and the bitterness is not as crushing.  M - Medium bodied. A little overcarbonated to start with in my opinion, but it mellows out nicely after the beer sits for about 15 to 20 minutes.  O - A great tasting dynamic IPA. I was about to give this one mediocre reviews until it warmed up then it became a completely different beer. SN always provides great results!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Has a bit of caramel in the background  Taste: Taste is very malt heavy and not much hops in sight and for 102 ibu's there is no bitterness in sight. Really lacking flavor maybe my bottle is old?  Mouthfeel: Medium body and high carbonation lots of carbonation sting on the roof of the mouth  Overall: Not my favorite IPA to me the beer is lacking balance and flavor,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Appearance: Pours a golden caramel with a 1-2 finger eggshell white head. Excellent head retention and perfect lacing.  Smell: Grassy and piney hops with a touch of citrus and malt. Smells like a beefed up version of SNPA.  Taste: Bitter citrus up front followed by sweet citrus and a touch of apricot in the middle before ending with pine and lemon zest at the finish. Aftertaste is bitter.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. Goes down very smooth. You could drink several without much difficulty.

140,30420,fmccormi,4.4,"Straight pour from a 12oz pry-off bottle to a Bruery tulip; bottling date of July 29, 2011 (121021728), I believe, printed on the side of the label  Appearance (4.0): A thick, two-finger off-white head fading to a thick ring around the edge of the beer, leaving some very nice lacing on the sides. The body is a nice, medium reddish-amber, not quite clear but not close to “hazy,” either.  Smell (4.0): Citrus—pink grapefruit and something a little sweeter—with a bit of conifer forest in the background. Yes, conifer forest. If there are malts in there, they’re nice and subdued.  Taste (4.5): Following the nose, the first thing to come up is tart citrus, just a little fruity, but that piney bitterness comes in quickly to dominate the hop profile. The malts are nice, smooth and balanced, but rightly stay in the background—the mildly sweet breadiness just anchors the hops, letting them flourish and whatever. Works for me. And, true to the neutral reputation of Chico yeast, there’s no discernible yeast flavor in here.  Mouthfeel (5.0): Excellent! Just enough body, good mix of lively and smooth carbonation, and slightly viscous but with a dry finish. Really great.  Overall (4.5): This is a damn good IPA, by any standards. If you’re looking at the bottling date of the beer I drank and asking why I waited so long, I had some from this sixer a couple weeks ago and it was suitably more bitter / fresher than it is now, so I’m neither detracting points unfairly, nor delusional in giving it a good score. Just, y’know. For the record. And I want to see “conifer forest,” or even better, “secondary succession coniferous forest,” on more reviews.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,idurra,3.92,"The beer pours a clear reddish copper color, with an thick, creamy off white head that dissipates slowly. Smells of the typical citrus and hops of IPAs, but the citrus is peculiarly grapefruit like. The first sip had very pleasant floral and herbaceous quality, grapefruit again, but no bitterness. Second sip, I noticed pine resins, still very pleasant. Subsequently, hops bitterness becomes more evident, with a dryness and tannic feel on the tongue that is less pleasant.

Some grapefruit, piney.  T: Really nice. Hop kicks your palate the whole way through. Some grapefruit rind upfront followed by that pine I smelled. Maybe a little bit of malt trying to sneak through near the front but this is definitely got hops if you are looking for them. Finish lingers on the back of your tongue but not too long, invites you to take another sip right away.  M: Crisp, refreshing. A nice carbonation prick on your tongue.

140,30420,IPhantom,4.28,"Gorgeous amber-red color poured into my bellowed pint glass, with an enticing ""drink-me"" head that dissipates quickly (lacing sticks around, though). Smells like a really healthy breakfast...grapefruit and a toasted english muffin. Taste is exceedingly well-balanced. Hoppy enough for a hop fan, with enough backbone to be introduced to a casual beer drinker. Outstandingly (to my mind) light and crisp mouthfeel, very drinkable on account of the balance, but still sharp and piney on the back.  Very good stuff, I might have to Pepsi Challenge it with the base Sierra PA, but right now I don't think I would go back.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BrewtifulMind,4.42,"On-cask at Rock & Brew, El Segundo  Here goes my introduction to the world of cask-conditioned beer. I've been looking forward to trying something on cask for a while now. This pours a gorgeous honey/amber color with a very bubbly half-inch head which dissipates quickly, leaving minimal traces of lacing behind. First thing I noticed was the overpowering aroma of dank, resinous hops. There was also a nice floral and citrus scent in there as well. This thing is a hop bomb. Pungent hop taste, leaving a peach aftertaste in my mouth. Definitely much better than the bottled version. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but a little under-carbonated, which I expected from the cask. The only thing that could have made this better, is if it was just a little bit colder(another thing I expected from a cask, warmer temps.) Overall, I would say this is one of the best brews I have had. Feels like a totally different beer. Cheers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Some film on the sides after initial pour, and lasted on the sides after. Looked good.  Smelled of a balance of citrus hops, pine/spruce hops and caramel malts. Also a sharp, bitter alcohol smell at the end. Good mix.  Initial taste was slight caramel, followed by an astringent pine flavor. Some citrus in there, too. Bitter aftertaste.  Medium body. Average carbonation. Still good flavor all the way down.  I’ve had this before, but this was my first time reviewing it.

Creamy head and sticky lace are fantastic.  S - pine like hop aroma. Grapefruit is dominate and tops off the citrusy smells of lemon and other citrus notes. A hint of grassy hops with a touch of pepper as the whiff continues.  T - fruity and citrusy notes of grapefruit, crisp apples, and a little bit of lemon. Lovely pine notes up front and linger around the rest of the way. This ipa is very well balanced in taste and full of different flavors. A hint of pepper or maybe even some sort of spice in the background of this brew. The hoppy flavors are there from the start and continue quite nicely to the finish when a perfect touch of bitterness creeps in.  M - upper medium to full body. Very well carbonated and drinkable even at 7.2%. this beer was pleasantly smooth, crisp, and clean in the mouth.  O - Sierra Nevada are very underrated in this day and age, and I'm not sure why. They should be a lot higher in the top 100 rankings ive seen. This brewery just keeps pumping out quality and class in a variety of styles. This is one of the best Am IPAs I've ever had anywhere.

Excellent retention, the head never fully recedes. Excellent lacing, as well, as the foam will not leave the side of the glass, all the way to the end.  S: Smells strongly of piney hops. Smells very hoppy, but not as sweet as many stronger IPAs, which is a big plus to me. Has the bitter with a bit of sweet aroma. A bit of citrus, but mostly a very piney aroma.  T: The taste is what sets this beer apart. It's a hoppy IPA, so the first taste is obviously the hops. They're not quite as piney as their smell, but pine is certainly the first taste I recognize. The hops smooth out very quickly, however, which was a big surprise to me. After the initial flavor, everything smooths out. There is really not much in the way of malt flavor, but then again, I doubt anyone bought this beer with any expectation of such. The final taste left is a nice, bitter hop note. No specific pine/citrus flavor, but a definite hoppiness. Never found the flavor to be overly sweet, as I tend to find many stronger IPAs.  M: Great. Feels very carbonated when it hits the tongue, but reveals itself to be far less bubbly. Smooth and sweet on the tongue. Does not make me recoil from bitterness, but leaves me wanting to re-up the flavor after just a minute or two.  O: A very nice stronger IPA. This is not a hop-bomb of some 10% IIPA, but it is certainly more agressive than the regular SNPA. Overall, this is a good beer for those who love hops or for those who don't like hops but feel like the occasional hoppy beverage.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Slightly creamy malt core is overtaken by a wave of sharp, clean grapefruit hops dries down clean, if resinous- with only the hops lingering 10 seconds or so. Good amount of booze warmth too.  Mouthfeel is fairly oily, coating of the palate, with a hint of effervescence, but really only there for the slightest support.

140,30420,mayorwalda,4.23,"My second review of one of Sierra Nevada's brews, I’m expecting good things.  Sierra Nevada's Torpedo Extra IPA pours a really nice golden amber color and the head forms just like I expected from an IPA. The bouquet is pretty strong, giving off all of the piney, floral, (slight) citrus notes I was looking for. The head dies off into a rim of bubbles and leaves very sporadic lacing around the edge of the glass. Carbonation bubbles are almost nil, so I can see this sweetening up as I let it sit for a bit, which is something I've come to enjoy in Pale Ales.  Looking down into the amber depths of my glass I take my first sip and lo and behold! I got exactly what I paid for! Torpedo, in taste, is a notably floral IPA (though this taste could mostly be the herbs they apparently use as well) that allows you to focus on the bitter notes before you’re brought the delicate sweet taste of very light caramel malts.  As far as mouthfeel is concerned, well, Sierra Nevada has created the very typical IPA in that sense. You’ve got a crisp taste which is complimented by a clear, crisp beer that doesn’t give you too much bite from carbonation or (any from) alcohol.  What I like about this beer the most, besides it being a good example of a drinkable IPA, is that it isn’t too carbonated and as I had hoped, this minimal carbonation allows you to really taste the malt sweetness—something I’ve only recently become attuned to.  The skinny of it goes like this:  A: Really, really nice amber, golden color with a good finger-and-a-half head that leaves almost no lace. S: Smell is great, smells like hopps and some faint grassy aromas. T: You’ve got a typical IPA with a neat flourish. The subtle, sweet malty note makes this brew stand out a bit and makes it a pleasure to drink! M: Mouthfeel’s good, lightly carbonated, crisp, clear, could drink these a while without becoming overwhelmed. O: Sierra Nevada has kept their own pace making a somewhat less distinct beer with maximum drinkability, and I really think that’s the point.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,flyingpig,4.06,"Reddish orange to amber. Solid, foamy & slightly off-white coloured head with good retention & lacing.  Massive hops presence straight away which is closely paired with a fair amount of pine, making for a good match. There is some bitter on the nose & a nice herbal citrus aroma as well as hints of mango.  An initial hop flavour that is very in your face & mirroring the nose is quickly followed by a sort of pine like taste. The finish is a little to bitter for my liking. Rounded off with a nice herbal spiciness.  Medium bodied with a smooth feel to begin that is slightly sticky in the finish, and has a nice dryness to it. Bitter aftertaste.  Pretty well balanced & as expected has a huge hops flavour & as a result a rather bitter finish which I think I may have enjoyed more had it been more understated. Still a very good beer.

Left spots of lace all the way down the glass, gorgeous!  Smell - 3.0 Attractive hop driven aroma is noticeably less pungent than in the best IPAs, which suggest to me that it is not at its freshest. Lots of orange marmalade with trace aromas of pine needle and dried herbs.  Taste - 4.5 Intensely bitter, which of course, is what is expected from the style, but still came as a bit of a surprise. Dry, cracker-like malt backbone, a dab of caramel and big herbal, citric and piney hop flavours. Finishes very dry with a long lingering bitterness. Would be brilliant with spicy chicken wings.  Mouthfeel - 4.0 Light to medium bodied and with fine, prickly carbonation.  Overall - 4.0 At 7.2%, Torpedo is on the upper-end of the IPA scale, a little stronger and it would be a DIPA.

Sticky and lacing.  S- Big piney bitter hop notes. Not particularly balanced (neither is the taste, in my opinion), but when I want a big piney IPA, Torpedo is the way I go.  T- Big pine hops up front. Some citrus, slight grapefruit notes after that. Lingering bitterness. A very bitter 'west coast' west coast IPA.  M- Heavy side of medium. Carbonation is excellent. SN nailed this aspect of brewing years ago, and consistently nail it over and over.  O- I like Torpedo for what it is. It is a very good, albeit not great west coast IPA.

Big four finger white head with good retention and lots of lacing sticking to the glass.  Smell: Lively burst of citrus and piney hops with hints of grapefruit, orange, mango, lemon, and herbs. Also has a strong presence of bready malts with caramel and toffee. Smells hoppy but very balanced.  Taste: Big taste of citrus and herbal pine hops that is fairly bitter but also pretty fruity and sweet. Bitterness is combined with grapefruit, mango , pine, orange, and herbs with hints of lemon and honey. Has a very full backing of bready malts with caramel and toffee. A very full and balanced flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Very smooth and creamy.  Overall: A very solid west coast IPA that has great balance between bitter and sweet. Very good use of hops and malts.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,paperbackfoster,3.46,"A - A deep amber, somewhere between saffron and chestnut colored. The head comes up to two fingers, cascading down the glass back to one. Body carbonation seems slow and light, barely perceptible in the haze.  S - A minty, evergreen hop scent over lightly nutty malts with a hint of spice.  T - Dark, bready and almost nutty notes carry the hops in. Hops are woody, spiced with what seems like winter spices. Strong, earthy tones are also present. No single hop or hop addition can be detected on its own, which is both a positive and negative in my mind. Still, a very balanced beer, on the lighter side of a double IPA.  M - A big beer feel for somewhat small beer taste. Round, tart and tangy.  O - A rare outing of what seems to be a session double IPA. Relatively low ABV and a weaker flavor make this a big beer to enjoy in a sixer or the bar. That said, it’s not for the hophead at all - most hop characteristics do seem muted in the balance.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,stjaernstoft,4.05,"Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA, ABV: 7.2%. 350 ml bottle, 26.90 SEK at Systembolaget.  A: A slightly hazy, amber-coloured liquid with a big, white, soapy head - good retention.  S: Big aroma of fruity American hops, with notes of apricots, oranges, citrus peels, marmalade balls, toffee, rye bread, herbs, and pine trees. Mm.  T: Rich flavours of fruity and bitter hops, citrus peels, oranges, apricots, green grapes, jam, caramel, rye bread, herbs and pine trees. This is candy for adults.  M: A large body, large bitterness and a small, but notable sweetness. The carbonation is moderate and the liquid is soft on the tongue. Long bitterness.  O: I find the 'Torpedo' to be a rich and relatively balanced IPA - a sturdy beer, without doubt - perhaps it's something for an elegant and well-made Sunday Roast.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Ninjabrew,3.78,"Nice well balanced (for a west coast) IPA. Hop bitterness is present it is easy to identify as an IPA, but the balance is there as well. I also appreciate the malt being there without it being to sweet. I like this beer because the balance between sweet and bitter is good as is the balance of hops and malt.

T- The flavor is dominated by a pine taste, barely any citrus noticed, and has a stickyness to it.  M- This beer has a sticky mouthfeel, coats and leaves a piney after taste.

140,30420,bastu,4,"The code on the label starts ""1171"", so this beer was bottled on June 20th, 2011.  Looks like a middle of the road IPA in terms of color. Nice 2 finger head, with sparse bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass.  Smells great! Lots of citrusy hop aromas with just a touch of pine and malt coming through.  Tastes pretty much like it smells plus a nice hit of grapefruit bitterness and a semi dry finish. There are some malts in the mix, but the hops take center stage.  Mouthfeel is medium, and the carbonation is good.  I keep going back to the Torpedo for several reasons; it's always available, the price is right, this beer seems to maintain the hoppy flavors that I want for longer than some of the other IPAs out there, and I am never left wondering about the age of the beer that I have just bought.

A 1/2 inch tan head that fades at a slow pace. Good.  S: Smells of honey malts upfront quickly followed by a blended hop citrus. Some mild iced tea scent on the backend. Good.  T: A mild watery clean malt upfront quickly followed by a slow ramping hop bite. It starts out not very bitter, and ends up more bitter as it sits on your taste buds. It ends with a nice hop bitterness that is citrusy with a mild pepper. Decent.  M: Medium body with a hard carbonation. A bitter dry finish.  O: All in all, this is a good beer. I like it, for the fact that it blends malt and hop well. It's not overly hoppy, but you shouldn't expect that from an American IPA.

M: Fairly smooth, about average carbonation for a beer like this, kind of thick also  Overall this is a good IPA.

Taste: Hops, and plenty of it. Plenty of the the light bitterness you would expect from an IPA. Flavor lingers for a good amount of time.  Mouthfeel: Very good for the style, medium bodied, medium amount of carbonation. Very good for an IPA.  Overall: A classic IPA , tastes the way it should, and won't disappoint you if you like IPAs. Definitely worth the money, but I wouldn't say that this is anything that is really going out of your way to find, not that you should really have to, as it is a pretty common beer to find.

140,30420,MaxSpang,3.6,"Served in a snifter...  A - Hazy reddish/orange. The off white head dissipates quickly, and it has moderate lacing (for the small head that remains) throughout the session. The head becomes a mere sliver halfway through.  S - At first, there's a good amount of hops. Not overwhelming, but not quite underwhelming. Not the hoppiest smelling IPAs I have tasted. The hop character is more piny than citrusy, but it has elements of both. After my nose hits the ""blind spot"" - I smell a fair amount of grain and a good amount of sweetness. Some bread notes in the nose as well.  T - A tasty beverage! A nice amount of bitterness as you take a sip, but not over-the-top. A delicate sweetness backs it up. There are some good ol' American hops on the tongue, but more so in bitterness than in flavor. There is a bit of the piny character, and not much citrus to speak of. There's also a graininess that reminds me of bread and biscuit which mellows out while it warms. The bitterness shines after about 20 minutes out of the fridge.  M - A little on the dry side, but still very satisfying. Drinkability is moderate to high. It's a beer that you could easily sip while sitting on the computer (writing a review, perhaps? That's what I'm doing!), but it's also pretty quenching and goes down easily.  Overall - A solid IPA! Not my favorite, but this beer is pretty easy to come by so it's a great beer to grab at a place that is moderately stocked with craft beer. Or if you see it on the menu of a restaurant that serves OK beer - grab it and enjoy!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Bonis,3.83,"Review from notes: 8/3/11  A - Clear amber in color with a thick creamy off white head. Lace clings very nicely, good retention.  S - Very hoppy, piney and herbal. Hints of lemon dish soap make it into my nostrils (and no, there were no suds in my glass). A touch of caramel malt. Smells SN to me.  T - Taste follows the smell, minus the dish soap, which is good. A hop forward, very bitter tasting beer. Not great balance, but there is some nice initial maltiness that blends well with fruity citrus and piney resinous hops. Beyond that, I don't get much else (including no alcohol, good). Not the greatest IPA, but definitely a good tasting beer!  M - Medium body and carbonation. Lots of hop resin coats the mouth with each drink. Very bitter and lingering on the finish.  O - A pretty good IPA, but I'm obviously not a big fan of it like most other people. Glad I tried a sixer of it, and I'm sure I'll have it again here in a couple years. I guess that's the way it has to be when I have access to IPAs like Columbus and Two Hearted at any time. I'd definitely prefer to drink SNPA or Celebration Ale if I had to pick Sierra Nevada beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The finish has just a tiny bit of sweet caramel covered fruits, and the aftertaste is bitter and lingering. M: Medium body, resin-esque mouthfeel is sticky and smooth, and the carbonation is tingly and tight.

There is that dominant citrus/pine smell one comes to expect from an IPA but there is so much more. Rich,complex and very pleasant.  T- A truly delicious taste dominated by an overwhelming presence of hops. This is not without intricacy though, as I can taste a good amount of malt flavours and some green apple sweetness. The alcohol content is completely and utterly masked at over 7% ABV. I am very impressed by this.  M- The excellent level of carbonation really adds to the robust character of this beer. The body has a nice, sticky but fairly easy texture which, again, augments this brew's character.  O- This is an exceptional beer. This drunk with all the flavour of a double IPA yet with the drinkability of a single without any compromise at all.

Sweetness of malts come through and makes the taste. Not as explosive as other IPA's, but I like the balance that's here.  M: Smooth medium mouthfeel. Feels just right.  O: Very drinkable IPA.

140,30420,BeefyMee,4.47,"Sierra's love letter to the hop. This is an awesomely jacked up IPA. Huge piney/sprucey hop notes accentuate the bold flavor profile. A sweet malt undercurrent gives this beer a solid backbone. At 7.2% the alcohol is barely noticeable, I would go so far as to say undetectable. One of the most drinkable hop monsters I've ever had. I'm glad they keep it in steady rotation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,magictacosinus,4.47,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle.  Appearance: Pours a nice, bold amber/reddish color that is quite similar to SN's pale ales. Maintains a thin head throughout.  Smell: A delicious floral and citrus aroma. SN is already a great brewery when it comes to hops, but they really it right home here. There are sweet scents of honey malts, as well as grapefruit and oranges.  Taste: The hops taste as strong as they smell, but are immediately relieved by the sweet, creamy-tasting malts. There are light grapefruit tones, but most notable are tastes of oranges, lemons, caramel, and hint of granny smith apples. It is a well-balanced taste, and a very simple IPA recipe that works well.  Mouthfeel: If anything, this is one of easiest best quality IPAs to drink that I've found yet. It's not nearly as bitter as other easy to find IPAs (such as Ranger, Racer 5, etc) yet contains a smooth, beautifully balanced feel. While hops are priority in this beer, the malts play 45-55% of drinking experience on the palate, and more considerably so as it warms up. In fact, this beer should be allowed to warm up - it becomes drier, more bitter, and definitely not as malty.  Overall: An excellent IPA, and one that I used always have well stocked around the house. These days, I lean more towards other California IPAs such as Racer 5 and Stone IPA, but this is ridiculously good beer to EVER pass by the chance to drink. Note: People at parties I've been to already love SN pale ales, but whenever I've had the change to bring these over, it appears to be a more well-received IPA - even amongst non-hopheads - due to the delicious maltiness that it holds.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Ar- It almost smells of gummy worms... There's this sweetness, a piney, scent, and the malts. Yes - piney, citrus aromas backed by some malt.  T- The flavor is so pleasant. It's a perfect balance of malt and piney, floral/citrus hops. In other words, it's 50% creamy/malty and 50% bitter. But the bitterness is actually really, really nice.

Overall, good, but comes off a little too citrus not enough bitter hops. Not as balanced as I'd like. Not as balanced as my favorite Southern Harvest IPA this IPA is just good.

140,30420,avaldivia,4.2,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Clear golden color. Nice off white head about an inch thick.  S: Grapefruit citrus dominates the nose. A bit of an malty note as well, but this one is all about the hop.  T: Awesome. The grapefruit flavor is again on the forefront. Fairly bitter, but more of a floral, citrus hop flavors. A bit of malt on the finish which keeps it from being a total mouth puckering IPA.  M: Medium to thick body. Good carbonation.  O: One of my personal favorite IPAS out there. I pick this up fairly often and have never been let down.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,vancurly,4.08,"Finally available to a wider market in Australia. Thanks SN.  Pours a spongy offwhite head, holding and persisting 1cm. Brilliant orange/amber with little bubbling.  Assertive perfume notes of citrus and caramel, maybe some grapefruit and pineapple, biscuit/bread.  A well rounded and persistent flavour. Citrus takes on a sherbet & pine resin note. The caramel hints at a touch of molasses. Firm bitterness rounds it off.  Probably one of the best mouthfeels I've had with a beer. Rich yet not heavy, persitent but not cloying. A touch of alcohol heat aligns with the bitters.  A balanced, flavoursome beer. One of my best for the year.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Dan3279,4.05,"I have been lucky enough have this beer a few times over the past week and this is review is more from my notes. Poured the 12oz bottle into a pint glass to find a amber colored body with a nice white head. The aroma was on the mellow side, but you do notice some malts and citrus hops. The taste was great, with pine hops, and some citrus notes and some sweetness. Overall a great balanced, great tasting IPA that I really enjoyed and I am glad that it is easy to find out at bars and in most stores.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BuxMontBeerLover,4.3,"Purchased for our rehearsal dinner get-together before our wedding. Cheers to my brother and Best Man, Brian & my buddy, Pat (my fellow beer lovers!)  Enjoyed in a standard pint glass.  A - Pours a rather clear, cooper-reddish color. A decent two finger head that fades to a white covering on top of the beer. Good lacing.  S - A classic IPA smell that leans towards a more hoppy smell than sweet.  T - A really great tasting IPA. All the flavors of a classic IPA with an emphasis on the hops. Personally, I love the bitter hoppiness so this beer was right up my alley. More bitter than sweet. The alcohol is well disguised but I can attest that these can sneak up on you. They are really easy to put back.  M - A thicker consistency that coats the mouth. Not highly carbonated.  O - A really great beer. I see this all the time in the store but since there are so many other beers to chose from, I've never picked this one up until now. Nice job SN! I will be purchasing again, without a doubt. Highly recommended.  Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: Bitter at first followed by malt and citrus, with a pine finish.  M: Thick viscosity with a high level of very fine carbonation.  O: A slow drinker that is thick and very strong in piney hops. The thing about this beer is that when rating it, each separate component is highly rated, but overall when put together it isn't as balanced as other IPAs I have had.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,tdm168,3.8,"On tap at Lynnwood Grill  Arrived a dark copper with a thin lacing of head. Smells piney and floral; really enticing for a hop head like me. Taste is piney up front with a more floral finish. The hops are intense and very bitter giving this beer a bite. There is only a very mild malt character that comes through. This beer is medium bodied with light carbonation.  Overall, I thought this beer was good, but comes off a little too hoppy and not as balanced as I'd like.

Taste: Much like it smells, Lots of Hops and some Malt on the taste, balanced fairly well. More Flavor and Aroma Hops, than Bittering Hops.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and Fresh, medium body. Good Carbonation level.  Drinkability: Nice Beer, very Drinkable if your a Hop Head you'll dig it. This is one of the better Strong IPA's I've had lately, if you're a Budlight or Coors drinker this Beer is gonna launch a Torpedo on your Tastebuds, but that's a good thing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,SkurvvyPirate,3.77,"Appearance - Pours a perfect copper color, about an inch of head. Surprisingly not much lacing.  Smell - Smells are very powerful. I could smell this beer all day. Lots of pine with some citrus in the background.  Taste - I was disappointing with the taste after the nose. It was pretty hoppy, but nothing exceptional. I got a lot of ""alchohol"" taste that overpowered other flavors.  Mouthfeel - Very good body, the carbonation was just the right amount. Good IPA mouthfeel.  Overall - I was a little let down by the taste of the beer. I had high expectations. IPAs are one of my favorite beers so I was excited to try this one. Hoping it was just an off batch. Other than that, everything else about the beer lined up to be something exceptional.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Forb,4.35,"Poured from a 12oz bottle...  Appearance: Deep, rich copper body with minimal head.  Smell: Spicy herbal hops with yeast overtones. Citrusy grapefruit and earthy pine elements.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Piney, citrusy hops adding to the resonate, oily nature of this medium to full body. Carbonation is solid with the flavors packing a punch right behind.  Overall: This is an excellent American IPA.

SN rarely disappoints and this is no exception.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Macca,3.41,"This pours a dark orange honey colour with a thick white heady. Cloudy. Lots of lacing.  Really surprised at the lack of aromas here. I was expecting to get whacked with the C's but even after letting it warm up I'm only getting some pepperiness and a little bit of pine resin.  Tropical fruit and pine resin on the palate. But not much else. The malt is there but overwhelmed by the hops. Aggressive, grippy bitterness.  Chewy mouthfeel.  Too big and aggressive for my tastes.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DavidST,4.25,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, unreadable bottle date.  Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a decent white foamy head which good retention. The smell is of hops and caramel malts. Feel is medium with good carbonation and I'm already hit with a jolt of the hops. Taste is initially of the hops, some grapefruit, citrus, and pine, on the way down there is a little bit of malty sweetness and then a long lingering hop bitterness finish (along with a hint of the alcohol).

140,30420,nicksta,4.31,"Horey shit. This is bonza! The color of the beer is a nice, slightly dark, brown and gold. It's clear, and the foam is thick and it sticks around a while with significant lacing. It smells very clean. Piney, with a nice roasted touch that's clean. There's also that hint of hops to come in the taste, which is excellent. There's a great caramel sweetness. It's quite sweet, but balanced by this great hop aftertaste. It's bitter and deliciously so, but not too strong. A hint of citrus (lime) is present as well. The mouthfeel is godly. It glides down the throat.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,peacebone116,4.19,"Enjoyed a pint of this beautiful beer on cask at Pizza Port, Carlsbad.  A: Honey with a creamy off-white tan head and a bit of vegetation floating in the middle of the beer as it ""cooked"" and settled. Appears decently carbonated (for a cask beer, that is), and the head remains through to the finish.  N: Immaculate floral bouquet of pineapple and grapefruit--very impressive and powerful!  T/M: Perfect creamy body and light mouth-feel. Citrus and herbal tastes that follow the nose, but slightly less intense. Herbal qualities are followed by a nice, light bready note, which is quickly absorbed by a pleasant piney bitterness.  Great beer on cask--still might benefit from being a bit more chilled (maybe just about 5-degrees or so), but nonetheless my favorite format of this beer so far!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CAMRAhardliner,4.65,"Pours a stunning glowing orange with plenty of fine carbonation streams. The sticky, clingy cappuccino colored head lasts forever. The aroma is of fruity, citrusy hops and doughy, sweet malts. Hops are very strong in this brew. It verges just this side of a hop tea thanks to the very substantial, chewy malt profile. Pine and citrus flavors abound and grow with intensity with warmth. The mouthfeel is creamy with carbonation and wonderfully numbing from the hop assault. Fantastic concrentrated grapefruit bitterness lingers forever making for a very enjoyable finish. Alcohol is subdued throughout.  This is a fantastic west coast IPA, brash hops, still some semblance of balance. Excellent stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Eramen,4.38,"A - Golden yellow and orange, sumptuous head with beautiful lacing.  S - Hops hit rather nicely, pine, green leafy-ness, melon and grapefruit.  T - Delicious malty, fruit flavours as mentioned in the smell, with a satisfying hopiness on the back palate accompanied by delicate floral notes.  MF - Light feel with a somewhat foamy texture.  O - This is a lovely American Ipa and is fairly representative of the current quality brews of this style being churned out in the last few years. This is a must try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,danieelol,3.68,A: Good red colour and lacing and decent head.  S: Far more subtle than expected. Have to work hard for the hops. Citrus and pine. Some herbal nutty notes. Bit of malt. Green apple.  T: Quite a few bittering hops.  M: Decently thick and bitter.  O: Interesting beer. Not what I was expecting. Very restrained hop flavours (at 3 months old).

140,30420,CraftBeerTastic,4.5,"Ba Review #11 Served On: 7/16/2011 Glassware: Pint  A little disclaimer here - Sierra Nevada Torpedo has always held a special place in my beer fridge, so this review may be somewhat biased.  Look: Poured a very smooth perfect clear copper. Nice fluffy 2 finger light-tan head. Had extremely high carbonation.  Smell: Clean hoppy spice notes with a pronounced maltiness. I notice the 7.2% ABV coming through in the nose, but in a good way.  Taste: I got the hop spice with some bitterness upfront. Middle of the palate was a juicy floral. Finish was a dry ginger spiciness combined with a hop bitterness that seemed to linger for a while.  This beer is certainly a top 3 IPA for me. I am lucky enough to have a distributor who carries it all the time. It is a very nice ‘general-purpose’ brew to have on hand at all times.  ___ Ba Review #11 1/2 Served On: 7/16/2011 Glassware: Tumbler  Wild Goose IPA (retired but reviewing anyway)  I ran into a 6 pack of this beer with a current best-by date on it. Beer Advocate won’t allow anymore reviews of this particular beer, but I’m reviewing it anyway. I decided to include it at the end of my Sierra Nevada Torpedo review because I personally consider both beers to share a similar character and rating.  Look: Poured a brownish orange with carbonation bubbles rising up the middle. Head was about 1-finger and dissipated to a thin film that covered the top.  Smell: A very malt forward aroma with biscuity notes. Dark fruits in the background. Maybe some spicy hops. The nose was well balanced.  Taste: At first there was a spicy hop bitterness - followed by heavy malt notes. The bitterness returned in the aftertaste with hints of citrus. The hop citrus lingered long after each sip.  I can't wait for Logan Shaw Brewing to get on their feet so we can start enjoying Wild Goose once again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DannyDan,4.04,"Pours out a golden copper with an off white head that has good carbonation, excellent retention and some really cool looking lacing on the side of my beer mug. The nose is loaded with hops and the taste starts out with some pine followed by citrus and finishes off with floral hops. Has a spiciness and some sweet malt in the back. The hops flavors, sweet malts and spices balance each other out very nicely. This beer is very smooth and creamy at first, but than finishes off quite dry with some chalkiness in the mouth. A very great beer that ranks high in my list of favorite IPA's. Sure glad Sierra Nevada made this an all-year round beer because this is the best beer I have tasted from these guys so far.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,fizzy,4.7,"Every time I turn around there's a new stupendous IPA hitting the market. This one, like many of the others I have tasted gets two BIG thumbs up.

It deserves a ""A"" and that is what it is getting.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Bockrules,4.43,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass  A - Pours a nice copper with a slight orangish hue that is slightly cloudy. Mild carbonation trickles in streams to a dense, off-white 1.5 finger head. Head stays intact all the way down the glass and leaves substantial lacing.  S - Not as big as I had hoped. Mostly herbal notes with a bit of pine.  T - A bit of pine flavors upfront lead to a very full and balanced body. Pine and herbal flavors from the American hops are brought to the forefront while sweet and biscuity malt flavors keep this ""Extra"" IPA from assaulting the taste buds. A rather biscuity instead of hoppy taste as the beer passes over the back of the tongue before leading to a pine aftertaste.  M - On the heavier side of medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very chewy.  Possibly my favorite American IPA so far. It hits nearly all my check marks for a well crafted IPA - Gorgeous Copper orange color with a dense head and nice lacing, tons of hop flavor, yet robust and balanced, and a nice chewy mouthfeel. Get a stronger nose on it this and would be almost perfect. As the standard Pale Ale from Sierra Nevada has become a popular choice for the masses to show their sophisticated taste and drink as a ""classy beer"" (and for good reason), I believe the true pale ale afficondos will reach for this beer instead.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jibbyvonjibb,4,"Pours crystal clear, golden. Smells of pears and caramel from crystal malts. Some citrusy hops to balance.  Taste is grapefruit citrus and bitter, with brown sugar sweetness balancing in the start. The finish is quite bitter. It is medium bodied , on the malty side for IPA's.  This is a well balanced beer for what it is, but I prefer my ipa's with less caramel flavor and dryer in general.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,thedindaniel,4.45,"I've had this beer many, many times but only recently have I really begun to appreciate what a fantastic beer it is. What's even more impressive is how easy it is to find and the very reasonable price for which it is sold.  This beer pours a copperish clear color with a good amount of off white head that lingers throughout the drink. Lots of great smells jump out of this beer... sweet caramel malts and very fruity hops. The taste is a very grassy bitter flavor (just the way I like my IPA's!). The beer is perfectly carbonated and though it's not a chewy beer, I think the body suits the flavor profile well. Easily, one of the best IPA's you can easily buy at several locations.  It's been said by many folks but I feel it must be said again. Sierra Nevada does not get enough credit for being one of the best breweries in America that produce top notch beers at great prices.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,STKPICR0720,4.25,"This brew was very piney and had a hint of grapefruit to it. The taste is smooth and surely full of hops. Nothing in this brew is over powering. Just simply put a very well balanced alcohol feel and a very balanced hop feel. This is an easy to drink, go to for 7.2% and a must for anyone who loves IPA's.

Nice head, good retention with nice lacing along the sides.  S: Minimal aroma, but the hops are the major note in it. The smell is good, but just kinda soft.  T: Hoppy flavor, nice pine notes. Not so citrusy as many IPAs tend to lean towards, but more nutty and earthier. I enjoyed this one a bit more than I was expecting.  M: Smooth. Really easy to drink, not overly bitter or dry, nice body and texture.  O: Pretty decent IPA.

140,30420,TastyTaste,4.36,"Some breweries just get it; how to make a well rounded, clean-tasting beer, and go from style-to-style with ease. Sierra Nevada can do just that and proves it with this easy drinking, hoppy, balanced IPA. The hops are of course the star of the show, piney, peppery, light metallic twang. The malt provides sweetness and base, but cedes the spotlight to that big hop blast. Very well-rounded and enjoyable in the IPA style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: Grapefruit, pine, lemon, strong herbal notes. Bit of alcohol in the nose. Slightly sweet malt in the background.  T/M: Bottle is a couple months old, so the hops have faded slightly, which emphasizes the bready, toasty malt character. Impressive malt backbone for a hop-focused beer. High bitterness level. Herbal and grapefruity in the finish. Mouthfeel is fairly light; good summer beer.  Overall: This is a serious IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,psuKinger,3.18,"First bottle from case dated 5/19/2011. Not as fresh as I'd like, but it's difficult to find super-fresh West Coast IPA out here in PA. To be poured into a standard curved-rim pint glass.  A: Pours a lighter shade and rather clear golden-orange color, with a nice thick head on top, a full fingers worth, with big thick pancake-batter like bubbles scattered throughout the top (but not centered near the middle).  S: The nose is piney and sweet... not very dank or citrus at all. A bit disappointing, from what I remember of this guy.  T: Huge sweetness. Need to recheck the date on this. The bottle is listed as ""1139 112 56"". From ""Fresh Beer Only"", that indicates the 139 day of 2011, or a little after Mid-May. Roughly 6 weeks old... certainly not ""ideal"", but I wouldn't have thought it was sufficient to turn this thing so malty.  Some grapefruit and a touch of bitterness is present on the back end, but far less than needed here.The beer starts smooth and light, with immediate malt sweetness shining through, before a thicker malt backbone comes together with what's left of the hops here to round out the flavor profile.  M: Thick and full, but lacking the hop oils on the finish that I like from an IPA.  D/O: This beer is ""fine"". Not particularly ""good"". Not exceptionally ""bad"". My only frustration is I bought an entire case of this... and I'm not thrilled about filling my beer fridge with this ""ok"" brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Knapp85,4.12,"This beer poured out as a hazy looking yellow color. The head was big white and sticky. The smell of the beer had a great nose full of hop aromas.

140,30420,DrStiffington,4.2,"Just picked up a sixer of this because I found a very fresh case to crack open. I've had a few of these before, but I figured it was time to review one... Pours nicely with a dark orange color and a decent foamy head. The lacing rings stick to the side as I drink it down. I get a definite citrus hop aroma from this one. Not overpowering, but pleasant. The taste is pretty similar. Kind of tangy, somewhat bitter. Overall, a very solid IPA. Not the best, but Torpedo is one of the regular IPAs that I can always count on. Another winner from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,PollardsVision,4.5,"12 oz. bottle into pint glass.  Pours a beautiful rich amber. Darker and less hazy than many IPAs. Very slight citrus in the background, but this one's all about that piney, hoppy bite. I could see some not finding this one to be very balanced, but for me, it's just right. Most other IPAs get too grapefruity for me, but not this one. For me, this has just enough citrus flavor to keep the hops from overpowering, but nothing more.  This is the perfect beer for me for satisfying a big hop craving.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Significant lacing on the sides of the glass.  S: Citrus and biscuity malt dominate the nose. Some pine and floral hop aromas present as well.  T: Sweetness of honey and citrus burst onto the tongue at the onset of the sip. Some biscuit joins the citrus in the middle as some pine sneaks into the flavor profile. Strong hop bitterness in the finish.  M: Medium light body is the feel on the tongue with adequate carbonation.  This is a delicious ipa. The flavors are complex and well blended. The hop profile is balanced well by the citrusy sweetness. A very good offering from Sierra Nevada.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Good retention and lace.  S: Grapefruit with a bit of mango, tiny whiff of pine.  T: Pure grapefruit up front and through the finish. Mango/peach in the middle and pine on the end. Dry overall, but the sweetness swells a bit in the middle. The pine notes have a cumulative effect and dominate after the first few sips into the glass. Still, the flavor has a clean quality that is nice. Further into the glass, a dry biscuit flavor comes forth.  M: Light and slightly astringent, a bit soda-like.  O: Solid, tasty and worth revisiting. If you like your IPA on the dry side, this one is for you.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Viciousknishs,4.2,A- pours a burnt orangish amber with a finger and a half of off white head that sticks around.  S- predominately big leafy pine aromas with an awesome grapefruit rind citrus note. A tinge of biscuity malt sweetness some how makes it's way into the aroma like a gentle whisper. Finishs with a dry hoppiness.  T- starts of with a canvis of biscuit malt that is soon painted with a leafy piney hop flavor that transitions into an assertive yellow grapefruit. Agressive bitterness towards the end that dries out the palate leaving a lingering herbal citrus hop flavor long into the aftertaste.  MF- active slick mouthfeel with average carbonation and a medium body.  D- hoppy enough to appease a hop craving but balanced and smooth. Great option if you have to get beer at a grocery store.

A-appears to be a dark orange. small head that retains very well. poured a couple minutes ago and hasn't moved.  S- slightly fruity and hoppy. I would maybe say a grapefruit. and again hops. smells malty. makes me want to drink it.  T- hits hard with a prickly hop feeling on my tongue almost immediately. then becomes like a malty/fruity taste before finishing with a very strong hop bite. the fruit would be described as slight grapefruit mixed with some hops. and then builds into the hop bite.  MF- basically just leaves me with a very potent hop aftertaste. maybe a slight malt type coating in my mouth but basically just a hop aftertaste.  O- Not bad. Could definitely drink again. As I always like to mention I am not the biggest IPA fan but never mind having one. Just not my favorite type. For an IPA though I really don't mind this one. Not my Favorite but pretty good. I feel like there is a lack of some flavor. I don't mind the hops but for amount I would like a bit more flavor to compliment it. But again overall a pretty good IPA.

140,30420,IrishEyes32250,4.67,"This is a regular in my fridge and it's about damn time I review it. I shouldn't be this lazy about reviewing a beer this good. Shame on me. Here goes.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle of Heaven into my tulip, which is probably the greatest beer drinking vessel ever devised.  A - Hazy copper in color. Like a well used penny. Hard pour brings out just over a two finger off white head. Again, my glass must be clean because I'm getting some decent lacing from this gem.  S - Swirling the glass I get that head back and it immediately kicks citrus rind and caramel malts right into my face. I also detect an ever so slight amount of pine at the very end as well.  T - I can't believe a beer that is this flavorful is this available and this inexpensive. HUGE grapefruit with caramel malt to balance and then more citrus and pine on the back end. Finishes dry and bitter. Phenomenal. Sierra Nevada does it again. And it hides it's 7.2% abv well. As a side note I'm beginning to think of Pale Ales like Saiyans from Dragonball Z. Saiyan (Pale Ale), Super Sayain (IPA), Ultra Saiyan (Sierra took liberty and created a new category with the Extra IPA), Super Saiyan 2 (Double/Imperial IPA), Super Saiyan 3 (Triple IPA), etc. This is an Extra IPA so it's PAST IPA and NOT QUITE SS2. It's toeing that line. And damn if it doesn't do it perfectly. I love West Coast IPA's. And I'm apparently a dork.  M - Medium body. Nice Carbonation. Bitter and dry finish.  O - Again, I can't believe a beer this good is so available and inexpensive. I can get a 6 pack of this for 7.99 to 8.99. As the Alstrom brothers noted, Sierra was one of the only one of the only West Coast breweries to not produce a year-round IPA. And then they go ahead and utilize a new device called a Hop Torpedo to get every bit of hop goodness they can into the beer and go one step further release it as an Extra IPA. Year round.

As other have noted it maintains its head through most of the The mouthfeel is a little more bitter than other Extra IPAs I have experienced however is not overwhelming. Full bodied.

140,30420,weizenbob,4.3,"Bottled 4/6/11. Purchased at The Corner Store in Central Lake, MI and poured into a nonic pint glass. The pour yields about a finger of off-white head. Retention is excellent, perhaps the best of any IPA I've purchased. Lacing clings to the glass all the way to the end of the experience. Active carbonation can be seen through the glass. The brew is an orange tinted mahogany color. This is really what an IPA should aspire to look like.  Not surprisingly, the aroma is very hop-forward. Sweet citrus hop aromas dominate, bringing to mind tangerine and grapefruit. There is also a nice undercurrent of floral aromas and some pineyness as well. It is quite sweet smelling. It's not the usual take on India Pale Ale, but it seems to have covered all of the bases, just in case.  The flavor is playing it a little safe, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with this beer. There is a solid balance between hops and malt. Mild grapefruit bitterness comes into play early. Piney hops are subordinate but none the less present. The malty side kicks in soon after, putting a big sweetness and chewy graininess on display. The finish is bitter with more citrusy hops. It's riding the line between APA and IPA, but ultimately, this is both hoppier as well as maltier than Sierra Nevada's classic (and definitive) Pale Ale.  This is a medium bodied brew, and pretty much perfectly to style. The carbonation is moderate and it cuts nicely through the sizable malt profile. It's not astounding, and maybe even just a touch on the thin side, but it's difficult to find fault here. It may not be a homerun in the mouth, but it's easily a standup double.  Overall, this is a nice, somewhat-above-average IPA, and a safe standby. The 7.2% ABV is nowhere to be found on the tongue thanks to the ample hop and malt profiles. The taste and mouthfeel are pretty much to style. The price and availability ensure that there is almost always a descent IPA around that isn't going to gouge your wallet. It's not my first pick for an IPA, but even amid a poor beer selection I know I can always feed a hop craving with Torpedo Extra IPA.  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (reference my profile for an explanation) On most days I would probably give two Schlitz for a Torpedo.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smell isn't as massive on as you might expect, rich caramel malt, fruity hops - passionfruit and grapefruit. Sort of bitter piney hop note as well. Both malt and hops compete for attention.  Tastes amazing, lovely caramel malt character is married with the fresh, fruity hops. Bittersweet finish, bitterness is mild but does linger. Hint of alcohol becomes noticable, though it is well hidden.  Mouthfeel is absolutely spot on for me, medium bodied with lively carbonation, feels thick and full.

Colour is a fantastic deep orange, pouring a low full white head that retains faint white lacing.  Flavour is powerful: hops dry the palate and give a sensational IPA mouth feel with a noticeable citrus kicker. Very dry IPA.  Overall a fantastic IPA. With its alcohol content at 7.2 it is difficult to place it in either the double or single IPA category. Drawing some parallels personally to the Dogfish Head 9.0, I am tempted to place it closer to the double IPA category. It therefore bats on par with some of the best double IPAs I have had encountered so far. Excellent beer Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mattkoon,4.16,over the past few months I've been drifting from one ipa to another. There was a time when I wasn't much of a fan. I had a weak sissy lady palate. Now that I have worked on it I quite enjoy the bitter piney flavor. The sierra navada torpedo is one of the best I've come across. The color is fantastic. A rich electric copper with a white gold head. The smell is a complex bitter like the rind of a piney orange. The flavor is a rush of citrus and bitter swirled into an explosion.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: Smells lightly hoppy with some lemon, orange, and grapefruit citrus that work very well together. You’d expect an “extra” IPA to be a bit more pungent, but this is actually quite nice.  T/M: You can taste the hops right off the bat with that complex citrus flavor. It has a medium amount of carbonation and finishes just a little bitter.  For a citrus IPA, this is a solid offering.

140,30420,eat,4.22,"A good cover of off-white head rests on top of a slightly hazy amber body. Lots of sticky lacing.  This smells about as nice as I could hope for. Tons of juicy tropical fruit: lychee, passion fruit and pineapple with light pine and candy malt.  Bitterness is fairly high but just right for my taste in IPAs. The flavour presents more pine than did the nose, though there is still a nice sweet citrus element underneath. Some roast character enters along side some sweet (but well-balanced) candy sugar. Grapefruit lingers perfectly on the finish, with just enough drying. Alcohol might be a bit too hot for it's weight; I think it does end up blending in pretty well though. I definitely appreciate a higher ABV in an IPA.  The feel is a little on the thin side, though not too bad. Medium body and moderately carbonated.  This is a really well-made IPA. I wish we had commonly-available IPAs like this in Canada. Sierra Nevada is a widely-distributed brewery and the US is pretty lucky to have easy access to this stuff (and their fantastic pale ale) over much of the country. Crazy drinkable.

Lastly, bitterness. 4.5/5  Mouthfeel- This is a little thicker than I typically like, due to all the malt.

The taste is very malty and citrusy...and floral like! The smell is exactly as the taste is. I'm trying to put my finger on the fruit that it tastes and smells of and I can't think of it. Perhaps canalope?  M - A nice creamy light-medium bodied beer that's sure to quench your dry mouth on a hot summer day and at the same time, is formal enough to sit and talk about.

S: There are moderate aromas of pine resin hops in the nose along with some hints of citrus. T: Like the smell, the taste is very hoppy and is filled with piney flavors and a moderate amount of bitterness; it also has some hints of caramel malts. The bitterness really stands out in the finish. M: It feels medium-bodied and a bit sticky on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.

T - Sweet opener which quickly gives way to a big bitter hop hit in the middle of the taste, with a lingering bitter finish. The taste follows the aromas, with pine, citrus and other fruit notes.  M - Medium body, medium carbonation, quite smooth and lingering.  O - Overall a fantastic example of the style.

This poured an attractive golden amber into my pint glass with an off white 1 1/2 inch foamy head that stuck to the glass.  The fragrance was dominated by hops with some bread and herbal tones.  Upon first sip, i was immediately blasted with piney hops front and center. I picked up some grapefruit characteristics as well.  I will tell you up front, I am not a hophead so take that in consideration here. I liked the beer but wished it was more complex and less hop forward. If you like piney hops with little else mixed in, you will like this. Some reviewers said it was complex. I think there were some complex things going on, but they were buried deep beneath the hops. I prefer complexity with more balance.

Bready, biscuity malt sweetens the aroma a bit and some hints of honey on toast add to the malt richness.  T: Hops taste fresh and bitter but so refreshing. Grapefruit, apricot, are clean and herbal notes are slightly spicy and bittering. Toasted malt, toffee, bready but enough to add some balance.  M: Crisp light to medium body and clean, dry finish.

Starts sweet with some tropical fruit notes, heads into bitter territory with some citrus and pine. Finishes with lingering bitterness with a touch of spice.  Mouthfeel is dry, beer is medium bodied.  At first I was unimpressed. I thought the malts took over this beer too much. I tried it again and let the beer warm a bit and now it really impresses me.

140,30420,azdback,3.76,"Poured into my Spaten tumbler glass. I think this is fresh but not sure. There are some numbers that don't make sense to me, but no definite fresh until date.  A very clear, dark orange color. Medium carbonation bubbles that lead to a three finger head. Head is just a shade dark of bright white and soapy in appearance. Lace is looking pretty good for now.  Smell is mostly of bread. Soggy ass, old bread. Just a hint of bitter citrus. Not a sweet citrus though, kind of like the smell of a bag of old tangerines.  Taste is much better than the smell. Much sweeter on the lips. Hop flavors of mild, bitter citrus. Not quite as bright and bitter as I prefer. The sweetness comes from the malt bill of this pretty well balanced IPA. As this warms I get much more of the biscuity taste i smelled at first.  The mouth is pretty average to above average for the style. Silky and refreshing, not a bit watery or thin and a bit over carbonated to me. Just a hint of alcohol on the throat. Very refreshing and overdrinkable.  Overall I enjoyed this even though it's not the hop bomb I expect California IPA's to be. It was well balanced without being too wimpy. Definitely a must try, and that's probably the greatest thing about this. It was very affordable.

My conclusion was that I could not pick a favorite, for they are both great beers. Overall, Torpedo is a bit lighter (in both color and malt flavor, not necessarily body) and cleaner. (2012 Update:) Torpedo is indeed (still) similar to Celebration, but each has some distinct differences that are clearer to me now than they were 2 years ago. Celebration tastes like a bigger beer (more toasted, more caramel, more intense hops), yet it's somehow lower in ABV. Torpedo is smooth, streamlined, and surprisingly easy to drink. Which is better?

140,30420,zbuc919,3.06,"Beer was poured from a 12 oz bottle to a pint glass or mug. Right away was taken back by the lack of aromatics I would come to expect from something termed an ""extra IPA."" The aroma wasn't non-existent but left a lot to be desired. The taste wasn't as hoppy as expected either, a little citrus and piney but again I was expecting more from the label. It seemed to finish overly malty where I prefer the hops to be more balanced with the malt or to have it dried out a little more.  All in all this is far from a bad beer, I wasn't overly impressed the first time I had it, so I bought it again to be sure a few months later. It's not what I'd expect from an ""extra IPA"" but if you like some moderately hoppy beer with a bit more piney than citrus flavor with stronger malt finish give it a whirl.

I'm not sure how to categorize it but it's a great glass for a quality IPA or a DIPA.  Pours a nice, clear orange-copper color, slightly off-white head. One thing Sierra Nevada does well is build a nice head into their beers. This is very similar to their Pale Ale in having a resilient head that is there until the last sip. The lacing on this puppy is epic - leaving something akin to tree rings around the glass, memorializing each succulent sip. Swirling the liquid produces a new flurry of carbonation at the surface, replenishing portions of the sticky head. Danged good looking beer - worthy of a 5.0.  Hoppy nose, with bitter grapefruit coming through strongest. There are some floral notes, a bit of graininess and some other bitter citrus notes.  Herbal bitterness mixes in with the grapefruit rind - no grapefruit itself, just the rind. Someone mentioned some apple flavors to me, and I can taste that after it was mentioned. Bitter finish of pine resin and a bit of dryness. Describing the flavors doesn't quite give justice to the balance of flavors Sierra Nevada pulls off. A well done brew.  Clearly well-carbonated, but remarkably creamy and smooth. Not a light-ish beer by any measure - this is moderate bodied, but not heavy.  Good, drinkable beer.

Right away a sharp pine bite hits the palate. A lingering citrus flavor behind it and right before a bit of caramel sweetness comes in. Finishes slightly dry with little hint of alcohol.  Medium bodied with medium amounts of carbonation that really compliments the bite of the hops.  Really impressed with this offering from Sierra Nevada. While many of their beers have left me wanting something a bit more, this one really shines. Tons of sharp pine flavor perfectly balanced against a subtle malt sweetness. Not only is it ""good for Sierra Nevada,"" but also as good, if not better, than many other IPAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Spider889,3.8,"On tap at Winking Lizard on 4/8/11. Served in a signature Sierra Nevada imperial pint that I got to keep. The glass had a hop leaf laser etched into the base, sweet!  Amber in color, very good clarity, smallish head with just 'ok' lacing.  Smells sweet and hoppy. Lots of pine and light bitter citrus.  The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma. Mostly a pine-forward hop bill, but not really resinous.  Crisp, clean, and with a sweet finish. Very very dry though which became detracting.  Overall a very solid beer and a good value usually. But there are plenty of much better IPA's out there. I'll take a CIPA next please.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,falcozappa,4.32,"Appearance is copper or bronze with a head that is not as dense as for some IPAs leaving a little lacing on the glass. The scent as very piney. The hops dominate the flavour of this beer, with the piney taste being rounded out by a few light citrus notes. The effervescence of this beer gives it almost a champagne-like mouthfeel.  Along with Bell's Two Hearted, this is my go-to American IPA",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ranger7,2,"Poured from bottle to Sam Adams glass.  A - Nice and clear amber coloring.  S - Pleasant traditional flowery aroma.  T - Very hoppy. Good taste, but very strong.  M - The feel is smooth. The aftertaste is extremely bitter. Almost soapy. Not a fan.  Summary - I've been trying to expand my beer experiences. One area in particular I've been wanting to explore is IPAs. So far, I've enjoyed Dogfish Head, but not Sierra Nevada's Torpedo. It's simply way too strong with hops and an awfully bitter aftertaste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BeerLover99,4.48,"A: deep amber body, nice 1 finger head, good lacing  S: big lemon grass, nice malt,  T: grapefruit/orange, big pine malt, slow long bitter finish  M: med body, good oily mouth  O: Finally had a SN offering that I love. AP Level-IPA and the ABV is well hidden. Interesting and slightly different American IPA.  VERY GOOD, WORTH TRYING!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,quisatzhaderach,4.39,"The beer is an attractive copper color, and carries a sturdy head.  The smell of the beer is a delicate pairing of citrus and mint notes, supported by a strong resinous character.  A smooth mint character emerges from a balanced but monotonal bitterness as the taste develops. The grain presence is well put.  The beer is creamy and very drinkable, despite its strength.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DeltaGolfSierra,4.25,"Appearance is copper or bronze with an average-sized head that fades after a few minutes. Some lacing on the glass, but not much. Scents are typical for an IPA - a nice fruit cocktail smell of grapefruit, ripe pear, and a touch of pine.  Torpedo is an appropriate name for this beer, because it is a huge explosion of hops. The taste is all hops from start to finish - grapefruit flavors dominate, with a slight piney taste mixed in that's not overpowering. There might be a touch of breadiness in there too, but the hops are the focus. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with some pricklyness on the tongue. A really tasty beer, and a hop-head's dream.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jerskine,4.2,"A: clear, copper appearance with a minimum amount of foam but lots of nice caramel colored lacing  S: big hop aroma, which should be expected from this one; some citrus scents that are characteristic of a standard ipa; the unique scent in this beer is the strong lemon grass aroma that arises as you take gulp after gulp  T: very unique tasting ipa; the hops used in this beer give an unusual spicey, pungent flavor that hit the tongue hard; this is very ""peppery"" with a distinct vegetation-like taste  M: nicely carbonated; hits the tongue sharply and leaves considerable hoppy resin feeling in your mouth  O: I've had this beer quite a bit and I can say it is very unique when compared to the dozens and dozens of other IPAs I've had. If you are looking for a beer to hit your taste buds hard, this is the one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,afksports,3.93,"I'm having this on tap at Amity Hall on my passport quest. This is one of those drying IPA's like Lagunitas, that tells me that maybe I don't like IPA's as much as I think I do. I love when the malts bring a payoff to all that hop body, but this is just grapefruit and grapefruit pith. Growing up, my mom sprinkled sugar on our grapefruit. Torpedo makes me want sugar.  So while I anticipate this could be a great we with food - maybe Thai or Cambodian - I'm at happy hour now and not eating.  It looks great though. Amber and copper hues chill in a tender haze below a well sustained head and tingly lace on the aides of the glass. I can see my reflection in the bubbles. The nose in it grows with a rising temperature, and my guess is this brew improves around 55-60 degrees. The taste is bitter citrus and pine, combined with a light biscuit bread malt that isn't big enough to match the hops. This baby is extra.  Can't see it taking out a sub, but Torpedo stands on it's own as it finishes clingy to the throat producing that feeling that a lot of people love. Hops. In your face. And your palate.  Ultimately it's not for me. I'll stick with SN Pale. But this is a well built beer available to IPA lovers at every bodega in NYC. And there's something to be said for that. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ummswimmin,3.23,"Before I start, I should say that I thoroughly enjoy double IPA's. I am excited to try each new one that I see.  That being said, my stardards are pretty forgiving.  I poured the Torpedo from a 16 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  On the pour I had a mild smell of hoppiness. Typically the hoppy smell is much stronger in a double IPA.  The flavors are very sharp and bitter. I get the pineyness, but there was very little balance. I get a lot of alcohols, but it seemed to exceed the ABV. The aftertaste is also bitter, with very little redeeming flavor.  I recommend Great Divide or Firestone (if you can find it) over this one by a long shot.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Rhettroactive,2.79,"From 12oz bottle to Bruges hybrid glass on 5/15/11 *From notes  A: Fairly dark resiny-amber. A good pour yields a good head: 2.25 fingers that leads to some nice lacing.  S: A bit boozy on the nose. Earthy grains and malt that seems to have sat around for a bit too long prior to brewing. Almost no hops on the nose. Not what I was expecting, and pretty dissapointing.  T: Bitter. Malt and barley, with a very grassy edge to it. No citrus or florals on it at all, as the bitter, biting hop oil and raw edamame overwhelm the entire palate and crush the tastebuds. Dissapointing yet again - not what I was expecting for a SN AIPA.  M: A bit sharp, but it's not offensive. The bubbles actually help to balance the overdose of brash bitterness this brew carries.  O: Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA was a letdown. I was hoping to find a go-to, everyday AIPA, and instead I found an overly bitter, earthy mess. Was the bottle fresh enough? Maybe that was it - I don't know. I'd be willing to give this one more shot to find out, but otherwise this one's a wash.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Luigi,4.8,"I am a sucker for any quality American IPA. From Sierra Nevada I would not expect less.  Once poured foamy two finger off white head is produced with a nice sticky lace that sticks around until the last sip. Not to mention a clear deep copper tone.  The aroma is a hop heads dream. Strong piney, and citrus notes, Almost a sweet sour hint as well.  If you are looking for a big IPA this ale delivers. Big west coast hop notes. Bitter, almost sharp on the palate. The finish is dry bitter but balanced with some bread like notes.  Good medium body, the high alcohol content gives it a slick feel on the tongue but it drys out quickly leaving a nice bitter aftertaste.  Overall, this IPA is what us hop heads expect and cannot get enough of. It has so far been around all year. If you love American IPA's you will never go wrong with brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,forsakenpariah,4.79,"12 oz. bottle -&gt; snifter  A - Pours a light golden copper. An inch or so of light sticky head that stood a good way above the rim of the glass and lingered a while and clung nicely on the way down. a quick swirl quickly summoned a decent amount of foam and aroma.  S - Very prominent citrus hops up front. A closer sniff reveals a generous amount of pine straw, jasmine, mango, and other tropical fruits. As the beer warms a very light sweet aroma peeks its tiny head out of the mountain of hops. Everything here appears in perfect harmony; I really couldn't ask for a better aroma out of an IPA.  T - Tons of brutally uncompromising bitterness dominate the palate off the top. The bitterness fades off a little and lends way to a flavor of grapefruit juice, pine oil, and tropical fruits. As these fade I can detect a very pleasant slight malty sweetness. The bitterness remains aggressive throughout the entire beer. All flavors are still perfectly balanced; there isn't quite as much sweetness as you find in many IPAs, and that's just the way I like it!  M - Moderately thick while never seeming too sticky or syrupy. Medium carbonation, perfect for the style. Again, I couldn't ask for any more.  This is a fantastic IPA. It may not be the best in the world, but it's about the most bang for your buck, and very readily available. One of my all time favorites. I just can't wait till I can get this in a can so I can take it with me on a biking trip!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,WastingFreetime,4.25,"Poured into a standard pint glass from a very cold 12oz bottle.  A. A light amber that tinges almost orange hues around the edges of the glass. The head fluffs up quite nicely if the bottle is fresh, but dissipates down to nothing relatively quickly. Lots of effervescence is present in both appearance and mouthfeel. Its a pretty one, all right.  S. Grapefruit rind, pine needles, vaguely jasmine-like floral notes, and a back end of mango chutney! However, I cannot smell the malt at all until the glass was allowed to warm for a bit. This was probably my fault, as the bottle was unusually cold to begin with. Also, the malt scent probably was being partially masked behind so much fresh hop scent.  T,M. What you smell is what you get for hop flavor, except for the mango. I'm a little disappointed that the mango smell didn't quite translate as well into flavor notes as all the other hops characteristics did. If I were in charge at Sierra Nevada, I would have slightly increased the amount of Citra relative to the crystal and magnum. But than I am partial to citrus-y IPAS and YMMV, whatever. DO NOT SERVE TOO COLD LIKE I DID. At first it tasted way too astringent. An one-trick pony, if you will. Five minutes of warming to room temp in the glass and everything snaps into perfect balance as the malt appears and provides the baseline that anchors the furious guitar solos on your tongue that the hops make with a context that makes sense.  Overall a very crisp, refreshing IPA that hides its ABV surprisingly well and showcases many of the different aspects of flavor that hops can do all within the same beer. And balances them well against each other. This IPA is one of the 'old standbys' I try to maintain a regular supply of in my fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste:  A great bitter kick that brings an herbal flavor with it. Grapefruit follows and lingers nicely in the after taste.  Mouthfeel:  Full bodied IPA (almost borders on a DIPA in my opinion) that coats the palate in a very bold way.

Solid hop aroma featuring grassy pine and grapefruit notes. Plenty of caramel malt aroma in the background.  Tasty hop blend with the caramel maltiness. As it warms, the toffee-like malt comes through a little brighter than the hops. But, plenty of bitter hop taste to put this one on the edge of being a DIPA.

Very good balance in the nose on the herbal and citrus hops. The malt aromas just come off as flat and non-descript. Somewhat funky and very unlike most American IPAs.  Grapefruit like hops, somewhat interesting herbal flavor, and I’m starting to pick up on some pine. This bottle might be a hair old, I can’t read their dating system, but what I’m getting her is a truly well balance IPA. The hops build like they are going to take a bite out of my tongue and then they step back and let a strong toasty malt mellow things out. The end result is a rather different IPA than I’d have expected.  Smooth, creamy, and just darn clean finishing. One of the better drinking IPAs I’ve had recently, but far from the best. The weight of the alcohol is certainly in here even if I can’t taste it. This beer hits imo the line between a double and single IPA. Up the IBU’s and this alcohol and body could be a double IPA by any standard.  I like this offering from Sierra.

140,30420,BarryMFBurton,4.5,"Bought this in a “make your own six-pack” at my local grocery store. I’ve heard of Sierra Nevada, but this is the first time I’ve tried it. I consider myself a bit of a hophead, so if anything says “Extra IPA” on the bottle, I’m down.  A: Surprisingly dark. A nice amber/rust color, with an enormous white head that creates a ton of bubbly lacing. Looks great!  S: Hops, hops, hops. Some citrus zest (mostly lemon), but it’s all about the bright, American hops here.  T: This is a very hoppy beer. A lot hops can sometimes mean an overwhelming saltiness, or a diminished palate. Not here, though. This is good old-fashioned craft beer at its best: don’t be stingy with the flavor, but don’t overwhelm the drinker. It’s hoppy, yes, but in a smooth way that brings other flavors to the taste buds with ease. There’s the lemon again, with some herbal/floral notes (a little less than I would like, but still a nice addition). Just a hint of roasted malt and breadiness leaves the aftertaste crisp and refreshing. A great taste for summer.  M: High carbonation dances on the tongue and brings out the piney bitter flavors even more. If they toned down the carbonation, I feel the smoky/biscuit undertones would come out even more (which would bring a little more complexity to the palate). But hey, it’s an “Extra IPA,” so it works well with the style.  O: This isn’t a head-turning “gourmet” beer. It’s just great American hops, loaded with even more hops, then brewed slowly and carefully. The second I tasted it, I thought “Wow, what a great session beer.” Then I saw the 7.2% ABV. Well, a good beer, anyway! If all of Sierra Nevada’s brews are like this, then they just found a new fan.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Jreb79,4.67,"A - Poured into a pint glass. Very nice clear blaze orange hue with an inche of off white head. Reminded me off fall. Very nice on the eyes.  S - A distict hoppy citrus and grainy smell from 2 feet away. Under my nose, I could find fruity alcohol esters and a desecnt bready malt backbone. Nothing compared to the citrus and grain from the hops. Very nice.  T - Very much of the same. I didn't expect the malt to come through like it did. It balanced this hoppy brew very nicely.  M - I think this is one of the fullest mouthfells on an IPA to date. Oily resins coat the mouth after each swallow.  IMHO - I really enjoyed this beer.

I took a chance on the Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA, and it turned out to be a good move. The Torpedo pours with a luxurious off-white head, has a light aroma of hops and a nice deep color. So far so good. The hop flavor comes early when you taste the Torpedo, and goes the distance. Nice bitters aftertaste. Very nice balance of hop and malt, a drinkable IPA.

A - A lovely golden brown with a frothy head and lacing that melts away as soon as it forms. Promising!  S - A floral yeasty aroma around this beer, kind of like fresh baked bread with a lot of edge to it.  T - The flavor starts light and slowly develop as the sip fills your mouth. As the carbonation fades away the beer becomes quite aggressive with sharp hop bitterness and yeast to give the beer a real bite. Torpedo keeps the citrus mild, preferring to give the drinker unrelentingly sharp bitterness...which is welcome for a change.  M - Opening up into an aggressive brew, it is definitely an acquired taste and not for the faint of heart.

140,30420,RossCain,3.9,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint  A: Poured a hazy apricot hue with a fluffy yet dense off-white head of about 2 inches on an aggressive pour. Lots of lacing around the sides of the glass with this beer and the head really stuck around with a bubbly retention.  S: Piney with a certain resinous quality blending with nuances of fresh fruit strongly reminiscent of pineapple. Bold a definitely with a nice finish of sweet malty character in the background.  T: Bitter and assertive piney hops assault the palate from the first sip, rushing into a woody earthiness complimented well by the sweet notes of tart fruit and ripe pineapple. Bittersweet in the finish with a final overture of caramel malts, an overall aggressive but at the same time remarkably well balanced beer.  M: Medium body with a sticky quality when it enters the mouth. It does have a coating character that fills the mouth with a moderate pucker in the finish. The alcohol is unfortunately a little hot and more noticeable than I believe it should be.  O: A great strong and robust IPA in my opinion. The notes of pineapple were certainly a nice deviation from the normal grapefruit and citrus peel. Certainly a beer I will revisit for both the great, bold character and the price! My only hope would be to taste a little less alcohol the next time around.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,NaLoGra,1.77,"Honestly, I enjoy IPAs every once in a while, but this one was just way too strong for me. Average white head, smelled strongly of hops, just like the taste.  I can see how those who love IPAs will enjoy this, but for the occasional IPA drinker like me, its a bit overpowering and dry with a very, very strong hop flavor, with an aftertaste that just doesn't go away.  It definitely deserves the ""extra IPA"" label that appears on the bottom. Gave me a headache after drinking. Will not buy again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,NickRivers,4.42,"12oz. bottle poured into a Stone Snifter.  A&S - Clear copper, two-finger white head, medium/heavy lacing very carbonated with lots of bubbles. The nose is mostly made up of pine hops with a little citrus and a little bready malt. Theres few other nots I can't get through the pine.  T&M - Very sweet crisp front with an almost honey feel, turns to a pine sap flavor, kind of maple in the middle then the citrus hops kick in and turns everything to a very bitter finish. May be to bitter for some.  O - A fantastic beer.  I like to think of this as the piney SN Pale Ale. Despite the DIPA title, its got a great medium body thats balanced for the most part. I wouldn't say this is as balanced as DFH 90, theres definitely more hop presence here as appose to all the malt floatin' around in the 90. I respect the gent that noted its evergreen forest feel. I've always said that SN takes you to the image on the label. They're a very earthy brewery, even there porter hits home. Bottom line? An amazing beer everyone should try, personally a great session beer for a nice dinner at a friends house? Fancy picnic? Pick it up! you won't be disappointed!

You can smell the whole coneness of the hops. Piney and a bit floral/citrus. Some forrest evergreen natural character. Mild malt sweetness gives it some depth.  Another great balanced example of the style. Not the biggest malt or hop flavors you will find but what is there combines well and meshes together nicely. For me it sort of mirrors the interpretation of their pale and celebration. Lots of hop character but balanced by big malt as well.

App- When I poured it, I got a good 1 1/2 finger head because of the aggressive pour and the color stood out, a little amber, a light highlight shimmer, well done coloring.  Smell- It's a good smelling IPA. Not a punch you in the face beer but very nice. Has a sweet floral note and some good hop aroma.  Taste- In the midwest, this was a west coast beer. I felt at home with it. It had the hops and the grapefruit and a big kick behind it.  Mouth- Medium bodied with a medium carb level and leaves you wanting more after each taste. This is a beer to get people into IPA's and now I remember how I loved it so much but in a world of west coast IPA's get forgotten.  Drink- You know its a small bottle but that ABV is very large and lets you know. Good beer.

140,30420,Groomsy,4.08,"12 oz. bottle poured into nonic. According to the code on the label, this was bottled on March 3rd. Yay, freshness!  Appearance: Heck yes, perfect pour! The beer is a copper/orange color with hints of gold an amber. Very clear body with some carbonation and a little bit of sediment in suspension topped by a towering frothy, ivory 3-finger head which sticks around for a long time, fading to a half-finger cap of foam and leaves great lacing behind.  Smell: Very solid. Lots of citrus notes (like most of SN's beers) with floral and pine scents accented the powerful tropical fruit, all backed by a pinch of pale malt sweetness. Appetizing. Mostly hoppy, but enough balance in there to make me eager. Citrus notes grow more pronounced as the beer warms  Taste: The malt profile of this beer, although smells like pale malts, is slightly toasted and bready and hits the front of the palate. This is followed by a big flash of grapefruit zest, some more citrus notes (orange/lemon?), a pinch of floral hops, and a nice closing note of pine flavors shadowed by a toasty biscuit flavor of malts. The first half is ""brighter"" than the second half with the flashes of flavors, but the earthiness and herbal notes in the finish are very well-done. Even for a fairly hoppy beer, this is still extremely balanced. Full flavor, but not overwhelming.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy, low carbonation kick. Smooth and dreamy on the palate. Big lingering flavors of pine and grass in the finish, maybe just a hint of alcohol warming accompanied by a drying finish that grows as the beer warms, but it doesn't leave you totally parched. Medium body overall, if slightly more watery than what I expected; but well-rounded and goes down very smoothly, which is very different from other IPA's I've had.  Overall: A darn good IPA, I would go so far to say that this is the benchmark American IPA and is the standard of the style. Maybe not an IPA for beginners, but this is great. Definitely check it out if you can get it fresh.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,suspect,3.71,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Duvel Tulip. Served around 50 degrees.  A: Very clear copper color comes from the standard stubby Sierra Nevada bottle. Aggressive pour yields a 3 finger white fluffy head. Steady stream of tiny bubbles pour upwards to freedom at the top of the glass. Lacing was nice and retained as the glass emptied.  S: Strong pine aroma here with some fruitiness to it. Not as hop-forward as a double-ipa but definitely more hop presence than a typical American IPA.  T: Very nice flavor. A well balanced bitterness that dances on my tastebuds balanced ever so slightly at the end by sweet malt presence. Very piney hops in this one, not as much citrus here as in the nose.  M: Medium body with average carbonation. Bitterness yields to a dry finish that gets dryer as you progress through the glass.  O: This could very well be my go-to when I need to bring a six-pack to a party.

Bitter but not unbalanced, there's definitely some sweet malt hiding in there.  Mouthfeel- Thick with a lots of carbonation but not overkill. This is perfect IMO.

As I mentioned in my Sierra Pale Ale review, that beer took me out of hte Miller Lite and Bud Light phase of my life into the craft brew phase.  I rate this higher than Dogfish or Titan or any of the other supposed IPA champs. This has the same mouthfeel that the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has, but with some extra hoppiness.

140,30420,veinless,3.91,"Pours a beautiful glassy clear amber, with a dollop of one-finger off-white head on top that retains very well and leaves spotty lace. Ridiculous transparency sets this appearance apart, though the lace holds it back from a perfect score.  Restrained grapefruit and lemon citrus nose is promising but not strong enough. Pine and resin are definitely there in the back along with some sticky caramel malt.  Taste is incredibly balanced - the malts and hops hit you all at once, rather than in waves. Starts sweet and malty, with strong caramel and toffee notes, but then moves to a candied citrus flavor that is a little bit too sweet for me, but still quite nice. The beer then gradually dries out, leading to a piny, bitter dry finish. Even then, a floral sweetness manages to come through. The flavors perhaps could have been integrated into the beer better, but individually they are all of great quality.  Mouthfeel is lively and maybe even a little bit too carbonated, though the rest of the feel is exemplary for the style. Drinkability is tough to gauge due to the saccharine start, but the dry finish helps a great deal.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

M- Big mouthfeel, creamy.  D/O- Is this considered a ""classic"" yet? I know it hasn't been out too long (2 years maybe?) but this has to be the best widely available IPA in America. Overall, I'd throw this into the upper echelon of IPAs, albeit on the low end. At 7.3% just a few of these will have you acting goofy.

Very fresh tasting with pine, resin and citrus rind and then a finish that lasts for a long time. Smooth but then incredibly dry, leaving you wanting more.  Very nice beer but again I can't help but hoping there was a bit more balance. I find myself comparing it to DFH 90 minute but with less of a malt profile.

There is a powerful alcohol smell that is barely masked by the incredible character.  Taste: Wow. Much maltier than I expected. I'd call this an autumn IPA. Good caramel Malts blended with nice sappy hops. Some flavor of peach and lemon zest. Slightly burnt flavor that I enjoy. This is a dream beer for me.  Mouthfeel: There is a good creamy mouthfeel of deliciously balanced sweet Malts and bitter piney hops. Finishes perfectly leaving no aftertaste. Well done.  Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable.

About 3/4 of the way through my glass, there is sporadic lacing - not much, but pretty standard for this style.  S - the first thing on the nose for me is the malt sweetness, followed by big hops. I like this a lot - it smells like it will be very well balanced, even w/ the heavy hop aroma.  T - strong bitter hops on the front end, mild malt flavor in the middle and a nice crisp fruity finish. Definitely citrus and pine flavor mixed in with the hops, and even some apple notes on the finish. A very nice IPA - it has strong hops but balanced very nicely.  M - crisp, nice carbonation. Doesn't stand in the way of the flavor.  D - I keep coming back to how well balanced this beer is. It does a nice job of having complex flavors and making them all work in harmony. Too often I've found IPA's to be very heavy on the hop bitterness, which I like, as long it has a good malt backbone to balance that bitterness. This hits the spot in that regard and is quite nice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,francisweizen,4.25,"I wish that this could be my go to sixpack down here in NZ, but alas.  A: Golden orange with a nice foamy white head. Good lacing.  S: Fresh 'C' hops, and a nice biscuit back bone  T: Fresh hops, biscuity malts, superbly well balanced  M: Fresh and easy. Inviting you to sip more and more  O: I used to put down 2 or 3 of these a night. This is an absolutely great IPA at an absolutely amazing price.

140,30420,gskitt,3.76,"Vigorous pour produces a decent white head on top of a golden, orange, hazy hued brew. Lots of stick and lacing. The oily and resiny bitterness of the hops hits you right away, but doesn't stick around. Not to much citrus, but pine and bitterness are prevalent. Mouthfeel is one to be expected, puckering and bitter. This is a solid American IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bigkamp,2.69,"poured a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. A slow pour led to a one finger white head.  The smell is of sweet malt with citrus in the background. I was a little suprised by this, seemed dark for an ipa.  The taste was a little suprising to me. It was pretty sweet and the hops didn't come through as I would have liked. A good amount of bitterness was there, but it was not the smooth bitterness that I was looking for.  Drys the mouth a bit and doesn't go down smooth. I am a huge fan of IPAs but this one missed the mark for me. I was expecting more from SN",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

It disipates within a couple minutes leaving a thick foam covering both the beer and the sides of the glass. The body is a clear honey color with a good stream of rising bubbles. Lacing is as good as a dry irish stout.  Fresh floral hops, with a little malt. Earthy and wild in the nose.  Surprisingly and strikingly bitter from the beginning of the sip to the end. Wild greens like dandelions or gourmet lettuce. Despite the strong bitter, it is still somewhat balanced.  Mouthfeel is nicely medium. Easily drinkable but it coats the mout nicely.  This would be a hophead's dream, except most hopheads have already discovered this great go-to.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,SWMeyer4141,3.92,"Been drinking these for a while. When I don't want to drive far I just go 1/4 mile down the street to HEB and pick up a 6 pk for 8 bucks.  Appearance-Poured copper with a very small white head that is gone very quickly.  Smell-Great contrast of Pine and Citrus. I know it's only 7.2 ABV but I can get some characteristics of a double. Tropical fruits and citrus. Great aroma  Taste-A little bit mellow for a ""DIPA"" or ""Extra IPA"" Don't get me wrong its great tasting, but not as pungent as most DIPAs i've had. You get some of the citrus upfront and ends in bitter hops. Very good example of an IPA for someone getting into craft beers(one of the first few I tried).  Mouthfeel-Fairly light, with a perfect amount of carbonation. Very drinkable.  Overall-This Is a very good, an affordable beer. I can't tell you how many nights I've just sat around drinking 3 or 4 of these. One of my go to beers.  Next Up..Ruination or Lagunitas Old Gnarlywine...I should probably eat first.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,chicagoabbot,4.05,"12 oz into a snifter...very generous head on top of a slightly brighter body than their pale ale. This is an interesting one, because the abv is a little big for an IPA, but the hop profile is mellow for DIPA. I guess it is exactly what they say, an Extra IPA...a little extra abv, but still an IPA. Duly noted that their are other IPAs in this abv range. The taste is bitter, but decently balanced. Recommended, never going to be one of my very favorites but definitely an enjoyable brew and not badly priced either.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BMoldy,4.03,"A vigorous pour yields a golden peach colored brew with a soft, faint brown, two-finger head. Good retention with a lovely residue down the side. Very fresh hop aroma that alternates between fruity and piney. A little difficult to pick up on other scents, however. When I first took a sip, I thought I'd accidentally opened a bottle of Celebration, for they really are very similar. Unlike Celebration, though, Torpedo derives most of its flavor from a very strong hop presence that really overshadows the grain bill (I thought Celebration was a little more balanced and fuller in body, despite the lower ABV). Still, the bitterness is intense but well short of overpowering. Even more surprising is how refreshing this beer is. Very clean on the finish, with a slight lingering bitterness.  This is sure to please any hop lover, I'll say that. As a rule I've found with IPAs that I have a tendency to over chill them, so don't make the same mistake! It's very easy to lose the different hop flavors in this brew, so better to drink it slightly on the warm side. Now if only my supermarket carried Bigfoot...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,obrike,3.83,"Another good offering from SN, and at $7.50 a sixer, or 13 bucks a 12 pack if you're lucky... a fantastic deal.  Nearly perfect looking beer in a pint glass. Nice copper color and great lacing.  Smells ok. Crushed pine needles in a glass. But something else a bit off putting...not sure what.  A good tasting IPA, but not my favorite. The balance here is a bit off to me. Hoppy as hell, but not as flavorful as Celebration in my opinion. The hop/malt combo seems to be off just a bit.  Pretty darn drinkable, but 3 to 4 of these in a sitting is definitely enough as the alcohol over 7% will certainly do the trick. Still, a very good IPA, especialy for the price.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Looneybiz,4.54,Poured into a pint glass and it comes out a very rich and deep bronze color with a full finger+ head. Leaves rings of lace after each sip.  The aroma makes your mouth water. You can pick out the different hops used and the citrus and pine aroma hits your nose hard. This has been the best smelling beer I've had in a while.  Upon drinking you get the rich full flavor of complex bittersweet hops that stays with you for a while.  Mouthfeel is right just enough carbonation.  Overall its worthy as a special treat beer when you want something to sip on that has full flavor nad a hard hoppy bitterness. Sierra Nevada accomplished what they were after with this one.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ms11781,4.13,"Bottled on 01/05/2011. Reviewed on 01/26/2011. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a clear orangish amber color with a thick, fluffy 2 and half finger head. Head reduces down to about a finger of off white foam that sticks around and leaves great lacing on the glass.  The nose is dominated by piny hops. Some citrus and fruity hops are present but the pine is what really shows through. Not much detected in the way of malt, perhaps a bit of sweet malt, but it is pretty weak.  Just as in the nose, the taste is all about piny, resinous hops. A hint of the fruity hops that were in the nose and a more defined, sweet, malt character are present but they are bookended by pine at the front and in the hugely bitter finish.  Medium body with medium carbonation. Crisp and smooth with a very bitter finish. Resinous hops stick to the tongue long after each sip, drying out the finish a bit.  Drinkability is good. Definitely a beer that could be consumed in multiple pints over a decent amount of time. The bitter finish might eventually make you want to move on the something else but a few of these isn't out of the question.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DrinkingDrake,4.3,Pours out a copper color with a mild red hue. Clear and a thing head that left a solid lace for the entirety of my pint glass.  Upfront in the aroma is a lot of zesty citrus with a good amount of pine resin. As it warms the hop characters that show remind me of some of the botanical aromas that come from a fine gin. Fruity and zesty. A lemon grass and faintly biscuit grain aroma.  A well balanced pine/citrus/sticky hop bitterness is upfront but then balances out well to the middle with some solid juicy fruit and lemongrass grains. A dry medium/heavy astringency that gets heavier as you wait for the next sip.  Slippery on the tongue but a relatively light body the bitterness is mainly in the aftertaste so it goes down very smooth and makes you want another.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,livewire05,4.6,"Appearance: Clear amber color, lots of rising bubbles, thick head, good lacing.  Smell: Very hoppy. A good whiff of pine needles.

140,30420,UTCengOwl,3.68,"Poured from a bottle into a Budweiser signature glass. Bought a sixer of this and this is bottle number five. Gotta love Sierra Nevada's affordability.  The pour is clear and halfway between gold and copper. Decent white head that has good thickness and stays around. Good lacing, too.  The nose is mostly hops. Smells like dank grapefruit pith and maybe some cat piss. Mmmm... Citra. Not the best combination of hops I've ever sniffed.  The taste is a bit richer than the nose. Carried by the bitterness, there's a tropical pineapple flavor that complements the grapefruit. Still a bit off from my preferred flavor, but it keeps things refreshing and drinkable. Not bad, but I'd be a lot happier with some Amarillo hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JerseyKirk,3.82,"A: Pours extremely clear. Redish gold in color. Poured a 2 finger creamy off white head that lasted about 5 minutes. Settled to a nice sized head with mild carbonation is present. Incredible lacing that lasts the whole glass. Gorgeous.  S: Subdued scents of Cascade, Citra Hops, grapefruit, light malt, very slight pine and grassy notes. Not too overly powerful and have to really try to smell all the elements.  T: Very bitter. It hits you right off the bat. The bitterness also is the major element that lingers at the end. The middle is my favorite part of this beer with lots of hop flavors, especially citrusy grapefruit.  M: Very spicy and hoppy which leads to a full bodied brew.  D: Easily could drink a lot more. I like the bitterness of the beer that lingers but the upfront bitterness without more citrus is disappointing for this Extra IPA. The aroma should have been stronger especially with the addition of Citra hops. I would buy again but it's not my favorite IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,claspada,3.77,"Aromas of those beautiful Pacific coast hops; highlighted by floral, citrus, and lighter grapefruit. A little bit of bready maltiness is also detectable. The tastes follow the nose, but reverse. Initially you are introduced to the full bready maltiness but soon after you are welcomed with the greenery. Fruity and grapefruit are in the forefront with lesser amounts of floral and pine flavors as well. Mouthfeel is full and sticky/chewy but finished quite dry as well. Overall this is a great beer, the drinkability isn't the highest because of the higher ABV, which lowers the sessionability, but I'm really nit-picking at this point.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Deep amber in color with a decent amount of carbonation. Lacing left as I drink it down. Smell: I smelled the hops as soon as I poured this into my glass, also smell a hint of carmel sweetness. Taste: I taste the bitter hops first, then a hint of a sweet malts and then a nice crisp, bitter finish. Mouthfeel: Light bodied and can definetly feel the carbonation in this one.

Nicecly balanced for an IPA, aftersate is lingering citrus biterness but not so much as to be overpowering  Mouthfeel: well balanced carbonation, lively enough to activate the floral hops but restrained enough to still allow the malt to show itself  Drinkability: Very pleasant, the aroma alone makes it worth trying.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Duckmancgy,4.97,"Bottle poured into a Laughing Dog pint glass.  My buddy gave me his last bottle of Torpedo with the promise that it would change my life, and he may be right.  Pours a gorgeous golden tawny colour with a nice finger to finger and a half of tan head that is lacy when it starts to dissipate.  Smells nicely floury and slightly citrusy, but also hints of sweetness from the malt.  First taste was surprising, it just may be the most balanced IPA I have ever had. Nicely sweet, bitter, acidic, citrus and piny notes, but nothing overpowering anything else.  Feels excellent on the mouth, nicely carbonated just enough to keep your mouth interested.  For a beer at 7.2% I think its dangerously easy to drink!!! No issue for me to go into a number of these in order.

140,30420,IchabodcraneIpa,4.15,"Poured into a pint glass  The color of this is a nice vibrant copper color that has a nice layer of foam at the top.  The smell of this one was some nice piney hops with a floral note and a dash of seasoning, pepper comes to mind mixed in.  The taste of this is a nice hop attack at first that gives way to a nice peppery pine taste with some definite hop bitterness.  The mouthfeel of this is pretty dry and I find it pretty drinkable and a very good choice for an IPA lover.  Definitely a good hop fix for those hop heads out there and a great choice for a session beer to me.

Its clear and still in my glass, which is pretty interesting.  S- I like the smell. I was expecting a robust aroma, but i seems clean, hoppy and refreshing to the nose. Some pine also in the nose.  T- Wow this is a great brew. Its definatly an EXTRA IPA, and after learning about how they brew this beer, its mainly for hop heads. But the flavor is not to heavy and its surprisingly refreshing. One of my favorite IPA's. The balance in this beer is amazing. FRESH and powerful.  M- Not much carbonation and very smooth on the mouth.  D- I edited my review.

Nose of pine and citrus hops with some bready malt. In the mouth, it's up front nice and crisp, drawing attention to bold piney hops. Bitter middle balanced with some bready malt. Dry, bitter clean finish. Mouthfeel is nicely crisp and carbonated, yet wet and quenching. Drinkability is very good overall.

The aroma had a heavy dose of hops, a light grain malt and a horse blanket yeast scent with a nice citrus note that stood out rather well. It tasted moderately bitter of hops in the beginning and finished with a nice pronounced malty-bitter flavor that had a nice hint of citrus at the end, with the flavor only lasting a short time. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and watery yet dry in texture with a very nice carbonation. Overall a very nice IPA that had a well balanced hop-citrus flavor working for it.

It has pretty nice malty bitterness balance, but not near as good as Celebration. I don't get the fresh hop impression in Torpedo. There is a dirty/earthy pine taste, which I do enjoy as a variety in an IPA. As I drink through this beer, I notice dark fruits that are represented in the smell and taste. The body is mildly heavy, I think I will stick with just one of these. Solid beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,esv,4.06,"A) Nice, thick, creamy head. Off-white. Slightly billowy, about 1/2"" and slowly drops. Leaves thick coating on the sides. Looks sticky. Head really sticks around. Orange mixed with copper. Very natural. Not bright orange. I think this is as good looking as an IPA gets.  S) Piney, resin. Grapefruit citrus. Some earthiness.  T) A slight syrup sweetness followed by a lacerating hop bitterness and grapefruit. Slightly medicinal. Bitterness stays on the tongue. This is a grapefruit beer with just enough maltiness to shine through and makes its presence known. Not at all a dry IPA. For me, this is the maximum maltiness I want in an IPA. Just a hint of cloyingness.  M) Medium mouthfeel. High-end of medium for carbonation.  I think it's a great american IPA.

140,30420,baldben,3.86,"Even with a soft pour, this beer produces a large, fluffy cream-colored head that dissolves slowly leaving puffy lace. The beer is copper and clear. Very inviting.  The nose presents mostly citrus--particularly grapefruit--with additional notes of pine and hint of spice.  The first taste on the palate is the citrus but this quickly gives way to a pleasant bite of spiciness that lingers on in the after taste. The malt is dominated by the hops but makes a brief showing mid-taste. As the beer warms the malt tends to hang around a little longer.  Body is medium with good carbonation. The acidity of the hop spice becomes palpable. Finish is dry.  A beer that is boldly hopped but manages to be easy to drink.

The taste is very balanced. The hop presence is there and strong but not overly done. I was blown away by this, bitter but not overly done. The malts were well balanced with the hops. Bitterness? Yes but perfectly blending with the sweet barley and malts. Amazing how an everyday supermarket beer blew me away like this. Feels light and crisp in the mouth. This is a strange beer, perfect for winter and for summer. I can sip this in front of a fire as well as lakeside. Perfection, lets just say this beer blew my mind.

140,30420,pilotgod,3.98,"Poured from bottle into 20oz tumbler.  A: Pours a nice copper color that is moderately clear and forms a half finger head that does dissolve down to a thin film of white froth that covers the entire glass. Lacing is moderate with good bands being left on the glass after every sip.  S: The aroma is textbook IPA style. The pine presence from the hops dominates with hints of citrus and flowers becoming apparent from time to time. If you seek it out the malt notes can be detected, but you must search for them.  T: Hops dominate (as they should in an IPA or Extra IPA) and give a pronounced bitterness, but this is offset by the citrus flavors that follow. The malt presence is defined by a bready and sweetness that helps cut the hops bitterness a bit.  M: Dry, very dry. But, that is perfectly OK from an IPA. This beer sits well with mild carbonation, respectable ABV (no alcohol can be detected), and the hops bitterness. The dryness is just enough to keep you coming back for more.  D: I enjoyed the beer and will definitely have more. While there are styles that I would prefer to drink more, Sierra Nevada has hit a perfect balance between the higher end IPA's and the affordability of a standard ""six pack"" IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smells very dry with a slight hint of citrus in the background. Very dry flavor to this. Lots of piney hop bitter flavors with a dry grapefruit finish here. Seems a bit on the heavy side.

Floral and pine like, slight graininess as well as a lemon/orange peel aroma. Yep its an IPA  Hop bitterness is very strong, pine and grapefruit flavors coming to mind. The bitterness doesnt last to long as the malt sweetness takes over. The alcohol becomes apparent after the first few sips as the roof of my mouth starts to heat up. The finish is nice as a a big bready malty flavor finishes off the flavors of this beer.  Pretty crisp, refreshing, light in body, pretty drinkable and for the value and availability if this brew its a damn fine beer",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,nsabo,3.33,"The label reads ""Extra IPA,"" but I can't imagine anyone considering this a DIPA. This drinks like an English IPA: hoppy, but not excessively so like so many American takes. I consider pale ales to be a boring style because the balance between hops and malts seems neutral to me; this feels like a hoppier pale ale. The hops are grassy mellow instead of intense bitter, with the malt is never far behind. Many drinkers comment on the ""crispness"" and ""cleanness"" of SN brews, and Torpedo is no exception.  I enjoy IPAs, and with so many microbrews predictably chanting ""more hops!"" in celebration of their next IPA recipe, this is a welcome change of style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The nose was full of citrus, pine, flowers, and bread.  The taste was superb! Rich hoppy flavour--tons of citrus, pine, and even maltyness which mellowed out the intensity of the beer. Excellent brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,IllNate,4.32,"A - Pours a nice light copper with a good hop haze. Loads of nice fluffy white head. Great retention.  S - Great aroma. Light floral with bolder citrus hops and some delicate herbal notes. Malt aroma is just barely perceptable. Wonderfully complex.  T - Big bold hop flavor. Pretty intense for a standard IPA. Citrus/grapefruit hop is very prominent. Bit of herbal hop as well and just alot of straight bitterness. Kinda blows out the palate after several samples.  M - Very bitter and puckering. But very smooth otherwise and a nice well rounded beer.  D - Good for such a bold IPA, but it is a bit overpowering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - Not overly fragrant, slightly sour and hoppy nose  T - Citrus hop bitter finish, not a lot of leafy hop flavor up front. Some bready malt & herbal flavor. Grapefruit bitterness lingers. Dry.  M & D - Smooth, on the creamy side. Good carbonation, not overly crisp. Not sure where the ""Extra"" comes in, other than in ABV. At 7.2%, it's very present after just one.  A decent IPA that I'm guessing is readily available.

140,30420,London1985,4.3,"Brought this beer after seeing numerous beer reviews and having it recommended to me from some friends of mine in the states.  Purchased from Utobeer in Borough market, London. Ive always been fond of Sierra Nevada's beers and they are a regular option of mine when drinking from the good ol' USA.  This was no exception. A very nice and enjoyable IPA. Big on the nose and pallate with the hop explosion you expect from big American IPA's.  Lovely on the nose with hints of spices like cinnamon and even cumin (dont ask lol).  All round this was a very nice and well made beer from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,iRoy,4.51,"Oh, those sweet sweet hops. Great smells, pours a cloudy golden hue. Dig the smell, smells sweet but with a bitter aftertaste. Goes down smooth for a brew with an above average ABV. I dig it, only had 1 bottle but I would definitely try it again.

140,30420,hotzenklotz,4.47,the beer is a really good example of an west coast ipa. The hop aroma is really nice and strong. Let it be noted that it is stronger than average. There is hardly any malt body present on the palate because the hop flavour dominates the taste. The smell is exceptional and straight hop forward. It is a nice beer but not for everyone. Hopheads will love it though!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BeardedRiker,4.12,"I don't remember specifically the last time I drank Sierra Nevada's Torpedo Extra IPA, it must have been long ago, but I do remember that I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It's time I had another try at this beer, though. Sierra Nevada's regular Pale Ale is one of my favorite beers. It's a quality pale ale with plenty of flavor but is very drinkable, though keeping its quality. There's a reason why the beer is very popular. After trying the Torpedo this is another excellent beer from Sierra Nevada (even though I'm not the biggest fan of their more specialty beers :P).  Pouring the Torpedo out I knew right away I would like the beer, even though I had the thought of not liking it in the past. It's barely hazy and has a beautiful color like golden honey. The head pours an off-white that's bubbly-frothy. It fizzes out pretty quickly but there lingers about a centimeter or so of head on top throughout drinking the brew. Torpedo leaves a significant amount of lacing every time I take a gulp.  The aroma is wonderful. It screams of hops, being extremely floral and herbal. If you like hops in your beer then the aroma is like heaven. The expected smell of pine tree comes out too. This might be the quintessential beer if you want to smell HOPS. I wouldn't say it smells a lot of citrus but it's there too. There is some maltiness there to balance it out, as well as a bit of booziness, but that doesn't take away.  How does she taste? Oh, she tastes wonderful. It tastes like a dry-hopped beer but I'm not sure if it is. As with the aroma, hops are prominent but are balanced very well with malts that give it the grain/barely/bready flavor. The hops come out more during the middle of tasting and at the end with a good, clean bitterness that lingers long after the beer has gone down. It's delicious. Pine and citrus flavors bring more flavor throughout tasting and keep the beer balanced. I wouldn't say Torpedo isn't a very complex beer but it is very flavorful with the hops and malts and it tastes great. If you want a hoppy, herbal IPA then this is definitely something to try. The mouthfeel is not heavy and it has mild carbonation.  I have no idea why I think I didn't like Torpedo when I first tried it but I definitely like it now, a lot. If you want it to be more hoppy then drink it colder. Unlike other beers that I think are exceptional because they are very complex and flavorful, Torpedo isn't too complex but has great flavor while being very drinkable. It's like Sierra Nevada's regular Pale Ale but better.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,notalagerlugger,4.28,I love this beer I do not know why I do not drink it more often. It is available at Target for a good price. It has a good hoppy flavor and is similar to Sierra Nevada beers. maybe if was more rare I would long for it more.

140,30420,dstc,4.2,"Pours a slightly cloudy orange-brown color with a very foamy, light tan head. Head is slow to fall. Decent clinging lace.  Aroma is very much of pine with an herbal, hop character. Bit of mild citrus buried in there as well. Smells good.  Taste is similar. Pine taste hits you up front, mostly because you smell it as it hit your palette. Citrus quickly takes over and is very noticeable. Ends with a mild, lingering bitterness from the oily hops.  Medium bodied and a bit oily in the mouthfeel. Rather simple carbonation.  Good stuff and fairly easy to drink. Sierra Nevada sure knows how to brew a beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Tartarus,4.45,"Served in a pint glass  A: Dark, mostly translucent amber color, with about 2 fingers worth of head that stuck around for a little while.  S: Lots of hops and a little bit of malt, I can also smell a bit of the pine in the beer.  T: Hops, lot of delicious hops. I can also get a bit of the pine taste. There is a aftertaste of alcohol after reflecting on the flavor. There is also a bit of a spicy taste partially due to the carbonation, overall VERY tasty.  M: Medium bodied with an acceptable amount of carbonation.  D: This beer is really delicious, I love IPA's and I love this take on that style. I think it's better than the normal Sierra Nevada IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hophopandaway,4.03,"I poured this beer and it looked just as I've come to expect an american IPA to look: amber/ lburnt orange with a bit of chill haze and light carbonation. There was a decent head that maintained fairly well and there was a respectable amount of lacing as the beer went down. The smell wasn't anything amazing but there were some gentle floral, perfume and citrus notes on top of some caramel malt. The taste was much better than the smell and that distinctive US IPA stye was evident. There were definate touches of pine, big grapefruit and a little bit of black pepper. Although the beer is quite bitter and hoppy, the hops still allow a bit of the sweet malt to come through which I like. On the finnish it's quite dry and bitter, leaving you wanting a bit more. Some of the American IPAs seem to just want to have maximum hops and nothing else and I hate that. This beer is nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and the carbonation is what I like: nice and light. As far as drinkability goes you're not gonna be knocking back a load of these because of the strength but it slips down nice, although a bit of sunshine would surely improve the effect. I'd definately buy this again as it is a very good, if not massively outstanding, version of the American IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,100floods,2.87,"Pours a mostly clearly burnt yellow hue with a little haze. Smells of that typical Sierra Nevada ""clean smell"". This is the first time I've had this beer and I'm not smelling a lot of the hops (the pour did finish with no real head to be seen). After a few sip, I can really put my nose into the glass and I smell minimal citrus flavors. I really have to really for not a lot of reward.  After getting over the smell, I tasted the brew and initially I get an opposite experience from the smell. Bit burst of pine tree hops. Still very clean for an IPA. Light, chewy, fruity finish. The malt kind of lingers and creates a lemonade flavor. Nothing in the pint jumps out a you. While there's some hop flavor, the clean aspect of this beer kind of kills any ability to enjoy the true nature of a beer like this. I'm pretty sure I'm drinking a bad batch. I've had better versions of this. I think it's interesting that they'd made a beer like this in the first place. Aside from Big foot, hops aren't their strong points.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,smokeypeat,3.57,"Pours a nice amber shade with some noticeable haze and a white 2 finger head. Lacing remains on the glass until the end. Strong dominant piney/citrusy hop smell. No surprises here, pretty much what should be expected. Taste follows suit, although I found this beer to have a bit more of an oily residue in the mouthfeel than I find in other SN beers. Definitely a safe choice to pick up at the bottle store, in that you might not be blown away, but you certainly won't be disappointed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A- Nice medium amber color with a fluffy white cloud for a head that stays with the beer through most of the glass.  S- Solid mix of strong citrusy hops and strong malts.

M- Well bodied IPA, with a nice dry finish from the bittery hops.  D- Extremely drinkable beer, this beer goes down so smooth and tasty. Pretty inexpensive as well.

Yeah, on the smell you detect a lot of hops. It's very clean and fresh smell though, it smells like it will be very easy to drink, not harsh at all. Hmm, more hop bite than I thought there would be, not as smooth either. The taste isn't bad, just much harsher than I was hoping for, but hey, it's an IPA. It does have that clean feel I was smelling, but the hop bite is for sure more present than I thought.

Fantastic lacing.  S: Lots of pine, with grapefruit and honey tones that follow.  T: Primarily pine hops upfront with grapefruit and a sweet malty (honey-like) quality, and finishes nice and dry. Very well balanced.  M: Moderate carbonation. Again, well balanced when it comes to the viscosity. Bitter finish lingers in the mouth a little (but not a bad thing in this case).  D: Very drinkable.

S: Citrus, perhaps mango , and a hint of pine.  T: This is very well balanced, the hops want to dominate, and the malts keep them in check. It is not as musty as other beers of this style.  M: This is a dry beer, with only mild carbonation.  D: Sierra Nevada Torpedo weighs in at 7.2, and it does not do anything to lighten its impact. It is Very well balanced, and a nice way to open an evening. I would not likely have more than 2 glasses in a session.

140,30420,Phillie,4.35,Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint glass.  Initially a large frothy head erupted but did not stay long. Lacing is quite apparent - a colour I would relate to pearl. This beverage is a beautiful amber colour bordering on an apple cider look.  The smell is certainly of pine needles and fresh lemon grass. I detect an undertone of malt that brings this IPA back down to Earth. Odour is pleasant and not overpowering.  Taste is dominated by the evergreens and is very refreshing.  A very smooth feeling around the mouth and not too bitter.  This is a great IPA by Sierra Nevada. Highly recommend to anyone who loves an IPA/Double IPA.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I used to enjoy the ""hop bombs"" and now I have a true appreciation for a well balanced IPA. THis nails it. Slight booze in the background.  T: Again, just really well done here. The hops are perfectly interwoven with the malt. Neither overpowers the other. I can say that I am desiring something that really catchs my attention here in terms of flavor and not getting it, but the attention to detail is great.  M: Big time carbonation. Fills the mouth and coats it in a spicy, sweet liquid. Spicy up front, sweet in the back.  D: This is a very nicely done beer.

Nice and piney with a floral background.  T - Resiny but with a strong caramel character to balance it out. More robust than I expected. Nice and balanced.  M - Not too viscous but not thin. Good full body to it.  D - Goes well with a meal of seafood pasta. I could drink the whole six pack.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Somewhat creamy and the bitterness from the finish clings to your mouth.  D- Pretty good beer, couldnt drink a lot of these in one night due to a strong aftertaste.

140,30420,Aiptasia,4.28,"Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA is an excellent, well crafted beer. I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this beer at first glance. I'd purchased one for a tasting prior to Superbowl 45 (Go Packers) to go with our usual home party fare of chicken wings, bean dip, and good beer.  Let me tell you, at first taste, you know you are drinking something really good. It's a bold IPA, as the label suggests. It's right up front and assertive with great florals piney bite and a hopsy finish. You will taste this one from the first sip to the last drop, but it isn't quite as overpowering as others have suggested. After having sampled a few Belgian style White beers prior to this one, it was nice to taste an unabashedly forward beer on the pallete.  A: Golden amber in color. Has a decent, lingring head that doesn't retreat.  S: In your face with hops pine and floral scents.  T: Delicious, nice bite up front and a slight linger from the pine notes. Otherwise dry and meaty.  M: Not overly gassy, good amount of carbonation. Bitter finish fades slowly.  D: Definitely drinkable. You'd want to pair it with bold foods that can handle the hops.

Leaves beautiful lacing down the glass  S: Smells of deep piney and syrupy. A touch of sweetness from the malt.  T: uhhhh. not my type. But it smelled so good!!! Harsh and overpowering malt taste with a harsh bitterness of hop. I've never liked Sierra Nevada in taste and this follows the trend. Maybe it's the yeast... Sigh. OK I get a strong citrus before the hard hitting malt that I find borderline aversive.  M: This is really bad mouthfeel. It feels like it stings. Not an alcoholy sting, but almost a bubbly sting. Yet it doesn't appear over-carbonated. Leave a stringent taste in my mouth after each sip. Does not make me want more...  D: There really is no drinkability. I keep putting it back because I am trying to find what everyone is raving about. American IPA is my favorite style and I can drink most all day all night. But this is terrible.  Altogether I think the beer looks and smells terrific. It's a great picture beer to hold in your hand and smell while at a social gathering. I would not recommend sipping the beer though.

Surprisingly well-balanced with a decent sweet caramel malt aroma in support of the hops. Yeasty esters are present, but hard to separate from the citrusy hops.  The flavor is hop-forward, but balanced like the aroma. Hop bitterness and flavor hit first, and finish last with a long, dry, lingering bitterness. There is a solid supporting malt backbone that stands up to the hops. Sweet and caramelly, with a lightly toasted character. The hops are complex, with a nice blend of citrus and pine.

140,30420,BigHeavy,4.37,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a New Belgium globe. Beer was consumed immediately after pouring and enjoyed while listening to Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds at Radio City.  A: Beer pours a very clear orangeish red color. An egg shell colored and pillowy head one finger in height forms atop the beer. There is some pretty intense bubbling in my glass and beautiful lacing clings to the glass all the way down.  S: Aroma is oil hops, all the way. Citrus, pine, and grassy aromas erupt from the glass in a volcano of scents. There are some bready malts trying to stick their neck out as well. Torpedo smells a little tart at times, too.  T: Intense hop bitterness slams into the taste buds and does not relent for a few seconds. Once that subsides, it's like biting into a grapefruit for a moment. Just a smidge of a white bread malt presence there to balance it a smidge, but not too much. This baby is all hops, and I love it. Hop bitterness lingers forever.  M: Mouthfeel is oily like every other Sierra Nevada IPA I have ever had. Flavors cling to the inside of your mouth like dog hair to a fleece jacket. Carbonation is crisp and refreshing.  D: Drinkability is high for a beer of 7.2% ABV. Hop bitterness detracts a little bit, as the flavors can overwhelm the palate after a beer or two.  O: Talk about a great way to get a hop fix. Full of fresh hop flavors, a hop heads dream, and only $8 a six pack to boot. Shares some qualities with other great Sierra Nevada IPAs.

S: Bright herbaceous hops display an herbal spiciness bordering on peppery. Fruity esters are present, as is faint butterscotch, amidst a backbone of lightly toasted grain.  T: Begins off-dry and clean, with faint toast and slowly building grassy/piney hop aromatics into the middle. Malt takes on some caramel quality, becoming complex and slightly spirituous, while bitterness reaches its moderate peak. It finishes as it started, clean and herbaceous, with greater dryness.  M: Thin to medium viscosity, slightly sticky on the palate, with moderate carbonation.  D: Torpedo puts its identity as a Sierra Nevada ale before any identity it may have as a West Coast IPA. The result is a bright and clean tasting IPA with all kinds of vegetative complexity and all-but-lacking the ubiquitous presence of grapefruit citrus. While the flavor remains strong, the smell could benefit from some more citrus influence--or something, to add intensity.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Beertinez,4.53,"12oz bottled poured into a pint glass. Pours a copper color with some cloudyness. Fluffy, white, 2-3 head. Looks mouth watering. The head eventually disappears into very thin sheet of white.  Aroma is very citrusy. Especially a good amount of orange. Hints of floral aromas in there too.  Taste is great. Subtle sweetness to hold up the hop character. Citrus and floral notes. Getting some of that orange that was present on the nose in the middle. Finishes with some great tasting hops. The floral notes make their return.  Medium body and crisp. Extrememly satisfying and drinkable. I can definitely see myself getting some more of this brew.  Overall, an excellent brew! A textbook American IPA from Sierra Nevada. Highly recommended",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BeerBuckeye,4.2,"A - Peers a deep golden amber, solid two finger creamy head, plenty of carbonation rising up from the bottom in almost a vortex style. Leaves a good amount of lacing.  S - Nice pine aroma, a bit of fruityness in there. I don't deeply smell that much citrusy, but it just brings a little sweetness to the nose. Smells good and earthy.  T - Just a very full taste. On the first drink, I taste an abundance of those whole-cone hops. Quite piney, again, that citrusy fruit I feel is hidden deep within the taste just to balance out the bitterness of those hops. There's a ton of flavor in this.  M - Very thick mouthfeel. A good amount of carbonation in this one. After taste leaves the mouth somewhat dry with just a bit of stickiness.  D - Remarkably drinkable. Alcohol is hidden well and this goes down very smooth for the amount of hops and fullness.  Overall - Sierra Nevada knows IPAs, and this is no different. Just a very full beer. This may be my new 'go-to' IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - A very nice blast of citrus hops and a touch of sweet malt as well.  T - Initial rush of hoppy goodness that transitions into a pleasant blend of the citrus hops and crystal malts. Has a medium bitterness but is well balenced with a sweet fruity malt as well  M - Significantly more carbonation than I expected but very pleasant and refreshing. Crisp and very enjoyable.  D - Very drinkable, could have drank several. The alcohol is barely noticable even in the final few sips. The bitterness and sweetness blend well though I prefer a more bold IPA in general. Still good.  Overall a very good beer but nothing truly outstanding.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CuriousMonk,4,"Poured a clear, ruddy copper with a mostly lasting and easily regenerative rocky two finger off-white head, leaving some bubbles & thickness on the sides of the glass. Lime, pine, grapefruit hops and caramel/toffee malt aromas. Grapefruit & pine bitter hop flavours with a lovely strawberry, peachy sweetness in the back. The finish isn't too lingering or harsh, nicely rounded with just a bit of clinging peppery bite. Some brightness from the carbonation keeps the mouthfeel fresh on a medium body.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BudWizeMan,4,"A- Nice medium dark copper hue with nice creamy head  S- Piney,resiny herbal hop aromas  T- On par with aroma,pine ,resin herbal character,citrus and caramel malts present yet subtle  M - Good yet ever so slightly less than rounded,drying on the palate  D- High, despite slightly warming alcohol,goes down easy  This my third revisit to Torpedo or so.Although never wowed by this offering it is always enjoyable. As an IPA Drinker I cannot deny this being a fine example of the style.Personably a preference for a citrusier,fruitier hop profile I do have yet Torpedo makes it easy to like a hop character different from my ideal favorite.

140,30420,ptykozoon,4.08,"Beautiful caramel. Lots of bubbles, sticky lacing, lasting beige head.  Sweet caramel, sugar hops, orange peel, lemon lime. Some dry oaky scents.  Aforementioned hops along with dense honey, citrus and dry bitterness.  The remarkable smoothness of the beer contrasts with the dry bitter hops and carbonation. Long, sticky sweet finish.  Not as hop intensive as the SNPA, but this beer does not disappoint hop cravings.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CaptDavyJones,4.3,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle, with ABV on the label. Dark copper color with a nice one finger foamy head that dissipated fairly quickly. Aroma is all out hops, hops and more hops. Some hints of pine in the aroma but dominated by hops. Taste is high on hops, but perfectly balanced with malts. Some might call it over the top, but in my opinion it is very well balanced. If there is one brewery that knows how to use hops the best, it is Sierra Nevada. Very good lacing along the insides of the glass. Crisp and refreshing IPA coats the palate nicely. Drinkability is VERY good. This is one IPA that I can have anytime, anyplace. Very highly recommended. This is a hop-heads delight.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,ehammond1,3.88,"Bottle (2010)  Holiday Wine Cellar Escondido, CA  I always find Sierra Nevada's beers to be beautiful, and this one is no slouch. The beer is a glowing amber and orange with a thick creamy tan head. The lace on the side of the glass is sticky and thick. The head isn't going anywhere.  The nose is full of pine and a bit of citrus. As I smell it more, I find much more pine then I do citrus fruit. Not overly sweet or candied; smells like a Christmas forest.  Bitter taste with a finish of pine and resin. A slight floral taste but a very well-balanced IPA. Nothing particularly outstanding or new here, which is to say, a bit disappointing after the beer's near-perfect appearance and aroma.  Perfect ""Sierra-Nevada-mouthfeel,"" which in my mind could be added to the beer lexicon. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. The mouthfeel simply sings ""Purest Ingredients"" and ""Finest Quality.""  A very drinkable and well-balanced IPA. This is not a typical West Coast uber-hoppy and fruity IPA, but an artfully crafted, well-balanced IPA with a strong malt backbone.  A high quality product from a high quality brewer. Nothing groundbreaking or brand new, but an excellent product.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,lnashsig,4.27,"I'll start with saying I am incredibly impressed with SN for this great IPA. Its impressive that they still really have the focus and high quality production as large as they are. On to the review:  Poured into my Dfh snifter, pours a dark orange color, with nice head that filled to the top of my glass and then receded, leaving nice lacing on the glass. Smell: nice citrus, pine, and maple syrup. Taste: nice bitter hops, and sweet malty balanced presence. This is just a really well balanced IPA.

140,30420,boyfromthenorth,3,"Loved this beer when it came out and sooo cheap compared to other IPAs. Then , the more I tasted other IPAs and came back to Torpedo, it just tasted too slick.

As it warmed this became more pronounced.  Taste: Initial sweetness followed by what might be pine, quickly giving way to a massive eruption of hop bitterness (and some citrus notes) along that dominates and lingers at the back of your mouth for several minutes  Mouthfeel: Medium body, medium carbonation, just right for this type of beer.  Drinkability: Just... wow. I am one for citrus and heavy doses of hops and this IPA delivers by the truckload. A massive kick of bitterness but not unpleasant. I plan to buy tons of this before it disappears from the local specialist.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The smell is mostly pine and a little citrus. Great aroma.  Tastes are mostly of pine with some citrus. Slightly bitter but not overly hoppy since it is balanced with some sweetness.

A: Bright orange with golden highlights, strong carbonation bubbles rising, murky with a thick finger tan head. This is more impressive than I thought it would be.  S: Strong pine hops, some citrus notes of orange and a light biscuit malt to the nose.  T: Pine is overpowering any of the citrus. Bitterness is quick and lasting. A little warming loosens this one up, and some more grass flavors come through. Balances out as well with time.  M: Medium bodied, with plenty of tingle. Nice slick mouth coating.  D: At $8.49 a sixer year around, this ain't a bad go-to IPA. Competes well with SweetWater IPA, which finds itself in the same price bracket.

Wonderfully balanced-- solid caramel toasty malt backbone that supports the piney, floral hop bitterness. Finishes with a bit of lingering pine but not overly bitter. Medium body and modest carbonation create a rich and creamy mouthfeel. I'm thoroughly enjoying this beer. It provides a ton of hop flavour without being one-dimensional/overly bitter. I'd gladly/easily knock back a few of these in a row.  For 7.99 a sixer, this puts any Ontario craft beer (which start at around $11-12), let alone IPA to shame.

140,30420,Satchboogie,4.15,"12 oz bottle poured into a Duvel glass  A: Pours a golden copper, 1.5 finger offwhite frothy head that dissipates over a couple minutes. Leaves a ton of lacing.  S: Citrus hops (tangerine, grapefruit, lemon peel), tons of pine, sweet grainy malt  T: I get a whole bunch of mellow fruit that blends into one complex, deep, and rich juicy flavor. Most noticeable fruit is grapefruit. There's a ton of pine bashing the palate with bitterness, it comes fiercely out of the background to almost overpower the fruit flavors. Malt character is fairly light and is just toasted a bit, a clean 'golden' flavor, not as grainy as I thought it would be. Alcohol is a little peppery in the middle and finish. Finish is bitter, resiny, pine, and grapefruit. I feel that the malt character is almost perfect in this, just sweet enough to add juiciness and make the pine bitterness bearable, but it doesn't steal the show.  M: Low Carbonation, medium body, very juicy. Chewy, sticky, resiny. Could be a little smoother with just a bit more carbonation.  D: I might have consumed this in record time, this might very well be my second favorite IPA to date. It's that good.

Agitation produces small and quickly diminishing head. Lacing is moderate but only when the beer is agitated to produce a larger head.  Smell: Hops up front for sure. Pineapple being the primary note with subtle and somewhat sweet grapefruit coming in behind.  Taste: Plenty of hop flavor without being overly bitter. Pineapple and grapefruit again, that die slowly as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: Light and airy with nice carbonation. Ends dry and with just a hint of stickiness.  Drinkability: Wonderful beer.

T: Hops, obviously, and I could go on all day about that because that's the point of this beer. But behind the high hoppiness, there's a great beer, in fact complimented by the hops. Citrus and good hop flavors envelop the mouth. and create one of my go-to beers.  M: Perfect carbonation levels that lets the flavors dance on your mouth and still finish smooth.

This is overall a really good beer i have had it before but never really rated it so nows the time. The appearance is overall quite well. brings a nice dark orange color not really on the copper side. But it didn't really have a nice strong smell to it like i think it should have like a lot of other IPA's.  The TM&D all go against what i have said about the smell of the brew. For not having much of a smell you get a lot in flavor. Right away i'm hit with hops and heavy piney taste. A little bit of citrus but a nice dose of piney hops. Great. Also a nice consistency.

140,30420,airheadmtrcycle,4.03,"It's really amazing that you can get a beer like this almost anywhere in the US. I think folks take SN beers for granted; their pale ale and this, their IPA, are really solid beers available anytime of year and almost anywhere.  Poured a 2 finger head in a Sierra Nevada pint glass. Lots of thick lacing is left behind as the foam recedes and warms. The beer is a hazy, but brilliant orange.  One sniff and you know this beer is about hops. Tastes are pine-y and bitter hops. Not quite as tasty as Bell's Two Hearted Ale or their own Celebration Ale, but it makes up for it in mouth-puckering bitterness that lingers on the back of your tongue. The malts balance this IPA pretty well on the front of the tongue, but there's no doubt what the brewers at Sierra Nevada were going for. The mouth feel is solid, medium and crispy.  If you're a hop head, you have to try this beer. If you think that American IPAs have too many hops and are unbalanced, this may not be your type of beer.

140,30420,NegativeSpin,4.6,"I've been drinking this beer on and off for a few months now, and can't stop coming back to it. It seems like many of the smaller mini-marts around town have been carrying it along with the Pale Ale (also quite good... but not as good), and it's by far my first choice amongst the usual suspects.  Appearance: I poured some out of a 32oz. bottle into a 16oz. glass about 5 minutes ago, and there is still a healthy, .5 inch head of what appear to be nitrogen bubbles floating on top. The beer itself is a deep amber.  Smell: Hoppy as hell... they spared no expense.  Taste: Matches the smell... intense hoppiness (is that a word? It is now), but not so bitter. The higher-than-average alcohol content is difficult to detect until after it hits your bloodstream.  Feel: Thick and satisfying... even halfway finished with my 16oz glass that I poured, there is still a bit of foam at the top of every sip and it is enjoyable.  Drinkability: There's a reason why you buy these in 32oz. glasses... they were meant to be consumed in that manner, although I doubt that I'd be ready for another after having one, as I'd usually accompany it with some Macallan 12 and would lose interest in beer by then.

140,30420,unclejimbay,5,"1/2/2010 Educated Update... I flounder once again to decide this is still a very enjoyable IPA but notably a bold piney hopped version. Easily accessible, always a good price, notably bitter, and a well hidden abv. I have decided this is a more pine forward IPA example, especially after brewing a few more citrus oriented homebrewed IPAs at home.  2/9/2010 Okay it's official and my palate is changing, either I am less sesitive to pine, or I have just sold out to Sierra. I officially declare Torpedo to have much more hop citrus aroma and taste than my newb palate could initially handle. I have come around to enjoy Torpedo as my go to hop fix @ 6.99 a six pack. I have found it to have similiar taste as SNPA, but just a bit more body, abv, hops and malt sweetness. Overall I love it, and I would edit my review to now claim it's equally citrus as it is pine on the hop profile. In short, the most accesible, best priced, consistent , and always available IPA in my area. $6.99 on sale, $8.99 most other days. A showcase IPA from a flagship American brewer, hat's off the Sierra for a welcomed suprise new offering.  original 7/16/09 review; A soild 4.5 across all catergories. Almost a DIPA if you will. This one is a bit to piney for my hop preference, otherwise I would have given it a 5 on taste and drinkability. Regardless... this is a fine example of an extremly intense palate scraper by the talented SN Team!  A 4.5 with a good 2 finger head, excellent head retention, orange/copper/amber in color with a smei hazy clarity. S 4.5 Bold aroma with hop dominant profile. Some citrus is present but overwhelmed by the 100 decibel pine notes! This one screams pine notes, it's a forest of an extreme compostion of an intensely pine-sapped symphony... T 4.5 Solid malt backbone is bulldozed by the same momentum of hop aroma... Omptimus Pine duels with some Superior Citrus in this show... which may be exiciting if you like this type of outcome... I mostly prefer citrus to win the duel and prefer pine mostly in my floor cleaners, but this battle is worth showing up to... MF 4.5 Medium body, high carbo...

140,30420,JednoPivoProsim,4.18,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Per the neck label, I'm ready for the whole-cone American hop experience!  Appearance: This has a great bready head. Nothing looks better on a beer than big pockets of thick dough. This one almost bubbled over onto my laptop, have to be more careful. Amber/golden hue.  Smell: The aroma isn't as hoppy as I would have expected. I feel like I smell a hint of alcohol, but maybe that's the advertised ABV playing tricks on me.  Taste: This is surprising. After reviewing DFH 60 Minute last night, I was expecting (perhaps, hoping for) an even hoppier Torpedo experience. Not so. In fact, this is much more balanced than expected.  Mouthfeel: This is nice, just the consistency I prefer in a good beer. Right balance of carbonation and moderate aftertaste.  Drinkability: I see no problem here, whatsoever.

140,30420,TCHopCraver,4.25,"Reviewed from notes written on 1/9/11.  Torpedo appears a clear orange-gold into a standard pint glass. A fluffy, two finger head of the lightest khaki recedes to leave a frothy, full-covering film. Sparse, medium-paced carbonation bubbles drift upward. The lacing is nicely clumpy and splotchy.  The bouquet contains lots of citrus upfront. Aromas of fresh orange and lemon-lime are countrered by biscuit, sourdough, and just enough of a sweet caramel malt balance. Piney and floral hop scents are released when I swirl the beer, along with a bitter citrus rind component.  The taste is similar to the smell and is quite yummy. Toms of orange and lemon abound at the top of the sip, followed by a full caramel sweetness, and finished off by a resinous, piney hop dryness.  The mouthfeel is quite good. A light to medium body complements just the appropriate amount of sweetness, tartness, and bitterness. Excellent carbonation contributes to produce the prototypical feel for an IPA.  This is a solid, hoppy West Coast IPA. I could throw it into the IPA rotation and be perfectly happy with it's place.

The smell is definitely of the piney hops, at a very reasonable level. Taste is also all hops, but the flavor lasts a few seconds and then seems to disappear quickly. There is no lasting aftertaste. I could certainly have one or two of these in the future. This was a January Selection in our BOTM club.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,PhageLab,4.3,"Poured into a weizen glass.  A - Clear reddish coloration with a deep orange hue. Large fluffy head with good retention and some nice, thick lacing.  S - Big floral hop aroma with something else behind it, sweet, reminds me of caramel.  T - Big hop bite. Mostly flowery. Bitter as an IPA can be, and I like it.  M - Crisp and clean feel, with a mildly dry finish. A bit of the bitterness lingers on the palate. Carbonation was mild.  D - Very very enjoyable. Excellent IPA, especially at the price point. I'm definitely going to have to get another sixer. Reco for sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,prdstmnky,4,"Bottled on date: 12/2/10  I haven't had a Torpedo in a while, so figured I would grab one in a mixed 6er. Pours with a very clear, light copper body and a finger of light tan head leaving lots of sticky lacing on my pint glass. Not the most aromatic IPA, but still pick up plenty of piney / grapefruit hops in the nose. Citrus hops upfront in the taste is balanced out with a malt balance in the middle, eventually giving way to an herbal / piney bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied, dry, and maybe a slightly below average level of carbonation for the style.  A nice IPA, I still think I like Celebration a bit more but I'll never complain about some fresh Torpedo's in my fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Erish,4.09,"Reviewed from notes. I poured this bottle into a large wine glass.  A: honey color, orange-white head falls quickly, decent cap and good lacing.  S: orange, grapefruit, grass, pine, and a healthy dose of sweet malt.  T: loads of citrus up front, grassy/floral/citrus hops in the middle, the long finish is bitingly bitter with plenty of grass and pine. Like many super-hopped IPAs, I think this one would have shown better when it was fresh enough to still spank!  M: medium bodied, creamy to oily, moderate to light carbonation, finish is mineral-like.  D: a very tasty IPA, and one I would love to try fresh on tap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: A deep hops flavor from front to back, get a hint of the citrus in the from and pine at the end.  M: Leaves my mouth feeling dry, but goes down good.  D: Probably wouldn't buy this all the time but it's a pretty good beer",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,rembrant,4.27,"Well,most everyone has had Torpdo and his older brother SNPA so I'll keep this basic  Shows some lace and film,moderate head, Light brown a little darker than SNPA  Smells...Hops. A bit more citric than SNPA with a little more hint of malt in the nose.  Flavor More early sweetness and caramel in the start,more backbone than SNPA. Has that SNPA pinecone but with a grapefruit and tangerine citrus too. Basically,a solid IPA though no bitterness champ. The balance is good yet this has that crisp refreshing brighness like SNPA or Celebration thee's a subtle complexity if you chew a mouthfull,and that's often not in some IPA's.  This is not radically unlike a lot of good IPA's yet it earned it's status as a classic. Mouth is about right for the tipe. Wet,but with some body and sparkle.  Drinkable,Of course,Sierra knows drinkable. It's wide availability and good price make it drinkable when those factors matter...and sometimes they matter a lot.  ABV is more than SNPA,so if you have a keg party there's some limit to hw many glasses you'd quaff without incident. For 7%+,however,this is as sessionish as they get.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,tburus,4.17,"Poured into a Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Transparent caramel-colored liquid with a moderate amount of swift moving carbonation. Foamy, two-fingered, off-white head that slowly bubbled down.  Smell: Strong grapefruit aroma with a hint of pine underneath. Very refreshing!  Taste: Hint of the fruitiness found in the smell when it first hits the tongue, followed by a large (but not overpowering) hoppy bitterness. Carbonation borders on too much, though it's presence seems to wash away the hoppy bitterness before it becomes disgusting, which in my opinion is a good thing.  Mouthfeel: Bitterness on the tongue, but there is a lingering presence of grapefruit and yeast/malt (?) as well.  Drinkability: As IPA's go, I find this one to be very drinkable. The hopped up element is not overpowering, which makes it accessible to those who prefer stouts or sweeter beers, and the ABV and price are very reasonable. Most IPA's are a once-in-a-while drink to me, but I can see making Torpedo more of a regular in my cabinet.  Drinkability:",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Lucklys,4.06,"I left the beer out a few minutes before I poured it to keep it from any potential chill haze, and because I'm trying to warm up (see what I did there?) to the whole drinking beer at a more ""professional"" temperature rather than straight from the icy depths of my ridiculously well-insulated fridge. I have found that drinking a cool beer versus a cold beer really makes a difference in everything from which aromas are stronger in the nose to which flavors are more obvious on my tongue and even to how the mouthfeel is affected. It's very interesting scientific stuff, so I'll just stick to the basics.  Poured into my nonick (I can't help but read that as ""no neck,"" which makes no sense) it glowed a sweet potato/pumpkin pie orange with brown sugar shadows. The liquid was mostly clear with a faint bit of a slow, translucent haze that was suspended just above the bottom of the glass to just below the soapy head. Oh the head, let's talk about it for a minute: gorgeously fluffy and a creamy pearl color that looked just divine floating above the amber liquid, much like a heaping dollop of home-made whipped cream sitting atop a fresh-from-the-oven pumpkin pie. Thanksgiving is only 10 months away folks, can't be too prepared! When I first poured it, the foam reached a good 5-finger thickness before gradually melting into 3 and holding with fantastic retention for a long while before fading into thick patches of sticky lacing that left the glass dirty. It's like a love poem of lace.  The nose was a lot lighter than I initially anticipated, as with many IPAs it's pretty obvious what you're smelling right from the first whiff, but with the Torpedo, it was way more mild and didn't threaten to burn my nose with bitterness. Grapefruit rind and lemon zest were at the front line, closely followed by an odd creamy tangerine, which I definitely wasn't sure of. There were plenty of herbal hops, including some faint pine needles, but an obvious light crystal malt kept the whole encounter sweet and even added a welcome touch of caramel to the scent.  Finally in my mouth after furious note-taking, I was genuinely surprised by the first flavor to hit my tongue. Lightly toasted malts strolled across my taste buds with grapefruit pith on one arm, herbal piney notes on the other, and a light lemon zest trailing closely behind. It's still a little hard for me to believe that the malts were so prevalent and the hops hardly held a bitter knife to my mouth. Carrying a medium body with nice, rounded carbonation made it creamier and heavier than it appeared, but I would much rather have a beer that holds some weight than have one that's watery and thin. There was a short lingering hoppy bitterness and light caramel sweetness right at the end, but the bitter throughout the beer was actually relatively mellow, making it really easy to drink. I would probably recommend this IPA to someone who's not sure if they like IPAs or not and needs something to ease them into it. It was a very good beer, one that I will most likely pick up in the future as a filler for a day I'm not reviewing or if I'm out and want something simple to start the evening.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,guinnessnyc,4.47,"While I'd had it before, I grabbed it again this week to revisit Sierra's bigger IPA and it really is an impressive brew.  Poured directly into a SA Perfect Pint Glass resulting in a healthy head. Nice nose with a nice round aroma of floral hops. The taste wasn't overly bitter, but still present enough to have the bite I'm expecting in a big American IPA. The aftertaste was awfully clean for the style and it left me wanting another. Drinks really well...  I'll be grabbing six packs of this again and again through the winter to ensure there's always a few stragglers hanging somewher in my fridge. Nice work Sierra!  cheers -- BC",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hopshopshops,4.95,"My first review.  I'm not one to try explain a beer with an abundance of flowery terms. I read so many here with explanations that sound so similar but, to my taste, the results are far different. Since preference is IPA or DIPA, more the former, I judge according to these brews. Since the difference in IPA's is rarely subtle, my explanations will reflect the real distinguishing characteristics of each--to my taste buds anyway.  A mediocre IPA annihilates most others so understand this point of reference. More to my background, my daily beer evolved from SN Pale Ale to Lagunitas IPA to this beer.  Yes, this is my regular beer of choice. When I go out, I look for something different, but I'm sure as most here already know, there are only so many choices for IPA and I end up with one of these or I revert back to Lagunitas or a good ol' Pale Ale.  Ok. Get to the point. This is the third IPA from SN that I've tried. I had their original India Pale Ale on draft, and of course, the Celebration Ale (which is a quite different taste).  This one just about nails it. It has a nice malt/sweetness to just about perfectly balance the hops. No, skip the just-about part. The initial taste is a malt sweetness, followed rapidly by the hop bitter/tartness, followed by the carbonation bite. This bite is the only negative to the beer, albeit a very minor one. The alcohol taste is nicely masked as well.  One last point that should not be discounted. I find this beer to be somewhat inconsistent. Sometimes the bite and alcohol are too up front, too dominant and the wonderful subtle balance of hops and malt is masked. But a good one is hard to beat.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: An appetizing floral bouquet of pine and citrus bursting with a sugary undertone.  M/T: A mellow malt and lightly bitter upfront welcome snaps into a juicy, robust hop garden center before ending with a dry resinous pine hop flavored finish. This displays a well rounded feel on the palate throughout.  D: This paired very well with a sweet sausage and hot pepper grinder. Even on its own though, I'd call Torpedo the perfect treat for a hophead's evening.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Radome,3.85,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  A - Cloudy, deep golden color. Off white head is thick, creamy, and long-lasting and leaves lots of lacing.  S - Great fresh, piney hop aroma. There is lots of grapefruit as well. No malt or alcohol can break through the blanket of hops aroma.  T - The taste is dominated by sharp hops bitterness and flavor, but there is some malt sweetness in mid-palate that balances. Alcohol is not evident.  M - The body is medium to thick. There is an astringent feel from all the hops bitterness, but there's enough mouth coating sensation from the malt to offset it.  D - The thick mouthfeel hurts the drinkability some. Overall, this is a very good fresh-hop IPA, but it does not have enough malt and alcohol character to make me think of a Double or Imperial IPA. Maybe that's why the label says ""Extra IPA.""

140,30420,laituegonflable,3.46,"Pours a burnished golden colour with very light haze. Head is lovely but modest-ish, dense and cratered on top. Bead is very slow, but steady, and lace is pretty wonderful. That's a nice-looking beer. Not mind-blowing, but the 'little beer that could'.  Nose is a bit weak. Need to really whiff to get anything off that. Hints of royal funk with cardboard and metallic characters, some honey sweetness and a hint of fresh berries and underripe granny smith. Decent, really could use more though, it's just a bit lacking.  Taste is far more IPA-esque. Quite rich with bitterness prevailing throughout palate. Quite funky at times with oaky notes and a musty forest kind of character. Some rusty metallic notes and a hit of nuttiness, but more nutshell than the flesh itself. Leaves very dry with a nice silky touch to the texture overall. The main issue is that there's no profile, it's kind of flat and needs more peaks and troughs. Find it a bit dull, and it really does leave very dry.  A bit bland yet very bitter.

140,30420,lacqueredmouse,4.1,"Pours a clear but deep coloured amber, with an excessively good froth of off-white foam on top. Surprisingly, it doesn't leave a lot of lacing, but it does have a good body, and the bubbles in the body swirl around in its thickness. It's a pretty lovely looking American IPA all up.  Nose is alternately sweet and bitingly pungent. On one sniff, it's tropical and fruity liked tinned pineapple, and on the next, the apple drops out, leaving the sharp and fragrant aroma of pine - resiny and needle-y. Not as full bodied and overpoweringly robust as some of the best, but it's pretty nice.  Taste is also good, although it definitely shears towards the pungent robustness of pine, giving a straight and direct vector of hop bitterness slicing through the centre of the palate. Finish is slightly nutty, with a touch of peach and a very light hint of phenol. In some ways, apart from the pineapple on the nose, it reminds me of an East Coast IPA - the clean body, the sharp, almost herbal hop bitterness. Feel is smooth from the extra body, and is untroubled by whatever carbonation is present in the visuals.  A tasty brew no doubt, from a brewery renowned for doing tasty brews.

Upon closer inspection, it is a very rich floral and hoppy smell, like other IPAs I've tried but more inviting. First sip; hops and more hops. I have mostly stuck to 'smoother' IPAs recently and this one is definitely anything but. After my initial shock, it develops a bit more complexity. Still hops most prominent in the mix, but also pine and maybe a little citrusy sweetness at the end. I feel the bitterness is overwhelming in this beer. Maybe it's just not my style but I think there are a number of others in the style I would reach for first.

S: Smells a lot like Sierra Pale, but with a good amount of piney hop in the mix that is floral and earthy.  T: On point with the nose, real nice hop characteristics - floral earthy resins and a nice grapefruit bight that is very well balanced with tasty malts and that distinct Sierra Pale flavor that is on point and more consistent than most. Someone mentioned that the flavor ""reminds them of Sierra Pale on steroids"" and I have to agree. All the goodness of Sierra Pale with an extreme hop injection - love it!  M: Solid medium-bodied ale that is sticky yet smooth, with good carbonation and a nice bitter mouthfeel from the hop.  D: All night drinker, especially for an IPA at nearly 7.5%.

I'll be rating this beer to style however which will subtract points. On tap and in bottles:  Appearance - Copper, and a nice 1 inch head from a semi-aggressive pour and the lacing sticks to the glass no different from SNPA  Smell - Subdued for a WC IPA. When you have Racer 5, Pliny, Blind Pig, Sculpin etc... as competitors I say yes! It's very subdued. Like a bigger stickier SNPA.  Taste - Good. Not great. Citris and sticky pine. Mainly a bigger stickier and hoppier SNPA. Best way to describe is SNPA on steriods. A bit above average for a IPA but there are SO many tastier and grapefuitier offerings when it comes to WC IPAs out there.  Mouthfeel - Very good. Bitter and typical SN profile.  Drinkability - Good. I don't know what else to say. Nothing to blow you away as I found every aspect of this beer.  Final Thoughts - This beer has grown on me some but if possible, purchase first for better examples of the WC IPA style:  PtE / Blind Pig Sculpin Racer 5 Green Flash WCIPA - although 6-packs to 4-packs FU GF!!!

140,30420,luisfrancisco,4.03,"Poured from a large bottle, might have been 500 ml or a little more.  This is a great IPA. It pours a nice orange/yellow, with a one inch white head.  Smells of piney hops, very delicious.  Taste is superb. It is a very nice dry IPA. Hop presence is very much the main taste element here. Nice citrusy, grassy taste. Not too much malt, and with a dry finish.  I would say this is probably stronger and hoppier than a regular IPA, but not as much as a Double IPA. Also it does not have the caramel or sweet malt backbone that will be present in some of the DIPAs.  All in all, one mighty go to hoppy and dry IPA. Excellent.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,depechemode1983,4.2,"Poured into a pint glass with a dark orange honey color. This beer has an awesome looking off-white head that seems to last forever, with tons of sticky lacing all over the glass. Smells fantastic. Lots of pine with a little apricot in the middle mixed with some citrus/grapfruit. Ends nice, crisp, and clean. wow. hoppy. There's a lot of citric hops in the taste. With very little sweetness in the middle. Pine flavors pull throw towards the end, giving it a bitter aftertaste. It has a semi creamy light bodied mouthfeel, with a pretty high amount of carbonation. This is an excellent IPA. If i need a hop fix in the future I will keep this beer in mind. Can't beat it at 7.99 a six pack. I love SN price points. Quality beer at reasonable prices. The only reason this beers drinkability is a little low is because of the slightly higher than average ABV. But an evening at home with out the need to drive anywhere, this beer can easily become a session.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,spinrsx,3.73,"12oz Bottle  Appearance - The beer pours a clear amber/orange colour with a nice size rocky/creamy/frothy off-white head. There is a lot of carbonation showing and the lacing is excellent. The head lasted for several minutes before it began to dissipate.  Smell - hops, cereal, caramel, lemon, pine  Taste & Mouth - There is quite a bit of carbonation on the tongue and the beer is creamy yet dry. The most noticeable flavours are cookies, pine, nuts, and caramel. There are also notes of citrus and a sort of rustiness. I can't put my finger on it, but something just tastes like it doesn't belong. It finishes with a nutty bitter hop aftertaste.  Drink - It's definitely an above average brew, but something just didn't taste right. Perhaps I am just more of a fan of their Celebration ale and their Pale Ale. I expected more, but it was still worth a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste is citrusy hops with a bit of lemon peal, some light malt. Palate is nice full body, and good carbonation.

Very little bitterness and maltiness when drinking too.  Mouthfeel: Smooth medium body that is light on the tongue.  Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer.

140,30420,bbkd3b,3.79,"As a fan of the Pale Ale, I'm looking forward to this. Poured into a pint glass.  A - The color's a beautiful copper, and it's clear as can be. I could see across a farm field holding this front of me, it's so clear. On the flip-side, the head is a weak 0.5-finger, and that's with a hard pour. At least there's some lacing, though.  S - Wow... potent hoppiness. It's like an IPA in an IPA, if you know what I mean. Pine and citrus hops all around. Very potent, very powerful... wondering what this smell would be like on my tongue.  T - Oh, that's what it's like: overwhelming. While I like the smell, the taste is exactly the same: hops overload. Pine hops, citrus hops, it's all there. Sadly, what it lacks is a bit of balance. The result is this sort of tongue-cutting beer that leaves me going, ""Sheesh... couldn't they tone it down a notch?"" Well-brewed, but over the top.  M - The not-surprisingly bitter finish is preceded by a nice, light body with good carbonation. Overall, it feels nice all of the way through. It almost floats off of the tongue. Very pleasant.  D - The good thing about most hoppy beers is that they get the easier to drink as you go on. This one is no different, and it's affordable. To rookies, though, this is going to be a tough ride.  Overall/notes - Man, this may be the hoppiest beer I've ever tasted. I've had Hop Stoopid and Pliny the Elder, too. What those two have, however, is a refinement this one lacks. A bit disappointed that it couldn't be more rounded off, but I'll live, I suppose. Fans of hops will adore it (as the rating suggests).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,honkey,4.58,"Pours a copper with a beautiful head which fades to a half a finger as the glass gets sipped (or in this case, gulped)  Smell- very floral aroma with a hint of sweetness that follows  Taste- hello hops! First sip shows a lot of hops flavor followed by a moderate sweetness from caramel malts. Usually, I like my IPAs to have very little caramel flavor, but SN has shown that even caramel malts have their place in an IPA.  Mouthfeel/drink- could stand to be a bit drier, but that is getting nit picky. A great IPA. I hope this becomes as easy to find as their pale ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ramseye4,4.31,"Pours a copper color with a perfect 2 finger head that has great retention, splendid lacing follows the brew down the glass. Aroma is of citric hops, with some very subtle malt undertones. Has a very natural taste to it. Taste is of hops, hops, and more hops, the quintessential IPA in my opinion. The malt undertones complement the hops nicely, and the aftertaste sits perfectly in the mouth, but isn't too powerful. The ABV is completely hidden by the hop masterpiece. The beer is full bodied and thick, a tad chewey, and the carbonation level is good, giving it a bit of a pop as it slides around. Drinkability is surprisingly high, especially with how good this one tastes. I have put back a sixer in one sitting on a few occasions, not out of a desire to become inebriated, but because I really enjoyed the taste just that much. This is one of my favorite ales of all time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bigdonniebrasco,4.5,"Appearance - The pour was nice, your typical IPA pour with a deep brownish amber, with great clarity. Nice streams of carbonation could be seen streaking up toward the top of the glass throughout the session, letting me know this one was definitely not going to be dull in anyway. A nice two finger head of white foam had graced the top for a quick while, but faded down to just a thin veil of lace, but not before depositing the nice web like side glass foam.  Smell - The aroma was rich with pine like hops. A nice bit of fresh resin like aromas coming off of it throughout. But as it warmed, it turned a touch biscuity, showing that there were some underlying malts that were causing it to be a bit more of a balanced offering then what I was expecting. Still though, this was a solid IPA, with a classic west coast aroma.  Taste - The flavor was spot on, and exactly what I had been looking for. The first flavor to hit my mouth was a deep pine resin freshness. Sticky, bitter, and sweet all at the same time, it had a nice refreshing quality to it as well. Virtually no alcohol present, so I cannot imagine this one as coming off too terribly strong, it was a nice solid IPA. Some nice tangerine and orange hints whirling around in the back as well, letting you know there was a nice mix of west coast hops. The finish was strong, very dry and bitter, with the long lasting taste of pine coming through quite nicely.  Mouthfeel - Very nicely carbonated, this came off very smooth, and at the same time, quite refreshing and light. I really enjoyed how nicely this all came together here as it was quite lively and crisp and really the nice way to start an afternoon.  Drinkability - This was an outstanding session ale. Crisp, clean and with fresh hop bite, I could have continued to drink this one all day long.

140,30420,molinator,4.58,"This is the beer that broke the camel's back. I had to make an account here after I ran through a few six packs. Before this Torpedo Extra IPA, I had been wary about tasting Pale Ale. My first encounter was Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which I enjoyed but found less drinkable.  Torpedo Extra IPA, however, hits the nail on the head.  Pours a dark amber, with a nice lingering head.  My gripe with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale was that it left too much aftertaste for my liking. I think that's where this (India) Pale Ale's alcohol content works in its favor. It is able to harness massive flavor without having overwhelming aftertaste that prevents it from being drinkable - I believe the 7.2% ABV does a nice job of cleaning the slate for the next sip. That's not to say that the aftertaste is entirely alcoholic. It is masked nicely by pine tones that linger when the last traces of liquid line the pallet.  The carbonation is spot on, and lingers for a surprisingly long time after having been poured. I was watching CO2 bubbles rise to the top of my drink for quite a while after I poured it.  And as a personal anecdote, I made it my goal to try a wide variety of beers on my own when I turned 21 - certainly not due to bad experiences with cheap beers before, officer, sir. Since then I have tasted micro, macro, and in between. Don't let it sway you too much, but if I had to pick a favorite up until now, this would be it. Perfect balance of everything I wanted from beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The aroma shows a lot of grapefruit and pine top it wit ha bit of a lemony citrusness to it as well. it has just a touch of some fruity, mango like flavors to it as well. A moderate malty flavor comes through and provides a nice base for all the hops.  The taste hits you with a big blast of pine and grapefruit right from the start. It's very bitter at first but it mellows a bit towards the finish when more of the lemony citrus and a hint of sweeter malt come through. The dry, bitter, grapefruit flavors linger for a while as well.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, It has some very nice hoppy flavors to it overall.

140,30420,Betmore,4.03,"*poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass*  This beer poured a murky amber/orange color and formed a soft, off-white head that hung out for awhile. It eventually settled into a thin foam top that left some fair lacing.  Dank is the first word that came to mind when the aroma hit me. I'm getting boatloads of fruity (think grapefruit and pineapple) hops with a suprising amount of sweet caramel malts. There's a noticable amount of alcohol wafting out of there too. Its not so much as to be distracting, but its definitely there.  The flavor went a little sidways on me. Rather than getting the fruity hops that I smelled, I'm getting bitter pine with just a hint of citrus. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, it just kind of caught me off guard. On subsequent tastes, I'm getting more and more of those caramel balancing malts. They never come close to overtaking the hops, but they do come out of hiding and into the open reletively early, unlike a lot of other West Coast IPAs. This is a good beer. The only thing holding it back is that its nothing special. That sounds like a slam but its really not. Its a nicely balanced American IPA. I've had better, but I've had A LOT worse too.  This brew actually seemed to have a fair amount of body to it and the carbonation feels just right. The flavor does seem to fade a little faster than some of the other IPAs I've had.  I'm a little hung up on drinkability here. Its a good beer. I had no trouble at all drinking a single. And while I could definitley drink an entire 6 pack in one session, I don't think I'd want to. The hop profile just isn't my favorite; I prefer citrus to pine. And then there's the ABV... While its not a 10%+ mad man like the Imperials out there, 7.2% can put a quite a fuzz on things.  Overall, its good. If you like IPAs, pick up a sixer. I think mine was $7.99 or $8.99. Either way its, at the very least, a good value for a hophead.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste Notes: Big flavors here. Very hop forward, with the citrus flavors being brought out at first by the malty sweetness. However, when the malt fades and aftertaste develops, the piney, almost sappy hop flavors build to a strong, bolt sensation on the palette.  Flavor Wheel Scores (1 low to 5 high): Dark Fruits: 3 Citrus Fruits: 4 Hoppy (pine): 5 Floral: 4 Spicy: 3 Herbal: 3 Malty: 4 Toffee: 3 Burnt: 1 Sweet: 2 Sour: 1 Bitter: 5 Astringent: 2.5 Body: 3 Linger: 4 Alcohol/Solvent: 2",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,grittybrews,4.35,"Poured a ruddy caramel amber into a tulip with a finger of slow-fading off-white head. Powerful aroma of grapefruit with touches of caramel, honey, and bubblegum sweetness.  Moderate carbonation and a full, smooth mouthfeel (one of the most enjoyable that I can recall). Sweet up front with a solid caramel malt backbone, balanced by grapefruit hops and returning to bitterness on the finish with a hint of tangerine. Alcohol is well-masked, and the result is extremely tasty and easy-drinking. Exceptionally well-balanced.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,beerprovedwright,4.45,"Two finger head from the pour of the orange/amber IPA. Rates a 20 on the SRM beer color chart. A little cloudy in appearance with good bubble action. Smell has grapefruit, lemon, lime, green pinecone, along with other hints of wheat, corn, malt and hops. Wonderful citrus taste, with citrus being in the forefront, but also good amount of hops in the finish. Good bold feeling in my mouth with plenty of zing. This is a beer worth drinking and often. The more I have of it the better I like it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,oluap,4.6,"Delicious bouquet & taste of grapefruits and citrus, slight hints of tropical fruits and pine... bubble gum perhaps? Emanating sweetness from malt that gives a great balance! Good mouth feel (that gets better as beer warms) with a rocky yet pillowie head that has good retention and lacing..  yet another great beer from SNB! &lt;3 Sierra Nevada!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,surlytheduff,4.02,"Poured into Sam Smith nonic glass. Color was rich coppery amber, with a 1.5 finger offwhite head. Fairly clear looking through it, you could see thing trails of co2 trailing upwards through it.  My nose was greeted with a strong but not over the top citrusy hop aroma, with some pine and a bit of malt.  Citrus scent carried over into flavor, but the overriding element was that of hops. The pale malt flavor was also very apparent.  It really coats your mouth, feeling almost frothy. It's a real pleasure to drink, and (for me at least) is hard to pass up at the local party store considering the low cost and high quality.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jsanford,4.13,"Poured into a pint glass  A - Pours a dark orange-copper with a nice white head of foam. Great lacing and retention, this has a head on it 15 minutes later. S - Very hoppy, specifically pungent pine and citrus. There's a sweetness from the malt in there as well. T - Deep, pungent hops lead to very sweet, bready malt. Again, this one's very hoppy, you can spot a dry-hopped beer from a mile away. M - Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Really coats the mouth, and the bitterness lasts for some time on the palate. D - One of the most drinkable IPAs on the shelf, especially at such rock-bottom prices.  Another amazing brew from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,IronLover,4.15,"Deep hazy copper orange color. Decent off-white head that leaves a healthy white cap and generous sticky lacings. A variety of hop aromas. Citrus orange and grapefruit, spicy floral and pine. A hint of sweet malt sneaks in there too. Very smooth feel. Medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. Big hop flavors with citrus flavors in the front that lead to pine bitterness at the end and malty backbone throughout. The bitter pine flavor lingers a while which hurts the drinkability, but otherwise a fabulous IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,rapayn01,4.65,"As a fan of hoppy ales, this is rapidly become my favorite affordable beer. My local grocery chain has been selling it for $7.50 per six pack for weeks now.  The hoppy flavor is fairly intense and earthy. It pours to a thin (but nice) head in your glass and has a rich smell.  Update: June 2013. I still really like Torpedo, but the price has been creeping up towards $9 per six pack and the competition is much stiffer with Michigan craft beers widely available now.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Zimbo,4.31,December 31st 2011 update.  Filled to capicity in the one litre 'Stein of Truth' this beer revealed a previously undisclosed vibrant and succulant hoppy tang which was hidden in mortal drinking vessels. More balanced and visually lustier in a light reddish amber light as well.  ---  Drank this paired with Titan IPA. Thanks to russpowell for his advice.  Deep dense thick rocky head which leaves some wonderfully frothy lacing all over the glass from beginning to end. Reddish golden in colour with a deep dominant piney hoppy smell. An intense taste without being truly over the top. Very husky and bitter with elements of raw grapefruit. Full and heavish on the tongue but surprisingly also spritzy.  A bit heavier than expected from an IPA ('extra' or otherwise) and while hugely enjoyable I would have liked to have experienced some more complexity.  More Grizzly Adams than Last of the Mohicans.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JizackFH,4.14,"A - Has a great IPA color too it, and a great 2 finger head that last a nice amount of time. Also the head leaves a nice lacing on the glass as it dissipates.  S - Very hoppy, great IPA smell to it.  T - I love this beer, it is a great IPA. the hops are really present and give a great bite. the hops dont hold back one bit, and that's what I love about this beer. Very earthy, with a hint of citrus.  M - Coats the mouth nicely. It is in between a medium body and a high body. Nice carbonation.  D - I drink this beer a lot. Its great. It goes down smooth, but at that same time it had a great bite and bitterness too it.  So overall I would recomend this beer to those people that love IPAs. I think it is a really good beer that bridges the gap between an IPA and a Double IPA. It is just a true work of art. Good gob Sierra Nevada, keep up the good work.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Beerenauslese,4,"Pours clear gold with a modest head that quickly dissipates, but still leaves some clouds of lacing on the glass.  Aromas of malt, piney hops and salt.  Tastes pretty malty with piney resinous grapefruit hops.  Body is light but carbonation is too, giving this a somewhat flattish mouthfeel that just borders on being creamy.  A very drinkable IPA, go to IPA given its price point. No problem drinking a few of these. The extra alcohol kick and flavor separates this from the midstream of IPAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,PicoPapa,4.12,12oz bottle. Pours a light amber color with a thin head. Lots of lacing. Full aroma of citrus and pine. Nice smell of hops as well. Taste is more of the same. Big flavor of pine followed by citrus. Bitter. Pretty drinkable and hard to pick up on the 7.2% ABV. Lots of hoppy pine flavor in this beer. Damn good.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,garuda,3.68,"A - Clear copper with a one finger thick off-white head that has good retention, and good lacing down the glass.  S - Nothing pungent, but a nice combo of citrusy and pine hops with a sweet, bready malt undertone.  T - A little spicy at first, then bready malts, with a very bitter grapefruit rind and pine resin finish/aftertaste.  M - Medium body, medium carbonation, leaves some hop oils in the mouth after the finish. Lingering, bitter aftertaste.  D - Nice well-rounded IPA, but nothing spectacular. I'd drink it again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,generallee,4.18,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. On the label the ABV is listed at 7.2% and there is a nice description. There is no freshness or born on date though.  Appearance: The body has a light hazy orange amber color with a tall off white head. The head hangs on well and makes lots of cool lacing on the glass as I drink.  Smell: It has a big citrusy bouquet with firm grapefruit and orange zest notes coming through over some candy sweet malts.  Taste/Palate: It starts with a deep and pungent citrusy character that brings nice bitterness and a slight pine note to the sweet malt, of which there is a solid base of candy like and bready/yeasty malt. Hop notes linger on well into the finish and the palate has a well carbonated, firm medium body and texture.  Notes: It had a little more sweetness than I was expecting and a little less pine like character. Overall it was still a very well made and tasty IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Star80,4.38,"Pours a dark copper with a tan head, with clinging lace all over my glass. In fact, it LOOKS like a dry hopped beer and it certainly is one. Curious to read more about this torpedo dry hop process. Smells like citrus piney hops, some slight alcohol in the nose. Taste is actually kinda smooth for such a big beer! Not much booziness detected, so much hops that cover up that alcohol. In fact, this beer is actually kinda balanced for an IPA. Has many layers of hoppiness, cannot detect much ""herbal"" hops in this beer. Mouthfeel is not overly rich either for such a beer, quite drinkable in a scary way...this beer reminds me of a big SNPA, but not huge like Bigfoot. A great extension of the brand, and perfectly fits in the spectrum of Sierra Nevada's other tasty offerings. If I recall my last six pack of these went down all too quickly....",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DanThomas,4.33,"After being disappointed by the Great Divide Hercules IIPA, what a refresher to love this offering from Sierra Nevada!  A- This is what a beer should look like! Cloudy orange/copper with a big foamy head and tons of lacing running down the glass.  S- Hops, hops, and more hops. Grapefruit smell hits you initially, then a piney spice takes over. Some biscuit undertones.  T- Reflects the smell almost exactly, but with more pine. I will say that for all of the hop flavor (and there's a lot of it), I get a really nice malt biscuit background to this beer that nicely counterbalances the hops and makes their flavor stand out more.  M- Exceedingly smooth. Carbonation upfront but that quickly dissipates.  D- For the style, extremely high. Alcohol hides itself. Go out and get this beer!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,brandoncox,5,This IPA pours a deep orange color and a nice off-white soapy head that sticks around through the entire session. Great amount of lacing until the last drop.  Very exceptional aroma. Smells like a pine cone dropped right off a tree onto a ground of hops. The most natural smelling IPA I have ever stuck my nose to.  The taste is of pines with an amazing herbal profile.  Mouthfeel is decently thick and follows through with a resonated liquid texture straight down the palate.  I could drink an entire case of these. Just truly an amazing and outstanding IPA worth every penny. Definitely a thirst quencher.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,gopens44,4,"A - Dark amber with about 1/2"" of cream colored satiny head  S - Malty like roasted caramely malts, very floral and earthy.  T - Bitter as you'd like. Pine presence like gin with a grassy taste as well.  M - Dry, dry and dry with a bitterness that hangs around on the tongue like a sheet of bitterness.  D - When I'm in the mood for something this bitter (which is often), I'll reach for a Torpedo. Certainly everything I was hoping for and more...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,MNJR,4.15,"This is a solid brew. Color is a beautiful amber with light tan head and excellent lacing. The smell is just fantastic: soothing, slightly medicinal (in a good way, as in natural), really fresh pine, and mountain air. No, I'm not into aromatherapy, but if I was, this must be what they mean. The flavor is pretty intense, even for an IPA, Very bold. I doubt many here have ever tried Swedish bitters, but there is a strong similarity here, although tamed down quite a bit. There is a high concentration of hops here which are very sharp and distinctly herbal. Which herbs exactly is kind of hard for me to say. Lemon, orange, pine sap (which I have never tried, but this has to be close), and a dry, herbal tonic, slight quinine finish. Overall, this stuff has a really raw, fresh kick to it. Not for the sensitive. Extremely enjoyable. If you like IPAs this is the stuff you need to try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,SuperNova777,4.08,"A:Pours a hazy orange color with a fingers worth of white head, nice spotty lacing left down the glass through out the drink  S:Smells of citrus and piney hops that are not too over powering along with a hint of pale malts as well  T:Taste comes thru way better than the nose suggest. Pale malts up front than a kick on the mid and backend of piney, citrus, and grapefruit bitterness. Palate is left a little dry with bitterness linger on it as well.  M:Solid mouthfeel with good carbonation throughout.  D:Super tasty brew form SN and probably my favorite of their year round offerings. Nice hop profile, easy drink, affordable, and all around enjoyable. Should try this one out if you see it at the store.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Hamsteroceros,4.25,"Bottle poured into Sierra Nevada tulip glass  A- Perfect golden-orange color. Very lacey with a long-lasting eggshell-colored head. Not super bubbly.  S- Oranges, grapefruit, lemon, pine, and a hint of malt in a very refreshing nasal assault.  T- Bitterness appears early, but a strong citrus presence balances this. Gorgeous balance of citrus and flora. There is almost a tang of yeast, but this is never quite fully realized. Very complex, yet very clean-tasting.  M- Resinous but not very syrupy. Solid body yet very clean and light on the finish. Perfect amount of carbonation for the flavor.  D- There are few IPAs as widely available and inexpensive as this one. That said, I've seen few IPAs as consistent, drinkable, and well-rounded. This is absolutely a ""go to"" beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BamaViper1,3.93,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  This beer pours a transparent amber brown with an inch thick off-white head. The head slowly dissipates leaving a nice bit of lacing on the glass.  The Torpedo has aromas of bitter hops and grapefruit citrus and bits of grass. Later the bready malt pushes through as well.  The has a light acidic/citrus, bitter nose. The malt backbone comes through next with a fresh baked bread finish (a little much). Inhaling produces a bitter alcoholic taste/smell, perhaps like permanent markers but in a pleasant way.  The mouthfeel for this beer is wonderful, medium/full-bodied with good carbonation.  This beer has good drinkability too; the alcohol is unnoticable when drinking and and overall it's a solid IPA. I do wonder if this bottle I had was not quite as fresh as it could be as I expected a fuller hop profile. That really just means I need a second tasting. And a third...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,StoutHunter,4.2,"Picked up a 6 pack of this since i haven't seen it around and I have heard nothing but good things so lets see how it drinks. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a imperial pint glass.  A- Pours a nice orange amber color with a fingers worth of white head that turned into a thin clump that stayed for a while.  S- Wow, smells like a pine cone that just dropped from the tree. The hops impart a nice citrus smell backed up by some nice sweet maltyness.  T- Similar to the nose, very piney with some nice citrus to compliment the pine. It's bitter but not over the top bitter. All the flavors are balanced perfectly. On point for its style.  M- Right on for the style crisp and medium light bodied.  D- This is pretty drinkable for an IPA, its not too bitter so 2 or 3 of these would hit the spot. Hides it alcohol well.  Overall i am glad i picked this brew up, it was a pleasure to drink and i will for sure get this again. This is one of the best American IPA's i have had to date but two hearted is still my favorite. Keep making kick as brews Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Fatehunter,4.03,"A - Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Light head, quickly faded. Deep orange, 50% transparent.  S - I'm in a pine forest with an orange tree in the middle and one grapefruit.  T - Hops! Bitterness lingering on the tongue long afterward.  M - Just about perfect. Crisp and light to medium body.  D - Sometimes I enjoy an overpoweringly hoppy IPA. This one isn't that. It has just the right amount of bitterness to have no doubt that it is an IPA but I am still able to enjoy more than a couple of these at a time without my taste buds getting dulled by the bitterness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,kramerboy,4.52,This is a really good IPA. Easy to find at just about any grocery or package store. Very crisp and delightful!  Pours clear light orange with good head retention. The great hops smell translates to an excellent taste. This is one that I could knock back more than just a couple in a single night.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Jerdmier,4.84,Great IPA. Pours very well but is missing a good staying head.The little bit of head I got from the initial pour was a nice light caramel color. Lacing also lacks staying power. Has a good fruity hops taste with a strong hops aftertaste. This is definitely a beer I can sit down to and make a night of. May be a little heavy in the hops for a new person trying IPA for the first time. Save it for the more serious IPA drinker.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Mineo,4.12,"A - Fantastic off-white head, clear dark orange-amber color that is maintained throughout. Lacing lasted the entire round.  S - Citrus and hops... some orange and lemon perhaps, with some very fresh-smelling herbal appeal. No pungency whatsoever; smell is very crisp. Keep in mind, this is for a bottle that was bottled only 26 days ago. I had one that was bottled several months ago and the smell/taste was a lot more malty than the fresh bottle, which produces a wonderful malt/citrus/hops combo that is unrivaled. Unlike Bigfoot, this beer appears to weaken in flavor with time, so the fresher the better!  T - Initial overwhelming feeling of hops, but overwhelming in a good sense. Swallow resembles a mixture of malted hops and citrus, the latter which dominates in the after-taste.  M - Exceptionally smooth, with the perfect amount of carbonation. Tastes like a beer in the 5% ABV range, so masking a 7.2% this well is quite extraordinary.  D - one of the most drinkable IPAs I have had. Sierra Nevada's brewing style includes complexities that only enduring stomach may endure, but for those able to handle it there are few better than Torpedo. it is my favorite Sierra Nevada product.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,AEK,4.1,"355ml brown bottle poured into a Young's pint pot. B.B.E 6/10/10.  A. Cloudy blood orange coloured ale topped by a solid looking white head. Head retention is excellent.  S. Juicy malt and faint traces of plums in madeira. A touch hoppy.  T. A clean, strong tasting IPA, possibly a hint of creaminess though this is masked by the alcohol strength. Roasted malt and a pleasant hop kick.  M. Medium bordering on thick, mouth coating.  D. A delicious IPA, one of only 3 Sierra Nevada beers I can honestly give a double thumbs up sign to.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BBP,4.29,"A- One of the nicer looking IPA's I've seen. Dark orange body with a solid finger's worth of head, and very intense carbonation.  S- As soon as I got the bottle open, a sharp note of bitterness jumped out. Once I got closer to the beer after it had been poured, I didn't find much else to describe. Their was definite bitterness, and what seemed like a bit of citrus. The aroma was quite faint sadly.  T- A very good hop backbone and then some more hops on top. I enjoyed the bitterness that I found in this one. You get a pretty good taste from the hops for about 30 seconds before some of the citrus works it's way to the top. The hops also have more of a pine taste to them than in most IPA's and it comes off as a bit more bitter than beers using other hops. There is some malt in this one, but it plays it's part in balancing the drink, without making much note of itself.  It is what it is, and it's a hop heavy IPA. I enjoy it substantially, but people looking for more balance should look elsewhere. The only thing I didn't like about the taste was how evident the citrus was in the aftertaste.  M- Medium full body with hops and carbonation that do some work on your tongue. A bit creamier than the average IPA as well.  D- Very drinkable, and very easy to find. I'm glad that I picked it up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,nas5755,4.4,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. A clear amber beer with a thick head was poured. The lacing was impressive. The nose consisted of piney grapefruit. This beer tasted like piney grapefruit with a nice sweet malt profile, very bitter on the bite and very pleasant. The carbonation levels are very nice for this beer and it slightly creamy. Overall, I love this beer. This is one of the few beers I constantly am buying, the value is spot on. The flavors of this beer set the cornerstone for American IPA flavor.  I really want to try this beer on tap but I have never seen it on a tap list over here in MA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,WestValleyIPA,4.13,"Poured into my Zatec fluted glass from a 12 oz bottle. Nice hazy golden amber color, followed by a light off-ivory 2 finger head. Incredibly lasting lacing. Smells spicy, citrusy, definitely cascades goin on, especially given that it's Sierra Nevada. Maybe some German hops too, given a light pilsner scent. Certainly an evergreen quality. Tastes richly spicy and citrusy, pine, grapefruit and lemon. A bit of warmth as it goes down your throat. Nice lingering bitterness that dries out your mouth. Imminently drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

M - Effervescent, bubbly, the beer danced around my tongue. Lingering bitterness at the end.  D - A solid beer, but I can only do IPAs in smaller amounts.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Omegabyte,3.45,"First, I'm not a huge fan of IPAs. I have my select few and distinct flavors that I like. Second, it's a slippery hot day in HI and I really craved some hops. But, nonetheless, here's my review.  Appearance: is a cloudy copper color. The head doesn't retain very long, but it pours out nicely. Lacing is dispersed, but stays. After about 10 min. it becomes clearer. Smell: tangy, hoppy, light with a bit of a piney flavor. Can really come up with more than that. Smells that the usual IPA. Got a little bit of a stuffy nose too. Taste: hops are not overwhelming but do taste quite flowery. The taste kind of reminds me of the taste of pine tree bark without the nasty aftertaste and overwhelming bitterness. It's light and earthy but still a little citrusy. Mouthfeel: To me, the beer is very well carbonated. The first taste hits you like a tingling wave. Like a very dull, tasty version of putting your tongue to a 9 Volt battery. Doesn't leave a terrible coating afterwards either. Drinkability: Perfect for a hot sticky day. This is the second time trying this beer, and I craved it for a day like this. Doesn't destroy your taste buds. Destroys that parched, sticky feel in your mouth on hot days.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,keith712,4.47,"This is my second review of a Sierra Nevada label, and only my second real review of an IPA, and I must say, I am becoming indoctrinated to the style! This IPA is rated at 7.2% alcohol by volume (abv).  12oz bottle poured into my favorite glass. Not real cold, call it 50F, I let it sit a couple minutes before I drank it after opening it.  Appearance: Beautiful golden orange haze. Nice moderate head, even poured kind of aggressive it was just right.  Nose: Wonderful warm and bright hops, pungent, and crisp. Piney, floral overtones. Pleasant, and smells of quality. Makes me WANT to drink it. It gets clearer after a couple minutes as some of the bubbles work themselves out.  Taste: Nice and crisp, definitely lots of hops but also smooth. A decent amount of carbonation but not too fizzy. Maybe the premium malts in there tone down the sharp bitterness of the hops. I expected more bite (but it DOES have a nice one), and it does leave a nice after-bitter on the back of the tongue. Very pleased with the flavor. Again, as it warms a bit while I type this review, the flavors become more pronounced and enjoyable. Honestly, the alcohol is well masked and does not detract from the flavors at all.  Mouthfeel: Perfect! Not thin at all, a bit of chewiness that I can feel on the teeth. It feels substantial but not thick or syrupy. Leaves a coating that stays a bit. Does not inhibit going back for another drink immediately, in fact, it's so easy to down that I could go overboard on this 7.2% abv and get quite buzzed haha.  Drinkability: Awesome. I want another! Nice lacing that stays as the beer goes down and a thin head that follows to the last drink. I WILL be buying this again, and again...  Overall: Being new to the IPA world, I don't want to over rate this one, but it's ""damn good"" and I look forward to more of this one. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CascadeConan,3.5,Torpedo pours a deep orange color with lots of off-white head.  Smells of piney and citrus hops in the front with a fair amount of malt backbone.  The taste is not as bitter as you would hope from an IPA and the malt seems to play a bigger part than most beers of this style.  A fair amount of carbonation makes this beer crisp and as it warms the flavors become more complex and add points to this brew that were lacking during the initial taste.  This is a good beer and at 7.2% ABV it brings what you expect from an American IPA but falls short in bold hop flavors.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,irishevans,3.78,"A-pours a medium dark goldish brown, with a thick foamy three finger barely off-white head that dissipates slowly, leaving an ample amount of lace behind, and seems to settle at a half-finger depth.  N- I could smell this very strongly as I poured it. Rather floral and a bit of sweet fruity esters in there as well, I almost pick up on a pineapple scent.  T- Peppery right off the bat, and then developing a floral hop taste, and shortly there after some citrus taste, most of the hop ""bite"" is up front, with a milder finish, all in all pretty balanced, although a little more hop bite would be nice. I do like the apparent blend of citrus and floral hops.  M- not too thick or thin, although more toward the thick side, and with a refreshing quality that I wasn't expecting.  D- I'm not usually the biggest IPA fan on the planet(IMO they are summer beers, but I am in hawaii where there is no other season), and maybe this is from my recent lack of access to any craft of otherwise decent beer at all (hence the malt liquor reviews as of late). but this is rather enjoyable, not fast drinker, but nice to sit in what anywhere else on the globe would be a summer evening and sip on. given that it's like a dollar more than a ""40"" down the street, I think I may have found a new night cap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Quite peppery also, especially in the aftertaste where bitterness is quite noticeable  O: Nice beer, bought it many times now.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,stingrayvr6,4.47,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Showed a dark orange amber with a thick creamy head that stuck around the whole time and clung to the glass the whole way down. Smell of big piney and cirtus hops. Incredibly complex nose. Taste starts out with cirtus hop bite, creamy and sticky, spicy hops balance the citrus with a malt body underneath that keeps all the hops in check and makes this incredibly drinkable. Fantastic IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,NightINgale,4.28,"12 US fl.oz bottle poured into my SN tumbler glass... The bottle I had was not too fresh, so that may had affected the flavour profile.  A - A nice cloudy copper body with a rich beige head. Good head retention and some lacing. Looks absolutely beautiful and inviting!  S - Citrusy hops, with some pine notes still. A good solid caramel backbone, with hints of bread and toffee. Smells kind of sweet, but very IPA-like nevertheless.  T - Wow, what a treat for my taste-buds! Starts out with a good hop bite, followed by a very juicy citrus flavour, with strong hints of orange and grapefruit. The finish is bittersweet, with some lingering bread and caramel notes. The sweetness is well-balanced with the bitterness, so you won't have a problem with either of the two sensations.  M - Medium-bodied. The alcohol is pretty well-masked. The beer is smooth, refreshing and juicy! Feels great on the palate!  D - Good for a relatively strong beer! Goes down easily, provided you are used to hoppy beers! Drink in moderation, as the 7.2% ABV might get to you!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,SamuelJackson45,4.32,A- A nice bright amber look.  S- smell of citrus and hops and even a hint of a lemon peel or zest at the end.  T- Hoppy and Citrus taste a little lemony.  M- Dry and creamy citrus flavors linger through out sip.  D- Ok I been drinking IPA for awhile now and this is right up there. Has that bite of the citrus hops. Great aroma and flavor. I think I need to get some more. Try some if not already.  Cheers...,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bohemiandonut,3.68,"Pours a no nonsense deep amber, fully brit and lit. Sticky lace from a head that apparently had somewhere to be.  Delectable aroma on this sexy brew, citrus rinds and an obvious Sierra Nevada malt complexion (Pale Ale style) negotiate the open sea that is IPA.  Riding that lovely scent is a wave of bitter hop flavors (grass, spruce, fir, pine and brutal grapefruit) backed by maple-speaking malts that just wont quit (even when you want them to.)  That agressive Sierra Nevada carbonation is much appreciated for the style. Superb and familiar, but familiar. Ill try to not let that hurt this score.  With 5 more to go, Id be shootin myself in the foot if I said this wasnt drinkable, so I'll substitute smellable for drinkable and admit that I would order this fine brewski just to cram its volatile vapours straight into my hind-brain.

140,30420,BeerAdvocate,4.5,"Review from BeerAdvocate magazine Issue #26:  What's interesting about Sierra Nevada is that up until this year, they were probably one of the only West Coast breweries to not produce a year-round India Pale Ale (IPA). However, around three years ago, there was buzz on the internetz that Sierra Nevada was dabbling with a new way of infusing hops into beer. Soon, a concoction named ""Torpedo"" began to rear its foam at select locations and events. In late 2008, Sierra Nevada announced that they'd be launching a year-round IPA called ""Torpedo Extra IPA,"" and revealed the process:  ""The name itself comes from a device called the 'hop torpedo' that was conceived, designed and developed at the brewery. The result is a revolutionary method of dry-hopping that harnesses the vital hop oils and resins that lead to an unusually flavorful and aromatic beer featuring the full, nuanced range of spicy complexity that hops have to offer.""  They also use 100-percent American hops and multiple varieties--each of which impart unique characters. Let's load this one and give it a shot--yeah, that was bad.  Pours a bright, clear copper with a thick and hop-induced, creamy, off-white foam head with a lace that sticks and stays along the glass. Big hops in the nose. Floral with some grapefruit rind and pepper in the back. Smooth and creamy on the palate with a firm, round and semi-full body. A bit chewy and juicy at times. Fruity (a bit tropical) with citrus (mostly rind, some grapefruit), semisweet apple (Red Delicious comes to mind) and some herbal notes (soft and pleasant). Then bitter. Dry and acidic with an aspirin edge. Building layers of hops on the palate with each sip. Fresh, green hops. Pine. Resin. Spice. Hint of soap (happens with highly hopped beers). Palate turns gritty and leafy with an ashy finish. Biscuity malt. Hay. Bone dry. More-ish.  Torpedo is a dry and robust IPA that waves confidently at the Double IPA with a ton of hop presence and 7.2-percent ABV, but remains an American IPA with its artful use of hops that brings big, but balanced, flavors, and subsequent drinkability. We love it. Released in January 2009 in six-packs and hopefully available until the end of days.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,NODAK,3.87,"Smell is decidedly hoppy, with citrus and piney hops coming out...but there's also a fair amount of sweet malt on the nose as well. Rather balanced.  Grapefruit and piney hops come through early and often in this beer and do so with a pretty good amount of intensity, however, there's also a decent amount of sweet toffee malt underneath that provides a fair balance and keeps it from being too one-sided. Through the finish, the bitterness continues at a fairly high level, and lingers in the aftertaste for a while.  As far as IPA's go, I think that this beer does a pretty good job with balance and doesn't go too overboard with the hoppiness. The high ABV harms drinkability, however.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mjurney,4.5,"Appearance: Amber-orange color, slight hazy. Lots of carbonation. Head looks awesome, leaves a really nice lacing on the glass.  Smell: Floral hops, some citrus, hint of piney, caramel malts.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Floral hops up front, I get some citrus and touch of pine. Sweet caramel malts in the background to balance it. There's some hint of orange-pineapple in the middle. Very smooth and crisp finish with slight dry herbal aftertaste. Body is light-medium. Carbonation feels very nice.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. An awesome American IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T- Obviously hoppy, but not over the top at all, The hops to not punch you in the face and are in balance with the malts.  M- not much going on here, pretty thin.  D- Easy drinkin' IPA. Really nice offering from SN. Balanced and fresh tasting. Not a hop heads dream, but a solid IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bridgetowhophead,4.01,"This is probably the 30th bottle of torpedo I've had, and I chose to review this one because it's the freshest I've been able to get since discovering how to read their bottling code--about 5 weeks old.  A: Pours a rich bronze/amber. Not a whole lot of head retention or lacing, but a swirl does reveal some nice bubbles.  S: Much different than the SNPA, Torpedo is all about the piney, grassy hops. Malt presence increases as it warms.  T: Ahh, fresh, whole cone hops. Delicious hop profile, sticky and resiny, a little alcohol heat as it goes down.  M: Perfect amount of carbonation, medium body which is right where I like it for an IPA. The generous amount of hops coats the palate.  D: This is easily the most drinkable beer I've found over 7% ABV. Right as I finish I want another.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,thebrood1987,4.8,"First it starts off with a smell of pine and hop resin...then when you swirl it around and it warms a little you can smell the citrus grapefruit smell combined with the sappy pine needle smell. Tastes great with a nice sweet malt and an amazing pine hop backing that stays on the back of your tongue. When I first tried this and wasn't very familiar with the style I thought there was an overwhelming amount of pine. Now that IPA has become my favorite style of beer it is a great top of the list go to IPA. I also noticed pungent graepfruit hop flavor.  You can tell they don't throw the usual type of hops that the standard American IPA's use. What really sets this apart from other top notch IPA's like Dogfish Head 60 Minute or Stone IPA is that this has a medicinal herbal and very grapefruity smell and taste from the whole cone hops which is amazing. This is my favorite beer from this brewery... I think it's even better than the Celebration Ale. This is more bitter where Celebration is a bit more sweeter with different hops. If you want an IPA get this. Amazing job Sierra Nevada from Chico, California.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,EwaldEichstaett,3.98,"A: Rusty brown color, maybe a little bit cloudy. It has yellow hues when held up to the light. Giant 3 finger head with excellent lacing and retention.  S: There is no difficulty getting a good smell of this beer. It has very floral hops. With some pine and citrus bitterness. Some full bodied malts are also present upon investigation.  T: The citrus and pine flavors of the hops dominate the flavor. However, there is a bit of a malty body. Very classic American IPA flavor... there is a slight bit of a metallic taste which I don't like; but overall, it is great.  M: Nice thick body, feels silky in the mouth, the beer is really easy to swallow. The carbonation is wonderful and the beer really coats your mouth.  D: For some reason, the bitterness of this one gives me a bit of a headache. This does not normally happen to me with IPA's. This has happened to me several times with Torpedo and is the only real disappointment with this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,FreshHawk,4.17,"A - Slightly hazy, deep orange/bronze color. About average sized (maybe just below average) size, creamy, dense, sticky, off-white head. Very good retention leaving a nice layer of foamy lace.  S - A lot of sweet orange citrus hops along with a good amount of pine resin. Also a good amount of caramel malt comes out. Good amount of grapefruit, floral, and grassy hops as well. Nice mix of sweet malt and hoppy flavors and a pretty fresh smell.  T - Toasted, caramel tasting malt flavor provides a backbone for the beer. Good amount of hop flavor starting with sweetish orange and a touch of grapefruit and lemon citrus flavor to start out, then some more piney resin comes out, and it finishes with more grassy, herbal, and floral flavor. A touch of spiciness, zesty, peppery flavors also come out mid sip toward the finish. Pretty bitter hoppy flavor as well (although not kick you in the face bitter).  M - Medium body with about average carbonation. Pretty smooth and crisp taste.  D - Easy and tasty to drink IPA. I enjoyed drinking this. Not going to blow you away, but it is tasty.  Notes: Enjoyable IPA especially given the accessibility and the cost. Not amazing or is going to blow you away, but a solid IPA.

Aroma is pine-like, slightly citric. Taste centers around a full hop body, bitter and a bit acidic. I noticed more alcohol taste in the background, has a bitter aftertaste on the palate. For an IPA, this beer is smartly focused on hop flavor, and is unique in using American hops to distinguish it from an English IPA or other.  First time I tried this beer I found it way too bitter and didn't enjoy it. Now reviewing it after trying more bitter ales and stouts I think it isn't so bad. Wouldn't be easy for me to drink several of these, and they do have a higher ABV but I enjoy one at a time. A decent full-flavored IPA with a higher alcohol content than regular ones. Would be nice with a meal or just by itself on a hot day. I say it's quite good for an IPA, just not my favorite type of beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The malts appear on the palate only briefly, but they are complex and tasty, with a hint of nuttiness. There is a heavy bitter pine aftertaste.  M: Nicely carbonated and refreshing, with a very slight oiliness.  D: This is a satisfying, reasonably priced IPA for the serious hop-head.

140,30420,dimitrius,4.08,"Appearance - Beautiful orange color, when held up to the light runs the gamut from yellow to dark orange, each color warm and inviting. Looks to be a tasty beer.  Smell - Hops. Piney, citrusy, beautiful hops. The only fault I find in the smell is the lingering alcohol smell off of a deep whiff - which is almost not really a fault, considering the ABV. Big white head on the pour.  Taste - Hops again. Pine, citrus, with a little woodiness on the back end. Very refreshing on a hot day in Hawaii.  Mouthfeel - Honestly, I LOVE the way this beer feels in my mouth. Not too thin, not too thick, with just the right amount of carbonation. Excellent.  Drinkability - This is a very drinkable beer, even for someone who prefers dark beers. The hop taste is very pure in this beer. The only reason i scored it a 4 is because I can't session hoppy, slightly high ABV beers, personally.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,beerthulhu,3.7,"A: A glowing sunset orange sits well in the glass topped off by a sturdy 1 finger marshmellow head that was buff in color. Clarity was good, revealing a rapid presence of micro-bubble jet streams.  S: A touch of grassiness is experienced upfront, soon followed by a perfumy mixture of oranges, flowery citrus, and some faint grapefruit. The strength is rather reserved here per style. There is some sweetly toasted caramel grains peeking through underneath but is the hops that play the main role.  T: Spicy citrus and dry toasted caramel grains come to play on the open. Semi-dry grapefruit is fairly dominant with some grassy nature and flowery citrus that is both dry and assertive in delivery. Some lemon peels, piney interests also come through with a spicy bite of citrus on the swallow. The malting as with on the nose, comes off a bit thin taking a back seat to the hops and hardly offering any support or structure to the drink, almost to the point of being a non variable. Grassy-citrus alcohol tones warm you in the end with a flowery coating on the tongue.  M: The mouthful is warming with a good deal of citrus and grass being offered. The alcohol is also generous in nature with a medium carbonation bringing some crispness to the overall delivery. A flowery bite, dry and bitter of pine and conifer notes leaves with good intentions on the tongue.  D: Fairly bitter on the take, not as smooth or refined as their traditional pale providing a bit more hops and edginess intended for limited servings. will definitly fill your hop fix.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Kind of earthy, grassy, delicious. I was originally kind of underwhelmed but the flavors are changing as i get further down the glass. Hop flavor is lingering on my tongue and becoming more pronounced  M-Pretty clean mouthfeel although the complexity of the flavor and taste kind of mask it.

140,30420,WanderingFool,4.01,"Torpedo pours a clear, dark copper with a one finger creamy, white head on top. The foam dissolves slowly to a thick sheet on the surface and leaves behind a fair amount of lace on the glass. Inside the beer is a massive flurry of tiny bubbles racing to the surface.  The aroma is full of hops with notes of pine and orange citrus. There's a little bit of pale malt mixed in too.  Each sip of this medium bodied beer is soft on the palate, somewhat creamy with an effervescent fizz. The flavor is a well balanced blend of orange citrus, a touch of lemon zest and sweet pale malt. It finishes bitter with a touch of pepper spice. Once gone a lingering sweetness remains on the palate.  This is a tasty, well balanced beer with a creamy mouth feel.

I didn't get much of the malt in the taste, and the hops are solid herbal hops, a little bit of grapefruit maybe. Bitter all the way through to the last drop. Medium body with great carbonation.  I guess this is trying to be a palatable hop bomb, and it succeeds in that--I'll drink it again but I don't see it becoming one of my favorite or go-to IPAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: The smell is pretty upfront with floral, piney hops, but there is some malt in there too.  T: Malty with almost perfectly matched bitter hops. Somewhat more bitter than the regular pale ale but it balances with the added malt. Very good. I've had this beer many times and it's always very good.  M: Has a full bodied, carbonated feel in the mouth. Leaves a little bitter on the finish.  D: I love this IPA and try to keep it in my fridge.

Pale and bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste. The bitterness was just right. The malt profile was good and provide a nice backdrop. Overall, the taste was pretty damn good.

Taste: Slight maltiness up front, with tons of citrus following. Maybe slight pine as well, but the hop character in this beer is overwhelmingly in the citrus category. Dry finish. Very nice and refreshing.  Mouthfeel: A hair over light bodied with a good deal of carbonation. Not outstanding here, but still pretty nice. Slightly above average.

Read the other reviews of you want to know about color, head, etc. Ambitious hopping level kept in check by a generous malt body. The ABV is fairly well limited in light of the amount of malt flavor needed to keep this from capsizing with an overdose of hops.

I fully expected to be assulted with the classic IPA c-hops, but this is more sublime. Caramel malts are also present here.  T-The hop presence that cannot be detected in the nose is fully front and center in the taste. The hop bill here is more bitter than flavorful, but there is a hint of citrus rind behind the opening salvo of astringent bitterness and there is decent balance in the semi sweet malts. I bought a six of this and frankly did not think much of it when I pounded them down on ice on a hot summer day, but in taking the time to review this at proper temperature this is a pretty decent brew.  M-Well balanced overall. Medium mouth.  D-I'm totally on the fence on this one. If I'm driniking IPA's, I can think of a dozen that I'd rather have. If you factor availablity into the mix, it climbs the rungs.  Like SA, I'm not sure you can call SN craft brewing any longer, but that does not mean that the quality is lost. It is comforting to know that you can pull into any city and grab some SNPA, or even Torpedo, and not have to slog down some macrowater. Kudos to them, and thats why I'm probably rating this higher than I normally would based on my own personal enjoyment of the product.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Poured a nice head, tannish but more on the white side. Bubbles move at medium speed to the top of the glass, not too many of them.  S - Smells like and IPA should, strong. Hops and malts are prevalent. I smell pine and citrus, mostly pine. Hint of sweet caramel stays from beginning to end.  T - Taste is strong, like an IPA should taste. Very hoppy, and has that IPA bite to it. Bitter taste to it, and I'm loving this pine/citrus taste at the end of every sip. Very crisp. Carbonation is the right amount for this style of beer.  M - Mouthfeel is very carbonated. Leaves a crisp dry finish.  D - Drinkability is good for an IPA. When I drink IPA's I usually will only want to drink a couple, but I'll have no problem finishing the 6-pack of this tonight.  Good IPA, I'm happy I picked this up.

Maybe a little malt in their somewhere?  T - Tasted exactly as it smelled. The hops hit you right in the face. The pine and citrus notes were pretty well balanced with the hops. I distinctly remember grapefruit in the aftertaste. Pretty bitter overall.  M - Medium bodied with a pretty heavy carbonation. Bitterness clings to the palate. 7% and I sure didn't taste it.

140,30420,feelmefoam,4.03,"Torpedo Extra IPA pours a pale yet murky caramel color and boasts a finger of cream-colored head that consists of thick, pillowy foam and lasts for several minutes before dissipating, leaving nice thick lacing all around the glass.  The aroma mainly consists of pine and citrus, bolstered by a little breadiness towards the end of each whiff. A very hop-forward nose, which I appreciate, and you don't have to go searching for the smell as the beer is pretty fragrant.  Hop-forward on the tongue as well, I can immediately pick out some pine and citrus notes, as well as a bit of grassiness. The malt comes in later in the flavor, mostly manifesting itself as a slightly sweet glazed bread flavor. A little bitterness comes through towards the end of the draught, but nothing overwhelming.  Torpedo sports a dead-on medium body with a smoothness that is accentuated by just the right amount of carbonation, enough to tickle your tongue but not enough to overwhelm the flavor or be obnoxious in your mouth. The alcohol is very well-masked, I can't detect it anywhere in the beer.  Overall, a very solid IPA from Sierra Nevada. I've yet to try Celebration, and although I hear it's better, I wouldn't be disappointed if it were on the same level as Torpedo. A great beer, especially in the looks department, and the only thing that hurts its drinkability is the 7.2% ABV of the beer. Still though, a very well-balanced IPA that once again shows the quality of Sierra Nevada beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,davidaubrey,4.55,"Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is one of my favorite beers. Accordingly, I had high expectations for their ""Extra IPA"". While the beer is a fine pale ale, it is not quite as good as the regular pale ale in my opinion. It is has a sweeter taste, is very hoppy, but lacks that bitter hop taste of the other Sierra Nevada ale. I expected this one to be even stronger; like a real piney bite to the taste. Still, this is an extremely tasty beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

M - nice carbonation. Great slick mouthfeel. Full-bodied.  D - Not sure how to rate this, but it's drinkable for the style and ABV. Not as sessionable as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale though.

140,30420,MysticRuler,4.47,"A top notch effort from SN. the hoppiness is very well balanced....If I had to choose a word to describe the hoppiness I would use the word balanced. It starts out with a nice West Coast bitterness, but it isn't overwhelming or unhinged. The malt backbone is a nice foil which helps to bring it all together. It's a very finely crafted ale which highlights the greatness of using fresh hops. I'd love to see what it's like on draft.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,StephenRich,3.73,"When it comes to crisp, clean, malty refreshment, there are few breweries that have as much experience quenching our palates as does Sierra Nevada. Sierra Nevada set the presence for Pale Ales in America winning its first gold medal back in 1993 at the Great American Beer Festival. But they also have a bigger, richer more potent quencher on the roster; the Torpedo Extra IPA.  This really is a classic American style IPA with significant malt character and that undeniably fresh and citrus west coast hop flavor. The Torpedo comes in at 65 IBUs, almost double the Pale Ale's 37 - so you should expect a good bitter punch from this beer, but still nothing crazy. Like all their beers, the Torpedo utilizes only whole cone hops; no pellets and no extracts. Sierra Nevada prides themselves on this, and thus they spent years developing the recipe for this IPA before it was finally released in early 2009 as a year round offering.  I recently opened a bottle with my roommate after a long hard day in the heat - we both needed something to cleanly refresh our palates and sooth the heat out of us. I went right for the Torpedo Extra IPA. We opened it right away cold around 5C (40F), which really is a bit to cold for a big IPA of this sorts, but we both wanted a cold quenching beer - so it was perfect for us at the time. This is really key here, the Serving Temperature Guide is just that - a guide. Everyone has their own preference for what temperature they enjoy certain beer's at, and every specific scenario may warrant a variation on that preference. The guide is meanly a suggestion as a starting place; but really, let your palate guide your journey.  The Torpedo comes in Sierra's typical stubby 355ml bottle at 7.2% abv. I poured it generously into a Sierra Nevada pint glass and the beer erupted with life and excitement right away. First a golden orange beer brewed slowly in the bottom, but curling waves of carbonation rushed through the beer as the bottle was emptied. It created a transparent golden orange beer with honey and rich amber browns shining though it holding up a big fluffy and pillowy 1.5 inch off white, cream colored, almost pearl head. It was loaded with bubbles and air standing its place for a few minutes then eventually fading to a sticky lacing on the beer.  The nose shows a great fresh rush of classic west coat hops and rich citrus fruits. Its filled with pine up front and the classic tartness of grapefruit and lemon peels. It is very up front and bitter with a hint of zesty funk. There is soft caramel sweet malt in the background, and hints of pepper and spice, but this nose is definitely dominated by floral hops, as you should expect.  A big wave of cold Torpedo is fresh and quenching everywhere on your palate and opens into your mouth with smooth sweet malts and the quick rush of quenching earthy hops. There are no two ways around it, the hops push their way into your palate bringing with them bright aromas and crisp flavors. Pine and fresh grapefruit peel are most dominant and up front, but floral spices, herbs, earth and touches of tropical fruit sweetness also hit my cheeks and play back around to my lips.  Its not devastatingly bitter, I certainly have had bigger beers before, but the Torpedo conducts itself very precisely. The soft balance of smooth pale malts and gentle caramel create a delicious character and help ease the overall fresh bitter bite which dominated this beer. The mouthfeel is succulent and perfect as you should expect from Sierra Nevada by now. It is light and creamy with modest carbonation and a real tooth grabbing texture. It does make me want more.  The finish is crisp and short performing its duty with care. Fresh pine and citrus show again on the edge and dissipate all malt sweetness from your palate. Go in for spicy Vindaloo or big Thai dishes; the Torpedo Extra IPA will meet the sweetness of the sauce, and quench every range of heat you can conjure up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,wvsabbath,4,"Serving type - bottle  Apperance - Golden brown, yellow amber  Smell - Hops, Malts, some suagrs, very citrus, grapefruit, orange  Taste - A strong acidic midly strong hoppy flavor dominates this beer. Lots of orange and malts. I even get some lemon in there. I do get traces of alcohol in each drink.  Mouthfeel - A bit strong and bitey. Mouth gets bittered from hops, and a little numbed from the boose. Aftertaste is a little bitter and strong.  Overall - For me, sierra's beers are usually smooth and flavorful, and mild. Torpedo has a bite, its stronger and has more kick then usual sierra beers. Plenty of hops and malts make this a enjoyable ipa. At 7.2% its low enough to enjoy a few. A very soild beer that brings some strongness, and flavor to the table. Recomended for ipa and hop lovers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Chizoad,4.38,"For availability, this has to be one of the greatest beers around. I found this at a liquor store with a so-so selection, and have seen it many places that don't stock worthwhile brews. If you like the Hop Rod Rye but can't find that, this is a fantastic alternative.  Deep amber with a gloriously frothy head. Good lacing and excellent retention. Impressive from the start. Nice nose but it doesn't really prepare you for the taste. Malty and some hop goodness in there, but underwhelming.  Flavor is top notch, with a real depth to the malt that balances the hops perfectly. If anything it's a little less hoppy than I would like.  Excellent medium body that somehow didn't get too heavy. I took down three bottles in a nice session that certainly left me feeling the 7.2% ABV. Highly drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,WOTO97,4.17,"Real tasty stuff here. What the ""extra"" is, I can only conjecture. Extra tasty? Extra special? Maybe an allusion to the spice notes? At any rate this fella has a delicious and relatively complex hop profile.  The body is a bit more amber in color with a head that soon dissolves into a thin sudsy film. The lacing is a relatively dense web.  Nose is spicy, floral, pine resin, and a generous citrus dose along with a noteworthy bread crust note in the background.  Flavors mirror the nose for the most part. Followed up Big Daddy from Speakeasy with this one, so the flavors, specifically the spice notes, really popped for me. Some pepper, maybe even parsley, is noticeable. Citrus and pine are very present here; the citrus has a bit more sweet bitterness than the nose. While allowing a big hop bombardment, the malt profile is strong enough to provide some balance. Slight biscuit and fresh bread characteristics here.  The body on this beer is just about perfect, if not a bit too dense. Has a nice lingering feel to remind you what you got in your hands.  This beer is so solid, as are most in their arsenal.

From the Sierra beers I've had I tend to find something in a typical or signature flavor; with this one, I wouldn't necessarily pin this down as a Sierra Nevada beer, which is a nice feature.

The beer is a tawny orange. As you drink the beer, the sides of the glass becomes covered with lace and the top of the beer is lightly covered with the same. The aroma is one that is strong with hops, not overpowering, but perfect for a strong IPA. I feel that this is a complex beer, but it has a nice light mouthfeel.

To be honest, too bitter to identify any distinct tastes. Not sure what pine tasts like, but there was a taste that I can only define as pine.  It's highly astringent in the mouth. It's bitter from beginning to end. Will certainly put hair on your chest.  This is a man's beer. It's very strong in its bitterness and has a lot of alcohol, though I didn't get much alcohol burn.

140,30420,climax,4.4,"Been meaning to try this one for too long now, especially for how readily available it is. It poured a bronze/copper with a massive head that cratered with the remaining pour. The retention was excellent as was the thick lace covering the rim of my pint glass.  The aroma definitely let me know it wasn't a typical IPA, as the hop bill is quite distinct and unusual. Minty floral and grassy tones rivaled grapefruit and soapiness for hop supremacy. The toasty malt backbone definitely sits on the bench, but it's presence is noble.  The flavor held the same good qualities that the smell started. Juicy citrus flavor creeps in as the initial whack of grass and soap subside. Red apple mealy flavor begins to shift the beer from bitter to sweet. Sweetness from the malt finds it's way in towards the finish and as the beer warms. Complex to say the least.  Creamy and thick, the body slides it's way around. The carbonation is mild, and does not distract from viscous feel. The finish is sticky and has a grassy dryness, that can only be described as if you were to just eat grass.... That being said, the hops used in this brew are not typical, and may be hit or miss.

Pours a bright copper with a great sticky head. Heck, I could spend just hours looking at this beer, it's that pretty. Aroma is pretty all hops. You get booming amounts of pine with some grassy citrus notes. The first sip lets you know you're in for a hop treat, but the bitterness doesn't kill the tongue. Some IPAs are so assertive that they basically strip the enamel from your teeth, but this beer never approaches those levels. Instead it goes the opposite direction. The mouthfeel from this beer is almost oily from all the hops, but it works. There has to be malt there to keep it balanced but I can't find it. There's a terrific lingering bitterness in the finish.

Drinkability: For six bucks a six pack and a lot of flavor and great feel, this will be an easy beer to pick up again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,kelticblood,3.94,"Nice bronze color with plenty of white foamy lacing. Clear with no cloudiness or sediment. Wasn't much head to speak of, but still looked pretty good. Nice deep hop aroma with hints of sweet malt. First sip will make you pucker for sure especially if it's your first beer of the day. Intense bitterness that lingers and isn't going away anytime soon. Hops and bitterness overshadow anything as for flavors. There is a little hint of a light sweet malt. Very dry with a lacking carbonated crispness. Moderate ABV that's well-hidden making it an average drinkability. If you need a hop fix here's your medicine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,rtepiak,3.85,a typical ipa with a peppery dry hop quality. and a hint of jasmine. an amber that is of the style... clear with a nice lacy head. the peppery quality is something that really puts the beer on a different level in that it has a different texture then most drying qualities... its soapy. interesting hop character. it extremely dry. and so floral its contorting on the palate. yet still have as grain and malt character. nose of lemongrass and pine resin. feel is a bit off when agitated or old though.  makes the abv stand out in a stale sharpness in the finish,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,MikeBrandman,4.08,"A - Poured into a Gordie Schooner glass with a nice brown body with a hint of honey and amber tones. Body is transparent with a strong haze. Head is a nice slightly offwhite foamy pillow that sticks around quite well and leaves a good amount of lacing.  S - Smell is a little weak. Slight pine hop smell with a hint of minty freshness. As it warms, lemony esters come out. Good smelling beer, just wish it was a little stronger.  T - Wow. Great hop punch to this beer. Sweet as it rolls over the tongue, but slowly the bitterness settles in. Great balance of citrusy hops, piney hops (stronger than citrusy), and malts. Fresh malty taste. Very refreshing. One of my favorite tastes from a AIPA so far.  MF - Thick and creamy. Almost feels like a nitro. Carbonation isn't too strong. Adds a good bite to the beer.  D - Great drinkability. Refreshing, smooth, and complex. Can be a bit of a palette buster, however.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,AleWatcher,3.83,"Reviewed from notes:  Pours a copper/orangey toasty color with a 2.5 finger white cap with huuuge retention and lacing. The head is like the color white that a vintage guitar that was originally in Olympic White looks when it has aged for 30 years. (if you know vintage guitars, then you know that is a compliment).  Smell has some sweet bready malts and some doughy yeast notes. Neither holds a candle to the big floral fresh hoppiness that SN has become known for.  On the taste I can tell that I've had fresher Torpedo... But I get those bready notes with the grapefruit and slight pine notes from the hops. a good solid bitterness.  Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation.  This scores high on drinkability--- I will be more than happy to pour one of these",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,kwjd,4.12,"It pours a deep copper colour with about half an inch of head. Smell is hard hitting citrus and pine hops. I'd believe it was a double IPA from the smell.

This is an IPA that I could frequently drink and not be tired of it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Baraka,4.55,"Pours a copper color with an impressive head that stains the side of my glass with lacing. Nose is dominated by citrus and piny hops, but i can just pick out a hint of sweet malt. My first sip is filled with an impressive amount of hop bitterness as well as the citrus and pine flavors that made up the nose. While there is certainly some malt sweetness to balance it a bit, this is still a very hop-driven beer.  Quite an impressive beer from the always top-notch Sierra Nevada. One of my staples since its release in early 2009, and a fantastic value as well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,InsolublePancake,3.58,"A- Deep gold with brownish/orange tinge. Decent head upon pouring dissipates into a persistent ring of lace. Lots of sticking lacing is left on the side of the glass.  S- Nice grapefruit and tea leaf hop character. A touch of bready malt is perceptible under the hops, but it's not particularly strong. This beer is clearly all about the hops.  T- Strong, leafy, raw hops dominate the taste. The malt doesn't play much of a part in the taste; one gets the feeling that it is only there out of necessity, in order to keep the hops from running rampant and causing an unpleasant, acrid bitterness. It manages to accomplish this, but just barely. The bitterness is rather high. A little more malt to back it up would be ideal.  M- Medium-bodied and with a good carbonation level. No complaints.  D- Not too bad, although the bitterness wore on me after a while. Plus, the alcohol is a bit high. I'd limit myself to one on most occasions, although I could envision a scenario in which I'd have a couple.  This beer seems like a cross between an IPA and a DIPA. It has the hop character of a DIPA and the malt character of an IPA (or even an APA, perhaps). I suppose that's what Sierra Nevada was implying when it labeled this an ""Extra IPA."" While it's a good beer, I'm afraid its lack of balance prevents it from being a great beer. It just seems like it doesn't quite know what it is. Still, I'd recommend it to any hop lover. It's just not my favorite. I much prefer Celebration.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T - Grapefruit citrussy flavor has a very strong and agressive prescense. It hits you upfront and its stays through the finish. Some spice notes linger in the background, muted but not unnoticed.

140,30420,uberabr,3.93,"Pours clear amber, great carbonation. Creamy vanilla head with moderate lacing. Aroma isn't crazily hoppy...it's kind of spicy, some malty tones. Pretty average in this respect.  Taste is great. Rather heavy in the mouth, it's got a creamy, buttery feel. Fairly bitter, not outrageously so but you can tell it's an IPA. I tend to prefer the really bright, outrageously hopped California IPAs, and this one is a little more refined. You don't get as much of that dominant grapefruit citrus. But it's still very enjoyable and fruity. Citrus, sour green apple, and a sugary malt play with the piney hop bite. That buttery malt follows through. There's a sort of refined candy taste that mixes well with the bitters. A very drinkable IPA at a solid price that packs a good amount of booze. I'm a fan.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Very nice beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Pittsburgh,4.21,"Nice pour, heavy foam, takes a while to cool down, golden amber color, not cloudy like other IPAs, my first try of the double dry hopped style, and I must say I like it.  More of a clean and crisp IPA, tastes almost organic or grassy, like the ingredients are very pure and you can taste them. Strong hop presence, more of a golden IPA leaning towards a pale ale, but not as bitter if that makes any sense.  At first, I was not sure about it, but after I got into it I liked it more and more, and I think it is very smooth for an IPA, and it is different than most others I have had.  Definitely worth a try, I liked their Hop Harvest a little better, but this is still strong to very strong in my opinion. Give it a shot. Very cost friendly in a six pack. Drinkability is there, very smooth for an IPA.  I also must say Sierra Nevada is a very solid brewery, sometimes because they are so widely available I stray from trying them, but they make alot of very solid beers and I am rarely disappointed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T- bitter piney goodness...not too overwhelming, though. The finish sticks for awhile...only 65 IBU? What a bunch of crap, seems a hell of a lot higher than that. I'm getting some bitter grapefruit in there, but its mostly just pine...pretty good, if not a little unoriginal.  M- feel is decent...its got some thickness to it.

T: In the great words of Usher... ""Make me wanna say... Oh My Gosh.""

IPA character immediately manifests in the aroma of sweet citrus-infused hops.  Flavor is even hoppier than the smell had indicated. Assertively hopped but with a smoothness characteristic of Sierra Nevada. It is heavy enough to boldly blast its flavor onto your tongue, but smooth enough to invite copious consumption. At 7.2%, this will get you drunk very quickly.  Though I would prefer Stone IPA any day, Torpedo is a solid alternative when it's around, especially in 12-pack form.

140,30420,abriggs1,4.47,"Sierra Nevada hits another Home Run. Lately they've been stepping up their game even more. Their spring seasonal, Glissade was wonderful, and Torpedo has been a resounding success; so much so that when they first released it no one could even keep it on the shelves. There was a ""problem"" of too much demand and not enough supply, but now it's readily available.  A great beer at a great price. Appearance is rich and colorful with a nice buttery yellow head. The smell is great; tons of grapefruit, restrained pine, and caramel. The taste is very sharp and balanced at the same time, a quality in an ipa that I believe is very hard to get just right. At 7.2% there's some warmth from the boose, but it's still pretty hidden. Goes down way too fast for how strong it is.  This is a great beer for all seasons. Crisp, sharp, and refreshing.

Sierra Nevada Torpedo Ale is a big American IPA; bold, assertive and full of flavor and aromas highlighting the complex citrus, pine and herbal character of whole-cone American hops.  This (above) is the promotion. Pretty on target except it's not particularly ""big"" these days compared to all of the monster IPAs that are di rigeur.

Ok, maybe some in the middle there. The quality, that I dont like in IPA's exists in this one, however it's not too strong, which is the type of bitterness in the aftertaste. I'm not sure how to describe it, but I'm thinking pesticides or something. Maybe that is what I'm tasting, but somehow I doubt it. Maybe it's the type of hops or malt.  The middle is nice though.

Smell: Bready and hoppy. A seemingly simple, to-the-point brew in terms of aroma.  Taste: Bitter. The bitterness was not present in the nose. Piney hops dominate the flavor profile before giving way to a subtle malty sweetness. Just a solid all-around IIPA.  Mouthfeel: Fresh, smooth, and crisp. The body does not overwhelm the palette and the alcohol is certainly presented within context.  Drinkability: Goes down easily, leaving the drinker wanting more.

140,30420,DovaliHops,4.59,"Never reviewed this beer before because it is one of my ""go-to"" beers that I drink on the regular. I decided to review this time because this happened to be the best tasting and most fresh batch I think I've ever tasted. This had to have been bottled no longer than a week ago. Pours a slightly cloudy orange/golden colr with a beautiful head that slowly minimizes. The smell on this batch of Torpedo is AMAZING. Definitely one of the strongest floral scents I have ever gotten out of an IPA. Along with strong hop and citrus smell. Upon touching my tongue I get immediate sweetness...a bit of candy sugars along with honey. Then followed by a strong bitter citrusy backbone. Then the sweetness comes back and lingers on the back of the tongue for a bit. The mouthfeel is close to perfect with a nice chewiness to it, but crisp at the same time. I really really really enjoyed this Torpedo. If only all the batches could taste like this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,AgentMunky,4.12,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pilsner glass.  A: Dusty honey-coloured beer with ridiculous amounts of bubbles and a huge expansive head which insists on sticking around. Heavy lacing.  S: Impressive. Crisp hops dominate the nose, buttressed by heavy citrus and faint pine.  T: Huh. It's really good, but not quite what I expected. The taste is quite mellow and smooth, with a gentle sweetness rounding out the flavour. The hops are present, of course, but as a subtle compliment to the malty main body. The aftertaste is really the only place bitterness appears as piney hops leave the mouth just a tad dry.  M: Pleasant. As described in the taste, the mouthfeel is mostly malty and smooth, with a hoppy dryness toward the tail end.  D: Quite good, though all told I think I prefer Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. Torpedo is a bit stronger than I realised, but this is a point in its favour, I feel. Recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TheSarge,4.06,"Produces a great two finger thick head that is off white in color, and retains quite well. The body is orange gold and pretty hazy.  The aroma is light but floral and citrus characteristics are what stand out the most.  The taste is well balanced with bitter and citrus tasting hops on the forefront, but a hint of toffee is there too.

140,30420,brewerburgundy,4.16,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a weizen glass. Tasting notes from late August 2009.  A: Pours absolute amber orange with three fingers of dimply head. I don't see any rising carbonation. Settles to a quarter inch, bone colored. 4  S: Resinous pine and sweet citrus, there might be some very feety malt in the background. A bit floral. 4  T: Hops, hops, orange rind, and grapefruit astringency. Like a grapefruit seed facial cleanser I once used. I could wash my face with this. Sweeter as it warms but still finishes with coating bitter grapefruit. 4  M: A little oily, slick, coating. 4  D: Overall; not really balanced, a bit more malt wouldn't hurt this beer. I enjoy it however and will re-review next time I get some. 3.5  6/15/10, 12oz bottle, Sam Adams glass, bottled on 11 April 2010 or '0111'. Current scores reflect this more recent review, as my palate has changed significantly.  This is a great looking IPA, and in the Sam Adams glass the pour turned out perfectly with a solid three fingers of yellowed ivory head on top of the glistening orange copper body. The lacing is fantastic.  While not nearly as intense in aroma or taste as my first time out with this beer, I still get lovely big grapefruit rounds that have been zested. Now, however, I can tell that there is malt and that that malt has a biscuit character.  The flavor is still big on grapefruit and I now pick up lemon zest, biscuit, mint, and something rougher that might be tobacco-like. The bitterness is still big but doesn't destroy me.  It's dry without being thin and I think that the carbonation helps there. Last night I had my first Oskar Blues Gordon and the carbonation was a real problem; more bubbles would have made it a vastly more enjoyable drink.  I love these 7% American IPAs for the most part and I usually get more of a buzz than I'd like from them.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TK5150,3.8,"A- Pours topaz/amber with a small off-white head. Great lacing on the glass as I swirl.  S- Lemon and grapefruit come through first. A hint of orange. Very herbal and floral. Bready malt backs everything up.  T- Piney resinous bitterness, lemons, grapefruit, and an herbal quality that I find in most Sierra Nevadas...with bready malt to balance. Not intense or in-your-face, but a solid effort here.  M- Medium bodied, nice bite from the hops, palatable. Not particularly rich, but this is an IPA.  D- I see myself picking up a couple six packs over the summer as a nice, easy drinking IPA (especially at such a cheap price). I could drink a few of these on a nice summer day.  Overall, I like it. A good beer for summer. I don't think they need to call it an ""Extra IPA"", as this is more of a standard version in my opinion.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,klikger,4.57,"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass  A - Medium-dark shade of amber with a substantial amount of off-white head and very good lacing.  S - Grapefruit, pine, and tart orange  T - Citrus hops are detected within a nanosecond, and a fair amount of creamy, sweet malts quickly follow. This adds just the right amount of offset to the stunningly bitter hops, which are dominant throughout. The finish is pine and a lot of it - distinctive, refreshing, and truly a thing of beauty. It continues on the palate for minutes.  M - Nicely carbonated, medium-bodied, and delightfully crisp. So fresh and so clean clean.  D - Easy to drink for how intense the flavor is.  This is an incredible beer, and I'm pretty mad at myself for not having bought any for several months. There are several IPAs with higher BA scores, more buzz, etc., but don't make the mistake of overlooking this beer. Torpedo and Sierra Nevada's winter seasonal Celebration Ale are *by far* the best American IPAs for the money. I vow to keep this a fixture in the fridge from this day forward.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Fengzi,4.64,"what matters most 'to me' is the taste and how well it holds in the mouth. Not for the average person on the smell and the what I'd like to call (coin) I-P-A-ness, which is just what you expect from a IPA; bitter with a hint of a bite. It's almost like a real -cocont (mins the sweet); bitter and strong.

140,30420,vette2006c5r,4.7,"Sierra Nevada Torpedo poured a copper color with a good sized head. It smells almost like gin, a very strong pine smell, and also very hoppy.

140,30420,kosmoraios,3.5,"Pours a clear deep amber/copper color with plenty of carbonation evident in the glass. 1.5-finger head dissipates slowly leaving ample lacing down the glass throughout the experience.  Aroma is immediately of citrus and pine hops with grapefruit and a hint of lavender in the nose.  Taste is of citrus and piney hops with some herbal and floral notes. Nicely peppery on the tongue.

Smells of floral and piney hops but the scent is a little underwhelming. Taste is a refreshing break from the typical citrusy hop bomb. Lots of floral and pine notes with hints of citrus and a faint malty sweetness in the finish to provide a bit of balance. A very drinkable beer, although its 7.2% it doesn't really feel it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TheHoppiest,4.13,"Gave an aggressive pour from a 12 oz bottle into an oversized snifter. Pours a deep amber color with a thick creamy head over 1"" thick. As the head reduces, it leaves an almost soapy film down the side of the glass and on top of the beer.  Smells of pine, citrus, sappy-tar and hops. The smell stays with this beer throughout; it doesn't get up and leave like with so many other beers.  A nicely bitter, hoppy taste greets the tongue and stays with it throughout the experience of this beer. Beyond the hops, there is a sweet, almost honey like malt underneath. For as strong a beer as this is (7.2%), it has a rather crisp taste to it, making it go down wayyyy to easy.  It has a bitter aftertaste which sticks to the tongue and dries out the mouth. Mouthfeel starts sharp, and ends dry.  A very drinkable beer, one which I've bought a few times this year if only to make sure I can share it with friends. Try it!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bourbonbock,4.03,"Poured a bottle into a clean pilsner glass and was treated to an tarnished copper colored beer with about 1.5 fingers of head. The head receded after a few minutes to a cap and left a ring around the glass in its place.  This beer smells wonderful and fresh. Floral, pine and citrus hop smells are dominant. The first sip is heavy on the tongue and hits the tongue hard with hoppy bubbles and ends with a hop oil and salty aftertaste. Good malt body backs up the bitterness on the after taste.  Each sip continues to leave lacing along the glass which is one of my favorite sights after drinking a beer.  I would definitely pick up another 6 pack of this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Agold,4.07,"This beer is a very nice amber color with two and a half fingers of fluffy white head. Fairly good lacing on this one. The first thing I smell with this beer is fresh piney hops with a citrus twist to it. Very nice hop character in the nose. The nose is reflected a lot in the taste of this beer, except I'm missing a bit of the citrus that I was hoping for. The mouthfeel is good, but I think it is a bit over-carbonated for me, but medium bodied nonetheless.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste is kind of plain, no malt, tons of bitter, lingering bitter after taste. I love IPAs, but this seems to have no balance, and nothing special, maybe even a bit watery. Little bit of alcohol taste too.  Mouthfeel is a bit papery, slightly oily.  The wateryness makes it pretty drinkable though, ""tastes meh! less filling!""  I like Sierra Nevada just as much as the next guy, and I've heard nothing but good for Torpedo. As an IPA I guess this is pretty good by-the-books, but to me, it's pretty forgettable.  I'll definitely finish it tho.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,3HovsepiansBrews,3.19,"As a preface, I am a huge fan of SN, but I think they fell short with this brew.  A - Beautiful amber with a nice white head.  S- Doesn't really have too much of an aroma for such a highly hopped beer.  T- Sierra Nevada was a little disappointing with this one. With so much potential with tasty Cascade hops, they overdid the bittering to the point where you can't get the usual fruity sweetness from the west coast hops. All you taste is a bitterness that coats your entire mouth and stays with you.  M- Nice crisp texture with some carbonation.

Two fingers worth of head that is very chunky looking with big bubbles.  s - Has a roasty smell with mellow hints of hops.  t - Considering how strong Sierra Nevada's regular pale ale is, I was surprised by how mellow this IPA is. Hops are very balanced with that roasted pine taste.  m - Medium bodied, more noticeable in the back of the mouth than on the tongue.  d - All around a great IPA. Very smooth and balanced.

Mouth- Tastes piney and hoppy, bitterness sticks around for a little bit after a sip.  Mouthfeel- Feels nice and smooth, a little oily.

140,30420,matjack85,2.76,"I found this at the local Jewel-Osco store in Glendale Heights, IL. for $9.99 a six pack. This is a new Sierra Nevada product for me so I was anxious to open one up and give it a try.  The beer poured a clear copper/orange color that made a 2½ finger creamy white head that lasted several minutes. It also left an incredible amount of lacing on the glass. A perfect 5.0 as far as appearance goes.  One sniff and there is no doubt that this is an IPA. It has a really nice hoppy smell - a mix of pine and citrus. Not much malt in the smell but the hops are nice. So far so good.  Oh no. What started out so promising falls completely apart in the taste department. The combination of 7.2% alcohol added to the huge amount of piney hops make this taste like I'm drinking Pine Sol cleaner. I wish there was more of a citrus hop presence to this to cut into the pine, but there isn't. There is also a serious lack of malt for balance. This is all alcohol and pine. At 65 IBUs I expect a good dose of bitterness, and bitterness is usually a good thing. I love most IPAs, but this one just doesn't have the right mix of bitter flavors. It needs to be balanced with other flavors besides the pine and the alcohol. The aftertaste is all alcohol. Don't get near a flame when breathing out or your breath might catch on fire.  The mouthfeel is on the smooth and creamy side but with a lot of carbonation to make it kind of spritzy as well. It's medium bodied in its thickness and makes no effort to hide the 7.2% alcohol content.  I'm not a fan of this one, although looking thru the other reviews I see a lot of people are, so be your own judge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Brief neck label describing the composition, and intent of the brew. Shows some batch codes, but not a legible freshness or bottling date. Notes Alc. by Vol. (7.2%) Poured into a tulip glass.  A - Pale to medium amber pour with a rich frothy head, good retention and nice lacing.  S - Fair aroma, not too assertive, but with a nice hoppy citrus range, touch of herbs, a bit malty and generally pleasing.  T -Taste follows with a good hoppy profile, a bit subdued, and it leans a bit to bitter rather than to hoppy ranges at times. Fortunately some citrus, and resin hop touches return to the surface to provide a good balance.  M - Medium to medium-light, there is a bit of a thin edge but does not quite fall there, good carbonation and a nice finishing bite.  D - Works rather well and it is nice to drink it. Good one to have around if not particularly noticeable.  Notes: A nice offering from Sierra Nevada.

The taste is very hoppy, not much malt presence. Very citrusy like one would expect. A slight warming in my stomach. Finishes dry.  The mouthfeel is medium, with a American pub carbonation to it.

Not in this case.  The bitter citrus hops are like a depth charge and combined with a moderate carbonation -- it's an all-hands-on-deck experience that makes one of the best commercially-available beers.

140,30420,jeffthecheff,3.8,"Date code is 0111. About 2 months from bottling.  Pours a copper color with a billowing white head off a straight pour. This one took a lot of time to pour, but produced a tight, thick head and a good amount of lively bubbles.  The nose has moderate to high level of hoppiness, with fruity and pine aromas making up the classic AIPA character. The citrus aspect reminds me of lemon and grapefruit, while grass and pine makes up the plant-like side. This has a good aroma, but more strength and maybe some less traditional IPA aromas would have taken it to the next level.  There is some moderate caramel sweetness up front and a high level of bitterness in the back. Even with the high quality sweetness, the overall character is dry, with the hops helping that cause. Grass and pine flavors come through in the hop flavor, with a bit of an herbal bite on the back.  With a straight pour, I knocked out a lot of carbonation, but was still left with a lively mouthfeel on top of a medium body. This has good drinkability for such a high strength IPA. The only thing this beer does great is hitting the style spot on.

Spicy, floral, and grassy hops. Light citrus and grapefruit flavors that lingers on. Some bitterness in the finish. Though it is never over barring. Sweet caramel malt with a bread and biscuit flavor balances everything out nicely. M/D: A medium body and carbonation. Crisp and dry. Pretty easy to drink. The alcohol is a bit high, bordering on a DIPA. Though it is well hidden, that is just a tad warming.  This is excellent. One of my favorite offerings from Sierra Nevada.

Not much malt to speak of. Definitely a west coast IPA. Dry finish. Not super complex, but nice for a single IPA.  M - A bit creamy, full enough to not taste like hop juice. Nice carbonation levels.

140,30420,irishking1977,4.4,"Sierra Nevada has some hit or miss beers, IMO. Their Kellerweis was pretty good, yet the Bigfoot barleywine missed the mark for me. Their Summer ale is decent, yet their pale ale reminds me of celery and cigarettes. I remember having the Torpedo once, and enjoyed it. Taking a closer look this time.  A: Pours a clear amber hue with a thick, white moderate head that leaves decent lacing. Nice looking, typical IPA.  S: Hops, pine, grapefruit and a hint of caramel all come into play in the aroma. Nothing is overwhelming; seems pretty well balanced. That's a good thing.  T: Pungent hops, yet not biting or overwhelming. They linger on the palate for some time, but again, isn't as paralyzing as some really hoppy beers. Citrus and a nice, moderate malt background -which includes some caramel flavors- are also found. This one is well balanced with the bitter hops and sweetness of the malt.  M: Good carbonation. Moderately oily and thick. Hops bitterness is prickly on the palate for quite some time.  D: Refreshing. Fairly quaffable, despite a massive hops atttack and above average ABV. Not your typical session beer, but certainly many craft beer drinkers would not have a problem finishing off a six pack.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Nicely carbonated.  S - Sour citrus smell  T - Nice initial bitterness with a little bit of maltiness in the finish. Bitterness sticks with you for awhile. Almost a bitter grapefruity aftertaste. Alcohol flavor is well masked by the hops and malt.  M - Very smooth with the exception of the bitter aftertaste.  D - Good beer for the early summer.

A sipper to enjoy as it warms a bit from the fridge.

Feels slightly heavy in the mouth.  d-not a beer you can drink all night because of the strong flavor and alcohol content.

140,30420,everetends,4.06,"Picked up a sixer of this at Smokin' Joes in Jacksonville, AL. Yes, this has finally made it to my area! Was stoked when the owner told me he had a new IPA for me. He is just as excited about new beers as I am. I served this up in a standard, Terrapin pint glass.  A: The pour results in a bronze colored body. Held to the light, more yellows come out. The body is pretty clear with a lazy, but consistent carbonation moving around in here. The pour built up almost two fingers of foamy white head. It falls slowly to a creamy top cap as the experience goes on. Good amount of lace sticks to the glass and sheets it all the way down.  S: The smell is a little more faint than I expect from an IPA. Getting some herbal hop notes to start things off. Pretty earthy actually. Behind that are the citrus notes in the form of lemon zest and skin. There is some malt balance here in the nose. Bring out some sweet and bready malts to balance out the aroma and it almost neutralizes it. Slightly unimpressed here.  T: Where it falls short in the nose, it makes up for in flavor. This beer just comes out to be a very solid IPA. Getting the citrus hops up front and in some abundance. Getting some lemon, grapefruit (bitter, bitter, not sweet or sour at all), and a touch of tangerine. There are some herbal and floral notes building as well behind all this citrus. Malts are coming out mostly bready, but there is a slight caramel sweetness as well. Its not balanced but it does cut the initial bitterness in the flavor, and then allows the bitterness to develop slowly to the aftertaste.  M: This beer is on the lighter side of medium, but has a nice weight to it. It is a little sticky and oily, coats lightly on the palate. ABV is not really coming out to me at all. Wonderfully hidden. Bitter on the palate mostly. Aftertaste is lingering lemon and grapefruit.  D: This is wonderfully easy to put down. I can drink this all day long to be honest. It has a balancing quality to it that makes it easy drinking, but still has that hop bitterness I want. I only wish the aroma had a bit more to it, but can't win em all. Overall a great beer and another sleeper for me from Sierra Nevada. Damn happy to finally have it on demand in my area.

140,30420,Bouleboubier,4.4,"Feeling an IPA the other day. Beer dude at my favorite local store suggested this. Glad he did.  The head formed in this strange pattern - big-bubble islands enveloped in a delta-like system of smaller-bubble channels. The color is a deep sunset orange and evokes a feeling of (the sun setting in) summertime - around 8:25pm on a day at the end of the third week in July, specifically. Somewhere in SoCal...anyway...  Very vibrant, verdant aroma. Detected something like a campfire and/or toasted almonds, pungent pine, hints of overripe cantaloupe. I also saw a color - dark forest green. The label?  A generous swig rewards you with a refreshing hop blast. You feel it throughout your mouth and out the nostrils - a similar experience to a gnashing on a few sprigs of spicy mint. And it's actually not at all excessive. Combined with a medium-body malt body that's thankfully not syrupy sweet, the 7.2 is barely discernible. Testament to how well-balanced this brew is.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,RppIII,4.12,"Poured from a 12ounce bottle into a pint glass  Appearance- Poured a lackluster pale copper tea with a vigorous lively two fingered head that fades to a thin coating. Lacing is exceptional bringing back fond memories of past beer.  Smell- Not nearly the intense hop nose I had expected from this brew. A very sweet quality to this beer is present and almost as poignant as the citrus and fruit essence from the hops. A woody note presents itself in conjunction with a slight whiff of phenols reminding me of fine Scotch whisky.  Taste- Not as sweet as the nose would have lead me to believe but still enough malty sweetness to provide good contrast against the hop profile. A strong bite of bitter earth tones plays in contrast to a sweet grapefruit and citrus. A wood, vanilla flavour accents the sweet malt to create a very pleasing taste.  Mouthfeel- Aesthetically very pleasing with a medium body, crisp clean carbonation, and a slight drying effect.  Drinkability- A very drinkable beer, balanced, with a strong malt backbone. Sierra Nevada has a characteristic flavour to every beer they brew and this beer most certainly has that flavour.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

It's too much hop finish. The pine taste is right at the beginning and is a nice start, but the swallow leaves a terrible bitter aftertaste.  M- Carbonated for sure, feels light and almost bubbly in the mouth.  D- I didn't like this one so my drinkability is going to be lower.

S - On the floral side, definite hop character.  T - Ironically it is more akin to a British IPA than an American IPA; the hops never did come out and punch you in the face. All things considered though this is still a great brew, there is almost no malt for sweetness but the hops are balanced enough to offer a somewhat citrus beginning and a spicy finish which makes up for the moderate bitterness.  M - Satisfying heaviness and warmth as it swashed around in my mouth and went down.

You can really taste a pine-ish tone to it with just the right amount of bitterness to complement it.

The beer was a wee bit too far on the opaque side.  Smell: I just don't get a whole lot in the bouquet. I expect a lot more from an american double ipa. I'm looking for big esters or florals, but its subtle. I get a little grapefruit and pine.  Taste: There is that big hop assault on your palate that you would expect and want from a IPA. The pine comes through with nice florals. However, I would like to get more of the grapefruit and esters to come through in the taste.  Mouthfeel: This is where this beer excels. The carbonation, the bitterness- it is a wonderful moment when it hits your tongue, cheeks, and throat. It makes your mouth feel alive and completely engaged in the drinking experience.

140,30420,DCDevilDancer,3.75,"Overall, a nice (oddly) balanced American IPA. Looks good. Smells good.. a tad sweet, but a nice floral, fruity hoppy nose. In terms of taste, the finish is really nice.. notes of ambrosia, pineapple and mouth tingling herbs as it fades into a lingering bitterness. Upfront, however, there is a cotton candy sweetness that really bugs me. The flavors manage to balance eachother out, but I prefer less of those banana sweet spikes in my 7% range IPAs. Mouthfeel is messed up a little, consequently. Still drinks just fine.. the fresher the better. Considering it's price and availability, depending on where you are it may be a good choice. But IMO it is not even in the same league as the likes of Green Flash West Coast, Ska Modus Hoperandi, Surly Furious, or even New Belgium Ranger. Then again, I like a more earthy, consumingly abrassive IPA. I do think it is well worth seeking Torpedo out if the likes of Bell's Two Hearted is in your faves.. reminds me of it quite a bit.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: One of my favorite types of beers is an IPA and this is one of my favorite tasting IPAs. Right when it hits your tongue it is sweet, but the bitter hoppiness jumps in and builds. It leaves a great earthy aftertaste that remains for a long time.  M: A little heavier mouthfeel than most IPAs. Has a good level of carbonation.  D: I could put back a six pack of these.

Delicious pine, mild grapefruit rind. All could be summed up as a woodsy/herbal/citrus nature lover perfume. Total perfume. Becomes sensually heavy as it warms.

140,30420,blackwelma01,4.75,"This was possibly one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Drinking this has inspired me to plant a few magnum hop rhizomes in my backyard in a feeble attempt to clone. The aroma is absolutely breathtaking - compliments of the generous dry hopping. Strong citrus and pine. I poured my first beer in my kitchen, went into the bedroom for a few minutes, and could literally smell the hops in the air when I came back. Carbonation and head retention were just where they should be (when poured). Taste was strong, without being overpowering. Not one of those IPA's where you can smell the hops but barely taste them. Part of this is because Sierra Nevada uses whole cone hops instead of pellets or hop extract. Strong pine/citrus flavors, with a rounded malt profile, slightly bready. I've found that this beer lends itself well to being consumed directly from the bottle (sacrilegious in some circles - but allows you to approach the beer from a new perspective).

But this was something that was at least a bit different and something I would have again!  Poured into my open glass, it's an orange color with a nice head that sticks around. Looks really good, and much brighter than expected.  Smell is subdued a touch. This new citra hop has some tropical hints, some pineapple and mango. But it's just not jumping out at me.  Taste is nice though. Toasty caramel malt provides a touch of sweetness while the dry hops give a citrus kick. Grapefruit and pine, touch of earthyness or spice too. Something different from SN - yay!  Mouthfeel is good. Adaquate carb and the body is actually really nice, just enough malt but not too heavy.

Conclusion: Just to let you know where I'm coming from - IPAs are my favorite beer style and I've tried a bunch. I won't rate a beer unless I've had it several times to ensure that I'm not catching one that was old or not properly stored.  This is one of my favorite beers along with Three Floyd's Alpha King (I don't care what they call it - its an IPA not an APA), Bell's Two-Hearted Ale and Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA.

140,30420,runfoodrun,4.11,"Poured from a bottle into a Urthel Tulip Glass  A:Rich, deep orange, very nice lacing on the glass.  S: A bit weak here, not much of a smell..bitter, a bit of citrus.  T: Awesome! Lots of citrus for an IPA, but just bitter enough to keep it interesting from the tip of the tongue to the aftertaste.  M: Bitter, just heavy enough to be interesting, not thin which is a huge plus. I'm a huge non-chill filtered scotch fan, the more bite on the tongue the better.  D: A bit strong, but easy to drink two or three of these without a problem.  This is probably my favorite go to IPA up there with Two-Hearted, Finest-Kind, and Hop Devil. There are huge differences, but probably my favorite of the bunch, especially at the price. A wonderful, complex, cost-effective IPA that I assume would be 3-4 dollars more from most breweries, thanks SN!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Lolli1315,4.01,"A- Light orangeish yellow color than can easily be seen through. Nice stream of carbonation occurring helping to make up the half of finger head. Sticky lacing clings to the walls of the glass in an impressive manner. Head of the beer still holding quite well.  S- Strong sense of citric fruits, most notably grape fruit and possibly some lemon as well. Bitter hop oils finish out this beer lingering on the nose for a couple of seconds after the initial smell.  T- Mild notes of citric fruit that is soon eclipsed by a lasting, but not overpowering bitterness. The bitterness fades and blends in with the smooth malt flavor. One of the more balanced I.P.A.s I have had.  M- Moderate amount of carbonation perfect for the beer. Body moves past a light crisp body into a medium bodied mouthfeel, a little heavier than some I.P.A.s  D- Smooth and refreshing. The balance of this beer makes this one go down easy and leaves me wanting another.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Overall it is a really nice IPA from SN. I like it better than the Pale Ale, but not quite as much as some of my other favorite IPAs like Two Hearted.

Took a long time to finally get to a good structured one finger head. Lots of lacing on the sides of the glass and very thick at that. Medium to high carbonation and very good head retention when swirled.  S-- A lot of pine and Carmel in this. Citrus is secondary, grapefruit being the dominant smell. Pine smell is pretty solid though. Makes me think of being in a pine forest back in the USA with that smell.  T-- Big aggressive hops that just grab hold of you and shake you.  M-- High carbonation and a lot of hops, also a good amount of citrus again in the feel. Finishes very dry and leaves a pine menthol feel in my mouth. Flavor lasts and leaves me wanting more. Malt is secondary or maybe even third. Still well balanced. for how hoppy it is.  D-- Well hidden ABV and one or two is quite sufficient and enough. Drink more than that would have to train for that. More due to the hops than the flavor. Very well structured beer and well balanced.

140,30420,sixerofelixir,4.11,"Re-review. Sampled in a tulip glass from a 24 oz bottle. Freshness code on label side.  Highly carbonated. Rather stunning, deep, burnt-orange color. Sticky-looking head, and it goes all over the glass. Smell is peppery, but not the hop-bomb I was expecting. First taste is all hops, more of a broad, basal hops, and not too spiky. Those come into play later. Different than most IPA's I can recall, and really tasty. Sugar sweetness smacks the taste buds. Almost a toasted, bready finish, with a hop finish on the back, all the way through. Very good beer. Drinkability high: I drank a few of these quickly before I met up with the 7.2%!  * The local Giant Eagle is now stocking 24 oz bottles of this for $2.99!

Head stays throughout the whole drink and leaves nice rings of patchy lace all the way down.  S - Very nice hoppy nose on this one gives an idea of things to come. Some spicy hop with a bit of pine on the nose.  T - An IPA that has a ton going on. Very nice hop bittterness that is actually balanced by a nice kick of sweet malt. The hop flavors run the full range with some spice and pine. Citrus hop flavor is present but takes a backseat to other features., fairly surprising because SN has always showcased the Cascade but here it's clear they went with a spicier, earthier feature hop.

140,30420,FeloniousDrunk,4.01,"Poured this from one of Sierra Nevada's delightful little bottles into a pint glass. A 2-finger, taupe-colored head developed after the pour and settled into a nice thin froth the rest of the way down. Minimal lacing and a hazy honey-colored beer was made evident.  The smell was nondescript and minimal. Floral notes and woodiness persist on the nose.  The taste is bright, bitter, and leathery. For the amount of hops, this isn't a particularly floral tasting beer, but it has a nice dry tanin that leaves the mouth with a crisp refreshing feel on the swallow. The mouthfeel is bright, crisp, carbonated and full-bodied. This is a beer you can savor and reach for another right after.  This beer is like a wood shop in your barn on a fresh spring evening.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JerzDevl2000,4.03,"Picked it up because this was available via the single bottle up in Totowa. I've had most of Sierra Nevada's offerings and I was pretty much expecting their trademark taste here with just a bit more kick than the Pale Ale and sure enough, that's what this beer is. It's not a bad beer nor a hop bomb but anyone looking for a surprise needs to move on!  The appearance was the best aspect of this beer - a beautiful deep amber hue bordering on a bright apricot with an abundance of flecks that glistened as I held this up to the light. It almost looked like this beer was a timeless piece of amber as I moved my pint glass around, since the beer just stayed still as a beautiful whole. The head filled up the remainder of my glass but there wasn't much of any lacing to go along with it. Bubbles can be seen like in the trademark Pale Ale, but only when I took my sips. As for the taste, it's got the usual Sierra Nevada hallmarks - pine, resin, citrus, some metallic notes, and a buttery consistency. The piney hops remain in the aftertaste but there's no burning here, just a mellow taste that asks for more beer to quench it.  This beer is deceptively strong, as it feels more like a dry-hopped ale than an IPA. This isn't my favorite beer from these guys but it's very solid and immensely enjoyable because it's so easygoing. Sure, the hops emerge through in the aftertaste, but this isn't too strong or weak in the mouthfeel. This isn't a session beer but it feels like one and there's no doubt I'd have this again. Another great offering from Sierra Nevada!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,silver0rlead,4.03,"Pours an impeccably clear amber color with a frothy beige head that leaves awesome lacing. The aroma starts off with a big citrusy hops character, along with some piney and resinous notes as well, and some caramel, toasted bread, esters, and some alcohol. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with a big hoppy blast upfront (with notes of citrus, pine and resin), along with a malty backbone of caramel and toasted bread, a mineral like note along with some fruity esters, and a nice closing alcohol presence. The mouthfeel is medium and a bit oily, and drinkability is good despite the ABV.

140,30420,Borgs,3.6,"Appearance: Pours a nice head with lacing. Dark golden color.  Smell: Phenomenal hop aroma. The citrus really stands out.  Taste: Has definite a sweetness to it (almost too much), with a hard piney, light hop flavor. I'm not getting much of the citrus from the aroma in the taste.  Mouthfeel: For an extra IPA, I would assume more of a bitterness  Drinkability: I like it, & will drink more in the future",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bound4er,3.22,"A. Two finger, fluffy white head. Amber colored with lots of carbonation bubbles. Laces nicely.  S. Either my sniffer is off or this beer has little aroma. Some faint malt and piney hops if I coax it with swirling.  T. Bready malt that gives way quickly to piney hop bitterness. Kind of a one-trick-pony in my book.  M. Nice mouthfeel with good creaminess - the best attribute of this beer. Well carbonated to boot.  D. Given the bitterness, two of these is enough and it's time to move on. This is a decent IPA but it won't be a staple in my fridge given the plethora of nice IPA's I have access to that offer more complexity and balance.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BuckeyeOne,4.23,"If you've ever had a SNPA, then you could predict what Sierra Nevada would produce in an IPA. I poured this brew into a standard pint glass and it came out dark amber with a thick but bubbly white SN head. Lacing all the way down the glass.  The nose was on the citrusy and herbal side with just the hint of caramel malt. The SN yeast was prevalent.  The flavor was essentially a hopped-up SNPA. This is not drastically bitter nor full of citrus and pine. Those flavors are there but they are not overpowering. Only the hint of biscuity malt.  Medium-bodied and dry on the finish.  During the summer, this is the IPA in my fridge. I've spent many of summer evening sitting on the lawn with a Torpedo (or several). The 7.2% ABV is dangerous, though. There is no alcohol bite in this beer at all. The first time I drank these, I got shit-faced. I now know.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Nerfherderhan,4.35,"A- The Torpedo has a clear amber/orange color with a good amount of carbonation. The head wasn't too much to speak of, but I don't think I've really ever seen much of one on an American IPA before.  S- The smell is a bit citrusy with a hint of a piney scent.  T- The taste is definitely better than some of the other more well known American IPA's out there and I already like those quite a bit. It seems to be a bit heavy handed right at first, but quickly becomes a well balanced taste that doesn't linger too long with any straight up bitterness. Definitely one of the better, easier to find IPA's I've had.  M- Its pretty light in the mouth and doesn't leave too much of a film as many IPA's do seem to do to me. This is also very smooth and probably is just slightly more carbonated than the middle of the pack.  D- I really enjoyed this, and as someone thats pretty hooked on IPA's as of the last year or so, I'll definitely have another. Its easy to keep sipping and just gets more personality as the temperature rises, so this definitely gets some good marks on overall drinkability.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I came across this one and, not being a particularly big fan of Sierra Nevada, I was pleasantly surprised. Toasty golden orange color and hints of citrus and what I think are pine.

Some grapefruit and other hints of tropical fruits. It's mainly about the pine scent here though. Some sweet malts come through.  T: Sharp, bitter pine cones come through here. It's like sucking on a pine needle. A decent malt sweetness attempts to balance out the bitterness. A few tropical fruits come through as noted in the smell.  M: Resinous hops stick to the palette. Moderate carbonation.  D: Very sessionable and drinkable IPA.

140,30420,Soilworker,3.82,"Presentation: Poured from a 12oz twist top bottle into a fluted Ephemere glass.  A: Coppery brown in color with a 2-3 finger light tan head. There is a lot of carbonation in the beer as evident by the amount of bubbles rising quickly through the liquid.  S: A little bit more maltiness than I would have expected but there is a huge amount of citrus, piney and herbal hops...it really is a mix of all three. I like the fact that there is more malt in the nose, it really balances out the hops in a pleasant way.  T: Cookie-like malts provide a backing for a strong amount of hops. The hops themselves are pretty intense and is mainly piney with a light backing of citrus and herbal hops. Nice caramel sweetness plays along with the hops. Ends with a strong bite of bitterness which lingers on the tongue.  M: Nice carbonation and there is a nice zing and zest on the toungue from it and perhaps the hops. Pretty smooth but feels a little heavy in the mouth.  D: ABV is a bit high on this one but you can still get a few down. Only thing really holding you back is the strong bitterness.  I liked the extra malts in this one, I feel it complimented the strong hop character well. This is an extra IPA so the hops are obviously present, a bit much for me but I think appropriate for the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Light carbonation showing through bubbles in the glass.  Herbal aromas with hints of citrus. Sweeter aromas make their way though but are quickly masked by the herbalness of the hops.  Quite a well balanced brew with a moderate malt presence before the hops come through. As the nose suggested, the taste is more piney and herbal than expected. Crystal malt seems to provide all the sweetness needed to balance out the hops.  A well polished mouthfeel helps this one go down well.

Straight up pine, wood and citrus.  Geez. The taste is quite incredible. Seriously refreshing and thoroughly done so. A sort of caramel sweetness hits the palate at first and then comes in a plenitude of the hops and grapefruit. Not as bitter as I thought it was going to be, which is always surprising yet pleasant. This has quickly become one of my favorite IPAs. The mouthfeel is nicely crisp and carbonated - like a seltzer, except tastier. Drinkability is definitely high.

Super-long retention and nice sticky lace.  Nose is citrus, grapefruit, pine needles, salty/herbal hop leaf, faint caramel malt. Very hop forward with a light underlying malt sweetness.  Palette starts off with a malty and light caramel sweetness, then comes through with a big prickly hop combo that is salty/herbal, grapefruit rind, apricot, pine resin, and under-ripe citrus bitter. The long bitter and salty finish lasts a good long while. This has a great demonstration of hop complexity while keeping the initial onset softly sweet to allow the tastebuds a break from pure hop onslaught.  Mouthfeel is slick and medium body with a low carbonation that lends a bit of a heavy quality. Smooth and easy, the mouthfeel stands out for making this beer intensely easy to consume.  A pretty big beer in terms of single IPA, it is actually incredibly easy to consume one, two, or a sixer of this. The 7.2% ABV will likely prevent putting an entire six pack down, but doing three or so works out pretty well without causing any serious issues the next day. Overall it's a very good beer, but something in the mix prevents it from being outstanding. Can't put a finger on it, but it just doesn't super-awesome-wow me.

The taste is fine as well - hoppy and bitter, and I could drink a few if I'm the mood for hops. It's good but it doesn't jump out as unique.  I would say its smell is its weakest part. A little musty, which could be the specific bottle I'm drinking. I got it from a mom&pop liquor store and I don't know how long it sits around.

The little bit of fruit in the smell didn't show itself and it's not exactly the smoothest beer. But, it is quite good.  Mouthfeel: This has a fair, textured body without being thick or anything.

Does not jump out like I would expect. There is a sweet scent of caramel  T- very good. Dry floral, pine, earthy bitterness leads off. There s a brief sweet profile for the brew. As it exits, the bitter hops remain. It's strange because the taste completely surprises based on the initial lack of scents  M- filling and big time carbonated.  D- this is a great beer from sierra.

T - Hops are present upfront with a bittersweetness, which then fades to a malty aftertaste. Some light, fruity complexities balance it out.  M - Mildly thick feel, leaves the mouth feeling a bit sticky. Light carbonation  D - Overall a solid beer, a little too thick and complex to drink repeatedly, plus the alcohol content is a bit much.

140,30420,Briken,3.88,"An ""extra"" IPA? Is that like an IPA and a half? I guess that could account for the unusual clear light amber color. Odd for an IPA. But it has huge head that laces nicely although they are tapioca size bubbles. For a big IPA it also has a fairly tame pine hop aroma with a hint of dirtyness.  Despite these discrepancies, Torpedo is a very robust malty IPA. A strong, although not as strong as I might like, pine hop taste is backed up by a complex sweet malt arrangement. It peaks with an herbal/scotch flavor that gives it an added dimension. It has a smooth finish with a nice lingering palate.  Overall, a good drinking IPA to enjoy from time to time. I can definitely say it's the best IPA1/2 I've had.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Phelps,4.1,"Torpedo sprouts from my perfect pint glass with a puffy khaki head that leaves some gorgeous layered lacing. Bronze in color and perfectly clear. it's a smidge light in spots. Just a tiny bit of bubbles stir to the surface.  Amazing odor. Bright citrus hops, oranges, grapefruits, limes. It's like walking through an orange grove. The bonus is that it's balanced by a caramel sweetness.  Wow. The bitterness comes in waves: first it seems like it'll be amazingly bracing, then it cedes to a malt sweetness, then the bite comes right back at the end. A sweetness is there, but subdued. Very well-balanced.  Silky mouthfeel, with a medium body and high carbonation.  Heard a lot about this one, and it lives up to the hype.

T: A balanced IPA, rather than a hop bomb. Very clean and refreshing, with a pretty bitter and dry finish. Citrus flavors are there, but unfortunately pretty far in the background.  M: Good carbonation level. Finishes dry and bitter.  D: Decent beer. Nice flavor. Good session brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,zoso1967,4.2,"Pours a slightly copper, medium amber with wonderful rocky head that has decent retention and good lacing. Aroma is citrusy but also very tropical with pineapple, mango and some floral spice. Also, has a decent amount of caramel malt sweetness. The flavor consists of what I would call a ""progressive"" hop character that is quite enjoyable. Like the aroma it is quite tropical. Mango, pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit and pine. Well balanced with significant bitterness, but plenty of malt sweetness to match. This IPA reminds me an awful lot of a good double IPA in that it has plenty of sweetness along with the big hop character. Kinda like taking an EQ and pumping the treble and bass. I think this might accentuate the tropical fruit hop aromas. Medium bodied with a slightly sticky mouthfeel that is possibly this beers week point. Still, quite drinkable and not only is this a great IPA, but a budget friendly one at that.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,LittleDon,3.86,"Amber and clear, it pours with a copious dense slightly off-white head and a medium amount of carbonation. There is a very small amount of very fine particulates floating around. Very muted aroma, faint amounts of pine, but not your typical West Coast IPA. Judging by previous reviews, I wonder if there haven't been any changes. Well balanced front end with mild sweetness playing off of the bitterness. Lots of bitterness in the back end.

S: Tons of citrus hops, maybe a little pine at the end.  T: This beer has a great citrus/bitter hop combo. The finish a little more on the bitter side, which is great news. It has the oily feel to it, which in this case I like.  M/D: It has mild carbonation. It's very drinkable, taste like a DIPA to me.

Slick oil coats the tongue with a bitter and coarse finish that lingers. Finishes ultra dry.  M: Oily and slick. Coarse and grainy. Moderately carbonated.

At first the taste is very smooth very buttery malt with a hint of caramel. It is bitter at the end only it seems with a herbal taste the smell greatly contributes to, then with a strong pine taste that stays ob the tongue.  It's carbonated pretty decently which I like and It feels almost oily. When I drink this beer I do not feel as if I am drinking water.

140,30420,teovaldi,4.6,Pours a clear amber with a nice big white head that leaves a lot of lacing.  Lots of piney hops and a hint of malt.  Taste is huge citrusy and piney hops up front and in your face with a slight malt balance that finishes with heavy lingering bitterness.  Full bodied and medium carbonation. The hops totally coat your tongue with this one.  Great brew that will satisfy big hop heads looking for their fix.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Evocatus,3.8,"Pours a orange-amber color with a khaki head about 1.5 cm thick. Head dies to a ring soon enough. Aroma is a mix of floral scents, hops, and some malt. Taste is more of the same only that the hops are stronger as you can taste the bitterness as it goes down. Maybe some citrus hints in there as well. Overall well carbonated and dry. Now this is just my personal bias, but I'm not a huge fan of IPAs, especially really dry ones like this, so I don't find this that drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,deleted_user_357747,3.97,"A- Darker IPA, very orange and amber. Sort of one-off colored, not a pretty or brilliant as I would've liked to see. Some mild haze clouds the visibility. I see some faint visible carbonation but not much at all. Head is somewhat rocky. Very light tan and kind of soapy looking, not a real dense head. Spotty lacing is left coming down, patches more than strands.  S- While certainly showcasing the intense citrus fruits possible in dry-hopping, the nose is not overwhelmingly hop happy. There is a definite malt presence here, a sweetness to the citrus, a certain caramel layered in this. Certainly sweeter and more robust with a woody solidness in it. This is a firm aroma and very enjoyable, although I do fund myself wishing it was slightly stronger.  T- Yikes, these hops are trampling all over my mouth. Rough, sharp, uncouth hops run roughshod over my palette in the initial sips. Strong acidic bitterness seems to give way to mellow caramel and oaky malt. Digging through the flavor reveals sweet grapefruit and some peanut butter. There is a great malt presence in this beer, a mellow sweetness to counteract the aggressive hops profile. Interesting divergence of flavors in the finish.  M- Medium body, rather full feeling beer, this is a mouthful. Not to much carbonation at all, which is good.  D- I was surprised by the rich malty sweetness found in this AIPA. While still strong in flavor and alcohol, a bottle or two of this would make a rewarding afternoon tipple.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JoePat,4.15,The beer pours a dark golden almost amber color with a thick white head that leaves lacing on the glass as it slowly dissipates. The sweet pungent smell of citra hops dominates the nose of this beer with a little of the piny citrus aroma that Sierra Nevada is known for. Again the Citra hops dominate with the resony sweet hop flavor and an exelent amount of bitterness leaving my mouth dry and wanting another drink. The mouth feel as mentioned above is dry and sweet which just compells me to drink more.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Appearance: strong orange-amber, nice head, wispy lacing.  Smell: hops, as per style. Strong pine, citrus, spicy hops. Boozy smelling, almost like gin.  Taste: Strong hops come out with a malty note in the middle.  Mouthfeel: balanced, medium carbonation, hot boozieness, then sweet then dry...very complex. Pleasant for sure.  Drinkability: strange, but it's velvety smooth for an IPA. Could definitely have a few. An interesting brew that doesn't get boring at the end. Gets better as it warms near end of pint.

Smells like a freshly dried hop cone potpourri. Piney, citrusy, grassy- all very fresh and inviting. Tastes even hopopier than it smells, if that's possible. Malt backbone is biscuity and bone-dry. This works quite well with the hops- nice resiny pine and sticky grapefruit, some herbal notes as well. Minimal sweetness ensures things stay puckeringly pleasing. This stuff thrashes the tongue, no doubt. Very bitter, very delicious. Almost a painfully dry and gritty finish.  Overall impression: A badass IPA here, no surprise given the source. Might be 7.2%, but drinks more like 5%.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Brent,4,"An American IPA knocking at the door of becoming a double IPA. All about the hops - no doubt, with a fairly sweet malt body.

Taste is outstanding! A bold citrus and pine hop character hit the tongue right away as my mouth becomes an ocean of flavor. The bitterness gradually mellows out leaving a smooth, biscutiy malt character that balances the flavor nicely. Hops linger around for a while, giving you a little extra jolt in the aftertaste.  Medium-bodied and generous amount of carbonation making the flavors slightly more assertive. Dry finish leaves me craving another sip.  Overall, this is an exception IPA. Tons of flavors which are in perfect harmony. Very refreshing and a feast for hop lovers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,biboergosum,4.12,"12oz bottle, at Beer Bistro in suit-heavy downtown Toronto - funny that they get this here, but we out in Western Canada have yet to see nada from this Cali brewery.  This beer pours a crystal clear, medium copper amber colour, with two fingers of puffy, chunky, and somewhat creamy off-white head, which leaves a pleasant array of cobwebbed lace around the glass as it slowly and evenly recedes.  It smells, quite frankly, of fresh pine needles dipped in caramel pudding, with a touch of generic tropical fruit notes, and perhaps a sense of yeasty alcohol. The taste is more robust citrus (blood orange and white grapefruit), a still heady and bordering on, but not quite dank pine needle and cone astringency, unheralded, but stand-up caramel/toffee malt, mixed exotic fruit notes, and maybe a bit of dulcet warming alcohol.  The carbonation is moderate in its enjoyably supportive and playful frothiness, the body a kind of sticky, yet full medium weight, and generally smooth, maybe a few localized hops tripping things up a bit, but not that sexy airy creaminess, no how! It finishes well off-dry, both the curmudgeon-like caramel malt, and the enjoyably testy leafy, piney, and citrusy hops closing up shop, but not without a rather long lead warning.  Overall, a very tasty bridge between IPA and DIPA, where the hoppiness remains a palate seducing constant, and surely that little bit of extra ABV intends no harm. I know that the 'torpedo' in question here has nothing to do with the military, but damn, Sierra Nevada, you done sunk my battleship!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,cdizinno,3.97,"A: Clear orange/amber with a nice thick off-white head, moderate lacing.  S: Nice floral, citrus and pine hop aromas. Slight sweet scent.  T&M: Very smooth and crisp.

140,30420,jlapennas,3.19,"Aroma: Low/moderate spicy hop aroma with a bit of a fruity note. Almost seems like a european or noble hop. Slight malt sweetness in the background. Some clean alcohol  Appearance: Orange-amber. Fair amount of color here. Great clarity and moderate head.  Flavor: Immediately has that crisp SN character but it's followed by a tone of spicy, juicy, and fruity hop flavors. Hops are more intense here than in aroma. Moderate bitterness, not high like other American IPA's, but it's almost more crisp than it is bitter. Malt sweetness is restrained with caramel notes. Malt sweetness supports the fruity hop flavors well.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with persistent crisp character and moderately high CO2.  Overall: An interesting take on the IPA style. Compared to most American IPAs this brings it pretty weak. It lacks bitterness, hugely lacks resin in the mouthfeel, and is a bit more crisp than typical IPAs. I like the beer and it has good drinkability. Very much a Sierra Nevada beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Good lacing down the side of the glass.  Smell - Earthy smells along with some pine.  Taste - Some sharp hop bitterness that recedes to a dry finish. Not a whole lot of citrusy hops, which surprised me. Alcohol is well masked, but the hop flavor seemed a bit one-sided to me with more emphasis put on bittering than on the hop flavor. Long, dry finish.  Mouthfeel - Good body and excellent texture. Moderate carbonation for the style, but relatively ""chewy"" with a great feel. Easily it's best feature.  Drinkability - Unfortunately, it only gets an average rating from me on this. While the alcohol is masked well, there isn't enough of a positive to make me reach for this over something else.

140,30420,OttoBomb,3.58,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass (February 25, 2010). Serial number on the label says ""935211527"" so it's actually bottled 3:27pm PST, December 18th, 2009 on bottling line #1, (see here: http://www.sierranevada.com/images/BottleCode2009.pdf ).  Eyes: Pours a hazy darkish orange. The head is thick and fluffy. Quite a nice look to this one.  Nose: The typical IPA citrus/pine hop character is there, but it does smell a bit earthy also. Not the typical three Cs of hops in here evidently, as ther is a bit of a more musty hop character. A stiff malt aroma wafts up also.  Tongue: Strong pine hops up front with a strong bitter bite. Earthy, toasty, with some sweet citrus fruit up, then orange peel, pine sap, and a bit more biscuit malt to close it off. The finish is fairly bitter. I like the profile here, but not as much as Sierra Nevada's other quality IPA, Celebration Ale.  Mouth: The sharp, bitter and full mouthfeel is really quite good.  Libation: Another good, clean, a quality offering from Sierra Nevada in the West Coast IPA style. I really can't find a fault with this IPA, it's got good, flavor and it's well balanced, but it just doesn't seem to fully mesh together for me. I like some very bitter IPAs and DIPAs, but in comparison this one delivers a bit too much bitterness for the flavor.

Lots of citrus aroma with some pine in there as well. Malt aroma is also present but subdued compared to the hops. Flavor of sticky pine with less noticeable citrus character. Very herbal and slightly peppery. Definitely on the bitter side, slightly sweet but with a drier finish with planty and herbal notes. Malty throughout, but never overly so.  Medium body with a somewhat sticky mouthfeel, a bit on the creamy side as well though.

T: Bitter tasting at first, then gives way to a nice vanilla-like flavor.  M: A bit bitter at first (see taste), but then a nice creamy mouthfeel. Enjoyable as the hops seem to first hit you, then the even bodied creaminess follows.  D: I'd like to have more than one of these and see if the taste would attract me to regularly drink this beer. A solid effort all around, but right now not one of my favorite IPAs.  I like it, although I'm not sure if it's as great as Sierra's other flagship beers such as their Pale Ale & Celebration Ale.

140,30420,feedmechili,3.82,"Generally, I figure that a Sierra Nevada beer that is new to me won't be nasty. With that in mind, finding nothing new and exciting at City Bev at the end of February, I picked up a 6 of SN Torpedo.  I think it compares well to Hopslam. It pours a dark golden color with a white fluffy head (darker than Hopslam). The head has staying power. The bright, citrus hop aroma emanates from the glass.  It tastes very hoppy with some caramel malt and a dry finish (almost as freshly hoppy as Hopslam, but not as sweet). It is too much for my pilsner-loving friend, who claims Torpedo knocked him on his @$$. I think it is almost as good as Hopslam, but quite a bit cheaper, and more widely available.

Lacing is real messy here with no real pattern but quite a bit of cling.  S: Piney hops and sour orange. Nose here is not robust by any means and it takes a couple of nose dips to really get a feel for the simple aroma present.  T: Opens with a piney hop bite that slowly dissipates, replaced by a orangy sweet sourness with nice full malt overtones. Quite a warming beer here. A brown sugar, rich hoppiness appears again towards the end that slowly fades into an easy finish that creates a lingering citrus bitterness.  M: Light bodied, semi-coarse, with just the right amount of carbonation. Watery in the mouth with a surprisingly sticky finish given the overall feel.  D: A highly drinkable IPA that has good balance. Aroma could use some work but the overall taste and feel is really quite good here. Well worth revisiting and luckily its pretty readily available. Truly one of the benchmark IPAs out there.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TheSevenDuffs,4,"A - Poured a nice Amber colour with a thick, white foamy head.  S - Citrusy hops with some earthiness & pine. Very strong nose.  T - An explosion of citrus. A nice bitter hop profile with a clean grapefruit aftertaste. Remarkably smooth for a DIPA.  M - Medium body with some chewiness. Good amount of carbonation.  D - A nice, smooth DIPA. This will definitely become a regular in my fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,travduke,4.38,"Poured into a Chimay goblet.  Look: Amber body, two inch white foamy head. Incredible lacing. This is how an IPA should look.  Smell: Citrus, floral, lots of pine.  Taste: Nice hop flavor all around. Just like the nose suggests. Mild bitterness. Good malt backbone too. Very well balanced.  Mouth/Drink: Crisp and flavorful.

140,30420,rabsten,4.55,"More awesomeness from Sierra Nevada that's now - finally - available in West Virginia.  Thick fluffy light tan head atop slightly cloudy amber body. Good head retention. Good Lacing. Sweet floral hop aroma promises hops, hops, hops and flavor delivers. Front of palate bitterness with solid malt backing that supports the hops superbly. Crisp start to mouthfeel but moderates out to a smooth watery-ness at the end. And for drinkability, well I can drink it all day long.

Smells bready. Smell of barley. Very faint lemony citrus form the hops.  Taste follows smell. Lots of barley malt, a touch of honey from the malts. Then bitter pine/resin and orange rind and slightly lemony citrus from the hops.  Medium bodied. Well carbonated. Medium dry. Prickly on the tongue. A touch creamy.

Taste, this one probably has some 'new' hops Amarillo/Summit or something. Its real big on bitterness and the hop profile, and a good heavy malt backbone to wit.  Mouthfeel, gets a little heavier and earthy than desired, really the beer's only true letdown. Very drinkable, I can't think of too many big IPA's that are mass produced and this cheap. In terms of bang for your buck, its Torpedo, Pliny or Hop Stoopid.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,waughbrew,3.31,"I am very interested to have this, because the Sierra IPA I had a few years back on draft, which was probably a test batch for this, needed a lot of work.  Pours a very clear golden orange with a sizable foam/cream head that slowly settles into a muted version of the shape of the top of your glass. Laces impressively. Smells of rose petals and freshly mowed grass. Flavor has a lot of hops, but maybe Amarillo or another one of those rough-flavored hops that mix fruit with crushed aspirin. The malt is toasted and caramelly. Feel is thick and velvety smooth. Ends a little thick and sweet, with hop flavor fading out. Finish leaves me wanting more dryness and bitterness to help drinkability.  This has a good dose of flavor hops, albeit a bit rough. Overall, it just hits the middle-of-the-road west coast IPA status.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Pours a crytal clear light brassy orange, with a massive white oamy, fluffy head that slowly shrinks down leaving behind all kinds of webbing lace.  S- Robust Piney grapefruit floral aroma, slight touch of bicuits and metallic alcohol whiff at the end that reminds me of nail polish remover.  T- I was surprised that I get the maltiness of this beer upfront which is solid, but eventually yields to the inevitable floral pine. While the pine is greater than the grapefruit in the bitter dept, neither....or the combination is overwhelming, to me. I don't get much alcohol, until the very end, even then its not much.  M- Medium bodied, I don't get as much oily residue as I had suspected. The carbonation is not a highlight in the swallow, so you can focus on the flavor.  D- Surprise, SN puts out a solid IPA. WHile it is signature SN hop heavy, I think that this is balanced enough to enjoy more than 1 in a sitting.

Pretty well-balanced IPA, with the hops not being overbearing. Hops are up front, slightly sweet citrus in the middle with some bitterness, and a little pineapple on a fairly smooth finish. Crisp, yet fairly smooth (again). Light-to-medium fullness. Easy to drink, good all around beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,kjyost,3.38,"Poured with a nice head leaving good lacing atop an orangey-brown liquid. A nice aroma of bittering hops and bit of malt underneath.  The beer though I found surprisingly to be bitter and piney without a strong malt backbone, nor aromatic hop to help balance it. To me it seems quite unbalanced, almost biting the tongue in the end. I couldn't tell if there were any other flavours in the beer as the bitterness dominated from start to finish. Properly carbonated, and sticks in your mouth. The bitterness makes this a tough beer to drink.  Considering the buzz, incredibly disappointing. I'll go have a Furious now.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Light pine notes an accompanying citrus/grapefruit flavor which eventually subsides to a slightly bitter drying hop flavor and finishes with a nice sweet malt flavor. A well balanced ""extra"" IPA in my opinion.  M. Med carbonation, med body, slightly oily mostly clean finish just a bit dry.  D.

Drinkability-I didn't think it was very easy to drink starting out but three bottles later I was thinking this beer was very easy to drink and the aftertaste is an added benefit.

A little bit of citrus in there also to go with a hint of sweetness from the malt.  T- A nice oily feel of piney hops that is a little bitter starts things off. There is also a little bit of some grass in there that is followed by a little bit of a weak malt presence.  M- Bitterness up front and is pretty dry on the finish. A little oily on the feel. Pretty good carbonation makes this one go down nicely.  D- I would have to say that after a few of these, I would be done. The bitterness from the hops would do my palate in.

The hop nose was not strong, but still quite good with low citrus and some pine. The hop flavor came through as slightly spicy (maybe piney or sprucey, but not not too much). The beer was well balanced, but still hop-forward/hop-finish as a good IPA should be.  This is a great beer. I hope it is in my stores at all times.  No complaints here.

M: Smooth and crisp, with a good chewy feel and a good finish on the back of the palate.  D: Very mellow, like most SN offerings I've had.

Pine, a little bit of orange, some malt, just the right amount of sweetness. A very faint taste of copper (think of like how a penny smells, but not in a bad way)  Full mouthfeel, smooth like cream with a nice prickle of carbonation and acidity. Very drinkable.

A: Clear, pale copper sounds about right. Nice rocky two-finger head that lingers to the bottom of the glass & quickly re-forms with a minimal swirl leaving quite impressive lacing.  S: Fresh, spicy hops. I get some sweetness from the malt, and a hint of alcohol as well.  T: Green, earthy hops are up front and dominate. Bitter. Big grapefruit, other citrus. Getting a really nice herbal element in there too. Clean, refreshing finish. Very tasty.  M: Oily and coating, in a good way.  D: High. ""Hit-on-your-sister-in-law""-sorta high.

T - Awesome grapefruit hop taste up front with a good malty balance. Finishes fairly better. Almost a perfect taste profile for an IPA. Borders on a ""5"" rating for me.  M - Full bodied without being overly heavy on the palate.  D - Well I could drink a six pack of this except the alcohol will probably limit me to about three.

The hops have that really oily, medicinal/astringent characteristic. This isnt very citrusy. From the nose you can tell this is going to be a bitter one.  T- And yes, this is a bitter one. Its not insane though. There is a nice toasty malt base. The hops are like the nose would suggest. Piney, oily, herbal and astringent.  M- How a good IPA should be. Medium carbonation, Medium body, very clean finish that's not too dry.  D- Average drinkability for me. Quite bitter, slightly more alcoholic than a session beer.

Right off the bat I'm impressed with how this beer looks. Smells pretty good too. Solid malty smell, accented by hops. Tastes pretty good at first, smooth and pleasantly bitter. Finishes a bit too bitter for me and after a few sips I don't like it as much. I'm not really sure how to rate the taste as I don't think it's bad nor particularly good, but it's by no means average.

Does this mean that Sierra Nevada grows their own hops?  Poured into a tumbler it produces about an inch of head that leaves solid lacing. The appearance is orange-amber and clear. The aroma is of citrus hops, not quite as strong as I'd like in an IPA, but nice, with some malt. The taste is hop bitter and malty.

Taste: Wow...Definitely hoppy. Hits you strong up front and finishes intensely bitter with a bit of toastiness as well. Slight citrus notes towards the beginning but aren't as pronounced as I would expect.  Mouthfeel: A little on the thin side but with a great carbonation bite.  Drinkability: A great IPA and another winner from Sierra Nevada. I definitely see where the ""Extra"" comes in in ""Extra IPA.""

T: earthy and toasty, with sweet citrus fruit juice up front, then grapefruit, orange peel, pine sap, and more biscuity, grainy malt close it off.  M: creamy medium-full body that quickly becomes tingly and resiny from a balance of carbonation and hoppiness. leaves mouth off dry with a coating of hop resin.

Good head retention and absolutely ridiculous lacing-- really looks like lace plastered inside the glass.  Smell: Grapefruit and pine. Raw citrus hops, not the sweet candied kind. Malt takes a backseat.  Taste: As expected-- bitter citrus hops. Grapefruit pith and some pine. There's a sweet little punch of malt in the middle surrounded on both sides by bitterness. In that way its balanced, but in no other way. Its a great bitter-hoppy IPA, but dont try to sell us on balance. The finish does also have a sweet crackery maltiness.  Mouthfeel: Great.

Mixed in is a chewy feel with more hops and citrus. The finish is slightly bitter.  D: Very good brew. Not to overpowering but still enough to hurt the drinkability slightly. Not sure how ""Extra"" it is, but still a great IPA.  Cheers!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,qdeguchy,4.38,"Poured a 12oz bottle into a standard pint glass  A. Poured a semi-transparent caramel body with a creamy two finger off-white head. There was nice lacing following each drink attributed to the hop resins.  S. The smell was a bit subtle. It was piney, grapefruit and floral in nature with a hint of spiciness. Maybe reminiscent of nutmeg.  T. Taste was hop-forward with a rush of bitterness. This transitioned to a bread sweetness that finished with a tart bitterness that lingered.  M. The mouthfeel was medium leaving a velvet coating of hop resins that blanketed the palate. Carbonation was pleasant leaving a nice crispness upon each drink.  D. A highly drinkable beer for an experienced enthusiast. The alcohol was extremely well hidden. If you are used to yellow fizzy beer than I suggest you adhere to what is comfortable. Real beer was not only created by but intended for real men!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,sudsellier,3.77,"Time to check out a relatively new friend from an old friendship circle: Sierra Nevada's Torpedo Extra IPA.  A: Poured out a nice, wild honey color with a deep, thick topping of rough waters river foam. Head dissapates kinda quickly, but a good, dense lattice remains up top. Should've poured this into my etched Sierra pub glass to watch the pretty swirl of carbonation out of the bottom. Damn you, dirty dishes!  S: Kinda northern woodsey... like walking around in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in late summer... smell the Jack Pines? Nice soft notes of Myer Lemon underneath the pine needles. Barely-perceptible hits of malt sweetness at the end. (1/2in head still there...)  T: Not nearly as big and chewy as I'd expect for a double IPA. Rather restrained in its spice and citrus. Slightly coppery flavor to go with the citrus rind. Very clean finish with just enough pleasant bitterness to keep your noggin from straying to unimportant thoughts like, ""Should I go? I've got to get up early,"" or ""This chick is totally digging my striped shirt... all-right..."" or, even worse ""Maybe I should switch to a Bud Light Lime. The ladies seem to dig the guys that drink those..."" Ugh. Thank someone somewhere that this beer is nicely-balanced. Leave the stupid ideas to the Jagerbomb crowd. (Oh, half-way down the pint glass & the head is still there albeit 1/4 in now...)  M: Only slightly viscous with a very nicely-noticible fizz present. Still hoping for something a bit chewier.  D: And how. The 7.2%abv gives just enough kick that a full sixer should do you dandy without feeling cheated at the end. Just enough balance of flavor and texture makes this one you could take to a party, drink the whole shebang and not worry too much about acting like a drunken dork whilst still knowing you drank a darn good beer and had a good time doing it. I am now drinking this while eating popcorn laced with s&p and yellow curry powder 'cause I'm a doofus like that. Oh, final report: head still 1/4 in and lattice clinging to insides of glass like ancient boulder moss.

140,30420,MrHassellYaHurd,4.3,"Torpedo pours a crystal-clear copper with a quickly-dissipating white head. Lacing lasts and lasts, throughout the entire beer.  Delightfully piney. Mouth-watering thick grapefruit notes.  The balance of piney bitterness to the sweet citrus fruits and thick biscuity maltiness is just amazing. This is a delicious example of an AIPA if I've ever had one. I'm a pretty big fan of their SNPA, but I believe I prefer the more pronounced tastes of the Torpedo.  The Torpedo has a medium to thick mouthfeel. Syrupy, but lightened by the carbonation quite a bit.  A delicious beer whose drinkability is only detracted from by its higher abv.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,chickencoop,4.42,"First off, i'm biased, I love Sierra Nevada and everythibg they do and what they have done, they are consistant and solid. The beer pours a clean deep amber, strong citrusy pine notes. Taste is a very balanced strong hops with a sweet malt finish. This beer is what most IPA's try to be, and Sierra does it everyday, a consistant clean IPA that highlights the hops, but balances out the finish with the malts, making this a very drinkable tasty brew. It seems that everybody out here is doing an IPA, what sets these guys apart is that from bottle 1 to bottle 1000, they taste the same, and all good, not hit or miss like the 22oz. pretty label IPA's that are stuffing the shelves.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Groenebeor,4.5,"L: Caramel amber with a 1 finger white head that faded quickly. Leaves lots of lacing.  S: Smells of cascade hops - very lemony, with pine and cedar notes. Epic!  T: While most IPAs I've had are so strong with regards to IBUs, this beer is the top so far. 78 IBUs. It doesn't taste like it. The malt backbone of caramel and toasted wheat breadis a very beautiful sweetness that combines well with the perfectly balanced hop flavor. Tons of hop flavor - lots of resin, some fruit. This tastes more like a DIPA.  F: Awesome malt backbone, and slightly creamy. This really is a DIPA...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Kitt,3.89,"From bottle, pours a thick three-finger frothy cream-colored head that persists remarkably well. Thick lacing lingers. A deep rich orange-tinged amber color.  Aroma rather unremarkable given the beer's striking appearance -- a musty scent of hay bales with stark hop and piney undertones.  Taste is of a dramatic bitter-rich honey-hop foreground bombardment. Pine and straw background tones. Bitter hop flavor lingers nicely but sits slightly heavy. Carbonation moderate but appropriate for the heavy taste. This is a strong and forward IPA: rich, heavy, lingering.  Mouthfeel rather light -- this in stark contrast to heavy flavor.  Drinkability is good - flows well but the heavy flavor may limit one's desire to indulge in more than a few rounds. I can see this beer as a good appetizer to start out a weekend dinner date. A rather fine and creative IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hopheadjuice,4.1,12 oz. bottle poured into german mug.  Appearance: Nice orange-amber color some visible carbonation and a nice off white head that leaves a nice lace.  Smell: This IPA smells citrusy with a nice malt bisquit like backscent as well pairs nicely.  Taste: Nice and dry hopped leaves that oh so wonderful dry bitter taste that I love with IPAs. also good balance of malt as well hops dont overkill like I thought might happen with this brew.  Mouthfeel: Has a nice little zing to the palate as its going down medium full bodied taste.  Drinkability: Being 7.2 ABV this beer comes behind to kick your ass if you dont realize how much you're drinking. (Happend to me lol.)

140,30420,jmerloni,4.37,"A - a nice lively orange with good white head that has good lacing and moderate retention.  S - The aroma is exceptional...The nose on this beer is something to get excited about. Grassy citrus scent and is piney and very hoppy. Malt is also detectable on the nose, though it does not smell sweet. I want to boil this shit in a pan in my house as an air freshener. Tremendous.  T - Follows the nose and is just excellent. Piney and very hoppy with a nice oakey aftertaste and an anisey aftertaste is detectable on some sips.  M - Very balanced. Full but not too heavy. Medium bodied overall. Carbonated a good deal with a great hop bitterness and bite. A great dry finish.  D - One of the smoothest and most pleasant beers I've come across. The 7.2 ABV is a bit high for it to be sessionable, but I wish it were. Overall, a great beer, and once again, Sierra Nevada passes expectations.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BEERHEAD001,5,"This is an awesome brew. I'm a hop head so I really like the way this beer is set up. I have had probably 2 cases of this...just to make sure on the quality assurance. I have also created a recipe that is fairly close to the original. I do think my recipe could use a bit more hops though. I used about 9 ounces in a 10 gallon batch. I'm not a ""pureist"" to Sierra's recipe, but mine was pretty damn tastey ! Email if you want the recipe.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,watchnerd,3.91,"Poured from bottle into a wine glass.  A = amber color, clear, lots of lace, good head that fades to a thin film that is retained.  S = Pretty similar to Sierra Nevada pale ale, not as citrusy as you'd think. A bit light on the aromas, actually.  T = As expected from this brewer and these hops, citrus, bitterness, and a whiff of hemp like funk.  M = Good mouthfeel, a bit light on the carbonation.  D = Very drinkable for a 'hoppy' ale and doesn't kill your taste buds.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T= overdose of hops bitters, too much; nice malts coming through that didn't seem very evident in the scent but they're overwhelmed by high-IBU hops obesssion. Dry bitterness.  M= too over-the-top axtringent, slight sweetness bitterness.  D= too much bitterness without balance, maybe a few for me at most in a sitting.  Great air-freshener or for someone with a sniffing obsession. Great deodorant or cologne.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,robbyc1,4.33,"Clear hazy yellow/orange with a nice 3 finger head into a Sam Adams glass. Close to optimal for this style.  Fresh earthy hop nose, signs of lemon, lime, subtle piny esthers. Very robust. Earthiness from the oils, kind of like a toss of good earth into the glass.  Taste is round and full of bready malt, with bitterness hitting hard, making for a dry finish. Juicy sweetness offsets the bitter, nice balance. All this lacks versus say Two Hearted is the hop combination I love, very good.  Fizzy and spicy mouthfeel, with good heaviness, bold assertion. Drinks nicely despite the abv about sessioning, really a keeper. Hope to see this around more in the Chicagoland area. Bitterness does not overpower, thus a great balanced IPA, well done.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,WindUpBird,4.42,"Poured from a 12 Oz. bottle into a pint glass. The beer is the color of dark honey and is topped by a stiff off-white head. As the head recedes, the glass is left nicely laced.  The smell is of grapefruit, pine and a kind of toastiness--nice.  As far as taste goes, the hops are right up front - definitely more grapefruit here than anything else, but this is not a one-dimensional beer. The toastiness that I noted in the smell follows right behind the initial hop blast on the palate, accompanied by a light caramel taste. I guess I'd say that the taste is a bit more balanced than the average west coast IPA.  The beer is nicely carbonated.  I'm really liking this beer. I could (and probably will) drink quite a few of these",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,StoneTSR,4.2,"Here in Illinois Sierra Nevada's Torpedo Extra IPA isn't impossible to find, but it certainly isn't on every liquor store shelf or in every bar's beer cooler. So I was happy to find it on a recent trip to my local Whole Foods and after drinking five of the six the night I brought the sixer home I saved one for a good review on another, more sober night.  APPEARANCE: Dark copper color, more opaque than many IPAs, you would probably not be able to find a penny in this thing if you dropped it in. It also provided a nice, foamy, one full finger head, and I have sort of fat fingers. That big head led to some very nice lacing, as most of it clung to the side of the glass, I'd say about 75% coverage halfway into the beer.  SMELL: Sierra claims that this is a complex beer with a ""complex citrus, pine and herbal character"". Upon first smell, they don't seem to be lying about that. Add to the above mix, a nice dose of hoppiness in the nose.  TASTE: This is one of those rare beers that tastes almost exactly like it smells. The flavor in my mouth seems to be a perfect match to the smell in my nose. The hops are strong, but not overpowering (by the way, I don't mind overpowering hops). The finish provides a nice balancing hint of maltyness. As a side note, when I decided to sit down and review this beer I cut up the last little chunk of Maytag Blue Cheese I had in my fridge and it is an absolutely marvelous pairing.  FEEL: The Torpedo Extra IPA seems to have a somewhat unique feel. Bubbly and lively at first, but as it goes down it foams up a little more and begins to feel like a creamy English Ale. A pleasant change of pace in the feel department for an IPA.  OVERALL: I've always been a big fan of the entire Sierra Nevada lineup, but this is one of their best offerings. Now, this particular experience, I admit, may be slightly biased by the Maytag Blue that I'm eating with it, but the Torpedo Extra IPA is truly a fantastic beer, especially for West Coast IPA fans. The only thing that would make it better is a slightly greater hop presence, but that's what I ask for in every beer, so you can take that with a grain of salt. By the way, I picked this beer up at a Whole Foods in Chicago and if you do the same you can also probably find some Maytag Blue Cheese there, at least in the Midwest (Maytag is from Newton, Iowa). I would HIGHLY recommend doing this, as I have mentioned, it's a dynamite combo.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,vkv822,4.18,"12oz. bottle into pint glass.  Pours a nice orangey golden color with a frothy slightly pearl colored head and nice lacing. The smell is hoppy and fruity citrus with a slight touch of spice. It has a bitter-sweet hoppy citrus flavor. It's an odd combination, with the citrus lending a slight hint of sweetness at the beginning which is quickly taken over by hops giving it a very nice bitterness. It works very well and is very drinkable. Will definitely pick up some more of this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,sitarist,4.22,"A- Honey colored, medium head lasts about a minute, lacing is normal.  S- Orange, tangerine, pineapple, pears. Is this fruit salad or a beer.

M- Wet, light to medium body, carbonation is right.  D- I can drink this till I pass out. Very drinkable, everything is in place, nothing overpowering.

140,30420,SayYaToDaUP,2.37,"A - thick bubbly head, deep golden brown color, very slight haze.  S - sour grapefruit aroma with modest herbal tones  T - Immediate sharp citrus flavor, borderlines on a sour taste. Transitions to subtle-rosemary like herbal hints and a light toasty malt flavor on the tail. The hop bitterness is there, but the hop flavors are subdued. Overall the flavors don't mix terribly well together. The citrus/sour taste crowds out the other flavors and doesn't leave much of anything to enjoy for the aftertaste.  F - Solid, average carbonation. Warming sensation from 7.2% ABV is present, but not overwhelming.  D - fairly drinkable for an IPA due to subdued hop flavor and medium carbonation, but not much desire to have more than one  Notes: Price was way below other IPAs, now I understand why. Nothing but love for the Sierra Nevada Brewery for it's legendary and outstanding Pale Ale, but they missed the mark on this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CrazyDavros,3.72,"Pours orange/amber with a small persistent head. Aroma shows lots of juicy and resinous hops, with pineapple, nectarine, pear and pine. Behind this is a fair helping of crystal malt giving nice caramel notes to balance the hops. More fruity and resinous hops are present as flavours, along with a big malty kick of caramel. Quite an aggressive hoppy finish follows through, lasting for quite some time, bringing this back in American IPA territory. Carbonation is too high which, when combined with the strong bitterness, makes quite a harsh finish.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass  A - Pours a nice light amber color with a finger width of pillow-like head. There is nice lacing left on the glass  S - Lots of pine with a hint of citrus (grapefruit) and some bready sweetness. Not the most potent smelling IPA, but you can tell this will be a hop bomb!  T - Lots of wood, and pine, resin, and grapefruit...and just a bit of alcohol. This truly is an extra IPA, as it says on the bottle. There is just a touch of malt for some balance, but the hops are definitely dominating the taste.  M - Light bodied with excellent carbonation. It's just so easy to drink. Oh wait, that's the next one.  D - It's just so easy to drink. I could have a couple of these and sleep well for the night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,danetrain0101,4.1,Nice dark honey color with a medium size head that dissipated slowly.  Smell is very hoppy with a light malt presence. Alcohol can be smelt.  Hoppy but not to hoppy.

140,30420,drtth,4.23,"Poured into a nonic pint glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: The beer pours out a bright clear copper/amber color with a 2"" thick slightly off white head that recedes slowly leaving the glass covered with rings and patches of foam interspersed with areas of leggy lacing. Sipping leave behind scattered lacing. Throughout the beer there is a ring of foam on the glass and a thin layer of form covering the liquid. Even to the end of the beer sipping leaves behind scattered lacing as the sticky foam clings to the sides of the glass.  Smell: The aroma is fresh, clean and has a nice citrus and floral character. There is some sweetness from the malt but overall this show is about the interplay of hop aromas so the malt remains in the background.  Taste: The flavors of the hops are supported by a nice caramel malt backbone but the hops are the stars of the show. The citric flavors are mostly orange zest and tangerine with touches of pine popping up here and there.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium bodied and smooth with ample prickly carbonation that keeps going and going as it scrubs the tongue. The finish is reasonably long and begins in the complex combination of sweet malt combined with the hop mixture. It fades off into semi dry bitterness that keeps going for quite a while.  Drinkability: This is a well-made, reasonably complex beer that is richly flavorful and enjoyable. I'll certainly have another (maybe this evening in fact). And I'll be quite happy to have this one again, and again. Sierra Nevada has another winner here.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

It looks exactly as a good IPA should; nice fluffy white head, nice amber colour, lacing and small head sticks all the way to the last drop. And speaking of last drop, this is one of the most drinkable IPAs i have ever had. At 7.2% I could get in trouble with this one as it is not yet 2:00 p.m. and Im 1/4 done with my sixpack. The taste of this beer was wonderfully full and bitter. The only thing that took it down a notch was after the initial pore, the aroma left. Because smell and taste are so interrelated with no sweet aroma I did not get the sweet after taste that I love.

The beer was very bubbly, looking very carbonated. Impressed with the nice clear color, surprised with the small head, which didn't leave much of a lacing.  Smell - Hops all the way, but nothing extreme or overpowering. I didn't smell much of a presence of a malt backbone.  Taste - Very crisp IPA, just how I like it. Great hop taste, with a nice bite, but not too biter, or overpowering. Another solid Sierra Nevada IPA  Mouthfeel - Good mouthfeel. Dry, but like the rest of this beer, it is nothing extreme, or very overpowering. Very smooth.  Drinkability - Great drinkability. The beer has a nice light body, and very smooth going down.  Very good IPA, but I felt it was lacking some. I didn't check the freshness date, maybe mine was a little dated, but I was surprised by the small thin head.

Lots of bubble floating around in this one and its surprisingly clear. This one also leaves lots of sticky lacing everywhere on the glass.  Smell: A nice presence of hops and not much else in the nose. Not an overpowering aroma of hops, but there is a really nice, sweet smell of floral hops.  Taste: This is a pretty nice IPA. It's not a hopbomb like the label might have you believe, but it is very smooth and does have a nice hoppy character to it.  Mouthfeel: Very nice mouthfeel to this one. It's definitely a lighter-bodied beer with a very high amount of carbonation. Also leaves your palate feeling very dry and refreshed.  Drinkability: Very high in this brew. As the taste is very smooth and not particularly overpowering, its pretty easy to get down. It's also pretty light and highly carbonated. This would make an outstanding session beer.  Overall, this is a pretty good IPA but not up there with some of the big boys, in my opinion. It's a bit subdued, but on the other hand is very drinkable and refreshing.

140,30420,generalnotsew,4.72,A: Classic IPA look. Deep amber the color of a nice bourbon. Huge frothy white cottony head. Lacing not too sticky but abundant.  S: Reminds me of Anniversary AleX5. Strong hop presence in the nose not much malt to speak of. Very earthy and piney with a nice fruity backbone. I would use this as air freshener.  T: Very sharp hop bite right out of the gate. Takes a bit to simmer down but the maltiness is there a good few seconds after taking the first drink. Makes me think of an extra bitter Hop Wallop. This IPA is as close to DIPA without crossing the barrier that you can get. Nice grapefruit come into play too along with oily piney hops.  M: Very rich mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot on. Creamy feel in the mouth.  D: Can be a bit overpowering after awhile and the 7.2% abv will almost assure you won't finish a 6 pack in one setting.  This has been my favorite from Sierra Nevada by far. Seems to be the most popular as well. They go for $10 per six pack here and considering that is only a little over a dollar more than SNPA it is a steal. Why can't everyone price like that? Not to mention you can find it anywhere.

Hints of musky orange and a faint metallic note. Taste is a very bitter bite of piney hops, hints of musky orange peel and a biscuity malt backbone. A slight metlallic taste akin to a copper penny on the tongue. Did i mention its bitter? Medium bodied, oily and big bitter aftertaste that dulls the palate after a few sips.

Very drinkable for a near 8% EIPA, the first tween IPA/DIPA that I know of.  This beer is so drinkable that during a poker session, two of my friends (unintentionally) got blasted.

Smell: The aroma was of the typical citrusy hops that Sierra Nevada is known for but there was a certain piney element to it that I wasn't expecting. Very pleasant.  Taste: Again the hops play a huge role here but there are some really interesting flavors at play as well. I was initially bombarded by a hops explosion on my tongue but as that faded there was a distinct sweetness that was reminiscent of mint and pine. All of this was finished off by the slight bitterness of the hops. The taste was incredibly complex, especially how familiar I was with the standard flavors one finds in Sierra Nevada.  Feel: The high alcohol is masked by the perfect combination and full body of the brew. Again Sierra Nevada really knocked this one out of the park.  Drinkability: I purchased a six pack planning in having one or two but due to the refreshing nature and amazing taste here I finished the whole thing. A very inviting brew that begs you to have another (just watch out for that ABV).  Highly recommended!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bruachan,3.92,"what a fun citrussy brew  nice amber color with a little debris haze. head is minimal  citrus and herbal aromas, with honey sweetness and a touch of toast  delicious, citrus hops with piney bitterness. it's a bitter brew but aspects are well in balance. the malt profile isn't hugely diversified but capable of carrying the load so to speak--allowing the hop harvest to shine. some brightish fruits going here. but mostly hops",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,rwrk42,4.77,"Appearance: Golden color that has a nice lace  Smell: HOPS, HOPS and more Hops. Very nice smell of hops with a slight fruity undertone.  Taste: A great amount of hops at first taste. Pine & citrus with an incredible character of hops but very smooth at the same time. A bit of a bitter finish from all the hops but it is just perfect.  One of the best IPAs you can buy. Highly recommend.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jsdunlop,3.7,"A: Light amber color, fluffy white head that seemed to stick around for a while with decent lacing on the glass. S: citrus up front, some lemons and orange peel notes, hop aroma is very pronounced, characters of fresh cut grass and strong piney notes. T: sweet, solid malt backbone and full of fresh hop flavors. Alcohol is pleasantly masked by the overall balance and abundance of hop characteristics in this one. M: moderate carbonation combined with a slick, slightly oily mouthfeel, nothing really stands out to me here. D: Overall, this is a great balanced IPA that I will purchase again in the future. Even with the 7% abv, it would be easy to drink more than one of these.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Some light floral hops, bit a bread  T- What it lacks in smell it makes up in taste... very nice consistent hop flavor with a bit of citrusy overtones and a crisp finish  M- Very smooth.

Nice hop aroma with pine and citrus notes, creamy head, mouthfeel was just about right with a good bit of carbonation releasing evermore hoppiness! Higher ABV hit me a little unexpectedly, had to stop at two! The only negative is there was a slightly astringent smell when the bottles were first opened that kind of turned me off, but that went away soon after pouring. I would buy again!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Very citrus taste. Extremely hoppy, with a quite bitter aftertaste. Carbonation etc was just perfect. I could drink several of these just for the flavor....; If they weren't so strong. All in all, a nice one to sip and enjoy the flavor.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,animalchin,4.15,"I've been an avid fan of the SN Pale Ale for quite some time now, the Torpedo certainly has a lot to offer as well.  A - Nice amber with almost a cherry fade to complement. Head is retained for a brief amount of time, but is provided with a fine lacing.  S - As with the Pale Ale - a fine balance of citrus and pine needle.  T - Be careful, this will hit you fast. They were certainly generous with the hops, however there is plenty of citrus as well.  M - Carbonation is a little rough on the tongue, but manageable.  D - Due to the higher ABV, this will act up on you fast, though its easy to grab another.  This is the kind of beer that you would provide to appreciative drinkers at a party - it is certainly well-crafted but I wouldn't advise you keep the whole six pack for yourself. Overall, Sierra Nevada is proving themselves worthy to this reviewer one beer at a time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Not overpowering, but just about right for an American IPA.  T: A solid hoppy beer. Not much of a malt balance.  M: Carbonation is dead-on. Great mouthfeel.  D: At 7.2%, you'll start to feel this one after 1.5 bottles or so. Still, it is very drinkable and enjoyable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A: Pours a hazy golden color with a slight orange hue capped with one finger of an off-white white head with decent retention leaving very little lace.  S: Mild aroma of citrus hops and some tropical fruit.  T: Decent taste of citrus and tropical hops with a slight bitterness and a hint of a caramel malt. Not all that much going on here.  M: Medium-bodied with average carbonation and no hint of the 7.2% abv.  D: Fairly drinkable, but with such a vast variety of nice American IPAs out on the market, this one is just average.  Overall this was an average American IPA that I am truly unclear as to why it has achieved such a high rating.

D - on my third, and the 7.2% abv is noticeable after #2. So I will say above average  Overall this is another solid offering from one of my favorite breweries.

140,30420,jhtipton,4.45,"A welcome addition to the Sierra Nevada family. I could almost call it a session beer. Light copper color in my glass, excellent hoppy aroma, just the right bitterness, and a little kick to boot. Definitely give it a few minute out of the icebox to warm up.

140,30420,PeterLemonjello,3.91,"A- What a beautiful looking IPA. Hazy orange color, fluffy head, lacing down the glass, lots of CO2 bubbles rising to the top. Love the fact that a big giant in the Micro world isn't stripping out flavor in favor of a crystal clear beer. Love me some hazy IPAs.  S - Doesn't explode, but nice aroma of citrus (orange), grassy hops with hints of caramel malts.  T - Lots of bitterness giving way to some caramel malts. I wish it tasted more like it smelled...and find the hop flavor falling behind the bitterness and caramel malts.  M - Very nice and sticky. Feels like it looks...not stripped out. High carbonation gives it a nice crispness.  D - Very drinkable and sessionable IPA.  This one is a keeper. I personally think it could have a little bit of the bitterness shifted to flavor additions (it's not too bitter, but it's a tad bitter relative to the hop flavor)...but it's still a very nice beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TheJollyHop,4.15,"From the bottle, pours a deep amber/copper with only the faintest lining of head. From the start everything is where it should be for the style.  Aroma is floral and sweet. Possible tropical fruits in there somewhere but it could be malt sweetness. Either way, the nose is enjoyable, but nothing to get too excited over.  The first sip explodes with a burst of citrus and bitterness and some underlying biscuit and crystal malts; a hint of pine is in the background as well.The bitterness lingers on the palate but is devoid of any harshness, and most importantly the beer isn't too sweet.  Mouthfeel is creamy, and its medium carbonated nature feels very nice and aids immensely to the drinkability of this beer. This is a beer that will keep you sipping well into another bottle.  Overall a solid IPA, not out of this world, but definitely a good representation of the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jbowers56,4.25,"Finger of white head with a rich amber/orange hue.  Good nose - plenty of citrussy hops mix with a hint of other things. Can't put my finger on it. Not huge but very enticing.  Bam. There you go. That's an IPA. Some Cara/crystal malts make themselves known straight off. Followed immediately by the kind of hop profile that makes me wish I lived in the states. Heaps of citrus, a hint of some more sweet fruits (just a hint though) and a very present bitterness to follow it up which clears the crystal malts out of the pallate quite well. Really a very solid IPA - as to be expected from a californian giant such as SN.  Mouthfeel is fairly average for SN. Such a beautifully drinkable beer. Gosh I'm glad this is being exported here - especially so fresh. Less than a month old. Weee!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,dqrull,2.69,"I'll start off by saying that I usually enjoy Sierra Nevada's products. The first time I had a Torpedo I thought it great, the second time (some six months after the first) I really wasn't impressed at all, so I decided to give it a new shot, you never know, could have been a bad batch, right?  Pours a light amber, with a matching light and tight foam that dissipates quickly, leaving alot of lacing on the glass.  This really doesnt smell as good as expected, some stingy citrusy hops, accompanied by a detergent-like smell, from the yeast maybe? slightly reminds me of the weird spice I found in corsendonk christmas ale that I didnt particularily like, other than that there's not much to the nose.  Taste is of the same kind of hoppyness as in the smell, a bit less detergent-like though, but it is all pushed a bit to the side by an astringent bitterness that isn't matched att all by the hop-flavor, the bitterness is reminiscent of green apple-peels. This makes me think this bottle might be too old, but the bottle-dating says it was brewed in the middle of august, shouldn't be all that bad, should it?  Feels alright in the mouth, but the unmotivated bitterness doe sn't really invite to sessioning.  Dissapointed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,sprucetip,3.88,"From notes. Bronze, nearly clear, active, white head with retention and modest lacing.  SMELL I expected more. Fainter than expected. Mild grassy hops, grainy, and mild maltyness. Balanced.  TASTE Citrus and piny hops lead. Solid malty base balances in the background. Balanced through the middle then bitterness increases modestly in the dry finish. Solid, not super complex.  FEEL Some tingly fiz, medium body, bit of warming, dry bitter finish.  OVERALL Another really good, pretty much sessionable, west coast IPA. Not amazing or unforgettable, but solid and plenty drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste must be hoppy. Everything tastes better out of a Duvel tulip...super hoppy and fresh. Citrus and pine are huge here. So crisp and clean, Sierra Nevada killed it again. Flows over the tongue quickly, but leaves a prickly, hoppy alcohol bite. Super drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bristol2120,4.15,"Served from a 12 ounce bottle. Pours a deep copper, with a substantial, craggy foam head, that persists through most of the drink. Great, big, hoppy aroma featuring berry/citrus notes. I also detect a subtle pine presence lurking in the background. Taste dominated by hops, with berry/citrus notes upfront, and burnt caramel/pine notes on the afterstaste. This beer features a very deep and complex flavor profile that you could probably linger over for quite a while. A decent mouthfeel, with a pleasing level of carbonation and smoothness.

Leaves nice ringing lacing on the sides of the glass. Pretty good looking IPA.  S- Hops hops and hops. There is a mix of fruity hops and earthy hops as well. There is a light malty biscut smell I get from this beer as well.  T- Nice big citrus hops in this one along with a bitter undertone the entire drink. The malts play well in the backbone of this and balance everything out quite nice.  M- Medium mouthfeel. The carbonation on this beer goes well with the style. Hops wreck the tongue well after a sip is taken. Hops in the aftertaste remind you why you cracked this beer open in the first place. Crisp and clean flavors.  D- Drinkable? Yes!

Usually I am wary of anything sold in six packs at a grocery store, but I found the courage to snag a six on sale after getting tired of seeing dozens of the ads for this beer in magazines. (For the record, Deschutes is sold in six packs and I love it!)  Poured into pint glass. Lovely head settling to one of the most persistent laces this side of Russian River! The nose is pretty prominent though rather focused on hops and light malts. The flavor is great, a host of dry, fresh, and zippy notes focused on pine, spice, and a hint of citrus and tree fruits. Texture is lovely but a bit abrasive, especially initially. The beer grows on you and you find yourself with an empty glass before you know it.  Basically a stunning little Extra IPA that put a big smile on my face. Bravo Sierra Nevada!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,StJamesGate,4.32,"Pours deep amber with puffy white head that fades fast but rings. Aroma clear from a distance - big pine resin and orange zest nose. Some cake and caramel followed by tongue scouring skunk and sap hops, with a twinkle of orange again at the end. Bitterness come in waves at the finish with a bone dry linger. Chewy, medium, can't find any burn.  This isn't a double? Seems unfair to put this against mere mortal IPAs. Still, as good as any measure for excellence in West Coast IPAs.

Sat like that for about a minute, then faded to a half inch just peeking over the rim. Visible carbonation, good clarity.  Nose is moderate-strength floral hops over light grapefruit. Lurking in the background is some sweet malt. Nose is not at all bitter, which is good.  Strong citrus up front over sweet malts. Creamy texture, light but still feels like a solid APA. The carbonation is perfect. Good mouthfeel. Bittering hops are there throughout, but there's a great deal going on and you get a 'big beer' without it trying to beat the crap out of you while laughing like some pale ales. Good alcohol masking; feels like a 5%. Interesting and light enough to be sessionable.  Superior.

Smell: all hops: some citrusy, some spicy, some earthy. There's a little hint of funk which works, as well. Pretty good.  Taste: big bitter hops at first with more than enough caramely malt to stand up to the hops. Earthy hops work well with the malt but as the flavor fades it changes over to a more spicy, piney hop flavor. Through all this it manages to be pretty smooth and balanced; I quite like it.  Mouthfeel: medium body with a good level of carbonation. It works well.  Drinkability: tasty and complex; it's very imbibable for its relatively high ABV.

Head stays until the end.  Strong hop nose, but with a surprising amount of malt coming through also.  Flash of malt sweetness, then piney and citrus hops take over, fading into a strong residual bitterness that lingers long into the finish. 7.2% ABV is barely perceivable.

140,30420,AndyAvalanche,3.91,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. This is a great looking IPA. Has a bright golden yellow color with only a slight haze to it. When you hold it up to the light it almost has a glowing halo effect. The beer gives a yellow creamy looking crazy big foamy head with huge amounts of lacing. I was a little disappointed with the smell. It wasn't bad, actually still better than the average IPA, but this is a pretty hyped beer and I just expected it to be a little stronger. Hops are the dominant feature in the smell, pine if I'm not mistaken, probably some citrus as well. Taste is a slight step up, same characteristics, but it's stronger. Sweetness in the beginning from the roasted malts, followed by the hops. I find the taste to have more citrus than pine as opposed to the smell, in my opinion anyway. Mouthfeel is very good, medium bodied. Clean, bitter finish, medium bodied, pretty refreshing. Good drinkability to this.

140,30420,Tuckstar,5,"Disclaimer: OK. I drink what I like. I usually choose IPAs. My apologies to Beer Advocate (the greatest website and magazine in the world), but, alas, I'm going to totally manipulate the ratings to reach my own preferred generic, overall rating. Honestly, I don't care about the appearance, smell or mouthfeel. Here's my rating system:  5.0: The BEST 4.0: Hella good 3.0: Decent 2.0: Better than Lone Star 1.0: Worse than Lone Star  (PS. Lone Star gets a bad rep.)  Review: I love IPAs. Period. This is one of the best.  I lived in Portland for several years. Had I never experienced the perfection that is Terminal Gravity IPA, this would be the best beer ever.  I live in Austin. This is the best beer available. Runner up for the best beer ever. Sierra Nevada is kind of a punk. They hook me on Torpedo, pull it off the market, put it back, pull it off, and now its back. This makes me angry/sad.  Torpedo is ridiculously hoppy and not for the faint of heart. But for the IPA lovers, this is the greatest thing to ever grace your grocery store beer aisle. Dogfish Head 90 Minute is a peer, but ultimately falls slightly below when considering the non-Beer Advocate factors such as availability and price (for the working class beer lovers out there). I have nothing but praise for this beer.  In fact ... yesterday, I was at my local Spec's (the greatest liquor store in the world), when a very large, boisterous and apparently drunk, smelly man ran my wife from the beer aisle while I was shopping for an experimental beer (Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout ... awesome!) and my staple IPA. I'll be damned if, after a hell of a lot of weirdness, I didn't pick up a sixer of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which led to the deepest Friday evening disappointment in recent history. Fortunately, the Texas game is today, so, at 10am this morning, I returned a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale for the Torpedo, and I am a happy, happy man. (and Go Longhorns.)  Bottom Line: If you ain't in Portland, Oregon, you won't find a better IPA. Period. Double cheers to Sierra Nevada, bringing good beer to (most of) the world.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A strong piney hop presence dominates the aroma. Right out of the gate a bitter hoppiness is noted in the taste. The pine presence from the aroma definitely carries over to the taste. There a some floral notes as well but the pine hop presence dominates completely. Overall another good offering from Sierra Nevada.

Carbonation is perfect.  Aroma is extremely inviting and complex. Obviously a combination of multiple hops here to get this kind of complexity - citrus, pine, resiny.

T - The hops come right up front, but in a very smooth manner; mellow pine, citrus juices and zest, floral (including notes of rose petals), and a faint herbaceousness. Toasted malts flirt with a slight caramel flavor providing quite a bit of balance.  M - Very much like other Sierra Nevada beers. Medium body and perfect carbonation. Fairly smooth for an IPA.  D - Very, very drinkable... I could have a few. Very round and mellow, missing the sharpness of other IPAs, but it is a pleasing take on the style. Probably a great gateway IPA. Perhaps not my favorite, but I'll gladly drink it anytime.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Zaccone,4.29,"Holy Cascade Hops, Batman. Really good beer. It's as if Sierra Nevada condensed their Pale Ale into this syrupy, piney brew. There's some malt in the background but this one is all about the hops. Strong pine-biterness and grapefruit have me not noticing the 7%. I could drink too many of these at once.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hardy008,3.5,"Hazy orange color with a one finger off white head. Leaves some lacing. The hop aroma is dominant, with citrus and pine needles. Some sweet malt in the background. Same for the flavor. There is a nice balance of hop bitterness and sweet malt, but the malt does take a back seat to the hops. Good carbonation, medium bodied, and the mouth is left feeling dry. This is a nice beer from Sierra Nevada. If I have one criticism, it's that too many of their beers taste the same. They need to find a way to make many of their offerings more unique in my opinion.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,apbarwood,3.98,A warm coppery color with a good amount of head. Dissipates leaving a little bit of lacing around the glass. Smells as expected with a nice blend of citrus and pine needles but could have been a little stronger in my opinion. The flavor is very pleasant with a resinous pine taking the lead and a nice backing of grapefruit hop characteristics and a good malt counter balance. Nice bubbly mouthfeel with a light to medium body. Overall a very drinkable IPA. I've had better and there are many that I would choose over this one but it's balanced exceptionally well and is a great representative of it's style. A good jumping off point for a new IPA drinker.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ruckus232,3.91,12 Ounce brown bottle poured into a pint glass  Appearance: Slightly amber in color with a white/off white sticky head with nice lacing.  Smell: Semi sweet smell with a slight pine scent  Taste: Crazy bitter with the pine taste that hangs around but the bitterness dulls a little. Even though I can't handle the bitterness usually this is pretty good. It actually has that gin taste to it which is a good thing.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,cassanoj,3.47,"Poured into a flute glass. Amber color with a bubbly white head. High carbonation. Leaves some lacing.  Smells like citrusy hops and pine.

Bitter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,maximum12,3.63,"Finally getting around to picking up a single of this. After the initial round sold out so fast, took a while for it to filter back to MN.  Pours a crisp, clean color, on the amber side of a typical IPA. Clear white head is persistent even after a minimalist pour. Smell is sharp hops with a definite mark of grassiness to it. Hmmmm.  Torpedo comes out of the chute more like a hopped-up IPA than an ""extra"" IPA. Perhaps I've been spoiled by my proximity to Furious, & admittedly Cascades aren't my favorite hops, but this one is much more 'balanced' than I like. The hops impart a sharp bitterness & some piney aftertaste, & the malts have been dealt with a purty heavy hand. Some grapefruit comes through, but Cascades often leave me with a soapy-type aftertaste. Although my burps smell fantastic.  If I wanted a solid IPA to drink while doing something else, having a heated conversation, this might be one I'd reach for; but I'd reach for a readily available Furious 99 times out of 100. Good beer nonetheless.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,VTbeerbroad,4.5,"Poured into the ""World's Best Beer Glass."" (Sam had to be the best at something, so I suppose I will give them the glass.) This beer was recommended to me by a co-worker who is also a beer geek. He couldn't believe I hadn't had it, since it had already been in the store for like, twelve hours, and was the awesomest thing that Sierra ever made. So I bought it and clocked out early. And man, was he right.  The head is lacy and promising, like fine lingerie. So far this is a sexy beer.  Smells clean and crisp, with hints of pine. Reminds me of a lumberjack I dated.  As promised, this is a bitter, citrusy, piney blast in the face. Oh, how I love a cascade. Nice, lingering finish that calls to mind an afternoon of post-coital bliss without all the hassle and bitterness of a real relationship. This stallion is definitely going to be in my stable for a long, long time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Appearance: rosy copper with really nice lacing - looks like a winner  Smell: great hoppiness, downplayed alcohol  Taste: really solid fragrant pine mixed with citrus and of course an underlying bitterness that really carries the day  Mouthfeel: first very crisp, then a nice transition to something mellower and creamier than the taste would typically present....then a dry, lingering finish  a really solid, widely available ""big IPA"" that I will return to when more boutique options are not present...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Arnie2709,3.72,"Pours a nice Amber Color with a good strong head. Good lacing Smell is grassy, citrusy and piney. Holy Cascade!

Hits very bright with lots of hops. Finishes fruity, with a pineapple twist. A little bread and toast in there as well.  Feel is spot on for the style. Just the right heft to it.  Suprisingly easy drinker for 7%+. Alcohol slides right by you, with only the slightest of hints.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CharlatanSin,4.32,"Poured from a bottle into an oversized wine glass.  Appearance: Pours a very nice hazy rust color. The head on this beer is unbelievable. Thick and bubbly. It looks like rising bread dough. Naturally, it leaves a thick, persistent lacing.  Smell: Strong grapefruit was the only thing that really hit me. Nothing to write home about on the nose.  Taste: Wow. An outstanding American IPA. The hops kick you in the teeth with grapefruit and a bit of pine, but the finish is extremely smooth and balanced with some bready malt.  Mouthfeel: Very effervescent. Nice and fizzy, which compliments the grapefruit hops nicely.  Drinkability/Overall: One of the better American IPAs I've had recently. At 7.2 ABV, it's not quite an optimal session beer, but I could see myself easily having 3 or 4 in a row. I love the bitterness, but it goes down so smooth. Once again, I've got to hand it to Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,FeDUBBELFIST,3.96,"Bottle to chalice.  A: Far and away the most impressive aspect of this beer. The head was HUGE! (3 fingers), frothy and mountainous. And it lasted forever. I was left with a rocky island of head in the middle of my glass. Super sticky. The lacing was so impressive that I actually felt bad rinsing out the intricate design left behind. It was remarkably consistent. The body was clear and sparkling, half way in between yellow & copper.  S & T: Extra IPA is right. Big (nay harsh) & complex hop aromas for days. Pine, flower & citrus (grapefruit and orange). Somehow the malt pulls through, straws and grains. Very spicey and a little fusel.  M: Full body with lively carbonation. Very prickly. Astringent finish leaves the mouth dry. Your saliva runs and hides in the back of your mouth and gets thick like you just ran a mile in the cold. Extra bitter (why wouldn't it be?) and a little salty.  D: Becomes more drinkable as the temperature rises but definitely not an all day beer. A good night cap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,happy4hoppybeer,4.67,"Popping bottle open, I can smell a very welcoming aroma of citrus pine hops backed by sweet malted barley. Took one sip and can taste the sweet caramel malt then the hops came in and wowed it. Palate/body is medium/maybe a little thin.  Then proceeded to pour into tulip glass. Down the center, without tilting, this way you get maximum head. Nice cloudy dark-orange/light amber copper typical IPA color, topped off with big, creamy head that lasts for a few minutes. Leaves behind good lacing, sticking to the glass.  WOW!! I love. Perfect balance of hops and malt. Another outstanding ale from the great Sierra Nevada. It's a hophead's delight.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,cptierney,4.08,"Poured from a 12oz Sierra Nevada bottle into my oversized Moonlight pint glass.  This beer pours a deep amber with an excellent amount of foam. A mild pour yields about four fingers of fluffy head. The foam slowly receded to a solid centimeter and as I drank it down there was plenty of stick-to-it lacing.  The dry hopping ""torpedo"" does wonders for the nose of this beer. Moderate citrus notes along with a healthy dose of pine tree come to meet my sniffer. There's also some sweet hints that I can't quite make out, maybe some caramel malts or brown sugars.  Solid mouthfeel, there is some carb bite but associated with the medium body of the beer it isn't overwhelming.  This is a hoppy beast. The pine notes are so powerful it feels a bit like there's some sap mixed in the brew. The malt backbone is treacly sweet, which is almost necessary when you consider the pine treeness. One thing that is lacking are the citrus elements of the hoppy flavors. I get a bit of orange, but not that grapefruit that I desire.  Overall drinkability is high. Maybe the sweetness would provide a barrier for some but I feel that the middle ground body on this beer makes for an easily quaffable brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bark,4.45,"The colour is gold-amber, the liquid clear. The two finger head sinks very slowly down to a thick uneven lid leaving lots of lacing.  The smell is sweet, hoppy and very inviting. Notes of pine wood, ripe grapefruits, honey, pineapples and fresh lemon juice over an elegant bitter background. Lovely.  The taste is as rounded and smooth as the smell, yet there is a lot of bitterness and hoppy flavour: Sweetened grapefruit juice, fresh cut wood, raisins, lemon peels, oat flakes, bitter almonds, coca butter. Medium to full body. Some warming, pleasant alcohol in the aftertaste as well as a mild metallic flavour, an elegant bitterness and a sweet creamy note of rustic bread.  The carbonation is strong, yet the many small bubbles are mild. The liquid is semi-smooth.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,chetripley,4.23,"This one really was what I expect in an American IPA, in regards to the hop strength, yet with a knockout ABV (7.2%) that blasted me across the room. When I woke up it was three days later!  Poured from the bottle into a Guinness tulip. Reddish brown colors with 1 inch head that dissipated quickly leaving no lacing. Served cold.  Smells strong grains and hops. Dominates the aroma.  Taste was hops. Totally. The malt sweetness was completely dominated by the bitterness and strength. This is definitely an ass kicker.  Smooth and drinkable, but definitely only to be repeated at a much slower pace. I can drink a few SNPAs at a time but not this one. Only a sipper for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smells of Hops, cirtus and perhaps a faint hint of malt. The hops dominate!  It tastes of the earthy hops with some peppery spice and citrus. Finishes just as bold with some bread and caramel. As it warmed I noticed a bit of alcoholic burn as well  The body is decently carbonated and thicker in body. Almost oily  Awesome...when SN debuted this one last year I got it right away.

140,30420,HURTemHIZZY,4.31,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a clear, deep copper color with a nice big fluffy white head that dissipates into a thin ring within a couple minutes. Leaves great lacing down the glass.  Smells hoppy, with some grapefruit, citrus, and heavy earthy notes.  Taste follows suit, but with a bit more. Pine, citrus, and grapefruit pop out immediately. Lost of floral, earthy flavors coming from this one. Great session brew for me personally; ipa's and dipa's are my favorite style, and this one for me strikes a nice balance between both. It has a bit more substance to it than most ipa's do, but doesn't overwhelm when a few are consumed in succession like many dipas do. Nice carbonation level remains with the beer until it is finished, and the medium body makes it great for a session brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,EgadBananas,4.18,"Pours a translucent copper color with a very full-bodied, foamy white head that goes the distance. Very hoppy in the nose, with a slight spice. Kind of floral, woodsy. Hop bitterness bites you right away. Follows with a slightly mellower earthy taste, with some slight malt sweetness lying in wait. Theres a touch of citrus fruits. Medium body at best, that is pleasant on the palate. Its very nice and smooth as it goes down. The drink is rather high. Its a well rounded IPA that is much better than the average concoction.

140,30420,kzoobrew,3.53,Clear copper colored brew capped by a creamy pearl head. Head sticks around for a while leaving a nice sheet of lacing as it fades.  Sweet citric and almost a skunky pine hop aroma hit the nose first. Light maltiness provides some thought of balance to the smell.  Bitterness bites the tongue at first taste. Not overwhelming but very much up front. Hop flavor is somewhat muddled with no hop characteristic standing out above another. Bitter grapefruit pine and a rather earthy grass flavor have blended together into an almost indistinguishable hop profile. Slightly bready caramel malt provides some underlying sweetness.  Medium bodied beer which drinks rather smooth. Finish is slightly oily.  This one does no do it for me. Aroma is off and the flavor is not at all what I have come to expect from SN.Not a bad showing by any means just not particularly impressive.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Mild lacing  S: Lots of citrus notes and some pine, very good smelling IPA.  T: Piney and grapefruit notes with a sort of malty undertone.  M: A little on the not-so-full-bodied side for my preferences but I would not consider it a ""Premier"" IPA so I don't mind.  D: My first time trying the beer and it's good but its not my favorite. I feel like I'd rather drink their pale ale instead. Either way this is a decent offering and I may imbibe again somewhere down the line.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Arbitrator,3.93,"Chilled bottle into a glass. A single purchased at K&L. I've had this before, most notably on tap, but I've never reviewed it.  A: Pours a clear amber body with moderate carbonation up the glass. The off-white foam cap retains well and practically oozes sticky lace as the beer dwindles in the glass.  S: Some kind of dank herb, pine, citrus, and something... green... that I can't really place. A pretty solid IPA aroma that I enjoy sniffing, even if it's not anything super-special.  T: A lot of pine, some citrus and again that herbal / green combination I can't quite place. It's very interesting. Not something that I think most people would go ga-ga over, but it's not the typical West Coast IPA flavor, and that alone makes it pretty interesting to me. Mild astringency in the finish. Some caramel malt underneath it all.  M: Medium-bodied and very smooth. Properly carbonated.  D: Not *quite* what I look for in an IPA, but I tend to respect Sierra Nevada's beers even if I don't always love them. I would pick this up again. Maybe not often, but definitely again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,techfed87,4.4,"Bought a six-pack of this from a local party store. The first store I went to was sold out of it, so it would seem to be fairly popular.  Poured a very nice, solid head to it. Gives off a pronounced floral scent. Head has collapsed down to about half of its original height.  First sip - very nice. Some Double IPA's have a tendency to bite your head off with their sheer hoppiness, however this delivers a distinct flavor, with a lasting aftertaste that is very satisfying.  As I continue, I'm beginning to pick up some distinct flavors. There is a bit of a woody, fiber-ish flavor that comes at you initially as it hits your pallet, however the majority of what you're going to taste is going to come from after you've swallowed. Not to say that the beer doesn't have a body to it. It just has a different way of presenting that flavor than, say a coffee stout would. It's subtle and vivid, all at the same time.  That aside, I would have appreciated a bit more body with it. What it does, it does wonderfully; however, there are times when the verb ""watery"" comes to mind. And for a strong, pronounced beer like this, that is a confusing sensation.  All in all, a very satisfying beer. It may not have the brute force of a Huma Lupa Licious, but it definitely stands on its own two feet. A beer to drink proudly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,djeffbee,3.9,"Appearance: Orange yellow color, medium head some lacing.  Smell: Cirtusy, hoppy, some with some malt sweetness.  Taste: Very DIPA like. A bit more bite than I was expecting, but good. It doesnt have the malty background as the aroma brings forth. Very good, sharp and hoppy.  Mouthfeel: A bit high on the carbonation side, dry and medium body.  Drinkability: Something I'd like to have one or two of before it got to be too dry. Nice beer, would order out, but a sixer may last me a few weeks.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,trbergman,3.38,"12oz bottle poured into a shaker pint.  A - Bright yellow-orange with ample carbonation and two fingers of rocky, taupe head that leaves plenty of lace.  S - Some fruity maltiness far in the background, but this one is all about the hops. The hop aroma is very grassy and herbal, with some citrus zest - maybe lemon and grapefruit - pine, and even a hint of fennel.  T - Like the nose, there's some nice caramel malt lurking. Otherwise, this beer assaults the palate with hops. There are some good flavors of pine and grass, and I can see why others may really enjoy this beer, but I'm not sure I enjoy its hop profile. For me, it's a complete overload of herbaceous, leafy flavors, with the aforementioned fennel being all but a deal-breaker. It also has a strange minty quality. On the other hand, bitterness is spot on - bracing, without being overdone. The finish is dry, and yet well-balanced. As the beer warms, I find myself starting to revise my opinion - the flavors begin to better mesh and some of the unpleasant leafiness fades, with malt coming forward a bit.  M - Body is on the lighter side of medium, with a very spritzy, peppery carbonation.  D - I'm still not entirely sure how I feel about this beer. This bottle was my third of the six pack - having tried the first two bottles earlier in the week - and it's the first one I was able to enjoy at all. While I'm not a huge fan of cask beers, I'd be interested to try this one on cask, suspecting that that may improve some of the qualities I found lacking here.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,SkunkWorks,3.32,"Pours a deep amber with a good amount of carbonation. A medium, white head forms but dissipates into a thin layer quickly leaving behind a good amount of lacing.  The aroma is incredibly light. I get a little hoppiness but nothing else. After it has warmed up to room temperature, I get some grassiness and more citrus.  The taste is very bitter and seems to be more bitter than most American IPA's I've had and I'd say its more bitter than some double IPA's I've had. The citrus flavors are a bit subdued and I'm not getting a whole lot of complexity beyond a hint of pine at the finish. As it warms up to room temperature, I'm getting more of the citrus and some grassiness and to a much lesser degree, a hint of alcohol. For an IPA, it feels a bit thick in my mouth similar in thickness to a porter.  Truthfully, there are better IPA's out there and I don't quite see why this one is so famous. I will definitely not have again. Sierra Nevada has much better beers than this and there are much better IPA's out there than this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Holy head batman, the head forms a thick layer of yellowish tiny bubbles three or four fingers thick on the top of the beer. Head falls away slowly leaving a ton of lacing on the glass. carbonation is medium and the beer is slightly hazy.  Aroma is less than I expected, kind of a muted soapy pine hop smell. Not much else there. I was expecting the smell to burn out my nose for the night with hop aroma, just not there. It definitely smells like hops, just not as strong as I expected.  Pretty sweet for an IPA. Its interesting, almost too sweet. The hops are pushed so far back in the flavor and palate they show up as an aftertaste. The aftertaste of hops fades quickly but not what I was expecting at all. AT ALL! Second taste: hops were a lot more obvious in the second sip, the head has fallen to barely cover the top of the beer. Tastes great. Lots of pine in the back. Clean finishing.  Mouthfeel is great. There is a lot of midpalate connectivity, lots of good medium to full body, finishes cleanly. Drinkability high. I love IPAs and this is a great example.

All in all a very good, but not quite extraordinary, double IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,lester619,4.35,"Poured a very nice dark copper amber, about what you would expect a good IPA to look like. Thick sticky head with perfect lacing. Smell is very fragrant floral citrus hops with a little sweet molasses showing up. This is one great tasting beer. Hop bitterness is the overwhelming characteristic of course, but this was a lot more balanced than I expected. There is plenty of sweet toasty malt backbone to start. The spicy grapefruit citrus takes over quickly folowed by a perfectly brutal bitter hop kick. There is a nice little burning hop presance on the back of my throat that I really enjoyed. I thought that this was going to be one of those IPA's that went overboard beyond the point of being enjoyable. Just the opposite. This is close to a perfect tasting beer. It's not a beer that you can drink alot of at one sitting. That's really not a bad thing I guess. From what I can tell it is imposible for Sierra Nevada to do anything wrong. Fantastic beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,AgentZero,2.5,"A - Orangish color in the pint glass with a huge head that overflowed onto the table. Just a bad pour. Bubbles on the head were too big.  S - Get the hops, but get way too much pine resin in this. Kind of unpleasant, is this a new car smell or something?  T - Not good. Tastes like I'm kissing a pine tree, all I get are pine notes and pine with a hoppy bite at the end. Feel like I got lost in a forest in Michigan somewhere and slept in a bunch of pine needles.

Torpedo begins with a heavy dollop of foam then slooowwly settles to rest atop a semi-translucent sea of amber. The continual lathery lacing dominates the glass throughout the quaff. Nary a carbonation bubble to be seen.  The nose detects (initially) a complex and vast myriad of ester, some of which seems to combines pineapple, almond and spice with pine needles thrown in for that extra kick. There is a heavy mouthfeel of malt that supplements some sweet hoppiness. [This was not the hop bomb I originally anticipated.]  This was a surprisingly light bodied IPA, and yet comes across as a sipping beer as well. Sierra Nevada has never disappointed me; and dependent on the availability, I shall certainly keep this one stocked throughout the year.

140,30420,BrewitYerself,4.12,"12 oz bottle poured into pint glass, 40 deg. F.  Dark, coppery gold, slightly hazy. Thin white head, disippates quickly. Hardly any lacing.  Aroma is of fruit and pine, very slight esters. There is a faint whiff of sweet/bready malts, which becomes more pronounced as the beer warms and my senses become desensitized to the hops.  Taste is of sweet malts upfront, followed immediately by an estery/hoppy fruitiness; then, the hops develop into a pithy/herbal/piney punch, as the malt simultaneously spreads a sweet breadiness across the palate. The malt and hops are in good balance - bitterness is not excessive, though hop flavor is high. Finish is clean and balanced, not overly astringent.  Overall a very drinkable beer. Plenty of malt flavor; plenty of hop flavor; near perfect balance. This is a great IPA...

S: Hoppy and sweet, with piney hops and caramel malts being the predominant players. Some floral hops and just a bit of alcoholic fruitiness as well. Very balanced and appealing package.  T: All the same components as the aroma, but with a surprising amount of dominance from the malts up front, followed by some tasty hoppiness and then rather bland bitter finish. Disappointing considering the look and smell, but still a thoroughly solid IPA.  M: Rich medium body with nice soft carbonation.  D: A little excessive with the astringent finish and more apparent alcohol than I expect in an IPA of this ABV; not the most drinkable offering from SN.  Notes: Not a bad beer by any means (certainly not for the price), but there are just so many IPAs I'd rather have that I don't really see myself buying this one again any time soon.  Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,unionturf,4.42,Poured into DFH glass and smell is a strong grapefruit on the the nose and the taste matches. I really think this is one of the best mass produced beers made (along with Two Hearted) for hop lovers period. Seeing I paid $7.99 for a sixer of a great 7.+% I see this as a great deal. I could drink this all day and love it.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mooseisloose,4.42,"Smells hoppy like grapefruit and delicious Cascades. Pours to a golden color with a light brown hue. Head is massive with huge bubbles, creamy on top and laces as it recedes. Wow, taste is hoppy as expected, great malt backbone though. I expected a huge hop bomb but the malt holds its own. Starts with a fruity hoppiness off the bat, going into some sweeter malts then finishes with a more bitter, not sharp or dull, but steady and grapefruit-like. I must say this is a sessioner because I have already sessioned it on a previous day. The AC is surprising at 7.2 which is not at all detectable. This is an incredible selection by SNBC. Sorry SNBC Pale Ale, looks like your big brother beat you up!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,fakedelight,4.12,"Poured a copper color with a nice foamy white head that lasted almost the entire way.  Smell is very piney hops.  Taste is actually very balanced. A strong hop flavor and bitterness is definitely there, but it's not over-bearing.  Not as intense as some IPA's, but very enjoyable. If you wanted to session an IPA, this would be a good one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Dark, golden brown with a nice, thick head that leaves significant lacing. A good looking bier. S: all I get is hops, nothing else. Of course it is a double IPA... T: I've never understood the allure of double IPAs, but do respect them. Too hoppy and nothing else there to get one interested. Is the point to get as dry as possible? Well, they are almost there. M: very dry D: one, maybe two, at the most.  Overall, I respect the bier and do not enjoy the bier. Please understand that I still do not understand the love for double IPAs, but I guess one would ask me why I love weizens so much. Fair. I recommend this bier to all my hop-loving friends.

140,30420,MrDanno96,3.56,"Re-reviewing since my original review was lost during the server crash. I took some notes, so this should still be fairly accurate.  A: Pours a nice amber color and started with about 2 fingers of head. Lots of foamy, sticky lacing.  S: Sharp hops smell dominates, maybe a hint of pear. There's also a chemical pine scent that is a little off putting.  T: Strong hops taste as it to be expected along with some subtle sweet fruit.  M: Pretty light body and mild carbonation. Appropriate for the style.  D: A smooth, decently tasty, and widely available IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,pibbxtrasucks,4.2,"With the almost endless barrage of IPAs and the endless quest for the next hop monster it is easy for one to lose sight of what exactly one is reviewing.  When compared to an in your face crazy hopped IPA it doesn't exactly stand out. but when you step back and compare it to the BJCP expectations of an American IPA and look at it for what it is trying to be it is quite good.  it is beautifully clear with an incredibly white head that does not go away. I'm done with the beer and the head is still there.  it smells hoppy. earthy and crisp. and where it differs from other beers I suppose is the predominance of the resin.  The taste is similar to the smell, more resiny than citrus. a slightly different hop flavor. pretty well balanced, you get the puckering effect you expect from an IPA but it is balanced by noticeable malty sweetness. still finishes dry and asks you to have another sip. And this beer really blew me away when I read it was 7.2% because it is incredibly drinkable for a beer with such a high percentage.  To sum it up, this beer might not stand out to an avid hop head, but when judged on its on merits it is a good example of the style and is crisp enough to have one and want another.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Big pine hop flavor, solid sweetness peeking through, with some toasted malt and some lingering bitterness on the palate in the finish.  Lighter bodied than expected, but not a bad thing. Really makes this one drinkable. Don't worry, there's plenty to swish around. Nary a bubble in this glass. Overall, a good solid IPA. Not my favorite, but nothing to turn my nose up at.

Aroma -- bright hop aromas. I get plenty of pine and citrus aroma from this. Slight malt aroma, but subdued compared to the bright dominant hops.  Taste --Great flavor full of lots of IPA goodness. Not quite as complex as the aroma, but very nice.  Mouthfeel and drinkability -- Nice carbonation and body -- appropriately moderately full mouthfeel -- rich but not thick. Very easy to drink for a 7.2% abv beer. Nice beer that would be ridiculously easy to drink pint after pint.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Augustiner719,3.99,Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Dark orangish yellow color with medium head and weak lacing.  Smell: Smells great. Cirtusy hops with some nice malty sweetness came though. Smelled a little off balance with the hops way more prominent.  Taste: Solid brew. Inbetween an IPA and DIPA i guess. It doesnt have the malty background to balance this beer as well as dipa's but its not a bitter as the regualr pale ale.  Mouthfeel: I thought it was too carbonated but not awful. Medium bodied.  Drinkability: Not something i would drink the whole 6 pack of but a nice beer to throw in a mix of beers when drinking. Its pretty strong but managable.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The ale is a beautiful, hazy copper color. The aroma is certainly hoppy, but it has a surprising presence of toasted malt.  I taste strong citrus hops on the front with a formidable toasted malt base, and closes out with floral hops on the back. Nicely balanced. It has a medium to medium-full body, excellent carbonation, and is just a little bit chewy.  This beer as got some bite to it and is a bit on the heavier side for an IPA. The hops are very much present, but the malt is not simply a supporting role here. That said, it is well balanced, and makes an excellent session beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Thur123,3.99,"SN Torpedo Extra IPA, with 7.2% booze, this is a deal. This, with a heavy pours yields but a fingers worth of head that fades quickly with a thin retained layer. The carbonation is slower and moderate and the color is that IPA orange, slightly less hazy than some. The smell is musky and dank hop aroma with a light sweet edge. The malt character seems balanced and sweet as well, giving this brew a medium and solid aroma.  Glug glug glug  First is the basement like dankness with the bitter hops rushing in after. The malt really balances this whole brew out because the after taste is light and sweet, with only a hint of hops. A real citrusy beer this is, which I'm a big fan of, at least compared to the grassy more bitter IPAs. The mouth feel is beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Telix,3.64,"Poured from the bottle into a Sam Adams sensory glass.  A: A nice orange honey color, fairly clear. A nice dense head is formed and the carbonation levels are high enough to keep it up there for some time.  S: Surprisingly mild. Piney, bit of citrus zest, some mild florals, a bit of crappy industrial brew undertone somehow... I'm really trying to get something great out of this but it just isn't happening. Either my bottle is a bit stale or I've been smelling too many good IPAs lately.  T: Effervescent while remaining smooth - some candy syrup, citrus, some piney bitterness. Finishes leaving the tongue a little filmy and a bit alkaline. It's good, but not exceptional.  M: Creamy, satisfying. I could go for a bit more thickness/syrupyness but that's my personal taste.  D: It's a fine beer, it's tasty and not overpowering, and doesn't leave your tongue too fatigued with bitterness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: citrusy hop heaven on the nose, notes of grapefruit. I detect a fair amount of grain character on the tail end of the aroma. very nice  T: A nice bombardment of citrusy hops that are big, but not overly bitter. This is the type of hop character I look for in an IPA. This beer has never let me down... always seems to taste fresh. Perhaps this is due to a high turnover of the beer, but regardless, I enjoy it. The malt character also seems to balance the hops nicely.  M: a bit sticky with a medium body, slightly lower carbonation than other IPAs  D: This is where this beer excels, it is perfect for all occasions and always satisfies my desire for something hoppy.

Aroma is straight up hop deliciousness - it almost smacks you in the face when you pop the cap! This is one of those beers I can sit around and just smell for a while - nice citrusy / grapefruit peel / pine - classic American IPA aroma. The taste follows up the aroma and is pretty satisfying: heavy on the grapefruit peel with some bold pine resin touches towards the finish; yet there is a nice, low-key malt balance - its there, yet not too heavy, letting the hops shine.

Pretty good.  Mouthfeel - Very smooth - about medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. Feels good when drinking it.  Drinkability - Very much so. At such a high abv I cannot taste the alcohol at all and it would be bad news if I sat down on a Saturday or Sunday and had a six pack.

(S)- Very woody aroma of wet pine and lemon with a rather grassy funkiness that is interesting. Its like smelling a prairie after a rainstorm plus pine needles with lemon squeezed over them.  (T)- Very very dry pine and lemon with biscuits. Very piney actually. So much so that it becomes almost oaky. Has a light honeyed maltiness, but only very faint.  (M)- Very dry mouthfeel with a bit of bitterness. Great carbonation level with an overall great balance.  (D)- A solid to great beer that is very potent in the hops category.

Taste: The bitterness hits you right away, with strong citrusy flavors accompanying it; reminds me of a mellowed down Stone Ruination. In addition to the lemon I'm getting a strong grapefruit flavor as well. The malt is pretty well hidden, shows up just a little bit at the end.

If I had my eyes closed, I probably could've told you that this was a Sierra offering, as generous amounts of Cascade-inspired pine and citrus filled my nostrils, with bitter/floral character as well. The flavor hits you with grapefruit and pine, then dissolves mid-palate to bitterness mixed with biscuit and maltiness, and then finishes mildly dry and bitter. Very nicely balanced.

A tap spicy with floral, herbal and somewhat sweet. Just a start of the heavier oily or resin aroma. Mild malt backing to help round it off. Full rich head. Poured into SN glass with nucleation on the bottom helping the visual presentation. Kinda' dark for style, but seems within parameter of darker amber with reds stronger than golds. The flavor is where this falls somewhat flat for me. It's not as bright and showy as the aroma. Every bottle I've had plays out a little differently. This current one lays out the bitterness strongly, something not evidence previously that i liked. Balance is pretty good in that malt presence is noted, however, not necessarily that flavorful and not showing any particular flavors that I'm finding appealing. Full hop qualities throughout the taste. Body is nicely done. Medium feel with carbonation done as it should be. I find I'm not as excited by this beer as I thought and hoped for, and it's the flavor that lets me down.

Taste definitely showcases the hop presence upfront, citrus and pine notes dominate here. A mild biscuit malt is apparent on the finish. Very nice balance on this one.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with ample carbonation that doesn't overpower the flavors of the beer.  Drinkability is great on this one, given the higher ABV and bold flavors.

From here, the review may be a bit of an amalgamation because the last sixer I drank seemed to lack the hops punch of the previous few. Really piney hops scent with some citrus and maltiness in the background. Has the pine taste/feel, but not terribly sticky. This may be to rope in a crowd more diverse than a bunch of hopheads.

140,30420,soupyman10,4.2,"Grabbed one of these at a friend's house. Really a nice, solid American IPA like SN is known to do. Lots of fruitiness, well balanced with a caramel malt that makes this one really drinkable. However, it's balanced nicely with a hop bite that makes you know it's not pansy Pale Ale. While it doesn't quite bowl me over like the Celebration does each and every year, it's still very nice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,akorsak,4,"A 12 oz bottle purchased at Al's of Hampden, the best pizza joint/beer bar in Enola, PA.  A: The IPA is a golden copper color, a nice looker that glows at its base. A finger of white head left prodigious lace as it receded.  S: The IPA has a great aroma, citrusy with a floral sweetness. The nose doesn't knock my socks off but it is pleasant.  T: The IPA has a full citrus bitterness, one that envelops the palate with a mild grassy flavor. Pine and grapefruit become more pronounced as the ale warms, amping up the hop intensity. Caramel malts have a high balancing aspect, a nice foil for the hops. The hops have a peppery finish, a lively end to each sip. A flavor that comes close to peppermint sees the ale out.  M: The IPA is appropriately bitter, a bold ale that doesn't leave the tastebuds wanting. The bold pepper and mint flavors at the end of each sip are a highlight.  D: At nearly 7.5%, I took my time with the bottle. The hop profile is strong but the overall flavor doesn't match some of the harvest and estate ales.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CBlack85,4.3,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass  A-Pours a nice nearly clear amber/copper color with three fingers worth of foamy white head. The head has good staying power with quite a bit of lacing.  S-Piney, hoppy aroma that seems to get richer as the beer gets warmer  T-A nice malty presence that quickly takes a back seat to the hops. The perfect amount of hop flavor, piney at first with a citrus finish on the back of the tongue  M-silky and smooth, with a slightly bitter aftertaste.  D-This is a very easy beer to drink. The perfect example of an American IPA. I will definately keep this on my list.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,GaryF72,4.57,"One of the best beers I've tried in a while. Thoroughly enjoyable in pushing the hop envelope while maintaining an amazing balance and drinkability. This beer simply tastes great without overwhelming the senses or coming across as some clumsy attempt at ""extremeness."" It smells, tastes, and drinks like a great beer should. Can't say enough, really. This is especially true as I bought a sixer at the amazing sale price of $7 at the local Stater Bros. I sound like an advertiser for Sierra Nevada in the review but don't mean to. I'm just happy to have a widely available beer of this caliber.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ffejherb,3.53,"12oz. bottle into DFH Specialty glass on 9/23/09.  A - Poured a hazy orange/copper-tinged body with solid finger's width of sturdy off-white head that settled to a thin, patchy retention and some strands of lace.  S - Hodge podge hop bouquet with hints of citrus, pine and floral notes. Nothing really jumps out at me, however. Malt character is quite grainy with toasted and bready notes. Hint of spices and burnt caramel round out the aroma.  T - Opens with a surge of hop bitterness combining sappy pine and tangy citrus as well as floral and perfumy notes, all of which merge together to create an aggressive bitter sting that puckers the tongue a bit. Traces of alcohol are sprinkled throughout, giving the flavor a bit of boozy warmth. Finishes with an assertive resin-esque hop bite paired with a toasted grainy malt character to balance the bitterness.  M - Medium bodied with a syrupy texture and moderate carbonation, resulting in a slight fizzy sensation on the tongue. Mouthfeel is sticky with some residual hop oil adding a bit of slickness. Finishes with fairly aggressive, lingering hop bitterness and mild astringency on the palate.  D - Not bad overall. The bitterness is there, but the flavor is lacking a bit. This seems to be a trend with Sierra Nevada's hoppy ales, in my opinion. They are generally very good but they never manage hit the ball out of the park.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Flightoficarus,4.05,"Serving type - 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass  Appearance - pours an orange-ish copper with a nice, white foam head, with good retention and lacing.  Smell - Floral character, piney notes, hops  Taste - A good roasted, malty taste at first, but an assertive hop bite makes it's presence known shortly afterward. Very pine-ish flavor from the hops. Overall, hops are dominant, but the malty character balances the beer very well. Citrus notes become more noticeable as the beer warms up a bit.  Mouthfeel - Very nice, medium bodied, and satisfying.  Drinkability - The 7.2% ABV hides itself quite well. Almost sessionable.  Overall: Another very good beer from a very good brewery. This is definitely a great IPA, especially for the price. Definitely recommended!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,felipe2toes,4.1,"Poured into a goblet. Orangey-copper colored with nice one finger white head. Good retention and lacing.  Smelled some citrus, floral, and piney hops. I also detected a bit of grapefruit on the nose as well.  Definitely piney on the palate, great balance--not overly bitter. Some citrus and sweetness on the tongue too.  Mouthfeel was good, with some lingering bitterness--which I liked. Very, very drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,wd40,3.79,"Poured from bottle into Allagash chalice. No freshness date :(  Appearance is exceptional. Mix of gold and amber with bright highlights. Pours a thick foam that looks great and leaves quite a bit of lace behind. The aroma is good. There is a sweetness in the aroma along with a astringency, but also a kind of weird smell in that is subtle but not appealing (like something not quite fresh). Taste is quite astringent. The bitterness lingers a bit longer than I would like. The hop profile is difficult for me to distinguish. There's not a lot of citrus, but there is a lot of bite! I guess it's very herbal to the point of being almost medicinal tasting. The carbonation is great and the beer is very drinkable despite the few idiosyncrasies.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mikel52588,4.13,"Appearance: Pours a golden amber hue with a 2 fingerlength head with high retention and a soft frothy lacing  Smell: it has a full citrusy malt with a strong hop presence  Taste: Pretty freakin hoppy; the hops make an appearance right at the first touch of the tongue; a citrus resides in the middle and the following taste has both hop and malt qualities.  Mouthfeel: Soft and fluffy on your tongue, light carbonation; it stays true to the bitter aftertaste that lingers for a good while.  Drinkability: Its pretty drinkable, it has a strong bitter hop presence and of course that's what you would expect. This beer is definitely worth a try if the highly hoppy beers are your forté. I'd drink it again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,craftaholic,4.3,"Appearance: Poured from a short and stout 12 oz into a sam adams 'perfect pint'. Hue is a crystal clear golden copper and pours a big fat frothy two finger head that leaves behind a nice coating.  Smell: Has a very assertive aroma with nice juicy herbaceous pine cone hops at the forefront to punch your nostrils that mix with a bit of citric grapefruit with a bunch of barley to back it up.  Taste: Has a good deal of complexities going on inside. Its crisp, piney and bitter but nothing over the top to scare the meek away. Has some sweeter malt characteristics especially in the finish that give your palate a break. There are alot of grains in there which is nice and the barley from the nose is surely a steady character in this brew.  Mouthfeel: Is fizzy and medium bodied on the tongue and leaves behind a velvety slickness from the hop oil long after it is past your throat.  Drinkability: Easily could session without a doubt, has a nice crisp quality without being too much like a soda. Leaves you feeling refreshed and quenches that thirst for hops.  Overall: Got as part of a 'mixer sixer' and almost wish I had a full sixer. This is a very well crafted IPA and really gets the job done with a nice balance of all its nuances.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DanielDanza,4.37,"Poured from bottle to a pint glass.  This is quite a beer. Nice amber color with great IPA lacing. The expected pine, citric, and grapefruit aromas dominate. Very assertive.  The flavor is dominated by big citrusy hops up front with some malty sweetness on the back. It has a great juicy character and very little alcohol flavor for a 7.2 beer. Great coating moutfeel which still manages to be refreshing, but strong enough to drink all year round. I can easily drink a couple of these, but might wish to switch to something a bit lighter.  In short, perhaps the definitive west coast IPA, and a great step up for those of us who took a while to warm up to the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jdg204,4.25,"After a lackluster first beer for the night at dinner, the time had come for a trip to Abe's Cold Beer to grab a solid second. The wife came along and we had quite a fun trip and amongst my purchaes I decided to finally try the well regarded Torpedo IPA as my second brew for the night.  A: Fairly translucent, deep copper color with a lovely head that retains well and laces the pint glass.  S: Grapefruit and citrus dominate the aroma with a touch of hoppy spiciness.  T: Grapefruit and citrus show up on the scene and are balanced pretty well by a good malty undertone. Strong hoppy burst really provides a nice finish, a rock solid brew.  M: Medium body but just a touch too light and moderate carbonation.  D: I was pretty excited to finally try SN's new brew and was not disappointed, this is a high quality brew. This would be an excellent intro or everyday IPA, easy drinking and very well rounded. SN has done it again, no surprise there, with another rock solid member of their beer family. Those guys deserve a ton of credit for bringing an everyday IPA to the masses, I always felt this was a whole in the portfolio amongst the widely distributed micro's and this beer definitely fills that hole. You shouldn't have any problems finding this brew, so do yourself a favor and try it, you won't be sorry.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T..WOW, what an incredible IPA. Easily the best IPA I have had to date. This beer has a rich, complex series of flavors I wish I could describe better, needless to say, hops are the main ingredient.  M..Terrific. Medium bodied with no excessive carbonation feel/presence.  D..I could drink these any day of the year. Easy to drink, especially given the 7+% ABV. I was happy to find this beer...and ten times happier to drink it. I cannot wait for another someday.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bunnyhustle,4.51,"Easily one of the better IPA's I've ever had and I didnt expect that. I love SN but didnt expect so much quality in a mass produced beer. Usually drink from a pint glass golden copper in color with 2 finger white, creamy head. Amazing retention and perfect lacing. A great looking beer! Smell was good, mainly the citrusy hops but a slight dry malt smell as well. Taste is great as well. A very citrusy, almost grapefruit taste with some dry malt, then you get a nice bitter hop kick on the back of the tounge. Not too malty, but a good balance though heavier on the hop side as you would expect. A creamy but light mouthfeel, slighly oily feeling leftover on your tounge and a nice bitter aftertaste. Overall an amazingly drinkable beer. I love everything about it and cannot thank SN enough for bringing this beer to us!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ditch,4.36,"I had to try this one. American IPAs are not my thing, but i can appreciate a well made one. And this one is!  Poured a deep golden cider color with a thick off white head. Lacing sticks to the glass for the duration.  The aroma was more of barley than i was expecting from the description. definite citrus and pine in the background.  Tastes of sweet barley then a smack in the face with the pine then citrus bitterness. It'll make you do a double take to try to get that barley back. Then BAM! In your face again!. This is a great IPA. Exactly what it's supposed to be.  Mouthfeel could have been a bit more carbonated. Other than that no complaints. Very drinkable.  Wish I would have got a 6 pack now.

Very pleasant to the eyes.  S - lots of malt with a citrus kick  t - lots of citrus. Not as hoppy as I expected but it does have some nice bitter characteristics to it, which cleans the pallet. I'm finding this one to be very refreshing.  M - Very smooth, easy to go down and have another.  D - I could have a few of these without second though. Very delicious and beer that I'll keep coming back to.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,brewdlyhooked13,3.88,"Appearance - caramelly orange color, a big fluff of sticky foam above that leaves chunks and hunks of lace behind.  Aroma - biscuit malts at the ready, nice citrusy grapefruit zest and pine in tow.  Taste - as in the sniff, the grains make a brief but pleasant statement up front, followed by a nice zing of hops that show mostly bitter pine, a touch medicinal too. Aftertaste goes arid, the finish is the same without a trace of the 7.2 abv.  Mouthfeel - pretty smooth beer with a good dose of crispness.  Drinkability - I've been popping these babies down pretty quickly this summer, despite my usual aversion to the medicinal nature of some highly hopped brews.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hops4me,4.28,"Wonderful beer. Deep gold in the glass with a white fluffy head that leaves a good amount of sticky lace in its place. Nice aroma. Thought it would be a little more but still nice. Pine, grass, hay, and a slight graininess in the aroma. The taste is the big winner. Very nice hop zing right up front that moves to the sides of the mouth with a sappy residue staying. Some malty sweetness is also evident. Some bitter citrus in the aftertaste as well. Nice mouthfeel. Medium bodied that balances the hoppiness. Very nice IPA indeed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,alexhammond,4.76,"Hands down, my favorite west-coast IPA, if you factor in taste, cost, and availability. Pours with a small head, light amber color, but give it a swirl and out comes terrific pine & bitter hop scents. The taste is everything I'm looking for: crisp, biting bitterness, but not overpowering enough to scare me away from drinking a few of these. A sweeter, citrus taste as it goes down helps for a smooth finish. Not many of these ""bigger"" IPAs qualify as refreshing, but I'd say this one makes the cut. Truly a beer worth seeking out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,thesyko56,4.1,A: Very dark yellow amber in color almost orange. Head was thick almost two finger.  S: Very bitter hop smell almost sour.  T:Very bold hop bitterness at first but finish is sweeter.  M: Nearly a full bodied beer. Nice carbonation.  D: Its not a lawn mower that is for sure. But still very enjoyable .,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bilyboy65,3.83,"A: A beautiful light molasses color. Almost no head though and pretty flat looking. Doesn't leave anything behind on the glass with each drink.  S: Very hoppy, very floral. So much so you can almost smell the bitterness in the flavor.  T: Bitter all the way through. Led by a crap load of hops just being thrown at your taste buds.  M: Smooth feel, little oil feeling. Crisp, almost biting at you. Medium bodied beer.  D: Something about the way the beer is put together that just makes this hard to drink. Maybe the fact that it's so bitter without much else in the taste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,superdavex,4.3,"This is really the quintessential IPA. It has all of the qualities you look for in a great one. It has a piney, citrusy smell with a likewise taste and a very good amount of hops with just enough malt to make it a rounded brew. It has a medium mouthfeel which makes the 7+ percentage go down easier. The drinkability takes a hit with the high percentage though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,devilben02,3.95,"Poured from a bottle into a goblet. Had a slightly cloudy copper color with a 1-finger foamy white head. The aroma is primarily a citrusy hop character.

This one is a good representative of the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,N8TheGreat,4.45,"Poured a gorgeous copper that really had depth. Nose was incredible with massive herbal mint and pine notes. Taste was a nice combination of sweeter malts quickly overwhelmed by a rush of hop bitterness and flavor. Grapefruit, pine and earthy herbal flavors prevail and the taste finishes with a distinct spicy hot note. Mouthfeel was a little thin for such satisfying flavors. Despite the 7.2 ABV this beer is as drinkable as they come. An exciting beer and a sign of the times.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ExtraStout,3.83,"The description made me think this was going to resemble a Double IPA, but while this was hoppier than Sierra Nevada's IPA, it was not as big and hoppy as a Double or Imperial IPA.  The appearance was a nice coppery color, very clear with a nice white head. The malt was very pronounced, with the hop bitterness slightly out of balance on the high side (but it is an Extra IPA). This was a bigger, more full bodied beer than the regular IPA.  I do like hop bombs and higher ABV% so I enjoyed this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,farrago,3.97,"Dimpled cream white head of a steady one finger, slowly works down to the surface, nice web of lacing left along the glass sides. Deep bronze hue, as red as it is orange, remains more clear than translucent, credible glow to it. The nose leads with pink grapefruit and pine oil while not overloading on it either, has sufficient malts to smooth things out, cookie dough, peach, apricot, pear fruit, caramel and moist forest floor matter, lingers for some time. Medium-bodied with a sort of soupy carbonation that whips things up more than desired, lifts the flavors up off the palate before they can adequately settle in. The pink grapefruit and tangerine citrus has more bite here than the nose would suggest, brings out more pine and floral shades. Overall, too dry to let the peach, nectarine, pineapple fruit really shine. Granola and unsweetened cereal present. Any maltiness present mostly as fumes, plays on the bitter card without ever risking offense.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DannyS,3.87,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A - A dark, slightly hazy amber with a minimal head that froths down to a foam collar.  S - Piney. Very piney. Also has a lot of floral, grapefruit, citrus, and a faint caramel malt.  T - The first few sips almost left me reeling with its aggressive bitter hop assault. Subsequent gulps allowed my bruised palate to adjust, as the bitterness began to subside, and the malty sweet notes came through.  M - The bitterness lingers forever and then some, but the carbonation is light and the body is full and substantial.  D - The almost unrelenting bitter hops and the slightly elevated ABV remove it from session consideration, unless your tolerance to bitterness and alcohol is high.  Overall - A definite 'one-a-day' brew. It's perfect for when I just want one beer to relax with after a long day's work. Not quite as mind-fogging as a RIS or DIPA, but substantial enough to be beyond the scope of the session beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ipazilla,4.39,"Another great beer from sierra nevada. Finally a year round ipa from sierra, although for my area it's hard to find.

One of my new favorite beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Mistofminn,4.12,"Poured into a pint glass. Golden-amber copper colored with a nice tan one finger head with great retention and displays some nice lacing.  The nose is an expert marriage of citrus and floral hops as well as piney and resiny hops that lean towards the earthy side of things. Excellent grapefruit character in the nose on this one. A substantial caramel malt backbone gives it a nice balance.  There is no doubt this is a west coast IPA. Grapefruit and piney hops dance on the palate, while a light and fleeting caramel malt backbone mellow things out enough to keep the bitterness from completely dominating. Excellent mixture of sweet and bitter.  The mouthfeel is lighter than I expected, but still coats the mouth and leaves a lingering hop bitterness. Drinkability is great as well.  A very strong offering from Sierra Nevada, possibly my favorite of their year round offerings.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Mostly pine flavors along with the hops.  Mouthfeel: Was thinner than I expected. Slippery feeling.  Drinkability: Great drinkability! I expected the beer to be a bit more thick and hoppy, but these go down Very easily compared to a double ipa. Could easily drink a couple of these.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,augustgarage,3.95,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass.  Persimmon and rust colored body with orange peel highlights. A small shock white head dissipates to an unkempt collar with decent lacing and thin legs.  Aroma is very nice, with pine, orange zest, hemp, hibiscus, and so on from the hops and a solid malty back-bone.  Palate entry is prickly and nicely bitter, with lemon and a delicate malty sweetness. Slight grapefruit, menthol, and pine forest tastes as well. A long drying finish commences bringing to mind fresh rain on pavement. Very well balanced, and in no way overwhelming. The alcohol adds some flavor and body.  Good carbonation (though a little more effervescence might heighten the flavors), not-quite-medium-bodied, and smooth.  While I'm not big on Sierra Nevada's releases (something about their signature pale malt maybe?), but this is well done - and very refreshing. Maybe not worthy of cult status, but certainly one of their best releases. A good value as well, so I pick this up when I don't need the complexity or expense of 60 minute IPA, Blind Pig, etc.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Good lacing.  Nose has some bitter sappy pine notes along with a little bit of flora that comes across as pineapple since it mixes with some sweet malts. The taste is balanced well between front and midpalate, high bittering with a sweet caramel malt backbone is the name of the game. The hops bill does not do much to stand out, though, with muted pine and flora. The finish has earth and some solvent flavor. For me this is a fairly average brew with lots of bitter and sweetness, but not a lot of aroma to lift it up to the big leagues. Medium-light body, smooth medium carbonation. Feels lighter than it tastes.  Decent beer, but not something I'm going to become a patron of.

140,30420,ThreeWiseMen,4.28,"I was lucky enough to taste this gem of an IPA on-cask last night... not once, but twice! For those who don't know, every Thursday night at the Sierra Nevada Brewery is cask night. Each week a different beer is put on-cask. The following review is based on notes from last night's tasting.  Served in a 20oz. Sierra Nevada imperial pint glass.  Appearance: Two fingers of eggshell-colored head sit atop a very hazy amber body - very little visibility. The tight, creamy head shows superb retention until swirled - then it disappears almost instantly. Regardless, this beer weaves a thick tapestry of lacing all the way down the walls of the glass.  Smell: Moist pine and gobs of sticky, resinous, floral hops. The typical grapefruit aroma is there, but this nose isn't juicy at all. Instead, it's all rich woody aromas, toasted malt, and hop sap. More complexity and/or strength would be nice, but I don't know if that'd even be attainable on-cask.  Taste: Like sucking on a pine tree after a fresh rain. This one is woody, piney, and sweet yet subtle. The malt profile really comes to life in this cask offering; toasted bread and caramel malt are particularly strong flavors. The finish is oily and bitter. All of the flavors meld together seemlessly. I would give this a 4.5, but I miss the fruity aspects. Also, the bitterness is a bit muted by the cask. Still, this is very good.  Mouthfeel: Maltier and less bitter than the bottle and tap versions. The bitterness is still very much there, however, and produces an even numbing sensation across the palate. The feel is very malty and oily and even a bit ""messy"" (meaning far from clean-finishing). Coats the mouth like paint; flavors hang around for-ev-ver. Daddy likes.  Drinkability: This beer may have just busted my cask IPA bias. Up until this point, I believed that the cask did nothing more than dull IPAs and other hoppy beers, in essence castrating them by taking away that crisp bitterness that makes them unique. And you know what, this Torpedo wasn't as crisp or bitter as it normally is, but it was so much more balanced and flavorful that I really didn't give a damn. This was fucking good! Mmmm Mmmmm!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,noknife83,4.11,"Poured into a mug, about an inch a nice foamy head.I can't really smell that much from this beer, until I drink it, nice and fruity. A very nice taste, starts off subtle, and then when the swallow and aftertaste kicks in more. A lot a orange peel, and a hint of pine resin. All in all a great beer, I recommend this to anyone who already likes Sierra Nevada Pale, because this is just a kicked upped version of that.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mjaskula,4.03,"Served in a pint glass. Pours a clear amber with a thick rocky off-white head with significant lacing.  The aroma is citrus and and pine with a bit of malt in the background. Flavor is full of hop bitterness, grapefruit and pine.  Carbonation is a bit low and the bitterness doesn't linger in your mouth long. An easy drinking IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,oldpinecone,4.1,"Poured into a pint glass.  Pours a darker shade of orangey copper with a 1 and a half finger offwhite head. I knew already I was going to like this.  It smells of light citrus and and a pine forest. Very pleasant.  The taste took me by suprise. Super hoppy as compared to SNPA. It had that infamous piney taste coating the palate. It ruled. It also left a nice after taste lingering on the tounge.  Decent carbonation, not too thing and not too thick. It was just right.  I wouldnt session this beer just because its a little to flavorful for a session. But its definetely a good beer to have with some friends.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,enemyisyou,3.85,"Basically a bigger and somewhat less floral version of regular Sierra. This one packs a bigger punch but is not an imperial in any way. Look for Southern Tier's Unearthly or Dogfishhead's 90 Minute IPA for the real deal. This is enjoyable overall, but I guess I miss the point when compared to the afforementioned Imperials and the original Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,twiggamortis420,3.68,"Pours a mostly clear, light copper color with a stiff, creamy off-white head. Retention is great as is the lacing.  As far as IPAs go, this one smells pretty darn good. Big, citrusy and tropical hop notes with a sweet whiff of caramel and toffee maltiness.  Resinous, bitter floral hop flavor shines bright, as the malt background takes a backseat...a waaaay backseat, limo-esque, to the big hops. Something in there, however, is giving it a ticklingly noticeable sweetness. One of the most lupulin-packed non-double or imperial IPAs I have tasted.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jlindros,3.71,"Poured from bottle to oversized DFH snifter.  A: Amber rusty brown color pretty clear, big thick rich head that takes its time to fade  N: Some piney hops, a strange tangy yeasty nose, some dark crystal malts, touch of citrus, little biscuit,  T: Starts with some dark crystal malts, piney hops, slight tangy yeasty taste, a little soapy, very bitter and spicey high alpha hops (maybe chinook, magnum, nugget, something like that) as well as a slight foral centennial, amarilla, cascade type, some nice malty bread taste adds a good flavor, the hops build as it goes, a slight warming alcohol also builds  M: Pretty frothy and sticky, kinda thick  F: Lots of piney spicey hops, pretty juicy. Finishes pretty dry as well. A slight sawdust also seems to come out at the end. The lingering hop bitterness stays for 30 seconds or so, drinkability isn't the greatest.  Final thoughts: AN interesting beer. At first I thought it may have been old, with the strange tangy yeastiness, but the hops shined right through giving it an interesting quality. Lots of bitter hops, good malt base, strange extras like yeast, saw dust, etc. Its also pretty juicy. It's a slow drinker.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jbone78,4.47,"We just now started getting it in Panama City. So, I will not have to go out of town to buy it.  Poured into an american pint glass. Orange/yellow color with a nice lacing head. If poured into a warm glass can create a frothy head. Smells of sweet, fruity, wonderful hops that carries you into the flavors. When I am brewing with crystal hops, when I open the package and the smell of crystal hops is how Torpedo tastes. The floral citrus hop flavor is blended perfectly with the caramel malts that finishes not all that sticky.  Wonderful beer and we thank the wonderful folks at Sierra Nevada for inventing the Torpedo Hop filtering thing. I like it.  -Bye",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,aquaderek,4.57,"Poured into Michael Jackson Beer Hunter Session glass. The beer looks a little lighter than I would have imagined, the color is a golden orange with a white frothy head. The nose is intially citrus and lemony, followed by a sharp hop spiciness. The taste is think hoppier Redhook, really good. The mouthfeel is on the viscious side. The high alcohol content makes it a rough session beer, but the big dogs should have at it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Psyopticon,4.4,Poured into a Pint Glass.  Appearance - Poured a nice heavy gold. About 1/2 inch head. Lots of lacing. Lots of carbonation.  Smell - Smells very citrusy.  Taste - Has a very nice citrusy flavour.  Mouthfeel - The carbonation is just right!  Drinkability - This things kinda fill me up a little bit more than my normal selections. So I could probably only kick back 1 or 2.  A great beer!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,MattyDonny,4.76,"Wonderful tasting beer. Poured into a 12oz. glass this beer has a nice golden see through body that keeps it's carbonation until the last sip; looks extremely inviting. Good amount of head for an IPA, little more than a fingers width, doesn't get in the way. The best part about the body is the great lacing that it leaves on the glass after every sip  The best part about this beer is the refreshing citrusy, bitter taste. It is quite bitter since it is an Extra IPA, buy Sierra Nevada manages to allow the great citrusy flavor and biscuity finish come through.  The mouthfeel is very light and crisp. Goes down easy.  Highly Recommended if you haven't had it yet.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,after5,4.8,I'm not really an IPA fan and the beer nerd at my store just raved about this beer when it hit my market.  6 six from Cool Spring Wine and Liquor and then I found myself picking up a case on my next visit.  These over hopped beer I thought would mask any real flavor in the beer. I was so wrong and found myself craving that taste time and time again.  It was like the Harvest Wet Hop but on overdrive.  Let's hope this beer sticks around if they can afford to keep making this beer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TheViolator666,4.26,"12 oz. bottle poured into pint glass.  A: Pours a dark shade of gold. See through body with an tremendous white head! Lacing leaves layers after every sip.  S: Smells of piney hops and sweet malt. Definite citrus aroma as well.  T: Tastes very piney! Bitter grapefruit balanced by sweet malts. Orange/lemon zest stand out. One of those IPAs that make your teeth and tongue feel bizarre. Aftertaste has strong malt presence, very bready and toasty as the bitterness of the hops fade.  M/D: Nice full body. The bitterness may be too much for some, but it absolutely refreshes me.  Overall, an exceptional IPA. Highly drinkable and extremely affordable. This makes for a perfect summertime thirst quencher. Also great if you want to get knocked on your ass by a cheap craft beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,drunkboxer1,4.13,"Deep golden pour. Smells and tastes a lot like piney american hops. Thick and malty. Quite bitter but not one dimensional. A good amount of carbonation; stings the tongue a little bit. Had with some tacos. Why do people always want to pair IPAs with spicey food? I don't get it, I'd rather have an easy drinking lager. Worth buying again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,movingtrain,4.08,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a dark copper color with 1/2 finger head. Steady carbonation in the glass.  Smells of grapefruit, caramel malts, pine, sweetgrass. It's a strong aroma coming off of this one...  Tastes like a good Pale Ale...strong, ringing in at 7.2%...but the ABV is masked well behind the other flavors involved. Citrus for sure...pine needles, tart berries, cereal, caramel...pretty hoppy, but not over the top.  This beer is well-balanced, tastes great, and is one that can be enjoyed again and again. I'm quite please with this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,barknee,3.87,"Torpedo is a generously hopped-up IPA with boatloads of sweet & sour citric hop aroma and flavors. Very well carbonated and well endowed with massive bittering, this is a sorta' one brew show; and it's certainly the best way to enjoy and admire this offering. Comparatively heavy in weight for the style, there is much packed into the bottle. Rich malts paired with massive hops makes for a very impressive and respectable brew, though you will probably illuminate the ""stop"" sign after one of these!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CHickman,4.37,"Pours an amber reddish color with a small (1/4 inch) tan head, and smells of hops, pine cones and floral hops, but not the strong hop odor that the Pale Ale or Celebration Ale release. Tastes hoppy and sweet, like caramel and malt mixed with hops that has some pine and citrus notes and give it a slight spice flavor. It is very balanced with medium carbonation which allows the hops and malt to both add flavor and do their jobs well. Has a dry bitter finish that fades with roasted malt and hides the alcohol level well. Nice lacing on the glass.  Overall very tasty with a nice floral malty taste throughout. A very good beer that's halfway between Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and the Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale, which are both outstanding beers. A top tier IPA with nice bitterness and flavor, worthy of being a year round offering by Sierra Nevada and a beer that I highly recommend.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,sevopie,4.02,"Amber in color with a large rocky tan head. Some lacing.  A whole lot of hop juices, mostly citrus with some pine evident as well.  More of a balanced hop flavor comes out in the taste, with a mild smokiness laced in. There's a bit of graininess there, but in the end there's a whole lot of pine and citrus hops, perhaps slightly favoring the piney side in the flavor.  Almost as oily as I'd like it to be, just slightly less. Carbonation is a little light though.  Fairly easy to sip on, this one is definitely good. However, I wouldn't call it great in any single category, which leaves it a few steps behind some other favorites.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,MaxBrews,4.16,"Re-reviewing this after I have some IPA experience under my belt. I didn't feel like I gave this an informed review before.  Appearance: You may want to thank sierra nevada for the huge white head they have bestowed upon us. Color is on the darker side of light amber. Head then dissipates into a rocky, white lacing.  Smell: For an IPA this doesn't have a strong aroma. You'd expect hops to invade your nostrils. The aromas, not weak its moderate but I want it to knock me off my ass. Still you get citrusy and piney hops nothing else, nothing more  Taste: the taste makes up for whatever issues that I had with the aroma. Its a citrusy, herbal and piney delight without being over powering. It finishes with a toasted biscuit taste. Really neither the malt or the hops occupies more flavor characteristics in this beer, they work in harmony even though the obvious taste is hops.  Mouthfeel: Bitterness and dry finish are not that high considering 70 IBUS. Still more than likely too bitter for some. But I'm amazed at the balance of this IPA.  Drinkability: A hoppy, flavorful IPA that won't do your head in with bitterness. I'm not a bitterness pansy myself, but my friends are. A really drinkable, but BIG IPA. High in alcohol but refreshing and very sessionable if you don't mind staggering home. A great IPA",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Jdecarol,4.16,"Dark orange hue with a small half finger head that fades to an ring around the glass. Small amount of lacing left behind here and there.  Smells very sweet, almost not so good sweet with an overabundance of pine sol.  Taste is phenomenal. It has the perfect combination of citrus, pine and sweet malt. This may be my new favorite.  The big hop presence is balanced perfectly with the malt. Could use a little more carbonation.  If it wasn't for the 7.2% alcohol I could pound these back all day.

The taste did not bowl me over either, not a bad thing, as any style of IPA can be overdone. The usual suspects were there, grapefruit, a little malt and a pine needle bitter aftertaste. I liked.

I also detect a hint of pine resin.  Tastes of the hops up front, but is balanced out by a moderate malt sweetness. The hops are mostly citrus and pine flavors with the malt having a toasted, caramel flavor.  The mouthfeel is a perfect medium and has a crisp finish. The carbonation is perfect.

140,30420,sulldaddy,4.15,"Cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a bright clear copper with a fluffy eggshell white head of 3.5 cm foaming up easily and receding slowly. Hop aroma is apparent immediately with pine sap and sticky resin notes mixing with some herbal notes. The head is fading slowly leaving large craters on the surface and sticky lattice on the glass. First sip reveals an average body with gentle rolling carbonation. The beer thins a little on the finish, but also dries my palate immensely. Flavor is caramel for a nanosecond up front then rolls to some sticky resiny hop flavor and finishes grapefruit rind bitter, making me thirsty for another sip. The alcohol is well hidden, and the beer is drinkable, but make no mistake there are hops in that bottle!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Winter,4.6,"Pours amber in color with a creamy off-white rocky head. Thick lacing clings to the side of the glass. The wonderful aroma consists of piney hops with a touch of grapefruit citrus. Some nice malt in the aroma also. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and mostly smooth, with just a touch of carbonation on the sides of the tongue.  Taste is amazing for an IPA. For starters this ale isn't shy on the hop bitterness, but it balances the piney and citrus hop flavors with a moderate malt sweetness. The piney hop bitterness is really accentuated in the long finish. I would never have guessed this IPA was over 7% abv. It goes down smooth with plenty of flavor. I could see this being dangerous. Great IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Appearance: Amber, cloudy; thin head with adequete lacing  Smell: Hoppy goodness with hints of pine and malt  Taste: Hop kick in the beginning with a malty finish  Mouthfeel: Bitterness throughout with a lingering finish  Drinkability: Sippable and goes well with lighter meals or even a burger; a decent all around IPA",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,diamondc,4.27,"Straight into a generic pint glass .. at first there's a 1/2 inch of head leaving some nice ring-like lacing on every gulp. Hazy, dark copper colored. A nice cap of foam stays until the very end.  Right when I pried open the cap, the dank, earthy pine'ness went straight to my nose. All I could say was ""Oh Yeah!"". After a few swirls and heavy sniffing I get some peppermint and grapefruit.  There isn't that much sweetness you get from a typical IPA. The herbal, piney'ness dominates the tongue. Lemon zest, grapefruit skin and some peppery spiciness show up at the end. Good stuff.  I really enjoy this beer. Can't really complain about the carbonation and body, they are spot on for an IPA. I wish it had a bit more sweetness to it because the herbal & pine flavors can become a bit too much even after one bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Bitter. Smaller citrus flavor. Lingers on palate longer than most IPAs. Numbs tip of tongue, immediately. Then attacks roof of mouth 2 seconds in. Even numbed upper lip.  Despite high IBUs, mouthfeel was balanced and full and complete.  Medium.

140,30420,JMD,4.26,"A: Pours a Rich copper color with large fluffy head that settles very slowly. Leaves moderate lacing down the glass.  S: Citrus and piney hops, some malt and an almost herbal aroma. This is the one thing that I was disappointed with in this beer. The aroma is too faint, I really had to concentrate to find it.  T: Big punch of hops right up front, with huge citrus and pine notes. Carmel malt is also present which gives this beer and underlying sweetness. Also some herbal and medicinal flavors. But the hops are the star here, they leave a nice residual bitterness that lasts quite a while after each sip.  M: Full-bodied ale with moderate carbonation. Great texture, the hops coat your entire mouth and you drink this.  D: This is a fantastic brew. I've read some people comparing it to a APA, but in my opinion this falls somewhere in between an IPA and a DIPA. Huge hop punch, but a nice malt balance that lends a sweetness and depth of flavor. Either way, it's top notch.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,SurlyDuff,4.17,"Enjoyed this a few times in bottles, but this review is on a half pint I had in Chico at their brewery. Let me start by saying I like this more than their Pale, which is a pretty strong statement. Not that their pale is supurb, buts its consistently a perfect fallback beer. I'd like to see this have the same distribution as pale.  It's a ramped up pale ale, but not quite an IPA in my opinion. I think i'd consider it a .5IPA. Pours a rich copper color with a reallly nice head sitting aloft. Bright crisp hop aroma and flavor. Citrus, slight pine, and a good balance of sweetness to bitterness.

A rich dense golden copper color...  S - Solid hoppy aroma... Quite pleasant without being overpowering... Overall quite piney, but some subtle sweet citrus notes... Faint malt backbone... Slightly floral...  T - An interesting mix of hoppiness... Perhaps it's the new citra hops, a variety that I'm not too familiar with... Some watery sweet citrus... Faint herbal notes... Bready notes with a mild caramel presence...  M - On the thin side of medium bodied... Lots of carbonation, though it only packs a modest bite... Slightly creamy... Mildly chalky... Astringent aftertaste... Overall, surprisingly smooth...  D - A solid and slightly above average IPA... I prefer to the SNs Celebration Ale...

Impressive.  Smell- A heap of grapefruit scents. Not as Piney as most IIPAs. Scent doesn't stick around long, kinda faded with the head. I was a little dissapointed.  Taste- Hoppy bitterness. Citrusy. Not sweet at all. Very sharp bite. Would go great with a sharp salty cheese. It's simple and it tastes good, nuff said.  Mouthfeel- Very crisp. Light-bodied. Highly carbonated.  Drinkability- At 7.2% it's one of the lighter IIPA's, so you can have a couple or 4. It's a nice beer that you don't have to think much about, so it's great when you're out with friends.  Overall- Very good beer. Not outstanding. The only complaint I have is that it lacks the sweet finish that I've come to really enjoy from an IIPA. Still, I will gladly drink this again.

S-Piney and citrus hops, but nothing especially prominent. Seems like a hopped up version of their Pale Ale I had earlier tonight.  T-Better balanced then their Pale Ale.

On the palate it's aggressive yet delicate. Medium bodied with tropical fruity flavors and a bitterness akin to orange peel. Dry through and through, left nice lacing all the way down.

T - Not as citrusy as most IPAs. It tastes ""toasty"" for an IPA. A little bitter. Very nice.  M - Thicker than most IPAs but not as thick as a double.  D - This is a really nice IPA. I like an IPA with a bit ""extra"" to make it stand from the crowd. This is a great session beer for a true hophead and one of my favorite offerings from SN.

140,30420,DanOLeary,4.62,"Aroma: Medium hop aroma greets the nose with grapefruit and light lemon. Malt sweetness and Melanoiden aromas are present behind this West coast hopped ale with some bread aroma's sneaking though.  Appearance: Pours a brilliant and deep ""brewhouse"" copper with filtered clarity. Cream colored head holds a froth like the foam of lapping waves along the beach.  Flavor: Spicy and citric hops bite the tongue with the first sip. There is a thin presence of toasted grains in the middle, which becomes more prevalent as the beer warms. The malt profile quickly gives way to a drying hop bitterness with a clean finnish.  Mouthfeel: Medium body along with medium carbonation combine with the bitterness to create a full but clean feel on the tongue. The hops are lightly astringent on the finnish. Effervescent.  Overall: An excellent example of a beer that celebrates the beauty of hops. While there is a light astringency it's somewhat welcome in this heavily hopped ale. I wouldn't mind some haze in the appearance to accentuate the bold use of hops in this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,josiahschlender,3.75,"A friend gave me a bottle of this... I'm always up for a Sierra Nevada, especially any IPA from them!  Pours an attractive copper and gold into my pint glass, decent beige head leaves a bit of lace.  Pine resin, earth, and floral nectar are the hop aromas, which dominate the faint, but discernible caramel malt sweetness. The label reads ""Extra IPA,"" but it seems kind of underpowered for the moniker, especially an IPA which is toeing the line double IPA line.  Those aromatic hops are also dominant in the flavor, with the malts opening up as I let the brew warm some. Still, This beer lacks balance that I was hoping for. If anything, I think the ""extra"" in this IPA is the bitterness, which is quite ample and understandable. Good, medium to full mouthfeel, with a long finish is one of the best things about this beer, definitely giving it a quality feel that I've come to expect from SN.  Hmm, I wanted to love this beer, but this hophead has come away kind of disappointed. Too much bitterness, too high ABV for session, but not in the tasty league that their seasonal IPAs occupy. Also, not in the league of heavy hitting double IPAs. I'm going to give it another try for sure, but I just don't think it has the return factor for me that their Pale, Celebration or Anniversary ales have, despite the good value. Stay tuned for a second taste...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,barleypopmaker,3.85,"Light amber in color and quite clear. Pours a dense white head and leaves a thin film sitting on the beer. Nice lacing left in the glass as you work your way through.  The malt character is of soft caramel. The hop aroma is a bit light but is reminiscent of fresh cut pine, sweet peeled orange, and mild grapefruit. The hop aroma is definitely there, but not extremely assertive. I was expecting a lot more with the name ""Extra IPA"" on the label. I was expecting something extreme and extra above and beyond your typical IPA. I was let down in that aspect. Still, the beer reminds me of clear summer day. Overall the aroma is not as bright as it could be for an IPA, but still quite nice.  Carmel in the malt along with just the slightest of toast. The hops dominate the flavor without a doubt. There is a resinous sticky pine bitterness that dominates in the front before giving way to a grapefruit center. The hop finish is a blend of pine and grapefruit and lingers quite a while. I like the flavor a lot more than the aroma. The malt profile is not very complex but it works for this beer with is obviously showcasing the American hops as it should be. This may be one of those beers that someone who is only warming up to IPA's may not care for at the start of the glass but by the end they will be asking for more. The flavor is bold but yet not split-your-tongue bitter.  The mouthfeel is medium and creamy. The carbonation level is appropriate for the style, which is also mid-range. The finish is fairly dry but there is just a hint of sweetness that lingers.  Overall this IPA is very good, but I would like to have seen a bit more hop aroma. I heard a lot of great things about this beer and was excited to try it. I have to admit I was let down by the aroma. Their version of the Pale Ale Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the quintessential example of the American Pale Ale standard and I am afraid to say that the Pale Ale has a lot more hop presence in the aroma than the IPA does. Still, the flavor makes up for it in the end and this beer is definitely a winner.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste: Definitely a SN taste with hop bitterness and some alcohol flavours. A typical SN bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Light-to-Medium bodied. A fairly dry finish.  Drinkability: Tremendous drinkability, especially with the higher alcohol content. I could easily drink a number of these.

D: for it's price and its ABV (let's not kid ourselves..) it is a great go-to IPA.. Is it a great IPA in general?? ehhhh.. you be the judge!

Strong pine bitterness that sticks to the back of the tongue with initial citrus undertones. Residual bitterness.  Torpedo should not be compared with the best double IPAs.

It tasted like pine and apple and caramel malt, with some lemon zest and a bit of yeast. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall it had a nice crisp flavor, and was pretty well balanced. It had nice body and hid the alcohol well. The bitterness lingered some, but it was still easy enough to drink.

140,30420,blackearth,4.19,"Purchased from Blatz Market & Liquor in Milwaukee, WI. Poured into my Sam Adams beer glass, this one had a dark copper body with pillowy white head that fell to a nice cap and had good lacing. The aroma is floral and peppery hops. Full bodied and thick, this is an explosion of hop resins in your mouth that stick to your tongue and seem to last forever. I can tell the malts are there from the thickness of the mouthfeel, but the hop bitterness overshadows any sweetness. I can't call this balanced, but any hophead should love this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Great bitterness at the front that continues through your entire tasting. Slight, but enough, malt backbone to keep this from being too bitter in my opinion. After taste of citrus rind. This is a great IPA. Very drinkable and a good choice for the everyday type of beer. I think I paid $7.99/6 pack so it is a good deal too, that is if you can find it!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,redmagik99,4.12,"Amber/orange beer, nice head, good lacing. Smell is really great - hops of course, but in a unique way that strongly suggests tropical fruit - mostly pinapple, and as always, the cascade grapefruit. Taste is also quite original. No one would doubt that it's an IPA, but the torpedo in the brewing process definitely accomplished extracting hop flavor. I can almost taste the leaves. This one is about as fresh as you can get. Hop falvor WITHOUT the bitterness, though? that's another story. This beer is definitely bitter. And it should be. This is not my favorite IPA, nor is it my favorite from sierra nevada, but i am damn grateful that it is a widely available, affordable year-round brew. My feelings about it have been mixed throughout my numerous tastings. I feel like if you're out drinking a bunch of different beers and socializing, this one can kind of get lost in the shuffle. But now as I sit down and try to pick out everything that's going on, I realize that this is a truly well-crafted, complex IPA.

Really nice resiny, hoppy pine bite with just a hint of fruity orange and caramel malt. Well balanced and hugely drinkable for such a readily available and affordable beer.

I'm already a huge Sierra Nevada fan, but now they've got me for life. Bravo Sierra Nevada!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,lucasbm,4.17,A - White head that lingered. nice lacing. beautiful reddish copper color. S - Very piney and floral T - All hop at first. A little spicy and peppery. The malt makes an appearance as it warms. Plenty of extra in this extra IPA. M - Medium carbonation. Maybe a little light on the tongue. D - It's hard not to like this beer. Very Hoppy but not completely over the top bitter. The Aroma was probably my favorite aspect of this beer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,schmitter,3.77,"Poured a light reddish gold with about a finger head and fair lacing. Smell wasn't much, not too hoppy or spicy; I likely couldn't differentiate it from the SNPA. Not too spicy in the mouth, but a pleasant hop presence. Piney aftertaste. I've read up on the definition of 'session' beers but I offer this; great taste, good price, and an above average ABV is what I like in a session beer, so there, this is the first time calling a beer definetely session-able.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Medium-bodied on the palate, with a mostly-thin texture and average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Flavor was quite hoppy... long duration with a very bitter, dry finish to it. Wow... a very impressive IPA that, with some other recent entries, is helping me open up to the world of hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mjryan,3.46,"Extra IPA, hmmm. Amber coloured with plenty of head. Sticky lace all over. Aroma is weak, not much going on. Mildly piney with way too much bready malt character. Smells a lot like their pale ale. Flavour is bready malts and generic hops. A bit piney with a large bitterness in the finish. Lively carbonation that is not overdone. Very quaffable considering the high ABV. Good beer, not great. Sierra Nevada makes solid if maybe a bit uninspired beers. If they could get more hop aroma and flavour into this beer it would be stellar.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - Strong and crisp piney hops, but also floral at the same time...  T - Exactly what you would expect from what they call a ""Extra IPA""... Very strong, almost sweet and spicy floral hoppiness... Low malt character, yet as it warms, the maltiness becomes present in the aftertaste... very nice...  M - moderate carbonation... nothing special... wish they would have developed a better mouthfeel to go with the nice taste...

The head that is created is not around long and the orange/yellow hues are nice with visible carbonation activity. The hop and malt aromas are well constructed with the malt cutting slightly the hop bitterness. The hoppiness is perfect for the style's goal. The smooth and crisp characteristics allows this to be an any occassion summer favorite.

140,30420,nickfl,4,"A - Pours with one finger of off-white head on a clear, copper colored body. The foam settles quickly and the lace is reasonable.  S - Strong pine hop aroma with a little bit of citrus. Toasty malt in the background that blends nicely with the hops.  T - Big pine hop flavor and lots of sweet, toasted malt. The resinous pine notes from the hops blend with the sweet caramel malt to produce darker, tobacco like character as the flavor develops on the palate. It cleans up quite a bit in the finish with some fruity yeast and moderate bitterness.  M - Medium body, moderate-high carbonation, and a fairly dry finish.  D - This is a pretty nice IPA that, not surprisingly, is kind of like a bigger, badder SNPA. The hop character is robust and very fresh, but a bit one dimensional; it is all pine. The best IPAs I have had feature a more complex hop profile that showcases more than one facet of hop flavor. This is a good IPA but due to lack of complexity is falls just short of great.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

On to the beer:  Copper colored body with hues of orange, the finger thick head forms and holds up well while leaving a good display of patchy lacing. The aroma starts off hoppy and piney, but the hop burst fades into some bready malts, alcohol, and esters.  There's a lot going on in the flavor. Pine starts off the journey. Grape skins and nectarines follow, but with a low intensity. The extra kick of alcohol in this beer gets in the way of things throughout, even as it warms. There's a good share of bitterness found. Mouthfeel is right on the spot for an IPA, not too bubbly, easy, medium...and surpringly the booze doesn't numbs my senses. Finishes is pretty clean, with crackery malts lingering on in the aftertaste.  There is some good in this beer, but the alcohol washes over the levees at times. Not to mention the raw bitterenss gets in the way too. Methinks bigger levees or developing a flood control system would help this beer, because without one or the other, I will be hesistent to try this again given what's available on the market.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Nice long head retention and lacing all the way down the glass. I can't imagine a better looking brew!  Aromatic citrus and earthy hop mix on the nose. A deep inhale brings some slight malt but this is really all about the hops here. Although a very pleasant, almost flowery aroma, it was still not as strong as I might have expected.  Immediate hop punch right off the bat, with some more earthy or grassy notes and less citrus. As it rolls around over the tongue you begin to quickly appreciate the malty goodness that exists here too. Certainly the hops are the star here but those lighter caramel malt notes are nicely played. I really liked the carbonation level in this brew and the whole package really made for great weight and mouthfeel. The finish was mostly clean but there was a very cool dichotomy of malt on the tongue and hops deeper in the back of the throat that makes you really appreciate how this brew comes together.  I love hoppy beer and could drink this anytime but if you crinkle your nose at hops, this one may not be for you. Too bad, this is really a great beer. I would still recommend it but especially to my fellow hop heads. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,chrhowe,4.37,"Poured out of a 12oz bottle into an Arrogant Bastard Pint Glass.  A. Pours a dark, coppery amber with a thick cloudy hue. A fairly vigorous pour left me with a one-fingered head that dissipated rather quickly. The upside, however, was good lacing throughout the experience.  S. Huge Hops! Duh, right? Lots of citrus, tons of piney tones that scream ""DOUBLE!"". Also presents a decent malt aroma as well, but the hops obviously win out in the end.  T. More sweet malt up front that I expected. Quite tasty! This has great balance. But as a taste goes on the hops do their job and take over. Colossal grapefruit and pine flavors from this colossal IPA. As this brew goes down there is a subtle heat hitting me, but not for long, and a few minutes later I'm ready for another sip.  M. Big hop flavor character and fairly high carbonation. Pretty creamy at first from the sweet maltiness. However this beer leaves the palate with a nice hoppy, bitter flavor that most hopheads adore.  D. Very good for a ""hop bomb.""

Slightly more hops than malt, which is the way an IPA should be.  M- A nice level of carbonation accompanied by a great hoppy finish.  D- Very drinkable beer, a great IPA.

Citrus, pine and tropical fruit countered by slightly sweet toasted malts.  Feel: Relatively low carbonation, medium body, very smooth for a regular IPA (maybe this is why it is ""extra"").

It is potent enough to drown out any sense of a malt backbone.  Taste - The malts step up more at the taste while the hops refuse to retreat. The citrus is strong and there is a stiff pine that I missed at the smell.  Mouthfeel - This is thin. I wouldn't call it light-bodied but it's definitely not medium.

The nose is dominated by the hops with citrus playing the lead and some pine notes mixing in.  A heavy palate where the oils from the hops are definitely felt. The flavor is again dominated by hops. There is a weak toasted malt character in the background which provides a semblance of balance. The hops build with waves of citrus--grapefruit mostly--and flowery hops before it finally exits.  This is a well made brew, definitely hoppy. I think it is pushing the envelope toward a double IPA.

Plentiful carbonation threads and plentiful lacings. Crystal clear. Excellent!  Smell: Heavy hop presence. Some earthy pine presence. American ""C"" hops jump out at you. Nice, but expected for a double IPA.  Taste: Extended flavor curve. Heavy hops kick in just after onset. Malt is minor but more of a compliment to help the hops shine. There are several ""interesting things"" going on in the flavor curve. Some are hard to pick out because of the heay hop presence, others compliment the hops, and others stand on there own because they stand out from the hops. This isn't the strongest IPA that I've ever had, but it is one of the more interesting flavor character IPAs.  Mouthfeel: Very heavy on the tongue and character. This is expected for a double IPA, so this isn't necessarily bad. This would be paired well with a strong cheese, Chicago pizza, or another heavy flavored item.

I think it just got poured off as I've seen this one with a better head before. Smell is very good, very hoppy. Smells citrusy and piney and just smells very good overall. Taste is just as the smell would lead it to be, citrus and pine hops. Kind of bitter all the way though and has a pretty piney after taste. Really great taste, especially when it warms up just a bit.

Appearance: Copper penny-like coloration with 1-inch, two-finger head that laces weakly down the side of the glass, but head retention is solid and head is fluffy and white.  Smell: Slight skunky-ness to the aroma with malts and northwest hops of pine and grassy nature to them. Nothing too strong or fragrant, but pleasant and clean smell in nice balance between hop and malt.  Taste: Very pleasant. For a 7.2% the alcohol never really burns or makes itself felt, with the initial flavor being that of a biscuity malt and piny hops with the bitterness coming on the back-end and building with the hoppy finish. Tasty and not too strong, but rather in solid balance and clean combination of hop and malt.  Mouthfeel: Not too creamy nor carbonated, nor really all the oily or resiny. Finish is hoppy and more bitter, with the opening up leaving a more slick finish and full taste on the palate.  Drinkability: A nice, sessionable IPA that I don't think I'd have too much a problem drinking 3 of in a sitting, but like any IPA, the hoppy taste definitely fills the palate.

Poured this brew into a pint glass on a hot july night. Perfect pour, great head, great rentention. Smells mostly hoppy and piney, with just a hint of citrus.  Went in for the first taste...excellent! Quite hoppy and piney, just like the smell, with a hint of an orange taste. This beer is very well balanced and there is nothing overpowering about it.  After drinking three of these rather quickly, I felt a nice buzz. When I checked the ABV of this beer, I was shocked to find out that it is 7.2%. Wow, it certainly doesn't taste like it.

Great retention and lacing.  Nice balance to the aromas: strong bready center off-set by a sweet citrusy hoppiness. A little grassy. Hints of maple and bourbon. Very nice.  The flavor travels well - begins with a touch of sweet that blooms quickly into a big, bitter hoppiness in the middle and sides of the tongue, then fades out nicely. Slight aftertaste of the breadiness again.  Moderate mouthfeel - just right.  This is a great IPA. Very drinkable, great cold on a summer evening.

Smell is piney hops but not that pronounced.  Taste is very good. Mostly piney hops but some floral and citrus aspects as well. Can't detect the malts, but the beer is not a total bitter hop bomb either so there must be some balance here.  Mouthfeel is rich and crisp but not fresh-hops oily.

Lots of citrus and floral hops with a faint pale malt foil - all about the hops though. Bitter, dry finish just the way I like it.

With all the amount of crazy-hopped IPAs on the market now, this was a welcoming non-overpowering flavor, the hops were just right. However, I found that the flavor had too much emphases on pine and grass. On the back-pallete there seemed to be a hint of sweet caramel.  It was a little hot and jumpy, maybe slightly over-carbonated for my mouth, but still was very drinkable in terms of hoppiness and ABV.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,jera1350,3.9,"Golden yellow color with thick light tan one finger head. Good amount of lacing.  Piney hops with sweet caramel malts.  Nice balance, but lacking in the piney hops in the smell. Not nearly as hoppy as expected. Alcohol is masked nicely.  Nice smooth almost creamy mouthfeel. Lighter medium bodied. Crisp and clean.  Great drinkability for an IPA. Great balance, not overpowering hops, refreshing. Very solid IPA from a solid brewery.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Moxley,3.43,"A - Pours a clear orange with thin off-white lacing.  S - Bitter hops with faint background malts.  T - Just had Troegs Nugget Nectar. This is a nice mild follow-up. The hop factor is definitely more balanced in this beer. I'm not a huge hop head so this beer has just about the right balance of hops and malts for me.  M&D - Not overly boozy, but you can definitely feel the warming on this beers 7.2ABV. Good choice for those who like hoppy beers but aren't looking for a hop explosion. Creamy sticky mouthcoating on the finish.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,malcontent,3.89,"Gorgeous dark orange hue capped by a steadfast finger and a half of sticky head. Lacing is copious.  Spicy, pine-y and a little bit of sawdust (?!?) on the initial sniff. Biscuity malt underlies with a fleeting touch of orange peel.  Damn. This is all NW hops all the way. Pungent, spicy, herbal, pine-cone, etc. Obviously, tons of bitterness but a real commitment to keeping the malt character viable; the hop bitterness, while pervasive, is clean enough to give a major break to the biscuit towards the end. However, the long finish is bruising in its bitterness.  Clean, crisp and almost light for something at 7.2% packing this kind of hop load. Not oily, not viscous nor is it overcarbonated. Still, this is a tongue-lashing brew and, because there is no real citrus/caramel malt character, the bitterness can become overwhelming.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Fine spotty lace clings to the side of the glass. Color is a deep ruby orange.  Nose- Wow! Pungent orange and lemon zest, ruby red grapefruit. My mouth starting to water.  Palate- Very nice, lemon zest, ruby red grapefruit. Mild pleasant bitterness. Some biscuit notes. Light sweetness, moderately long finish. Very good.  Mouthfeel- Dry slightly tart.

The aroma is big, flowery and hoppy. Notes of citrus and grapefruit. The hops are sweet, with a touch of pine.  The taste is herbal, earthy malt. Quickly followed by a sweet flowery hop. The taste is pine and grapefruit. Caramel malts work really well with the bitter resins.  The feel is creamy and milky. A little bite on the way down. Sticky and long-lasting.

Deliriously fruity nose, full of grapefruit, cherries, and grapes, along with some lemon-lime notes that suggest 7-Up. Caramelly and toffee-sweet with spicy pine notes, as well - this one is enticing! Juicy and thick on the palate - very malty and not really bitter enough, I'm afraid. In fact, except for its distinctly American hops, this one is almost like an English barleywine, saturated with brown sugar, brown bread, port, and honey. Too sweet, really, so even though it's got some complexity to it, it's just not that drinkable. I like my IPAs dry and hop-forward, dammit! If I want a barleywine, I'll drink a barleywine!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA poured a bubbly copper with a thick three-finger head that had great retention and left rings of sticky lace.  The smell was strong with citrus notes. The taste, on the other hand, was weak--not remotely living up to the promise to the nose. The feel was very chewy, bitter, and dry--the only aspect of the beer that could be called aggressive. It was easy to drink; however, without much flavor, there wasn't much point.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Kromes,4.13,"Pours an amber color with a thick white head. Lots of lacing all the way down the glass. Smells slightly malty with some citrus and grassy hop aromas. Has a nice clean smell to it. There is a slight malt backbone to this beer and it is dominated by pine/citrus and earthy/grassy hop flavors. There is a lingering citrus peel bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly heavy and a little bit oily, but overall pretty good. This is a good IPA, no off flavors that I can detect, very clean good flavors and aromas, so this is very drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Overall I was expecting more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,OldSchoolGamer,3.51,"I have had pretty much all the Sierra Nevada products, and they are all pretty solid brews. Nothing too great, but most are pretty solid and highly hopped. Here is my review of Torpedo:  A: Pours a nice clear amber color. Large head dissipated rather quickly to a film over the top of the beer. Lacing is present. Looks good.  S: I don't get a lot on the nose. Very subtle. Smells pretty much like sweet hops. Not much complexity in the aroma.  T: Does not taste like a typical IPA. I get a lot of fruit, but not citrus fruit. More like apples and pear. A little pine and pretty sweet. Finish is very clean. Not much lingering taste at all. Maybe a touch of bready malt and citrus, but not a lot. Tastes similar to Bigfoot, but with less hops and much less malt. I have had better from Sierra Nevada.  M: Medium bodied and crisp. Not dry at all. Somewhat syrupy and sweet.  D: Its got okay drinkability. It is a little cloying, but the flavor is decent. I think I prefer the Pale Ale and Celebration Ale to this. Seems more like a Bigfoot light as opposed to an Extra IPA.  Overall, a decent beer. As far as Sierra Nevada goes, this is probably middle of the road. Just seems kind of lacking in all regards. Not very hoppy, not very strong, just kind of average. The flavor profile does lack the strong citrus and bitter notes that I look for in an IPA. I would buy it again, but not something I would go out of my way to get. Decent beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,marvin213,3.83,"Aside from the foamy cap, this beer could pass for a sweet tea. It's got a dark yet translucent glow about it. A brownish, orange hue makes me think this is a fall-time beverage. Sticky lacing evidences the hops, so I conclude that this tea-brew-looking hopper will indeed prove refreshingly tasty...its appearance, at least, suggests as much.  The citrusy hop-smell is certainly there, but I detect more malt than I have on previous occasions. I like the lemony fragrance, as the beer is again reminiscent of sweet tea (with lemon, of course). I'm hopeful, however, that the hops I taste are pronounced like the laces as I see rather than subtle like the hops that I smell.  The taste is a well-balanced, expertly-crafted extra IPA. I'm ecstatic that this light little hop brew with a touch of lemon is available at my favorite Charlotte grocer. I find that very impressive, actually. When the West Coast breweries get these lemon hoppers right, they're delightful. I've yet to have one from anywhere else. The fact Sierra Nevada's got this thing so down to a science--available alongside my milk and cheese--quite frankly, it makes me proud to be an American. I keep wondering if I could brew this in a bag with boiling water. If sweet sea is distinctly Southern, I'd say this SN IPA is distinctly American. Though I gravitate toward extreme experiments more characteristic of DFH, this beer is undoubtedly a safely simple American craft beer.  Mouthfeel is a little on the light side, and the lemony carbonation makes it less aligned with my sweet tea motif and more in line with my occasional beer/soda comparisons. The hops are pleasant--prompting proper puckering--and the feel is consistent with what's got to be a well-established SN formula. In all regards, it's safe to say it's an at least a better-than-average beer from a better-than-average brewery.  Drinkability is solid. The hops, of course, are best enjoyed fresh, but this beer's appropriate for the autumn day it looks like, and a hot summer day like the sweet tea to which it also strikes resemblance. It's another solid winner from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,brokensail,4.22,"A: The pour is a beautiful amber color with a nice fluffy white head.  S: A huge hop aroma to this beer. Lots of citrus and pine, with just a touch of malt.  T: Unfortunately, the flavor falls a bit short of the nose. Good grapefruit and pine flavors providing bitterness with some sweet caramel malt.  M: Medium body with substantial carbonation.  D: This is a nice standby IPA that is quite affordable as well as good tasting.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Like the smell, the hops are definitely present but not as overpowering as some IPA's.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and cleansing.  Overall, this is a very drinkable brew. Very enjoyable. Not an overpowering IPA, but much more balanced than most. Highly recommend this brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

One of the better bouquets of any American IPA.  T- Hops plus more hops with a decent caramel-malt base. Not an overwhelming hop bitterness, but definitely the main pupose of this brew.  M- Strong hop bitterness at start and finish, adequate malt backbone in between. Not as malty as their Celebration Ale, but enough to balance out the hop explosion.  D- Very quenching for a 7.2 ABV beer. I've got to keep this in mind before I turn this into a summer session beer.  I've heard this compared to an amped up version of SN pale ale, but I find this to be a brew all it's own.

And keeps strong the whole way through.  T. Its is a solid IPA, it is a very good rendition of the Mid pacific IPA. Its a bit more balanced then some IPA's but this is to its benefit. Each Hop note is clear and strong and not muddled by any leaft overtones from an over hopped IPA. IT has a good caramel malt backbone to keep this beer standing up. Well Balanced.  M. Medium, the strong carbonation keeps it light on the pallet. Dry finish makes you want, no, need anther sip.  O. This extra IPA is a very good interpenetration of the mid pacific IPA.

140,30420,HopHed,4.5,"APPEARANCE: A beautiful, deep, bright amber color, bordering orange, with a small white to off white head with nice lacing.  AROMA: The first thing out of the gate is the freshest smell of hops I've ever smelled in a beer. It's that distinct grapefruit bordering on pine scent that is so common, and wonderful, in IPA. Only, in the Torpedo is more concentrated and stronger from the time you pop the cap to the last sip.  FLAVOR: This beer has a distinct and noticeable hop character, and the Magnum Hop really comes through. The malt is perfectly balanced, in my opinion, to keep the harshness of the hops subdued. Don't get me wrong, though, this is all about the bitterness of the hops. While not huge, by some standards, the 7.2 ABV is hidden very well by the layers of flavor. The most noticeable are the grapefruit (rind), pine, a slight almost black pepper notes. Also I noticed, especially when it started to near room temp, an odd almost fruit character about this beer. After researching the Citra Hop used in the beer, I am guessing that this is where the fruity notes come from.  MOUTH FEEL: A medium-bodied beer, but extremely well balanced. It's on the higher side of carbonation, which I think helps really coat your mouth with the beautiful taste of this hop bomb. I think the best part is how the taste lingers on the palate long after you've swallowed.  NOTES: Sierra Nevada is known for their use of American Whole Cone Hops. I think this amplifies the fresh, dare I say almost dank, smell and taste of hops in this beer. I had this wonderful 7.2% ABV poured from a bottle into a pint glass, and straight from the bottle. This could easily be my go to summer beer, with as crisp and fresh as it is. I could, once again, see the 7.2% making it tough to really session this beer, but it is the kind of beer you need while working on a laptop from a hammock... Which is what I'm doing right now!

Has a solid, toasty, bready malt backbone that balances it all out nicely. Some floral hop tones blend with the malt flavors in the aftertaste. Moderately bitter. Tasty, full flavors overall, really better than I expected.  M - Medium bodied with a nice, crisp feel. Slight piney resin feel.  D - Very drinkable IPA. I was pretty impressed with this offering, and for slightly over 7% abv, it was very easy to put down. Interesting hop flavors and a well balanced beer.

140,30420,asabreed,4.13,"12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: A copper color with a hint of amber and nice bubbles floating up. For an IPA there's a ton of drippy lacing and minor sporadic sheets, along with big drops hanging out around the top of the glass.  Smell: Good citrus and rind-like bitterness, some caramel malt, and bready, doughy malt sweetness are balanced pretty damn well here.  Taste: What makes this so sessionable is the pungency of the citrus and pine bitterness, but there's a good backbone of bready malt and caramel to balance everything out so well. Finish is mostly hoppy and resiny, but again there's still enough malt sweetness to keep things in check and melded so well.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with good, full carbonation, and coating as any.  Drinkability: One hell of a year-round IPA, especially for the price and the quality. SN did a good thing with this.

A bit of bready malt to balance it out, but not as much as I'd prefer. More or less a souped-up SNPA.  M: Medium-bodied, quite resiny.  D: I'll admit being somewhat skeptical initially given SN's track record of creating same-ish hoppy pale ales. But this is a very solid IPA. Don't take my word for it, though. Give it a try.

S: Very intriguing and complex. There's a solid malt bill here of bready, caramel, and pepper like aromas. Citrus and floral hop aromas are the primary focal point, however. A solid aroma, worthy of a 4.5 if it was a bit bolder.  T&M: Great flavor. Big flavors of citrus and floral hops are met nicely with a peppery, bready malt flavor that really provides a great backdrop. The finish is drying and more piney and herbal, with a reprise of dry maltiness. It's complex, yet clean. A well crafted beer, like most other SN offerings I've sampled. Body is medium and strongly carbonated, also fairly resinous and sticky. Definitely to style, but not uber-sticky or worthy of the higher score.  D: This is a big-ish IPA, so it's not REALLY drinkable, but still quite good. It's about darn time SN put out an American IPA--and this one is great.

Orange pour with a generous white head, good retention and lace. Strong c-hop aroma, but nicely balanced by a firm maltiness. Almost perfumed flavour, with grapefruit and flowers, though at its heart there's a chewy breadiness. The flavours aren't as amped up as you would expect with a double IPA, but more intense than a regular IPA, so I'd suggest this is an IPA and a half. Full and slick mouthfeel helps out a lot.

140,30420,dfillius,4.25,"Poured into a pint glass  A: Moderate pour yields 1 finger of off-white head with good retention. Crystal clear dark copper liquid. Nice looking! S: Some earthy hop over clean malt skeleton, then citrus Ameri-hops come in and pack a punch. Very nice and complex. Some fruit esters. T: Malt and biting hops fight back and forth with hops almost dominating, but final flavor is biscuity malt. Pine, grapefruit, and white fir needles. Deliciously diverse flavors are well balanced. Marked down in points for boozy finish. M: Bracing bitterness and smooth overall. Well carbonated. A little syrupy. D: Solid. A little high in alcohol flavor/feel - so minus points there. But, overall...great!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,tr4nc3d,3.93,"Poured into my pint glass from a 12fl oz bottle  Pours a medium copper color with a slightly off white two inch head that resides on average. Lacing is left behind scattered around.  Floral notes with a grass/piney hop smell.  Very subtle notes of hops very floral like with a mild bitterness. Caramel malts give this a nice balance.  Medium bodied with high carbonation, crisp and smooth and refreshing.  Overall this is a good session beer to drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,sgoodship,4.45,"I have been itching to try this and haven't got around to it. I was secretly hoping it was going to be my year round Celebration.  A: The color is an attractive reddish amber. It has a slight haze but is fairly clear with large bubbles rising to the surface. The head becomes a three finger with little effort and it is a nice craggy off-white. Head retention and lacing are great.  S: Mixed bag of aroma. Citrus, floral, grassy, sweet caramel. You can tell it is big and robust. Promises a great deal.  T: Really nice progression with this beer. The sweetness hit me first. Mixes of sweeter fruit, grepfruit and caramel. The middle moves into a more bready and biscuity type maltiness. The finish falls headlong into an aggressive piney hop that is massive without having a bad bite. It's a lovely grassy dry resin end that makes you thirsty to pound more. So nicely done. Lots of moving parts but everything working together.  M: Medium body. Perfectly medium level of carbonation. Nice and clean with a good bite on the palate.  D: Delicious beer. It's not Celebration, it's something different but just as good IMHO. This is going to be my new go-to IPA. Great value and a nice, robust, complex and balanced brew. Really drinkable - dangerously drinkable. Man, I wish I had one right now!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,PintOHops,3.43,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance/Smell - Appears a lite golden/amber with a big frothy head, head retention is excellent, and leaves some patchy lacing. Has medium-high carbonation, it really just looks like a Pale Ale rather than an IPA. Smells of ultra dry, earthy, pungent hops! Super dry herbal, citrus notes tingle the senses, some grapes, hint of raisins, some fruity pineapple & grapefruit, basically like champagne dryness! Subtle grains & malt manage to break through the powerful & dominate hop profile, a little to dry & alcoholic overall.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of pungent & herbal hops, very dry and citrus like, lots of pine, followed by fruity pineapple, grapefruit flavors, not to strong though. Some sweet malty notes sneak in towards the finish, and quickly snap away with a load of alcoholic, dry bitterness, not to much complexity here, just very dry and bitter. Mouthfeel is slightly effervescent with some bite of carbonation on the tongue, a little smooth and medium bodied.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - Well I wasn't impressed with this one, it's dry & herbal in the smell, as well as the tastes, with no complexity or even some mild sweetness to balance it out. The intense herbal notes in the smell & tastes make it seem very fresh, that's about it, wasn't to great to me, or exciting. It tastes more like an amped up Pale Ale, or strong Ale, rather than an IPA, which was really something that through me off. All in all not bad, but I think Id rather just stick with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, I think that has more balance & complexity, and is certainly more drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

SN brews seem to always look great.  The aroma is full of herbal, earthy hops with a fruity edge. sour and red berry fruits with a spicy herbal balance. *Sweet caramel malty scent as well. ## sweet pine and sharp citrus  A very crisp and very hoppy flavor, it is very much like the classic Pale ale and IPA with perhaps a bit more red fruits involved. * Earthy tones abound! Followed closely behind with a wet, citrus and pine hop edge. SN brews always have a righteous, heady feel, medium bodied plus! crisp but smooth, almost full feeling. Not as complex as some big-boy IPA's out right now, but it's a classic example, if you like slightly less intense versions.* I'm staying With my original feeling of: tasty, but not huge complexity. Hops are excellent but rather mild compared to some big IPA's. ## heavy bitter earthy pine hop saturation.  *The balance and flavor is very good, hops are clean and vivid. Not a hop-bomb by any means, but certainly a fine example of a wide hop flavor spectrum.## west coast hop supreme.

140,30420,VaTechHopHead,3.95,"A - Reddish, orange, light brown color that pours clear with a thick off white head and good lacing.  S - Hops are pretty much all I got, fresh and very floral and earthy aroma.  T - Again fresh hops off the bat that are mainly piney, earthy but transition to a light citrus in the middle of the beer. Then comes a slight hint of malt, but only briefly, before returning to a piney finish and aftertaste.  M/D - It has a light body with medium to high carbonation and finishes very dry on the palate due to the hops.  A more extreme SNPA with a great hop characteristic and complex body.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BDLbrewster,4.12,"Pours a hazy golden orange hue with a frothy one finger head and a meager amount of visible carbonation. Sticky lacing grips the sides of my glass. Smells of lively pine resin scented hops and a mild sweetness almost like fruity caramel or candied citrus peel. The knockout blow.... The taste is so flipping balanced. Nothing is overpowering, a faint sweet, citrus flavor on the front followed by a subtle alcohol warmth. Then evened out perfectly with a less than overwhelming dose of pine forward hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is where it should be, ample carbonation and pretty crisp. A little less syrupy and it would have scored higher. Drinkability is extremely good for a 7.2% brew. Not a huge IPA but big enough and smooth enough to get you in trouble. Will seek out again and again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Hopped with magnum for bittering, finished with Magnum and Crystal, and dry hopped with Magnum, Crystal, and Citra. 65 IBU.  Pours out to a hazy burnt orange, forming a tall off-white head with superior retention and nice thick sheets of lace. Carbonation is mild to moderate. The nose can be had at an armful...full of juicy green hops with a background malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is smooth with a medium-dense body and a bone dry finish. The taste is a recap of the aroma, followed by a medium bitterness, which although potent is relatively smooth compared to other IPA's. The finish is very long and as the malt diffuses, one is left with a bone dry hop bitterness lingering on the tongue.  A decent IPA. I like the way it is initially balanced with the malt sweetness, but I don't care for how it ends in the grapefruit pith bitterness. Not quite a sessionable IPA for my tastes, although it's a good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,wnh,4.21,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a deep amber with a long-living, dense, creamy, rocky, gigantic cream-colored head rising above the lip of the glass and staying there. Lively carbonation, and a joy to look at.  Nose is fresh-squeezed grapefruit up front, with pine and spicy hops in the background. I'm not getting much beyond that, but this still smells great.  Taste is grapefruit hops up front that manages to be bitter and plenty sweet. The sweetness seems as though it ought to be coming from a more orange-leaning citrus hoppiness, but all I'm getting is grapefruit citrus. Interesting. Plenty of earthy pine hops to balance the sweet citrus. Well balanced on the whole, with a strong malt backbone and long lingering bitter finish.  Medium bodied and luscious, and very drinkable. A great IPA regardless of the price, and at $8.99 per six-pack this easily tops my ""Best Values"" list. Kudos to Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I also noticed some pear in the finish. The alcohol is slightly present.  M-Slightly carbonated, not too thick, just about perfect.  D-This is one highly drinkable ipa. I was expecting it to be much heavier. The 7.2% alcohol might hinder this from being a true session beer, but it is very easy drinking.  Overall, this is one great ipa.

Taste is hops brought too you by nice peppy carbonation. Fruity at first quickly into grapefruit rind bitterness that linger through the experience. Some light pine notes in finish not really any floral in taste though. Malt seems to be just transport for the hops.

Poured from the bottle into a glass. The beer was copper colored with a nice one finger, white head. The nose was all hop, most pine notes, with some citrus notes in nice balance. The taste was highlighted by pine notes and citrus notes. Some bitterness follows, bit it works great here. A slight caramel backdrop is present is the background. A tasty brew. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with nice, moderate carbonation. Drinkaility was high for an IPA.

Mouthfeel is fairly dry, and the hop bite creeps in as you drink it; thankfully not an overpowering experience. Overall a quality, well-balanced IPA with some interesting characteristics.

The mouthfeel a good show of brewing mastery. It is not thick or sappy but yet piney and resiny in taste.  It finishes with a bite as any extra ipa should. It is incredibly fresh and the lace on the glass showing rings with each sip is a nice touch. This is top dog for a 12oz bottle of an IPA.

Grapefruit hops dominate the aroma and the flavors. A big shot of grapefruit/orange peel hop bitterness leads off, but there is a bit of biscuity malt in the middle to provide a little relief. The long-lasting finish is again suitably hoppy. Sweet malt becomes apparent as the beer warms and persists into the finish. This is not a particularly complex taste experience. It's pretty straightforward so it's a good thing I like hops. Pretty easy to drink and pleasantly bitter on the tongue.

This beer starts of with a sweet malt flavor and finishes up with some awesome bitter flavor. There is also some citrus to this beer.  Mouthfeel: The beer is medium bodied and drinks pretty smooth. The carbonation is not bad, but I wish it was just a tiny bit more carbonated. This beer finishes really dry.  Drinkability: I really enjoy this beer and could definitely session it, but I feel like the hop bomb nature of it would kill any beer you have after it, unless its another torpedo ofcourse.

140,30420,pmcadamis,4.82,"A - This honestly looks very much like the standard SNPA, and that's not a bad thing. This might be a shade darker, but its still that vibrant golden-flax hue with a big fluffy white head and tons of foamy lace.  S - Oh my God. Hops, glorious hops! This is a hop forward nose that balances some of the juiciest hop notes that I've sniffed in a long time. The pine forest SN DNA is definitely detectable, but this adds more complexity than the standard APA version. Fresh, juicy, slightly fruity, and very sappy... this smells wonderful.  T - Even better than the nose, the flavors EXPLODE with fresh hop oils. The word ""juicy"" keeps flashing across my brain. This is like diving into a green hop filled wine press with bare feet and stomping around like a baptist preacher. Can I get a witness!  M - Medium bodied and FRESH. This is thirst quenching and highly carbonated, and all of those suds really help keep it lively and active in the mouth. It's almost electric with zingy hop flavors and zesty carbonation. This is as fresh tasting as ice-cold freshly squeezed OJ.  D - Perfect. One of the most well rounded (for a hop bomb that is) and drinkable brews that I've had in a long time. I tried one of these out at The Brewhaus and I'm sold. I'm going to pick up a large quantity of this stuff to keep around the house. This would be a perfect outdoorsy grillin' out sort of session brew. The hops would stand up to some spicy brats, and its dangerously gulp-able. Another impressive creation from Sierra Nevada... and I would have expected nothing less from the west coast masters of hop.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Don't get me wrong, its bitter (hence the ""Extra"" in the name), but since when does Extra translate to unbalanced? Its like the fat kid sitting on the end of the see-saw. Not only that, my pork tastes like a grapefruit rind.  Ah Sierra Nevada, I love you. I just don't love this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,superdedooperboy,3.88,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  Pours a nicely clear golden-copper hue with a thick off-white head of foam. Head shows moderate retentive properties, fading somewhat quickly, leaving behind a light amount of splotchy stick on the walls of the glass.  A nose of citrusy, slightly floral American hop aromas presents itself, with notes of orange peel and grapefruit. Aroma is somewhat subdued and none-overpowering.  Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated, with a base palate of slightly grainy and faintly sweet malt, glazed over with citric hop notes of bitter grapefruit peel. Hop bitterness builds toward the middle and back, lending a very dry finishing character that lingers on the tongue, with just a touch of malty sweetness.  The dryness lends itself well to drinkability, and this is one bitter hop bomb; still, while good, it fails to live up to the hype that has been vested in it by the beer rating community. Balanced well more toward the hop end of the spectrum, it fails to present itself as much other than a well-crafted and very well-hopped American IPA, which it holds to well but fails to become anything much more than that.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,biggred1,4.03,Orange amber with stiff peaks of foam that slowly melt over several minutes and leave sticky rings of lace all down the glass. The nose is leafy hop forward with a bit of caramel malt. The flavor is similar to the SN pale ale but with a more resinous hop flavor and bitter finish nicely balanced by caramel tasting malt. Warming alcohol in the finish. Medium bodied with crisp carbonation. A great addition to the SN year-round offerings.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Icehouse57,3.23,"I bought this beer in anticipation of great things. I LOVE Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, so had great expectations here... as I LOVE hops.  It poured a very nice amber color... clear, very nice off-white head...  It smelled of clean citrusy hops, but I don't think I picked up as much Cascade as I anticipated. Not an overpowering hop aroma.  The taste was the opposite of the aroma... Very pungent hop flavor. Wasn't as smooth as I expected. Now, I love IPA's.. and usually the more hops, the more I like it. I found this to be merely average.  It is quaffable, but not more than about 2 per session...  Overall, a nice beer, but I'll go with the regular old Sierra Nevada Pale Ale next time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

They are hoping to restock it for the rest of this summer.  A: Poured it into a tulip glass. It poured with a golden amber hue with a thick white head. I didn't expect that amount of carbonation so I had to wait a minute to pour the the last few drops into the glass.  S: It smelled unbelievable! Very clean spicy citrus aroma (thought is was Cascade at first.) I let the head subside before I took a sip...  T: I have to admit, I was a little disappointed here, expecting a hop bomb from the aroma. There was almost a ""soft"" bitterness to it. However, after letting the beer open up for about 15 minutes, the hop bitterness and flavors really started to shine. It has a very nice malt balance to it.

The smell is a mix of pine and citrus, very floral. The taste is a nice initial blast of hops but the shift to the caramel tasting malt just doesn't strike me well and it seems to accentuate the high alcohol content. I can appreciate their effort to make it a balanced beer, it's by no means horrible. The mouthfeel in general is fine, lively.

140,30420,barnzy78,4.23,"12oz. 2nd time having this 'Extra IPA' - first time was blindly tasted. Pours a bright orange with a nice foamy, creamy off-white head that leaves great lacing that sticks to the glass. Aromas are floral hops, citrus rind - mainly grapefruit, and pine. Initial taste is a sweet malty, biscuity backbone that is quickly taken over by the hops - grapefruit rind, and the bitterness is mild to start. Hop characteristics build though - more bitter, piny, dry, and acidic with each sip. Mouthfeel is juicy and oily - especially toward the bottom of the glass as the hop oils have coated the palate completely by now. Alcohol is well concealed throughout - not even the least bit noticeable. This is a solid American IPA, but as far as representing the style it's almost in a style of its own with its complexity and brewing techniques - close to an Imperial IPA. Price is outstanding - $6.99 for 6 - you can't beat it for a high quality brew like this!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - The aroma consists entirely of hops, but does not have as strong of an aroma as I expected.  T - The palate is dominated and coated with a citrusy hop flavor, and then gives way to a noticeable malt backbone, only again to have the hops dominate in the finish.  M - Medium bodied, with a good amount of carbonation. The taste remains on the palate long after the swallow.  D - Very full flavor. Aside from the higher ABV, I could easily see having a few of these. Maybe not as great as it was hyped up to be, but still a good beer from Sierra Nevada.

This beer got better as it warmed to room temperature. Piney, hoppy, and grassy. Taste has a crisp bite to it like putting your nose in a fresh bag of cascades. Small citrus character.  Not as assertive as I'd hoped and lacking compared to many other high ranked examples of this style.

140,30420,AVDeuph,3.96,"My first sampling of this beer. In fact, sadly I have not had too much Sierra Nevada, despite the availability.  A: A very enticing semi-opaque and vibrant orange that is darkened slightly by woody brown undertones.  S: Aroma is not as hop-encompassing or complex as I suspected it might be, but perhaps my serving is a little cold (in fact I know it is).  T: Different story. Lots and lots of hops. Floral and citrus hops completely dominate the mouth (got to be a ton of Cascade, maybe Centennial in this). Very bitter in the back.  M: Crisp and tightly carbonated, though not incredibly bubbly. Hop oils slowly coat as you drink.  D: Very good, and very drinkable. Perhaps the sharp bitterness keeps this beer from being sessionable. Alcohol is incredibly well-masked.  I really enjoyed this beer. A wonderful example of the style that I will definitely seek out again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Tetano,3.45,"First Review so bare with me:  Poured into my Stella Artois goblet, little to no head with thin lacing. It displayed a deep amber color akin to finely polished amber gems housing a prehistoric insect.  Smells of pine and citrus with a hint of that familiar grain smell of all beers.  I am immediately hit with the bitterness of the hops but it is lacking the typical citrus after taste I am use to with other beers in the same class.  Mouthfeel is thin and does not linger on the palette although the sting of the bitterness stays with you, which I happen to like.  Overall I like it, though I prefer others in the same style which have a strong citrus aftertaste that match the smell better. Like previous posters states its availability, price, and drink ability make it a win for me and would certainly pick up a sixer of this to share with my friends.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,MeisterBurger,3.98,"Pours a nice deep amber with a head that looks like it was scooped up fresh from the base of Niagara Falls. The lacing reminds me of the middle of a game of Space Invaders, but one where the space invaders win.  The nose is pure pine with some fruity undertones but it could be stronger.  At first blush I'm puzzled by the taste. It's there but almost not there. Strong and yet weak.  Now that I think about it I guess with the promise of an ""Extra"" IPA I was bracing my taste buds for impact and they were ducking for cover on the first sip. But it wasn't the over-the-top hop bomb I was expecting.  Anyway, now that I'm past that it's actually a really nice, finely balanced, bold and juicy tasting IPA. Like--you guessed it--grapefruit juice, specifically. The malts are of caramel and biscuit. The hops are piney and herbal and in good balance, and while it's definitely bitter, it's actually somewhat restrained for an IPA. Which is fine by me because this is a delicious beer. It lacks some degree of depth or complexity but, really, that just serves to make it highly drinkable for times when you just want to session an IPA while watching a ball game, say.  Medium bodied and almost creamy mouthfeel and a nice clean finish.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jdflyer06,3.4,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass.  A: Copper to deep amber, crystal clear with a rich thick head that makes it through almost half of the experience  S: A good amount of piney, hop character with some light citrus and pepper notes. I'm actually pretty excited by this point  T: Ugh. What happened to all of that hop goodness that was just in my nasal cavity? Heavy malt presence followed up by what comes across as unripe grapefruit and then an awful boozy finish. The alcohol presence in this one is less than subtle.  M: Thin, heavily carbonated and peppery on the tongue. The alcohol resonates in the back of the throat.  Overall, I was extremely dissapointed in this beer. I was expecting something more along the lines of an imperial/double IPA but should have paid closer attention to the ABV. It's thin, overly carbonated but on the plus side it goes with just about anything and you could easily down six of these in a sitting if you're not careful just because of the overall clean finish. However, I won't seek this out again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JimmieFrisbee,4.24,"Poured into a pint glass from 12 oz. bottle.  Hard pour gets a beautiful head to rise up, just a little more than two fingers worth of off-white frothiness. Beer is a clear copper color. Little bubbles rise to the top in single-file lines. Nice lacing the whole time, as well.  Smells phenomenal. A bouquet of citrus hops, with a little bit of floral and maybe piney for good measure. The citrus is really what is coming through for me. My favorite!  Taste is right on for the smell. Right on for what I want in an IPA. The hops are all there, all in harmony with one another, and there's a good malt backbone behind it, imparting just a hint of sweetness. So nicely balanced, just a little bit of bitter and the rest is flavor.  Good, full mouthfeel. Nicely carbonated. I could probably go on drinking these all night, but probably would get a little bit of taste bud fatigue after the third. Wouldn't stop me from reaching for another one, though. The alcohol would probably catch me a buzz after just a couple, but it certainly weighs in a little lower than some comparable IPAs, which is nice.  Easily to find, not outrageously priced, and absolutely delicious, this beer has a place in my fridge or at any gathering I'm attending. Because it's not overly bitter, might be a good introduction to the style for people who would like the type of IPAs I like.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Dotcubed,4.1,"I found it to be sold out in at my go to store, but since I saw the last six pack in a store in Chicago I had to get it.  Pours very foamy. Nice large foam. Honey colored.  Hoppy smell. Has lots of IPA smell.  Bright hop with some long lasting grapefruit. Sweetness backs it but really firmly on the bitter end. Hints of Guava or green Mango fruit. I want to call it balanced...  The problem is that the bitterness isn't something that goes away. It could be that it's so fresh it hasn't toned down much.  On it's own it's bitterness makes it challenging for my pallet. That's the only drinkability detriment. There's no doubt that this is ripe for spicy polynesian food.

140,30420,cheapxceptbeer,4.16,"Have been looking for this beer for some time, most places only have the pale ale and the seasonal so I am happy to be able to review it.  A- Copper colored ale with nice head and amazing retention/lacing.  S- Piney hops is the main thing in the nose, I don't notice much else, less than impressive smell in comparison to their harvest pale ale.  T- Wow, this is a delicious resinous, piney, and slightly citrusy beer. So well balanced that I may have a new favorite non-luxury (&gt;10+ sixer) single ipa. The finish has an interesting mineral flavor.  M- Oily and creamy, this beer does have a great feel to it, medium to full bodied with a hardness to it.  D- Well the alcohol is a bit high, however this is not an ultra-heavy brew, definitely sessionable, yet not really the way I like to drink it as after two you don't taste the hops as well.  I wish this was available at more liquor stores around me, as great as finest kind ipa is, this is a very welcome change of pace.

I had never heard of this until I saw it at the local Harris Teeter last week. I like my SN so of course I tried it and it lived up to my expectations though didn't exceed them by much.  The hue is a bright orange with a thick, bubbly tan head and citrus hop flavored nose. The head lasts at a half inch for quite a while and is pretty impressive. I expect excellent lace.  Bitter pine and citrus form the dominant flavors here. Unlike the recently reviewed Southern Hemisphere Fresh Hop ale, this is unabashedly unbalanced. I'm sure there is malt in there, but I really don't taste it. The texture is thick with medium carbonation and a bit of alcohol burn in thew aftertaste.

Label is classic Sierra Nevada, green this time, and the center picture depicts rows of hop plants in a field. 9 digit number printed on the label, but not clear on the brewed on date.  Appearance: Pours with 3 plus fingers of off white head. This settles somewhat, but still maintains a massive cap on the beer. As everything eventually settles, nice, puffy lacing remains. The beer itself is amber, trending towards red, with an ever so slight haze. No sediment in he bottle.  Smell: Dry hop aromas abound, grapefruit, citrus, and pine upfront against a semi sweet malt backdrop.  Taste: Bold and powerful hop flavors of pine and grapefruit, with an subtle, bubblegum like sweetness. Some hop bitterness in the finish, but the dry hops linger so long and so well, that it is still not the predominant flavor.  Mouthfeel: Average carbonation level, high enough to prevent this from being cloying. Body is good.  Drinkability: Another fine example of a higher ABV, dry hopped beer.

The color is a red-copper, with a soft head that dissipates quickly. Floral hops dominate the nose with a hint of pine. It has a hoppy taste but not near what I expected, the maltiness rounds out the end of a flavor that leaves a lot to be desired.

You can tell it has some body to it, just by looking at it.  Smell is a little underwhelming. For being an American IPA, hops aren't very noticeable right away.  Hops are in the back, not very present up front. But there are loads back there. Crisp finish. For supposedly being a ""hop bomb"", I don't really see it. Its got good mouthfeel, thick and heavy for an IPA. Pretty drinkable for an AIPA. Could easily kill a sixer of one of these, without my taste buds hating me in the morning.  Tastes pretty similar to standard SNPA. Hops are different, but along the same lines. The 7.2% abv is very well hidden.  Decent IPA, would def. drink again, but nothing I would actively search for.

Aroma is a sign of things to come, hops, hops and more hops. There is a faint biscuit, bread and caramel contribution from the malts, but it is mostly buried under the citric fruitiness. Nicely carbonates, it has again a very subtle malty breadiness to it, but the hop assault predominates, and eventually buries everything else. Sharp, bitter, herbal and citric. This is a solid, if overhopped (IMHO) IPA; considering the low price tag, it comes head and shoulders above a large chunk of the competition, if lacking a bit of balance.

I have found this beer for $8.99 for a six pack of 12oz bottles.  Leaves a head as large as you desire; white, light and pillowey. Very sticky lacing and excellent retention. Transparent with visible carbonation. Just about right. The color is light copper.  Smells of a nice combination of fresh, fairly dank hops. More on the piney side I'd say, but the citrus notes are definitely present as well. Very clean, well balanced. This one has Sierra Nevada's signature hop blend written all over it.  A very well balanced IPA. Great malt backing with its hop blend. Again, pine, some citrus and just an all around pleasant and clean taste.  The mouth is medium bodied and perfectly carbonated. Leaves just a mild grit behind on the tongue which leads to a lasting citrus aftertaste.  I've been buying a lot of expensive beers recently which adds up quickly.

Very low carbonation, almost looked cask conditioned.  S - Hops dominate with citrus and herb being predominate. Very clean and refreshing smell.  T - Hop bitterness hits hard and early. This is followed by good malt character in the middle with some sweetness from the crystal malts, no overwhelming hop flavors. Finishes with nice hoppy aftertaste which I think comes more from dry hopping than flavor additions.  M - Smooth, not a lot of left over sugars, lets the hops shine.  D - For a 70 IBU beer this is sessionable. Hops are delivered in a balanced manner with good malt taste. Good beer for the IPA fan without being as heavy as an imperial.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,dhd1491,4.08,"Pours slightly hazy, medium-copper-orange. Thin head of white foam. Not much aroma. Taste is big and viscous. Thick layer of bitter hops then sweet malts. Some butterscotch in the background. Mouthfeel is a bit oily. Goes down pretty easy.  Overall, a very good IPA. Great choice when you want one to sip and enjoy big flavors.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ALESwhatCURESya,4.01,"Wonderful glowing amber body with bubbly white foam head. The lacing was great and the body's clarity was very nice. The aroma was not as strong as I would have imagined. The hops do come through will some intensity but not in-your-face (like I like). Notes of piney, resinous american hops are quite evident. The taste is citrusy at the forefront and the grainy malt bill leads to a clean and dry finish. Flavor stays on the tongue for a while and reminds you that the hops are king in this beer, but the overall balance is very well done. One of those beers that would never be turned away and have enough depth and flavor to satisfy both the uber-hophead and the crossover explorer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,klewis,3.65,"A: Pours a bright golden with a moderate, frothy head. Moderate lacing.  S: Piney and resiny hops. Not much else, but still nice.  T: Citrus hop flavors up front followed by earthy tones. Leans heavily on the bitter end of the spectrum.  M: Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Pretty average for the style.  D: Not outstanding, but tasty and easy drinking.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Amalak,4.65,"Out of bottled beers that I've had, this was truly one of the best that I've had. It's smooth with an excellent bite but a perfect balance and a sweet undertone to it. It really it a perfectly balanced IPA.  I WANT to have on tap because it is SO GOOD out of the bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ThePortlander,3.88,"Poured from the bottle into a big mug.  This pours a phenomenal dark gold with shades of red as the light shines through. The head is delightfully thick and frothy.  The combination of Magnum and Citra hops come through quite nicely against the thick caramel malt. There's definitely some citrus on the back end, and the bitterness is evident.  The hops hit first and are clear, bright, and tangy with some lasting bitterness. The malt is thick and caramel-like. I'm not sure if it's because I'm not used to this particular pairing of malts and hops, but it's a little different to me. It's not a bad pairing, but it's not what I was expecting. The mouthfeel is very nice, perfectly thick for an IPA. The finish reveals a piney, citrus lingering bitterness.  Overall, I recommend this strongly. It's certainly something different, providing a thought provoking mix of flavors.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,SPRichard,4.45,"12oz bottle poured into my Sam Adams sensory glass  Orange/amber color with lots of carbonation coming from the laser etched ring in the bottom of my glass....large amounts of lace stuck to the glass  piney, touch of grapefruit, hops all well represented in the nose....i could probably close my eyes and tell this was a SN product  great balance of all the scents and flavors as you take the first sip  medium carbonation and a slight hint of a bite at the end  the ABV is a touch over 7% but that wouldn't keep me from drinking 2 or 3 in one night....also the price ($7.99/6pack) keeps me coming back for more  most people swear by NN here in the northeast, but to me the Torpedo from SN edges it out",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ColForbinBC,4.33,"12oz bottle poured into a pint.  Pours an orange amber with a huge, rocky bone white cap. Moderate visible carbonation and large amounts of sticky lace.  Aroma is of herbal hops, pine needles, faint grapefruit and sweet, sticky caramel.  What a terrific balance without being too balanced. Pine needles and herbal hops up front with a clean caramel sweetness that finishes with a grapefruit bitterness that lingers. The hop profile is very characteristic of SN. A very palatable flavor profile and rather enjoyable.  Medium bodied with solid carbonation and a lingering bitter finish.  If it weren't for the bitter finish and a higher abv, this score would be perfect.  A great addition to the SN lineup.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,kellywilson50,4.62,"Poured into a glass has an exceptional head and great lacing. There is plenty of carbonation that creates a steady stream of thousands of little bubbles. The aroma is very similar to what I remember of the Celebration Ale, but more pronounced. There's definitely plenty of essential oils being transferred in the torpedo. Flavor is also very similar to the Celebration, except lighter in body and more ""drinkability"". My favorite used to be the Celebration, but this has definitely taken its place. I hope they're able to keep producing it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,fank2788,4.23,"12 oz bottle served in a pint glass Wow great pour, beautiful bright copper in color with a huge IPA head that laces like crazy. The smell is all west coast hops floral and citrus very impressive this is definitely an IPA but with balance I can catch a bit of grain in there as well. The taste is upfront floral hop flavor yes the hoppiness is the main focus but it isn't overdone and it is all tied together with a firm caramel malt base this isn't just a hop bomb there is a solid beer at the heart of this one. The mouthfeel is nice and lively a good deal of carbonation mixes with the slightly puckering but not overpowering bitterness of the hops and a mild sweetness to create a great combination. Drinkability too is good, yes this is a 7% ABV IPA but the balance is so good that, with pacing, you could drink these all afternoon another winner from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Phyl21ca,4,Bottle: Poured a clear copper color with a large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of dry and citrusy hops. Taste is also dominated by some citrus hops with a nice clean bitter finish with some dry caramel malt. Hops are easily discernable but well balanced with great overall drinking factor. Body is about average with good carbonation. Nothing extreme about this one but very well balanced and easily drinkable.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,OldYoda,3.78,"Don't know why I waited to try this, considering I'm a huge SN fan. Poured from the bottle into a standard US pint glass. A very pretty amber copper with a limited head and some residual lacing on the glass. Nice looking beer.  Smell is a little more subdued than I was expecting - some pine, a little citrus and surprisingly I got a hint of malt. Very inviting.  Taste is excellent and you can certainly immediately id this as a SN product. I would fit this in right between their Pale Ale and one of their fresh hopped Harvest ales. I really like the balance on this.  Mouthfeel is well balanced with a good clean finish. Makes you want to dive right back in.  Drinkability a little limited for me, simply because of the ABV. But sipping a couple of these is just fine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,gabe23,4.1,"A - Clear copper color with a huge, foamy, off-white head. Nice retention and a copious lacing.  S - Mild aroma of pine resin with a touch of citrus and sweet malt. Definitely a muted aroma compared to a lot of other IPAs.  T - A sharp hops bite up front, fading into bitterness. Some citrus notes are present, but pine dominates. A little caramel sweetness balances things out at the end, but the bittnerness lingers.  M - Medium body with average carbonation. The finish is clean with no offensive aftertaste.  D - This is an easy drinker that I could have a few of. Unfortunately around here, it's almost the same price as other IPAs that I prefer more like 60 Minute and Two Hearted. Great bang for the buck if you can find it for $7-8 a sixer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mattster,4.22,"Opened 12 Fluid ounce bottle, poured into Nonic Glass.  Poured a nice frothy 1"" head that slowly dies, leaving lace on glass. Brew is a clear amber/copper liquid with nice bubble action.  Rarely do I smell an IPA and think ""Refreshing"" but this one has a nice and uplifting pine/citrus smell. Taste is what counts, and this one provides a nice, slightly bitter brew with nice citrus note, a tender pine forest floor.  Nice mouth-feel and finish, I feel like I could drink several of these, because the alcohol is very balanced.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,far333,3.83,"Clear copper colored with streams of bubbles rising up to an inch high light beige head that settles slowly leaving a ring of lace up the sides.  Aroma of honey, cinnamon, floral and citrus hops.  Flavor of balanced malt and hops upfront, morphing to piney hops and back to semi-sweet chewy malt with notes of honey and toffee. Finishes with a grapefruit rind bitter.  Full and rich mouthfeel, moderate to low carbonation. Tasty and drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,phantomwyse,4.08,"A: Pours a fantastic copper color with just a twinge of honey and perfect clarity. Thick frothy head builds to about a finger and half and then settles into a dense crown. Lots of quick moving carbonation, almost volatile.  S: Thick pine aromas, very sap-like. Loose amounts of citrus here and there, grapefruit predominantly. There's a candy sweetness displayed by the malts surrounding it all.  T:A good pine tartness washes over at the beginning moving to tropical fruits like mango and then heading in the grapefruit direction. The malts are well represented with a whole grain breadiness along with warm biscuit qualities. There's a brief glimpse of raw alcohol at the back along with a pleasant and lingering tartness.  M: Medium bodied, there's a peculiar sting, but also deceivingly silky.  D: I could certainly enjoy this more often, a well balanced IPA with subtle complexity revolving around the hop profile. I can't quite call this a bitter IPA, rather it's tart but never crosses the line, making it a superb beer for those who think hop bitterness get in the way or is over-rated.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Metalmonk,4.38,"As with so much Sierra Nevada stuff, this looks marvelous...big fluffy, creamy, long-lasting head which leaves a ton of lace stickage--and the color is an entrancing burnt orange/rust.  If you're familiar with S.N.'s many hop-based beers (pale ale, Anniversary, Celebration, Harvest, etc.) you'll recognize the smell. Herbal, grassy, piney C-hops. Clean, fragrant and fresh--and well-controlled. Obviously not meant as an over-the-top hop-bomb.  Full, fluffy, springy hops are the featured flavor. This hits all the great hallmarks of the hop: piney, rind-like, prickly, grassy, flower/herbal, exotic. Just enough malt to add balance, taking on a kind of rye-meets-brown sugar assertiveness. Flash of cinnamon/allspice. Excellent mixture of grapefruit, brown sugar and freshly-mowed grass in the finish.  Texture is almost perfect: fluffy and bouncy with just enough carbonation and an overall creaminess--lots of depth in this department as well.  Boy...wow...this is great. This would make a fantastic hops gateway beer. Yes, it's intensely-focused on the hops, but balanced and not at all harsh. I think some of S.N.'s hop-based stuff has been kind of samey, but it's always good to one degree or another. Torpedo is simply great; easily one of their best. This has already gained instant-classic status, and I'll add one more huge thumbs-up to that. Oh, and its ridiculously drinkable...this went down way, way too quickly...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,heintzer,3.8,"Appearance: A very pretty amber-golden, moderate head and not much lacing.  Smell: Sweet, with a little alcohol biting through some serious piney hops.  Taste: Straight off the pour, intensely bitter as you'd expect it to be. If nothing else, it's truth in advertising - I feel like I'm getting some extra IPA here.  Mouthfeel: Perfect carbonation, agree with other reviewers re: creaminess  Drinkability: Oddly, it's a long glass - a little too bitter even for a huge hophead at first, but it grows on you as it sits.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,brentk56,4.15,"Appearance: Pours a crystal clear amber color with a fluffy head; great retention and plenty of lace  Smell: Pink grapefruit; incredibly sweet and floral  Taste: The sweet and tart flavors of pink grapefruit battle one another to a crescendo by mid-palate; and then contrast with one another as the flavor goes into a lengthy fade; although I was rooting for a bit more attenuation, the sweet flavors wind up persisting long after the bitter ones have faded  Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation  Drinkability: Although the residual sweetness limits the drinkability, this is one fine entry into the world of the West Coast IPA for a neophyte; and not a bad refresher for one who has tasted more than their fair share",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TequilaSauer,4.32,"Been hearing a lot about this one. I've always appreciated SN's products, but I'll confess, I usually only buy their stuff if I'm at a grocery store and little else is available. The only SN products I'll buy outright even at a beer store are Bigfoot and Celebration. Let's see if Torpedo can make that list.  A - Puffy white head, much thicker than I was expecting. It settles quickly though. Hmmm. Very pretty amber color to the beer itself.  S - Wow. Great smell. Spices, pine, citrus, and fresh produce. Reminds me of Celebration for sure. This is a nice smelling beer.  T - Orangy sweetness on the attack, giving way to a veritable Hop swarm. It's as if my palette is the Rohirrim at Helm's Deep and that Hops are the Orc brigade. The first sip is almost offensive to the tastebuds, but it's also quite pleasurable, like getting kicked in the nuts by a gorgeous supermodel. Perhaps the craziest thing about this beer is how LONG it lingers after the swallow. It's there and it's staying there. If you want it to go away, you'd better dig out some bread, peanuts, or some other carb, because it's staying until you make it leave. But why would you want to?  M - Very pleasant and smooth with little carbonation, it's creamy in a way. VERY nice.  D - Though probably not as drinkable as Celebration (which is a tough comparison anyway as Celebration is one of my favorite drinking beers), Torpedo is one you can definitely enjoy, often.  If you're a Hop Head, this is not one to miss. It packs a wallop and doesn't relent. It is what it is and takes no sh*t about it. If you're NOT a hop head, your brain might seize up from bitterness overload, so be advised.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Buschyfor3,3.2,"Serving: 12oz bottle A: Actually, most of this beer was consumed from the bottle since it was at a frat party and my gf was drinking it but decided she didn't like it a couple of sips into the bottle. Oh well, so much for being a beer advocate haha.  S: Heavy scent of pine cones, pine resin, and some faint hint of citrus fruits. Just the faintest hint of a biscuity malt backbone, but only after the beer warms to room temp.  T: This is a pine bomb - the first blast of flavor is all pine cone and pine resin. This abundance of pine is followed by a faintly bitter grapefruit note. Thankfully, a fresh bread/biscuit note perks up mid sip. Finish dries and brings out more biscuity malt. Not very balanced - the piney/resiny hops overpower here, and what malt backbone there is seems timid and mostly an afterthought.  M: Carbonation is decent; overall mouthfeel is fairly crisp, with the slightest hint of creaminess.  D: In terms of ABV and drinkability, I thought it was comparable to DFH 60 - alcohol remains well in check.  DISCLAIMER: I'm not a huge IPA drinker, so take this with a grain of salt. SN Torpedo is a decent IPA, but I must admit that I'm not overly impressed given all the hype surrounding this beer. In KY, it's just as readily available as DFH60 or Stone IPA, but if I want an IPA, I would actually prefer both of those choices to a Torpedo. In all fairness, I did want to try it to see what the hype was about, but I think I would rather pick up IPA that focused on more than just intense pine/resiny flavors, and one that had better balance from the malts.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, fairly bubbly, pretty refreshing, leaving mouth really bitter.  Overall: Not bad drinkability, a little more bitter than preferred, nice hop character at the beginning but it turns to a strong bitter flavor.

Not much else in the aroma.  T- A little malty at first for an IPA, then the hops kick in. Again, more of a piney / grassy hop than a grapefruit one, but they were the right choice. Grapefruit would have overwhelmed the malt and the best aspect of this beer is the interplay between the malt and the hops.  M- Medium bodied, fair amount of carbonation. Finish is clean and crisp with no oily hop aftertaste.  D- Easy to put this one down, the 7.2% ABV is well hidden.

140,30420,jebert,4.09,"Appearance: Pours a bit cloudy amber, with a very orange hue. A diminutive head awaits you, perhaps an inch plus of off-white foam. Very cool looking bubbles and the head retention was good. The presentation is excellent. It cleared a bit after sitting.  Smell: The nose appeal is a bit mild but has a great pine scent with some orange lemon-like citrus. Did I mention the hops? Yes, they are evident and inevitable.  Taste: The taste of this beer rules. I was expecting something intense, given the name Torpedo, but it's incredibly balanced but flavorful. It's a race between the malt and the hops. Malt? Hops? Both are evident and balanced well. The dryness is very appealing and adds to the beer's character.  Mouthfeel: It's a medium bodied beer, to be sure. Not too light, not too heavy. The dryness isn't overbearing and makes the mouth feel a bit relaxed but not shy to receive more.  Drinkability: Sierra Nevada made this a year-round brew. I think, off the cuff, it will do well. I would have no problem having several in a night. The name is a bit over-stated. I think Torpedo means the consumer will be heading down...deep. This beer doesn't offer up the brutality one ""thinks"" it may contain, so perhaps it's a bit over-marketed. In the end, delivering less allows the consumer to repeat and repeat, stating at the end of the night that ""I've had x number of Torpedo's.""",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

And now what I've been waiting for... tasting! It's tastes go with the smell. It is dry and very hoppy, as should be expected. This will leave your mouth feeling very dry.

140,30420,mmcary,4.4,"I have been drinking as much of this as I can, hands down the best thing from SN in a while, although the fresh hop and celebration are also amazing!  A- Hazy orange pours smooth with little head and leaves a nice lace on the glass, a very nice looking beer.  S- Citrus and pine dominate the smell, very fresh.  T- the best aspect of this brew is the taste, it is dry and hoppy, not overpowering, but very nice for an IPA. I could drink this beer all night, the alcohol is well hidden and it is so refreshing.  M- dry and flavorful, it leaves a nice bitter aftertaste that makes you want more.  D- I could drink this all the time, I try to have this in my fridge all the time. It goes down smooth and leaves an amazing aftertaste, dry and bitter.  I hope I can get this year round, it is fantastic. I enjoy this IPA and think SN deserves high praise for this wonderful brew!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,siradmiralnelson,3.88,"Poured from bottle into Tulip.  A. Poured a moderate 1 finger head. Color is orange with a slight amber tint.  S. Citrusy hop aroma. Packs less of a nasal punch than other IPAs.  T. Nice hop taste. Taste the citrus thta was present in the aroma. Malt bows to the hop presence.  M. Nicely carbonated light-medium bodied.  D. Highly drinkable IPA. More Hop centric than malt, which is a personal preference.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,greengorilla,4.82,I poured this from a bottle into a pint glass.  It was orangish in color with a thick head and good lacing.  The smell was of floral hops and pine.  The taste was great with the hops dominating yet not overpowering the malt.  The mouthfeel was very smooth.  Overall this is a great drinkable beer that I will drink again routinely.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Jekster,1.88,"Appearance: This beer pours a pale golden orange with a slightly off white one finger head. It is crystal clear and the head dissipates to a thick and sticky lacing.  Smell: The aroma on this beer is mild for an ""Extra"" IPA. There are hints of fresh flower stems but also this funny musty wet leaf component. The citrus character is mild with only the slightest hint of spicy orange zest. There is a definite yeasty bread component to round out the aromas.  Taste: The flavors on this beer are shocking. The flavor is dominated by a hot alcoholic apple / warm white wine flavor. This is followed by a stingy hop bitterness but and a lemon rind bitterness like no other (not in a good way either).  Mouthfeel: This beer is too highly carbed and has a weak and thin light body.  Drinkability: No thanks. One is enough and I wouldn't buy this beer again.  Overall Impression: I hope, hope, that this was a poor six pack of beer. I respect Sierra Pale, but this beer is absolutely horrible. The aroma is tolerable, but the flavor is biting and harsh making it unpleasant to drink. I'm not one to pour out a beer, but this one might just be destined for the kitchen sink. It's getting slightly better as it warms, but still nowhere near the quality of beer I could have gotten for nine bucks a six pack. Very disappointed to say the least.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jonziefle,3.68,"Appearance: Poured a clear amber, with a hint of brown. Two-finger slightly off-white bubbly/foamy head. Decent retention. Excellent lacing.  Smell: smells of appealing hops balance with a nice malt back. Fruity, citrusy hops, with some pine. The hops are less descript and seem to just darken up the nose a bit, adding some sweetness as well. There is also a slight off smell as well, kind of like rubber or soap?  Taste: The taste is very well balanced. The hops provide a nice flavor, but nothing too intense. Little bit of a bite to start, and they taste dark than they smell. Kind of a generic hop taste, though; no one flavor stands out. The malts are also there to give it a nice body and some sweetness. The off smell also presents itself here as a slight off taste.  Mouthfeel: Thin to medium-bodied. Some bit up front, but noting too notable. Pretty smooth. A little syrupy at times.  Drinkability: A good, but not overally special IPA. Good balanced smell and flavor, but nothing sticks out too much. It does look beautiful though, one of the best. Not a bad one to try. Definitely something I&#8217;ll keep drinking, but there are better choices.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JonMich13,3.58,"A= Nice deep amber color. Very clear. Huge 3 finger white head produced. Decent lacing throughout. Poured this about 50 degrees.  S = Mostly citrus and floral hops.  T = Initial syrupy sweet but quickly the citrus hop bitterness dominates throughout and lingers in the aftertaste. Quite bitter overall.  M = Has a good thick, sticky, oily mouthfeel. I like thick and robust mouthfeel in a beer, so this is my style.  D = The bitterness keeps this down somewhat. But overall not bad.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jdense,4,"one finger white head with substantial lacing over amber/orange body. Floral hop aroma balanced by a bit of biscuit malt. Grapefruit citrus predominates the taste, not a very piny hop flavor, this 'new' hop varietal hits you more on the back end where you can taste the whole cones. Pretty dry mouthfeel, with a bit of alcohol presence.I can see what the fuss is all about. A pretty unique offering in a widely populated category. Recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,robclark19,4.64,"Fantastic. Grapefruit zest and pine resin aroma. It makes me nostalgic for my favorite gin. Thin head and lacing. Orange-whiskey colored. Most IPA's can only claim balance, but this lives up to the promise printed on the bottle. Dry, sour grape mouthfeel compliments the flavor. The flavor has less focus on floral aspects of the hops, but instead is sweet and piney. This is an IPA drinkers IPA. I could drink it all night and not get overwhelmed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,WalrusJockey,3.55,"12oz into Duvel tulip.  A- cloudy, bright orange, with a white head.  S- grapefruit and guava aromas from the hops. Fairly sweet, but no distinct malt aromas.  T- sweet guava followed quickly by very bitter, dry grapefruit. Swallow is more distinctly grapefruity and less bitter, while the aftertaste is the opposite.  M- juicy to dry in the mouth, juicy to dry after the swallow.  D- decent, I suppose. This isn't my favorite category, so I don't enjoy this as much as I'm sure some people do, but I will finish off my half of the 6 pack. Not my favorite hoppy beer that I've had, but not my least favorite, either. I see how this is well done, but it isn't really for me.  EDIT: today I made some nachos out of leftover chicken fajita stuff, along with green salsa, and shredded some cheddar over the top. The Torpedo was a phenomenal accompany to the nachos, each took the other to the next level. Infact, the Torpedo was a much better company to the nachos than the Hop Devil at the restaurant was to the original fajitas.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Roeters,4.33,"Nice dark amber color with a solid 2 fingers of off white foam.  Big hop aroma of grapefruit.  Nice balance of great hop balance for a big IPA, nice hop flavor and finishes with a great bitterness. A little alcohol comes through in the middle.  Dry all the way through.  Very easy to drink with all the parts that I want in an IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,KTCamm,3.74,"Pours dark golden amber, on the copper side with generous foam and lots of lacing.  Smell is strong - the hops jump out and smack you in the face. Earthy, piney with a malt back.  Taste is all hop - from dawn to dusk. They're powerful and dominate the taste. The residual bittering can be a bit much, but not enough to dampen the enthusiasm. The grassy pine comes through, almost bordering on being minty.  Flavorful enough to drink several, though the full on hop assault takes some getting used to. A quality brew, nevertheless.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,seand,3.54,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A: Translucent amber with a finger of off white head. Very nice lacing.  S: The hops are the main thing to come through here.  T: Bitter. Some background sweetness and hop flavor, but the bitterness wins out, and stays around for the aftertaste. The background flavors are nice, but I find I can't really appreciate them because the bitterness is overbearing.  M: The carbonation is really nice, mouthfeel is good overall.  D: The bitterness limits this for me.  I'm a fan of IPAs and DIPAs (Pliny, Ruination), but I'm not a fan of the bitterness of this beer. It just seems like bitterness for the sake of being bitter, instead of as the result of complex hop flavors.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Reanimator,4.3,"A: Poured a bit warmish, received a good finger of milk-froth-like head. It might be the glass, but this is looking DAMN good. Deeper orange color with hints of honey.  S: Seemed fairly straightforward to me - those whole-cone Magnum hops.  T: Reminds me of Surly Furious in a way. Strong on the grapefruity hops, but a very nice peppery alcohol as well which reminds me, oddly enough, of a good Polish vodka. While complex and tasty on the hop front, the malt character is a bit subdued, only a twinge can be felt between bursts of hoptitude.  M: Mouthfeel certainly feels fuller than Furious, the finish is far more satisfying.  D: Whew, it's nice to see this being added to SN's full-availability schedule. I'll certainly be picking it up in the future. Could be a bit intense for daily drinking, however, which makes it a much more welcome permanent addition to the rotation! Man, even my burps are tasty.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Gambrinus1184,4.42,"Poured from a stubby 12-ounce bottle into a Willibrew pint glass.  A: Pours a light, golden copper color with a big, fluffy two-finger head of off-white foam which holds like whipped cream. A chilled haze and light sediment are seen among the steady carbonation bubbles. Great clarity and fine lacing.  S: Smells like a light, spicy caramel wort with fresh, green hop leaves added to it. A light floral, grassy pine smell is very clean and clear.  T: A very nice, fresh hop oil flavor and bitterness attacks the palate at first. A very clean, toasted biscuit flavor rolls about mid-palate. A little spicy citrus fruitiness is detected before washing away ultra-clean with a satisfying herbal hop bitterness. Slight alcohol flavor, but otherwise nicely balanced with moderate hopping.  M: Mouthfeel is a little sticky and bitter, but there is an overall creaminess and smoothness to this brew that makes it very easy to drink.  D: A nice spiciness and definitive hop profile make this a very tasty, clean and fairly well-balanced IPA. The 7.2% ABV is appropriate in the taste, though the flavor is undisturbed. I could probably have a few of these before I found myself not-so-mysteriously intoxicated.  Another successful IPA from the hitmakers at Sierra Nevada. I'd like to see more of a sweet malty flavor to balance some of the hops, but that's not what Torpedo is about, I don't think. Enjoy the constant hop flavor and aroma of a Torpedo today!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,tastybeer,3.63,"Beer is fairly clear, woody amber in color. The orange-white head yields very nice sheety lace once it fades. Smell contains grapefruit, orange, leaves, wood, melon, musky floral scents, and lightly caramelized toasty grain. Taste is prickly with brisk bitter hops + fine carbonation. Flavors of buttered bread, caramel, pine, grapefruit, and lemon rind. Texture is resiny, slick, and fluid. Quite easy to drink even with the hoppy bitter punch.  I would like more juicy mouth-watering aroma + flavor hops, but that aside, this is a solid IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,woemad,4.23,"12oz bottle purchased at Huckleberry's in Spokane for $1.29. No obvious freshness date, though there's an odd sequence of numbers and characters above the upc label. The label seems almost generic, with virtually the same colors as their regular IPA that was released a couple of years ago. Why not have a destroyer circa 1942 launching a bottle-shaped torpedo at a Japanese battlewagon? Or perhaps Admiral Farragut or Tom Petty paraphrasing themselves by shoouting ""Drink the torpedoes,""? Instead there's a picture of a hop field. That's okay, the beer does indeed have hops in it, but it could conceivably work on virtually EVERY beer that's being brewed. Just looking for something to set this one apart visually. Tried this on-tap in the past, but never before from the bottle.  Poured a slightly hazy, burnt orange kind of color. Big, off-white, creamy-looking head. Lots of lace.  Right off the bat there's a big, piney and citrusy hop presence in the nose. As it warms up a caramel maltiness becomes evident as well, though it's well dominated by the hops.  Tastes similar to the smell, though the hops seem to increase in complexity, giving off an herbal flavor in addition to the citrus and pine tastes already encountered through the nose. Malts are present to provide balance and lend a subtle sweetness to the proceedings, but they are emphatically not the stars of this show. Ends with a crisp zap to the palate.  Sticky mouthfeel that's oily with hop resin. Medium bodied.  Very drinkable on what feels like the first true day of spring, with sunny skies and the temperature above 70 degrees. This was an excellent post-work, pre-cooking dinner beer. Not a session beer, but I'd be happy to quaff this one again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DefenCorps,4.18,"Grabbed a sixer at State Line the other day. Figured it's time to review it, as it's my last bottle.  A: In my Russian River tulip, Torpedo sits in all it's amber glory, proudly displaying a chapeau, off-white in color with tremendous lacing. Excellent.  S: Plenty of juicy pine and bitter orange peel right off the bat. Mild malt sweetness behind it all. Juicy orange hides in the back. Solid stuff  T: Opens up rather massively bitter, with a complex pine and citrus assault, with the pine surprisingly intense! Grapefruit and orange zest are prominent as well. The malt is over-ridden by the hops, just the way I like it. There's still some mild caramel and fruit sweetness, though. Finishes dry and resiny  M: What a mouthfeel! Intensely resiny in hop character with an excellent bitterness and carbonation, this beer's a winner.  D: I would drink a lot more of this, at the price, it'll be a staple in my rotation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,gford217,4.13,"Pours of the bottle as a deep, clear amber with a thick off-white head that sticks to the side of the glass as stays on as a big cap as the carbonation streams up from the bottom.  The aroma is mainly light citrus with lemons and oranges but with plenty of grassy whiffs as well.  The taste follows the aroma but probably has a bit deeper citrus bitterness than the aroma with more grapefruit than anything else. There is plenty of malt to balance things out.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit dry with lots of bitterness in the finish. As mentioned before, lots of carbonation and the bubbles are active throughout.  This is a really nice balanced IPA that's certainly not a hop bomb but brings it's share of citrus bitterness to the table with lots of malts as well. Overall, very tasty.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,joepais,3.88,"Bottle poured into a Sam Adams glass produced a finder worth of white head that stuck around. The body of the brew was a clear amber color with tons of little bubble rising from the bottom of the glass.  Aromas of fresh hops are dominate on this one and quite pleasant the flavor is hop forward as well but with some malt sweetness to keep the bitters in check. The brew is crisp and light in my mouth with ample carbonation.  This is a solid IPA nothing outstanding but a good one I tend to like my local ones a tad better due to the freshness factor. I still would not turn this down if it was on sale, or handed to me",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,cooncat,3.93,"Serving from the bottle at fridge temps, into a standard pint glass.  On the pour you get a nice dark orange colored brew, almost the color of pumpkin; maybe a bit darker. The head is about a finger (probably bigger at lower temps), and is creamy in nature, and off white in color, perhaps tawny. Good lacing shows all around the glass. Pretty!  Nose is hoppy, but not 'in your face' hoppy. You can definitely tell you've got an IPA in your glass, with little of malt coming through.  The taste is solidly IPA. Hops are lightly citrus, with a hint of grapefruit, some pine and floral notes as well. It's not quite as ""hop forward"" as Celebration Ale (another SN fave), but it is very solid. Mouthfeel is medium and well rounded. Carbonation is spot-on for the style and very refreshing. Of course, that makes this nicely drinkable, but at 7.2%, you probably wouldn't want to be pounding these down one after another. Still, very enjoyable and drinkable.  As an unabashed 'hop head', I can always appreciate a good IPA. Sierra Nevada has a very good year round offering with Torpedo. Get you a six, and ""fire away""!  Na Zdravje!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,raoulduke37,4.47,"Pours a dark orange-brown with a frothy head that quickly dissipates, but leaves amazing sticky lacing all over the glass.  Smells of the usual for an IPA - pine, plenty of hops, citrus zest, some grass, but this one goes to the next level by providing a fantastic backdrop of caramel malts.  Extremely refreshing taste - hoppy, but not bitter, like I remember SN beers being. Lemony, great malts, faint traces of honey, and some banana. Very delicious.  Mouthfeel is very mild. No carbonation attack or bitterness battle. Exceptionally smooth. mmmm.  I have five more of these to go, and I'm sure there will only be a few left before I'm satisfied. Well done. I will no longer avoid SN as I did in my youth. All those wasted years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Sweet bitter hop aroma. Some pine but not off-putting. Softish mouthfeel. Good piney dry taste. Some grapefruit. Makes me want another, drying. Somewhat sweet, bitter aftertaste. Very tasty. Very balanced taste, just enough hoppiness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,dogger6253,4,"Nice, thick head. White in color, very pillowy. The head takes minutes to fall, clinging strongly against the side of the glass. The body is a dark amber color, fairly translucent, with bubbles racing toward the surface.  There is a very faint but rich floral scent to this with hints of something sweeter to come. Up front, the flavor is that of floral hops. The taste shifts into a rich, malty flavor with some peppery bite to it; then back into hops to wipe the palette for the next sip.  It's not really all that thick. Seemed thick to me at first, but I don't really know why. This beer actually feels fairly thin and carbonated. Maybe my brain was making me expect something different, but this is nice. It's a great outdoor beer. I wish I were at a bonfire right now, rather than at my computer... This beer screams for summer nights. The high alcohol content really makes this a hard one to classify. As great as the flavor is for massive drinking, I'd steer clear of having multiples in a session.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Gish,4.42,"A - Pours a standard pale ale copper, has a frothy head with good retention  S - Piney hops with a touch of citrus  T - The piney hops definitely make this a bitter beer. However, I personally enjoyed the spicy hops in Torpedo much more than other IPAs that ooze citrus. It seems to be countered with malts fairly well, leaving it maybe just a touch unbalanced. Extremely tasty IPA!  M - moderate carbonation, smoother and more pleasant to drink than many IPAs  D - A hoppy IPA that's still extremely drinkable? You bet.  The best beer I've ever had from Sierra Nevada. It definitely gives my previous favorite IPA, Smuttynose, a run for its money due to better drinkability.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,PerzentRizen,4.48,"I recieved a six pack of Torpedo from Pudge43 in a trade - thank you much my friend!  I have enjoyed Sierra Nevada beers for years now and I was so excited to hear about a new IPA. Due to our current beer laws I wasn't able to get ahold of a six pack through the normal channels so I traded for it.  Poured into a Duvel tulip this IPA has a russet amber color with amazing clarity, a white head, and a fine lacing throughout the session. Amazing look!  The aroma is of fresh malt, juicy hop oils, orange rind, pineapple, and pears. The aroma is light in the nose compared to some IPA's.  The taste is explosive. Up front is a huge malt backbone with an amazing bouquet of floral hop resins. A huge burst of apple, pine, pepper, tannins, wheat-like flavors, and a tart medicinal sharpness capture my Torpedo experience - amazing flavor!  The mouthfeel is not unlike many great IPA's. This has a definate west coast lightness in the mouth - nothing surupy going on here. The massive malt backbone makes this a well balanced beer.  This might be the most drinkable IPA ever created - with PTE being the only exception I've encountered. I would love to do a side-by-side comparison of the two. I think Torpedo would match up nicely.  This is now my favorite Sierra Nevada brew - I think they're doing great things there in Chico and I always look forward to trying more of their great beers. Great Job the Torpedo Extra IPA!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: Nice malt backbone up first, with tangy hops popping up right after. Finish is pretty dang bitter with a bold hit of piney hops.

Nothing would beat sitting on the deck after a ""hard"" day of riding and having one of these well-balanced, gorgeous and delicious beers in your hand. The alcohol (7% +) is just enough to relax the muscles and erase any self-consciousness about your wack hair and that frozen booger on your upper lip.  Aroma: Huge citrus notes, a more subdued pine aroma, hints of lemon? That first whiff really is amazing with all the complex citrus notes dancing around.  Appearance: Large off-white creamy head. Good lacing but not great. Beautiful orange color with red notes. Slight haze.  Taste: The bottle claims the perfect balance between malt and hops. Maybe. If not, it's close. Delicious maltiness collides with a strong hop presence in seamless harmony. Hops don't overwhelm and the bitterness at the end definitely knows when it has overstayed its welcome. The alcohol is hidden really well.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, carbonation is mild to medium and doesn't get in the way of the flavors.

Plenty of lacing, practically an unbroken sheet coating the whole glass. The orange color had a nice clarity to it, and little trails could be seen on the sides, just below the surface.  A fresh floral aroma, grassy hop notes. Earthy and herbal, but not overpowering. Firm dry bitterness in the back, pine and floral notes up front, grapefruit rind, plenty of caramel malt in the middle. Soft creamy feel, with lasting residual bitterness.

140,30420,Gigantis,3.23,"Bought a sixer of this the other day. Poured into a tulip glass, which turned out to be sort of an unnecessary treatment for this particular beer since I was expecting something, I don't know, bolder.  It looks great. Pale ruby hues and a nice white head that is on the right side of frothy. It smelled nice too. Floral pine hits you right away and hints at citrus as you take it in. Couldn't wait to drink this.  The taste is... okay. I mean, I don't know what I was expecting - but I didn't get much of anything. For one, there wasn't any fruitiness to this. There was good hop balance... no aftertaste. This is a dry IPA. It is, I think, the most bland ""Extra/Double/Imperial"" IPA I have had to date. This may very well be the taste they were going for and I cannot say that I didn't enjoy it a little bit. But I wanted more flavor. Even the piney bitterness feels toned down. Also, this brew felt pretty carbonated, just a tad too much. It sort of reminded me of drinking tonic water, for this reason.  But I drank 3 of them without any sort of difficulty. Each one was the same as the next. I can say this for the Torpedo: I may not have loved it, but I didn't get sick of it either.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Trappissed,3.43,"A little too bitter for my tastes in the realm of IPAs, but still above average. Didn't seem very complex at all, just straightforward, bitter style IPA. I don't think I would revisit this one, after being a little disappointed with all the hype surrounding this beer. Leans more to the pine side of hops and I really didn't detect too much sweetness as others have mentioned. I happen to like the more citrus-flavored IPAs, but I won't hold that against this beer.

140,30420,mafiasentinel21,4.32,"A: Copper golden hue. Foam that sticks around for a bit and trails down the glass very nicely.  S: I Set this beer down for a sec before trying it to hold a brief conversation, caught herbal piney notes from about 3 feet out. Hophead stimuli on the increase.  T: Pine right up front. Hop oils demand the palate's attention as does a bready undertone. Piney hoppiness lingers. Absolutely delicious. I like to savor this one  M: Smooth. Medium. On the carbonated side and it works.  D: I could have 2-3 to start but would like to move into something lighter after that. Not a ""session brew,"" to me anyhow.  A good beer from SN.

Long finish develops into some interesting citrusy sweetness on the tongue and cheeks.  M: Light to medium bodied. Decent carbonation.  D: Very easy drinker.

Some fair lacing is left behind. Nose was weaker than I was expecting and bit grassier than I prefer. Their new process could benefit from a bit of tweaking in the nose department. Taste is good but nothing different, exceptional or noteworthy, but a good tasting IPA. I'm not sure about the ""Extra"" or what that implies, but it's not in the nose or taste departments.

S- Pine needles and sap dominate the nose. There's a touch of tropical fruit or melon also. As far as malt there's a hint of roastiness, and some subdued sweetness. Also a good bit of alcohol.  T- Hops forward, that's for sure. The hops are piney, pithy, and bitter- really bitter.  M- Creamy, and also some astringency- almost like an ashy feel to it. Good though. The creaminess is really good.  D- Definitely going to get some more of this.

Nice smattered sheets of lace all the way down.  I got a clean whiff of this baby from 2 feet away once the cap was popped. Upon being poured into my large mouthed stemmed chalice, the aroma of cascade hops was unavoidable. Grapefruit and pine, the angelic elements of a whole-cone highly hopped beer. A teasing amount of succulent sweet malt rides the edges while the hops caress and flirt for what is soon to come...  ...Ahh. The hop bonanza that was just smelled translates two-fold into the realm of taste. A fantastic rendition of extra dry and juicy hops simultaneously greets the pallet with grace and poise. The hop flavors are compressed and do not blow-up your mouth. A restrained ushering of finely crafted bitter, fruity and tangy hops fill the mouth and do not dissipate until after a long while. The malt profile seems to be a bit elevated from what I perceived in the smell, but in a way that doesn't take away for the hops whatsoever.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with an unbelievable extra-extra fine carbonation that just blows me away. Dry and flavorful (long) finish. No chalky leftovers from the hops too.  Drinkability is spectacular. I will be buying more of this in the fall when it comes out again!  I was utterly surprised by this beer. It almost reminds me of Ruination, but with more poise and polish. It's a perfect marriage of an English IPA and a high-octane West coast IPA.

Settles slowly, foam clings to the sides of the glass as it does. Eventually dissipates to the point of leaving a nice blanket layer of carbonation on the surface of your brew. Thick, sticky, substantial lacing stays behind, and becomes a permanent beer artifact.  S: Sweet syrupy malt, strong hoppy goodness, honey and a bit of pine.  T: Well, hops are the story here. Mean, angry hops and pine nuts. A bit of lemon citrus sneaks in as well.  M: Sharp but light bodied. Hops assault the palette, and linger throughout the quaff. Dry finish.  D: This is a sipper. Solid flavor, but hops are the order of the day.  Very good atmosphere. Appearance is impressive, and although basic, the nose is full. Same with the flavor. Not much to say, simple but fulfills it's purpose. Feel is harsh and dry, but what do you expect from a 7.2% alcohol IPA. Does have good drinkability for a beer of this type.

Lacing is spotty, but very sticky.  Big nose of citrus fruits. Large grapefruit presence. Very light touch of caramel malts. Slight grass notes.  Citrus hops explosion. Not nearly the amount of hops bitterness that was expected. There is some bitterness here, it just more mellow than anticipated. Notes of yellow grapefruit. Slight presence of malty sweetness, but it's way down deep.  Good medium body. It's smooth and a slight touch to the creamy side. I was expecting it to be more crisp and sharp. The carbonation is very well blended, in this one. You almost don't notice it.  This is a very solidly drinkable brew. It's too hoppy for me, personally, but I see why people like it.

140,30420,connecticutpoet,4,"On the pour, this beer had a one finger, foamy head atop a clear, deep yellow body. The head lasted a while, and left a good amount of lacing.  Aroma was of citrus hops, a little grassy, with hints of cinnamon (which surprised me). Nice pale malts were in the background, and played a supporting role, but the hops were the star.  Taste was initially quite bitter, with more pine than citrus flavors. Hop resins came out next, and it became slightly astringent. This beer was not sweet, and the malts were masked by the hops. Being a hophead, I did not mind.  Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy, but with a little bit of a pucker.  Good marks for drinkability. Although it was not quite what I expected, I liked it quite a bit. I don't think it would make a good session beer, with the higher ABV, but I would be able to have two or three at a party and have a wonderful time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Poured into a Pint Glass. A nice three inch head forms on top of the beer. Awesome looking brew. I love IPAs but I find this one a bit different in the taste. I guess this is what's called a West Coast IPA. I've had IPAs from Bells (Two-Hearted) and Short's (Huma Lupa Licious) and would prefer them to this one. I can't put my finger on the taste, but it is different but in a good way. Maybe a bit over hyped, but it's still a very good beer. I might chill the other one a bit longer before enjoying it.

Fresh, hoppy smell to accompany a similar taste. This beer definitely has a little extra kick compared to your average American IPA, but in a world of increasingly hoppy, increasingly alcoholic beers of this style, Sierra Nevada does a nice job of finding some balance in this quality brew.

Looks beautiful in front of a light.  Smell - Like SNPA. Very similar. Not impressive but distinct. I believe I could tell this was a Sierra Nevada brew just by smell alone.  Taste - Hops present but lightly balanced by the citrusy flavors. Its taste and drinkable seems to improve after first few drinks.  Mouthfeel - Bitter carbonation at first, to smooth IPA goodness about halfway in. It has a tendency to cling to your tongue after ingestion.  Drinkability - This could prove well as a session beer. Weighing in at a 7.2% could catch up quick. It seems to go down quick enough to drink more than intended.  OVERALL - A very decent brew. With its cheap price and drink ability it could go far in a night.

Some slow carb and some lacing. Had a good sized off-white head that slowly settled into a thin foam and thick collar.  The aroma was outstanding. Heavy on the floral and citric hops. Nice hop smack that arouses the senses. The taste was also excellent. Starts off with good amount of hops and then builds to nice bitter hop finish. Aftertaste lingers for a bit and then mostly resets for next drink. By then end you do start to get some tongue shredding but not too bad. Mouthfeel was hurt a little by some over carbonation.  Overall, an excellent beer that I highly recommend. Worthy of the hype. Since it's so strong it's would work best as the only beer of the night or as an ender.

Nice film of foam on top covering the entire brew. Lacing.  S- Fresh piney hops. Very herbal and earthy. Did not get that citrus kick I was expecting from the nose. Medicinal at times but grassy and aggressively hoppy.  T- Hmm...I was expecting some more bitter notes from the hops. Got more citrus in the flavor rather than the nose. More hops than your average IPA but I still feel as though they could have kicked it up a notch. Still, a solid tasty brew.  M- Eh, pretty good. Wished it were more creamy. Tingly and carbonated, average mouthfeel.  D- Easy drinking IPA that is more aggressively hopped than your average IPA.

Not quite as intense as I was expecting with the taste. Very nice amount of hoppyness the citrus is more present here with the pine taking a bit of a back seat. Herbal flavors are also present.

Pours a pretty deep copper color with a rocky head that sticks around for the life of the beer. Smells hoppy for sure. Definitely some cannabis-like overtones in there. Not much of malty sweet smell, but the hops are about as potent as you could expect. The taste, while hoppy, actually has a lot of hops flavors I don't really care for. Along with the pine, grapefruit, and floral flavors, there's a deep bitter earthiness that keeps popping up. It's distracting, and I'm not really a fan of it. There's a malt base that creeps out with each sip, but there's so little sweetness in this beer, balance clearly wasn't what they were shooting for. Texture is nice and this is pretty good for a single serving, but one bottle's enough. The idea behind this is nice, but there are hop flavors in there I don't really want. The pure bitter hops are also a little boring after about 1/2 glass. A DIPA malt base or some different (fruitier) hops would've worked better for me. I definitely prefer Celebration as far as SN IPA's go. Reminds me of the attempt at an English IPA from a few years ago. Just make Celebration a normal offering instead of these other IPA variations.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Great, great aroma... at first. The hop aroma here seems to fade as it goes on and is replaced by a skunky herbal/faint urine smell. It's faint, but definitely there (and not just skunked beer--different). It's been in all of them I've had to date. Maybe it's the herbal hops, but that part does not do it for me. EDIT: Having this again proves to me that this is among the best value beers around. Nice fruity, hoppy aroma here.  T- Big punch of bittering hops and piney notes at first. Slight hint of alcohol, but very slight. Just a taste of orange zest and a bit of malty sweetness (just a bit) for balance. As far as IPAs go, this is pretty good. To me it fits right in between IPA and DIPA (hence ""extra"" IPA).  M- Smooth, medium bodied, creamy (while still being crisp, I know). Good stuff.  D- I can't stomach more than a few of these--I like a lot of hops, but I can't put down a ton of these in a night. Definitely a good sipper, IMO.  Another strong one from SN.

Strong hoppy bitterness. Not as floral as the aroma would suggest. The malt briefly appears at the very beginning of the taste, but it seems more suited as the delivery engine of the hop bomb. Solid body with appropriate carbonation. A solid IPA",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,fostwal,4,"The first thing that you notice about this beer is the intense hop flavor. The sharp, bitter, hop flavor makes this definitely not the beer to down. You are forced to take your time and enjoy the beer. Savor the flavors. Smell the hop scent. And admire the dark golden color. This is a really good beer for those that like, no LOVE, hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,dotsonjamesg,4.1,"Finally found this brew at Springhill Liquor in North Little Rock, AR. I bought it in a six pack for $9 plus tax. Not bad, if it turns out to be as good as I have heard. My palate has grown weary of all the sweet beers I find here. I'm sick of Belgian Ales, Dubbels, Trippels, Quads, and Bocks. I want something hoppy and dry for a change and I really hope this brew delivers.  Appearance: Pours a rich, slightly foggy, copper body with a two-finger ivory head with nice lacing and retention.  Smell: The nose is fruity with scents loaded with pine, hops, pineapple, and malted barley. I didn't really get a whole lot of citrus with this one.  Taste: This brew takes me back to the days I spent sitting in the Stone Brewery's Beer Gardens, enjoying a nice Arrogant Bastard Ale. Torpedo has a sweet bite that moves in to a rich pine taste. The pine subsides and moves in to a harsh nutty bitterness that I have missed so much.  Mouthfeel: The brew is fairly heavy but not as chewy as others of its caliber.  Drinkability: If you love IPAs and ASAs, then its right up your alley. I have no problem knocking back a six pack in an hour, though I am sure many people would say that it's too heavy. If you like hoppy beers, its great!  It's California in a bottle.  Cheers!  -James",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CAP1868,4.4,"Poured from the typical Sierra Nevada styled bottle into a pint glass. The funny thing about this one is that it was my girlfriends choice...and what a great one.  A-Dark amber red, I couldn't see through the brew in my pint glass, had a decent head that remained with decent lacing. I knew these to be a very good sign of things to come.  S-Smelled very much of pine and citrus which it states on the bottle itself.  T-Wow I loved it...Torpedo is a great name for this beer because its hops all the way up front, but has a very complex malty finish that is simply amazing. This beer is almost perfectly balanced. The pine and citrus were also prevalent throughout the entire tasting.  M-Medium bodied, sticky type feeling  D-At 7.2%ABV you'd think it'd be a tough session beer but it's not so be careful.  GREAT brew and if you can find it, give it a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

This one is like SNPA on roids. A lot bigger and thicker. Nice caramel malt flavor and and hoppy bitterness to finish it up.  This is easily drinkable for 7.2% and might very well be one of my new go to beers. (if i can find it). This one has quality written all over it.

T: Good bitterness right up front but the pine dominates over the citrus in flavor. Very malty as well. Honestly, not a properly balanced AIPA.  M: A touch thick for an AIPA but I think it's the abundance of malt.  D: Not too bad, but I'll take a SNPA over this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BeerisfoodLLC,4.42,This beer pours with a nice rich opaque amber color and a thick head. Decent retention. Strong citrus scents permeate from the glass along with some mild floral hints. Strong hoppy taste in the initial sip. Balances out nicely with the malts for a very drinkable tasty beer. If you like an IPA heavy on the hops this will be a nice treat. Not necessarily my favorite Sierra Nevada beer but pretty darn good!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JMH_,4.07,"Pours a crisp light amber colour with a mid-sized to big frothy, creamy head. Lots of residue is left on the glass ocne the head subsides.  The aroma is primarily of big, juicy hop notes with some floral notes as well. There are hints of caramel here and a bit of pine too. Very Sierra-like: simple, but on point and effective.  The flavour sort of echoes the aroma for the most part, with juicy, floral hop notes, and a bit more pine than noted in the aroma. There's a bit of a breakfast cereal flavour here as well. Very bready too. There's a nice bitter finish at the end of each sip. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and is a bit oily/slick with a nice bite to it.  This one reminded me of the Troegs HopBack Amber a bit, but as an IPA vs an amber. Good stuff. Very simple but very tasty. Easy to recommend and glad that it's a year round offering as I'll pick it up often.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Patrick999,3.91,"Finally reviewing the controversial Torpedo.  A - As with most Sierra Nevada beers, Torpedo raises a formidable wall of foam, and leaves copious lace as it slowly recedes. A pale ""dark gold,"" this looks a lot like Celebration.  S - Hops, mostly of the grapefruit persuasion, but some piney expression as well. For all the hops in here, I was actually expecting a greener, more pungent nose. Seems a little weak.  T - Not surprisingly, a strong hop bite a la Celebration, minus some of the Pine-Sol character. As in SN's famous pale ale, the Chico yeast throws off some fruity esters. Has a fresh, grainy malt underpinning.  F - Not quite as harsh and soapy as the SN Harvest ales, which I appreciate. Has a slightly more thin feel.  D - Easy to drink, good beer, it's just that it doesn't bring anything new to the table. It tastes substantially like any number of Sierra Nevada hoppy beers. While I enjoy this beer, it would seem that this venerable craft brewery has become something of a one-trick pony. They do what they do very well, and the price of this is quite nice, which will undoubtedly bolster its popularity, and deservedly so - yet all the harvest beers, Celebration, Anniversary, SNPA, and now Torpedo - they are starting to seem a bit same-y. I'll drink the hell out of it when I'm in a mood for hops, but I'd really like to see Sierra Nevada bust out and do something from leftfield. Just a thought.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,sarahspat,4.25,"Pouring this 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass resulted in an inch and a half to two inches of light orange sherbet colored head. It leaves no shortage of lacing behind. Cloudy dark gold.  Nose is deep citrus, candied pineapple, pine sap and herbal.  Wow! This is a tasty IPA. Flavor is strongly piney at first, which then gives way to grapefruit and candied pineapple, then some nice crisp floral notes. Bitterness is definitely a force here, but it doesn't overwhelm the palate, and allows you to enjoy the richness of hop flavors. The pineyness lingers for a very long time. The hops overpower the malt almost completely. Just a bit of caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, but very smooth; has moderate carbonation.  This is a classy IPA and unbelievable for the price. Thank you, Sierra Nevada. The great thing about this beer is that it gives you so many different hops flavors to enjoy. Now I see what they mean by the ""extra"" IPA. I mean, this would be a great IPA even with a few fewer flavors.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,FtownThrowDown,3.78,"Pours a transparent amber in color with a nice inch of pillowy head on top. Smell is some hops, but there's also a subtle spicy flavor as well. Taste is more hops. Somewhat piney and citrusy. Very smooth with the perfect amount of bitterness. For a year around sixer this is going to be a very tempting offering. Highly sessionable. I could easily put down a sixer of this in one sitting without even thinking about it. Well done Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Gilgemesh,4.21,"Poured strong down the center in my new Duvel Green Tulip. Thanks Mel. A nice pillowy off-white head that faded to about 1/2 inch and stayed. Lovely lacing and clarity, but what else do you expect from SN. The nose is not as strong as I would expect with an IPA, but I get notes of pine and citrus mixed with a bit of crystally malt. Good carbonation leads into a lite malt moment before the hops slam you. This beer is named Torpedo for a reason. The crisp bitterness doesn't sneak up, it announces itself with a ping and swoops in on you. This is a clean crisp brew with a nice bitter finish. Strong all the way through. I'd like to see a bit more in the nose, but that is being a bit picky. I'm glad I have a case.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S- Smells great, a bit of pine and a lot of citrus, smells like a good mixture of hops, also has sweetness from the malt in there as well. hmmm  T- Man this is good, I thought the hops would be very upfront since it is an extra IPA but they were very subtle, the flavor extends past the first sip and the pine hops really come through. Man this beer keeps going after each sip it is great. The malt adds a great richness as well.  M- medium-to heavy bodied, with a little alcohol but not much.  D- Over all a great beer, probably my new replacement for SN pale ale, plus it is a freaking steal at a regular 6 pack price (i got mine for 7.99",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smell- Smells like an extra IPA. Alot of wonderfull hops. Similar to Hopslam. Piny and, do I detect a hint of pineapple?? Maybe a light honey presence. Sweet and sharp with loads of hops.  Taste- Powerfull! And yummy! More bitter than the Hopslam, amazing flavor! Definitly a strong IPA. Perfect alchohol and great carbonation.  Drinkability- I could probably drink three of these before losing my taste buds!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Seanibus,4.22,"The sharp sting of the hops shot out as I opened the bottle - I could smell it three feet away. The aroma is biting and piny, with waves of bitter citrus. The beer pours an orange-copper with a slight head and decent lace. The flavor is sharp and bitter and piny, with a bitter, sour grapefruit character. Hops dominate - the malt is hard to pick out behind the blast of hops, though as it warms, there is a pleasant toasty, slightly biscuity taste that peeks out from behind the hopping. The mouthfeel is surprisingly thin.  This is a delicious beer. Not, perhaps, the best West Coast style IPA around, but an excellent addition to the Sierra Nevada lineup and a worthy modern cousin to the venerable Pale Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Hop flavor is mostly pine, with a sampling of grapefruit and resin. Balanced, no. Delicious, yes.  M: Solidly middle of the road in body, it lingers a bit on the teeth and tongue. Carbonation is mild, but present.  D: I would love to drink several, but I can definitely see this one wiping out my palate halfway through the second bottle.

I liked this year's Celebration a bit better, but this is an excellent year-round offering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JAA,4.06,"Roughly $8(per sixer) at Total Wine in Sarasota. I'm always up for some Sierra Nevada. I, like many, owe much of my interest in craft beer to this fine brewery.  Looks like celebration, tastes like the failed aspirations of John McCain. So satisfying. A bit less balanced than their other pale ales, but flavorful none the less. A healthy amount of hop bite leads to a little more bitterness than SN's other IPA offerings.  Overall, easy to drink and worth the price. Too bad it's so hard to find.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,youngblood,4.15,"From all of the hype of this beer, I was expecting something absurdly hopped. but was pleasantly surprised with this well balanced ipa. The beer pours to a golden amber, shimmering ever so slightly in the light. The head on this beer billows strongly but still manages to invite my nose forward. Balance, balance, balance is what comes to my mind when sniffing the beauty. Of course there is some lovely pine popping me right in the sinuses, but the rushing behind it is that lovely slightly roasted malt to sweeten it all up. Taste follows the nose closely, wonderfully bitter/piney flavor up front followed by a slight caramel from the malt. Leaves you with fresh pine breath (but not like pinesol). This feels a bit carbonated on my tongue, not unpleasant, but not the best thing to ever touch my tongue either. The ABV is hidden quite well on this. I could and will drink this often. Thank God for year round IPA's.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BuckeyeNation,4.08,"""Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!""  --Admiral David G. Farragut (and Tom Petty)  Radiant pumpkin with bumblebee yellow borders. The liquid looks good and the crown looks great. The foam is a beautiful shade of pastel orange-tinted pearl and has a rich, milkshake creamy texture. There's a ton of gorgeous lace as well.  The aroma is solid without being special. Keeping in mind that IPA noses are all about the hops, this brew uses an rather unconventional combination of Magnum, Crystal and Citra (a new variety). It's a little citrusy and is also herbal and faintly funky. In the end, I much prefer the Chinook, Cascade and Centennial excellence of Celebration Ale. Having said that, I understand Sierra Nevada's need to change things up a bit.  Torpedo Extra IPA is wonderful beer that manages to distinguish itself from the rest of the brewery's lineup. Compared to Celebration, Torpedo is less caramel malty, less hoppy, less deliciously hoppy (personal opinion) and slightly stronger with respect to ABV. Although I'm not blown away, quality IPAs aren't easy to come by in this state, so we'll take what we can get.  The malt tastes modestly toasted and borderline caramel-like. Again, hop flavor doesn't stand out because none of those three hops are among my favorites. A little grapefruit zest (from Citra, presumably) helps. Pine makes a brief appearance, as does an herbaceousness that I can take or leave.  The mouthfeel is pure Sierra Nevada, which the same as saying pure quality. It's at least medium for the style and is full of rounded edges. I like a little rawness in some IPAs, but this one has either too much malt or not enough hops to get there. Perfect carbonation... as always.  I'm amazed that Torpedo Extra IPA is the first year-round IPA in the long, storied history of Sierra Nevada Brewing. I would have much preferred year-round Celebration Ale, but then anxiously anticipating that iconic brew and then tasting it change over the next few months is half the fun. Bottom line: this is a solid addition to SN's lineup that I'll come back too now and again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TheBCrew,4.5,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Very clear amber color with 2 fingers of thick, creamy, off-white head. Head fades slowly and leaves ring of sticky lacing on the glass with each sip. Aroma is fairly subtle (though I am getting over a cold). Hints of pine and citrus hops. I was shocked at how balanced this beer is. I was expecting an in-your-face hop bomb but was pleasantly surprised with a bready, slightly malty flavor up front followed by hints of apricot and grapefruit and a slightly dry finish. Minimal lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is fantastically creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Highly drinkable, the 7.2% ABV is very well hidden.

Recedes down to a quarter inch tall quickly but then sticks there for a while. Decent lacing.  S--Pretty much all hops..mostly citrus on the nose with a grassy backbone. Would be near-perfect if it was a little stronger  T--Much like the smell, this one is all hops. Very grassy taste that is bitter on the tip of the tongue and roof of the mouth.  M--Medium bodied and very oily. Glides down the throat like silk.

Has the perfect level of sweetness mid sip and a nice grapefruit bitterness on the back. Pick up some orange on the back of the palate between sips. Hops are there but do not overpower.  M-Medium bodied, very creamy, with a nice resiny feel. Comfortable level of carbonation.  D-7.2% is well hidden and it goes down easy.  A great beer from SN.

140,30420,thirdeye11,3.73,"Presentation: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Duvel tulip glass.  A: This beer pours a beautiful deep golden color with a nice 2 finger head. Lacing is good as well.  S: Really nice piney and citrus notes going on here. Lots of hops, but not overpowering in my nose which is a good thing.  T: I don't drink IPAs but wanted to try this because SNPA is a staple for me and introduced me to what I consider ""real hops"". This beer tastes mostly of pine notes, and almost no bitterness. I am extremely impressed as I move towards more hoppy brews. This one is great, and I will drink it again, but the hops are pretty powerful overall and dominate the flavor profile.  M: I don't think anyone does mouthfeel better than Sierra Nevada, and this beer remains true to that. Creamy, perfectly carbonated, and slightly oily. All desirable characteristics. Perfection!  D: I could probably only have one of these at a sitting, but with the right food perhaps 2. I loved it but would only want 1 at a time in most instances.  Overall this is the best IPA I've had. Since IPA is not a favorite of mine (yet) I think my review will likely improve in score over time. If you like hoppy beers, this is a MUST try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,PhillyStyle,4.33,"The beer poured a clear, deep, dark orange, it was almost red. It poured a huge white head that was very dense and was retained very well. Lacing was slightly better than average. Small carbonation bubbles could be seen streaming to the top.  The beer was pretty much all hops with maybe a hint of pine and citrus, but they were in the background. Not much else, but really well done.  The flavor of the beer was really good. Nice and hoppy with a nice bitter bite to it and bitter aftertaste. Again, the hints of pine and citrus were noticeable but muted and in the background. Well rounded and nicely done.  The beer had a medium body to it; it was smooth, creamy and rich with good carbonation. The beer was extremely easy to drink. This is a very good IPA and a very good beer, for any style. Very good beer and one that I would recommend to anyone.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,cdrummer,4.12,"A: Luscious hazy off-orange color with a sticky foam head. There is generous amount of lacing.  S: Obviously hops and floral hugeness followed up by a waft of buscuity goodness, fruit esters and funky yeast.  T&M: Sticky and syrupy, this beer is packed with a mack truck full of hops that unloads itself onto the palette with flavors of pine, citrus, hops spice, and a definite, strong backbone of biscuit malt. Carbonation is crisp and lively throughout and tapers only at the finish which clings to the back of my tongue with warming alcohol and a pleasant, sticky bitterness.  D: Overall I would say that this drinks very well even with all the redonkulous hops. While it's not as complex as say a 90 minute from Dogfish Head (and few are), it delivers what it promises on the label which reads ""... a big American IPA, perfectly balanced yet full of flavor and aroma highlighting the complex citrus, pine and herbal characteristics of whole cone American hops.""",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

It keeps a full, thick lace throughout and leaves a ton of stick on the sides. Nearly perfect.  Smell has primarily pine and herbal hops, with just a hint of citrus. It's somewhat earthy with a bit of pale malt sweetness, as well.  Taste also starts off with resiny, piney, herbal hop flavor. There is a dash of citrus like the smell, and some malt sweetness provides some balance. Bitterness is substantial and gets close to hop bomb territory, but there is enough malt to provide at least some balance.  Mouthfeel is a nice medium body and quite smooth. It's not quite as creamy as some IPAs; as hoppy as it is it doesn't quite have the oily slick mouthfeel of many. It's also quite dry in the finish with a lot of herbal bittering hops left on the palate.  This is a very solid IPA.

The smell is uplifting: a beautiful bouquet of citrus, floral, and piney hops supported by sweet toasty malt and dark fruity pineapple.  Sweet toasted malt and pineapple provide the backbone of the flavor, and allow the piney, floral, citrusy hops to dance on top. A grapefruit bitterness shows up in the middle and lasts until the end. A bit of dry grassy bitterness is present as well. Toasted malt, bitter resinous hops, floral hops, and piney hops in the aftertaste. Wow, this beer is made by a true craftsman who has a talent for subtlety. So THIS is what hops are supposed to taste like.  Medium body, moderate carbonation, and a semi-dry finish.  Overall, this is an incredible beer. Expertly balanced, yet showcasing a variety of hops flavors. I can understand why a lot of liquor stores can't keep these on the shelves. It's so refreshing and tasty that I have no desire to switch to a different beer, and probably won't for the rest of the night. I feel like I have tasted hops for the first time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,pokesbeerdude,4.2,"Picked up a six pack from Liquor Depot in Rock Springs, WY. Around $8.  A: Deep copper with a khaki colored head, around an inch thick, fairly dense, ok retention but its disappearing pretty fast. A few spots of lacing, but nothing spectacular. Still a really good looking beer.  S: Big time hops, very citrusy and earthy, has lots of aromatic hop oil smells, really really strong on the hops, and I like that and wouldn't expect anything less from SN. Slight caramel sweetness underneath as well. Smells quite tasty.  T: Grapefruit and a sugary malty sweetness hit the tongue about the same time, this is great! Really aggressively hopped, hits the tongue almost as hard as a DIPA. Definite citrus rind and grassy lingering bitterness. As hoppy as it is, there are some nice sweet caramel malts. Excellent beer for a hop lover!  M: Medium thickness, light carbonation, and just enough hop puckering power to pull it all together, this is a great showing. Slight alcohol heat too.  D: For as hot as the hops are in the mouth, I could probably throw a few of these back in a night. It is really tasty, and an excellent spring time beer. Highly recommended, and I will definitely snag another sixer of this. Definitely in the runnings for my new favorite IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,gciccarelli,4.3,"12oz bottle poured into pint glass.  A - Pours an amber/orange with a nice fluffy white head. Excellent head retention. Very crisp and clear.  S - Big, hoppy smell. Citrus, particuarly grapefruit, with notes of pine. Not overpoweringly strong, but a very nice aroma with a variety of components.  T - Not a hop-bomb as one may be lead to expect...instead, a nicely balanced IPA. Citrus taste upfront with a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. Not excessively bitter...very nice. Slightly sweet biscuity malt is apparent as well. A great tasting IPA.  M - Medium body, medium carbonation - seems to be on par with how an IPA should be.  D - Nice balance to the taste - bitter as you would expect from a West Coast IPA, but not a ridiculously hard to drink hop-bomb. The 7.2% ABV is sneaky - you don't notice the alcohol at all. Very drinkable.  I'm very impressed by this offering from SN - will probably pick up a case. One of their best offerings!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,tronester,3.98,"Pours a hazy golden orange with a medium off-white head. Appears to be unfiltered, nice. Smell is of mint and pine. Taste is maltier than the average IPA, with a caramel toasted flavor throughout. The flavor from the hops is very herbal in character, earthy, with a hint of citrus in the finish. Nice high bitterness levels balance the malt sweetness nicely. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, quite nice. Carbonation levels slightly high, but with a vigorous pour, they can be brought to nice levels. Quite drinkable, but not as much compared to some IPA's, due to the higher ABV. Overall a very good beer, though it does seem to taste a lot like Sierra Nevada's other beers. All of their IPA's/Pale Ales seem to have a common flavor. Not that this is a bad thing, because the tastes are very good, it just seems a little more variety would be nice sometimes.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,btuthill,3.92,"Pours clear amber from 12 oz stubby bottle. Small head recedes quickly. Smell is of fresh cut citrus - stronger and more fresh than anticipated. The taste is similarly fresh and citrusy, but too much like SNPA for me. The hops may be mitigated a bit too much by the malt presence. Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit slick. Drinkable and well-priced session IPA. I will drink this again, but it isn't a go-to.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,cavedave,4.35,"Color is amber, beautiful. Head is thick cream at first. Sparse lacing remains on glass, and head dissipates quickly to a half inch layer. Nose is not overpowering, but is a complex blend of earth, herb, pine, and citrus, that is nicely balanced. Some very obvious care was taken in crafting a beer that could have a nose composed of such strong component aromas yet could present them so tasetefully understated.  Taste is sharp and delicious. An immediate rush of citrus and herbs. Hints of sweetness, not at all bready or caramely, hard to pin down, but which seem to be buried by, yet somehow in balance with, the stronger surrounding flavors, as contradictory as that sounds. Long wonderful finish. Like a symphony which pleases through multiple and differing fugues, and ends with a return to its original theme now revealed with clarity. Pine and citrus, give way to an incredibly and deliciously bitter ""herbosity"", that after seven sips has left me craving number eight. In all ways a fantastic brew, and despite its 7.2 abv could easily become a favorite session beer for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ElGordo,4.25,"Poured from the 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Body is a bright orange hue, topped by a finger's worth of creamy white head that leaves some pretty lacing on the glass. Beautiful floral aroma of sharp, tangy, citrusy hops, offset just enough by a mild biscuit malt character. Palate is assertively hoppy without being excessively bitter. Notes of pine and grapefruit are present, with an underlying mild sweetness from the biscuity malt. Nice, full body is very creamy for an IPA, but still works well with the flavors in play here. A very drinkable IPA, even if it is a bit strong. A welcome addition to the SN lineup.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,willjschmidt,4.47,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a New Belgium globe glass.  A: Pours a bright amber color with a great white head, leaving behind a lot of lacing.  S: Bursting with fresh hop aroma. Floral and citrus.  T: A top-notch IPA. Lots of great hop flavor. Good balance but the hops definitely shine in this brew.  M: Creamy and oily, medium bodied.  D: Sierra Nevada does IPA's and Pale Ale's like nobody's business. This is a great addition to their line-up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Atlas1,4.27,"Oooooh, a new Sierra Nevada beer. Always a good thing.  Pours a bright, clear amber color. Nice thick head that settles in thick clumps and leaves heavy lace. The nose is pleasant. Grapefruit and pine with lots of other nice citrus. Not as strong as I would have predicted the scent to be, but nice enough. The taste is great. Strong hop presence commands attention, but isn't entirely overwhelming (although it could be for the uninitiated IPA drinker). Nice fruit presence up front fades quickly to a hop-dominated taste, and ends with a funky cat pee aftertaste. No, I don't really know what cat pee tastes like, so this comparison is not a very good one. But the aroma does lend itself to a cat pee smell, and the aftertaste is funky. You do the math. Mouthfeel is firm and steady.  Another solid outing from SN. A fine hoppy beer with a bigger than expected ABV (at 7.20%, the alcohol is masked well). Hop lovers would do themselves a favor to hunt this puppy down and grab a few. A tasty treat for sure. Cheers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,MrHurmateeowish,4.35,"12oz bottle from McKinnon's in Salem, NH. Pours a deep amber body, slightly hazy, with a good inch of off-white head that leaves some nice lacing. Smells fruity and citrussy with a fair bit of toffee and caramel to balance the hops. Orange and pith are imediately apparent in the flavor, with just enough caramel to help balance the hops. Medium to fill in mouthfeel with ample carbonation, which helps make this one very drinkable considering the ABV and complexity. A superb IPA, well worth the buzz it's been getting.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bluemoonswoon,3.75,"12oz stubby poured into a New Belgium tulip.  Clear bright caramel orange with a half inch head tightly drawn over the mouth of the glass. Leaves some very nice looking clusters of bleached white lacing.  Bitter pine sap and a crack or two of black pepper with a malt backbone that is somehow able to assert itself just enough into this rather tight frame of reference,  Bitterly piney, only the slightest bit of any aspect of malt sweetness. This beer is bitter all the way (the embodiment of evil in all those old keystone light commercials for sure) this may be one of the bitterest beers I've ever come across and that is saying something. Astringent lemony, borderline coppery, with a throat-constricting dry hoppines.  It's odd, this is the last beer in this six pack, I've really enjoyed the previous five but looking at this last one under the microscope it certainly makes things more apparent but I'm not sure what I've found is what I want to keep experiencing. Oh if I could go back to those wonderful bliss free pre-rating days of a week ago I might think this beer have been better than it really was, alas, alas, alas I cannot.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,glid02,4.25,"Picked up a sixer of this at Tower on Piedmont in Atlanta.  Pours a clear copper color with a one-finger, slightly off-white head. The head dissipates into a patchy layer on top leaving solid lacing.  Smells great. Tropical fruit aromas with citrus hops lurking in the background. Sweet malts provide a bit of balance, but this is definitely a hoppy nose.  Tastes similar to how it smells, though not quite as intense. Citrus and tropical fruit hop flavors are backed up by sweet pale malts and end with a solid bitterness.  Mouthfeel is good. It's not quite as thick as I would have liked, but it's still solid with nice carbonation.  Drinkability is very good. I've had three tonight and had to restrain myself from drinking more.  Overall this was a very tasty beverage. This is an easily accessible beer that can compete with some of those that are not as easy to find. Definitely worth a shot.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,EnojysAnyBeer,4.41,"A- Very clear orange looks like the color of water after soaking in hops. Nice looking carbonation rises to the top to make an intense head with soapy bubbles that stick to side of the glass. Thick sheet of lace left on my imperial pint glass.  S- Oh yes, loads of various hops have found their way into this beer. You know what hops smell like. Imagine all the different hops you've smelled before in a Sierra Nevada all stuck right under your nose. Somewhat pungent, but I can dig that ""complex herbal character"".  T- The label says it is ""...perfectly balanced yet full of flavor... American hops"". Disregard perfectly balanced unless you are a major hop head. This beer is downright bitter all over the tongue. There is sweetness but not enough to balance the barrage of piney, citric flavors on the tongue. Fortunately, I am a hop-head.  M- The active carbonation keeps this beer afloat above your taste-buds if you are pounding it back, yet it is also smooth enough to savor  D- I could really see this becoming a staple in my fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BlackBearForge,4.03,"Pours a very nice coppery amber in between light and dark with a foamy off white head leaving a persistant bubbly froth as it fades and nice thick oily curtains.  The aroma is of grassy hops with citrus and piney resinous tones evident. Not an in your face scent but nice and clean.  The taste is wonderfully balanced between strong hops tasting of the aforementioned lemony orange citrus and piney resin, and a nice lightly sweet malt base. Finish is nicely bitter in the back of the mouth.  Mouthfeel is medium, smooth and a bit slick with moderate carbonation that does prickle the tongue a bit.  Drinkabilty is very good as the balance is exceptional, flavors are complex but not overwhelming. An artfully constructed IPA and a welcome addition to SN's full time line up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Thorpe429,4.05,"G: Poured into an imperial pint glass.  A: Beautiful cherry-amber beer with a creamy white head. The head is maybe two fingers thick with plenty of bubbles. A little bit of visible carbonation. Great lacing.  S: Strong. Sweetness and hops galore.  T: Lots of hops, although it definitely has a solid backbone to it as well. Generic citrus without any one fruit-type flavor dominating others. Quite balanced.  M: Medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. No real taste of alcohol--goes down smooth.  D: Definitely drinkable, although not as much so as SN Pale Ale, or as much so as some of the truly great IPA's.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,SShelly,4.22,"Pours a medium amber with large fluffy white head, decent retention, immediately hits you with some citrusy hop aroma.  Not as bitter as I was expecting, more supercharged with hop flavor then anything else. nice amount of hoppy flavor lingers on the pallet.  Thumbs up for this SN offering, could have had more hop aroma to go along with the flavor but overall very good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BeanBone,4.12,"Appearance: A deep burnt-orange, clear body with a big fluffy, off-white head. Good lacing.  Aroma: Lovely grapefruity, herbal, and piney hops over a solid caramel malt base.  Taste: Pleasantly bitter hops right off the bat with all the same characteristics you find in the nose. Right behind the hops, a big sweet malt background keeps everything in order. Superbly balanced, just what I've come to expect from Sierra Nevada. The moderately-high alcohol content is masked well. Great lingering bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with fine carbonation. Dries in the finish.  Drinkability: Just about average for a good IPA.  Verdict: I think Sierra Nevada is right about Torpedo being somewhere between an IPA and a Double IPA, but it's probably closer to the former. While I prefer Celebration to Torpedo, this is anything but a let-down. I can see this playing a big role in my regular rotation, especially during the Summer when Celebration is just a fond memory.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Kadonny,4.1,"I've been wanting to try this beer since release, I finally got to yesterday.  A: A dark amber orange color with a nice one finger white sticky head. Not much in the lacing on the glass.  S: Very nice, a ample amount of citrus on the nose with some pine hops and a nice underlying sweetness.  T: Citrus hops with grapefruit, orange and maybe some pineapple or lemon. The deeper pine notes come in after the citrus and the bready malty sweetness lies underneath the hops. This is one hoppy beer. Finish is hops bitterness. Very good beer.  M: Medium and dry, my only complaint is it does not really stick around as much as I would like. Still, alcohol is undetected and the beer feels good in the mouth.  D: High, another Sierra Nevada drinker. Have another!  Overall I can't see how people say they are let down by this beer, I thought it was fantastic. The hops are plentiful, the malt holds it together and makes it ever so drinkable. Another great brew by SN, might even rival the beloved Celebration as it has more fresh hops flavor. Nice work, I'll be drinking this for years to come.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,PhxHorn,4.1,"Poured from a bottle, this is a red/orange color with a quarter inch of white head. Smells moderately of citrus--not like a west coast hop bomb, but respectable enough. Tastes as it smells--a respectable hop hit, but not overwhelming like some of the west coast hop bombs. Lingering bitterness aftertaste. Carbonation was just right, and I cruised through this one pretty quickly. A nice solid middle-of-the road IPA that I like already.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ROBORB,4,"Bottle thanks to MrChopin, thanks man! This beer pours a hazy orange color with a nice 1 1/2 finger head. The aroma consists of pine, citrus, and caramel.

140,30420,Drew966,4.1,"Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA pours amber with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is nice, hoppy, mostly in a citrusy way. There is a medium body. The flavor is very hoppy, but not as intense as a double IPA. More citrusy than pine like, but there is definitely some pine. The malt is in the background, but balances this beer nicely. Very drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,joshuadlight,3.45,"I was really looking forward to getting my hands on this as I love all the other year round SN offerings. Overall, though, I was a little let down. Torpedo is not a staple of its style in the same way that SNPA or SN Stout are. The look is outstanding right off the bat though. Beautiful dark golden amber with a robust and fluffy head that lasts all night long. One of the things I really love about IPAs is their aroma. I love the citrus and pine in the nose. I was most let down in this area with the Torpedo. Its nose just doesn't measure up with other standard IPAs like Stone or DFH 60. I took deep pulls into my nostrils and it keep coming up empty. What smell was there was not all that pleasing. The taste is fine, but not mindblowing. Too much pine and too little citrus in my opinion. The bitterness is good, not overwhelming, making it quite drinkable despite being over 7% ABV. As with any SN beer, I can't completely crush this beer because it has plenty of redeeming features, but its probably not going to find a permanent place in my rotation. There are plenty of IPAs in the same price range that I like better.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,cbn,3.11,"Twelve ounce bottle poured into an English pint glass. Thick foamy off-white head sits above a clear golden amber body leaving curtains of lace throughout the session.  Soft sweet tea aroma with a bitter citrus edge growing larger as the ale warms.  Grapefruit juice, a little sweet tea with honey and lemon, lasting hop flavor. The nutty malt flavor is barely a spectator in this match.  Prickly carbonation cuts though ample body leaving a creamy scrubbing film.   A well made ale, weighted to the hoppy side, average in the drinkability department.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bashiba,3.9,This beer poured a bright clean copper color witha very thin white head.  The smell was very funky with a wet basement/gym sock quality to it.  The flavor had a nice bit of toasted grain and bready malts mixing nicely with the citrusy and piney hops. A very balanced and barely bitter IPA.  The mouthfeel was fairly light and a bit sticky.  A very drinkable IPA that won't burn out your pallatte. Would make a nice session IPA.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Blakaeris,3.8,"Pours clear amber-copper with a modest soapy head that quickly dissipates.  Aroma is definite caramel malt base with herbal and earthy hops.  Taste is bready caramel malt up front, along with a touch of brown sugar. Light citrus fruit - orange and pineapple. Hops come on strong with an earthy bitterness that lingers in the crisp finish.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Slight hop oil residue.  Overall a pleasant and flavorful IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The smell is strong of grapefruit and orange citrusy hops along with pine, floral hops and some caramel malts. The taste is bitter--grapefruit, hops, pine, and slightly roasted malts. Mouthfeel is crisp, acidic, yet doesn't burn the mouth.  This is a very drinkable IPA. Another solid beer from Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,IPALOVER,4.6,"I was excited to see this IPA from Sierra Nevada. I knew it would be good!  I was not disappointed-- the beer poured a dark amber into a pint glass, and left a light lace as I drank.  It reminded me of Sierra Nevada Celebration without the stronger malt characteristic-- still had plenty of piney, resinous hops! YUM!  This is a session IPA. I hope I can find it in Colorado-- had it while visiting family in AZ last week.  If you like traditional American west coast IPAs, this is one for you!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,johnnnniee,4.03,"Pours a crystal clear deep copper almost orange color with a huge creamy/bubbly beige head that sticks itself to my glass all the way down. Aroma is pine and resin and citrus with a hint of caramel deep underneath. Taste is much the same. Starts with some pine and resin followed by some caramel that peaks through followed by more bitter citrus with a bone dry finish. Body is medium, carbonation is medium as well, mouthfeel is resinous and a little sticky. Another hops showcase from Sierra Nevada. Lots of West Coast hops with a hint of malt. 7.2% is well hidden.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,gunnerman,4.23,"Poured into a pint glass, pours a copper color with a nice foamy head that leaves nice thick lace on the glass. Smell is very impressive nice west coast hop, citrus and earth tones and a bit of lemon zest. Taste is upfront and in your face hop, very bitter and strong with an overall nice malt backbone. This also leaves that nice hop aftertaste.

140,30420,jculler82,3.78,"12 oz. bottle to a pint glass.  Pours a nice orange tinted amber, with a two finger frothy off white head that settles to a 1/4"" frothy foam. Just like all Sierra Nevada beers, the head on this is great and earned it a bump in the appearance rating.  Smell is the expected cascade hop, piney, citrusy ripe grapefruit. Smells good, but wasn't anything more than what I expected from SN.  The taste is exactly what you would expect from the smell. Piney and citrus hop notes, actually more to the pine side, with a subtle malt background. The malt kicks in so briefly it takes another sip to make sure it was there. Hops rule the beer, but they should in an IPA. The bitterness hits after the swallow (right after the brief malt note) and lingers well after it too.  Overall, a very good IPA.  Note: To me, this beer is very similar to the Harvest Ale, which is a good thing. If you liked the Harvest Ale, you'll probably also like Torpedo.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Jimbo87,4.32,"In a US pint glass.  Fairly clear copper. Big pale rocky head.  Smells like grapefruit and pine.  Tastes like grapefruit and pine. Very smooth delicious hops. Hop profile reminds me of a toned-down Hopslam. Pretty good malt taste, but very much in the shadow of the wonderful hops.  Medium body, medium carbonation.  Very very drinkable. I'm truly impressed. An outstanding IPA, and maybe the best I've tried so far. I'll definitely be drinking this again. Highly recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,charlzm,4.44,"Consumed 03/20/09.  Beer pours a very clear coppery hue into a pint glass. A very sticky, fine 1.5 finger head forms and eventually just coats the inside of the glass. Few active bubbles.  Herbal, grapefruit, grassy, oily hop aroma. Slightly woody smell as well. Very aromatic - I smelled it at least 18 inches from the glass.  Slightly thick mouthfeel. Some creaminess and oiliness. A little bite on the back end.  Flavor is smooth. Loaded with caramel/crystal malts, it starts off a bit bready, stopping shy of sweet. Then the grapefruity, oily, piney hops come in on the dryish finish, leaving an easily noted, near aspirin bitterness to linger a long time on the tongue.  Cleanly dry, almost evaporative finish.  Considering the ABV, this is an easy drinking beer. In this style (California almost-but-not-quite double IPA), I think I'm going to have to give a slight edge to Firestone's Union Jack. Still, this is a really well done brew.  For the record, I also tried to drink it in 2015 from a can and it was awful right out of the can. Poured it into a glass and it was fine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ClockworkOrange,4.13,"Poured from a stubby 12 ounce bottle into my shaker glass. Appears a hazy copper color with a solid two fingers of fluffy, off white foam. A really nice pour. The nose and taste is dominated by grapefruit, orange/tangerine, pine, skunky hops, bread, and caramel malt. Finish is a bit spicy, crisp and slightly warming. The beer is medium bodied with medium to moderate carbonation. A beer that will find a spot in my rotation quite regularly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,merlin48,4.33,"Bottle pours an impressive, radiant golden amber body with a tall and sturdy almond head. Abundant lacing is patchy and sticky.  Aroma is pine and grapefruit, but more citrusy than most of the SN pale ales. Toasted caramel underneath.  Body and carbonation are medium, with a pronounced hop bite on the tongue.  Taste is nicely balanced between a bready maltiness and the dry bittering hop profile. Alcohol is not detected. Hops have more of a sweetish pink grapefruit character than most of its SN cousins, but there is still an assertive pine cone dry bitterness. Finishes clean and dry.  This is a solid IPA. I like the hopping. I hope this one becomes as common as SNPA, as it has the potential to be quite a standard.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,canucklehead,4.32,Interesting to try on of these after both a SN Pale and then the ESB as you see the brewery profile carried through from PA to ESB then to IPA but the hops get cranked up along the way. A bigger darker and hoppier cousin to the famous PA this is really balanced in the malt side but the hops are in your face in both the nose and the finish. A great beer that SN fans have been waiting years for them to make.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The aroma is some bready malts with some fruity metallic hops.  The flavor is a little caramel bready malt at the base and some melon followed by a big sweet and fruity resiny hop finish that has a big bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with creamy and slightly sharp carbonation.  Overall, a really well done IPA. Big on the bitterness, but semi-balanced as well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DoctorDog,4.03,"Presentation: 12 oz bottle into a nonic. Thanks to beveritt for letting me swipe this from his stash to sample.  A- Sparkling clear copper/amber. Pours with ~1 1/2 fingers of off white head, which fades slowly to a thin cap, leaving ample lacing as consumed.  S- Solid grapefruit hoppiness, with a touch of floral notes. After the initial hoppy rush, some malty notes emerge.  T- Big hit of pine resin/floral bitterness on first sip, but mellows somewhat immediately thereafter. Citrus notes are surprisingly less than the nose led me to expect. Fairly solid malt sweetness works to balance the bitterness. Alcohol is well blended.  M- Moderate carbonation with a nice crisp bite, and goes down quite smoothly. Nice and dry on the finish, but with a fair amount of residual oiliness.  D- Quite good. This was one of those beers that surprised me in how quickly it was gone...  Future outlook: A really good brew. Really seemed to fit the bill nicely as a bridge between and tamer IPA and a huge DIPA. I'm sure I'll want to give it another whirl sometime.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,WickedSluggy,4.39,"I have been regularly asking several of my favorite stores when they're getting this beer. Finally arrived to DFW in March.  A - Pale amber color. Nothing special about the way this beer looks. Not a lot of foam, but nice sticky lacing.  S - Piney hops bouquet and sweet malt. From its smell I might could be prepared for a DIPA or harvest ale.  T - Bright intensely hoppy. Very good IPA hops flavor with malt holding its own in the background. Malt flavor is not complex. Very bitter as it should be.  As it warms the malt comes out more but the beer remains dry true to the California style.  M - Medium bodied  D - Fits its intended purpose and definitely meets my expectations.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,daledeee,4.1,Reviews are pretty high for this beer.  This beer pours a bright dark golden or coppery color. Head is about an inch high. The nose is quite hoppy with floral undertones.  Taste left a first impression of nothing but hops. I have grown accustomed to asking for some malt balance. I did not get that. The second bottle I had was somewhat better. Might have been the day. Mouthfeel is fine as with most IPA or pale ales. The beer is drinkable due to freshness and my preference for the strong hop beers  Update: I have continued to drink this beer as it is readily available. The taste is quite clean and is mostly hop oriented but is quite a nice beer. There is a malt profile lurking behind the hop slam.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Colt4540,4.63,"A- A medium clear amber color pours with a good head that takes a long time to leave. Has a solid half finger head that last throughout the entire beer. Leaves very nice lacing.  S- Has a very light malty flavor dominated buy floral piney hops.  T- A complete hop punch in the mouth. Slight maltiness. This is the perfect beer for hop lovers. The warmer it gets the more complex it becomes.  M- Crisp and light for and Extra IPA. And again the warmer it gets the easier it is to drink.  D- I could drink a ton of these, but the ABV. would end up getting me shit faced before I could drink too many of them.  Note- Everyone of my friends think that this tastes like Pinesol, Hairspray, or cologne. What a bunch of Idiots.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,lackenhauser,4.06,"Gorgeous coppery colr. Nice tight head on top. text book picture of what a beer should look like-very impressive. Soft, resiny aroma. Somewhat pine like and citrusy. Big hop flavor up front. Quite bitter but not overly so. Thick and lingering resin like flavors. Storng malt sweetness comes thru at the end. As storng as the hops are they dont ""tongue strip"" like some beers. Solid body. Very, very drinkable beer. Somewhere between their pale ale and Celebration, more towards the latter. Damn good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Risser09,4.16,"12 oz bottle poured into a mexican tulip - Fridge temp - 2008?  Appearance: Pours a golden orange color with a very tall 5"" cream colored head. It has great retention and gods of clinging, spidery lace. Deep craters are formed in the head.  Smell: Citrusy hops are strong. Grapefruit is the main aroma. Slightly mineral and somewhat metallic.  Taste: A nice balance of pale malts and vegetal, herbal hop flowers. There is a bit of citrus, but not as focal as the aroma would indicate. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Bitter, but not cloying at all. There are equal parts of bitter, sweet, herbal and alcohol feelings. Medium body that goes down easy and leaves a bitterness in the mouth.  Drinkability: Excellent. This is probably the most drinkable of their beers. I'd like to try it next to SNPA and the harvest series. Worth buying and trying.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

The off-white, fluffy head is a bit over an inch thick when poured. Good lacing too. Aromas of piney, citrus grapfruit and hos, followed by a nice caramel malt smell. Has a nice, robust grapefruit and hop flavor upfront, followed by a caramel malty sweetness, ending with a hint of roasted nuttiness. Not overly complex, but damn good! Has a crisp, frothy and creamy medium bodied mouthfeel with mild to moderate carbonation. Extremely easy to drink in a good way. I liked this one quite a bit.

140,30420,DukeofAle,4,"I just about fainted when I saw this on the shelf at Cyclone Liquors - AIPA is my favorite style and SNPA is one of my all time favorite ales. Most of the beers I've tried fall far short of that wonderful pale ale. So I was well primed to love this beer and bought a case having never tried it before.  Still, I'm not sure it's all that - I've has better. The apperance is very nice, the head voluptuous, the lacing persistent, the fragrance enticing - it just dosen't quite taste as good as I'd hoped. Unreasonable expectations? I'm glad Sierra Nevada decided to produce a full-time AIPA and it is a wonderful brew, but it's not the very best.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: Delicate piney, grapefruit, orange and a bit of vegetation. You can sense the sweet malt base toward the end. No hints of alcohol. The nose is setting this up to be a solid IPA.  T: The nose was just a hint of the quality of this beer. Robust pine and grapefruit hop character. Hearty sweet caramel malt. Lovely.  M: Medium body. Lightly carbonated. Nothing outstanding but certainly no complaints.  D: Superb. I have a case of this to serve as my ""daily drinker.""",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

It has a solid pale and Carapils malt scent along with an outstanding citrus hop nose. It's not overly done, but you can tell this is borderline DIPA territory. The taste is good. It has a tremendous hop bitterness that resinates in the finish. The malt character is good, although it's surprisingly thin. The mouthfeel is fine. Again, I was thinking it would be fuller, but a thinner, more drinkable hop bomb is certainly good with me. This is a tastey beer. Sierra Nevada is really coming out with some great new beers. They're bold and full flavored; very nice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Mebuzzard,4.1,"This is a very solid IPA. An amber, clear light amber pour and a good foaming head introduces the beer as above average. The aroma is a good balance of the three biggies, IMO: citrus/pine hops, earthy hops and sweet malt. Of course the malt is the least of the powers, but it balances well. Most of the beer is non-aggressive. That is, it doesn't overpower with loads of hops. It has just enough to throw the kilter towards bitter. Nice bite, but it won't distract you. Clean, crisp. Under the radar...like a torpedo? ha.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,rodney45,3.74,"I like the color of this beer, its more Irish red then amber. This beer is a very good example of what an Extra IPA should smell like. The Magnum hops are fantastically overwhelming upon even opening the 12 oz bottle, chilled, but not cold. I don't know why, but i was a bit underwhelmed by the beer itself. I was expecting a big bitter Extra IPA, and was kind of let down. By all means, this beer is extremely good, but... I wanted more. I love Sierra, and this was a good addition to their line of enjoyable, well balanced beers. The problem with this beer is that I was spoiled by the Anniversary and Celebration ales...

140,30420,GatorBeerNerd,3.43,12 oz bottle purchased as part of a 6 pack from Jax. I split the 6 pack with my friend. Poured into a Sierra Nevada Hop Tulip glass.  A: Pours a clear amber color with a small amount of tiny bubble off white head. The lacing coats the sides of the glass as it is consumed.  S: There is a grassy hop aroma with a bit of caramel malt aroma mixed in. There are a lot of beers in the style that have a lot more of an interesting aroma.  T: A very light flavor for the style in both malts and hops. A weak caramel malt flavor with not much in the way of hop flavor. What is there matches the nose and has a grass like flavor.  M: It has a medium thickness and the carbonation does not assist to make it more smooth.  D: This one does not go down as easy as many others in the style. I am a bit surprised that I do not care for this beer that much.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,cullenvens,5,"This is my favorite beer. I thought I should preface this review with that tidbit.  The floral notes are slightly piney. They are countered by happy sweetness. The hops they use for this beer are exceptional and flavorful. I still can't get over the flavor. The second I put this delightful beer to my nose, I swore I was in a hop field in bloom. The mouthfeel is immense. I was overwhelmed. I swished and swallowed and went back for more.

The smell and taste are (guess what?) totally hops. though not too citrusy in the aroma, the flavor is more citrusy. Both very floral.. its like a tree in a glass. Its got a very clean, refreshing aspect to the flavor and mouthfeel . Not too bitter.. Certainly an IPA thats not just for hop addicts. it does have over a 7% abv, but seems very easily drinkable, almost sessionable if it werent for the relatively-higher abv.

About an inch of creamy off white foat, sheets of lacing and head retention were really fantastic. Nose is of citrusy hops, a bit piney. There is actually a good deal of malt in the nose as well. Taste is the citrus hopes (grapefruit and orange, maybe a touch of lemon) and pine bursts at first. There is a strong malt backbone that gives a good deal of girth to this beer.

140,30420,TheodorHerzl,3.56,"Appearance: Pours a nice clear amber color with a two fingers worth of head on it. Smell: It isn't the most intense IPA, but I do get lemon peel, grapefruit rind, and some other citrus smells lightly balanced with a touch of toasted malt. Taste: The flavor profile is very well balanced between the citrus flavors and a nice toasted malt base. I am also getting a slight touch of caramel in the malt that is welcomed on this offering. I was hoping for more bitterness and pine on the flavor profile, but they are only slightly apparent. Mouthfeel: Good carbonation leaves an almost prickly sensation in your mouth and it coats the mouth very well. Drinkability: Great balance on this beer helps to be able to have multiple. I could easily see myself taking a sixer of these to BBQ's this summer.  I just personally think the malt profile outshines the hop profile on this beer, and this is more of a bigger pale ale than an IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

It has a very appealing color to it certainly darker than most IPAs.  The aroma is light which is kind of surprising. Pine dominant with nice blend of citrus and freshness. It almost smells like fresh air. It is hoppy upon the initial smell but has a distinct malt background. The malt scent is almost honey like.  The taste is light and hoppy upon the initial sip but it lingers in your mouth after you have finished your sip. It is a nice blend of freshness and pines which is both very refreshing and tasty. It does not have an overwhelming taste to it but the blend of citrus and piney hops certainly wakes up your taste buds. The malt background comes out upon the finish and it makes each sip well balanced and enjoyable.  The drinkability of the beer is nice in that it is light and refreshing.. not too heavy at all. The carbonation is a bit much but it fits well with the hoppy character of the beer. It is not an outstanding IPA by any means but it is certainly good and worth trying.

Smells like a pine forest with a bunch of citrus thrown in the mix. The taste is extremely deep and roots itself in your mouth for many seconds after swallowing. A very piney taste, much like the aroma, and also reminds me of grapefruit or other bitter fruits.  Mouthfeel and drinkability are both high, as with many IPA's of this caliber.  Overall, one of the strongest Sierra Nevada releases.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Strong hop presence easily detected in the aroma. Very inviting with pronounced notes of pine and citrus.  Taste reveals lots of piney hops along with clear notes of citrus, mostly grapefruit but also some light hints of lemon and orange. Despite the strong hop presence, some malt can also be cleanly detected in the finish. A faint spiciness can be felt in the aftertaste.  Medium body with just the right amount of carbonation. Too high an ABV to be considered a session but I don't really care, I wouldn't mind drinking this stuff all day.

Big fan of the hop profile in this beer. Flavors of orange, lemon & lime combo with a resin-like element. Bitter and acidic, yet balanced with a nice malty biscuit punch.

Appearance is a nice orange amber with a clean foamy white head with ample head retention and decent lacing.  The aroma's are dominated by strong pine and hop bitterness followed by a nice twang of fresh grapefruit.  One taste from this beer and it demanded my attention. Starts off with a good hop pop giving way to a good malty backbone to balance out this beast of an IPA. Finishes smooth with a nice bready aftertaste lingering on the tongue.

Slightly unbalanced I guess, not bad but doesn't quite work for some reason. Mouthfeel is solid and grows on you as the beer warms, in fact I might try this at room temperature to add some impressions for this brew.

T: Yummy. Begins with a very nice grapefruit note that evolves to lemon peel. Then on the swallow you pick up some piney hints that are quite refreshing. Dominant in the aftertaste, but not overbearing on the palate. In between grapefruit and pine you find a very nice maltiness that seems to bounce between sticky sweet and dry. Very nice job.  M: Nice attenuation keeps the sticky sweet mouthfeel at bay and their is some dryness that makes you yearn for another sip.  D: I found this more drinkable than SNPA just because the mingling of flavors is a real treat.

Not bad in any way, but nowhere near the style you might think. Actually a decent session brew. The taste is very similar to their ESB, nice lasting head, slight hops on the nose. Going blind I'd guess this to be a slightly hoppy APA. let alone an IPA or DIPA. Again, very balanced and very drinkable, but please don't call this an IPA. The drink ability drives up the score on this one.  A second review supports the first one,. Surprising because tastes change with exposure to different brews.

The head falls fast and leaves big soapy bubbles. S= Good. It actually smells like really bitter hops with a little sweetness. Grapefruit comes through and a little pine. T= Wow. This is the first beer that I've had that I thought was over hopped. Up front it's fine. Pine and small grapefruit come through. Then the after taste lingers for sooo long on the back of my tongue. It's not really describable in any way besides really bitter. Taste reminds me of a homebrew that I didn't let bottle condition properly. M= Average weight and very very dry D= Not too great. The extreme lingering hop flavor lasts way too long in the after taste. It satisfies my hop craving but not more than one. I may buy it again if I have an extreme craving but a little over board for me. The hoppiest bitter beer I've ever had.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Young and freshly agitated the aroma is damp, sweet pine needle; citrusy fruit punch balanced with spice. Several minutes later...the head is sill on steroids, needed to be roughed up though. Medium body, sharp with several notes interchanging, finishing long with a refreshing bitter. The hops are zesty, prickling a humbly balanced malt background.

140,30420,IBUnit63,3.93,"12 oz. into a trusty mason jar...  I do like the look of this stuff. Crystal-clear copper-bourbon body with moderate quick carbonation. Head is 1 1/2 fingers and sticks around for the most part. The perfectly eggshell-colored head leaves excellent lacing.  With the exception of a telltale Sierra Nevada mildly metallic tinge at firt (caps? yeast strain?) there's a solid floral and slightly grapefruit hop tinge that represents well...quite fresh indeed. Malt provides a little caramel balance to the hop oiliness but this really doesn't need much. A hint of alcohol works. Slight earthiness emerges with warmth.  Wow...the carbonation makes an impact here...it spritzes up what is now a grapefruit rind-ladened oily hop bundle of goodness. There's a mild sweet caramel-alcohol touch in here but it's definitely overshadowed by the rich hop character. Warmth gives it a little more synergy and calms the carbonation down. A bit of earthiness muddles it slightly...age or yeast strain?.  This starts out bright and spritely and calms down into a true fresh IPA. A little all over the place but quite solid overall. Finish is a bit oily and slightly earthy. Age, probably...they don't use Ringwood at all, do they?  Man, the elements are good and overall it's OK but almost everything Sierra Nevada does that I have tried tends to leave me wanting a little bit. No exception here...I prefer the whole to be greater than the sum of its parts rather than the other way around.

140,30420,mothman,4.2,"Poured into New Belgium Globe Glass.  Pours a 1 and a half finger slightly tan head. Color is an orange copper. Clear. Great retention. Splattered lace.  Aroma is mainly hops. Very piny. Citrus notes and grapefruit. A very appealing aroma.  Taste comes off just slightly malty then the hops hit. Carmel malts, pine hops, citrus zest. Very great taste.  Mouthfeel is an intense bitterness but in a good way. Wow it just fills the mouth with happiness. Leaves the normal dry aftertaste of an IPA. Carbonation is good as well.  Right now I am thinking to myself, ""Why did I buy just one of these?"" This will definitely be a go to beer, since it is seasonal. This beer is really great and packs a large flavor. The 7.2% is also completely unnoticeable. I highly recommend.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Docer,3.48,"Purchased a 6-pack from Belmont Station here in Portland..  - Great dark amber color, like a slightly aged copper penny. Light off-white head w/ a tiny bit of lacing. Not foggy, but clear.  - I was expecting a bigger, more citrus-like smell... but didn't get that. Slight sour and bitter hop notes, and a bit of caramel malt. Smells like the ESB.  - To me it tastes like their ESB as well... sweet, malty, caramel.. and a punch of bitterness. Taste is rather strong n' sweet.. but to me not really like an IPA.  - Decent carbonation.. but a bit too much.. a bit chewy... leaves me grating my teeth. Somewhat dry.  - Good in flavor, but not too drinkable.. a bit too rich for an easily drinkable IPA. All my favorite IPA's can really go down in quantity if desired.  Overall I am not impressed with this one... going out of my way to get it.. kind of wish I saved the extra $9 on my $100 shopping spree. Summit hops? Tasted that hop a lot more in Widmers Drifter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,talkinghatrack,4.05,"a - amber color, three finger head. Soap bubbles on the lacing but it does stick around well.  s - hops explosion. I get a little sulfur underneath, too.  t - no surprise - grapefruit and hops. The bitterness starts light but grows until the first inhale after a swallow. Then it just mellows out. Some lower throat warming.  m - medium body with some mouth coating. Great light yet prickly carbonation.  Okay, the recent forum posts tempted me to try this one. Most said that they generally disliked their first 1-2 glasses but then grew to appreciate it as the night went on. I'm not a big hops guy so I didn't get the six-pack to try out that theory but I did let the bottle warm up quite a bit before pouring so I can taste things more clearly.  d - As not much of a hops fan, this is decent. Even from one glass I think I can see the draw on liking this more as the night goes on. As with anything, the taste becomes less intense as you consume more of it in a short session. I don't know that I would session the stuff but I think it would be a reasonable option for pitchers shared with hop-loving friends. It warms nicely too - no big alcohol hits develop on the nose and the good mouthfeel works at warmed temps. I have to rate this in-category and say that as a well-hopped beer I like it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jgap,4.16,"Big thanks to matt for this one! Pours a deep amber with tons of frothy, white head. Smell is sweet grapefruit, with a hint of toffee and some earthy notes. Taste is slightly malty up front. Smooth toffee which is quickly interrupted by the hops. Strong grapefruit, earthy notes and some slight pepper. The aftertaste is a lingering crisp hoppiness.

140,30420,bkilpatr,3.81,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. 03/09/09.  Pours a clear orange-amber color with an inch of soft beige foam. The head receded slowly leaving lots of sticky lacing. Aroma is of citrusy and piny hops and hints of malt. A bit tame, but still smells good.  Taste starts with sweet caramel and biscuit-like malt flavor. That is followed by plenty of bitter citrus and piny hops. Some grapefruit flavor as well. The taste is well balanced between the sweetness up front and the bitter finish.  Feel is smooth with ample carbonation. It's medium-bodied and leaves some stickiness around the mouth. Drinkability is decent, but it's too heavy to be sessionable.  Overall, a very solid beer.

Citrus notes of orange, lemon, and pine are obvious. Taste is stronger than the aroma, beginning with the sweetness of the expected lemon and orange citrus. The sweetness is followed by more acidic grapefruit leading into a pleasant pine bitterness, strong, but not puckering. Well-balanced. Moderate carbonation is present and mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth. Overall, a very tasty and refreshing beer. I will definitely have this one again. Not overly complex, but solid and very enjoyable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Interesting.  Nose is soft and citrusy, a bit piney. Not very bold.  Taste is clean and citrusy. Clean citrusy hops with a piney astringency sit on top of a mildly sweet, not-quite-biscuity malt note. As the beer warms, the sweet turns a bit caramelly, and the citrus melds with the sweetness to get a bit more pronounced. Clean but fairly astringent at the same time, if that makes sense.  Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated, sharp, with a medium-full mouthfeel that's just a bit oily.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,grayburn,4.47,"Sierra Nevada is a brewery that is really starting to grow on me. The torpedo pours a nice golden color with heavy frothy head and some nice retention and lacing. Impressive. The smell is like a rainbow of hops, with each getting a little time in the limelight. The taste follows suit directly so I shall just merge the two categories together. There is some pine, citrus, mint, flowers, all backed up with just enough malt. Excellent hop profile on this beer. The mouthfeel is crisp and big at the same time like a good ipa. carbonation is strong, holding up to the alcohol and the hops at the same time. Torpedo is pretty easy to drink, smooth and very well rounded.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Taste is oily, piney hops with a nice balance of malt to keep the hoppiness from being over the top. Medium bodied with a chewy mouthfeel. I didn't really feel that this was similar to Celebration, it has it's own unique character - I like it and welcome it as a new year round choice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Leaves a perfect sheet of lacing all the way down the glass.  S: Smells strongly of hops and pine with some small traces of caramel maltiness.  T: Very heavy on the hop side. Strong hops with hints of citrus and strong pine almost completely mask the small caramel flavor of the malts. Very dry bitter finish. The alcohol kicks in and out throughout the drink starting from the 3rd sip to the last...it seems to be some weird affair of SN pale ales.  Overall: Good mouthfeel, decently carbonated and oily. The drinkability goes down a bit due to the lack of balance, but still very good. I'm sure that if SN put this in a bomber and released it once a year it's rating would make it on the top 100.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smell: There are a lot of subtitles in this drink. Nice piney notes, and some very nice citrus notes. There are also some nice sweet berry notes. Almost like white grapes. Very nice nose.  Taste: Taste is a bouquet of citrus. Lemon juice, orange zest, grapefruit. There is a very pleasant sweet undertone to this. Like the white grape in the nose it has the same bright sweetness in the taste. The malts are very subtle but, are very very nice.  Mouth: Medium bodied, a light/bright carbonation. Leaves the mouth just a little thick. Pretty good.  Drink: For being slightly higher in ABV, and moderately bitter, very drinkable.

Crisp body with soft toasty malt and lots of hop. Excellent IPA. It's not over-the-top hoppy, but it's got a kick. The malt is just present enough to provide a solid ground without stealing the show.

140,30420,allengarvin,4.3,"A new SN beer in the Texas area. I poured this into a wide chalice. It has a very nice bright copper color, with a modest head. The aroma is appropriately hoppy, but surprisingly not cascades like all of SN's other beers. It has a nice earthy, resinous scent. Very nice flavor, with loads of hops to the taste, like new-mown hay or turned earth... perfect springy hop flavor. The malt is crisp and biscuit-like, and provides a nice balance. Not too heavy-bodied, and eminently drinkable.  A nice addition to the Sierra Nevada lineup. When I first had SN PA, about 20 years ago, it was the hoppiest thing I had ever drunk. Today, though it seems rather bland. This IPA isn't as far out there as some others, but it's a darned good-drinking one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,BeerSox,4.28,"12oz bottle into nonic. Had this on-tap May 30, 2008 at Bukowski's in Boston (Cambridge). This review contrasts previous review.  Crystal clear amber hue with a think and extremely dense one finger head. The head slowly settles to a thin cap, leaving behind a strong wall of lacing. Webby rings of lacing coat the glass.  The hop aroma, as I recall from my on-tap review, are very light, and somewhat surprisingly light now that I've heard more about the beer. Toasty malts with some leafy and slightly spicy hops.  The beer from the bottle seems to carry more hop flavor than it did on-tap, but not much more. The torpedo process really captures the hop flavor to keep it inline with the amount of bitterness. You can almost feel the hop oils.  A very drinkable hoppy beer. The on-tap version seemed to be slightly lighter, more like your average AIPA. This one definitely is loaded with the grapefruit citrus flavors. Highly recommended, in bottle, or on-tap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Big, bright, pure hop smell. Wonderfully floral and bitter. Perfect is a word that comes to mind. Just what I'm looking for when I reach for an American IPA.  T - Wonderfully balanced while still packing a punch. Big hop flavor - banana, grapefruit, flowers are all present. The finish leaves a lingering bitterness that is very pleasant - none of that puckerface action sometimes associated with an IPA. A paramount example of the style.  MF/D - Very drinkable, especially conisdering the alcohol content. Delightfully interesting mouthfeel.  I can't reccomend this beer enough.

Smell: Herbaceous, fresh-cut grass scent with a touch of citrus blanket the bolstered pale malts with a meager note of toasted caramel.  Taste: Pale maltiness with a light caramel sweetness and just the faintest bit of toastiness to it. Generous hop flavors of citrus, pine needles, and peppery, grassy herbs with a bright, medium-high bitterness. A final acknowledgment of all the hop flavors for the bittersweet finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.  Drinkability: For me, it came across as a dialed up version of the SNPA, but that's just me.

140,30420,Bitterbill,4.35,"Bought locally for just over $9 a sixpack including tax.  This pours a very bright clear gold colour with about an inch of foam.  The smell is very hoppy with pine and citrus being well represented. Heck, I even get a decent caramel malt presence after more sniffing. I'm hoping that the malt is more assertive in the taste than the smell as I'm just in the mod for a balanced IPA.  The taste has big hop flavours up front with lots of citrus and grass, pine as well though more noticeable to me in the smell, and...yep...sandwiched in between I can defintely taste a good malt backbone that culminates about mid palate and just before the finish. The finish itself is hop dominated but there's still a smidgeon of malt there and it cuts into the bitterness nicely.  It has a medium mouthfeel and the carbonation is also medium but just saying that doesn't put it in proper perspective. Let me just say for the category, it's excellent.  Drinkability? Very tasty, unintrusive alcohol, nice mouthfeel, easy drinking...I think this is a terrific IPA that begged over and over for another sip. Sierra Nevada hit another home run with this one!

The head, like every SN I have tried, is a pillowing mass of fluffy bubbles. Retention is very strong and long lasting all the way to the grave. Sprial lacing around the glass like a tornado of bubbles and froth.  S: Aromas are strong with both citrus tang and peppery pine freshness. Hints of lemon, melon, and grassy herbs. A faint floral undertone. The hops smell vibrates from out of the glass. While not overwhelming it is an aroma that should be expected with some subtle apple undertones. .  T: This is straight hops zest with every taste. A great combination of grapefruit and pine needles. The bitterness is strong but not overwhelming. Very minimal pale and caramel malt balance that kicks in towards the end. Seems to lean more to the citrus hops. Crisp and refreshing with a long and dry finish. At over 7% this is a rewarding and fun beer to throw back.  M: Very sticky and resined despite having a relatively light body.  D: An absolute deal for the price. I need to try this in conjunction with the Celebration Ale to see which one I like more. It isn't quite a double but it is much more than your typical IPA. It delivers on the hops front.

This beer pours a deep amber red that shows some tangerine hues when held up to the light. The head was a bit small for a normal IPA but it did leave some very sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is, well, hoppy. Fresh squeezed lemon juice, handfuls of fresh pine needles, a bit of grapefruit and some lemon zest thrown in, to add a bit of bitterness. The flavor isn't as hoppy as the aroma. The pine is more prevalent, with the lemony citrus playing second fiddle. There is also just a bit of biscuits. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but it really doesn't affect the quality of the beer.

Lots of pine and herbal hop notes on the nose, with a little lighter citrus component than I was expecting. Definitely an IPA nose, though.  Piney herbaceousness follows through on the palate. Decent malt backbone with a lingering dry, bitter finish gives the impression of a more full mouthfeel to an otherwise medium-bodied beer.  It's been a long time since I've had anything from Sierra Nevada, so I won't even try to compare this to my memories of their flagship pale ale. On it's own this is a pretty good beer and I'd recommend trying it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Murchmac,3.2,"Extra flavor, extra fun, with wrigley's spearmint gum.  Pours out an uninspired flat looking orange. Like if Brittney Spears had a fake tan when she had her ""comeback"" performance on the VMA's.  Smells a little malty sweet, a little citrusy hoppy. Not very good on either account. Siskel and Ebert give it two thumbs down.  At least it tastes ok. Hoppy, not well balanced, but hoppy. It's lacking that something extra i'm looking for in my Extra IPAs.  Overall, Kate Moss thin, but you get a piney resiny aftertaste. Not impressed, they usually do IPA's right, but not with this blend of 11 secret herbs and spices.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,strangebrew52,4.01,"A: Pours a nice amber color with a bout a fingers worth of head.  S: I'm not getting much from the smell, a trace amount of piney hops but not much else  T: You can't smell much but the taste is great, lots of piney bitterness up front with a hint of citrus a tad bit of sweetness but it works really well  M: Medium bodied with light carbonation, nice an crisp and goes down smooth.  D: Great session beer, especially for the price.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,htomsirveaux,4.42,"12 oz. bottle tried 5 Mar 2009. Courtesy of Phil, thanks!  Poured in 0.5 L Adambrau becker. Very large thick tan head. Moderate carbonation. Clear washed out copper color. Strong aroma of grapefruit, resin and ethanol. Stars with a lot of sweet hops, floral and resin. Lots of bittersweet bruleed grapefruit, some caramel. Bitterness kicks in towards the end and finish. Strong tangy citrus notes in the aftertaste. Medium body. Ethanol is nicely warming.  Full of hop flavors without being overly bitter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Vonerichs,3.98,"Pours a deep copper color with a thin white head and light lacing.  The smell is not very intense. The strongest smell is floral/herbal hops complimented by light earthy tones.  The taste is much more defined than the smell. It's dominated by bitter floral hops with a hint of citrus. This is more bitter than I expected. There is a touch of caramel sweetness.  I enjoyed the mouthfeel. This is very smooth for the style and leaves a crisp, dry finish.  This goes down very easy and sessionable.  For the price, very good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,prototypic,4.3,"Appearance: Torpedo's very clear and copper in color. Not a single bit haze in the glass. The head is a tad off-white and stands about two fingers tall. It was pretty slow to recede and left a sticky coat of lace clinging to the glass.  Smell: The nose is not quite as strong as I'd like, but it is good. It's a little biscuity and yeasty up front. Some very refreshing citrus grapefruit, lemon, and orange scents emerge giving it a bit of a sweet smell. Hops are very vibrant. They smell a little piney, but mostly citric. A nice mix of pale and caramel malts is noted. Smells like the pale variety is the stronger of the two. Doesn't smell overly malty though. Good sign. Alcohol is not noted. Nice smell, but could use some more strength.  Taste: Citrus grapefruit, orange, and lemon strike first here. It's a very refreshing sweet flavor. Pale and caramel malts add more of a sweet flavor. Pale malts are definitely stronger and really lay a nice foundation for the hoppy flavor that follows. The hops are mostly citric, but have a bit of a pine flavor. It's nice and bitter. They're not at all affected by the malts. It remains bitter overall, but is somewhat close to being a well balanced IPA. There's some yeasty/biscuity notes on the tail that linger into the aftertaste. Alcohol is blended very well and is not noticeable. It finishes bitter and a little dry.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It features a medium body and is smooth overall. Carbonation is nice and crisp. Not exactly a creamy feel, but good nonetheless. Drinkability is very high. It goes down very easy, has a lot of flavor, and an abv that doesn't scare you away. I could take down a few of these easily.  Torpedo's an impressive beer. I'm intrigued by the ""Extra IPA"" label. Is there really such a thing? This one probably falls into the good ol' IPA category if you ask me. There really isn't anything about that ventures out of that territory. Whatever you want to call it, it's very good beer. I like it quite a bit. The nose could use a little more strength, but that's about the only minor complaint I have. Very solid beer otherwise. Check it out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,HalfFull,3.95,"Pours a clear golden orange into a Sam Adams glass with an inch or so of puffy off white head. Offers decent retention and random bits of lacing.  Hops on the nose are present but cloaked a bit by a light orange sweetness, which diminishes as the head settles. Then revealing a deep wet earthy hop nose and notes of lightly roasted malt, along with some hop spice notes.  Taste follows as expected given the color and the nose. Very smooth initially and with a subtle carbonation, piney on the swallow and then a rush of orange citrus on the finish. A touch of lingering bitterness concludes. Offers good drinkability as the moderate sweetness hides the alcohol and most of the bitterness. The same citric factors hide the nuances a bit yet create their own, making this a good but not quite remarkable IPA that offers a different character than their Harvest series.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,porterboy57,3.9,"A- Nice clean golden copper color , with a half inch of lather on top which laced very nicely.  S- Noticeable citrus, pine, and hoppy nose. With a malty back- ground  T- This is the area I was a little disappointed in. The citrus, pine, and hops come through, but the malt is very faint.  M- The faint malt flavor leave it feel a little empty to me.  D- This is a very drinkable IPA.  Overall an above average IPA, that is not a bad value compared to a lot of DIPAs. Although I would say it is more like a very hoppy single IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hiikeeba,4.45,"A - Pours up an golden amber with a dense white head that lasts and lasts.  S - Big fresh hop aroma.  T - Some malt flavor detected, but quickly replaced with a smooth hop bitterness that lingers, but doesn't linger.  M - Good mouthfeel.  D - This is good for several pints. I think this is better than their flagship IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,GregPearson33,4.66,"A - Poured dark amber/golden with a small, lasting head. Lacing was terrific. T - Hoppy and delicious! The IBUs were right on with this one and its strong IPA (IIPA?) personality more than covered the considerable ABV. Very satisfying D - Put this down pretty easily, could definitely grab another.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,dakid618,4.27,"Poured from 12oz bottle in pint glass. Pours a deep golden amber color with a half finger of fizzy head that leaves gobs of lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is all citrus, grapefruit mostly. This is a hoppy beer, but seems to have balance. Citrus hops upfront that blend into a pine backbone with a biscuity aftertaste that shows up several seconds after I swallow the drink. Medium bodied dry mouthfeel that leaves my tongue dry and piney, in a good way. Very drinkable. I see myself purchasing this very often.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,goatgoat,3.35,"Clear brassy gold. A two finger white head falls quickly to a thin cap. Moderate amounts of sticky lace. Aroma is smack yourself hops. Citrus, some pineapple. Some sweetness, honey. Taste is all hops. Big huge hops and lots of bitterness. No noticeable malt. A good chunk of harshness to the bitterness. Light body with lots of carbonation.  A decent but not overly enjoyable IPA for me. It has a sort of harshness I've come to expect from Sierra Nevada. Just not a fan.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Stinkypuss,3.7,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Light hazy golden brown in color with a soapy head and some lace.  Smells of bready malt and some spicy hops.  The taste grows on me particularly. At first, just strong hop bitters, but as I delve into it further, orange peel notes, grapefruit juices, light malt backing tries to peek through, then the hops squash it.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Interesting attributes to this brew. Spritzy and a bit spicey on the palate.  Drinkability is solid, this is a nice new yearly addition from SN.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DIM,3.98,"a: This was a clear, bright golden coppery color. It poured with a huge, sticky, craggy white head.  s: Fresh hoppy aromas of pine with lemon zest and a little generic, abrasive bitterness. Sweet balance from caramel maltiness.  t: Very flavorful, yet balanced at the same time. Big piny, citric, somewhat solventy hops backed caramel sweetness.  m: Long lasting, fizzy carbonation and a slick body.  d: Very good overall, but there was an unrefined roughness here that suprised me coming from SN. Still, this is a delicious and very hoppy bargain.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,GRPunk,3.68,"Bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A- It poured with a 1-finger, off-white head atop a ruby red body. It's pretty clean with heavy-medium carbonation. The head fell to a full lace that left nice sticky rings on the glass.  S- The aroma is initially hop forward. It's a nice mix of pine and citrus. Further inspection leads the nose to a nice malt backbone, which comes off with a sweet, caramel scent.  T- The hops are quite pronounced and earthy. I pick up a lot of pine and grassy notes. The flavor isn't nearly as balanced as the aroma would suggest. There's a faint flavor of caramel malts, but they're pushed to the background.  M- The hops play all sorts of games in your mouth. It starts with a nice bite. A dry finish leaves the tongue nearly paralyzed until the next sip. Very interesting.  D- It's not a bad drinker. It straddles the line between a traditional IPA and a double. I'd say it's closer to an extra-hoppy traditional, American IPA. The lesser balance takes a little bit from the drinkability.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,snaotheus,4.38,"Clear ruby-gold in color, pours with a fluffy head, crazy lacing. Smells very piney.  Taste, of course, is very piney. Very good hoppy aftertaste, bitterness is balanced nicely against...some kind of splash of sweetness when it hits your tongue.  Feels light but clingy on my tongue. Very drinkable, for someone who can handle the hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TheManiacalOne,4.6,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.  A: The beer is a deep golden brown color, with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is a good blend of fruity citrus, grassy hops and caramelized malts.  T: The taste starts out with a strong burst of floral hops bitterness and fruity citrus sweetness. Both flavors remain dominant the whole time you're drinking the beer. There's a hearty malt character and a background flavor of caramel. The after-taste is likewise slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.  M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.  D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is definitely an excellent beer with a lot of flavor and substance that is worth drinking for a whole evening.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,AgingWarrior,4.25,"Pours a nice looking dark golden color into my Duvel tulip glass. The pour produces a nice foamy two finger head that has nice retention and provides some excellent lacing.  Smells like floral hops and citrus fruits. The smell is intoxicating and I want to gulp it right away. Behind the hops is a hint of caramel.  The first sip hits the tongue and it's total hoppiness. Midway through the drink the malt kicks in adding balance, then the finish is hoppy fresh.  Light body, medium carbonation. Just a touch on the thin side, but a nice feel washing over the tongue and down the throat.  I've had three of these previously. Tonight I drank one and then followed it up with another. I'd like to drink yet another, but I'm all out. Very drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,soccerman7,3.88,"Poured into a Palm snifter. Nice head that quickly disappeared. Left a ring on the glass with minimal lacing. Sweet aroma of citrus and pine come up with a faint honey note. While not the hop fest I was hoping for, it has a bite and is very well balanced. while less hoppy as Celebration, the malt sweetness is perfect with it. Very smooth, with the faint pleasing dryness of the hops lingering. A very fine IPA from SN, with a great balance.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,yesyouam,4.03,"Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA is a very clear light amber ale with a creamy off-white head that has great longevity and leaves great lacing. The aroma is heavy with notes of pine and grapefruit. I would expect no less from Sierra Nevada. There is a light smell of caramel-- probably crystal malt. It has a lively medium body that's pretty dry all the way to the finish. It tastes like it smells, pretty much. It's quite bitter and well balanced. The 7.2% ABV isn't detectable at all, so watch out if you feel like pounding these, folks. This kind of reminds me of their Celebration Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,br3wmeister,3.7,"A- Light golden orange in color with a nice big off white head that held to the bottom of the glass and left great lacing.  S- Lots of pine, floral and citrus aromas, some grapefruit and lemons in there. A little caramel sweetness comes through and a hint of white cake.  T- This is a very dry bitter beer, not much malt to balance the hops at all. Some pine and citrus flavors that give it a light fruitiness in the middle but in the end it drys out and becomes quite bitter.  M- Dry bitter bite. Well carbonated.  Overall- This beer is completely unbalanced. If you are looking for dry bitter hops this is where its at... if you like something with a bit more character this is not the beer for you.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BuffaloTapHugger,4.05,"Poured 12 oz bottle into my favorite pint glass. Its a dark reddish hue of a tint in color, foggy with no see through. Smells of whole-cone hops, what did you expect? Not too much of the aromatics are coming out tonight, killer lacing and head. Taste is of bitter, piny hops, perfectly carbonated to enhance. Medium bodied, little thick, sticky, bitter on the withdraw that lingers. Very drinkable for the hopheads, all others may want to reconsider. This is my favorite SN brew bar none.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jdubjacket,3.78,"Poured this after a LONG ASS DAY at work. Pours a nice orange color. Not a whole lot of head or lacing on the glass. Lot of hops in the nose. Traces of juniper. Bitter up front on the taste and becomes citrusy, hoppy, with traces of alcohol. Very bitter aftertaste. Moderate carbonation in the mouthfeel. Good flavor and good drinkability. I would buy this again for more of a session IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BARFLYB,4.2,"12oz bottle poured into a Philadelphia Flyers pint glass. It's good to see another year round beer from SN.  A- SN Torpedo has a color a bit brighter than copper, perhaps bronze to a burnt golden color. A sturdy pour produced a 1/2 inch dismal white head that faded quickly. A thin sheet of bubbles were left on the top as well as minimal lacing.  S- Torpedo smells like something from the left coast for sure. A bunch of American hops and a good malt base which you would expect. This gives of citrus & earthy scents with sweetness from the malts. Some bready characteristics as well. Hops are the dominate force.  T- Torpedo hits its target with a blow of west coast hop goodness. Not the biggest assult of hops but a good enough profile for a year round brew. They give off the usual grapefruit and pine taste which is evenly split. After the initial strike Torpedo lowers its arms and gives off a good maltiness for the injured tastebuds with a slight caramel sweetness. This is a well executed IPA.  M- A bit thicker on the mouth than I expected But this is fairly medium bodied with a good amount of carb felt on the tounge. A nice amount of bittering power but nothing over the top. A smooth IPA with the hop cones lingering well after I am finished. Well balanced with no alcohol distractions.  D- This one is year round to my knowledge so I think I found a new IPA for the rotation. I would gladly drink this at anytime. I could probably finish 3-4 bottles over an evening without killing my palette. Not a hop bomb but a damn smooth American IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,caskstrength,3.5,"Really wanted to love this. Celebration is an old time fav, was hoping for a year round offering with more hops and more bite.  nice amber pour. average aroma. waiting for a hop bite with flavor beyond the celebration ale level for this ""extra IPA""...nope.  a nice introductory IPA. A great beer to give to a buddy trying to move into the craft beer movement.  I was hoping for a lot more and was let down. Which means I'm not buying this unless there's nothing else good available. And these days, usually there is something else good available.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,roan22,4.36,"this beer pours an amber color, and there is a bit of nice lacing. The aroma is quite great..very fresh hops in a sharp grapefruit and pine sense..also a buttery caramel note.  Taste is great..is it mindblowing..no, but very close to it. What I would expect from a California IPA. It is very fresh and very sharp on the tongue which I like. The booziness is there a little bit but it is not as extreme as other similar IPAs.  Nothing really smooth or balanced about this ale which impresses me but I am a hophead so I appreciate this quality, if not outright require it.  Mouthfeel is tingly and I like it. I am pretty sure I like this Torpedo Extra version better than the regular SN Harvest Ale, Anniversary Ale, and maybe even better than this years' earlier SN one-off, Chico Estate. But Celebration still is tops to me overall.  Drinkabiliity also ranks high, especially when eating chocolate.

Aroma is nice and hoppy. Citrus and pine.  Huge blast of hops on the tongue, mostly grapefruit. The caramel malt base is there, but the hops quickly remind you that they're running this show. Nice pine bitterness in the finish to go with the citrus.  The carbonation in this is quite tingly, but not overdone. Very crisp. This one is very drinkable. The alcohol is undetectable. This is a very solid offering from Sierra Nevada. I don't think I like it as much as Celebration, but it's damn close.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,biker30x,4.15,"Poured from a bottle into a pint absolutely crystal clear and golden orange with a full off-white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a sticky lace throughout. Faint nose of pine and citrus. Sharp and hoppy on the tongue but not a brutal hop-bomb. The spicy bite of pine resin is balanced beautifully by burnt caramel and grapefruit sweetness of the malt with a suggestion of bready yeast. Surprisingly thick on the tongue and a finish that trends towards sweet rather than sharp. Seems to be designed to be a huge IPA for the masses, the result is a nearly perfectly balanced hoppy beer that is extremely drinkable. Gives the other IPAs a run for their money and is priced well to boot.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smells like a good West Coast IPA.  Taste of grassy hops, earth, spices, caramel, and malts. More malts and less hops than I had hoped for, but a good IPA nonetheless.  Mouthfeel is light bodied and slick, not bad but slightly thin.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: Love the nose on this one! Was expecting a typical citrus hoppy aroma, but instead it was a more roasted/toasted & earthy. Then the nose finishes with sweet red berries.  T: Hoppy up-front pine flavors, some spice but very well balanced with the toasted malty flavor. They did a great job of fitting this in a category somewhere between a regular IPA & a Double IPA. Hardly an alcohol presence considering its at 7.2 ABV.  M: a light-medium body. Creamy yet still carbonated.  D: Drinks easier than expected. Wasn't expecting a ""Extra IPA"" to be this smooth.

Torpedo is a very beautiful beer. Smells very good though not beyond what one would expect of an IPA: strong hops upfront, very citrusy and piney, with sweet malts detectable in the background. Tastes like it smells, with a long, resinous finish that is strong but not to the point of making you cringe. This is a terrific beer.

Citrus and herbal hop notes on the nose with just the slightest sweetness deep in the aroma. Tastes of herbs, florals that glide smoothly over the tongue, lightly coating the palate. The beer doesn't leave the massive amounts of residue featured in DIPAs, but it's still pleasant. There's a brief sweetness at the front of the sip, rounded out by that pine/forest flavor. In general, the taste is very well balanced. Mouthfeel is my favorite part about this beer. Medium bodied and medium carbonation and smooth as hell. This beer goes down so easily that I polished off the 12oz in mere minutes. An exceptionally drinkable beer, with the alcohol creeping up on you only at the very end.

So SN is quite dear to my heart. Ask any of my close friends: Sierra Nevada posters don my walls in my dorm room. But despite my affinity for SN, I always thought of them as a solid brewery with a great lineup, but never a powerhouse when it came to top-of-the-line brews. I think Stone Brewing can make an A+ beer, but Sierra Nevada will do A-'s and straight A's.  Well boy, was I wrong when it came to Torpedo. Pours out a rich gold, dark brown. Very carbonated. Very attractive thick head. Smells of floral hops immediately, but also has some wood-pine-like smells. Very odd. It wasn't straight Cascade, Chinook, and Centennial. The taste is fantastic. Great floral flavors, but again, there is a very earthy tone in the background so the grapefruit tart doesn't get out of hand. Perfect balance. Great hoppy taste, without an assault on your taste buds.  This is truly a top-of-the-line beer.

It is solid beer and it goes well as a essential beer for the fridge to always have a few of, much like SN Pale Ale.  It has a strong hoppy profile and the taste to match. Definitely has a bit more bite than I typically expect from SN (Bigfoot excluded), but there is nothing overpowering about this beer. It is extremely tasty and very drinkable.

Good IPA colors and a respectable head that is slightly sticky and ok retention.  The nose is light on the hop side for my taste but that doesn't mean it fails to deliver a respectable hop showing. Lightly floral and more earthy then citrus. There is also a fine musty grain nose in the background.  Taste is also on the light side for my taste. There is a brilliant earthy bitterness that is instantly discernible. Followed by a muted citrus pine hop taste. Overall the hops taste more floral then anything else.  A mild carbonation makes this beer a delight to drink. Not to punchy on the bitterness and not to heavy or syrupy like some IPA's can get. A good all around decent beer. The floral scent and tastes makes me thing of this as a hippy IPA. Very earthy and concerned about the environment. Tasty beer but SN should cut their long hippy hair and add more hops to this one.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hopman333,4.72,"Could not wait to try this. And it does not dissapoint to say the least....  Upon the initial pour there is a nice beige head however no lacing, no big deal...  The smell is absolutely awesome to say the least. A very fresh herbal / pine smell that seem's to develop a fruitiness toward's the end of the sniff, very much like fresh strawberries...  The taste is a seamless blend of malt and hop's, it start's off with a very fruity / caramel malt flavor that is in perfect harmony with one another. The bitterness is present however not to the point of burning you're taste bud's. A definate hop bomb but in a subtle way, not a bad thing at all. I think it's great, and really does not mimmick any any other IPA's out there, in a class of it's own... What else would you expect from Sierra Nevada. Almost forgot to mention that the carbonation level is spot on, very crisp but also very creamy, perfect.  In a world with a plethora of IPA's to choose from, this is a definate winner in my book. This will definately be in rotation in my fridge.  Just wanted to list an update, the more I have been drinking this the better it get's. It is becoming a favorite amongst the other IPA's that I drink...  Would also like to kind of update my lacing report's as the first 6er I had, ( maybe the glass, I don't know ) did not leave any signifigant lacing, however it now leave's quite a bit, very nice. Very rich and very satisfying to say the least. I love this brew....",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A = Orange liquid with soft off white foam head interspersed with medium bubbles, lots of small carbonation bubbles, medium lacing.  S = Grapefruit zest, pineapple, fresh breakfast biscuits show up in the background.  T = Quite a bit of bitterness from the tip of the tongue on back with no real balancing sweetness or body until the very back of the tongue. The taste of citrus rinds abounds - lemon and grapefruit mostly but a hint of orange as well. Long dry finish. This is a pretty simple beer and I was hoping for more complexity. Really seems to be little more than a delivery system for bitterness. Though I expect and like my IPAs to have that strong hops bitterness and flavor, this is just too one note. It is far from the most bitter IPA you will ever have, but there just seems little else other than the bitterness to add interest.  M = Medium-light body, fair mouthcoating, stings the tongue a bit though.  D = Certainly a drinkable beer but just not interesting enough to make me want much more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Color is a deep golden hue, very close to SNPA.  S - Hugely piney, touching on citrusy and grassy.  T - A different take on an IPA, touching on IIPA...Extra IPA, I guess it fits.  M - Typical. Nothing extraordinary.  D - I found this very drinkable considering the category. After a while, the piney hop taste went away, and I wanted more. Much more.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,RonfromJersey,4.5,"Hazy orange/copper body, little in carbonation streams, topped by three fingers plus of fluffy sticky white bubbles.  Assertive juicy citrus aroma, backed by pine.  A solid stream of malt flows directly up the center of the tongue, paintng a guideline for juicy citrus as it engulfs the mouth. Drys after the swallow.  Firm solid mouthfeel. Wonderfully drinkable.  It won't replace Celebration, but the wait will be a bit easier now.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,COBeerBuff,3.93,"Appearance: Pours a beautiful reddish amber with tons of bubbles and a decent white head that doesn't linger too long.  Smell: First smell to hit the nostrils is hops. Not quite as strong as I was expecting. People told me this was a hop-bomb, and the hops are present, but there are also citrusy and piney (edit: very piney) notes that mellow the smell of hops somewhat.  Taste: Smooth. The hops become almost an afterthought. An implosion of pine and citrus. It reminds me of the juniper bushes in front of my old house. Slightly bitter towards the end, but rounding out to a maltier finish than expected.  Mouthfeel: Lighter than I was looking forward to. This strikes me as less ""Extra"" and more ""regular"" IPA-ish.  Drinkability: This could be a solid session beer for me. I know anything over 6% ABV is supposed to be non-session-able, but this is a very smooth IPA. I had to review my second beer because my girlfriend distracted me during the first, and by the time I looked down, it was gone.  I was stoked about the Torpedo Extra IPA. I kept asking when it was going to make it Kansas, and I'm glad it did. It was quite the hop-tacular that I was expecting, but there are enough of those to go around. I'm glad this is going to be a year-round offering because it's a solid IPA that I could see myself falling back on whenever there's not something special in my fridge, and I could be perfectly okay with that.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Color is clear orange/amber. Lazy carbonation activity.  Smell is mildly citrus and fruity. Taste is solid grapefruit and orange juices and finishes with a rind tartness. Malt isn't really detected.  Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Finishes with a tart puckering aftertaste. Very enjoyable, and the ABV is not felt. This is a really good IPA, and I'm glad it will be available year round.

140,30420,jkrich,3.58,"12 oz. bottle poured into pint glass. The pour was deep, clear copper color with minimal head but plenty of lacing.  This one screams hoppy pines and very little else. This was certainly indicative of the taste to come.  The first sip brought forth an abrasive flavor of hops that lingered uncomfortably on the roof and tongue of the mouth; very little balance here. I was about ready to dismiss this one as a hop bomb out of control. However, if you let the ale warm a little, there is a little malt flavor and overall mellowness that does give a little balance.  A good amount of carbonation and medium bodied mouthfeel, after it warms some and settles down.  Not my favorite offering from this brewery, though it is certainly worth trying if you enjoy strong northwest hopped ales. The initial taste was harsh, but it did improve.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,kels,3.73,"Heard this was best a little warmer, so I left it out of the fridge for about 30 minutes before pouring into a pint.  Appearance: Lovely golden and ruby tones in clear liquid with little visible combination. Rocky 3 finger light tan head leaves behind tremendous sticky lacing and retains at about 1/2 a finger.  Smell: Not as overpowering as I expected from an ""extreme"" IPA. Very nice mild balance of grainy malt and citrus and floral hops.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Feel is surprisingly creamy and wet and fades immediately to a clean vapor after the beer is swallowed. The alcohol taste is very present in the aftertaste. Piney and citrus characters come through very presently with a crisp toasty malt. Very pungent, astringent bitterness with a clean aftertaste.  Drinkability: Moderate - would definitely need to pair this with food to keep going.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,roscoehnj,4,"Nice golden amber with moderate head and decent lacing. Carbonation is visible in the tulip glass.  Bigger on the pine than the citrus, both of which I was led to expect by the label. A little more citrus and fruit would be nice.  Taste hits me with a nice dose of hop bitterness as well as a little more of a sweet malt backbone than I would have expected.  Mouthfeel leaves me wanting more. A little thin and I can't help comparing it to the creamier and fuller Celebration. Quite drinkable - it will be no problem having a few of these.  I liked this beer quite a bit and will no doubt be drinking it regularly. However, again I can't help thinking I would rather they make Celebration available year round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A: A little more malty than what I was expecting. Nice cascade hop aroma, lemon, and grapefruit.  T: The first sip was just out of the fridge and nothing to write home about. But as the beer warms, the hops start to come out. I get nice citrus, grass, and orange peel. The crystal malt gives this one nice balance.  M: Smooth, medium body. very little carbonation, but leaves a bitter sting at the back end.  D: Nice. I like this beer, not world class by any means, but a good offering. 7.2% is just about right, but this is not on par with some of the great IPA's of the world.

140,30420,tittymcj,3.85,"This one poured out a crisp, clear brownish red, with hints of orange around the edges where the light penetrated most. Thin head with very good, intricate lacing.  The smell is mainly of orange and other citrus, but there is also some light dough profile from the malt in the back.  The taste is primarily the malty dough flavor for me. There is a definite hop bitterness, and they compliment each other nicely. The hop bite is definite, but a little short.  Mouthfeel is good, medium body but very easy to move around. Leaves a bit of a spicy tingle in the mouth and throat.  This one had a 5 on drinkability before I took multiple more sips, and it ended up at a 4 because of the slight heavy profile of the malt.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,dreadnatty08,3.78,"Pours a medium amber, bright copper color with a dense, rocky off-white head. Beautiful tracing covers the side of the glass; clarity is excellent. Aromas are extremely herbaceous and spicy with black pepper and orange dominating followed by some spicy alcohol. A real citrus zing is not to be found in this beer. On the palate, the first thing that hits me is the huge mouthfeel for an IPA. It is extremely full bodied and has a solid malty background. The hops, however, just aren't as huge as I'd like them to be. It's plenty bitter, but the presence and flavor is really lacking; nowhere near as good as Celebration. Worth a shot, and is well priced, but I'd like the see the afformentioned produced year-round over this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Big juicy grapefruit nose. A soft pine note seems to follow. Lots of hop aroma, along with some faint caramel.  Good malt character, followed by lots of juicy hops. Not as dry as some of the other SN beers, which makes this one stand out for me. Fruity, citrusy, with a piney edge. Still, well balanced.  Medium body, alcohol hidden very well. Very easy to drink. Very enjoyable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Reaper16,3.76,"served from a 12oz. bottle into a 2009 Boulevard Smokestack Series goblet  Pours a see-through shade of iced tea with a one-finger sized head. The creamy, eggshell head takes forever to dissipate, and leaves some admirably sticky lacing.  Not much going on in the aroma department. Its more earthy than I expected, some piny astringent notes. Overall its kiind of like SNPA, surprisingly.  Whatever the torpedo device does, it sure can harness the power of hops. This is a damn bitter IPA. I love bitterness, but I think that the astringency is actually masking some of the hop flavors. I'm not getting nearly the amount of citrus flavor that I was expecting from this beer. The initial sips seem pretty balanced; there is a developed bready malt taste after the swallow. As it warms, I can make out the light touches of mango. The mango reminds me of Bell's Hopslam, only Torpedo is nowhere near the fruit-storm that Hopslam is. I can taste the alcohol. Malt flavors start to become less distinct as the bitterness builds up on the back of the tongue.  I'm a fan of the mouthfeel. Its easy to swish around and swallow, but retains some incremental degree of heft (not a thickness, but not what you'd call thin, either). If I could taste the alcohol a little bit less, then this would be a tremendously drinkable IPA. I do enjoy the drying aspect of the finish.  At the price point, this makes for a nice choice to spend an evening with. It isn't close to my favorite IPA, in fact I'd say that it didn't live up to my expectations. Its no Celebration Ale. What it is, however, is a darn drinkable beer for being a bitterness-bomb.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BgThang,3.94,"What can I sa? Another fine brew by Sierra Nvada. This beer is a very good IPA that has alot going or it.  the nose is that of lemon, pine, and other citrus flavors one expects to find in a west coast IPA but they are subtle.  the appearance is a little cloudy with some deeper copper hues in it.  the mouthfeel is a real easy drinking ipa that has a little hoppiness . This reminds me alot of the southern star PA",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TheDoorman,3.8,"Pours a transparent amber with a nice creamy head. Aroma is clearly a blend of floral, citric and earthy hops. More earthy than most west coast IPAs. Quite pleasant. Taste follows the nose. Hops are tasty. Bready, biscuity. Citrus is surprisingly absent. Light, creamy, oily and astringent. A nice IPA, but nothing memorable. A moderate dissapointment given the hype behind this brew. It's really much closer to an IPA rather than a IIPA. Still, a very nice IPA, but the style is just tough to thrive in with all the competition.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,whoneeds8,4.45,"Pours out golden amber with a very nice white head that lasts all the way down. Very nice lacing. Smell is very floral and sweet.

140,30420,a10t2,4.18,"A: Crystal clear light amber. One-finger white head falls quickly but doesn't quite disappear. PHENOMENAL lacing.  S: Hoppy, with a good balance between floral and citrusy aromas.  T: Hops are again the focus, but there's a little sweetness for balance - more than the usual AIPA. The hop flavors are floral with some spicy/resinous aftertaste and little of the citrus from the aroma.  M: Maybe a little too much carbonation, but that helps to balance out the relatively heavy finish. Just a hint of alcohol warmth.  D: Very well balanced, especially for being at the high end of the style. Good to see something other than the C-hops dominating in a Sierra Nevada product.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,itcomesnpints,3.51,"A great looking IPA with its characteristic gold/orange hues and translucence. Lots of clinging lace.  For all of the dry-hopping advertised, the smell is too weak. C hops are certainly there, but not in full force (what i'd prefer).  The taste is distinctively bitter, much more so than most IPAs i've had. Caramel maltiness is also there. The admirably strong bitterness unfortunately masks many of the citrus notes that I love about IPAs.  Mouthfeel is VERY DRY. Alcohol could be hidden better as well.  Directly out of the fridge this is not easy to drink. The only sensations that come through are bitterness and dryness. However, as it warms, more hop character appears.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Hoppy, pleasantly bitter with just enough behind it to not be overwhelmed by the hops.  M - Slick and medium bodied in the mouth, again with enough substance to make this a better beer than some of the super hoppy beers out there that are very light bodied.  D - Very easy drinking, I could certainly see a night full of these with no side effects other than a lighter wallet.  In all, this is my new favorite IPA and the SN beer I've been looking for.

Overall, the balance tips toward the hops, perhaps a bit too much, as the beer finishes with an unpleasant over-hoppy bitter pucker.  M-Moderately carbonated, appropriately medium-bodied.

140,30420,EPseja,2.68,"Thanks to BA yelterdow for the hook up on this one.  Served from a 12oz bottle in a SABL glass at just above fridge temperature.  A - Standard Sierra Nevada crystal clear amber-orange with a nice, 1-inch thick off-white head that hangs out for a good minute or two before diminishing to a bubbly film on top of the surface. Lacing comes in sticky, translucent sheets.  S - Big, honey-malt laden west coast hops. More piney than citrusy. Fresh and crisp, with a verdant moistness. Nothing too revolutionary about this nose.  T - Subdued honey-laced malts that fall short of being sweet before the alpha-acid army comes blasting through in the middle and then loiters on the smoldering, twisted and burnt nubs of your taste buds all the way through the grippingly drying swallow. The aftertaste is forcefully astringent; very powdery and green. Like chewing on an aged grapefruit rind. Balance can only be viewed as a hop brick residing on a broken see-saw.  M - Nicely tingling on the tongue, and puffing up to become mouth-filling and frothy. Swallow is creamy and satisfying when the taste isn't factored in.  D - No matter what I do, and no matter what ""it's all about the hops"" frame of mind I get into that helps me try and cope, I can't get past the rough aftertaste that makes my throat feel like closing up. Once the first swallow goes down, the wicked aftertaste dominates almost every other aspect of this beer from the nose onward. Tasty? Yes, if you're looking for a hop bomb. Balanced? No. Will I be buying this beer for myself? No. There are just too many other APAs out there that are truly enjoyable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TomGavin,3.48,"12oz. bottle. Fresh batch--just arrived on Wednesday 2-25-09.  A: Pours reddish-gold-orange with a vanilla bean white head that builds into two inches before receding quickly down to an 1/8th of an inch. Some lacing, but nothing serious. If I spin the liquid, it clings for a few seconds before sliding.  S: More malt than hops, which is a bit strange for an ""Extra IPA."" Beyond the dusty, sweet malt notes--a touch of honey--are varying degrees of citrus, mainly orange, some lemon. If you inhale deeply--and I mean very deeply--you'll find tropical fruit and a touch of pepper.  M: Lighter body with strangely assertive carbonation. A prickling sensation.  T: Sweet melon-like malt sweetness before the hops completely extinguish any trace of malt. Quickly bitter, but not much else. No citrus, barely sweet, just a flash of hop bitterness that remains on the on the back of the tongue--yes, I know, that's where bitterness is sensed--in a displeasing manner.  D: A serious plus to this beer is its drinkability. For a 7%+ beer, this is very drinkable.  Comment: Very affordable, but for a few extra bucks you can get your hands on a better made beer.

Tons of raw hop taste.  M: Medium body with a touch of sticky.  D: This is the worst bottle I had in the 6 pack and it was still decent. For the price this is a great buy.

There is a bitterness that is pretty strong, balanced out by its smoothness. It is full-bodied, rich with hops and a nice malt flavor with a hint of sweetness. The flavor lingers, where the bitterness really hits the back and sides of the tongue. I would call the mouthfeel about medium, and carbonation is strong.

140,30420,cthulu81,4.3,"Ahhh, finally a year-round IPA from one of the godfathers of craft beer. My only hope is that this beer will be as prevalent in hoo-hum sports bars as SNPA currently is. I know it won't happen for awhile, as Sierra doesn't want to cannabalize its pale ale draft lines, but it is inevitable. Basically this is the new go-to beer from Sierra. Sure I would love to call thier wet-hop harvest the go-to beer, but let's face it, wet-hop beers are meant to be drunk when fresh. Ummm, I mean, drank in staggering quantities when fresh because there is only a pitifully small window of time for you to enjoy thier knee-weakening deliciousness. Damn, I need to get back on track here. Torpedo. There we go. If you are looking for a description, basically take that brash, West Coast hop finger print that defines a beer from Sierra and crank that puppy up to 11!

These guys invented the wheel way back when with the pale ale, and now they have given us newbie hop-heads a brand new round thingie to roll around and play with. Cheers and please send some Chico Estate Harvest this way come Fall. Pretty please?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,edchicma,4.42,"Pours a deep copper yellow with a nice head that remains, although in reduced form. Lacing is decent. Smell...am I in a hops field? Excellent hop aroma..inviting with floral, wheaty qualities that are very strong and pleasing on the nostrils. I was expecting a harsher assault on the taste buds, However, this eases into an excellent hops explosion, just enough initial malt serving as a springboard. Mouthfeel after the initial malt is dry, desert-like...nice quality. Just the right infusion of hops. The lingering taste and dryness remain, rewarding you for taking the first sip.

140,30420,GbVDave,4.12,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a 20oz imperial pint.  A: Pours a clear, coppery-hue, with a bubbly, light-orange, two-finger thick head of foam. The head sports decent retention and contributes to a really pretty display of lacey layers.  S: Initial hoppy waft is of grapefruit. This is followed closely by pine, red apple, caramel, apricot, white grape, honey, and toasted malt. The hops eventually take on a definite spicy and/or herbal quality, as well.  T: Really big piney flavors dominate. Fresh-cut pine bough, fresh-squeezed pine cone...you name it, it's in there. Juicy grapefruit, caramel, apple, spiced honey, herbal hops, white pepper, and toasted malt.  M: Really juicy at first. Becomes much drier and spicier as time wears on. Finally finishes with a nice balance between juicy & sticky and dry & spicy.  D: Very nice. Lately I've found myself reaquainting myself with Sierra Nevada, one of my original ""gateway"" breweries from the early 90's. I've been pleasantly surprised with all the new product they've rolled out, as of late.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Nice solid spotty lace noted.  S: Nice hop bomb. Bold blast of rich piney hops. Solid sweet malt backs this one with a blast of citrus as well.  T: Same as the nose. Wonderful rich sweet malt to cut through bold resinous pine with notes of citrus.  M: Medium in body, great carbonation with a dry finish.  D: Tasty, drinkable, and easy on the pocket what more can you ask for?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,John_M,4.23,"The beer pours the typicial SNPA copper color, but with considerably better head retention and lacing. Lot's of sticky lacing all around in this one. On the nose, you can tell right off this is going to be a seriously hoppy IPA. There is pepper, a touch of pine and bitter citrus, which comes across as pretty dry. The flavors on the palate replicate the nose, except I confess I was completely unprepared for the amount of hoppy bitterness in this one. Wow. The beer starts off with some malty sweetness, but the sweetness is quickly buried in an avalanche of hoppy, dry, spicey bitterness. There is a huge hoppy presence in this beer, and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the abv. is very well disguised.  This is an impressive IPA from SN and is clearly not for the faint of heart. This is a very big, very impressive, very hoppy IPA. Yummy!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hoplover82,4.16,"A-Pours a beautiful clear deep golden color with a hint of amber. The head pours huge at first then settles to a nice 1/4 inch film on the beer, (great retention) and leaves very thick sticky lace. A sight for sore eyes indeed.  S-Very floral and citrus up front, a little piney, and as it warms, the hops really do become tropical fruitish. Like mango and orange. Not overrated in the least. Some malt in the back. Mainly pale malts, not so much caramel.  T-The flavor has a solid bitterness with tropical fruity hoppy goodness. Cirtus hops bursts on my tongue with each sip. Lots of pale malts in the back. Hops are the star in this show though.  M-Very crisp yet creamy,and almost full bodied. Slightly dry in the end, which is a good thing).  D-Very drinkable, I could almost session these, (almost).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,UnionMade,4.18,"Pours a brilliant, deep copper color, with a dense, frothy head that lasts and lasts. Sheets of lace cling to the glass. The aroma is very assertively hopped. Resinous pine and grapefruit, with an undertone of toasty malt. Very clean. The flavor opens sharply and immediately with hops. Just shy of being unbalanced, this one starts and finishes with dense hop flavor. Fairly full bodied, with moderate carbonation that carries the beer well. A light undercarriage of toasty, grainy pale malts provides some sweetness, but really this one is a study in american hops. Very citric and resinous, with a distinct pine bite. Very clean, with just a hint of pear fruitiness.

140,30420,homebrewhawk,4.12,"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a slightly hazy dark gold with a thin white head. Piney, resiny hop aroma that is different than Celebration. Some sweet caramel malt comes out as it warms. Bracing hit of hops initially. Nice base of malt sweetness to balance it out. Fairly carbonated. Is Sierra still bottle conditioned? I didn't see yeast. Long dry, mouth puckering hop finish. This is pretty drinkable for the ABV. You could get in trouble with this!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,HardTarget,4.05,"A) Deep copper amber color shows exceptional clarity and holds a thin head and rough collar of foam that leaves fingers of lace down the glass.  S) I believe those are called ""hops"". Profile is like Celebration Ale with west coast pine being the major aroma. Some sugary base there too.  T) Matches style nicely, big hop presence but a big malty backbone so it doesn't get super bitter. Taste is pretty clean and tastes a lot like a cross between Bigfoot and Celebration.  M) Heavy body gives a lip smacking chew, oily, sticky finish. Carbonation level is a touch high for my tastes.  D) Easy, too easy at this abv. Good stuff and a nice beer to have in the IPA rotation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jasonjlewis,4.13,"2 finger head, very nice retention. Ruby color.  The smell could be stronger, but it's very nice; It's not weak, but it's not blow my socks off. The lemon character of the magnums with the pungent crystal hops mix nicely with the mango undertone of the citra.  Taste has an assertive, but clean hop bitterness with a bit of hop flavor. There is a bit of underlying malt sweetness to balance so the beer isn't too thin and dried out.  Crisp with some malt sweetness.  This could be a go to IPA when I run out of hoppy homebrew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,morimech,4.03,Pours a clear amber color with two-fingers of white head that has good retention. Plenty of sticky lacing is left behind. The aroma consists of pine and citrus hops. The flavor is also dominated by the hops. Both citrus and pine flavors vie for top spot. Some earthiness is also detected. The malt lends just a touch of sweetness. Bitterness is moderate for an American IPA. No sense of alcohol. Has a nice texture but maybe a touch overcarbonated. Not much but there is a harshness at the finish. A nice American IPA at a good value price. The high ABV was a bit of a surprise so drinkability is lowered a bit.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Packforever1976,4.15,"Served chilled in my British pint.  A: Pours a clear medium amber. A smallish off-white head recedes to a covering of the beer. Sticky lacing.  S: Nose is dominated by hops. A big blast of citrus and pine, with some earthy hop flavor following. Enough biscuity-malts to balance things out.  T: Nice and bitter. Grapefruit, pine. Some lemon. A nice sweetness from the malts in the back. A nice bitter aftertaste.  M: Thickness is ok, but the carbonation seems a little high. If it was toned down maybe 25-30% it would be alot better.  D: Another solid, drinkable offering from SN. I'm glad this will be a regular offering, as it's a very tasty, sessionable IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,sraimondi,4.28,"A-Poured into a pint glass. Nice 1"" to 2"" head to start which dissipates to a surface head. Nice sheet lacing throughout session. Pretty, medium amber color with a reddish tint.  S-No surprise here, it's all about the hops. Citrus/pine predominates with some earthy hops pushing through.  T-As with the smell, this is about the hops. Earthiness is more prevalent at first with some citrus in there too. Surprisingly balanced with malt in the finish, given the aroma. Very nice flavor.  MF-Low to moderate low carbonation. Full feel nonetheless, very nice, indeed.  D-This is a very drinkable IPA, as you don't really feel the elevated ABV. However, I couldn't give it a higher score, as the elevated ABV just doesn't make this very sessionable.With that said, I'm not sure you would find a much better IPA experience over 1 or 2 of these.  Another winner from the folks in Chico.  Steve",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JayNH,4,"A- pours a clear reddish copper color with a small foamy head.  S- A ton of citric hops in the nose.  T- Starts out with a slightly sweet citric hoppiness. Just enough malt to take the edge off the hops. Finishes very earthy and piney. This one's all about the hops.  M- moderate body, plenty of carbonation. Plenty of hop oil in the aftertaste.  D- Very good overall. Nothing revolutionary here. Just a solid, sharply hopped west coast IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jaxon53,4.07,"Finally got a chance to try Torpedo. Served this chilled, in a pint glass, from a stubby, twelve ounce brown bottle.  Appearance: Torpedo pours out a copper, almost rusty looking color. Beer has great clarity, with plenty of carbonation bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass. A somewhat hard pour resulted in about a finger of fluffy, off-white head. Not the greatest head retention, head faded rather quickly. Some random spotty lace was left clinging to the glass.  Smell: Definitely has a West Coast nose to it. Smells quite hoppy, with some pretty heavy citrus notes and a bit of faint pine. Citrus aromas consist of lemon and orange zest and some strong grapefruit. Also some thick, biscuitty malt aromas with a touch of brewers yeast. Hints of fresh cut grass in the background.  Taste: A serious hoppiness out front. Lots of orange and grapefruit peel. Definitely a thick, balancing malt backbone that this beer is built on. A bit of a slight metallic taste follows. Grassy and just a bit sweet. Nice earthy flavors make this beer quite enjoyable. Finishes dry, with a hoppy bitterness. Very little noticeable alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Enjoyable medium bodied mouthfeel. A bit thinner than I would like. A good amount of tingly carbonation.  Drinkability: A dangerously drinkable brew. Smooth, crisp, and very refreshing. A definite winner in my book.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,marcpal,4.17,"After a trip to Easton PA yesterday and not finding my usual refill of Two Hearted to bring back to NJ, I saw this on the shelves and the six pack called my name. Streak of still never having a sub-par beer from SN continues.  12oz bottle into shaped Dogfish pint glass. Bottle Graphics: 5/10  A: Gold orange with a meringue white head that fluffs together both on the head and on the lacing.  S: Invite pine tree cascade hop aroma. Bready flavors are balancing it nicely.  T: The initial take is that this one is more malty than most of the things I have had from Sierra Nevada. Not a bitter hop blast but the resin on the palate plays a good part and the pine flavors of this fine brewery is more than amply present. Good job in creating a grapefruit non-bomb with enough malt backbone.  M: Some oily residue which is a pleasureable note. Somewhat substantial body, nothing too heavy. If any hit, a little too much carbonation but that is stretching it.  D: I prefer some of their others such as Celebration but I like the label of 'extra' pale ale as it walks the gray line between IPA and PA, similar to Alpha King. A terrific beer to pair with flavorful food as I did today and will do often in the near future.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,tosshin,3.23,"a : Poors clear with a good bit of carbination which forms about an inch worth of firm, tan, head. The head does not disipate quickly, and leaves a fair bit of lacing. Deep gold to orange in color. s : Very flowery, a good bit of citrus, and a hit of pine (that is the best way I can describe it). Not too much else going on here. t : This beer tastes very dry. The citrus acidity is noticeable, but mostly what I taste is the hoppy bitterness. The hops hits you when you first drink and shows up more when you swallow. m : The mouth feel on this is just about perfect. I like how the beer coats the mouth and then leaves without leaving a lot of residue behind. d : To be honest this one is a bit difficult to drink. It usually takes me about 30 mins to finish a bottle, and that is about all I can drink for the day of this beer.  This beer is not my favorite Sierra Nevada brew. It isn't a bad beer by any means, but it is a bit on the hoppy side for my tastes. Actually, I don't mind the hops, I just wish there was some more variety in the beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,APNumber3,4.2,"12 oz bottle purchased at Total Wine, PBG, FL.  Been looking forward to trying this one for a while now. Anyhow, it pours orange bronze with an inch and a half worth of head. Highly carbonated. Piney hop aroma, not overpowering. But nice. Taste is very well balanced. Grapefruity bitterness up front, then some sugar cookie sweetness to balance it out. Finishes with an almost peppery bitterness.  Overall I really enjoyed this beer. It's not a kick your teeth in IPA. It is bitter. But balanced. Good stuff. I will drink this again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,currysage1,4.36,"Pours a beaufifully clear solid orange, topped with a three finger cream colored head, amazing lacing that slowly sinks down the glass.  Smell is of just cut pine board, slight sweat smell (not BO), lemon juice, malt is light but evident.  Taste is of toasted brown bread, then on to the hops, definately West Coast style, usual suspects of citrus and pine, vanilla, ends mostly with a nice bite to it. Very nice AIPA offering.  Feel is creamy and full for the style. Carbonation keeps it active flavorwise not stagnant, this evolves in your mouth. Awesome beer from an awesome company, they need to put out many more new beers to flex their artistic mucles.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Gmann,4.03,"Pours a crystal clear golden honey color with a pillowy egg shell colored head that left plenty of sticky lacing on the glass. Very purty look'n beer. Nice fresh hop aroma, grassy, spicy and buddy. Aroma doesn't knock you off your feet but this is how I like my hoppy brews to smell. The hop profile transfers over in the taste. More of a floral hoppy flavor IPA than a bitter IPA. A light bready malt presence rounds out the brew. Definitely a more balanced IPA than most. Moderate body with fizzy carbonation, again finishes balanced. A very easy drinking IPA, well made.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JEdmund,4.38,"Appearance Orangey-amber with a rocky, off-white head; clear with good carbonation; leaves clumpy lacing  Smell Great sharp aroma--piney, citrussy, and herbal notes really come together in a focused way; I like it!  Taste First few sips surprise me as it's not quite the hop assault I was expecting. There are plenty of hops, but they're really kept in check by the malt. Every sip brings (and leaves) a strong hop taste but it just doesn't quite command attention in the kick-your-teeth-in manner of other IPAs out there. However, after 10 minutes or so in the glass, the hops really become even more pronounced, yet it's still a malty IPA. Hop qualities are extremely piney, citrussy, and a bit minty--I love it.  Mouthfeel Texture is really smooth with a slightly oily coating. Body is medium: not the fullest but by no means on the thin side; just right there in the middle.  Overall It's not quite as good as Celebration Ale, but I'm OK with that (it's nice to look forward to an annual treat that's really, really good). It's a solid IPA and I happily welcome it to the year-round lineup and into the regular rotation of IPAs in my fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,cokes,4.1,"Golden bronze bodied covered with a medium-sized off-white head that leaves rings of lace as it slowly disappears. The nose features pine- needles, sap, and cones- grapefruit, toast, and lime juice. The malt presents first in the mouth with roasted nuts and burnt sugar, segueing towards (unburnt) caramel and honeyed cereal grains. Hops hammer down, midway. Lots of pine, again. With the pungent sappy tones, as well as earthier cone-like notions. Fruitiness is larger than in the aroma. Oranges especially, but there are myriad citric notes here, with a separate emphasis on grapefruit. It ends with a fade out of the overt pine and citrus tones towards a lingering peppery bitterness. Perhaps a notch above medium in build, glossy in feel from the low level of carbonation. This is no world beater, but when price and availability are considered, this is a very attractive option.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BierFan,3.43,"Poured from a short 12 ounce brown bottle into a cervoise.  Appearance: Off-white head. Clear dark orange body shows off great carbonation.  Smell: Lots of pine and grapefruit from the hops.  Taste: Guess what? It tastes like hops. The pine characteristics are more easily noticed in the aftertaste. I thought that this beer was rather boring. It packs a big punch of hops, but beyond that there wasn't much going on.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Jwale73,4.3,"Served in a standard pint. Poured a translucent amber with a half inch off-white cap. Head eventually dissipated into a pocked swirl of foam. Sheets of lacing are revealed with each tilt of the glass; very good adhesion. Nose was piney grapefruit. Taste consistent with nose - some sweetness up front and a light hops bite at the back; however, it doesn't stick around for long - great balance. Mouthfeel was light and crisp with just the right amount of carbonation. By far, one of the easiest drinking IPAs I've ever had. Need to pick up more of this soon.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mattffrost,4.33,"Bottle poured into glass.  Appearance A clear dark amber. Head is a little than darker off white. Head dissolves but leaves good lacing.  Smell Sweet carmel, pine nuts, grassy floral. Nice earthiness.  Taste Very nice. A sweet carmel up front flavor that finishes a little bitter. The hops are very strong and I like that about this beer.  Mouthfeel Low carbonation hoppy beer.  Drinkability. For me I could drink these all day.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,tempest,4.1,"Picked up a single at Liberty St. Tavern. Poured into a pilsner glass, it basically just looks like SNPA, clear amber with a white head. I'm a fan, this is on the heavy end of IPA's Great Divide's Titan IPA. There's a rich mix of grassy, citrus and pine that, well, reminds me greatly of normal Sierra Nevada, but without the malts. This is a fine IPA and I'd definitely have this again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jnn4v,3.77,"Appearance - Dark amber color. Slightly hazy, like thousands of microscopic bubbles are trapped in it (hopefully this is resin from fresh hops?)  Smell - Aromatic, although not particularly floral. Mostly citrus, with a hint of evergreen. Definitely some honey coming through as well. This was served at refrigerator temp (roughly 40 degrees) so I'm sure it'll liven up as it warms.  Taste - A bit of a letdown after the build-up from the appearance and smell. Not nearly as citrusy or honeyed as I was hoping. Much more bitter pine and astringent hop flavors. If you're hoping for something like Hopslam (or even Caldera IPA) this will disappoint you. It's closer to Green Flash IPA in ""balance"". Still, there is a bit of latent sweetness and the flavor does have its merits.  Mouthfeel - Very good texture. What I'd deem as ""microcarbonated"". Not oily or syrupy, but no big bubbles either. Almost reminds me of the texture of a hand-pulled cask ale.  Drinkability - While I love the texture, and the flavor is above average, it's not the easiest beer to drink by the pint. I don't think I'll want a second.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Shaw,4.21,"Fellow BA thryn gave me a bottle tonight. Thanks!  It's a beautiful deep copper in color with a large sticky off-white head. It has a good hop aroma. Nothing extreme, just a nice note of hops.  The taste is wonderfully bitter, in an IPA way. The malty biscuit flavors are very apparent at first, and give way to the bitterness. The hop flavor is lower: this isn't a dry-hopped bomb. I can see why they called it an extra IPA, instead of a double/imperial IPA. It's much more restrained than the extreme beers.  The body is full and smooth: very nice.  Overall this is a very good beer, which should be no surprise coming from Sierra Nevada. Well worth seeking out, especially for IPA fans.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,wagenvolks,4.39,"12oz stubby bottle into a Foothills pint glass.  I always love a new Sierra Nevada release, especially when they're good and hoppy. Torpedo Extra IPA pours a clear, golden-amber hue with a decent carbonation level and a modest half inch of off-white, foamy goodness. Heat retention is decent, but the lacing on this brew is impeccable--webbed glory! The aroma is unmistakably that of Sierra Nevada IPA, as it bursts with resinous, piney, citrus, and floral hops. A nice balance from the malts adds some toasted caramel, but this baby is all hops. Me likey...  Somehow, the bitterness of this IPA stays at the same level throughout each and every sip. Aggressive, but restrained and not at all harsh, the alpha acids cling to the tastebuds while a chewy, creamy caramel malt note balances the flavor profile nicely. Good mouthfeel, too, with a medium consistency and a fantastic, bitter bite of lingering hop resin. Not a lot of complexity to this IPA, but for hop lovers like myself, it's a dream. Highly recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,clayrock81,4,"Pours a seethru golden body with copper tint and a well-carbonated, fluffy two-finger head that stuck around awhile. A dominant citric and floral hop smell but a definite malt smell as well; caramel, bread, toasted(?). Almost full-bodied, a little thick and chewey with bread malts and some caramel tucked in there. But this beer is about the hops, and they come in aplenty for a dry beer that has citric fruit along with some heavier fruits like grape for that floral, earthy hop taste that hopheads love. The mix of hops and some sweetness make this a great beer to have, but I'm not sure I'd session this b/c it dried my tastebuds out a little.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,nlmartin,4.13,This beer was served in a pint glass.  Appearance: From the get go I like the way the beer looks. The beer pours a clear orange / amber coloration. The head is a finger and a half high light biege coloration. Good retention is noted super rings left behind on my glass.  Smell: The hops are the center of the aroma. The hops come in floral and pine resin. Grapefruit and a bit of pineapple float on a malty bready base.  Taste: The flavor of the beer is dominated by pine resin hops. A bit of grapefruit combines with a cracker dryness. Starts bitter and pretty much remains throughout flavor.  Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is slick and medium. Carbonation is appropriate to the beer. This beer has great drinkability. I polished a six pack of this off the first night I bought it. I never got bored with the flavor during that evening.

The beer laces fairly well and has very good retention. The nose on the beer is strong herbal and piney hops and maybe a touch of malt underneath.  The taste won't disappoint. It is quite dry, herbal, piney and a touch of acerbic bittering hop. It is not a juicy or oily hop character in the beer, more the herbal and piney variety. It is quite good. The beer is medium bodied and does have some bready malt grains underneath. The mouthfeel is slightly acerbic and mouth puckering sourish with a slightly lingering bitterness in the finish and aftertaste.

S: Citrus and piney hops with a hint of malt underneath.  T: Very light malt foundation -- bready or biscuity-type malt -- acts as a springboard for the hops. We're talking piney hops -- think pine sap or resin. Finishes with a mouth-coating piney/lemony drying hop bitterness that stays with you.  M: Very good. Call it lighter side of medium with good prickly carbonation that brings it to life on the palate.  D: Excellent if you like a big, bitter, piney, hoppy IPA. I do, so I like this one.  Notes: I see I reviewed this from the tap last July and in that review I wished it was bottled. Well, here it is and I like.

The lacing on this glass was very cool.  Taste is bitter at first to me, but after trying it more it grown on me. The only beer I have really had close to this was a APA by Schlafly, Dry-Hopped. Tastes pretty close to it but much on the more bitter side, but I really dig the hops taste. It has a grapefruit taste to me as well.

Taste is clean, crisp, and mellowing with a nice display and array of hop tones backed by a firm toasty backing. Pine, white grapefruit, peach, and some amazingly interesting character in its overall tone. Its a smoothed over softness, yet has a tattered and torn scrappyness to its bittering bite. Uniquely balanced and has favorable finish of soft hoppy fuzz and a toasty twisted pineyness.  Feel has a nice crispy yet bold tone of mediumness that rounds out well with a very nice balance of a lightly toasted background under its hop cloud and bittering soft rain.  Its not quite Harvest, and not Celebration, nor their regular IPA or the Pale. Its a nice 'somewhere inbetween' them all. I was, however, hoping for something more for it being labeled an Extra IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,KBoudreau66,3.7,"Bought a single bottle after work and poured it into a pint glass.  Pours a dark copper color with two fingers of sticky off white head that dissipates over the course of the beer but lasts throughout. Although when it is first poured the head looks stick this brew leaves frothy lacing down the glass.  Smells strongly of citrusy hops with undertones of pine, grapefruit, caramel malts and bread.  Not as strongly hopped as I was expecting but overall the taste is similar to the smell with piney hops up front with citrus, sweet malts, and bready undertones.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated. I was expecting it to be dryer then it was. This is somewhat disappointing because all of my favorite IPA's have that crisp dryness that this beer lacks.  This is a drinkable and affordable brew. A solid IPA by a great company in Sierra Nevada. This isn't my favorite IPA, but it is still pretty good, and pretty affordable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S - grapefruit, pineapples, pine resin. this is the first time I have ever smelled pine resin in a beer. no malt aroma.  T - hops: citrus, with a load of piney hops. the beer has a strong bitter taste that to me seems to overpower the hop aroma. thus, it's more bitter than floral/citrusy/piney.  M - typical IPA mouthfeel.  D - I'm not a hophead, but there are plenty of IPAs I've drink before this because, as I said, it's more bitter than hoppy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Has a very lite head and little laceing ( maybee because I had it on Ice for two days) I liked the lite amber tint to it very clean looking, not like a sese pool of crap swiming around in there. I really liked the smell of this beer I get very sweet notes kind of reminds me of a fresh Cara Cara with a splash of grapefrute very nice. To my likeing this beer has a very nice lite bitter bite to it at first taste leaveing a hint of citrus on the back of my tounge very non abraseve. At 7.2 I think I could sit back and drink a six pack in a sitting hides it very well. I am glad this is on the year round line up.

Taste: nice caramel base with some grapefruit, pine, and a hearty but not overpowering floral bitterness. Alcohol is well hidden.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied. Crisp from start to finish. Aftertaste is long as the flavors linger on the tongue.  Drinkability: I found this to be a nice sessionable IPA. Nice flavors keep you interested through a few bottles.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,optiontwo,4.1,"12oz. poured into tulip Appearance: Clear light orange/amber color with half inch head, decent retention, and some lacing.  Smell: A nice amount of hop presence in the nose, slightly earthy but mostly citrus with some herbal hints. Very subtle malt aroma in the background.  Taste: The first taste provides an amalgamation of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and pine/herbal tones. This if followed by a slight sweetness from the malt and then plenty of bitterness. This brew is definitely all hop oriented but it's a nice change from some very hop forward IPA's and DIPA's, not because it is maltier than most but because the hops used provide a different type of ""hoppy"".  Mouthfeel: Crisp and clean, great bitter bite, and medium bodied.  Drinkability: Very high. It's 7.2%ABV but drinks very easy and is tasty, this could very well be my new go to IPA.  Overall: I was excitedly awaiting this beer and am not disappointed in the slightest. I understand why they call this an ""extra IPA"" because that's pretty accurate for each of its attributes. It's not a hop bomb and doesn't have the typical thicker body a DIPA has, but still has a substantial mouthfeel. Another reason this is going to be my new go to IPA is because a six-pack is 8$, less than two hearted, and you just can't say no to that. Great job Sierra Nevada!

140,30420,whynot44,4.08,"Nice clear orange/amber color with a respectable off-whiute head that sticks around and leaves some nice sticky lacing.  The aroma is citrus, pine resin and caramel malt in the background.  The taste is grapefruit, bready malt, hints of caramel with a lasting pine resin finish. Definitely for the hop heads, but not overpowering and balanced somewhat by a caramel malt flavor that really works well.  Medium bodied, smooth, oily mouth feel that drinks very well. Some hints of the alcohol content at the finish. A very nice IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,pdxwhisky,4.22,"Nice pour, little to no head or lacing. Strong herbal hop aroma. Well balanced, with a strong hop finish, but not a ""fresh hop"" finish.

140,30420,MICAMD,4.1,"A- A very clear copper orange color with a few streams of carbonation. The head is craggy and white with some surprising retention and lacing.  S- Very grassy and piney with a bit of cinnamon. I also noticed some herbal quality when I took note of what the neck label had to say. Pretty aromatic and reminds me of a well-backed west coast IPA.  T- Very bitter hops at first, but it fades pretty quick to a sweet malt backing. There seem to be a whole bunch of hops in this, but it is surprisingly smooth. A huge amount of pine flavors though. Pretty tasty.  M- Very clean, dry, and with a lasting bitterness that isn't overwhelming. Just what I look for in a west coast IPA.  D- Tastes amazingly fresh. Very tasty and drinkable. I can't believe how cheap this beer is when you factor in shipping across the U.S., the quality of flavor, the amount of hops, and the alcohol by volume. I hate to say it, but this is moving dangerously close to replacing their regular pale ale in my fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jwc215,4,"Pours orange amber with a thin tan head. Some lacing sticks.  The smell is of musty pine and citrus (grapefruit).  The taste is of resiny pine and grapefruit. Although it has a bitter touch, it has a strong sweetness that approaches a DIPA character. Fruity alcohol shows in the finish.  Near full-bodied with a bit of an oily slickness, the heat lingers a bit on the palate.  Hoppy, but with a big maltiness. It doesn't quite mask the abv that some others of the same abv do, but still very drinkable. It has some DIPA characteristics without quite going that far. Much improved over the IPA I had from this brewery a couple years ago. It does have a SN character, making it like the pale, but bigger and pinier.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,AChamberlain,4.13,"Orange to amber with a soft offwhite head. Inviting. Citrus and pine flavors, as in the aroma. Malt backbone is there and fairly strong. Balanced. Definitely an IPA and definitely Sierra Nevada (these are good things). Smooth, not too heavy. Good carbonation. For 7.20, hella drinkable. It is flavorful enough and light enough to be an IPA you could stick with for awhile. Reminiscent of other west coast IPAs, Lagunitas, Racer 5...etc. A solid addition to the SN lineup.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mwagner1018,4.08,"Thanks to Alvey at the Four Firkins for getting this one in...have been looking forward to it getting to MN for a while...  A- Gorgeous auburn-amber, golden rust color, with a nice 2 fingers of frothy creamy head poured out of the bottle into a British Ale Pint glass, good carbonation action/float balanced in the glass. Slight lacing in clumps down the glass.  S- Very nice citrus, orange clove, spice, lemon, ginger...very nice hop character.  T- Well balanced, with a nice hop bitterness to end, tingles on the back of the taste buds.  M- Buttery and clean to the pallet, refreshing and crisp. Aromatic and light to the tongue, tingle of the carbonation well balanced. The only fault may be the minimal notice of malt character to create the harmony with the hop sting.  D- Very drinkable, but I would say that the hop bitterness would burn out my taste buds after 2-3, very clean to drink, and smooths out through the glass, served at a nice temperature really shows off the complexity of the hop character. Served at Cellar temp, about 56 deg F.  Well worth the wait, great beer, nice addition to the American Extra IPA arena, sweet, but bold, complex, but overall pretty balanced. Nice beer, and definitely quenches my hop thirst!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,GilGarp,4.23,"Pours into a curvy Sam Adams glass. Great thick white head settles slowly and leaves excellent lacing behind. The beer is a pale orange amber with good clarity, especially for an IPA.  Aroma is not super strong but has nice sweet citrus and grapefruit notes to it. Hoppy but not over the top.  Flavor is just about perfect for the style with lots of fruity citrus hops, some pine, grass, and orange peel. Great balance between sweet and bitter with an obvious emphasis on the latter.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of alchol burn on the finish. Pretty bitter and dry too. Not great but acceptable for the style.  Drinkability is very good. As I said earlier, nice balance leads to a feeling of not being overwhelmed by hops but you still get your kick.  A very good west coast IPA. I can't wait to start seeing this in bars and restaurants around the country. Where the SNPA was the go-to beer in bars with weak selections, now this can be the hophead's savior.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,JonathanL7890,4,"Wow, this beer has a tremendous billowy head. Lots of lacing on the glass. Color is a deep amber, not quite as deep as celebration. Aroma: citrusy, grassy, malty, in that order. Taste: clean , good hop bite. Mid level of malt. Bitterness lingers for awhile. Mouthfeel / Drinkability: good silky mouthfeel. Easy drinking. Another SN beer to hit for my hop fix.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Bighuge,4.08,"Clear copper. Perfectly clear. Slight dirty white head. Lace is quite abundant. Aroma is nice and fresh and hoppy, but in all honesty, not as hoppy as I was expecting. It's got floral hop notes and points of pine and citrus. Just not as bold as I'd like. However, hops are a lot more prevalent on the buds. They make their presence known in both the bitterness and the flavor. Bright citric characteristics and some piney flavors as well backed by a biting bitterness not seen in many regular IPAs today. I guess this is where the ""extra"" comes into play. The malts provide a good enough amount of caramel sweetness for such a beer. But the cutting bitterness defines this beer and would probably make it perfect for spicy foods. I think I'll try this out tonight with some jerk seasoned sirloin and rosemary baby reds.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Rayek,4,"A: Orange amber with puffy bone white cap. Head retention is average, but a generous lace is left behind.  S: Heavy pine forest scents, with a generous backing of grapefruit citrus. A faint honey sweetness lingers out back.  T: Powerful hop flavor, without a too overpowering hop bitterness. Pine, lemon, grapefruit and pepper flavors create a nice harmony of hop flavors. Malt is there with an agave sweetness that rides through the whole experience. Despite all the hop flavor, the bitterness isn't over the top. But it's still quite powerful. Finishes with a puckering lemon tartness and lingering bitterness.  M: Medium body is quite oily and slick. Carbonation level feels about right.  D: A nice IPA that I would happily revisit. Not quite at the same level of complexity as my benchmark IPA, but still quite good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Very nice.  Smell - I can smell it from the table. Nice. Nice pine hops with some grapefruit. Real piney.  Taste - Starts with some nice citrus, with the pine. With some spiciness and a little warmth on the follow. It's a little thin. I wish it'd really gone for it and been a real DIPA. It's close but not quite there. There's just a layer of oomph missing. It's not even that it's balanced, it's just that it's a tad flat on the flavor.  Mouthfeel - Not bad. A little watery pretty good carbonation, but not quite enough of that tongue coating goodness.  Drinkability - Very nice. It's crisp, it's pretty tasty, it's pretty mellow. Very drinkable.  This is a good, not great, beer. It's kind of what one would expect from a ""strong"" IPA that's being more broadly distributed. I'll happily grab a sixer of this, but I'm not going out of my way to introduce someone to it.

Aroma is sweet with hemp, pine and loads of citrussy hops. Some floral hop aroma, its smells like weed. The aroma is very pungeant and sweet.  Smooth and carbonated up front with decent sweetness, orange peel, pine and mango. The beer becomes a bit more peppery prior to swallowing with a spicieness. Minerally water at the swallow.

I'll always say bitter is better and this beer is pretty bitter with a nice bite of hops. Grapefuit is present and so is a nice malty undertone.  Very light bodied and well carbonated.

It finishes with a tobacco and grassy flavors. a medium bodied feel all the way through, very consistant. It finishes dry, but not too dry, just enough for you nto want more.

This may be a fluke, but the bubbles actually form a discernable geometric pattern that you rarely see. The head deflates after a couple minutes leaving the ""pattern"" of sorts and some sticky lacing.  Aroma is rich of sweet cascade and honeydew. Less pine and more robust citrus. Some berries and underlying base malt.  Taste is a little light up front, but follows with more pine and bitterness than was present in the aroma. Nice balanced, earthy malt base but with enough bitterness to keep it a very clean APA. A little lemony sweetness- I bet this beer would actually go well with a lemon (with an IPA... sounds blasphemous but would be worth a try).  Good medium body that suits the earthy malt base and doesn't interfere with the bitterness.  Really, this beer is what hop devil should have been.

T- Starts off malty but has a nice hoppy backbone with notes of tropical fruit, pine, and a semi-astringent/dry finish. The finish yields some fruitiness amongst the dryness.  M- Light carbonation.

140,30420,PeprSprYoFace,4.04,Pours a nice looking copper color. There wasn't much head and just a little bit of lacing. Pretty nice looking beer all together.  Smell is nice and malty with a pretty nice piney hop background. Decent smell.  Taste is better than it smells. A pretty good balance of hops and malts. I cant help but feel like there is an arrogant bastard feel to this in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is pretty good on the carbonation and malt ratio.  Drinkability is high because I feel like I could drink a few of these in a row. A nice session beer for sure. Good thing it comes in a 6 pack because I'm going to want some more.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bigdeuce,3.86,"Pours a nice copper color with a nice craggy head and lacing down the glass. In true Sierra Nevada style, a nice looking beer. Some scents of pine oil, but slight, not as much as I had heard. About the same mouthfeel, with the exception of bigfoot, in sierra nevada fashion. Light, clean, hoppy and crisp. A nice session beer. Very easy to drink, but I had heard it was a ""hop bomb"" inwhich case it isn't. It is just another good session beer in the sierra nevada tradition.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,wcudwight,4.41,"Excellent appearance. Amber/Golden/Copper in color. Wonderful textured pastel yellow head with great retention and lot's of sticky lacing. This one certainly looks the part. Smells like a spruce tree. Pretty one demensional aroma but it smells good. This IPA expands the whole hop flavor gammut with out going overboard. Grapefruit rinds, Pinetrees, and your favorite herbs are present, each playing an equel and integral part. How SN maintains this flavor and balance with out the beer being a total hop bomb is beyond me. Mouthfeel is medium and crisp. Refreshing with out too much hop bite. Drinkability? Do not neglect your fridge! Stock up on SN Torpedo immediately. If SN were to release this one day only at the brewery and have an event to promote it; it would be a top 10 IPA imho.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bbothen,4.3,"Pours out a clear light rust color with a thick & frothy 2 finger deep off white head.  Smells of piney hops, bisquity malts, sweet caramel malt, citric hoppiness, grapefruit, lemon, grassy. Nice.  Grassy, earthy, and fruity hops up front, sweet caramel maltiness, ginger, nice bitter finish.  Medium bodied, smooth, crisp, clean, moderate carbonation, lingering bitterness.  Nice sessionable IPA right here. Usually nicely priced in Ca as well. Heck of a bargain. Will be buying again I'm sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,stephens101,3.88,"Pours a clear brass color with a two-finger, fluffy tan head that fades quite slowly into a pillow-top-like covering that never completely goes away. Bitter hops confront the nose as the citrus elements work themselves into the equation and linger slowly upward. Tastes of citrusy hops and some sweet malts. Mouth-feel is medium-bodied and just a bit powdery with some oiliness that makes it all go down well. Brews like this are sometimes hard to break down, as the elements fuse so well together that any distinction is lost in the perfection of balance.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Overlord,4.15,"Pours a dark orange/amber. One of the darker IPAS I've seen. Big white foam head.  Smells like fresh cut grass, floral notes, with a touch pine ... maybe a hint of citrus. Interesting.  Taste is actually much different. Frankly, it doesn't match the aroma. The taste has tangerine, apricot???, sweet citrus, and some balancing pine bitterness. It's kind of weird and exotic, actually. There's a medicinal/herbal/fresh grass quality that was offputting at first, but which I actually warmed up to.  Good mouthfeel. Quite drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,darklordlager,4.45,"Pours a crystal clear orange-amber, with a nice 1"" head that retains. Great lacing as it goes down the glass.  Smell is of flowery hops, bitter citrus, and a bit of pine and pale malt. Simple, yet pleasantly crisp.  Taste is a slick refreshing hop blast, subdsiding soon after each sip. Very clean, yet flavourful. Nice minty aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is excellent-smooth carbonation makes this an easy drinker.  Drinkability is excellent--smooth hoppy goodness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ccrida,3.65,"12 oz bottle poured into my Meantime snifter, Torpedo is a clear copper with an off-white head leaving decent lace.  Smell is hoppy, resinous, earthy and dank, with flora and citrus notes coming to the fore as it warmed up a bit from the fridge serving temp.  Taste is assertive. Peppery bite to the hops and a firm bitterness, some oily fusels. Also a bit of a bready aftertaste, but mainly a lingering bitterness.  Mouthfeel is creamily carbonated, medium bodied, slick.  Drinkability is OK, but it's not really my style of big IPA. I prefer more floral and citrus notes, smoother and less bite. A bit of a disappointment after the accolades and hype it's been receiving. Still, the high ABV is well hidden, and the price is good. I actually had two bottles in a row, both pulled from the fridge at once, as I wrote this review.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,RomanW70,3.4,"12 oz. bottle. Pours crystal clear deep amber with a medium white head. Aroma of pine, grapefruit, and grain. High carbonation with a medium thick body. Taste is really hoppy up front, with some sweet malts, but very quickly overtaken by hops. The tastes slides to a bitter finish with a healthy amount of cereal grain. A good IPA, but I'm not sure this lies up to the hype.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CrazyMacHarris99,4.11,This one pours a clear amber with a thick white head that looked like foam on a cappucino. The smell is a classic Sierra Nevada. There is a citrusy hops with grapefruit and pine. Taste is a little thin and a lot like the SNPA. The hops are a little stronger than that but not much. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the drinkability is top notch.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,alexgash,4.13,"12 oz. bottle.  Brilliantly clear light copper with golden yellow edges. Solid finger of pillowy, light beige head. Great lacing. Classic Sierra Nevada cascade hop nose with loads of fresh grapefruit, and flourishes of pine, sap, and resin. Sugary malt and fruit notes balance it out.  Toasted malt and herbal hop bitterness up front. Faintly sweet bread and fruit malts follow. Big grapefruit and numbing pine bitterness take it away to the finish. Dry, bitter and appetizing finish. Lingering fruit notes, but mostly numbing bitterness. Unmistakably Sierra Nevada, with a very clean, fresh, aggressively bitter cascade character. Oh, and quite delicious too! Medium body with a creamy feel. Much like an amped-up SNPA, that I kind of was expecting. Glad to have this around!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Clydesdale,4.03,"A: A clear orange-bronze color with large carbonation bubbles. A big, densely foamy off-white head with very nice retention and lacing. Definitely looks the part.  S: Strong citrus aromas - lemon, orange, grapefruit, you name it. Definitely some substantial floral hops there to back up the citrus. A hint of caramel malt, but this one is dominated by the citric and floral scents.  T: Floral hops are much more assertive than the nose initially suggested, as they offer a fairly robust initial kick of bitterness. Definite citrus notes as well - mostly grapefruit and lemon zest. Perhaps a bit of resiny pine hop flavor too. Light hints of yeast and biscuity malts are present, but certainly don't offer much.  M: Rather medium-bodied. Carbonation is fairly active and lends a nice crispness that accompanies the bitterness well. A dry, slightly puckering finish and a lingering aftertaste.  D: As always, high-quality stuff from SN. The hop flavors are quite floral, in my opinion. Take your pick: a big, assertive IPA, or a somewhat mild yet extremely drinkable double IPA. Either way, a very nice beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Slatetank,4.22,"I really what Sierra Nevada is going for with this brew. It bridges tthe gap between the American Ipa and IIPa nicely.  Picked this up at Brass Rail in Campbelltown - poured from the stubby 12oz into my Dupont Saison willibecker  A - A dark golden/medium amber w/ good clarity and a medium khaki cap that is smooth w/ spacious bubbles from a vigorous pour. The lace clings almost instantly as the head settles and the beading is very fine  S - All the aromas you expect w/ a strong pungent,yet fresh blend of mango, orangey citrus and grapefruit w/ pine and herbal aromas like inhaling hop flowers  M - A nice + mellow hop feel w/ mild bitterness, just slightly more bitter than your average IPA w/ subtle pale malt sweetness and moderate carbonation  T - The taste is bitter w/ grapefruit acidity at first followed by sweet citrus like a valencia orange perhaps with a squirt of passionfruit, the pale malt and hop flavors seem more floral and sweet as it gets warmer w/ more herbal notes and juicy flavor w/ a side of sweet malt in the finish. A nice balanced taste you don't normally find in a 7% ipa with tea-like sweet and less bitter grass in the finish  D - A truly drinkable IPA with a little extra juice - in every sense. It is balanced, but doesn't lack for fresh hop flavor or aroma and is just bitter enough to let you know it is an IPA without going overboard. The hop flavor doesn't just deliver bitter tastes, but a wide range of hoppiness and is a unique method that obviously hits the mark. I could drink these one after another.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Shannon,3.76,"$8.99 a sixer at Total Beverage in Fairfax, VA.  A - 1/2 in head, off-white head with good lacing. Deep copper color denoting a higher malt content of a double IPA.  S - Flat, a little malt, not what I'd expect. Will check other the other bottles from the sixer but this one was disappointing for lack of hoppiness.  T - Very good hoppy tang. Also, recognizably Sierra Nevada. Like the pale ale, but with increased hop and malt. Same blend of hops (just with a different process and increased amount)?  M - Smooth and hefty. Fine carbonation.  D - Good. What you'd expect from a heavier or double IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ThirdLap,3.83,"From a $7.99 sixer purchased at Nugget Vacaville on February 12, 2009. Poured into a Firestone pint glass at 55°F.  Pours a golden amber with a foamy 1"" light tan head that leaves a bit of lacing. Head is long-lasting, and after receding to 1/2 cm, stays for most of the ride.  I sniffed and sniffed, but there just doesn't seem to be a whole lot happening on the nose. Light grapefruit citrusiness with a bit more malt than expected. Notes of pine.  Wow, this is different. There's this nutty, creamy, tanginess complementing the hops that sets it apart from many other IPAs I've had in the past. The finish is piney with a slight alcohol burn. This is a well-balanced beer, if just a bit malty for a west coast IPA.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with lots of carbonation. Alcohol is quite apparent for a 7.2% beer.  I could go through these pretty quickly. Solid IPA, especially for the price.  --- Retasted a week later, forgot about my first review. Scores were exactly the same save for drinkability.  A - Deep copper amber with a foamy off-white head that dissipates quickly, leaving a resilient film. Some lacing noted.  S - More pine than citrus. The citrus says grapefruit.  T - Tons of citrus with a maltier-than-expected finish. Notes of caramel. The balance seems to be lacking.  M - Lots of carbonation, medium bodied, almost chewy consistency. Bitter finish that sticks around till the next sip.  D - Every time I crack a Torpedo, I wish I'd opted for a Celebration instead. :/  I'm a huge SN fan, so this was somewhat of a letdown.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Starts with some malt and a blast of lemon. Grapefruit rind and pine flavors follow. You can definetly tell this is a SN ale, with its beautiful hop profile and near perfect balance.

140,30420,Soneast,3.9,"Pours a dark copperish color with a creamy off-white head that started out at a half-inch in size and rapidly grew to about 2 inches after I set the glass down.  The nose consists of a nice, FLORAL pine bouquet with a little hint of citrus hidden away in the background with a nice balanced malty, caramel aroma to finish it off.  Taste is definitely not your typical Sierra Nevada affair. This really seems to have a much more balanced profile, deliciously hoppy up front, predominated by pine flavors accenuated by grapefruit citrus flavors backed up amazingly well by delectable caramel and toffee flavors. Finish dry and bitter, but not crazy-style bitter due to the great balance they achieved with this beer, just delicious and juicy.  Really good mouthfeel on this beer, so refreshing, leaves a great aftertaste. What can I say I love this beer.

Smell was leafy and earthy. Not strong.  Taste was also earthy hops. Husky grains. There was a lingering grassy bitterness after the sweeter middle.

140,30420,BEERchitect,4.18,"You can imagine the delight on my face as I saw this beer on the shelves of the Lexington-local Liquor Barn. Of course I'm rushing home to drink this beer. Now that I've had a few... too many, I'm going to attempt my review...  The pour gives me something that lands somewhere between the standard SN Pale ale and the Celebration ale. The color is deeply golden, but not quite amber. Not brilliantly clear, but glowing. Good head formation retains well throughout the session and leaves memories of lacing on the glass. A standard Sierra Nevada look.  Very citrusy in the nose with orange rinds, ruby-red grapefruits, pineapples, and maybe a pine cone or three. Sweet ginger-bread malts blend with caramel for a grahm cracker crustiness that leads to a well attenuated yeasty and cracker-like flavor.  The feel is supurb. Aside from a slight nail-polish-like taste and feel, the alcohols are well hidded, leading to a dry finish that accomodates the resiny hops well. Highly attenuated for a very palatable, clean, refreshing citrus finish.  Do IPA's taste better? Sure. But do they finish as well? Doubtful. Does the drinkability fare as well? Doubtful. This is a beer where the mouthfeel and palatability fares even better than the signature-quality taste. Thumbprints of Sierra Nevada are all over this beer... keep up the good.. (er) great work!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CrellMoset,4.13,"Bottle from Wine Warehouse, Charlottesville, VA. Poured into a traditional American pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a filtered, amber-bodied brew with infrequent and relatively large effervescence. The one-finger off-white head has average retention and leaves some nice spider web-esque lacing after it recedes - the lacing actually lasts around the top of the glass for quite some time.  Aroma: A little too subtle, perhaps, with a lot of what I expect from an IPA getting lost It's mostly just light, tropical fruity esters and faint backing sweetness. It's pleasant, but, as mentioned, a little too mild.  Taste: A very balanced flavor profile. Smooth, gentle bitterness is moderate and perfectly in check with a citrusy, piney hop profile. Hints of pineapple, coconut, grapefruit, orange zest, floral, resinous pine needle, and mint. The malt backbone is similarly well-crafted, bready, slightly roasted, relatively sweet, with slight hints of gummy bears provided by those great tropical fruit notes mingling with soft saccharine overtones.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly soft and gentle, with a moderate amount of carbonation in a moderately-thick body. Just a very nice, balanced, even, crisp, but soft mouth.  Drinkability: This really is a smoother IPA. I know there's been a lot of discussion lately about being ""underwhelmed"" by this brew, but I don't think this beer is meant to overwhelm, or even ... well, whelm. It just is what it is, a smooth, soft, gentle, flavorful IPA, well-balanced and drinkable. It's very sessionable, as well, and though the abv% isn't listed, I can't assume it's 6%, 6.5%. If you've gotten used to the harshness of overly hoppy beers, this one might even be too tame for you, but if you're looking for a good introductory IPA, this one's a winner.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Chelsea1905,4.08,"Bought a 12oz bottle for just under $1.50, so the deal on this beer may sway the voting a little because this is a good deal!  Poured a nice amber colour, completely transparent, with a nice fluffy bread-like head that slowly disappeared and left nice spotty lacing throughout.  Smelled of a little bit of hops, some malty backbone, and a little mango and wet grass in there. Slightly watery.  Tastes great for as cheap as it is, but to be honest there are better.  Right amount of effervescence, medium bodied.  Almost drank the whole bottle ina oner, but this is a great little beer!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Vancer,3.63,"The ol' Torpedo (what a great name) pours a clear and enticing amber / copper with a full load of ivory head. Good Brussels lace in the Corsendonk tulip.  Plenty of sharp and cutting citrus and pine in the aroma. Those two are balanced well with the malt in the quaff. Touch of woody resin in the finish. Rich and a decent brew, this is in-between an IPA and a DIPA - but still closer to an IPA. Almost a session type IPA, sipper-wise, as the $8 a sixer won't break ya, and that sixer could last an evening. Did for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,stewart124,4,"Extra IPA  This is the first time I've seen this and I'd consider it an Extra IPA for us SN lovers.  Pours a light copper color with a sticky white lace.  Very floral nose with a nice amount of citrus but it doesn't seem to be much more than I get from the regular pale ale.  Now the taste is bolder and has a bigger malt bill along with the hops to pick it up into the IPA region. Good amount of caramel but less than celebration and less pine. The hops seem toned down in citrus and pine and more have more of a floral bouquet. There is a bitterness, almost a spiciness that is hard to place. Very sharp though.  The mouthfeel is medium and smooth. Finishes with a strong spiciness and leaves a very pleasant trace of hops.  Nicely done and I'll take an extra IPA any day of the week.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Rchap1,4.06,"Drinking this as I write, straight from the bottle. From the start, poured out a little to gauge the color; it's a great deep golden color, not quite copper but pretty close. Smell is surprisingly light, definitely getting the hop scent. It's not nearly as strong as I would have expected. Pretty floral overall, I'm not picking up a whole lot else. Taste is pretty aggressive. I can see why this is called an extra IPA. The hops hit you pretty quick, and kinda flare your nostrils a little bit. Picking up some citrus in there as well. The taste holds for quite some time after the swallow too. Nice and bitter. Mouthfeel is what you'd expect from a decent IPA, good bite to it, nice and full, decent carbonated feel. Drinkability is also quite good. I imagine I'll have several of these this evening... All in all, a good strong IPA from Sierra Nevada, definitely something I'll buy again!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,bigkahunas4,4.37,"Poured into a tulip, a beautiful amber body appeared. Really nice, quite translucent, with a steady carbonation. A half finger cloud appeared, before the head eventually settled on a fluffy film. Solid lacing. Nose is quite fruity, not brash like a pine or citrus. Rather, some dark fruits, plum and strawberry.  Flavor as expected leans towards the hoppy side, but it's very refreshing and smooth. Some floral notes, but mainly a bitter apple?? Certainly unlike anything I've had before. Mouthfeel is a medium body, and a slightly dry finish.  This guy is unlike any IPA I've had before. It's a perfect grab if you're looking for an IPA that doesn't take over with bitterness, but provides just enough. Top notch - definitely need to get some more. Could see this being a mini session beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jdoncbus,4.05,"Poured into the Sam Adams special glass (the official name escapes me); two finger head consisting of fluffy bubbles leaves rings around the glass. There's a good amount of carbonation shooting up from the bottom of the glass, leaving nice trails in the golden-bronze colored beverage.  The nose is biscuity and leads to a pine and mildly grapefruit/pineapple. A decent amount of sweet malt appears as well that exposes the nostrils to some sugary, toasty grains.  Like most Sierra Nevada ales, this one is very balanced. The initial flavor is the sweet, sourdough bread flavors of the malt; nice and robust. As it crosses the palate and heads towards the throat the hops really take charge. You can really make out the citrahop with the appearance of grapefruit, pear, apricot and rounded out with some serious bitter pine.  The smooth mouthfeel gives way to a sharp tart feel to the mouth; oh my how it's dry! The finale lets you know that you are dealing with an IPA.

140,30420,BBThunderbolt,3.9,"Poured into 12oz glass. Poured with a half inch of off-white head that left a lot of sticky lacing. An attractive, clear Orange-Amber color. A very good pine/citrus hop aroma. The flavor follows the lead set by the aroma, with SNs typical lack of malt, this beer is all hop flavors. The body is good, but could use a more solid foundation to build upon. A very drinkable beer, palate fatigue will become an issue due to the lack of balance. I'll admit that I liked this beer more than I expected, due to all the hype surrounding it. I generally find SN to be a one-trick pony. While I like their beers, the focus on hops only is boring. That said, this beer will likely find it's way into my regular rotation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Goliath,3.75,"Pours a clear copper color with a beautiful inch and a half off white head. The head lingers with good retention and leaves some spotty lace as it subsides.  The aroma is great, and pretty typical Sierra Nevada/West Coast. Big hop notes smacking you with some sappy pine and some sweet citrus. Delicious.  The taste is decent. A good hop presence giving a big sappy pine note, with a touch of citrus. It's slightly sweet up front, but gives way to a moderately bitter finish. A little rough around the edges with some boozy qualities, and a flavor profile that seems to be missing in mid pallate.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a soft and subdued carbonation.  Drinkability is fairly high. It's a tasty IPA, though lacking slightly. It's certainly easy to drink, and pleasureable as well.

T- Starts slightly sweet yet not with a distinguishable flavor, mid palate brings sour grapefruit notes. Finishes with a nice bitter piny and herbal hop.  M- Moderate high carbonation. Could have a bit more body to it a little thin.  D- This is a pretty nice IPA. Could have bit more body, and flavor could be slightly more pronounced.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,yelterdow,4.32,"Bottled on January 13, 2009... this is from a fresh sixer purchased a week ago. Served in a tasting tulip at a few degrees above fridge temperature.  Appearance- Four tall fingers of soapy, off-white head adorns this clear, deep burnished orange beer. Lacing is moderate, it's just plain juicy looking.  Smell- Clean, pungent aromas of grapefruit and freshly cut pine trees leap from the glass. A nice floral character wafts alongside, it's a classic West Coast hop profile. Similarites to Nugget Nectar in the nose surprise me, as I've never gotten that from any of SN's other offerings.  Taste- Deep, luscious hop juice envelops the mouth, rich and meaty with plenty of malt for balance. The whole cone hopping delivers a fullness and honesty that any IPA lover will find really enjoyable. It begins with a mild astringency, then grips the tongue and finishes with an eternal bitterness... the malts are there the whole time lending their backbone to support the massive flavor rush.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Entering the mouth the beer sizzles just slightly, then gently eases up and glides effortlessly down the gullet. At 7.2%, the alcohol is warming enough to be noticable... I wouldn't session this particular IPA if given the choice. Big, bold, and very tasty... two thumbs up as usual for the boys and girls in Chico, CA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TEXTONE,3.71,"I poured this beer from a 120z bottle with freshness date in to a pint glass. Beautiful white frothy head on this beer also has nice head retention and lacing. The body is clear, and clean with a pure copper color. The smell of this beer is grapefruit/citrus hops and sweet malts does not come off over hoped. Taste is sweet malt flavor right away, followed by citric flavor with a bitter feel in the back of the mouth. Full mouthfeel, nice and clean, goes down smooth with a bitter back end. Overall this beer has good malt and hop flavors with an astringent and bitter aftertaste. There is a lot of talk about this being the same or close to Celebration Ale but it is not. I prefer Celebration Ale due to the hop profile. Torpedo does sport a 7.2 ABV and is a good addition to S.N. line. I enjoyed this beer and will be drinking it again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Philabeerphia,4,"Glad to find this in the bottle @ Foodery after sipping a kegged version (which may have been from an earlier recipe iteration?)... poured into a large flute. Glowing hue of deep honey. Mostly transparent. On top of this sits the 1/2 finger cap of cream colored head, that leaves only hints of head throughout, complete with a wall of lace with each sip. Smells heavily of biscuits and a biting, almost 'skunky' style of hop aroma, that softens just a bit into some citric notes. Taste starts with a soft floral hop, a superior opening, and then opens up to a pronounced hop bite of the citric variety, followed quickly by a well backed and complex malt middle. Roasted notes, caramel and just a whisper of dryer pale malts slides into a very soft finish, with a milky honey type sweetness that soothes the tongue. This combines with the ample carbonation to provide an extremely pleasant finish. Pockets of hop oils adsorp to the corners of my mouth, and this is the best part of this beer. Raw, wild and especially 'floral' in this aftertaste. Overall it is a bit too far on the sweet side. Well put together, but could use more bitter notes and some lighter malt presence.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,xxHelderxx,4.53,"Exceptional color and clarity with this beer, so much so that its surprising for an IPA. Head poured to be perfect thickness and hung around for a long time with lots of lacing.  The nose of this brew is very floral with hops peeking through.  The taste is citrusy sweet which is well balanced by a strong hop finish.  The mouthfeel of this beer is also surprising to me. It goes down very smooth, little carbonation and leaves a nice taste in the mouth without any hoppy sting residue.  While I might not drink more than 2 of these, its very very drinkable. However because this beer is so well balanced I wouldnt doubt that those of you out there who love Harpoon IPA or anything comparable could throw back a bunch of these in a session. Try it out, the hops profile of this beer is very intersting.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ZimZamZoom,4,"This is an interesting chestnut/auburn color, not much of the red edges I expect to see in an AIPA. Clear and pretty nonetheless. White head is medium in size and staying power.  A strong citrus hop nose, some piney earthy notes in the background that make a brief acquaintance with caramel malt. the taste is orange citrus and some hop spice. Some balance here with sweet malt, but the hops are king and they remind you over and over.  Body is nice, carbonation is perfect. This is a nice drinkable 7.2% AIPA. But lets face it. Line this up with Celebration, SNPA, Harvest Ale, etc., and the average BA would be hard pressed to identify which is which is which. You will all argue this point with me because you all have more refined palates, but this is a majorly recycled recipe.  Love the beer, but it is nothing new to me. Still...great beer. Drink it!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Strix,4.03,"Orange-amber, decent head, good lacing.  Smells bready, with piney hops.  Tastes of sweet malt, fresh-baked bread, and piney hops. Balanced, and pine-dominated.  Mouthfeel resinous.  This was solid, but didn't quite live up to my expectations. Of course it followed my first Hopslam, which I thought was phenomenal, so maybe that biased me downwards.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ATPete,4.32,"12oz bottle  Pours a chill hazed clear copper color with a small off white head that leaves traces of soapy sticking on the glass. A welcomed hop aroma filled my nose the second after putting down the bottle cap, the fresh hop scent that booms off of this thing is excellent, pine resin, i dont get too many citrus notes going on here but oh god, this thing screams hops! Good balance is achieved throughout, the sweet malts lay beneath the immense usage of the humulus lupulus for the most part but its slight hint of caramel sweetness in the nose and mid palate, makes the cone attack so much more effective. Lightly herbal, mostly grassy though, its not so much bitter as it is hoppy, if that makes any kind of sense to you, the hop character is like none ive experienced before, it really kicks itself into overdrive a few seconds after the quaff is swallowed, the finish is long and ultra hoppy. Medium in body, bigger than i had initially expected, very bright with carbonation. I expected a different beer when i first heard of (and was tortured by) Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA, honestly i expected a Celebration clone, i was wrong, in a good way, well done Sierra Nevada, i look forward to seeing this one around permanently.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Brew33,3.85,"I'll be honest, I had low expectations going into this. I'm not a huge fan of West Coast IPA's. Generally I think they are 1 note chords but this was nice.  The taste was fairly straight forward. It had a really nice malt backbone. Very crisp, easy to drink. I like the hops in this brew. Similar to Commodore Perry in that the malt has a say in the taste. Slightly grassy, citrusy. Good stuff. Not a blockbuster but a nice, easy drinking beer that hides it's ABV very well.  I will buy this again for sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,drlumps62,4.52,"Since the first announcement of the Torpedo Ale, I have been waiting with baited breath. Maybe, next time I will stay away from the hype. The torpedo press was supposed to eliminate all of the bitterness of the hops while accenuating the full citrus flavor. And while this beer certainly is full of rich hop flavor, there is still a lot more bitterness than I expected. At the end of the day, it is merely a great beer.  A: Poured into 20 ounce glass. Clear copper color. Thin white head. Not much retention. Not a lot of lacing.  S: Full and fruity. Citrus tickles the nose from the light carbonation.  T: Light malt. Bright citrus hops. Raisins? Slight floral hoppiness. Blends the best of flavors from SN's Celebration and ESB  M: Light carbonation gives it a light to medium kind of feel.  D: 7.2 ABV. But again, like all SN beers it will try to talk you into bad things.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,PatrickJR,4.33,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into nonic pint glass.  A - Clear amber. About a finger of off white head rises; retention is moderate to good. Decent lacing.  S - Although good, I'm not picking up as much as I thought I might in this department for an IPA. There's a pleasant piney/herbal/leafy hop aroma but it's a bit subdued. Faint, sweet malt is detecable as well.  T - This wasn't quite the hop blast that I expected (think Anniversary and Celebration) but it is an amazingly balanced brew. Ample fruity sweetness in the beginning with a touch of caramel and suggestions of apricot. The hops really pull through mid palate but there's a firm malt backbone throughout. Hop flavors mostly center on the piney/herbal part of the spectrum with flavors of mint, flowers, tea, and obviously pine. Some fresh cut grass makes its way into a few sips as well. Late palate most of the flavor fades and there is a modest hop bitterness with just a touch of alcohol warmth.  M - Luscious silky, medium body with a perfect medium carbonation. Exquisite for a brew focusing on both the malt and the hops.  D - Fantastic. This brew is all about balance. While I had expectations of something hoppier, what fun would life be if Torpedo was just another Anniversary or Celebration? Everything blends beautifully in this picture, and now that this is a year-round release there will certainly be nights of sessioning Torpedo. Excellent stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,Yetiman420,4.42,"Malty, copper color.  Delightful hoppy aroma. Foamy 1 finger head.  Initial sips - very well done. Exceeds expectations and prior SN IPA attempt. I actually enjoy the malt to hop flavor balance (something I usually avoid).  Nice clean finish.  From the brewery that hooked me on good beer comes a surprisingly good American IPA. Here's to consistently seeing this on tap at average bars and restaurants across the country!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CMW,4.15,"The beer pours a translucent amber color with a large off white head. The head slowly disappears and leaves a nice thin ring that sticks around for the entire time. There is also considerable lacing on the side of the glass. There is a ton of small, tightly packed bubbles that rise to the top of the glass and burst into the head formation.  The nose is filled with citrus flavors such as grapefruit and oranges. There is also the piney notes that you might expect from a Sierra Nevada beer. You can barely detect some malt tones, but the majority of the aroma is hops.  Upfront the citrus taste washes through your mouth and the hops come alive. This taste is not all hops though. There is a nice malt backbone that balances out the flavor. The hops make a resurgence in the finish to add a little bitterness. The beer finishes slightly on the dry side and very clean. Alcohol is well hidden and almost completely untraceable.  This is a very good beer and much creamier than I would have expected for an IPA. It is medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation, but still very smooth.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Certainly worth a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hellbilly,3.77,"bottle from psprings...  pours a perfectly pale copper color with a crazy fluffy creamy off white head. loads of lacy rings are left behind with each sip.  this smells like walking through the pine forests of west virginia... wet rocks, moss, pine trees, dry leaves, earth and faint sweetness in the air.  the flavor is far less poetic and far more maltier than i wanted it to be... it's got orange and grapefruit rinds and pith, pine and hoppy dryness but caramel and maltiness show up to spoil the show. there's a fair amount of bitterness to help out but it can't quite break through. the carbonation is pleasant and quite soft. the body is medium though only from the sugar content... 7/3/7/4/15/3.6",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Mattysox,4.25,"This is a very pretty looking beer; a crystal clear, orange/amber body is topped off with a dense, rocky off-white head that lingers for a long time and leaves great lacing down the glass.  On the nose, it's lots of grapefruit and lemon citrus notes, balanced by a faint whiff of pine, bread and caramel. The flavors follow along with the nose. The flavors are very clean and defined, yet everything tastes harmonious. The hops are very prevalent, but well balanced against the malt. This is not a big California hop bomb, but rather a restrained, well thought out melding of flavors. The mouthfeel is super smooth and even slightly creamy, but the astringency of the hops on the finish still leaves the palate invigorated and ready for the next sip. This is a super drinkable beer, even if the abv is around 7ish. Nothing about this beer jumps out at you, but on the whole it is well-made, delicious and a welcome addition to the SN line.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Spidey13,4.17,"Sierra Nevada Torpedo pours a crystal clear copper color with a big, sticky off-white head. The nose has lots of hops; citrussy, lemony, and piney. Very nice.  The taste is also pretty much all hopes. Lots of spicy hopness. There is some underlying caramel and a smooth bitterness on the back. The mouthfeel is a bit thin. Medium carbonation.  Overall, this is a very easy-drinking beer that hides its 7.2% alcohol, so watch out!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,tzchandler,3.95,"Less prevalent than the green labeled IPA, Torpedo comes in with much more alcohol (7.2%) and heavier copper flavor. Nice aroma of hops but I would hope for a bit more being a hops lover. The Celebration Ale, from the same company, seems to hit the spot more than this beer but still worthy of a place in the fridge and still better than many micro beer IPA II.  This beer slides down easily and has a pleasant long lasting flavor.  Sierra Nevada seems to me to be the only mass beer company that brews excellent beer for ""mass beer"" prices. These guys deserve a big pat on the back. Bravo!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,NoLiberty,4.12,"Pours a light tangerine-orange, subtle warm amber color. A modest white frothy head bubbles up into 1-2 fingers thick. It settles into a light patchy cap that dissipates into almost nothing. Very light lacing, almost none.  Aroma is interesting. Not an overpowering hop bomb, but a smell that is very well blended with the sweet malty backbone. Starts sweet with apple sweet tartness and moves to a middle with melon and tangerines and moves to a light alcohol-malt warmth at the end.  Flavor is very well established and balanced. Flavors of tart fruit, light fresh bready sweetness, subtle spicy pine, and finishes with a brief citrus bite then an aftertaste of lingering bitterness.  Light to slightly medium bodied with slightly bitter feel from start to finish. Subtle sweetness adds a thicker feel but is balanced by nice carbonation that makes for a very drinkable beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,PBoegel,3.39,"Picked up a six pack yesterday at Oak Tree Beverage in New Jersey.  The beer looked excellent on pour, great clarity, nice light amber in color with a dense egg shell white head.  All down hill from there. The beer is good but at best it is a amped up version of SN Pale Ale. Simply nothing about the aroma or flavor matched the presentation of a bold American IPA.  Beer was clean, with some biscuity light toasty malt and a cavalier hop profile.  A solid English IPA with firm bitterness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,SaucyA,4.06,"A - This shit looks like a beer commercial. I mean it. Poured a bottle and a half into my Short's imperial pint, and the 2 finger froth emanates from the top of the glass. A light amber/deep orange brew that has copious amounts of bubbles rising through the clear body. Ridiculous lacing. Fucking ACE.  S - A subdued American IPA. The hops are nice and herbal up front, and a little more citric on the backend. The malt plays a nice role in the smell, adding a light, sweet background for the hops to play around on. Not the usual SN ""C"" profile, but definite west coast vibes.  T - Perhaps I expected a little more out of this, but to me it's good, not great. Mostly herbal, piney hops, with a slightly bitter, dry backend.  M - Quite light with a crisp carbonation.  D - The price is right and the beer ain't bad. Easy drinking IPA, especially with the mouthfeel.  Notes: Not my fave IPA of all time, but not a slouch by any stretch.

Has good slight citrus notes with a full hop oil and hoppy feel and body, a good finish  Mouthfeel- VERY VERY SMOOTH, it has an extremely soft and smooth body that really helps it going down, the mouthfeel is a real strong point of this beer  Drinkability- A very good beer that I would definitely want to try few more times and see how it matches up with some other IPA s certainly worth another look.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T- tastes pretty familiar. maybe like a cross between snpa & anniversary? but with a nice clean noble hop type bitterness at the end. woodsy with a pepper spice also as well as something very grassy & green. lots of burnt grapefruit flavor and toast and pine. pretty much a carbon copy of the aroma but with malt sweetness to keep a great balance. website lists 'citra' on the hop bill, varietal that i haven't heard of but i'll go ahead and 'spect it's the culprit for the cascadesque citrusness. very nice from the people that respect the hop. in a major way.

Pours a medium copper-amber with a pretty white head that has decent retention and above-average retention. Solid carbonation keeps things rolling.  Aroma is a solid IPA hop-heavy mix, with herbal and piney notes first, then an orange peel citrus right behind. Flavor is strongly hopped but a big malty body keeps it from being too bitter. The hops are juniper and pine resin, but not overly so, as the grapefruit sharp/sweet balance keeps it from being over the top.

Appearance: Standard IPA Tangelo Orange, excellent clarity, 1-2 finger off white foam head, good oily sheen, retention and lacing.  Smell: citrus, flowers, dry hopped perhaps. Not overpowering by not one dimensional either. A minor malt component and fruitiness in addition to the hops.  Taste: Initial citrus hop flavor that opens up into a sweet strawberry kiwi note and finishes with a touch of floral hop bitterness. Well done combination of hops and fruitiness.  Mouthfeel: A touch thin for my liking with decent carbonation.  Drinkability: While the mouthfeel is a touch thin for my likes, it adds to the drinkability.

140,30420,bamadog,4.4,"Once again, Sierra Nevada provides an excellent beer. I'm a big fan of their various IPA selections and this one is certainly a great year-round addition.  Appearance: Nice coppery color, hints of deep gold. A one finger head with minimal retention -- faded to a thin lacing that turned in to a faint ring around the surface. Moderate carbonation throughout the glass.  Smell: Piney and bitter and a slight tinge of citrus in there as well.  Taste: Bitter hops all the way with a strong presence of pine. I would say there is a miniscule hint of grapefruit in there as well, but the pine is definitely the dominant flavor on the taste buds. Fairly strong aftertaste. As the glass warmed over the course of the beer, I found the presence of alcohol to become much more of a factor.  Mouthfeel: Sticky and oily with a potent feeling on the tongue of pins and needles. Leaves the mouth especially dry once it's gone down. A very active beer in the mouth.  Drinkability: I would say particularly high. It's a great beer and I'm not let down. I enjoy the bitterness and the strong flavors so I feel like I'm actually working on something. The ABV isn't listed, but I'd guess a 5.5 - 6% ABV -- I'm feeling a bit of a buzz after one so perhaps not more than two a sitting (three may be pushing it).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smell of sticky, pungent, sweet piney hops, really rich and full. Great aroma. Light silkiness on the tongue that gives way to flavors of lightly toasted grains mingling well with a fair but not overpowering amount of hops.

Touck of bready, biscuity malt under the hops. Overall, the aroma is a little lacking, not as abundant as I expect from the Pale Ale or Celebration.  Beer is a very clear deep gold with a touch of amber in it. Off-white foam starts out about 3"" and slowly falls to a thin fluffy blanket with a lot of lace left on the glass.  The first sip starts out with roughly equal measures piney hop, light caramel, and bread dough. Bitterness builds to a powerful finish with a little malt sweetness hopelessly overpowered. Hops burn the sides of the tongue and provide a sensation of mild astringence.  Medium body, medium carbonation.

140,30420,Gehrig,4.5,"My old standby, the Neil St. Piccadilly, had this in ample quantities looming enticingly at the front display. That's a slam dunk for this guy.  A finger of durable white froth tops a clear golden-brown body in the Yankees pint glass; nice durability and dense lacing leave me quite impressed. Abundant floral, citrusy hops accost the nose with grapefruit, tangerine, and lemon over roasted caramel malt. Rich, complex taste, almost but not quite as malty as it is hopped. Caramel and milk chocolate nicely complement the bold hop content, with Magnum and Crystal supplying fine bitterness with floral citrus. This is excellent IPA, without a doubt.  I was initially iffy about giving the mouthfeel this high a score. My initial sense was that the malt submerged the resiny, chewy hop texture that I love so much. Yet the more I enjoyed Torpedo, the more restrained the malt in fact is, with hops dominating the second half of Torpedo.  Yet again, Sierra Nevada has impressed me with a bold, flavorful beer. Yet again, SN has provided a beer that will be on my radar for future appearances. IPA lovers should revere Torpedo.  Outstanding.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Flows really well into a tasty dry hop flavor.  M - Silky smooth, medium body that froths in your mouth with the decent amount of carbonation that is present.

A few streams of bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. A small amount of lacing.  Aroma is hops and grapefruit. A touch of sweetness is revealed as the beer warms.  First taste is citrusy hops, followed by grapefruit and a bit of sweet maltiness. The beer finishes dry and leaves a taste of pine on the back of the tongue.  Medium bodied and very creamy. Carbonation is perfect.  This is a delicious IPA and I could easily drink a number of these.

140,30420,cswhitehorse,4.03,The Torpedo was a copper color with a ridiculous 3-4 finger foam head that slowly subsided. It had some nice sticky wave like lacing and soft pillow head.  The aroma was piney and citrusy. The taste had a good malt backbone with a crisp dry finish. It reminded me of the Pale Ale just hopped up on the cones. In the mouth it left a mark on the tongue and didn't seem to be overpowering as far as the abv. I am glad I bought the six and pack and will enjoy it tonight.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,sweetbrew82,4.28,"12 oz. into a snifter/ fresh 09  P: Evacuates the bottle light copper in color, and sits a cranberry & orange-infused deep bronze. Eggshell head is more bubbly & frothy showing good retention, finally settling to a bubbled-halo with an island in the middle.  A: Citrusy like oranges, pineapples, and grapefruit with some pine and gobs of caramel. Doesn't detonate upon pour and explode through the nostrils like other hop-explosive DIPA's I've had, but still quite enticing to a hophead nonetheless.  T: Torpedo is a laid back, generously-hopped beer that is clearly striving for at least a little balance. While hops are still headlining the show, the malts are no slouches in the supporting role. Boasting some fresh & vibrant taste sensations of brown sugar-crusted grapefruit rinds, sweet oranges/clementines, a twist of pineapple with a hint of herbal and some pine sap, the hop bill's definitely hogging the spotlight. It's not a palate-obliterating sandblasting of the tongue, but it does provide enough bitterness to temporarily satisfy my addiction. That's because bitter meets a formidable foe in the considerable toasted malt bill that teams up with the caramel & a twinge of toffee that does a great job of counter-punching the hops attack. It does finishes on the dry side, but the caramel rides out all the way through the finish line to complement.  M & D: Notch below being full-bodied, but it's thick, rich, adequately creamy, and very smooth. Drinkability is out of this world, very good session beer that this hophead will be drinking all night long.  Notes: The aroma and smell just aren't explosive enough for me to put it on the top shelf of beers I've had in this category, but its very good brew nonetheless. Bottom line is this, a DIPA with this good of a hop bill at 7.2% ABV for only $8.99 a 6er is a no-brainer! Its a real winner in my book.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,wedge,4.03,"Clear copper with a big, thick head that sticks around as a soapy cap and leaves drippy sheets of lace behind. Flowery, perfumey sweet grapefruit aroma...biscuit and graham cracker-like malts to balance. Sweet rindy citrus flavor. Bitter pine resin, herbal hop oils. Medium bodied and goes down real easy. Yet another good hoppy beer from SN.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jkdrummer,4.7,"Great name for an IPA, and you know, those hops hit you like a Torpedo -- an explosion of floral aroma and goodness but with a bitter punch like being back handed by the ale. Wonderful creamy texture that did not die in the glass. No nasty after taste either -- just the initial blast of flavor and then the subtle sweetness takes over. Highly recommended. I hope it stays around the Puget Sound from now on.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,wescj,4.08,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  Color is burnt orange and crystal clear. The off white head starts with a good two fingers, then reduces to about half an inch of bubbly, mounding head which leaves some pretty chunky lace.  Smells tremendously of citrusy hops, and a piney foundation mixes with some floral notes to render an outdoorsy, subtly earthy, fragrance.  Nice hoppy bitterness without the bite. Slightly roasted malts are smooth and silky, with a touch of sweetness. Has a typical citrus and grapefruit predominance.  Very smooth mouthfeel with a resiny aftertaste. Medium bodied brew.  Pretty drinkable. I'm glad this one made it to GA, and plan to have it in the fridge occasionally.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ncstateplaya,4.13,"After finally arriving in Raleigh I had to pick it up. Unfortunately I only got a sixer, luckily there is much more where this came from. I just hate that I ran out...  It pours a crystal clear dark amber, almost the color of sweet tea. Wow this is clear, nothing suspended in this brew. A nice off-white head formed during the pour, extremely fluffy. Dissipates to a wispy sheet covering the surface. Great lacing left in the glass.  It is quite hoppy in the nose with loads of grapefruit citrusy notes and piney undertones. The citrus smelling hops are predominantly what I smell.  Your tastebuds are enveloped in a great hoppy bitterness from the very beginning. The underlying flavor would suggest grapefruit rind. The malts are very smooth and creamy, almost caramel like.  Medium bodied with good hops and an impressive malt presence. Its creamy almost but the carbonation leaves your mouth feeling crisp. This beer definitely finishes bitter.  I'm so glad it finally made its way to Raleigh, and even happier that SN is keeping it as a year round release. I am very impressed with the Torpedo and do see myself drinking entirely too many in the future.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,saintwarrick,4.08,"Another smooth IPA from Sierra Nevada, this brew pours an orangey amber with a solid sticky white head that leaves some good lace. Aroma is a bit underwhelming, hoppy with a lot of citrus, some pine and brown sugar. Smooth brew, very well balanced as most SN offerings are, not quite as citrusy as Celebration, but there does seem to be a little more fruitiness, some sweeter citrus like tangerine hints all around. Bitterness is a bit higher than Celebration. Finishes easy with a nice hoppy kick.  A very solid brew from SN. It's not as good as Celebration, but this is a worthy alternative.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,kkipple,3.9,"This is a good beer, another above-average offering from our boys at Sierra Nevada. Clear orange, nice lace, looks pretty much like SN Pale. Nothing to complain about... nose is citrus American hops all the way, not in your face, but earthy and pleasing. Refreshing. Tastes like a malted-up SNPA, (although less heavy than Celebration) with a different (and tasty) hop bill. Crisp, wet, refreshing, bitter-orange and lovely.  Easily quaffable, Torpedo is another fine brew from the Wizzards of the Coast out in Chico.

140,30420,BWMKappaSig,3.8,"12oz bottle served in pint glass  Appearance: A very crystal clear orange with a 1/4 cream head. THe lacing is quite lovely as it goes down.  Smell: Citrusy and grassy to the extreme, this almost could be confused with something like Ruination or Maximus. Very little malt evident, and the hops, despite their fruitness, do give a subtle pine note.  Taste: Very aggressive citrusy and piney hops and very little malt presence. The balance isn't quite there, but it also doesn't have that sheer punch of hops you get from some of the bigger beers. The description of a ""1.5"" IPA sells it pretty well.  Mouthfeel: The hops leave that beautiful oily residue on the tongue and it's bite is quite crisp.  Drinkability: Already known for their hoppier ""American"" pale ale, this kicks up the standard that much further. Its not quite monster enough to play with some of the big hop bombs, but it's certainly getting there. Went amazing with my turkey sandwhich, but I can't imagine wanting to down a lot of these in a row.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,roadhouse,4.38,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appears a clear orange color with a one inch off-white head. It sinks to a cap and retains very well. Leaves perfect sheets of lacing down the side of the glass as well.  Aroma is very nice and citrusy, lots of grapefruit, some tangerine, a very small amount of tropical fruit. A bit of eathiness too. The malt character compliments and balances the hops very well. It's lightly sweet with a touch of biscuit.  Taste is citrusy up front with the grapefruit dominating alongside a prominent tangerine character. The tropical fruit present in the aroma comes through in the taste as well, more so in the finish with an earthy/spicy character. The malt sweetness doesn't really get it's own moment but creates a perfect balance between against the hops.  Mouthfeel is medium, very smooth and creamy with a bit of crispness towards the finish.  This one was even better than I was hoping to be. I can easily see this becoming one of my go-to IPAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,rowew,4.17,"Presentation: Normal Sierra Nevada style label, but in a dark teal color. ABV is 7.2 %, date code is cryptic.  Appearance: Pours a fairly typical orangish color, clear with a thin head, fades quickly but leaves a bit of lacing.  Smell: Piney hops, a bit of a bready malt.  Taste: Plenty of hops and a nice level of bitterness. Definitely highly drinkable.  Overall impression: The obvious comparison is to Celebration, which is one of my favorites. This one is definitely a keeper as well, maybe just a touch less malt than Celebration, but I haven't had them side by side to be sure. The six pack certainly won't last long.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,HopEnthusiast,4.03,"This one was definitely all American, as the pour looked clear copper in color and the smell was that of grapefruit, orange peal, and squeezed lime. The citric aspects continued into the taste with bitter peals of these fruits making a prominent appearance. The malt backbone was solid and caramelized, but the hops were large and in charge. Sticky mouthfeel and long drawn out aftertaste made me wonder if this was straddling the line between an IPA and a DIPA, but with the well hidden alcohol and unpublished ABV, I am not certain. This torpedo hits the mark dead on.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Reagan1984,4.5,"Man, I am enjoying this beer. I bought three and finished the first one about 20 minutes ago. Just popped the second and time for a review.. I really enjoyed the first... so I expect some good things here.  The head here just like the first was very aggressive.. three fingers + with not a very aggressive pour. Lost of structure and excellent retention.. The Lacing is just insane.. All over the glass. Beer is a reddish amber with perfect clarity. Slight carbonation is visible. Nice looking beer.  Aroma is fantastic. Fresh and just a blast of fresh hops. Mostly citrus and juicy.... Slight spice as well.  What a well balanced IPA. I really love this. Certainly showcases the hops as it should, but with enough of a malt backbone. Starts more citrus/grapefruit.. The middle has some nice grain flavors and spice... Then finishes with a bit of pine.. A little of everything. Works very well.  Mouth feel is bright, fresh and medium bodied.  Totally drinkable and refreshing. This is that you think of when you try to picture a fresh/bold American IPA...  Wonderful beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Longstaff,3.36,"With all the talk of citra hops and their torpedo technique of hopbacking/dryhopping I was expecting something a little more aromatic. Reminiscent of Nugget Nectar as an Imperial Amber but with a bit more grassy/earthy middle and a bit more bitterness to balance the sweetness.  But as an American IPA, Extra IPA, or 1.5 IPA, it is lacking the hop balls necessary to satisfy the hophead. Has more of a IPA profile that will sell well to the masses, but will dissapoint the hopheads out there. I would like to see more hop aroma and quite a bit more bitterness to help ride out the sweet malt character for me to buy on a regular basis. Medium/thinnish body is welcome, but incongruent with the sweet malt character.  Might be something I pick up on the way to a party or something, but nothing that will satisfy my hop jones.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

A: Bright amber-orange with solid 1-2 finger stick oatmeal-colored head with plenty of retention and lacing.  S: Delicious citrus rind and light pine and spruce are coupled with pretty hefty amounts of caramel and pale malts  T: Much more of the citrus and pine hops flavors with a less substantial malt contribution than I would have thought from the scent.  M: Typical low-carbonation, high-acid IPA with medium aftertaste.

There is a very strong malt flavor that really mellows out the hop. Hop tends to come through a bit in the end. Mouthfeel has some thickness and chewiness. Great drinkablity for this one.

Smell- To be honest not as pronouced as i thought it would be. Subtle floral hops, hints of sweet malty background but it didn't really blow me away.  Taste- Wow! very tasty sweet at first with a subtle bitter kick that hits the back of your palate.

The hops seem very fresh, rather assertive too.  m: Medium body, leaves a sticky resiny hop oil layer on the tongue.  d: Solid stuff. SN waited 28 years to make a new year-round beer.

Very nice smells coming from this one, and it's pretty strong too, I smelled it at soon as I popped the top.

""Conn, bring 'er about! Load forward torpedo tubes! Green Label! Flood tube one! Open outer doors! Match bearings and fire!""  With a muted whoosh it's Torpedo away, and the 'weapon' goes active immediately. A huge cap of pale beige foam mushrooms above a clear copper-amber body twinkling at its peripery with a thin trim of gold. The copious foam is fed by numerous streamers of active carbonation, and relaxes very slowly as it sticks thick bands and webby chunks of lacing onto the glass.  The namesake proprietary deadly-sounding dry-hopping doodad seems to work just fine, as the aroma of the drink is a citrus-hop perfume grounded in rich light caramel. Crisp lemon, mild lime, a touch of bitter grapefruit rind, and the sweet freshness of orange blossoms tingle atop a malty backbone that seems just a bit more savory than it does sugary.  The taste is mild and sweet with a surprisingly-rich and hefty dose of dark-toasted malts. Hop flavors are mild and juicy; a brief pine-resiny stab of bitterness is crisp and quite manageable. The fruity notes take a back seat to the chewy dark toffee cereal backbone that forms the core of the flavor profile, and a bit of savory malt syrup lingers in the finish.  ""Torpedo inbound! Sound collision! Brace for impact!""  Sporting an explosive 7.2% ABV that is well-hidden at the darkest depths of the drink, Torpedo is on the full side of medium-bodied with slick feel and nice carbonation.

140,30420,TheycallmeTim,3.73,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an American pint glass. Label calls it a ""Big"" American IPA and tells me something about u-boats and hops...or something.  Anyway, pours up in that oh-so-comforting consistent Sierra Nevada way: every one of their beers, even the porter, has given me two fingers of mellow dense foam, in this case white. Plenty of cottony sheets come down the glass throughout the tasting, and the body is another signature reddish-caramel, just a twinge more brown than an amber. Unless you're an absolute gimp I'm pretty sure you can get two solid fingers that won't quit on a pour.  For such a big IPA I was expecting more on the nose. The Harvest Ale release, in the big bottle, yielded much more in the way of hop aromas for me, with a huge citric and floral bouquet. This emphasized much more grapefruit and lemon, and in particular the non-flesh parts of the fruit, like the zest or the seed, the parts with all the oil, rather than the juice, in it. One thing that was fantastic on the nose was the creeping thin sweetness of crystal malt. Lent a neat sugar cookie dimension to the bright hop notes. I also got some more resinous notes on this that suggest a piney palate.  This goes from a suggestion to a shout when you drink the beer. Lots of great parching conifer needle goodness on the back end of this poppy. Enough to really wallop you into another sip--I drank this much more quickly than usual, so I don't really know how this changes with warming. In the front and middle you get more of those grapefruit oil/seed extract flavors along with a little clementine or tangelo or some other dark skinned orange (maybe tangerine?), followed by a soft wash of biscuity light sweet malt that forms the backbone of the flavor profile. Exceedingly well structured for the level of hops in this.  Mouthfeel as always is smooth, rich, and creamy. The brewers at SN get my vote for best mouthfeel out of any American at least brewery. Impeccable. Drinkability was average to me just because that much pine wears this drinker out. I feel like Jim the Hacksaw Dugan has taken his white pine plank and walloped me on either side of my tongue.  I liked the Harvest Ale better, but then again that was the beer that made me realize hops were special, so saying I like it less ain't saying much. This is still a worthwhile IPA I'd recommend checking out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Gueuzedude,3.9,"A solid pour into my 25cl tulip glass nets me a four-finger thick, frothy, light tan colored head. The beer is an amber-copper color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich copper color when held up to the light. The aroma is nice and hoppy, but still has a light crystal malt edge to it as well. The malt lens some biscuit-like notes and a touch of caramel; this last melds with the citrus hop components that are the most noticeable part of the beer. Notes of grapefruit, lemon zest, a bit of herbal grassiness, spruce tips and a touch of pine seem to define the hop aromatics; actually this smells a lot like Meyer lemon, it is surprisingly lemony compared to many an American IPA.  The carbonation provides a solid fizziness, though this is not over-carbonated. The beer has a light crystal malt sweetness to it that is substantially dried out by the biting hop character. This has an ample bitterness to it that is noticeable from the biting through to the lingering finish of each sip. The hop flavor has quite a bit of sharp, herbal notes to it that leans a touch towards fresh pine needles; this is pretty well met by essential citrus oil notes that remind me of grapefruit, tart tangerine zest and orange zest. This has a nice biscuit like malt character to it that helps to dry out the finish just a little bit more. This has a touch of malt body to it, but is still quite quaffable and light enough to be a drinking IPA (though the alcohol percentage may tell you otherwise after a couple).  This is a solid IPA offering from Sierra Nevada. It is perhaps a little sharp, slightly astringent, and a little more herbal focused than I might prefer, but it is damn tasty. I still prefer the slightly more malt balanced Celebration as it brings out the fruity-citrus character from the hops a bit more than this beer does. Despite the noticeable malt presence, this is definitely an aggressively hopped IPA.  Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Pale malts are also found in the mix and cut through the hops nicely with a waft of soft caramel  T: I am gonna go out on a limb and say this one of my favorite Sierra Nevada brews. This guy has it all and seems very well balanced. Caramelized malts (almost biscuity) make a stronger showing on the palate, more so than the nose, and a great sturdy profile. Now, the hops are harmonious and consist of floral, pine needles, and a mild grassiness. In addition to this are citrusy hop notes that give way to sweeter tangy oranges and make a perfect companionship with caramel flavors. Another thing, is that this brew has flavors that remind me of a good dry-hopped beer  M: somewhat bubbly but makes the taste buds feel alive.

140,30420,scruffwhor,3.15,"Looks like orange peekoo iced tea. Nice two finger head right after the pour. his falls to a thin film, then island of foam, and hardly any bubbles. Very tea like and citrusy hops. The malt smell like maybe some water crackers. Orangey rinds, a little mint and maybe some biscuit malts. Plus a slight metallic twang. Stingy, bitter palate that could use just a little more malt for some better balance.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jpiper,3.71,"Pours a nice caramel amber, with a 1cm white head atop a half bottle pour. Reduces quickly to a thin bubbly layer.  The smell is a touch medicinal, with sweet malt. Smells strongly of pine.  It's quite bitter - maybe moreso than the Dogfish Head 60 minute. Plenty of pine on the palate as well.  Nice, smooth, and clean. Well carbonated.  Decently drinkable. Maybe a bit too bitter. Low enough ABV to not slow you down too much.  Not a bad beer. I'll see how the full 6-pack sits with me. I'd go for Bell's Two Hearted any day of the week for a year-round IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jamesdantes13,3.78,"Dark amber colored brew with a thick white head that dissipates quickly.  Smells of a very bitter piney aroma with a citrus backbone.  Citrus and bitter taste upfront, followed by a medium, bready body. A little buttery in the back and carbonation adds a nice crispness. Very drinkable for what it is: a hoppy IPA, although balanced compared to other west coast IPA's.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,schellsbeer,3.77,"Maybe it is just because I finished the Bigfoot but this one didn't have the same reaction.  The bottle says that it is an Extra IPA but for me, it wasn't even an IPA....Maybe a minor IPA. When drinking it, I thought to myself several times....did Sierra Nevada forget to add the Hops to this beer? It is there but very mild.  Clean looking beer. Very Fresh. Almost a light carmel watery look to it. 1/2 inch head that sticks around to form a nice lacing all the way down.  Taste is the downside for me....just above average for Sierra Nevada. There are regular IPAs that are more hoppy and bitter than this ""EXTRA"" IPA.  Somewhat of a disappointment from a fantastic brewery. Oh well....I didn't say that it was bad....puts to shame most IPAs out there but nothing that is over impressive.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,scifan,4.18,"Finally was able to score some of this on Friday. I've been waiting on this one patiently ever since I heard about it. Poured a nice golden amber into my pint glass with a two finger head. Leaves some nice lacing as I drink. Some nice hop aromas and some sweet maltiness and alcohol. Lovely citrusy smells. I thought the nose was a little lacking as this is an extra IPA but what is there is good. Very balanced flavor nothing really overpowering the other, nice hoppiness followed by the malts. Very drinkable IPA. Doesn't have quite the bite of Celebration but still a great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mtbbaboon,4.33,"I went into the beer store to pick up some Celebration Ale and was thrilled to find this one, as I had been looking forward to trying it. It does not disappoint.  Pours a copper color with moderate head. Leaves some nice lacing on the glass and a light layer of foam atop the beer. Strong hop and citrus tones and a slight hint of alcohol. A nicely balanced aroma, as I expected more of a hoppy aroma with this being an ""extra"" IPA. The taste follows the aroma. Pine and hops up front give way to the citrus and bitterness. Noticable grapefruit presence, and of course nice and hoppy, though the hops are not overdone. Medium bodied mouthfeel and leaves a little stickiness in the mouth. Drinks real easy. Another winner from Sierra Nevada!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,beerogre,4.28,"Another winner from the Sierra Nevada stable.  The first few sips reminded me a lot of Celebration, but then after the next few there's a bit of a fork in the road and it branches off on its own. Grapefruit flavor very dominant, and as ever, that clean, crisp, refreshing trademark Sierra Nevada backbone taste is present. Which all makes me feel like I'm stood on top of a mountain on a beautiful clear day, dressed solely in my underpants taking in the magnificent view, breathing in the fresh clear air and drinking copious amounts of the clean Sierra Nevada spring water that makes their beers taste so fine.  The 7.2% abv takes this out of the session beer class, but it won't have any problems establishing itself at whatever weight it fights!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,KarlHungus,4.06,"This beer pours a clear amber-orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes very slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of a forest of pine resin, grapefruit, and hints of flowers. The taste has more grapefruit than the aroma, lots of pine, and a sharp, clean, lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a mighty fine IPA, that I will certainly drink again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,leif86,4.35,"A: Fingers width plus of a dark cream colored head. Large sized bubbles make up the head, but still rather creamy. A nice ring stays around the glass after the head disappears and lacing follows you all the way down to the bottom. The body is dark orangey-amber color that is crystal clear when you hold it up to light.  S: That glorious fresh hop aroma - definite floral and earthiness hop character with some spice as well. In the background is hidden a little sweet malt.  T: Deliciously hoppy without being taste bud killingly bitter. Strong grapefruit taste from the hops that lingers for quite a while. Add to that some tastey citrus and pine notes. Little sweet towards the end, but it's all about the hops, baby.  M: Very good level of carbonation, slightly sticky.  D: It's obviously full-on hop flavor and aroma, but the COMPARATIVELY low bitterness make this beer exceptionally drinkable for its style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,smanders,4.45,"Served from a bottle into a British pint glass - 7.2% ABV.  Appearance - Dark amber with a pillowy head. Lacing showed all the way down the glass.  Smell - beautiful hoppy nose without as much sweetness as I expected.  Taste - smooth, vice biting, citrus, spice, and pine flavors...initially. Oddly the more you imbibe, the spicier the hops became. There's malt in there, you just really have to try to taste it.  Mouthfeel - medium body which makes drinking very easy.  Drinkability - My new favorite. At least that I can get for a good price ($8.99/6'er) in my area.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,StarlightSeraph,3.98,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  Appearance: Pours a crystal-clear golden-orange, with a three finger frothy white head. The head subsided leaving a blanket of lacing on the sides of the glass. Nice. Very nice.  Smell: Grassy and piney hops. A bitter/sweetness in the background I couldn't exactly place. Almost something of a woodsy scent. The barest hint of a citrusy scent.  Taste: A decent hop bite right away, intermixed with the alcohol. Even though this is only 7.2 ABV, its definitely noticeable behind the hops. After that though, there wasn't really too much. No malt base, just a lingering hop taste. The taste did linger for quite some time.  Mouthfeel: Creamier than usual for an IPA. High carbonation accents the hop bite.  Drinkability: A solid, if one-dimensional, IPA. Outside of the hops I couldn't really detect anything else. I wish I had a Celebration handy, so I could do a side-by-side. It's a quality brew, but there's nothing that really makes it stand out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Terp96,4.5,"Holy crap, this is one hell of a beer. I have been waiting for this and it did not disappoint.  The pour is a clear deep amber with a finger thick, off-white head. Very clean looking. A shade or two lighter than Celebration.  Smell is all hops. Pine, grapefruit and everything else. Wonderful bouquet.  The taste is insane. A hop bomb for sure. Prickly pine hits you up front with a nice, oily hop, very dry finish. Malt is there but only for balance as that is not the point of this beer.  Mouthfeel is exceptional. Very balanced for a beer so heavy on the hops. Prickly and dry up front with a sweeter oily finish. This beer has it all.  Drinkability is exceptional as well. The 7.2% is well hidden as the beer does not come across too hot at all. The only threat to drinkability is Torpedo's ability to eventually destroy your palate.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,katan,3.61,"12 oz bottle into a pint  A - Gold to dark gold in color. Lots of bubbling and carbonation. head formation is fairly strong, and snow white. The head dissipated down into a light film.  S - A fresh hop nose - floral and grapefruit in nature. Some grassy background. Overall not that strong.  T - Starts off malty and sweet - certainly not overdone with the bittering hops. Mid-stream develops some of the hops spiciness, with a hair of bitterness. Finishes with the grassy hop note that the nose detected. The real bitterness here is in the aftertaste.  M - Moderate to thick body - carbonation is noticeable. Somewhat stinging on the tongue. Certainly leaves behind a very sticky residue.  D - Easy to drink. ABV is masked big time (7.2%). This one could sneak up on you. Only downside is that the edge of the grassy hop finish is becoming somewhat monotonous.  A solid new offering from SN.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,wheatyweiss,3.54,"Poured into a 12 oz. tumbler.  Pours a medium honey or a dark straw. Thick soapy head that almost towers the glass combines with sticky, sticky lace that cover the glass. Looks very appealing.  Nose is floral, grassy hops. Not piny but floral and grassy. I get a smallish malt whiff that does not in any way stand up to the hops.  Flavor is floral hops up front. Peppery and resinous, they give a very nice American hop flavor. These are good, fresh hops! There is a very nice floral character that stands out. This is a good HOP specific beer. Unfortunately the malt suffers. There really is none. Might be because the hops overpower, could be little sparge, but the malt is just not standing up. The hops are so delicious, I wish there was a balance. I did drink one too cold and oddly enough, there was MORE malt balance when the beer was cold, which is weird.  Mouth is nice and thick and viscous. Oily and a good presence. Carbonation is perfect.  Over all, even though there is not much balance, this beer appeals to my tastes and I will say it is one of my top five AIPA's, very refreshing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Wildman,4.13,"This beer poured a clear copper gold color and formed a nice huge off white foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, grapefruit, pine and a hint of caramel. The flavor was of hops, grapefruit, pine and pepper. The body was fairly light with a bitter, astrigent finish. A nice beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,zeff80,4.27,"A - Poured out a clear, copper color with scattered, small bubbles. It had a foamy, off-white, two-finger head that left great looking rings of lace.  S - It smelled of tons of pine notes with citrusy tones. It had a subtle malty aroma.  T - It tasted of bitter hops and burnt toast maltiness. It balances out more as it warms up.  M - It was crisp and sharp with a slightly dry finish. A medium-bodied beer.  D - This is a very good IPA. I am glad it finally made it out our way.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,philipquarles,3.73,"Pours a clear copper with an eggshell head. The hop presence is evident in the towering stature of the foam and it's resilience. Nice lacing. Aromas of piney and citric hops are very forward, but they don't quite drown out a hint of sweet, biscuity malt in the background. Piney bitterness hits again on the palate, though there's again a fair amount of sweet malt to back it up. Really heavy tasting. Thick feel. Even though this isn't my style--bigger IPAs have always been a little too ""in your face"" for me--this is one that I'd definitely drink again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,trevormiller,4.15,"Took a couple weeks for this one to appear on the store shelves near me, finally found it at my local kwik-e-mart.  A: An almost glowing light copper with a decent head.  S: Hops! Big clean aromatic scent, some pineapple.  T: Very hoppy but not overly bitter. 7.2% is an excellent strength; not watery and not a huge bombshell of a beer. Mouthfeel is all up front, a nice burn on the tongue with little burn on the way down. It feels to me like it's slightly up the curve from the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale on the hops, but with a very similar overall flavor profile.  D: I will be drinking this whenever I need something that's nice and hoppy but don't want to fall over drunk.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Monkeyknife,4.06,"Poured from the bottle a deep, clear red-amber with a frothy two-fingered beige head.  Bright aroma of piney, floral and citrus hops, along with some fresh pineapple.  The taste is big and hoppy with pine and citrus hops, caramel malts, and bread. The caramel malts linger through the finish.  Medium bodied, smooth and slick, with a moderate carbonation.  Overall, a very nice IPA from the folks at Sierra Nevada. So drinkable, so fresh, so hoppy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BDIMike,4.1,"Pour has a golden clear color. There is very little carbonation, but a very nice white head that sticks to the glass throughout the entire drink. Nice hop smell in the nose. There is a huge amount of hops in here. Very nice citrus smell to it in the grapefruit variety. Very solid taste for this extra ipa. The hops taste very fresh and strong with great citrus tastes, but they are nicely balanced out by a pine taste. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. A good thickness for an IPA, but it is nicely smooth all the way. Drinkability is very nice for an IPA. Lots of strong tastes in this selection, but they all have a nice balance with each other. This is a great beer with a solid taste that I could easily take down a six pack of in a sitting.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,mithrascruor,3.83,"12 oz. bottle poured into a mug.  Appearance: Pours a clear amber-orange color with a few big bubbles floating up. 1/3-in creamy off-white head dissipates into a film and leaves decent lacing.  Smell: Minimal aroma with a bit of hops, some pine, and malts. Nothing special here.  Taste: A generally mild taste (spicyness-wise) for an IPA. Malty base with somewhat piney hops. Somewhat lingering finish of spicy hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with light carbonation. Slightly crisp finish.  Drinkability: ABV seems decent. Could work as a shorter session beer.  A nice IPA that fills the gap between the very crisp ones and those which are rather pine-sap-like. Would get this again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,kaseydad,4.22,I first had this on tap last summer in Monterey at Knuckles and I was blown away! Never even knew it existed and was very happy to hear it was being bottled this year.  Nice foamy pour which holds well throughout the session.  Nice fruity (apple/grapefruit) smell with hints of pine.  Very smooth taste for an IPA which ups the drinkability. Alcohol is masked extremely well.  Very well done by SN and happy this is now a year around beer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Vineyardselite,4.22,"Heard about the release and tasted this guy a month back and finally have it in the store....waiting for it, and worth the wait, an outstanding beer, one the best priced 6 pack I have in the store!  Has a blistered orange, yet clear appearance, wonderful medium head and a fair enough lacing, typical for a S.N.  Wonderful pine, earthy, grassy hops hit you as you open the bottle, just a womderful aroma, love it. Almost reminded me of their ESB that I have too! Hints of bitter fruits also linger in the air with that earthy smell.  The taste is even more wonderful than the aroma, wonderful citrus hops hits your tongue, great bitterness that fades away with a kind of sugar taster that comes into play at the end.  Over healthy amount of carbonation, that I thought could have been a bit less mellow!  A great beer overall, one their better ones!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

I would go after more of this. I thoroughly enjoyed it and think most hopheads will love it too.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,CHILLINDYLAN,4.5,"A: Brilliant clear copper with a small white head that dissipated quickly. Beautiful sticky lacing.  S: Floral, Pine, Citrus, Tropical Fruits... the hops are crazy!  T: Tingly bitter hops, hops, and more hops. A caramel bread like malt taste in the background. But the hops are overpowering (just the way i like em), Big fresh pine and citurs and tropical fruits and floral tastes.  MF: Medium bodied, dry bitter extremely hoppy brew.  D: Hoptastic! Love this one, thank you Sierra Nevada for making a great new year round IPA, I will be buying this often. The Hop Torpedo is a great invention, used with full cone hops, it gives it a burst of fresh hop taste that is more intense than normal dry hopping and does not add much extra bitterness. And I love the new hop strain, Citra, it has some really exotic flavors, and pairs nicely with the Magnum, Chinook, and Crystal. A great XIPA as they dub it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,drgonzo3705,4.38,A: Very beautiful bright copper colored with a quick thinning head but it leaves some pretty lacing.  S: Mostly floral hop notes with some citrus hiding in the background.  T: Very nice tasting beer. Not too much at first but a nice wave of hops rolls over your tongue as you swallow. More citrusy and piney in the taste.  M: Nice medium body with not too much carbonation but plenty of hop oiliness.  D: Yet another quality brew from Sierra Nevada! Drinkability is pretty high as far as I'm concerned. Very clean drinking IPA with plenty of hoppiness that won't let you down.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,HappyBivouac,4.68,"This must be pretty darn fresh at this point. poured into a chalice.  a gorgeous crystal clear amber pour, bit of an off-white head. nothing huge. looks about how I expected it to. (I expected it to look tasty!) Smells of heavy grapefruit, little bit of pine hops. more sweetness than i expected! or the perception of sweetness anyway. the malts actually do come through as somewhat robust and biscuity, but overall it isn't an extremely fragrant beer.  what the heck is this! this is one hell of a unique IPA and I like it. biscuit and caramel malts up front with a pretty strong sweetness. flavorful hops burst open in the middle. finish is a nice slow mellowing out and blending of the hops and caramel malts. a wonderful earthy, sweet, bitter, juicy, robust and complex flavor. the feel is somewhat chewy with minimal carbonation.  hell, this is great! I'm very happy about this release and the fact that it's going to be year-round. I'm not a big fan of huge hop bombs--this is a well-balanced, refreshing beer yet still bursting with flavor.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,SaCkErZ9,4.44,"Emerges from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass a clear, light amber color. Small white head with some lacing but the head leaves rather quickly.  Aroma is wonderfully hoppy. Plenty of citrus; grapefruit, orange, lemon peel. The malts lend a hand in the caramel department but I like how the hops steal the show with this one.  I am not sure how SN could outdo their pale ale but this gives the pale ale a run for the money. Hoppy, bitter, slightly malty, citrusy, crisp and clean.  A wonderful beer. Hops are certainly the forte of Sierra Nevada. I loved this beer and hope to have it again. Easy drinker, sessionable, not much to dislike about this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Hautacam,4.7,"Great looking amber with a foamy head and tons of lacing that go all the way to the bottom. Smells like a pine forest. Taste is initially sweet carmel malt , then the piney and citrusy hops kick in with a bang. The result is a hop candy bomb....in a good way. You've got to like them sweet and bitter;.. the mouthfeel is just about perfect...high side of medium....good carbonation. Each sip just makes me want more.

T-Delicious. Starts out with a strong malt sweetness, then pine hops kick in with a strong bitter earthy hop finish.  M-Medium bodied and a bit oily.

140,30420,bcm119,4.32,"The newest year-round Sierra pours a coppery amber color with a fine white head. Clean, pithy citrus hop aroma with hints of sweet caramel malt.  Typical Sierra prickly carbonation. Short lived but supple malt sweetness; plenty of hops, up front, middle, and in the finish: a well rounded punch of bittering and finishing hops. The ""extra"" could refer to the minty hop resin that coats the tongue and lingers pleasantly on past the finish. Not a trendy, tropical fruit hop profile, but nice and bitter with some good citrus flavors. Malt isn't as lean as I expected, but serves as a nice balance to the bittering hops. A well rounded, balanced IPA with no obvious flaws.  A nice quaffer for hop lovers, although the abv is a bit high for a serious session. Very tasty, I've warmed up to this as possibly my favorite SN beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,dancinwillie,3.48,"A bronze pour, reveals amber highlights. Topped by a thick, tight white head. Very active carbonation, from the looks of it. Very clear, no haze.  Smell is mainly mellow citrus, and some biscuit aroma.  Good hopping up front, citrusy and fresh tasting. Herbal flavor in a smaller amount. Not picking up any pine flavor though, despite what the neck label promises. No matter, still good hop flavor. Following the hops, is a bread/dough flavor, which is quite earthy. It also seems to meld quite well with the hop flavor. Quite tasty.  Overall, a thirst quenching beer. An easy-going drinker, that will satisfy the times when you want more than a SNPA, but can't get ahold of Celebration. Medium bodied, good carbonation, and a long, semi dry finish.  A very good IPA. The ""Extra"" might have some people expecting a Double, or Imperial, but make no mistake, this is in the realm of IPA, nothing more. And as such, with those expectations, you'll find a down to earth refreshing beer. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,swizzlenuts,4.17,"Sierra Nevada's new IPA is poured with a copper colour with a bit more of a brown tint. It comes through mostly as a dark red. When poured there is a bit of an off white head, but it doesn't stick around for a while, and turns into a small right with a slight bit on the top. A bit of a swirl every once in a while gives the beer a bit more of a head. It looks like a pretty standard IPA. Torpedo's nose is very similar to the nose of SN Celebration Ale; piny, resiny, and a slight citrus note comes through. It's primarily dominated by the piny and resiny smells.  When tasting the Torpedo Extra IPA, the hops come through immediately with the flavour and the bitterness. When tasting the IPA, the hops that come through are the spicy, piny hops, and they linger on throughout the drink. At the end there is a nice bitterness with some hints of alcohol. Somewhere in the middle of the drink you get a sweetness coming from the malts and hops; it's a fruity, citrus type flavour that creates a nice backbone to the up front piny hops. The mouthfeel on the beer is great; it's creamy and it has the body I want in an IPA. It's pretty damned drinkable; with a hopping schedule like this, the hops linger in my mouth and make me want to have many of these.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

T: Bitter and hoppy, some pine and citrus, and it finishes a little sweet with some caramel notes. Really good flavor, a very enjoyable beer.  M: Good, but nothing really hits it out of the park for me. I can't put my finger on it, maybe it's carbonation that's a little low?  D: At 7.2% and with carmelly finish on it, the drinkability isn't that high. That's nit-picking, but if they could get these kind of flavors and set the ABV around 6%, that would be awesome.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,clemtig76,4.52,"Picked up a six at Total Wine in Greenville, SC for $7.99. By decoding the freshness date I determined that the beer was bottled on 01/06/09 so it was extremely fresh. Upon opening the stubby brown bottle a wonderful aroma of piney, citrusy hops immediately reached my nose. No other beer I have ever tried smelled so good right after opening the bottle. Poured a crystal clear amber orange color with large off white head with plenty of sticky lacing. Taste is WOW, all about hops, hops, and more hops. Citrus and pine flavors dominate with just enough sweet malt to help balance out the hops bitterness. Think of it as a SN Celebration Ale on steroids.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,djeucalyptus,3.83,"pours a crystal clear but slightly dull light copper hue. An average pour yields a head threatening to overflow - easily two fingers, with great retention and throngs of sticky lacing.  cascade hops. smells a bit like pine trees, a bit like pine sol. a touch of pale malt comes through with some dry biscuit/ hard tack. A good bit of floral hop aroma. and a touch of citrus.  Label says perfectly balanced - my taste buds tell me otherwise. Hoppy. Like a citrusy-pine flavored gusher. A touch of sweetness, then a wallop of pine. A bit of flowers. a bit of pale malt. but definitely hops. The opening has a touch of salt? finish is lingering pine hops.  mouthfeel is disappointing. a touch thin, a smidgen oily, a bit acidic, a wee bit acrid, and just a bit salty. there's a bit of chemical feel to it. Ample fine carbonation, yet it still feels a bit anemic.  hmm. Nice to see a new Sierra. Nice to see an ""extra"" IPA in the mix. Definitely not a bad brew. Nothing amazing, nothing really to write home about. I may be spoiled with a plethora of good IPAs. this one just doesn't quite stand out. It feels like it's missing just a bit of depth. Not quite hitting on all cylinders. That being said, still a decent six pack.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,hopstorm,5,"Wow. I read alot about this beer and couldn't wait to try it. Pours a delicious amber color, nice head. Then the smell of piney resiny hops punch you in the nose. Its like putting your nose inside a bag of fresh hops and inhaling as deep as you can go. I can't stop smelling it as I'm drinking it. The only time I set the glass down is as I write this. The taste is just awesome. I am getting more hop flavor out of this than most DIPAs! For a second I thought it WAS a DIPA. The blend of pine, herbs and citrus really all stand out on their own, while complimenting each other at the same time. Perfect. Nice and easy malt backbone to mellow it all out and make it come together. At $8.99/6 pack, this can't be beat. This is why I drink beer! I can't say enough about it. Good lacing all the way down. I am so happy this is available all year round! If you can get it, the do so! If you like hops, this is for you.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,dfitch81,4.02,"This is Sierra Nevada's first addition to their lineup of perennially available bottled beers since, oh, the dawn of creation. My expectations are high: I have great respect for Sierra Nevada and particularly for their Celebration Ale. The problem with Celebration Ale has always been that it is one of the best bottled IPAs (one that I would gladly make a staple) but it is only available for about a third of every year. So I'm looking to Torpedo to be the beer I want when I can't have Celebration. I do not expect Torpedo to BE Celebration: it is hopped using a different technique, albeit one that the brewers at SN developed in an attempt to brew their Celebration Ale more economically. So, how did Torpedo turn out?  Quite good. Hop flavors are very pronounced, as in Celebration. The difference is that piney notes are far more assertive here than in Celebration, where the hops' grapefruitiness predominates. This is not to say that the pine has blotted out the grapefruit; rather, the pine goes center-stage early in the taste and mellows to grapefruit and some herbal spiciness. My personal preference is usually for the more dominant grapefruitiness exhibited by Celebration, but the nice thing about Torpedo is that the pine and grapefruit both get a chance to shine. In many hoppy beers the hop profile falls more heavily on one side or the other - pine or grapefruit. Here there is balance. Very nice.  I'd have to say that this beer's only real downside is the high ABV, which at 7.2% makes it less sessionable. All in all, though, I say the brewers deserve a pat on the back. Torpedo is truly a worthy addition to the Sierra Nevada stable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,illidurit,3.75,"12 oz bottle to pint glass. Golden amber with a beige head. Aroma is dripping with C hops, mostly grapefruit notes. Smells like they used pale malt and no caramel malt. Flavor confirms this, as it's basically a hop showcase. Tons of zesty pine needles and a semisweet citrus note. Good bitterness but some astringency too. Welcomed dryness helps the drinkability. This is pretty much a bigger, more complex, much more enjoyable SNPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Poured into a pint glass  A: One thing I've noticed is that it's remarkably similar to the SN ESB in appearance. It is a clear burnt orange color, but it has a large head and decent lacing.  S: Pine hops dominate the smell but it is not overpowering; I can pick up a small hint of grapefruit  T: I was expecting the taste to be all hops from the smell, but it's nothing of the sort. You can taste the citrus hops right when the beer hits the tongue, but the bitterness fades away while a sugar cane taste rises. Overall a slightly bitter finish.  D: I'm glad a picked up a six pack rather than a single. This beer is a solid IPA. I could easily see myself having three of these in a sitting; especially on an outdoor outing. Overall, it's a great beer, and I'm glad SN bottled this. It is one of their better beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S Mmmm, hops, sweet smell in 2nd smell. Smells great!  T Very hoppy. Completely matches the IPA profile. Very slight sweet malt. Good taste, but not great.  MF Good mouth feel, a little acidic on the tongue at end. Is that the hops bitter creating that?  D Not the best IPA I've had but I've had a lot of IPA's. Its missing something... some depth in flavor that I usually attribute to malt sweetness. I could easily drink 2, maybe 3 in one sitting.  I'll probably re-review this beer after I let the fact that SN released a new year-round. I'm afraid that I may be harder on SN that my other local craft beers.

Trademark Sierra Nevada labeling.  12oz bottle poured into my hi tech Sam Adams glass....  A - Gives the impression of freshness. Absolutely clear, lots of bubbles rising quickly to the top. Head is milky white, not too big for a rough pour. settles to about 1/8"". Deep orange color. lacing doesn't seem to stick  S - Expected more out of the nose of this beer. It is mild pine and citrus. No real hint of malt.  T - No real hint of malt in the taste either. Plenty of hop in the taste. Lemon-pepper bitterness throughout. Not much pine in the flavor. Tastes hoppier than it smells. Very bitter finish  MF - Medium bodied, very dry finish. Carbonation everywhere.  D - At 7.2% a strong beer by SN standards. At $9.50 a sixer, a bit pricey especially when compared to SN Pale Ale. It is light enough bodied where you could get through a few of these.  Overall, It is like an extra bitter SN 25th anniversary. I would like to have it with a little more balance.

140,30420,SFLpunk,3.56,"12oz brown glass pry-top with a production code but no freshness date.  Appearance: A nice, clear and bright medium orange amber with two and a half fingers of fluffy, bone-white foam. Sticks to the glass and won't let go!  Nose: Lots of grapefruit with a prickly pine needle undertone. A little whisper of malt makes its way through all the citrus hops. It smells like it's going to be fairly dry.  Palate: Aggressive hops. A little prickly both from alcohol and hop bitterness right up front. As that subsides, grapefruit, scorched citrus, dried leaves, candied ginger and a little dried malt towards the finish. The hop flavor is very fresh and almost perfumed tasting. Body is medium to light.  Notes: This beer is really hoppy, dry and pretty bitter. My only complaint is about the mouthfeel...it seems a little watery on the mid-palate. The bitterness is there, but not the texture. A GREAT session IPA, especially for the bucks, but not necessarily something that I'm going to drink all the time. Love to try it on draft sometime.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Proteus93,3.98,"Offered to me, kindly at the Market Street Wineshop here in C'ville.  A: A beautiful, 'perfect' hue of amber. Head, slightly offwhite, tops it in a foamy froth.  S: The aroma is an interesting one... a fine blend of scents - between the soft floral notes and pine forest pungency and a little touch of grapefruit sweet & bitter aromas.  T: An assertive hoppiness, but not as aggressive as many American IPAs can be. It is done quite nicely, with a good balance of hops... it doesn't really require the malty backbone for balance with enough flavour profile and complexity being offered with the hops alone. That's a pleasant surprise. By keeping it a little tame, it works well for this beer.  M + D: Mouthfeel is a little on the mellow side. Carbonation is about right, but it does have just a slight heaviness or note of stickiness to it that I felt could stand to be a little sharper or crisper. It's a very good beer, though, and Sierra Nevada has maintained a good roster with this offering, while sticking to some humble, and simply well crafted beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Really exciting to have this come around finally especially since the hype around a new SN brew has been so great.  The appearance is really good for a 'extra' IPA. I am just so happy this is a year around. Gives a really crisp white head, that dissapears to a half finger head. Bubbles, bubbles all around. It looks like there is a party in this beer, like my tongue is going to the party of the year.  The smell is intoxicating. You know what you smell? HOPS! Lots of beautiful hops. Just so beautiful of a smell that I wish I could have it forever.  The taste is outstanding. Just really kicked me in the seat of my pants. I am so blown away that a brewery that is pretty much a macro can produce this hop brew. Hops, a real butter thick oil taste also that is hard to describe. Smacking my palate around I get this mellow butter bitter dry taste that really is something else. Really great.  The mouthfeel and drinkability are great. Once I had this I just imagined myself at Lake Tahoe roasting in the sun, enjoying a cold one of these. I will buy many many many more and this will be another one of my go to beers. Thanks SN.

It has a subtle, citrus smell. When you taste it, it gives you a solid, but not overwhelming hop flavor that stays with you for a while, then quickly finishes in a neutral, slightly sweet fashion.  I had enjoyed many bottles of the 12th release Wet Hop Ale this past fall, and was hoping this would be as good. I think it is even better, as the hop flavor with this one finishes more cleanly, and the hop bite is a bit more moderate.

Big citrus hop profile, and a lighter version of the nutty malt they use in their harvests. I have to say it's a damn good IPA from Sierra. It's hard to find a beer in SN's line-up that I don't enjoy. At 7.2%, and this tasty it's going to be a tough call between this and Firestone's Union Jack.

140,30420,JBogan,4.23,"Well, here it is. We've waited a while here in Vegas for this beer to arrive, and now there it sits in my favorite brew store.  Pours a really nice looking amber-ish color with a beautiful creamy slightly off white crown. Wonderful and plentiful lacing left in it's wake.  Smells of the usual west coast hops. Now, I'm not much of a hop head but this was rather good. Pine is there, along with the citric qualities we expect.  Taste mirrored the scent. Sierra Nevada's trademark pine is there in full force, joined by a grapefruity-ness which balances out nicely. I honestly can't say it stands apart from a lot of their other offerings, except for a bit more hop bite and bitterness in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel was superb. On the thick side, but with a perfect amount of carbonation to keep it from being dull. Creamy and smooth going down. Me likes this a lot.  If you're an IPA lover, this is one you have to try. Hops are the main attraction, but they are not too over the top as in some beers.

140,30420,KeefD,4.25,"This was bottled on the 13th day of 2009. That means this beer is exactly one week old. Nice and fresh, the way an IPA should be tasted. Pours a brilliant amber orange color with large off white head and lots of sediment floating around. Aroma is hoptastic, plenty of pine and citrus to go around, lightly sweet. Upon the first taste, there is not as much bitterness as I expected. It has some nice citrus flavors, mostly grapefruit and orange peel, maybe some light piny flavor, and it's extremely dry on the finish, with a decent pale malt, cracker-like backbone. Mouthfeel isn't as solid as I hoped it would be, lower end of medium bodied to be sure. This is a highly drinkable IPA. The bitterness is not very harsh on the tongue while still retaining plenty of hop flavor. A very good IPA, and if the price is similar to other SN offerings, I can see this in the regular rotation next to Two Hearted.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Oxymoron,4.52,"Thorpedo? Pours a mostly hazy orange color with a light brownish-red hue to id. A fizzy white head with good retention and lacing through the entire tasting.  The nose is along the lines of a west coast IPA. Big citrus and grassy notes up front. Some minor herbal and spicy hop notes on the back side. No real specific hop comes out as it is blended very nicely. The malt comes out a bit but plays second fiddle to the hops. Some bready and biscuit notes. Very clean yeast.  The taste is very similar. A strong hop presence that is mostly representative in the finish. There is some bittering hops that do balance the finishing hops a bit but does leave a fresh vegi finish. The hops have mostly a citrus and spicy flavor with some minor piney and herbal flavors. The malt comes out a bit more verse the nose and balances well. Could be a bit light for some though, but good. A nice malty backing with some grainy notes and a more sweet caramel representation. Very clean yeast but some minor mineral and chalky taste in the finish.  The body is moderate. A bit sweet but I think it helps balance the hops out nicely. Very nice beer overall. Some minor water effects and a touch nit picky on the soupy hop notes but still very drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Pine scents dominate, with some more subtle notes of citrus fruits and malt.  Upfront the pine dominates. It is bitter - but not overly so - and fantastic. It does have less citrus flavor than I would have imagined from the nose. Great balance exists between the initial bitterness and the underlying malt. As the beer warms a bit, the malty notes tend to come out a bit more. Overall, a great tasting beer.  Great carbonation and very smooth.  Drinkability is exceptional. It is very pleasant and refreshing with great balance. The alcohol is noted, but not so overwhelming as to impede one from drinking 2 or 3. Have a couple, this beer is great.

Excellent clarity, formed a two finger off-white head the collapsed down to half a finger, left some lacing on the glass and is holding up well.  S - Upfront grassy and herbal notes are followed swiftly by a citrusy kick. Pleasing variety of hop aroma and at an appropriate intensity for this style. Citrus aroma seems to be of a grapefruit nature. Picking up some mango too.  T - Much of the hop aroma coming through on the flavor. Grassy and citrusy hit first. Bitterness lingering on into a medium-dry finish. Malt is certainly present but the hops are taking center stage for this show. Bittering level is moderately-high, not what I usually expect from an SN beer.  M - Medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Smooth.  D - When one of America's oldest craft brewers suddenly releases a new beer, it certainly grabs a BA's attention. Sierra Nevada did not disappoint on this. American IPAs - you've got a new kid on the block.  Plenty of hop flavor and aroma, great mix of citrus/herbal/grassy. I'd easily take a few more and am looking forward to the rest of my six pack.

Almost certainly dry-hopped - this one has that ""back of the mouth"" quality that I really love. So I guess I'm a sucker for this brew. Nice and citric, with enough pine to bring a little bitterness.  Malt is mild, bready, and unobtrusive. A little more would bolster the the mouthfeel a bit, which is just medium. Not bad, but a little thin for something you're calling an Extra IPA.  Flavorful and balanced, with good drinkability for style.

Stubby bottle with a forrest green label with yellow trim and logo.  Very nice looking beer, an awesome, thick white head rests atop a brilliant amber brew with golden highlights. Small lobs of lacing.  Aroma is lighter than I was expecting. I was expected more hops! I get light hints of caramel, what little hop aroma I get is rather complex however. Citrus, pine, and a little pungent hops, a touch of yeasty must in back.  Full-bodied texture with a little slickness, bite from carbonation.  This beer is two faced Dr. Jekyll begins with a sweet caramel malts with an awesome, juicy, citrus hop flavor that backs up. The beer is so crisp, sweet, and delicious with a flavor of pineapple. After I swallow the brew there is a delayed effect before an everlasting Mr. Hyde of a piny, bitter finish completely takes over and leaves the palate dry with aspirin aftertaste.  Honestly, I expected this beer to be a year round celebration. Torpedo is much more complex in terms of hop flavor, character, and profile. Torpedo is an interesting and delicious IPA.

Once the bitterness has killed all of my tastebuds, i get a bit of a sweet malt base trying to fight its way through. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Too bitter, imo.

Served with a 2 finger head which had great retention and left lacing all the way down the glass.  Smell and taste were similar. A big presence of citrus hops with a hint of piny hops and a sweet caramel malt back bone. The initial flavor is rich in citrus hops and sweet caramel malt. These two characters balance nicely. The finish at first seemed to be very clean non-existent but as I drank more the piny hop flavor and slight bitterness became more evident.  The mouthfeel was decent. Medium carbonation and medium weight body. Smooth but not particularly rich in hop oils.  Overall I really liked this beer and I will have it again.

140,30420,NeroFiddled,4.42,"Each year I go to New York and find the Torpedo on tap somewhere, but I've never seen it in Philly! Anyway, it's kind of like a bumped-up version of SNPA. It's bigger (it's not huge), but it's not really any more caramelish (it's certainly not like Celebration ale). And it's a little more hoppy, but it's certainly not a brash and bitter IPA. Just like the regular SNPA, it's very well balanced and refined. It's kind of like the IPA, but I don't think it's as piney and dry. Maybe it's just Sierra Nevada IPA with a different hop bill.... ?  Anyway, it's a bright, clear amber beneath a thick-fingered head that holds well. It eventually drops, but leaves a complete surface covering, and the glass is ringed with splatters and smears of lace as it goes.  The aroma offers bright, fresh, floral & citrusy hops over a light maltiness. Cascade immediately comes to mind, but I think it's more complex than that. Perhaps some Chinook, but just a touch. Most likely dry-hopped.  The body is medium with a fine, crisp carbonation that awakens the tastebuds.  The flavor is a combination of tangy, fruity, citrusy hop flavors over a lightly caramelish & biscuit-like maltiness. There's also a touch of pineyness to it as well, but it's very limited. It's solidly backed by bitterness, but it's not brash (I'm guessing around 50 IBU's). It finishes dry with a short lingering hoppy bitterness and a bready/biscuity maltiness.  Well balanced. Refined. Full flavored but not over-done. Highly drinkable. A decent cross-over between an American pale ale and an American IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Very noticeable alcohol, especially on the finish. And on the finish there's a lingering bitterness and keeps growing long after and stay around for quite some time. It has a medium body, dry texture, moderate carbonation and stinging alcohol. At first I thought I was going to love this beer because of its great hops aroma and flavors.

Lacing and head retention were really great  S - Malt cuts through the expected hop aroma that I normally associate with an IPA from the U.S. Was not overly impressed with the aroma, but still pleasant  T - The familiar SN hops, great stuff, but had a strong bit of help from the malt to have a great taste  M - The sampling that I had didn't have as much carbonation as I would have like in this style  D - Pretty good drinkability, and I enjoyed a couple without any trouble.

140,30420,gabeerfan,3.68,"Appears a deep honey amber with a white head that slowly fell to a ring around the beer. Some lacing. First aroma was of pine and grass, followed by some grapefruit rind. There are some malts there, but they are really secondary in the aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma. The pine/grass hit first with the hints of grapefruit. Brown sugary malts subtly come in at the end. Medium mouthfeel. Oily hops muted by good carbonation. Not enough malts for a full-body. Fairly drinkable. Finishes very dry. I only had 1 as there were other tasty beers for me to try at BSP. But, the hops made it difficult to think about more than one of these. If you are a hophead, this is a great beer. Very West Coast.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,turbine2475,3.64,"A - Pours a deep honey/brown color with a small one finger head that disipated slowly into a good lace.  S - Touches of pine and some semi sweet hops. Not really too much here.  T - Lots of orange and grapfruit peel in the taste. Earthy malt comes behind it to balance the confused hops. Not bad. Confused in this cases adds to the complexity.  M - Murky mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. Good grapefruit after taste.  D - Not bad. Does not have the ""sameness"" in aftertase that some of the other SN brews share. Truely takes on a life of its own, and is a welcome change of pace.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,PiecefulToker,3.75,"A: Dark amber, slightly hazy, thick sticky head that leaves an equally sticky lace down the glass.  S: Very hoppy. Can't distinguish the varieties, but there are some amazing smells coming out of this beer.  T: This is a very good IPA, and I prefer it to their other IPA. Very hoppy, but with a great malty sweet backbone to back it up and balance it out. The bitterness is pretty high, but not overpowering.  M: Medium body, fairly low carbonation, slightly syrupy. Very appropriate for the style.  D: One of these is great at the end of a long session, but I wouldn't want more than a few.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,USCTrojanBrian,3.65,"On tap at Toronado in San Francisco, CA (from notes).  My first IPA of my NoCal trip, and probably the most mundane. As noted by other reviewers, solid citrus profile within the hop taste. You can definitely tell from even a blind tasting that Sierra Nevada made this. Their signature taste is good though!  Nothing too spectacular here, wasn't blown away by the hops like I prefer in an IPA, might have to re-evaluate on a future trip.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ckeegan04,4.22,"A - Hazy copper in color with one finger head. Decent retention and excellent lacing.  S - Dominated by a citrus hop aroma. About what one would expect from a SN IPA. Excellent smell.  T - Citrusy hop taste is the dominate flavor. Malty sweetness underneath. A little off center towards the hops, just the way I like them.  M/D - Full bodied and very drinkable IPA. Not my favorite offering from these guys, but darn good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,IPAcraig,4.24,"I had this beer on-tap at Beyond the Edge in East Nashville. It is nice to see Sierra Nevada come out with a Double IPA.  I got a stadium pour. Minimal head atop a medium amber body.  Smells great. Caramel hops with a scotch alcohol finish.  Sweet again in the taste, but not cloying. West coast, grapefruit hops are to be expected; and they pair great with the sweetness.  Maintains a medium body despite being so sweet, low carbonation.  The beer isnt cloying, but the malt does make this a bit less drinkable in the end. At $5 a pint, I will be having more of Sierra Nevads DIPA in the future if I can get my hands on it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Smell is a faint grain smell, with a mild citrus aroma.  Tastes a bit of a caramel malt flavor, which is immediately overpowered by hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is clean and full-bodied  Average drinkability. It is a bit strong, and probably high in ABV to be sessionble.

T: Defintely maltier than SN's usual brews, but certainly provides a good backbone to the hop taste which is dominated by grapefruit and citrus, overall very good.  M: Resiny, medium-bodied, solid for an IPA.  D: Another good beer from Sierra Nevada, just making continously excellent hop beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,plaid75,4.2,Poured a medium copper hue with a one finger foamy white head. There was good retention and sticky lacing.  The smell featured a peppery hop and a solid caramel malt.  The taste consisted of full malts and a thick spicy and citrusy hop.  The mouthfeel was toward the fuller side for the style.  Overall a very good and robust IPA. .

140,30420,ahalloin,4.05,"I had this beer at the Sierra Nevada tasting at the Brickskeller in DC. It was a treat to have this beer which I don't believe is available on the East Coast. With the tradition for fantastic IPAs coming off the West Coast, this beer holds its own. It pours a light golden color with a lightly filitered look and the characteristic, craftsmanship head retention of all Sierra Nevada beers. The aroma is strongly hoppy (as it should be!) with notes of pine. The flavor is . . . how to describe?. . . a deeper, darker hop flavor then I have ever had. More blunt than bitey! A very nice addition to the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

S: It has a sweet malt smell underneath a very citrisy and piney hoppy aroma. T: The hops are what are very prevelent with this beer as it is loaded with a mixture of citrisy, floral, and piney hops. It isn't overwhelming in one hop flavor which is nice.

140,30420,mikesgroove,4.45,"Had the pleasure of being able to finally try this one at Barley's last night. I had been tracking this one down forever. Went upstairs and got a glass on tap right away!  Appearance - The pour was nice, your typical IPA pour with a deep brownish amber, with great clarity. Nice streams of carbonation could be seen streaking up toward the top of the glass throughout the session, letting me know this one was definitely not going to be dull in anyway. A nice two finger head of white foam had graced the top for a quick while, but faded down to just a thin veil of lace, but not before depositing the nice web like side glass foam.  Smell - The aroma was rich with pine like hops. A nice bit of fresh resin like aromas coming off of it throughout. But as it warmed, it turned a touch biscuity, showing that there were some underlying malts that were causing it to be a bit more of a balanced offering then what I was expecting. Still though, this was a solid IPA, with a classic west coast aroma.  Taste - The flavor was spot on, and exactly what I had been looking for. The first flavor to hit my mouth was a deep pine resin freshness. Sticky, bitter, and sweet all at the same time, it had a nice refreshing quality to it as well. Virtually no alcohol present, so I cannot imagine this one as coming off too terribly strong, it was a nice solid IPA. Some nice tangerine and orange hints whirling around in the back as well, letting you know there was a nice mix of west coast hops. The finish was strong, very dry and bitter, with the long lasting taste of pine coming through quite nicely.  Mouthfeel - Very nicely carbonated, this came off very smooth, and at the same time, quite refreshing and light. I really enjoyed how nicely this all came together here as it was quite lively and crisp and really the nice way to start an afternoon.  Drinkability - This was an outstanding session ale. Crisp, clean and with fresh hop bite, I could have continued to drink this one all day long. Every sip left the mouth dry, and left you waiting for one more.  Overall this was definitely as good as I wanted it to be. The most solid offering yet form Sierra Nevada it really was very well done. Too bad this is not a regular item, as this would be fantastic to have on a regular basis.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,scottg,3.88,"Served in a tulip glass at American Flatbread in Burlington, VT.  Poured a light amber color with a thick white head, moderate lacing. You know this is a Sierra Nevada from the aroma and first sip. Big hop aromas of pine & citrus with subtle caramel. Lots of hop flavor, again pine and citrus up front, then you taste the alcohol with a sweet, slightly chocolately finish and hoppy aftertaste. A little watery with medium carbonation leaves a nice mouthfeel. Good example of an American IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,NEhophead,3.58,"On tap at Sunset Grill & Tap; served in a tumbler.  Pours a full copper beneath a creamy white head. Frothy, ringed lacing with pretty stable retention. Semi-sweet toasted bread with a spicy floral hop aroma. Notes of citrus up-front with a clean toasted malt base. Notes of peat with peppery floral hops; a nice earthen flavor. Medium in body; slightly more active than usual, but it works well with the peppery flavors. A decent IPA. Nothing flashy, but a change of pace from the more common, highly hopped west coast IPAs of today.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

For me, when i drink any type of sierra nevada brew you can tell a sierra nevada beer apart because of the hops they use...i did not get this from this beer. The hops just stay on your tongue even after you drank it so nicely. Awesome brew, wish they bottled this stuff, def a hop-head must.

The hop taste was almost overpowering and did not match up with the light body, no balance between the two. The bitterness almost seemed to sear my tongue and overshadowed any other tastes. I will try again 1 more time prior to having any other beer, just to give it a fair shake, but as I sit now, I wouldn't buy a 6 pack.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

140,30420,dirvish,4.3,"Drank on tap at the brewery in Chico.  Lives somewhere between your average IPA and the extreme double/imperial IPAs from other breweries. They call it ""extra IPA.""  Very nice balance. I really like the high level of piney hops without going overboard. I wish it was available more often.

Modest head with somewhat lingering lacing. A little more malty that I prefer right off the bat, but the aromas from the hops came through clearly, in classic Sierra Nevada style. The doughy malts offer up a solid if not unspectacular balance to the hoppy goodness on the palate. This really is a great sessionable offering from Sierra Nevada and a must try for those who have just gotten into craft beers and have been stuck on Sierra Nevada Pale Ale for some time. A solid offering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,MiScusi,4.15,"On tap at Stone 7/21/07.  Poured an attractive clear orange/red. Small white cap. The smell was very clean pine.

140,30420,brewmaster411,4.4,"The description made me think this was a Double IPA, but while this was hoppier than Sierra Nevada's IPA, it was not as big and hoppy as a Double or Imperial IPA.  The appearance was a nice coppery color, very clear with a nice white head. The malt was very pronounced, with the hop bitterness in balance. This was a bigger, more full bodied beer than the regular IPA.  While I do not like hop bombs, I throughly enjoyed this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,BDTyre,4,"A very good American IPA. I like this because it doesn't try to be extreme, but it is overall very well done.  Nice orange-amber colour with a thin head. Citrusy, bready scents. Slight grassy profile to this.  Zesty, hoppy bite to the flavour. Yeasty, doughy taste. Very pleasant on the tongue. Carbonation is enough to keep you on edge, but not enough to burn your mouth.  A solid, well-done IPA. Excellent flavour, well-rounded mouthfeel but not in-your-face extreme as some IPAs I've had. Almost sessionable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,TurdFurgison,3.58,"Had on tap at Fat Head's in Pittsburgh. An experienced silverback sitting near me told me that this beer is sort of dry-hopped with an eel-shaped bag of hops containing yeast. Apparently the yeast reaction (pissing out alcohol) makes the ""eel"" snake through the beer, stirring in the hops flavor. However they add the hops, this beer is good. Very malty but good.  The body was thicker than other SN beers I've had, maybe they used a relatively high grain bill. There was definitely a lot of caramel and sweet malt involved, offset by the bitterness and citrus of the hops.  Nice beer, I hope to see it again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Brad007,4.2,"Beer poured a nice copper/amber color. Aroma is strong and hoppy, somewhat fruity as well. On a second sip, the alcohol shows through more. Taste is strong and chewy with a nice dryness imparted by the hops.  I had thought this might be a Double IPA but I see that I'm wrong. It could pass as one regardless because I feel it is more of a sipping beer. Still well balanced.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,RedHaze,4.12,"Pours a very nice bronze with a one finger off-white head that fades slowly to a thick cap. The foam leaves behind a very nice webbing of lace on the glass.  Smell; very nice herbal and spicy hoppiness, and it has a bit of an earthy presence to the hops as well. Caramel malts are present, but the aroma is definitely dominated by the hops.  Taste; as with the aroma the hops are herbal and little bit spicy, with a pleasant earthiness. The malts are a bit more pronounced in the flavor, with caramel and a little toasted biscuits. I've heard that this is the same as Celecbration, but this seems more earthy and herbal that Celebration does, and maybe a little lighter on the malts as well.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice smooth, almost velvety carbonation, and the drikablilti is reall damn good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Moments of metallic copper and ripe red apple also add the beers personality. Then the bitterness hits...it sneaks up on you, smacking you upside the head before you realize its there. Finishes sort of bready, very bitter with tickles of orange, apple and star fruit.  M: Medium body with a fairly full mouthfeel. Bit fuzzy.  D: Interesting brew.

[they also had Owens IPA on tap, and that is a pretty good IPA] She was kind enough to give me tasters of the Owens and the Torpedo, and side by side, the Torpedo won handily.  Amber with an orangish hint. Cream colored head that thinned out after awhile. Lacing all the way down the glass.  Aroma hinted at IPA, but the smells of the bar could have diminished that.

Relatively thin head, but good lacing.  Smells like fresh wort. Very fresh smelling with a slight roastiness to it.  Tastes malty, grainy and hoppy- and very balanced and delicious. Mostly grainy up front with just a touch of malt sweetness, sort of like malt o' meal. This is followed by a rich middle that is pretty evenly balanced between the hops and malt with some faint sweet cherry flavors. The finish is long and hoppy with a lingering bitterness.

I inquired about its name, and the bartender explained that the device they use for dry hopping this beer looks like a torpedo as it goes in and out of the wart. I thought that was interesting.  The beer is great, and is reminiscent of there APA with a slightly drier hop taste. Smell is pleasant, with a lot of fruit in the nose and of course a considerable hop bite.

140,30420,rhoadsrage,3.9,(Served in an American pint glass)  A- This beer has a warm golden brown body with a white thin head that has a yellowish hue to it. The carbonation is a fair amount of tiny strings of bubbles racing to the surface.  S- The smell of big juicy pine hops with a green hop finish has a faint toasted malt note with a light sweetness.  T- The big pine hop bite dominates the flavor for the first few sips. The grapefruit pungent hop flavor starts to show in the finish with big hop bitterness after a bit. Then as it warms there is a caramel malt flavor that has a sweetness the shows up after the hop flavor hangs on the palate for a bit. This beer is all about the big bitter hops with some hops flavor and the malt remains in the background.  M- This beer has a medium-full mouthfeel with a tight dry fizz in the finish that only boost the hops bitterness even more.  D- This beer has big hops that have some complexity to them. There is good sweet malt support in the background that comes through a bit more as it warms. I like big bitter beers and lots of hops but this is a bit to offensive.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,rayjay,4.05,"Way to go SN, sometimes you really just come out and go for it. Found this on tap at the brewery. (I was there on thursday in search of cask ale and found NONE!!!) Bartender called it a cross between an IPA and their Celebration Ale; I don't really care for their IPA, but the ""C"" word sealed the deal.  Deep amber body, like the C-Ale. Great head that makes those oily little ""crop circles"" on top, and I could see every sip I took from the 5 star lacing. Very appealing.  Similar body to the Pale Ale. SN beers really fill me up, a pint is like eating 4 bowls of oatmeal. The kind of body that you feel in your gut more than you really taste it. It would feel heavy next to a light pilsner, but then again it would feel light compared to a bock. Let's call it a medium body, but one that'll make you feel real full. A definate drawback to many SN beers because you want to drink more than you physically can fit in your belly.  The initial taste is a hop fruitcake, with some fresh-boiled wort. It tastes like the smell on brew day. Then it fades right away into a harsh bitterness, Very bitter, a unique bitterness. It's astringant, boarderline unpleasant. Good thing I like bitter so it's a tasty treat! A little more than one-dimention to the hops but not much, and there's nothing wrong with simple. Like I said, fortunately I love hops so this worked out for me.  The beer seemed delicate and I got the impression that it would not hold up well in transport. It tasted so nice and fresh from the brewery, though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92

Very intense but not with the fruity highs of most big IPAs. Not too complete, not very balanced, in spite of how nice it is.  Tastes with a soapy strong frunk hops that kick the shit out of you.

The nose was found to be pleasantly hoppy. This a grainy, oily, hoppy AIPA, notes of maple, and pine sappy hops. A wonderful addition to the SN line, fine, hoppy, tasty and sessionable.

140,30420,IntriqKen,4.3,"Sampled on tap at the Sierra Nevada Brewery. Beautiful orange/amber color with a nice 1/2 finger head that melts to sticky lacing. Aroma is pine hops and sweet malt that finishes with a citrus tang. Taste is initially sweet malt that immediately changes to the hops...a little piney resin, lemon peel and grapefruit. Nice grapefruit drying aftertaste yet with a hint of sweetness left behind. Not as intense as Celebration, but much more balanced (IMHO) than SN's IPA...no where near as harsh. A wonderful session IPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,Foxman,4.13,"It came to me a clear deep orange, with red tones through the center. A finger of creamy off-white head lingered long, coating the top lip with froth for a half glass. Frilly lacing decorated the inside of the glass.  The aroma was rich with sweet malt, bragging caramel and some berry fruit notes. The hops cast off drafts of grapefruit and pine, as well as a muted background of citrus, less punchy than the grapefruit.  Upon sipping, the toasted malt pushed forward first, with caramel and an earthbound sweetness. the hops, through, soon stole the show, with a busy procession of pine, grapefruit, mandarin orange, distant lemon, and floral tones. A mild yeastiness breaks through toward the end, but the finish is all hop bitterness, dry and crisp. It's well balanced, if a bit hop-favored, and very enjoyable, not at all unexpected considering the pedigree.  Medium bodied, the resinous hops lay like a little oil slick, and the malt is credible enough to give a sweet impression of itself.  I had expectations, thanks to Sierra Nevada's rep, and it did not disappoint. While it did give a lot of play to the hops, the malt was sweet and toasty, giving at least the illusion of balance, and no matter what the ABV actually is, it was a simple pleasure to drink. It's basic, blended, and hopefully bound for bottles, because this one I could enjoy anytime, anywhere. A good session IPA...and there are never enough of those.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,ggaughan,4,"I got a growler of this from the Drafting Room in Exton and had it with family at a cousins wedding. The beer poured a redish amber color into a tulip glass. The beer had a nice white head, considering it was from a growler, and had some good lacing down the glass. The nose was a punch of piney hops and citrus tones, a bit of grapefruit. Although the taste is led by the strong piney hops flavor, there is a good bit of lemon/grapefruit and a mild but subtantial malty backbone. Overall this is a solid beer of undetermined ABV but it is drinkable none the less.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,DrJay,4.08,"Clear reddish orange colour topped by a full, dense, creamy, cream coloured head. Excellent retention and it produced thick rings of lace at each sip. Intense pine and grapefruit aromas with a bit of thin malt to back the hops up. Strong bitterness with a light malt component. Pine was more pronounced than grapefruit to start, but this switched in the finish with a little orange as well. Bitterness really lingered. Creamy texture with a medium body and slight chalky dryness. I enjoyed this quite a bit, especially the hop combination used for finishing. There was also just enough malt to keep things from getting out of hand, but not enough to mute the hop profile.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,scottoale,4.2,"Had this on-tap at O'Brien's today. Served in a pint glass, nice deep copper with a small sticky white head. Some sticky lace left behind.  On the nose we have some very piney hops, citrus and fresh roasty malt. Nice hoppy aroma and not too sweet.  Taste is rich, roasted malt that quickly becomes consumed by the fresh piney hops. Nice malt backbone balanced to a hoppier finish. Just enough sweet, very citrus with pine sappy hops that will please many a hop-head. It tastes very similar to the ""Arrogant Bastard"", needless to say, I like it very much.  Pretty healthy body and a nice hoppy rich mouthfeel, refreshing clean finish with a pleasant hop lingering aftertaste. Good stuff, cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,WVbeergeek,4,"Currently on draft at Fathead's and Smokin' Joe's on East Carson Street in da Burgh. Appears with a copper hued body nice cream head leaves thick even chunks of lacing. Aromatics detected include piney, citrus, and floral hop tones almost perfumey toned with a caramel bready malt base for balance yeast note was also present here. Tasted upfront bitterness, doughy caramel sweetness blended with the piney, flowery, citrus, and earthy hop varieties nice hopped up ale from our friends outta Chico, CA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with mild resinous stickiness from the hop oils glides across the palate rather nicely. Drinkability is choice here, quality West Coast hoppy IPA wish I would see this one more often.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,jbmorch,3.87,"This seems like a beer to attract the crossover BudMillOors drinker that wants to be able to tell his friends that he is into microbrews.  Having said that, it is a well crafted beer. It tastes like a classic red (malty on the finish with a ruby hue in the glass) but has a great hoppy nose. When I took my first whiff I could see how the previous reviewer thought that this beer was wet hopped. But on taking a few sips the ""green"" flavor fades and it is pure malt with the ever-present mild hoppy smell.  I didn't get the ""sticky"" and ""sweet"" sense of this beer either, other than the aftertaste that lingers a lot longer than the crisp flavors of Alpine Pure Hoppiness or Russian River IPA. The maltiness adds a sweetness that may be describes as an purposely inefficient mash, but that's not the prominent flavor.  Overall, this is a beer that I would be happy to drink a pint of on any occasion but wouldn't drink two in a row.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
140,30420,GClarkage,4.05,"05/11/06- Had on tap at the Toronado in San Francisco, CA.  Presentation- From the tap into a random pint glass.  Appearance- Amber colored pour...a touch cloudy. Slight creamy white head with fairly nice lace left behind.  Smell- Very nice grapefruit and pine...maybe more pine, hop scent. Mild toasted malt beneath.  Taste- Tastes like this one is wet hopped. A bit yeasty...kinda reminds me of the flavor of some of the Pyramid brews. Sticky pine resin hops make up most of the flavor. A bit sweet and chewy. Nice! Malt balances out pretty well.  Mouthfeel- As said up top...sticky, a tad sweet and a really nice low carbonation level. Coming close to a cask pour.  Drinkability- Nothing wrong here. Really nice flavor and texture. I was told it was an amped up version of the Celebration....not in my eyes, but it's still good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American IPA,92
