147,1056,tekstr1der,3.85,"This stuff is rugged. Not my favorite style, but apparently a good representation of it. Just too much hop bite and burn for me to truly enjoy. Definitely a fun time trying it out though!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,Rug,4.21,"2016 vintage  Here we go, beer number 666. And a 101oz bottle at that. I paid over $100 for this but I think it’s gonna be worth it splitting this thing with my boy. Let’s unlock the mini padlock and pop this baby open!  Pours murky reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  This has definitely lost its' intense hoppiness over time, but this honestly smells great now, like a lightly hoppy barleywine. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet brown sugar, molasses, toasted pecan, earthy hops, caramel, golden raisin, and light toast  Where it was charmingly old in aroma, this is a bit too old and faded in taste. It's not necessarily bad but it's showing significant age. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy hops, fusel alcohol, caramel malt, and light fig. The swallow brings notes of brown sugar, toasted pecan, brown bread, and nutty malt  A medium full body pairs with very mild carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet slightly hot beer. Finishes mostly dry with a mild earthy bitterness  It's not the best beer in the world, but I'm still happy to have gotten this big bottle. I'll have to see how I feel after finishing the big ass bottle",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Sigmund,3.75,"650 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 11%. Hazy reddish brown colour, moderate off-white head. Strong aroma of American hops, piney notes, also caramelized orange marmalade, some alcohol. Very hoppy flavour, medium sweet, caramel and alcohol. Bitter finish, hints of solvent.Warming mouthfeel. There’s plenty of hops in this one (surprise, surprise), but this is probably not where you go when you look for balance.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,kitch,4.07,"A 22 fl. oz. bomber, bottled on 15th October 2015. Poured into a snifter glass.  Appearance: A cloudy murky rusty orange brown colour with a thin orangey beige head that disappeared quickly while leaving some nice spotty lacing.  Aroma: Sweet malt, citrusy orange peel, citrus pith, caramel, orange hard candy, bourbon and dark dried fruit like raisins.  Taste: Sweet malt, caramel, toffee, light bitterness, grapefruit peel, citrus pith, dried dark fruit, bourbon, piney hops and some light spice.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with soft carbonation and a touch boozy.  Overall: A good balance between sweet, bitter and spice. While not overly boozy, it is a sipper, and a nice one at that.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,StanleysCup,4.24,"2004 release purchased at Stone’s Liberty Station facility back in 2016; I figured its time.  L: copper-sepia hue with nary a bubble to be seen. Looks like a glass of iced tea.  S: plenty of booze evident at first whiff but upon a second and third visit, I can sniff out some prune/raisin and a bit of a hop bite. Resembles a Scotch Ale or dubbel.  T: this beer delivers as advertised; a heavy-hitting hop bomb cloaked in a ton of malt. The aging effect is evident as there is plenty of sugar on each sip. The prune-raisin combo is omnipresent and increasingly dominant with each sip.  F: this is a mildly viscous, smooth beer. Virtually no alcohol burn and minimal carbonation. Goes down relatively easy for a 10% ABV.  O: worthy of the wait and neat to be able to drink a 15-year old brew that was intentionally set aside for future consumption by a world class brewery.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,MonDak_Joe1953,4.31,"22oz bottle. 2011 dated release. Cloudy, medium amber colored body. Pinky finger width of off white, creamy head. Leaves extensive patterns of lacing. Aroma of caramel malts and bourbon barrel. Taste is heavy with hops, along with the caramel malts. The bourbon barrel is there but not too prominent. Big piney hops. More than medium mouth feel. Very good carbonation. Some chunks come from the tail end of the bottle. Very powerful combination of the heavy hops and the caramel malts, together with the barrel treatment. Close to a lava lamp show with the descending and ascending chunks. Beautiful body color and tight, long lasting head.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Oh_Dark_Star,2.06,"I could tolerate the single (like a double), but this is so cloyingly boozy and abrasive even after eighteen months bottle aging, I don’t know if there’s anything good in there worth aging longer to find.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,NCSapiens,4.23,"A: The beer is coppery amber in color. Light tan carbonation that retains around the rim with no lacing. S: Strong barley malt aroma is awesome. Sweet caramel and alcohol notes with a touch of hops. T: tastes like a malt bomb explosion of high alcohol sweetness. Caramel and brown sugar up front. Then the self-proclaimed unreasonable amount of hops pokes through. Noticeable alcohol warming and vodka-like aftertaste. Moderate bitterness and hops balance out the sweetness making this a well-balanced, if unusual concoction. M: Body is fairly light and syrupy, like a day old coke. O: I think this beer is awesome. That being said, I like aggressive, in your face flavors. Your mom will hate this beer. But isn’t that a reason to try it?",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Sticky lace already apparant. Dark druit, briny hops, and big chocolate malts in the nose.  Huge aggressive pine loaded with medicinal note takes the lead, but the balance here is supurb. Hard to believe this is eleven percent. Strong flavor, but little alcohol leakage.

147,1056,thebadone24,4.26,"""You are not worthy"" can be more than a clever tag line if you aren't careful with this one here. While I'm not a fan of every Stone product on the market, you better believe that this one is one of my favored offerings by them.

147,1056,Reef,4.61,"Bomber bottled 9/9/15  Light cherrywood color. Scant several millimeters of head. Spotty lacing. Strong aroma of plums and caramel, slight pine. Wonderful cherry, tea, toffee, leather, with hoppy dank and pine in combination. Smooth, full mouthfeel. Alcohol is noticeable, even after two years, but not hot or dominating. Equally appropriate for a bleak midwinter’s eve alone, or a jolly gathering of friends. Looking forward to its return.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Snowcrash000,4.6,"Pours a deep, dark amber coloration with a large, creamy head. Smells of caramel malt, toffee, red berries citrus and pine. Taste follows the nose, with a caramel, biscuity malt backbone and some toffee, chocolate and red berries, complemented by hoppy notes of citrus and pine. This really is an Imperial Arrogant Bastard, which really piles on the malt, without losing much of the hops. Depth of flavor seems more intense compared to normal AB, especially when it comes to the malt presence and fruitiness. Hop profile seems a little more mellow, although there still is considerate piney bitterness (this may be due to the 26 months old bottle). The higher ABV is noticeable as a slight, warming presence, but there really is no unpleasant boozyness to this at all. What really needs to be highlighted compared to normal AB is the thick, smooth mouthfeel, which is absolutely sublime.  Having a 2016 (3+ years old) bottle of this right now, which I'm not enjoying at all, this is not the same beer I remember, with the bitter, resinous hops almost completely gone and overshadowed by an intense sweetness and solvent-like character in the aftertaste, which may be due to oxidation. I've heard people say that this ages beautifully, which may be the case if you're into Barleywines, which this has basically turned into, but I couldn't finish the bottle. This may also be due to poor storage at the shop where I bought this though. I'd still advise caution cellaring this extensively unless you really like Barleywines.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,VashonGuy,4.09,"2013 bottle.  Appearance is amber red, with a fairly minimal head. There's a big nose, a combination of sweet caramel and hops. The taste is complex, but hops and bitterness dominate the taste. It's just slightly sweet in the taste, enough to make it interesting, but not enough to compete with the bitterness. The ABV is not particularly noticeable, but that might be because the hops are strong enough that who has time to notice the ABV?  This beer is about midway between a classic hoppy barleywine and a conventional strong ale. What I mean is that a strong ale is something you can drink, while a barleywine is usually just a sipper. This one is tempting to drink, not just to sip a bit, but then all that bitterness makes me hold back.  I wind up respecting this beer, but it's not really in my wheelhouse.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,moreandfaster1987,4.59,one of my favorite strong ales. Darkish red almost brown in color with about a quarter inch head. Smells of sweet bready malts that are immediately followed by piney citric hops. The taste follows the nose well with a big hit of bitterness followed by a fairly big hit of malts. overall a very nice big bear that is very well crafted,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,Jtee,4.83,"From a 650ml bottle served at 14 degrees Celsius into a snifter. Bottled on 15.10.2016 – aged for 9+ months in the bottle.  Look: The beer pours a clear light brown with red highlights topped by 4cm of dense, creamy, tan head which dissipates into a craggy cap in 3+ minutes. Such impressive head for the hefty 11% ABV. Fine-looking beer indeed.  Smell: Complex! Strong and well-balanced - very enticing. Citrusy, resiny, herbal, and floral hops (grapefruit, pine & jasmin). Malty caramel, brown bread, and milk chocolate. Faint dark fruit esters and alcohol. Goodness me!  Taste: Strong and bitter – a punch in your mouth, just the way I like it. Rich, complex and follows the aroma seamlessly. Notes of caramel, dark fruit (raisins), resinous pine, and citrus (grapefruit). The finish is long, strong, and bitter with a touch of minerality.  Feel: Full body with medium-low carbonation. Heavy, borderline chewy with considerable – yet not hot – alcohol warmth. Slightly astringent which likely stems from the extreme bitterness.  Overall: Big, bold, and aggressive – I absolutely love it. I had the whole bomber to myself and I feel like I could do another one just because it's that delicious. A wonderful brew displaying excellent craftsmanship. Beer doesn't get much better than this for me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,-steve-,3.88,"Look: Cloudy, hazy brown. Light tan head fading quickly. Smell: Heavy malt sweetness, mown grass and faint citrus. Taste: Plenty of malt sweetness.

147,1056,handmuffin,3.86,"Bottled on 10/14/15. Served from 22oz bottle into glass at home. Pours deep amber red in color, medium high clarity, with a tan colored head. The head quickly diminishes to a a thin ring of bubbles on the glass. Legs visible when agitated. Assertive aroma, sweet caramel malt and lots of alcohol, resulting in a preserved fruit character. Some fruitiness that may be alcoholic esters or hops. Flavor is more malt with lots of alcohol and high hoppy bitterness. The body is full, almost chewy, medium low carbonation with a decidedly dry finish. Even with all the alcohol aroma and flavor there is little ""heat"" detectable at the finish. Overall this beer lacks the hop character expected, but that is most likely due to the age of the bottle. It comes off as an aggressively bitter American barleywine and really is an amped-up version of the original.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Kdouble,4.64,"A 10 oz. draft in a snifter glass.  Appearance- A bright red-brown color with about half a finger of tan colored head. Spotted lacing down the glass with a hazy color lighter than the beer.  Smell- Definitely get the alcohol smell but there are sweet smells of candy or sugar in there. A malty smell seemed to dominate the aroma.  Taste- The sweetness really gets pushed out by the alcohol. There seems to be some caramel or molasses mixed that I didn't get from the smell. I neat bitter finish and some citrus thrown in.  Feel- A thick mix with enough carbonation to make it. A dry finish, maybe the high ABV.  Overall- Very drinkable for 11%. Stays true to the style and the light candy sweetness mixes well. A great beer for a cool day",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Everydayoff,4.25,"2015 release, 650ml bottle poured into a snifter.  Hazy deep ruddy brown in color with lots of sediment floating around, the pour forms up thick creamy light tan head that withstands with good retention before slowly sinking to a lasting bubble sheet on the surface and leaving lots of lacing patch and spot.  Rich and intense malt in the aroma with the array of sweet candy, caramel, burnt sugar, dough, butter bread, toasted biscuit, and charred nut while hop provides its citrus, pine, tropical, and slight spicy in subtle fashion together with a hint of alcohol perfume and cherry.  Super malty and cherry boozy in the taste, it kicks off with the vast malty goodness of sweet candy, caramel, burnt sugar, dough, butter bread, toasted biscuit, and charred nut. Hop is being nicely complement with slight citrus and pine as well as a very extreme bitterness while alcohol wraps all the things up with its sweet, spicy, and warming touch.  Full of chewy malt and rather syrupy body with smooth mouthfeel and medium carbonation that is well enough to carry all the things well, finish is very dry.  Complex and more arrogant than its little brother, the aging helps to develop some more on malt while being a bit drop on crisp hop character. Still a truly great brew in anyway.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,jazzyjeff13,3.75,"This is the 2013 release, which I've been sitting on for a while. A 22oz bottle with a bottling date of Aug 2013. ABV is stated as 11.2%. Acquired from the Brewdog webshop ages ago and carefully stored.  A: Poured into a tulip. Bottle conditioned. A deep ruby-red hue with light carbonation and some floating sediment. Yields a decent head of creamy off-white foam that lasts for a minute or two before collapsing to a patchy surface layer.  S: Aroma of sweet caramel malt and pungent hops, with notes of toffee, barley sugar, grain, pine resin, spicy hops, sherry, oxidation and booze. Complex, but definitely gives off an impression of being past its best.  T: Tastes of sweet malt and exceptionally bitter hops. Hints of caramel, sugar, grain, leafy bitterness, pine resin, spice, mild sherry and a warming touch of alcohol in the rear. Quite oxidised, and lacks much of the aromatic hop character that might be expected. A forceful flavourfest nonetheless.  M: Mouthfeel is smooth and thick, with hop oils and booze tingling the palate. Carbonation lightly tickles the tongue. A big, chewy texture followed by an aftertaste of sweet malt, stinging hop bitterness and oxidation.  O: An impressive brew, but I suspect I held on to this for a bit too long. Looks nice, while the aroma and flavour are huge blends of sweet malt, pine resin and leafy bitterness. Quite a bit of oxidation present, as well as the loss of aromatic hop notes that would have provided more balance to the malt. Good body. Interesting, but probably best sampled younger!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Appearance - A bright red color, a finger of light tan head and some lacing. Also a not inconsequential amount of haze.  Smell - Big and boozy with plenty of molasses and inviting. Burnt sugar in there too. A malt bomb that doesn't shy away from hops either.  Taste - boozy and very bitter, some elements of smoke within, peat flavors and boozy finish.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and thick, chewy with good carbonation and a very dry finish.  Overall - A fine big beer that left me a little disappointed. Certainly drinks like an 11 percenter.

Smell is sharp, might be the booziness, the smoothness and caramel flavors are hidden at first, then come through lighter than expected with moderate hoppiness.  Taste is huge malt, heavy caramel and lighter molasses, sharp alcohol, big bitterness. Definitely a doubly arrogant beer, but also one I think needs at least a few months aging to soften the bitter, boozy blow.  Mouthfeel is less sharp as it warms, moderate carbonation, smoothness starts to exude itself but the bitterness overtakes and bits the tongue.

S: Pineapple, Caramel, Alcohol very present, Pine Hops and lots of malt.  T: Incredibly smooth flavors present themselves beginning with the hops, slight citrus and pine, morphing into the malty backbone of toffees and caramels, then finishing with the bite of the very present alcohol even after over a year of bottle aging.  F: Medium-Full bodied, super-smooth on the palate.  O: What an excellent beer!  UPDATE: 2009 release! 8 year old bottle! 22oz poured into Snifter. No exact date just 2009.  L: Murky russet brown. No head whatsoever but it bubbles a little.  S: Surprisingly I still get a decent amount of alcohol, but mostly this is some rich caramel malts like, citric and pine hop notes, some honey like sweetness as well.  T: Lots of malt again, caramel and toffee, with almost a toast flavor, alcohol is still present. Citrus and pine hops are gone from the flavor.

What we have here is essentially Arrogant Bastard roided the hell out. It smells and tastes of dark, earthy and bitter hops, almost Campari-like, while a sweet booziness weaves itself seamlessly throughout in a caramel-coated incognito.  Happy to have split this bomber with a good friend, as the 11% ABV is well-concealed through a chewy, almost savory drinking experience.

Cream -colored head settles shortly. Specks of lacing.  S: Loads of toasty bread crust. Chewy caramel. Deeply toasted biscuits. Scones. Big raisin and date fruit character. Hops still retain a fair amount of earthy and spicy pull, though they've subsided a bit.  T: Chewy caramel leads. Subtle hints of toffee. Aggressive toasty character. Heavily toasted crust. Scorched pizza crust. Raisin, fig, and date fruit. Hops are still pretty aggro, retaining a lot of bitterness and spicy, oily, and earthy flavor. Alcohols pick it up and spike hard toward the back end. Almost vodka-like. Oily hop finish leaves a strong trailing bitterness.  M: Big, thick, and weighty. Round and chewy in texture with a mild coating feel. Abrasive hop astringency dries things out. Medium-low carbonation.  O: This strong ale is very American Barleywine-esque, and quite aggressive. Huge, overly toasty, bitter, and boozy. Untamed and unashamed. It takes the palate a good while to get used to the beating this beer dishes out, and even then it's still a slow sipper.

The head is a lovely tiramisu ice cream color, and is smooth and long -lasting, leaving spotty lace. The body is a very deep copper, and while the clarity is murky, it's more romantically mysterious than it is off-putting. The bitterness is strong, thanks to heaps of resinous and floral hops, but is made quite palatable by equally massive toffee and sugared hazelnut flavors. Oaky booze plays a big role as well, but is made more sophisticated by a complex garnish of spices that run the gamut from white pepper to cloves. Medium-bodied and delectably creamy, the mouthfeel is quite seductive, with a nice kick of carbonation to boot. Lots of alcohol warming, and a residual stickiness which leads to uncontrollable lip smacking. It's a big-bodied brew for the fearless, and yet, it's stylistically sound.

147,1056,Bierliebhaber3,4.1,"It’s a dark brown ale with a thick, sticky white lacing. It has good caramel malt character, but the hops are really what take over with strong flavors of grapefruit and pine. It has a bitter quality that could almost make you think that this could be a double or triple IPA, though it’s officially a strong ale. You can definitely taste the alcohol in this whopping 11.4% beer, but it’s not overwhelming. It’s a really good strong ale. I’ve tried most of Stone’s beers and at this point I would say that while this is better than average even at this great brewery, there are definitely some Stone beers that I like more (Arrogant Bastard, Imperial Stout, Ruination, etc.).",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Smells great, lots of malt and caramel, some herbal hops, some brown sugar, slight whiff of vanilla. Taste follows the nose with the malt and caramel. Some citrusy hops to go along with the the more dank, herbal ones, some brown sugar. Good amount of bitterness beginning midway, through the finish. Smooth for the ABV, well carbonated, really good body.  Great beer, have had before but first review. Not overly complex, but well blended and flavorful. Waiting a little more than a year to drink this probably dulls the hops a fair amount, but they're still kickin'.

Caramel, butterscotch, creamy vanilla, boozy as in a spirit, cherry, malty sweetness, just a tad citric as in orange and earthy/spicy hoppiness. This is already an old bottle for Stone standards, hence the hoppiness is rather subdued.  Upfront you get a lot of carbonation to tease your palate. Bittersweet thrust of flavors, although at the end, the sweetness prevails. Notes of caramel, molasses, citrusy fruit, butterscotch, spirit booziness, cherry, raisins and a slight hint of apricot. The aftertaste is long, with a decaying caramel and molasses sweetness and a growing bitterness. Double bastard coats your palate with bitterness. Very assertive, almost aggressive flavors. Medium body, smooth.  This is quite a special beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The head collapsed quickly but left some very attractive lacing behind. The best thing about this beer is the flavor. It is big and bold, just the way I like 'em.

147,1056,nizzle8287,4.93,"Bomber bottled on 10/8/15. Stored at 55F since purchased last November. Poured into a 10 oz snifter at about 55 degrees F. Pours a clear dark ruby red with some minuscule particulate floating around inside, so it's not completely filtered; this has a positive effect on the flavor of the beer. The off-white head is about a finger and a half, and dissipates within a couple of minutes to patchy splotches and a ring around the edge of the glass. The smell is caramel, vanilla, dark ripe fruit like plum or raisins, a hint of citrus in the background. The taste right off the bat is caramel, a hint of plum, slightly diminished hoppy bitterness that balances very nicely with the malt profile. Really feels like hoppy barely wine. Perfect amount of bitterness and ripe orange and raisin sweetness lingers on the palate for a long time, which is very pleasing and makes me want to drink it very slow, even though it easily goes down silky and smooth. It feels medium bodied with light to moderate carbonation. Alcohol presence (11%) is barely even noticeable, in fact, the Arrogant bastard (7.2%ABV) at this temperature exhibits more alcohol presence. This beer is a great pleasure to drink, and I suspect would age very nicely.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,thehyperduck,4.02,"Bomber picked up at the LCBO a few months ago; the last of four bottles from their Bastard Box. Bottled Sept 9 2015 and served slightly chilled.  Pours a clear ruby-red amber colour with visible flecks of stuff hovering throughout. One finger of creamy, off-white foam is seated at the surface, fading gradually over the next few minutes until only a wide, frothy collar and some bubbly film remains. I am getting notes of caramel, butterscotch, plum and candied orange on the nose, as well as hints of maraschino cherry, grapefruit, pine resin and some rummy, boozy sweetness.  Not bad, but the hop flavours seem to have faded a bit over the last ~5+ months, making this more of a malt-forward experience than anything else. Brown sugar and butterscotch, some nuttiness and a few hints of raisin and fig comprise the front end, with hops rounding out the back. They impart flavours of citrus and earthiness, with relentless resiny bitterness leading up to the bittersweet finish. Boozy aftertaste that blends hints of dark fruit, caramelized sugar and hoppy bitterness. Full-bodied, with light carbonation levels and a smooth, fairly soft mouthfeel. A good strong ale, though perhaps a little overrated.  Final Grade: 4.02, a very respectable A-. Double Bastard talks a big game (in an unnecessarily verbose manner) on the back label, but in all honesty it's probably my least-favourite of the Bastard Box beers. To be fair, this bottle is nearly 6 months old, and strong ales have never really been my thing, so my tempered reception may have more to do with personal biases and uncontrollable variables more than anything else. It's well-made, but I would much rather drink regular Arrogant Bastard - this one is just too sweet and boozy to land in my wheelhouse. As usual, different strokes apply for different folks, and while this ale might not be my thing, it is still definitely worth a try.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Once they reach their total ambient temperature tasted it and it is out of this world.  new update: my local beer distributor brought out a case of 2013 Double Bastard. I immediately bought it as it was already aged by three years. Not only that but the price was 2013 variety. A win-win. The Taste was exceptionally mild, the alcohol not overwhelming.

S: Grassy, piney hops and some toffee and caramelized wort mingle together. Turbinado sugar, dried dark fruit and dark rum.  T: More grassy resinous hops upfront, with concentrated toasty boozy malt behind it. Semi-sweet finish with lots of grassy piney hops. Though bold, everything here comes across as quite balanced and very drinkable for the style and strength – no real oxidized notes, just a really nice mellowing of the flavors.  F: Medium-full body with a chewy, resinous mouthfeel. Just under medium carbonation and a decent but far from overwhelming amount of heat in the finish.

Smell: Strong bourbon, hops, and malts, followed by some char, oak, toffee, caramel, and brown sugar.  Feel: Full bodied, heavy and chewy. Has a little bit of carbonation to balance.  Taste: Bourbon, char, hops, malt, and alcohol are immediate, and leave a lasting impression the whole way through. Caramel, brown sugar, and toffee appear near the backend to give it some sweetness.

As it warms the malt becomes more prominent, to the effect of rendering tastes of sweet fleshy fruit. Body is full, creamy yet sharply carbonated, sometimes astringent, sometimes mouthwatering. Quizzical. I get trying to be in-your-face, but when you get past the macho attitude and fuck-you-ness, alcohol simply does not smell or taste good, period.

147,1056,mrfrancis,4.4,"A: Pours a murky amber with a thin khaki head that recedes quickly.  S: Rich aromas of caramel, molasses, biscuit, brown sugar, and sweet cream are quickly balanced by assertive aromas of pine, lemon rind, white grapefruit, blood orange, spruce, grass, herbs, and kumquat. There is no alcohol to speak of on the nose which is pretty impressive considering this beer has an abv of 11%.  T: Incredibly balanced notes of brown sugar, biscuit, sweet cream, nougat, caramel, molasses, pine, spruce, grass, herbs, lemon rind, white grapefruit, blood orange, and kumquat swirl across the palate. The finish is bitter and resinous, offering a slow fade of blood orange, grass, caramel, pungent herbs, pine, lemon rind, and grapefruit before a sneaking alcohol warmth settles in and more or less smooths things out completely.  M: In the mouth, this ale is full-bodied and sticky. Carbonation is delicate, yet active. Alcohol warmth is very restrained. Though a sipping beer, this is one that I could definitely see myself being able to sip steadily and finish quickly. All in all, this is far more drinkable than it should be given the strength.  O: I tend to be pretty generous in my reviews, but I am not even remotely exaggerating when I say that this is the best beer I have had in some time. For a strong ale, it is approachable, yet complex and extremely well-balanced. I really cannot find much about this ale to fault. In the end, I just wish I had made it a point to try this one sooner.

Smell: The aroma is clearly of sweet figs and sticky, overripe dark fruit.  Taste: The taste is clearly of sweet, overripe dark fruit, which includes mushy raisins, and medium roasted sweet grains. Distant Lemonheads taste. The taste is even keeled, leaning on the sweeter side. The addition of hops balances this out perfectly. The regular Bastard has a much bigger hop profile. This is sweet, but not too sweet for me. Some could say, this is heading toward being called cloying...but maybe not. The level of sweetness is nicely placed. Good balance of tastes. This really opens up as it warms.  Feel: Nothing to complain about. Smooth drinking. For me, the level of carbonation would be a 4 out 10. Lush.

(In honor of Fred Eckhardt)  Appearance: Slight haze from proteins that fell out of suspension over the 5 years of aging. Beautiful deep amber orange glow  Aroma: Roses, with peaches and cream. Carmel and burnt molasses. Sourdough bread.  Taste: The beast has mellowed beautifully in both body and maltiness. The bittering hops still leave this beer with a firm bite. The alcohol heat is gone. It is juicy, slightly sweet, and it finishes bitter. Probably past its peak but still great.  Mouthfeel: On the thinner side from a big beer like this.

Short filmy cap of khaki foam comes to rest for a few moments until swirling out. Very light on the stick.  S: Nutty scorched caramel toffee with bread crust, earthy hops and a bit of pine and orange peel. Some mild stone fruit like esters present. Nicely balanced between malts and hops with the alcohol kept in good check.  T: Deep malty and rich with a nutty caramelization all throughout. Toffee, plum, and fig notes in spades with dark style bread and biscuit. Some further stone fruit action. The brew has a big hop bitterness that cuts through all the malt sweetness adding in some nice elements of citrus, pine, and spice. Alcohol is well and present with heat but it kind of works in favor of this one. Just one big ass beer yet remarkable balanced and simple to drink.  M: Full bodied and even a touch syrupy at times but with a nice cutting bitterness midway. Finishes out with a fair amount of drying and some stinging alcohol heat.  D: I think Stone did a great job of scaling up the base AB while keeping true to the flavor profile.

147,1056,m_hall,4.78,"2014 bottling. Poured from a bomber into a nonic pint. This ale is a clear mahogany color and is capped by a lingering 1-finger tan head, supported steady carbonation. Lacing is heavy all the way down the glass  Aroma is malty with toffee-like notes, ripe fruits, alcohol, and woody, pine-y hops. Surprisingly, this doesn't seem as intense on the nose as the standard Arrogant Bastard Ale.  Flavors are intense, to say the least. Big malts up front... brown sugar, caramel, toasted nuts, and raisins. A good bit of hop presence follows, but I certainly wouldn't say this beer is in any way over-hopped, there's so much going on here that the bitterness serves as a perfect counterpoint to everything else. The finish is long and hop-y, but very pleasant.  The mouthfeel is rich, slightly oily like a good booze, but this is a surprisingly strongly carbonated ale, so it's not as thick as one might expect. It's far easier to drink (quickly) than a lot of strong-style ales. The alcohol warms both in the mouth and on the way down, very much like Barleywine.  The ""Double Bastard"" name might have one expecting an even more challenging version of the classic Arrogant Bastard Ale, but this was quite the opposite for me... This has many of the same qualities that make AB so great, but presented in a more 'refined' way. Mind you, this is still a HUGE ale, not for the faint of heart, but it's not as brashly aggressive as it's sibling.

147,1056,dmgeng,4.52,"I have heard a ton of great things about this beer but I have always just overlooked it since it's always on the shelf but I finally gave it a try.  A - Deep ruby, chestnut color similar to Bastard but just a few SRM darker. Crystal clear with rocky egg-shell head and strong lacing.  S - First there is a rich malt, caramel aroma with a bitter hoppy character. The alcohol is stronger in this version and there is also a fruity yeast based character but is not like a Belgian beer but noticeable.  T - Big, strong, and complex flavor. First the rich malt hits the palate like a strong ale should but it is more intense and more complex than Bastard. It has a significant bitter hop character that also fights for dominance on the tongue. Pungent bitterness is matched with the strong maltiness and caramel flavor so it doesn't hurt the tongue. The raisin and yeast fruit character is also there and then after the swallow the alcohol reminds you of the >11% ABV.  M - Heavy mouth-feel. High carbonation. It is the highest carbed strong ale I've had which seems to make the flavors pop more and attempts to lighten the mouth feel. The finish is long, bitter, and hot but some how I really enjoyed the complex flavors burning into my memory.  Overall, a perfect example of the style and a tremendous amount of depth in this beer. Great attributes but just like Bastard this could never be my go-to beer. I understand the following and the respect that this beer gets but it's not going in my top 10.

147,1056,CalgaryFMC,4.25,"Bomber poured into a nonic pint glass. A gentle and perhaps understated mahogany brown with an orange halo near the bottom of the glass and a single finger of thick, creamy tan foam on top.  Aroma is redolent with burnt sugar, pineapple rings, and piney hops. Deceptively mellow on the nose, at least at first. Does create the impression of hidden power. The first sip reveals layer upon layer of caramel (burnt and raw, co-existing), pineapple juice, papaya spears, spruce needles, mango, and a huge bloom of alcohol that gathers steam over the course of multiple sips. Obviously recalls ""single Bastard"" but more compressed, if that makes sense ... A deeper, more nutty malt backbone with around the same level of aggressive hopping. All the accolades heaped upon Arrogant Bastard apply here, although I am finding that the hops pop out less due to the richer malts and the booze flavor is amped up a few notches. Not a problem. Getting big pecan and walnut flavors about half way through, along with a little chocolate cake.  Body translates as quite thick, although the beer somehow remains rather attenuated in feel. Smooth. Finishes boozy and pleasantly astringent, with some resinous hops waving goodbye.  Much what one familiar with Stone would expect ... Delivers the goods, memorable, deserves its good reputation.

Surprisingly little booze flavor at the end.  Mouthfeel: Pretty thick with low carbonation.  Overall: A nice hearty ale. I had this about a year after the bottling date, but it was still delicious. Good balance between yeast, malt, and hops (mostly just providing bitterness at this point). I agree 100% with a lot of the reviews: this is incredibly smooth and easy to drink for an 11.2% ABV beer.

Almost red, yet, almost brown. Barely any head whatsoever, mild carbonation. Smelll is weak, but hints of hops, citrus, lemon, orange, and apples. The first sip sent a chill down my spine. Very hoppy, with hints of spices. Also citrus/lemon is pretty apparent to me. Leaves with a dry finish. Lingering zest and hops after every sip.  I really wanted to like this beer, especially after being a fan of the original Arrogant Bastard Ale. But honestly, this one is just too much. I tried this by itself and with food, and it just dominates no matter what. Simply stronger than I prefer my beer. I decided to try it given the World Class rating, but it just didn't do it for me.

Bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Dark amber on the pour, and settles as a transluscent, brownish-amber in the glass. Opaque-bodied, with highlights 'round the edges. Virtually no head, only a thin, whispy lacing. Sweet on the nose with notes of figs, raisins, leather, red and white grapes, oak, vanilla, caramel, and clove spice. Let's taste this beast.  Immediately, booze and hops. Charred, peppery hops, ripened grapefruit, sweet citrus, black, bready malt, old leather, burnt oak, spiked vanilla, chewy caramel, and love. Holy crap, this beer is still gigantic and assertive. Even 1.5 years later, there are still a ton of hops to be had. This will twist your face from one side to the other. How can one beer be so sweet and so bitter the same time? Whoof. Incredible mouthfeel; inherently dense and menacing, yet dangerously drinkable. Only a tad bit of alcohol sharpness in there.

Whispy lacing left on the walls of the glass. S - 2.25 - Smell is pretty boring to me. Light touches of malt and hops with a strong imperial pilsner aroma. T - 3 - Beer is quite a malt bomb, definitely needs time to age even though the labeling states to enjoy fresh as well. Upfront there are sweet extremely malty tones, reminiscent of an imperial IPA that has sat too long, but in someway you can tell it is intentional here. This fades into the classic, over the top hoppy bitterness Arogant Bastard is known and loved for. There are some more subtle notes of things like raisins and dark fruits in the back, but these but is just too malty for me. F - 3.75 - Decent bodied beer. O - 3 - Middle of the road score here.

The nose is piney hops and caramel malts, with some brown/turbinado sugars and perhaps a touch of citrus as well. The taste is more malt forward than hop forward, which is slightly unexpected given my history with Stone beers. The hops on the finish are a bit piney and grassy with a nice bitterness, and this gives a nice balance to the beer. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, higher carbonation and perhaps a little chewy.  All in all, a very nice beer. This bottle neither fresh nor ""aged"" as is had about six months on it. I found the balance spot on. Should I have had it fresh? Well that is a discussion for another day. In the meantime, I have another one that I will let sit for a while and try it with age on it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,cjgiant,3.87,"Bottle from 2014 Stone box set: Nice mostly clear ruby brown color. Head grows thick and lasts, lacing the glass with copious amounts of residual head that clings. Nose is a tad weak, but has some sweet candy-like notes (dark cherry-ish), some dark fruit, but an abundance of hops bite (woody, even piney).  The taste does have a certain boldness of hops, but is a bit more balanced than I expected (but not actually balanced). This is a Stone Arrogant Bastard, after all. Cola-like candy flavor is the first taste that hits. It turns with the addition of hops bitterness into an earthy flavor, almost a bit of coffee ice cream flavor for a fleeting moment before the hops reach their full power. Woody in nature, the hops just linger with the candy flavor, providing a weird long-term taste that isn't my favorite. Body is fairly full, carbonation plays perhaps just a tad too much.  Not a big flavor profile difference than regular Arrogant Bastard, I don't think (even if I described them differently). The final hop/candy flavor is just off-putting enough for me to rate it any higher.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,Redneckwine,4.67,"22oz bomber into tulip  Appearance - Looks like practically every other beer in the Bastard line-up: Murky dark red/brown with a big 2 finger tan head that retains for a long time and leaves awesome lacing.  Smell - Caramely, toasty malts with a musty, sweet fruitiness. Some piney hops hide underneath. Booze is all over the more, but in the most mellow, pleasant of ways.  Taste - Not half as abrasive as I was expecting... The high alcohol content really tempers the flavors. Sweet, caramely, toasty malts are up front with LOADS of musky fruitiness and nuances of yeasty spice and cocoa. The hops reinforce the somewhat tropical fruitiness, then begin to creep in to balance with a well-rounded pine and citrus bite. Finishes semi-sweet with toasty malt sweetness hanging on tightly and moderate pine resin bitterness that seems to build; a slight alcohol burn lets you know this is a huge beer. Otherwise, any specific fusel booziness is nonexistant.  Feel - Decidedly, this is a full bodied monster of a beer with a viscous feel that coats the mouth. Thankfully the carbonation is executed perfectly - smooth and creamy but ample enough to lighten the feel, which is quite drinkable for a beer of this heft. Awesome.  Overall - Finishing a bomber of this isn't just ""having a beer"", it's an event. Super flavorful, super complex, this Bastard is much more well-rounded than I thought it would be: the huge flavors really marry together well and the booze is ridiculously well integrated. The musty fruitiness of this beer almost reminds me of a Belgian quad. A bit sweeter than I'd prefer, this is still one hell of a brew by Stone, I'm impressed (and a little buzzed).",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

A far amount of lacing throughout consumption.  S: An initial, punchy blend of of maltiness and hops, pseudo-sweet (raisin) and a hint of fresh-from-the-oven bread, and grapefruity-citrus. A slight wiff of alcohol lures you in just as much as it may scare you away.  T: Living up to the 'liquid arrogance' moniker posted all over the fun label, this one isn't for the faint of heart. The amount of maltiness here is generally a bit higher than I like, but is cut and balanced well with the same aggressiveness from the hopiness. A bit of carmel upfront with citrus on the finish leading to a fairly complex taste that enjoyably lingers for a few seconds. The maltiness calms a bit as this one warms.  M: Deliciously smooth carbonation with a medium to full body  O: A lot of beer within a beer as you might expect from the name and description. Surprisingly balanced, as the 1-2 punch I hoped for.

A long ridiculous nonsensical rant printed on the bottle, as always. My bottle lists an 11.00% abv. Not entirely sure what to expect here.  Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  A - It pours a muddled ruby reddish colored body. Less than a finger of soft tan head that goes down quick. Some minor spotty sticky lacing on the glass. It comes off in appearance as a thick and heavy beer.  S - The aroma is sweet and malty - caramel, toffee, and brown sugar, with dank resinous hop notes - pine, grapefruit, tea leaves. Some mild solventy alcohol presence is  T - Sweet & herbal. Tea leaves, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, pine, resins, grapefruit, notes of wood & vanilla present themselves.  M - The feel is fairly smooth and creamy, mildly bitter, resinous, and piney on the finish. Semi-dry. Very easy drinking though, despite the high 11.00% abv. Full-bodied with good moderate carbonation.  Overall, a tasty, layered, rich, and complex beer that grows on me more as it warms.

It pours a pretty dark brown with a medium thin head (less of a head than the original). The nose is similar to the original but boozy. Duh.  The taste is a much more syrupy (malty) version of the original, and in my opinion, better balanced. All that bitter could stand some boozy sweetening and this one does just that. It makes for a huge mouth full of hops and malts. I love it.  The aftertaste is also sweet compared to the original. Naturally you can't drink this like the original, but I will (drink this bomber on top of that one). It's a great big malty experience and one I will do again (I am pretty sure this was my first time with a double bastard).  This bomber is pretty fresh, and I am not sure that I would like this better aged as I think it would get less bitter, but maybe it will settle in nicely.

I finished it, and certainly preferred the fresh version, but it was more a chore and duty than a real pleasure. I've had bigger beers, even a couple much bigger beers, and I found them easier to drink and tastier than this one.

It almost tastes like a Double America IPA but it does not have that malt backbone that I frequently find in the Double IPA.  Anyways, a solid beer.  Tastes great and potent.

Hop flavors or hop bitterness are mostly missing from this aged version: if anything I get a faint citrus taste, but it pales in comparison to the malt presence.

147,1056,bman13,4.93,"A - Nice golden/red amber colored appearance with a 1 1/2 finger head. Next to no lacing at all (11.2% alcohol) so cant ask for much ha  S - nice! Smells sort of like a barley wine but doesn't at the same time. VERY earthy and somewhat sweet smelling. Also a trace of hoppy goodness. Ugh divine!  T - first taste, bitter but well balanced hoppiness character with a malty note as well as some fruity and sugary bite. JUST DIVNE. Tastes sort of like Stone's arrogant bastard as if it was on steroids and just tastes plain awesome! There is such a unique blend of tastes going on it really is HARD to describe in words. Very very VERY flavorful and I can taste so many different flavors going on I can't believe it . This is NOT for the faint of heart as the label describes. If you like STRONG flavored brews with a unique BUT awesome taste. This is literally the one. If you like ASA (American Strong Ale) YOU MUST TRY THIS. or you are not living.  M - Bitter but like I said EXTREMELY and I can't stress extremely enough when I say this, extremely well balanced with the hoppy goodness flavor (earthy) as well as a little not of fruit flavor. Just enough fruit to balance the bitter out but in no way is overly sweet like some beers. This literally is on my top 3 favorite beers of all time... it is very smooth and you can definitely ""feel"" this one at 11.2% alcohol. Its kind of weird. Once you drink a 22oz like I have you feel the alcohol but it doesn't taste ""boozy"" at all if you know what I mean. Don't get me wrong though, it doesn't taste like a 5% alcohol beer but it tastes FLAVORFUL but not very boozy if that makes sense guys?  O - this one is THE ONE. the golden one if I must say. It is ridiculous how much flavor stone brewing has packed into one beer, but this is in NO way a bad thing. If you are sick of soapy, bland, flavorless beer and demand something bold that stands out of the crowd GET THIS BEER. it is astonishing and just remarkable. If you are faint at heart this isn't for you, if you are scared of full flavor beer, this isn't for you. If you want something ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY ONE OF A KIND, THIS IS FOR YOU!!!  In collusion, I literally think this is my favorite beer of all time. I am a huge huge huge fan of flavorful beer that packs a big ol' punch. This beer is one of a kind and is only served on tap ( if youre lucky ) and in 22oz bottles beginning in November only until supplies last. I have bought out my local buehlers grocery store with this beer . So what if it is $7.99 a 22oz bottle. I have bought 30, yes 30 lol bottles of this 2013 release double bastard and have drank all but 3 of them and plan on ageing the rest till this summer. In will review one more time and let you all know how it tastes after aging 6-8 months. I'm sure it will be even more DIVINE. I LOVE THIS BEER WITH ALL MY HEART. May stone live on and keep producing this beer. My only complaint, is that they make it an all year round beer.

147,1056,boilermakerbrew,4.43,"A- Pours a deep, slightly hazy amber in color with a small to medium, 1.5 finger head. Body is relatively translucent despite the haze and darker color. Retention and lacing are both very good.  S- First impressions of the the scent are toasty, hoppy, and strong. Mild malts hit your nose first, but hops bitterness quickly displaces the malt with a piney punch. Scents of strong booze underlie both previous scents. Malts make somewhat of a comeback and blend with the hops, reminding me of an American style barleywine.  T- Starts off with some mild hops bitterness and some strong malt flavors mixed in with a boozey profile. Bitterness takes over in the middle of the drink and both hops and dull malt bitterness take over. Bitterness is fairly strong, but not overly so, and is somewhat balanced by other malt characteristics. Bitter malt and hop profile presides until the end of the drink, then the hops linger with their bitterness the longest.  M- This beer has low to medium carbonation and is rather smooth, but not too thick across the palate. Very strong alcohol presence, yet somehow, the mellow, not too bitter flavors keep this one dangerously drinkable.  Overall, I think this is much better than regular Bastard. More balanced with malt and hops and less aggressive in the taste department than regular Bastard is oxymoronic to the name.

147,1056,Copernicus,4.41,"Poured a 22oz. bottle into a snifter.  The color is a deep amber, bordering on the burnt orange with a brilliant copper luster. The bastard has depth. The head forms into a pleasant off-white at about a finger width and retains itself for a few moments. As expected, some real nice lacing is present throughout the experience.  The aroma instantly represents heavy malt character intimating dark dried fruits such as fig and black cherries but much roast. This hints at toffee more than caramel. There is surprisingly not too much hop bitterness on the nose.  The taste is where this bastard gets its arrogant power. It sneaks in with a smooth, almost buttery warmth, with gentle hints of vanilla, oak, toffee, and dark dried fruits. Then play time is over. An intense hop wallops the palate with piney punishment. It cuts through the initial malt and lingers well into the aftertaste, and it's very welcome.  The mouthfeel works here. It has a light, prickly and fizzy carbonation that appropriately balances out the warmth of the alcohol and the velvety texture of the body.  Overall, this beer represents a well-crafted balancing act of all those things we love, and it knows it. I would pair this with a strong aged cheese or save it for dessert and enjoy with a rich vanilla and toffee creme brulee or pineapple upside down cake.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,BrausBeforeHaus,4.28,"Purchased this fine brew a few times now. So I figured now I would rate it to avoid any snap judgement on it.  I've always liked most of Stone's offerings, especially earlier in my exploration of beer when hops were the only thing that seemed to matter (how naive hah!). I always appreciated Arrogant Bastard as a decently-balanced ale with good character and widespread appeal. So when I found out about Double Bastard, I was intrigued to try a more extreme offering of the Bastard, and ready to compare the two.  You've no doubt read a few times about the lacy white head, coppery color, etc. I'll just skip to the taste and impression.  Wow! Is all I could say after having a few sips. It has a strikingly bold start, but nothing overwhelms or hits you with one profile. All the hoppy characteristics of regular Bastard are there, but with better malt balance to even it out and also a more boozy sweetness.  You can definitely tell its potency after a few gulps. However that potency is more subdued than the 11.2% ABV might have you believe. A few friends of mine who have tried it were all shocked to learn it was that alcohol-infused, they guessed about 8.5-9%.  All in all, I believe this brew to be far superior to regular Arrogant Bastard. I am more partial lately to ""extreme"" style beers with strong ABV and character. It is a definite recommendation that you pick up a bottle if you fall in line with those tastes. I have already given it a good review amongst peers who are looking for something new and different in the beer world.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Head takes a couple minutes to dissipate leaving spots of lacing on the glass. Just a few bubbles of visible carbonation.  S: Very mellow aroma on this one that reminds me of a farmhouse I used to visit as a child. Malts add a big richness that overwhelm the hops. Certainly fig, raisin or another dried dark fruit pushes through.  T: Very bold flavor on this one. A wallop in the face of intense malt flavors that barely beats out the dramatic hop entrance. Carmel or toffee adds some sweet flavors. Hops linger in the aftertaste.  M: Full body with moderate to low carbonation. A bit dry on the finish from the amount of hops. Not too hot considering the ABV but certainly warms you up.  Overall this one is just screaming to be aged. Haven't had one in a couple of years and am really able to appreciate this beer now.

Full bodied and sticky sweet, with an incredible, delicate, creamy smooth feel.

147,1056,LambicPentameter,4.37,"Enjoyed on tap at Bier Station in Kansas City, paired with a pressed turkey and cheddar with sauerkraut and whole-grain mustard on marble rye bread. Served in a small Belgian tulip glass.  Appearance - Pour yields a sudsy caramel off-white head of a finger ahd a half. Mostly microbubbles, but a smattering of larger, soap-like bubbles are atop the beverage as well. Retention is excellent and leaves spots of lacing on the glass as I drink it down. Supporting the head is a beautiful dark crimson-amber hue with some shades of magenta or almost purple to give it an amethyst like quality, but more red. Maybe like a cross between an amethyst and a ruby. Very pretty shade of red in any case.  Smell - The smells of caramel malt and pungent hops compete to be the most predominant on the nose. Beneath that there are elements of dark fruit--specifically black plum and perhaps black cherry, but without any of the tartness that usually accompanies cherries. Maybe even some hints of raisin as well, although faint. the hops used are earthy and peat-like, rather than citric or floral.  Taste - Initially, I get some light sweetness, like light molasses or maybe even Grade A (light amber) maple syrup. But that is quickly complimented by the bittering of the hops used to avoid this from becoming just a lot of sweet malt. The hops are aggressive enough to provide bitterness and allow me to recognize that common beer ingredient, but they don't overpower the main character of this beer, which is malt, sweetness and a touch of light pepper.  Mouthfeel - Creamy and medium bodied, with ample carbonation for the style, but still probably moderate levels on an overall scale. Finish is sweet, but not cloying.  Overall, a wonderful beer, especially when paired with the right food. It worked quite well with the acidity and pungency of the spicy mustard and pickled flavors of the sauerkraut. But it's certainly good enough to stand on its own, even though it might be a sipping beer. I did prefer it as it warmed and allowed the malt profile to shine.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

A lot of tart fruitiness, sharp hop flavor, some subtle malt backbone, and of course some booze going on here, as it is quite high on the ABV.  I couldn't ask for a better view. Pretty much the same as the oaked version, minus the oak flavor. This is a VERY strong beer, something you need to sip. Its actually so heavy and boozy, your body almost forces you to sip it.  Overall, you'd be hard pressed to find another beer quite like this one. One of a kind.

There is a bit of hops and bread.  The flavor has some hops to pick it up, but the flavor is surely of really dark hard burnt malt. Almost a woody earthy flavor. There is sweet breadiness and then it turns into huge pine bitterness. It really does not have a huge alcohol flavor with it. The bitterness really stands out and keeps it wonderful. The hops are in your face with the bitterness, although the caramel and burnt notes are truly there to give it body and roundness.

A touch of whiskey in the nose but without the taste. 4.5  T – Huge malty backbone with a resiny bitterness. 4.5  MF – Smooth, warming and rich. Medium-bodied. Nice carbonation reflected with a bit of sharpness. 4.75",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,rev3rb,4.71,"Bottom Line Up Front: This ale is one to take in slowly. At 11%abv it'll knock you on your ass if you end up having the whole bomber to yourself. I fully enjoy the full bodied taste and balance in hoppiness and maltiness. This is one I'll buy and enjoy when there is something to celebrate.  Decanted a 22oz bomber into a DFH goblet.  Appearance: Creates a nice off white head when poured vigorously. Head retention is moderate. Beautiful dark amber cloudy color.  Smell: Hop resins, bread, dark fruits  Taste: It is an amazing full bodied ale that balances out the hops and malts quite well. Plenty of hops and dark fruits. Doesn't leave a syrupy aftertaste as some of those winter warmers might.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation and on the palate as well. Just a great ale.  Overall: Seriously this is an amazing ale. Don't give this to the ""lite beer crowd"" as it'll offend them and rightfully so. If you enjoy craft beer and want one that isn't a 3xIPA go for this one. You won't regret it.  Serving type: bottle",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,CTbrew32,4,"Appearance- Dark red/caramel color and pretty hazy. Pours one fingers worth of head on an aggressive pour.  Aroma- Pine bitterness, citrus, and lots of malty sweetness.  Taste- Taste is vice versa with the nose with the sweet malts big upfront focused on caramel. Almost a candy sugar flavor you'd get from a belgian quad. Towards the finish the hops really come out with pine and citrus being the most evident.  Feel- Heavy malt and hop combo provide a sticky resinous mouthfeel that can add to cloying at times, but never overwhelming. Mild alcohol noticeable at first, but that subsides very quickly. Low carbonation and very full in body.  Overall- Very enjoyable, but a little too much malt for me. Definitely worth repurchasing and aging this for a year or two could be a great idea.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S-The aroma right off the bat has a huge burnt caremel note. Impressively, there is no alcohol aroma. On a secondary note, there is plenty of earthy hop aroma to keep the nose from being one dimentional. Way in the back there is some dark fruit notes as well. T-The flavor is chock full of sweet, malty, burnt caramel notes. (Very barley wine like) There is plenty of bitterness and earthy hop flavor to keep this palate satisfied for sure. In the back the dark fruits consist of prunes and raisins and even sweet dates. M-This beer has a huge body, huge creamy body. Huge bitterness along with medium to mild carbonation, makes this beer very balanced in the american barley wine sense. It's very aggressive to be sure but at the same time it is balanced. O-Overall I am veru glad to have had the opportunity to try this delightful beer from stone brewing company. I highly recommend it to any craft beer lover like myself.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Huge carmel malt straight booze and some light hop bitterness towards the end. At 11% most of what you taste is just malt and alcohol but its so well balanced with some real nice hop bitterness just sticking its head out so they don't feel left out.  Overall: Hell yeah buy like 5 of these and hold on. Sessionable? only if you want to have a hell of a blackout. Makes Christmas parties tolerable. Enjoy in a snifter or in shot glasses either way you'll have a great time.

Not sure how you could make the beer look any better. The smell, as good as it gets. It is a wonderful mix of a lot of malt and the citrus of an IPA, balanced so great neither stands out but both are noticeable. There is also some maybe dark cherry that is more background. Again, not sure what else I could ask for. The taste is also excellent, very smooth malt up front, super tasty. But there is a late bitter that lingers in the back of the mouth. It is the first thing that I did not care for in the beer. You do not notice the alcohol, possibly that is because of the bitter. Pretty creamy with a lingering sweetness on the lips that I really liked. Overall, an outstanding beer with only the overwhelming late bitter holding it back.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,barczar,4.23,"Pours a hazy amber with cranberry highlights and a frothy, fleeting beige head.  Deeply caramelized sugar, toffee, floral hops, dates, figs, toasted malt, and muted citrus form the aroma. Very rich.  Flavor reveals a backbone of rich, deep caramelized malt, fairly sweet, which is juxtaposed by moderate bitterness at the finish. Notes of dates and figs are subtle. Earthy hops, grapefruit pith, muted grapefruit, and floral notes add complexity.  Body is full, with low carbonation and significant alcohol warmth.  Very complex beer. A balance of extremes, with a rich malt profile and enough hops to keep the sweetness in check. Nuances are plentiful. It's a touch hot. Revisited this years later and upped my rating. Great malt backbone, great flavoring hops, just a touch too bitter.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Brown sugar and caramel through the nose, with some piney hops. Very sweet. Nuts and dark fruit.  Flavor is aggressively sweet, focusing on heavily caramelized brown sugar. Hops are present in a dry and piney sense, taking a background bite not unlike a porter. Not insignificant heat from evaporating alcohol, a la wine.  Sweet and syrupy full-bodied ale. Good bite and sting. Again, notable alcohol presence, but definitely not unpleasant.  If anything, this beer is too sweet for me. I'm just not getting the strong hop presence so many others have talked about. Still, it's a very, very good and tasty beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,flyingpig,3.34,"3rd of a pint in Brewdog Glasgow (£4.25): Amber to orange with a big light creamy head that settles as a thin, foamy lacing round the sides.  Very hoppy with lots of spice and some yeast too. Tonnes of pine with some lighter grapefruit and tropical notes along with quite a bit of alcohol on top that started to dominate but with hints of caramel as well.  Huge amount of hops & laced with more alcohol that I was prepared for despite the fact I knew it was an 11.2% beer going in. There was quite a lot of pine and grapefruit with hints of caramel but the alcohol that started strong just takes over come the end and the flavour definitely suffers as a result of this.  Strong and bitter beer with a full body and a fairly smooth mouthfeel. There is a huge kick that I sort of expected but the balance wasn't good at all and the alcohol seems excessive just because it could be.  An alright beer at best and I felt that the beer was only about loading the flavour with a mix of hops and alcohol meaning the balance was poor and the beer was a hard on to drink with everything in your face and to the extreme. I'm glad I got to try this one but I don't think I'll be giving it a go again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,Kuaff,4.78,"I took on this Double Bastard in my snifter at cellar temperature.  Looks a lot like Arrogant Bastard, but with a slightly smaller head. It's got that same clear, blood ruby hue to go with the off-white foam.  The floral citrus and caramel sweetness of Arrogant Bastard are also in this beer's aroma, along with some cherries, raisins, and molasses. There's a more pronounced malty, doughy breadiness in this one.  Woah. The flavor packs some serious power. It has profoundly huge and hefty hop flavor throughout an entire swig, from first contact on my tongue to the substantial finish. There's a nice little citrus zing at the beginning, and then I get a mix of dark fruit flavors, spicy breadiness, and what I like to call ""caramelized hops"" in the middle. The finish delivers even more hops, now becoming astringent, woody, and pine-tinged. While there IS a bit of a boozy burn after I swallow this stuff, this is a case in which alcohol heat complements, and I daresay enhances, everything else that's happening. Complex, and incredibly delicious. Damn.  The feel is certainly excellent as well. It's thick, but also really smooth and velvety. Awesome.

Taste - Definately notice first is this rich toffee, raisin, and hops. As you sip in deeper it is this wonderful balance of oranges, mild chocolate, complexity from the hops, sticky, piney, just everything you love about a beer this has it all!  Mouthfeel - Definately on the Medium-high to to high side with the body. smooth, refreshing, light carbonation.  Overall - I am in love with Stone and this brew. I loved the arrogant bastard, but this is entirely a different experience. This has everything you love about various beers that are pulled into one masterful brew. You get this full body which is great for this time of year, toffee/coffee/dark which reminds me of a brown ale, then you dip deeper and get this splash of hops that are very complex both in their bitterness and sweetness. This is just a damn perfect beer. I'm amazed, I can't say enough good things. Something in this beer for everyone. IMO, I will be sipping this, this is highly drinkable, but also high in ABV so pace yourself.  Re-edit  I've had this beer from a growler and on tap. TBH, it's not as magnificent compared to a bomber of it. On tap, you'll get more of the bitter, with the growler, you'll get an arrogant bastard on bitter steroids.

Fair retention, resulting in a thin layer of bubbles with a thick cluster in the middle. Lacing is small and spotty with good stick.  Smell - Fresh orange hits the nose first, then a healthy amount of caramel and toffee. Light toast and chocolate notes, along with traces of alcohol. Dark fruit emerges as a more predominant presence the brew warms.  Taste - Complex. Orange and grapefruit pith sits atop the flavor profile, but plenty of other notes can be found throughout the experience. Raisin, caramel and light toffee. Ester fruitiness. Traces of chocolate. Finishes with fair balance, though the pith character tends to linger. A bit of heat comes through in the finish.  Mouthfeel - Full-bodied and thick, with moderate carbonation. Near syrupy.

The hop drops out with its age, now at around 2 years, but still delivers fine full flavor.  T - Rich sugar, caramel, warmth, toffee, dark fruit, plums, a bit of smoke and ash, a bittering bite in close.  M - Thick and sticky, warm, with some drying in the close.

S: Super malty aroma. Rich with raisins and caramel primarily. Brown sugar too I'd say. Loads of dark fruits when swirls. Raisins of course but I swear I get dates too. Plums? Very fragrant. Big stale bread notes from the malt.  T: Lots of heavy dark bread. Like a molasses-based bread. Dark fruits but more subdued here as compared to the aroma. Raisiny with a little toffee. The combination is reminiscent of raisin bread in fact - just missing the cinnamon. Minor wave of bitterness in the finish. Definitely some hops in here but I think the big malt obliterates their flavor. Maybe hints of resin and pine? Lots of spicy alcohol lends a fairly dry and almost numbing aftertaste.  M: Pretty heavy but the sharp alcohol cuts it down nicely. Balances out I think.  O: It seems everything Stone makes is very hoppy but I was definitely taken aback by this one. This is a malt bomb instead. Sweet and bready. Heavy alcohol warming the belly. I will have to get some more to age, I think this one will morph nicely over the years. Right now it's quite hot.

147,1056,Pintofbrown,3.9,"2013 vintage. Served in a snifter.  The formidable Double Bastard Ale is a dark, maple brown with crimson highlights, ecru colored and bubbly foam sits at about a finger's width.  There are some strong fragrances rolling from this glass: a very noticeable booze characteristic like port, raisin, and even a little resin.  The palate keeps rolling with the same in your face essence that dominated the nose. That huge and boozy port characteristic rides into the finish with a growing bitterness. Underneath the intensity, I can detect some raisin and date flavors, really adds to the complexity of the beer. Double Bastard is definitely sweet, but you have to get past the booze and bitterness first.  The feel is very hefty and creamy, a little dry as well.  Overall, this beer is intense. I can see why so many people recommend putting some age on this one. It is a great beer fresh, just really intense!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,McStagger,4.15,"From notes.  A: Pours an almost tawny orange. Finger of head with aggressive pour. Moderate lacing, fairly minimal retention. Carbonation appears moderate. Beer is just shy of being clear. Some haziness.  S: Big, bruising toffee malts. Lot of spice from the hops. Citrus, floral in combination with the large malt presence.  T: Again with the malts. Big toffee, rustic spiciness, citrus drops in mid palate and the hops take over momentarily. Floral notes ride the malt through the finish, but the malt ultimately wins out. Finishes borderline hot from the alcohol. Aftertaste is mildly spicy, with some soapiness.  M: Huge beer. However, it maintains the balance. Hops would be overwhelming in almost any other brew, but the large and well structured malts keep everything lock stepped here.  O: Delicious. They really nailed this one. It's twice the beer of Arrogant Bastard. Twice as malty, twice as hoppy, but still so devilishly balanced. Killer offering.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,Zraly,4.13,"I've had this bad boy fresh and love it as such (easily 4.50/5.00). However, I wanted to see how one would age and thus I am reviewing the 2011 edition.  Pours a dark, burnt amber color with a two finger off-white head. Soft ruby highlights. It's a very pretty color and extremely attractive in a snifter.  The nose opens up with a touch of sherry. At first, this concerned me that oxidization set in and ruined what was once a fine ale. However, my concern was quelled. While it does have a slight sherry presence, there is still hops pulling through, and the malt stands on its own.  Dark fruits and piney, citrus hops play lead. The hops are still capable of crushing your palate a bit, but in a svelte way. Smooth and lacks the hotness that is present when it is fresh. For this reason, I'd say the aged version is slightly easier to drink so long as you are willing to forgo the deep, fresh hop flavor. However, by doing so, its power is yielded a bit.  Depending on your poison, you can drink this young to get the full hop bomb effect or age it for a while and watch it transform into something akin to a barleywine. Excellent either way. Great with blue cheese, honey, and crackers. A great sipper.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S - Nice warm smell, bread, caramel, hoppy background, vanilla  T - Big alcohol up front, same bread and caramel as in the smell, molasses, vanilla, hops in the background (grapefruit, pine, citrus zest).  M - The alcohol is not well covered at all in this one. It's pretty bitter, with some pine/grapefruit/citrus hops. Aftertaste is bitter pine with a solid caramel malt background.  O - I don't know if I would say this should be so highly rated. For 6-7 dollars a bomber it gets the job done, but I don't like saying that with regards to beer. It's got a cool name, and it's available everywhere, it just doesn't have what I want in a beer.

147,1056,brurevu,4.81,From my tasting notes on a 2012 bottle: The Double Bastard poured a deep amber ruby color with a tan head that produce significant lacing. The aroma is a boozy malt with citrus and floral hops coming from everywhere. The taste was incredible. Thick and syrupy malt at the front with plenty of bitter hops to balance it out in the end. It is a unique brew with a heaviness and maltiness to be a barley wine but loads of hops to keep it directly on the Stone Brewing map. The Double Bastard was bracingly bitter but boozy and smooth all in one bastardly package. What a great beer.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Fine retention and perfect lacing  S- Powerful maltiness as we've come to love from Stone's Bastards. Caramel, confection candy, and a touch of damp wood. Earthy, piney hops come through. Booze is not scared to show up as well. Hint of chocolate.  T- Character of big beer with big flavor that punches you in the face. Malt forward with a healthy dose of better hops bring up the rear. Some spice and cherries gives complexity and depth. Layers of flavor that starts off with an intense caramel malts. Quite sweet, yet very smooth.  M- Big body, thick, rich, and dry in the finish. Alcohol is certainly not hidden and doesn't seem as though it is trying to be.  O- Robust beer and one that conveys arrogance. I recommend to let this one warm up just a bit.

147,1056,Kegatron,3.91,"22oz bottle. 2012 Edition. Pour a deep coppery amber with a frothy off-white head. Retains with some fizzy ringing around the edges of the glass. The aroma smells of floral and citric hops, dark roast and a combination of malt and alcohol sweetness. It’s full in the nose, with the hops and malt making an equal push. The taste is similar but even more aggressive, with roast and hop bitterness really hitting the tongue hard. Toffee sweetness comes in strong off the sides, helping to balance things. The finish on this is tough though, with a burnt and bitter feel that lingers. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a good bit of alcohol sweetness mixed in. It’s not overly stinging but will definitely warm your face up a bit. Arrogant Bastard to the extreme indeed, this packs a wallop in the flavor and alcohol departments yet still remains surprisingly accessible.

Big, big nose on this one, like a barrel-aged barleywine - was not expecting that. Caramel, vanilla, pine, booze (bourbon)... again, really surprised this isn't a bourbon barrel aged brew.  Tastes like some kind of boozy cream soda. Actually, the booze is pretty well hidden, you just can't get away from the smell. All of the previously mentioned notes from the nose carry through to the palate, plus dark cherries and a touch of cocoa.  Mouthfeel is soft and creamy, but finishes somewhat cool, crisp and hoppy.

Taste: Like the aromas, it has some sweet caramel, a bitter pine punch, tart cherries, sweet toffee, earthy notes and some citrus.

147,1056,ShreddedThumb,4.39,"A gurgling froth from the obsidian-lined depths of Hell, Stone Brewing Co.'s Double Bastard Ale found its way into my local beer store. Here comes the hype, y'all: the coveted Double Bastard, the successor to the acclaimed Arrogant Bastard Ale, is said to be even more enjoyable and iconoclastic than its predecessor. With full disclosure in mind, I must admit that I did not particularly enjoy Arrogant Bastard. Yet, I am an open-minded beer snob. With that, let's crack open a bomber of Double Bastard and see if we can't have sympathy for this devil of a brew.  The Dorm Room Review  Poured from a 22 oz. Bomber into a Stone Brewing Co. licensed Arrogant Bastard pint glass. (I must admit, Stone's line of pint glasses stand out as the most appealing drink-ware I have ever seen. Guinness, eat your heart out.) Also, before I get into the liquid review, I must reflect upon the excellent graphic design with which Stone specializes. Beer after beer, it's obvious that the Professional Writers and graphic designers have a special job at Stone. The ""Diatribe"" rearing the bomber (taking up at least 15 oz. of the Devil's nectar) arrogantly lambastes Macro brewers of both domestic and international origin. This academically-charged (and possibly Thesaurus-quoted) indictment of the likes of AB and Miller-Coors eviscerates the ""yellow swill-drinking"" majority, divisively separating the craft beer junkies from the ball-park crowd. Also, the Frank Miller-esque Devil caricature adorning the bottle acts as both an invitation an a warning; you don't even know what you're getting yourself into.  Appearance: The Double Bastard pours dark copper, almost ruby red in color. Sort of an extreme amber, if you will. Clearly, the beer is intended to be malevolent: nearly opaque, huge, thick alcohol legs, off-white & cappuccino head. Without direct light, this ale is opaque, red, and very, very dark.  Smell: Certainly complex. Malty flavors and scents prevail. Some smoky characteristics accompany the malted front, but an offensive, unabashed uppercut of alcohol assaults the nose. The hop-forward miasma does not beg to be noticed, as it wafts cruelly into the taster's cartilage. As the beer warms, some spices, dark fruits, cinnamon, and raisins become apparent. The olfactory sense is taken aback by DB; admittedly, the most diverse and experienced palates will identify the cornucopia of flavorful facets this ale has to offer.  Taste: Goodness gracious, great balls of fire! A concussive BOOM of hop bitterness onomatopoetimizes (new word) this ale's relentlessness astringency. While the scent is mostly malt-forward, the immediate taste revolves around a universe of tongue-shriveling bitterness. According to Stone, Chinook, Magnum, and Cascade hops are incorporated in the brew. The second aspect noticeable is the intense carbonation. Combining the astringent hop notes with the overarching carbonation, Double Bastard truly assaults not only the taste buds, but the entire mouth as a whole. The alcohol as mentioned from the smell is back again. Honestly, it tastes like scotch. The warmer concoction tastes bready and even maltier and more bitter. All the while, DB is smooth and drinkable. Yet, one should sip this carefully and thoughtfully, lest they invoke the disapproval of the brand's company Devil. Is it a red? A barleywine? An IPA? A strong ale? Double Bastard is in a class of its own: intense.  Mouthfeel: DRY. The prevailing mouthfeel is somewhat sweet and malty, but one cannot exclude the Sahara-like dryness emanating from all portions of the mouth. No one said the Devil was ever sweet.  Overall: Drinking a beer such as Double Bastard encourages me to develop my palate even further; moreover, it would be doubly important just to comprehend what I just consumed. Those with the most sophisticated tastes for alcohol will ultimately enjoy Double Bastard the most. Yet, even after reading the vociferous screed against the mainstream beer shysters, I firmly believe that any beer connoisseur should invest in a bottle of Double Bastard to sip with like-minded friends over good food and great conversation. They say the devil is in the details: if the Devil is this complex, one may wonder if the red incubus is simply just misunderstood.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The opening smell is an enormous lush bouquet of fruit, sharp hops and a swelling alcohol undercurrent. The first taste is overwhelming apricot, sharp hoppy and most of all an incredibly fine carbonation that swells into a mass of taste and the sense of liquid silk.  This beer has a huge mouth-presence, impeccably smooth and with the under current of alcohol sharpening the taste. The finish is the weakest point; there is a dry feeling (likely the high alcohol) and a slight taste of reediness.

Noted pineapple, melon, and even some mint. Smelled absolutely delicious.  T - Delicious. Lot's going on. Perfect blend of hops and malt, and all those aforementioned fruits without being sweet. Juicy would be a good way to describe the beer. And suprisingly, very difficult to tell how high the ABV % is. Simply delicious. Said deliciousness stays with aftertaste. Fruity-ness even more prevelant in aftertaste.  F - The only aspect of the beer I'm not crazy about. Certainly not bad, but kind of dry and thick.  O - Disappointed in myself for not trying this sooner. Absolutely love it. Wonderful sipping beer that's potent, powerful and delicious. Will definitely put hair on your chest!

147,1056,spinrsx,4.03,"Bomber from Lee's Las Vegas NV for 7.99+tax - 2012 Edition  Appearance - Slightly hazy dark copper with a large size fizzy/frothy beige coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation showing and there is some good lacing. The head lasted for around over 5 minutes.  Smell - Hops, malts, anise, dark fruits, leather, booze  Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste caramel/butterscotch, malts, and hops. There is also some anise, earthy notes, and some dark fruits, I can pick up on the booze and the beer finishes with a malty sweet and hoppy aftertaste.  Overall – Been wanting to try this one for a while. It definitely packs a punch and has a lot of flavour. And even with all the flavour it seems to have a good balance. I imagine that this would be even more powerful fresh, I'd love to see what it's like on tap. I have a 2010 tucked away and it will be interesting to see how it's held up.

S- Tons of sweet caramel malt, slight burnt hop aroma, lots of booze.  T- Really similar to the aroma. Just a huge amount of sweet caramel malt. Lots of grainy, bready aromas with some boozy flavors in the back.  M- Moderately smooth, still a little bite, but not as harsh as when it is fresh. Full bodied, medium-low carbonation.  O- The nearly two years of aging changed this one. When fresh, this beer is incredibly hot and the hops, malt and booze all fight each other. The hops are not as prevalent, the malt is in the fore front and the booze has diminished slightly. This almost drinks like a barleywine.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The head is on the thin side and light tan in color. A few bubbles are visible. Some lacing on the glass.  S-This smells like a lumber mill...in a good way, with lots of fresh pine and herbal forest scents. I detect mint, and fruity booze, along with some burnt caramel, spice, and chocolate as it warms up. Nice and earthy.  T-The taste is also earthy, herbal, and heavy on the pine-forward hops, but there is less mint and more chocolate. The booze is very apparent, but not in a hot, stout like manner. Instead, you get an almost medicinal, brandy-like flavor of sweet, fruity booze.  M-Feel is medium to full body with a pine-heavy dankness to it. Carb is mild, alcohol is noticeable.  O-This is a unique and delicious beer. I have had regular Bastard on numerous occasions, but nothing prepared me for the pine-bomb that this beer let off. Sweet, fruity, and full of herbal, medicinal alcohol, this is definitely a big beer.

A big punch of malt right off the bat with lots of sweet notes immediately following. Brown sugar with hints of caramel. This immediately gives way to a bready thick malt backbone and then tapers off into a slightly hoppy sweet alcohol burn at the very end  Mouthfeel - Decently thick for a strong ale with a nice amount of carbonation to move everything around. Good example for the style  Overall - This is one of the better strong ales I have ever had and a really big beer overall.

The mouthfeel is bitter and heavy and lingers on the tongue with a steady yet tasty flavour. Very nice!  This beer is complicated, strong, balanced and tasty.

Lots of pine, not fresh, but old and resinous.

For this one, you'll have to have some time to savor and some good music or a great movie to back it up. Smooth at the beginning and smells wonderful! Then it hits you with an explosion of different tastes...hops, citrus, and some kind of spice...can't identify it...(it's top secret, after all!).

147,1056,damndirtyape,4.26,"22oz bomber (2012 bottling, bought in October 2012) served in a Duvel Tulip.  Appearance: Translucent deep amber-copper color. 1/4"" thick foam at pouring died down to thin foam across the top. Persistent strands of lacing, a few sheets of lacing here and there.  Smell: Surprisingly not a strong smelling beer. With a swirl you get some alcohol notes that make you think of barrel aging. Some citrus/lemony hops under the alcohol and malt sweetness.  Taste: Starts off with a lot of hop flavors well blended with malt sweetness. I got pine and grapefruit and orange peel mixed in with caramel malt and a deep sweetness for balance. This blended flavor then transitions into more of the malt and then a long lingering bitterness that really smacks you around. It's a strong bitterness, not overpowering, but strong. Piney, herbal, grassy, earthy, spicy too. Complex bitterness would be a good way to describe the finish. Definitely a slow sipping beer for savoring, but that bitterness can really dominate the palate. And domination is the right word - it rules the tongue and dictates what it senses at the end of the swallow. I feel that the words on the back of the bottle ""one lacerative muther of an ale"" are true to form for that finish.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and thick. Just right carbonation. A little bit sticky on the teeth.  Overall / Drinkability: Well...I drank the whole 22oz bottle by myself. I met the bastard and the bastard did set me free. For such a strong and bitter beer, it keeps inviting you to drink more and it kept smacking me around with every sip. And yet I savored it despite that strong bitter finish and abuse of my palate. It reminds me a bit of the Stone Ruination ale for what it's doing to my tongue right now. Drinkability is good, and I have a feeling I'm going to regret it later. But....that strong bitterness I could see as a love it or hate it feeling early on in the beer. Either you embrace it and succumb to the domination of the bitterness with this beer, or you reject it early on and find something else to drink. I chose to take it all in, but I can see myself also on another occasion saying no and stopping early on. I think the only weak spot with this beer is that the aroma is weak. Otherwise its well crafted and worth a try. See if you can hold up to the onslaught and succumb to it - I'm glad I tried it and I suspect I would take up the challenge again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The color was very murky and a deep brown; sort of amber hues in there as well.  Smell- Pretty hoppy, a fair amount of citrus aroma is present. A bit of alcohol on the nose.  Taste- The taste sort of explodes on the palate. It was bitter with citrus hops; very, very flavorful. You get the alcohol on the end but it isn't too overpowering, maybe because I was expecting a bite from this one.  Mouthfeel- I liked the amount of carbonation. It's there, but it isn't dominating the palate or anything. This is a very smooth beer.  Overall- I've been meaning to try this for a while now, and I have to say it lives up to the short story on the back of the bottle. It's flavorful, smooth, and packs quite a punch.

147,1056,TheCondor,4.11,"Side poured with standard vigor from the bottle into a Beck's tall mug. Any beer with a name and packaging like this, from this brewery, is worthy of a buy.  Appearance- Pours a deep brown, murky color thatwould impress the snobbiest of beer geeks with a nice fluffy, one finger head that dissipates after several minutes. Excellent lacing, leaves tons of residue all down the glass. Fabulous presentation from what should be a strong beer.  Smell - I could smell the beer as I poured it. A very powerful piney, grapefruity hops odor is the dominant smell, coupled with a bit of malt and a little sweet spice in there, but nothing to really get worked up over. The lowest rated portion of the beer, in my opinion. The hops seem like the may overpower everything.  Taste - A strong malt presence up front quickly retreats to the power of the hops. Although this isn't any kind of IPA, the amount of hoppiness kind of makes you think it could be, but there isn't that fruitiness to it. A little caramel sweetness in the middle of the drink too. Pretty balanced, well done.  Mouthfeel - A little sticky, clings to the palate for a bit, but nothing uncomfortable. Finishes bitter, medium carbonation.  Overall - Unlike Arrogant Bastard, which I thought was spectacular, this beer is a little more pedestrian than that. Granted, it has a much higher ABV and a more aggressive hop profile, but I think that sacrifices the quality to a degree of the original Arrogant Bastard, which was incredible. This is a good beer and I would recommend it, but if it comes down to this or Arrogant, pass me the lower ABV version that is more balanced.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S - meh, not much there, even with a deep whiff from the snifter. Smells a bit sour, maybe a little hoppy, but disappointingly lacking.  T - I'm not a huge fan of this taste, but I gave it a high-ish score because it does a good job taking you on a journey. DB starts strong and sweet, with little hints of caramel and sugar, and ends with a big bitter bomb from the hop notes. This is the kind of taste that could benefit from some age. It's not overly boozy, but it's definitely strong.  M - the bitterness clings to the cheeks, which is a little unpleasant. In fact, it's almost a little watery, lacking in substance.

Pine hops, with some fruitiness and a lot of malt sweetness. But nothing too assertive.  Flavor is very intense from the start. Nothing subtle about it. I notice the piney hops first. Bitterness is a constant throughout. I also get some of the grapefruit I associate with West Coast IPAs. After the initial taste, it is an assault of intense flavors. Caramel. Brown sugar. A lot of booze. Just barely enough malt to balance the hops, barely. Finish is very bitter, mostly pine. Very warming as it goes down. The 11.2% is not disguised at all.  Nice mouthfeel. Very smooth. As intense as this beer is, it does not linger too long on the palate.  Overall, exactly what I wanted from this beer. I made the mistake of trying to kill a bomber by myself. Going to need some salty snacks to get me through it. Share this one and sip it. A very good beer, but just a bit too much to take in. A system overload.

147,1056,danieelol,4.5,"Thanks to the very generous joecast for this and the brilliant Double Bastard glass from which it was drunk from.  2012 Vintage. 11.2% Alcohol.  Pours a brilliant ruby-toffee with great head/lacing.  Smell is reticent at first. Get a lot of nutty notes which are kind of reminiscent of Samichlaus. Get some lightish hop notes behind that- pine. Yeast and faint tropical fruits.  Taste is a bit subdued also but highly resiny. Get lots and lots of hop and pine. Can be a little alcoholic at times but I feel the hop character hides most of it.  There's a lot of complexity here and this needs time to open up and be sipped on.  Hop resin really builds throughout until you appreciate just what a hoppy and bitter beast this beer is. Like Bigfoot with some intravenously-assisted muscle gains, it challenges even a hop-enthusiast like myself.  I think this one's lower on dry-hop character but really big on normal hop character. Its older but slighter brother had a similarly bitter outlook on life.  This is definitely a ""sleeper"" beer. Was a bit neutral towards it at first, but it really builds on you and is actually very subtle, which is especially impressive considering its hefty alcohol.  I haven't yet drunk my '12 Old Guardian but this is easily the most impressive Stone beer I've had to date. Thanks again to joecast.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,thecheapies,3.78,"2012 Double Bastard, in a tall pint. Yikes... I mean, thanks.  Pours a cloudy auburn color with a thick, dimpling cap. Looks almost positively still. Mesmerizing lacing.  Toffee malts, pine hops, booze, pecan, and some citrus notes. Aromatically flexing. She's a big girl.  Brash hops go big and go bitter from the onset. A juggernaut of pine and pith and more pine. Aggressively bitter. Counter-punch of toffee malts and rigorous toasty and nutty flavors only begs to spell me some relief. This is an axe to the back of the tongue, in a fun way. Throat-gripping strength shows up with about as much tenderness as military-grade rocket fuel. Hints of floral notes and caramel brittle. This Bastard is doubly beastly.  Can't spare much love for the feel. Astringently bitter. Rough and gruff. Boozy, so it should be a sipper, but I'm slugging. Honestly, the body holds up to the carbonation. Kudos?",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,ColdWaffles,3.86,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Sam Adams signature pint. Reviewed from notes from a New Years Day get together.  Appearance: Pours a mixed amber/brown color with a solid tan head that lasted a short while and left a decent lacing.  Smell: Lots of malts and lots of spices. Maybe some cherry. A lot stronger from the bottle than the glass though.  Taste: Much the same. Very strong malt flavor with spice and a strong sweetness that picks up like cherry and honey. Seemed comparable to some extent to cherry bourbon I've had in the past. Still maintains a little bit much booze, but it's not bad.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation and a slightly syrupy feel going down.  This is something I enjoyed, but I don't think I'd have a problem never having it again. There is a lot going on here, but not enough to cover up the strength of alcohol flavor here.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Faint amounts of visible carbonation are present.  Smell: Very powerful malts, sweet brown sugar, molasses, and alcohol aromas.  Taste: Strong, massively bitter with some sweeter aftertastes. Alcohol is a major contributor to the taste giving it a flavour similar to that of a brown liquor with an abrasive citric bite.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, moderately carbonated, finishes sticky with a silky feel.  Overall: As stated on the bottle, this brew is not for the faint of heart. The aromas are impressively powerful, as is the taste. A slow sipper if there ever was one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S - the strong aromas assault the nose. Fusel alcohol and medicinal cherry are at the forefront. Notes of toffee and nuts show off the powerful malt character. Lots of resiny hop character round out the nose.  T - lots of sweetness on the front end. Caramel, toffee, and white sugar. The middle is full of biting bitter citrus peel and sweet cherry fruit. Finish is reminiscent of sugar coat grapefruit.  M - full bodied. Rather viscous and heavy on the palate even with the high and bubbly carbonation.  O - way too sweet and boozy for me at this point.

147,1056,RonaldTheriot,4.35,"Stone Double Bastard Ale has a thick, creamy, tan head, some streaming bubbles, lots of lacing left on the glass, and a hazy, amber appearance. There are lots of fairly large chunks visible in the bottle. The aroma is of strong, medium roasted malts and oily, piney hops. Taste is of sweet malt and bitter, piney hops. There is a brown bread aspect to it, coming from the barley malt. Mouthfeel is medium and slick, and Stone Double Bastard Ale finishes semi-dry, strong, yet not alcohilic, and pretty-well drinkable.

No light penetrates the center, and the edges make a glowing orangish-copper haze. Good, clingy lacing. There are some fine particulates suspended.  Smell: Tons of malt and spices. Aroma is very rich and full.  Taste: Whole lotta malt. Tastes strong, but not as boozy as I thought it would. LOTS of malt. Very little ho presence until the aftertaste, which has a piney, oily finish.  Mouthfeel: Carbonated well with a medium-full body.  Overall: She's a beast of a beer with an entertaining character.

Closet cellaring isn't nearly as convenient or cool as a walk in room. This is the first time I have had the beer. Good stuff and I will pick up another drink it now bottle. It's a little boozey but not to the point that its not enjoyable. It smells sweet and the taste seems sweet until you get into it a bit.

Mixed with that is lots of pine resin and citrus. Really an example of strong malt and hops, with neither really dominant.  Taste is like the nose. Caramel malt, burnt toffee and wood. Lots of pine and citrus. Both malt and hop result in huge flavours. The alcohol is noticeable but not unpleasant. Quite bitter.  Full bodied, moderately carbonated. Oily.  Overall, very good.

147,1056,Jadjunk,4,"Many thanks to my brother for holding back on drinking those older vintages so we could have this awesome tasting!  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a snifter. This formal review is on the 2012 release (fresh).  (Appearance) Reddish Sunset orange with clarity, billowing creamy tan head with good retention. Slight pulpy matter included, mild carbonation. 4  (Smell) Spicy cinnamon rye bread, heavy sweet caramel, medium balanced bitterness, faint to no alcohol in the nose. 4  (Taste) Slick sweet caramel with a medium bitterness, mild dark fruit. Alcohol is faint. 4  (Mouthfeel) Medium carbonation, slick but chewy. Alcohol presence is medium-low. Body is high. 4  (Overall) A lot more malty and rounded than Arrogant Bastard, with a more robust but balanced profile. As compared to older vintages, fresh is decent but this beer has lots of additional complexity and depth to reveal with a couple of years behind it. 4  ---  Vintage Reviews:  2011 (1 year aged): Creamy head still, albeit a creamier tan turned white. Good retention. Aroma highlights growing malt character but a still prevalent hoppy bitterness, creating a conflict with the direction of the beer. Flavor is indicative of a deepening caramel malt character with a bolder, more robust body and a clean, solid finish. Alcohol presence is medium, emergent somewhat by fading bitterness. Superior over the fresh batch although muddied somewhat, it needs more time to balance the flavors.  2010 (2 years aged): Notably less clear appearance, copper with a thin paler head than the fresh vintage. Balanced aroma- although muted somewhat, there’s still significant hoppy character with less invasive bitterness. The caramel bread has developed mild fruity tones and the yeast has worked wonders on the complexity of this beer; hints of developing raisin and dates pair well with the caramel bread. The flavors are clean and mildly sweet, still moist, and the alcohol, while notable is largely concealed. I found this a well-rounded beer with two years of age on its belt; the flavors are more thoroughly developed. Highly recommended vintage.  2008 (4 years aged): Murky muddy copper appearance, thin depleted head. Aroma is fuller; notably fruitier and smoother with bold caramel and traces of booze. Much fainter bitterness to taste and smoother malts with a slight touch of remaining grainy bread character persist and grow dominant. Dryness is growing on this vintage as many of the flavors have been lost to time. Alcohol presence is medium, a touch easier to discern than in more recent years. Mild oxidation doesn’t impart largely offsetting flavors but instead a lasting fruity, if not murky finish. I would argue that by 4 years of age, Double Bastard is past its prime.  Best Recommended Age: 2 Years  Stone Brewing Company's Double Bastard Ale (2012, 2011, 2010 & 2008 Vertical Tasting) 4.0/5.0",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Complex malty, floral nose with hints of sticky pine resin, burnt sugar, apricot, grapefruit, yeasty bread, and subtle cinnamon and coriander. Taste follows suit and really opened up as it warmed with lots of bitter pine, brown sugar, booze, caramel, toffee, orange peel, grapefruit, grass, dark fruit, coriander, and just a touch of vanilla.

The citrus hops are really in full force here. You can't taste the alcohol at all. As you let the beer warm up up a sweet malty back bone becomes apparent.

147,1056,axeman9182,4.42,"My share of a three liter bottle. It was poured into my petite Duvel tulip.  Double Bastard pours a clear blood red, with some amber highlights. Two fingers or so of khaki colored foam tops the beer. Head retention is very good, and good sized chunks of lacing dot the glass. The nose features aromas of caramel, booze, pine, and a bit of grapefruit peel. The balance between all those moving parts is wonderful though. The flavor profile leads off with a healthy swirl of caramel, before an aggressive bitterness and a gentle warming alcohol presence set in. The potent hop finish has plenty of pine, and just a bit of grapefruit peel. The body is somewhat sturdy and the carbonation is lively enough to elevate the hops, very solid mouthfeel overall . There's not much more to say about Double Bastard, it's one of the OGs as far as American Strong Ales go, and a great one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Smell: Figs and malts along with caramel and hops. Surprisingly light scent overall.  Taste: Hops, caramel, malts and alcohol. It is actually pretty well balanced but the alcohol definitely comes through in a big way. A sipper, but a pleasant sipper.  Mouth-feel: Not overly thick, but definitely has a syrupy quality to it. Not a whole lot of carbonation detected, but some which is nice.  Overall: A satisfying brew. This is a good beer, and a bomber is definitely one to share, as it kicks pretty hard.

That being said, if this was a year round release, I'm not sure I would buy anything else. It is one of Stone's best beers and they are my favorite brewery. I can't find anything I don't like.

Unfortunately, it's not ideal. This beer doubles the earthy, leafy, herbal dirtiness that I do not particularly care for in Arrogant Bastard. I had this about 4 years ago, and I wasn't a big fan.

Pours with minimal carbonation. A little heavier than expected on the pour.  Smell: Roasted, slightly toasted, deeply caramelized malts. Seriously cooked and overcaramelized a touch. Some nice mild citrus hopping. Pine needles. Grapefruit and some fleshy orange. Some earthy undertones coupled with a nice floral element. Big biscuity malt presence. Undercooked dough.

Some clinging bitterness with a nice dryness on the finish.  Overall: Double the Bastard, Double the Fun. Double your pleasure with Double Bastard.

147,1056,deadonhisfeet,4.15,"2012 bottling. Poured into a Lost Abbey Teku. It pours a slightly hazy, reddish-amber color with a nice head that has some good retention considering the high ABV and lacing that practically coats the entire inside of the glass. This beer has a fabulous nose. It smells like over-ripe peaches, oranges, and pineapples mixed with rum-soaked cherries. I also pick up notes of marmalade and toast. Yummy!  The beer has a full body and a slick, velvety feel. When they call this a ``strong ale'', they aren't kidding. Sticky, syrupy flavors of sweet malt and toast greet you up front. The sweetness is very well-balanced with a nice mix of bitter, resiny hops and an alcohol warmth that nibbles at you from mid-palate on down. I'm getting flavors of biscuity maltiness, fruity esters providing hints of orange marmalade and cherries, and a bit of diacetyl. Lots of obnoxious booziness on the finish, but I don't mind. In this beer, you just know it's intentional.  This is an excellent beer, but it's definitely not something I would want to drink more than once per year.

The taste is smooth, oaky, and amazingly complex. It finishes with an oaky, hoppy after taste. This is a delicious, full bodied brew that is well worthy of its rating. Probably the closest I've had to a perfect beer yet.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,sprucetip,4.15,"On tap at RIBCO in Rock Island, Illinois  Amber, clear, modest head and retention, minimal lacing.  Boozy with caramel and spiced by piny and citrusy hops.  Rich caramel malty sweetness, fairly aggressive bitterness, pine and citrus hops, and obvious alcohol. It is what it says it is.  Well carbonated, strong warming, full body, bitter finish. A little too much warming to score higher.  And aggressively hoppy and bitter DIPA with strong caramel malty body supporting and balancing (to some extent). I'm sure I've had it before, but it's been a while. I enjoyed it and would have it again. Stone hoppy beers sometimes seem great, and sometimes average. Living far from San Diego may have something to do with that. Maybe sometimes I have had fresh and other times not?",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,acevenom,4.58,"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours dark, clear copper with a thick, light tan colored head. There appear to be a moderate amount of tiny bubbles rising within the beer. The head retreats slowly. I pick up aromas of caramel malt and brown bread with citrus type hop aromas. It smells sweet and and a little piney. More of those resinous hop notes come through in the flavor than they did in the nose. The flavor is juicy and malty sweet up front. The piney hop flavors really hammer in the back end and linger in the mouth, giving some nice back end bitterness. I get those caramel notes with that brown bread. Stone tends to do these hoppy beers rather well and like the other Bastards, this beer does not disappoint. The beer is full bodied with a sticky mouthfeel. The beer finishes somewhat dry. This is an excellent beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,bnes09,3.13,"Light ruby color and transparent. Big head for the style recedes pretty quickly but maintains a solid layer of foam over the liquid. Lacing sticks in lines and blotches on the glass.  Complex malty aroma with burnt molasses, caramel, dates and hints of tropical fruits. Tough to tell if the tropical, citric aromas are coming from the malt or the hops. Aggressive pine aroma as well. Smells like an American barleywine or malt forward DIPA like 90 minute IPA.  Some of the fruit flavors come through with mild dates but is overpowered by lemon rind, raw radishes, dish detergent and ultra tart and bitter grapefruit. Caramel is there but weak. Hops are intense and linger into the aftertaste with an odd tartness that overwhelms the palate and only intensifies in the first twenty seconds after each sip. One thing I can say is that I can't taste any alcohol although alcohol flavor may be more pleasant.  Full-bodied and somewhat sticky. Good carbonation though short-lived. Finish is super dry with a rough texture.  I love arrogant bastard but they went overboard on this one. There's no balance. It would be different if the hops actually tasted good. Am I alone in thinking that grapefruit and soap do not taste good? Not sure what they were thinking. Has a few things going for it that prevent me from pouring it down the drain. Won't be rechallenging this one. It has complexity but without balance you're left with a mediocre beer at best.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Strawberry fruit roll-up. Earthy perfume undertones.  T/M: Red candy licorice, overbearingly sweet. Clean and pronounced flavors. Mouth feel is creamy and soft which offsets the alcohol burn left over. If I did not drink so many hop bombs I would say this is hop forward. Malts and hops shine at different times.  O: Big boy drink only deserving to sip till it warms to room temperature. This beer will tell you what Stone brewing company is all about in a nutshell.

Quite a bit of hop aroma, and a big blend of malty goodness. Caramel malt mixed with some piney hops. Brown sugar, molasess, raisins, and spice come out more as it warm. Gives the beer a sweet spicy aroma reminsescent of a cookie. Really like the smell on this.  T. Has hop bitterness up front, followed by caramelt malt sweetness. Surprised by the amount of bitterness in this one. Spices come out on the back of the tongue, hard to pin down individual flavors. I have difficulty getting passed all of the bitterness.  M. Full bodied. Medium carbonation.  O. Wish the taste followed the aroma more closely. I prefer Strong Ales or Barleywines with more sweetness than this.

We paired it first with grain crackers, this brought out the dry biscuit flavors, then we paired it with sharp cheddar. This eliminated all bitter flavors and smoothed out the florals, then we had unshelled salted nuts, after this the brew was sweet, bold and flavorful.

147,1056,gr0g,4.47,"Thanksgiving 2012. Comparison of 2011 and fresh 2012 bombers. After a year, both hops and alcohol are muted. Still, there's a solid bitterness that hits almost immediately and lasts throughout. The rich, toffee-like malt body is much more prevalent in the flavor profile, making this very much like AB on steroids. Fresh 2012 DB, now back up to 11.2% ABV, is a total ass-kicker. Bitterness is at DIPA levels. Huge malt and hop contributions in both aroma and flavor. Distinct pineapple note upfront. Some booziness present, seemingly appropriate. Either fresh or after being laid down, DB is a hugely flavorful ale. Consume now if you want big IBUs and don't mind a bit of a fuel note, or let it sit so that the malt body shines through.  11/24/2011. Bomber, 2011 release. No bottling date. Pours a reddish-brown with a thin head that fades to a small ring of tiny bubbles that clings to the sides of the snifter. Some woody aroma notes; prodigious hopping imparting some pine; caramel sweetness and ripe fruit also, with a slight fuel note. Very complex, multidimensional aroma overall. Bitterness hits the tongue first, not surprising for a Stone brew. Malt sweetness follows, though much more subdued from my memory of last year's release; have to assume that one had aged more. Sweet raisin, fig notes more prominent as it warms. Hop bitterness picks up again toward the finish, lingers for a bit afterwards. This is an awesome brew when young, provided that you don't mind a blast of hops, and will only get better as it mellows out over time.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Heavy caramel toffee aroma, some fruit, but mostly focused on the huge malts here. Flavor is very dry with malty sweetness, caramel, toffee, biscuits, plenty of bitter to boot. Alcohol warmth is strong with this one, but not overwhelming. Big brew, yet not syrupy on the palate. Nice.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,JGcontraman,4.88,"-''::Pour::''- No aggression is needed for the pour and you can see a lot of action going on as it fills up in a Weyerbacher pint glass. Quickly but swiftly, the head reaches the top of the glass, about roughly an inch thick. In fact, the glass almost overflowed.  -''::Appearance::''- Sort of a dark amber copper color. The head maintains a very nice light tan where you can see micro bubbles endlessly flow up from the bottom of the glass. Simply put, just one of the beautiful moments for a beer enthusiast to see.  -''::Head & Lacing::''- The head retains itself quite well but you will notice after a while that it will start to fade. Very foamy view from the top of the glass, as if I’m visualizing a cloud of foam where I can barely see any porousness. The lacing sticks well to the glass as if it’s not going anywhere for the time being, even when the head starts to fade down more and more.  -''::Nose::''- Right off the back you pick up notes of citrus and pine along with a buried scent of grain alcohol with deeply hidden caramel that indicates the balance of malt and hops overall. It’s hard for me to tell what other aromas linger.  -''::Palate::''- There is a steadily hint of the alcohol blended with citrus and pine straight up front. Of 11.2% ABV you really get the taste of the grain alcohol, but not as much as you would if you were to sip high ABV spirits. It simply doesn't bother me, since I’m use to hard spirits with a rough taste, and in general it just seems quite sessionable regardless. In that regard, I actually develop more appreciation for the alcohol taste as it is backed up by other complex and intense varieties of flavors that tend to sneak in which I can’t really put my finger on.  In the back, the hops creep up nicely, I guess that may be the lingering of the citrus and pine flavor of them steadily undermined by the bittersweet malt flavor, which is indeed quite complicated to comprehend for myself even. I do also get a hint of caramel and maybe somewhat of a rye or whole grain bread flavor but overall this seems to be a stronger version of the ordinary Arrogant Bastard Ale as far as the palate serves. There may be other flavors I can’t pick up, but maybe that is because I am overwhelmed by the mentioned flavors.  Overall with the flavor, there is a pretty good balance of malt and hops, but I think in the end I get more of a balance of the bittersweet malt mixed with the taste of alcohol. I guess one can imagine the taste as if it was a more sessionable Tequila, except it tastes nothing like Tequila and Tequila tastes nothing like it. Especially as it warms up, the malt flavor seems to dominate but when it was cold I was definitely able to sense the balance of hops up with the malt.  -''::Overall::'- This is just about the best damn beer I ever had. Demonstrated is a very relinquishing balance of hops and malt with a pleasant blended hint of alcohol along with other varieties of complex flavors. Not much more can be expected or should be expected here. I always wish for every beer I have had though, that the flavor can have more bitterness to it. On the definite side, this is definitely just a stronger and more improved Arrogant Bastard Ale.  It was either this or the Oaked Arrogant Bastard I was posed with getting at the Liquor Store just the other day and needless to say, I am delightfully satisfied. Next time I’ll be sure to pick up the Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale and do a review on that as well. Taking a look at the beer is also a site to see, especially for those beer enthusiasts. Aroma is heavily inviting for the next sip with the palate to back it up. Lacing remains to stick to the glass from the start.  Pours with ease and it’s not for the weak hearted to drink as it mentions on the bottle. Be warned though, you will taste the alcohol. However, I think the alcohol taste is simply the best thing about this beer because it gives it that robust spark to back up the palate just a little bit more than an ordinary beer would with a lesser ABV.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Not sure how long this has been sitting on the shelf:  It has a nice smooth red copper appearance with a non-heady pour. I was expecting this to be a way too strong IPA, but its not and i was pleasantly surprised. Sometimes the high alcohol content makes me feel like I'm drinking vodka and not a beer.

The aroma has a lot of piney, resinous, earthy hops, citrus notes, bready malt and caramel notes.  The taste also has a lot of hops. Very piney/earthy, spicy, orange and grapefruit notes, bready malt backbone and a nice amount of caramel too. Very bitter, but some of the sweetness from the fruit and caramel helps to balance it.  A medium body with a silky smooth dry finish. Very easy to drink for being so strong and bitter. No trace of alcohol except for a warming sensation down your throat. Pretty balanced for this style.

147,1056,JamesMN,4.12,"Appearance: Translucent maroon/mahogany hue with a soapy off-white one finger head.  Aroma: Lots of malt. Great caramel aroma with a candied pineapple smell from the hops.  Taste: Not recklessly bitter like I was expecting but still a tongue stinger. The malt bill sticks to the usual caramel and crystal strains you get in the regular Arrogant Bastard but is a little more syrupy here. The hop presence is not as flavorful as I expected. Piny just a hint of citrus and the rest is devoted to pure bitterness. Most of it seems to hit your palate on the back end and in the aftertaste. Lovely dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Just about full bodied with average drinkability. Not quite the robust palate engulfing experience I anticipated.  Final Thoughts: High expectations have led to a somewhat disheartened, yet satisfying experience. I think I actually like the regular Arrogant Bastard Ale more than this one but it is still a very good beer that I like to think I'm 'worthy of'. Would I drink it again? Yes, I will probably pick up next year's release.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Also decided to review it before having my udon with red rooster sauce rather than after.  A: Thick semi hazy reddish brown. Perfect amount of carbonation. Head is a little weak at first but leaves good lacing.  S: Very balanced with some good floral hop notes but also some woody herbaciousness. Some sweetness as well. A hint of citrus in there. Very complex.  T: If there was a beer that tasted a 5 this would be it. Hits you at first with the hops which are sharp and not overwhelming. Then it comes in with a woody earthiness that is a sharp contrast to the floral notes at the start. As the taste fades you get hit with some citrus orange lemon acid which again, is in contrast to the previous flavors. Then the bittereness comes back in the end to finish it out. Goes does exceptionally smooth for such a high ABV and the amount of control here is insane.  M: carbonation is rather aggressive. Great flavor development but pretty intense.

S- Pungent aroma of ripe, dark fruits (figs, plums), caramel, and a hint of banana. A bit of piney hop aroma pushes through along with a little bready yeast. Super complex nose!  T- The first thing I notice about the taste is that it has a lot of roasty malt and a lot more hop-bitterness than expected from the nose. This is a thick, bready, and complex beer! The caramel sweetness takes over in the middle of the palate before giving way to some fig and raisin. It goes out with a bang, assaulting your palate with a load of dry, bitter, piney/grassy hops.

147,1056,homersimpson67,4.37,"Been thinking about trying this one for awhile. Would love to buy the $100 3 litter bottle at my local beer establishment. Not sure how to chill it though. Settled for a nice 22oz bomber. Not dissapointed! Yes it is strong. As the bottle states ""diatribe"" on the label a perfect discription to say the least. Pours a lovely dark mahogany into my favorite tulip. At least 2 fingers of glorious white foam that settles into and excellent lacing of delicate bubbles. This smells like Christmas, sweet and spicey and everything nicey.(sorry about that one). A very enticing aroma of cranbery and nutmeg with a dash of maybe cinnamin and pumpkin pie. As I slowly pour this over my tongue it hits you right away. Very sugaring and hoppy and I knew this one was loaded. It does remind me of a fresh barley wine type ale and it lingers on my tongue and into my nose for some time after a good swallow. Definately a unique flavor for sure. They certainly didn't hold back on the suger and hops! It feels great but as the label implies it is not for the weak. This is a one to sip slowly and cautiously and let it warm a little as I believe the flavor gets more complex over time. Again if you try read the label, it says it all. Stone is really wise in its ways and has again come up with a winner! Yummy. I will sleep with a smile.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The nuts are more pronounced in the taste than the smell. The alcohol is there, but it's hard to tell it's over 11%.  M: Medium to heavy bodied with very good carbonation. Just how a Strong Ale should be.  O: This beer is not for the weak! It'll slap you around and ask you if you're ready for more. If a dominatrix was turned into a beer, this would be it.

Pretty silent looking copper orange body with a solid finger of off white to khaki head that retains and laces well, not much in the way of alcohol legs.  Loads and loads of dense hop notes... bitter dry grapefruit, dripping with tropical fruit syrups, puree, absolutely delightful in this respect... some caramel and faint cinnamon beneath all of that, no real booze character to be spoken for.  Even bigger to the tongue... harsh bitterness plays alongside a more noticeable alcohol presence, tremendous hop bill is very obvious, not quite as smooth and tame as the nose would suggest.

147,1056,ThisWangsChung,3.96,"22 oz. bottle poured into a Duvel tulip.  A: Pours a very dark ruby brown color with very little clarity. The head is nice for 11.2% - a one finger light mocha color with nice retention and a wonderful texture. It looks almost like cream floating on top of the beer. There's a nice sheet of lacing down the glass, as well.  S: Don't know why, but the aroma isn't as explosive as I anticipated. The usual suspects of caramel, toffee, and nuttiness are there along with the piny/citrusy hops one would expect from a bastard, but I kind of expected a little more in general.  T: Well, it tastes just like a stronger version of Arrogant Bastard does; I don't know why i expected something different. Nuttiness is strong from the get go, while the finish is a classic Arrogant Bastard 'sneak-up-on-you-with-oily-pine-flavors'. There seems to be a slightly brighter presence of citrus near the finish, and - naturally - the aftertaste is fairly boozy. I can't seem to pick up the faint vanilla presence other reviewers are detecting. The lack of complexity given its gravity is disappointing...but the Arrogant Bastard has never been about finesse, balance, subtlety, or nuance, has he?! Not quite as sweet as I expected, luckily.  M: Smooth and thick like a milkshake - right up until the hop oils sneak up on you. I love the feel of this in general; the boozy/resiny linger on the palate works perfectly for what this is trying to accomplish.  O: Every time Stone lets me down (see: 16th Anniversary IPA, SSR, IPA, and IRS to a lesser extent), I have something from them that restores my faith in them (see: 15th Anniversary black ale and Mint Chocolate Imperial Stout). So I guess this is another beer that helps raise my opinion of Stone somewhat? The shameless, heavy handed nature of Double Bastard is what gives it its charm - it's the ephitet ""fuck you"" in beer form. I don't really like Arrogant Bastard anymore, so it's good to know that someone else in the bastard family can come through for me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Taste: This stuff is intense. Hops galore. A nice malt back ground but really in the back ground. It is hard for me to even identify other tastes but the malt adds a little sweetness and there might be some caramel.  It has a nice creamy finish but the hops are just there to stay.

Yeast comes alive slowly, building up to two fingers of head that receds into a light lacing over a couple of minutes. Looks thick and strong  S - The nose is a balance of sour hoppy character wrapped in a sweet, malty caramel. Mild whisky note floating just beneath. Not the strongest smelling beer, but you can sense that there's alot going on here.  T - Balanced and powerful. Immediate hop bitterness and malty sweetness. Caramel, deep biscuity flavors, mild smokey presence underneath a massive hop dose. As I was hoping, this has all the notes of and Arrogant Bastard, only much more bang for the buck. Intense and powerful, not recommended for a novice craft drinker. The hop presence is huge and bitter with mild citrus, but it doesn't detract from the malt body, which is as sweet as the hops are bitter. Impressive flavor, and a definite palate-breaker. High alcohol comes through on the back end.  M - Very thick, very active carbonation. Goes down smooth considering the abv and body. Not something I'd drink to feel refreshed, but as strong as it is, it's still tolerably drinkable.  O - Intensity has always been Stone Brewing's strong point, and this beer is no exception. It's explosive, punchy, and flavorful. Not something I'd like to have on a day-to-day basis, but worth the money every so often.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Hoppy pine resin... bitter sweet taste that stays forever.  M- smooth and creamy.

147,1056,Jagen,4.05,"Poured from bomber into snifter A – pours with an amber, two finger white head with great retention. Very dark red amber color…hard to see through to the other side unless held up to a light. Head very slowly fades away leaving minimal lacing on the side…fades to a mild amount of head retention. A ruby red color is a very accurate description S – mm…very present hop notes. Nice, sweet, and fruity. When you take a very deep smell of it, you can definitely feel the alcohol lingering in the background T Wow! This truly deserves the name double bastard…everything that arrogant bastard has but doubled. Strong alcohol bite in the front with a hoppy/malty finish. Makes you question your hubris for daring to drink this bomber by yourself! This is a fresh bomber that I just bought. I now know the bastard…but I do not know if it will set me free. As I have never had this before (I think I may have had it on tap in the past…no way of verifying), I look forward to seeing how the rest of my bottles will age. The aftertaste is the hop character lingering…very strong hop character that attacks you immediately. This is cold right out of my car (has sat there during my work shift…low 30’s when I left work)…going to continue this review when it warms up. The alcohol and hop character seem a little overwhelming right now..as it warms. The heat leaves a little leaving way to a deliciously strong, hoppy character beer with a strong malt profile in the background M When cold, it feels very carbonated. The carbonation and hops attack your mouth and seek to control it…not necessarily bad, but almost overwhelming! O While I really enjoy this beer, I think it is a little hot fresh. I look forward to seeing how this evolves in the future…If I didn’t have a twelve hour grace period to recover from this, I would say that I was the arrogant bastard for daring to drink this solo…I will be working out my mouth and liver to deal with this bastard. This is a damned good beer. My one regret is drinking it so fresh but I am also reminded that I have a few sitting in the cellar waiting for the right opportunity to be unleashed",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Ranz,4.71,"Poured into my whiskey snifter, it pours a beautiful copper red with a nice head that dissipates maybe a bit too quickly. The aroma: malt buscuit with a thick yeasty undertone. The hops provide a nice contrast, too.  Flavor-wise, this thing shines. Wow: I've really enjoyed the Oaked Bastard, but this pushes the hoppiness a bit further. Nicely carbonated, the malt and hops linger on the tongue. The mouthfeel is nice and thick but not overwhelming.  Overall, this thing is slightly better than the Oaked, maybe on the same plane. I need to go grab another bottle and let it age.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,ESPNman,4.06,"2012 Vintage, poured into a Stone IRS Snifter  A - This beer pours a deep rusty orange, leaving two fingers of thick orange-white head that sticks around for a good long time. It leaves less lacing than I would expect given the volume of head produced.  S - There is certainly plenty of alcohol on the nose. It's not surprising, given the 11%+ ABV in this year's batch, but it's still a little overwhelming. Thick sweet malts, and a bit of fruit are there in the background as well. This one will certainly get better with a little time in the cellar.  T - Much like the nose, this one is a little on the boozy side. There's a good bit of aggressive bitterness that attacks the palate once the booze clears. There's a slight hint of the sweetness from the nose. It's a faint touch of roasted malt. From there, this beer features some serious hop punch with a brutally bitter finish. This beer is not balanced, but is delicious.  M - It lacks the thickness that I normally associate with an American Strong Ale of this ABV. It's surprisingly drinkable. Moderate carbonation. It gets better as it warms up, as it can be a little abrasive when served right out the fridge.  O - Double Bastard is one of my favorite beers.... after a few years. I'm looking forward to doing a 4-5 year vertical with these. Fresh, it's a little on the abrasive side. There's great flavor and smell there, but it's all a little overwhelmed by the ABV.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,CommanderOfAwesome,5,"2012 poured from 22 oz into a snifter. This is one of my favorite beers, and the beer that GOT me into craft beer. I've had it many times and not sure I'm rational about it.  A: Pours a Deep Amber. Able to see it through it, but it looks glorious. Slightly cloudy with little head.  S: I think I can smell this across the room. Very strong sweet dark fruits, getting cherries, and a strong booze smell.  T: Ohhh the taste. Close to perfection in a non stout that you can get. Sweet but slams with the bitter at the end. Some brown sugar and caramel in there as well if you dare to let it sit on your tongue.  M: Sticky, andfull bodied. This year's is very boozy and I will let my other bottles sit a bit to calm down...  O: I love this beer. Its fantastic and a must try.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,kevanb,4.3,"2011 Release, poured into a Delerium Noel stemmed glass, enjoyed on 9/10/2012.  Double Bastard pours a lovely burgundy color, hints of ruby red and garnet when held to the light. Fairly clear, but a bit muddled, the deepness of the amber color helps this expression. A lovely finger of tight bone colored head sits atop the beer, survives for about a minute or so before receding into a soapy layer of film and leaves behind a great webbed network of lace. The aroma starts with some nice rich malty sweetness, caramel, nougat, soft brown bread, brown sugar with some faint alcohol sweetness. A nice amount of citrusy and piney hops spring forward as well, wonderful complexity. The flavors are right in line with the nose, rich caramel sweetness, brown sugar, dark fruits that pair well with bitter piney hops, hints of citrus, perhaps orange peel. The beer is certainly hot, alcohol is very present in the flavors, much more so than the aromas led on. The body is spot on, big, full, syrupy, yet carbonated to perfection that lets this beer be sipped or quaffed.  Verdict: One of the gold standard strong ales. Great blend of rich and bready malts, pungent piney hops with just enough citrus to keep things interesting. This is aging spectacularly well, I'd love to try this after a full year or even 18 months to see if the alcohol will mellow on the tongue.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,jjboesen,4.7,"""Ye shall know the Bastard, and the Bastard shall set you Free."" So warns the label.  This Bastard begins with fulminating foam that shimmers and shines atop a cloudied copper body. What little light gets through isreflected along the bottom ridge of the glass.  The nose is distracted with quick whiffs of cider, grass, honey and raisin - it's as if a farmers' market farted. The paltate is washed out in a thin veneer of oat, malt and tangy hay that is supported by an intense backing of alcohol. The finish is sharp enough to cut your tongue.  There is thick and chewy mouthfeel that numbs you with an oily, yet gummy, maltiness.  No sessional quaff is this: it is for adult palates with enough sophistication to endure the complexity. At the end, this is a damn good beer that is worth the workout. Think of it as taking your palate to the gym. Note: it took two hours to finish a bomber of this magnificant Bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,pmlondrigan,4.16,"2011 vintage. Great pour, garnet glowing red. Two finger tan foam, sticky lacing with good retention. On the nose you pick up bready malts, some light faint citrus and grapefruit, caramel, and some spicy toast. Warm and bready with some hop presence, but a muted one. Somewhat sherry like. Rather long finish of pithyness. A strong beer with reasonably well concealed alcohol. A slightly syrupy brew but with decent carbonation to livin' it up. I have had this fresh and with a little age, a little age is the way to go. Fresh this beer is hot, hoppy and well....yucky. But add some time and it mellows and turns into this lovely beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Danny1217,4.5,"A nice dark copper color with a thick off-white head. Good retention. Brown sugar, caramel, hops, and citrus on the nose. Taste of sweet caramel, bread, bitter hops, and a slight alcohol finish. Like a double IPA, only a bit darker. Delicious. Thick mouthfeel with medium carbonation.  Amont my favorite beers of all time. Even better than the regular bastard.  Note: This bottle was a year old. I've had it fresh and at a year old, and it's much better after waiting. It's not bad at all fresh, just slightly too hot. Give it a year to mellow out, and I promise you'll be glad you did.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Not too thick but not watery.  O- A solid beer worthy of aging.

Smell: Strong floral and citrus hops with some pine mixed in. Also some brown sugar sweetness.  Taste: Very similar to the nose. Toasty brown sugar and sweet caramel are dominant but not overshadowing of bitter hops. Hops provide some piney aspects, but mostly served just to add bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Sticky and a sipper for sure. No trace of the alcohol.

Pours a ruby brown that is cleat with a minimal tan head that leaves no lacing of note. Aroma is wonderful and hanged and progresses massively. Chocolate, caramel, syrup, malt, dried fruit. The taste isn't nearly as complex, though is quite nice with a ton of malt going on in it too. Raisins, pepper, caramel sweetness and a hint of earthiness.

147,1056,dbrauneis,4.02,A: Pours a cloudy copper in color. The beer has a finger tall dark beige head that quickly reduces to a small patch of thin film and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate to significant lacing is observed.  S: Strong aromas of caramel malts and brown sugar along with some lighter notes of citrus and pine/resin hops. Additionally there is some moderate amounts of alcohol present.  T: This beer is extremely malty with a ton of caramel malt & toffee malt sweetness and quite a bit of brown sugar/molasses as well. There is also a moderate amount of hop presence and bitterness from the citrus and pine/resin hops. Light alcohol presence and the flavors seem to get even more complex as it warms.  M: On the fuller side of medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly sticky with some dryness in the finish.  O: Seems to be right on the border of a American Strong Ale and an American Barleywine - the presence of the alcohol is not well hidden (I would have liked it to be more well hidden). There is a nice complexity to the smell and taste. Not the easiest beer to drink and needs to be sipped slowly over the course of a couple of hours.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,jaasen64,4.2,"On-tap at Yardhouse Fenway. 2011 vintage. Served in a goblet.  A- Dark mahogany brown, barely translucent, about three fingers of brownish off-white creamy head that slowly recedes, average to slightly above average carbonation. Tons of layered lacing.  S- Sweet smelling of bready malts, caramel, hops, and a little bit of pine + booze in the background. Definitely a little bit more aromatic then your average beer.  T- Sweet bready malts, caramel, followed by bitter hops that have a very slight piney taste. Lightly sweet boozey aftertaste.  M- A little bit creamy but fairly medium bodied, especially at the beginning before the head recedes. Average carbonation. Well-balanced. Smooth for 10.5% abv but not the smoothest 10.5% beer I've had- still a little bit of alcoholic burn going down, not bad though. Easily drinkable.  O- This was a very well done Ale that I wouldn't mind ordering again in the future. It had a nice sweetness that was balanced with a generous amount of hops. For 10.5% it was easily drinkable. In my opinion it was nothing spectacular, but definitely well done. I would recommend trying it. For $7/pint it wasn't too bad.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,Darkmagus82,4.44,"Poured from 22 oz bomber into snifter  Appearance –Pours a hazy brown mahogany color with a small off white head. The head fades fast to leave a very persistent white foam film on the top of the brew.  Smell – A bready base aroma is mixed with huge hop aromas. There are big smells of bitter-resinous pine and citrus hop with other aromas of earthy nature. Mixed with all these are lighter fruit aromas and a good bit of alcohol aroma as well; rounding out the aroma profile well.  Taste – Throughout the taste there is a massive bready malt flavor. There is a light amount of caramel and light fruit sweetness at first mixed with a citrus hop flavor. The hop flavors at the beginning, while average for an IPA, then really start to gain strength. Citrus and pine hops start getting strong and start to bring some bitterness. The caramel sweetness is largely lost, but the citrus is still there. While the pine and citrus get stronger, they get huge and other hop flavors of a resinous earthy taste come to the tongue. All the hop flavors mix quite well and take the taste to the end, where they are greeted with a warming and lightly burning alcohol flavor, which oddly in some ways complements the hop quite well.  Mouthfeel –The body of the beer is creamy and chewy with all those flavors really coating the mouth in all the wonderful flavors. The lower carbonation only accentuates the creaminess with it also accentuating the hop and booze burn as well.  Overall – Very heavy and tasty. Its mouthfeel is fantastic and it has a nice blend of hop and booze taste. A great brew for sipping nice and slow.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,mjtiernan,4.3,"22oz bottle poured into a Teku tulip at fridge temp. 2010 release, no bottle dating found.  A: A not-so-attractive “dirty water” medium brown. Basically zero head although that may be more due to the cold temp that I poured it at. Slight ring around the edge. Between the color and the head, there isn’t much here that’s drawing me in.  S: Tons of sweet syrupy malt. Graham cracker and light molasses. Some alcohol and vanilla.  T: Oh man, this is way better than I expected. Very many barleywine characteristics. The flavors meld together nicely and it isn’t nearly as cloying as the nose indicated. It’s much like the nose, but there’s a muted solidarity in the flavor profile that keeps it from becoming too much. With all its intensity, I can’t believe how smooth this is.  M: Body is medium to full, texture a bit syrupy, carb soft and finish is moderately alcoholic.  O: Wow. I immediately regret buying only a single bottle because I’d like to try this again in 2-3 years. I don’t know what this was like fresh, but it’s drinking very nicely now.

Flavor is strong, relatively malt-driven and reminiscent of a barleywine. In fact, this reminds me an awful lot of Bigfoot with a year or so on it. Heavy, sweet caramel notes, nuttiness, figs, prickly pine hop notes, very light alcohol.  Medium mouthfeel; easy to put back.  I think I'd rather this one fresh--this kind of tasted like an American barleywine once the hops had settled a bit.

147,1056,ChrisPratz,4.92,"22 oz Bomber bottle, 2011 release. First time with the Double Bastard, i'm hearing it will def live up to its hype. So here we go!  A: Deep rich mahogany color with almost 2 fingers of light brown to tan colored head. Im spying nice tiny bubbles instead of the huge carbonated bubbles. These lead way to a wonderful lacing that didn't appear until the head disappeared over 5 minutes after the our. This was from a 22 oz bomber glass but the head remains like its from a nitro can or bottle. Everything I expected from an Arrogant Bastard.  S: Im still working with a developing palette but the aromas here are incredible. Initial fragrance reminded me of Christmas cookies for some reason. Sweetness of cinnamon, brown sugar, cherries and figs. Almost has a doughy yeast scent as well. Everything smells delicious.  T: Def did not disappoint. Sweetness from the start. Cherries and figs are coming thru, and then possibly leading to pineapple and then the bitter/sour grapefruit. Picking up on earthly tones, malts and pine and this is where the alcohol starts to hit the tongue as well. Alcohol is noticeable but doesn't take anything away from the taste. With each sip, as it hits my lips I keep getting flashbacks of Christmas cookies as a kid. Really really enjoying this, maybe even more then the regular Bastard.  M: Mild carbonation hits your tongue sharply at first and then smooths away to nothing. As I only filled a pint glass worth at a time, I found when I went to finish the bottle and the carbonation dissipated, it brought out more fo the flavors. After taste is slightly dry due to ABV, but im left with an almost creaminess feeling.  O: Can't say I expect much more from a brew. Stone really has done well with this complex little treat, even to a relatively new and developing palette.

Taste - Tastes like an Arrogant Bastard x2…more like an American Barleywine. Almost reminds me of Bigfoot but sweeter and better. The 10.5% feels warming and good going down but the alcohol is hidden well in the taste. There's a nice fruity flavor with plenty of hops as well. As it warms, the alcohol begins to creep into the taste a little more but it never gets over powering.  Mouthfeel: Medium and perfect for the style.

147,1056,RBassSFHOPit2ME,4.05,"One of Stone's Claim to Fame! I've had quite a few of these over the years but still have yet to review so here goes...but first I'll note, I've enjoyed this beer most uber fresh OR with close to two years of age on it.  The bottle in review is 2011 vintage:  A - Dark cherry red or Mahogony in color, semi- active in the 12oz La Chouffe Tulip I poured it in. One inch head rises from semi-aggressive pour but quickly diminishes. Not much in the rhelm of lacing...GOOD  S - Piney-Prickly hops with sweet pineapple smelling malts and grapefruit. There is also a good scent of cherries in there as well with moderate alcohol fumes. The problem with the Cherry mixing with the alcohol fumes is that it's faintly reminiscent of the smell of cherry cough syrup without ruining the smell of the beer, if that makes any sense...  T - Pretty much same as the nose. This beer is not short on flavor, that's for sure. As it warms it becomes boozier and a sour apple flavor comes into the mix. The mild reminder of Cherry cough syrup is there but again, not ruining the experience. Although the term Strong Ale or ""category"" is loosely used, this hits it on the head. This is what I would define a stong ale to be.  M - Phenominal for a beer of this magnitude or of 10.5%. Almost as if a big Imperial Red were infused with a Barleywine. The mouthfeel and taste come so close to just walking that fine line of being a Barleywine but was a wee bit shy of making it there. Still a tad bit too boozy, otherwise I would have given the mouthfeel a 5 score.  O - Very good beer. I think this 2011 vintage will be better in a year.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,sevenarts,4.56,"A: Dense, murky orange-red, with a tan head that quickly bubbles away to almost nothing. Some lacing.  S: The best part of the beer. Lots of grapefruit hops, very sweet-smelling and fruity. Some grassy vegetative smells blended in, and a touch of the bitterness from the hops.  T: Much more bitter and mouth-puckering than the smell. The hops hit strong up front and gradually give way to a sweeter grapefruit-heavy finish. Some warming alcohol on the way down, though it's otherwise very well hidden. Typically delicious and intense Stone offering, but also very smooth and creamy despite the heavy flavors.  O: Another great offering in the Bastard line.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Looks sticky and big. The nose is malty sweet upfront with a definitive caramel malt character. Hints of earthy hops and heat and perhaps even a touch of raisin, though mostly malt. The flavor is rich and bold with the caramel malt sweetness found in the tongue being most prominent. The earthy hop characted provides enough bitterness and flavor to provide a very balanced beer. Very creamy and smooth throughout the beer finishes sticky with a lingering mild bitterness and pleasant sweetness. Very good. Though the alcohol was present in the nose, it's indiscernible in the flavor. Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, very drinkable for such a big beer.

Pours russet brown with 1.5 fingers rich cream head. Fair lacing.   The smell is a nice blend of tropical hops and sweet biscuity caramel malts.   Taste delivers on the smell. A simultanious punch of big sweet malts and orangey hops. Bold, unforgiving and tasty. The alcohol kick blends nicely.   Mouthfeel is moderately thick without much carbonation at all to get in the way. Fairly resinous, coating the tongue for a long bitter hoppy aftertaste.   All in all this is a damn fine beer.

Smell: Aroma fruity (pineapple/melon) with a solid sweet and malty backbone- yet the hops linger just beyond Taste: Aggressive assault of malty sweetness with a thick layer of hops hanging on for dear life. Malts are deep with notes of cocoa, light coffee, caramel with piney hops lingering straight through to the end of the tasting. Alcohol warmth is a bit more of a burn. Extremely complex and strong beer. These qualities intensify as the beer warms. Mouthfeel: Thick and brutally warm and smooth.

When I opened the bottle and poured the beer into a large snifter, the gorgeous and powerful aromas stroke me at once. The beer looked nice and the head was pretty big, it left some remains on the glass afterwards. The smell was big and bold, the smells of a regular am. IPA was there with its tropic fruits, but I also smelled sweeter notes, more of pineapple than grapefruit. When I tasted it, it felt crazy. So much to handle here! It was sweet at first, syrup and honeymelon I would call it. Pretty cool with the hints of melon, it was probably the contrast with the bitter, hoppy finish which created the sensation also. Not superhoppy, but hoppy. The feel was heavy too, you didnt feel much of the alcohol but you felt the heavyness of it all. Maybe a bit extreme and powerful to me, but I still liked it.

Feels incredibly smooth for such a big beer. The medium body is almost viscous and is dangerously drinkable.  A classic for sure, almost a barleywine.

147,1056,BarryMFBurton,4.12,"Stone at it again: here comes the Double Bastard. The original Arrogant Bastard was one of my first go-to craft brews, and the Oaked version was even better; let’s see how this Bastard stands the double treatment.  “Winter 2011 Release” on the back of the bottle, so it’s about four months old or so.  A: Looks like a homemade apple cider, a thick, earthy body with a reddish-brown hue. For about a minute after I pour, a group of bubbles moves from the outside of the glass (completely encircling it) to the top of the body. It culminates in a thin, fizzy head, which is completely gone in just a quick second; seriously, with this body color and lack of any carbonation, it looks like fruit juice. Actually, there’s a little bit of light cream just around the edges of the glass.  S: Not a ton of hoppy aromas, but a big caramel maltiness front and center. Fig, cinnamon-raisin, wheat toast, and honey, just as malty and earthy as can be. Robust alcohol reaches out with resiny woodiness, herbal spice, and brandy-like sweetness. A little pineapple and mango hoppiness shows through as it’s wrapping up, leaving the nose light, yet still mostly dark and fruity.  T: Strong, bold! Really, everything is huge: the malts are rich, the alcohol is spicy, the hops are puckering. Full-flavored tastes of citrus wheat, caramel, brown sugar, roast, and dried cherries from these syrupy, earthy grains. In just a smooth second, though, it’s all about hops: piney, resiny, and thickly bitter (like hop syrup, pretty much). Essentially, I’m getting a loveable balance in a moment of pure, glorious power. And then there’s some peppery alcohol and warm apple cider flavors, like some kind of spiked juice; sweet, bold, and deep. Finishes with sweet hop oils, a big salty dryness, and pure lemon juice.  M: Like the palate, it’s oily. The carbonation is tiny, like the lack of head suggested, so the beer remains chewy for most of its drink. Still, it leaves a lasting impression with its heat and astringency.  O: The best Bastard yet – an excellent beer. I think the label “American Strong Ale” is the perfect description for Double Bastard: it’s definitely strong. I’d buy this again, especially to age…who knows what it would be like in a year and-a-half?",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

This monster brew has a deep earthy, umber maroon color with a full 3 finger that settles down to nice carbonation and retention that laces the glass as if sticky.  I get lots of caramel malts, alcohol, pine, oily hops, some darker fruits underneath, a slight earthiness and a slight smoky wood.  This yells smoothness from the initial sip. It has a medium body, nice carbonation retention, even as the beer warms. I get caramel and pineapple citrus right off the bat, alcohol warmth, hops, oily slick chewy piney alcohol middle and a nice warm ending with more of a caramel and malty sweetness and more balanced alcohol warmth. superbly balanced for such a potent brew.

S: The nose has aromas of caramel malts along with notes of brown sugar and citrus and pine resin hops and hints of alcohol. T: There are definitely a lot of malts in a beer this strong and flavors of caramel malts are very prominent. A moderate amount of bitterness from the hops is present, as well as some hints of alcohol, brown sugar, malty sweetness and toffee. The taste seems to become more complex as the beer warms up. M: It feels medium- to full-bodied and slightly sticky on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. The finish is rather dry. O: This beer almost tastes like a “lighter” version of an American barleywine but has rather intense flavors of malts and hops. It is definitely a beer that needs to be slowly sipped.

Pours a medium to dark orange amber with a one finger very light fine tan head and lacing. Looks nice. Delicious aroma of dark fruit, intense caramel malt and a hint of citrus. Medium bodied with some creaminess. Taste is well integrated citrus, dark fruit, citrus (especially orange) and malt, changing to an astringent and long lasting bitter finish. The start is absolutely well integrated and delicious, but the finish is just too bitter without an herbal balance. This is a 2009 cellared bottle and I note that the astringency of the finish was an issue for me with the fresh bottle. I hope this mellows out in a year or so.

Not so much retention really, leaving a ring around the glass, and some lacing at the top of the glass only.  Smell is of citrus hops and as it warms up, honey and some sweetness from the malt.  Served cold, at first I got a mouthfull of hops. Citrus, and pretty resiny. Don't get me wrong, this was fine, but I knew there had to be much more to this beer. Luckily, as it warmed up, I started to get a sense of honey, raisins, and an almost confectionery sweetness. The alcohol was really well hidden, but occasionally poked up and showed its face.  And in all honesty, the mouthfeel had me just as enthralled as the taste - if not more. Smooth and creamy. Heavenly, in fact. 5 points!  This is a beer that's definitely got a lot going for it.

147,1056,Spider889,4.16,"On draft at Winking Lizard in December, review from notes.  Served in a true tulip - nice one WL, stepping up your game.  The beer is a deep unfiltered plum color. Showcases a short but dense meringue of bone-white foam. Decent head retention and sticky, chunky lace cling to my glass.  The aroma is very unassuming - some soap and leather are what first catch my attention. The hop aroma isn't very big like you might expect coming from Stone (and considering the taste).  Great flavor on this Strong Ale. Very bitter - though this likely balances out an otherwise extremely sweet beer. Dry malt flavors and toffee with some dried cherries and herbal hop flavor. Pine and a subtle sticky sweetness underlie it all.  There's some chalkiness to the mouthfeel, and of course the long-lasting and pervasive bitterness. Strong and boozy, but Double Bastard delivers exactly what you'd expect.  Overall this is a beer that needs to be sipped slowly, and is not something to imbibe in regularly.

I also get slight hints of dark fruits.  T- I'm biased here since this is one of my favorite beers. A nice hop hit up front, with great piney characters. I also get some hints of an oakiness in this beer. There is also a good alcohol bite, with each sip finishing with a nice warming sensation from the alcohol.  M- Medium bodied, good alcohol bite.

The taste starts out quite sweet with some light citrus coming in next, much like an Imperial IPA. There is then a transition to the darker fruits more typical in a Barleywine. There is some vanilla along with wood towards the finish. A fairly strong bitterness comes in at the end along with some pineapple. Finally there is a somewhat drying bitterness with hints of tobacco.  Overall this is a very complex and enjoyable beer. There is so much going on and it constantly changes as the beer warms.

Elements in the smell include oranges, melons, roasted marshmallows, red grapes, lemon cream biscuits and some glazed cherries.  T: The taste comes in three distinct phases: 1)As the beer enters your mouth, there is a seductive sweetness that envelopes the mouth, including flavours of glazed cherries and sugared pineapple, but 2) very shortly after, a piney bitterness starts descending on your mouth, depositing a vanilla like taste on the tongue. 3) This then turns into a relentless bitterness upon swallow that will stay with you until the next sip.

Appearance: A rough pour yields a massive, ultra thick, yellow-tinged head that displays immense staying power. The lacing is not quite as good as I expected, however a light swirl coats the glass in beautiful alcohol legs. The body seems thick and is a stunning combination of glowing red, orange and amber. Double Bastard is certainly one of the best looking beers I have had recently!  Smell: Absolutely delicious! Double Bastard smells like a massive IPA crossed with a sweet barley wine. The initial aroma is of orange zest, grapefruit pith, bitter resin, marmalade, sweet melon, pineapple, lemon zest and caramel malt. As the beer warms, the nose becomes a lot sweeter with more caramel malt as well as brown sugar, toasted malt, sweet glazed cherries and strawberries. While Alcohol is noted through a light tickle in the nose, it is far from bothersome and adds another dimension to an already complex nose.  Taste: As expected, Double Bastard is one beast of a beer! The boys at stone must have thrown every last hop in California into this to cover up such a monolithic malt base! The initial flavour is that of sweet caramel malt, brown sugar, toasted grain and glazed cherries, this is quickly overtaken by a tongue shredding bitterness and a wealth of hop flavours including orange zest, grapefruit pith, resin and a certain leafy/herbal quality.  Mouthfeel: Now this is what a big beer should feel like! Full body, lightly sticky with a low level of stunningly smooth carbonation.  Overall: Does Double Bastard make me feel unworthy?

My beer fridge is currently chock full of beers I haven’t had before, so consequently, I have to drink and review them, not just drink them. Sometimes, I’d rather just knock a good one down, but here I go…please disregard the complaining. My apologies. One should not bitch about having a full beer fridge.  A: Oh my, this beer could be somebody. It’s dark amber in color, and opaque; you can’t see through it, and it’s scaring me. In a good way, that is. The head is light tan in color, 2 cm with a decent pour, and holds for more than two minutes (my benchmark for a good head) before dissolving into lace. I’m optimistic; looking forward to getting my nose into this one.  S: Oh wow, this beer smells like somebody. I’ve been drinking low-ABV lagers, building my tolerance up after fighting cancer, and now I’ve got a beer that I can tell could be big league. At first, I’m getting a blend of caramel, prunes and citrus hops, most likely grapefruit or blood orange. Not only that, the smells are powerful, rather than weak or hanging out in the background; it’s really in-your-face. Me likey!  T: Oh. My. God. Ach. Mein. Gott. Ay. Dios. Mio. O. Mon. Dieu. This beer is fantastic in thirty six languages. I can taste everything I smelled, in the best proportions I’ve experienced in quite some time. I can also taste the alcohol, which, in this case, is welcome. It’s more sweet than bitter, which I find surprising, but amazing. I’m so glad I was smart enough to eat something beforehand; this beer packs a bit of a wallop. I don’t know how to put this, other than to describe it as rich. Oh yeah!  M: Outstanding.

My palate is currently air-guitaring Side 1 of Rush’s ‘2112’ album. And the finish is unbelievably dry, especially given how sweet this beer is. Get your party on! You are NOT ready for this!  O: I’m not a hipster, or one who knocks beers just to knock them.

Body is a deep reddish amber, slightly hazy but not much. Basically no lacing, just a couple of spots. It’s not a huge surprise from something 10.5% alcohol, but at the same time the way they hop these Bastards I was expecting more.  Smell (3.5): There’s a very strong, caramel sweetness that comes out first, underlying some bright, fruity apple-like tones. Hop presence is minimal in the nose, just some light grassy and tropical fruit notes behind the malt body.  Taste (4.5): Fortunately, this is where DB really delivers. The big, strong caramel sweetness is there, underpinned by a toasted quality to the malt. Raisins and dark bread, like rye pumpernickel or something along those lines, pop out of the malty body. At the same time, there’s a bright, tropical hop character that floats atop, almost overlooked in the face of that huge malt body. Then the bittering hops lend a very strong presence, giving a grapefruit pithy, piney bitterness that lasts and lasts. Very nice. You can definitely taste the booze, but for something this big, I actually really appreciate it. It’s a reminder that this beer means business.  Mouthfeel (4.0): Very good mouthfeel: it’s got a surprisingly dry finish—very dry, actually—for something so big and sweet. On the full side of medium-bodied, almost thick at times with a slightly syrupy quality to it. Still, the carbonation has two speeds: at once it is surprisingly prickly all over the tongue and velvety at the same time, as a smoothness expands and rolls over the tongue as well.  Overall (4.0): The appearance and smell are certainly lacking on this beer, in my opinion, but the taste is great and the mouthfeel was a surprising high point of the beer, too. It remains true to its name, taking Arrogant Bastard and kicking it in the gut. Granted, this bottle has aged a bit (three, four months tops), but I was still expecting a much bigger hop presence. Had this beer probably three years ago and it was much too much to handle back then, but I can appreciate it now. It’s not a masterpiece but it’s plenty enjoyable. Nice sipping beer, and definitely not everyone is worthy.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,TempeBeerMan,4.68,"Poured from a bottle into a nonic pint.  A – Pours a thick cloudy chestnut brown, with a light beige two finger head that faded quickly. Sticky lacing of small, tight bubbles clings to the glass.  S – Strong aroma of fragrant grassy hops, toffee, and dark fruits.  T – Simply amazing. Initial taste of dank hops with esters of butterscotch, date, sugarplum, black cherry, raisin, crème brulee, and cookie dough, held together with a hearty toffee malt backbone. Flavors are deep, rich and complex. ABV extremely well hidden. Finishes with lingering sweet malt and earthy hops.  M – Medium to full bodied, with subtle carbonation. Works very well with the flavor profile. Sticky finish.  O – What a brew! One for the ages. The richness and complexity of the flavors continuously entices the palate.

Dark sugars in the aroma, and a blast of fruity hops. Taste of dark sugars, malts, caramel, citrus and tropical fruits, woody, notes of dark dried fruits and some pine resin. Full bodied, a little sticky, noticeable alcohol presence, strong, very good overall, but not something you could drink all night. Well maybe you could, but it's definitely not for everyone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,BarleyWineRox,4.5,"Pours a lovely ruby garnet color into my Duvel tulip, with an off-white cap of foam which settles down quickly, no surprise there. Smells of caramelly raisins and bread. Reminds me of Belgian quads on the nose. Need to let it warm a bit. More sweet candied fruits coming out as it warms. Can't wait anymore, need to dive in. Wow! Luscious bursting fruit with a nice hoppy bite on the ending. Very noticeable booziness with a creamy mouth feel. The more I sip the more I am loving it! Another home run from Stone.

147,1056,dannydetox,4.2,"Had a vertical 2010 and 2011 tasting. Both beers poured similarly, with decent initial carbonation that quickly subsided. Aromas of dark malts dominated, with the '10 having some dried fruit/raisiny qualities. The 2010 was noticeably smoother - almost a creamy mouthfeel - while the '11 has all the attack of the Bastard line. Strong, bitter finish on the current release. Some boozy sweetness persists as well, which (not surprisingly) was more pronounced in the 11.25 % 2010 edition.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,DaveBlack,4,"A: Cloudy copper ale with a small 1/2 finger of head but the head sticks around and leaves some nice lacing on the edge of the glass.  S: Big, complex aroma on this beer. Right up front are a ton of super sweet (almost sickly-sweet) and bright smelling malts. The maltiness is then balanced by a hefty hit of hops.  T: No real surprises coming from the flavor, just tasty and solid. A huge caramel malt sweetness upfront with notes of pineapple and burnt suagrs, followed by a huge pine hop taste. There is only a slight hint of the 10.5% ABV in this beer, which isn't surprising given the massive amount of flavor.  M: Sticky, moderate body has a surprising amount of carbonation that keeps it from being too syruppy, but only just. The syruppiness is helped by the oily finish of the hops.  M: Huge flavors, big on both malts and hops, lots of alcohol. What's not to love? It's a solid, strong beer that will damn near knock you over. I wouldn't drink anything that you want to taste afterwards, though.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,californiakebab,4.47,"Rainy day, kind of hungover from the weekend...why not pop open a double bastard ale? Pours a cloudy, amberish brown with a thick, pale caramel head of foam. After a few swirls, I'm picking up a strong aroma of juicy citrus, and fat caramel malt. The raisiny, dark fruity character of crystal malt harmonizes with the heavy dosage of American c-hops for an assertively rich, robust flavor. Huge bitterness on the finish. Medium - full bodied, has a perfect amount of carbonation to keep it from being too heavy. Such an enjoyable beer, so smooth for near 11% abv. The balance achieved between massive malt and massive hops is incredible, making this a world class beer in my book.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Jeffo,4.03,"Doops broke this bottle out as a night capper on New Years Eve. We loved the Arrogant Bastard, so it was cool to check out the steroid version. Good choice my man!  From a bomber into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours a one finger, medium looking, off-white head with good retention. A maroon red body is transparent and shows medium levels of carbonation. Head slowly fades to a good foamy wisp and clings to the sides. A ring remains until the end and leaves lots of nice lacing down the glass. A beauty of a beer.  SMELL: A bolder nose of caramel malts, toffee notes and plenty of hops. Lots of floral hops and some grassy notes.  TASTE: Follows the nose nicely. Caramel and toffee sweetness up front, with a good dose of floral and hop bitterness at the finish. Bold and lingering aftertaste with a good balance of caramel sweetness and bitter, floral hop flavors, with some grassy and piney notes as well.  PALATE: Medium-full body with medium levels of carbonation. Very creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth, no bite, and finishes slightly mouth-coating. Good feel.  OVERALL: Another solid offering from Stone. This is clearly the Arrogant Bastard’s older brother, with more malt on the bill and a greater dose of hops as a counter weight. This one is a sweeter, more caramel and toffee forward brew than the younger sibling, and as a result is a little more simple. Lots of sweetness and lots of bitter hops, but not as much nuanced complexity perhaps. Regardless, we really enjoyed this and I’d gladly pick up more if I saw it. Thanks again for sharing Doops.

147,1056,minterro,4.43,"Big bottle from Horrocks in Lansing  A & S: Very (in your face) citrus tones to this beer. If I’m correct they probably used some Chinook hops in this one, cause it seems a lot like the one I’m brewing now right after flame out, before it got more piney in the fermentor. What might even be more prevalent in the smell beside the citrus hops is the sugary sweetness of this beer. The sweet maltyness complements the citrus tones perfectly. Actually smells a lot like Hop Crisis or vise versa. Dark and dense looking red-orange colored beer. Foamy tan head, that leaves a good amount of lacing clinging to the glass.  T & M: creamy full bodied beer with a pleasant but not overwhelming amount of carbonation. Good lord this beer is smooth. Piney in your burp. Similar to the nose as far as taste goes: the same citrus and sweetness. The malty background is brilliant in this one, making the beer well balanced but still on the hoppy side. The finish is a bit more piney as far a hops goes and is semi bitter. Very drinkable even for being on the heavy side.  O: This beer is right up my alley style-wise and it really is good for the style also → a high rating from me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Clowerweb,4.82,"2011 vintage poured from a 22oz. bottle into a pint glass aggressively.  Been waiting to try this one for a while. It's certainly intimidating after examining the bottle, with the dualing big ugly satanic demon signature Stone logos and insanely well crafted and humorous (but true) text on the back.  A: This one was a lot darker than expected. Very dark amber, bordering on crimson. Hold it up to the light and it almost seems to get darker, defying all logic. Very tiny carbonation bubbles, almost none visible. Three fingers of head with large bubbles, disappears almost completely after a minute, but leaves a nice sticky lace on the glass. This one likes to taunt you. Looks wickedly amazing, little head retention is the only fault I can find in the appearance. This is a gorgeous beer.  S: Smells fruity and hoppy. Very curious nose. Pineapple and/or banana and pine stand out the most. Has a sweet smell. In the words of Jack Black: ""Sweet sassy molassy"". The nose will surprise you on this one. It's not too light, not too pungent. It's perfect. The nose will leave you curious and anxious for a taste. 5/5 perfect.  T: Umm... hard to put this one into words. Every sip takes you on a journey of wild twists and turns. Starts mild with a slight bitter hopiness, then transforms into sweet pineapple, pear, banana, dark fruits, molasses and caramel, with just a perfect hint of smoky roasted malts, that will kick in from nowhere so hard you'll feel it rise through your nasal passages. It finishes on the dry side with the light bitter hops coming back through, but the tropical fruit flavors linger. I don't know how they pulled this off, but it's amazing. I really can't detect the alcohol in this, despite it being 10.5%. Huge kudos. 5/5  M: Chewy, bready, full bodied. I don't pick up on the syrupy feel that others have mentioned, but it is a bit on the thicker side, I wouldn't say syrupy though. Very little carbonation, but just enough to be nearly perfect for its style. I think a TOUCH more carbonation could have benefited it though, but just a touch. Despite what another reviewer said about it being overly carbonated, my bottle had very little, almost too little.  O: This beer lives up to the hype. If you've ever wanted to try it, go for it. If you've been reluctant, don't be. This beer will take your senses on a wild and wonderful ride. Drink the whole 22oz. bottle - it's easy to do because it's so damn smooth and interesting, but it'll give you a nice slap on the ass with it's 10.5% ABV :D  I'm still looking for that perfect 5/5 beer, but this one almost got it. It was so close. Probably the best beer I've ever had, although I was still unfortunately able to find some very very small flaws. This is dangerously close to overall perfect. This almost made me give up that perfect 5/5 review on my 8th beer review.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,BMoldy,4.08,"2009 release served in a St. Bernardus chalice.  A: Deep orange with slightly reddish hues. Surprisingly clear for such a dark brew. A thin light-brown head takes about a minute to settle but leaves behind excellent lacing.  S: Lots of toasted and caramel malts here, with slight undertones of fruit (pineapple?) and oily hops.  T/M: Bold, but very well-balanced, this beer exhibits very little overt trace of alcohol. A nice malty smoothness also stems from a very mild carbonation, making it a good sipper. It's also surprisingly fruity and floral despite being roughly two years old. The body isn't heavy as I would expect and the warmth of the alcohol feels subdued. Tastes a touch syrupy, but otherwise remains relatively drinkable. Ends with bitter smack, then a long sweet finish.  O: Good but not fantastic.

147,1056,BeerMaverick,4.08,"Thanks to Steve Shapiro for this awesome xmas present!  2011 A - I don't know if I'm deemed worthy...a deep amber color with about a half inch of off-white head that dissipates quickly leaving minor lace on the snifter. Insane amount of thought was put into the essay on the back of the bottle...I'm not worthy.  S - Malts flood the aroma with some alcohol burn and fruit character such as apple. Some slight hop presence is here as well.  T - Based on the aroma, I expected this to be a pro-malt beer, but it is exceptionally well balanced with a strong hop profile to keep the malt bill in check. Slight citrusy flavors combine with the bitterness to create a piney and tangy product. Some apple is present here too. After only a few sips I can feel the alcohol...not worthy.  M - This beer is insanely balanced and the malt/hop clash does a great job in hiding the 10.5% (although not completely). Raisin and brown sugar reside in the aftertaste.  O - This is one of the strongest, and most balanced, beers that I've had. I highly recommend it although it will kick your ass! You must be worthy and deserving of its attention.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,StoutHunter,4.22,"I picked up a bomber of Stone's Double Bastard Ale a couple weeks ago for $7.49 at The Lager Mill. I have been meaning to try Arrogant and Double Bastard for a while but on the time that I remembered to pick one up the store only had Double Bastard, so it looks like I will be trying these ass backwards, oh well lets see how it goes. 2011 vintage. Poured from a brown 22oz bottle into a snifter.  A- The label on this beer looks good and evil, I like it, and the short story on the back is full of typical Stone shenanigans. It poured a nice dark and hazy amber color with a fingers worth of white head that died down to a thin wispy ring that stayed till the end. This was a proper looking American Strong Ale.  S- The aroma is pretty much a nice mixture of sweet caramel malts and citrus hops. The malts impart a sweet caramel and toffee aroma along with some molasses, apple cider, and dark fruit aromas. There are a lot of hops to balance out all those malts and they are pretty citrusy with pineapple and grapefruit sticking out the most, it also has a real slight booze aroma. This beer had a pretty nice aroma that I enjoyed, the citrus hops complemented the malts nicely.  T- The taste is similar to the aroma but it isn't as intense. It starts off with a large amount of malts that have a pretty high amount of sweetness and impart some nice caramel and toffee flavors with a little bit of vanilla at the end. Next comes the hops which have a high amount of bitterness in the middle and impart medium a amount of hop flavors with some grapefruit and pineapple sticking out the most with a little bit of floral notes. The finish was pretty damn bitter with a nice sweet dark fruit finish and a noticeable amount of booze with a nice malty and hoppy aftertaste. This was a nice tasting beer and when when combined with the high amount a bitterness it made for a pretty in your face kind of beer.  M- Slightly smooth, creamy, a little sticky, on the medium side of being full bodied and it had a good amount of medium carbonation but it was a little fizzy. Good mouthfeel but a little fizzy.  Overall I thought that this was a pretty damn good beer and one potent American Strong Ale. It had a big malty base with more then enough very bitter hops to balance out all those malts, the high amount of bitterness balances out the high amount of sweetness. This isn't the most drinkable beer because of how big and intense it is, but if I wasn't splitting this beer with my brother I think I could take out the whole bottle and it wasn't that boozy for being 10.50%. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it was intense and aromatic while still being well balanced, the flavor was also pretty good. What I liked least about this beer was the fizzy carbonation. it wasn't that bad, but it was the only flaw I found in this beer, I also wish it had a little better head and retention. I would buy this beer again when looking to mix things up with a big and intense beer, it was also pretty affordable. I would recommend giving this beer a try, if you love being hit over the head with tons of malts and hops then this is the beer for you. I was pretty impressed with this beer and like all the other beers I have tried from Stone this one was also pretty solid and not tame at all, I like Stone's intensity. Now I really need to try Arrogant Bastard, I am sure that a toned down version of this beer will still be pretty intense and good. This is one solid beer and a great choice when I feel like ripping my tastes buds a new one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Appearance - Poured about 2 fingers of cream yellow colored head, color of the beer is a brilliand orange-red amber, almost completely transparent, with just the slightest haze.  Smell - Sweet pineapple, candied grapefruit, vanilla carmels. Some lite sweet floral hops  Taste - Starts with a wonderful balance of sweet citrus fruits and pineapple, honey and carmel, which quickly adds grapefruit rind, floral and herbal hops - literally picking up some lush green grass, parsley and basil flavors. Finishes with an almost puckering grapefruit zest and pine, wonderful!  Mouthfeel - Medium to full body, nearly mouthcoating, then medium carb cleans the palate just enough to enable the grassy, herbal and bitter hop characteristics to finish.  Overall - I love this beer! So many great things happening here, alcohol is completely hidden in the flavor, but can be felt on the breath between sips about halfway through the bomber.

Frothy orangish foam almost reaches up two fingers from the murky orange-gold liquid, and clings to the sides of the glass like spiderman.  Candied orange peel aromas followed by alcohol spirits and pineapple-y hop notes.  Massive orange, ginger, pine resin and alcohol come forward in an assault on the palate. Finish is brutally bitter in the best way.  Sticky without seeming sweet; an excellent balance played out between bracing hops and caramelized malts. This beer is malty as a bastard. Times 2.

147,1056,AlCaponeJunior,4.42,"Poured a bizarre looking reddish brown, cloudy, good, lasting head and nice lacing.  Smells heavily malty, with pungent hops, sweet citrus. Alcohol presence, as well as a slightly fruity, bitter aroma.  Taste is an explosion! So powerfully hoppy, yet nearly overpoweringly malty all at the same time. Nice and fruity, mid-sweet pineapple, grapefruit, pear seem to squeeze through. A touch of piney citrus rounds out the bitter, smoky wood flavors.  Feel is exceptional. Very rich, thick, and full-bodied. Alcohol warming is very noticeable.  Drink is typically Stone. That's always a good thing.  Re-reviewing the '11 batch.

S: There is so much going on with the nose. You get a very good amount of sweet malt and wet hops. The beer almost smells like a pineapple.  T: Oh boy this is a strong beer. There is so much malt and hops that it is almost overpowering.  M: This is so smooth for such a strong ale. It just goes down without hardly any burn at all. It also feels like my mouth is coated with hop oil.  O: This is a great beer. I think that this beer would be better with age.

Moderate hop linger of citrus and pine. Light fuzzy mouthcoating with a slick feel.  Incredibly hoppy for a big beer but what do you expect for an Arrogant Bastard x2? Strong alcohol taste but unmistakable Stone blast of flavor. It’s good to see they haven’t tried to even it out like their Barleywine.  ’10: More caramel sweet aroma and more alcohol.

Good flavors, with a huge thick malty barley-wine type maltiness and a very nice citrus hop bitter afternoon; nicely balanced with a bit of roastiness.

The nose has lots of caramel, tons of sweet malts. The hops have definitely mellowed over 2 years.  There is a lot of tobacco, decaying leaves, bitter hops, caramel, and bitter chocolate on the taste as well as a lingering, strong bitterness presumably from the deterioration of the hops. This leads to a not-all-pleasing aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is thick but not too thick. The lack of carbonation kind of makes the beer feel and taste thicker than it actually is.  This is still definitely a big, aggressive beer. The hops had not died down as much as I would have liked them to but the tobacco and caramel notes the beer has developed are really enjoyable. The 2009 bottles could sit another 3-4 years in my opinion and at that time I'd imagine this beer would be other-worldly.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

OVERALL: Oh, don't get me wrong. This beer is good, but it's nothing new and it's nothing that keeps me interested in discovering more about the flavor. It's like a heavy scotch.

147,1056,jegross2,4.25,"Reviewing the Double Bastard from Stone Brewing Company. Score: 92  2011 bomber bottle served in a Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours a dark red-mahogany, translucent-opaque color with two and a half fingers of monstrous khaki-colored head that settles into a thin, frothy layer. Absolutely amazing lacing; this beer sticks to the side of the glass like glue. 4/5  Smell: Caramel, brown sugar and vanilla extract. Figs, raisins and creamy chocolate, some dark cherry. A little molasses. Smells like a complex stout with notes of booziness. 4.5/5  Taste: The complex flavors in this beer are extremely balanced. The front is loaded with piney hop bitterness and some light citrus, while the mid-palate is malty-sweet. Grapefruit upfront, a little apricot and peach too. Detecting caramel malts, figs and a hint of bitter dark chocolate on the mid-palate as the beer layers. Hard to discern specific flavors because of the sheer balance of the brew. Finish is acidic, bitter, and lingering. Finish is also a little spicy and a touch boozy. 4.5/5  Mouthfeel: Medium, maybe medium-light, bodied with very little carbonation. Creamy and dry. Finishes bitter and acidic. 4/5  Overall: An absolutely brilliant strong ale.  Recommendation: Despite the balance, the flavors of the beer are likely a little too intense for casual beer drinkers (who should heed the beer label's warning). Beer geeks, on the other hand, absolutely need to seek this complex brew out.  Pairings: Spicy mexican food or a sharp cheese.

Strong yet surprisingly smooth, it keeps you entertained between its exquisite taste and all the time put into the bottle.

I let the bottle sit for about 10 minutes before drinking.  Pours a reddish mahogany. A finger of dingy cream colored head. Slowly recedes to the thinnest of layers of head. I expected some real thick sticky lacing, but it's actually pretty light lacing.  Smell: citrus and pine. Some wood notes (oak perhaps) and a fairly obvious amount of alcohol. Warms the nose with each inhale.  Taste: lots of going on here. Some noticeable sweetness up front: caramel, raisins, maybe even a little chocolate. Big hops bill...earthy and piney at first with a touch of citrus at the close. All the flavors work really well together to create a very complex.  Mouthfeel: Despite booze warmth in the nose, the alcohol is well veiled elsewhere. The carbonation is almost non-existent in the body. Drinks like an after dinner cordial.

147,1056,psuKinger,3.25,"2011 Release, 22 ounce bomber. I've had my Double Bastard glasses for almost 6 months now. This is the first time I've had a chance to pour Double Bastard into one of them. Kinda cool, in a very beer-geeky way.  A: Pours a hazy murky brown color with a thin white head that dissipated quickly.  S: A lot more caramel malt and bisquit sweetness than I remember... Hops seem, dare I say, lacking? How old is this? I thought DB's release was fairly recent... [edit: the website says the release date was Oct 17, making this beer about 1.5 months old)  T: Well, there's certainly more hops on the palatte than in the nose. But a lack of grapefruit/citrus here. Very earthy/piney, and the malt backbone is BIG. Alcohol is not hidden, either.  The first thing I notice is pinecone, which I find unusual because that's usually near the end of the flavor, from my experiences. THe malt backbone then walks in and really takes over. This beer finishes with a strong twinge of alcohol and some hop-bitterness on the finish. The caramel malt is the most dominant of the flavors.  M: Hefty and frothy, this beer ""creams up"" in the mouth in a way I usually expect a good belgian to. Odd, but not displeasing. Alcohol-burn is certainly present. Carbonation seems low.  D/O: Stone is my favorite brewery, but I gotta be honest: this was kinda disappointing. Too much malt, too sweet and too boozy...

Smell is great, but this is too boozy for me. Lots of hops, which I love. The taste is just dominated by alcohol for me. I have had this year's batch on tap before and didn't get it nearly as much. I could barely finish it because the back was pure alcohol. The only reason I gave it the score I did was because I had previously enjoyed it when I was paying less attention (but wouldn't have missed this level of alcohol). I was extremely disappointed, and I'm curious as to why it was so much more boozy than the glass I had on tap. I have one more bomber that I'm going to age for a year or so to see what happens.

This beer has a huge attitude and makes you feel like a complete badass while drinking it.  2011 release bottle poured into chalice. Drank at about 48 degrees F.  A: Pours a deep, clear mahogany with a somewhat quickly dissipating off-white head.  S: Smells heavily of pine, grapefruit, toffee, some wood character, and alcohol.  T: Just a miasma of different flavors going on here. There is a strong hop influence, obviously, that assaults the tastebuds with grapefruit and pine. There are very heavy malt flavors that produce a caramel and toffee-like taste. There's a bit of pineapple-nut bread going on, as well. Alcohol can also be tasted, but not too bad for nearly 11%.  Leaves a long, lingering, bitter aftertaste. Lots of complexity going on here.  M: Thick, cake-like, and velvety smooth. This is a meal of a drink, here.  O: This is one of the best beers ever brewed, in my opinion. There's just so much complexity and flavors that are going on, but they all meld together PERFECTLY. I don't know how Stone managed to make a beer that is this aggressive and complex, yet still make it balanced.  It's truly one of the greats. If you've never tried it, you really, really need to pick it up. It's readily available this time of year.

It's so easy and addictive to drink, but the 10.5% ABV can easily catch up to you. I was half-way through a bomber and could feel the warmth growing in my cheeks.

147,1056,Brenden,4.7,"Notes from the Stone event at The Attic last night. Double Bastard 2011 fresh on tap = epic.  The color seems to be (as I made comparison in my notes on V.E. 11.11.11.) an amper-up version of that beer, a similar color but more red-amber than amber-red with a bit more depth. A sticky tan-brown head over a finger tall just hangs out in my glass the whole time, remaining in patches and trailing legs as it drops. While just a little less than I can draw from the flavor, there's plenty of complexity in this beauty. Caramel, citrus rind, toffee, some liquer, dark fruits, and wood (and this isn't -bal aged) mingle with citric, pine and floral hops in harmony and in such a way that they complement rather than clash. A bit more gentle sipciness pulls through in the flavor with something like brandy or an excellent bourbon sitting under a dual foundation of hops and malts. I don't know that an American Strong ale can get much tastier or more complex, as all the elements in the aroma mingle, yet each and every one is discernable. This is a beauty and an absolute pleasure to drink. Anyone who loves scotch or the like and wants or needs something intense and , like a good book or a good woman, beautiful, incredibly and fascinatingly deep and complicated yet relatable must drink this beer. Must. The mouthfeel is rich, lush, deep, and nearly as complex as the flavor. There are practically layers to this beer.

Then in the finish, there's a sharper bit of spicy, boozy, hotness. That's kind of nice. It's pretty tightly carbonated. Very thick, though. Like a carbonated milkshake.

Appearance: a almost clear reddish amber brown in color with a off white head that rises to a fingers thick in the pour and fades to a film as I drink it with small spots of lacing.  Smells: a mild sweet malt with a backbone of hops.  Tastes: a flavorful American strong ale that has a unique bitter hop note that I taste in the regular arrogant bastard, but this way more apparent in the double. I enjoy the sweet malt balance that is laid back compared to the pungent bitter hops.  Mouthfeel: for ten and a half percent this a ale with a little sting, but it is quite carbonated and a wonderful linger from the aftertaste.  Overall: I always enjoyed the regular Arrogant Bastard, but over the last few years I have taken a big liking to this brother brew which I scoop up as much as possible when its in season.

I am struck by bready, very sweet malt first. However, there is a serious hop backbone led by tons of citrus. Fruit esters and alcohol are noticeable at the end.  The sweetness of the malt really play a dominant role in the beginning. Caramel and brown sugar are present. However, there is also a bitterness that lingers from the hops, and is in the forefront of the aftertaste. Citrus and fruit are both a bit muted compared to the nose.  Body is on the lighter side of medium, and carbonation is a tad light also.  Overall, I think this is a good beer, if you want to have your palate attacked. It is very sharp, and definitely not for beginners.

Very sweet smell. Some citrus hops.  T- Again with the fruits but more on the citrus hop spectrum. Bready malts. Finish lingers a bit with more hop bitterness. Makes my mouth water a bit. 10.5% is masked well by the massive amount of hops.  M- Medium carbonation, pretty well-built body. Alcohol hidden well.  O- This is quite a demanding beer, with flavors coming from all over the hop and malt ends.

147,1056,jtierney89,3.65,"Pours a deep amber with a nice sticky vanilla head. Smells of tropical fruits and rum raisin. Sweet sugary malts up front with a dry midrange and finish with earthy and piney hops. Slight warming sensation upon swallowing.  This is definitely a bigger version of arrogant bastard, just not sure if I like it better or just the same. Both hide their alcohol rather well but the regular bastard seems a bit smoother which is expected I guess at a lower alcohol.  There's also a layer of rum raisin flavor on the front end of the beer as the beer warms. Starting to get some lingering aftertastes as well as the beer warms which im usually not a fan of. On the plus side all these flavors are layered pretty well though.  Alas though, this beer has flavors that build, a cloying raisin sweetness up front, and a building earthy bitterness on the back end. Flavors which are nice at first start to get old.  I would love ordering a snifter of this beer, but don't think id ever wanna do a bomber of it again.  --- re-review, 1 year and 500 beers later  Big and bold is the best way to describe this beer. Dark sweet sugared fruits, burnt strawberry jam, rum raisin, caramel and toffee all blend together in the monstrous malty body. American hops balance with a roaring bitterness on the back end of the tongue; grapefruit and lemon peel with a touch of alcohol heat. This beer attacks the tongue and creates a civil war amongst the taste buds. Sweetness tries to override the bitterness but fails. Double bastard pits the two ends of your tongue against eachother with clashing yet complimentary flavors leaving hop resin and malt residue between your gums and teeth. With each sip the beer becomes milder and milder until your tongue becomes accustomed to the fact that this beer is a bastard and bitterness has won.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,BeardedRiker,4,"Pretty much everyone likes the regular Arrogant Bastard. I am no exception. When I saw the Double Bastard, I thought a bit and then decided that I was bastard enough to acquire it. Besides, I was going to watch the Cowboys play and with their inconsistency a high ABV is sometimes a good get.  The Double Bastard formed a great frothy, off-white head that had very good retention. I stuck my nose in too quickly and got bubbly goodness all over. The beer has a nice reddish copper color.  Holy pineapples, Batman! That's what Double Bastard smelled strongest to me. Very strong fruity aromas hit my nose. Pineapple, apricot, mango. It had a very sweet smell too, like brown sugar. The fruit and brown sugar add to make it one of the sweeter beers I've smelled. Pine resin, a slight booziness, and moderate hop florescence balance it out a bit. You can smell this from across the room.  The taste, like the smell, is very fruity, with pineapple and apricot flavors being strong. The malts are sugary sweet and pine resin adds more sweetness and some bite. Again, this is a very sweet beer and fortunately, and as is expected with Stone beers, the aggressive hops balance the beer with spice and bitterness. The flavors are great, very strong, but it's a bit too sweet for my liking. Double Bastard is 10.5% ABV but I couldn't detect much booziness drinking it, although I could feel the alcohol heat and you definitely feel the beer's effects on the brain!  The carbonation is medium with a medium body. A good smoothness and sweet stickiness keep this a drinkable beer despite the strong flavors and high ABV.  The Double Bastard is a good flavorful beer but I definitely prefer Arrogant Bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Lockedin,4.68,"**I grabbed this at my local after a good Thanksgiving weekend surfing - a gallon or two of salt water has affected MY ability to sense aroma; the ale is still epic!  A: A fairly aggressive pour yields 3 fingers of rocky yellowish head over a somewhat chill hazed mahogany brew. A nice cap remains throughout the session and some nice lacing to follow. IMHO near perfection!  S: My big disclaimer - I spent most of my Thanksgiving weekend surfing decent waves and having gallons of saltwater jammed thru my sinuses - 'bout all I can smell right now is low tide - but what I do get is BIG brown sugar, malt and a shade of piney, leafy hops. Experience reminds me that the hops are a bit stronger than my sniffer is currently capable of.  T: Carmelized brown sugar hits first, followed immediately by sweet malt, finished and well balanced with a nice big piney / citrus / pineapple hop hit (hops are much larger in taste than aroma, but that could be due to above). At the finish, the brown sugar tries desperately to stick to the tongue, but bitter pine wins the day. My palate surrenders.  M: Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for such a big brew, in the best way. I'd say it's medium/light. Not as slick and oily as a Barleywine, but not dry by any stretch. Considering the depth and power of this brew, it's amazingly drinkable.  O: This is one of my favorite ales. A perfect way to cap a long weekend. Again considering balance and setting (Finishing a SoCal Thanksgiving weekend 2011), Double Bastard sets a high standard!  Oh - BA notes this beer at 11.2 - my 2011 bottle reads 10.5",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,DrewV,4.3,"NOTE: BA lists this at 11.2%, but my bottle says 10.5%.  A: A ruddy amber-red liquid with a 1-finger off-white head.  S: Heavy malts and earthy hops with a strong booze backbone. There's no messing around with this brew, the aroma alone gives you a pretty good warning shot.  T: Thick, syrupy malts and hops simultaneously attack the palate, supported by a big blast of estery alcohol. This is no beginner's beer. Well-balanced and thick. Leaves practically no aftertaste.  M: Thick, oily, syrupy, with medium carbonation.  O: A no-holds-barred brew with a significant alcohol bite and loads of malts and hops. Stone has done it again with another Arrogant winner. The strength of the alcohol is somehow more potent than the 10% would indicate; It kicked my ass after only 1/2 glass. I regularly imbibe 10%+ ABV stouts and Belgians, but Double Bastard really puts them to shame. A solid ""A"" brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The nose is big-- hops, malt, pine, cherry, orange, with a suggestion of grass or earthiness. You get absolutely NO alcohol whatsoever! NONE! At 10.5ABV, thats remarkable.  Mouth: Silky sour fruit and booze explode in your mouth. Caramel, wine, and some sweetness stuck in the middle somewhere. reminds me a lot of a Barleywine. Despite its power, its very well-balanced.

147,1056,jayhawk73,4.38,"2011 Release  Double Bastard pours a dark amber color w/ a one finger cocoa head. Nice lacing on the side of my snifter glass. You can still see through to the other side of the glass, in spite of this being a big beer. The nose is nice- big time hops, malt, cherry, orange, with a hint of grass. I don't smell any of the 10.5% alcohol, in spite of this being a new bottle. The taste, thankfully, is a notch up from the nose. Hops, malt, caramel, fruit, grass, and alcohol explode in your mouth- in a good way. This is a big beer in every sense of the word. Feel is is silky and malty, with a definite hop presence as well. Very full bodied, with a hint of dryness on the aftertaste. It's not too dry though, which would take away from this brew. Overall, this is a really great beer- for the style, or for any style. It would be interesting to age a bottle of this.. Maybe if I can leave one in my fridge long enough, I'll find out what that's like.

147,1056,EricCioe,3.75,"This pours medium amber with a small head rising and falling quickly. On the nose there is a long note of acetone and booze riding roughshod over caramel malts and pine. I have no problem with big booze notes in big beers, but to me this seems less than well-integrated into the rest of the brew. In the mouth, the heat melds a bit better into the big caramel and sugary sweetness and the piney hops, which make a bigger statement in the mouth than on the nose. The body is medium full, sticky, well-carbonated, and there is a nice long finish of bitterness and heat as the caramel dies away first.  Overall, I didn't like this as much as I expected. Perhaps some time would allow the heat to integrate a bit better rather than riding over everything else.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,morimech,3.93,"2011 Release Pours a dark amberish copper that looks murky at first but is actually clear because of the dark color. One finger of head forms and slowly settles to half its height. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left down the glass.  Smells like an English Barleywine. Just a deep, sweet caramel malt aroma.  Taste takes a big step away from the aroma. Nice citrus, earthy, and pine hops takes hold of the palate. How were the hops completely missed in the aroma? Those hops balances the sweet caramel malt. There is a large dose of sweetness that comes in mid-palate. A little alcohol flavor in the finish. It is warming.  Full bodied with a gentle carbonation. I think the carbonation would hold up over time.  Pretty good beer fresh. Not sure why the aging is advised.

The nose is very sweet and malt with bread-like notes. Some tobacco and leather is also noticeable, as well as a touch of heat.  The taste is beastly and has notes of caramel, butterscotch, and some sweet malty goodness. The abv is brought down significantly from the year of age. There is a bread-like taste in the finish.

147,1056,haazer,3.5,"Picked up at Abe's today.  A- Pretty reddish/orange ale fills the glass with substantial bubbles and carbonation. Massive effervescent head, off-white in color. Settles down to a nice cap, bit of lacing left on the sides.  S- A mixture of bready and caramel malts initially in the nose. Sweet sugars and candy yeast. An underlying piney hop bitterness rounds out the nose. Aromas are subtle.  T- Caramel malts upfront, and leads into sweet candy sugar. Brew is balanced by some earthy bittering hops, which actually keeps this beer from being cloying. Flavor ends with some bready rye taste.  M- Medium to full bodied brew with moderate carbonation. Fairly smooth drinking, slight heat from booze but not in a bad way.  O- Though I enjoyed the brew I was expecting a little more. I'd like to see some more pronounced flavors, everything was fairly mild.

T - The citrus and pine aroma from the nose is not very easily detected, but the big hop bitterness is definitely present. The malt backbone is a good balance for the bitterness, adding caramel and toffee notes to the flavour profile. The finish is bitter and somewhat dry and lingers for quite some time.

147,1056,CaptDavyJones,4.25,"Poured a hazy reddish brown color from a 22 oz bomber (2011 release) with ABV clearly marked on the bottle. One finger off white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Good carbonation with a nice steady stream of small bubbles surfacing in the snifter. Aroma is a very nice blend of fruity esters, citrus (grapefruit), apricot, piney hops, pungent tobacco like notes and a lot of malty bread like notes. Resiny, oily, piney, hop blast upfront with the bitterness mellowing in the middle to release some fruity, sweet malt notes that are laid to rest for their efforts by the monstrous hop presence. The finish is on the drier side with the bitterness not lingering for a long time. Actually there is a hint of sweetness that lingers after the finish. This is an all-out assault on the sensibilities of the taste buds. Lives up to it's name, this IS an 'in your face' ale. Has a chewy, oily mouthfeel. Definitely a sipper, and a very nice warmer. The alcohol warmth doesn't creep up instantly, but slowly and surely it starts to warm the insides. All in all, this is another aggressive ales from Stone. Definitely worth a try, and comes highly recommended.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

A: great start as you reveal a ruby brown ale with a 2-3-finger thick tan head of foam. Settles, leaving lacings along the glass.  S: This beer has a great smell before it hits your tongue: spices and malt taunt and tone your tastebuds for what is to come...  T: hops, caramel; reminded me of Founder's Devil Dancer, but a little darker and more heavier. Perfect balance between sweet malts and bitter hops - pops on the palate. Notes of celery and earth, savory flavors perfectly melded with sweetness.  M: carbonation and hops clear any syrupiness from the mouth moments after a sip, and creating a strong pull for more. It starts heavier than it finishes, created a very well-rounded, well-balanced beer.  O: completely impressed. I love Devil Dancer and this beer is right there - maybe even better. Hits every note perfectly: delicious, smells great, strong, great pour up front, great aftertaste, and a real addictive quality. I am willing to understand that people have different palate preferences, or whatever, but if you appreciate beer, you must, at least, try this beer.

A: Pours a two finger head of nice cream, good thickness, and great retention for the high ABV. Colour is a dark caramel brown. Semitransparent. Appealing.  Sm: Grapefruit is dominant, with some candied sugar, yeast, and other vague citrus esters. Aroma is mild in strength. It's alright, but it doesn't really jump out and grab me.  T: Pleasant grapefruit is the first thing I notice. The caramel and HEAVY candy sugar, however, are not so pleasant. They do help cover the alcohol - which I don't notice, but it's too sweet overall. I feel like my teeth are rotting with every sip. It's anything but balanced; it needs to tame the candy sugar considerably. It's built alright, but it's far from a good beer.  Mf: Tingly and overly soft from the candy sugar abundance. It's abnormally, artificially soft and it really bothers me. Also, it's too thick.  Dr: They seemed to build the beer around hiding the ABV, and in that respect it succeeds. But the insane amount of candied sugar hides the best aspects of the beer: the citrusy notes and yeast. It may be worth a try for hardcore fans of Belgian beers that rely on candied sugar, but I think most middle of the road beer drinkers will be as turned off as I was.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Look: Muddy brown with a deep red hue when swirling the glass. Head was a dense tan foam with excellent retention given the high ABV.  Smell: A candy sugar with some heavy sweet malts and a super ripe grapefruit note. Extremely pungent, almost like a barley wine.  Taste: First on the palate was a sweet dark cherry with heavy sugars that quickly tuned into an extreme hop bitterness in the middle. Then ripe grapefruit hit for a split second, followed by an intense dry and lingering bitter finish. No real alcohol heat, but that's not enough to save this one in my eyes.  Honestly? This beer was certainly not what I was expecting. I felt the overall character was reminiscent of a typical barley wine with some added bitterness and grapefruit. I can see where the middle was basically an Arrogant Bastard x2. The beginning and the end completely threw me off. The extreme sweetness and the high level of bitterness did not add up to anything special to me. Very disappointing – especially with a $10.00 price tag.

Hints of caramel in the flavor, some roastiness, sweetness, malt backbone. Hop bitterness is balanced out by the malts very well, with only a tiny bit of bitterness in the finish.

It looks quite carbonated with tiny bubbles gushing to the top. The creamy head sticks around.  Floral, pine and caramel intertwine with each other with a candy sugar-ness at the end.  Caramel, pine, citrus, grapes, candy corn, toffee-like flavor that comes in with raisins. The sweetness and bitterness battle it out with the bitterness lingering with the aftertaste -- the slightly metallic hops win out. The alcohol is almost completely masked by the complex flavors.  It wasn't the taste that I noticed first, it was the mouth feel of the body. Medium to full body creaminess that engulfed the mouth perfectly. Light Carbonation, just a hint of alcohol warmth going down. It leaves the lips sticky and the mouth feeling dry from the metallic hops.  What a dangerous beer, very easy to drink with the abv. up there. My favorite part about this brew is the mouth feel; it just completely fills the mouth up with its full body.

147,1056,AndyAvalanche,4.69,"Full review 7/2014  2008 version of a 22 oz. bomber (yupp I said 08) poured into a Duvel Tulip style glass. Comes out Charles River muddy water brown, murky and hazy. The head is sort of a dark tan/towards orange creamcilce color. Decent, but not a ton of lacing to it.  Smell is really good. I've had this fresh and aged (first time this old though). The hops are still very very present, but mellowed out a bit. Some pine and sweet candied grapefruit, and some other citrus I suppose. Seems hoppy as it's cold, but as it warms up it smells a little malty; caramel, molasses, toffee, and sticky brown sugar.  Taste is on par with the smell. The sticky toffee and caramel stick out immediately; slightly nutty too. Hints of molasses, brown bus cuts and honey. Hoppiness present, but more pine than citrus here. Meshes really well together, really tasty.  Mouthfeel is really good. Warming alcohol detectable, as most immediately; pretty good carbonation, especially how well it's hold up over time. Nice brown sugar sweetness, bitterness from probably the hops and the alcohol. Gotta say it has a gradual wet bitter finish and a lingering warm sensation from the alcohol. Might be a little more drinkable now than when fresh, but super drinkable when fresh too. All around good beer, I love this brewery, they do an awesome job.

Sweet caramel and hops. Whereas normally the malts would be cloying, this beer manages to circumvent that by suddenly hitting you with a fistful of hops before the sweetness becomes overwhelming.

Taste is even more impressive. Again with the extreme complexity. Dark fruits, bready and sweet malts, slight citrus and then finishes with a huge pine kick.

147,1056,bobhits,4.53,"Pours a mid dark red hinting on some orange and yellow touches. Bubbles hang to the double bastard glass with a tall nice half finger head (poured into a double bastard glass which doesn't hold much so this is GOOD amounts of head). Not any lacing other than the white fuzz hanging to the sides of the glass. There are some big alcohol legs here and well given the bastardliness of this one (10.5%) the lack of head retention is almost a given.  There is a nice citrus grapefruit opening where the hops really shine through. The back is the sweet caramel and sugary fruit malt back. Not a huge nose and alcohol comes through some, but I like what's here. This isn't ""double"" the bastard if you will.  First impression, the hops do not lead the flavor which is odd. The first taste is intense sweetness from caramel, toffee, and fruits. This wonderful sweetness is followed by a bite from the hops and then it goes back to sweetness before finishing with intense bitter and citrus hops. The alcohol has the final say here...this one is hot just accept it with the name! I've always felt like double bastard didn't feel ""double"" but I think my issue is really more with the malt here is stronger than the hops. This years beer is imo more balanced towards the malt than in the past, but fresh I normally just have it on tap. Anyway, the beer is malt forward with an insane amount of hops that still just barely are able to take over for a brief time. There's a good bit of spice and heat here to really clean up the sweetness.  A beer this big is hard to really qualify on mouth feel. It is HOT. It is BIG. It isn't well carbonated. It is what you'd expect for the ""style"" and the brewer though.  There are a lot of reasons to dislike this beer. It is too bitter, too hot, too sweet, and I say you're just not worthy! Yes, as a beer critic this beer has some very real flaws. It could be better, but damn it, I love the bastardly ways of Stone. This beer is for this beer lover a complete joy from start to finish. This isn't for the beer drinker who wants balance, subtly, drink ability, or anything like those. This was made for the guys who want a beer to beat them over the head, have more flavors than they can dream of, and that can do it for a VERY reasonable price!  So I just bought a 2011 bottle of this, it's now 2017.  I wanted to make a few notes, this is a 6 year old beer at over 10%, and it has the carbonation of a new beer. The hops are still well on display. The age has perhaps added a bit of a muted aged malt flavor (hard to explain it, but ""wet dog"" or ""wet hair"" is kinda the way I think of it, but in far more desirable way. Horrible example. Anyway the malt and hops here work really well. I can still tell I'm drinking a high alcohol beer. It's really amazing how little the beer has changed with 6 years of age. A part of me is upset that I can't give more notes of change, but another part of me is amazing at how well a 6 year old beer has held up. There are a LOT of floaters in here for you visual people....I like them but I could see complaints. It's pushing into the quad world in terms of floaters.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,FightingEntropy,4.94,"Hazy dark brown ale with copper highlights in the thinner parts of the glass. Thin tan head falls quickly to a thin fillm. Hot, whiskey like nose that clears the sinuses. Malt, dark fruit, burnt cherry pie, caramel blend for a complex and extremely assertive nose. Predominate hop bite in the taste--blistering bitterness with resin. Oily mouthfeel with strong malt, chocolate, raisins, and figs. Love this beer. I can see where some might not like the overly assertive qualities of the beer, but I cherish them. Move up on my all time favorite list and need to acquire some more.

N: Pretty much smells of Tootsie Roll and toffee with some faint leafy hops still lingering. Also seems to be some brown sugar and molasses.  T: Brown sugar, toffee, molasses and fruity esters upfront followed by some piney hops which is sort of surprising. Again a wave of fruity esters with some possible citrus comes through. Finish tastes like a Tootsie Roll with some pine and leafy hops thrown in.  M: Full bodied, chewy, sticky and dry. Light-medium bitterness is still there.  O: Fresh this is a boozy mess, but put a year on it and it loses it's edge. I don't think I care for Double Bastard one way or another.

It's a gorgeous deep ruby color that browns out when held to light. Very pretty beer.  The nose is intense and complex; fruity and boozy mainly, with some toffee and caramel in there as well.  Dense flavor profile. With layers of cherry, raisin, toffee, molasses, and alcohol. They are so well balanced within themselves. There is an absurd amount of flavor, but somehow it is still a ""balanced"" beer.  Mouthfeel isn't all that heavy, and is surprisingly smooth. Subtle, but present carbonation. Not syrupy like other American Stronger Ales, yet still a sipper.  Overall this is a good beer, and another solid offering from Stone. Not my favorite +10% ASA I've had, but definitely one of the better ones. Well balanced for how much flavor is packed in, and relatively drinkable; it just didn't scream to me as a truly ""exceptional"" beer. Recommended to any BA, but it is not for the uninitiated.

147,1056,Heavenisbeer,4.7,"McEwan’s pint glass. 2010 release.  A: What a beauty to behold. As it exits the bottle the Double is a hazy, neon ochre, then settling to reveal a murky, dense, swampy, dark cider red. A little head off the pour—and I poured strongly—that dies very quickly leaving a sparse frothy film. Some slick intermittent lacing throughout, with excellent retention.  S: Wow, wow. Just rich and animated—I had to take my beanie off cos I felt like I needed to listen. Some hops, some light fruits, oranges, grapefruit, but not much. Bready, buttery, caramel. Like a silencer on a hop pistol.  T: Spicy, cutting, ruby red grapefruit hops! Amazing. Don’t get that in the nose; what a great detour. The hops level out after the initial jolt, allowing a floral, fruity, nectar core to push through, and then…wait for it, wait for it, the HOPS come back for a wallop. It’s theatrical, a narrative brew. There’s a twist at the end, and even some banter in the credits. I’ve truly never had such complexity in one sip.  M: Warm, viscous, coating.

What a ride (and (insert inside joke wink here) it doesn't even really end here, per se). Anyway, this brew pours a dark amber-rust topped by a finger of off-tan foam. The nose comprises orange zest, grapefruit zest, caramel, pine resin, toffee, black pepper, and a touch of booze. The taste brings in more of the same, with more pine (which is more toward sap than resin here) and the addition of some mandarin orange syrup for good measure. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a richly textured and generally enjoyable brew. Definitely not for the faintest of hearts.

T: Initially its all hops-pungent pine, floral hop bitterness and intense West Coast dryness-but the malt bill cuts this down to size with a metric ton of caramel and toffee underneath...in fact the warmer this beer gets, the more the malts dominate...  MF: Decent, medium-thick mouthfeel with some sticky viscosity. Dry finish.

Overall impression is similar to a good doppelbock. After a bit, banana joins the fruit combination. Nice complexity. Each sip starts semi-sweet, mostly sweet in the middle, and then the finish wipes the sweetness out altogether.  M: Medium body and very nice, smooth oil feel.

The smell is pretty malts, lots of caramel, toffee, a decent amount of pine hops but less than expected. The feel is thick and creamy. The taste is great, reminds me of an American barely wine.

S: sharp pine and citrus notes, typical of an IPA, meets waves of sweet bready malts. The nose is big, and several subtones are noticed - tropical, peppery spice.  T: The taste follows, and the huge ABV yields huge flavors. The hoppy pine flavors are really bitter, the honey-sweet malts are really sweet...REALLY sweet. Strangely, the beer is quite drinkable - there are plenty of big beers like this that ruin your palate far more than this one. The beer finished mote sweet than bitter, but alcohol and bitter residues linger long after the swallow.  M: Full bodied, ample carbonation.

Solid backing of caramel and toffee malts in the background. There's even some hints of dark fruits. Very citrusy all around.  Taste: Just as intense as the smell leads. Citrus hops with notes of grapefruit and orange. Lots of pine resin and floral notes throughout. Light hints of dark fruit and oak in the middle. A solid base of bready caramel and toffee malts adds some balancing sweetness. A little alcohol heat but its masked well by the sharpness of the hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Very chewy and creamy. A little heat is felt but its still pretty smooth.  Overall: A very good strong ale/DIPA.

There is a noticeable tropical peach or mango as well as some citrus. Hops add a decent dose of floral and grass scents.  T: The malt and fruit scents from the smell are similarly present when I take a sip but they are balanced very nicely with more prominent hop flavors.

Some sweet fruity notes too like overripe peach or dried apricots and a little raisin. Despite some pretty assertive aromas, nothing really overpowers-- hoppy, sweet, and malty.  Taste: Upfront its very sweet and boozy and it closes out with a stiff hoppy bitterness and lasting alcohol presence. In the middle, waves of sweet, toasty, and fruity malt mixed with bitter citrus and pine . Delicious, but quite a boozy sting, and the multiple flavors are just slightly muddled.  Mouthfeel: Slick, slightly sticky, resiny. Softly carbonated-- maybe a hair too softly.  Overall: This is a great beer and a neo-classic.

The hops are there but not as dominating as the grains.  A tasty beverage to say the least, double bastard is a nice flavor bomb. It leads off with a heavy dose of malts that are thick, sweet and slightly toasted. Those flavors then subside and let a nice hop twang come through. Simple but full flavor.

Tall, sticky, yellowish-cream colored head has great retention and shows some nice lacing.  Aroma-First come the hops with notes of pine, grapefruit, citrus, orange, followed close behind by perfumy alcohols, with tropical fruit and melon notes. Slight pepperyness from the alcohol is notable as well. Underneath, rich, toffee/caramel malt forms a solid foundation for the beer. Slight dark fruit esters pervade, and just a hint of roasted malt is apparent. Quite boozy, with almost a brandy/rum character.  Flavor-Wow. This is one powerful son of a bitch. Beastly caramel malt and burnt sugar gives way to aggressive hop bitterness, with green, grassy, piney flavors. While the hop bitterness is still kicking your tongue around, spicy alcohol comes in to throw a punch or two. Aftertaste is long and lingering of warm, bitter green hop and spicy booze-once again reminiscent of brandy.  Mouthfeel-Medium full body with moderate carbonation. Relatively smooth, though the hops smack the tongue around and the alcohol is quite warming-stopping just barely short of hot.

Initially, the hops are readily apparent then the pine, citrus, and hints of caramel come through to make this one of the most balanced and delicious beers I've had.

O: A very drinkable beer with very high ABV. Don't know how they managed that. This is a dangerous one.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,gregb13,4.32,"Reviewed 5/29/15, and amended my ratings to reflect the changes between my last tasting and this one (see my previous rating below):  Pours a very deep amber, almost orange-colored highlights. Looks great.  Smell - Wow! Rich, dark bread, candied fruits, rum raisins, malty, some hops. Very inviting.  Taste - Follows the nose well. Very balanced. Not overly sweet. Very good.  Feel - Medium to heavy, a bit sticky.  Overall - A lot better than my previous tasting. Much more balanced, and quite easy-drinking for 11%. Along the lines of SN Bigfoot. Could call this a barleywine and it would fit. I'm impressed.  Buy it if you see it.    (reviewed from notes; sampled late October '11)  The thing that really sticks out about this brew is its lack of balance.  Aroma is confusing, alternating from a melange of hop + citrus bitterness to a motorcade of roasted booze. Not very pleasant, but not off-putting either.  Taste is intense, bitter and dominated by booze which burns and lingers. Disappointing.  Unbalanced, boozy and overrated and would not seek out. However, this definitely is playing to a niche market of Stone-heads, who will undoubtedly love it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,bsp77,4.58,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Pint, but then I switched to a Snifter for the second pour once I realized this is essentially a hoppy Barleywine.  Appearance: Hazy orangish-brown with moderate light tan head and some lacing.  Smell: Semi-sweet caramel and toffee backbone, with light citrus and pine. Somewhat fruity and spicy. Aroma is Barleywine-like.  Taste: Much more bitter and hoppy than the aroma indicated. Loads of pine and citrus overwhelm the malt backbone of caramel, toffee, plum and cherry. Wait a sec, that was the review when it was 45 to 50 degrees. Once it hit 55 or so, it becomes much more malt driven.  Feel: Moderately low carbonation, pretty full body with a very dry finish. Slightly creamy texture.  Overall: If I didn't know that Stone made Old Guardian (which I have not yet reviewed at this point), then I would have assumed that this was their Barleywine. Kind of reminds me of Bigfoot or Old Ruffian with some age on it (maybe like six months to one year), but better!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,biga7346,4.12,"A - Toffee color, some head, dissipates quickly, looks viscous, syrupy.  N - Brown sugar, peppercorns, bourbon whiskey, vanilla, caramelized sugar but not boozy at all; a lot of sweet flavors swirling around like creme brulee, toasted marshmallow, caramel, peat moss.  T/M - A nice punch of hop freshness up front, hop oil, a slight alcohol burn like sour mash whiskey in the finish; brown bread, rye bread, toffee, sticky syrupy aftertaste like cola; some baker's chocolate, cocoa nibs, just a real biscuit almost buttery presence. Slick, oily and boozy texture like brandy.  D - Damn good stuff for a malt forward, boozy type of brew, pretty balanced, I bet this would age nicely.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,mechamifune,3.68,"Pours a clean looking copper-orange. Slight white head that goes awat pretty quickly. Good lacing and sense of carbonation.  Smell is stringent bitter hops with a little bit of sweetness and dark fruit and a little too much alcohol in the nose for my liking.  Taste is very bitter upfront followed up with a little bit of a hoppy-grapefruit taste and then finishing with a little bit of dark fruit and alcohol. A very intense, at times abrasive taste. Alltogether interesting but i'm not sure how much it compells me to go back to it.  Moutfeel is pretty smooth, the carbonation is evident but not too much for the style.  Overall this is an interesting beer with a lot to take in. I'm just not sure it really offers something I would want to keep going back to. If you are a fan of the style in general, give it a shot.... if you aren't a fan of intense, bitter beers, perhaps you should steer clear. For me, as a one time a year offering, it works, but for beers in this range of abv, i'd much rather have a solid RIS or DIPA.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Arbitrator,4.24,"Chilled bomber into a glass. 2011 vintage.  A: Pours a murky, maroon body with half a finger of instantly-vanishing beige head. There is light filming across the top, a collar around the drink, and lacing down the glass.  S: A strong hop presence delivering notes of candied pineapple and tangerine. Pine on the back end. Maltiness is expressed as toffee and caramel. Light booze.  T: Caramel, toffee, roasted grain, earthy bitterness. Citrus flavors manifest as the aforementioned pineapple, tangerine, and orange zest. The finish is dominated by pine needles and offset by a melange of dark fruits (figs, raisins). Pine lingers into the aftertaste for a light bitterness.  M: On the full side of medium-bodied. Medium carbonation, working well for the style to give it a slick mouthfeel. A small booze bite in the finish. It's very bitter during each sip, but none of it is sticky; the aftertaste has only a mild lingering bitterness.  O: I am very thankful that they didn't screw with this one to release a Belgo-version brewed with bastards. I might even nab a second bomber this season.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

On the palate, a nice creamy mouthfeel. Malt sweetness balances an intense bitterness (beyond hops, a real grapefruit rind bitterness), with hints of grape.  A really bold American strong ale, to me a marriage of a barleywine ale and a DIPA. Double Bastard. I've been called a lot worse, for a lot less.

147,1056,thebrood1987,4.78,Strong smells of citric hop goodness mixed with some bready sweet malts and a bit of spicy alcohol. Its spicy upfront with a bit of the alcohol coming through mixing in with the bready sweet malts. The malts give off tastes of chocolate covered raisins to smoothed out bready sweetness. The hops come in most at the end with a strong citric bite following with some pine and herbal hops.  The malts and hops are so big in this beer its amazing. The malts give off so many flavors like I explained above and the hops are a bit more citrus in this one than the regular Arrogant Bastard. I had that last night and that one seems a bit more piney. Even though this one has some piney hops as well.  The hops are pretty explosive in this beer and add a very nice dryness along with the spicy alcohol. The alcohol gives a bit of a warming and although it shows a bit as it should...it still drinks very smooth and nice. I also get a hint of cherries from the hops and the alcohol. All in all this beer is a good definition of a real craft beer. Thanks Stone for another great offering.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Erish,4.89,"I poured this 22 oz. bottle into a large wine glass. This is the 2010 release.  A: murky dark amber color, the tan head died down quickly, but the Belgian-esque cap and lacing stay put for the duration.  S: the malt aromas are complex, yielding ripe fruit, burnt sugar, and caramel, with a supporting cast of over-ripe bananas, baking spices, vanilla, nuts, alcohol, and a truly mysterious aroma that can best be described as the essence of the Earth. The more this beer warms, the more olfactory gifts it yields. I have never smelled a beer quite like this before, and was continuously surprised and delighted as I imbibed the heavenly aromas.  T: the malt is at once dry and sweet, revealing astounding depth and complexity: nuts, burnt sugar, toasted caramel, and grain husk, the middle showcases plum, raisin, vanilla, a definite alcoholic bite, and a woodsy/earthy character from the growing hop presence, the finish is amazingly long, with herbal, resinous, and grassy hops providing the coda to this amazing beer.  M: full-bodied, plush velvet texture, and moderate carbonation, the finish is bitingly herbal/bitter, but not harsh.  O: This is easily one of the most interesting and ultimately delicious beers I have ever had. It is not a classically trained DIPA or RIS: this is the proverbial iron-fisted beer in the velvet glove.

This glass has proven itself, time and time again, to be the best glass I currently own for the “Bastard” series of Ales.  Pours a thick, one + finger head, it hangs there, then settles to a medium thin film, easily revived with a swirl. This ale is alive! Deep dark Amber color, beautiful, picture perfect, this is the color of Ale!  The aroma/smell, is a flowery, enticing, hit of hops. In smell seems to fall between Piney + , to Citrusy, then followed by rich malt, very enticing! Then comes the ale type yeast, a very pleasant and enjoyable aroma.  Very distinct, incredibly rich malt on the palate, then the powerful hops take over, making for a very pronounced, ale experience. Nice crispness and perfect carbonation balance it all out. The hops and malt stay neck and neck thru the entire pour. Just flat out delicious!  Long finish of bitter hops and rich malt.  This is an incredible ale. What a great experience. The 10.5% ABV is completely buried by the distinct flavor and aroma, which is so good I could easily drink myself into oblivion. I don’t know what more you could ask for in an ale, well OK, wood ageing would be perfect. Also had several drafts as its been on tap for several days now.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,agomega,3.95,"2010 bottle served in a pint glass.  Appearance: Dark caramel color with a large frothy head. Excellent lacing.  Smell: The overwhelming aroma is biscuity with some sweet caramel overtones. In addition there are hints in the background of dark fruits and even some hints of citrus.  Taste: A ton of darker roasted caramel flavors with hints of raisin and fig - surprisingly sweet. A resiny, piney hop character is present in the beer which reaches out and punches you in the face on the finish. Even though the sweetness and the bitterness are close to balanced they clash a little in the finish  Mouthfeel: A big thick mouthfeel with a lot of residual sweetness. The hop resins are very apparent and since they are decidedly piney it is almost like a small amount of tree sap was added to the beer.  Overall: A good beer that any lover of big american beers should appreciate. The only downside is the large format bottles. With the finish sweetness and the 11.2 percent alcohol content it is a very difficult bottle to finish by yourself.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Taste: Strong piney, citrus hops, large caramel malt backbone, burnt sugars, slight alcohol, bready finish with smooth caramel and slight heat.

M: Very full bodied and bitter, with a long lingering (good) aftertaste. If you don't like aggressive hops, then I would recommend cellaring this beer for a couple of years.  O: A year ago, Stone's Double Bastard Ale was my first real ""big"" beer, that being above 10% abv, and my fond memory of that first bottle now has to stand up to my far more experienced beer palate, and I'm happy to report that it's still awesome.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Traces of it lingered til the very end. Some lacing. Beer is a very dark copper. Looks about right for a beer called Double Bastard.  S - not much aroma for me. Not upfront and not throughout. I'm surprised. It's a strong ale in a wide mouthed glass - I thought there would be a big aroma. Just didn't happen for me. Weird!  T - sweet hop flavors - tastes like a grapefruit. Rind and all. Not grapefruit juice - an actual grapefruit. I love grapefruit, so this was great for me! I didnt pick up a lot of other flavors. There was a trace of copper penny, though. The pure grapefruit was pretty consistent for me thoughout the whole glass. Yum!  M - somewhat thin, somewhat astringent. Like a grapefruit, makes you pucker. This lasts with the aftertaste. Simultaneously, feels good across the tongue, with some creaminess.  O - I would try this again and happily recommend it to fans of ""bitter"" beers. If you love grapefruit then this is for you.

Bitterness throughout the entire sip, not just on the finish. A little abrasive.  M: Medium body and medium carbonation with bite. Alcohol is a little noticeable at the end.  O: Too bitter for the style. I've got to think this improves with some age, once the bitterness has mellowed out.

The aroma has lots of hops and malt character, along with a biscuity smell. The taste has some of that hop bitterness, but a nice balance with the malts. There's also a toffee/dark boozy fruits and bourbon quality to it. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with decent carbonation, especially for a beer that is 2 years old. Also of note is the smoothness and relative obscuring of the ABV content, which is high at 10.5%. I assume that some of the mellowing is because it is a vintage.

S - Sticky-sweet aromas of amber malt, caramel, and resinous grapefruit hops. While the intense hops of a fresh bottle have obviously faded, what's left is an amazing candied-orange-peel and caramel bomb that just begs to be drank. T - Yeah, right on with the nose, lots of sweet caramel and toffee malt with a candied orange peel and grapefruit hop profile. Surprisingly smooth, and lacking in noticeable alcohol ""burn"", but I suppose that's attributed to the age. M - Sticky and big, with a full mouthfeel and lowish carbonation.

Now, in September it's more drinkable. I cellard in my cold cellar 45 degrees. It is now a luscious beer with a complex nose. Alcohol, still noticeable.

147,1056,ezperkins2,4.13,Stone Double Bastard – 2007 Poured from a bomber into a tulip (09/14/11)  A: A beautiful mahogany with traces of golden orange when held to a light. A standard pour garnished a decent ¼ inch off white almost light brown head that stuck around for a short while. Decent lacing  S: I believe the age on this bottle has hurt the nose a bit. Without the hop presence there are a lot of subtle smells but nothing over powering. Malts come first followed by sweet dark fruits. I even picked up a very subtle cola like aroma.  T: If the age hurt the nose it was more than made up for once it was tasted. It definitely still has that very distinct bastard malt character but the subtle nuances of the other flavors are fantastic. The first taste mirrors the nose with a very sweet raison/fig taste but there is still a bitter finish. The citrusy piney flavors are gone but the bitterness still shows up in the finish. There is still a bit of booze but is welcome to help cut the sweetness.  M: Thick and oily with a great lingering taste. This one stays with you for a while. Once the bomber was gone I tasted it for while. Carbonation was spot on and even gave a nice pop upon opening.  O: Fresh Double Bastard is good but I feel the years have been very kind to this brew. I have a few more 07’s and 08’s left in the cellar and will treasure them. Saying this is a big beer is an understatement. Most barley wines do not have the complex power this brew packs. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys aging beer to grab a handful of double bastards and stash them away for years to come.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Has an intense earthy taste, which smooths out after a few sips. Somewhat like a barleywine, this starts with a sweet grape taste with notes of currants and apricots. This has a strong malt backbone, with a yeasty, almost biscuity taste. Astringent bitterness hits mid-tongue, before finishing with a nice hit of hops.  Medium to full-bodied, which dries out as it finishes.  Oh yeah, this is a beast of a beer that demands you respect its authoritah as you sip it down.

Not too hard to put down - all things considered, it is a pretty smooth beer - but it's no gulper.  I respect this beer more than I enjoy it, but that's not to say I don't enjoy it.

147,1056,jondeelee,4.42,"With a name like ""Double Bastard,"" and the slogan ""You're not worthy"" imprinted on the bottle cap--plus the extensive text on the back label that is essentially a several-hundred-word arrogant rant about how awesome the beer is and how you're exactly the opposite--this 2008 release had better be a damn good brew.  On the nose, it has a distinct bi-level aroma, part Jolly Rancher-type sugary fruit, and part bitter hop, creating a warning that the drinker had better pay attention to what's coming next.  On the tongue, the hops are immediately apparent, coming on strong like a high-grade IPA. However, the hops are far more balanced and nuanced than might be expected, and thankfully aren't strong enough to knock out the rest of the flavors. Those come in after the initial hop shock has worn off slightly, revealing a wonderfully fruity, brown sugar underbelly that's just dying to be hauled up to lover's lane like a prom date, and do something naughty in your back seat. Flavors here include fruit esters, toffees and caramels, as well as a touch of dark chocolate, and perhaps a smidgen of tobacco.  Combine those flavors in a perfect balance with the hops, and you get one great ale--that is, if you're a hops fan, such as I am. But as one reviewer has already noted, if you're not a fan of hops, you won't like this one at all. 4.5 stars, you bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,PDXHops,4.7,"2008 vintage bomber, poured into a Duvel tulip. Mahogany isn’t quite the right word for the shade of the body, as there seems to be some dark orange in the mix as well. A huge light tan head is raised initially. This slowly settles into an uneven layer of rocky foam with peaks and valleys. Excellent retention, plentiful lacing.  When fresh, Double Bastard screams Citrus! Caramel! Booze! It’s raw, aggressive and I love it. With a few years of age, it turns into almost a different beer entirely. The nose has smoothed out considerably. While you wouldn’t call it gentle, it’s certainly a complex blend of with honey, toffee and baked bread providing the heftier malt aromas. Hints of milk chocolate, vanilla, orange, baked apple and sherry bring the complexity. The massive bitterness is long gone, but exceedingly juicy sweet citrus- orange, tangerine, touch of pineapple- remains. Brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, chocolate. Hints of sherry and brandy. Stray notes of tobacco and cedar(?). So much going on here. A viscous, almost slippery and oily brew, but there’s enough carbonation to keep things moving along nicely. Exceedingly warm lingering finish.  Overall impression: Incredible sipper. I’m a huge fan of Double Bastard fresh, but your patience will certainly be rewarded if you care to age it for a while.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,KickInTheChalice,4.35,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass. 2010 vintage.  Appearance: Double Bastard is an impressive looking beer. A deep brown color with a cherry amber tint, this has a very full foamy white head that retains well and leaves a lot of lace. Eventually it dies down, which does not surprise me given the strength of the beer.  Smell: Lots of sugary sweetness, bown sugar, toffee, caramel. Tons of grapefruit hops in here as well.  Taste: Brown sugar and toffee smooth sweetness up front, bringing an intensity unlike I would expect to see from anything but Double Bastard. The sweetness gradually turns into an ever-rising bitterness. Grapefruit flavors dominate a huge hop bill. There is a bit of an alcohol bite from the middle of the sip on.  Mouthfeel: This truly is 'one lacerative mother of an ale.' Almost immediately, the tingle from the alcohol and hop bite causes my tongue to tingle. The alcohol leaves a slight burn in the throat and warms the stomach. The body is quite full, with carbonation that is creamy but still provides a bit of crisp character.  Overall: The only thing that really gets in the way of my pure enjoyment of this is the strong alcohol bite. A very good beer, one that I will savor and enjoy slowly.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Dissipates fairly nicely for such a high ABV beer.  Smell-Citrus hops at first then becomes a nice malty caramel aroma. Some spice notes and some booze on the finish. Very balanced, really works together.  Taste-Complex, but simple. The flavors are so pronounced and really smacks you across the face. Huge caramel malts and some dark fruits at first that transforms into a bittery citrus aroma with some spice. Alcohol is there, but very underwhelming.  Mouthfeel-Full bodied, medium carbonation.

Semi-opaque, pouring out of the bottle it looks thick. Produces a thin layer of tan head that quickly shrinks to a thin film. The bottle is also the most abusive one I've yet seen from Stone Brewing, and possibly the only one I've ever seen that has the words ""masturbatory"" and ""line 'em up against the wall"" printed on it.  S- Fruit, sweet malts and then alcohol, lots and lots of powerful, rum-like, semi-sweet alcohol.  T- There's just so much going on with the flavor on this beer. It's very sweet, with lots of sweet and warming alcohol, spice, giant fruits, and caramel, but the hop flavors (pine, citrus, hop oil) and malts are also huge and help keep everything balanced.  M- Medium to full bodied, thick, palate-coating feel that is kept in check with great carbonation.  O- An incredible beer and packed with intense, aggressive flavor.

I love stone and Arrogant Bastard was my first beer from them, but after tasting their year round brews I just kinda forgot to go back and try this one. Big mistake on my part.  A: DEEP amber color, almost looking thick and creamy leaving the bottle. It had a one finger head atop a traditional pint glass with minor lacing and low carbonation.  S: Incredible smelling brew, almost entirely composed of sweet malts. The high alcohol was also prevalent with undertones of what seemed to be caramel or toffee.  T: Sweet, almost entirely carmel flavored at first, quickly followed by that signature Bastard hop bitterness. The bitterness resonates primarily from the rear of your tongue and doesn't diminish quickly.  M: Coats your entire mouth and gives your gums a tingle almost describable as burning.  O: Exceptional beer, among the greatest I have ever tasted, I suggest you go out and grab a bomber NOW if you haven't experienced this beer already.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,BJA,3.94,"2006 Vintage - Poured from 22oz bottle into perfect pint glass. My girlfriend drank some out of a snifter which I sniffed quite a bit.  I picked two bottles up at the grand opening of the Stone South Park, San Diego company store last week.  A: Deep copper/red color and slightly hazy. A finger and a half of creamy head stuck around for a few minutes and left nice lacing. Average carbonation on appearance. It looks very impressive: especially the deepness of color.  S: There is a strong malt aroma followed by hot alcohol. These dominate. I can also smell a bit of floral-pine-like scent mixed in. It is a full scent but not over powering. No hop smell to speak of.  T: Very malty flavor with an alcohol flavor on the end. This is what dominates. There seems to be a lot going on initially but it is quickly taken over by the alcohol. The aftertaste is long and is dominated by the malt and alcohol (like the initial smell and taste). Finished with a bit of caramel sweetness and alcohol.  M: medium mouthfeel (very malty) and carbonated quite well.  O: This is my first taste of Double Bastard. It is not distributed to Asia where I have spent the past several years and I failed to pick any up while it was still available around Christmas time this year. I look forward to trying the fresh version and other vintages and varieties (since I am so close to Stone now!), so I can make a better comparison. I have one more bottle of the 06’ vintage left. I will save it. I don’t think it will age any better though, and I suspect that this vintage is well on the other side of its peak. Despite the this, I greatly enjoyed the beer, and my girlfriend had no complaints.

147,1056,Cavery,4.1,"2009 750 ml bottle poured into a Stone Nonic.  Shared with Klym last weekend, review from notes.  A: Deep brown carmel with an appearance of darker fruit teas. Curtains of lacing loft over the former 2 1/2 finger head. Looks like something I want to drink.  S: Sweet alcohol rises to the nose, it ventures into toffee and dried lighter fruits. The nose is noticeably restrained (potentially from age), and made err on the side of a watery finish. That said, the lightness really isn't unwelcome, as it contrasts the up front alcohol.  T: Carmel and grainy brown sugar. Really smooth slow roast to caramelized flavors. Really great simmering malt sweetness with a complimentary deep cocoa-esque bitterness in form of an herbal hop end. Dried nectarine flesh lingers.  M: A light mouth that compliments the flavor. A master pairing of syrupy viscosity and rapidly dissipating small bubbles. A mouth that livens the taste buds and primes the drinker for rapid sipping.  O: All in all very good, but the volume needed to be turned up a bit to warrant the higher ABV. Strong alcohol with delicate feel and flavors. An illusion of barrel aging is testament to the craftsmanship of stone brews. Even with some novelty aging on this brew, it maintains a signature character that I can't imagine fading. I might prefer this fresh.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Klym,4.45,"Another morning beer with Cavery... I think we're going to need a long break after this fourth consecutive session!  Poured into a Stone nonic.  A: Pours a hazy maroon with a modest head (but one that stays through the session) of off-white color like a 75/25 mix of white and brown sugar. Lovely lacing to boot.  S: Hops, chocolate, lavender and roast in the nose. Already getting a sense of a crossed experience here with hops and lavender like an IPA and chocolate and roast like an RIS. Definitely interesting.  T: Suspicion confirmed, definitely getting a whirlwind of flavors here from different extremes of the beer spectrum. Hops, floral flavors, peanut brittle, chocolate, wood, and more all coming in and overlapping at different times. Each flavor seems to stick out on its own, and they don't blend together too much even when they are simultaneous.  M: I was worried about the carbonation because I didn't get much of a head even on a pretty violent pour but the carbonation was fine; no issues with the mouthfeel.  O: Really an interesting beer, not sure I've had anything much like it. While I would say it's tastey, its best quality seems to be its novelty. I could see some like this significantly more than others. If you like well blended, smooth beers, this one probably won't do too well by you.

This ale ages VERY well. The bourbony/alcohol notes are strong, but the beer is ultimately very drinkable (just don't chug the thing). The 12oz pour I was treated to was sipped on over the course of an hour, and what a wonderful hour that was.  Oak, smoke, alcohol esters dominate this brew. It is not for the faint-hearted. This is a powerful beer, both in alcohol content and in flavor. I would almost call it a beer for the whiskey-drinker, it's just that strong. This is just such an exceptional beer, I feel so lucky to have been treated to it.

No lacing remains on the glass, and some scattered yeast sediment is visible at the bottom.  S: Intensely malty, showing prominent toffee and caramel with some delayed fermented vinous fruit. It gives a suggestion of treacly sweetness to come, but little booziness.  T: Begins off-dry, with strong but balanced caramel malt and dark orange citrus hop aromatics. Husky and spirituous malt persists as heavy bitterness develops in the middle. Flavors are remarkably clean into the finish, with little else besides grain and bitterness contributing. The bitterness is profound at its most intense, seeming pure and undiluted, but it doesn't linger overlong.  M: Medium viscosity, slightly resinous, syrupy, and warming on the palate, with low carbonation.  D/O: While Arrogant Bastard may have started life as a happy accident on the part of Steve Wagner, this beer obviously tries hard to be as big and as bitter as possible. It packs barleywine-scale malt with a bittering hop profile of such immensity as seen in few other beers. Perhaps most impressively, it is even able to give a nod to balance amidst all of its extreme-ness. Acidity never becomes an issue, staying passive and allowing the layered malt qualities to develop. While the rare oaked version of this beer from 2006 is legendary in my personal estimation, the standard is pleasurable in its own right--and my personal favorite of Stone's big and well-distributed seasonal beers.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

After a couple sniffs the alcoholic esters are certainly noticeable.  T: This beer is complex, w/ its taste varying from sip to sip. Alternating between burnt roasted malts, earthy hoppy bitterness, and dominating alcohol flavors. The sweet/fruity aromas that dominated the smell, aren’t really appreciated in the taste, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. With all the complexity it manages to stay pretty well balanced. If one taste predominates the sips it’s an initial roasted malts followed by a hop bitterness finish. At some point as the beer warms I noticed some caramel and chocolate malt flavors, and occasionally the alcohol really comes out.

Amber body, with ruby highlights. Just a small amount of thin semi sticky lace.  Being a big fan of both Arrogant Bastard and Oaked Arrogant Bastard. I have to say this is a whole other beast.  The first thing, is the amount of complexity. It's unreal, how the flavors meld in and out with each other creating something beautiful. For 11.20% there is absolutely no alcohol present in both the nose and the palate. Very remarkable.  Aroma is very malt forward. Just deep, earthy malts. Some sweet vinous notes in the background, along with tobacco, leather, and fresh pine needles.  Taste is something to behold, and changes with each sip. Becomes more and more complex as the beer warms. Upfront sweet and malty, a barrage of pure unadulterated American Strong Ale. This is some SUBSTANTIAL malt presence. That is why it's in it's own category. This makes Barleywines look tame. Huge malt backbone - earthy, rich, caramel, chocolate, toffee, coffee - with that viscosity of syrup. Very aggressive. Then you add in the next huge factor. The oh so delicious hop balance. Holy hell, I bet it took a lot of attempts to get the hopping right on this one. It had to be unreal. But somehow, it manages the perfect equilibrium between both worlds. The resinous pine needle assertive hops really bring this one to a whole nother level.  I should smack myself for waiting this long to try Double Bastard. After this it makes Arrogant Bastard seem like a BMC offering. Holy shit, this is one amazing beer...  I have to say this is by far one of the better beers I've had in quite a while and has to be near the top of Stones offerings. I may never buy another Arrogant Bastard again.

Ends with pine hops giving way to acute bitterness and then the lingering alcohol in the nose. This is a strong beer somehow hidden but yet not.  M: Wanted to be syrupy but wasn't.

This beer is literally beating the shit out taste buds and making me like it. Getting a touch of bitter chocolate towards the end of each sip.

If that doesn't make since to you then you aren't worthy.  This beer is everything that I was hoping it would be. If you have any hesitation to try this beer, do as the bottle says and leave it for a WORTHY soul. This beer will make you bob for apples in the toilet AND MAKE YOU LIKE IT! Ya, thats right, I just quoted Sir Hamalot from The Sandlot. You probably aren't even worthy of that movie. You are Smalls and this beer is Benny ""The Jet"" Rodriguez.

Amber, honey color with a hint of red. Light amber-tan head that is quite forthcoming, thought it tapers off fairly quickly.  Rich, powerful nose on this one. Caramel malt, brandy-like booze, some citrus and spice. Some piney hops.  Caramel malt, intense warming alcohol, spice and fruitiness. Nice use of hops in this brew. This is what you would hope Stone's Old Guardian Barleywine would be like - intense unrelenting malt, but self-evident and undeniable hops keeping the brew honest. Hops bring about notes of pine and grapefruit. Aftertaste is a powerful combination of sweet caramel malt essences, booze and hop bitterness. Good God.  Smooth and full-bodied. Carbonation keeps this one from turning into a syrupy mess - it is just right. This beer makes its presence known.  A phenomenal brew.

S: The smell is a little hoppy to begin with along with some maltiness with hints of nuttiness and alcohol.  T: The taste is hoppy to begin with into a malty body the finish is caramel and with a hint of bitter charcoal. The taste is complex and evolves as it sits in your mouth.  M: Foamy and thick.

147,1056,RickS95,3.6,"Pours a thick, dark, murky brown. Looks like brown dirty river water. The head doesn't stay long, but it an off tan color.  The smell is a combination of fruits, citrus, hops and spicy yeast.  The smell doesn't quite come through on the palate. Mostly I just pick up hops and alcohol. I simply can't pick up the softer flavors.  Definitely a manly beer. For a split second, there is a sweetness from the fruit, but that sense is immediately squashed by bitter and heat from the hops and the alcohol. The high ABV isn't masked at all.  This thing borders on barley wine, only slightly less hoppy. It's got a lot of positives, it's just a bit more than I was hoping for.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,lynchtae,4.73,"Stone brewery seems tread a fine line between delicious and almost unpalatable. The key to this balance. Without balance the hops can be too bitter or the malts too sweet and cloying. Well done.  AP - Could use a bit more head, I like the color a nice nut brown.  SMLl - Expected more on the nose. You can tell there are lots of malts and hops, but I can't pick out any individual notes.  TST - Bit of a party in your mouth! Balanced. 11.5% alcohol and probably over 100 IBUS and it comes together nicely. Sweet caramel and a hint of molasses for the malts. Pine, citrus, a hint of Cinnamon and a nice bitter finish from a friendly dosage of hops.  MF - Feels great, give me more! Its nice when this much flavor can leave you wanting more. The drying affect of the hops leaves you wanting for more.  OA - I love it. I guess if you have flabby, underdeveloped taste buds it may be a bit much for you.

Really sweet but there's a definite kind of grainy malt flavor too. Followed nicely by a good punch of hop bitterness. Not too fruity or floral, I did get some pine flavor. Still the bitterness dominates. The end is a nice booziness to remind you how strong it is.  Mouthfeel: Very thick, syrupy.

S - Sweet malts, figs, sugar-coated dry fruits. There's also a good deal of hoppiness hiding down there. Changes almost ever time I try to get a scent of it... Very strong.  T - Unbelievably complex in its bittersweet nature. Seduces me into thinking it's an all-malt brew with sugar-coated galore for its flavor, but transforms into a monstrous beast! Butterscotch, rough, abrasive hops... It changes every time. I don't even know how to describe this.  M - Full bodied with a scorchingly good carbonation.

Dark brown/red color, nearly ruby...head does not last too long, but leaves a thick, sticky lacing after each delicious sip.  Sweet scent...reminds me of a doppelbock/barleywine hybrid...some dark fruits, mixed in with a bit of citrus hops, chased with sweet malt.  Taste follows smell...damn good. A lot going on...again, reminds me a lot more of a strong doppelbock, with hints of barleywine and DIPA thrown in. Unbelievable something at over 11% abv can be this smooth. Liquid velvet at its finest. Still, gets a bit hot as it warms, but that's to be expected with such a strong beer.  Gotta give this one a big thumbs up!

147,1056,BeerPhan86,4.3,"I've long been a fan of Arrogant Bastard ale, especially the oaked version. I first tried Double Bastard a couple years ago, and to be honest I don't really remember much about it. Found a bomber recently and decided to give it another whirl!  A - Very hazy orange and red, similar to fresh apple cider. A one finger tan head tops it off but dissipates quickly, yet leaves very sticky lacing.  S - Piney hops and fresh apples. Seems to be an apple theme here perhaps? Hints of oak and bready malt come to life after the initial hop blast.  T - The taste of this ale is very complex. Initially, a blast of sweet caramel and malt is present, giving way to a dry earthy hop blast. The finish again returns to caramel and malt flavors with a good amount of woody oak flavor. There is a lingering flavor of honey and citrus hops. Definitely more notes of apple in the aftertaste as well. Taking a fresh breath of air after each sip is wonderful, as there is a noticeable taste of crisp apples, piney hops, and caramel left in your mouth. The beer turns more hoppy as it warms. I'm very glad that the alcohol is so well hidden but that may also be due to the somewhat overly sweet aspect of the beer. Still, there are so many flavors here to ponder and enjoy that make it simply a delight to drink.  M - Chewy and somewhat heavy, but not overly carbonated. Slick and oily on the lips.  D - Much more sweet than I was expecting and definitely a strong strong ale. At 11.2%, I doubt anyone would consider this a session beer.  Overall I was pretty blown away by this. I was expecting something more along the lines of an Imperial IPA but this is definitely not that. Very complex, sweet brew with a hoppy undertone. I might as well move on to PBR after this next glass because my palate is destroyed! Another great beer from the folks at Stone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Fenris244,4.5,"Another one I've been waiting for for a while and just this week picked it up at specs!  Poured into my Jester King grand opening snifter, great color, it's a clear dark red with a thin almost tan head, poor retention on the head.  Dark fruit was the first thing I got, like plums and raisins then some floral notes from the hops and an intense sweetness as well as a more pronounced hoppy aroma.  Kinda sweet up front and as soon as I'm able to notice the sweetness I get a burst of hop bitterness that I was not expecting from the aroma, the bitterness lasts into the finish and is met by some of the dark fruit flavors I was expecting. The flavors all blend quite nicely together.  Stupidly smooth, medium in body, carbonation is nice. Words don't seem to be able to adequately express the smoothness of the beer. It's a joy to drink.  Overall, easily one of the top beers I've every had, smooth, extremely flavorful.

Large fluffy light tan head with excellent retention. Nose is powerful here; predominantly caramel malts with a slight grassy hop presence. Very sweet smelling. Taste is similiar with a largely malt forward strong ale taste though well rounded and balanced, no over used tastes. Sweet still, yet not cloyingly, with a faint bitterness present in the middle and a mellow/enjoyable finish. Nicely balanced abv. that never makes it's presence known. Medium heavy mouthfeel that remains refreshing and not dry. Overall, this is another well crafted beer by Stone in their Bastard series. While I won't comment on my favourite of the lineup without side by side comparison, the Double Bastard holds it's own as a remarkable world class craft beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S - Medium intensity of brown sugar, molasses, candy and perhaps a touch of floral scent.  T - Not what I was expecting from a Stone brew, but not bad at all. Just surprising to take that first sip and experience a smooth, malty sweet taste with overtones of dried fruit. A touch of hop bite on the back end. Apparent alcohol kick and heat also, but not overly so. Is this not a barleywine?  M - Lower carbonation than most brews and a syrupy mouthfeel.

147,1056,SkeeterHawk,4.25,"Typical for me, I haven't read the label on the bottle before reviewing it. I just saw this beer at my local Spec's in Kingwood, so I HAD to pick one up. This is one of the few regular Stone products that I haven't reviewed yet. Let's give it a go:  Appearance: Pours much like the original Bastard, a clear red-brown with a tan foam on top. This head was a bit smaller than you typically get for the Bastard with the same pour. After about a minute, it was reduced to a very thin ring where the beer meets the glass. There really isn't any lacing left on the glass after drinking.  Aroma: This beer must be too cold for serving as the aroma is very reserved for what I expected. It is actually balanced with the malt playing as big of a role as the hops, and in fact, though the hops seem to have the same character as the original Bastard, they are playing a supporting role to the bold malt character. I am liking this beer already. As the beer warms up, the aroma is just getting more spicy because of the alcohol coming out, but otherwise, it is the original Bastard's hop schedule with double the base malt. IMO.  Taste: I really didn't see this coming. This is probably the most overall balanced of any of Stone's big beers that I have tried. Even their Imperial Stout has more hop bite than this beer. I am not saying that I am disappointed by any means as I am a malt-head...but this surprised me from anything with ""Bastard"" written on it. Back to the beer, it starts out with some hops in the flavor, but quickly the malt takes over with lots of light caramel sweetness and some toasty notes as if there are some British malts in here. There is alcohol that comes pretty quickly lightening the mouthfeel and adding spice...and then making sure that you don't forget about it in the finish as you are left with a bit of a Vodka-like warming on the back of the throat. The body is full, and the carbonation is a bit low for what you COULD take for this beer, but it is hard to get gas into a beer this big, so it has quite a bit considering. The finish is all about the malt with some syrupy sweetness to linger on the palate for a bit before the fore-mentioned alcohol comes in and cooks it off. It is only late after the sip, in the burp, that the hops are more noticeable.  Opinion: I have been pretty impressed with this beer. It has a very deep malty character when compared to its brothers. I now see why the Basartd was so malty as I wasn't familiar with this one. I really think that this beer will age nicely, so I will probably pick up a few extra and put them back for at least 4-5 years before I give them a try again. The bittering hops are reserved enough that I think that they won't fight the aging and that this beer will turn ""Velvety"" like North Coast Old Stock does. Again, I am surprised by this beer, but it is in a good way for sure. I will be buying more, for sure.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Poured into my DFH snifter, pours an extremely dark but transparent amber color, some visible small bubbles come up from the glass, and some head (about 2 fingers). Smell- caramel, dark fruits, sugary sweet malts. Taste- big booming dark fruits, caramel, bitter hops, some alcohol warmth, maybe some liquorice on the end. The complexity here is amazing- this beer is in a class on its own. Mouthfeel- nice carbonation, medium bodied, silk smooth. Drinkability- despite its ABV, this is sneaky drinkable.

S: Extremely hoppy, sort of a cooked citrus sort of aroma, with some input from malts. 2010 release, so relatively fresh. It's a very intense aroma that greeted my nose as soon as I opened the bottle and just exploded as I poured.  T: The taste mostly follows the aroma. A brief, rough bitter hop assault followed by the mellow merging of hops and malt into an intense but smooth tasty party. The citrus dovetails into a broader array of flavors including some spice and piney notes. Alcohol is just barely noticeable, perfectly so.  M: Very good. It's big and bold but not heavy. Excellent carbonation.  D: Sippable, but not so much that the alcohol is going to sneak up on you.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,azdback,4.5,"You have to love the effort Stone goes through to make a really cool bottle. Another silk screened beauty. Poured into a Stone Imperial glass. Dark caramel color. A bit cloudy. Head is almost three fingers and off white in color. The head is now about 4 minutes old and has not moved a millimeter. It is very thick and luscious. I could probably do the smell from across the desk cause I'm getting all sorts of stuff already. The lace is a ringed and spotted beauty, like maybe a hybrid raccoon?  The smell is ultra sweet from the malts. I would say melted caramel comes to mind. Orange and Nectarine smells are welcomed to the mix. There is defiantly some alcohol there too.  My first sip was like diving into a whip cream topped hot coco. Most of the head ended up on my stash. This is very complex. There is a pallet wrecking bitterness and tartness at the same time. It is also sweet, but that doesn't last long because of the bitterness. I can pull out some caramelized sugar tastes. The alcohol is well disguised but does show itself late with a bit of a boozy warmness.  The mouth is just as a Barleywine should be. I know this is classified a Strong Ale... Sure!! At %11.2 in my eyes it's a Barleywine and I'm gonna grade it as so. It is very silky and creamy, a bit of chew to this one. Well carbonated and whole to the boozy warm end.  Once again Stone comes up Aces, in this case Double Aces. I truly enjoy all of Stone's brews, but the seasonal beers are over the top.

Huge robust burnt caramel and dark fruit with sweet sugars and nice balanced hoppy bitterness. Alcohol warms as it goes down but is incredibly smooth. Nice toffee and semi sweet chocolate as it warms. Mega sipper. I took this one with me in my convenient go go cup and enjoyed it in the passenger seat all the way home.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,deaconoflove,4.02,"Ap. Very nice cloudy golden brown with slightly yellow/tan strong head. Nice looking beer. Sm. Mild grapefruit, caramel/toffee and some alcohol. Ta. Surprised me with complex fruity flavors at first. Some caramel and malt. Slight alcohol burn comes on and then a lingering sweet, but biting bitter finish that hangs and hangs. Mf. Sweet thick sticky, but with full carbonation. Sippy, sippy. Dr. Good thing I've got a long evening ahead of me. This is one heavy duty sippy beer. Like a multi-flavorful carbonated glass of bourbon.

S: A bit of a resin smell with maybe some tart cherries or grapes? Some oak comes through too.  T: At first you get a slam of booze and hops, with the middle filling out with just a slight hint of malt and caramel, some oaky characteristics too, and finishes with a powerful hop residue in your mouth that lasts for a long time.  M: This one is thick and syrupy, and lingers quite a bit with a sticky sort of lace in your mouth. Slight carbonation, really awesome staying power.  O: This is an awesome beer. I honestly wasn't a fan of the first beer of this kind that I tried, arrogant bastard, and it turned me off to stone for a while. Then I heard someone really enjoying their old guardian and got back into them and they make some great stuff. If you're a fan of american strongs, this is awesome.

147,1056,DoubleSimcoe,4.3,"Stone Double Bastard, growler filled at Whole Foods Bowery for$13.99.  Appearance: My hasty pour produces a voluminous three-finger head reminiscent of a Belgian brew. Head is mostly white with toffee speckles, thick bubbles on top. Great retention, foamy top lingers throughout. I swear I've never seen the Bastard loloking so good and ""heady""! Some lacing, but not much. Color is dark-caramel, very dark and opaque- could be mistaken for bourbon.  Smell: Malt, glue, raisin, crushed ripe cherry. Hops, wooden barrel, bourbon/hard liquor. Beautiful, complex, enticing nose.  Taste: Not as interesting as the nose, with mostly heat, hops and booze. Caramel and tartness follow. Somewhat one-dimensional as compared to the aroma, but still delicious, with whiskey overtones and a burnt-sugar finish.  Mouthfeel: Prickly and hot, stings good and lingers in the mouth for a long while. Some booze, dry hoppy finish, tartness. Full body, medium-full flavor, great carbonation. Sticky, almost chewable but not quite like North Coast Old Stock and other old ales. A little too hot when it warms up.  Overall: A great, unimpeachable American Strong Ale. Might be a little hot when fresh, but it rarely ever disappoints. I've had it on tap, I've had Double Bastard vintages, growlers... a great brew, if you like the style.  I am very glad I reviewed this growler because I had one before that wasn't right.

Smells of caramel, toffee, sweet malt, and some dark fruits. Very inviting smells. This beer smells very much like a barleywine to me. Taste is very much like the smell and is of caramel, toffee, and sweet/brown sugary malt. Medium bitterness on the palate with each sip. There is a very good balance between the sweetness and the bitterness in this beer. A good level of carbonation leads to a creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a most excellent beer from Stone that I like much better than Arrogant Bastard. I am frustrated that I only got one bottle of this when it came out.

147,1056,FanofHefe,4.23,"Bottle says 2010 release. Poured into a Duvel tulip. Deep brown body with some red tint that is hazy and lets just a little light through. Two-finger tan head that looks good and leaves a little lacing.  The aroma is piney hops up front, followed by caramel and slightly bready malt. As you go down the glass, the hops taken on a little more character.  Boom! Bitter hop flavor just jumps out of this one. Strong oily pine resin flavor dominates. But, the overall flavor is pretty dense. The malt side is not overly sweet and mixes with the caramel very nicely. The flavors definitely blend together better as the glass warms.  The mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth for such a strong ale as this probably due to the oily nature of the huge amount of hops in this one. The name fits.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Hints of oak and wood emerge along with some notes of earthy pine.  T: Quite complex. Smooth caramel malt and sweetness, with an extra dry hop character. Macintosh apples definitely present in the flavor. Candied fruits like oranges and plums (and apples, of course). Burn of alcohol follows throughout the whole drink. Subtle hints of roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Boozy aftertaste.  M: Hoppy, fruity and boozy. Sticky on the palate. Full body with medium carbonation.

147,1056,scottchesterhall,4.6,"(2010 Release...drunk in March, 2011)  Appearance: Pours an opaque copper...lots going on here, it's apparent (not CLEAR...it's very cloudy). Is this a bottle-conditioned ale? Looks like it.  Smell: for a Stone beer, it's a malt knockout! Crazy biscuit sugary malt with just enough hops to not make is a sugar-bomb.  Taste: Wow...the layers of malt--&gt;caramel, honey, burnt sugar (in a good way). Not boozy, but the sweetness gives the 11% away. My only note that could be heard as a critique--not necessarily if you're an old ale fan--but this is a 2010, and on the very end I'm picking up a little oxidation.  Mouthfeel: full, round, almost syrupy, understated carbonation.  Overall: it's like Fat Tire meets Arrogant Bastard on steroids. This thing is special.  It's amazing how what's considered a category-breaker (in the original ""human strength"" Arrogant Bastard) due to it's explosion of malt and hops together, becomes surprisingly barleywine-belgian-esque when it gets ""doubled"" in it's ""immortal"" version. I'm a hop-lover, and this is nothing of the sort of beer I drift toward...yet I'll take one of these every time it's offered to my grave.  If you were looking for a Sierra Nevada Bigfoot and missed it, this can serve as a nice backup. More biscuity, but otherwise a cousin.  If you take one thing away from this review: take a hearty sip of one of these...and then just pay attention...for like 5 MINUTES...things just keep happening.

Foam settles to a medium filleted ring around the glass. Clear deep ruby red color with light suspended bubbles.  Smell is a solid balance of citrus hops and caramel malt. Fruit notes, a bit of chocolate. A light alcohol sting is present, but expected.  Taste kicks in hard, almost as if it was bourbon barrel aged. Creamy smooth sweet malt. Complex. Middle brings on bitter oily hops and strong well blended alcohol. Overall balance is terrific for such a strong brew.  This is absolutely a sipper, which you know up front given the ABV. I find the alcohol is quite apparent in all of Stone's high ABV beers, but this is one of the best blends.

147,1056,gdrydenc,4.6,"A - Pours a dark, dark auburn/brown with an inch of dark tan head. Cherry highlights when held up to the light.  S - Smells a bit like an aggressive barleywine with a lot of dark, ripe fruits. Additionally, there is a lot of molasses and the alcohol is apparent.  T - This is one of the most flavor intense beers I've ever experienced. The taste is a lot like the smell, very much like a barleywine. The fruits come out more, and the alcohol is very present. Without the alcohol, this would feel weak, though. It's more bitter (especially at the end) than I would expect.  M - The mouthfeel is wonderful. It's a bit syrupy, which is nice for the style. The carbonation is a little on the low end for what I would expect, but that's not an issue.  D - Frankly, when it comes to American Strong Ales, there's no such thing as an incredibly drinkable beer. However, I have never had an issue finishing a bomber of this beer.

147,1056,StoutCream,4.63,"Did the devil just piss in my mason jar? Because that's what I drink out of. Quart size when it comes to bombers. This one is half head half beer, and I know what I'm doing when I pour. Can't mind that much good head, but stay away from the Herp. Dark, cloudy amber (like, the darkest amber you've ever seen) looks thick and rusty straight on, but tilted in the light reminds me of a redheaded woman: stubborn and wild at the same time. Can you handle this? If you haven't had a red head, I wouldn't recommend it. Then again, enough of these will lower your inhibitions enough to actually pursue that cute redhead at the bar. Also not recommended. Both require proper supervision.  As the foam dissipates it smells like a Hawaiian Tropic store. Coconut pineapple (oddly enough I just ate a pineapple this morning that tasted like coconut) that slowly changes into malt, super-sugary malt with some green-y hops at the whiff.  Now to the piss, uh, beer . . . SOOO Heady! Drunk in one sip, no lie. Just let that first swig linger in your mouth for a while before you swallow and I bet you will feel something - something in the back of your mind that says, ""Did I just feel that in my brain?"" The answer is maybe. I was already 22oz deep before I cracked this one, so that one sip might have taken me over some sort of threshold that I wasn't expecting. Whisked is more like it. So damned malty sweet, yet balanced off the back of my tongue with bitterness.  There is still an island of head on top teasing my nose with each sip.  The flavors are difficult to pin down, not that I don't recognize them, but they are whizzing around each other so fast that I can't tell where one ends and another begins. Cop-out, you say? Think Heisenberg. You can't tell where it is or how fast it's going at the same time and, trust me, all that alcohol puts the flavors in the fast lane to Digestion Land. Burnt sugar and ginger. Cinnamon toast and over-fried garlic. All while chewing on a piece of pine (which is toxic, don't do that) and a handful of grass (the lawn kind, hippie).  This beer has it's place . . .

147,1056,garymuchow,4.2,"2010 release poured into 25 oz Old Style glass. Sweet, toffee candy aroma, like an old ale with hop wrapped around the fragrance. Presentation close to Am. style barleywine. Still malt dominated and complex. Full bottle pour. Dense dark head covers a dark amber body with darker reds moving towards burgundy and garnet. Boy, that's a nice drink. Complexity in both the hops and malt. And for a rather big beer the alcohol is neither hot or excessive in flavor. Bitterness in a very long finish that holds a hop flavor too (tart citrus grassiness). Flavor lacks the candy and toffee sweetness fo the aroma. In fact the sweetness is a little harder to find. The malt flavors are still rich, but the hops start to dominate in time. Nice body. Full, big holding a nice steady soft carbonation. Smooth. Drinks big, but also drinks easily.

Large hints of caramel hue in the color as well.  Smell - Smells quite bready and malty. A strong bitter scotch and lemon smell as well. Smells of some kind of fruit that I can;t exactly pinpoint. Smells similar in ways to a doppelbock in terms of malts. Slight chocolate on the nose as well.  Taste - The hop profile is quite delicious and it burns slightly like scotch. The taste is somewhat medicinal to me and reminiscent of a heavily malted Wee--Heavy. Very strong in terms of dark fruit taste. Hints of dark cherries to be more specific. A very faint chocolate that I am perhaps confusing with the dark cherry.  Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Exceptionally bitter and alcoholic tasting. A slight bourbon-scotch burn accompanied by dark fruits. The medicinal taste got to me at times, but didn't ruin the beer for me.

T - Very sweet almost to the point of being syrupy and the alcohol is noticeable. There's definitely some hops there as well, but they're a bit masked by the amount of malt. M - Mouthfeel is heavy, somewhat viscous almost verging on feeling like a syrup. This beer lingers in your mouth a bit after you swallow. D - Big beer all around, too big to drink a lot of it. The sweetness was too heavy for me to really enjoy more than one.  This beer reminds me a lot of homebrew barley wines I've had. It's big, alcoholic and in your face.

I have enjoyed the other Bastards, but do find them intense, so I figured save the biggest for last. And it turns out to be the best.  Appearance: Pours a nice copper brown color with a 1 finger light brown head, leaves considerable lacing  Smell: Piney and citrusy hops, robust malt and some alcohol in there. Intense as expected.  Taste: Intense, but not as intense as Arrogant Bastard. The flavors are amped up, but they are better married together. Again, like the smell, piney and citrusy hops, robust malts, but no alcohol in the taste. Some caramely sweetness to balance the hoppy bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, decent carbonation, bitter finish.  Drinkability: Well, I will be able to finish the whole bomber, but I don't think I'm going to want more after that. Way better than I was expecting.  Overall, I'm impressed, and really want to get a 3L growler of it next time I'm in San Diego.

147,1056,ehammond1,4.05,"Bottle (2010)  Holiday Wine Cellar Escondido, CA  A murky and velvety auburn with some glowing bright orange along the edges with a thin tan head. This beer appears thick and lightly carbonated. It doesn't take long for the short head to fall away. There's some lacing but not an abundance of it. While the color is beautiful, an altogether disappointing appearance.  The nose is all kinds of sweet with a hint of citrus hops. The main citrus fruit I smell is orange but the nose is dominated by sweet candied-cherries and sticky caramel. It smells like a strong barleywine, as there's certainly the aroma of warm alcohol mixed in with the candy-like sweetness. So far, this beer appears more closely related to Stone's Old Guardian Barley Wine than it does it's ""little brother"" Arrogant Bastard.  The taste is a mouth-blasting brigade of bitter and citrus hops, sweet, fruity and caramel malts, and a deluge of hot alcohol. The most upfront flavors are the sweet fruits, namely cherries, and a punch of bitterness. The warm alcohol toward the finish though reminds you to be careful with this one. While the flavors are certainly bold and ""in your face,"" I think this one could particularly benefit from some aging.  Creamy and thick mouthfeel that fits the beer exceptionally well.  I always look forward to my first Double Bastard, as it's a showcase of so many different flavors all coming together as one.

This one had the appearance that it would pack a punch and sure enough, it did. That being said, this was a fabulous beer that took just a bit of adjusting to since it certainly put the ""strong"" into Strong Ale!  Solid pour to this even though the vibrant brown hue was just a bit darker than I imagined. Nice frothiness to this too but the lacing didn't quite match up to it. As others have alluded to on here, this tasted and felt like a Barleywine once I sampled some but the subtly overpowering citrus and pine-flavored hops reminded me that this has a lot more bite to it than that. It even smelled a bit like alcohol but in no way did it detract from the mouthfeel or the smooth aftertaste that had a very dry-hopped feel to it.  Not a session beer by any stretch of the imagination but this is good enough that one person could down the whole bottle. That's only because the taste is addicting and can overcome the strong aspect of this beer.

Great smooth start of sweet plum, raisin, orange, chocolate, and then the sour hits you with pine, lime, grapefruit, more grapefruit, and lemon peel. This is what beer should be.

I can taste the roasted malt, a wee bit of the dark fruit (fig/plum), and slight caramel hiding. The earthy hops appear but add only a small bit of bitterness... just enough to help balance. Booze is present but not overwhelming. This ale is full bodied with medium carbonation. The slightly dry finish surprised me but it could be the hops playing tricks with my palette.

147,1056,ffejherb,4,"On tap at Brass Rail Deli on 2/21/11.  A - Hazy reddish liquid with deep amber hues and a creamy beige head that settled into a patchy veil, leaving behind some spotty lacing.  S - Hint of boozy alcohol amid leafy, herbal hops and plenty of toffee and caramel malt notes. The alcohol presence really opened up as the liquid reached room temperatre.  T - Pretty intense herbal, earthy hop flavor with lots of dry, leafy character. A healthy dose of toffee and caramel malt provides a bit of sweetness, but the dry hoppy flavor lingers on for a while. Finishes with moderate alcohol sting on the palate.  M - Surprisingly, Double Bastard boasts a pretty creamy mouthfeel with a subtle wash of carbonation on the tongue. Finishes with residual sweetness and a semi-dry, lingering hop bite on the palate.  D - You gots to love a really hoppy strong ale, and that's exactly what Double Bastard is. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. Good stuff!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Bottle poured into tulip glass  Appearance : dark amber with a well formed head and good retention lacing sticks to my glass all the way down  Smell: citrus malt carmel hop aromas smells like this is going to taste strong  Taste: wow! strong tasting bombastic ale- bitter biting after taste I love it really attacks your palate- not much. sweetness  Mouthfeel: good mouthfeel not as syrupy or thick as I thought it would be - no escaping the boldness of this brew not for the faint of palate.light carbonation  Drinkability: suffers a little bit because of its strong biting nature of this beer .The more I drink the easier it is to drink.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,bagpiper2005,4.57,"Pour: A clear, deep brownish maroon color. A finger and a half of tan head that dissipated fairly quickly and left some lacing on the glass.  Smell: Huge whiff of flowers as you open the bottle. Underlying hints of pine and grapefruit with a backbone of caramel malty goodness and a slight alcohol presence.  Taste: The beer starts off with a sweet banana-like flavor with just a touch of pine. Very assertive caramel malt and molasses presence also in the front end. Spicy alcoholic and biscuity middle with a touch of chocolate. Finish rather dry with a moderately intense pine and grapefruit hop bite. A hint of pineapple comes through in the front as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: Thick, syrupy, and chewy. Incredibly smooth with low carbonation.  Drinkability: Wow, this stuff burns on the way down (reminds me of a good Scotch). Filling, and a bit of a challenge to the palate, but makes a great sipping experience and highly drinkable for the ABV.  Final Notes: You might want to skip dinner, I can feel the calories just piling up as I drink it. A huge, bold, beautifully complex tasting beer that will take you all night to discover all the hidden nuances. Drink it nice and warm as to attenuate the alcohol. Also drink this one by itself as you'll likely not taste your food with it! Incredible beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S- Toffee, caramel, alcohol are the first thing to hit the nose. Candy corn and some faint dried dark fruit.  T- Sweet dark fruit... caramel, a touch of bitter coffee, butterscotch and a punch of alcohol (although not unpleasant). Cinnamon bun as is warms up.  M- Really coats the tongue and hangs onto it!

147,1056,afksports,4.43,"If you're such a bastard that you're a double bastard then you must have done something wrong.  But if loving this beer is wrong, I don't wanna be right. I've knocked back the better version of DB (not douchebag) wherever possible. Of the vintages (2006 through 2010), my favorite was the 2007 that was aged about 3 years. This review's for that one.  An American Strong Ale clocking in at 11.2% alcohol by volume, Double Bastard pours with a hazy amber hue and sultry head that maintains good lacing throughout the drink. The nose has some orange citrus notes remaining even though it's now 3 years old, but it's mostly sweeter malts covering booze. Still has a bite on the tongue when you first sip it, but that's mostly alcohol. There's citrus present in the taste, and after 3 years I'd say it's mostly a sweet and strong brew without too much present of yeast at all. In fact, it's still fantastic.  Medium-bodied and great to finish, one 22 ounce bomber of this should put you to bed. And it can do that regularly, because at about $7 a bottle it's affordable for the quality, and still widely available.  I'm starting to think that maybe a double bastard isn't a bastard at all. Like a double negative or something.  More beer needed to consider this further.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S: Big floral presence, with ample grapefruit and pine. Hops are expressive, and accompanied by a rich caramel profile and bready notes. Nice combination of caramel and hops.  T: Slightly sugary caramel with notes of grapefruit and pine. Booze is restrained for the ABV. Midpalate ephemeral sweetness. Firm bitterness with low astringency. Finish is dry.

The color is dark caramel and the beer looked almost syrupy.  I smelled a contradicting aroma of citrus hops and roasted malts. Just when I thought the hops were more prevalent, I decided the malts stood out more. Then I changed my mind.  The taste is just as enjoyable of a contradiction. Sharp bitterness is balanced with roasted malts. They both take turns messing with your palate. This is a very serious beer that will make you think about exactly what it is you're drinking.  And at 11.2% ABV, it will punch you in the face. Highly recommended and enjoy it carefully.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The taste is bitter upfront then the sweet malt works in; the alcohol is upfront as well. This is a great canidate for aging. The body is big and the hop oil, alcohol wear down your taste buds.

Orange zest, clove and coriander.  T: OMFG, explodes on the tongue with strong astringent alcohol and pine hops, burnt caramel sugars and citrus with a biscuity, malty finish. Very tasty.  M: Chewy and rich. Full bodied doesn't begin to cover it. Very fine carbonation and goes down easily.  D: Smacks your butt due to the high alcohol content.

147,1056,MrHirschybar,4,"2006 Vintage - growler from 2/12/2011 at Stone's Saturday release night Poured into a New Belgium Globe/snifter  A - Dark copper with off-white head that leaves lacing - copper is dark and not see through even up to the light  S - Malty, bready, initially a mustiness that turned into a sweet bourbon like smell, with hop citrus and a lingering sweetness and alcohol smell  T - sweet, bready, citrus, maltiness - very much reminded me of the similar vintage of 06' Old Guardian -  M - smooth, light coating, minimal to no carbonation, definite alcohol heat on the back-end not sure what remains of the 10% the label states in ABV, but it drinks well despite the heat on the back-end  D - I enjoyed this - a lot of friends of mine that don't like barley wines didn't like this, and my brother - who liked the 06 Guardian didn't care much for this due to the heat on the back-end. I feel it is quite drinkable despite the bit of heat on the finish - seems many were in agreement as they lined up for the release at Stone with quite a few 3L Double Bastard bottles to fill - even a husband and wife couple both with 3L and a couple down from Burbank to Escondido to fill this one up. Cost for a fill at 2L was around $16... Well worth that price. Definitely sweetened up from age compared to the '10.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,nhindian,4.17,"""Ye shall know the Bastard, and the Bastard shall set you free.""  22oz bottle poured into a Double Bastard glass.  A - Pours the color of a deep sunrise; dark orange with a burst of ruby interspersed. Only builds a slight head, about a finger's worth at most. Very nice lacing, thin but covers most of the glass.  S - Smell is actually a bit more balanced and maltier than I would've expected, but much more complex. It's still aggressively hopped, but I'm getting some fruits and sweet malts as well to counter-act that. Make no mistake, this thing still threatens to destroy your mouth. I'm getting some alcohol heat as well.  T - The taste has an intense hop bite at the hop, but it is quickly neutralized by sweetness. Not overwhelming, but enough to curb the hop bitterness. Slight grapes and sugar come through midway, before having the alcohol make a resurgence. Not sure I'd peg this at 11%+, but the alcohol is no stranger in this beer. Finishes bitter and long.  M - After drinking a bomber of this alone in a moderately short amount of time.... I'm doubting that I am worthy of this beer. About 3/4's through and my mouth is a mess; hops, alcohol, and sweetness have wrecked my palate and are settling in for good. It's moderately thick with good carbonation and lingers for minutes afterward.  D - Drinkability is high. While it's not the hop bomb I was expecting from a Stone beer, it borrows some balance excellence from Old Guardian and is incredibly easy to drink. The alcohol is only there to tempt you while the flavors pop long after the sip is done, but unfortunately as it warms the alcohol becomes MUCH more prominent.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

T: Starts out with a punch of sweet raisin and date, followed shortly by toasted malt, which fades into a lingering hop finish. This is how I imagine that gum in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" that takes you through an entire meal while you chew it. Is the brewmaster at Stone an oompa loompa?  M: Lovely texture of tiny bubbles. Rich and creamy but not oily. The mouthfeel really brings out the flavor.

This really is a double bastard. It truly is double strength Arrogant Bastard - all around. Sweet maltiness is balanced by bitter hops. There is some orange peel citrus, earthy, can taste the alcohol. M & D - smooth considering the strength of the taste as well as the ABV. You can taste and feel the high content.

We also experienced a nice, pretty 1.5"" foam head that sticks around a little while  S - Well, what hit me first was a sweet yet evil mixture of hops and cherries that gives way quickly to something oaky and chocolately, and then ultimately changes back to an earthy fruity smell again. So beautiful and so strange... (my apologies to Mudvayne for stealing their lyric)  T - Never has a smell and taste matched so well without being able to fully explain either. There was such a bold and confident delivery of sweet burning dark fruit hops here that you could almost forget that it was waiting in the glass for further contemplation. The finishing taste is that of a more caramel covered alcohol carrying hop truffle.  M - Very full bodied and not overly carbonated.

147,1056,climax,4.64,"The body pours a deep red, more of a reddish copper hue than the original. The head is a creamy even tan layer which fades pretty quickly.  The aroma is complex and intriguing.... very much so. In fact, it's lovely enough to yield a 5. This is what you get when sweet ripened fruit, snappy hops, wood aged goodness, a substantial malt backbone, and a hint of alcohol have an orgy. Dashes of mandarin orange citrus and herbal notes stand out enough to please hop-head's nostrils. Yet, the sweet ripened plum, caramel, clove, banana, warming alcohol, and wood barrels keep me sniffing. If Stone made a Double Bastard potpourri, I'd buy a pallet.  The alcohol shows it's true arrogance in the taste, letting me know I'm not worthy enough to quaff it as quickly as I initially intended. It's warm from beginning to end, while the flavors come and go. Sweet buttery biscuits and caramel rolls satisfy the sweet tooth, while the hoppy dry bitterness balances it out perfectly.  The feel is excellent, Stone really has this aspect down to an art. The carbonation stings with the alcohol initially. That dies down quickly and allows a bold dryness to take over. The body is very full, yet the dry finish urges me to sip on. This beer is not joking.

Somewhat brown/tan/honey to tight cream colored head that will not go away. Very dark red brown body but also kind of cloudy. Excellent retention with the head falling evenly throughout the glass.  Kind of a closed nose on this but an interesting one of chewy malt and burnt spices. Fruity mush bananas also. Unfortunately it's not very open and easy to enjoy.  Taste though is a big improvement and a surprise. A giant rush of cinnamon comes through first with sweetness and sugars, even some nutmeg. Hop bitters come next and some lime astringency feel. Silky in the mouth, and some banana comes through in the taste also.  This is quite good, but the nose leaves me a bit disappointed.

The seemingly slight carbonation seems almost suspended within the heavy particulates.  AROMA: Mild burnt sugar and faint caramel aroma. A heavy citrus and pine hop with a light floral accent and light toasted malt completes the complex delight.  TASTE: A light burnt sugar and caramel taste compliments the heavy hoppy taste of floral and grapefruit, making this a somewhat bitter delight to the senses.  MOUTHFEEL: Exceptionally smooth and creamy, the modest carbonation after pouring struggles to break free from this thick bodied brew. the initial flavor is somewhat sweet and bitter. There is a heavy bitter finish that lingers for a moderate amount of time. Body lacing is excellent.  DRINKABILITY: I'm a sucker for a good strong ale and this is probably the best I've ever tasted -- a memorable beer experience that blasted my taste buds.

147,1056,hoppyhampy,4.28,"22oz bottle poured into a tulip. 2010 vintage. Pours a cloudy reddish orange with one finger of foam and good carbonation evident. Good lacing. Nose is sweet and malty but not so rich as to be syrupy. A little nutty but mainly it just smells like a massive beer. Very nice mouthfeel for such a big beer. Full bodied but the carbonation doesn't let it sit too heavy on the palate. For a beer with no evidence of hops on the nose it is surprisingly bitter on the palate. A malty sweetness comes on smooth and is balanced out by a mouthful of resiny hops. The finish is hoppy but not overly so. The malt balances quite well here so the finish is light, long, and very enjoyable. Not as clean a finish as the Lucky Bastard but similar in character. One of the best beers over 10% abv you will find and worth every penny.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,BigPlay1824,4.38,"Served in a Stone pint glass that I was fortunate enough to get for $2.00 with the purchase of the brew. The brew pours a brownish amber color with an ample amount of foamy off white head that lingers nicely for a bit on the top of the brew. Double bastard leaves a significant amount of lacing on the glass. The beer has a great scent of hops with a slight grapefruit note and a nice underlying medium malt note that helps to counter the hop intensity a bit. Double Bastards taste nearly precisely matches the scent but there is a slight alcohol sting that kicks it way through just to remind you that it is a strong ale. Overall, the brew drinks as smoothly as something that offensive and intense possibly could and only furthers my assertion that Stone is making some of the best beers on the planet.

Deep amber red/orange and cloudy.  S - Grapefruit hops with toasted malts and caramel in the background. A bit of the alcohol pushes through, too.  T - Hops, hops, and more hops. Tons of bittering hops. Lemon and orange rind, grapefruit. Malts are very subdued. The big ABV is well-hidden as a long finish of hops stays planted in the middle of the tongue.

T= the taste is strong hops as well as the sweet caramel. The hops seem a little faded in a way but still hold strong. The alcohol makes itself evident in a little way.

Citrus marmalade, magic marker, barky orange rind, a bit of chocolate malts and a whiff of booze on the nose. Caramel and fruit compote malts followed by orange and nettle hops. Clingy finish, and a scorched earth aspirin bitterness linger. Medium to big, chewy, sticky, plenty of burn and a saltwater taffy gooiness. Passionfruit and some tropical Simcoe-like hops peek out as it warms.  2010 release: Big malts, big bitterness, yet still remains drinkable. Ironically, the sticky sweetness coats the tongue against the IBUs. But way too hot to be a good drinker.  2007 release: Darker chocolate brown tones, less head, some port and brown sugar aromas, malts have thickened into toffee, hops are gone except of a slight oiliness, much fuller, rounder and smoother.

Alcohol presence is definitely there and helps fill the area around the glass with aroma.  For a fresh bottle, this 2010 release isn't as bracingly bitter as the 2008 or 2009 releases that I had drank fresh. The citrus and light pine hops are balanced perfectly by the biscuit and caramel malt backbone. Nice lingering flavor at the back of your throat, aided by a small amount of alcohol heat. Medium bodied beer with soft carbonation provides a great drinking experience, allowing the hoppy malty beverage to shine without being cloying or syrupy.

Aroma is pleasent but not a standout, there is caramel and cherry notes but they seem rather diminished. I swirled the glass and tried pouring a bit more in pretty vigerous, and got some more Citrus hints, but they fought to stay hidden. The hops come through alot more in the flavors, and citrus is most prominant, but this is in no way a bitter beer, there is to much sweet brown sugar and caramel going on over the top of the citrus.

S- pungent grapefruit, floral notes, caramels, lemon, grapefruit, roasted notes, and an imitation cherry hint. Booze is strong and viscous.

S: Cherries, caramel malt, floral and slightly fruity (dark) hops, alcohol. Smells very sweet, reminds me of a barleywine.  T: Surprisingly mellow. Based on what I've heard about this 2010 release I was expecting this to kick me in the face but it seems the opposite. Alcohol isn't overly obtrusive (compared to BCBS it's invisible). I get cherry notes, dark sugary fruits (almost candy like), strong caramel malt, floral/earthy hop characteristics, and some alcohol. The initial hit seems very cherry and candied fruit hop punch and a little alcohol, it then smooth outs to caramel malt/floral hops and finishes dry and warm, slightly bitter and sugary. Almost tastes like someone dropped a cherry jolly-rancher in it. This reminds me of a Treble Hook Barleywine with more depth, complexity, and balance.  M: Medium carbonation, fully body, very chewy, viscous - coats everything, very smooth. Finish is dry.  D: As with most beer, this seems to get hotter the further in you get. It's fairly heavy malty body makes it pretty filling as well. Pretty much a sipper.  This is a hard one to rate for me.

Not much carbonation up through the body, and fine, resinous sheets of lacing lingers. Looks really nice.  S: I almost feel drunk smelling this. Not boozy specifically, but a large malt nose with a good, but somewhat gentle dose of hops. The usual raisin or stone fruit notes in a malty brown beer are there.

Smells, quite ominously, of exotic fruit, alcohol and burnt sugar.  I can best describe the impression from the first gulp as - it's like biting into an otherworldly juicy fruit. Kind of like a persimmon from a different planet. An exceptionally bitter, flavorful, grassy persimmon. It occupies entire mouth and assaults every taste bud with a gamma of aromas. I can't make out initial taste, or the aftertaste - it's just one huge taste bomb. Bitter, juicy, sweet, woodsy, chocolaty, almost a liquid dessert.  I'm puzzled by this beer. It's definitely not a session beer, I can't imagine it going well with any kind of food, really...yet it does create an experience. I can't say I'm a fan, though.

147,1056,zoso493,4.7,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a Stone Ruination straight-sided pint glass.  Appearance: Double Bastard pours an ominously dark, burnt amber that is exceedingly murky and thick. Just by looking at this brew, you can tell that it is a big, unfiltered beast of a beer, made by brewers who dare not go cheap on ingredients. Only a wafer thin head forms on top of the beer that consists of only bubbles. The head settles quickly to coat the top of the beer and leaves no lacing on the glass.  Smell: Double Bastard has a nose which requires one to get several sniffs to properly decipher the complexity at hand. The biggest scent to be found is a syrupy conglomeration of think, malt that is reminiscent of a big barleywine (what's the difference anyway?). Somewhere in there I can detect a resinous presence of piny hops.  Taste: At first sip, I was convinced that Double Bastard was worthy of the ultimate score. This is a phenomenal beer. The taste generally follows the smell, except it greatly expands on each of the individuals flavors. The massive malt backbone is ever-present and provides tastes of candied cherry and rum-soaked fruit.  The most amazing part about DB is that, though the malts are massive and delicious, the hops play just as large a role in the taste as their malty counterparts. I guess in this respect you might term DB a ""balanced"" beer, but this would be an injustice to the brewers. The hops are resinous and monolithic in the taste and would make DB a great beer on their own.  Mouthfeel: DB is certainly on the thicker side of things for a strong ale. This comes as no surprise when you consider the amount of malt and hops that must have gone into this bottle. The hops border on cloying but are just sticky enough to provide a pleasantly viscous aftertaste.  Drinkability: DB is no session ale, but the amount of it in this bomber is diminishing quickly. There is absolutely no trace of alcohol in it as well, which is no small feat a beer of 11.2% ABV.  Overall, Double Bastard is a tremendous beer. It is generously hopped, massively delicious, and masterfully crafted. Arrogant Bastard is a very good beer, but Double Bastard takes it to another level. This is just a fantastically complex and tasty brew. DB is a world-class beer and one that deserves to be consumed in earnest.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

It certainly smells stronger than the regular Arrogant Bastard.  Taste: Caramel and toasted malts are very prevalent up front, with some booziness and plenty of hops on the back end. Honestly, this beer reminds of a barleywine with a more roasted malt profile. It tastes very good.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied with fairly low carbonation leads to a syrupy, very smooth drinking beer. Very nice. This is a pretty strong beer, and I can tell.

147,1056,TheBrewo,4.35,"This brew pours a deep red orange, with a one and a half finger yellow tinged head which retains for a bit. It is hazy, with waves of fine particulates swirling about. Carbonation is low, from a visual standpoint, and minimal lacing appears. The aroma is quite bold, with salty malts, strawberries and raspberries, and caramely diacetyls. The hops used appear citric and piney. As we sip, hops overpower the caramel and malts off the bat. This extreme hop bitterness mellows out through the middle, where malts and sweetness take center stage. Here the sweetness is not of berry fruit, but rather of a sugary and apple type origin. This, however, does not last long, as citric hops come crashing down in the finish to rejuvenate the palate with hoppy bitterness, while the alcohol finally rumbles forth to the taste buds. The finish is also a bit salty, towards the backmost part of the mouth. The aftertaste is more of those fresh hops, with a bit of grapefruit. The body is medium to full and the carbonation is on the higher end, as it leaves a tingly feeling on the lips. The mouth is neither dry nor coated, but is left satiated. The abv is certainly getting up there and, while generally absent from the nose, warms the drinker more and more after each sip. This makes for medium drinkability.  Overall, what we found to be best about this brew was the fruitiness in the nose, as well as the boldness of the flavoring. The aroma was probably the most surprising thing about this experience, as we detected unexpected fruits and dark roasty caramel. The taste was also a bit of a nice surprise, as it was a bit of a departure from the aroma. The best description we could come up with was that this beer is the lovechild of a hefty doppelbock and a double IPA, giving us a tasty treat and quite a lot to think about.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The hop bitterness continues to build and get stronger the whole way through. There are nice notes of caramel, brown sugar, and a touch of alcohol. The finish is very hoppy and sticks to the mouth. There is a lingering bitterness.  M - This has a medium body and good carbonation. It has a smooth and creamy feel to it. The finish is dry and crisp. There is also a bitterness that sticks to the mouth and slowly fades.  D - The drinkability for this is awesome. I love this beer. The taste is great, and I could drink these all night.

The taste was incredibly bitter, there were no fruit notes, or other flavors notieable, just the taste of ale.

To elaborate on that; I taste brown sugar, piney hops, and some slight alcohol. I have been out of my game as of late so just go with it.  M: Medium body, silky and smooth with good carbonation.

T - Big malt backbone here, sweet caramel, toffee and brown sugar and then you get hit with the grapefruit and pine hops. Nice bitter finish that lingers and invites the next sip.

Smells of citrus fruit and malt sweetness which combine to create a pineapple aroma. The taste is absolutely huge, rich, and complex. Very balanced in the front with lingering bitterness and alcohol hotness on the end. All things considered, I do not get and overdose of alcohol flavor here. I would not say this is boozy at all. The ridiculous amount of malt and hops win out. Full bodied and bordering on syrupy. Intense flavor and alcohol hurt the drinkable, but this a great beer.

This beer is awesome, you can taste the grapefruit, lemon, orange of the huge hops but is off-set by a nice caramel toffee malt. This beer has a sticky mouthfeel with a resiney aftertaste.

I'm sensing a whiff of alcohol that I'm sure I'll be tasting shortly. I'm smelling some a little hoppness, but not much. Woah, taste them hops! First sip is a smooth hop bombardment. Slight alcohol warm does a nice job lifting the hop flavors. Lots of pine and wood flavors going on. Slight notes of caramel maltiness. Very chewy hop aftertaste. It's like a pine tree was left behind and I'm chewing its bark. I'm glad there's not thick, sugary aftertaste, that was my fear of how this beer would finish. Score. This is more than less what I had expected from this beer. Certainly not for the faint of heart. A person can easily finish a bomber of this, but then I'd call it a night.

147,1056,HopDiggityDawg,4.28,"22 oz Bomber Dated 2010 Appearance - Dark as you would expect from a Double Strong Ale Smell - Nice aroma, not a hop bomb or an overpowering smell of Malt.  Taste - This is where the party goes from 0-60mph in 1 sip. With bottle graphics this intimidating and evil looking, this brew better bring it! The further you get into this 22oz liquid UFC knock-down drag-out fight the more you realize that you have something very rare and special. As a hard core Hop Head, trying anything other than a Imperial or Double IPA takes you out of your comfort zone, but this brew has Hop punches from beginning to end.  Drinkability - This is a sessionable beer, as in,1 bomber per sitting. It is also great to split with a buddy that is worthy and battle-tested.  If you love and appreciate beer then you have to try this one. It will be one that I save for special occasions and celebrations.

S: Sweet malt with bitter hops. I'd like to say I smell more here, but really can't. What I am able to sense is good though.  T: Malt is what you notice first, but it doesn't take long for the piney/grapefruity hops to assert themselves. Dry, sticky finish. Malts come back a little in the aftertaste. Really nice how the malt and hops playoff one another. Well balanced.  M: Almost bubbly which is surprising considering how dry it finishes. Some stinging.  D: It'll take a little while to finish a bomber of this by yourself, but with that said, this is a very drinkable beer. The dry quality really slows things down, especially towards the end as the beer warms to near room temp. This beer is too good to rush through anyway.

T- Big malt start to it that gives way to the hop profile. Sweet almost toffee malt flavor and floral/herbal hops. Lot of bitterness on the finish with a sweet malt balance along side it.  M- Big beer with moderate cabonation. Not very boozy but there is a nice warming to it that comes out after about half of it is gone.

Sticky lace lines the glass. and very good head retention holds through all pours. S: Very high levels of hops, with a nice malt undertone, but very hoppy. A aroma that shows a beer needs to be enjoyed now, but needs some time to develop. T/M:The front is a malt heavy blast that gives way to a long and well planned flavor profile. This goes into a very hoppy brew, a warm middle balances the hoppy dry after tones of a strong IPA. This is a different brew than I have had it before. The overall intensity is medium to high for the abv in this brew. Not too much boozy character, but can wait to see this brew develop. D: As we would say in the beer shop I used to work in, ""If I cover for you and work a double you owe me a double bastard. Ah, such a reward for a double shift. One of the most drinkable brews for being a double, strong ale. Hidden abv and a nice easy drinking approach. A nice brew I could have on draft in the home unit.

S - Whoa a malty Stone beer. Huge amounts of sweet, caramel, toasted malt, toffee, maybe even a raisin or two. It just screams: Red ale. After more huffing, I can now get some floral hopping.  T - Starts off malty, very innocent. Boom, the comes in a super strong malt profile of caramel and a boat load of floral hopping. Bitterness takes over - for this malt bill is insane. stays somewhat balanced through the finish, sticky, more caramel and toffee. A huge huge beer.  M - Strong body, moderate carbonation. All results in a very full bodied beer. Somewhat stingy on the carbonation at times. Beer is overall very heavy. Huge oily finish on the tongue.  D - I don't know how to define drinkability on this beer. It is frightening. It will hurt you. The Bastard is already scary, this is doubly scary. A bit cloying at times, not very filling , a bit too over the top - probably how i would take it. Share this beer - please.  This is one lacerative mother of an ale - bottle quote.

It's a tad intimidating, having a full bomber of such a strong beer to finish yourself, with the two menacing gargoyles staring back at you. But I think I am worthy.  Poured into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass directly out of the fridge a beautiful dark orange. Very nice tan head made up of lots of tiny carbonated bubbles.  Smells of hops and candied sugar right away. A tad smoky in aroma.  Tastes initially of hop bitterness, with some smooth sweetness on the middle, then finally the harsh sharpness on the back end. You really start to feel the alcohol burn after you swallow. Flavors a mix of tangerine and pine, with light tobacco and even a little butterscotch. The sweetness really shines thru after it warms a bit.  It's interesting, this was one of the first craft beers I ever had, way before my palate was prepared for this. I remember describing it at liquid razor blades back then. Now it tastes almost sweet to me. It's amazing how things change.  This beer never disappoints. Stone is consistently one of the most solid breweries out there. I can always buy a Stone product and never be worried it is a waste of money. This is always a great option for me.

It leaves some nice gloopy lace on my glass as a slowly savor this brew.  The aroma is a head on collision between bright piney citrus hops and rich caramel malts. Dark caramel, toffee, candied fruit and some booze mingle with grapefruit, orange and dank pine. Definitely a big smelling beer.  The malt edges out the hops a bit more in the flavor. The predominant character is that of rich candied fruit and caramel malts. There is also a hint of toffee and a bit of brown sugariness. This beer also possesses, of course, a pretty solid dose of citrus and piney hops, and a serious amount of bitterness that leaves a bit of a dank cannabis like finish after swallowing.  The mouthfeel is on the fullest edge of medium, but is not what I would call full. It is a bit sticky after swallowing, but smooth going down.  It took me awhile to finish this glass and I was glad to share the bomber. That being said, I was not expecting this to be super drinkable and I was looking for an abrasive beer and got it. This is a great one to warm up to on a winter night, especially when sharing it with friends.

I decided to treat myself to some Double Bastard Ale for my birthday, you know, because I figured the good people at Stone would now how to humble a guy and entertain him on a lazy birthday! Somehow I feel more awake...  Anyways, the beer comes in a bomber with TWO fiendish looking gargoyles on the cover and a diatribe about how I don't deserve to drink this beer. So I told them to ""Suck it"" and proceeded to drink it anyway. The brew pours a murky golden brown with a head the doesn't give a $%@#.  The aroma has hints of pine, carmel, malts, hazlenut, and a hint of honey-bourbon. The flavor hits you like a ton of bricks, although tempered slightly by the light carbonation. This beer is going to take you on a rocky ride whether you like it or not - I can't even pin down all the flavors coming at my palate. There's a buttery overtone with strong hop-citrus, balance by thicker malt flavor for balance...and surely a host of other flavors.

Reviewed from notes and so the journey begins...  A- A deep reddish brown almost a mahogany color with a nice medium sized off-white/tan head. Good amount of carb that dissipates the head quickly. Surprising that there is that much carb in such a large bottle, but I guess that's what makes it a bastard.  S- Very surprising that a strong ale has that much of a pungent citrus smell, but we are talking about Stone those bastards. As it continues to warm the familiar sweet malts come out and are very soothing to inhale. A little more warming and I can pick up some faint and subtle piney hop smell melding with the citrusy over tone. I am also picking up some sugary perhaps brown sugar from the malts. Very enjoyable.  T- A well concocted strong ale, that finds a great balance with the citrus and grapefruit nuances up front and a little sweet, brown sugar finish. Has a slight warming from the high abv, but no burn like one would expect. Some continued sipping brings more of the sweetness in the finish, but also allows the hop profile to build up in the initial taste. Very nice and enjoyable.  M- A nice and viscous strong ale that borders on chewy. The abv warmth contributes in the feel as well with an almost syrupy feel. The carb is lively, but not overwhelming very mellow and smooth.  D- Definitely especially in bomber format, but the 3 liter is a must share it is simply a big double bastard. Seriously you need two hands to pour it. The bottle has a lock and key for christ's sake. A very nice balance of hops and malts that hides the alcohol well. Dangerous bastard I would say.  A great offering from Stone that gets better each year. Keep those aggressive bastards coming!

There's a bit of a hop bite at first, and then it moves to a sweet, rich malt taste, caramel, butterscotch.

This is another solid beer from Stone and I look forward to aging one of these to see how it'll taste down the road.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,machostacos,3.93,"Poured from chilled 2010 release bomber into a tulip glass. Bottle shows an ABV of 11.2%.  A: Gorgeous clear deep reddish mahogany with a tight half-inch head that shrinks down to a thin film and ring that grips the glass. Nice think lacing. Just a beautiful looking beer.  S: Smells of lovely dark sticky fruits, sweet malt with a decidedly Belgian quality (almost like a Quad) - no real perceivable hop character, though I suppose I'm detecting a very slight piny resinous component. Very rich and inviting, with a touch of booze that stings the nose. Chomping at the bit to give this a taste.  T: Flavor isn't as complex as the nose, unfortunately, though it's still quite tasty. Lots of that Belgian-esque fruity quality up front with a very slight chocolaty flavor, followed by a little bit of alcohol burn with a short, slightly dry and bitter finish. The alcohol is quite well-hidden for being 11.2% ABV, which can certainly lead to trouble if you're not careful. Not as complex as the rich aroma would suggest, but certainly no slouch either.  M: Quite viscous, not much carbonation. Very sticky on the lips. I love thick, rich beers, and this is near-perfection for my taste.  D: 11.2% ABV alone kinda kills the drinkability of this one. The flavor isn't heavy enough to really overwhelm the palate, and thus doesn't become cloying or unpleasant, and therefore would be much more conducive to enjoying on a larger scale if not for the ABV. I'm a big guy and I'm definitely feeling it after a pint, so 1 or 2 would certainly be plenty. A shame, really, since it's so damned tasty.  A fantastic brew that I would certainly pick up again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,pants678,2.69,"All kinds of cloudy with an eggshell head, body is an orangish brown sugar color.  Weak aroma of orange and peppermint.  A boozy quad is what it comes off as initially. There would be a very clean finish were it not for the soapy alcohol. A grainy cinnamon, pine base holds up tinges of grapefruit with an offsetting mint with the strongest hops. I can't help but sip at it, the alcohol is too much.  Little heavier than medium bodied. The creamy texture seems off-base, but not problematic. A Belgian kind of smooth carbonation. Still, not at all easy-going.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Has a one finger off white head that leaves fair lacing and turns into a little ring around the glass.  S - Smells of booze and hops. Lots of alcohol comes first followed by grapefruit, orange and lemon zest, and some pine. Some light sweetness going on as well.  T - Tastes of booze first and foremost. Lots of dark fruits come after with a big burst of carmely malts. Very complex. I just wish the alcohol was toned down a tad so that the dark fruits would come through more.  M - Mouthfeel is pretty heavy. Medium amount of carbonation. Mouthfeel is nice for this beer. I enjoy this part the most out of the brew.  D - You definitely feel the alcohol percentage on this beer.

Fades slowly to some bubbly film, leaving spots of lacing around the glass.  Some bitter hops in the nose with a flair of booziness, pine, toasted caramel, and a bit of fruit sweetness with citrus.  A nice dose of bitterness up front, giving way to dark fruit sweetness including raisins, cherries, and dates. A burly malt backbone dominates the middle of the beer with some bready and caramel qualities. A light touch of grapefruit citrus is also apparent. Finishes long, crisp, and with a nice splash of alcohol warmth.  Fuller body, but very smooth and easy on the tongue. Carbonation is lighter, and even though this is still boozy, its not quite as hot as I expected.

Brown sugar, butterscotch, cherry; caramelized malt gone wild. But don't worry, there's plenty of hop bitterness too (this is Stone after all). Spicy and floral with notes of citrus. Warming alcohol on the finish.  Rich, sticky, full bodied.  One of the more balanced beers Stone makes. That said, it quite rich and a little sweet and I don't think I could have more than a glass. Maybe I just don't like the flavor profile, maybe this is just too much sweet caramel malt for me, but I do not love this beer. I can appreciate that it is a quality brew, but its just not for me and I have to say, I am a little surprised by how high this beer rates.

147,1056,Jmoore50,4.08,"Did a five year vertical of 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. My personal preference put the 2009 first, 2006 second, 2010 third, 2008 fourth, and 2007 last.  We started with the 2006 first and we worked our way to the most recent version. All of the versions have a great amber color that gets darker towards the heart of the beer. The most recent versions own a very fluffy white head that actually sticks around for awhile. The 2006 version had the viscosity of honey, every vintage just resembled oil more and more the older it was. The older vintages had thick, wine like legs that were beautiful.  The smell of the 2006 was of incredibly sweet malts, light alcoholic booze, honey, and belgian candy sugar. I should just say that the 2006 and 2007 versions just smelled like booze and sugar. The 2009 and 2010 versions had more hop presence in it, and I would have to say the hops start to develop into an almost fruit punch smell in later vintages. One thing I did notice is that the alcohol booze smell is a very strong character in all of the vintages. The hops died out, the malts and biscuit flavors developed into sweet candy sugar, booze stays the entire way.  I love the fresh hops that are in the 2010 version, but I also love the almost 'liquor' characters that the 2006 has. Like I said in the smell category, this is probably more accurately described as a barleywine, not only because it fits the general characters of the style but it also ages like one. It owns a very strong hop character when fresh, and that fades pretty fast. What a really great beer that is such a great candidate for aging.  The mouthfeel of this one gets better with aging. The early vintages does have a great hop bitterness with the malty sweetness, but with age this develops a more oily character and for me becomes more enjoyable. Really glad that this one finally came together and I was able to enjoy it with some great friends.  J",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Had with regular AB, OAB and Lukcy in this order: AB --&gt; OAB --&gt; Lukcy --&gt; DB This review is brief but I didn't find much difference in character of this one and AB, except for the strength.  Appearance 5/5 Dark ruby and rusty, with the clarity and depth of molten lava. Big brown head, great retention and lacing.  Aroma 4/5 Pine, citrus and caramel rule. Strangely, not as strong smelling as I thought it would be.  Taste 4/5 Strongly bittersweet. Very sweet compared to other bastards but more bitter as well. Seems like an American Barleywine except that it's much more close to AB than any other beer. Caramel notes are present but it's mostly the hop flavor that dominates. Finish is quite clean given the amount of malts in this ale.  Mouthfeel 5/5 Viscous, thick, coating and overwhelming with low carbonation. Spot on.  Drinkability 5/5 Very good, given the ABV.

147,1056,Foxtrot,4.55,"Double Bastard is one of those beers that I look forward to every year. Double Bastard was one of those beers that really opened up the perception about beer pushing the envelope of what is considered ""normal"". Not to mention that it tastes pretty fraking amazing.  2010 Release pours into my IRS snifter with an abundance of off white foam with tight bubbles and good retention overall. Hue is just the most incredible ruby red.Lacing was pretty superb as well, with spider-like webbing all around the glass that should last the entire session.  The nose was, for a lack of better vocabulary, incredible. Malty caramel is the most obvious aroma to discern, along with undertones of toffee and brown sugar on the sweat end. The hops play really well with the intense malt character, giving it a nice aroma of candied pineapple and pine sap. I also get some cherry aroma's as well; not a whole lot but just enough to hide in the background.  The taste is just a open handed smack to the face! And I like it quite a bit. This beer is on the extreme of both ends of the spectrum. Incredibly malty and sweat, but very bitter and pungent all at once. Robust caramel and brown sugar caress the palate along with a huge dose of piney and herbal hops, along with subtle flavors of figs, and candied pineapple. Finishes bitter but fades to a very welcoming malty presence with some heat. It's a 11.2% ABV beer with no age, so it was to be expected.  Mouthfeel really takes the cake with this bad boy of a brew. Velvety, creamy, silky, milkshake and delicious. The incredible mouthfeel is what adds to this beers flavor and savoring capabilities.  Drinkability is much better than I remembered, goes down pretty easy but this beer is meant to be savored over the course of a hour, perhaps 2. Some burn but I expect some age to take that edge off.

S - This brew smells absolutely incredible! Strong on the malts as well as hops. Lots of fruits, caramel and piney notes in the nose.  T - Its potent, that's for sure. For having such a high ABV, this was very smooth. Really big on the fruits and malts and a very nice hop finish that begs for more.  M - Nice full bodied feel that coats the mouth.

T - Opens super smooth, in a way that lends a good bit of anticipation for the flavor profile. Alcohol is the first character to the party, slowly building and warming your mouth. Touch of milk chocolate, lots of medium toast, some brown sugar, dried dates. It reminds me a lot of a lighter Belgium quad. Hops are the star of the middle profile, showing up with woody cedar and smoky bitters, and stay there through the aftertaste.  M - Fantastic. Incredibly smooth. The alcohol isn't hidden but it isn't sharp on your palate either. The mouthfeel gets even better as it warms.

147,1056,SolomonGrundy,3.8,"After watching CAL's football season implode in an unfortunate 16-13 loss to U-Dub, this pur-tick-uh-ler ale seems right lucky to be around my fridge...  Pours a gorgeous red-amber, emphasis on the red. Lightly carbonated. Poured oily and thick so I suspect it's sweet and high in alcohol. Yup, 11% ABV per the bottle. About a finger of tan head crowns this brew, and it dwindles away into the night, slowly but surely, until only the lace accompanies the glass. Huge, sweet robust aromas: Pecan pie, brown sugar, pineapple, all backed by a heavy, crisp hop component. Pretty good thus far. As expected, flavor is enormous: Tons of hops carries from initial burst of flavor all the way through to the long, bitter end. This beer is like old school XXX movies: it's wasn't just thrown together by a couple guys with $10,000, a few jars of vaseline and some high school chicks. It has been crafted to be as good as it can, but it's still completely hardcore and not for everyone. If I had to put a name to it, it'd be like Randy West...look him up, young 'uns...The intro is big, but not nearly as big as some others...However, it's the middle that counts: it's devastating. Almost too much going on at once. It pounds you ""with an almost seizure-like intensity"" (thank you Scott & J.R.), and you think it's too much to handle. It's hops, malt, burned brown sugar, hops, more hops, then some more burned sugar, finished with some hops and malt. This shoots into the finish, which is at once both hoppy and REALLY hoppy. Not easy drinking, and not cheap at $6.49/bomber. You'd have to be as godlike as Mr. West himself to handle sessions of this evil brew.  What I like most: The massive flavor explosion in your mouth.  What I like least: The price and lack of nuance.

The toffee and biscuit that were present in the nose really come forward in the finish of the taste. I really enjoy these notes coming through a bit more.

Smell: as I first pour it cold from the bottle, I detect the rich caramel flavor that I have come to associate with Double Bastard's syrupy predecessors.  Taste: Rich caramel from the malt hits first, with wholegrain tasting malts showing through in the finish. These flavors are complimented by a solid alcohol presence and a finishing appearance of hops to round out the footprint for a well balanced beer.  Mouthfeel: Syrupy and thick with too much carbonation added to balance it out. It warms the mouth, and the beer reveals layers of flavor with each sip.  Drinkability: This beer packs a lot of things into a bottle, and does each of them well.

147,1056,TKEbeerman,4.42,"Let me preface this review with saying I've been waiting a while for the perfect time to review this brew. I'll be reviewing the '09 Vintage (1 year of age presently), and throwing in comparisons of what I remember when it was fresh, and comparisons from drinking the '10 one night ago.  A: Poured into my pint glass, this ASA pours a murky caramel orange with a one inch thick head that has an orange tone to it. Considering that regular Bastard has one of the best looking pours in the beer world, Double Bastard misses the mark just a bit.  S: With one year of age, this brew is still loaded with the piny sticky hops that it was brewed with. Booze and rustic oxidation begin to poke through more. The caramel malt background chimes in, but not as heavy as a fresh 2010.  T: Just like I've heard, this brew is excellent with one year of age. Fresh, DB09 was LOADED with hops....I mean extreme. It was more bitter then some DIPA. Now the hops are still very much present, but mix perfectly with the caramel malt and notes of toffee and brown sugar. 2010 drinks more like a barleywine, and has half of the hops that DB09 had fresh. Actually DB10 was still less hoppy then DB09 aged, which I didn't like. Booze also poke through more on that one (considering the higher ABV).  MF: Mouthfeel is surprisingly refreshing. Sticky hops stick to the back of your pallet. Alcohol leaves a slight burn on the finish.  D: Drinkability is good, and improves with age. Can't wait to see how DB10 ages out.  Overall, I prefer DB09 to this years release, but I already can't wait until 2011.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,Mancer,4.37,"This beer poured a red amber color with a two finger high, off-white head. The head dissipated fairly rapidly, and not much lacing was left on the glass. The initial smell of the beer was that of pine, spices, citrus and some dark fruity notes. The initial taste of the beer is pine, spice and dark fruits. This progressed to some burnt malts, possibly caramel. Additionally, there is a taste of the alcohol, which is more apparent after the first several sips. The beer has a full body with light carbonation.  Overall, this is a great beer. However, I'm not sure if I enjoy it more than regular Arrogant Bastard. There is more booze flavoring on the tongue than I would prefer, but I can't complain about the other flavors I'm tasting.

Taste is slightly bitter, a little caramel, alcohol, and some dark fruits. Seems almost plummy and grapey.  Mouthfeel is good, just as expected.  Drinkability is lowered because of the alcohol taste.

Sweet and lightly boozy aroma of toffee and a mix of spice and piney hops.  Moderate carbonation and a heavy, sticky mouthfeel. Huge biscuit and toffee malt backbone with a hint of raisin. Immediate hop kick that progresses from mild spice and pine to a tart citrus on the puckering finish.  The high alcohol only adds a warming note on the finish, but the heaviness of this brew makes it a definite sipper. The hop presence, while not overly bitter, is intense enough to keep the sweetness in check.

Malts asserts itself in the middle with mainly carmels and pale malts. Very dry and slick/sticky finish from the agressively bitter hop finish. Medium to full body with modest carbonation.  Overall this beer is not for the faint of heart, when it's fresh at least. If you are a hop monster and want a big boy check this guy out.

After that i'm hit with an ample amount of hops(not too much) and a tart apple/slight alcohol finish.  Mouthfeel is syrupy and low in carbonation.

The head is substantial in stature and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of alcohol, malts, and toffee. The hop character of the beer has faded during the aging process, so I am not detecting any of the fruit, hop, pineapple, or citrus flavors I have been told are well associated with Double Bastard Ale.

There is toasty and bready malts, some fruitiness coming through as some plums and dark cherries (these are faint), some fairly dark caramels and lots of hops bitterness and flavor. The finish leaves some caramel and lingering hop flavors with a nice hop bitterness balancing everything out. The hop flavors are very unique in this beer, not much of the typical West Coast citrus and fruit going on, it's more of a woody, minty aroma and flavor which reminds me of a California Common beer. In fact overall this beer makes me think of an imperial California Common ale (see Anchor Steam Beer).  Mouthfeel is full bodied with above average carbonation, it coats the entire mouth with flavors.  Overall this beer is quite delicious, I very much enjoyed drinking it.

Subtle smells but not flavor POW... starts off leading with a softly sweet milky caramel and moves to a slowly and increasingly bitter mid palate of resiny goodness.

Hops make up the finish with lots of citrusy flavors and a nice bitterness to round it all out.  Mouthfeel is chewy and thick. Overall, Stone has another quality brew here.

Strong citrus hops and strong sweet caramel malts. Is that a hint of roast!? Smells much deeper and more complex than the regular Bastard.  T - Starts right out with thick malts which are not nearly as sweet as they smell, very much still present though. Also very robust hop-wise, however it seems more toned down than the regular Bastard, probably due to the higher malt bill. Slightly peppery and medicinal too. There is a weird roastiness that reminds me of barbecue or steak sauce.  M - Fairly heavy in body, but pretty highly carbonated which may make it seem less-so. Likes to linger.  D - Definitely a bastard. I can do a bomber and that's about it. This stuff is so strong in flavor and booze that it's a treat only on occasion.  11/3/2013 3-Year Update  This beer has aged beautifully! The aggressive nature of this beer is tamed way down and the alcohol has dialed itself back. The heat is still there, just more subtle.

Immediately, the taste of oily pine resin hoppiness shows up to greet the taste buds....there's a sweet malt undercurrent there as well that takes second place to the bitterness. The hops stay bitter long into the finish and aftertaste with a bit of an astringent quality. The alcohol also is somewhat noticeable on the finish as well, which isn't a huge surprise given the ABV.  This beer is a lot like the original AB, except it's just bigger in every way and it's more slanted towards the hops.

I mostly get the malt and booze. There are also some hints of fruit and hops in there as well.  The taste is dominated by the malt and the alcohol like the aroma is. Its not as hoppy as Arrogant Bastard is by any means and definitely was not as bitter, so its a very sweet beer. There are also hints of fruit. It strangely tastes more like a barley wine than Arrogant Bastard.  The mouthfeel is that its very full bodied. The 10.5% ABV definitely is noticeable and I think that's what Stone was going for with this one.  Drinkability wise, its very easy to drink despite the forwardness of the alcohol because of how sweet it is. I had to pace myself purposefully to take it slow and enjoy this beer.  Overall, I really liked this beer. I had been unable to find it when it came out but happened upon a bottle of it while buying other beer in a local store so I knew I had to pick it up. It is very good and I'll be stocking up on bottles to age if I find any new ones in the future. It was definitely worth the wait and proves why Stone Brewing remains my favorite brewery.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,cjacobsen,4.2,"22 oz bottle into a pint glass  Had 2006, 2007 and 2009 versions  Pours a dark reddish brown color with a medium to thin beige head on it that stays throughout the drinking of the brew.  The smell was of roasted malt, hops and alcohol.  The taste was strong, bold and upfront with aromas of hops and roasted malt. The alcohol has thinned out and melded well with the rest of the flavors in the 06 but the separation could be noted from the 06 to the 07 and then much stronger in the 09. The 09 boasts a 10.5% ABV while the 06 and 07 were straight 10%. Aging this beer does very well if done correctly.  The mouthfeel differed from the years. The 06 was smoother than you'd normally expect from a Bastard but it still had that spicy bit to it from the Belgian yeast strand and alcohol. The 09 was more aggressive on the palette but didn't put off the will to drink.  This beer means business. I'm a fan of the Arrogant Bastard and this bigger brother makes a decent mark. Can't have too many of these but a must try.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,bohemiandonut,3.81,"2009 version.  Perfect for my Peanuts era Welch's mini-jar.  Nice and creamy ecru head, murky orange caramel body. Head could be thicker but for the style it's not bad. Swirls up readily. Label and artwork on the bottle get this an A++.  Smells and feels like a Stone heavy-hitter. Stone hops amidst boozy caramel with notes of roasted malts. The hints of chocolate and coffee add a nice depth to what is a mostly toffee/caramelized-orange-peel concoction. Can't help but wish there was a bit more chocolate. Bit of anise in there too. A lot to ponder over.  Tastes like all of the above. I can't help treating this like a barleywine, though it's supposed to be an Arrogant Bastard hybrid. Either way, this ale would be just fan-fuckin-tastic if it were oaked or -baled to any extent. That Bastardly bitterness comes on late and careful with its spartan hops and bourbony-sweet thickness.  This doesn't quite blow me away as for the style (or ""Strong Ale""), but it certainly fills out the Stone lineup nicely. For a single drink I would probably look elsewhere. With a bit of mellowing, again, this could be an exceptionally out-of-this world beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,TCHopCraver,4.5,"Reviewed from notes on 8-6-10.  A: Pours a dirty, murky brown-amber into my snifter. A medium pour yields a tiny head that leaves behind a clumpy, long lasting beige film that cover the majority of the beer. The carbonation bubbles mosey at a medium march. A parabolic arch of lacing is left behind with each sip, which breaks into dots and snaky lines. This beer looks mysterious.  S: A thick, musty caramel malt scent is the biggest player in the smell play. This is very sweet smelling with some raisin, fig, and plum notes also prominent. A banana breadiness is also climbing into my nose, along with a slight citrus hop presence. DB smells huge and delicious and it makes me very excited to drink it.  T: Musty, sweet caramel malts are also the dominant taste, but there is an earthy hop bitterness accompanying the malts that I did not pick up in the smell. This hop presence certainly does not balance the sweetness, but it does add a wonderful cleansing of the palate at the finale of each pull. The raisin, plum, fig, and banana bread notes that I found in the smell add a nice complexity to the overall taste and round out a big and phenomenal beer.  M: DB is creamy and full bodied with an appropriate hop bite at the finish. The sweetness really coats the palate with a nice film and then the hop cleansing dries off the film nicely.  D: Well, it took me the better part of two hours to drink this behemoth, so I'm not sure how ""drinkable"" is really is, but do know this: it's damned good and I really enjoyed exploring its nuances.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Spica66,4.38,"2009 Release - 22 oz bottle poured into tulip.  Got this as an extra from GoGriz. Thanks, Cody!  A: Very dark amber, thick-looking pour. Light khaki head with excellent formation and retention. Very nice looking in the glass!  S: Strong is the first word that comes to mind. Strong maltiness, strong sugar, strong hops (sort of earthy smell to the hops). Quite a pleasant assault on the nose!  T: Wow! Very intense flavors. Roasted malts, caramel, slightly fruity. Hops give a really strong show on the aftertaste. This beer reminds me of NOTHING that I have ever had before!  M: Full-bodied, creamy, smooth. The 10.5% shows itself, but you don't seem to notice because your tongue is using every bit of your available brain power trying to process the wonderful taste overload...  D: This bottle disappeared so fast that it should come with a warning not to have more than one in the house at a time.

147,1056,infi,4.14,"2008 release, 22 oz. bomber. Shared with BA brun.  Poured into a tumbler.  Pours a murky brown-red color that releases a tan/light brown head that slowly dissipates to a thin and loosely bubbled cap, with little to no lacing on the glass. Smell is immensely malty with a strong and sugary dark fruitiness towards the back-end. Huge candied sugared aromas, which overpowers any hoppy presence in the aroma. Something notably new, especially compared to regular Arrogant Bastard.  Taste is initially sweet and malty, but then ends on a huge earthy and piney bitterness from the hops. Truly double the hops and malts in every aspect. The bitterness is especially notable in the flavor profile. The 10.5% is quite noticeable in every sip too. As the glass warms, the fruitiness and candied sugars become even more prominent and the hop bitterness becomes a bit more muted and less as prevalent towards the end. Quite an experience for a monster beer.  Mouthfeel is beautifully smooth and full-bodied, considerably more than original AB. Considerable bitterness towards the end, but not too overpowering. Drinkability is a bit moderate, especially for how bitter and boozy it is. It might be rough for some people and yet desirable for others. A totally different monster from AB. Really worth a try nonetheless.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Yoonisaykul,4.35,"2008 release purchased aged.  A- Good size yellow brownish head. Slight reddish hue to the muddy light ice-coffee brown liquid. Big patches of lace with holes in them look like skulls.  S- Seems tamer or just like Arrogant Bastard. Some chocolate raisin, pine and grapefruit. Candied fruit and caramel. Like a chocolate covered maraschino cherry.  T- Oh,okay. I get the Double now. I would've liked more but this is pretty rough. These are some tough hops. Very intense making it hard for me to concentrate and pick out all the flavors. Here is what I managed to get: Great but strong alcohol taste no matter the temperature. Pine and grapefruit rind. Lots of malt, that counters more than it balances. Is this a hop bomb or a malt bomb? Both but, I think, in the end, the hop aroma and bitterness are what you remember.  M- Medium to high carbonation. Full bodied. Sticky. You can feel the tingly numbness on your lips from the hop oils, minutes after your last sip.  D- A real treat. A DIPA blast combined with RIS fullness and satisfaction. For how rough this is, drinkablity is amazing. I want more.  A super beer. Super satisfying. Obviously some people won't like this because of how busy it is but I recommend it to all. Even if you don't like it, it'll be quite the experience... just don't pour it down the drain... pass it on to a friend instead.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,BeerFMAndy,4.05,"22 oz bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada imperial pint. 10.5% ABV, Age at Cellar temp (55°F) or below. 2009 Release.  Thanks to sweemzander for this bottle!  A - DB pours out quietly with some viscosity. Hazy brown amber in color, it's topped by a dense light khaki head with great retention and minor patchy lace clinging to the glass.  S - Double the bastard, double the malts I suppose. This one is both a hop and malt bomb. Tons of gooey caramel and toasted dense bread make up the heavy amber malt nose. Lots of earthy hops come though in support as well. Decently balanced and really strong.  T - What a punch in the mouth even at about a year old. Thick roasted amber malts, sticky caramel, and dense bread really come out strong with an almost minor dark fruity alcohol kick to it. No booziness but the alcohol is definitely there. Strong earthy and floral bitter hops kick the end into high gear.  M - Massively full-bodied and rich with a smooth and throat-coating viscosity, the alcohol isn't so much tasted as it is felt in the finish that's got a lot of warming sensation. Largely bitter and sharp too, the mouthfeel of Double Bastard is pretty complex.  D - Still drinkable for how rich it is, this strong ale is double the bastard to you when the bottle is finished I'm sure. A nice beer with good profiles going on here.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Hues of amber, copper & rust. One finger head dissipates to a patch of bubbles & a thin skim around it. Swirling congers some bubbles but retention is thin. Some initial lacing but it's gone by the end.  Robust malt aromas; toffee & caramel upfront with hints of candied malts & darker sugars. Brown sugar notes & hints of molasses. Candied fruit undertones. Faint earthy notes, too. Not particularly hoppy.  Hops are more appreciable to taste than in the nose. Moderate piney bitterness upfront that leads into an intense malt profile that is strikingly similar to the nose - lots of toffee, caramel, brown sugar & candied malts. More sweet than bitter but not drastically disproportionate. Faint notions of fresh baked sweet & dark breads.  Full bodied with moderately low carbonation. Ample amount of resiny grit - very nice. Toasted & burnt malts linger on the finish with a touch of bitterness.  Bold? Yes. Intense? Sure. ""Sublime extacy?"" I don't know if I'd go that far.

The beer is a nice dark red color with a huge tan head. The head thins, but sticks around and leaves a bit of lacing.  Big Sweet malt fills the aroma, there's carmel and dark fruits. It ends with some pine aroma from the hops. The flavor starts off sweet malty and viscous, matching the aroma, and it's followed by huge hop flavor and bitterness. Lots of pine comes through and the bitterness is strong. After that it dries right up. The alcohol is well hidden. The carbonation is moderately low and fits well with the beer.

Not cloying from the sweetness, but it does coat the mouth with the taste lingering for at least a full minute. Nice hop bitterness as the sensation fades!

147,1056,brewerburgundy,4,"22oz bottle, Sam Adams glass, 2009 vintage.  This long awaited drink is a slightly hazed woody and deep amber. When poured it looked nearly still and then was able to develop swirls of the very standard off-white.  The nose is loaded with butter, there must be some diacetyl in play. In fact butter pretty much makes up the olfactory side of things. Sweet malt, alcohol, citrus zest are also present in trace amounts. Maybe a bit of pine.  Hops are more evident in the flavor; orange, grapefruit pith and zest, lemon pith. There's the butter again, this time coming off more butterscotch or toffee-like (diacetyl). As promised there is copious alcohol; it caresses rather than burns and emphasizes the sizable rough hop bitterness. I can see potential here and may wish I had another 2009 bottle.  There isn't much carbonation, probably to the Double Bastard's benefit, and the weight in the mouth is truly syrupy.  I've worked this first glass down quite quickly and I'm surprised I'm not really feeling it.

147,1056,CaptYellow,4.65,"I love this beer. I tried it without high expectations. I got it while traveling to share with a friend. It was great. $6 a bomber. I'll happily buy it again. Drinkability was high for me. Not only did I finish it wanting more and looking forward to buying it again, I drank it quickly. Being that I'm a sipper and take forever on any beer, it's drinkability is exceptional. It is 10.5% so, of course, a person who drinks quickly might be limited.  Mouthfeel was medium-heavy. Very malty sweetness. Bitterness evident in the taste and particularly in the aftertaste. A pleasant find was butter in the taste. The alcohol was evident in the best possible way- it had a warming taste to it and I felt my face get warm like it does from alcohol. The only other flavor I'd claim to have tasted was caramel.  This reminded me of Rogue's Old Crustacean.  Not the best beer I've ever had, but it is tops in my book and for a fair price with good availability. A definite recommend and remember.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,emagana,4.3,I've seen this one just about everywere I go now. Finally decided to try and rate. Pours thick and has a lingering head. Dark brown in complexity with plenty of carbonation showing. There is a sweet malty aroma with hint of hops. I also get hint of leather and mushrooms. Starts off sweet on the pellet and wham you get hit with the hops and the alcohol. In a good way. Taste like a barly wine.

Settles to a nice layer of foam with wonderful off-white lacing that lasted from start to finish. Another beautiful beer from Stone.  S: Very rich & sticky-sweet smelling.... I'm getting molasses, dark fruit and a load of hops. Just a touch of alcohol.  T: Sweet molasses right up front, followed up quickly by bitter hops. Both flavors are very strong... aftertaste is on the bitter side. There is also some alcohol heat floating around.  M: Med to heavy bodied. Smooth and buttery feel, warming effect throughout.

S - Rich caramel and butterscotch along with a large amount of fruity aroma (apple, cherry, and citrus fruits). Strong amount of floral, citrus and pine hops.  T - Strong caramel and brown sugar malt base. Big hop presence consisting of floral, citrus and pine hops that are extremely strong given the age. Nice fruity liqueur type presence with citrus and cherry along with some apple flavor. Alcohol comes out a bit as well. Great mix of hoppy bitterness and caramel malt sweetness.  M - Medium to full body with a little less than average carbonation. Fairly creamy and smooth.  D - Great balance (don't know how it would be fresh) between sweet and bitter. ABV is a little high but it is a pretty drinkable beer given what it is.  Notes: Vintage 2007.

I owe you one Rob! Bottle states 2009 release.  Pours a murky ass reddish hue with a finger of yellowish head which dies to a collar.  Piney and citric hops buffet your nostrils first and they are followed by a bold caramel biscuit malt. Bloatloads of hops and malt join together with almost vodka-ish fusel alcohol and a touch of roast to make one hell of nose.  This is the kind of beer that, rather than caressing you and pleasing you, bitch slaps you from the get go. This is a huge beer that drinks huge. Loads of caramel maltiness, slight fruitiness with a hint of spice and earth, a touch of cocoa, biscuit, raisins. This meets a truck full of citric and piney hops which provide a harsh bitterness in the finish, which coupled with the alcohol leaves a harsh parting gift. Creamy mouthfeel with just enough bubbles to cut the syrupy-ness.  This is barleywine meets the massive hop attack of an American Strong Ale. Hard to see this as drinkable though I imagine with some significant time in the cellar it might be. You can see the genius in the melding of such mass quantities of malt and hops but at this point it's still too rough, unbalanced and just plain ol' brutish for me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S: Intense smell. Some grape, caramel, toast, and citrus.  T: Very strong flavors that are fairly well balanced, though the scale leans more toward the hops. As the name implies, this is an intensified version of a regular arrogant bastard. Almost as if they took a six pack of arrogant bastard and distilled it into a bomber. Specific flavors I got were lemons, caramel, some booziness, and a lot of bitter hops in the finish.  M: Smooth, but somewhat under carbonated in my opinion.  D: I enjoyed trying this beer, but to me, the overall sum was not as good as the pieces. Most likely a one and done.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

A-A brooding, hazy amber tulip stares back at me with a rocky one finger head that hangs around for quite a while and left tons of sticky lace all the way down.  S-Rich, sweet caramel malt greets my olfactory senses. Following up are citrus and pine hop notes, a slight whiff of booze, some dark cherries and brown sugar. Man, there is a lot here. Some of it I just can't put my finger on.  T-Sweet caramel malt leads followed by a swift bitter kick to the taste buds by some piney hops. The malt and hops are battling for supremacy with neither one prevailing. Both are intense, pleasurable and unrelenting. The brown sugar and dark cherries from the nose are lingering around. A bit boozy, yet I can't call it hot. A faint whiskey like flavor coats the palate on the finish. Exceptional. Just exceptional.  M-Full bodied and sticky, it coats the palate thoroughly. Very chewy. Almost a meal in itself.  D-I ordered another even before I had finished the glass. Its a big beer for sure, but its so enjoyable and complex, it begs another go round.  I love this beer.

147,1056,devilben02,3.72,"The color out of the bottle is a glorious reddish-copper with a fizzy half-inch head. The aroma is bursting with hops, with notes of grapefruit and pine being most prominent. The flavor is likewise overflowing with hop bitterness, eliciting the feeling of eating a ripe grapefruit at a small table in the middle of a pine forest after a rainstorm. Not content to just be a hop bomb, though, this one also has a substantial malt backbone, with big flavors of caramel and toffee.  Nicely carbonated and having a texture that is oily but also somewhat creamy, it should go down smooth, but it is just overwhelming. Although the alcohol is certainly present and noticeable, especially as the beer warms, the booziness is not the biggest obstacle to drinkability. Rather, it is the combination of big hop bitterness, dense malt sweetness, and the high alcohol that just overloads the palate. I thought I liked big flavors as much as the next guy, but the abundance of everything packed into the Double Bastard is just too much.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Some sticky lacing on the side of the glass lingers. Good carbonation on the brew  S- before I can get the glass up to my face, that signature American Strong Ale scent fills my nostrils. There is a powerful presense of earthy hops and a sweet malt presense. That malt is very, very smokey as well. The alcohol is barely cloaked by the extreme malt profile. The is a slight brown sugar scent as well  T- yeah I like this... a ""jacked up"" AmStrAle that has that blend of hops and malt. The beginning taste has a sweet malt wave that has some smokey malt flavoring. There is some sweetness intertwined with the brew. The same earthy hops that were originally smelt are contained in the brew. There is some bitterness as well. I have to say that the alcohol is a little overwhelming in the end. However, it does not ruin the taste profile  M- creamy and carbonated. No doubt about it  D- this is another enjoyable beer from Stone. It's very drinkable in the sense of enjoying a well crafted Am Strong. When you think of that style of beer...

Sweet and toasty with smooth piney hops. Slightly dulled and not quite in-your-face. A more pronounced alcohol note.  The alcol taste as well as a super sweet malt flavor come through first.

Poured a caramel brown color with a little bit of a cherry tint to it. it had a frothy thin head covering the top of the beer that receded a bit as I drank it, only to cling to the edges of the glass.  The aroma has a pine and citrus flavor to it with a fairly strong zesty, orange and lemon peel flavors. It also has a pretty big malty, caramel and somewhat sweet flavor to the nose as well. I really like that it seems so unique and doesn't really fit into a style, although it probably comes closest to an American Barleywine in my opinion.  The taste has a nice big malty and caramely backbone to it but also has a big bitter, citrusy, hop presence to balance out the sweetness. The zest that the nose had is definitely present in the taste as well. It finishes a little on the bitter side with a little bit of earthy spice to it. Little bit of alcohol to it but not a lot.  Mouthfeel is on the heavier side with below average carbonation, which worked well for the style. Drinkability is good, it's a very nice beer overall. It's a very good tasting beer but what I really like about it is it's uniqueness.  Another Stone release that I will purchase a few bottles of every year.

147,1056,theWrkncacnter,4.43,"Poured from a 22oz bottle aged since the 07 release.  Appearance is only .5 from exceptional because of the slightly fading head, otherwise it would be perfect. It pours a deep muddy copper color, almost like an unfiltered apple cider. Which I like, because any time a beer pours this deep of a copper and this opaque, you know it's serious. The head fades quickly and leaves only a tiny bit of lacing. Smell is not too strong but definitely sweet and deep with a slight bit of alcohol around the edges. Taste is phenomenal. The aging has made this beer super smooth. The first taste that I think of immediately is chocolate, which quickly turns to a deep malty flavor that finishes with a crisp, slightly alcoholic hop note that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is like you've dipped your tongue into beer flavored honey, it sticks to your tongue and continues to deliver a piney hope note well after you've taken a sip. The slight alcohol note is the only thing holding this back from a perfect drinkability note, but maybe that makes it perfect because it forces you to savor this beer.  I feel like going out right now and finding another bottle that I can age for 3 years to have the experience all over again.

147,1056,ktrillionaire,3.85,"2009 Double Bastard  A - It pours a nice-looking ruby-brown hue with frothy off-white foam and copious lace.  S - It smells richly malty, like a Barleywine, a little vinous and dark-fruity, and some bourbon-like booze heat is apparent as well.  T - The taste is big and boozy, with very richly complex layers of flavors. This is a malt-bomb, first and foremost, but it is so much more; rich and sharply sweet malt is flavored with a very complementary citric/grassy hop palette, it is unusually spicy, and there is a huge booze presence too. It has as much in common with English Old Ale as it does American Strong Ale. Delicious, at any rate.  M - Very big in all respects; viscosity towards 'syrupy', carbonation on the verge of 'prickly', and heat squarely in the range of 'boozy'. Works well for a brew of this proportion.

147,1056,Esters,4.63,"Appearance : This is your typically wonderful Stone beer, with a hilarious bottle inscription and very deep golden brown color to the beer itself, with a slight lacy head. According to one of my friends (who is just being introduced to the beer world), it screams ""I know what I'm doing when it comes to beer"". I'm somewhat inclined to agree.  Smell : I have to agree with other reviewers when they say that they wish this beer had a bigger, more representative bouquet. This isn't to say that it smells *bad* or anything, but, for such a lovely beer, the smell is a bit lacking.  Taste : Oh. My. God. This, for me, is one of the Holy Grails of beers. Normally, I am a dark lager sort of gal, but this ale is just fantastic. To be poetic, this ale tastes like riding on a sailboat in the middle of August; lots of sun, wind, with a cool, crisp note in the air. It's refreshing without being light, and it's satisfying without being dark. It's fantastic. Very hoppy, but not super-bitter.  Mouthfeel : The only thing I can describe this beer is as a thick liquid, like some sort of beer syrup. I'm not sure if it makes sense this way (obviously the ABV is taking its tolll), but it is a very satisfying, thick brew. It leaves no ill-tasting residue, but the hoppy aftertaste just keeps on going. It's wonderful.  Drinkability : As this review might suggest, this beer is very drinkable despite its ABV (10.5%, as listed). I finished the entire 22oz bottle with ease. As a rather small gal myself, this is no small endeavor. I paired it with some of my mother's excellent meatloaf, and this ale held its own while not overwhelming the meal.  Overall : Fantastic. Simply fantastic.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

A slight nose of hops and spring time air. I wish it had more of a bouquet.  Flavor is STRONG ALE! wonderful hit of bitter hops combined with the sweetness of a malt providing a substantial flavor body to the mouthfeel. The alcohol content isn't particularly evident on it's own.  Finish goes on forever with the reverberant bitter hops flavor note lingering on and on and on ..  Mouthfeel is that of almost a thick fluid-- the strong flavor and aggressive stance make this beer something you'll want to keep sampling.  Drinkability- even though I think the ABV is higher than I'd prefer, the strong ale is such that I quaffed the pint-plus.. although the ill effects of the ABV will surely take its toll.  This is a beer that I would not consume on a casual basis. It is also not a summer's day thirst quencher.

Dark and rich amber / copper body with three fingers of a strong tan head. Retains very well.  Smell - A double punch of thick and intense malts and hops. I usually smell some tropical fruits whenever I break open the growler or the bombers.  Taste - Fantastic fruity and sweet flavors. Sugars, caramel, and a hint of butterscotch pairs well with citrus and other fruits. Finishes with a great touch of hops. Beefy yet so delicious! Yeah I said delicious, so what? You wanna fight about it????  Feel - A thick, smooth, full bodied monster. The alcohol is warming even on a cold on a cold pour. Carbonation is delicate and feels like it is cleaning the palate for the next drink.  Drinkability - Amazingly easy to finish multiple pours. A 3L growler goes quick with two or three people. Alcohol is noticeable yet with the taste and experience, it just doesn't matter.  Final Thoughts - This IS my brew of choice when it is in season.

A great looking head with excellent lacing, appears a light tan in color. Very cloudy, not much light penetrating here. Overall, a great and scary looking beer.  Huge malt nose, caramel, and a bit of hop scent, citrus and pine notes, though the maltiness is very dominant in this brew. Also smells hotly of alcohol. This is very intimidating, in a good way.  This ale really shines in the taste department, especially as it warms a bit. That monster malt character continues to shine through, brown sugar and a sickly sweetness conquers the palate. This seems to have a distant hop bitterness that lingers on the palate once consumed, and is very pleasing. This was poured slightly chilled, which seemed to mute some of the flavor, but it truly comes alive once warmed. Once warmed, the huge malt kicks your teeth in, and the sweetness is almost unbearable. Time to man up and show the brew who is boss here.  Sinfully syrupy feel, almost a chewy quality about this ale. Has major alcohol warmth once in the mouth and ingested. Almost warming like a shot of bourbon whiskey, though not quite. Very sticky and sweet feeling on the palate. This brew has good drinkability due to the incredible flavour and very unique characteristics. There may be a need to keep yourself in check due to the outrageous alcohol percentage, but other than that, there is a struggle to find fault with this ale. Truly top notch in my book.

Flowery pine sweetness...interesting it is.  There is a lot going on in the taste. At first, there is a lot of heavy malt, cherry and piney bitterness. There is also a pinch of lemon, pear, apple, brown sugar...a lot of the things I was smelling.  Medium to heavy thickness of mouthfeel with a decent boozy dryness at the end.

Generous sweet caramel malt highlights the nose with earthy hops to back it up.  The palate starts with sweet caramel malt, followed by some toasty aspects, and finishing with bold earthy hops. There are also some faded spice or pepper hints mid palate, but it always returns to the sweet malt.  This bastard is medium in carbonation and robust in body, although surprisingly smooth with just a touch of abv burn.  This is an unbelievable beer with great balance and tons of character.

It's inviting-looking to say the least.  Aroma-Rich and sticky-sweet, almost barleywine-like with a hop-kick; there isn't a single hint of alcohol on the nose, it's concealed brilliantly.  Taste-Smooth, so utterly, completely and impossibly smooth. The buttery malty sweetness and bittering hops enter into the equation simultaneously with equal, immense force and essentially wage a war between bitter and sweet on your tongue with neither side winning. There's some alcohol on the palette but it doesn't detract from the drinking experience in the least.  Mouthfeel-Just...perfect, not too thick as to impact drinkability but not too thin as to detract from the lush feeling of the beer in your mouth..

Color is excellent, dark amber, with some golden color in there as well. Smell is of citrus.  I was waiting to review this for a while, definitely quality brew, awesome taste, nor sure if the intent it to be similar to Arrogant Bastard with a higher ABV, but it is pretty much, maybe the double has a little more pop/hop to it, but they are along the same lines. I feel like this one is a little stronger, you can taste the hops and a citrus flavor very strong in the beer, and also the malt comes through as well, some syrup flavor going on, very complex taste, overall a great beer, it is worth the hype, goes into my beer hall of fame. Strong hop taste hits you in the mouth, literally. Taste explosion of beer. Innovative for a beer.  I think what makes this such a good beer is the balance they have between the hops and the malt, it is the perfect combination, as well as brewing right and probably using quality ingredients as well....but the balance is unparalleled.  And by the end of it you will have a solid buzz. This should be drank out of a crunk goblet....I will do that next time.  I need to update this....I had another beer after this, amazingly, because it is so strong, but it is a decent beer, I rated it a B+, and after the double bastard, it tastes like water. Amazing.

147,1056,Flashsp2,4.23,"Double Bastard into snifter  Clear mahogany body with gold highlights and a two finger creamy tan head. Great retention and bits of sticky lacing. A big sticky foam chunk hangs out in the middle.  Aroma rolls out during the pour. Light caramels, pineapple chunk, herbal hop leaf, tangerine, sweet boozy notes, wheat toast. Very spicy and fruity.  Sticky caramels, hop resin, oranges, pineapples, salty/herbal hop leaf, toasted whole wheat bread, a bit of sweet boozy heat, a long citrus bitter note at the end. Sticky, sweet, hot, bitter, resinous, all over the place intensity and deliciousness. Starts off sweet, then the big bitter finish lasts a good long time. A very nice transition from one to the other, and the complexities throughout the ride are very entertaining to the taste buds. This ale coats the palette and gives a good bit of sensory overload, never letting the mouth get comfortable at all. I get a little oakiness/chocolate in there, but I have no idea where it's coming from.  Dense, sticky body with a low level of tiny bubs trying to break through this sticky goo. To me, this is one of the best bodied beers around. Chewy and sticky, with just enough bubble to keep it lively.  This beer drinks like its slightly less arrogant sibling, which can lead to trouble with ABV in the double digits. Luckily, there is a bit of booziness that gives a bit of warming (or maybe warning) to the fuzziness that can come from this bomber. This beer should be available all year round, but then I would never buy regular AB again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Citrus fruit, molasses and a moderate dose of earthy hops are all present. Nicely balanced flavors.  T - Very nice malt bill that is extremely well balanced with the aggressive hop profile. The toasted nutty caramel malt and molasses compliment the strong earthy citrus hop flavors quite well. The alcohol is hardly recognizable except a bit at the end of the taste.  M - Light carbonation, flavorful hops and a slightly warming alcohol feel in the mouth. The malt and hops are one in this beer which is quite impressive given the aggressive 10.5% abv profile.

T: Bitter grapefruit and alcohol is the dominate flavor. Burnt toast. A light sweetness lingers, but very light. I can really taste the alcohol here. Just to much of everything, but balance and nuance. Nothing come togther well at all. M/D: A full body with low carbonation. Really sticky. It feels like an adhesive is sticking to the roof of my mouth. Tons of fusel alcohol. Add the high amount of bitterness, and this is unpleasant to drink.  I am not a fan at all.

Medium full mouthfeel. Slick. Bitter finish with just enough sweetness to keep the mouthfeel balanced. Wonderfully lively carbonation cuts through the semi-syruppy texture  D: This beer is so good I had to have two. Couldn't risk the keg kicking before I got a chance to indulge for the second time.

The aroma is nice and creamy, loads of caramel and citrus hops. Like caramel covered grapefruit.  This is a full on flavor assault as caramel meets piney bitterness in a battle to the death. Only it ends in a tie and they both get to live. Because man is this ever balanced. It's too bitter and too malty at the same time. In the best possible way. Bitterness is slow to fade in the finish. There's a slight milk chocolate aspect at play as well.  Full bodied, slick and pervasive, it's like a bitter hoppy oil slick in your mouth, without being too heavy handed. Very smooth and easy drinking despite the heaviness.  My palate may be a little challenged as this reminds me a lot of Arrogant Bastard almost to the point of being interchangeable with it.

Sweet almost like candy then a nice hint of hops lingering around there  Well, this was a beer that I highly anticipated ever since I heard that it was coming out down here this year. All I could think was Stone is making their version of Double Dead Guy (one of my favorites). Well this is probably the fifth time I have sat and drank this beer, but the first time I have actually written while drinking. I love this beer, but it seems like every time I drink it I get something new from it. The inconsistency brings me back every time for an additional sip. Now with that said I think I was pretty wrong in assuming that it was like Double Dead. This beer starts out with a perfect harmony of malt and hops then leaves a bastard of a lingering bitterness on your tongue. I love it. Stone did make this bad boy ready to cellar, and I have had one in that state since November. One of the good things I love about all stone beers is that they never let you down.

Poured to go with a steak and gratin potatoes that I had just made.  A - Pours a deep copper red with a fluffy pale tan head that sat about a half inch over the beer but dissipated pretty quickyl. Like a blazing fireplace, looks warm and inviting.  S - Smells sweet, toasty. The 10.5% ABV definitely hits your nose but not so much that it's offensive. a bit of pine hops and fruity notes.  T - A little harsh up front, with bitter hops pushing through. Finishes sweet. Delicious caramel malts on the after tastes.  M - Heavy, almost cough-syrup consistency with light carbonation. Not offensive, but not what I would call pleasant.  D - I gave drinkability an Average score because I'd probably turn down a second serving without some water or a beer with a less powerful taste/mouthfeel in between.

Very little head, which was disappointing, though there was some lacing.  The smell was sharp hops, dark fruit, and booze. The combination of the three is a very alluring herbal cocktail. The taste is quite complicated. Paradoxically, Double Bastard is less of a kick in the face than the Arrogant one. The booze is more pronounced, true, but the other flavors are more subdued. It's very clean and bitter and delicious.  I definitely need to find a bottle with a few years on it. This new bottle was so smooth that I can't imagine how sublime a sipper an aged version would be.

147,1056,Daniellobo,3.91,"Nicely crafted ale, very smooth, maybe too smooth...  Presentation: 22 Oz bottle. Iconic demon gargoyle with a jar of beer in hand, label reflected into a double image with the name of the brew. Perfunctory long and over the top narrative on the back, somewhat tongue-in-cheek rambling playing on the notion of arrogance and how most will not understand the brew and are not prepared for it. Does show bottling date, (2009 release) and lacks any other info other than Alc. by Vol. (10.5%). Poured into a tulip glass.  A - Amber brown pour with a generous creamy head, good retention and some nice lacing.  S - Smell is not particularly assertive, It has a nice balance of fruity hints over faint sweet caramel malt notes with a hoppy memory.  T - Sweet malty flavor with some emerging fruity touches, a softly emerging bite comes towards the end to hold it.  M - Fine carbonation on a medium to slightly full body beer. Creamy and smooth feel, with a hoppy texture note at the end.  D - Nicely drinkable, although for such a big brew it feels a tad too smooth, a bit too generic actually...  Notes: Fairly different from the Arrogant Bastard, in particular in how this one is rather smooth, subdued, and almost unassuming for such a boozy brew. Likable but it did not do much for me, at least not on this tasting. Not worthy again... At first I really thought that it was served too cold but letting it warm up left it under the same impression for me. I´m checking other people´s notes and I am thinking if I had a strange mellowed out or late bottle? Batch is from 09, it was not skunked and came from a typically very reliable place so...",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,zoolzoo,3.55,"2009 bottle, Duvel snifter  A: Not much of a head, quickly dissipated into some whispy foam. Pours a deep, dark amber color...almost cherry red in spots, actually.  S: Nose is full of bitter hops, some caramel malts, and alot of alcohol.  T: Hops bite first here but without much character except straight up bitterness. Alot of bready and toffee like malts as well, but that bitterness never lets go until long after the sip. Im also getting some wood, definite oak character here. This is a pretty sweet beer, almost cloying as it warms.  Something I find odd.... there is much less alcohol in the taste than the nose alluded to, even as the glass warms. There is some warming though, which isa good thing.  M: Thick, somewhat cloying if you arent in the mood. Fits the style so cant really complain too much. Little carbination.  D: Drinkability suffers given the ABV, mouthfeel, and sweetness of this brew. One bottle is enough for two id say.  This is a solid brew by Stone but not the best. It is, however, more enjoyable than the ""regular"" Arrogant Bastard offering.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S: More hops up front than I recall before and this bottle is 4 months old already. I don't recall smelling any hops in last years batch. A very nice sweet bitterness going on. Having a hard time picking apart the smells here. I am mostly going with bready.  T: Nice bitter maltiness. I swear my palate has really changed. Last one I got was same batch and I detected very minimal hops this and last year. It isn't as in your face as AB. This beer has a very smooth taste. I couldn't even tell you what flavors are going on here. Bready, hoppy and malty. So smooth. Borderlines a stout flavor. Impossible to not love the taste.  M: Spot on! It is so rich, smooth, creamy and decadent on the palate. Carbonation is super mellow. This beer has the best mouthfeel of any I have ever tasted. I never thought mouthfeel was a worthy category til now. I usually just say good carbonation but damn this is nice!  D: It is also the easiest drinking beer I can think of in a long time. I usually don't care for malty beers unless it is a RIS. But this one takes the cake. Still gotta knock off a few due to how strong it is.  This beer never fails to impress the hell out of me. Why not just replace AB with this? I was kind of in a bad mood til I cracked this one open tonight. Now all my annoyances are drifting away.

147,1056,biboergosum,4.37,"22oz bottle, 2007 version, enjoyed for the mere price of 25 Canadian ducats at the one-time only Stone event at Cafe Volo in Toronto.  This beer pours a mostly clear, shiny dark ruby amber hue, with a relatively thin cap of weakly foamy and bubbly beige head, which leaves some wispy, calving iceberg lace around the glass as it evenly subsides.  It smells of warm caramel, toffee pudding, fig, date, and raisin fruitiness, rather active leafy, piney hops, a soft citrus rind bitterness, and a menthol-friendly booziness. The taste is sweet caramel malt, sugary toffee, stewed raisins, muddled black orchard fruit, a growing earthy mustiness, and some isolated, but welcome all the same citrus and pine hop astringencies coming on a bit later in the game.  The carbonation is quite mild, but at least showing up to be counted for its supportive frothiness, the body medium-heavy in weight, thick, viscous, and fairly smooth, with a touch of airy creaminess as it warms. It finishes with a thankfully growing hoppiness to quell the steadily overbearing and dense malt, while the resident lofty alcohol remains scarily well-hidden.  It's been a few years since I've had the regular Arrogant Bastard (those words don't seem to mesh all that well together, do they), but this sure is reminiscent of that beer, as a beefed up, but consistent, and challenging older brother. I can see that this otherwise bucolic Sunday afternoon is going to get a bit larry, as I eventually try to suss out a suitable Supa Bowl viewing spot.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,ToasterChef,4.12,"Reviewed from my notes. Served in a snifter at the Lion's Pride. The beer is a dark ruby hue with a thin head of tan bubbles. It is too dark for me to see inside the glass, but I can see carbonation bubbles sticking to the sides of the glass. It has a robust malt aroma with hints of toffee and raisin. The flavor has a big malty punch up front and a hop bitterness in the finish that lingers on. There is plenty of sweetness and some alcohol to contend with. I think I can detect tastes of dark fruits, like plum, but it is the malts and alcohol that dominate. It has a medium body that feels thicker due to the thick mouth coat. There isn't much carbonation, as far as I can tell. I wouldn't classify this beer as a sipper, but it also isn't one you want to drink fast. A 22 oz bomber would do any BA nicely. Any more beyond the initial bottle may be too much for a sitting. This beer has some great cellaring potential. I want to review one that's been aged.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

(A)- Pours a cloudy & murky mahogany amber color that produced a fluffy off-white head that dissipated almost immediately. Left some bits of lacing behind.  (S)- Lots of caramel, toffee, & brown sugar with a relatively burn/roasted character in-between the dense sweetness.  (T)- wow, still has a big dry bitterness with a bit of lemon citrus up front. Finishes exactly as the smell was with all that rich & sweet caramel/toffee/brown sugar/ & a little butterscotch.  (M)- A good carbonation level. Very big sweetness & richness that is balanced fairly well by the dry hops. My problem is that this has a slight metallic component that turns into a funky wet wood component right in the middle ground; not very pleasant.  (D)- Very reminiscent of an old ale that was blended with an IPA. Perhaps this was aged too long?

A- Deep rich amber/brown color, little foam and little lacing.  S- Has a great hop smell to it, but your nose is instantly filled with a wiskey-esk scent probably from aging. Blends beautifully with a caramel notes as well. The hops/wiskey and caramel is a great combination.  T- Surprisingly smooth for all the smack-talk printed on the back of the bottle. Has malty first sip and a sweet ending. Almost a chocolate/smokey aftertaste.  M- Medium body, medium carbonation, great combination. I think they guys at stone got the perfect body and carbonation for the taste of this beer.  D- If you have enough money to drink this regularly then more power to you.

Drinkability is good thanks to how smooth this beer is, but the hops can make consuming a lot of this tough.  Overall, a really smooth and tasty beer.

Pour is thick, opaque. oily at best, very manifest of how tough this one'll be to chug. very, very little head which off the bat fills the room with that burnt caramel feel. no prelude, no subtlety. it's out there.  Smell also has hoppy, herbal feel to it but it's masqued in the sweet alcohol feel.  Taste is definetly super-strong. a blend of an initial roast malty sweetness, very strong one mixed directly with tonnes of alcohol. not bad, but certainly strong, is topped off with an overtaking of the hops, in a formidable manner, practically anesthetising the tongue. pungent liquor feel at the nose, sort of like a very sweet rum.

Chorizo and deep house music while I sample it.  A - Beautiful amber/red. This really deserves to be consumed in the sun, where the color really comes through.  S - Caramel, toffee, brown sugar. A bit sweet, not too much alcohol.  T - Lots of sweet malt, burnt sugar, nuttiness, and hops in the finish. Better as it warms, more character and depth. I keep thinking of caramels and for some reason it reminds me this year of a Snickers bar.  M - Perfect for this style. Carbonation is spot on, just the right amount of chewiness.  D - Amazing to me that I feel like I could drink 4 or 5 of these without an issue (although I doubt I could). The alcohol is well hidden and the blend of malt and hops only make me want more.  Overall it's just one more year that makes me wish this was a year-round release for Stone. Outstanding. DAMN, the spiciness of the chorizo only adds to the experience, this beer really held its own.

Hopy as well. This is not Arrogant Bastard at all.  Taste: As much as they keep all the IBUs classified this is not Stone's most bitter beer. It is their most flavorful and balanced beer. No trace of the higher alcohol. Slight caramel. Then hops. Even if you do not like Arrogant Bastard give this one a try. Its an entirely different beer.  Mouthfeel: Not too much carbonation in a bottle. The special glass adds a little from the wider base and increase in Ci2 bubbling.

147,1056,dpjosuns,5,"I had this exceptional brew on draft at a recent tasting/release at my favorite bar here in Ann Arbor.  A- A very pronounced Amber color. It actually appears to be a bit lighter (in color) than the Arrogant Bastard.  S- This is the first punch in the mouth. Naturally, the first aroma that hits you is the hops and boy is it a hit. After the initial hop aroma there is plenty of citrus, but not in a bitter way, the hops take care of that. It almost seems more like a ripe orange or perhaps pineapple, rather than lemon.  T- This is the 2 of the 1-2 punch this brew hits you with. The taste is out of this world. It has the huge hop taste and flavor of an Imperial IPA with more sweetened malt balance. This is one that can be savored. I really like that it is big and heavy like an Imperial, but with amazing balance.  M- The feel is obviously malty. It is nice and smooth. With some beers of this gravity, I feel they can have a tendency leave an almost abrasive feel in your mouth, but this does not occur here.  D- I love drinking this beer.

S- Large carmel malt scent upfront with a secondary hint of plum, grass, citrus and mild alcohol fumes.  T-M- The taste is one of its own. First is the big hop bitterness of citrus and fresh cut grass. Second is the toasted malts and barley that shows a thick pressence on the tongue. Alcohol is hidden but definitly there in a fresh way. I like the complex hop flavor with a malty backbone and a alcohol finish to prove itself. For a beer of this magnitude i believe its mouthfeel is perfect.

The color is a heavy rouge color that is thick and hazy.  S - WOW... malts, caramel, vanilla, oak, wood... then the hops, piney and sharp. What a complex and appetizing nose!  T - Taste doesn't let down. Similar to Arrogant Bastard, but smoother and better balanced in my opinion. The malts and hops are similar, but feel amplified. There is a noticeable ""heat"" to the beer, but you kind of expect that from a nearly 11 percent beverage.  M/D - Thick on the mouth.

I can't think of a more appropriate beer for this to happen with, but if this is a sign of good things to come, then so be it. 2009 release, poured from a bomber into a Stone Pint glass.  Double Bastard pours a murky amber-caramel color that reminds me a bit of the color on the outside of a nice candied apple. Has lighter amber highlights when held to the light and a finger of off-white head crowns the top of the brew. The head has some decent retention and leaves a nice solid layer of sticky lacing all around the rim of the glass.  The aroma is both sweet and menacing. Loads of caramel malt and dark fruits, but with a boatload of hops lingering in the background. I can distinctly smell traits of earthiness, grassiness, and maybe a little citrus. This is going to be interesting.  The Bastard is Beautiful, at least on the tongue. Very nice complexity, with the big caramel and brown sugar flavors pushing your tastebuds around in the beginning, then being knocked aside by a bit of fruitiness that is soon followed by sticky, piney, earthy hops. The hoppiness lets a nice bit of flavor and bitterness linger on your tongue as the beer finishes. This bottle is a couple months old, but it's still pretty damn hoppy.  This thing is brutally smooth. The flavors are so massive and intense that you'd expect a harsh, biting mouthfeel, but such is not the case. The large amounts of alcohol are masked by the smoothness of the flavors and a relative lack of carbonation, leaving the creamy, thick, smooth mouthfeel to carry the beer all around your mouth and let it linger even after it's been swallowed.  While it's drinkable in the sense that I WANT to drink lots more of this, after this bomber I don't know if that will be completely feasible. The alcohol and big flavors make it a big task, but man this thing is delicious. One of my favorite Stone beers to date, but then again, pretty much all of their beers have been exceptional so far. I do love this beer, though, and I think I can safely be deemed ""Worthy"".",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Caramel malt and bitter and aromatic hops. A little bit of grapefruit and citrus zest, but strong bitter and piney hops.  Very dense beer with complex flavors. Tons of bitter hop and citrus zest against toasty caramel with a hint of chocolate. Some honey - which is great considering the color! - and a little bit of that sweet floral hop. Great beer.  Like noted previously - dense and a touch syrupy, but not out of the style. I'd like a touch more carbonation, but it's fine. It's still a refreshing beer.

The raisins and oranges again make an appearance in the middle and are followed by a bitter, piney finish. The biggest flaw is that the beer is a bit hot.  M: The body is fantastic. Very full with an almost chewy texture and a moderate level of carbonation. The finish is surprisingly dry.  D: As I mentioned before, the biggest flaw with this beer is the alcohol presence. And as the glass warms up, it comes out a bit more. This is a big, big beer, and one you can't drink too much of in a sitting.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Kelp,4.05,"Got this out on tap into a goblet. Deep caramel color with a slight head and little lacing.  Unfortunately I was a bit stuffed up to get a real good smell of it. I got hops, a malty caramel, and a sweet smell to it.  Hops in the front followed by a malty taste and finished by the sweetness on my tongue. A bit of alcohol can be detected throughout the taste.  This thing is thick, almost chewy. Still somehow smooth in my mouth.  I could have enjoyed at least one more of these if I hadn't been driving.

Fully opaque red rust to amber color, like a glass of metallic mud swirled about, no variance throughout. Boozy nose of coconut custard, caramelized brown sugar, molasses, ginger snaps, raisin bread and then releases the pink grapefruit, mandarin orange citrus, pine sap and green straw, unprocessed grains. Full-bodied, the carbonation like a jelly roll, gets everything cascading left and right, for better or worse, it is certainly active in the mouth. Sweet and alcoholic, as if barrel aged. The caramel, molasses, butterscotch not to be denied, coats the palate like a blanket, were it not for the carbonation and the bitterness of the hops it would move into old ale or barleywine territory, even the grapefruit, orange citrus feels reduced. Pine and flowers here seem more obligatory than natural, steady presentation of the cherry, apricot, peach fruit, lower degree of dried fruit character.

Smell: rich, sweet malt aroma with hints of plums. Hops are big, peppery, spicy and a little floral. Quite nice.  Taste: whoa. Malt is very big with a flavor of plum-tobacco hard candy. This beer is quite sweet. Hops are as in the aroma, although they seem a little more floral than peppery here. It's hard to compete with this malt. Alcohol is quite present. Overall, very good, but very ... big.  Mouthfeel: thick, heavy, syrupy with very little carbonation. A nice mouth-coating leaves plenty of opportunity to revel in the flavor. Very little carbonation on this bad boy.  Drinkability: I must not be worthy. It is delicious but HUGE in flavor and alcohol.

Smells like a grapefruit just punched me in the face. Hops are very prominent (me like). Some malt in the background with very little fusel alcohol detected.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Grapefruit. Other citrus. Light malt, in that order. A hop forward beer. No alcohol taste. Very pleasant lingering bitterness on the end. Its very smooth with a nice light carbonation. Perfect mouthfeel to me.

Buttery nose with monster hoppiness hiding in the wings. taste - Sizzling with hops! Man, that buttery nose lulls you into a false sense of security.

147,1056,DoesntMatter46,3.9,"I rarely buy beers from Stone because the labels are printed on the bottles and I'd rather have labels that I can remove for my homebrews... Having said that, I poured the 22 oz bomber into a pint glass topping it off as I sipped it. Very minimal head that had a greenish tint do it, the body was a hazy, deep mahogany.  The aroma is not nearly as hoppy as I expected, I mainly get malty sweetness, with hints of raisin and caramel.  Again not as hoppy as expected, it was the 2009 release, maybe a few months were enough that the hops mellowed out a bit. But it could just be my tongue, after so many unbalanced DIPAs with 100+ IBUs that when you do have something well balanced, it strikes one as not quite that bitter. But either way, this is a big flavorful, well balanced American strong ale. When it first hits you, its very malty, and as with the aroma, hints of raisin; then the hops show up as a citrusy/ piney force to be reckon with; and the aftertaste has a molasses- caramel, but kept in check by the hops. Well balanced with complex layers of flavor.  Feels under carbonated and has a heavy, syrupy texture that I'm not crazy about.  Again, well balanced, but heavy, and at 10.5% served out of a 22 oz bottle this will be nursed for at least an hour, a very pleasant hour.  A good beer, but I enjoy the regular Arrogant Bastard and the oaked version over the double.

It's bitter and floral like an IPA, but with a bit more character. In fact, in many ways it reminds one of an IPA in just the sheer hoppiness to it. What's so unique about this beer is just how much bite it has to it. It's a real pallet snapper. It grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Carbonation levels are appropriate for the beer and really add to the overall intensity.  This is quite the beer, and not for the faint of heart.

Finishes semi-dry, alcohol character finish that lingers for several minutes. Translates to strong hop flavoring, sweet, smooth, almost bourbon-like (in a very mild sense).

S - Malty, caramel, toffee and molasses at the base. An overall fruitiness with some citrusy hops and some cut grass.  T - Strong, reminiscent of a barley wine. Strong malt underpinnings with tons of caramel and molasses in the flavor. Plenty of hops that tries to balance things out. Sharply bitter in the middle, but can't overpower the sugary, syrupy maltiness that is the base. Alcohol is noticeable in the flavor.  M - Pretty thick and full bodied.

The taste is dominated by sweetish caramel malts, a bit of fruit, Rainier cherries, and pear, smoke and a bit of leather. Not the most carbonated of beers.

Two fingers of thick, creamy yellowish white head that retains well and covers the glass in lacing.  4.5 S: Sweet caramel and toffee malts. Hops are intense, especially given the high gravity here. Aromatic and citrusy hops centered around orange and to a lesser extent, pine and peach.  4.0 T: Tasty brew here. Strong toffee and caramel from the top. Raisin and tobacco to some extent alongside a peach and orange fruitiness. Healthy hop bitterness which works well to balance the malt onslaught. Hops lend the citrusy taste as well as a bit of astringency. However, regardless of all the good qualities, there is just too much booziness. If I were to guess without knowing the ABV beforehand, I would put this brew at 16%.  3.5 M: Thick, viscous body. Bubbly carbonation, maybe a bit too much. Alcohol brings down the smoothness, but does give a nice warming on finish.  3.5 D: Really tasty brew.

Definitely some alcohol in there, but fairly masked.  T: This is potent stuff. Tons of hops sitting on top of a very subdued malt backbone, almost un-noticeable but definitely present.

Well balanced and impressively enjoyable throughout. A bit on the malty side, but that is par for the course in this realm.  The mouthfeel is substantial in girth with lingering traces of malt and hops, followed by a syrupy finish. As the contents of the glass diminishes, the carbonation becomes more apparent, but overall this doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment.

A fingers worth of head is hanging around and looks pretty luxurious. A bit tan. Huge hop nose as expected from Stone. Hard to reach the malt base of this one through all these hops. Very nice change of pace for the ASA. Getting some lemon and grassy aromas here too. Quite piney and resinous. Expecting a wallop of hops here. Indeed, starts with a hint of malts but you are promptly greeted by Mr. Hop. And he is quite a bitter gentleman. Some sweetness comes through in the beginning and end, but hops are so dominant in this one. Could be just a smidgen more balanced.  Pretty nice mouthfeel here too, not as thin as the hops would lead you to believe. Has the hop character of a IIPA, but a more viscous mouthfeel. Very nice juxtaposition.  Not excessively drinkable, more of a special occasion beer. And we all know snow is a special occasion.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Smells of caramel and piney hops. The taste is great, very smooth, loads of caramel, pine, good balance of hops and malts, even a tiny bit of chocolate. A tiny alcohol bite but quite hidden for 10.5. Not quite the ""kick"" that I remember Arrogant Bastard having but this beer seems much more balanced. Absolutely excellent from the first sip to the last. Another winner from Stone.  **More notes - 2008 bottle consumed on 12/21/10...2 years of age.  What a great beer. Alcohol is frightening at first but you quickly get adjusted to it's bad-ass-ness after a few sips. It reminds me slightly of a nice aged barleywine, super malty, but hops are still kickin'.

Strong aroma of floral hops and caramel upfront, with a noticeable amount of alcohol lingering in the back.  Taste again reveals some flroal flavors, a little citrus, a strong caramel presence and some pine towards the end. Nice hop presence but not overwhelmingly so. Alcohol soaked fruits can be detected almost all around but again it is not so harsh as to limit drinkability.  Thick and chewy mouthfeel, light to medium carbonation. Solid all around and probably just as good as Arrogant Bastard, but I'm not sure I have a preference among the two.

Almost like an Imperial Fat Tire in the bread character.  Mouthfeel: heavy but with a nice level of carbonation.  Overall: world class to be sure.

147,1056,sudsellier,4.03,"As soon as I saw this one in the cooler (for the first time ever in our small-ish market) I grabbed one without hesitation. I've been such an ardent fan of Stone and the Arrogant Bastard that there was no way I was going to bed tonight without knowing...  A: Poured out a nice light mahogany (in my Stone ""Fizzy Yellow Beer is for Wussies"" pintglass... knew I scored it for a reason!) with about a half-inch head of creamy, meringue-colored lattice... mostly small, dense bubbles with some larger forming around the outsides. Even coloration all throughout.  S: When you go to that favorite fancy restaurant of yours... you know the one... you always get the creme brulee even though you think to yourself, ""A real DUDE doesn't order Creme Brulee! Eff it... I'm getting the CREME BRULEE!"" The caramalized sugar on top of your favorite sissy-girl dessert... that's the smell here but with a noticible hop spiciness. That'll begin to put the hair back on your chest. You big nancy...  T: More toasty caramel with a nice, brassy hop tang. Slight touches of vanilla, oak, just-barely-burnt apple... ok, ok... I've got a wicked sinus infection right now... my palate's off a tad. Not noticing any alcohol heat despite the 10.5% abv. Rich, dark hop flavors with enough sweet malt backbone to cut through the bitters and leave a perfectly-balanced brew. Think of Stone's Ruination with a suntan.  M: Strong-enough malt presence gives this one a nice, rich texture. Carbonation is even throughout without one thinking they've got Pepsi in their mug fizzing away.  D: Yes.

147,1056,Pahn,4.77,"22oz bottle poured into Duvel tulip.  Appearance: careful pour produces about a 1 inch tan head that dissipates slowly. Lacing is spotty and temporary. The beer is an opaque, dark auburn.  Smell: Strong scent of sweet candy malt and alcohol. Smell is reminiscent of many American barley wines I've had (it tastes like an amped up barley wine too). It's very inviting and adds to the taste.  Taste: Extreme malty sweetness. The taste is a hit of sugar that gets reined in by a nice hop bitterness and strong alcohol warmth, with interesting and numerous candy and fruit notes throughout. As you get deeper into the bottle, the flavor never dulls, but rather expands and diversifies. Finish is mildly bready and warm. Amazing balance. For most of the bottle, the dominant flavor is sweet malt and caramel, with chocolate notes emerging as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, with subtle carbonation and a lot of alcohol warmth. Beautiful. While the beer is somewhat syrupy and chewy, it's still alternately smooth and punchy. A lot going on, but none of it unpleasant.  Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable for a noticeably 10.5% ABV brew. You'd have to be quite a tank to drink too much of this beer, but nothing about the experience of drinking it says ""stop.""  This beer flies close to the sun. It exemplifies the Stone ideal of extreme, idiosyncratic perfection. It's Arrogant Bastard on overdrive, with every aspect dangerously turned up, yet completely balanced. Some beers achieve a subtle harmony of malt, hops, and spice... this one matches the balance of such beers, while sloughing off any semblance of restraint. It may not be for everyone, but if you like these flavors and this style, Double Bastard is a perfect beer. Myself, I could drink this every day.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

A molassesy malt, pine and sweet citrus fruits burst through from the hops. Cherries and a liquorish bourbon character.  The smell does not lead astray. A very complex brew. Starts off again with the mellow malt than a twinge of bitterness w/ not quite the intensity of the smell. Finishes off with a dry bourbon flavor that burns the slightest tad, but not too much to unmask the well hidden 10.5%. (on a side note I was waiting for the cherry and couldn't find it until I burped, haha).  A very tasty brew that goes down very smooth for the 10.5%.

147,1056,Skitowneric,4.29,Poured into a pint glass with a heavy head. Dark caramel non-transparent coloring. Smells of sweet maybe brown sugar and just a little hops. Drinks very smooth considering the ABV. Light carbonation helps balance out the thickness. The finish of this beer has just the right amount of bitterness to balance out the initial sweetness.

It pours a beautiful thick dark-reddish brown with a two finger head that dissipates quickly (I think I need to wash my glasses better because no beer has been holding a head recently).  The first thing that hits you in the nose is hops. There is a lot of bitterness upfront, but underneath that is a hint of the flavors to come, including a bit of fruit sweetness.  When cold the most overwhelming flavor is the extreme hop bitterness that overrides everything else, but as it warms up the other flavors come through. Sweet fruit flavors, sharp pineapple, a bit of malty sweetness are all tied together by the hops, which weave in and out of everything else on your palate and leave a pleasant lingering bitter aftertaste.  The beer is smooth in the mouth with a bit of carbonation and a nice oily hop feel.  This beer is dangerous. There is no hint of the 10% alcohol.

A: Pours a dark copper amber with nary a head and moderate lacing. I must have screwed up the pour, otherwise a good looking brew.  S: Hops, hops and more hops. Some pineapple and alcohol can be slightly detected.  T: Holy hops! This is arrogant bastard on steroids! I think this is actually even better than A.B., which is saying alot because that's one hell of a brew. This seems like the angry, older brother of A.B. because there is a subtle difference in taste, appearance and texture to D.B.  M: Smooth and oily (probably due to the hops). I wonder if hops are becoming endangered due to this brew.  D: Regardless of the ten and a half ABV, this stuff is easy to drink.

This brew makes no attempt, like many sneaky Belgians (which I must proclaim I love right now), to mask alcohol flavors -- this is up-front, right out there, proclaiming its strength. It is strong malt, strong hops, strong everywhere and every way. It is in every sense a strong ale. It is an arrogant bastard, doubly so.  As it warms, it only intensifies and improves. This is a beer for which angels weep. It will put you on your ass if you aren't careful.

147,1056,JohnL9013,4.71,"I cannot believe this beer exists. The Arrogant Bastard ale was almost a little harsh for my tastes and I expected worse with this beer but was just completely dumbfounded when I discovered that it's not only stronger in flavor, but utterly, ridiculously smooth.  A: The beer pours a deep mahogany color that glows slightly if you hold it up to the light. The bubbles dance around and reveal more colors and nuances before reaching the surface...this beer is truly ""alive"" like a Guinness (but with flavor). Big 1"" sticky head with tons of lacing. This is the only 5 I've ever given for appearance.  S: As I started to type an e-mail after pouring this beer, the smell started to drive me nuts. It smells like caramel with hops in the background.  T: This beer has some of the finest malt I've ever tasted in a beer, and balanced so perfectly with bittering hops that it's just insane. A barrage of flavors hit your palate... caramel, molasses, coffee, hops, and a whole lot of other stuff I can't even describe. It's very complex, very delicious, and gets better as the beer warms up. This brew is truly ""exceptional"", make no mistake.  M: A microfraction over on the carbonation is my only complaint, otherwise you can roll this beer around in your mouth and enjoy it as long as you want.  D: This is the most drinkable &gt;10% beer I've ever had, bar none. I don't think anything could possibly be more drinkable than this and have this much flavor.

Nose has a (almost lemon-like) citrus, grassy and pine hop aroma that pierces through the malt sweetness. Alcohol comes through in the nose to the point of almost being tingly, burning and uncomfortable if too deep of a whiff is taken. It reminds me of the daunting essays that appear on the back of these bombers. I have to laugh because it's comical that the characteristics of the beer are really fitting to the profile of the ""bastard"" they portray in writing. Taste is brutally bitter if you don't brace yourself for what you are in for with this beverage selection however it's bitterness is paired well with the malt sweetness that comes through in the body and the big alcohol taste. Lingering taste of resiny hops is left in the mouth that at times feels a bit oil-like but other sips give way to more of the alcohol and malt character. It is quite a warming beer, the 10.5 abv is not hidden, it plays well with the rest of the bold flavors and aromas.

This is one fantastic smelling beer. Honey, sweet citrus, a cascade of caramel layers. Biscuity, a bit bready. Boozy, with some alcohol lingering in the back. Hint of fruitiness fitting in with the alcohol. Nice and complex!  Can this one taste up to the expectations now built up from the smell?  Smooth caramel sweetness up front, transitioning into a great citrus flavor. Moves along to a sweet caramel/bready finish that is not cloying or overwhelming in any way. The nice warming effect on the throat and stomach would make this a great holiday choice. Once it warms up a few degrees, it only gets better. The balance between hop bitterness, malt sweetness, and alcohol warmth is just phenomenal. The alcohol takes on a fusel character once it has warmed quite a bit, which I think would improve with some age.  M- Medium-to low carbonation, making it creamy and very enjoyable.  D-Holy mother!

T - I don't know what it is, but I get a good deal of banana rum on the palate. Not sweet at all, but still, essence of banana. Not the kind of banana sensation you get with a hefe, either. Maybe it's the alcohol? As for the hop character, I'm slightly disappointed. I was expecting to get my ass kicked with hops, but that didn't happen. A little boozy. It's not that hops are nonexistent, it's just that they aren't up to Stone standards. Still tasty though.  F - Thick and chewy. You know you're drinking big beer, but it's not overbearing.

D- the bump in alc. % over the original AB doesnt hurt this brew too much, though I do prefer the original over the double. there is not as much bitterness in here as i would prefer, and the combo of the heightened alc. content and the more sweetened citrus does bring cleanser to mind as is mentioned by a reviewer below. all in all though, Stone doesn´t seem capable of making a bad brew and this one is good as well...  salud!

I also get some woodiness, but there is no reason for this (maybe my mind is making the association with oaked AB, who knows.)  S- Citrus, but not a bitter hops assault, more of a sweet, lemony flavor (there is some bitter hop profile in the nose.) I also get some burnt sugars and roasted malts.  T- Nice hops bitterness with some definite citrus notes sweetening in the finish; only problem is it is somewhat reminiscent of lemon cleanser (but not too much so and it doesn't ruin the flavor for me.) Next, I get some vanilla and burnt sugar. Some heat, but it is masked extremely well as the flavors move from very bitter to smooth and sweeter on finish. The heat is easy to ignore if not looking too hard. Spicy earthiness also.  M- Nice and sticky. Great amount of thickness to this beer which really sets it apart in my mind.  D- This is pretty drinkable and the fact that it is over 10% and so drinkable is what bumps it up to a 4.5 for me.

S - Moderate aroma of pine scented hops mixing with dark malts to give off a distinctive barleywine note of mustard and pepper. There are some sweet malt notes as well; toast, toffee, and caramel.  T - Thick, rich toffee and caramel malt at first, followed shortly by velvety pine hops. Sugary malt in the middle, lots of caramel and toffee with a bit of red apple yeast. Gets spicy towards the end with more of the pepper/mustard notes from the aroma and a nice, strong wave of bitterness to push back the malt.

M - Thick, chewy body, moderate carbonation, and a somewhat sweet finish.  D - This is a big one! At first, I was a little underwhelmed, but a few sips in, it started to open up. The is that of a classic, mustardy, American barleywine and the flavor is a complex interaction of caramel malts and dark, bitter hops.

Smell is predominantly of strong pineapple fruitiness and floral hops with a hint of malt in the background.  So many flavors going on here. Strong fruity malt kick at the beginning, that's quickly built upon by strong fruity hops, with another swirl of malt that's finished by a slowly perceptible alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is quite heavy, almost chewy, with carbonation on the lighter side, and a really creamy mouthfeel.  Great beer, although the Oaked AB edges it out. Only thing is I'd say the fruitiness is a tad too overpowering, which affects the drinkability to some degree.

Finger and a half light tan head that recedes relatively quickly leaving a decent ring. Nice sticky lacing.  Grapefruit and pine hops, caramel apples, sweet rich roasted malts in the nose. As it warms, alcohol comes more apparent, but it complements the sweetness and bitterness in a way that makes it not too offensive.  The first sip packs a massive bitter punch. Sweet caramel malt backbone, grapefruits, apples, and pine. Even though I grow accustomed to the bitterness over time, it remains pretty intense throughout. Finishes bitter and spicy. The spiciness is reminiscent of rye....not that I could say for sure if it has rye, but it reminds me of rye.  The body is very full and smooth, but not too thick. A good amount of carbonation delivers a nice tinge. Dry, resiny, sticky finish.  I usually get used to the amount of bitterness in a beer and over times it seems to round out, but the bitterness here is constantly smacking me in the face. Of course, that's a good thing. The warmth the alcohol slowly creeps up as it warms. This beer is pretty intense, but is still very drinkable.  This beer definitely lives up to the ridiculous hype the label suggests.

S- This smells strong, I believe this was from a 2009 keg and it shows. Big amounts of hop bitterness and the same goes for malt sweetness. I cant help but to whiff out some alcohol. Some pine with caramel, toffee and dark fruits with apple slices. A lot going on here, but not the most balanced.  T- And so it begins, Im blasted by some alcohol burn and some bittering hops with pine and grapefruit punches. The malt is large and sweet but are not quite winning the battle just yet. The finish consists of some fruit along with some earthy hop taste on the tounge.  M- A little rough around the edges at this young state, but for what it's worth, this is a strong beer and right now it's showing off it's guns. The heat and alc need to calm down. Above medium bodied with ample crisp carb.  D- Cant do much with this one with the high ABV. This has the potential to go down or uphill depending on what a few years will do to it.

S: Sweet malt and hops, pear, citrus, and grapefruit. Smells a bit like an IPA, but with a much stronger malt profile.  T: The best way I can think to describe this is a cross between a Belgian Strong Dark Ale and an IPA. Some malts up front give way to a slew of sweeter flavors: dark fruits, pine, grapefruit. Sweetness gives way to a potent, bitter hop finish. Booze is also very apparent throughout. This is a very unique flavor that achieves pretty good balance between some unique elements. I think after this ages a year or two it will be even better.  M: Medium body, boozy and warm.  D: This is a pretty unique brew in my opinion. Lots of interesting flavors that balance out pretty well with each other.

Decent head, that leaves a little lacing.  The smell is very citrusy, a little piney, but there is a bit of maltiness.  Taste is just amazing, very strong on the hops, it is a mix of pine cone and grapefruit. It is also very sweet with a bit of malt. The taste of hops does linger in a great way. Can tell it is a high ABV, but it isn't unbalanced at all.  It is very smooth, and well balanced on the alcohol end.  I do love this beer, especially when fresh.

Smell - Deep fruity and sweet smell with tones of alcohol and the typical stone character (from hops, yeast, and high alcohol?)  Taste - Extremely sweet and relatively high alcohol bite. Hop character is relatively strong but surprisingly subtle for a stone's double bastard. There is a sweet caramel undertone.  Mouthfeel - Very sweet with solid carbonation. Mouth feels dry afterwards most likely to high hop content.  Drinkability - I love stone beers and this one is generally well brewed but I think they could do better. The hops aren't as aggresive as expected for a beer of this caliber and the sweetness is overwhelming. Tastes similar to lagunitas brews (which I love) in my opinion.

Not only is the beer great, but they have a full service restaurant with equivalent tasting food.  I have been to the brewery, done the tour and have tried all of the various Stone brews except Double Bastard. Up to this point, Arrogant Bastard was my favorite. Not any more.  By far, the Double Bastard is the best.  When I opened the 22 oz. bomber, I could smell the complex mixture of hops and malt. I detected overtones of pine and grapefruit. I poured the beer into a standard 20 oz. beer glass and watched as the magical stream filled to the top.  This beer has ruined me for ordinary, proletariat weak yellow beer made by the billions of gallons for the yearning masses. [not that AB hadn't already done that!].  There's no going back.

An inch of frothy light tan head sticks to the top of the pour and yields a fair amount of lacing, not at all unlike the regular bastard. Retention is a bit brief in comparison, a likely byproduct of the ABV.  Caramel and toffee on the nose with some muddled piney hops. Notably more depth on the nose and with a bit of a barleywine sense given the malt structure and alcohol volatiles.  Flavor is richer as well. Sweet and lightly viscous yet quite flavorful and never syrupy. More caramel and spice though not quite as coarse on the palate as the 'single' bastard given the additional malt. Some light chocolate and cherry liqueur after some air. This beer can warm up nicely without any negative effects, and develops a slightly warming nature to the finish as it does so, not unlike some brandy without the bite.  An interesting brew, richer and more robust than regular AB and without the occasional 'dead spot', yet in exchange the hop notes can be scuttled beneath the malts at times. Still robustly hoppy through the foam of a fresh pour nonetheless. A fair and equitable exchange per se. Equally enjoyable given the mood though likely better served in 12 oz. bottles given the potent. A style bender for sure.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,eyncognito,4.37,"Poured into Sierra Nevada Hop Tulip glass. Pours a cherry red/brown. Head has wonderful stamina and leaves a few spots of lace behind. Attractive bastard, looks like a barleywine. Aroma is a blast of sugary malts and hops, brown sugar and fruit. Caramel and oranges. Hints of some alcohol.  Flavor delivers on the promise of the nose and expands upon it. Caramel and brown sugar, cherries and oranges, bitter pith. The hops on this is pretty expansive, if it was not for the sugary malt this would wreck the mouth with bitter hops. Fruity, sugary, hoppy blend into a mean wicked s.o.b. of a brew. I've drank a good deal of this over the last 2 years (since Stone came to WI). Outside of Ruination, this is the one that does it for me. Finish is surprisingly dry for such a malty beer. Is it really surprising given the ridiculous amount of hops crammed in this bomber? I suppose not, but it is quite welcome.  Mouthfeel is pretty full, chewy. Well-carbonated. Drinkable? Well, kinda. The heat, while mild, reminds of the 10.5% abv. That said, 22oz. goes down pretty easy. This is the Stone beer that just gets me going. I'm not the biggest fan of AB, unless it's on tap.

Different lighting produces anything from dark brown to bright orange, and at all ends of the spectrum it looks great. it's murky and difficult to see through, except when directly backlit. the head is an off-white-nearly-tan color that compliments the body and laces the glass nicely. This one smells much better when it has a little age on it, but nevertheless it smells great fresh. hops and alcohol dominate here, though the malty goodness that shines as the beer matures is already apparent. a nice combination of dark and citrus fruitiness.  The flavor is, of course, the best part of the beer. if i were to classify this beer i would call it an old ale or a barleywine. it is overly-hopped for either style (something which of course changes over time), but, unlike most other overly-hopped old ales and barleywines, it doesn't matter here. The hops are most pronounced in the finsh and grapefruit-like bitter aftertaste. up front there is a deluge of sweet dark fruitiness (figs, red grapes, prunes) that evolves into a roasty(?) and sweet (brown sugar) maltiness that makes the transition to overwhelming hops nearly seamless. this is a very complex beer that is just so fucking good all the way around.

Much appreciated treat for myself.  Beer was clear and brown. Formed a thin white head (slightly yellowish bubbles) and has low carbonation. Lacing is high, its an attractive beer.  The aroma is primarily hops and malt. There is some detectable alcohol in the nose, but its not solvent-like at all.  Beer is surprisingly smooth, really high bitterness at the back of the mouth, a little (less than I expected) sweetness at the front. Sweetness in the front is primarily malt based syrup flavor.

Drinkability is fine, not high, couldn't pound this beer, Mouthfeel is good, nice connectivity throughout the beer, good body, not thin or too thick. Beer gets a little dry after a few drinks but that's OK. A really nice beer.  Whenever I drink a beer like this I wonder how it will age.

Medium-high carbonation lets this sit comfortably on the tongue for long enough to really savor the complexity yet gives it a bubbly sting that lets me know that this beer means business and wants to be enjoyed.

The head leaves gooey residue in its wake as the glass sides fog from the dissipation. The bacterial culture-looking bubbles beckon menacingly, fully well indicating this is a strong ale.

Sometimes I scoff at unedible characteristics attributed to beer, but I detect a leather and gunpowder. Ironically, I think Stone's unabashed arrogance is influencing me, for I'm identifying things in the nose that can possibly be in the beer; nonetheless, it smells tough.

There's really a sweet bitterness all the way through the taste. This strong characteristic makes taste and feel almost inseparable. I know it's a strong ale, but (surprise!) I want more hops. What if there were citrus notes or other fruitiness to it? I know...go drink an IPA. Undoubtedly, it's a good beer, and a good-tasting strong ale. It is so superbly balanced. Perhaps the simplicity is what limits it to ""good.""  I really want to credit what is truly an accomplishment: a strong ale that feels sweet and swallows bitter. The tongue tastes the brown chocolate malts while the cheeks hop-shrivel. Post-swallow lingerings are medicinal. Neither a quaint nor sophisticated beer, it's a massive classic offering from a landmark craft brewery.  Absolutely among the more drinkable strong ales, the Double Bastard offers a great example of what simple brewmaking can do. It's a storybook beer from a flagship west-coast brewery. It's remarkable how easy I can sip and analyze this one. At 10+%, it's easy how I can carry on endlessly about its qualities. Appropriate among any offerings, the beer, in sum, is an exemplary strong ale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,thespaceman,4.57,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass:  Appearance: Pours a beautiful dark amber in color, with red highlights streaming throughout this beer. Medium size head here, excellent head retention, the lacing here is sticky and very soapy.  Smell: Whew, this is a strong bastard in the nose. First is a nice alcohol presence that is sweet and pungent, hoppiness is here yet well reserved. I get bits of dark fruit, esters, some underlying malt, followed up by a nice dose of lighter fruit. Some typical DIPA properties come about as well, a strong hint of grapefruit and some citrus elements come along for the ride.  Taste: Awesome balance between a huge hop presence and a nice, thick malty backbone. The hops are resinous and very bold, I get alot of light fruit to darker esters, some passionfruit and citrus flows into some dark plum and grapes, the maltiness is chewy yet viscous. A sweet, yet bread like palate crusher of malt really makes this beer differentiate itself from the other bastards in the lineup. This beer finishes with a drop of hop bite and some alcohol, although very faint for the 10% ABV, it's still here but it's enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, this beer is chewy and big, almost barleywine like. Carbonation isn't too huge which makes that alcohol presence really stand out. A nice dose of bitterness from the hops here, a bit syrupy on the tongue but perfect nonetheless.  Drinkability: This is the reason I am so happy Stone has landed in Connecticut, I can't beleive I was missing out on beers like this. Out of all the Stone beer's I've had, this one takes the cake as my favorite. Lots of huge flavor profiles here, from the bitter, yet full fledged hoppiness, to the sweet, yet smooth and robust malt backbone. An excellent beer to start your night with, or even end it. This beer is dangerously drinkable so make sure you heed the warning on the label, the alcohol will really creep up on kick you in your ass.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Off the bat I am hit with sweet malty smell with hints of earthy hops. The taste follows right in stride with the aroma. It is so complex. I haven't had anything quite like it before so it is hard to describe. It has a strong malt presence, but it isn't quite as sweet as the smell let on. It has a roasted/smokey type taste that is balanced so nicely with the hops. Overall a very interesting beer that leaves me wanting more.

Initially, it billows up nicely to about two fingers, but quickly retreats to a thin collar of foam around the edge of the glass.  I remember this smelling more powerful. Weird. I get a touch of piney hops, some caramel and bread notes, and some booze. But everything is pretty subdued, even after it warms up. This is weird.  Ahh, the taste. Much better. Massive bitterness from the hops, which are more subdued in the realm of taste. Caramel, toffee, and alcohol heat in equal parts. Long, lasting bitter finish that sticks with you - I don't think my palate would be up for another beer for a while.  Mouthfeel is excellent. Medium-bodied with a good, prickly carbonation to it. Slightly sticky.  Drinkability is also excellent.

A: Deep, hazy ruby-brown body with half a finger of delicate pinkish foam that shows amazing retention and lots of lace - a nice full pour that still retains head? Yes please!  S: Toffee sweetness, fruity alcohol, and some floral and grapefruit hops. Warm, rich, and complex, if just a bit understated.  T: Big and in my face, with huge sweet malts going toe to toe with assertive hops and a finish that isn't shy about the booze. This is the 'roided up version of a beer that's already pretty extreme, and I like it.  M: Pretty thick with lots of smooth carbonation. Very nice.  D: As much as I'm enjoying it, I'm not planning on ordering another. Definitely a sipper.  Notes: Not a beer for the faint of heart, but I can't imagine anyone who loves beer not loving this one.

S: Smells robust and fruity, with hints of vanilla, pine and a floral bouquet.  T: Ooo, very rich and complex. A hot, semisweet alcoholic berry flavor comes in first, followed by a creamy rush of rich, sweet roasted caramel malts. This is then blended with the spicy taste of cloves and herbal hops while washing down smooth and malty with a notable citrus hop accompaniment.  M: Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth as hell, yet remarkably quaffable.  D: At 10.5% ABV, this is a sipper as a pre-or-post meal drink. I'm sure it would pair well with BBQ or some non cream based sauces and marinades, but it's so rich and complex, I'd almost always rather have it on its own.

Some vague dark fruits. Chinook hops. A bit of alcohol spice.  T: Caramel, toffee, vague chocolate taste up front. That indescribable arrogant bastard funk (yeast?) mid palate. Some alcohol spice and intense bitter hops at the back end.  M: Full bodied, creamy, medium dry finish.  D: This is the third bomber of the 2009 DB's that I've had. The other two were much colder, and the alcohol was much better hidden. This one is at about 55 degrees and the alcohol is making itself known much more.

S- Dark cherries and dark grape scents are prevalent. It smells almost of a red wine, not that I drink much wine, but that is what it reminds me of. But then...  ... The smells are morphing! After letting the rest of the beer sit in the bottle as I drank the first half, I then poured the rest in the glass and to my amazement, there were different scents! It has turned into a almost citrus grapefruit on the front with the darker cherry/grape on the back end.  T- Wow... I have never tasted a beer like this. The first thing that hits me is the outstandingly strong maltyness. Then the bitterness takes over and finished with a nice warm alcohol burn. Compared to a IPA, the hops seem fairly mild. I am having trouble with this one because the explosion of flavors on my virgin palate is overwhelmingly awesome. I am starting to understand the long description on the back of the bottle. I am not a worthy soul!  M- Very smooth going down and the carbonation is just right. Has a nice boozy bite that is warming going down.  D- Well this most definitely is not a beer most people could have more then one of due to the 10.5% ABV. But if you consider one bottle, I have no issues finishing this bottle and going sip to sip.

147,1056,WhatsNewinBooze,4.62,"This past week Stone Brewery released their tenth edition of the Double Bastard Ale, a doubled up version of their popular Arrogant Bastard Ale. I have loved the Arrogant Bastard for many years now and the Double Bastard is just that much better. It pours are golden copper color with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. The nose is kind of sweet with notes of caramael and cane sugar with a slight bit of citrus from the hops. At first taste the Double Bastard comes across well balanced between the sweetness of the malts and the bitterness of the hops, but as the beer lingers the hops really start to show through. I get flavors of caramel, dark chocolate, anise and citrus and since this beer is 10.5% ABV the flavors are intense and dominating.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Very little in the way of lacing, either. What little head there was receded quickly.  Smells of caramel, sugar.  Great malt presence from the start. Balanced well by the big hops on the end. I get caramel, sugar, baker's chocolate, wood, pine. Absolutely dominating beer.  About as little carbonation as you can get. Nice complement to the heavy mouthfeel. At 10.5%, you have to expect a great mouthfeel. This one is an absolute wrecking ball on the palate even after the first few ounces.

Doses of sweet grapefruit, pine, and a bit of earthiness.  M - Good carbonation, residual hop flavors feels like a hop cone has been dragged over the tongue leaving a delicious earthiness like leftover buds and stems, hopefully that make sense to at least someone else.

T: Caramel malt upfront with piney citrus hops sticking to the mid palate and hanging on through the finish. Vanilla and a little honey round out the finish of this beer making it very smooth and easy drinking.

Not overly complicated in flavor, pretty straightforward, but very good in what it is and what it sets out to be.

Carbonated just enough so that it gives your tongue a slight tingle, but not too much that it gets in the way of the flavor profile. Wonderful!

Overall: Okay drinkability, the sweet malt flavor is not as strong as I would like. The strong bitterness is not balanced out with any other flavors. In the smell the malt character is really good, nice sweet roasted nut aroma, but in the flavor that malt character takes a back seat to the strong hop bitterness. I hoped that waiting a bit to drink this would help the malt come through with the hops muted a little but I either didn't wait long enough or that doesn't happen with this beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,rayjay,4.03,"2007 vintage. Served into a Double Bastard serving glass. Thanks baby!  Rather impressive looking carmel colored ale that has a brown strained head. Sticky on the glass.  Big time carmel malt bomb, the aroma is.  A big beer for sure. Malt bomb with carmel out the ass, then followed by a mean bitterness. Alcohol is well hidden but the strength is there and not to be mistaken. Big time fruity esters, and a surprising amount of hops.  Not as sticky and viscous as I suspected. Hinting towards a creamy, low carbonation mouthfeel.  Drinkability is good, although it gets hairy towards the end when it sucks all the moisture out of you. It went down quicker than I thought it would.  I like this better than Old Guardian and much much better than Arrogant Bastard.

147,1056,yelterdow,3.48,"Review #600. I'll celebrate this milestone with something bigger than usual, and an honest enthusiasm to review with no pre-judgement whatsoever.  Served from a 22oz. bomber from the 2008 Release at between fridge and cellar temperature in an imperial pint glass. At 10.5%, this should be memorable (or not)...  Appearance- Smelling more like a barleywine than anything else, this enormous beast of a beer glows a rich reddish brown and supports a wickedly supple off-white crown. There is a hint of red in the foam as well, and the retention speaks to the massive dosage of hops used in the recipe. There's some killer lacing that sticks like glue to the sides of the glass. A fruit fly literally just came out of nowhere and landed on the rim of my glass... I swear.  Smell- The instant I popped the cap, I got the whiff of Arrogant Bastard Ale cranked up a few notches... the aroma is massive, loaded with hops and malt and warning the recipient (me) of what is about to come. I am ready to give this a go.  Taste- Oh jeez... here we go. I swish, swallow, and feel the warm tingle of this beer's effects almost immediately. The hops and malts are so abundant and so overwhelming that the tongue is inundated with enough IBUs to power a small country. Yes, it's balanced all right... and the bitterness left behind at the back sides of the tongue make me keep feeling like I have to sneeze. It's actually not too far-off to compare this particular tasting experience to a year-old bottle of Bigfoot, there's a similar hop attack and malty presence here.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The viscous texture lays across the tongue and disperses nicely down the throat. I would suggest a hearty beef or game dish with this one, as the gigantic overall character calls for something big to complement it. I've survived the bottle, but haven't stood up yet... maybe I'll just sleep in this chair tonight. Cheers.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,zee3are0,4.17,"Bought as a graduation gift for me, the time I drank from the Double-Magnum was among my better memories. More recent enjoyment here at home has been just as delicious, if not the same joy for what beer always represented since the dawn of time - a chance to enjoy times with companions.  A - Semi-dark. Not as black as an Irish stout, but still, like a fresh coffee. Reddish, with a thick head.  S - Like burnt carmel with toasted nuts.  T - Starts sweet, or at least feels that way because the after-taste comes on strong. Very bitter after-taste. Lives up to it's name; very arrogant. Moderate finish, alcohol is barely noticable in both taste and feel. It's strong in flavor, but not of alcohol in taste.  M - Arrogant, for lack of a better term. Despite the head, it's not very effervescent in the mouth.  D - A bit to harsh to be a daily enjoyed beer, it's nothing I would turn down.  The Double Magnum needs to be enjoyed at a party or at least with a whole lot of friends who respect ""strong"" beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Aroma of toasted nuts, caramel, burnt bread, sweet sugary malt, citrusy sour hops  The taste is initially sweet and sugary. Burnt brown sugar, caramel, toffee. The flavour moves quickly to a biting sour hop finish that is very bitter and quenching. A little too much alcohol for me, and too much sweetness in the finish.

T: Upfront malty goodness that gives way to some bitter hops. The malt is accented by great pineapple and apricot hop goodness.  M: Medium body with a good amount of carbonation.

Fortunately, I had a bomber to myself, so I experimented a little. Cold, it tasted better from the bottle than from a glass. However, once warmed, the bitterness went away, sweet and citrus came through very well. I am now convinced, that this beer should only be served at cellar temperatures (55-58 degree). At the very end of the bottle, I am getting a pleasant little tart/bitter bite at the back of the throat, and I like it. Feel was good, nothing remarkable.

Perfect lacing.  S: Spicy caramel. Some Citrus. Alcohol. Heaven.  T: Is there a word for 'smoother than smooth?' I would start by saying that this is a truly robust beer that requires multiple tastings as you will discover new layers of complexity.

147,1056,lacqueredmouse,4.35,"Pours an absolutely lovely burnished red-brown-gold colour with a thick head of yellowish white bubbles, which cascade up and then down in the glass. Very pleasant indeed. Lacing is great, and it looks as thick as a elephant sandwich. Very nice indeed.  Oh yeah, masses of hops. Extremely pungent, but they veer to the side of sweetness. Lots of pineapple, pear, musk and passionfruit, and not nearly as much pine resin or citrus. Very rich and mellow for a high hoppy beer. Very nice again.  Thick and full on the palate, initially sweet, crescendoing with hop bitterness mid palate, and then declining to a very mellow rich toffee sweetness on the back. Perhaps just a light hint of heat on the back, but it's very subtle. The lovely toffee note on the back is what makes this for me. It makes it more than a highly hopped ale - it gives it gravitas and complexity. Very nice. Mouthfeel very smooth and delicious.  A classic American craft brew. Peppered with the wonderful American hops lusciousness, but with a deep complexity underlying this. This is not simply a beer brewed to the extreme for the sake of it. There is a clarity of purpose and a wonderful structure to all of the big flavours. Once again Stone has given me an extreme, but philosophical American beer experience.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Otherwise, well not otherwise, it just is excellent.  Nose is extremely sweet with a pongy tropical smell, hints of spice but a large amount of caramelised pineapple, banana and maybe currants as well. That sweet spice aroma is to die for, while the rest of it (some floral hoppiness as well) is pretty gosh damn nice as well.  Taste is very malty but with a long, slightly phenolic hop character. Has a barleywine-esque richness with spicy notes of cinnamon and cumin, raisiny hints as well, and a bit of alcohol warmth, as well as a boozy sourness, before the hops hit. Slight astringency at the back, hops are not as tropical as the nose suggested and are definitely medicinal in character.  Mouthfeel is deliciously velvety with an amazing creaminess that somehow overrides the prominent alcohol. There is a lot to like in this; sourness makes me a bit meh, but it is very well constructed with pleasant flavours and an amazing mouthfeel. Almost can't detect alcohol, but it certainly isn't harsh.

Caramel notes, citric hoppiness, herbal and bready notes. Aroma is richer than the body, but the same notes are present. It becomes a bit more balanced, but the hoppiness still come out in front.

As I raise the glass to examine the colors, I can already smell the wonderful fragrance. Nose is strong of very chewy caramel malts and a bit of alcohol. Some vanilla and a bit of spice is somewhere in there. Very big bodied on the way in. It hits you first with that wonderful chewy roasted vanilla, caramel flavor and the malts rush throughout your palate on the way down.

Piney, resinous hopiness as well.  Complementary amount of carbonation tickles the palate. The resin, pine, and bitterness of the hops dominates initially. Then the powerful sweetness of the impressive malt backbone starts to impose itself. Esters of ripe dark fruit. Pleasant warming alcohol in the finish.

Hearty caramel and chocolate with a licorice fade. Lots of fruit, primarily dark fruit, like raisin, prune and fig newtons on steriods versus more fruity fruit i.e. cantaloupe, peach marmalade and hints of strawberry. Hop oil aftertaste with smatterings of booze.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy--like the malt is holding the carbonation captive.  Fairly balanced actually, in an over the top way.

So unabashedly opaque it's downright menacing.  Smell: incredibly intense concoction of caramel malty sweetness coupled with waves of dark purple fruit accompanied by subtle undertones of roasted nuts and toasty chocolate. Time has allowed the floral hop aromatics to transform into a more herbal, dank resinous monster of an aroma; mixes masterfully with the aforementioned malt presence. What a freak american barleywine would smell like - and maybe it is after all, especially considering the contributions age has brought to this beer.  Taste: The smell unquestionably informs the taste; this beer is fully realized after taking a deep swig. Waves of deeply complex flavors incessantly assault the palate, yet convey some sort of nuanced restraint, presumably from the aging process. That being said, this beer has aged rather gracefully.  Mouthfeel: luscious creamy-smooth mouthfeel with a noticeably full body - very heavy on the palate, which is certainly a good thing in this case.  Drinkability: no easy answer here, but the drinkability is not bad, and is rather quite pleasing.

I'm reminded of some West Coast American barleywines here, but with a bit more of adark fruit/raisin profile. Hops are piney. So pine, raisin, and dark wheat bread. The bready aspect is closer to pumpernickel than biscuit.  Oh man, this is one delicious beverage. It's a 2008 batch, and I suspect the hops have tamed a lot, along with the alcohol. It's not hot at all. Alcohol is present but not dominating the brew. Raisin, whiskey, vanilla and pine. A bit of caramel. . Fuck, this is good. I'd like to try a fresh one to compare.

A: Poured into an oversized pint glass with a decent head forming with giant bubbles. Great lacing on the glass with average head retention for the style. The head is an off-white color. Red/Mahogany body that refuses to let you see through it. Cloudy and delicious looking. A little foam left on top that doesn't look like it plans on going anywhere.  S: Sweet smelling, citrusy is where the sweetness comes from. Pine as well. Usually run across one that is leaning towards pine or citrusy fruit, but this one seems to do a pretty good job of throwing both at you at once. Not grapefruity like many strong ales, but i would say pineapple after much argument with my nose. Some have mentioned the alcohol but the other scents seem to overshadow it to me. The pineapple can really be pinpointed if you sniff the bottle itself. Complex.  T: Well the smell didn't lie, it blends the pine and citrus together, although I can't decide if my assumption that it was pineapple was correct from the taste. Alcohol nips at the tongue and it is delicately hoppy, yet it let's you know that it is an American Strong Ale while being smooth. Nothing wrong with this beer, but I'll keep checking the others for quality....  M: Smooth, the alcohol doesn't detract from the taste by intruding, but let's you know it is present and accounted for while tingling the tongue. Amazing  D: I am set with one bomber of these. I feel content with just having that amount and no more. No more needed, nor desired. Not a bad thing though, as I feel as though my palate has been satisfied.

Thick and heavy pour with an equally thick and heavy camel colored head with tightly packed bubbles - leaving an enormous film of thick lacing all around the edges of my traditional pint glass. Head retention is good (sticks around for a good while).  Smell is big and chocked full of a wonderfully bitter and citurs hop bouquet and shovel-full of roasted malts. Moderately complex and intoxicating on the nose. Very nice...  Smell is dictated in the taste. This is a heavy hitter with no thin spots or inconsistencies. Borderline a quality barleywine, in my opinion because the big malts play such a large role. Flavorful and robust. Big, chewy malts mixed with some oats, piney and citrus hops and a spike of warming alcohol at the end to remind you you're not worthy.  I think this is a flagship beer for it's style.

A piney earthy scent for the hops (not as much citrus) and tons of malt sweetness. The alcohol is very apparent.  D- Strong initial hoppy bitterness with pine and hop oil tastes. There is a slight citrus taste that wasn't present in the nose...maybe grapefruit or pineapple? The taste moves from bitter to sweet with malt and caramel flavors. Some light yeasty breadiness and LOTS of alcohol present. Hoppy bitterness and alcohol flavor lingers with a long finish.  M- Medium/full bodied with lots of carbonation.

Aroma involves huge dark fruits (sour cherries, plums, raspberries) sweet malts, dark chocolate candy filled with caramel and a metallic essence which wafts oddly toward the end. Color is a deep. murky cherry-red with orange hues, all Satanic and fiery. Now we're getting somewhere.  An initial sip reveals more dark chocolates, black licorice, grain, subtle pine and a good bitter hop ending with an almost, but not quite creamy finish. A good hit of alcohol heat strikes right in the middle of it all, redemptively separating the men from the boys, and working well in the mix . Mouth-feel is medium to full bodied.  The only detraction I can think of is that after some warming up the beer becomes a tad unbalanced, favoring the hops over all the other elements. I realize this is a sought-after affect these days, but a very slight diminishing of the hops, and a slight favoring of the sweet and fruity elements might actually lead to a better experience, without taking away from the overall boldness of the brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Somewhat smokey and sweet at the same time with a nice bitter finish.  This one is like a smack to the face. The 10.5% abv is noticable but not as much as you would think.

But it certainly is good.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,adamette,4.63,"Live review. Poured from a 2008 bomber into my Stone Levitation Ale silver rimmed glass. No observed ""best by"" date but I do not think that it really matters.  A 3 or 4 inch light brown head over a medium brown opaque body in regular room light that glows a gorgeous ruby red in front of direct light. Nice lacing appears before I even drink it (and of course remained for the rest of the tasting). This look cannot be improved in my opinion.  S Medium malt sweetness, significant hops and alcohol to the nose. Reminds me of a Barleywine really. I detect a nice balance already.  T Medium malt and grains, barley and a muted, in control hop profile (it seems that I smelled more hops than I tasted). This is a huge beer that demands your attention. I really appreciate the malt sweetness that I did not expect. As it warmed (and I became used to the great complexity of the beer) I realized how incredible this beer is.  M Big with ABV, Malt, Barley and hops tastes. It can be a bit biting at times with the tart hops profile.  D I will enjoy this bomber but this is NOT a session beer (not that this is the intention!). There is plenty here to interest the taster to keep drinkability high.  Notes: A beer with an attitude (read the label!) that delivers completely. Bravo!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,TheRowan,4.72,"A: Deep copper/dark amber in color. Almost no head. Looks like very little carbonation. The small head there is, is ivy in color and is not very active. S: Sweet deep smells of the earth! Like home made jelly or marmalade. Sweet summer air in the spring woods. T: Sweet, rich and deep. After initial deep sweet flavors alcohol flavor is present throughout the whole moth and throat. Hints of rich chocolate at the end. M: A full mouth experience. Coats the mouth like cough syrup but is comforting. There is more carbonation to this beer then looks would tell you, even at the end. D: Very drinkable but certainly not a refreshing beer. Tasty, throughout and leaves you wanting more.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,LordAdmNelson,4.06,"A- A nice dark robust amber-brown color with a finger of creamy tan head that sticks around for a while.  S- Not too strong, I get piney/grassy hops and some malt. Caramel and lightly toasted malt comes out as it warms.  T- This is too cold right now, but as it starts, I'm getting bitter piney hops mainly. As it warms, I get a little sweetness--like a cherry twinge or something. Still piney. Rum-raisin flavor lingers. Alcohol in the background is masked well. This is nice! I remember first trying this when I was a new BA and thinking it was horrible... definitely something that you have to be ready for. Caramel and a slight biscuity sweetness comes out too--actually, big malt flavors come out as it moves along.  M- Not bad, a decent amount of carbonation to keep things moving, pretty creamy and full though too. Syrupy.  D- This is a big beer, definitely a tough one to move through quick. I would only have one of these at a sitting and then reach for something else. Definitely like a rich Barleywine, IMO, I like it a lot. I would compare it to a harsh Old Guardian, honestly.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,callmemickey,3.9,"A: Mahogany body with a thick offwhite head. Good lacing.  S: Mixture of pine and caramel malts take center stage. Some citric hop bitterness as well.  T: Nicely balanced as caramel malt and pine bitterness. Again the citric notes ride in here as well and highlight the complexity of the brew. Booze shines through.  M: Medium-full body. Good carbonation. Clean, bitter finish.  D: The 10.5 creeps in by the end and starts to dampen the drinkability of an otherwise good beer. Will have from time to time when I see it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Tastes id as it smells all malt with some hop bitterness. Some alcohol warming and It finishes bitter.  Thick full body and syrupy.  Nice sipper that will age well.

147,1056,bulletrain76,4.12,"22oz bottle. I had the pleasure of trying this during the same session as Arrogant Bastard, and I think the comparison helped me understand there beers much more. DB has a very similar appearance, with maybe a little more honey in the body, and a slightly darker and fluffier head. The aroma is malty and pretty hoppy with lots of candied citrus; richer and more balanced than AB. The flavor is similarly balanced with massive malts, citrus hopps and a little alcohol. The way it all blends into one smooth experience really sets it above. All the flavors work well together, over a thick and slightly syrupy body. Lots of intense flavors, and you definitely can't drink a lot of it, but the balance and smoothness hold it all together beautifully.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,spratmi,4.4,"A: This beer poured a dark red mahogony/copper color with a thick two finger bubble filled head that maintained excellent lacing. S: Immediately after the pour I was hit with sweet caramel and malt aromas, but the nose quickly evolved into a strong dominating pine scent with hints of citrus. The caramel malt lingered in the background. T: Excellent. A complex mix of sweet caramel malt and pine hops. A citrus zest bitterness lingered in the aftertaste, while the alcohol was noticeable. Alcohol becomes more prevalent as beer warms throughout tasting. M: This beer had a creamy full bodied mouthfeel with excellent carbonation and a dry bitter finish. T: Very refreshing and drinkable considering the high alcohol content.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,GodOfBeer,4.47,"Pours a dark clear red/mohaganey brown, with a thick yellowish white head, nice lacing.  Smells hoppy, citrusy, some fruitiness like cherries or strawberries, nice spices and very floral.  Tastes nice and hoppy upfront with some melon or cherry undertones, some caramel and apple, sort of medicinal, somewhat sweet but balanced perfectly by the hops. The alcohol is well covered.  Nice thick almost syrupy, but somehow very smooth mouthfeel, very very good beer and surprisingly drinkable at 10%!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Thorpe429,4.32,"A: Dark copper with a nice wheat head and a good deal of lacing.  S: Tropical hops and some roasted malts that bring on a good deal of sweetness.  T: Quite sweet with dark sugars and caramel in addition to the tropical and citrus hops. Slightly earthy with some wood notes.  M: Full body with good carbonation and a bready mouthfeel.  D: Pretty drinkable. This is definitely a bastard of a beer.

147,1056,alcstradamus,4.13,"Poured a beautiful deep mahogany/red color with a big head and good lacing. Smell was mostly lemon peel and citrus hops. Taste was floral/citrus hops and a strong bitterness that was not overwhelming. Medium bodied, oily, good carbonation levels. It was a little rough on the palette and a bomber is way too much to have at once, but I enjoyed this thoroughly.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,mullenite,4.2,"2008 Bomber in to a 25oz snifter  Pours a dark brown with a thin off-white head that quickly turned in to a ring around the edge of the glass.  Smells of chocolate and caramel with very little rubbing alcohol lingering in the back. Chocolate and caramel smell great but the alcohol smell is off.  Strong alcohol taste up front with chocolate/caramel in the middle and roast malts at the end. Sort of an anti-doppelbock if you know what I mean. After being disappointed with Arrogant Bastard and enjoying Oaked AB I was unsure about Double Bastard but this is a far different beer, at least with a year on it.  Medium body with a lot of thin carbonation that really cleanses the palette well. Has a very long roast finish.  Easy enough to drink, especially for the ABV%",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,TheTrevor,4.4,"This beer poured translucent reddish copper with a two-finger tan head. The smell has a fruity pineapple character along with some piney and herbal hops and alcohol. The taste is all about extremes. It starts off with some very sweet malt that's cut by some very aggressive piney hops that give way to a substantial alcohol presence. Somehow all of these seem to balance out to a surprisingly taste and drinkable beer. The mouthfeel is thick and almost syrupy with some very fine carbonation and warming from the alcohol. This beer is surprisingly drinkable for something that's 10.5%, and is definitely something worth experiencing if you have a chance.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,ryrust5301,4.28,"Apperance - One of the thickest beers I have ever seen on the pour. It's so thick it looks like a goopy caramel apple cider. Cloudy and murky with a ton of depth to it. Head was thin and barleywine like. Very thin off white ring adorns the top. Head never got above an eyelash length. DAMN this beer is thick!!! Looks as if it will take some effort and time to get down.  Smell - Very big and barleywine like here as well. Sweet sticky caramel aroma with a candied fruit tone. There is some alcohol heat there, but not enough to be a turn off.  Taste & Mouthfeel - First things first, and that's the immense personality of this beer. It's easy to get overwhelmed as it's a sweet malt caramel slab on your tounge, followed by a crushing hop bitterness on the back end. Quite remarkable how they marry these two stages together. Not many beers can pull off the full sweetness and the crushing bitterness like this beer does. It's more hoppy than some double ipa's! Alcohol is definitely present, and it should be. I love the fact that this beer holds nothing back, and make sure you sip and savor. Full and oily in the mouth are the two perfect words for this one. Carbonation pops up to help liven it up a bit.  Drinkability - I am sharing this one as I rate, and i'm glad i'm doing so. If I didn't this would be an all night affair. Drank this a little too young I believe, with a bit more age an elite beer would unfold. Will by a bunch more to age and see what shakes loose. Only a strong alcohol nut crush keeps this one from elite on the drinkability scale.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,ShrLSU,4.33,"A - A deep amber color with a thin tan halo of head, which disapates to nothing. Heavy lacing on the edges as you would expect with 10% ABV.  S - A sweet maltiness and caramel on the first smell. The second left some hop notes, maybe some fruity, and a touch of woodiness. A nice strong alcohol whisp that stings the nostrils.  T - Wow like a quick jab from Pretty Boy Floyd...Malts are right there with some sweetness and rich caramel flavor. Back comes a hook with some citrus but bitter hops, and the alchohol brings the upper cut to pulverize the tongue to the mat. Damn so much going on here, but the balance is nice.  M - Well carbonated to lighten up a heavy hitter. It feels heavy in the mouth, almost creamy and chewy to some extent.  D - Bitter and potent but its very drinkable. It's a tough customer and you won't be slugging this one back in any short time. Enjoy this beer in moderation and be thankful when you see the end of the glass.

It thins out slowly yet still reamins fothy.  Aroma: Big sweetness aroma a bit like molasses. Nice hop charcter to this monster of a beer. The malts ar big, bad and devious I love it. It has smoky undertones with mild alcohol notes.  Taste: Wow what a wallop this one has out of the gate. Big sweetness from the malts wtih great molasses flavor. It does slight smokiness. The mouthfeel is a little smooth with a bit of a biscuity texture. A little bit of hoppiness but mercy is this beast sweet.  Notes: This one is beastly and very devilish all in one. I'm glad I picked this one for my 100th review. If you do not respect this beast it will slay you. I recomend fearing this one to keep it from slaying you. What an absolutley kick ass beer.

Bitter, medium carbonation. There is a sweet underbelly. Definitely double bastardly, this IS and ""angry beer"". Leaves a kind of stingy bitter after taste.

147,1056,DannyS,4.08,"So far, I've been wowed by Arrogant Bastard and disappointed by Ruination. Time to try the big bad Double Bastard.  Served in a pint glass, poured from a 22 oz. bomber.  A - An almost opaque dark amber with a big, tan pillow of foam that sticks around forever and leaves lots of lacing.  S - Malty sweet, short but sharp alcohol bite on the nose. Toffee, pine, caramel, grapefruit, and so much more assault the sinuses. I take points off for lack of intensity. Gets very fruity on the nose when it warms up.  T - A substantial deal more bitter than regular Arrogant Bastard. Lots of big malt/sugary sweetness once again intermingling with strong hop/coffee-like bitterness. It's unrelenting, all over the place, and in your face, but I can totally respect that. Sweetness really comes through and the bitterness mellows when it warms up, rewarding my persistent palate with lots of sugary love.  M - Excellent level of carbonation gives some lightness of body to this thick, heavy brew.  D - Negligible alcohol burn and great flavor countered by a powerful ABV and lots of bitterness. Still very drinkable, but will tide you over for the whole day if you decide to have a whole bomber by yourself.  Overall - I can't really tell if I like this better than AB or not. Both are uncompromising powerhouses of flavor and dangerously drinkable. As the bottle clearly says, it's not for the faint of heart. It might not even be for the fairly stout of heart, as I'm learning right now. I'll defeat this one like I did the others, but this one put up one hell of a fight.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

It is a total mix depending which hits you first. Wow this has a lot of flavors hitting you. It sweet, but yet that changes to tangy and hoppy within a second. Has its own presence about itself. Has light carbination, good mouthfeel. Has a strong finish. Has a heavy body. The textureis thick like you could eat it with a spoon.

Appears a cloudy deep dark copper color with about an inch of frothy, sticky off white foam. Tastes and smells of toasted, roasted, and caramelized malts, bitter piney hops, hint of orange, grapefruit, and lemon and a touch of bittersweet chocolate. Pretty tasty and complex stuff. Bordering on full bodied with medium carbonation.

147,1056,GonzoPizzaBurger,4.75,"Double Bastard = Liquid glory. Poured into a pint glass from a 22oz brown bomber with a red and white gargoyle mirrored image on the front.  A- Beautiful. My kind of beer.Thick frothy 2 finger creamy white head over a full bodied dark-reddish amber brew. Sticky lacing with great retention, microbubbles dance on the top.  S- Sweet malt and sugar, alcohol, burnt chocolate and a whiff or refreshing fruity hops. In that order.  T- Incredible, very complex. Smooth beginning that gives off a lot of sweetness to be immediately followed by a welcoming hop bitterness that does not allow the sweetness of this one to get carried away. The alcohol is masked by the balance of all of these wonderful flavors. They linger on the palate a while after drinking, and I can't complain!  M- Sticky, almost syrupy, taste definitely lingers on tongue. A bit tingly from the huge 10.5 abv.  D- Don't think I could drink anything else after this one, very strong, complex brew that I would pair with a giant slab of ribs with drenched in sbr's bbq sauce. Or as a night cap.

Can really taste the high alcohol in this. Slightly sweet, strong toasted malt, coffee and alcohol aftertaste. Not getting the citrus and hops like others have reviewed. Disappointing!  M- Full bodied, velvety, silky smooth with fine carbonation. Really nice.  D- High ABV and you can taste it from start to finish. One of these is about all I would want.

147,1056,NittanyBeerFan,4.28,"Pours a hazy garnet with some coarse bubbly head into a tulip glass. Nice thick rings of foam cling to the sides of the glass over the entire duration of the beer.  Smell is malty with some plum, date, and fig character combined with the signature west coast strong-hopped ale scent that you can expect from anything Stone.  Sweet malts fight with tangy citrus and piney hops for dominance. The malts effectively take over the front on my palate. In the middle the fruits develop quickly enhancing the flavor considerably. The beer finishes with a perfect amount of hop bitterness to balance the malts before the take over.  Full texture and a good amount of carbonation with some really impressive character. The flavor is nicely balanced, and you are left satisfied and content. Not a sessioner in the traditional meaning of the term, but I could drink these all night",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,hophead247,4.32,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass..Big strong citrusy hop aroma with caramel, sweet thick malt aroma. A touch of alcohol also noticeable. Dense tan head that recedes slowly and coats the sides of the glass very nicely. Roasted malts hit first followed by a quick hit of sweet caramel and then the big hop flavor. Plenty of supporting maltiness and huge bitterness. Alcohol comes to the fore toward the finish before being subsumed with hop flavor and bitterness. Long after you've finished drinking you'll still taste the lingering hops. Body is quite full with smooth creamy mouthfeel. This one is over the top in all regards. If you like big, strong, hoppy, bitter yet malty and sweet beer, this one is a must.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,NickMunford,3.81,"A - 2008 bottle poured into Stone's Double Bastard specialty glass. Pours a very nice, deep amber color. Very thin, off-white head with no retention. Probably a result of the shallow glass.  S - Has woody aromas, with hints of a grapefruit like citrus in the background. The smell reminds me of a barley wine.  T - The woody aromas come through when you drink it. Has a good amount of bitterness, but not a hoppy bitterness. It also has hints of the grapefruit/citrus taste in the background, just like the smell.  M - Feels relatively thick and smooth in the mouth, apart from the bitterness, which lasts as an aftertaste.  D - Double Bastard always changes year to year as far as drinkability goes. The 2008 version is more drinkable to me than previous editions. I'd go so far as saying this one is more drinkable than Arrogant Bastard. Still definitely not one you could throw back with ease, but you don't have to ""work"" to get through it either.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,BringusKilkenney,4.46,Poured from bottle to pint glass. Has a nice brown color with a slight off white head. When held to the light has a nice golden brown color.  Has a decent smell this is probably the only weak point of the brew. Hops and carmel and some slight fruits but the overwhelming smell is alcohol.  The taste is the best part for me. Definite hop bitterness followed by wonderful sweet caramel. Can pick up just a bit of citrus as with most ipa brews. I immensely enjoy the burnt toast aftertaste along with the dry hop flavor it leaves.  Mouthfeel is great smooth and light with a bit of carbonation.

147,1056,steelerguy,4.68,"A - Deep amber color, translucent, nice just off white two finger head, nice level of carbonation. Head remained throughout but did fade to a thin coating on the top and left some nice lacing on the glass. Have never seen a better looking beer.  S - Strong and sweet malt aroma with more pine and citrus hop presence. The alcohol makes itself known to the nose, but not with violence.  T - Awesome caramel malt flavors up front, bit of citrus sweetness but not at all cloying. The hop bitterness hits at the same time you feel the alcohol warmth. Warmth continues as you swallow and then the hop bitterness increases in a nice smooth manner. Complex, makes you want more, so much to taste but at 10.5% you will only get so many tastes!  M - So smooth, there is a viscous quality to this that lets you know you are drinking a big beer. Really warms the mouth and throat and the tingle from the carbonation is perfect. Jeez...another 5, this beer is pissing me off...  D - Although this beer tastes quite excellent and looks so nice, put me down for only one bomber in a night. 22 oz. of this bad boy are perfect anymore and you sense will be left numb and I don't think you could really appreciate much more. 22 oz. of drinkability but not much more.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Some retention, some lacing.  S - Toffee and hazelnut sweetness and semi-sweet chocolate create the backbone for this surprisingly balanced aroma. Coffee like roasted bitterness balances it out, with a bite pineapple bite. Textbook for style.  T/M - Again picking up toffee and chocolate in the malt, which is rendered very mild after the huge hopping that followed. Quite fruity, with lots of pineapple and some strawberry. Finishes very bitter, with some lingering espresso. Mouthfeel is almost barleywine-esque.  D - Have to say, this is by far the best Stone product I've had so far.

147,1056,Oxymoron,4.12,"Double Bastard is one of those beers that is best to try fresh rather than aged. Or at least IMHO. Pours a mostly darker amber color with a reddish hue throughout. Mostly cloudy with a fuzzy white head with limited retention and lacing through the tasting.  The nose is malty with big melanodian and kettle caramel notes. A bit sugary but more from a super long boil more than brown sugar. Very much boozy, a bit much even for the ABV. Some yeast notes as well with some light oxidation and sherry notes. Some lighter esters, plums and figs mostly. Very hoppy for style, but ok for a US Strong Ale. Noticeable citrus and piney notes.  The taste is similar. Very malty upfront with a super kettle caramel flavor. This is mixed with a sugary kettle flavor as well. (side note, as it ages mixes with a sherry oxidation which gives it a bourbon/butyric thing). The yeast is light versus the nose but the fusel/alcohol notes really come out. Almost to the point I would call it under pitching. Some minor oxidation but nit picking. The malt lingers into the finish with a very nice plume, pineapple mix. When fresh a noticeable hop presence with a good blend of bitterness and finishing hops. Some citrus and noticeable pine at that end. This of course is limited as ages.  The body is big and sweet. Add the fusel/alcohol notes I lean towards miss treatment of yeast. But not exactly under attenuated and fusels do age out. Overall a marketing beer that is second to none. But for me this is a boarderline US Barleywine with some issue but fantastic caramel notes.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,Docer,4.32,"Thanks to alexd3891 for the trade.. now for the review.. 2008 release. Another to age in the fridge!  - Dark foggy brown ale look... minimal to no head.. lacing all about. Makes me worried to drink... it looks kind of scary!  - Rich chocolate and caramel liquor scent... wow it smells good. Slight bitter notes, sweet... and alcohol.. tad boozy.  - Ok... here we go..  Wow.. strong malt backbone for sure.. slight bittering hop, but boy oh boy this is a strong strong ale.. caramel delight.. thick, creamy and fantastic. Slight alcohol taste.. but more of a burn than anything. 1 bottle and then I am done. Great taste in the belch too.  - Not a bad aftertaste at all... not very dry.. only slightly chewy.. little bitter and dusty.  - Very drinkable.. could have a frosty pint of this any time.. for me it's one to have ice cold.  ---  '06 again from alexd3891, as well as an '07 which will be below. I am not changing my original score... as sofar I liked the '08 the best. (around 12-04-09)  - Dark hazy brown... a murky mud puddle... fluffy mocha head.. down to a bit of lace.  - Robust caramel malt, slight oxidization... still a presence of pine hops.... interesting, and yet smells balanced.  - Flavor is smooth, and not at all boozy.... the strength sneaks up on your tongue, and then hits you with a malt bashing long after its swallowed. Little bit funky and oxidized though. Perhaps the '06 should have been had in '08.  - Slightly heavy bodied... little bit rich, and not too puckering at all... smooth, great carbonation...  - Quite drinkable, but one you would have to be more in the mood for than a fresh one, which puts you in the mood.  ---  '07 (12-11-09)  - Super hazy and cloudy red/amber... not much head... quickly down to a rather large continent of drifting foam and a nice ring of white.  - Thick super sweet malts in smell... toffee, brown sugar.... and chewy caramel candies. Is this a desert bastard? Little hops present... perhaps a faded citrus nose.  - One smooth crisp candied malt goodness.... must be at its prime... and still a bitter hop punch to the gut... rather balanced, smooth.... only slightly chalky and ashy.... but the toffee, and caramel is quite nice.  - Thick, medium to heavy body, great carbonation, and rather smooth. Slightly dry and oily.  - Very drinkable... perhaps just a little past its prime. Sofar I liked the '08 with about 6+ months on it. May drink the rest of my '09's from 6 months to 1.5 years on it.  ---  09' (not reviewing fresh)",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

It is becoming more and more available then it used to be and from what I learned from a Stone Brewing rep that they ship it out in the fall time. This might have changed since then. Found it at the Canal's in Hamilton Square off of rt 130.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,BarrelO,3.7,"22oz bomber poured into a goblet. 2008 edition. At this time last year, I couldn't find any of the 2007 in my neck of the woods. I guess times really are tough all around.  Side note: I don't see the point of classifying this as an American Strong Ale. I can see how it makes sense for Arrogant Bastard, which really doesn't fit into any other style classification. But as far as I'm concerned, this is indistinguishable from a barleywine. If there are any relevant differences, I am unable to detect them.  A: Dark brownish red. Hardly any head.  S: The malt and hops come together in a way that is almost reminiscent of chocolate.  T: In the past, the hoppiness has been a bit too harsh for me, so I decided to let it warm up more than I usually do in the hopes that it would calm down a bit. Doing so provided me with further ammunition for my ""DB=barleywine"" theory. It tasted pretty much the same as Bell's Third Coast Old Ale, but a bit worse. In fact, it became a bit of a chore to drink once I reached the second half of the bottle.  M: Acceptably thick without too much carbonation to get in the way.  D: I like Stone, but this just didn't work for me. In fact, it's kind of striking how OG manages to be both bigger and more drinkable. This is easily my least favorite of the Bastards. I haven't officially reviewed the other two yet, but I'd rank them as follows: Oaked, Arrogant, Double. Now, an Oaked Double Bastard...that's something I wouldn't mind checking out.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Wackyfoot,4.23,"Until I drank this beer I didn't realize that I was such a masochist...I'm glad that Stone is out there to teach me such valuable life lessons. Dark brown pour with a thick and frost head with nice lacing left behind. Big citrus and caramel aroma with a similar flavor. Alcohol very prominent, but not unpleasantly so. Always a fun beer to trick your friends into drinking without being properly prepared!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,callmescraps,4.15,"Have heard fantastic things about this one, and knew where I could get my hands on one.  Appearance - Very nice. A reddish brown color. An inch or so of nice off-white, yellowish head. Very nice looking beer. Almost maple syrup looking, but nice and clear.  Smell - Lots of candy sugar smell. With a real booze kicker. Almost vanilla. Very sweet. Not picking up as much hops as some say, but I do get a sense of the sweet citrus lingering in the background.  Taste - Holy sweet caramel malt! Holy tangy grapefruit and piney hops! Holy booze! Um, it's interesting. The caramel malt really comes with it. It has a nice roasted flavor. Almost coffee-ish, but more of a nice roast. The hops are more prevalent in taste than they were in smell. But it's pretty boozy on the finish, especially as it warms. The aftertaste is sweet booziness.  Mouthfeel - A little thick. It's kind of foamy, coating the whole mouth.  Drinkability -Hard to gauge. I'm enjoying it. But it's got a lot of alcohol. It's pretty potent. Not sure I'd want another one, that's for sure.  This is a pretty good beer. It's very interesting, and an unusual balance. It's also got a big booze kick. It's strong and pretty damned tasty. Glad I've tried it, but not necessarily my all-time favorite.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,cavedave,5,"HEY! Pssst. Yes, Stone Double Bastard! I have given this brew the highest rating.  It pours an incredibly thick ruby amber. I hold it to the light. This beer is alive. Fifty degrees and it breathes in my glass. My nose is no where near the glass, but its aroma has found me since I opened the bottle.  The nose is alcohol wrapped through the finest malts' best preserved fragrances. It infiltrates the senses with a morphing mix of intoxicating aroma. It finds the deepest recesses of the nose and tongue. I can taste it in my eyes.  The first sip. WOW! It jolts a massive blast of malt, the finest malt, you know it right away, its full range of tones, that flavor which changes as it runs into the finish, running through bread, caramel, alcohol, through herbal ecstacy, and crests into a wave of balanced bitterness, a swirl of citrus, herbs, alcohol, earth, an amazing mix.  The alcohol is massive in DB. Usually I rate less well if I get a large alcohol presence, especially in strong ales, I'm an English style old ale lover. But here the craft of the brewer is magnificent, the vapor of it sends the swirling milieu of flavor perfectly into a river of changing delight, climaxing in an incredibly long finish that lingers until the next sip, be that sip ten minutes later. It is an achievement, a masterpiece, I can't give higher praise for this champion, imho, of this style. I hope to taste a better one than this, but I doubt I will.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,bum732,4.2,"2008 release  Pours a hazy orange red, great bubbly head leaving fantastic lacing. Smells of grapefruit hops, other tropical fruits, caramel malt, earthiness . Huge caramel malt up front followed quickly by a shotgun to the face of piney and grapefruity hops. Some tropical fruit sweetness is present along with quite of bit of earthiness. Bitterness is very pronounced, almost acidic. Finishes sweet with a hop twang, alcohol pretty noticeable. Good carbonation, but im sure its faded a little since i aged this.  An enormous beer, this baby will kick your ass. Huge malt profile accompanied by a huge hop profile. I'm amazed by the one-two of all malt then all hop, very unique. Extremely smooth and drinkable, unlike the 120 minute. I would love to try this fresh as i'm sure there would be a great hop aroma that isn't present here. Definitely recommend, definitely a sipper.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,ALESwhatCURESya,4.31,"What a great beer to sip as I pack and get ready for a trip to the dominican republic. This 2008 batch pours out a deep rusty amber color with a slightly off-white head. Lacing is quite impressive as it clings to my Delirium snifter. Slight sediment at the bottom of the bottle. The aroma candy-like with strong notes of caramelized sugars and hop spiciness. A little more subdued than I expected, but pleasant. The taste brings together a sense of IPA meets barleywine in a harmonious blend. The richness of the malts and the sharpness of the hops comes together wonderfully, but not at all unbalanced. Unlike others in this style that lean to heavy towards the hops, this one pulls in multitudes of depth while remaining tethered. The mouthfeel is slightly thinner than I would guess for a beer of this nature and statue. The hoppiness leaves a pleasant dryness to the, otherwise sweet, body. Drinkability is truly lethal on this. At 10.5%, it is tough to realize how strong it is until it is too late. Well done and superbly crafted.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,robbyc1,4.13,"Cloudy amber, nice highlights, with solid 1 1/2 off white head, great lace all the way down.  Smell has fresh hop nose, spicy, amarillo or similar hops. Nothing special just nice.  A hop bite up front, with a solid backbone of maltiness, and a slight alcohol burn at the finish, strong ale for sure, not quite a barleywine as some have said. I've had the Arrogant Bastard which I think I like just as much as this one. Both are nicely balanced. Maybe I was simply expecting more here. It has a good not great strong ale flavor, much easier drinkability than it should at 10%.  The mouthfeel is a bit light, and the finish is very nicely balanced between spicy dry and sweet. Intriguing. I'm going to say that this stands up to Bells Old Ale, but I'd take Bell's over this.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,ThatWineGuy,4.32,"This bottle was transported by car about a week ago and, from the look of it, it hasn't quite settled down yet. There is a murky, reddish-brown hue to it with minute suspended particles that suggest plum puree to me. The head is fleeting but a thin veil remains atop the prune-like nectar. The smell is big hoppy, spirited, caramel, sweet toffee ... very reminiscent of a barleywine. The taste is similarly BIG with layers of caramel, heat in the mouth, sour dark fruit, very long drawn out aftertaste with flashes of bitter, malty liquer, more caramel, more malt. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth but, for me, the alcohol remains front and center. The label says, in part, ""not to be wasted on the tentative or weak"" and it makes me wonder where I fit in ... it's almost too much for me. Barleywines have never been my favourite beerstyle although I respect them and, in this case, the 10 per cent ABV is reasonably well kept in check. But make no mistake, a strong ale like this is never to be taken lightly; I've been sipping my half of the big bottle for well over an hour and while I'm appreciating it more as I go along, I'd be loathe to recommend this to a novice. For the experienced beer lover, this pushes the envelope big time and it's a trip you owe yourself: complex, thrilling, entertaining and not soon to be forgotten.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,biegaman,4.42,"2007 Vintage - sampled 17/03/09  Raw sienna and burnt umber combine (along with a splash of clamato) to make for a very murky yet extraordinarily gradient colour scheme. In fact, the beer fragments into many different tones when held into the light, this outpouring of colour is radiant and bright despite the dismal clarity. Head is minimal but signs of carbonation are quite apparent (and sticky).  Prepare to have your nose barraged by an onslaught of succulently sweet malts and an enormous eruption of bitter, resiny hops. This has as much caramel *and* as much pine serum as is likely possible to find in a beer, not to mention the sheer amount of grapefruit. I'm always impressed by beers that can manage to be both extremely hoppy and malty. I'd probably rupture a 'pleasure gland' if there was such a thing...  This hoppy/malty concoction is deliciously tasty. There is a giant flaring up of dark fruity notes (plum, currants, red grapes, figs) as well as sugary confectioneries (brittle, truffles, sweets and sticky toffee pudding). The suggestion of cinnamon and nutmeg combine with the above to resemble plum pudding. The hops also impart distant but discernible notes of citrus.  Despite all these fireworks of flavour, the beer's composure and alcohol content never rupture. It is smooth, mellowed, and deceitful about its real strength. Some of this may have to do with the bottle's age although not all. The people at Stone definitely deserve credit for disguising such a big, aggressive-minded beer as something so ripe, softened and mellow.  Don't listen to that write up - go home with a bottle whether you feel worthy or not. If you are worthy you'll certainly appreciate it and if you aren't, you soon will be. Double Bastard is at least twice as good as most beers on the shelves. A beer like this really raises one's standards about what they put in their body and how they choose to spend their money.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Stunner97,4.82,"Appearance- Nice thick white foamy head, with dark brown beer with slight carbonation and bubbles that can be seen on the edge of the glass, relatively clear in body and can be seen through  Smell- Beautiful sweet strong malty nose, lots of caramel and molasses just rip out of this beer, very sweet sugary nose, slight hops, and maybe slight hints of a milk chocolate,  Taste- thick creamy flavor at the jump off, lots of sweet sugar and malts lead off the early taste, similar to nose to lots of sugar, malts, caramel, and even hits of chocolates smash you up front deliciously, on the finish though you get that ever so slight bitter hops that slowly and slightly build up, an amazing beer with very complex flavors that would be interpeted different by people on each taste, good slight bitterness on finish matches sweet start  Mouthfeel- Very very very soft, creamy smooth and definitely heavy bodied, though so soft it has illusion of light, a nice beauty of a mouth feel  Drinkability- Scarily drinkable considering the 10.5 percent alcohol, its so soft smooth and delicious you want more and more with each sip, a classic beer to me, one to savor each sip, I could find a flaw what so ever in this beer to be honest, so well rounded and yet so complex, hard to put into words just how good this beer is, infact i feel me trying to describe it now isnt doing it justice, if you like the regular bastard try the double its like the ultra reserve of whats already a reserve, enjoy! you wont regret it!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,dismal,4.45,"Pours a very dark red, brown color. Produces about a two finger head that goes down quick but leaves plenty of lacing down the glass. The aroma is a little hoppy but the hops don't jump out, and the smell is also kind of sweet like caramel. The taste is great, very smooth and sweet. It's hoppy but not extremely hoppy which I do like but in this case not extremely hoppy is really good. It has a bit of bitterness to it and overall the taste is great. For such a high alcohol content it's masked very nicely and I could easily and would love to drink a couple of these.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,clayrock81,4.05,"Poured a murky brown body that had a two-finger offwhite head taht died slowly and left lace down the glass. The smell is strong and simply put, it is a mix of sweet malts and floral hops that I will dwelve into in the taste. Smooth and creamy is my first impression of this almost full-bodied beer. There are malt notes in the taste like caramel, roasted and maybe even some toasted/burny malts (could be coffee) that mix with a strong dose of citric and floral hops (this is the Stone brewery afterall). It leads to a drying, somewhat tastebud killing, sweet and nutty taste mixed with fruits and the ABV makes itself appreciated on the backend as there is a minor warming, alkie burn as you finish this. Bottom line, this beer encompasses both extreme sweet and roasted malts and bitter hop sensations for a complex beer that at 10.5% ABV gave me a buzz after one bomber (and is dangerous b/c I killed the bomber quick it was so good).",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,CrossansWright,4.53,"This beer will make you rethink your life. I read the back of the bottle while watching television and felt like I was committing some sort of heresy against the Brewing Gods. Those Stone guys are so arrogant that one might feel completely undeserving of even a sip of their beer. Their commitment to making quality beer and letting the customer know about it combined with the sexiest bottle out there makes this a good experience before you even open the bottle. Now, on to the beer. It pours a nice copper color with an off-white head that didn't hang around too long and didn't leave much lacing; coulda been the lighting, but I thought it was a bit hazy also. Smells of alcohol and citrus, kinda sweet in a liquor sort of way. Extremely full mouthfeel, each sip felt like more than it actually was. Taste is of strong alcohol and hop bitterness with a peppery bite at the back of the throat. The malt takes over towards the end. I know this is lacking in description, but its a very delicious beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,SykDoc,4.31,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. It appears a deep reddish-brown/amber that is clear. A tan head forms to about 1/4 inch and reduces to a full coverage lacing. No sediment and the carbonation is visible.  The smell was a bit disappointing. I just didn't get much and actually asked my wife to give it a smell too, which she agreed. There is a fair level of piney hops and malt behind it.  The taste was quite different from the aroma. It is powerful with a nice level of hops up front with pine and citrus and a spicy component in the middle. There is a good malt backbone with some sweetness that is also present quickly at the initial taste. The alcohol is definitely noticeable.  The mouthfeel is very good also. This a medium/full bodied. There is a great level of carbonation that highlights the flavor. It doesn't feel too sticky and goes down quite smooth.  Overall, I really liked this beer. The smell could have been more potent to me. Everything else was very good. It could have had a bit more malt to the taste and drinkability is only hindered by the strength of alcohol and taste.

Not all bitter, kind of fruity as well.  T: Holy crap, what a smack in the mouth! Sweet maltiness up front leads to a fruity hop bitterness. It all blends together in the back nicely and ends with an alcohol burn. Nothing overpowering, but noticeable. Aftertaste reveals a hint of banana, which is pretty nice.

So she pours a lot like AB but the head doesn't stay around quite so long, this is alright, I blame it on the booze. The smell is hops in the front, malt in the back, not quite so much as the original...what I want to know is, where is the alcohol? The taste is good, extremely balanced, almost too balanced to be called Double Bastard. The original smacks you in the face, this one holds your hand and tells you that you're pretty. I guess I like the abuse a little better. The mouthfeel is perfect, excellent carbonation, a rounded bitterness and just enough body. All of these factors combine to completely hide the alcohol.

Hops are fruity and very present and add to the wonderful sweet aroma. Slightly metallic aroma is a little off putting, but I really don't know what to make of it, its strange like a handful of bloody pennies.  Flavor is intense alcoholic malt. Malt is sweet and substantial. Hops are bitter and almost astringent, strong as hell, I don't know if I would like this one fresh if this has layed down for a year. Hops are piney, peppery and resinous with an intense hit of oil. The alcohol is very present on this beer, it has a very warm hit to it. Wow, the alcohol flavors almost overpower everything else.

Hey, what do you know? A beer from Stone that's actually getting close to being balanced. The hops still dominate, as usual, but it's closer. This has an underlying sweet malty profile that, for once, is actually putting up a good effort to get noticed. Mild caramel and sweet malt taste. Pine and grapefruit notes. Slight bitterness. Not nearly as harsh as Arrogant Bastard.  Smooth and basically creamy. Just a slight touch of sharpness. Nice lower medium level of carbonation.  I have to say that, being from Stone (who I actually like, despite how it may sound), this is a pretty darn drinkable beer.

147,1056,PerzentRizen,4.57,"What a great beer by Stone. I ended up having this one with some great Mexican food. I also let a miller lite drinker have a taste - that look was priceless.  Poured into a Duvel glass from a 22 oz bomber at around 45 degrees. The color is a slightly hazy burnt amber color. The head is off white with large bubbles. This looks like an ale from any old English movie (I don't know why I mention this except that it's the first thing that came to mind).  The smell is so full and complex. It's amazing to have such a huge aroma. I can usually tell when a beer is going to have that oily hop character and I thought I was picking that up. It's like a resiny hop floral that is very heavy in the nose. There is also plenty of malt backbone.  The first taste is like a punch in the mouth. This beer is huge and extremely complex. The oily, hoppy flavor is very rich. If this weren't so tart and bitter (in a good way) it could alost be decatant enough for dessert (I had to have a Ten Fidy for dessert by the way).  The mouthfeel is velvety. I would say that the aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel all closely resemble Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner. I wonder if I'm the only one to think this. I love it!  Drinkability is a tough one to grade. On one hand I ended up drinking this bomber by myself and I loved it. I could and would drink another if I had it. On the other hand it is ten and a half percent and a huge beer with tons of flavor. Do you really need two or more...absolutely not.

The brew is a slightly foggy, deep amber.  Smell from the glass - very interesting combination of hops and malts ... smelling sweet malts here!  Taste - um, holy crap. Hops for sure, but not bitter ... the smoothest tasting hop flavor greets you in the beginning, then the malts make an entrance, and it's sheer joy; a party on your palate. It's paired with such a delicious blend of malts ... the balance is stunning. Really.  The mouthfeel is thick, silky ... silky ... silky. Did I mention that the mouth is silky?  Drinkability. Well, pace yourself ... don't be a fooo! Relish this brew ... don't think you're entering into this relationship without any responsibility. Relax. Enjoy. Savor, every ounce.  This brew lives up to its billing. It's creation is the result of the tender care of true artisans.  The only other brew that I have rated at ""perfection"" is Ommegang's Abbey Ale.  I understand that a perfect score is reserved for truly exceptional brews. Well, I can see no good reason to deny this one a perfect score. And, I believe that the truly exceptional brews should be recognized as such, and duly rewarded.  Bravo!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The malt, however, remains intact and give the hops a solid backbone. Flavors are nicely layered and well balanced.  M: Full bodied and creamy, with moderate to low carbonation.  Drinkability: Another incredible winner from Stone, this was as impressive as it's reputation. I've had most of Stone's biggies (IPA, RIS, Bastard) and I can say I'm officially a huge fan and have yet to be disappointed.

Seemed to almost glow when held up to a light. The head slowly dropped to a skim and held on all the way down, leaving a fair amount of sticky web lace down the glass.  S= This was a heady mix of caramel, hops, and alcohol. Deceptively simple yet rich and sophisticated. Very aromatic and delicious smelling.  T= The taste started out with a rich caramelly sweet malt base, followed by a spicy and bitter West Coast hop profile. The finish dried out considerably and lead into a pleasantly intense alcohol and hop aftertaste. Nice throat/chest/belly warming sensations in the finish too.  MF= Heavier side of medium bodied with a perfect, mildly crisp yet slick mouthfeel.  D= It seems too obvious to say, but this is really just a bigger version of the regular Arrogant Bastard Ale...and I mean that as a compliment. Same great taste, just intensified a bit and with higher alcohol presence. Despite the unflinching alcohol presence, this is still a damned drinkable ale.

Though it's an American Strong Ale, it reminds me of a barley wine pour.  I sense an aroma of sweetness right after the pour. Black cherry and raisins come to mind.  On initial sip I get a spicy jolt which quickly turns into a creamy, velvet smooth taste. There is a faint aftertaste but not distracting or displeasing.

The smell is very hoppy. Is a bit floral and a bit sweet with malt but also has a bastard of a smell that I can not place. It is the signature smell of the Arrogant Bastard brew.  The taste is strong, it is at first sip a little citrusy, has a great hanging aftertaste that is reminding me that this is a true to form craft beer. Is very creamy and is a bit flavorful than the orignal bastard.  This beer has a nice finish. It has a nice bite but is not overwhelming in it's texture.

Smells pretty good, mostly sweet malts.  Tastes very good. I missed all the piney hops that other reviewers mentioned. This beer tasted very much like an English Barleywine - malty, sweet with the most prominent taste being caramel malts. Somewhere along the line, there is a bit of Belgian dark fruit in the mix.  Mouthfeel is incredibly rich and smooth. There is no alcohol burn like many barleywines of the same abv.  Drinkability is good...too good.

The taste is an all out assault on all fronts. Hops pierce the tongue in a million tiny darts of piny floral wonderfulness. Malt rules with a deep caramel and molasses sweetness, backed by an overburnt coffee bitter tang. Some fruity tones balance all and leave you wanting more. After the swallow, the throbbing burn of the hops is matched by the warm glow of the malt sweetness. The alcohol glow is noticeable and welcome. A 10.5abv that drinks like a 6.

147,1056,scootny,4.68,From the 2007 batch. Carefully and lovingly cellared  A light brown red with a light tan head. This is a paradigm American Strong Ale. Generous head with accompanying retention and lacing. Clarity is inviting and lovely. Retention and lacing are exemplary.  Aroma is an intoxicating blend of caramel malts and burnt sugars. My snifter is a receptacle of beer porn. Sweet and roasted. Floral and piney. Deep and rich like hot chocolate. Taste is big smooth malts with a huge grapefruit and pine blend that makes it all drink like a neighborhood lager at the corner bar. Feel is somewhat heavy and syrupy. Superb carbonation is microfine and omnipresent. It allows what should be too much to become exemplary.Drinkability is the benchmark for the style. If you take the glass to your lips you are warned.

The malts taste are the first thing to jump out. Biscuits and caramel. Hops are secondary as a dark fruit, shmuckers jam kick. Mouth feel is fairly light with light carbonation. It's very drinkable as a 10.5% beer. The intense malts might become a little overwhelming if I had too many of these.  Overall, I'm glad I tried this beer.

Taste: A very strong malted taste with citrus, pine and floral esters. There is a touch of sweetness and some fruitiness.  Overall: The mouth feel is astringent and slightly carbonated. A medium finish that is bitter by hops. This beer is huge there is a lot going on with such a few ingredients. There is subtle sweetness but you really can't tell the alcohol is in the beer.

Phenolic qualities are evident, as is the ""burnt sugar"" taste.  M - Creamier than expected, balances out the hops and bitterness brought on by carbonation. Very smooth finish.

147,1056,ncstateplaya,4.13,"It pours a beautiful dark amber that is actually pretty hazy. A great almond colored head that seemed extremely frothy, and looked great next to the amber ale. The head receeds to about 1/8"" and leaves abundant lacing.  The hops were dominant in the nose. It smelled fruity, but I wouldn't say citrusy...more like pears or apricots. It was actually a very inviting smell.  I thought this beer tasted pretty woodsy and bitter. Pine flavors are right there with the bitterness. An eye opening taste would be a good explanation. The alcohol is detectable, but minimal compared to what I was expecting @ 10.5 ABV.  The bitterness lasts well beyond the smooth swallow. It has a nice puckering and drying effect. My mouth is definitely waiting for the next quenching rinse. My mouth is dry and my tongue has a slight arousal, tingle from the carbonation.  This beer is very drinkable. The alcohol will be your limiting factor. I can easily say that I would be drunk before I got my fill of this well crafted ale.

The hop is mild and flowery by comparision. Malts are deep, rich and bittersweet. Dark and rich. As it warms, bitter hops really push through.  The mouthfeel is chewy and thick.

Appearance/Smell - Appears hazy clouded amber with lite-medium carbonation, little head that reduces quickly to a ring & leaves no lacing. Smells of very dry and floral hops, very aromatic with a touch of alcohol. Some grape and pine aroma with some burnt malts. Very pleasant!  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of lots of dry floral hops, lots of burnt biscuit like bitterness lingers on the palate. Some citrus flavor is present with little sweetness. Alcohol is definitely present, but more so as it warms. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, thick and full bodied.  Drinkablility/Final thoughts - This beer is very, very delicious and rich, but to me, there wasn't to much complexity to it. Just lots of intense floral hops with allot of burnt biscuit like aftertaste, which isn't bad! I'm just making a point, I also think because of the high ABV, its allot less drinkable.

147,1056,RunDWP,4.41,"If just one Bastard isn't enough, here's Double Bastard.  What's wrong here? I expected this to punch me in the mouth with a bunch of strong flavors and alcohol. After a long tough week, I was ready for a beer to completely knock me out, so to speak. So I crack this one open and what happens? This Double Bastard SOB caressed my palate, sang a lullaby my taste buds, danced the waltz with my tongue, or whatever silly metaphor you want to use. This stuff was lovely.  Not that it didn't have strong flavors. It kicks in with plenty of caramel malt, with a woody, earthy flavor that has some maple and bourbon. Hard to really identify the flavor notes, but it was all good. It finishes with a balanced resin-like hops. As it warms, the flavor balance changes, but the great news is that the flavor simply changes, the brew doesn't start tasting odd or going out of whack. That simply added to the enjoyment.  At 10.5%, you can taste the alcohol. Frankly, if you couldn't taste some alcohol in a brew called Double Bastard, something would definitely be wrong.  Looked great in my tulip, pouring a deep, copper brown color and a sturdy, foamy tan head, and lots of sheeting action on the glass. Little weak in the aroma department, I just wasn't picking up much besides a little woody earthiness.  I've said it before and I'll say it again: These brews works when the strong flavors are blended and balanced skillfully and with care.

Has this wonderful toffee, sweet, dark pit fruit aroma, that draws you in!  A nice, full body and smooth, thick mouthfeel, with just a spritz of carbonation drags a bashing of citrus hop bitterness, with notes of cherries and other dark fruits. An underlying malt sweetness is mostly masked by the powerful hop presence.

The palate follows the nose, only the hops become the dominate flavor, and the alcohol warmth asserts itself as well, perhaps a bit too much. Long bitter lingering finish. Medium bodied and a pleasant motuhfeel.  This beer is a touch hot, which is fine for an after-dinner drink, but it may not be malty enough to be used exclusively as a sipper in my opinion.

The alcohol is well hidden but it can catch up with you fast at 10.5%,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Seanibus,4.08,"This is one strong Bastard.  Pours a deep reddish, slightly hazy, with a huge, thick, fluffy head that lasts a long time and leaves rich lacing. The smell is thick, non-specifically hoppy, and slightly sticky sweet. It is so rich it almost has a milk-like quality, like the aroma of some kind of unholy hop milkshake. The flavor is malty and raisiny with a strong bite of alcohol, almost like a creamy brandy. There is a vast bite of hop in here, but what exactly it is, or how to describe it's character, isn't clear. There is a vast, slow developing bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is heavy and creamy, with a bitter cling on the end.  This is a good beer, enjoyable on a lot of level, but not perfect. It is for sipping slowly and savoring. The sting of alcohol somewhat limits its appeal.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Nice lacing and big, shiny, rainbow-mirror, soapy bubbles.  Smells malty, with a spicy, acidic citrus/ hoppy/ pine bark smell. some alcohol lingers in the aftershock.  Taste - really tough to describe. I can sense some of the same from the nose, citrus, hops, but there's something else at work here. Honestly, and I don't care how crazy it sounds, I can taste burnt pumpkin seeds and leather. Not the taste of leather, but the aroma of a leather jacket captured in a beer. Nutz, I know.  Nice Carbonation with a thin mouthfeel. Good even body throughout, alcohol snuck up towards the end.  Sadly, this is really not my type of beer. It's a great beer, it's just not my beer. I somewhat enjoyed the regular, and was over the moon with the Oak, but I just didn't enjoy this one.

Watch out when you drink this, it sneaks up on you like a hammer to the head! smooth and malty with awesome hoppy finish and aftertaste. Lots of alcohol warming but it mysteriously isnt felt in the mouth, leaves a great aftertaste lingering on the pallet.

Smells sweet and hoppy, with floral hops, flowers, citrus hops, orange peel, caramel, sweet malt and booze like rum; it's sweet like a port wine, with the alcohol coming through, yet still quite hoppy.  Tastes like it smells, sweet and hoppy, with floral hops, flowers, citrus hops, orange peel, grapefruit, lemon zest, mango, pineapple, coriander, brown sugar, spices, caramel, sweet malt, syrup, grains, biscuit, dark fruit like grape or plum, and pretty noticeable alcohol like rum or a sweet liquor; the hops give way to sweetness and allow it to slide down easy. As far as strong ales go, this is quite strong yet very tasty. In fact it's always tasty and surprisingly smooth for such a powerful beer.  A very strong brew; hoppy and complex, yet enjoyable if you know what to expect from a classic Stone beer with a kick. I will have it again and enjoy it on evenings when I only want 1 beer, and that 1 beer that will do me in for the night and always impress my palette.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S: Very nice, aroma of malt, caramel and spice.  T: Starts off with a strong malt taste with brown sugar then you the warmth from the alcohol begins to take over and finishes with a nice hop citrus bitterness. Very balanced between the hops and malt.  M: Moderate carbonation and alcohol warms the mouth and goes down very easily.  D: For a high alcohol beer, I could drink these very quickly. Very nice beer.  2008 version. 22oz bottle poured into a nonic glass. Pours a deep amber reddish-brown colour with a huge off white head that sticks around for a while with a slick lace at first then sticks to the glass.  Citrus and piney with a ton of alcohol that stings the nose.  A strong brew to say the least. Citrus and piney hits you right off the bat but the bitterness is quickly mellowed out by the sweet malt. Nice and complex to say the least. Their is a burnt sugar and caramel flavor that is hidden behind the hop flavor and is kept in check by the hops. Their is almost a brandy-like warming feel on the taste buds.  This is really too smooth and creamy the only thing holding this from being an exceptional easy drinking beer is the alcohol which almost kicks you like a barleywine.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,BirdFlu,4.1,"It pours a very nice dark brown, amber with thick, foamy head which hangs around a bit. Is the same color as its brown bottle. The immediate aroma is quite hoppy. Not to the extent of, say, a DIPA, but hoppy nonetheless with just a hint of sweetness behind it. The flavor is a blend of hop and malt sweetness, but to use the word ""balance"" here is misleading.. While they are both present, the hop certainly is at the forefront and again in the aftertaste. The malt sweetness is just laying under the initial hoppiness while you swallow. The aftertaste is a little too hoppy/spicy/acidic for my liking. Mouth is moderate. A bit caramel-like, but, again, I didn't care for the aftertaste. OVerall its a nice drink.. its not really a hop beer like, again, a DIPA or such... it is quite bitter, though.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

A mellow, delicious scent full of brown sugar sweetness with a hint of alcohol. The taste is stick to your ribs licorice malt and herbal hops. A beautiful full bodied dipa type flavor with hints of chocolate and toffee sweetness. This is a gutsy brew, thoroughly satisfying, quality stuff as one expects from Stone. This is undeniable stuff. Necessarily quite drinkable!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,DRjester,3.68,"I had this as a 22oz bomber, poured into a handled pint-size mug. I took it from the refrigerator and let it warm just a bit on the counter (perhaps 10 minutes) before drinking, and then drank it over the course of about an hour.  Appearance: This is for me the strongest point of the beer; it poured cleanly, settling into a nice amber center ranging to bright red-orange on the sides, with nice highlights from the light. It had slightly more than a finger of frothy head, and kept decent lacing. Overall a very appetizing brew.  Smell: The first scent is of sweet fruit, like pineapple, followed by a toffee-like malt smell. As I inhaled a few more times, I was able to detect a subtle but firm presence of floral, earthy hop aromas, as well as a hint of alcohol. So far, so good; at this point I was pretty excited to taste this beer.  Taste: Unfortunately, this is where the beer went a little awry for me. The first taste is fairly sweet, almost like caramel, followed almost immediately by a fairly decent shot of hoppy bitterness. The background is a light but solid bready malt flavor with just a bare hint of tartness. However, the finish had a fairly strong note of grainy alcohol that soured the overall impression for me. While the beer was still somewhat chilly this aspect wasn't too pronounced, but as the brew warmed the alcohol taste grew to the point where it was almost overwhelming by the end of the beer.  Mouthfeel: The beer was full and smooth, with a good amount of carbonation but not too much. However, the relative sweetness of the malt made it come across as syrupy at times.  Drinkability: Definitely a sipper because of the high abv, this beer is enjoyable, but I would probably stick to just one. I understand that Strong Ales are going to have a fairly strong alcohol note, but I don't think the Double Bastard does a good enough job of handling that, especially as it warms. I'll put it this way; by the end, the alcohol notes came across less like a good scotch, and more like a shot of cheap whiskey.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,marcpal,4.43,"Well, here is the double the bastard, bastard the double. I had waited so long to drink my 2007 so I waited for the 2008 to have them side-by-side. One of those beers I had really looked forward to, and wasn't completely blown away but still a worthy beer by all means. I would still prefer the Oaked AB, but then again that is among my all time favorites.  22oz bottles of 07 and 08, in that order, alongside some good Indian cuisine. Poured into a Dogfish oversized snifter.  A: Ruby red color, thick and jelly look to it. Pretty dark film for the head and spotty lacing. It has the look of an oaked bastard cooked down to a syrupy consistency, but still with ample carbonation. Saw no difference in the appearance of the two editions.  S: The biggest difference is here between the two bottles, the 08 is mind numbingly sweeter. The mango subtle sweetness comes in brilliantly in the 07 whereas the 08 was more of a smack you in the nostrils sweetness with booze. Butterscotch barreled through as it warmed off some and was the one sticking point.  T: Similar to the aromas, the taste was more pungent and sweet in the 08. The flavors are fine here as well but the true balance and complexity is heightened with a year on the shelf I guess. Carammel, butterscotch malts that fit more into the ballpark of a fine barleywine than anything else. I was anticipating the usual dried fruit flavors but was more drawn to fresh fruit flavors such as cherry and plums.  M: It shines here for both versions. Bubbly, coating, and luxurious- the trifecta of goodness. The creaminess and bitterness for a beer this strength makes it a textbook sipper.  D: The strength Im sure would hide and seek more if shelved for longer but fresh it could be cumbersome. Dont get me wrong, this is delicious, worth the price, and something that I can always find a time and place for.  These two bottles were a perfect accompaniment to a good football game with the second half oddly becoming more enjoyable than the first.  Bastard the double indeed. Beggars cant be choosers but man, what this would be like oaked like the single bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,WYVYRN527,4.17,"Poured into a pint glass from a bomber...  A. Pours a dark mahogany with a nice cream head that coats the side of the glass as it thins. For it's strength, it is quite active as far as carbonation goes.  S. Biter hops overwhelm the nose at first, but soon aromas of graperuit and pine stand out. The malty backbone is only somewhat present.  T. Reminded me at first of Arrogant Bastard, but then it hit me with that hoppy character. Flavors of pine, citrus, and hemp were dominant. The finish was malty. Sweet and supple, yet aggressive on the palate.  M. Wow. This was a brew that soaked the tongue and stayed there. Full bodied and smooth ay the same time, the alcohol didn't even really poke through. It was there, and there to stay. That flavor didn't leave the palate for quite some time.  D. Double Bastard is no session beer by any means. A 22 oz. bottle at a time is all one needs. Very tasty though. If you can find it, buy a bottle. It's definitely worth the taste.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,TexIndy,4.66,"2008 Edition. Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. The bottle had a nice long story on the back per the usual Stone custom. It was an amber color with good carbonation and nice lacing. It had an average tan head that slowly settled into a carb fountain in the center with light foam around it with a nice collar.  The aroma was heavy floral hops, pineapple and alcohol. The alcohol faded after a bit which was good as it was throwing off the aroma for me. Smells like a hop bomb and it is. Taste is more like an ADIPA to me but it's classified as an ASA. It doesn't shred your tongue as much as an ADIPA though. Taste is solid from start to finish and despite the strong hops does not leave a bitter after-taste. Get a good hop taste with a moderate bite and then it fades with a good finish. This one is really growing on me as the normal hop bombs leave you numb after awhile. This one gets you good taste and then resets for the next drink. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Good carbonation.  Overall, a really excellent beer and worthy of the high praise. My only knock would be that at 10.5% ABV, I'm not going to have more than one at a time and if I start the evening with this one than my tongue and senses are too dulled to really appreciate other beers. For me, this has to be the only beer of the evening that I want to really taste. Anything after this is going to be filler. Highly recommend. Another great one from Stone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,talkinghatrack,2.96,"A - Pours clear dark amber with a frothy, lasting head.  S - Loses some points here. Hops mixed with rubbing alcohol. Yes, it is 10.5% ABV but other brews with this power mask it a little better. Seemed fine on the surface whiffs but when tilted for a sip it releases a clear alcohol hit.  T - Big hops punch up front, finishes a little bitter/sour with a warming feel that still lets some notable alcohol taste sneak through.  M - On each sip it starts syrupy but swallows thin.  D - It would certainly pack a punch if downed quick and easy but the notable alcohol notes in the smell and finish will slow people down. Not something I could drink more than a glass or two of in one sitting. UPDATE: In fact, when I went back to finish the bottle an hour later I ended up with a half a glass that I just wasn't interested in finishing. Once it warms up it a little it stuck me as more of a mixed vodka cocktail in unmasked alcohol content. Wasn't feeling it. Adjusting D from 3.5 to 3.  Labeled ""2008 Release"" and suggested that it be aged at 55F or below. I picked it up a month ago but didn't see the note and it spent maybe two days in the fridge. I suppose with age at the right temp it would improve. Worth a try but I probably wouldn't buy again.  I enjoyed the regular AB more. Double AB seems to ride its admittedly entertaining ""I'm a rebel that you REALLY won't like"" claim to a higher rating than it may deserve.  Note: After reviewing I skimmed the other reviews. It seems strange how some people describe this beer as cloudy while others (like myself) see it as completely clear.

147,1056,superdedooperboy,4.28,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a snifter glass, this mighty bastard of a brew shows with a deep, hazy reddish-amber hue. A big, fluffy, creamy cap of light tan foam rises and lingers a while, leaving behind trails of sticky lace on the sides of the glass.  Nose is full of sweet, toffee malt, dark pit fruits and a tinge of alcohol. Very inviting, indeed.  A nice, full body and smooth, thick mouthfeel, with just a spritz of carbonation drags a bashing of citrus hop bitterness, with notes of cherries and other dark fruits. An underlying malt sweetness is mostly masked by the powerful hop presence. Alcohol is well-hidden, and the dry, bitter finish keeps the brew going down until not a drop remains in the whopper of a bottle.  This is one damn deceptively drinkable bastard, and the 10.5% is a backstabber for sure. Either way, this one can be sipped or quaffed, but drinker beware!

T- Sweet caramel maltyness and assertive hop biterness greet you simultaneously. The middle is a big powerful balance between hop and malt character. The malt character stays the same throughout while more hop flavor comes through after mid point. The finish makes you want more in a ""I dare you"" sort of way.  M- Pretty rich, altough carbonation is moderate, the hop bitterness increases its preception.  D- Aside from the high abv, no complaints.  This is a great beer to have if you are sick of drinking BMC (maybe you were at a wedding and that's all they had).

T: Tastes of sweet roasted malts, then a nice citrisy/earthy hoppy taste, then it follows with a slight twinge of alcohol. The flavors actually mix quite well and there's a bit of a bready taste to it as well. M: Very thick, heavy, warming, a bit hot, right amount of carbonation.

T - Exceptionally well balanced between the typical West Coast hop bitterness and malt. The maltiness becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. The 10.5% ABV stays well hidden. Some caramel and burnt sugar along with hops in the finish.  M - Very pleasant carbonation - not too much, but not too little either. This would probably mellow out with age (which I fully intend to try).  D - Excellent drinkability, considering the alchoholic heft of this beer. Although the good people at Stone would probably take issue with my phrasing, I would say this is one of their most balanced beers.

S: The nose was pungent and evident from the first pour with the Chinook hops providing dried grapefruit scents mixed with pine. A nice malty aroma filled with light roasted character blends nicely with the dried citrusy nature.  T: The flavor was malty, with dried pine and grapefruit hopping. A sugary malting lies underneath the rich, and dried hoppy character. Boozy with some warm alcohol and cask notes with a dry flowery lacing coats the tongue after the swallow. Really smooth overall with some light dried fruitiness of raisins as well some bitter chocolate hints.  M: warm and luscious, with an oily viscosity medium full in nature and a light to moderate carbonation showing  D: Drinkability was good I thought, much smoother and refined then the original bastard.

It's kind of like a hop-head's version of a quad. Very spicy. Pretty damn malty, sweet (brown sugar) and alcoholic, yet surprisingly easy to drink, probably because it's so delicious.

T- palate scratchingly bitter from start to finish, it seems to dissect this i'll have to pause between sips. idk maybe not. hops are insanely herbal, with dill and fennel and reefer underlying burnt almost cocoa grapefruit flavors. lots of pine flavor still and juniper in every burp. alcohol seems to be very well masked by the load of hops and a rye-like spiciness. toasty, woodsy, caramel, toffee malt sweetness hangs beneath but is always noticeable. dries out nicely at the end, woodsy, tobacco, leather, more juniper, more grapefruit peel, cognac, and a puckering bitterness.  MF- medicinal, astringent, resinous, sweet first, then way dried out. medium low carbonation. full bodied but not syrupy even at room temp. coating, with a slight burn, and alpha oils reaching down my esophagus.

Big hop nose, very sweet. Apples, pineapples, grapefruit, and burnt caramel. The hops definitely have the edge here.  The taste is sweet as well. Candied grapefruit and pineapple with oranges and burnt caramel faintly standing up in the background. The finish is more on the bitter side with an oily, pine resin flavor.  Chewy, syrupy mouthfeel. The pine resin finish really sticks to your mouth.  Where the AB is more balanced, DB is much more aggressively hopped. High in abv and with all these hops, it will slow you down. A definite sipper.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Wetpaperbag,4.3,"A- Dark copper/amber color. The head was highly active, but settled down leaving great lacing that chased the beer down the glass.  S- Hop smell is there, a sweet ruby grapefruit smell. I'm also getting something sweet like some honey. There is also a malty/bread smell in there as well. I'm excited about trying this again.  T- Great malt flavor, with the sweetness of honey and that malt sweetness. But the star of the show is the hops. The hops are sweet yet not bitter or kick your tongues ass kind of hop taste that some hop used beers are. The taste is mellow and well balanced, very tasty beer.  M- The mouthfeel is easy going. The hop taste doesn't kill off your palate too badly.  D- Easy to drink, the ABV is well hidden, and this goes down smooth.

147,1056,sweetbrew82,4.53,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass; no freshness date  P: Pours a caramel brown from the bottle, and sits deep amber in the glass. Generous pour produces a healthy, 2-fingered head of frothy tan foam that showed great retention! Finally settled to form a nice skin on top, while leaving splotchy laces on the way down. Good first impression!  A: Bready malts, caramel, some toffee, citrusy hops, and a bit of alcohol.  T: Starts a bit sweet with biscuity malt flavors hitting the palate along with some caramel and toffee. Hops take a minute to break through and provide some good citrus flavors to compliment. Caramel seems to linger throughout, while laying underneath the wave of spicy alcohol that seems to build like a wave & crest upon swallow. It never gets overbearing due to the splendid array of supporting flavors, and does a great job of lighting the fire in your chest at the same time. The finish leaves the tongue dry, tingly, and already missing the delicious flavors just left, while being teased by the long aftertaste. This tastes amazing!  M: The Double Bastard is a masterpiece in this department. Full-bodied and viscious, yet incredibly smooth. A very deceptive aspect of this beer, as it really does a great job of hiding its true intentions.  D: Off the charts if it weren't for the heavy-handed alcohol punch that hits like Tyson in the '80's.  Notes: Damn, this one will put some hair on your chest. This is one big, bad ass American Strong Ale not be reckoned with. It gorilla pimp slaps you from the start and leaves you beggin for more! Another outstanding brew from the good folks at Stone.

The walls would be a golden caramel-red and the trim would be a golden tan cream! The colors in this pint deserve a halo! A two finger head dissipates after time, and as I drink, it leaves a mess of splotches and spiderwebs down the sides of the glass.  Aromas of pine and hops hit the nose at first followed by autumn harvest fruits. A malty undertone ties it all together.  What a balanced flavor! I can sense the hops but they aren't overwhelming at all. The malted sweetness balances the bitterness perfectly. Hints of apples and cream lend a stroke of genius to this wonderful beer.  A rolling creamy liquidity flushes through the mouth. It's a summery feeling, but it will go great the entirety of the year.  This beer rates a perfect in drinkability! I want gallons and gallons of this beer. It's perfect as a thirst quencher, a session beer, or something to try for the first time on a chilly winter night.

There was good lacing on the glass thoughout the drinking period.  Hops come through on the smell almost immediately; there is a nice sweet malty smell with piney hops that make it smell like an excellent fruit forward chardonnay.  Taste is of hops, big time! There is a tiny bready taste at first but that is overwhelmed by the piney notes rushing at you. I'm not a hophead, yet this is a good bitterness that is not overpowering. Alcohol is in the aftertaste.  Relatively smooth mouthfeel for all that alcohol. There is a bit of a bitter twang and warmth from the alcohol that lingers but it's slight and not unpleasant.

There's a huge head, that's incredibly sticky. This beer smells as what I feel a beer should smell like, nice ale bodied with a great hop finish. Hops smelled incredibly resiny.  Flavor profile is and oaked vanilla, moving to big grapefruit hops. The brew is incredibly biting, taking a toll on your mouth.  While the mouthfeel is inviting, and mesmerizing - it does prohibit you from drinking much of this. The hops are incredibly full and bulky.

147,1056,UA8,4.15,A- Pours a translucent ruby brown with a two finger off white head.  S- A kick to the face of fresh sliced pineapple opens the nose. This is back by citrus notes and a slight malt character and touch of released alcohol.  T- Opens with sweet pineapple and grapefruit peel mid palate hints of the high ABV and it finishes with big grassy hops. Very nice profile but I suspect that this beer could be layed down and would develop even further.  M- Medium full body with light carbonation.  D- This is a really solid brew however I feel like it has not reached its full potential the flavors are somewhat subdued and seem like there should be more going on. Still a recommended brew.

Wish a KC/MO distributor would would pick it up!  This is a Very good beer. Picked up a 22 oz bomber and poured into a snifter. I usually don't write about the bottle design but the bottle is nice with a story about the beer. Nice head that last but did go away because I took my time drinking this one. Kinda reminds me of a mellow barley wine.  Smell and taste are sweet but with a very nice hop bite. I love the hops in this one. I'm usually an IPA guy and this is a nice departure.  This is very drinkable but not a session beer. One or two is enough for me. The alcohol content on the label is 10.5 and I can barley tell.

A yeasty alcohol bite makes its presence known. Mouthfeel is big and bold, but not chewy and cloying. The 10.5% that this brew packs is noticeable, but it remains fairly drinkable.

Pine and citrus hops, though both subdued as the bottle is over a year old. Nonetheless I must review what is in front of me. Some caramel is present as well as some sweet brown sugar.  T. Very caramelly from the start. Again the hops have died down to show some barleywine characteristics. A crunchy salty taste rise prior to a Nice soft hope kick in the end.

Earthy malts dominate the first impression followed by a perfect amount of bitter hops and pine flavor to balance this beer exquisitely.  This beer is not for the faint of heart.

A - A dark amber and ruddy brown mingled liquid w/ a big and rocky cream head of about 2 fingers which settles to tiny bubbly film.  S - Rich malt aromas and earthy deep piney hops w/ a strong alcoholic nose. Very much like pine cone's intensity in the scent w/ a hint of booze coming in close second.  M - This malty strong beer has a nice smooth sweetness which surrenders to sharp and bitter feeling on the tongue. Mildly carbonated and intense alcohol textures create a whirlpool of hoppy bold feelings and an astringency of many grapefruits.  T - Almost off the bat the hops jump and hold the tongue hostage in a very aggressive taste of piney and sharp w/ a nice supporting flavor of strong ale w/ sufficient malt to keep the flavor from becoming too bitter to stand. An aggressive bitterness w/ slightly sweet malt and dry acidic finish. The acohol warms all the way down and the hop taste pummels the palate in a true hop assault.  D - Not a very drinkable ale, but you knew that already since it is ""Double Bastard"" and that indicates an extreme beer - Strong ale in the truest sense. The taste is very over the top and should probably always split this unless you can handle super ball sized wasabi.

147,1056,CrellMoset,4.49,"2006 vintage, does as part of a vertical w/ a current 2008 bottle, this bottle courtesy of Phocion, the new one purchased from Wine Warehouse, Charlottesville, VA. Both vintages poured into cervoises.  Appearance: Pours thicker than the 2008 version, dirtier, slower, a hazed orange brown, with a larger head (somehow) with better retention (somehow) that leaves sticker, fuller, more bubbly lacing (somehow). This one looks like a headache waiting to happen.  Aroma: Pungently fruity, tropically fruity, with tons of dark, heavier malts, and lots of hop goodness. Pineapple and grapefruit are intertwined - ensconced in, perhaps - a blanket of raisins, doughy caramel, sweet, spicy alcohol, blueberries, molasses, and other wholesome nice notes.  Taste: Oh so mellow, yet somehow still with tons of bitterness and great hop flavors. This one's incredibly fruity and complex, thick, ferocious, powerful. Pineapple, strawberry, pine, caramel, well-hidden prickly alcohol, cola, vanilla, spiciness, chocolate as it warms ... this is one complex beer, huge, large and in charge.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly carbonated, thick, and prickly. It fills up pretty well, though, creamy, even-like, with tons of prickle. It's far more mellow than the fresh version, still crisp and spicy, but in a pleasant way.  Drinkability: Infinitely (ok, not infinitely, but very much so ) better than the fresh version - this is definitely a beer that improves vastly with age. The hops need time to mellow out here, and though the good fruit flavors are present in both, they're marred by tons of piney, spicy bitterness in the fresh version. Alcohol's large and in both of them, whether or not you can taste it/feel it underneath all the prickly, spicy, dominant sweetness and bitterness - nonetheless, it's there.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,bamadog,4.1,"Another solid brew from Stone, I was not disappointed. Not something that lines up with my personal tastes preferences, but an outstanding beer on just about every level.  Appearance: A beautifl color of reddish copper -- very slight head of about 1/2 finger that didn't really last at all. Not even a lacing is being left on the glass. No carbonation bubbling throughout either. A very thick appearance.  Smell: It smells very sweet - caramel or honey sweet. This is not quite what I expected. Typically I expect a lot more hops, but they're very subdued here.  Taste: Very sweet, much like the smell: strong honey sweetness to it. Very reminiscent of the Old Guardian barleywine from Stone. Alcohol is very much present, but this comes as no surprise since it's 10.5%.  Mouthfeel: Chewy and sticky. I feel like I may need to scrape the roof of my mouth when I'm done drinking this bad boy.  Drinkability: While this is definitely an excellent brew, it is so potent that I'm going to be hard pressed to get through the whole bomber.

The potency can be sensed without dictating the taste. Hops are the story here; it's very much like a dark DIPA--perhaps we could call this Triple IPA.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,bark,4.43,"2007 vintage.  The colour is deep brown with a tint of red; the two finger head is firm and beige. Lots of lacing occurs.  The medium strong smell is very hoppy (but not very bitter) in an American citric way. But at the same time, there are large quantities of lightly roasted hops to balance the hops: The grapefruits are mixed with plums, raisins and candied oranges. There is some alcohol too, but not as much as one could think.  The taste is very balanced: loads of dried fruits (plums, raisins, figs) and walnuts, some sour hints of lemons, lots of round sweet flavours. Fruit candy, fresh vegetables, grilled meat and an impressive balanced and luxurious feel. The aftertaste got a warming alcoholic flavour, dried fruits, very elegant bitterness that keeps in the background. The finish reminds a little of fine Scottish lowland whiskey and Christmas desserts.  The carbonation is mild, yet refreshing. The liquid is thick and creamy.  Does this style get better than this? I think it is hard to imagine such a beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,BamaBeerBuff,4.7,"A: Pours a brilliant crimson with a thick, creamy head that settles very slowly and leaves impressive lacing despite the high ABV.  S: Rich ripened dark fruit, spicy hop aromas, sweet brown sugar/molasses. Caramel aromas and a distinct hint of cherries. Alcohol is a bit excessive--that's my only complaint.  T&M: This beer is massive. Loads of intensity and complexity--I would expect nothing less from a Bastard like this. Initial flavors of sweet sugary malt and fruitiness give way to citrus, herbal, and piney hop bitterness midway through. At this point, I would consider the flavor great, but the finish adds yet another layer of depth and complexity that makes this beer extraordinary. Notes of (seriously!?) oak, caramel, and toffee malt melded nicely with herbal and earthy hops reprise in the finish. Body is silky/syrupy and smooth, with a restrained carbonation.  D: I'm giving this a 4.5 because its drinkability, relative to the alcohol level and overall ""big-ness"", was uncanny. I fucking love this beer and am now regretting that I didn't buy all three of the remaining bottles at Greens. Instead, I just bought two. I can only hope that beer karma will repay me soon for leaving a bottle of such a great beer behind.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Good looking  Smells up front of alcohol and hops. Pine. Little bit of malt in there as well.  First thing that hits my palate is the alcohol, very aggressive. Hint of caramel malt, splash of citrus, followed by the hops. Spicy as well, probably due to the alcohol content. It's certainly warming, and the alcohol isn't THAT overwhelming, but it's definitely dominant on my palate right now. Oddly enough, the mouthfeel is a little watery. Just a little.  It's not undrinkable by any means, but it's not one of the more drinkable strong ales out there.  Overall, I have to admit I was disappointed. Aside from the appearance, which I felt was superb. Stone has such a great line of brews and I feel that this is towards the bottom. It's not bad, by any means at all... it's just (in my experiences) I feel the Arrogant Bastard is a better strong ale, as well as the past Double Bastards.

The thin head stays throughout.  S - Lots of grapefruit and the same pineapple aroma from arrogant bastard. Underlying the huge fruitiness are hints of pine and mint. Very enticing.  T- The taste is of thick sweet malt upfront - caramel, sweet - barley(?) ...brown sugar. It is balanced out, and beaten out after the second sip - by bitter citrus - orange and grapfruit. Soon, the citrusy, chewy hops fully emerge to overtake the maltiness. The malt, however, remains intact and give the hops a solid backbone. Complex, and the flavors are nicely layered.  M- The feel is smooth with an incredibly well-balanced texture. Leaves a nice hop attack on the tongue The abv is barely noticeable in the taste and feel - leaving it to sneek up on you.  D- This is an incredible brew - nicely balanced with the hops in control in the end. Fresh, full, tasty and complex. This is an amazing brew.

When held to the light, with the glass at an angle, the beer is crystal clear and becomes a yellow-- almost olive color at its thinnest point.

The body is quite full and has an oily texture that slides right down. The carbonation is soft and small. It has a heavily bitter flavor with a moderately sweet aftertaste.

Second off, expectations met and exceeded with the first sip.  The beautiful, thick head thins out and is resilient as the beer is consumed, but remains a calm product of the perfectly balanced carbonation.

Taste is just huge. Well blended, boozy in a good way - think cognac. Definitely a sipper. Even though its a year old the hops are still discernable at the end. Full bodied and gets better as it warms up.  Drinkability is good but is limited by the 10% alcohol, which is noticeable.  I had the 2008 version of this a few days ago and can state that is beer is well served by the aging process. The 2007 tastes blended well with each other while the 2008 seemed like a lot of big tastes vying for attention. Buy a bunch of these each year and drink them when they are at least a year old.

The head has excellent retention and there is a nice amount of lacing.  Aroma is of alcohol and ripe fruits. Getting that ripe pineapple sense I get sometimes. Also some of the classic Arrogant Bastard malt aroma.. Not sure how to describe it, but it's distinctive.  I have to admit, I shared one of these the other night with a buddy and I just loved it. Truth be told I'm a big Arrogant Bastard fan... It was a little later in the night and I did enjoy it... Didn't review as I knew my palate was fried...  Now I have to say as the first beer of the day it's not as enjoyable. It's a bit hot and the alcohol is front and center. My beer fridge is set at 46 degrees. I let it sit out for about 10 minutes first. So it's not too cold. BA says to serve between 45 - 50 degrees. I am right there... The flavor starts with a strong alcohol flavor. After this (and the warming effect) you get some deep rich malt. Hop bitterness comes in, but is quickly taken over by the strong alcohol again. I have to say, I am sitting here and am quite disappointed. I am thinking this bad boy needs some aging...to mellow.  Mouth feel is as if you are drinking a strong VODKA drink....  Drinkability is not so great. Am I really writing this about an Arrogant Bastard and a Stone product? I can't believe it....  Color me disappointed.

S - Lots of grapefruit and the same pineapple aroma from it's little brother Arrogant Bastard. Underlying the huge fruitiness are hints of pine and mint. Very enticing.  T - Slight pineapple rounded off by apples and pears hits early palate. The beer then moves on to the big grapefruit component with floral, pine, and almost berry-like undertones. The sweetness present begins dying away leaving a touch of peppery/spicy flavor. Late palate the alcohol pokes through just a tad and finishes with a coarse bitterness.

147,1056,SaucyA,4.14,"2007. Cellared properly for a year.  A - Pours a deep rusty brown with amber twinges, into the snifter. The head is a taught, off white cream that quickly disappears into itself. Bits of lacing.  S - I smell my mom's ambrosia salad, quite honestly. Pineapples and oranges under a sweet, malty base. Alcohol, caramel.  T - The major hoppiness faded into the malt background, creating a reasonably balanced alcohol-bomb. Tobacco, molasses, caramel. Sweet as opposed to bitter, it finishes rather dry, surprisingly. Good, not great.  M - Quite on point. Thick and rather viscous with a fine carbonation running through it. Could stand a little more attenuation, but I'm being nit-picky.  D - Not bad drinkability at all. In fact, quite easy-drinking given the abv and amount of ingredients.  Notes: I like it with a bit of time on it rather than fresh. It just comes across as a little too overwhelming (in terms of heat, sweetness, AND hops) when it's freshly bottled.

147,1056,PBoegel,4.32,"Picked up 2 bombers at Oliver's last night.  This years brew is simply outstanding. While still a slight bit rough around the edges, where it is hot it also balanced with an outstanding but not in your face over the top hop profile.  The beer pours a very clear reddish orange amber hue with a nice slightly tan head.  The smell is warm alcohol, tropical fruits and warm apple pie.  The hops are well balanced with a judicious malt profile. The fruit that comes from the malt is less estery and more of a dried and cooked sugary fruit profile.  The flavors draw much of the same as that aroma with a nice clean and punching hop bitterness to cleanse the sweetness from the palate.  This is the best I have ever recalled Double B to be in terms of freshness and flavor.  Probably need to pick up more than 1 bottle in reserve.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

T: Wow, what a blend of malts and hops. This may be the perfect beer. It starts with a sweet malt and at the same time the hops kicks you hard too. It finishes dry with a hoppy bitterness. The alcohol is hidden wuite well, only noticible in the aftertaste, and it blends well with the hops and is not really all that noticable.  M: Medium body, not too heavy.  D: For a 10% beer, this was easy to drink.  Saving at least 2 bottles of 2008 to age, as this may be the perfect beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The beer pours from the bomber into my snifter dark rusty red with a cream tan head that holds a thin film and a thick ring around the edge of the glass leaving a nice bit of lace. Sticking your nose into glass, and the aroma bursts forth with citrusy and piney hops and sweet caramel maltiness giving it a bit of a cherry smell. Once the beer hits the tongue and slides to the back of my throat, the smacks you with bitter yet nicely citrusy hops. The beer is also complimented by a fruity flavor from the caramel malts that is somewhat like cherries. The beer has a nearly full body and nice carbonation as well as a bit of dryness from the hops.

The Beer itself settled nicely into a reddish brown, that looked really impressive  The smell, and I am not sure if this has been aged in Brandy Barrells too, but I could definitely get grape, fruit and an almost Port like finish to the beer.  Tasted slightly watery, little bit of the fruit and malt in there and then a pretty substantial alcohol follow up. Not bad, but not what I was hoping for. Hence I bought 2 of them so I can age one.  The watery texture of this beer makes it flow pretty easily for such a high level of ABV, but the sharp alcohol follow up makes you put it back down and wait before taking another gulp  Cheers",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Leaves a bit of lacing but not much.  Aroma has deep caramel maltiness with a bit of burnt sugar and raisin character. Blending in perfectly with the maltiness is a nice layer of citrus and piney hops. A touch of alcohol is detectable as well but not bad for the ABV.  Taste has a quick burst of malty sweetness but the complexity seems to be lost because the hops kick in and assault the palate. Much hoppier than the aroma actually suggested. Right from the start there are lots of piney hops and the citrus seems to be tamed down. Hops linger into the finish and with a hot alcohol breath.  Mouthfeel is medium, very smooth and creamy, but the hot alcohols in the finish detract a little.  Pretty good stuff, I figured this would be hoppy before going into this and it certainly was. This one should improve with a little age to hopefully lower the hotness.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The smell is intensely of dark fruit syrup, oak, and of course hops! Alcohol and malt play a supporting role. The taste is similar. Tons of citric and fruity hops and a nice punch of pine-like resin. Oak, malt, and alcohol come next. Absolutely incredible. I feel this beer has a lot of characteristics of a big barleywine in the sense of the body and mouthfeel. To me this is the Barleywine/RIS of the American Strong Ale category.

After an aggressive pour the head is minimal with crisp tan coloring. Very nice retention. Lacing coats around the glass with tiny bubbles like a neo-impressionist painting.  S: Aromas are sweet pineapple and saccharine candy. Sugary, earthy, and fragrantly floral. Malts with a slight nod to subtle citrus hops. The smell of this beer is absolutely amazing. A little bit of oaked ginger and peppered apple coupled with a sharpened brown sugar. Fresh, perfumed, and complex. No hints of alcohol.  T: Despite the ABV the taste is an incredible fruity, sweet, and smooth fusion. Malty caramel sweetness with a bitter grapefruit hops finish. Smoked cherries and spruced figs drenched in cinnamon and cajun spices. Complex amounts of burnt ripe fruits and tropical citrus flavors. Starched vanilla and peppercorned tangerines. As this one warms the tastes are more bourbon, more massive, and more blasphemous.  M: The body is heavy and creamy. Rich and fulfilling.  D: Frightening or impressive? Drinkable or too drinkable?

They are now a nice combination of tart citrus, sweet pine, with notes of pineapple.  T: Holy malt, I like this one. Very similar to aromas. Nice brown sugar sweetness up front which turns to sweet pine. Hints of citrus poke thru but the finish is nice and sweet with tones of pineapple and peach.  M: Full bodied, thick, and clingy.

My nose isn't the best but I get a great aroma from this beer. Full of big lush hops. Fresh too.  Flavor is very strong in all the right ways. Huge amounts of malt balanced well by copious hops. It's just a massive beer. Like the malts of a barley wine and the hops of a double IPA came together for a great cause.  Mouthfeel is actually pretty decent considering the strength. It is full bodied, nicely carbonated, and balanced, albiet on a very heavy duty scale.  Drinkability is good for the style but one bomber is certainly enough.  I decided to have this one tonight, not knowing if it was worth getting a few more bottles before they're all gone.

T- Overpowering, but in a good way. Overpowering hops are followed by overpowering sweet caramel malts, but it works so well. This beer is delicious. There is also a burnt brown sugar taste that was present in the aroma. The alcohol taste is extremely noticeable but as opposed to other beers that I've had it doesn't come across as boozy at all. The alcohol presence is pleasant and warming. An excellent winter beer. In fact, the best winter seasonal I've had to date.  M- Thick and syrupy with a good amount of carbonation.

147,1056,dancinwillie,4.12,"2008 Release, served in a chalice.  Pours a very dark shade of mahogany, which doesn't let much light through. As I hold it up to the light, I can see a definite reddish hue, but out of light, more of a brown. A quickly receding beige head, made up of tight little bubbles. Lovely.  I smelled hops as soon as I opened the bottle. But now, as I lean in for a better aroma, I smell citrus and some sort of a cooked or burnt sugar. It smells warm and inviting.  Heavy and sweet malt richness initially, mingling instantaneously with the pine and grapefruit hops. The bitterness is substantial, but it requires attention to notice. If I was really quaffing this, I might miss it. It lingers on the sides of my tongue for about 10 seconds after each drink. If it weren't for the hops, this might be cloying, but there they are. I actually wouldn't mind a heavier hopping, however, this being my only negative observation. I don't notice any of the 10.5% alcohol, but as I had a small lunch, and it is now 8 pm, I definitely feel it after half a glass.  Mouthfeel is assuredly full and robust. This isn't your average drink a case and watch the game beer. This beer makes you sit up and take notice.  Entirely drinkable, extremely affordable, and surprisingly, quite balanced. I need to buy a few to cellar, and enjoy throughout the long Wisconsin winter. IIRC, I paid something like $5.49 for this bomber. This beer ranks 1 step above 2007 Utopias on the BA listing for the style. Do the math, and then pick this up if you have the chance. Although it's a well above average beer, the high ABV would prevent me from drinking more than 2 bombers at a sitting I believe. But that's the way it is, isn't it?

147,1056,ChainGangGuy,4.2,"2008 Release.  Appearance: Pours a clear, reddish amber body with a well-formed, sustaining, off-white head. Copious amounts of lacing on the way down.  Smell: Aromatic hoppy nose, some sweetish hints to it, and smelling of fresh orange peel, exotic flowers, pine resin, and a splash of pomegranate liqueur. Caramel-scented maltiness underneath. Very, very minor wafts of alcohol.  Taste: Sweet caramel-laden maltiness with a pinch of light brown sugar and a quick drizzle of simple syrup brace themselves for the impact of hops. Quick montage of fruit flavors - oranges, grapefruits, pomegranates, even sweet cherries. This precedes a solid jolt of straight-up citrus and pine hoppiness with a full, sturdy bitterness. Definitely a warming beer, but not quite hot or bracing for me. Drying finish with a touch of booze and more than a touch of bitter hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.  Drinkability: Recommended! I'm ashamed to admit it's been more than a few years since I've had a bottle of this to myself, but I'm more than pleased to be having a fresh bottle and am happy they're finally, at long last, distributing to the state of Georgia.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,Tdizzle,4.23,"2008 edition.  A- Poured from a 22oz bottle into an imperial pint glass, this bastard pours a clear reddish-amber color with a two-finger head of foam that's tan in color and very dense. The sticky head slowly settles to a thick layer that hovers over the beer until the very last sip, leaving a few blankets of lacing behind each time.  S- The malt base of the aroma is massively sweet and fruity, but it's accompanied by a very large dose of piney, resiny and citrusy hops. The 10.5% ABV makes itself very known in the smell of this beer.  T- Sugary malt sweetness is the first of several brash taste sensations that slap my palate. The hops move in very shortly after this initial bombardment of malts, only to replace any trace of the aforementioned sweetness with an intense, unrelenting pine and citrus rind bitterness that clings to the back of my tongue for dear life. The alcohol patiently works its way throughout all of this towards the finish, where it will have the final say. Wow, this is a very ""hot"" beer.  M- A very full-bodied feel with a moderate amount of lively carbonation.  D- This is an all-around abrasive beer. The hefty alcohol content continuously assaults the senses, but the overall flavor of this beer is very good, which helps to diminish the obtrusiveness of the alcohol. It wasn't a chore to drink, but it wasn't no walk in the park either. I found that I was compelled to finish an entire bomber over the course of a night, so I can't knock the drinkability too much.  I look forward to Double Bastard every year.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,popery,4.7,"2008 release.  An excellent strong ale with a great kick.  Double Bastard is a smoky red-amber ale with a big foamy head. The head really foamed up nicely in my tulip on the initial pour. The nose is sweet with white grape juice and spices. The flavors are strong and bold. There's spot on bitterness from citric hops. The hop flavors are almost reminiscent of Stone's Ruination, a phenomenal beer in my opinion. The perfect taste rating is really down to a perfect alcohol kick. This beer uses a strong alcohol flavor better than anything else that I've tried. Sure, there are stronger beers, but most of them tend to mask the alcohol flavor with sweetness or complexity sometimes with fantastic results. However, Double Bastard comes out and hits you with a healthy alcohol bite on one side and a huge bitter hop note on the other. The beer ends up just right. Ok, it's a bit overpowering. I certainly don't feel like having a lighter beer after a glass of it. Anyway, the feel is great. The beer is smooth and well-carbonated and keeps a clean feel with a high abv. It's quite drinkable for its strong flavor profile, but it's definitely not easy on the tongue or mouth.  Useless design review is go: Alright, I'm a sucker not just for Stone's flavors but also for their design. Stone's art department does a great job once again with Double Bastard. I'm looking at one of the early run silver editions, which just replaces the white ink with silver. I very much like bottle printing. It gives the bottle texture, and using the beer as a background just feels right. Stone does a particularly good job with it, here. The Stone demon with a beer logo is simple, professional and just great. The reflection of the logo is aesthetically pleasing with the up/down text border. The text on the back is bitingly sarcastic and self-deprecating but still rings of truth. Most importantly, it fits the beer better than the vast majority of such attempts by microbrewers.  I can't say enough good things about this beer. Could I imagine it being slightly better? Sure, but that's quibbling over a very small margin of possible improvement. I will definitely be buying more soon.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S- Tons of hops with a solid malt backbone. The hop profile is quite blalanced with citrusy notes of grapefruit and pine and a hint of pineapple.

A heavy malt background is evident, with notes of raisin, plum and sherry, but overridden by the immense amounts of pine resin and grapefruit; high alpha American hops.  The flavor is much like the nose, but with a bit of tannins and oakiness. The alcohol and hops are both very strong, and finish out the flavor in an intense blast of deep, earthy, bitter hops.

Where your regular bastard will just strip your mouth of all taste. The Double Bastard ""takes it easy on you"" that is until you get to the end onf the bottle. Caramelized sugar maltiness blend with the tongue tingling hop bite perfectly. Sweet up front and bitter in the back. The hop bite sticks with you.  Thick and creamy like what you may expect from a barley wine, I am thinking Old Ruffian. Slight oily hoppy slickness.  Stone brews are truly a paradox.

Inch of white, fluffy head that stuck to the sides of the glass as the beer was consumed.  S- Wow! So much was going on here, it's almost hard to describe. It was a combination of citrus fruits, pineapples, burnt malt, and a nice smell of piney hops to cap it off. So similar to many of the west coast IPA's (i.e. Pliny the Elder) that I have had.  T- Even better than the smell! Initially, a nice sweet pineapple, malt taste hits the tongue. Right before it ends, the hops kick in to give it a nice crisp, piney finish for the perfect touch.  M- Medium bodied that almost felt light and crisp at times and then thick and syrupy at others. So versatile, absolutely loved it!  D- This beer went down so smooth, it was unbelievable. I have had stronger beers before, but from the very first sip, I felt the burn in the chest and flushness in the face (not necessarily a bad thing). If I could have more than one, I would have gave it a 5.  Overall, this beer may be the best that I have had so far! I'm not sure if it's because I let it age for a year, but this beer was so complex and brought so many different varieties of flavors. Nice sweet citrus/pineapple malt flavor followed by a crisp, piney hops flavor. Absolutely perfect! I'm seriously debating whether or not to let my other bottle age for another year.  edit: Just opened a bottle of the 2008 Double Bastard and the 2007 is so much better. Let this beer age for at least a year.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,kinger,4.89,"Amazing offering by one of my favorite brewers. The Arrogant Bastard was the brew that really started me off on the journey for great beer, and almost a year later I find myself sipping on the Double during an already great Friday Night. The aroma is original and awesome, if I could create a flavor of incense or an air freshener I would want this. Very aromatic throwing malts, hops, dark fruits, citrus notes, with a powerful alcohol kick bringing up the rear. Nice pour looks like the local fermented apple cider with a pencil thin head and minimal lacing, but hey it's a strong one so you can't be too upset. Take a sip and it bites you strong and fast a very aggressive mouthfeel with a smoooth subtle burn. Flavor is right on and then some, hoppy enough to combat the huge malt content. This is American Barleywine at it's peak. Thank you Stone again and again, thanks!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,OlieIPA,3.7,"Bottled in 2006...  A: Brown-reddish hue with little head.  S: Spices along with a sugary sweetness.  T: Very similar to there barely wine (probably because its been aged a few years), but it also possess some sort of earthy and soil like flavor.  M: Good.  D: This is a pretty aggressive beer...not sure if I could have more then a bomber to myself.  Overall: Try it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,brewandbbq,4.2,"A vertical tasting of vintages 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2008. The 2003 and 2008 were sampled together, and the 2004 and 2006 were sampled the following evenings.  Vintage 2008 bottled on on 9/12/08.  Pours dark amber with a ruby hue. Clear body with a half inch head of off white. Some light rings of lacework after the short head fell, and a partial skim coat remained on the surface for the duration.  Aromatics lead off with jammy malt, red and tropical fruits, and warming alcohol. Peaches, apricots and melons lead the way for shadows of red grapes, cherries, and bourbon-spiked honey. Sweetish and quite juicy.  On the thick side of medium bodied. Sticky and chewy mouthfeel. A bit light on the carbonation.  Sweet crystle malt, ripe fruit, fresh caramel, and a resinous bitterness start the palate. Warming alcohol steps forward as well as hints of caramel-candied apple, spruce dew, and candied figs.  Finishes with a lingering warmth, sustaining bitterness, and drawn-out sweet fruit.  A classic American strong ale that dances along the lines of a Barleywine. Next up, a mini vertical with an aged example.  Vintage 2003:  Pours cloudy, dark amber, with a half inch head of off white. A slow retreat revealed some spongy lacework and a few whisps on the placid surface.  Aromatics are heavy on the malt, with lots of wet leather, rotting cedar, wet paper, and Sherry. Very earthy and oxidized. Hops are not to be found, and the nose rounds out with hints of cocoa, cardboard, and dried earth.  Medium bodied, but very syrupy and chewy. A slick, tacky mouthfeel with subdued carbonation.  Stale malt, wet and dusty boards, worn leather, and earth-dusted chipped toffee start the palate. Oxidized Sherry steps forward as well as a warming boozy note and tannic caramel.  Finishes with a lingering dried earth note, dusty leather, stale malt, and old wood tinders.  Not a fan of the five year old DB.  Side by side with the 2008 freshie:  Wow, I wouldn't believe that they were the same beer unless I poured it myself. The freshie is cleaner, infinately hoppier all around, and much brighter. The peaches and apricots really shine though when sided with the oldster DB.  Vintage 2004  Pours clear, dark amber with a two inch head of off white. Retention is moderate and theres some decent lacing after the fall.  Aromatics lead off with ripe, red fruits, sweet malt, and alcohol. Significantly more boozy than the 2003 or 2008. Slightly vineous with hints of bourbon fusels, cherries, figs, and sherry.  On the thick side of medium bodied. Slightly syrupy and plenty slick.  Dark fruits, cherry-infused malt, and bourbon-spiked toffee start the palate. A mild throat burn quickly steps forward as well as a peppery warmth.  Finishes with lingering alcohol, sweet malt, and fading red fruits.  Hardly a trace of oxidation in the 2004, which makes it pretty amazing how quickly this beer goes off the deep end. Looks like four years in the cellar is the max for a Double Bastard.  Vintage 2006  Pours murky dark amber, with a one inch head of off white. A partial skim coat remained on the surface for the duration, along with some spotty lacework.  Aromatics lead off with dry, papery malt, caramel, toffee, earthy cedar, and a trace of cocoa. Warming alcohol follows through along with wet cardboard.  On the thick side of medium bodied and chewy. A creamy and somewhat syrupy mouthfeel.  Drying malt, caramel dust, and hints of cocoa, nougat, and wet boards start the palate. Dark fruits, warming alcohol, and an approachable biterness follow through.  Finishes with lingering cardboard-infused malt, stale chocolate, and a drying bitterness.  Concensus:  The 2004 was remarkable and somehow far superior to the 2006. Zero oxidation and was clearer in the glass. I'd like to think that the perfect amount of time for DB in the cellar is four years if you use the 2004 as a benchmark. The 2006 disproves this though.  Vintages in order of best to worst: 2008 2004 2006 2003  Note: All were stored in the cellar on thier sides for the duration, and the 2006 was very close to the 2003 in last place.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,PatronWizard,4.5,"2007 Vintage. How patient is I? This is my first time drinking this stuff and my attempt at worthiness.  Really nice ruby hued bronze. Nice medium side head of mostly small bubbles. Not quite white.  I simply cannot describe the smell. I possess not the words. I am unworthy. Earthy. I want to claim a hint of some dark fruit. It doesn't smell like ""beer,"" it smells like ""ale.""  The dark fruit I was trying to smell is definitely in the taste. A nice touch of alcohol too. Hey, some of us like to know we're drinking strong beer. A bitterness there as well. Very good!  Full bodied and strong. This is an ass kicker fo'sho.  Overall: worthy or not, I'm gonna take down every last drop of this puppy  Edit: Opened an '06 yesterday. Awesome!! It was so good that I opened another. Awesome!! After two, I had to have another but I only had one more '06 and an '08 on hand. So I opened the '08. Bad decision. Noticeably inferior. With two years on these, they are marvelous.

147,1056,unionturf,2.36,"Having tried AB which is now one of my favorite beers I looked forward to this bottle.  Poured dark amber, clear, with a good head. Smell was strong alcohol some malt and hops. Upon first sip I knew this was not for me at all. Way too thick, syrupy, too much alcohol taste for me to enjoy. Drinkability was way low for me since I didn't finish the bottle and poured the rest down the drain (sorry beer fans...).  A total let down, sometimes enough is enough...this was too much.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,glid02,4.62,"Got the 2006 version on-tap at the GA release.  Pours a cloudy dark copper color with a one-finger off-white head. The head recedes slowly but eventually settles into a thin ring around the glass. Lacing is sticky at first but near the end there's not much of it.  Smells very good. Big malt sweetness up front followed by a bigger piney hop aroma. It smells like a big beer.  Tastes very similar to how it smells. Malty sweetness followed by a slight citrus hop flavor and ending with a piney and bitter finish. The flavors meld flawlessly and the only hint of the alcohol is the warming sensation. Very nice.  Mouthfeel is great. It has a great thickness to go along with very subtle carbonation. Incredibly smooth.  Drinkability is also great. I wouldn't guess that it was 10%, and I could easily drink a few of these.  Overall, this was my introduction to Stone and it did not disappoint. The hops were still big even after the two years of aging.

The smell is mighty and malty with a mellow blast of piney, citrusy hops.  The taste is oily hop-bitter with fruity-sweet malt, dry and toasty malt, and a bit of syrupy semi-sweet caramel sweetening the profile. A whopping dose of bitter piney citrus mops up the sweetness and dries the finish, even as it makes me wonder about the initial Megaton-yield of the hop-bomb this thing must have been at its birth!

147,1056,atsprings,4.95,"2006 vintage served at the Stone NC launch party! 10oz pour into a goblet. Served a hazy dark orange with a lasting frothy head. The aroma was pine hops slightly overpowering caramel malts. The taste was a wonderful balance of burnt caramel and pine hops that only got better as it warmed. The beer had very well hidden alcohol, there was some stickiness and warmth, but not what you'd expect for 10%. This is an absolutely wonderful beer, and this tasting shows that it ages very well, too.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Biggness,4.35,"This beer pours a very dark nearly opaque amber with a 1 fingered head. The smell is of caramel, citrus, malt and alcohol. The taste is loaded with malty goodness, a big caramel flavor with a citrus end. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth there is just a slight dry feeling in my mouth after each swallow. A beast of a beer with malts, I think drinking 2 of these would be an accomplishment, but one of these is beautiful.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S- The aroma features a really nice malt base with dark fruits and hops. Wow, the malt in this one smells great.  T- Like the aroma, the taste features a deliciously smooth malt backbone to start off, with the hops coming in the finish to provide a nice bitterness.  M- Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation.  D- This brew is way too drinkable for a 10% ABV beer. Sure, the alcohol is noticeable in the taste and warming finish, but this one is dangerously drinkable and is almost begging you to take sip after sip.

Sweet and spicy aroma of plums and blood oranges, there is also a nice aroma of sugar. Flavor begins mild and smooth, almost like a rich Cabernet/Merlot. The dominate flavor and aroma is alcohol, it really hits you in the sinuses. Even after a few years, the alcohol is still very intense. Drinkability is low, for me, this beer is better sipped than chugged.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,everetends,4.52,"22 oz bomber thanks to Reino. Poured into a shaped pint. 2007 vintage.  A: Pours a very nice dark caramel color, this sweety is hazy, can't see all the way through it. Got about a finger of head, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in retention. Lacing is a bit thin but always comes back with every pull from the glass. Carbonation bubbles are small and plenty.  S: Dark caramel that is slightly burnt. Malt that is sweet. Cracked pepper, citrus and/or floral hops, and booze. The booze smells more like a bourbon type alcohol rather than just alcohol. Very nice.  T: Nice thick malt up front. The caramel sweetness is nice but not at all overbearing. Slight citrus flavors mingle in this profile. Spices kick in on the back side. Nice amount of flavor and many other rich, dark spices. Alcohol kicks in also on the back side. Not too overpowering.  M: This is a creamy, medium bodied brew. Carbonation is light. Really sticky. Coats palate, tongue and throat. Slight alcohol burn. Mostly spices linger in the aftertaste with some spiciness. Damn nice.  D: So the ABV is high, but this is still highly drinkable. I want more and I want it now. This stacks up very well with AB and OAB. Better than AB, not as good as OAB (but little is).Very good.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Smelled of big, bold malt overripe fruit, brandy. Flavors are huge and very muscular. Bitter as F and taut. Sharp hops, caramelized sugar, rich caramel, roasted malts, candied fruits, piney hops helps balance an otherwise chaotic beer. Underneath all the flavors is the alcohol esters, clearly they are not fibbing when they call this an American Strong Ale. But it feels like a Barley Wine. Fearless, complex, challenging and it will get you F-ed up if you underestimate it.

Good retention with big bubbles. Redish amber with a hazy semi-transparent nature.  Smell is oh so lovely. Sweet aroma with a carmamel likeness, mild alcahol fumes. Sweet piney hop resin, pear, banana?, and then some.  Taste is dangerously smooth with little alcahol flavor for a 10% beer. Burnt caramel upfront with a sweet toasted marshmellow likeness. Big piney hop flavor, cracked peppercorn. Thick and creamy, wonderful carbonation smoothness with a little zing through the middle.  Good beer, a bit sour as it warmed.

147,1056,tendermorsel,4.03,I have had this beer many times just getting around to a review.  2007 batch poured into a tulip glass.  Pours a great carmel brown with a thick foamy head. Great lacing on the sides of my tulip glass.  Pretty piney nose. I also smelled dried fruits in the nose.  This beer is a hop and malt monster. Smooth up front with the bitter hops kicking in in the back end.  This is slow sipper but pretty smooth concidering the high ABV. Actually quite drinkable.  Call me crazy but I this beer is much better with a bit of age on it. When I had the same batch fresh it was very harsh and bitter from the extreme level of hops used in this beer. The one I had last night was much smoother and mellow.  Reccomended. Another great beer from Stone.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S - Bitter citrus grapefruit/pineapple and alcohol. Very pleasant.  T - It is literally Double Bastard. What a great brew. Grapefruit and stiff Uber Hop kick is very balanced and masks the high ABV really well.  M - Great carbonation and body make this one a champ.

The flavor is rich and hoppy and bready. The alcohol is quite apparent throughout the drinking. Raisin and other dark fruit flavor is VERY strong. The feel is flat. Did I get a bad bottle? I was concerned with the no head pour but this is just sad. Syrupy, no carbonation. Tastes like a hopped up cough syrup. I will have to review this as soon as I get a new bottle.

Smell is incredibly complex, sweet caramel, toffee, american hops, and some fruity esters from the yeast (strawberry?)  Taste is very big and sweet followed by a bitter sting from the hops. I'm thinking chinook for the bittering for sure. The malts are HUGE in this beer with a very caramel/toffee like flavor. Heavy mouthfeel due to all the residual sugars leaving a candy like flavor in the mouth.

No apparent activity going on in the glass after it was poured.  Smell- Smell of malt and alcohol, with a mixture of hops and a delicate hint of fruit. I can't quite place the particular type of fruit though.  Taste- Comes on strong but mellows out nicely thru the finish. Very malty with hints of a sweet nature as well. It finishes dry on the palate. Godd carbonation as well. Tastes smoother than by appearance, it has a lighter smoother quality compared to its deep and rich color, for someone who has never had it one would think that it drinks alot heavier than in reality.  I recieved this beer via trade and I am glad I did. This is a great beer that has a full flavor and rich, strong body but is easy to drink.

This is a rich beer for sure.  More apple in the taste, carmel, and nut. A bit of a sweet flavor up front. There are a lot of hops of some sort in here, but plenty of malt to balance it.  Rich thick feel, very dry finish.  At 10% ABV one of these bombers is a good run. Two is pushing it. Not a session beer.  Overall, definitely a nice effort.

Some sweet malty tones of caramel and toffee. A little hop spiciness as well.  Taste is delicious. A nice hop spiciness which adds a nice bitterness on the finish. A nice caramel sweetness really helps balance this beer.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick and creamy with a subtle carbonation.  Drinkability is high. Great flavors definitely make this beer easy to consume, but high alcohol limits that consumption. However, the further I get into this beer the more I realize the drinkability is insane! It is so smooth, delicious, and the alcohol is nonexistent. Except that I'm already running a decent buzz.  *** I recieved this 2006 DB from bket01 in the Up In Smoke BIF, thanks a ton!  consumed on 8/21/08  The pour is incredibly thick, comes out kind of syrupy. It comes out an incredibly hazed, murky, light brown/amber mixture with a thin light tan head on top. That creamy head just sticks to the top of the beer with nice retention a wants to leave lacing all the way down.  I really love the aroma of this beer. Sticky sweet, some fruit and spice. Caramel and toffee still present, seems like some mollases like tones as well.  Wow, the taste is still great. Definitely sweet, but not overly, with a nice bitterness. The caramel and toffee maltiness is there, a nice bit of fruit. Alcohol is well masked, but you can definitely feel the warmth of this brew.  Mouthfeel is incredible. Immensely thick and syrupy and gently carbonated.  Drinkability for a beer like this is insane. Aging did nothing but good for the beer.

147,1056,seaoflament,4.15,"Thanks to Joey for the bottle, this is a 07 vintage.  Pours a strong caramel color but settles an amber and ruby color in the glass. A good half inch of foam amassed and remains for a few minutes. Gotta give this one a little higher on the appearance, after the beer comes to room temperature, a pour produces a mountain of a head that is soft and soapy, really nice looking.  The aroma is of sweet grapefruit. I am reminded, when I was younger, of cutting an orange in half and topping it with sugar. There's some soft notes of pine and citrus with a huge caramel, sweet dark fruits, malt profile. I'm also detecting a little bit of coffee in the background and raw brown sugar. Alcohol is not as strong as one would think, it is hidden behind the massive amount of malt and aroma hops. Love the aroma.  The taste is bitterer than the aroma would lead. The first sensation is a strong hop bite and as you swallow, the bitterness, scrapes your tongue all the way down but almost instantly the sweetness balances it all out. The alcohol appears mostly in the aftermath of everything, just warms the esophagus and stomach. Caramel and brown sugar are definitely there along with sweet raisins and dates. Aside from the aforementioned fruits I'm also getting subtle notes of ripe apples and pears. There's also a bit of chocolate in the aftertaste.  Definitely one to sip, some ageing would definitely help make this one smoother.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,samriggins,4.33,"22oz bought at Anderson's in Toledo, OH. Bottle says 2007 Release.  Is it bad that I was able to drink this in 30 minutes?  Deep mahogony/reddish in color.  Smells of pine and citrus hops with plenty of malt in there too.  Big, big flavor in this beer. Even though the hops are huge(which I love) the malt is there to keep them in check. Great sweetness to back up the bitter hops. I was eating some well aged white cheddar cheese and it really brought out a nutty flavor in the beer. I started getting some of the alcohol towards the end of the beer.  As big as this beer is it is very easy to drink. If I could buy it at home in Nebraska I would be drinking it often.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,dyingwrist,4.5,From a bottle into pint glass. Dark red/brown color. A good 1.5 inch of creamy off white head. Plenty of lacing down the glass. On the nose plenty of hops. They just fill the nose and it is awesome. Nice thick malt taste initially but disappears completely from the bombardment of hops that have a piney floral taste. Great viscous mouthfeel. Carbonation is suspended in the drink. You can't feel it on your palate unless you move it around. Simply a more robust version of arrogant bastard.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Homerbag,4.37,"2007 Batch.  Dark, rusty copper with a thick layer of froth that retained even as this warmed up.  Big aroma of malt and tropical fruits, alcohol is prevalent and so is a hint of dark fruits like plums. No suprise that hops are in the mix being this beer is from the West Coast.  Taste is a wonderful mix of bitter qualities like chocolate, resiny hops, and dark fruit blended with a compliment of tropical fruits, caramel, and sweet malt. Everything compliments, not competes with each other. Alcohol is there, but is very smooth, no burn. Feel is thick and sticky, great flavor retention.  A powerful and fun Ale. This is beer best drank at home, because it is good enough to want more. But more than what you get will make you foolish. Excellent taste and worth aging to mellow out the alcohol.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,czfreeman,4.65,"This Magnificent Double Bastard of a Strong Ale was tasted on-tap at Half Time beverage in Poughkeepskie, NY. The 2005 edition was rolled out and the decadence began. The apperance was maple-syrup thick,amber,a deep golden delicious elixer capped by a thin layer of cream. The aromas were pinapples, super-sappy hops, toasted grainy malts super-charged by a blast of alcoholic phenols. Taste...Not sweet as expected, thank you Stone! Instead we have a rich fruity mouthfeel of caramels,malts,pineapples,apricots,cherry-like sweet/tartness followed by a spicy hop/alcoholic blast. Mouthfeel is so thick,yet balanced fantastically by the alcohol and hops. The drinkablity is fantastic, but due to the alcohol content (and price) this one is a sipper that you never want to end.

A beautiful, complex aroma of soft and sweet maltiness backbone, moderately toasted, some floral like scents.  T + M + D: Man, this is smooth and rich. The body of this is everything I love in the feel of a beer. Pretty much perfect in the feel. The bitter hoppiness is there, but they are amazingly balanced with a soft, and slightly sweet backbone. I find myself pondering over how wonderfully smooth it is again. Stone has created something of a masterpiece with this beer, with a near perfect blend of flavours.

147,1056,davidchollar,4.6,"Picked up my first bottle of Double Bastard at Tanakaya in Tokyo. Poured out a nice chocolate brown with a medium tan head. The foam is thick and fat-bubbled, but doesn't have a whole lot of retention. It does however leave pretty, swirly remnants. This is a good-looking brew.  The smell is good right away, and seems to get better by the minute as it warms and opens up. Butterscotch, dark fruits and cake, with a healthy dose of caramel malt and a shot of brandy. With some deep sniffing I even catch some mango and licorice. At once, this reminds me of barleywines, BSDAs, even a stronger doppelbock! But that is obviously due to the high abv which is due to the high amounts of hops and malt...  The taste quickly set me straight. This is definitely an American strong ale. Yikes. The diatribe was right, my feeble palate is ... undeserving. IBUs rip through and leave my mouth almost aching yet gracious. This is easily the most flavorful beer I've had in a long time. Big smooth mouthfeel. At 10%, and considering the pretty bitter taste, I can't give this a 5 for drinkability. But I definitely liked it and will get it again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Poured from bomber into a goblet a chesnut brownish red with light carbonation and minimal head. Smelled like sweet apricot and heavy spice. Tasted sweet up front with a bitter malty alcohol taste, caramel as it warmed. Warm alcohol burn is there for sure. Unlike ""Arrogant Bastard Ale"" I feel the heavy ABV here. It did taste better as it warmed and it did warm because I had to drink it slow. I am likely to steer clear of this guy in the future and remain a ""Single Bastard"". I am sad to say I did not enjoy this as much as ""Arrogant"", but then that is one of my faves.

Poured into two tumblers, was a clear vivid orangish red with a mess of carbonation, not more than a finger head.  Smelled very spicy, very hoppy.  Taste was very much alcohol, a bit of pear and spice, a bit sweet and syrupy.  Mouthfeel was average, alot of carbonation made this feel a bit odd.  Drinkability is average.

Not much in the way of lacing. Big strong smell with very faint hints of fruity sweet apples, pears, and apricot. Big time flavors comin out of this one. Bitter right up front with heavy malty alcohol flavors. The finish was even more intense with notes of caramel as it warms up.

In the mouth it was medium to full-bodied with good malt richness with balancing hops. The palate was not as dilineated as the nose and showed more chocolate and coffee than the nose. It was also sweeter as the malt showed stronger. This should age well but is great now if in the mood for a sweet malty beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The appearance is reddish- copper brown but not too dark a brown. The head is decent sized and settles to a sticky lace. The aroma has a bite of it's own as one can detect malts,caramel,hops and spicy alcohol. The taste is so complex for me so I will try my best to describe this awesome brew.  It is piney and sweet,but the malts blend so well with the hops. The fruit flavors are popping with a looming alcohol presence.The beer is spicy but not so much to classify it a spicy beer and roasted malts seem to keep things in check. There is a hint of bitterness too, yet I believe this improves the finish. The feel to this brew would be medium body with a smooth,crisp yet creamy finish. One can not ignore the after taste of hops,bitter and sugar on the tongue. The alcohol does spring to life as it warms. The beer is exceptional but nothing to be afraid of.

Taste begins with a little spurt of grapefruit and pineapple before a nice sweetness of caramel, molasses, and brown sugar come into play. Finishes with a nice bittering pine and alcohol warmth. Full in body and low in carbonation, strong and sweet with a good balance and bittering characteristics. As the beer warms, more alcohol presence comes out in a variety of assaults on the taste buds including rum, brandy, and scotch.

It's opaque enough that I can't see my hand on the other side of the glass. Small but chunky head.  Aroma unlike anything I've had before. Can't say that I've ever smelled ripe strawberries from a beer, but this one has it and in an obvious manner. Very sweet and intriguing. Faint citric hops follows the initial sweetness.  My initial taste recognizes the loads of rich malt, but the hops quickly make their presence known. The hops and malts fight for attention resulting in a massive sweetness versus massive bitterness balance. The onslaught of flavor leaves a big aftertaste that lingers seemingly without end.  Highly drinkable for such a big beer. I had a difficult time pacing myself.  Though American Strong Ale is somewhat of a catch-all style, I believe Double Bastard sets the benchmark quite nicely. This is one to seek out.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,soulgrowl,4.3,"I never thought I'd find this beer in Japan. Yay Tanakaya!  Appearance: Deep yet mostly clear nectarine brown, glowing a sunset orange red in the highlights. Head is tall, sticky, airy, parchment-colored, and very long-lasting, especially for the beer's strength.  Smell: Hugely fruity, with a pineapple aroma you can smell without even trying; orange oil is a big player here, too, along with a hint of cherry pie, but nothing can touch that pineapple. But this beer goes deeper than light fruitiness; the volatile hops and alcohol lend notes of dry grass and coconut rum, and underneath it all lies a solid malt foundation of sticky toffee, caramel, brown sugar, and whole-wheat bread.  Taste: Mighty fine, mighty fine indeed. Its alcohol presence and permeating bitterness might be a bit over-the-top (I worry that it interferes with malt nuances), but on the other hand, that's what makes this beer awesome. Sweet at first, with surprisingly forward vinous notes - think sweet red wine, maybe even brandy - plus plenty of caramel and dark bread. The darker side of the malts give way to a lighter but still sweet fruity/floral liqueur-like flavor, reminiscent of Cointreau, Drambuie (!) and dark rum, a harbinger of hops and alcohol to come. Then the bitterness lands on the palate like a torrential rain, bringing with it raw, resiny hop-juice flavor and a warming alcohol spice. The beer closes on this bitterness, demanding strong cheese.  Mouthfeel: Quite slick and lip-smacking; thick, and softly carbonated as well. Not what I would call syrupy thanks to the drying alcohol; perhaps oily is a better word.  Drinkability: This is one intense beer, even for its strength. I think I prefer the original Bastard because the flavors seem a bit more in focus, but this is a nice, complex, enjoyable sipper as well.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

I didn't get a whole lot of hops in this smell.  T: Definitely dominated by the initial malty sweetness with heavy caramel and brown sugar yumminess. I got a bit more of the hops in the taste and it was balanced very well given the ABV.  M: Syrupy but prickly, this definitely coats your mouth but has enough carbonation to tickle the tongue a bit.

147,1056,bluemoonswoon,4.4,"Big thanks to JoeyBeerBelly for this one, my first and certainly not my last beer from Stone. 22oz bottle partially poured into a Duvel snifter.  A: Pours a super dark and clear cherry wood with a two inch super tightly packed sandy white head which is impressive to see on a beer this size. It goes away and fades to a ring which was to be expected I suppose but still leaves some amazing lacing down the sides of the glass.  S: This is something right here. So many times beers this size whack you over the head with over-the-top aromas this beer is an exercise in balance and subtleness. The rich malts are balanced out by a strong hop backbone that keeps everything in check. Good amount of resiny hops, blackstrap molasses, cherries, wonderful.  T/MF: This beer reminds me a whole helluva lot like Bigfoot but smoother and less of a hop nuclear bomb. Deep and mellow citrus, like pineapple, sweet grapefruit and cherry all work together in a wonderfully slick bittersweetness of an opening. The mouthfeel is incredibly silky in spite of this bitterness and is where the maltiness gets to shine though in all of its wonderfully rich indulgent sweetness. I feel that this beer does not need that many words, it is an experience in itself. Huge and small at the same time.  D: This is a big beer and is like I said before sweet in spite of its bitterness, this sweetness is unlike anything else, it is rich and heavy and demands your attention.

I'm sure I'm not worthy, but nevetheless here goes: Dark coppery pour into a Duvel tulip glass. Off white head wells up from the depths. Intense fruity aroma, sweet fruits, alcohol dominate the nose. Flavor is a beautifully balanced blend of malty sweetness and a deep grapefruit bitterness which lasts a very long time in the finish.The depth of the flavors is quite impressive. This beer would stand up to any of the great Belgian ales for complexity although the hops put it into a category of its own. The more it warms the more interesting it becomes and the hops become more intense. Alcohol becomes a bit more prominent as well. Syrupy, prickly mouthfeel which becomes softer as the beer warms. Carbonation lasts forever on the tongue. For such a strong beer, this is very easy to drink. THe alcohol is there and I'm sure I'll pay soon enough, but for now it's not really obvious that this is a 10% abv beer. I've pretty much sworn off of cheese for health reasons but I have to have a super sharp cheddar with this beer. Worthy or not, I do plan to drink this beer again, whenever I can find it.

This is what A.B. was supposed to be. I had feared that everything I didn't like about A.B. would be amplified in its ""Doubled"" version, but somehow, this was not the case. it tastes like they beefed up the malt backbone but didn't add many (if any) more hops. this was a rather judicious decision. The result is a big malty brew that masks the 10% ABV rather nicely.  M: Thick, chewy... no messing around.

Aroma is hugely hoppy with tons of west-coast citrus and pine, but there's also a big caramel sweetness.  Flavor follows the nose pretty closely, as malty sweetness fills your mouth, nearly inducing chewing. Hops then rip through the palate with a massive dose of oily grapefruit rind. Alcohol is quite apparent but not in a yucky way. It's more peppery and sweet.  Mouthfeel is thick and well-carbonated.

S- Caramel and hoppy with a killer alcohol smell. Just a small bit buttery.  T- Alcohol is strong for sure. The malty backbone is prominent along with brutal bittering hops.  M- Medium to thick and high carbonation.  D- Nice brew but very stong on all of the senses.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,dnichols,4.52,"I shared a bomber (22 ounces) with a friend while bottling two home-brew batches.  A: It poured a clear and amber body with a slightly off-white, very modest head that fell fast and left little trace or lacing.  S: It hit me with a blast of floral hops followed by sweet malts and hints of alcohol.  T: It initially had a strong grapefruit bite from the hops. As the beer reseted the hop presence receded and the strong creamy and sweet toasted malt flavor come to the front. Like other big Stone brews this one was balanced robust malt flavors with sharp and flavorful hops.  M: It was medium bodied and syrupy with little carbonation and a clean and warm finish.  D: This is a very substantial sipping beer. Solid hop and malt balance with a warm and clean finish.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,marksto,4.42,"2007 release, poured from 22 oz bottle with a long, nonsensical diatribe imprinted on the back that just begs for analysis after you've had a few...  Pours a ruby-caramel color with medium head, good retention, and some noticible viscocity. Aroma displays thick, chewy malt sweetness, a matching fruity undertone, and a touch of hops and alcohol. Flavor has nice depth, dimension, and balance; with malt sweetness, hop bitterness, and alcohol intermingling nicely. Coats the tongue with a tangy, fruity, hop and malt concotion that begs for more as it fades.  Overall, this beer stradles the line between an old ale and barley wine, though it has that citrusy hop essence that defines it as an all-American version of either. Very nice beer, recommended.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Jmamay22,4.15,"Pours a clear dark orange amber. The head eventually settles to a thin wispy cap with a thicker collar. Some spotted lacing no doubt attributed to the hops left behind despite the minute head.  Very boozy and comes off as a barleywine's cousin. Lots of citrus hops. Interesting hints of caramel and possibly chocolate. A tad too much fusel going on for my nose.  Taste tart and bittering due to the hops, but the mouthfeel is creamy and top notch. Balanced in a jangled Stone sort of way. The caramel is surely present to fight a losing battle with the grapefruit and pine. Finishes with a bashing of alcohol and hops. Its difficult to tell where the bitterness from the hops start and end and the alcohol takes over.  A sipper and a bomber worthy of sharing. I think I may prefer the regular Arrogant Bastard because its less brash. Maybe I'm just not worthy? Comes off as an American Barleywine in my book, but who cares for style guidelines?",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,charlzm,4.15,"bottled, consumed 11/13/07.  Pours a deep golden brown with a plentitude of swirling tiny bubbles. The head is modest off-white/tan and dissipates quickly to a thin off-white skin.  Big hoppy aroma of grapefruit with some molasses notes, too. Thick, slick mouthfeel with a cola-like carbonation/mild burn. Sweet and malty in the front and cleanly bitter and lingering in the back. Alcohol flavor is there, but not as noticeable as you'd expect a 10% beer to be.  Man, this is a good, well-balanced beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,RedHaze,2.73,"2007 Release.  Pours a deep mahogany with a dense two finger head that fades slowly to a solid cap. The lacing is very sticky, leaving a thick sheeting of foam behind.  Smell; brown sugar and caramel malts dominate this one, but there's also a mild undercurrent of some fruits. Oranges and peaches, with a toch of cherries. Some alcohol adds a bit of spiciness to the aroma.  Taste; sweet, with brown sugar, caamel and sugar covered dates and then a big wave of hop bitterness kicks you in the mouth. The fruits are present, but are a bit harder to pick out idue to a harsh bitter, almost metallic taste, with an overpoweringly strong alcohol presence. .  Mouthfeel is full bodied and a bit on the syrupy/sticky side, and the drinkability is low due to the big alcohol presence and off metallic flavor.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

So sad that there is no stone in wisconsin, makes me miss new york  A- poured a reddish amber pretty dark almost brown with a heavy tan head of tight knit bubbles which laid on top for a little bit but didnt stay long at all. Clear body  S- amber scents, some hop bitterness underneath, smooth slightly piney hop character. Lots of malts throughout  T- heavy maltiness smooth, amber character, strong bitterness, more bitter than floral character, solid smooth, the bitterness grows as the beer leaves your tongue, giving a nice almost grassy piney character which is a really nice finish  M- full body, medium carbonation  D- pretty sweet ale another solid drinking choice",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

It's a dark reddish orange, quite hazy, and almost syrupy in pour consistency out of the bottle. There is little head, but what is there settles to a ring. Big, spicy malty aromas up front followed by some nice orangey citrus and piney hops. This beer has a quite interesting malty flavor profile up front- almost as if there were toasted rice and barley in it. This is followed by a fruity sweetness that is furthr followed by a long bitter citrus flavor and a nice oily, piney hop finish. Mouthfeel is pure and clean but big and with a touch of sweetness. This isn't sticky or cloying at all and is quite balanced by the toasted flavors and the hops. Surprisingly drinkable. Not as harsh and more integrated than many Stone brews. I'm not always a fan of all of their brews, but this one deserves its accolades.

147,1056,ojiikun,4.39,"Found on draft at the strong beer fest at Collins in Seattle. Presumed to be the most recent vintage.  Served in a 10oz stubby wine glass, the body is dark, muddy brown with near zero head. There's a loose ring of bubbles on the edge of the glass and a bit of doily lace on the surface.  Smell is of citrus zest and white sugar. Light caramel notes appear as things warm up. The first wave reminds me raspberry preserves.  Sweet! Tons of candied hops and lots of blonde malts. Alcohol doesn't even remotely try to hide, but this is used to good effect as would be expected in a Brandy or Cognac. Hops manage to be tart rather than sour or bitter. Early finish is of very unripe green apple skins and is trailed by a somewhat leathery and minty cocoa.  Clean on the lips but heavy on the throat, this brew needs more bubbles! The saving grace here is a total lack of bitters. For it's gravity and hop profile, this is quite drinkable. Too drinkable. I love it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,dsa7783,4.52,"1 Pint 6 fl oz bottle copped from Buy Rite on Oak Tree in South Plainfield... Sampled the regular Arrogant Bastard, and the Oak Aged Arrogant Bastard, but this is by far the best of the three, hands down... Appearance is a beautiful dark-copper, mahogany, ruby-red colored hue with a massive foamy and frothy head that was very hesitant to recede... Smell was literally bursting with fresh hops, caramel, and slight malts - very strong and powerful smell, full of character... Taste is in-your-face, bursting with flavor, top-of-the line stuff... Replete with fresh hops, balanced by a nice touch of malts and esters, and rounded out by a hint of caramel, vanilla, honey, and bittersweet sugars... Ultra-rich, and thick mouthfeel, bursting with noticeable flavor and super-rich character... One of the best beers I've ever sampled from Stone... excellent stuff, without a doubt... Drinkability only took a slight hit due to the very hefty 10% ABV, which, by the way, is hard to detect behind a rich conglomeration of amazing flavors... Great stuff...

A singular flavor indeed, it has a fullness of flavor that most ales can only dream of...it is of course a large proposition, with a massive amount of hops, and while the body is quite strong, the 10% does not sneak up on you so much as smack you in the face.  When your hops haven't mellowed any more that this in two years, you've put a lot in!  A pleasure.

S: Smells of candy like citrus hops, bits of toasted malt here and there, but citrusy, leafy hops really dominate.  T: Taste of hops, caramel, bit of alcohol. Good sweetness that is snuffed out by big hop bitterness. Bit of spiciness, nice citrus hop twang that sticks around as well. Leaves a nice bittersweetness on the palate.

Deep ruby coloring, tiny hint of browns/amber shading. Tight eggshell head, a bit more than I'd expect of a beer this strong.  S: Woof - i think i get the fruits, but it's like fruits that have been soaked in bourbon for awhile.  T: Yup, definitely been soaked in something for awhile. I really am NOT worthy of this, so early in my craft-brew days. The taste puts my mouth through the ringer and back out again. I don't have the words to accurately describe what just happened, I'll have to come back and review a second bottle when I'm all growed-up.  M: It feels quite tasty on the palate. Overall much smoother than I would expect. It's like it greeted me by punching me in the nose, but then offered to hang my coat up for me.  D: Strong indeed.

Sediment was visible in the bottom of the glass and the fluid shined a beautiful dark amber when put up to the light. Very nice.  S- Sweet dark fruits and a smoky oak aroma, mixed with some strong hops and a bit of alcohol tingle.  T- Strong fermented dark fruits, a bit more wood chips, and a very strong hop character in the flavor profile. This one can best be described as the bigger, stronger brother of the original AB, which was a phenomenal beer in and of itself.  M- Tingly from the strong hops and alcohol but creamy, thick and smooth in texture. This one pushes the limits of all the things that a great beer can be, and for that I am thankful to have had the opportunity to taste it.  D- Very drinkable for such a high ABV; the tingle is pleasant rather than offputting and the delicious flavor demands to be sipped on over and over again.

147,1056,IBUnit63,4.45,"Rich, 2-finger head. Dark caramel color - looks dangerous. Translucent, not quite opaque. Light lacing on the head.  Velvety malt and balanced hops and alcohol aroma. Slightly floral hop backbone. Caramel and vanilla emerge - maybe even a little praline?  This has it all in over-abundance - malt, ops, alchohol. I say it's well-balanced only because the brute force of each of the boulder of malt, sledgehammer of alchohol and anvil of hops are pretty much equal.  The hops and their tang and bitterness tingle while the bountiful malt and alcohol coat the mouth. This stuff is positively amazing.  Drinkability? More than you probably should! Let's put it this way...about 7-8 years ago we watched a Martha Stewart show on the Food Network where she's making her signature egg nog for New Year's. The recipe looked awesome and at the end of the show she pours a mugful and with this pseudo-Satanic grin she stares into the camera and says, ""Remember...one glass per person."" Of course we made a batch, which turned out better than expected, ignored her admonishment and wound up pretty well $#!+-faced.

147,1056,Gehrig,4.73,"Having enjoyed Ruination so much this past week, I decided to grab a bottle of Double Bastard from the very good selection at Hiller's in Northville before heading home. I'm more than glad that I did. It's outstanding. This is very close to perfection, a beer whose whole is greater than the sum of the collective parts.  The presentation is glorious--a finger of dense tan froth that won't quit, nestled atop cloudy brown body with cider-orange highlights--incredible. The nose is a terrific amalgam of caramel, brown sugar, and hops, with hints of fruit, as is the taste. I'm completely impressed with how well integrated the hops, sweetness, and overtures of bitterness are. Phenomenal.  The mouthfeel is certainly smooth in texture, but nicely complex with occasional percolations of grittiness that are easy to tolerate in such a smooth, tasty beer. Only the Deacon Jones head slap that this beer delivers with its very high ABV (10%) lowers this a small notch below eminently drinkable. yet don't be misled--this is still highly and deceptively drinkable, a beer requiring one to gladly set aside the keys.  Yet again I've come across a glorious, great beer that will make frequent appearances in my refrigerator. Truly outstanding, Double Bastard ranks right there with Brown Shugga as my favorite strong ales.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Very nice creaminess and a small hints of dark fruit.  Mouth feel is filling. Slight warming, but not what could be expected from a lesser brew.

147,1056,tayner,4.03,"on tap at Papago Brewing  It came to me a burnt amber color with a nice large foamy head that laced my glass nicely.  smelled of hops and malt.. not the flowery hops i dislike so much but more of a earthy, piney hop flavor.  Taste was slightly bitter, made you notice it, but it was one of the more balanced stone offerings i have had. There was a strong enough malt backbone to balance all the flavors and make it very tasty.  It was heavy but not thick. easy to drink.  I could drink a couple of these if i hadnt been driving home.. but i did grab a growler for when i got home :)  2006 bottle on 10-28: This is not the same beer aged at all. Where did the hops go?

There is also some great spices swirling in the mix.  T: Strong bitter and alcohol taste but the citrus and spices are top quality. The great part is that the taste keeps on coming and gently tapers off after several minutes.  M: Bitter in the mouth but still tingles and makes your mouth scream for more.

I love Arrogant Bastard and Oaked Arrogant Bastard, but this is a different animal. The sweet malts in this is balanced perfectly by the hoppiness in the background and a little alcohol burn to boot.

Poured a deep reddish mahogany.  Aroma is an amazing blend of sweet maltiness and piney hops. Spicy alcohol and some dark fruits.  Taste is exquisite. I don't know how you could improve this. Caramel maltiness, sweet burnt sugars, pine and citric hop flavors all blending together. Alcohol is spicy and goes well with the bitterness and carbonation.  Creamy smooth mouthfeel with just enough bitterness bite. Very drinkable for something that's 10%. You just don't want it to end.  What's amazing is how mature the 2007 batch already seems. Normally I enjoy this aged about a year, but it's already fantastic. I need to pick up more of this and if you can find it you should too.

A: Big layer of head, off-white in color, which appears frothy and bubbly but actually retains very well. The beer is a darkish orange caramel color, with strong amber tones as well. Some spotty lacing, with slippery rings that slowly dissolve down the sides. S: A very pleasant mixture of citrus hops, sweet malts, and a big floral bouquet. Really not what I expected at all, but this is very nice. Pretty well-balanced and fruity/sweet/malty/hoppy all at once. T: Citrus and floral hops, followed by some sugars that fade into a lingering bitterness rather than a sicky-sweetness. Overall, strong tastes of caramel malts, bitter citrus, and acidic/oily hops. Pretty good overall, but the aftertastes is a little odd, and there's not a strong malt backbone, which is what I expected. M: Tingly and bitter at first, and this continues with a nice hop bite. Strong alcohol feel in the finish. D: Not bad, I guess. Smell is great, but the taste and mouthfeel are a bit lacking.

Strong hops with shades of grapefruit/pineapple/other fruitiness, hops, pine, malt, caramel, brown sugar. Nice warming alcohol finish. Masks the high ABV very well.  Great feel on the tongue, just the right consistency.  I could sip this beer all night. I heat the 05' on tap was even sexier; I wish I would have sampled it.

Extreme fruitiness and a intense bitterness that cuts through the heavy body. Aftertaste is quite bitter, but doesn't linger overly long. Booziness is surprisingly subdued (for a 10% ale) due to the hugeness of the other flavours. I'm getting flavours of apple, pine, generic rich fruit, molasses.

Big malts, caramelt, sugary, sweet. Some heat from the big, bold bastard of a beer. Taste follows smell and then some. Hard to pick up on everything going on here. I'd say the hop presence is as big as the regular bastard, which is pretty damn hoppy to me but the malt here is more reinforcing and provides more complexity. Grapefruit, sappy pine, biscuity malt, caramel, brown sugar, pineapple, just a few things going on. Excessively drinkable in a good and bad way. Double the bastard, double the fun!

The smell is woody with redwood and oak, and some strong caramelly malt and grainy bread. Noticeable alcohol smells warm the nose.  The taste follows the nose and is very strong, with an up front tannin dominance of wood and bitterness. It definitely becomes more complex as I drink it, a characteristic present in many 'big beers' that kind of numb the palate as you go, revealing more of the depth. It has a running smoothness in the malt with some grain and caramel tastes. The initial rounded sweetness is quickly replaced by a bitter warmth on the back end. Finishes with a sticky clinging bite that is almost chewy, with a robust aftertaste of grains, still hanging in the bitterness.

The head is big, 2 plus fingers of white and lots of lace.  The smell is huge hops, and a nice malt to boot.  The taste follows, this brew is really quite big, When you talk DIPA here is the poster child. Extreme hops, grapefruit and pine tar, spread of lightly toasted biscuits. It could be a bit to sweet in the quest for balance.  The mouthfeel is big this and puckering, big thick, very good.  The drinkability is only for the worthy, I'll have it fresh any time.

Well balanced with the malt backbone coming through. Dried figs, maybe? Just a hint of alcohol as it warms up  T: A blast of piney hops that is ridiculously well-balanced. The malt backbone reveals tons of caramel and sweetness. There's hints of dark raisins and dried figs in there. The finish is long and bitter.  M: Silky smooth with the right amount of carbonation.  D: Something this strong and so tasty has to approached with care. This is definitely a sipper disguised as a quaffer.  4.5/4.5/5/5/4  **Edit 29 Nov 2011** It's been 3 years since my review, and while I haven't drunk as much of this beer as I thought I would, I still remain very impressed with it. I'm taking my scores down to better reflect the changes in my palate. However, the succulent, juicy blend of hops with pine, pineapple and grapefruit with dark caramel, a little cocoa and a mild sweetness. The flavors on the palate are the same as the nose would suggest, and while this is boozy, this never gets overbearing.

Thick sticky head and alot of lacing atop a deep clear amber/copper brew.

Damn.. tastes like a sweeter barleywine.. big burly bitter backbone.. balanced by a very sweet but not cloying maltiness. Huge pine and citrus hop flavors and caramel toffee... hops and malts kung fu fight for control of my palate... Fairly thick body and an assertive but small bubble carbonation... fair amount of yeasty fruitiness adds well to the overall complexity... Very aggressive and subtle at the same time... more like a kung fu ballet.  This is the 4th year I've had this brew, and I can tell you I only have 1 '06 in the cellar... It is always a goto beer anytime I can't pick something out... after tonight, I am thinking I am going to have to get a case and let them mellow in the box, out of sight out of temptation.

147,1056,jmalex,3.78,"2007 release. I had last year's quite a bit both on tap and in the bottle. I'm glad to have a fresh one to review.  APPEARANCE: Pours into a becker glass a dark russet brown with some crimson notes. The head starts out just under one finger and shrinks slowly to a thick collar and full surface covering. Quite good.  SMELL: Big hops with a malty base to match. The beer smells sweet and bready with a sticky sweet resinous dose of the traditional Stone hop profile. Piny and citrusy, they certainly make their presence known, but don't overshadow the malt base which is an equally important component in this beer.  TASTE: It starts as a huge alcohol bomb; the 10% is quite evident. It's tremendously sweet with the alcohol almost serving to cut through and balance it. But the hops come soon enough and don't overpower the malt at all. In fact, they could be more intense.  MOUTHFEEL: It thick and slick and carbonated on the lower end of things. The beer lingers long after you swallow and coats your mouth entirely.  DRINKABILITY: It suffers considerably with a high ABV that really shows itself. Really, this drinks like an American barleywine. One bottle please, maybe even to split.  It definitely seems a bit harsh when fresh and I'm sure aging would help in that regard. But the already weak hops (comparatively) would surely dissipate more, so it's a bit of a catch-22. Still, it's a very nice beer, and I'll be buying at least 1 bomber each year.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

I couldn't save it, but shared it with bwatson. It poured a murky amber into a chalice, kind of looks like the Kansas River on a summer day. Almost no head in my chalice, but bwatson got a little head off of his pour. The smell is a trip in itself. At first, you just smell hops, raisins, but then later on, the sweet pineapple and piney smells come through. It's awesome. The taste is exceptional: caramel, pineapple, hops. It's a ride.

Lots of citrus hops balance the sweetness well. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Delicious. Full bodied mouthfeel and not overly carbonated which I think suits this beer perfectly.

Almost no head with little lacing; very low carbonation in general.  This is a great smell for a beer--a strong ale with sweet pineapple (not tart), burnt raisin and roast hits. I like where this is going ...  Taste--very good and interesting. Alcohol masked well to the point that if I didn't know, I'd think it was a normal ABV--it's there, but you have to find it and it comes on late.  Although the carbonation is lower than I usually like, but it feels more gentle than flat. This adds to the drinkability, which could be considered a benefit or danger. This ale has a nice mouthfeel with just enough sweetness to balance out the robust, mature base, which has plenty of bitterness--I like that. I am not a fan of sweet beers, and this is not a sweet beer, but its sweetness is a lovely peripheral aspect that doesn't fade into the rest of the beer, nor is it overwhelming. It's just one of the many characteristics of this interesting, complex beer.

Big, syrupy malt and bastardly drunken toasted malt that keeps punching you in the stomach, pinching your daughter's ass and telling you that your wife is a whore.  Tastes thick. Just--thick. There's some very large hops and some very thick caramely syrup malt that--well let me put it this way: when I was working at a gas station in high school we had to change the fountain pop syrup. One time the bag of Mountain Dew syrup had ruptured before we opened the box that contained it. Blackgreen goo dripped out its side and it smelled like the most refreshingly synthetic Mountain Dewiness you could ever imagine, so strong that we were tempting to lick it but we stopped ourselves, knowing that after tasting it regular Mountain Dew would no longer we worth our time.

As the beer warms it becomes more robust but remains smooth and easy to drink. My kind of beer as it's sweet, sticky and highly dry-hopped. The aroma plays a big role with each sip bringing with it the warming effect of the alcohol and all the herbal oils of the piney hops.

Brilliant hues of ruby copper and an orange-tan head. The head doesn't last too long, and doesn't deliver great lace, but it's a damn pretty beer. The nose is potent, and much stronger than either the normal Bastard or the Oaked, in my opinion. It's rich, with strong malts, but also extremely fruity. The aroma is filled with scent of strawberry and dark cherry, more so than just about any beer I've ever had, including lambics. Seriously, it almost reminds me of sticking my nose in a cherry pie. It's that fruity. And yet, the taste takes you a completely different direction. It's denser and darker. Blunt, in a word. Strong with alcohol, rich with dark malts and strong spice, and bitter with a serious hop finish. Malted cough syrup comes to mind at times. The mouthfeel is dense and concentrated, as it should be with an old ale.  This beer isn't lacking in any department, as everything seems to hit hard and fast in both aroma and flavor, but I'm not so sure everything works together all at once. I definitely think this beer is complex, and it requires some serious contemplation. And it's most definitely a sippin' beer. Take your time with this one and savor every moment.

The second pour introduced some minor particulate that stayed suspended.  I expected more aroma.... but it was rather slight. I could pick up hints of a citrus hops and a carmel/toffee sweetness.  The TASTE: WOW.... right between the eyes (in a good way)! First wave is a big citric bitterness from the hops (almost a lime-like tang). There is a big alcohol presence here as well. Hey.... don't mask it... let it club you over the head.... this is supposed to be an extreme beer! A little bit of buttery smoothness. There is some toasted malt in there.... trust me, it's there.... just not dominant.... The hops are the boss here.  Mouthfeel: Fairly thick and robust. Carbonation is about right. Good mouth coating and a bitter aftertaste (not bad).  Drinkability: I don't think this beer is intended to be a session beer.... 22 oz. is plenty for my ""session"".

Taste had hops and bitterness up front, but followed quickly by a nice malt balance and smoothness. This is very easy to drink for the hop fan, easier than IPA's in many ways because of the balance of hops and malt. Mouthfeel was good, but not exceptional.

147,1056,akorsak,4.2,"This is an '05 vintage served on-tap at the Blind Tiger's 12/12/12/12 Stone event.  A: The ale has an amber color, showing off red highlights that add a nice splash of color. Little head resulted from the pour but there is a clear stream of carbonation in the glass.  S: The nose is malty thick, having lost a majority of the bitter hops that define Double Bastard. Aging has done wonders on this beast, softening it significantly.  T: As the nose hinted, this beer has become a solid barleywine, with the hops mellowing out significantly and allowing the malts to come through. A sip reveals a whole mouthfeel of grain, thick in its strength. The malt flavors are as strong as ever but they are more noticeable because the hops have receded significantly. While Double Bastard burns the tastebuds when fresh, with two years under its belt it has softened and smoothed itself out. This is a good sippin' beer for in front of a fireplace on a cold night.  M: The mouthfeel has come around 180 degrees, from a hop bomb to a malt bomb. That change makes for a really good, complex drink.  D: This was my 4th offering at 12/12/12/12. I would gladly have tried any of the four again. I was especially fond of the smoothness that this beer picked up.

That is all you get. There is no balancing sweetness, no hoppy complexity. Nothing but overly bitter piney hops. I really enjoy the Arrogant Bastard ale, but this is definitely a step backwards.  Mouthfeel: Coats the mouth a bit too much with the too bitter flavor of the beer. A less than enjoyable flavor is something you don't want sticking around for such a long time.  Drinkability: This is probably the lowest review that I have given such a highly rated beer. I was disappointed by the one dimensional taste and the high ABV makes it hard to enjoy too much.

Candy maltiness from someone else's review is a good way to put it. Caramel, toffee and ever so slight breadiness in the malt profile. A strange citrus/melon combo to the hop aroma which overall is pretty subdued. Some alcohol heat is noticable on the nose. I thought it smelled very nice, though my wife thought it smelled like cherry cough syrup.  Initial taste of sweet malt and caramel is pretty quickly though not completely supplanted by a difinitive hop bitterness. This beer is not exactly what I would call effervescent, but its not anywhere near syrupy for such a high ABV. It actually finishes suprisingly smooth.  I want to give this one another shot at which point I'll edit this review. Overall I thought it was quite good and worth the wait, but I want to make sure that anticipation is not skewing my perception.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,dreadnatty08,4.69,"Pours a dark ruby color, mostly translucent with a full inch of light brown head. Unlike aromas from AB, this one gives off much more malty notes, fruity caramel, estery plums and raisins. Only in the back are resiny hops evident and even then, the candy maltiness reigns. On the palate, it becomes more evident that this should fall into the double IPA catagory as the hops, in their freshness balance quite well with the syrupy malts. Finishes pretty sweet with crystal malts mixing well with darker, perhaps chocolate malts. It really just is a supremely balanced beer for how big it is. I wouldn't put any age on this one, it's like a fresh Bigfoot. How enjoyable this beer is, I'm glad to finally try it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Kendo,4.32,"A: 2007 bomber, poured into a Stone Double Bastard glass -- it's kind of like a combination snifter and highball glass; let's call it a small, curved highball glass. . . . Body is dark brown with a small ivory head that disappears pretty quickly. Some visible bubbles slowly rise. No lacing left behind.  S: Mmmm. Great combination of sweet, caramel malt, citrusy and floral hops and booze.  T: First impression: it finishes hot. After a couple sips adjusts my palate to that heat, I can figure out what else is going on. In a word: balance. There's brown sugar and caramel malt early, followed by fruity wet hops. Hot alcohol heat at the back end of the sip and on the way down the gulley. Bitterness lingers and - ""oddly enough,"" I wrote -- the hops actually seem more pronounced as it warms (I think it's because it takes a little while to adjust the tastebuds to the alcohol heat). Reminds me at times of a Barleywine or even a DIPA in both taste and aroma.  M: Medium-to-heavy in heft. Pretty creamy, but with a bit of a bite to it.  D: Good. It's definitely a sipper (hence the style of Stone's official DB glass), but a tasty one.  Notes: This was a fresh bottle. I've done a 3 year vertical tasting in the past and seem to recall that the Double Bastard ages well. I've got a 2004 in my cellar and now a couple more of the 2007 bottles, so I'll report back some day on how the DB does after various amounts of time spent in the cellar. . . .",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,wheelinshirt,3.85,"I've been lusting after this one for a bit, saw it at Capone's in norristown and decided i have to have it ($8 price tag be damned). Been in my fridge for a week or two, finally cracked it open.  22 oz bomber, shared with no one (a bit of a mistake, share with two or three and have some other beers on hand). Color is deep mahogony, tight head that recedes to a collar and leaves some lacing.  Smell is mostly malt and booze with a good hop kick, basically what you would expect from stone. Taste is similar, sweet malts and american hops with a lot of booze. Very good, if a bit repetitive. Not blown away, but it is good.  Mouthfeel is medium, maybe medium heavy, some good carbonation lightening up the body and making it drinkable. I guess this beer is kind of like an american barleywine but lighter in character, thereby more drinkable. I like it, but a 22 oz bomber by oneself is a bit much, a bit repetitive and a bit expensive. Probably won't return to this.

147,1056,Tolann,4.62,I've been waiting for this one for a while. I was really taken back by the Arrogant Bastard.  Here we go!  A - Ruby mahogany with a dense head not too thick and fades quickly  S - Wow sweet hops. Carmel and malt. Fruity something or another. Maybe grapefruit or something.  T - Hop kick in the back of the throat first. Caramelly malt and fruity sweetness on the tongue.  M - Lively and medium/light body. Warms your mouth after the sip. Almost sits in your chest feeling roasty. The sip seems to coat your mouth with warm sweet hops and caramel. Makes me burpy tho. LOL  D - I'm already thinking about buying another bottle. Very good beer and very enjoyable. The sweetness and hoppyness go well together. I'm really liking this beer. Another great beer from Stone!

147,1056,msubulldog25,4.08,"From the 2007 Release; a 22 oz. bottle, poured to a snifter. For all the Stone beer I've ever tried, this could be the first I've had of the Double Bastard. Oh, the humor in that silk-screened diatribe on the label...  A: Clear, ruddy mahogany. Equivalent of the bottle's brownness and clarity, tinged with a deeper reddish glow. Hardly any head, only a scattering of film whispers and a slim ring of cream. Ominously still, with just the narrowest streams of tiny carbonation...from a distance, could be bourbon in that snifter just as easily as ale. Sliding bits of off-white lace gently fade into the glass.  S: Smells of over-the-top sweetness, hugely malty with caramel and candy. There's some dark fruit in there, syrupy cherry and raisin and a hint of spice. And not all the aromas are big malts; there's a rich, herbally grassy hop nose, too.  T: Sugared malts for certain, but plenty of citrus-orange/tangerine hopping. Lots of caramel, a little on the burnt side with subtle nuttiness. There's a remnant of barrel-like woodiness and a bittering of citrus pith.  M: Big and chewy, warm and thickening, layers of hops and sticky malt on the tongue draw in the cheeks. For a 10% abv beer, this has a pleasing balance and has a heat that's quite subtle. Creamy and smooth, with a carbonation that melts away like butter. Not the cloyingly sweet mouthfeel I've experienced before with Stone's big beers.  D: Big, bold & flavorful...but a sipper that I couldn't finish in one sitting. Hops are intense, sweet malts even moreso - after a half-bottle the flavors become oppressive on the tongue. Still, awfully good - a 'must try' for the big beer enthusiast.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,John_M,3.7,"Perhaps I would have enjoyed this beer more if I hadn't had it right after the 10th Anniversary DIPA. For that matter, I wonder if Stone has tweaked the recipe over the years, as I've found this beer far more appealing in the past then I did at Frisco's last night.  The beer pours a darkish amber color with very good head retention and lacing. The beer looks quite impressive. On the nose I get sweet malt, cider and roasted nuts. Again, this beer smells very impressive, although the high abv. is noticeable even on the nose. On the palate the beer is sweet, rich and very alcholic, but with a drying hop burn in the finish. The beer is impressive, but frankly I don't feel as if the high abv. blends in all that well with the very sweet malt and hoppiness. I found the beer somewhat tiring on the palate, with this beer coming across as a sweet, but then ultimately very hoppy, barleywine.  The beer is very warming and, while impressive, is just not all that enjoyable. In the same style I much prefer the Bigfoot, where the sweet malt has been dialed down a tad. A good beer, but not what I would call terrific.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Hops only come through in the finish/aftertaste, and then are present as a basic, earthy bitterness, but not terribly distinct. Delicious to drink, and easy to drink and enjoy, but not the most dynamic or complex beer: it's really about malt sweetness and malt body.  Mouth: thick, full, sweet, and delicious. Relatively little alcohol burn given the ABV.  Overall: A totally different beer than what I've had in the bottle.

A = Deep reddish brown, good clarity, good thick, tan head consisting of various sized bubbles, leaves good lacing.  S = Rich smell of earth, caramel, roasted malt, hops, sweet floral notes. Very complex, but I wish the scent were stronger. It's there but a little lowkey.  T = Awesome beer. It has very good balance, a rich malty flavor at the start, but then some good hops bitterness appears and carries over into a long finish. Reminds me more of an English Old Ale, than most American brews. Very complex tastes, nuts, cream, bananas, I could go on and on, but it boils down to an exceptional taste.  M = Heavy mouthfeel. This is a substantive beer (like liquid bread). Pleasant light carbonation, giving it a frothy feel when you swallow.  D = The high ABV is the only reason I give this a 4 instead of a 4.5. I love this beer and would happily drink it anytime and would attempt to drink it all night if I could have back about 20 years to relive my misspent youth.  Edit: I cellared several of these and have just had it at one year. The hops floral flavors have definitely faded but the bitterness is still there. The malt has become creamier and I think I prefer it with a year on it. Otherwise just about all of my notes from last year's fresh bottle still apply.

Mainly because of the dominant maltiness that takes the edge off the abundant hops. Shared this bottle with my neighbor, poured into imperial pint glass. A - Murkey ruby red with a frothy beige head. S - Sweet malt with a hint of brown sugar? T - Sweet malt again. This year's edition doesn't seem as hoppy to me as in the past. Warm alcohol on the end with slight hop. M - Cloyingly sweet, easy to drink. I guess you would't want to drink too many in a night, because I'm only half way though this bottle and have a buzz! D - Actually, pleasant and easy to drink. Very seductive to the palate. At 10 ABV, just not too many! This wonderful brew is #2 on my favorite list! I have a feeling that my case won't last too long! Go get as much as you can!

The malty sweetness cuts the hop oils, and both linger on the palette, warming the body and bringing a smile to the soul.

Large sized bubbles strangely clinging to most of the inside surface area of the glass - then steadily releasing to move upward - reminds me of what soda looks like. After this little phenomenon is complete, the head reduces to a steady 1/4"". Some lacing, but it's thick and chunky.  The scents are very meaty and malty; caramel, juicy figs all mixed with an arousing bright scent of hops and a bit of alcohol. Fresh macerated dark fruits, almost like compote. Toasty dark malts that dance throughout this fruity mosh pit.  My tongue was hit with warm flavors of the aforementioned flavors - reminiscent of a heavy down pillow with a ton of momentum behind it being catapulted to my face. It kinda jumbles your noggin' but doesn't really hurt. A little sweet and syrupy malt presence with a regime of hops blowing up everything in its path. This son of a gun doesn't take any prisoners when it comes to showing up to the party. There's some spiciness in the background with a nice dryness and alcohol warmth lining the inside of my cheeks.  Mouthfeel is quite perfect. Creamy, perfect amount of fine and soft carbonation, prevent this monster from lying dormant. Long flavorful, spicy warm finish. Full body beauty at it's best.  Drinkability is quite dangerous. I'm halfway through this bomber and my mind's not drifting to another offering - it's got my full attention.  This is the very first time I've tried this ale and it definitely lives up to its infamous lore. Man, this baby's got some moxy and gumption - this is no lie. Very full tilt and in a strange way, very balanced and somewhat graceful.

I'm a fan of Stone's beers, since they are usually on the well-hopped side. Double Bastard Ale certainly fits the bill on hops, and malt as well.  I poured most of my bomber into a large 22 oz glass; surprised that it wasn't as ""heady"" as I remembered from last year. The beer left no lace at all, and actually looked ""flat"" about half-way through. I'm attributing this to the high ABV-- the beer wasn't flat at all, just appeared that way.

M&D: Thick, rich and viscous, but still very drinkable. Nice.  Recommended. Obviously, not everyone can try this one aged for 5 years.

It has a thin tan head that quickly disappeared with little to no lacing to speak of on the glass. The smell is dominated by sweet malt and dark fruits coming through. The scent of alcohol and pineapple is present as well about mid-chalice. Sugary malt, pine, dark fruit, and a touch of citrus run across my palate. There is a great deal going on with this beer. Rich malted tones and a smoky caramel are the most dominant flavors to me in this beer. I served this beer at cellar temp and still somehow this beer tends to gain more life the warmer it gets. The sweetness of the malt and bitterness of the hops is very well balanced and well made. The taste is in your face the whole time and in no way subtle, but the balance is really a nice surprise. This beer is a very nice sipper and coats the mouth and tongue very well with it's stickiness. After finishing the bomber I don't really want another one right now and I wouldn't drink this beer with a meal most likely. It is very heavy and quite filling.

Moderate pour produces an aggressive 3 finger light beige colored head. Head slowly fades to 1 finger with a smooth and creamy look (in a standard glass) and has great retention. Plenty of lacing is left behind.  S- Nose is promising with aggressive citrus and piny hop aromas fighting for dominance with a harsh spiciness. A big presence of alcohol looms in the background. No malt detected in the nose.  T-Initial taste is almost sweet. Caramel and chocolate malts are present with an accent of citrus hop flavor. A big spiciness bursts forth for the finish and the flavors present for the initial flavor vanish and are replaced with a big hop bitterness and a large kick of alcohol. A slight alcohol warmth lingers with nothing to accompany it with the exception of an aggressive (of medium strength...nothing too powerful or overwhelming) hop bitterness that lingers on and on and never goes away. The taste is wonderful at the beginning but ends slightly below average. Overall an average taste.  M- Medium to high stinging carbonation that temporarily vanishes but reappears for the swallow (very interesting). Body is thick and sticky-loaded with hops, caramel malt, and alcohol...but still has a pleasurable smoothness.  D- Drinkability gets an ""above average"" score from me. The taste is average but this brew screams ""American Strong Ale"" in almost every category. Its slightly more enjoyable than regular AB but is nowhere near oaked AB (which seems to take everything arrogant about the AB lineup and make it more smooth and mature).

The aroma is sweet fruits and strong alcohol. The taste is heavy, sweet malts and medium to high hop flavors, topped off by a pretty strong alcohol flavor.

I even waited a while for it to warm but really the only thing that seemed to get stronger was the alcohol taste.  Good mouthfeel. Very smooth with a medium to slightly thick body.

147,1056,atrus138,4.57,"Poured this from a bomber into a pint glass. Beautiful ruby red color, though appeared amber at the top. No head or lacing that I could notice. Smell was nice, but not nearly as potent as it tasted. Lots of citrus and piney notes. Very sweet. The taste was an explosion of flavors, all of them wonderful. Citrus, caramel, burnt sugar, with lots of hops. Both bitter and sweet at the same time. Absolutely amazing and even better when it warmed up a bit (which was easy to do because of the sheer volume and heavyness of the thing). A very heavy drink in alcohol content, mouthfeel, and flavor. I don't recommend having this with Thanksgiving dinner or any other heavy meal because it is so filling. However, on its own, it is an amazing drink that I will look forward to each year. Well worth the price.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,bunnyhustle,4.57,"This is an amazing beer. From the 2007 batch and poured into chalice glass. One thing that suprised me (maybe it was the pour) was there was little to no head but a beautiful mahogeny brown and violet color. A thin, off-white layer that lasted shortly and no lacing. Could have been my fault. Smell is very citric, the one that stood out to me was pineapple like. A hint of caramel a small touch of alcohol as well. Taste is incredible, wonderfully complex. Touches of hops, malt, toasted grain, alcohol, and chocolate. A warm feeling is left behind and the first sip will warm your chest in an instance. Low carbonation and a slightly thick mouthfeel and a somewhat oily feeling in the mouth is left behind. Overall this is a great beer and worthy of all of its praises. Only a 4 on drinkability as I want to have another, but a bomber of this is enough.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,calebmills,4.73,to start this off well its the best beer ive ever had!!!! when you pour it into a glass its a dark and deep shade of red and has a thick tan head almost like a stout. the smell isnt very overwhelming more misleading than anything because its not near as strong as the taste. the taste is very sweet and hoppy you have some fruit mixed in there and again pretty damn hoppy. the alcohol is mixed very well with the taste it doesnt overwhelm but warms when you take a drink. its a very complex and full but its very drinkable i was actually suprised when i finished it because i was ready for another. shame it costs like 80 dollars a case... i recomend the hell out of this beer but like the bottle warns you must be worthy of it or it will kick your ass haha!,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,sinistermadman,4.37,"07 release. Pours a hazy orange-brown color with a slight head. Aroma is of caramel, citrus and fresh bread. Great multitude of flavors here. Toasty malt notes with a caramel, smoky chocolate huskiness that coats the palate. Hops are evident, but are muted in the presence of all the alcohol and malt. Full mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Ends in a viscous, yet biscuity feel that lingers. Alcohol is well integrated into flavor, although you can almost feel it hit your blood once in the ol' gutty works. A double dose of bastard does you good. I approve.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,rxdrewthejew,4.53,"Brand new 2007 bottle.  A: Pours a dark reddish brown, almost maroon, and maybe a little darker than the regular Arrogant Bastard. Thick tannish one finger head.  S: Tons of fruity esters, mostly tropical, and some hops come out as well.  T: Sweet tropical and rich roast malt flavor, fruity and lots of bitterness. The hop flavor itself is citrus, but the bitterness comes out more than the flavor. The balance is just incredible.  MF: So smooth it's almost sickening. Very dry finish that leaves you wanting more. Strong warming, but the alcohol is actually pretty well masked.  D: Just a superbly crafted beer. In some ways, the flavor is a bit more mellow and refined than the Arrogant Bastard, but I think that's just a tribute to the balance this beer has. If not for the alcohol, I could drink this beer all night. Talk about a perfect winter beer though, just grab a glass of this an get a nice fire going in the fireplace, and you'll stay plenty warm.

Pours a Dark, dark reddish amber color with a beautiful light brown and foamy head that spills out of the glass and over the side as it builds and builds. A great lacing just splatters the side of the glass. Smell is of hops and some more hops! Grapefruit, and citrus and some earthy hops too. Malty flavor makes for an initial sweetness, followed by an intense bitterness. Crisp carbonation on this beer as well.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Head retention is good as is the lacing.  S: Sweet malts of brown sugar and butterscotch with a husky touch. Some citrus comes out from the hops. Pineapple? Some phenols are present but just a tad until it warms further.  T/M: Very strong on both the hop and malt front, each keeping one another in check. Hops are citrus-y, grassy, and quite refreshing. Malts step up and smooth everything over with a sweet biscuit arrival. Hops come back at the end leaving a lasting bitterness in the dry and warming finish. Alcohol is a touch strong at first but quickly fades.  D: Very tasty and the perfect thing for this time of year.

147,1056,bradford,4.13,"Had on tap at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach on 11/16/07 After working a 24 hour shift, I needed a little pick me up with a delicious pulled pork sandwich and Double Bastard at Beachwood Poured into a 16 oz pint glass for $6.00 Looked good, very dark ruby red with a minimal head that left early in the drinking experience Smelled a bit strange to me. Perhaps it was served a bit too cold, but I could pick up very little in the nose besides over-powering hops and some sort of funky malt Taste was great as ever. Very spicy hop bite, followed by a thick malt and then flowery, grassy hops. Mouthfeel was very good too. Thick, coating and delightful. This seems in the mouthfeel to be a bit more barleywine-ish, but the beautiful use of hops quickly kick some sense nto me that this beer is held above all standards and in a class of it's own as an American Strong Ale. Drinkability was good, because I wanted another with lunch, but the pricetag and 10% alcohol persueded me to call it quits.

147,1056,Floydster,4.28,"8 ounce glass directly from the source at the Stone World Bistro for four dollars yesterday  Color was a tiny bit darker than its little brother, Arrogant Bastard but not too much, medium dark brown with a 1/2 inch off white head that left lots of lacing  Smell was strong with some toffee and caramel, could tell this one was very hoppy, but could also smell a fair amount of malt, some sweet and subtle aromas  Taste was nicely balanced with sweet sugary malts and lots of bitter hops that gave it a nice dry finish, a little piney at first but then molds into a complex strong bite, has a sweet vanilla taste that has hints of caramel providing the sweet side, while a couple different hops give it some good bitterness, this taste lingers for a long time and has a distinctly strong aftertaste, wish this was not just a fall/winter release  Good amount of carbonation and nice mouthfeel, body was extremely full  Could have drank another three or four of these size glasses but the ten percent alcohol would have its effect on me after a while, pretty light for how strong its taste is though  This was my first time drinking this, but I am going to go out on a limb and say it is probably the best directly from the brewery rather than out of a bottle from a store, glad to finally try this here, highly recommended like all other Stone beers",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,eatdrinknbmerry,3.85,"The first thing I thought about while sipping/smelling this...  I'm on an island in Hawaii in a Pineapple Paradise. Why?  There is a strong presence of pine, and maybe pineapple to it. Upon first touch, slight taste of raisins.  A: Handsome, mahogany color  S: Like Hawaii (not waikiki beach)  T: delicious. smooth, with a slight kick of bitterness which dissipates almost immediately.  M: smooth, not too rich or full as you would think a double would promise.  D: i'm not a sweet beer person, but the pineapples would eventually knock me out after 3 beers.  Highly recommended.

147,1056,Kadonny,3.83,"2007 verison poured from a bomber bottle into my Harpoon European glass.  A: A nice reddish amber color with a nice off white/reddish head. Not a lot of carbonation or lacing.  S: Hops and malt, but more hops. Funny though, you can tell right away this is not an IPA or DIPA just from the nose. The hops are much more muted and not much of the heavy citrus or floral smell is present. A very soothing smell but not much sweetness that I can pick up.  T: Wow, first sip gives me hops bitterness and alcohol with lots of pine mixed in. Mid taste has malt soothing in, with the subtle hops with some citrus and the bitterness finishing out. Malt ends on the aftertaste. You can tell this is a young brew, it's very...ummm, edgy bitey with not much mellowness but very good, almost overwhemling.  M: Heavy, heavy mouthfeel with lots of alcohol present. No doubt when young you taste the alcohol. This is a big beer.  D: Actually, in limited quantities the drinkability is high, in more quantities the drinkability lessens. This is a big, big beer, make no mistake about it, the biggest I have tried lately for sure.  Overall a very good beer, but to me it just has this rough edge that needs to be smoothed over time to increase drinkability. If you want a huge beer that will tantalize your tast buds, this one is for you, but don't plan on quaffing any because this beer is for sipping. I bought a case so I'll revisit the review as I let these guys age a bit. Upon aging the hops will probably die, but the drinkability and mellowness will increase.

Smell: Pine-like hops, with an acidic sweetness, like pineapple. A bit of alcohol present in the nose too.  Taste: The piney hops kick in at the start, set off against a malt backdrop. Towards the finish the pineapple (and a bit of citrus flavors) come into play. Alcohol is noticable for a good deal of the time.  Mouthfeel: Super-smooth feel especially at the start. Light carbonation, with slight alcohol burning towards the end.  Drinkability: This is for drinking very slow! The alcohol taste is quite noticable.  I was afraid this beer might be too over-the-top hop-wise, but it isn't. Instead, though, it is a bit over-the-top in alcohol content. I prefer a strong beer that masks the alcohol better. I do still think it's a good beer, but I probably won't get it again for a while.

147,1056,Halcyondays,4.02,"22 oz. bomber, 2007 Vintage,  A: Pours a dark brown/red into a snifter, fair head which left some lacing, but not the most impressive beer I've ever seen.  S: Big mix of hops and malts, raisins, pine, dark fruit, quite boozy as well, a bit abrasive, but complex.  T: The taste is very big and powerful. Huge pine bitterness races across the palate with some pineapple and citrus as well, while the malt and dark fruit add some balance, but still the flavours are a little out of control. Booze also comes across, a bit fusely, but mostly just a smooth solvent character. A little bit of dark/bittersweet chocolate comes out as reaches room temperature.  M: Robust, full of resin and oil, full-bodied, this is a beer that stays with you long after you drink it, it definitely makes an impression.  D: Definitely a sipper, this is one big, powerful, and complex beer. Very tasty, but at times the harshness and brashness got to me and I found it difficult to drink, and I love this extreme stuff. This is a very good, interesting beer, but I have to be in a particular mood to fully enjoy it.

The sweetness is totally balanced by the bitterness and crispness of the hops. Very long finish. Alcohol is totally masked. Excellent balance to this beer.  Incredibly rich and creamy mouthfeel.

147,1056,snpub540,4.3,"2007 Vintage. As I was pouring it into my snifter, it appeared to be a golden color, but as it collected in the glass it took on a nice mahogany hue. There was a tan one finger tall head that quickly turned into a small ring. No lacing but I wasn't expecting much from a high ABV brew anyway.  The smell was fantastic. My nose picked up whisps of pine from the hops and some dark fruits like raisins and cherries. Also a hint of sweetness from the alcohol.  Taste was a sweet mix of caramel and raisins. The hop flavors were pine and grapefruit. There was a dry aftertaste and a slight amount of warming alcohol in the finish.  The complexity of the beer made it surprisingly easy to drink. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and quite nice. Alcohol wasn't overpowering at all.

147,1056,ccrida,3.08,"2007 Release, poured from a bomber into my large St. Feuillien goblet, Double Bastard is clear dark ruby with a small but thick, olive tinged off-white head.  Smell is mainly a big punch of citrus hops, pineapple and grapefruit, although a rich sweet malt background lets you know that you're not dealing with another big IPA. Since I've been drinking winter warmers lately, it reminds me of a super hoppy one of those, with noticeably more alcohol. I'd rather more balance from the malt, the hops make it rather one dimensional.  Taste is also super hoppy, with a hugely bitter, dry, clean booze finish. There is some sweet, gingerbread like malt lying behind all the hops and fusels, but it's probably too fresh for my taste right now. The aftertaste just won't stop, super astringent and boozy.  Mouthfeel is thick and oily, not much carbonation.  Drinkability is on the lower side. This one pretty much burns with every swallow. Sure it softens some as it warms, but it also gains viscosity. Frankly, I'd normally lower pretty much every category, except for the fact that it's so fresh, and I assume it's better with age. There's also maybe some high score bias, as much as I try to avoid that, I can't ignore the hype behind this one, which I'm not really liking. I love robust american barelywines, but this one's just harsh, and I'm a fan of extreme beer.

Average sized head, and has a wonderful reddish brown color to it. It has a noticeable barleywine-like smell to it, with a maltiness that tingles the nose. The first sip was amazing, it was a lot smoother than I expected. I would compare this to a fine Old Ale. As it warmed up, it became even easier to drink, which was when I started to really notice the high alcohol content. This is a great beer to just sit back with, sip slowly, and enjoy.

147,1056,sessycuban,4.74,"2005 vintage. Got a growler fill from the brewery some months ago. These are notes I took from the tasting.  Growler. Poured into Stone Double Bastard Ale glass.  A - The beer pours a rich, amber color. The beer is somewhat murky, but this is to be expected given the age. The tan head didn't retain to well, but again, well for a beer that has been aged and poured from a growler.  S - The smell is very complex. I get a slight toastiness, citrus, tropical fruit, and a slight tinge of hops. This has held up well for such a hoppy beer.  T - I'm getting grapefruit very early on followed by pine notes. The beer finishes with a hop backbone, which is a bit surprising. Given the color, I'd expect a maltier backbone. The balance is spectacular.  M: The taste is a bit chewy, but not too thick. I'd still say this is medium bodied. It has a very nice feel to it for such an aggressive beer.  D: The beer does have some heat to it. But as they say, if you can't handle the heat, stay out of the fire. With that said, supremely drinkable for a 10% abv beer that goes to great lengths to warn you how aggressive the beer is.  Highly recommended to all!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,MiguelMandingo,4.85,"Goddamn. This beer is ridiculous. If you have to cross 5 state lines to find this stuff, you should. I really don't know what else to say. The last beer that made me utter that from my lips was Rochefort 10. It is easily my favorite offering from Stone up to this point. I picked up two bottles of this in Virginia, from Once Upon a Vine, and I should have bought the place out. I can't buy this brew in Texas, and it is a damn shame. I hate you TABC - why won't you allow more Stone beers than just the AB and the IPA? WHY?!?  Poured part of a 2006 22oz. bomber into a Double Bastard glass.  Appearance - Poured out of the bottle a thick translucent ruby brown. It produced a one finger off white/tan head that slowly dissipated. When the brew warmed to room temperature, it became perfectly transparent. Looks absolutely delicious.  Smell - Sweet. Toffee, caramel malt, vanilla, and burnt sugar. Dark fruits like plum, prunes and figs. A shit ton of oily, resinous hops - very citrus grapefruit in nature. Oh yeah, and booze. Heavenly.  Taste - Oh my god. Beer doesn't taste much better than this. The scent doesn't do enough justice to entice you into the perfection of its flavor. Sweet caramel malt front, intermingled with toffee and burnt sugar and dark fruit. It evolves seductively into an insane, bitter hop ending. All of the flavors are intermixed with the boozy 10%ABV. Highly reminiscent of a barleywine. It is a perfect balance between malt and hops.  Mouthfeel - Perfect. Perfect carbonation, dry bitter hop finish, and goes down smooth. Medium to full bodied.  Drinkability - Perfect for a beer this strong. This beer is an extremely easy drinker, but I drank it extremely slow to savor every single sip. Wussies might not want to session this because of the ABV, but they are wussies. If I had easy access to this beer, I would drink it all the time.  This is far and away better than the original Arrogant Bastard. Find this beer now. You shouldn't be wasting your time reading this.

A: The beer is a light reddish brown color with a thin off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is pretty complex with caramelized malt, brown sugar, dark fruit and a lot of hops.  T: The taste is about as well-balanced as any beer that I’ve ever had. There’s a strong hops bitterness and a hearty malt character, with flavors of caramel, brown sugar and dark fruits. For a beer with 10.00% ABV, the alcohol burn is very mild. The after-taste is hoppy and slightly sweet. To me it seems to taste very similar to Old Guardian, but something that I can’t put my finger on just makes it taste even better than both OG and the regular Arrogant Bastard.  M: Very smooth and very crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is very clean.  D: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not very filling, this is flat out just a damn good beer. I simply can’t say enough good things about Stone, because they continue to impress me.

147,1056,jaxon53,4.4,"Much thanks to jasnm for sending me this bottle in the JBIF. 2006 vintage. Served at just about cellar temperature, into a snifter, from a twenty two ounce bottle. Poured out a somewhat thick amber brown color that was quite hazy. A pretty vigorous pour yielded about two fingers of thick, frothy, off-white head that had decent retention. A little bit of sticky lace was left behind in the glass. The nose was loaded with strong aromas. Tons of alcohol up front, followed by the hops, sweet malt, rum soaked raisins and cherries, and just a bit of plum. The nose is definitely dominated by alcohol and dark fruits. The flavor is quite extreme as well. Dark fruits, caramel, hops, and maybe a touch of chocolate in there. A nice malt presence as well. Finishes a bit dry, with a smooth ten percent alcohol burn with little carbonation. The alcohol really stands out in this one. Seems pretty well balanced for the beast that it is. Has a full bodied, thick, syrupy mouthfeel that goes down like a good throat coating cough medicine. It's definitely a sipper but a damn good one.

A - Color is mahogany brown or deep ruby red depending on the light. A rich, light brown head can be achieved only through agitation, otherwise the head is a thin brown film. Minimal lacing.  S - Where to begin?? Bready malts, oily and piny hops, dark plummy raisiny black fruitiness, maybe some candi sugar, creamy flavors, vanilla and finally a hot alcohol sensation felt in the sinuses (lessens as the beer warms).  T/M - The taste starts out with a silky textured malty flavor, accompanied by sweet and rich dark fruits and a nice smoky oakiness. A dull carbonation bite comes in but the taste doesn't really alter much, which isn't a bad thing.  D - Very rich and luxurious and I'd love to try it again.

Not sure why I have never reviewed this beer before for some odd reason, yet there is a first for everything. So here goes:  Pours a deep russet nearly opaque in stature. Lightens at the tips to a deep scarlet/orange. Head is full, bordering on tan and creamy as hell. Retention considering age and ABV is stunning. After five minutes the head is still at full formation.  Brown sugar, toffee, and maple aromas lead way into a floral, piney hop aromatic. A bit of earth and fresh fig, with a nutty sweet aroma. Some bitter cocoa as well with what may be mollasses.  Amazing what aging does to this beer. Things are brought together as one and meld like no other. The hops have succumbed enough to let the malt breath life into this beer. The mouth is big, chewy, wet, and puckering. Finish is long, very long and hides nothing.  There are some hints of alcohol but nothing discouraging. An abundance of brown sugar coated toffee malt, with caramel and maple blend seamlessly with a floral, piney hop that shows a bit of citrus on the finish.

It poured a hazy dark ruby orange with very little to no head. The smell was full of oily pine and citrus. Huge malts with phenols and sweet candied fruit. Taste was an ass kicking mouthful of sweet malt, creamy caramel and a finish full of pine and grapefruit. Mouthfeel was rich and creamy, sweet and almost cloying. Just the right amount of carbonation make this reasonably drinkable for the ABV. It definitely rears it strong head as it warms but the experience is so full and rich you could care less.

Anyways I found this little jem hiding behind a few Stone IPAs and i figured id give it a shot. Wow was i right for picking this one! Very hoppy brew with scents and tastes of citrus, very warming. My nostrils were on fire with scents and the alcohol smell was more than apparent. Poured with nice head only on a hard pour, but color was a deep amber almost blood red. Very complex mix of flavors that would have an unexperienced beer drinker running back to their watered down beer in no time.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,errantnight,4.46,"2006 edition.  Let me note that I wasn't as wowed by the 2007 this year as I was when I had the 2006 fresh last year... the 2004 I had last year was a little strong in alcohol... and the 2005 I had last year reminded me of this... simply superb.  Pours rich, viscous and deep brass/copper with minimal but persistent head with some of the Best Lacing Ever. My glass was coated from the top down. Outstanding. Practically glowing in the glass, this is what strong ales of this type should look like. Or, y'know, not. But this one looks good looking like this, k?  The aroma is delicious, if slightly underwhelming... it's definitely more intense fresh, with notes of spicy hop... here? A rich broth of malty deliciousness with some floral, citric notes from the hops... like a Double IPA that's lost a bit of its touch and is heavier on the malt... it's inviting, but a bit incongruous with what's to come.  Full flavored assault of biscuity malt with a clean, molasses/honey sweetness with a sharp, bitter edge to cleanse the palate. A bit of grapefruit. Not incredibly complex, but the balance is perfect. But this isn't really a ""where's the alcohol?"" well balanced... more of a... the alcohol is there, but subdued, and adds to the experience. Points lost only as this approaches room temperature the alcohol starts to rear its head, and if you let this really warm up it will turn sharply, disappointingly, noxious. You don't want this too cold, but it does have a sweet spot somewhere in the 50s.  Body is rich and full with enough carbonation to keep things moving on the tongue. Not overly filling.. again, drinkability only knocked down because a little attention needs to be paid to the serving... and pouring from a 22oz bomber conceivably into lowball glasses or snifters... well, anyone have another bottle?",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,kajerm,3.78,"Bomber at Monk's. Pours reddish-amber with a thick white head and decent lacing. The aroma is much maltier than I expected-- lots of caramel and toffee here. Aroma-hopping is a little lighter than I thought it would be, but Amarillo is clearly a presence here, with clear notes of pineapple and mango.  The flavor profile is fairly similar to Nugget Nectar, or even a fresh 90-minute, with an excellent balance between malts and hops. If anything, the maltiness might be a little overdone. Opens up with caramel and toffee, finishes with neat, lip-smacking bitterness. Tropical and citric hop flavors show up mid-palate, but the strong malt backbone blunts them a little too strongly for my taste. Impressively, alcohol is totally imperceptible here.  Mouthfeel is heavy and chewy, especially for a hoppy beer, but it seems to fit. As for drinkability, it's a little too thick and malty to be refreshing, but it's pretty damned good for the ABV.

T: Awesome grapefruit punch up front followed by a floral/pine like middle and finishes toasty with a nice smooth malt backbone. Supremely balanced and a pleasure to taste.  M: Syrupy, chewy, very thick, almost oil like. Almost perfect given the taste - some nice carbonation as well.  D: Dangerous at over 10%. A very excellent beer.

Nose is incredible with aromas of tropical fruit and pineapple, rich caramel, roasted malt, piney hops, and spicy alcohol. Taste begins quite sweet with notes of brown sugar and rich caramel followed by some buttery toffee. Grapefruit rind and piney hops come out in a big way towards the finish along with some unsweetened chocolate. Full-bodied and oh so creamy smooth.

147,1056,Romulus141,4.45,"Left-over bottles from Christmas. Poured into a regular glass, and served at room temperature.  Appearance: Pours a deep red-orange with a creamy almond colored head. Held up to the light, the beer shines a brilliant red, and is somewhat translucent. The head dissipates a little, leaving behind strong lacing which does not go away. The color and appearance makes a strong impression, showing the drinker that this is not an average beer.  Smell: The smell is strong. There is a mixture of malts, alcohol, and a very faint hint of citrus. I would say that the alcohol aroma dominates. Since the ABV is high, this does not surprise me. There is also a smoky scent that is detected upon a subsequent sniff, followed by of all things a pineapple. As I would find out with the taste, the smell gets better after getting through what I call the ""strong alcohol layer.""  Taste: As the smell hints, the taste is strong, and the alcohol is detectable. This beer is far more aggressive than a regular arrogant bastard. I detect malty sweetness, which is creamy. There are some hints of fruit as well. The bitter character dominates initially. The beer gets smoother as I get farther down the glass, and as the temperature gets warmer. It's strange. This beer started really heavy when it came to the alcohol taste, but halfway through, it mellowed out a lot and was replaced with a quality flavor. Now that 'm down to the last third, it's smooth as smooth can be. I'm not quite sure how I feel about that. I like that it affords a complexity, but that initial taste was off-putting, and nearly caused me to give this beer a mediocre taste rating.  Mouthfeel: Thick, but smooth. The mouthfeel itself is quite nice, and what I've come to expect from Stone Brewery. My tongue is caressed, and it flows over my palette. Quite enjoyable.  Drinkability: Once you get past the strong alcohol layer (first third of glass or so), these are deceptive when it comes to their potency. They are quite drinkable, despite their strong flavor and full body. I do recommend drinking them in warmer temperatures, as them being cold only obscures the complexity and enhances the alcohol.  Overall, I think I enjoy a standard arrogant bastard a little more, simply because I never had that strong alcohol layer to deal with. If Stone could find a way to get rid of that effect (it was present in just about every bottle within my case), then this would trump the standard bastard. I bet these are great when coming out of a draft handle. Recommended, although I'd have a regular arrogant bastard first for comparison.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,BlackJeremiah,4.71,"2006 edition, two months cellared, from notes. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a Double Bastard DOF glass.  A: Rich reddish bronze, but almost no head, even with a rough pour. The lack of head is disappointing, like a hatless cowboy.  S: Malts smell almost like whiskey, bready sour mash goodness, with lots of hoppy, piney, big oily scents floating atop it. Like someone selling Christmas trees in the middle of the Jack Daniels factory.  T: Hops and alcohol cut your mouth like a delicious knife, while creamy, chewy, sweet malts apply salve almost immediately. Good, but too damn fresh--after observing how well the 2005 did with a little age, I think this one will be even better in a year. However, no chance that my stash will make it that long. (Note: it didn't even make it past February).  M: Oily, burning, like thick firewater. Perfect for this beer; the arrogance of whiskey and the flammability of brandy.  D: Six bottles.

147,1056,DaPeculierDane,4.47,"Finally, Ive found a bottle of this much sought after strong, hoppy monster. 22 oz, 06, bomber purchased from Chucks Fine Wines in Chagrin Falls, OH. Bought and consumed on 06-12-07.  Appearance: Crimson lava body. Tan head.  Aroma: All the good stuff. Plantation pine and apricot plantation. Cedar chips smoldering under a grill covered in hardened caramel that slowly melts and drips onto those hot cedar chips creating a flare up of smoky-sweet caramel aroma. Yum. One knows that this packs a lot of hops and at least a little strength.  Taste: There is a heck of a lot going on here. Im first hit by juicy citrus and tropical fruit, especially mango and then grapefruit. Next I notice pine. Then the caramel brings everything together but it quickly melts under the pressure of some hearty booze esters that resemble brown sugar. That make way for toffee which turns to smoke, then tree bark, which finally brings me back to even more pine. As it warms it becomes hoppy port for a few seconds and then hoppy fuel. Finally were left with flavorful booze that is sweet and bitter at the same time and extremely warming.  Mouthfeel: Heavy and full but not filling or burdensome. There is an airy quality, perhaps from a relatively strong carbonation that helps to balance all of this out. The hop presence certainly does well to match the sugariness from the booze and the bountiful caramel sweetness. All in all this is really well balanced, complex, and delicious.  Drinkability: Very good. I relished this bomber and wanted another right away. At 10% or so, this could become a real dangerous brew if I had a lot of it.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

It was just too complex and before I knew it I was too buzzed to care anyway. Let's now give it a shot, shall we?  Vintage: 2006 release. Package: 22 oz bottle. Vessel: Cognac glass.  Pours a deep sunset red. Like a Serengeti sunset. Or a volcanic sunset. I'm holding the glass right up to a lamp so that it glows that brilliant hue. It's very primal. The head looks thick, creamy and still. It's going nowhere fast.  The aroma is the hardest part for me. I sniff and I sniff and I sniff to make sure I'm getting everything. Alcohol, definitely. Fruit, yes.... Pineapple? Are you serious? That's the last thing I thought I'd smell from this ale. I'm pretty sure it's there. Black cherries. Faint apple. Or apple brandy, rather. (Good choice of vessel, huh?) Piney hops. And a multitude of malts. Good enough for me, time to drink.  This is one smooth Bastard. Thick, sweet, rich. Like flavored pancake syrup, only fermented. And I mean that in the most respectful way possible. Oily at the end. And warming, very warming. Almost a burn, in fact. This part is almost identical to that of the standard Arrogant Bastard. Oh yeah, that's the stuff.  This is a very luxurious beer. It's what a single malt scotch guy would drink if he was the designated driver that night. Indeed, this is the true high life.

An incredibly smooth, complex, rich and tasty brew. The flavors are all over the place on this thing but I'll do the best I can to describe. It starts out with the hops. Pine and some fruits such as grapefruit and pineapple. With an incredibly smooth transition the fruits slides into sweet caramel and burnt sugar. The finish goes right back to the hops with a bitter finish and aftertaste. An incredible blend and medley of flavors. The 10% is a bit warming at the end.

It's the kind of smell that clues you in on what you're about to drink; a huge, complex beer.  And that's what the Double Bastard is. It's an unrelenting assault on the tastebuds. At first it is strikingly sweet, with big waves of caramel, dark fruits, and raisins. As the beer warms the complexities really come out, exhibiting a sturdy grass hop profile, a smokey wood flavor, and a subtle alcohol tinge to the finish. And while the sweetness prevails over all of it, the subtleties never get lost or overpowered.  The mouthfeel is medium, rich, and super smooth. Very little alcohol in the finish.

As it warms fruit and spice qualities come to the foreground.  Very strong in this department; creamy and lush. Bitterness really tingles the tongue on the finish.  I really do like this beer, but it's not something I could drink much of. Bitterness begins to border on annoying by the end of the bomber.

147,1056,becktone,5,"Well I chose a hell of a day to do a vertical tasting of 2 year old (2004) Double Bastard with a fresh 2006 one. Been meaning to do this for a while but...well, today is a good day. Finals are over, and it is impressively cool for the month of June here in Cincinnati. Should be much easier to drink with this cool weather today. I don't think that it'd go down too well were it scorching hot.  2006 Eye:Clear copper in color with nice foamy creamy head. Lacing is excellent, and retention is also excellent. 2004 Eye: Color is almost identical with this one having a bit more of a reddish orange hue added to the copper color. It is also cloudy, not close to being clear. Lacing is nice, but head retention isn't all that great, could be the glass though-its been through the dishwasher a few times, what can you do? I usually only review through my specific glass.  2006Nose: Strong malt aroma, evident alcohol with a bit of warming alcohol there as well. As it warms a bit some light hop aromas are starting to come through. 2004Nose: Much the same as the 2007, however more sherry like, alcohol is much more evident, much more potent and stronger than the 2007. Strongly malt focused aroma, some chocolate aromas seem to be there. Reminds me much of SN Bigfoot after a year of cellaring.  2006 Tongue: Hot Damn! I'll admit this is the first time I've had Double Bastard, and after the first sip I'm already in love. What a wash of hops! It was a huge surprise. Didn't expect to be hit in the face with hop flavor and bitterness when it is not evident in the aroma. Floral hops dominate the flavor leaving little room for malt flavor. Alcohol is also there. 2004 Tongue: Much more relaxed. Malt oriented. Aging has taken the hop kick out of this brew. Definite roasted and burnt grain flavors. Not nearly as bitter as the 06. Alcohol is also more upfront, not nearly as neatly hidden, the overwhelming hops of fresh Double Bastard hid the alcohol pretty well, but here it is way out in the open. Sherry like in flavor from oxidation, again reminds me how Bigfoot aged over a year. I have to say that I prefer it fresh, I am however, a hop head. There is still a little hop bitterness right there at the end that is detectable but it quickly fades.  2006 Mouthfeel and Drinkability:Definitely one to sip. Try to guzzle this and I think you might find yourself gagging. Hops are so strong that at first I almost gagged because I wasn't expecting it to be so bitter-dumb me! I forgot all about Arrogant Bastard and Stone....no hops what the hell was I thinking? Didn't get it in the aroma so hey...-Heavy body-thick in the mouth like watery syrup-with light fine carbonation, however it is less than the carbonation of the 2004 vintage. This is a brew that I could sit and drink for a few hours, however, after one or two bombers I think that things might just get out of hand. This is the best beer from Stone that I've ever had, I will always buy this brew, it is that good. The Bastard has set me Free. 2004 Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Pretty heavy in body and with light fine carbonation, warms as it goes down. Thank God its not steaming hot otherwise I don't think I'd be able to drink the 3 Liter bottle Ive got. In my opinion I prefer it fresh, but perhaps one year would be nice when there is more of a balance between hops, malts, and alcohol. Still good though, I mean you can't buy it so.... Really three years of aging has changed this into a completely different beer. In a blind test you might be able to tell that it has been aged, but the same beer, I'm not quite sure.  God, going between these two is hell, as soon as I get used to one I reach for the other and find something completely different. I recommend Double Bastard uncellared and fresh....I will be drunk soon, just finishing this bomber and then the first glass of the cellared might just do it, 10%abv, damn who wouldn't be after a few glasses of this?",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Alot going on here, so much that it meshes together and makes it hard to figure out. Either that or my pallate sucks- probably the latter.

Good lacing is quickly evident.  Powerful aroma of candy and sweet fruits - oranges, apricots - is appreciable at arms lenght.  Rich malt slathers across the tongue, with a semi-sweet dark chocolate depth. Then it cranks the sweetness up another notch for a burst that then contracts before it becomes cloying. Suddenly a sharply bitter burst of hops batters the sweetness down into a momentary pin attempt (any use of the word ""balance"" here would be absurd). Sweet and bitter roll down the tongue battling like Popeye and Bluto, with sweet managing to finally emerge the winner of a quick count in the end. Even as sweet stands arms up though, the hops form a lumberjack circle around the ring, and this match will continue mouthful after mouthful.

The body is pretty much just shades of brown. Lighter around the edges, darker in the center, it's very cloudy. Definitely looks like a strong ale.  Complex scent: I get citrus, some grassy pine, no doubt from hops, and a general sweet scent, like a nice bourbon.  Now the taste is a whole other level of complexity. The very first sip has this bitterness right away, but I get used to that. As I drink I notice it's sweet, kinda like that bourbon I mentioned only without the heat or taste of alcohol. It balances well with a bitter hop background, but everything is taken up a notch or so. It's really something.  It's medium bodied, enough to invite you for more. The 10% ABV is very deceptively hidden. No doubt another bottle of this and I would be down for the count, but yet I it does make me crave another.

Very sweet with a lot of smooth dark malt flavors, but with a hoppy bite to posit a great counterpoint. Rich malt, carmelized sugars, and alcohol vie with earthy, fruity, and grassy hops for domination of the tastebuds.

147,1056,geexploitation,4.19,"2004 release, cellared until now. Pours very dark, just a couple shades shy of coffee, with a reddish tint and a very white head that leaves lots of lacing. Smells like an aged American barleywine. I haven't had this beer when it's young, but I'm sure that its hop character was more brash than this during its youthful days. Instead, that aromas end up being more on the malty end of the spectrum: quite sweet, with hints of graham cracker, treacle, and syrupy french toast with predominantly piney and slightly metallic hops laid over it all.  On the palate, crackery, almost Maris Otter sweetness first off, then things go two ways: simultaneously, there's growing caramel sweetness and increasing metallic hoppiness at the mid-palate. The sweetness dissipates only a little bit at the end; the sweetness sticks around for the most part, along with the hops, which attain some fruity height here. Throughout, the mouthfeel is quite oily with hops in spite of the malty goodness on display. Carbonation is slight. Overall, this is a definite step up from the Arrogant Bastard... although it could just be the aging, which emphasizes the malts a bit more at the expense of the hops.

Various citrus notes are present with grapefruit and tangerine in the forefront accompanied by other fruity notes namely cherries, apples, and pineapple. At first I'm hit with a veritable wave of malt sweetness. The finish brings a hoppy flavor. Overall the taste is dominated by an alcoholic astrigency that lingers and overshadows the other flavors.

147,1056,cooncat,4.58,"Serving from a 2006 vintage 22 oz. bomber - reviewed 4-14-07. Stone Brewery has gained my total respect over the past couple years, proving to me that something good CAN come out of California.  A mildly vigorous pour split into two pint glasses (my buddy had to sample as well) produced a deep mahogany to garnet color, with remarkable clarity and a nice sized creamy head, which produces sheets of lacing on the side of the glass all the way down.  The nose surprised me that it had floral and piney hops mixed in with the dark fruity rich maltiness. A note of fusel alcohol was present, and not unexpected in a 10% abv beer. Very complex and one could wax on for a long time describing every nuance.  The taste is very full bodied and has a great malty sweetness at the top; dark fruits, currants and a bready background. The sweetness is totally balanced by a suprising appearance of floral and piney hops, which get progressively more aggressive in trying to make their presense known by the bottom of the glass. I'm not sure I've ever had a beer that is so well balanced; definitely the ""best of both worlds"". The finish is satisfyingly dry, with the maltiness still present. This is one massive beer, complex and one to sit back and savor for an hour, as each small sip conjures up new nuances. The considerable ABV will make itself known, perhaps too much if you try to quaff an entire 22 oz. bomber. Share this excellent beer with a friend - great times and conversation are bound to follow.  Very highly recommended. An outstanding offering from Stone. Cheers!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,lifeboyq,3.3,"2005 release Double bastard - First let me say this beer is an entirely different beer aged. We all know hops seem to fade noticeably quarterly, but after a horrible first tasting in 2005, I persevered giving it more time. Without age, it's entirely too bitter as it's over hopped with high alpha hops without any balance making it very cloying. I don't understand hop heads and I never will, but perhaps over an aged argument, I'll listen but still disagree. This beer is insanely over hyped and overall an average beer at best without the patience of Job. After 2 years, its still slightly bitter, but a very balanced beer, somewhat similar to a slightly bitter but refined raison de extra. It's beginning to be good, beginning to be very good, but needs still more time to settle down. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice surprise but my guess is that after three years, this beer will finally be truly ready and a fantastic offering as beautiful pseudo amber, cooked sucrose treat. I taste 2 row malt for a base, munich malts, medium crystal, a little dark crystal, (I guess its possible that imp mistaking the crystal for some aromatic, biscuit or special B combo) maybe a little black patent malt or roasted barley, refined processed sugar and an American ale yeast.  Overall, this is a well brewed beer to withstand the test of time. Without time, it's a nice offering for the unrefined palette that falls prey to American micro beer marketing bias. The percentage of people that buy beer to age it is very low, thus how should I rate this beer?....",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Powerful, but not what I thought it would be, which is good, because any more powerful and I might have fallen out of my chair. A spicy, sweet malt explosion with very little alcohol presence. A great balance of bitterness and alcohol bite to create a smooth, interesting finish. I'm drinking it sort of cold, but not too cold, so I'm sure the alcohol will show more as it warms. The tart fruits stay around the whole time to aid in the great finish. M - Medium-bodied but strong. The fruits are awesome. They cling to the palate and make this a great brew. I'm not saying it's a fruity beer at all, but the dark fruits really smooth it out and add so much flavor along with the sweet malt. D - What can I say? Stone does it again.

147,1056,Damian,4.79,"Drank from a 1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Mall Discount Liquors, Cambridge, MA  Poured a clear, dark, crimson-mahogany with a one-finger, light tan, bubbly head that faded to a thin film. Lots of drippy lacing along the glass.  The aroma was outstanding. Sweet and super intense with robust malts, caramel, toffee and a rich, vanilla oakiness. Later, some ripe fruits, raisins and a brandy-like quality became evident.  The taste was as good (if not better) than the nose. Rich, flavorful, smooth and incredibly well balanced. Tons of sweet, caramel malts and spices up front with a pervasive oakiness. As the beer moved along the palate, the flavor profile changed considerably. Hoppy (citrusy, cascade hops) and alcohol rich on the back end with a hoppy, dry, slightly bitter, grapefruit-like finish. Moderate alcohol warming was noticeable in the nose and mouth on the exhale. As the beer warmed, the alcohol did become slightly more pronounced, taking on an almost vodka-like character.  Body was medium with a slick mouthfeel.  Drinkability of this beer was outstanding. With so many interesting flavors and complexities, the 10% ABV was only moderately noticeable. Furthermore, this beer was so well balanced. This was truly a joy to drink and would pair perfectly with a plate of stone fruits, dessert cheeses and nuts.  Note: As for a comparison with the Arrogant Bastard Ale, this offering is a whole different beast (pardon the pun). The Double Bastard has a substantially more intense and complex flavor profile.

First, the sweeness of the malt and instant bitterness of the hops (magnums?) hit your tongue. Soon after the hugely thick mouthfeel hits you... again this is a sipper. The malt has hints of honey, raisins, perhaps a faint sweet pineapple as well.  Lingering bitterness, similar to single Arrogant Bastard stays with you and yet still manages to go down smoothly.

147,1056,instrumentality,4,"This 10% ABV monster came from a 22 oz. bomber released in 2006. I'll preface this by saying that I wasn't a big fan of the *regular* AB's bitterness, and it wasn't until they released the Oaked AB that I really began to appreciate it. Frankly, I expect this beer to be too intense for me, but the bottle is opened, so I'm going to give it my best shot and try to be objective.  I poured this one into my trusty Stone Imperial Russian Stout tulip glass. The body was a clean amber with what started out as about 2 fingers of dense, off-white, creamy head. After a couple of minutes, the amber liquid became exposed in the center, while a thick halo encircled this and clung to the edge of the glass.  The odor was unexpectedly sweet, a mixture of brown sugar, tangerine, and, to a lesser extent, grapefruit. I have a feeling this beer is going to be a wolf in sheep's clothing, but up to this point, it's very inviting.  After the first sip, I'm still very impressed. The grapefruit really kicks in here, but I can still very much detect that sweeter, tangerine-like citrus presence as well as a bit of brown sugar. It's very bitter, but also very well-balanced. I'm pleasantly surprised so far.  Further sips suggest to me that either something's not quite right or there's just a vast difference between drinking a Double Bastard fresh and drinking one that's 4-6 months old. It's as sweet as it is bitter. There's no lingering caked-in pine or grapefruit aftertaste. Even the alcohol is subtle, especially for 10%.  I still have another bottle of this, and I was planning to let it age a bit, but it seems to be in its prime right now, if not a little beyond. I'm in utter shock. Maybe the oak aging of the AB just helped me acquire a taste for this style of brew. I guess I won't really know until I try a fresh batch of regular AB and compare it against a fresh batch of Double AB.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,EPseja,2.6,"On the evening of the last full moon of winter 2007 in Westwood, NJ, the Double Bastard finally finds its way to my lips...  Served from an exquisitely screen printed 22oz bomber at cellar temperature into a Duvel tulip -- my tasting glass of choice.  A - Gluggingly thick in the pour, and medium brown with ruby highlights in the look. Pushes up a beautiful, foamy, inch-thick head that makes a thick ring around the edge of the glass. Lacing is fairly good, and head retention is average.  S - Sweet, mild caramel, and orange-tangerine citrus all dropped into a pot with cold, evergreen broth. Tickling (taunting?) notes of alcohol. Molasses biscuits with pecans.  T - Tongue-stinging alcohol-laced carbonation hits the tongue on a wave of mild malt sweetness. Isopropyl vapor fills my mouth, putting me on the verge of gasping for air. West coast hops grab hold in the back, struggling to regain control of the situation -- and succeed only barely. Astringent in the throat and bitter without relenting. Over the top and with no subtelty.  M - The alcohol sting does not help the fact that the carbonation is a bit on the aggressive side. Slightly numbing, and puffy in texture. The swallow is foamy and filling.  D - Next to the regular Arrogant Bastard, this beer is complete shit. It took a wonderful, balanced recipe with big, delicious character and injected it with steroids and methamphetamines, turning it into an out of balance monstrosity with only fair redeeming value once your tongue gets numb and your head gets light. It's not entirely undrinkable -- I intend to finish the bottle over the course of a couple of hours, sipping it like I would a spirit -- but if you've got the money for just one Stone beer, this one is NOT it.  EDIT: To qualify this rating, many people would say that this ber needs to be aged before it gets really good and mellows out. Well, that may be true. But, in my opinion, if it's not ready, then don't release it until it is, or at least mention on the bottle that it *should* be aged rather then consumed immediately.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Dark ruby color toward the center and a light orangish shade around the outside... almost colored like a peach skin. There's a half finger light tan head which eventually falls into a thin film atop the beer but never leaves a completely exposed liquid. There's very sticky webby lacing around the snifter.  The nose is boozy like plums soaked in moonshine with some apples and a sweeter fruit like a pineapple or a slight cherry scent.  Big complex taste with a sweet fruity taste. There's some pineapple, a lot of booze, some spicy hops (which leave the mouth extremely dry), some slight orange flavor and even more hop dryness. Whew. That's spicy. It's sweet up front then turns boozy then hits you with a wall of hops.  I have to admit that I absolutely love this beer but it's actually a bit better with about 18 or so months on it.

The back of the label even warns that if you hesitate, do not buy it. I've been joyeously waiting for this moment for months. The few beers I had in the night were just mere sideshows for this, the main event. From the 2006 release, let's get on to this beer:  For best results, I've given this beer about a half hour out of the fridge to warm up from ice cold. Pours an outstanding head with a rich copper color. Lots of tropical and piney scents in the beer. Now the ride begins, and down the hatch it goes. Oh my goodness! Unbelievably smooth and sweet. Gigantic amounts of tropical fruits in the flavor, a bit of chocolate and sugar, and very warming alcohol. Very syurpy and sticky as it goes down.  What's scary is the drinkability of this ale, so watch out. There's certainly bitterness in there, but it doesn't seem like it's a 100 IBU beer, it's so smooth.

Some pine hops as well in the back, smell really starts to come out as it warms for a while/ The taste on this was HUGE. Again as it starts there is the alcohol, which at 10%ABV is unmistaken and pronounced. This must be let to set to truly appresicate the other flavors. Mellows out into a highly hopped strong ale, with a big ddry finish. Huge pine, and candied sweetness. This is a BIG beer with BIG teeth, be forwarned. I goes down nicely enough if you are prepared for it, very dry and beautiful texture, not oily and definatly not thin. Crisp, tough, this will kick your ass. It is highly drinkable, at lest for me.

Taste is like a welcome slap in the face. Hops and malt galore! Pineapple and grapefruit with a fierce bite of alcohol in the finish. Perfectly balanced in the mouth, not chewy but full. Only the heat of the alcohol made me keep the drinkability down.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,younger35,4.3,"Drank from a Weizen glass. Got the good ol' 22oz bottle. Really liked the original bastard and was very excited to try this one.  Appearance- A nice dark caramel amber. Not great head but decent. Left faint lacing on my glass.  Smell- Smelled much better than the original. A very nice fruity aroma with a malty backround. The alcohol is very warming.  Taste- A nice caramel malty sweetness is the first thing that jumps out at me. Has a very fruity, hoppy undertone that blends nicely. The alcohol warms awesomely on the back of my tongue. A very well balanced beer.  Mouthfeel- Light carbonation. Medium bodied. A very nice stickyness. Nice warming alcohol.  Drinkability- Not a drink more than one 22oz bottle beer with the 10% ABV but very tasty. I was very pleased with this beer. It was a step above it's little bastard brother. Will definitely pick this up when I run across it again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,ericj551,4.6,"Poured from a bomber of the 2005 release procured by my girlfriend as part of a Christmas present. Double bastard is a deep ruby red with an off white head. Smell is rich sweet caramel malts and heavy pine and citrusy grapefruit aromas. Taste is big and bitter upfront, tons of Chinook flavor, with the same piney and grapefruit flavors. The sweet maltiness isn't totally covered up, and it shines through towards the end. Hints of alcohol pop up a bit as it warms, but its mostly hidden by the massive hop and malt flavor. As it warms it gets really drinkable. I had this yesterday at the EBF and I was moved to open this bottle today. Hopefully I'll be able to find it around here in the near future, but I'm not too sure.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,kernalklink,4.74,"Wow- pours a deep dark reddish brown with nice carbonation. solvent aromas with huge hop presence. Sticky sweet at first on the tongue- burnt caramel, some tropical malt breadiness. Great balance, but so many flavors. The tangy citrusy hops dominate after the sweetness fades- huge and oily slick while at the same time making this heavy brew light tasting and refreshing. Despite the solvent fumes, the alcohol presence seems like a muted finely aged liqueur. A slight burn but nothing to hint at the high ABV. For hop-heads this one is the perfect pairing of traditional beer character and the new generation's hop craziness.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Graebner,4.75,"Pours a dark ruby brown with not much head. Lacign remains on top. Moderate bubble action.  Smells yeasty, citrus and floral hops. Rosewater. Fruitiness, like pineapple.  Whoa!! Taste is a face-meltingly awesome blend of piney pitch, delicate yet formidable malty sweetness, caramel, smoke, spice, lots of fruit flavors, alcohol present yet enjoyable. Finishes with lasting oily bitterness.  Mouthfeel is spot-on with the right amount of alcohol, CO2, and consistency. Perfect.  Overall not a session due to abv, but holy crap, this is a magnificent and drinkable brew. Absolutely stunning in it's depth of flavor and perfect mouthfeel. Tremendous. Absolutely tremendous, even for Stone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Jarod,4.5,"Release date of 2003  Bottle size: 22 oz   This beer poured a crystal clear mahogany color that had burnt orange red edges with hints throughout. Carbonation was very good still for being 4 years old. The head produced was a tan cream color, thick and creamy that had a good last time and slowly diminished in a chunky fashion to a fine skim on the edges, and while being consumed it formed slowly on the sides a dingy delicate/intricate lace. The aromas that formed from the glass were of molasses, deep spices, burnt sugars, sweet malts, piney hops, and a slight warmth of alcohol. All fairly consistent throughout the entire bottle, becoming more prominent as beer warmed. The tastes that danced across my tongue were consistent with the aromas. Flavors of pine tree and floral hops, several dark fruits (apples, berries, etc) all soaked in alcohol, warming alcohol notes, sweet malts, burnt sugars and molasses, wood tones all throughout and as the sip ended a combination of sweetness and hops trailed off and an aftertaste of hops only remained. The body was thick and chewy. This beer for aging 4 years held up very well, mellowed and blended nicely over time. An incredible beer fresh and an incredible beer aged. I suggest you try both.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Sticky lacing clings to the sides of the glass.  S: Big citrus fruit. Pine resin. Caramel malts and bread. Warm Alcohol.  T: This bastard starts out with a grapefruit punch to the tongue and is follwed by a nice piney hop bite. Roasted caramel malts with a hint of sweetness. Earthy presence is followed by waming alcohol.  M: Silky smooth. Slight carbination. Warming achohol finishes dry.  D:This beer is well balanced for all that it has going on. The high ABV keeps it from being an all nighter but this is damn drinkable none the less.

147,1056,Rudgers73,3.72,"Nice deep red/burgandy color with a nice head about 1/2"" think sitting on top. The head settles down to a fine fluff that laces the glass well. I am drinking this out of my Duvel tulip glass by the way... The flavor is great. Sweet like pineapple, rich with that same smell that really nice double IPA's have. The smell reminds me of Dogfish 120. The taste is bold to say the least. Big hops blast my mouth bitter from the start, bitter til the end. The alcohol is covered up well with the resin-ating hop flavor. (that was sort of a play on words people, yeah, I know, I rule) The hops are also floral at the end. Tiny hints of sweetness poke through but very slight amongst the hoppy blast. Maybe a little too hoppy... The mouthfeel is that of a strong, dry hopped IPA. Dry, and crisp. This beer is very strong, but unlike several balanced hopped beers, the extreme flavor reminds you that its strong.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Smelt of canned pineapple, citrus grapefruit with moderate tutti frutti , sucre d'orge, and light spruce, pear and banana.  Taste was upfront strong bittersweet pineapple and light gelatin and barley sugar followed by a strong/harsh bitter sweaty spruce and pine with light cinnamon and clove spiciness on a long finish. Palate was medium bodied, softly carbonated, oily, moderately alcoholic and strongly astringent.

147,1056,ZimZamZoom,4.6,"This is the 2006 release, drank in Feb 2007. Poured into a goblet.  A nice medium red color with very little head to speak of despite a down the center pour. I got a single stream of bubbles rising slowly from the center of the glass. Carbonation appears to be at a minimum. Viscosity is very noticeable as I gently swirl.  Aroma is of malt, spicy hops, and warm alcohol.  Taste is again malty at first, with notes of spicy hops. Then it finishes with a long bitter hop aftertaste, followed by an even longer warm alcohol finish. Seriously, you think you are done tasting it and then the alcohol comes back and visits you again for several seconds.  This beer is big and heavy. Excellent mouthfeel overall, complimented by the warming alcohol.  A nice one to sip on a night that's going to get down to 0 degrees, during the second half of the Super Bowl, when you know you are going to have to go right to bed when it's over.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,oakbluff,4.32,"Aquired via trade with Hogtown Harry. I've been wanting to get my hands on this for a long time, so I am very excited! Pours out quite dark and cloudier than the regular ABA. Nose is hops, hops and more hops. First sip- wow. Its like getting hit in the head with a shovel. You scrape yourself off the floor and ask for more. One of the most bitter beers I've had. Booze tast is fairly evident and it has quite a dry finish. Its tough to describe the malt due to the massive hop bill. I would love to get my hands on more of these- however this is the poster child of 'enjoy in moderation'!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,ReDave,3.93,"Haven't had this for several years or so, back then i wasn't quite so enamored with it. Not that i didn't like it, i guess i felt if it was double then i was expecting to be blown away with over powering intensive flavors, and if i remember right, i was surprised that it seem mellow in comparison to single bastard.   Fast forward to today...  2006 release. [after several years of double IPA, and other massive ales, I've learned that double doesn't mean approaching painful, in fact many double IPA's are in some ways more mellow that regular IPA's, the extra malt seems to smooth out some of the edges... same for this] Pours a similar color to single bastard. dark brown amber, more dense, if not exactly cloudy, nice thick creamy head. sticky lace all the way down.  Aroma nice but not intense, some sweet maltiness, with some spices.  Taste, a full flavored beer, when you let the flavors swirl around in your mouth the complexity of many flavors is what attracts me to these bigger ales. an earthy like flavor [a totally good way] hops complex malts good stuff!  Found a couple of old 2010's back in deep storage, and they held up well! [1/11/16] Probably best to imbibe in these, as they will not be improving however. Still a nice big complex beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,BeerTruth,4.2,"I prefer the double bastard more than the arrogant bastard. This poured a dark foggy amber with a fairly think khaki colored head. Hops are clearly present with a bit of a malty, woody, background. The balance to this beer is excellent, very drinkable for a 10% ABV. Definitely take your time with this one, and enjoy all it has to offer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,BusyNinja,4.43,"I love this beer in a bottle, and have been rationing myself after purchasing a full case. On tap it seems so much better balanced. Hops are present, but not in yer face.

147,1056,foureyedgeek,4,"22oz bottle, poured into a mug.  Pours a clear, ruby-red/brown, pillowy light tan head, an easy three fingers tall. Pretty decent head retention and some minor lacing.  Smell is dominated by citrus hoppiness, grapefruit, and pineapple sweetness.  Taste is at first sweet, backed by a nice level of hoppiness. There's some caramel or vanilla in there, too, good maltiness. The hops surge in the finish. This is a very interesting combination,a battle of wills between sweet and bitter, ending in a delicious truce.  Whew, this is a hot beer! No hiding of the alcohol in this one, I'll bet this beer is a treat with a year on it, although I'd hate to wither the hops too much.  Mouthfeel is drying and slightly cloying, along with the alcohol warmth filling the drink.  Drinkability is pretty good, this beer would be odd without the high ABV, but at the same time, getting into more than one bomber of this in a short night would be quite a feat for me. This one put me out.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Enola,4.28,Mmm. That was my first thought when I tasted this fine brew. This is a hybrid between a DIPA and a Barleywine. There is a nice bitterness and the alcohol is noticable but not overpowering. The taste is bitter and there is an underlying sweetness. The hop aftertaste lingers for a good while. Lots of lacing in the glass. The head is in no hurry to leave. One bomber of this will really warm the tops of your ears up.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,veech,3.05,"This beer just seemed an example of trying to do too much. The appearance and smell both seemed to bode well, with a very complex array of scents and aromas, everything from grasslike hints to a spicy cinnamon. I found the taste to be sort of all over the place. It was very obtuse with a very strong alcohol feel throughout. The hops seemed to work in opposition to the early maltiness and the alcohol burn was another confounding factor with the spices seemingly out of kilter as well. It wasn't terrible, just not particularly pleasing. The mouthfeel was nice but not really noteworthy as well. I found that the whole beer could be summed up in one word: unbalanced. I was surprised considering the amount of hype surrounding this brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Onibubba,4.12,"My first taste of the 2006. Copper brown with a very small tight beige/white head that offers surprisingly good lacing. Smell is powerful with citrusy hops and a sweet toffe. That malty backbone is present in the taste, but the hop frofile is what is on stage here. This really reminds me VERY much of one of the sweeter DIPAs, like DFH 90 Minute for example. Wish I had one handy for a side by side... Mouthfeel is nice and full and the alcohol is very well hidden. Drinkability is good - Excellent if you are a Hop Head.

147,1056,Budlum,4.48,"2006 edition served from a fresh growler from Capone's.  Pouring this ale produces one inch of creamy, tan head that slowly recedes to a quarter inch layer. Head retention and lacing are excellent. The body is an absolute, textbook amber color displaying excellent clarity and moderate carbonation.  The nose of this beer is quite simple yet delicious. A dry, earthy, hop smell blends with a perfectly balanced, sweet, malty aromas. Very balanced in presentation although I expected a little more pop.  The flavors of this beer are much like the smell only with the ""pop"" that I expected from the smell. An assertive hop flavor provides a strong, earthy taste much like Arrogant Bastard. Unlike the anchor, this version blends in a delicious, honey-kissed malt flavor that balances the hops perfectly. There are still many woody flavors like AB but everything just feels smoother. A faint, wheat malt and hefeweizen yeast flavor also lurk in the background. This is one very fine beer.  The mouthfeel of this beer presents good carbonation mixed with a creamy feel. It is also quite buttery likening to a solid English Ale.  Drinkabilty is excellent. I expected this to be more aggressive than AB but it turned out to be much smoother. This beer is just dangerously drinkable for the 10% ABV.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The nose came roaring out of the bottle and smacked me in the olfactory nerves. This beer screams hops and malt...strong ale indeed. The taste starts off appropriately enough as very malty but is quickly overtaken by the citrusy bitter hops. Everything about this beer is assertive, even the label. The mouthfeel was oily but full. This is a big beer with a big body. The drinkability suffers from the overpowering flavors and the high ABV. I was belching hops far into the wee small hours of the morning. Perhaps I'm just not worthy.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,AltBock,4.55,"22 oz. 2006 release bomber bottle that was silk screened like all of the other Stone Brewing bottles. This one had the same Arrogant Bastard Stone gargoyle picture, but a bit smaller. If you don't know what that is, it's the Stone gargoyle giving his usual fang toothed evil grin with a mug of beer in one hand while the other hand is making some king of gang sign. But wait, this beer is called Double Bastard! That means that above the regular Stone Gargoyle is a duplicate of him, but in a gargoyle blood red color. Upon further inspection of the Stone Gargoyle you are going to notice that he or she has a Worf head. What is a Worf head? Worf is the Klingon Starfleet officer in Star Trek and he has a very noticeable bumpy head. The Stone Gargoyle has the same bumpy head like Worf has. I don't why, but I'm guessing that the Stone Gargoyle is some kind of Klingon. Once you get past the Klingon Stone Gargoyle, the back of the bottle has the definition of the word diatribe and the usual Stone novel below that. The Stone novel talks about the brewery, how this a muther of a beer, and it's not like the yellow fizzy liquid you normally drink. To me it's just a large run on sentence. You'll also find on the bottle the release date, cellar temp, State and Government warning, and their website address. Enough of the bottle, let me get to the beer already. It's about damn time!  Appearance: When poured into an average Snifter, the beer was a very unique color. The color is a very deep dark chestnut brown with plenty of dark ruby red highlights all through out the beer. The ruby red highlights were pretty close to the red that can be found on the red duplicate of the Stone Gargoyle on the label. Hopefully my words came close to what the beers actually color is. It was hard to describe. The head of foam's color was just as hard to describe as the color of the beer was. It wasn't white, but it wasn't tan either. It was somewhere in the middle toward the white side. The head of foam height could have been a little better, but for a 10% brew, it's pretty good. It was half an inch in height that had good retention that left behind plenty of white almost tan colored rings, but left little lace around the Snifter.  Smell: The smell of this beer was really good to begin with, but when you swirled it around in your glass, it got better. What was great that not one aroma stood out by itself. What you'll get is an orgy of fruits mixed in with burning hops and little malt in the background. The first aroma to emerge is the citrus fruits like the grapefruit. Then you'll smell dark fruits like raisins and plums. The last but not least variety of fruits to show up is the juicy fruits like the peaches and apples. You might get a small whiff of the juicy fruits at the end of the fruit orgy. After the fruit orgy will come the bitter citrus hops, roasted malts, and sweet caramel at the end.  Taste: Don't do what I did when I first took a big gulp of this beer. If you do you will regret it. If you happen to take a big gulp, be prepared. You will choke on bitter citrus hops and tons and tons of alcohol if you do. Don't do that, just take sips and that's more than enough to discover all the flavors hiding inside this beer. I found out that this beer does not taste like it smells. The initial taste is that of bitter and I mean bitter citrus hops. After that was a tiny amount of citrus fruits, roasted malts, pine needles, some sweet caramel, and a big taste of alcohol at the end. Don't think you're done with the bitter citrus hops because they aren't through with your tastebuds just yet. They will show up at the end, but this time they will show up with friends, bitter friends. It was very hoppy! I believed is beer was almost to the point of being nothing but hop juice.  Mouthfeel: Wow!! The mouthfeel was very full bodied with an extremely strong aftertaste of bitter citrus hops and some alcohol hiding behind that. The alcohol mixed in with bitter citrus hops creating am aftertaste that is very hard to get rid of out of the back of your mouth. Water couldn't wash away this aftertaste, but I'm thinking that the only thing that would get rid of this strong bitter aftertaste is peppermint Altoids. The aftertaste almost feels like I took a big bite of a hop bud while I was drinking hard liquor at the same time.  Drinkablity: I could see myself drinking this again, but not at the same because then I wouldn't know where I was or what I was doing at that time. I have to say that it's a very dangerous a beer. Before you know it, you drank half of it and you're feeling a bit tipsy. If you wish to drink the beer the Klingon Stone Gargoyle on the label would drink, then try this beer immediately. It is true what they say, ""it's one muther of a beer!"" Double Bastard did make the perfect beer to celebrate Pepeton's birthday! If you read this, please send him a Happy Birthday beermail. He will enjoy it!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Aromas are chalk full of spice and ready to burst from the juicyness. A bit of malt is noticeable also. T/M: Pine, grapefruit, and pineapple hop notes right from the start. Nice bitterness accompanies the flavors, but it isn't lip smacking. Maltyness is very abundant. Flavors of caramel, burnt sugar, and spicy fruits all play supporting roles. Excellent mouthfeel on this brew despite the high abv, which actually goes unnoticed. A quite complex brew with many different flavors. Above average body with a juicy, resiny, and coating mouthfeel.

This is one tasty brew. Aftertaste that lingers is a piney hop resin coating of the tongue. The vscosity is also excellent. Right on the money.  Drinkability is excellent too. the 10% alcohol is noticeable, but not in any sort of harsh way.

It smells very nice, like caramel, hops, cherries and a bit of a spicy smell. It tastes very hoppy, like grapefruit, pine and some malt. Overall the taste is very strong and hoppy, and a bit harsh at times. The mouthfeel is almost syrupy, it's on the thicker side and it's full bodied. Drinkability is good but not excellent.

Well, many thanks to Matt at the beer store for talking me into trying this gem. It's only the second all 5 review I've given.  This poured a gorgeous garnet color into a chalice. Great, creamy and sticky lace which lasted forever. Huge aromas of hops and malts. Incredible hop flavor balanced by incredible malt flavor.

Heavier side of medium bodied and a medium amount of carbonation. Overall, good beer for sure, but I can't help but think a different hop choice could make this so much better. Don't take the above comment the wrong way, it's just my opinion and Stone does a damn fine job as it is. Would buy again.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,ruinationation,4.08,"Poured a dark ruby almost brown color. Not alot of head forms and then quickly disappears. Little lace traces but nothing campared to original AB.  Has a very sweet carmal and floral notes. The sweetness of this beer was surprising to me.  Has a very complex taste with pine, carmal, and maybe a little plums coming through. IBUs are a little misleading.  Thick consentency, spit like you've been drinking coffee. I prefer the original AB but this is a good double, but would like to age one and see if the sweetness eases up. I recomend one of these followed by a ruination.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,RedChrome,4.35,"A murky tea brown colored beer. A slow developing half inch head shrank wuickly to a sheen on top of the beer. Less then average amount of tiny carbonation barely visible. Clumps of lacing.  A very pleasant sweet plum aroma was the first to hit the nose. Bitter hops aroma is elusive as it comes and goes. A definite alcohol presence marks this as a stronger beer.  Sweet taste combines a handful of flavors, which paly to each other instead of overpowering them. Combination of pine, chocolate, caramel, and plum. Alcohol taste helps the flavors play against the strength.  A nice slightly thicker then most beer. Decent carbonation burst on the tongue helps flavors shift.  An excellent offering. This one would be perfect to enjoy with pepper jack cheese. Another spectacular brew from an awesome brewery. Defintly try it if oyu get the chance.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Erdinger2003,4.23,"The head is very frothy and stays throughout the beer. It also has a great super dark color to it. The taste is very nice and very hoppy, but had some harshness to it.

147,1056,vwcraig,4.17,"2006 Double Bastard  Poured translucent dark amber with thinnest ring of head around edge. Smells of sweet malt mostly with only a small citrusy hop smell. Initial fruity banana taste switching to a dark malt and hop bitterness. Very interesting. Hop comes through in a bitter and resiny taste. Acidic hop bite mellows to a mild sweetness. Lower carbonation with a decent mouthfeel, only slightly bubbly. Smoother than expected and not as harsh or abusive as standard AB. Decent drinkability for 10% and I will be a fan of this every year it is released.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Avagadro,4.03,"A: Nice garnet color with an orange-ish head that holds up well. This beer is very clear.  S: Lots of aroma present. American hops ( centennial perhaps? ) and ethyl alcohol are out in the open.  T: Very strong. I haven't had a beer like this since Founder's Devil Dancer. Very hoppy all the way through with a hint of ethanol at the end. Pretty basic flavor but it is very intense.  M: Medium body and a fair amount of carbonation. Tingles on the tongue.  D: I couldn't imagine drinking more than one of these. This is huge in every department, it could use a few years aging before being bottled. It's good, but I feel it's alittle unbalanced. It needs alittle more maltiness to it to counteract the immense amount of hops.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The head is strong and noble, leaving a thick, bready, filmy foam as well as sporadic lacing. The aroma is a spicey mix of hops, sudgey amber malts, and alcohol. The red grapefruit aroma with this beer is pretty good. The taste was a little discouraging. Was good, but a little stronger than I was hoping. The alcohol was integrated with the hops and malts very well. Sometimes I think it cut out some of that dry amber malt smack I just love. The Grapefruity hops and alcohol were ok. Or at least make up for some of my dissapointment. The palate is cleansing and has a nice burn to it. Keeps the chest a little warm actually.  Not exactly what I was hoping for, but still pretty good. I think this beer has some aging potential.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,dherling,4.06,"Poured out a really pretty clear dark caramel color with a big bubbly bone white head leaving behind big sticky lacing. The nose offers grapefruit, alcohol, yeast, malt, hops, melon, and candy. The taste gives rotten apple, apricot, bad melon, alcohol, big bitter green hops, spice, persimmon, and even some Mike Tyson sweat. Don't ask. The mouthfeel is spicy, the tight carbonation is nearly painful. How'd they do that? The alcohol wasn't terribly masked, it's a bit much to really drink more than one, but drinking one is a treat.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Poured a ruby red with little to no head but nice lacing. Nice nose with a fruity, hoppy nose. Tastes of fruit ad bitterness. The hops are a little over indulged but it hides the alcohol well. 10% ABV, I can't find it.  This is strong beer not for the weak, but it is very smooth if you like that sort of thing. Very nice to drink while watching a movie. It will last for the whole two hours. It's as nice as a sipping Tequila!  Good stuff!

Dark ruby/auburn color. Good retention, but not much in the way of lacing.  Smell is sweet and fruity with citrus and tropical hops and some bready malt.  Taste is fairly smooth and balanced with sweet malty and hops. Tropical, citrus hop flavor followed by a bready, toffee middle and finished with a nicely bitter dry finish.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth. Hides alcohol very well.  A very drinkable beer that I am very glad I finally had the chance to taste. Smooth, but dangerous as the 10% ABV is totally hidden in the taste. Simply delicious and awesome!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Body is dark orange/nrown and holds a very lasting two finger thick tan head that is fluffy and inviting.  Pine, orange zest, tons of caramel, toasty fruit cake notes and a very substantial mouthfeel. Its pretty narrow, but extremely concentrated.

147,1056,shivtim,4,"Rich red/brown with a thin tan head and slight orange tints. Looks nice. nose is hoppy but with a good malt balance and some slight spicing. Taste is super hops, but there's an interesting play of various hop flavors. It evolves in your mouth. Still, it's all hops, and a tad syrupy. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good as well.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Its smell is of citrus and fruit, with some nice barely notes. A nice pleasant aroma. The taste hits hard, strong and sharp with the same citrus flavor and some caramel qualities too. This is potent flavor, and not for light beer drinkers. It's a very robust and sharp mouthfeel that is very pleasant. I can't rate the drinkability too high as this stuff is powerful and after one bottle I'm reeling. If I could handle 10% ABV better, I'd rate it higher!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,tempest,4.4,"I have to begin by wondering why this beer doesn't have yearly distinctions like Old Guardian. Moving on... damn it's a good beer. Not the beer I've had, but it's very finely crafted.  This will sound a little funny, but at first all I can think abour is pineapple when smelling this beer. It smells like a case of pineapple cores were dropped in the mash tun. Hops can do funny things I guess. For taste there is a lasting dry bitterness that hits you slowly and doesnt leave.there's more pineapple with some citrus and fruit rind piled on top of big, sweet barley flavor. It seems like there is some more room for complexity, but what this beer has is pretty bad good.  My only major qualm with this beer is that it's so damn tasty, but I can't stomach too much too fast. This is a definate sipper. If you can find this beer, be sure to share it with a deserving friend or relative.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Double Bastard pours a nice deep amber color with a medium-sized, tannish color head. It has pretty nice lacing and a very consistent color.  Smell is sweet and full. There is a great candied pull of caramel and toffee. A nice and balanced hop bite is there as well. Alcohol is also notable, with an aroma that vaguely resembles lesser tinges of whiskey. Very impressive.  Taste is absolutely fantastic!! Hoppy and bitter up front. There is a very bitter citrusy, strong grapefruit presence. Balanced, if a bit sharp. The 10 percent abv is barely noticeable. Eminently smooth and drinkible.  In the mouth D.B. is full and sharp. A very strong presence.  This is a very nice beer. Very heavy and sharp.

A - ruby reddish brownish conglomerate with a thin tan head that disspates rapidly, scant slow carbonation snakes its way up the glass  S - aroma packs an alcoholic punch, big alocohl and grapefruit aromas, sweet subtlety to it as well, but mostly just alcohol  T - hmmm, kinda leaves me hanging, nice flavor, but the only strength is again in the alcohol, slight grapefruittiness, a nice flavor and brew, but this was hyped a little much for me, but still a quality brew, and it did get better as it warmed up  M&D - light bodied and a little big on the alcohol, which will draw from the drinkability, but a decent brew, was just expecting a bit more flavor  i may have to grab another bottle to age, i heard its better that way",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,PhiloPsych,4.83,"Pours a big, bubbly head that leaves lacing around the whole glass. When cold, the taste is much sweeter than the regular Arrogant Bastard. As it warms the other flavors come through. Not as harsh as the regular Arrogant Bastard, but there is just as much complexity. Maybe a bit smoother and more drinkable than the regular Arrogant Bastard, which is surprising since the alcohol is heavier here. As far as I am concerned this is a really great beer. Very good.

Smells of sweet malt draws me in.  T: Malt up front, overtaken by hops, then spiciness. Alcohol bite and bitterness on the finish. I thought it almost takes Belgian in the background, but this is mostly shielded by great hop character.  M: In the front of the mouth is beer is thick and creamy. The bitterness and alcohol start to wear away on the back of mouth though.

Undulating tan head of tiny to medium bubbles. Smell is caramel and hops, crisp and fresh, some hay and just enough grass to be noticed. Intense caramel malts and strong hops topped with an alcoholic kick. Aftertaste is an incredible hop flavor spiked and bitter. Lots of residual sugar. Full body with good coating.

S: Bourbon and cherries are the first detectable aromas. A spicy hop character is present in the background.  T: Sweet, lightly roasted malts. Hints of bourbon soaked cherries. Malt quickly gives way to a balanced hop flavor. Hops are oily, bitter, and spicy all at the same time. Huge alcohol flavor rounds everything out.  M: Full bodied, chewy, and so damn smooth. Probably the smoothest beer I've ever had.  D: Big time alcohol presence takes away from the drinkability of this beer slightly. However, some time in the cellar would almost certainly change that.

Strong aroma of hops, with other smells of citrus fruit and little smokiness.  Taste is good, until the alcohol hits. Smoky malt at first, and then a huge hop hit. But, whatever good flavors come out at the beginning are totally covered up by the brutal alcohol punch-in-the-teeth at the end. Extremely unbalanced, and almost difficult to drink.  Mouthfeel is decent, hard to keep it in your mouth long enough to get a good idea.  Drinkability is not good. Prevalent alcohol bite overwhelms the good points of the beer.  Overall I was disappointed with this beer, which was a surprise because I like more extreme brews.

Slight brown sugar & alcohol warming follows along with dryness & hints of caramel. Piney hops linger on the tounge along a hint of oakyness & cinamon  MF: Chewy with low carbonation  Drinks pretty good, just a little too hefty to session on, especially when they are served up in bombers.

Rather sweet flavor, but this sweetness takes a backseat to the HUGE hop bitterness. Dry, piney, and bristly. Pith-like. Finishes with a fading alcohol heat.  Mouthfeel is interesting -- creamy and smooth, like a spirit, but meanwhile hops are stabbing the palate. An interesting contrast.  For its strength and bitterness, this beer is damned drinkable.

Clear, dark amber color with red-orange hues gradating themselves in the varied widths of the taster.  Smell: Powerful. I can tell this is going to be a worthy opponent for my palette. Smells of oily hops and staunch wood. Faint fruity smells are that of apple and pineapple.  Taste: BAM! An immediate blast of alcohol intensity hits hard and fast. The hops are there and are bittering (which would subside if aged for a year or so). Main flavors consist of tart wood and fresh hops. Maltiness is way is the background fighting for a chance. So is the faint pineapple taste.  Mouthfeel: Perfect. Great for what an ale of this nature should be. I feel like the alcohol is seeking out every cranny in my mouth to attack. Carbonation is present and not everwhelming.  Drinkability: As a fan of high ABV beers, I enjoyed this one thoroughly. However, I believe it would be better served after a year to tone down the hop intensity and see other flavors immerge. It seems like it could be a very complex beer but screams with alcohol burn. Affordability makes this beer highly drinkable.  I would purchase this beer again, but I would cellar it for a little.

Smells of caramel, fruit, and notes of alcohol. Taste is sweet and bitter, fruity at first, then malty, then a nice hoppy kick to the aftertaste. The carbonation is great and it's not as thick as 10% ABV would make me assume. For its alcohol content, it's very easy to drink this. I didn't really start loving this beer until halfway through - it takes a few sips.

The flavor of the beer was deeply malty with notes of toffee and chocolate. The hops had an earthy flavor with some grapefruit. There was some kind of funky astringency that really detracted from the overall flavor.  The carbonation was good and the mouthfeel was medium/heavy.

The smell is of caramel, earthy grains and citrus. Mild alcohol.  The taste is of thick sweet malt upfront - caramel, sweet - barley(?) ...brown sugar. It is balanced out, and beaten out after the second sip - by bitter citrus - orange and grapfruit. Soon, the citrusy, chewy hops fully emerge to overtake the maltiness. The malt, however, remains intact and give the hops a solid backbone. Complex, and the flavors are nicely layered.  The feel is smooth with an incredibly well-balanced texture. The abv is barely noticeable in the taste and feel - leaving it to sneek up on you.  This is an incredible brew - nicely balanced with the hops in control in the end. Fresh, full, tasty and complex.

This is a beer which should stand by itself b/c any beer that you will have afterwards would be overwhelmed. DB is one of my favorites.  I have had this beer previously after 1 and 2 years of cellaring and I think the beer is at its peak after 1year. Itis a little hot when fresh but too mellow after two years.

Taste starts out very grapefruity, the most distinctly grapefruit flavour I've noticed in a beer to date. A smooth, malty backbone also is present with some caramel tones. The high alcohol is most apparent on the swallow, as it gently warms the throat on the way down. A good hop bitter on the finish as well. A slight warming effect a few seconds after each swallow as well. Very solid.  Mouthfeel, viscuous, great hop bitters, very solid. Drinkability, not a problem, an easy drinking big beer.

Good mouthfeel thick and smooth. Drinkability is really a preference. I will have this again and again, but I probably wouldn't open two bottles of it a night (at least not all the time).

Appealing aroma of sweet dark and caramel malts, dark fruit, and some brown sugar, along with a noticeable alcohol presence. Palate is a rich and complex blend of malty sweetness, dark fruit, and brown sugar up front. A subtle hoppy bitterness emerges before the swallow and lingers long into the aftertaste, balancing things out a bit. Notes of figs and prunes come through on the finish.

In other words, it looks spectacular. The nose is very complex and rich with lots of deep rich chocolatey malts and spices. Some hops too.  The flavor is initially very sio the AB, but then it hits you. Very sweet from the get go, and reminds me quite a bit of SN Bigfoot. Finishes very dry, too dry. Leaves me with cotton mouth from the aggressive hops. Leaves an unpleasant aftertaste. It's much more concentrated than the AB and unfortunately, you can taste the alcohol.  The mouthfeel is very slick and full. Glides over the tongue quite easily, but The drinkability suffers a bit due to the hotness of the alcohol, but for the style, it's pretty drinkable I guess.

Head is slow to settle and leaves a significant lacing behind.  Aroma:  Candied caramel apples, butterscotch, toasted malts and a tinge of alcohol tickle the nostrils.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  Spectacularly smooth with a chewy body. This is some complex stuff, with flavor characteristics of caramelized sugar and fresh fruit battling it out over a port background. This is absoulely fantastic, though I still can't see what this has to do with the Arrogant Bastard, which try as I might, I simply cannot enjoy. Alcohol is well masked in this. All the flavors come together nicely here for a well balanced beergasm on your tongue. I only purchased 4 of these, but I think it's time to head back to the store and grab a few more before they're gone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,cabsandking,4.17,"An attractive dark red/brown color with garnet highlights and a descent sized sticky tan head. Nose characters are of caramel malts, roasted nutty grains, dark fruits, bing cherry, and a little alcoholic tingle. Taste consists of toasted barley, brown sugar, sour cherries, carmel and big nutty malt notes. A boozy alcoholic punch is prominent from the start and maybe a little metallic. Balanced well by some spicy bitter hop characters. The mouthfeel is really pleasant with a medium body leaving a oily slick coating and fizzy on the edges. Pale malt characters come on towards the end.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,schusterbauer,2.66,"2006 bottle; fresh  i really wanted to like this, because i like arrogant bastard very much, but i'm just not sure about this one. despite all of the bold, manly, demonic rantings on the bottle, all this beer really seems to say is ""oooh, look at me, look at me, pick me, tell me i'm pretty!!!"" maybe it could be called Cheap Whore -- i mean, that would come with its own implications of burning sensations, correct?  the beer looks great -- deep deep blood red, very intriguing.  the beer smells like someone decided to make a boiler maker with arrogant bastard. it smells like someone dropped a shot of rot gut vodka into it. even that, to me, is kind of intriguing. i'm never one to shy away from the burn of rugged liquor.  taste: how do you berate something for tasting bad when it seems like it's supposed to taste bad? there are actually a lot of great flavors in this beer (a la arrogant bastard), but they are being smothered to death by the gaudy amount of hops. 10% is not all that wild of an alcohol content. there are a lot of beers that have 10% or more, that do an excellent job of balancing the abv with the rest of the beer. this is not one of those beers. somehow, despite the show pony hop levels, the alcohol still tastes like 5 o'clock vodka. and as for the hop level itself, there are plenty of hugely hopped (and delicious) beers that manage to strike something of a balance with the other ingredients. again, this is not one of those beers.  mouthfeel is fine. it feels way more balanced than it tastes, that's for sure. the extra oil from the hops is kind of nice.  drinkability -- i almost dumped it out, wishing i had opened up any one of the number of exciting beers i have in the fridge. to claim that this beer is highly drinkable seems like a rod-measuring contest, if you catch my drift.  i'm not done with this beer, because for some reason, i really want to like it. i'll buy a couple to cellar for 2 and 4 years, and i'll probably try another fresh one this year. maybe i just got a crappy bottle, but i highly doubt it. this should be sold to brohams at the x-games, because it's so X-TREEEEME!!!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The hops are just about gone in the aroma with the beer smelling and tasting of pecan pie. Tons of caramel with just enough bitterness and alcohol to cut through the apparent sweetness.  Gotta say I really like it after the time in the cellar. It's entirely different now.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Litterbean,4.5,"Just as good, if not marginally better, than the ""normal"" Arrogant Bastard.  Pours reddish and slightly hazy with a creamy head.  Smell is predominantly hops but with a blast of sweetness and aromas that are various and hard to put into words. Think a ton of grapefruits and lemons piled on top of pine needles and soaked in bourbon.  The taste is rough and bitter, almost burns and tears the throat as it passes down but does so pleasantly. I get the feeling I am sucking on a whole hop cone as it washes over my tongue. The sweetness is warped and mutated by the extreme hoppiness and total separation is impossible but it's there and it's sugary, syrupy, thick and sweet.  More powerful than Arrogant Bastard and just as good, I could buy either and be completely happy with it. A side-by-side tasting is necessary, but they're both winners and Double Bastard kicks ass.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Very subtle piney hop, orange, some floral hints, and sweet caramel malt.  This is a nicely balanced beer. Caramel, grains, orange, and even the floral smell comes through sightly in taste. I didn't find this beer horribly bitter, but it's definitely there. It's just hidden well.  Very thick, smooth, and oily. Low carbonation allows the oils and sweetness to stick around in the mouth and on the lips. Goes down very easily. The high ABV would definitely think twice about starting a second bottle, but I probably could.  Of all the Bastard choices, this is my favorite. I'm actually not that big a fan of regular old Bastard, but this one is dang good.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Doomcifer,3.89,"2006 Release:  Pours a hazy, dark amber/copper color with an attractive, frothy beige colored head that retained lovely, setting up nice lacing on the glass.  Smells phenomenal. Rich malts, caramel, toffee. Then theirs the citrus and piney hop character screaming its way through as well. Mouth watering.  Tastes of sweet malts, biscuity, caramel, slightly fruity even, finishing extremely bitter, aspiriny, astringent, and slightly medicinal. Lots of alcohol present but the bitterness in the finish covers it up well, besides the obvious warming.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and decently carbonated.  Considering the high abv% and the enormous characteristics, this beer isn't THAT drinkable but very enjoyable for what it is. I consider AB to be very overrated, and this probably is as well...but, I enjoy this one more than the regular Bastard, and the Oaked Bastard. I wouldnt mind storing a couple of these in the cellar for a while since I actually enjoy the regular Bastard when it's a little older and this one would be that much better.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The smell of this beer was a weird mixture of malt, fruit, and a little hops. Very refreshing aroma.  The taste of this beer was great. Showing hints of Stone's 10th Anniversary Ale, this beer had a nice balance of Hops, Malt, and a slight sweetness. The were hints of brown sugar, cloves, grapfruit, and cherries. The hops was balanced very very with the sweeter malt and the taste turned out great. The mouthfeel was good, CO2 perfect, thickness perfect, and not a strong hint of alcohol you would expect from such a high alcohol beer.

Tons o hop bomb in the aroma. But the quaff, ummmm, back to top notch. A cross between a DIPA and a strong Belgium ale. Floral hop start, malty and woody finish  very unique. And tasty.

147,1056,westweasel,4.45,"2006 DB poured from a 22oz. ""bomber"".  The beer poured out a very dark amber color, with a small head. To its credit, the small head lasts until the bottom of the glass. The bear is fairly clear for a heavily-hopped monster.  The smell is a mixture of different citrus smells, and a bit of pine, and a definite strong alcohol odor. The scents are most notable when the beer is first poured, and seem to dissipate quickly in the glass. It smells a lot like regular Arrogant Bastard, but a little stronger.  The taste has a number of flavors woven together. I can taste carmel, sweet toffee, and light molases. These are contrasted with a strong hop bitterness, which seems like the same mixture of orangey citrus and pine that you pick up in the smell. In all it's pretty balanced.  The mouthfeel is very full, almost syrupy. There is a slight alcohol burn, but it is less than I would have expected. It has a dry finish that shows up right after you get past the hop bite.  The drinkability is surprisingly good for something with so much hop bitterness. At least one 22oz. bottle will be pretty easy to finish.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,froggyfrog,4.7,"Oversized beer in an oversized bottle (from an oversized brewer in an oversized state). Served in an oversized wine glass.  Fresh 2006 Edition.  Murky mauve-tinged orange liquid with a walnut colored dish soap bubble head. The persistent head, built of large frothy bubbles, exhibits a tenacious clingy lace on the glass.  Aroma is hardcore West Coast hops with a commanding malt presence. Sweet is the word here. Earthy scents of moss covered tree bark mingle with whiffs of blood oranges. Very barleywine-like with strong notes of plums, blackcurrants and other dark fruits. A delightfully spicy alcohol note develops as this beer warms.  Damp topsoil, ginger, and yeast are my initial impressions of tastes on my palate. This beer seems to have a similar flavor construct to Stone's Ruination DIPA but with the bitterness levels toned down to allow other aspects to be showcased. The hops are still a potent force in this beer (as if Stone would allow anything less) and shine through as a lusty floral essence. The malt is toasted and brown with a dry chewy caramel feel.  Tactile impression is viscous sugary alcohol with a clipped dry-bitter finish. This middleweight champion's distinguishing feature is a post-swallow alcohol reflux. (I don't notice the alcohol going in, but it is evident in the inevitable belch).  Drinkability is what it is with any big beer from Stone. An exceptional experience for us balls-out flavor and bitterness junkies, but I can quickly name ten people who would run crying to hide under their beds if confronted with a beer like this.

147,1056,BuckeyeNation,4.53,"""Ye Shall Know the Bastard, and the Bastard Shall Set You Free.""  --Double Bastard bottle  2005 Release. Glowing cherry caramel with amber and orange edges. DBA is a beautiful, multi-hued sunset of a beer. The thickly creamy head is the color of brown sugar mousse whipped with orange juice and is easily the equal of the glorious liquid that it will soon join. Well... maybe not so soon. Thick sheets of buttery lace are slathered on the upper few inches of the nonic pint glass. A remarkable look for such a high ABV ale.  I know the two styles overlap to a considerable extent, but Double Bastard Ale smells like an American barleywine to me. And a great barleywine at that. It's heavy on sweet, sticky caramel, as well as orange zest and candied cherries. I'm glad I let this bottle sit for a year (it took a great deal of willpower) because I get no hint of alcohol in the nose.  This is outstanding beer. I can tell after one large gulp that it's one of my favorite Stone releases. The butter toffee and brown sugar maltiness is monolithic, broad-shouldered, pick your favorite adjective for 'immense', and still has its knees buckled by a deluge of hoppy bitterness. I love it when sweet and bitter kick the crap out of one another and both end up bloodied, but unbowed.  Double Bastard may not be the hoppiest, most bitter Stone brew (I'll bet it's close), but it might be the hoppiest, most bitter American strong ale on planet Earth. I still think of it as a barleywine, since the strong ale style has always seemed like a dumping ground. As the beer warms, the sticky malt makes an even stronger statement and the hops continue their jackhammer-like assault.  It's been too long since I've had an Arrogant Bastard for my memory to be all that reliable, but this beer seems both more assertive and more refined, if that's even possible. I'd love to drink them side by side if I thought I could avoid becoming comatose after 44 ounces of ferociousness.  Alcohol is apparent on the palate, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Some beer revels in the power and the presence that well-masked, but still present, alcohol provides. This ain't no sissy, yella, fizzy beer, this is the BastardBastard (speaking of which, I don't think I've ever seen a cooler bottle). In terms of aging, drinking this big ale prior to one year probably isn't advisable if you're looking for maximum enjoyment.  The mouthfeel isn't quite as full and as viscous as I'd imagined. It's full, it just isn't FULL. Since my motto is 'the bigger the better' with respect to mouthfeel, take that with a grain of salt. It's plenty sturdy enough and is becoming firmer as it sits. The carbonation is nicely buried, which helps as well.  Double Bastard Ale lives up to the hype. It's a beer that will kick your ass up one side and down the other and will earn your respect and adoration while doing so. Thanks to Greg and the boys at Stone for continuing to release quality beer after quality beer that, more often than not, defines the style in which it is brewed. This is a 'by the case' brew if I've ever tasted one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The moderate head was tan and eventually faded to a cap that remained throughout the drink.  Smell was spicy, vaguely metallic. Malty with dried fruits. Alcohol soaked fruits, like uncle Joe's rum soaked Christmas fruitcake. Whole wheat bread. Bread crust smell really appeared strongest after the beer had been sitting a few minutes between sips, very intense. Nice.  Taste was alcohol and zesty hops. Rich and surprisingly balanced considering the ""large-ness"" of this beer. The huge sweetness was balanced in the end by the bitter finish. This one is a little too boozey for my tastes but I expected big alcohol from the Double B.

Taste is pretty similar. Strong hop taste. Piney, citrusy, grassy. A bit of maltiness, like sweet caramel. The alcohol is nicely hidden and more evident in the aroma than in the taste.

Nice tan head that lasts for a bit.  Nose: Not much hop aroma, which is a bit surprising considering the style. Has a sweet malty nose with a hint of hops.  Taste: Whoa!!!! What was lacking in nose is definately present in taste. Considering the massive, almost overpowering maltiness and hops,it still has a nice complexity. Very nice hoppy aftertaste. Hops are not overpowering in the fore-taste.  Mouthfeel: You definately know this beer is in your mouth. A thick, malty, slighty carbonated beer.  Drinkability: This ain't a sipping beer, but it's pretty damn close. This should be the last beer of the day, preferably sitting in front of a fireplace, or watching a thunderstorm while sitting on the front pourch. Don't rush it.

Still, hoppy as hell, but the hop presence gels better with the malt to give an in-your-face flavor, but with a more refined hop character. The alcohol is definitely noticable, but not overwhelming, and it helps to round out a smooth, complex flavor.  M: Full-bodied with smooth carbonation. Sticky and thick.

Spunky hair laden labia still entice and effortlessly draw one into a pace that you dont need to be at unless your tongue is on Gene Simmons overtime.  Taste: Transient raucous malt.

147,1056,largadeer,4.25,"2006 bottle.  Double Bastard has a slightly more rounded flavor than the standard Arrogant Bastard - the malt is more pronounced, completely engulfing the palate at first, though the hops do come through quite strongly in the finish. Alcohol is noticeable and warming. The aroma leaps out of the glass; fruity yeast, caramelized malt, powerful pine and citrus hops. The appearance is equally impressive, with a moderate-but-lingering head, curtains of lace, and a translucent ruby color.

147,1056,dblinkhorn,4.43,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Stone Old Guardian specialty glass.  2006 vintage.  Appearance - Pours with a nice two-and-a-half finger tan and creamy head which retains for about four minutes. It eventually settles at a thin layer of creamy head that gets thinner as you get closer to the center. Full, sticky lacing is left as you drink this beer. It is slightly hazy with a beautiful ruby-amber color.  Smell - Lots of hops going on here. Fresh and bitter hops and a strong presence of tropical fruity hops as well (such as Simcoe or Amarillo). Grapefruit, mango, manderine orange, and kiwi make up some of these tropical aromas. Some slighty cherry and plum fruits, as well as a slight over-ripe (almost a bit rotten, but a wonderful smell) tropical fruit aroma way in the background. A rich malty and slightly grainy/earthy, wet hay aroma ties it all together nicely. Moderate alcohol all over the nose.  Taste - An explosion of crisp and bittering hops with more of the tropical fruity hops just behind this. Very juicy hop flavors overall that cause your mouth to salivate rapidly. As the hops die a bit, a warming alcohol becomes stronger. Also, for the finish, a doughy and pudding-like malt character with heavy notes of wet hay and grain as well as moderate earthiness come in. After you swallow this divine beer, some fruitiness and quite strong earthiness remain.  Mouthfeel - A nicely lively carbonation hit right up front, which quickly smooths out and holds the beer's mouthfeel together nicely. This compliments the already very smooth mouthfeel of this beer. It is quite wet overall, but dries up significantly for the aftertaste.  Drinkability - Strong hop flavors especially, and just strong flavors overall. Still, it has a wonderful mouthfeel and a good refreshing quality at least to some extent. This bomber will be no problem, in fact it will be a pleasure!  A superb beer from Stone. It's not just more of what you love in Arrogant Bastard, but lots of different little nuances and tidbits in the flavor that are a wonderful addition to its ""kid brother's"" wonderful foundation.

Actually rather subdued in the aroma.  T- Huge, rich, caramelly malt flavors flavors hit me, along with alcohol and dark fruits. Piney hops lie in the background, inflicting a generous amount of bitterness on the finish. As is always the case with Stone, this is a pleasant bitterness, not at all harsh. Overall a very nice flavor, but the alcohol is quite prominent and not particularly well-hidden.  M- Nice, full mouthfeel. Carbonation is fairly low, but it works. Nearly perfect for this beer.  D- Once again, very good flavor, but it is too rich and alcoholic to be overly drinkable. Still, this was not intended to be a session beer, so I can't really slam it for that, now, can I?  Another good offering from Stone. This is pretty much a barleywine, and was once classified as such on the site, if I'm not mistaken. Whatever it is, it's very good. Not transcendent, but very good. I must say I prefer Arrogant Bastard to this, but that's less a knock on this beer than it is a compliment to AB. Would probably benefit greatly from aging.

147,1056,RidiculedDisplay,4.44,"Appearance: Pours a pretty amberish brown. Brackish murky body. That being said, not many if any floaties upon holding up to a light, just a slight fine silt-like haze. Looks more like a cider than a beer, really. A very dignified body, overall. Head is rather unimpressively non-existent, but the lacing clings to the class in a pretty fine brown mist, leaving a trial of dots. This beer is pretty, but not particularly a highlight.  Smell: Holy mackerel hops. Pine pine pine pine pine. Lemon lemon lemon lemon lemon. Pine pine pine pine pine. Sorry. The hop aroma coming off of this one does have that effect on you, however. Amazing stuff. Normally, even in DIPA's and IPA's, pine aromas tend to be less distinguishable from citrus aromas for me, and the citrus aromas emitted tend to be more orange or grapefruit-like than light spritz of lemon. Here, however, the pine is obvious and assertive, and the lemon I seem to be picking up may just be the pine manifesting itself so completely it confuses my olfactory capabilities. Under that is a definite layer of cinnamon, a strong slap of alcohol, a hint of apple, and some date. Very warming, cozy stuff, and overall an incredible aroma.  Taste: Cinnamon, apple, and date seem to assert themselves up front with piney lemoney hops close behind. Hop bitterness. A little chocolate, maple syrup. Oh and boy alcohol alcohol alcohol. A very ""hot"" beer, indeed. Travels through your nostrils and warms up one's throat. It's a good ""hot,"" though, and appropriate for the chilly time of year of this brew's anual release. A little vinous, almost champagne like. Still, the taste is, in my opinion, less forceful than the aroma. The flavors tend to loose themselves in a general cinnamony-alcoholic haze at times.  Mouthfeel: I've become aware lately that many great beers with otherwise great attributes tend to fall short in mouthfeel. Either under-carbonated orover-carbonated, usually. This one is just right in that respect. Otherwise very oily and slick.  Drinkability: Great stuff. The alcoholic warming effect is just right for the time of year, and the nose is pretty much perfect.

Citrus hops, grapefruit and tangerine,pineapple, pine, and a ""bisquity"" aroma make this a very aromatic beer. The taste has hop bitterness, alcohol, sweet malt, bread yeast, citrus and pineapple fruit, and a hint of carmel. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing very well. This is an outstanding beer that should not be missed. Being on the East coast I'm lucky I found a store that sells Stone.

147,1056,milesfan76,4.52,"For my first ever beer review I thought I'd do one I'd been waiting some time to try. Having been a fan of Arrogant Bastard for a little over a year, I've been really anxious to try this one.  A: Pours a dark, dark, dark amber. About a two finger light tan head that retains beautifully.  S: Yeah! I can smell the hops a mile away (I am kind of a hophead so this is a good thing).  T: Tastes alot like it's name would suggest- like original arrogant bastard with double the arrogance. Powerful.  M: Heavy. About all I can say.  D: I split a 22 oz. with a friend of mine. I probably could have had the whole bottle, but at 10% I wouldn't have wanted much more than that (the salesclerk told me it seemed stonger than last year). However, if I could have drank it all night, I would have been more than happy to do so.  The jury is still out on whether or not I'd rank this above original Arrogant Bastard, but it was definitely worth the wait.  Side note: even if this beer had sucked, the writing on the bottle alone would have been worth the six bucks.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Smell of grapefruit and tangerine. Some grassiness and sweet malt. Some good biscuit hints that were checked by the hops. Felt a bit oily, then sweet, some bitterness and a sweet to dry finish. A bit complex for this ole boy. Alcohol was a bit much for a bomber.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Estarrio,4.03,"Pours an amber, dark copper with a medium, foamy, persistent tan head.  Aroma consists of sweet malt, pine, hops, pineapple and a slight, spicy hint of alcohol.  HUGE malt character blends well with a sweet pineapple, fruity flavor. A bitter, pine hop implosion takes over mid sip. There is a bit of spicy alcohol and pepper in the bitter aftertaste. At fifty degrees, the alcohol taste slightly overpowers the other flavors. As it warms, the sweet malt character reclaims the dominance, rendering this a smooth brew.  Mouthfeel is heavy and quite viscous. Surprisingly, this is not overly syrupy. Quite the drinkable sipping brew!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,bennetj17,3.9,"2006 release. Deep amber color with nice clarity, 1/2 inch tan head which dissipates slowly but never fully disappears. The carbonation is mild. The smell is a blast of astringent hops, alcohol, and notes of tangy caramel and dark plum.  There is alot of everything in the flavor, sharp and resiny hop spice, nutty, tangy dark malt, and lots of alcohol. It's all a bit overpowering. The finish didn't seem too bitter after the first taste, but it wasn't long before that changed. After a few sips it really catches up and lingers like an extra sharp cheese. The finish is also lightly drying with a faint sourness. Medium thick, the mouthfeel is a bit syrupy or cloying. Fair carbonation.  This strong ale lives up to its name, but it was too intense for me to really enjoy it. I definitely had to drink it slow, so finishing the bomber by myself was no easy task.

I can't say much more about it. If you like arrogant bastard give this a try. I know what arrogant bastard tastes like and this is somewhat like that but with more balance and a more aggresive alcohol characteristics. I want a more thick mouthfeel as is common with the stone beers. The balance of this beer is incredible though, it's a great strong ale. I liked this and the oaked a little more than the original.

Deep amber that is clear and is topped by a half inch of tan foam that shows good retention and leaves spotty rings of lace.  The nose is very barley wine. Huge aromas of malt and west coast hops. A bit warm and peppery from the abv. Hints of grapefruit and licorice. Big and bold, yet it has complexity and balance.  Big malt flavor upfront followed by a blast of grapefruit like hops that build and linger yet never cross the line or even tweak it off balance. The alcohol is there yet is integrated as a peppery warmth that shows in the aftertaste yet doesn't upset the whole experience. Lingering hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Not raw like a fresh bottle of Bigfoot. I love it!  Big in the mouth with an almost syrupy texture that is kept in check by the carbonation.

This is an awesome beer, its got all the malts and hops any beer drinker could appreciate. I would have to say, I like it more than AB. Its pretty damn potent at 10% but very drinkable.

Taste is huge, its a hoppy malt bomb is what it is. As it warms up it really starts to hit the spot and had me preparing for my 2nd bottle of it. Mouthfeel is thick, and syrupy, so so malty. Drinkability is high, only hindered a bit by the alcohol punch it gives.

147,1056,scottoale,4.8,"2006 RELEASE - A big beer? They don't come much bigger! (or better).  As poured (conservatively) from the standard, 22oz.brown Stone bomber, 3/4"" ivory froth sits atop a deep, rich mahogany brown with amber highlights, strong ass ale. Aftermath is thick, sticky lace all over the place... gives a little plus to the appearance.  Concentrated aroma, unleashes as it warms to a mighty complexity. Sweet and dark fruity, highly alcoholic...smells somewhat like the Sam Adams double bock of twenty years ago...but ten-fold!  Taste...intensly wonderful, I think this is the best DB yet, seriously. It has a sweet, ripe fruit malty intro that brings to mind bananas, fig, stone fruit and spice that gets a healthy lift of high alcohol. From this point the hops give their best to quench the alc/sweet with a bitter swipe of pine/citrus and just barely come through, only to be slapped back down to the more than ample, 10% ABV. (you guessed it, alcohol).  Full-bodied, light and earthy yet somewhat chewy...this beer has balls! Not for the faint-hearted but I sure do love this stuff, read the label and try it if you dare.  Note: This stuff will age very well...if you have the patience!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Poured after yet another 12 hour day into my trusty Duvel Tulip.  A - A gorgeous ruby red. Beautiful head after a conservative pour, bubbly lacing.  S - Sweet, fruity hops. much more complex than the ""un-squared"" Bastard. Much more warm and inviting. Candied plums?  T - F**k Me! This is one fantabulous ale! Wonderful, sweet malty opening, followed by a bitch-slap of hoppy bitterness which segues immediately into a warm, kick-ass alcohol finish. Gimme more!  M - Fills every crook and nanny. Leaves a wonderful thick, tasty, malty coating on the tongue which is only improved by the next sip.  D - Let me put it this way: I worked 12 hours today, got home at 9:45. I have the same schedule tomorrow. I had resolved to have ""just one"". ...The next one is currently chilling ( to about 45ish degrees), in the fridge. God this is good shit....

147,1056,Phatz,4.62,"First I pulled this out of the fridge and let it really warm. This I served it in my large snifter glass and just melted with delight when I discovered it *IS* as good as they say. It is intense... Too much well, it is a fine line but this one certainly pushes the bar.  Appearance: Pours a deep brown color with ruby hues running through and small tan head. The head is unique in that while pouring it seemed there was going to be little or no head but I slowed the pour and finished the beer seemed to gain the energy to force a creamy head in my snifter glass and then faded to just a halo. Every tilt of the glass left loads of lacing behind.  Smell: When I popped the cap the first thing that came to my mind was Belgian Strong Dark Ale as the wave of darks fruits and toasted caramel malts took me by surprise. After the pour the aroma seems dominated by a solid wood and rum aroma. Suggestions or leather and leafy dry tobacco, burnt plums, green raisins, cherries, brown sugar, caramel candy and boozy aromas of rum all fill the nose and nearly sent me into a tizzy. Finally as the beer warmed there even seemed to be a splash of citrus like some fresh squeezed orange juice in the nose. Absolutely brilliant!  Taste: As I started into this beer I thought ""Oh this is going to be too much."" The alcohol and the citrus hop oils seemed a bit intense. Quickly though my palate adjusted. Maybe a few taste buds died or maybe I just need to warm to it for a minute (the alcohol will do that) because before you know it I was going to town at it and realized I'd better slow it down if I was going to remain conscious enough to write about it. It starts sweet and yet loaded with hops. The pine hop flavor is bold but it does not obliterate the rest of the complex flavors of the brew. It does take some discipline to look past the bold bitey hops & alcohol and notice the roasted caramelized malts, the wood and fruit flavors underneath. Back to the obvious... This beer smacks you with one hand loaded with pine and citrus hops and then while still stunned by the first slap it slaps you again with a alcohol sting in the finish. I swear though, DAB will make masochists out of us all because I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed the abuse.  Mouthfeel: I think the intensity of the beer completely numbed my mouth. It kept ending up in my stomach before I could figure out what it was like in the mouth. RICH! Rich in everything. Flavor and hop tingle and alcohol prickly and carbonation fizzyies and everything that makes a beer pleasant on the palate this beer had it double.  Drinkability; As much as I tried to sip it, the damn thing tastes too terrific. As much as I should slow down the damn thing kicked my ass. So... my only complaint is ... it's now time for bed =)  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,deathonthemounta,4.58,"22oz bombdoggy into 22oz weizen glass  I let the bottle sit outside the fridge for about 15 minutes until a nice budweiser commercial bottle condensation formed. As a pre-emptory comment I'd like to point out that this brew embraces a ""larger"" view of the force.  A -- nice amber red color. Very nice. A red amber, no orange tone is present. Must be filtered. None of that yummy yeast slurry lurking at the bottom.  S -- Hoppy, hoo-ray! A little floral, but expressed with a melon ester character? Who's brew is this?!? Is that melon hop nose legal? I LIKE it.  T -- Really can't nail down the layers and complexity here. A shotgun blast of flavor buzzwords woulnd't do it justice. It's too well balanced. Here's what I came up with during my 22oz journey.  Easy-does-it boozy balance trundles all the way through keeping its end of the bargain until the long reaching end. Deep. Rich. Balanced. Sweet malt, vanilla, spice & i'll just stop right there before I start blathering. ...as it warms and I sip further...is that banana licorice back there about mid way through the quaff? This beer is STELLAR my friend. Way at the end of the flavor march it is almost reminiscent of the Snowcap this year w/a green apple/sour like twinge. It's hard to detect w/ the perfect sweet malty balance. Another 5 degrees F closer to room temp and the sweetness proclaims itself as caramel.  M -- Nice mouthfeel, I would prefer a little more but that would give it less drinkability...  D -- Extraordinary drinkability, especially for the style! I'm half blind and I'm only halfway through.

Excellent lacing.  smell: In one word, Robust! Pear/peach, bubblegum, heavy caramel malt, citrus hoppy and a mellow hint of alcohol.  taste and mouthfeel: long lasting bitter sweet grapefruit aftertaste, slightly necture body(full), noticable fermented fruit undertone w/ a medium blast of alcohol.  drinkability: Easy for us hop heads.

Fruits ranging from plums to some grapefruit all come out. Is more of the grapefruit rind taste than the fruit itself. Nice big bitterness all the way through. Big malt body too. the caramel flavor seems to find its way through all these huge flavors. The aftertaste is made up of the fruits and lingering strong citrus bitterness. Also has the grassy and piney hops in there as well (as well as the taste). That makes for the dry bitterness and finish. M- Full body with low carbonation. D- It is very good. I think I preferred the 2005 (I tried it in 06 so I'm not sure if it's due to it being a year old or they are made in different places). It is a sipper.

Pours a dark amber with reddish gold highlights and a small white head that almost disappears completely...but not quite, leaving a ring of lace. Aroma is (surprise!)...citrus hops but with a touch of caramel an medicinal alcohol. Taste is very hard to describe. I mean, I can say sugary dark malt, bitter, grapefruit hops, followed and almost buried with strong alcohol, but while those are the tastes I interpet, they are not all that is there...not by any means. Maybe it is just the combination that changes them to so much more than merely the individual sensations they are. I don't know. I only know, I really like it. This indeed may be my very favorite Stone Brew of all time. Oh yeah....and the ABV in this one kicks butt...at least it kicks mine...much more than other brews much higher in ABV. --- Enjoying another bottle of this, I decided to return to my review to see if I had missed anything in the past. This is still my definite go to beer when the night has wound down and I'm looking for something strong to finish it off. More than that, it is my go to beer when the evening of drinking has left me wanting....an evening of drain pours...an evening of finding nothing that 'satisfies me', pleases me, finishes it for me. I can return to Double Bastard and have never, ever, been disappointed. The perfect nightcap...the perfect finish...the perfect fill for what I've missed in the past. Great beer&gt;? Maybe not. But dependable satisfaction and extreme pleasure for me. Yep. I'm changing my rating from a 4.9 to a 5 simply because this may be the only beer that has never disappointed me. ...

Pours an unassuming dark brownish-amber with a small but fairly resilient and foamy half-finger of light beige head that falls into a thin hazy lacing over the beer.  Surprisingly light aroma. Very pleasant roasted caramel malt background that gives way to a grapefruit-citrus and piney hops scent.  Not the kick-in-the-ass I was expecting. No, this is definitely not for the faint of heart, as the tirade on the back of the bottle bluntly states in typical Stone fashion, but it is not that overpowering either. Strong grapefruit and piney hops flavors are prevalent with a rich toffee malt background as well, especially as the beer warms. Dry bitter hoppy finish and a nice subtle warming alcohol flavor.  Full-bodied oily but somewhat creamy on the palate. Very drinkable for a beer of this magnitude. I can't wait to try this thing with a few months under its belt when the malt matures.

Taste- OMG, this thing is beautiful, so complex it's hard to describe. Sweetness begins the taste with mild carbonation and an alcohol burn. Hops are left to the aftertaste, citrus from mild grapefruit, and a light floral breath at the end. This sucker is smooth too.  Mouthfeel- Slick and smooth, thick and clingy.  Drinkability- At 10% one is enough but it is so incredibly balanced and complex you want more than one. This is what a DIPA should be. It has it's competitors but may well be the best DIPA in the world IMO.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,LarryV,4.5,"From the 2005 batch. The months of aging have made this beer incredibly well balanced. Pours a lovely deep reddish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet and malty with a hint of hops lurking in the background. Taste is sublime - big malty flavor with the hops nicely balanced. Alchohol is obvious but not distracting. Lots of vanilla in the taste. Absolutely delicious, a beer to sip and savor.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,hoppymeal,4.25,"2005 vintage. Pours dark copper to orange and red with a cream to tan head. You can tell this beer is big from the smell. Smells of rich malts, sweet caramel, some tart cherry/red wine aroma, some pruniness, and alcohol also present in the aroma. Rich sweet malts and caramel are up front and quickly intermingle with strong alcohol presence, a good size, slightly piney, dry bitterness in the finish and then an alcohol warmth in the throat. Great strong ale, the alcohol is definitely a presence but is not too strong to enjoy, but rather balanced by the large malt bill, and the hops are also large and create a nice finish. I look forward to how this ages.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,fisherman34,4.2,"2005 vintage. Tap sample from The Freakin Frog. Brown in colour with hints of amber. Low carbonation. Powerful sweet malt aroma with a nice light hoppy citrus fruit (although not Cascade or Centennial, from what I could tell) overlay. More of the same in the mouth with a bit of an alcohol presence, but what surprised me was the lighter than expected body of this beer. The solid bitterness that kept everything in check too. A very drinkable beer for its size. Well done Stone!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Metalmonk,4.94,"[2004 release]  As with the Double Bastard's cousin Arrogant Bastard, D.B. strikes me as a hybrid of several more easily definable styles, mixing elements of Barleywines, Strong Belgian Dark Ales and Double IPAs. And I ain't complaining...this is the STUFF.  Pours a caramel/amber color crowned with a creamy head that foams like and then forms a light dollop of whipped topping. Modest bubble activity and good-looking but scattered lace.  Smells rich without being overly sweet, lotsa caramel, ripened dark fruits, toffee, grapefruit and...more gooey hot caramel.  Flavors are many--see list of aromas above for the details, and add subtle coffee bean and pineapple to those. Two things impress the most: the insane complexity of the malts and the extremely well-hidden alcohol. The malts here are rich and candy-like without having any kind of cloying sweet-tooth overkill. Just pure pleasure. As for the alcohol %, it doesn't bowl me over with warm vapors the way most 10%+ beers do. This lets those well-balanced flavors breathe and impress. The rich, creamy, velvety feel in the mouth only adds to the huge drinkability and enjoyment factor. [The hops are dialed down in this, compared to a fresh batch (this is a couple years aged); fresher DBs I've had incorporate big pine-like hop character right alongside its other wonderful traits.]  oh man oh man oh man...oh wow. This is a freaking GREAT beer. Period. If we ever have children, the kid's name is Stone. Boy or girl. True dat.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,ampzilla,4.54,"DB is King. Poured dark amber with 1/5 inch head into room temp. Belgian chalice. Smell was over the top. Exceptional aroma of rich malt and hops. Alcohol is not bashful either. This Bastard doesn't knock before he enters. Taste is addictave. Come for the hops, stay for the malt. Or vice versa. Have it your way. Mouth feel is alright. Hops linger on the back of the palate inviting another sip. I would drink this all day if I could. No way at 10% ABV. Bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,joecast,4.27,"2005 bomber. a cousin picked up two bottles when they were released last year. the first one was shared over new years. this one has been tucked away in the cellar since, waiting patiently.  pours a dark clear mahogany crimson color in my favorite kmart mug. head forms slowly over the course fo the 6oz pour. i imagine pouring the entire bomber would have formed a larger head, but this one will suffice. starts out about 1cm, lightly tanned, and settles to just under half its original size. looks like it just sort of compacted as its fairly dense.  fantastic aroma. great mix of hoppy citrus, pine, grapefruit and seriously thick malt, booze and sweetness. i dont like using ""thick"" to describe aromas or flavors but it fits here.  everything just sort of works together and. no, thats not right. it doesnt just sort of work together. its like a well oiled machine. think of one of the all time great sports teams. the lakers of the `80s for instance. each player is like one aspect of the aroma. magic, the malt. kareem, the booze. worthy, the citrus. each one working to make the other, and thus the team, better. thats what this smell is like.  one word to describe the taste? powerful. yup, powerful. each sip is a reminder of the strength, absolute no holds barred domination of this beer over the tastebuds. i pick myself up off the canvas to type a few words between tastes. definitely a sipper.  strong malt presence with booze taking second spot. sharp hop bitterness comes in and throws a few jabs after the malt fades. tough to pick up any hop flavor. id say its pallate fatigue, but im only about 5oz in. more likely its just being pushed aside. sweetens slightly as it warms, but the strength, malt and booze are still there too.  mouthfeel could be a bit more substantial. for how big the taste is, the mouthfeel could use some of that ""bigness"". goes down too light when it could kick your ass so quick.  drinkability? well, i could not imagine having a three liter bottle of this stuff. im glad its only 8pm. gives me plenty of time to finish it off. or it finish me off?? lacerative is quite right.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,3Vandoo,4.38,"Burgundy amberish beer who is quite creamy and thick, beige head that doesnt come off too quickly let itself die slowly.  Smell is quite rich, chocolate, burn coffee aromas, sweet sugars, cherry like flavours come out. Shy hoppy smells, piney come out, but very shy.  In taste, this is quite creamy and rich. One of the tasties creamiest heaviest beer I've had in a long time, so much I couldnt finish a bottle by myself. Rich sugary flavours, with a shy carbonation, well balanced and malted. Very smooth in mouth, balanced between the hops and the malt, quite unusualy for Stone.  Nice!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,GClarkage,4.35,"Stone Double Bastard 2005  05/24/06- Purchased at Ledger's Liquors in Berkeley, CA.  Presentation- 22oz bottle, 2005 version. Poured into my Duvel tulip.  Appearance- Deep copper in color. Brandy-like in color. Pours with a ¾ inch white head. Decent amount remains until the finish. Light streaks and flashes of lacing.  Smell- Mixture of english and american. Heavy pine and fruity hops. On the other hand, lots of booze soaked caramel and butterscotch fruitcake. Nice combo. Even the scent gets you buzzed.  Taste- As expected..a full onslaught of hard hitting hops. Woodsy and piney, fruity and bitter, perfumey and floral. The full spectrum here. Very nice rich caramel malt holds this together the best it can. With the amount of IBU's in this beer, you really can't expect to have a truly balanced beer. But, considering, it's about as balanced as can get. The bitterness last long and into the night.  Mouthfeel- After warming up it gets considerably thicker and viscous. Bitterness I'm sure I will be tasting in the morning. Carbonation is mid range...less as it warms.  Drinkability- My first Double Bastard! Good stuff. I enjoyed it warm and right out of the fridge. Mmmm, hops!  ***2004 Release  Presentation- 22oz bottle, 2004 release. Poured into my Double Bastard tumbler or some other bastardized glass type. Looks like something you would serve a white russian in.  Appearance- Reminds me a lot of the Old Gaurdian I had last night. Light brown and the dark orange side. Almost liquor like (brandy?) About a 1/2 inch head which evaporates soon after. Leaves very mild lace marks.  Smell- A bit more on the malty side with a nice caramel and bubble gum nose. Hops are present, but a bit subdued. Stone...subdued?!?! Yeah, it's been 3 years plus. Mild grapefruit scent from the lupulin.  Taste- Fairly well balanced. Heavy and sweet caramel malted taste with a muted hop assortment. Some grapefruit, a bit of pine and a dash or assorted citrus flavors. Even a hint of black cherry at one point.  Mouthfeel- Smooth, slick and medium carbonation.  Drinkability- Liked it better aged I think. A bit buzzed right now after this and another 12oz 10% plus beer, but overall it was failry well balanced, flavorful and finished well. Boosting the rating a bit, I think...  ***2006 Release  Two years in the cellar has been good to this beer. A full onslaught of both pine and grapefruit hops as well as a nice roasted caramel malt presence. All together very well rounded. Has a noticable alcohol flavor though. At first sip it seems much higher in abv than 10%. It does calm down though and becomes quite a nice beer as it warms. Drink now or hold for another year.  ***2007 Release  This one has had about 4 months in the cellar. Actually, I just bought it...a bit late this year on getting my annual releases. Anyway, this one seems much more balanced right off the mark. Don't get me wrong...this is Stone and hops are king...make that hardcore hops. But the caramel malt comes out much more than in past fresh bottles. Still could use a full year in the cellar (or more), but fairly drinkable right now.  ***2008 Release  Freshly consumed about two weeks after the release date. Furious burning hops and a hefty alcohol presence. Burns going down until the last third of the bottle after it calms down. Not really a hugh bitter aftertaste though, which is odd. Almost has a cherry cough syrup-like taste. Needs at LEAST a year in the cellar for me. Still good 'ol Stone though.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,VoodooBrew,4.5,"Clear chestnut with ruby highlights. Light tan head. Big, bold hopping defines the nose, with evidence of caramel and alcohol hidden in there somewhere. The bitterness in this beer is intense -- big and up-front, grabbing hold of the palate and not letting go. There's a good dose of malt in there too, with some toasty notes, lest this be perceived as a DIPA. It's more like an American Brown Ale on steroids. The Cream AND the Clear. The Double Bastard's bitterness would be on the high end even for a Barleywine, but it doesn't have the body and residual sweetness of a BW. Still, my 22 oz. bomber provided over an hour and a half's worth of drinking enjoyment.  DB is big, bold, immensely satisfying, and all the other things you'd expect from Stone.

There was an abundance of floral, citrus hops in the nose, with the heavy sweetness of malt brining up the rear.  T - Its an all-around collision of flavors going on here. The thing is that they were all balanced very nicely.  M - Heavy and smoth, There was no slickness, or an overly strong carbination bite going on. it was nice.  D - For the style it is an excellent example. But one of these a night is enough for me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,johnniemarg,4.02,"22oz bomber poured into a pint glass. Pours a ruby/amber with a yellow-ish half inch of head. I don't get any lacing whatsoever.  This smells very good. First thing I notice is a sweet cherry smell and then some caramel malt, spicy hops and finally alcohol. The sweet fruity cherry smell is much stronger than any of the other smells.  The sweetness in the smell barely comes through in the taste at first. My first thought after sipping this is that the alcohol is too overpowering....I sat back and let it warm a bit because I think it might have been too cold....It is indeed much better after it warms a bit. The sweet, matly cherry flavor hits your tongue first, then the hops come on strong and you finish with a mouthfull of alcohol. The hops combined with the high alcohol content give this brew an astringet quality if it's too cold, but this goes away as the beer warms.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and oily. The alcohol is warming in the mouth and all the way down into the stomach.  This is a good beer, but it truly is an assault on the taste buds.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Enjoed with a friend from a bomber into oversized wine glasses where the beer was allowed to breath and let loose it's bonanza of different fruity and hoppy scents. A strong and alcoholic brew, every part of this beer is extreme, finishing with mouth watering hops. Creamy mouthfeel, I wonder if the glassware had any part in it.

Not being a hop monster guy, how I was surprised that thisone was not as I thought. It pours a good looking reddish mahogany with a tan like head that maintained about a half inch. Lace was spotted. The aroma has a pine hop and alcohol hew. The taste is what shows-off this beers complex nature. The taste of pine, citric rind and hop that is well balanced with a roasted malt and alcohol spice background. The alcohol warms as its aided by a 10% showing. The beer is not so much Arrogant, but very very drinkable.

Aroma -initially some citrusy zest on the pour with some sweet fruity and boozy essences. Fades a bit after a minute but still picking some of it up.  Taste - prickly hops right out of the gate. Sweetness and alcohol quickly envelope everything, but a few moments later the hops burn back through, dry and bitter, Not as much floral to this aged bottle but still plenty of bite. Alcohol is not hidden but is well-integrated. Improves significantly as it warms, more fruit and brown sugar flavor coming through, providing some much needed depth.  Mouthfeel - smooth, good weight to it, and the carbonation picks up the beer well, giving it some spiciness.

Subsequent sniffs are not as neck snapping, with malty and hoppy scents coming through (don't be off-put initially-just brace yourself for an experience), The taste is sweet and bitter at the same time.

147,1056,rajendra82,4.15,"2004 Release  Its been nearly a year and a half since I acquired this bomber via trade, and I read today that this beer tastes best at this age. My palette has evolved quite a bit since the last time I tried this one. It is time to find out if this beer has undergone some evolution as well.  The beer came out the traditional color of barleywine, which to me is burgundy with a touch of orange. The first pour was clear, and had a one finger thick head with remarkable staying power. Carbonation in the underlying beer was gentle looking but steady. The aroma was multilayered malts with vanilla, hazelnut, toffee, and chocolate. Not many hops were detectable using the nose. The taste was amazingly complex as well. Flavors of chocolate, oak, black pepper, raisins, and mandarin orange were found in each sip. The mouthfeel however was a little pricklier than I remembered. Radiating warmth was felt in the belly, letting the alcoholic strength numb away all angst about letting this sit in a warmer than recommended cellaring closet. I can see this one going a few more years along the ascending path. Unfortunately no more bottles are left in the cellar to test the theory. Time for a Chattanooga beer run soon I think.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Smell is sweet, and malty...some brown sugar or molasses, bits of vanilla, alcohol and a slight hop presence.  Taste is big and malty. Lots of caramel malt, molasses notes. The finish has a nice lingering hop bitterness, with an evident alcohol bite.  Medium bodied, almost syrupy. Coats all the way down.

Its greatest strength is its range of flavors that are in addition to the very deep hoppiness that seem to characterize all of Stone's brews. I get the flavors of caramel, grapefruit, molasses, alcohol, and even chocolate. It is just a wonderfully intense and delicous brew. The one criticism, and this is in the context of it being one of my favorite American beers, is that, while each sip indivually goes down very smoothly, it is difficult to keep drinking this for a while.

The smell surprisingly mild and sweet well, its not really mild but I was expecting an Arrogant Bastard on steroids, but smells like they didnt go for a ridiculously big beer, like many brewers tend to do. Wonderful aromas of fruity and piney hops and smooth roasted malts. The taste is. Oh wow, its big and delicious! Huge flavors of piney hops and caramel malts, but what sets apart from the other and makes it superior is the excellent balance. It has a full body, oily, slightly syrupy texture and soft carbonation. Perfect mouthfeel for the big-beer experience. This beer goes down wickedly easy for as strong as it is. Its liquid crack.

I mean, I like alcohol and I like hops, but there ought be malt somewhere in a brew this strong. The taste followed the nose, but rather than merely being unpleasant it was downright offensive. Incredibly hot alcohol followed by numbing hops. Why? The mouthfeel is paper thin, not completely out of place given the rest of the brew, but by no means pleasant.  I was told this brew would turn me around regarding Stone . . . instead, it has done to opposite. If I had to choose between this beer and BMC, I'd say that BMC lite ice wins.

The nose smells half rotted and burnt sugar spritzed. Faint hop florality but covered in sickening sugar tones. I see where cardboard phrasing comes from.  Taste is burried in grainy sugar tones that make me want to vomit. Burnt brown sugar on top of rot. Somewhat alcoholic and maybe bitter, but the sickening sweetness is just too much for me. Horrid. Initially, I tought the age of this brew might have caused this super malted diseased flavour, but now I am not so sure.  Mouthfeel is medium to heavy. It approaches chewy at times.  Drinkability is not good. This tastes like dirty feet. This is some nasty, cloying, grit peppered waste. I thought this was the new one.

147,1056,wingnutter,4.15,"Popped the top when the brew was at about 50 degrees or so. Poured into a pint glass. Great clear amber with a one finger head that disappears and leaves a thin film on top. Smells sweet and malty, and hoppy as well, with some floral/citrus notes. A smidgen of alcohol is lurking in there, just to let you know its there. Beautiful nose - theres alot going on here.  Taste: Ummmm - WOW. For such a strong tasting brew, this badboy is SMOOTH. Sweetness hits my tongue first, with hops at the finish. Alcohol is present but not distracting in the least bit. Just a bit of warmth in the back of the throat after a swallow. Slick mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to keep it from feeling sticky.  Taste is complex with malts, a slight sugary sweetness that doesnt even come close to cloying, some citrusy notes, and bitter hops. This beer isnt as in-your-face (taste wise) as its little brother, Arrogant Bastard. I thought the AB had a more aggressive taste. This one comes across as more refined and more organized. That said, this is one tasty brew. Near the end of the pint, I notice almost no lacing whatsoever. Maybe the glass wasnt totally clean, Im not sure. I figured there would be more lacing. Dark, ripe fruit has now made an appearance in the taste. This is unexpected and quite nice. Im Almost a bit disappointed that this beer isnt as extreme in the taste department as the AB. Not that its not a fantastic beer, but I just expected a bit more arrogance out of this one. It almost has a porter feel to it now.  After trying both AB and DB within 3 days of each other, I must say I prefer the AB. Not because its not as strong abv-wise, but because the taste is more raw, untamed and just plain out of control. The AB made my tongue feel like it ran a marathon, where the DB made it feel like it jogged around the block.  A great beer, and worthy of such a high rating, but the black sheep of the family, Arrogant Bastard, and NOT Double Bastard, should hold the title of most arrogant between the two.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,danielocean03,4.43,"Poured from a 22oz. bomber marked 2005 release into a pint glass. I loved the warning and paragraph denouncing ""pedestrian products"" and on the bottle's backside. Pours a crystal clear, beautiful dark cherry color with full finger foamy off white head that slowly gave way to moderate lacing. Looks absolutely incredible, very impressive and pleasing to the eye. Aroma is rich with a mixture of a malty sweetness accompanied by a nose stinging burn of alcohol, which is nicely complemented by well balanced hops. Taste is complex, yet to the point with the everpresence of unhidden alcohol, I've had many beers in the 9-10% abv range and none have been this bold in that respect. Not to the point of being overpowering, simply a somewhat constant reminder of it's presence. Flavors of caramel malt and evergreen/pine hops take the lead, with undertones of dried fruit-like sweetness that blends well with the complexity of this brew. Mouthfeel is medium in body, passes quickly and leaves a slick coat in the mouth. Carbonation fairly minimal, matches well with the complex characteristics of this beer. Drinkability high for the smooth, easy yet aggressive stature of this ale, takes a slight hit for higher ABV, wouldn't want to drunken the palate and waste any of this incredible brew. Will definitely seek out again in the future.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

S: Malt sweetness with fruit and vanilla pulling through, along with a hint of wood. You could bury your nose in this for a while and never get tired of it.  T: Exeptional. SLightly sweet at first and then just dives into the bitterness from the hops. The bitterness lasts and lasts. I love it.

Tasted of sweet mellow fruits like cherries, plumbs and raisins and caramelized sugar malts with a crisp piney hop that dragged on into a pungently dry finish.

147,1056,gbarron,3.73,"2005 edition from a 22 oz. bomber.  A - perfectly clear ruby. A small head forms with some assistance from a loud pour into my pint glass. Head quickly dissipates, leaving no brussels lace. By the time I'm almost done with this beer there is no head present whatsoever.  S - I'm smelling mainly malt here. Sugary, bready smells. Toasted malt evident. Some citrusy, resiny hop aroma in there, but malt comes through the most. Some vanilla notes as well. Not a whole lot of aroma considering the size of the beer.  T - this is a big beer. Sweet malt, toasty flavors hit the tongue first, but then here come the hops. Bitterness overwhelms the initial sweetness. Lots of hops. Not sure what these hops are, but I'd guess they are of the American NW variety - Cascade, Centennial, Mt. Hood, etc. Lots of citrusy, grassy, resiny hop flavor here. Then there are the alcohol flavors - some estery phenolics. The alcohol is not overwhelming, but definitely present. Lots of esters.  M - a medium to thick bodied beer. Sticks to your tongue a bit, but it's not all due to the syrupy malt - it feels like some is from the resiny hops. Low to medium low carbonation.  D - well, certainly a beer I will never turn down and will be happy to drink, but I don't think I could drink more than a couple of these in one night. It's a very big beer that will stay with you, plus there is the alcohol factor.  Overall - this is a very good beer, but I'm a little surprised about the high ratings. Basically this seems like a very good big American strong ale/barleywine. I had heard a lot about this beer, but I was a little let down. The alcohol and malty sweetness, combined with the huge amount of IBU's is almost a little cloying. When a beer is this big, I start wondering about what flaws the super-malt and hops content is covering up.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

There are a few random bubbles of carbonation that rise to the surface.  S- The smell of fresh crushed pineapple is strong in this one. There is a green floral hop aroma in the finish with some crystal malt flavoring as well.  T- This beer has a big juicy hop flavor with citrus, pineapple, resin and notes of green grass in the taste. The hops are so big that I taste a kind of dark earthy hop flavor that I have never tasted before. There is a bitter hop finish with a alcohol flavor that boost the hop bitterness and the hop flavor alike. There are flavors of crystal malt with notes of darker caramel malt that start to come through as it warms a bit.  M- This beer has a medium-full mouthfeel with a creamy texture. There is a nice smooth alcohol warmth in the finish.  D- This is not a session beer. The hops are big and dark like a black storm cloud that has just opened up. The alcohol and toasted malts only enhance the big crazy hops. Even when I exhale after each sip the flavor of citrus, pineapple, and bitter hops hang on my breath.

Nose is of sweet malts, dark fruits, and alcohol. Taste is of dark fruits, candied sugar, sweet malts, and an alcohol warming finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and full. Overall drinkability is pretty good but this is the only one you want to enjoy unless you plan on getting 'faced. Original rating is 4.27.  Re-review 11-27-15:  This beer is not much of a looker but the nose is boozy with some northwest hops and some dark fruits. Taste is citrus and pine that is trying to overtake the malt base but actually balances pretty well in the end. Gotta love the full and creamy feel!

147,1056,charlatan,3.66,"Was pleasantly surprised to find this on tap at the Horse Brass in Portland.  The smoke in the air rendered any sniff test useless but I was impressed by the beer's dark, dark red appearance. It would perhaps be most instructive to compare this to the now ubiquitous Arrogant Bastard: I noticed more of a berry flavour than with AB, and despite the presence of a disturbing amount of alcohol it seemed a little smoother and just as drinkable. The impression I gained was less roughage, more alcohol. However the alcohol was not so apparent that it ruined the beer which was extremely easy to drain. Fortunately I realised how hammered 20 fluid ounces had made me and didn't risk any more. This is not for the faint of heart.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Thin but persistent curls of lacing are left behind.  I've been waiting to sample this one for a long time, but really haven't been sure what to expect other than 'one lacerative mother of a beer'...  The nose surprises me at once, very sweet and fruity and light; I expected evil hop resin scents to reach out and beat me up a bit. Lots of honeyish notes, biscuit, and if you really get your nose in there, rising swirls of rummy alcohol.  Wow, very smooth on the palate! Lots of alcohol, but it's presented well - it's made into a centerpoint of the beer, and the warmth and flavor of it burn a trail all the way down. Surrounding that tight, rummy love are surprisingly smooth flavors - a little honey, some more wheat and oat notes, and a lot of tart fruity esters. Lots of esters. (I love sounding like I know what I'm talking about) Mostly, lots of alcohol. This is like drinking tasty spirits.  Pretty slick, light carbonation, which is proper; Medium-full body, clean finish except for the lingering caramel burn of alcohol.  For what this beer is, it's nice and drinkable...

It had a beautiful reddish-amber body with a thin but foamy slightly tan head. the head left excellent lacing about the glasses. The aroma and tastes were both incredible complex; dark fruits(maybe sour cherries), sweet malts, yeasts, piney hops, possible candy sugars, vanilla and apple rounded out the nose, while the taste was dominated at first by honey, vanilla, bitter piney hops, alcohol, and sweet malts, which faded into a smooth subtle sweet aftertaste. I'm sure theres plenty I'm missing, but I'm still working on my palate! The mouthfeel starts off as a sweet punch balanced by a bitter hoppiness, which fades into a smooth, creamy feel with mild carbonation throughout.

I am not sure of the complete heritage of this bottle, but I believe it is a 2004 release that I picked up several months ago, and I let it sit some more. So since the '05 is out now, I'll call this aged one year.  As I drank this (over 2 hours, not 25 minutes like the previous reviewer!), all I could think about was how rich and complex this baby is. Fresh the hops are very strong and powerful, but this year old version has mellowed out to where the rich, thick creamy malts are the dominant character. I am not a drinker of whiskeys (or whiskys) but this reminded me of the smoky rich full malts of a late nightcap. The alcohol is definitely there, but not in a bad way.

Aroma & taste are huge caramel malt with an earthy malt sweetness & complexity that is second to none..the big hops are buried under layers upon layers of malt complexity. To be honest, I think this could use a lot more hop character to balance it out, as the malts may be as big as any beer I've sampled. The alcohol is fairly obvious, but it blends in fairly well with the multitude of flavors this bad ass brew throws at you.

Pine needles and alcohol with a spicy cinnamon like sting in the nostrils. Taste is equally complex...again similar to a barleywine but with a different, more pronounced hop profile. Spicy, fruity hops with an agreeable alcohol presence. Big mouthfeel with noticable carbonation and a sharp lingering bitterness. Very warming.  This is one powerful beverage. It seems to get better as you drink it...more hops and more complexity. Spicy, hoppy, thick...did I mention complex? Definately a sipping brew.

Clear and ruby-like. Enticingly demoniacal glow. Nice creamy tan head, not so much as far as rentention or lacing. Once you stick your nose in the glass things get out of control. A ton of different aromas here. Cherry, pine, caramel, alcohol (in a good way), a splash of grapefruit citrus, green apple, and maybe some molasses. Taste is huge. Malty back but increasing awesome hops as it warms. Caramel malts are more present in taste than nose. Roasty, sweet and definitely spicey. A lot of pinee arthy and purple fruit hops. Apple and grapefruit rind as well. Greatly complex and balenced, yet in your face. Very nice alcohol warming on the tongue and throat. Smooth + syrupy mouth with perfect carbonation. Very drinkable for 10%. The alcohol presence adds another nice dimension to this brew.  Awesome. I will ""Double the Bastard. Bastard the Double"" as it says on the 05 release.

Aroma is bold, sharp, and complex. Big malts, Big hops. Boiled toffee and molasses aromas are balanced by an exuberant hoppiness of pine and citrus. Mouthfeel is full bodied, with a somewhat syrupy, but smooth, barleywine feel. Taste is bold, but well balanced. Huge hops, huge maltiness. Toffee and molasses front a malty overload, balanced beautifully by pink grapefruit and spruce pine hoppy bitterness. Some alcohol warmth adds to a barleywine character that seems somewhere between an English, and American style. Absolutely incredible that this ""biggun"" has such wonderful drinkability. After enjoying my first fresh bomber of the 2005, I was hoping to cellar the other two. Alas, it's just so tasty and drinkable that I couldn't resist making trips to the cellar to drink the other two bottles over a two week period. Very much like an Arrogant Bastard on steroids.

Initially smelled of orange peel and pineapple but these scents faded in proportion to the amount that I drank. Taste was excellent with the right balance of hops and malts. As the beer warmed, the hops became secondary and a bock-like malt flavor emerged. Mouthfeel was nice with a sweet taste in the front which was quickly followed by a bitter hop finish.

147,1056,orfeu,4.72,"Review #40. Big ups to my brother in law for scoring two bombers of the 2005 release for me from Tucson when, as far as I know, this limited production vintage has yet to make it to upstate New York.  Brown-garnet with active carbonation and bubbly head that rapidly becomes a mere wisp of a cap (barely) and collar -- in fact, it kinda bubbles away as quickly as the head on a cola. Aroma is vanilla, cherry, figs, and dates. Peach and anise. No hops whatsoever (?!?). First sip is sweet cherry vanilla malts with the faintest hint of floral piney hops. Pretty boozy -- the 10% ABV numbs my tongue and warms my gullet damn near immediately. Surprisingly low bitterness for what I've come to expect from Stone. Sort of a let down as I was expecting a bitter hop blast on top of a massive malt assault, like an Arrogant Bastard whose nipples have just been tweaked. It's delicious nonetheless; just not what I expected -- my own obstacle to overcome, I guess. Halfway through the first glass (oversized wine goblet), the citrus and pine hops show themselves a bit more; also, the head is completely MIA. Thin to medium body. Slick and oily mouthfeel with a buzzing alcohol heat on the tongue. Mouthfeel is probably the weakest aspect. The taste is fan-freekin-tastic, though, and for 10% ABV, this is one dangerous mofo of a BARLEYWINE (not an ""American Strong Ale""). Ridiculously so, in fact. A great choice for getting dumb with at an appropriate celebratory occasion.  At first this tasted too sweet to me, but I think it's actually quite artfully balanced. The malts are just more prominent in this gigantic beer. It's a superior drinking experience fresh, but I'm gonna lock my other bottle away for a year to see if this will meld, change, become creamier...something.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Okay, I'm going on record as one of the few hopheads who craves over-the-top bitterness and laughs at a need for balance, to not fall in love with this beer. It's very good but a rough, medicinal malt profile ruins it for anything that would make this exceptional. It looks good- deep, dark brick red, good size head for the high abv. Pine, floral and grapefruit hops in front of caramel and toffee malts make up the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, good carbonation and it's a lot easier to drink then it should be. You get what you smell in the taste, with the addition of the unfortunate medicinal flavor, the keeps this from being an amazing brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,whartontallboy,3.65,"2004 bottling. I tried this one in January 2005 and it was still a little wild for me, so I thought I'd see if I could settle it down some.  Pours out a brilliant orange-brown with red highlights, clear with an orange-ish head of big bubbles that rises several inches then slowly fades away to nothing.  Smell is an interesting blend of fruity maltiness and alcohol. There's definitely a big fruit scent, with peach, strawberry, plum, cherry, even kiwi coming through in it, but the alcohol is also quite strong.  Flavor is interesting; it hasn't calmed down that much since last year: it's still an abrasive wall of alcohol that strongly bites your gums and tongue. Make no doubt about that. However, a slightly mellowed hop flavor comes through for a little bit of piney bite, but the alcohol and the malt/fruity sweetness comes through as well. It's moderately complex, but there's also a serious problem with the front end being so, well, grating. If that could mellow out, I'd rate it higher.  The mouthfeel is medium and well-carbonated, slightly creamy.  Overall: This one's not bad, but I still feel the alcohol is a bit too in-your-face to warrant really high marks. I don't know if I'll try it again, but I love supporting Stone's other brews.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Pours a clear ruby red with a tan colored head of foam. Head falls to islands and a ring, with decent enough lacing. Carbonation looks steady. A pretty beer!  Aroma is HUGE fruit and caramel, with giant amounts of floral/spicy hops. Notes of dark cherries, dates, figs, prunes. Some sweet solvent, but pleasant. There is a ton of stuff happening in there.  First flavor is (WOW!) huge dark caramel/Munich malts, followed instantly by a big dose of hop bitterness. Warm heat is next, indicating a big alcohol presence. Fruits are here, like cherries, dates, and plums/prunes. (All prunes are plums, but not all plums are prunes!). For as huge as this beer is, it definitely works. Aftertaste is sweet, bitter, warm, and caramelly.  Mouthfeel is a huge body, smooth and creamy for its size, with an oily feel on the tongue. The back of my throat is under attack from hops and alcohol. Finish is very long, sticky sweet, and warm.  Well, this is certainly an incredible beer.

Huge caramel malt presence with a ton of piney hops. Very well-balanced, well-hidden alcohol. Whether you love hops or malt, this beer will suit your tastes. Very complex, but easy to appreciate.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated, and not heavy despite the high ABV. Goes down way too easy!  Drinkability: Again, for a 10% brew, this one goes down easy and smooth. I could easily have another one.  This has got to be one of my 3 favorite beers. Huge malts, big hops and a nice alcohol bite.

The head stood up massively white fluffy; however the head quickly retreated into a brief foam around the beer.  Smell: This beer is arrogantly hopped and spicy. There is a tiny malty undertone. There has alot of alcohol in the smell.  Taste: Gods of all beers. This beer is very coarse in its spicy hoppyness. There is a carmel undertone to the beer. Did I mention the coarseness of the spicy hops. I love it!  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is the mother of all full bodied beers. I tried this beer almost six months ago and hated it.

147,1056,arguemaniac,4.2,"At the outset I should mention that this bottle has been sitting in my beer celler for about a year now, which may have mellowed this brew out a bit (though that may not be the worse thing in the world with a Stone brew).  The liquid pours thick and oily, with a deep ruby color that includes copper, dark brown, and mohogany highlights. The light orange head was nice but didnt last. The aroma is pretty powerful, featuring sugary alcohol, piney hops, and some otherwise sweet malt. The taste of this packs quite a complex punch as well: piney, acidic hop bitterness, dark fruit sweetness, some definate roasted characteristics, brown rum and molassas and, most noticably, a fairly fierce alcohol bite. The mouthfeel is very thick, but also quite smooth with active carbonation (especially for a beer that has been aged this long).  Wow, what a powerful brew. Despite the punch it packs, its still somehow very smooth and quite delicious, not to mention complex, even the color is multifaceted! Man, though, Im worn out and I havent even finished two-thirds of the bottle. Highly, highly recommended.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,mentor,3.7,"Complex, but abrasive and disjointed. Liquid Jimi Hendrix. If you are into dissonance and the inter-play of edgy reverb on edgy reverb, then this beer is for you. IMO, this beer needs alot of time for any chance at sorting itself out.  Fresh 2005 release pours a half finger tan head over a mildly cloudy brown/rust-copper liquid. Smells lemony hops with supporting undertones of grapefruit pith and tangerine. Some caramel malt sweet and way beneath is alcohol. Taste is potent hops that make the malt seem like soured caramel. Hops are co-humulone rough and bitterness is high. The hop flavor is woody and dry. Oranges. Pine and pith. Malt is way beneath and comes across as powery caramel with a hint of nutty that borders on chocolate. The aftertaste is cottony with an alcoholic umph that further denegrates the malt flavor. With searching, I find an ester array, but I can't identify specifics under the brutality of the hops. As I drink further, the alcohol stands out much stronger and is really wearing. The hops are wearing, this beer is not enjoyable. Yes, I can see this beer as properly being classified as an ASA. It definitely needs aging. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy thick. A nice feature that is hard to concentrate on under the hops and alcohol, which are now coming across as cheap vodka poured into my beer.

Taste to me is just about perfect, smooth for a 10 percenter but still with enough alcohol spiciness to remind you of what you are dealing with. Extremely complex in flavor, every sip you detect something else...citrusy and spicy in the beginning but as it warmed (and me) the malts really started to shine leaving a lip smacking sweetness for an aftertaste. mouthfeel is on the syruppy side and drinkability is somewhat low due to the high ABV and pricetag.

Poured into my oversized wine glass a clear amber with with a nice fluffy 3/4 inch head which didn't stay around long but left sticky lacing on the glass. Some carbonation in the body but mostly all the activity was up top. Beautiful. A really large bouqet: tons of malt, estery qualities, caramel, pine, alcohol, and biscuity... really just so much going on that it tickles the nose. The taste really lives up to the promise in the bouquet. This is just one flavorful monster. Sweet and malty backbone, with notes of currant, oak, vanilla and a good blast of hops on the finish, which serve to give it excellent balance. Alcohol is perceptible for sure, but it is very well integrated and never really dominates. This brew has plenty of body. Resiny, creamy and slick, it's a strong ale (barleywine?) that leaves nothing to be desired. I'm not sure how much of this i could drink in one sitting, but i know i could drink a bomber a day it's so damn good. Worth every penny of the $4.99 i paid for the 22oz. and i most certainly will go in for a case of this stuff. I would give it a perfect score if not for my murky interpretation of ""drinkibilty"".

I've always enjoyed it in the past and found it to be incredibly consistent.  Poured into a tulip it takes an aggressive pour to get the full effect but it eventually has a late forming on finger head that is off white to light tan. Eventually the head falls to a big island in the middle. Copper with red around the edges. sticky lacing.  Negatives: My liver enjoys this beer too.  Whoa Baby! The nose is overpowered and sent into submission on the first whiff. PINEY!! Intense alcohol but smoothed out by a nice mix of settling malts and some light fruity aroma.  Hops are the driving force and the profile is so amazingly put together that it is actually a very smooth and drinkable beer. Rich and sweet to the point of being candied. Light citrusy fruits splash around followed by the alcohol burst, and of course all this time it can not escape the hop crunch. Toasted bread as well. Could this beer be any more well rounded.

Mouthfeel is syrupy, oily and thick.  Drinkability is head and shoulders above almost any other beer in this class. I have no trouble finishing the whole bomber alone.

Has a bit of an aftertaste, which is probably due to the high alcohol (10%). I bet this could go well with some hard cheese and wheat crackers. I'd say it's not as malty as the regular bastard; this one is more creamy.  Like a good wine, I found this opened up after a few minutes.

Balanced. Malty finish followed up by pleasant bitter aftertaste. A slight hint of something -- cherries? -- in the aftertaste, too. Mouthfeel was like liquid bread, encouraged me to savor this brew in a manner befitting its ABV. Drinkability was good for ABV. Alcohol not as overpowering and beer not as bitter as I'd expected.  All in all, a beer I can now say I love. Unfortunately, it's pretty tough to get in Seattle this year (the distributor only got 25% what they got last year!) so I won't be drinking much.

147,1056,jonnylieberman,4.25,"Once again -- the Double Bastard -- 2005 release  Poured from a bomber into a tulip.  Looks: A very good looking beer -- the deepest orange, with reds and browns poking through. Off-white nearly tan head about two fingaz high, recedinging into decent (though by nomeans great) lacing.  Smeels like: Pine and malt and big citrus and, well, frankly, it smells like really good beer. There is enough alcohol present in the nose to cut any sweetness and balance the beer out.  Taste: I said the smell was balanced; not the taste. Double Bastard has essentially the best bittering you are going to find in any commercial beer. This is not the ""smooth"" bitterness that so many DIPA newbies claim to want -- this is the rough-hewn stuff of legends. Within the first sip, your mouth knows full well who exactly is in charge.  The malts are succulent and sweet enough (think plums and figs rather than berries and tropical) but this is a hop foreward brew. Again, the alcohol cuts in and makes itself known, but there is no ""hotness."" The hops though, are really about as good as it gets. I think in a year's time, I would be rating this beer even higher.  Mouthfeel: The harshness of the hops does interfere with the swallow. That, and for a Strong Ale (this is a barleywine, Bros) I would like things a bit thicker. Still, I love it.  Overall: A longtime favorite that I have neglected for too long.

I'm sure with how wickedly potent this is in terms of hot booze and hops it could remain brash after a decade.  Comes out of the bottle a cherry-hued amber. An ivory sea-foam head politely rests atop the glowing DB, leaving the faintest lines of lace.  For how brash this beer is, the nose really doesn't reflect its intensity. Somewhat subtle; slight hints of licorice, dough, baker's yeast, cherries, paste, a metallic twinge.  This is astonishingly 'big' in flavor though. Many of the aromas hinted at were nowhere to be found on the palate, most of which I noticed had directly to do with ethyl alcohol. Hot shots of hop-vodka. Watermelon and cranberry hints are there too, but below the caustic hop and booze attack.  Like biting into a live wire...high-voltage shocks of alcohol and hop cones.

147,1056,OldSock,4.05,"Appearance  I decided to celebrate having tomorrow off and my 100th review by drinking this bomber, dated 2004, which I recently picked up at Lukes. Poured into my snifter it is hazy dark red/brown beer with a one finger off-white head. Good spotty lacing, but poor retention.  Smell  Even at a year old this still has a lot of hops, slightly resinous pine for the most part. Definite alcohol presence as well along with some sweet toasted malt. This has calmed down a good deal since my last bottle of 04 last December.  Taste  Sweet toasted malt balanced by piney hop bitterness, a classic combination on steroids. While the flavor is big it is close to balanced, but the bitterness still has an edge to it that lingers. The alcohol is slightly fusel and warming, but definitely not as powerful as it was when the beer was fresh. Good flavor, but it doesnt have the complexity that I have come to expect from big beers.  Mouthfeel  Completely full with medium carbonation.  Drinkability & Notes  Tasty beer, could have used a few more months, but good as is. The last time I had this beer I was still early in the craft beer life, I found 1/3 of a bottle nearly undrinkable, judging from my opinion tonight either I or the beer have come quite a long way.

147,1056,veggiemafia,4.55,"Poured from a bomber into an imperial pint.  This beer is pretty pretty pretty. Dark red with some gold, if a paint company made Double Bastard Red, I'd repaint my kitchen. With a moderately hard pour this produced a one-finger off-white head, and lace hung around for the entire time I was drinking this one (granted there was a repour when I added the rest of the bomber to the 4 or 5 ozs. in my glass). But still, for a 10% abv. beer this lacing hung around for a really long time.  Smell is very sweet with vinous notes, as well as fruity stuff going on like in a really good Belgian strong dark ale. That said, there are a lot of really refreshing hops in this too. Also, a ton of alcohol in the nose too. Very vinous alcohol presence. But it doesn't detract from the wonderful aroma of this one at all.  Sweet merciful crap, this is very sweet upfront, and very bitter in the finish. Literally perfect balance of hops, malt and alcohol. Every element of the taste of this beer only serves to enhance the other. The taste is a little intimidating at the beginning of the bottle, but after the first couple of sips, it's really just wonderful. Very fruity and sweet, but backed with really big bitter, but refreshing hop presence.  Mouthfeel is perfect, heavy and substantial, but still really pleasant and refreshing.  This is too drinkable, I haven't yet finished my bomber, and I'm very much tipsy (almost just typed ""tupsy,"" for example and I'm having to use the backspace button way more often than I do normally). But I still really do want more. Any beer that makes you want to drink more despite the fact that you're alone and tipsy is just too drinkable. It's not sessionable for this reason, and also, it's bitter and huge enough that if I had a kolsch right now, I don't know that I'd be able to taste anything. This really does kind of destroy your palate for awhile.  But geez, it's worth it.

147,1056,pjwilson,3.43,"When I tried Double Bastard in Nov. of 2004. I was just getting into American craft ale. I had liked Belgians before then but was still a little hesitant about IPA's. (too strong) This beer was a turning point for me then: I really loved it and thought it was the most crazy, strongest beer I had ever had. In 12 months time I have drank so much craft brew, gotten into to crazy hoppy beers, and the IPA become my favorite style. (but I still love me them Belgians) Upon tasting the 2005 version one of three things has happened. 1. My palette has changed so much that this isn't even that hoppy at all. 2. They changed the recipe a lot. 3. I just spent the weekend at the toronado wet hop fest and ""balanced"" beers will never taste hoppy again. The rant on the back really seems uncalled for. This is a nice mellow barely wine with a bit of hop bite. I really am enjoying it but am surprised by how mellow it is, both my memory and by the rant on the bottle. That, and all the hype that there was a shortage and Bev mo has 20 cases of the stuff...worried for nothing. Anyways I think it's a combo of 1,2 and 3 for me. This beer will be now be reviewed on if I had drank it for the first time. appearance: poured into a tulip glass, double bastard is red, blood red, but much more transparent than red wine. still it's pretty thick and the head lasts pretty long for a beer of this strength. smell: alcohol dominates for me. work a little harder and I smell some nice malts. good for style i suppose. taste: first taste was a shock how smooth it was, not how crazy. But it's good. Reminds me of cognac. I think Arrogant is hoppier than this one. The alcohol is dominant again....which gets more and more cloying. The beer is not sweet, nor is it hoppy. Ok there is some sweetness, but it is drowed by alcohol. VERY, alcoholic tasting. mouthfeel: is quite watery. drinkability: I have to be honest and say that this beer is getting on my nerves. Once a year is plenty. Well I'm glad I had a bottle, but that Jubale in my fridge is actually sounding more fun than the rest of this bottle. I know that this beer has been changed in BA from a Double IPA, to an American Barleywine, to an American Strong Ale. I'd like to say in my mind it's almost a Winter Warmer, yes strong enough to be a barleywine.

147,1056,Bcant,4.48,"2005 Edition  22oz brown bomber bottle. I once had a pair of oxblood Doc Martins, this beer is the color my shoes should have been. Excellent deep red-brown with a cream head. Once I drank it down a bit I gave it a good swirl and it were a scotch youd say it had long legs. Understated bouquet of mild potpourri. All modesty is thrown out the window with the first sip. Starts with a caramel/condensed sweetness followed by aggressive piney hops with coconut notes. Finishes deep and long, retuning to the creaminess reveled first. Defiantly a good brew to let get warm, as different temps reveal additional dimensions to the flavor. Very soft and viscous; easily palatable yet with strong character. Remarkable un-alcoholic in the mouth (your head feels it) and refreshing without being overly moist.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Smell is of tons of malt, hops, along with some oaky vanilla going on. Taste is of the same aromas. Very nice and hard to put into words. All I know is that I like it. Mouthfeel is super smooth with a sweetness that comes through.

147,1056,PatYoda,3.35,"'04 version.  Appearance is ok. Pours a beautiful mahogany with no head after a minute. Smell is a little underwhelming. Maple syrup, some citrus fruit, and pine needles are all there in small quantities, but the alcohol makes a bit too much of an appearance in my opinion. It's also got an unpleasant oxidized smell. Taste is interesting, but not up to some of the better barleywines I've had. Everything in the smell makes an appearance, though I can't taste the wet paper oxidized smell at least. Here I can say that if the alcohol was not so apparent, this would be a great beer. Malt and hops are very well balanced. There is a nice piney aftertaste and a nice deep sweet fruity taste. But after that the alcohol overwhelms you, and the aftertaste leaves you thinking you just took a tiny shot of some cheap rum. The mouthfeel is nice, very smooth and medium bodied for a barleywine. Drinkability suffers due to the alcohol, but still isn't bad. Just doesn't have enough flavor to mask the alcohol in my opinion. This is exactly why I recently changed my favorite style from American Barleywine. There's so much better beer out there.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Wonderfully ""fuelled"", bitter and candied beer. Great malts bathing in chocolate with it and a enormous bitter and roastyness follow and stay in aftertaste together with the burning alcohol. Yes this is a great beer and has mouthfeel like used up motoroil; creamy and burnt but still somehow fresh.

147,1056,waldowin,4.25,"2004 Release  Pours a dark, dark ruby, with a large white head that slooowly fades to just a thin veil. Very murky depths, almost loch ness monster territory.  Smells *very* strongly of malts, and some oak, with a hop tang.  Tastes about as malty of a barleywine as I've had. Light and dark malts blend at the tip of your tongue, giving way to a wave of hops halfway through (not as strong as I expected from Stone though, aging probably didn't help this), and a nip of pure alcohol at the end. Raisins and dates up front, bananas and cloves following, cashews and almonds just behind, and finally all pushed away by grapefruit, cedar, and smoked wood. Fairly complex, and very tasty. The ABV is apparent, however. I've had slightly stronger barleywines that are less astringent to the throat.  Mouthfeel is thin up front, almost watery, but turns absolutely massive at the roof of your mouth. This beer has a lot of body, but the high alcohol weakens it a bit at the start and finish of each swallow. The finish is fairly astringent, as the ABV makes itself known.  In spite of the mild ABV dryness at the end of the swallow, this beer is extremely drinkable, especially for a barleywine. Watch yourself, the 10% ABV packs a wallop. It was a trial for me to allow this beer to warm up before finishing it.  And as it warms, the hops *really* come out of the woodwork. Insanely intense grapefruits, cedars, and citrus. Just wonderful. I've had double-IPA's with less hops than this.  Many thanks to Beerhandy for this awesome brew.  Deep, murky, blood-red, The Loch Ness has no more silt, With a crown of white.  A bit of honey, Untold pounds of malt and grain, And some grapefruit smell.  Rich with its sweetness, Puckering with its tartness, It punches the brain.

147,1056,neonbrown82,4.12,"2004 bomber obtained from Vintage Cellar.  Wow! This is much different than I remembered it. Much darker with less of a citric taste, and more of a bitter, raisin/fig barleywine taste than I recall. The beer I remember was much more drinkable, but of course this was just after previously splitting a bottle of Stone Russian Imperial Stout with mentor and Woody (the owner of the local beer joint, The Sanctuary). Not to say I don't think it is just as mindblowing of a beer, but it really goes to show how the time & place affect the experience so much.  ...Anyways, on to the review of the beer in front of me. This is a very deep maroon color with a bit of a red haze and a decent carbonation that forms a weak white head. Looks great, and just how I'd expect my barleywine to look.  The smell is very fruity and malty, and the hops are plentiful enough to sense the bitterness through the nostrils. Quite intense. I almost can't quit huffing it, but alas, I'm so parched that I need to take another drink.  The taste is of dark fruits and an assload of hoppy bitterness. A bit of a malty and/or yeasty earthy flavor in the initial taste. This bastard is killing my tongue! There's no way I'd be able to review another beer after this, but just for the hell of it, I'm going to see how an Alpha King will follow this up; of course, if I'm still able to drink after this beast..!  The mouthfeel is intensely bitter with a heavy, but not chewy, mouthfeel. The alcohol is definitely there, and leaves an intensely dry finish. This is definitely a sipper, but a damn good one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,PBRstreetgang,3.87,"Pours a dark ruby amber. Three fingers of pale tan foam hold extremely well, leaving moderate lace. The smell is mostly roasted malt and dark fruits, with traces of noble hops. The alcoholic aroma becomes pungent as it warms above serving temp. The text written on the back of the bottle helps to prepare you for the punch in the mouth you are about to receive. Taste is a well balanced blend of very sweet burnt malt, fruit esters, and molasses upfront, followed by an eruption of bitter hops and alcohol washing over. Aside from being strong, the mouthfeel is syrupy, with a residual bittersweet aftertaste; one would expect a dryer finish given all the hops, no? If you can finish the entire bomber, you will feel a slight alcohol warmth. Overall, a quality beer that delivers what the marketing promises. However, the Barleywine style is one that should offer the drinker rich sensations of smell, taste, mouthfeel and inebriation; not just try to kick your ass.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

The sccent comes out strong as it pours. DAMN. At first, hops, then hops. The hops were piney and strong. The malts were sweet. Nothing about this barleywine is subtle. The taste is a butt kicker. You can taste so much going on here, plus the alcohol. Dark fruits, like plum, maybe cherries as well as choclate. Don't drink the whole 3L bottle, unless you want to be the bastard.

Lots of caramel malts build into piney hops before drying to a slightly astringent, very spicy, and elegantly vinous woody finish. Thick and sugary in the mouth, with prickly carbonation and big warming alcohol on a rich base.

Flavor: Earthy and woody. Spices play on your tongue and the ale feels a little burnt.  Taste: The moment you take a sip, hops hit you. They fill every corner of your mouth sticking around while malt sweetness slowly goes down your throat. And then the warmth of this strong brew hits you from within. This ale ""is not to be wasted on the weak."" It is quite powerful and flavorful. Feels like malts and hops are competing for your attention.

147,1056,BuckSpin,4.28,"Presentation - c.2004 vintage bomber  I am now all but convinced that Stone produces, as a stable, the most beautiful beers of anyone. Saved this bomber for a quiet Saturday evening. The color is just incredible - a beautiful, warm, deep ruby ruddy-amber hue with a sharp, crystalike clarity, all under a tight 1"" head of blanched almond foam that laced subtly as I drank.  The nose was more interesting than Arrogant Bastard, with noticable fruit tones (dried currants or cherries) over a soft malt base. Echoes of peat and oak (reminiscent of the Oaked version) were present as well.  Its warming on the tongue, but a slow warming at first that builds to a full mouth warming by the throat. The nose qualities carry over to the tongue as the same fruit, peat, malt & oak aromas translate to pleasing tastes that work well together, but not over the top. Its balanced and smooth, with all players knowing their part and playing it well, in support of each other. A mild honey sweetness plays off the mildly bitter hops and oak, all joining with a creamy quality on the pallete.  The finish - yowza! The hops do their best to fight off the alcohol, but I must admit that their were some brief cobwebs after each early swallow. It definitely packs a sensory wallop on the throat. However, the aftertaste is slightly filmy, (which I do not care for with the chalky Arrogant Bastard) and bittersweet but not bad, nice actually.  Aside the from fact that I can't imagine sessioning this, it was enjoyable and, IMHO, better than Arrogant Bastard.

NOT to say that it wasn't good, by any means, just...different from what I was expecting.  It poured a deep, reddish brown with a thick, cream-colored head. It smelled of fruit, notably pear and grape, with strands of sweet but faint chocolate. To taste, Double Bastard presented the PERFECT balance of hops and malts.

Has the look of thickness, viscocity, and ultimate maltiness. Pours an array of colors: brown, copper red, burgundy, maroons.... it goes on. Has a thick dense tan head that lingers as long as you want.  Aromas are intense mariage of complex malt, complex hops, and complex alcohol. Deep maltiness, grassy-hoppy, and a grainy twang also present deep into the nose An organic scent that adds complexity to the grain, hop and yeast content.  Malts portray flavors of caramel, brown sugar and molassas. Malts also bring out fruits of figs, dates, and a little in the way of prunes and raisons. Hop complex is highly pronounced from nose to finish. Earhty and grassy like IPA's but more complex and flavor infused. Alcoholic flavors also present throughout.  Mouthfeel is creamy, heavy, and rich; yet disected cleanly by hop bittering. Rather a crisp finish to a high gravity beer.  Aftertaste lingers indefinately with complex malt sweetness and hop bittering. Dark fruits continue to abound.  Impression: A great beer for that mood that hits you every couple months.

No disappointment in the flavor whatsoever. Citric hops that aren't very evident in the nose hit you first, melding into soft sweet malts. Lots of sweetness: sugary and buttery caramel, raisiny and somewhat nutty. Finishes with a sweet, warming alcohol kick. Mouthfeel is very thick and smooth, slightly oily.

Stink: When I stick my nose into my glass, it is greeted by a tangy plum raisins alchohol bouquet. Yeasty biscuits come to mind too.  Taste: Fruity.

Warming alchohol follows everything, and provides a little tang.The biscuty malt provides a base for everything, the hops are very mild, but show up as the beer warms.  Feel: Smooth, yet solid.

There are some vinous qualities, almost a brandied raisin smell. Alcohol is present, but infused with so many nice things.  Appearance: Half finger of tan head at the pour quickly evaporated before my eyes to some traces of bubbles . Glass is amber-plum colored and semi-opaque letting enough light through to show clarity and color, but little else.  Flavor: Maybe its the aging, but Im amazed on how mellow and smooth this is. Rich dark malt holds all the fruit flavors of raisin, plum, and dates. Firm but not harsh hop character comes in about mid taste showing strength to cut the sweetness, but restraint in only letting a mild hop flavor and burn come through. A very mild alcohol taste in the finish, but only a playful tickle where it should be a crushing fist. As it warms a bit of a roasted malt and tobacco flavor comes through.  Mouthfeel: Serious chew called for; the body is very full and rich. A nice dry finish as well. Only traces of carbonation noted which really fits the overall profile of this beast. It numbed everything it came in contact with.  Overall Impression: Wow. Scary how easy it is to drink. Where this should be an assault on many levels, its more of a subversion; the dagger in the back from a treacherous lover rather than the jackboot of a thug. I could drink another bomber and wake up in front of my computer tomorrow; damn the torpedoes. I cellared this for close to two years to celebrate a long project.

The taste has nuttiness and a deep over-ripe cherry flavor. Sweet with a touch of puckering tartness at the end.  The alcohol creeps out as you continue to drink Double Bastard.

All sweetness is obliterated as the beer reaches the back of the tongue and bitterness hits. The bitterness is overwhelming, but not unpleasant. Probably not great if you're not a hop fan, though! The finish is long and bitter, with alcohol heat (surprisingly well hidden in the flavour) sliding all the way down the chest, and lingering long after the beer is gone.

Wow, wow, wow. Don't drink this one with dinner - enjoy sips of it for dessert.

147,1056,asabreed,4.48,"2004 release. Bomber. Poured into a wine glass.  I have two others sitting, but since it's been a year since I had a taste last, I figured I'd buy another to have now and actually review.  Appearance: Beautiful red / amber color, fluffy white head full of mini bubbles that slowly recedes, some spotty lacing around the glass as I drink. Fantastic.  Smell: Fruitiness and malt upfront. Pear, cherry, berries. Some oily hop aromas in the back. Some yeast and bread. Extremely well-balanced, as nothing comes through more than anything else.  Taste: The fruit and sweetness are apparent right away. Some oily hop bitterness is apparent upon after taste, but it's not pervasive. The flavors of fruit are more discernible as it warms, with pear being the most dominant. Some bready and yeasty aromas that help to balance everything too. Amazingly balanced.  Mouthfeel: Very very nice. The tiny bubbles in the appearance come through the make the mouthfeel velvety and carbonated perfectly. I could swish this around all the time.  Drinkability: I don't want more than maybe one a month because this is such a treat. Thankfully I have two left as I write this.  Stone continues to be one of the best breweries around. Some may say this is their best beer, and I'm pretty close to saying it also. Regardless, this is a great beer, and I will continue to drink it as long as it's available. Not only that, but this is recent stuff, meaning the 2004 -- so something this green, that also tastes so fantastic, can only get better with age.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Vipsanius,4.48,"The appearance is mahogany colored with a half inch tan head. The lacing is very ghoulish looking. Great lacing.  The aroma has a very strong granny smith apple smell to it. Also, several other fruits, brown sugar, caramel, malts.  The taste is insane. Extremely complex. Here's a mild description of what it's like: entering your mouth its caramel, chocolate, malts, molasses and then gives way to piney hops, fruits, herbs and then a salted buttery and extremely bitter finish.  The mouthfeel is somewhat warm and this beer absolutely kicks your palate's ass. I'm talking about like this is a severely pissed off Andre the Giant in his prime with full body armor and armed with bazookas -this beer- versus Dustin Diamond (Schreech from Saved by the Bell) armed with a spork and a spatula -your palate-...not even close and I love that.  This beer is very odd. The first time I tried it, I thought it was absolutely horrible...nearly gave away my other 5 bombers. Fortunately, I gave it another shot and thought it was absolutely great...but didn't review it then. This is the third time I've had it. Honestly, it's between the first two. This time and the first time I had basically nothing to eat and a very clean palate. Both times it was pretty damn hard to drink...basically the equivalent of drinking straight cheap-ass liquor. The second time was after a big dinner and much much easier to drink. I've based my scores based on that experience and will make sure to drink this after meals from now on.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Taste: Huge bitterness overpowers the initial pine-hop, then sweet maltiness. The bitterness grinds on for a long, long time. Way to much alcohol flavor jumping out. Mouthfeel: Thick, fine bubbles and little hot on the alcohol.

I poured this with fervor since the beer itself was taunting me. A gingerly pour seemed weak and useless. I needed to assert myself from the get go. My delicate snifter was able to handle it, but only after some words of encouragement.  The dark honey liquid sat with a foam crown. Brew was fairly solid and cloudy. Lacing descended slowly as if to try to maintain a foothold upon my glass. A last stand at dominance. Alas, my appetite for the fermented achieved victory.  The aroma was pungent molasses. Thick and aggravated. Malts of all sorts jumping to freedom upon the air above their foam horizon. Hints of alcohol tickled on the retreat of the failed escapees.  In the mouth a robust caramel bath of sweetness submerged the tongue. Bitterness fought its way through the front lines only to be swallowed, splattering the battlefield with dewy hop resins, oily and abundant. The alcohol was a furnace. Mouthfeel had a mid level carbonation. The beer was thick and chewy; heavy, but not too heavy. It's a delicate balancing act that makes me raise an eyebrow at its self-inflated machismo.  This beer is made to enjoy. And enjoy I did. Slowly though.

A deep caramel red pour that nears opaque with a big fluffy, creamy two finger khaki head sitting nicely atop the brew. A circular ring of lacing appears as the head falls. Pine bough resin and citric hops waft up into my nose alongside a rich, candy sweet caramel toffee nose. Big and inviting.  First sip brings an elegant mix of big, bracing fresh pine tree and citric hop flavors along with a lush, caramelly toffee sweet maltiness. Quite well balanced with a nearly mouth puckering bitterness on the way down. Hints of dark fruits and raisins lurk in the mix as well. A damn good barleywine...10% abv is nowhere to be found in the taste. Wow.  Big, creamy buttery smooth mouthfeel with spot on carbonation. Simply a treat to drink. Each sip leaves me longing for another. This will be one I will look forward to each year. Glad I have another bottle in the cellar. Highly recommended and yet another winner from Stone!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,ommegangpbr,3.95,"Think Arrogant Bastard or Stone IPA but with even more attitude (and more alcohol). Strong hops presence, strong dark fruit flavor presence, all in relative well balance. Definately aggressive but surprisingly sophisticated. I think this qualifies more like a stronger than strong dark ale as opposed to a barley wine. Not for everyone but well made.

It stays in a nice 1/2 cm frothy top. The beer itself doesn't have much of a smell. As with all of Stone's beers this one has that familiar hop characteristic that reminds me of their Barleywine. There is a syrupy sweet taste with hints of maple, burnt wood, sugar, fruit, apple . There is a distinct sweetness to this beer that makes it very attractive. It's light in your mouth, but still feels heavy to the tounge if that makes any sense. It's not hard to drink, especially if you've had a beer or two before it.

An alcohol presence is also there. This definitely tastes like the big brother of arrogant bastard. Taste is spicy alcohol and sweet, thick, heavy caramel. A piney hop bitterness shows itself toward the end. Very thick in the mouth, the alcohol presence prevents this one from being very drinkable. Not a bad barey wine, but not one of my favorites.

There is no doubt on the beauty of its dark color and nose of bubblegum, rum and malt. The taste remains a bit too hot with alcohol dominating the beautiful rich body and silky, resiny hops. Warming does not help which may mean a year or two may bring it all into balance. This is an intense experience of barley wine madness in the best and worst sense.

He began to drink his first and when I asked him how it was he replies, ""It's like a slap in the face"". Not a bad slap in the face, but this damn beer is intense. It poured out deep amber with a thick head. I noticed hints of all sorts of sweetness, from different kinda of fruit to chocolate. However, what I noticed most was the fact that this beer has muscle. The hops seemed slightly stronger than the malts, but both were overshadowed by the pure power of the alcohol.

147,1056,IrishMike,4.41,"So what i have sitting in front of me tonight is the supposed greatest beer of my favorite style. Been waiting awhile to find out where i can get one of these bombers, and i have mntlover to thank for the opprotunity to try it out. An American-Barley wine freak like myself couldn't be more pleased with a chance at this infamous brew; so much so that the entire two days that i was sitting in my room i could hear it calling out my name....  Appearance- Did somebody switch my bottle with Old Horizontal? Pour them right next to each other and i wouldn't be able to tell one apart from another. Dark copper, nice head off white 1"" head and a wild lacing that carries huge strings from one side of the glass to the other. Average head retention. Very mild carbonation.  Smell- Yikes, this one SMELLS intimidating! Floral hops and fusel alcohol strike first, completely dissallowing anything else to enter their territory. I spent a good minute taking sniffs and trying to figure out what was hiding underneath them. Rum, grapefruit, and a prickily spiciness to it. Nostrils completely cleared up after spending time smelling this one. Ah, my feel sinuses are nice and clean.  Taste- Thankfully, the taste doesn't make quite as bold a statement as the nose of this bombshell. Hops mix with sweet malts first, both backing away at essentially the same time for pleasent after taste that is smooth and spicy. Caramel soaked grapefruit, or is that grapefruit infused rum?, english cheddar, and a lemon/citric bitterness (possibly somehow related to Lemon Warheads candy) take you through and interesting journey of flavors. Oddly enough, none of these seem to be too strong nor too bitter to take away from it at all. Some raisins and figs perhaps? Caramel? Some alcohol to boot? Sure, why not. There's always more than enough going on here.  Mouthfeel- Just about where i want it to be; full bodied, rich and strong with a pleasant after-taste. Low amount of carbonation, but that seems to be the norm for the style at hand here.  Drinkability- I have basically destroyed this bomber in little over an hour, and despite feeling the alcohol-related effects of it, i can't see myself stopping before the show is completed. Alcohol is always present, but in a weird twist, only seems to add to the complexity to the brew. It's bizzarre balance is what ultimately leads to it's drinkability.  After what was set out as a goal to find which was my favorite A.B.W. (this versus the Bigfoot and the Old Ho) i came to a slightly depressing conclusion that it's a three-way draw. Each offers their own particular take on the style, and all three succeed at the same level. But considering i loved the other two brews, i can't at all be dissapointed that i find this one to be at equal level. Maybe not the most hoppy (Bigfoot), or the most malty (Old Horizontal), but possibly the most complex and balanced. I can see why this one rates as highly as it does. One of those fine brews that lives up to the hype.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,kegerator,2.83,was alittle disppointed in this one. poured out a dark copper with amber hues and a 1 inch creamy off shite head that left nice lacing. smell was faint at first but with warmth and a swirl i was able to detect some malt and slight fruitiness. taste was strange to me. big malt hit then fizzled off quickly and just left bitterness. starnge thing is i did not really smell a lot of hop in the aroma at all. the hop had no real flavor either just left bitterness on the tongue and a burning feeling on the sides of the mouth and in the stomach. alcohol was not really noticeable. I drank it but contemplated pouring it out. I would not waste any money on this one again.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,AlexJ,4.97,"Well, I finally caved and opened a bottle of 03 that I've been stashing. It pours a magnificant amber red that glows from within. A brief head of wheat colored foam erupts to a chunky peak before receding into a ring around my tulip glass. Lace is adequate and clumpy.  A gentle swirl releases a bouquet of delight! Caramel infused rum balls and singed creme brulee'. Dark, moist fruit cake with dates, figs, cherries, bananas, and pinapple. An array of floral, citrus, and pine-drenched hops bring up the rear. I was anticipating a more subtle hops aroma. If Stone has taught me one thing, it's to expect the enexpected! Alcohol is evident, but well infused into the mix.  WOW! This beer is insane! It begins with toasty caramel malts, buttery English toffee, oak, vanilla, yellow raisens, tropical fruits, and malted milk balls. A tsunami of hops quickly washes over! An oily, resinous, thick coating of pine-drenched grapefruit, tangerine, and sweet florals takes me for a long, smooth ride. A superbly crafted alcoholic rush reminds me of the strength. Be warned, you could drink this all night!  The mouthfeel is epic. Like hop infused melted butter. It is thick, viscous, and absolutely paints your mouth with layers of flavor. The carbonation is like silk on your tongue. There is a long finish filled with a multitude of hop flavors. I'll accept a bitch-slapping from this Bastard any time! None better!

In the flavor I am noticing different qualities/styles of sugars present. Also, there are sprinklings of spices with lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, and something I can't name that has a bit of a kick to it. The alcohol is also very noticable. With the mouthfeel, there is a slight alcohol burn on the tongue. Unfortunately, I tend to prefer beers with such a high ABV that are better at conceeling it, so that kind of took away from the experience for me.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

A nice bold color, complimented by an estery caramel smell. It simply smells of a good blend of hops and grains, with a plenty of alcohol on hand. Bitter hops start and finish the taste in a glorious fashion. In between the hops there is a big full bodied malt taste, lots of sweet caramel and creamy malt. Also a roasted character and a slight hint of nuttiness. Definitely a complex taste. Very full, satisfying mouthfeel. Big and creamy, but broken up by clean citrous hops and warming alcohol.

A good looking brew IMO. Smell is mainly plums or grapes w/ a very slight soy sauce twang to it. My girlfriend actually said she thought of rasberry chocolate a little, due to the malts, and I even got a little bit of hops sprinkled throughout. Taste up front gives a lot of alcohol. As this warmed, however, vanilla caramel tones came through to the forefront of the sip, along with a heavy dose of fruit (plums & grapes) and even a little almond flavor maybe. Bitter swallow and bitter aftertaste that gives the impression of a creamy bitter malt finish (very nice!). The overall feel of this one is a medium-to-full body (more full), w/ a lot of carbonation up front (due to the temperature maybe) w/ a nice smooth swallow and a lot of 10% alcohol burn on the finish!

The aroma was fruity with citrus notes, apricots, deep dark caramel and some alcohol. The hop aromas increased substantially as the beer warmed leaving a distinct resinous pine impression.  The flavor was malty and alcoholic with a fruity impression and a nice maltiness and a munich malt flavor. The frutiness was citrusy and the bittering well done to keep the maltiness of this big brew in check. The malty flavors were unique and interesting with a bready/biscuit impression. As the beer warmed the bittering and hops became more and more resinous.  The finish was dry with a lasting citrusy, fruity flavor and a lingering alcohol warming. The body was full and viscous. A really nice barleywine.  22 ounce bottle. 2004 release. I had a 2002 and was on the fence as to which one to open.

The pour is a dark copper/red with a good two finger rough, thick head that slowly dissapated and left a ring around the top of the beer that held on throughout the drink.  The smell was a complex mix of sweet fruit and pungent hops. You can literally smell the flavor explosion you're about to get from the drink.  The drink starts with a quick bite of sweet fruit and then please lock your tray tables in their upright position the flavor is about to take off. The middle of this is an explosion of fruit, malt, and hops that is almost impossible to explain. The finish is a lingering hop bite mixed with a strange metallic note, but is still quite enjoyable.

Full bodied; overwhelms the palate with an aggressive bitterness, tartness, and alcohol character, yet is surprisingly mellow on the palate.

Taste: Intensely, almost cloyingly sweet caramel taste, with secondary notes of brown sugar, molasses, dark fruit, moderated but not subdued by an undercurrent of metallic and medicinal hops, which finally overcome the plethora of sweet flavors and then fade away.  Mouth feel: Very rich, smooth, and full, velvety, with just a hint of soft carbonation.  Drinkability/notes: An utterly superb dessert beer, to be shared with friends. Double Bastard compares favorably to brandy or cognac, in my opinion.

147,1056,RedwoodGeorge,4.26,"You know you've got good friends when one brings you a bottle of Double Bastard to go with supper :-)  This brew has an astounding pour - deep brown-red with a very thick, sticky tan head. The head stays around for a long, long time and finally breaks down into lots of lacing on the glass.  The nose is a bit subtle - notes of malt and yeast, very light floral hops notes all of compliment the sweet smell of ethyl alcohol.  The taste, whilst strong, is far from overpowering. Plenty of fruity notes in this brew - apples, plum and (of all things) pineapple. There's a very dough-ish yeast note (perhaps what others would call ""biscuity"" but it reminds me of nothing more than raw, uncooked bread dough) to compliment a subtle smoky malt flavor and an even more subtle hop finish. Oh, yes, and then there's the alcohol. At 10% ABV there's no hiding the sweet alcohol 'burn' that goes along with every sip. I swear there were times I thought someone had dropped a shot of brandy in my ale.  Mouthfeel was quite pleasant, with rather low carbonation but leaving a reasonably clean palate.  As far as drinkability goes, much depends on your definition. I've always considered this category to answer the question ""Would you look forward to drinking this beer again?"" and if that's the question, the answer is 'most definitely yes'. If the question is ""Would you drink more than one of these in a sitting?"" the answer is 'not without needing medical assistance afterward'. Yes, this is a high ABV drink and it is an ass kicking bastard. I am quite impressed but there's no doubt who won this round...",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Wolfsdenbrew,4.41,"This pours a beautiful, clear, deep amber almost ruby color. It has a large creamy, light tan head that dissipates extremely slow and leaves behind a large amount of lace that clings to the sides of the glass. This is the best looking beer I have ever had.  The aroma is slightly yeasty, with some malt notes and a little bit of floral hop bouquet.  the flavor is wonderful...well balanced, moderately sweet, caramel malts with lots of hops. This one is hoppy but not overpowering, piney, citrusy, almost grapefruit rind flavor. Finishes with a warm alocohol tone.  Lightly carbonated, but good for the style.  One of the best beers I have ever had...absolutely loved this one. Stone continues to be one of my favorite brewers.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,hobbes2112,4.48,"I got a hold of this 2004 beer while at home for the holidays in Ohio. I love getting the change up of beer selection!  The beer poured a dark almost ice-tea color with large 2 finger head. The head lasted a long time and there was little to no lacing.  Aroma is pretty much what I expected, lots of pine and citric notes from the hops with further levels of complexity like a woody carmel sweetness. Of course alcohol in there also.  Taste is great, not really what I would expect from something called a barleywine but for sure a level up from the AB strong ale. Tons of hop in this one, nice bitter finish. Rich sweetness like maple syrup and carmel and some spice. The alcohol is somewhat masked but still noticable.  The young version of this that I have is like the AB kicked up a notch. I would really like to age this for a little while. Maybe I will buy one or two to leave at home for that purpose.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Sycodrummer,4,"Recently has a 5oz. sample of it at the Sunset Grill and Tap in Allston, Ma. As its name implies and prior BA's have indicated in their reviews this is a great one - strong - but great.  Apearance was a light to medium brown color similiar to that of a brown ale only a bit lighter. Service was in Sunset's traditional 5oz. Pilsners which allowed for very nice head retenion during the duration of the sample but offered little in the way of lacing.  This beer started off with a fruity smell that was backed by a powerful and strong taste. Definitely something that needs to be respected as a brew. A nice beer to sit and sip as an aperitif or cordial. Would not want much more than 5oz. though as it packs a punch. But overall a very solid brew that i will be sure to sample again in the near future.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Stingray5,5,"Finally the elusive Double Bastard is in hand. Pours a deep gold with red highlights, huge, foamy tan head. Exceptional aroma. Subdued sweetness in the aroma, with hints of hop bitterness. As it warms, pineapple. Creamy mouthful, this is much smoother than I remember the (single) Bastard being. While hoppy in taste, this bastard reckons itself a barleywine. Big sweet malt presence, dark fruit, grape, hints of red wine. The hops give a wake up call in the finish, with a nice touch of alcohol burn to liven things up. Not overbearing by any means.  I find this even more drinkable and enjoyable than standard Arrogant Bastard. Stone has done it again. Great success!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,nogoodreason,4.5,"2004 Edition  Deep amber with glowing crimson highlights, startlingly clear. Tan head, fizzes and settles down to a few centralized chunks of bubbles. Nose is of very juicy citric hops, caramel and a powdery sweetness, best described as cotton candy. A detectable piney scent lingers with fusel underpinnings.  Full in the mouth but not really thick, nor particularly sticky the carbonation is just right, keeping it light and bordering on creamy. It hits your tongue with a wave of citrus that's surprisingly lacking in bitterness. Actually, it's quite refreshing. There's a lot of fruity and powdery sweetness and as you swirl it around in your mouth alcohol pops up here or there. Going down, it shows it's true colors with intense caramel maltiness and rough, aggressive pine sap hops. The piney aspect remains and builds in the rear palate throughout the experience, adding an enjoyable aggressive hop presence to this otherwise surprisingly sweet and mellow ale. At points the citrusey hops mingle with the cotton candy in the malt for a flash, teasing you with an easy drinking ale before the bastard rams some more savagely bitter Chinook down your throat. Incredible strong ale. I'm impressed.  A perfect example of attaining balance by going to extremes. Really, really nice.

Did not leave a lot of lacing or retain its head very well. Sweet, malty aroma with the presence of alcohol. Very complex flavor but the alcohol taste and aroma is unavoidable. The mouthfeel is incredible. Very creamy texture which makes it a great after dinner beer. Very easy to drink despite all the alcohol in it.  I was not overwhelmed by this beer, but I feel it would be most enjoyable as a dessert beer or something to sip after a nice meal.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Thick lace and residual head/collar for quite a while. Nice.  Smell: Powerful blend of caramel, chocolate, pine, citrus, floral and pitted fruit. (Peach? That's a new one.) Slightly medicinal/solvent. It all combines to create its own unique, perplexing scent. There's a lot going on here.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Thick, dense, coating but lively mouthfeel. Chocolate maltiness off the bat, with dense hop favors mid-palette. Cherry/plum sweetness emerges periodically. Finishes slightly bitter. There seems to be a hint of diacetyl in this one as well.  Drinkability: Big and brash--one's more than enough. Truth be known, I much prefer the Single Bastard. This one's good, and lord knows it's big, but I'm not finding anything that really wows me. Maybe a bit of aging will help, but as it stands, Bigfoot stomps da Bastard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Nice, ½ inch plume of initial down feather head. Deep amber to light brown hue that is calm and clear. Candied apple and cherry cotton candy sweetness to nose, underneath which resides a malt clamminess. Gaudy dreamberry fizziness on the tongue, followed by a shot of alcohol heat and a fairly cleansing hop bite at the end. Sort of middling sting to the mouth as it warms.

The taste is surprisingly smooth, with a wonderful back-and-forth volley of hops, caramel, brandy characters, and again, millions of other faintly detectable elements, with alcohol warming around the edges.

It has a rich and intense malt offering that is balanced well with an equally intense hop aroma. It is quite floral to the nose as well as warm smelling. The taste is good. It has a very bitter hop flavor which seems to carry the taste. The malts compliment the palate, but take a backseat to the hops. It goes down easy and finishes warm and sweet. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer.

I would have like it if this had a little more malt background, but it's still one hell of a barleywine.  2004 vintage poured in an arrogant bastard glass both courtesy of Gueuzedude, poured with a creamy off white head and a deep garnet hazy color. resiny hoppy aroma with underlying malt sweetness and some raisins then there's the alcohol. nice sweet thick body that balances out with an intense hop character that is really bitter-a little coarse but not harsh. still an awesome beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Very vineous,toasty aroma,sweet,smells of prunes,figs and fruitcake. Again quite sweet indeed, to taste but its a dark,slightly decomposed sweetness, like prunes,figs and dark wild berries,after the sweetness a great bitterness,and a warming alcoholic tang.Warming all the way down, but in reality the 10% alcohol is barely noticable.

147,1056,sideshowrob,4.6,"Brew poured into a fitting 22-oz Stone AB flute. Very nice color - a deep orange/red/amber. Almost glows. Complex nose and sent profile - lots of malts and hops hit you all at once - carmel, orange, hint of pine. The smell can be overpowering, but becomes balanced once you take it all in.  Flavor was out-of-this-world. Not sure why this is called a barley wine by BA, but I guess it fits as well as any style. The massive malts are balanced , fought over, and eventually displaced by the hoppy sweetness of this brew. Very complex, with many, many notes and flavors vying for attention. Carmel and buttery notes come through most strongly for the matls, with orange and ""hoppy sweet"" coming through for the cone-leaning. Beautifuly crafted beer!  Mouthfeel is good, with tons of interplay occuring on the palate.

Some citrus and roasty, caramel malt. Even sweet pastries and raisin bread at times.  Taste: Whoa. The huge flavors one would expect from Stone. Brown sugar and candy sweet but searingly spicy as well. Fruity at times... cherries perhaps? Finish is wickedly bitter like other Stone brews. Grapefruity bitterness simply tears through your mouth and right into your throat. Leaves the mouth slightly dry but wanting another sweet sip. Extremely balanced. Well done. This stuff would rock with some age on it.  Mouthfeel: A real whopper. Big and chewy, full bodied and nicely smooth. A welcome warming from the high ABV and spicy hops.

Mahoganny colored beer with a ruby hue, tiny bubbles lazily float to the surface. The beer is dark, but transparent which creates a really cool effect, kind of like a gem stone. Beer is slick and coats your tongue with flavor. Malt bomb up front that barely holds of the alchol. Stong bitterness kicks in half way through.

147,1056,99bottles,4.7,"Appearance: Poured slowly without disturbing the sediment, this beer has a very clear body of deep reddish copper. Very low carbonation, if any. A head of 2 inches rises with a light tan tint, and falls with average retention. Sticky lacing on the inside of the glass.  Smell: This has a really nice smell; there are strong sugar notes that bring to mind brown sugar, carmel and maple candy. Some fruity esters (citric hops?) try to pull through, but can not overcome the cookie like sugar smells.  Taste: There are the Stone trademark hops. In the taste, the hops come to the front and oddly enough, come to the front of the flavor. What remains is a rich and alcoholic taste of plum, brandy, and more of that decadent sugar. Is it actaully unfermented sugar? I doubt it, seeing the amount of sediment left to bottle condition this guy. But, seeing as this is only a few weeks old, perhaps the conditioning has yet to really take hold. This does have memories of the AB ale that is so popular; only it refines all the little qualities that make the little brother so arrogant and at times, unrefined. This is a really complete ale; I can't call it a barleywine with a clear conciense. Instead call it an American masterpiece. Stone's best, by far.  Mouthfeel: For such a sultry ale, this is great by not cloying. Though the carbonation is quite minimal, it works perfectly with the character of the beer. Nicely matched.  Drinkability: I love the subtle tastes, the nicely refined flavor, and the quality of this beer. That being said, I don't think anyone ought to have more than one of these already large 22 ounce bombers. It would be disrespectful to binge such a nice product. I can drink this easily, though quantity remains low due to quality. Take that as you will.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Very sweet and bitter at the same tame. Fabulous. A complete attack on the taste buds, but not in a bad way. This beer will set you straight and put you in your place.

Taste: Hit first with the malt and carmel flavors. After that the hops come through and stay to leave a bitter aftertaste. Flavors begin to open as beer warms. Not much of an alcohol sting on this one. Very complex beer. One thing I noticed about this beer is that when it is cold it has a very bitter, almost disagreeable aftertaste. When it warms it really smooths out and becomes quite phenominal.  Mouthfeel: Pretty thick and smooth with the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkibility: For a 10% beer this is highly drinkable. The flavors begin to open as the beer warms and it really keeps your interest.  Overall this beer improves upon the already fantastic Arrogant Bastard.

Definietely sweentness, almost syrup-like sweetness, but minimally offset by a fair amount of hops. Again, like Arrogant Bastard but overcharged. The alcohol is basically undetectable: quite an accomplishment for a 10% brew.  Mouthfeel: This thing is smooth like silk. It just flows into your mouth with a moderate amount of carbonation and somewhat thick.  Drinkability: I'm sure you're wondering why I gave this thing a 4.5 for drinkability when it clocks in at 10% alcohol by volume. Quite simply, it tastes damn good, even if it is strong. Furthermore, you can enjoy it over a long period of time, as it's flavor actually betters as the beer warms. It took me 30 minutes to savor 1 bomber of this stuff. I could qute easily do a few if I had purchased more than 1 case.

Ahh fruity and malty hell even smells like some vanilla thrown in the mix. Hops also but not as big as I imagined them being mostly grassey smelling but light pine also coming up. Taste lightly like regular bastard that has been hit with malt steroids. This beer is big on malt, fruity sweet chewy caramel malt at that. Hops are present but not as in your face as regular bastard due to addition of extra malt ofcourse. Taste is big and at 10% you would think some alcohol would be present but it is very well hidden underneath the malty flavor. This is not a beer that begs to be sipped, man this stuff is good enough to drink, as long as you do not have to stand up afterwards. Mouthfeel is big chewy find myself smacking my lips after downing a swallow for some reason. Drinkability is great I bought 6 bottles now I have only 5 :( in my opion it is better then Old Guardian this is one hell of a beer a great barley wine love it almost as much as my Bigfoot and looking back should have rated Bigfoot a 5 across the board.

Some nice malt notes too, caramel most prominently, but really can't hold a candle to the bitterness...really really bitter. And its a harsh bitter too. These ain't no low cohumulone hops. I've heard Stone loves the Chinook and I imagine that's what this is. Maybe I'd celler this for a year or two in an attempt to tame the hops a tad. This is pretty much straight off the truck...arrived I think in Indiana November 1st or so.  With the fairly strong alcohol and ridiculously bitter harsh hops in the finish....its definately not smooth.  Mouthfeel is decent. Thick but not creamy. Definately thicker than thin however.

I read the bottle and thought, who cold make such statements, Stone brewing has proven it does have the right, as I have tasted Arrogant Bastard, Russian Imperial Stout and others. But just the same, very bold statements. Well I fancy myself a judge of beer having homebrewed for 6 years.  Lets start with this, this beer blew me away; enough so to make it my first ever review.  Appearance: gorgeous a beautiful reddish color with a nice creamy head of amber which quickly dissipates, followed by a decent trail of lace. Smell: I had some issues with the smell although it was so refreshing it reminded me of a spring rain and fresh grapes. The exact aromas I could not pinpoint, perhaps on a second tasting. Taste: the taste as with the smell gave me the same but more powerful feeling, I had my first bottle with some French soft cheese and I plan on opening my second bottle of heaven when finished here, and I can assure you I will be buying more tomorrow. Mouth feel: excellent very mellow near perfect not sure if I should say it but potentially my new favorite beer. Drinkability: Whoa watch out for this one 10% abv, one and I'm happy two and I'm toast but only because my wife doesn't make dinner, so empty stomach and all sans the French cheese. I am going to have another and then tomorrow purchase six more for another day, more likely six other days.

147,1056,bultrey,4.52,"2001 Vintage. I received this fine aged bottle of liquid arrogance from EyeChartBrew in a East/West coast beer trade, and what a treat it turned out to be. Poured into a Bourdeaux-style wine glass. Excellent carbonation and head, with some fine sticky lacing along the side of the glass. Smell is reminiscent of maple, vanilla, soy sauce, and chocolate-covered dark fruits, such as fig and raisin. There was also a bit of a musty basement smell. The first taste I got was the maple, which was when the beer was slightly chilled. Some dark fruit is there, plums perhaps, and a dusting of cocoa powder. As it warms, some of the soy sauce comes in, much like the Sam Adams triple bock. Only in this beer, it's not overhwelming and sickening; rather, it's delicate and complex. The hops have been tempered by the aging, and the only evidence that they exist is a nice, lingering bittersweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel of this is like a thick, creamy chocolate milk. The alcohol is so well-hidden that I could drink this until I passed out, which wouldn't take long, I'm sure. Take a couple of these and cellar them. This is a fabulous beer in the current vintage, but it totally transforms upon proper aging.

The complexity comes at you in levels, and challenges the drinker as promised by the blurb on the back of the bottle. Out front sweetness is followed by a bitter hoppy kick contrasted with a sturdy malty backbone. Getting a lot of syrupy molases sort of tastes and the contrast of that to the bitterness is fricken great. A fun beer to drink for sure. Super slick smoothness in the mouth.

Some light citrus and alcohol becomes more prevalent as it warms.  RICH and malty up front. Hops come in the middle with grapefruit and lemon. Sweet, rich, but light, in comparison with the rest of the beer, dark fruits. Loads of barley. Alcohol brings more sweetness and fruity character. It's a ride.

147,1056,waughbrew,3.94,"Beautiful mahogany color with a perfect, creme-colored head with great retention. Smell is a medium amount of piney hops, some cherry notes, and little else. Flavor is toffee and toast with a wonderful spciy piney hop presence and big caramelization. More cherry esters with some alcohol in good proportion. Mouthfeel is fine but bothersome at the same time. The carbonation and big body come through all right, but with that Stone characteristic plasticized feel. Halfway through drinking this it started to piss me off. I find it tough to describe, but it is just a rounded, dulled malt flavor/feel that I get from the majority of their beers. Perhaps it is the caramelization of the malt. Hop bitterness and flavor keeps this one very drinkable for its size.  Impressively made, but the malt flavor and feel fails to make a good showing. The great hopping makes up for that deficiency to result in a pleasant creation.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,AllThingsNinja,4.43,"Sampled with a tormented tonque at the hophead throwdown...  Who in their right mind would seek to balance such an incredible malt backbone with bitter and arrogant hops. I suppose it's some twisted sense of propriety, humor, and adventure that drives the folks at Stone to craft a dark ruby brew with a mind twisting alcohol aroma, chocolate, and grapefruit aroma. The flavors of the brew shift back and forth between sour citrus, again grapefruit, and malt notes of chocolate and coffee. Its an intense mélange enlivened by an alcohol that lets the flavors take flight. A most excellent and drinkable brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,bigbubba,4.37,"This was a beautiful mahogony colored, slightly cloudy beer with very little head on it. There is a delicious sweet malty aroma with a prominent alcohol smell, and a hint of vanilla. The taste is also delicious, very malty with lots of balancing bitterness that helps keep it from being overly sweet. Mouthfeel is excellent. Drinkability is also good, but use caution, as it gets warmer it becomes real easy to gulp down. And that's asking for trouble.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,meathookjones,4.85,"2003 edition in the 22oz bomber. The bigger brother to Arrogant Bastard pours a brown color with reddish highlight and a minimal tan head unless poured very aggressively. The head drops quickly to a bubbly ring leaving a nice lacing around the glass. Quite the strong aroma on this one, with plenty of sweet malts, earthy hops, fruits and a touch of alcohol. This one definitely brings a big taste to the plate with a sweet fruity malt upfront that settles into a bitter hop bite. This one has a similar taste to arrogant bastard but upped several notches and a few more complexities are thrown in. A very complex tasting beer indeed, maybe having a 3 liter at one sitting can help unravel some of these complexities. Mouthfeel is amazing, full and creamy with perfect carbonation. Drinkability is perfect, there is only slight alcohol tastes and scents so that never slows the consumption. This is a near perfect beer in my opinion and I look forward to this years release as this was my last bottle. Highly recommended to all except people new to craft beer because this will knock them on their arse.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Mitchster,4.28,"2003 edition. 22 oz. bomber. 10.0% ABV.  Pours out to a sparkingly clear deep garnet, and with a heavy-handed pour, achieves a large sticky & clumpy yellow head with very good retention and lacing. Bubbles take their time to meander through the sticky deep red and amber liquid. There are little bits of flittering hop debris. Clumps and layers of sticky head remain until the last drop. Aroma...basically a ton of hops and a ton of malts...immediate blast of mango, then piney, resinous hops with hints of turpentine and shellac, caramel, figs and dates...a pretty typical barleywine aroma with a touch of sour green hop leaf. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Mouthfeel is wonderfully cloying and oily, smooth as silk (though the flavor isn't), and with a dense, firm syrupy body. Taste echoes the aroma exactly. Lots of upfront mango and lots of raisiny malts. Medium bitterness, actually decently balanced and not too over-the-top, with a sustained bitterness in the semi-woody finish kissed with hop-leaf astringency. Alcoholic esters are predominant in aroma and taste, however they are not obtrusive, and a touch of peppery alcohol bites the tongue towards the end. Nice wave of clover honey and vanilla cap it off before the aftertaste. Cleanly fermented.  A pretty solid effort from Stone. I tend to prefer my barleywines maltier than hoppier. This one is actually somewhat easy to drink (but still a sipper like Batch 6000) and makes a good nightcap. Pleasant buzz, too. Although it has taken me some time to get used to Stone's Brews (at first they were all one-dimensional over-hopped monsters), I am now starting to get more comfortable with what they are, 'specially their pungent IPA (which is my favorite). Recommended, at least to try it. A love it or hate it kinda brew.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,ppoitras,4.4,"22oz bottle obtained via trade with Pisskynights. Thanks for the opportunity...  Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1 1/2"" of tan head over the clear deeply copper brew. Head is resilient, long-lasting, and laces amazingly, with solid foam being left down the side as the head recedes. Aroma is the solid, sweet scent common to most strong ales, tending towards a bit of fruitiness if one can bypass the obvious alcohol presence. Taste is, as expected sweetly malty, but well contrasted by the strong hops presence, which almost seem to provide a grainy feel to the tongue, they are so strongly present. Mouthfeel is great for the style, and drinkability is good, although I fear eventually the malt sweetness might get a bit tiring.

Comes in a beautiful 22oz painted bomber, with the most hilarious label Ive ever read! See here for more  http://www.arrogantbastard.com/db2003/design/db22.gif  Pours an outstanding dark red amber. Unfortunately, head retention is little to none. Smell is malty and sweet, damp like a cave. Taste is bitter and yummy. This is a HEAVY beer. Has the grapefruit taste of the regular Arrogant Bastard ale, but I find this particular taste to be complementary and blend smoothly with the other tastes, unlike the regular AB where the grapefruit seems harsh and out of place to me. This beer also has subtle spiciness to it, perhaps even ginger undertones?  A very smooth and drinkable beer, this is highly recommended.

147,1056,sponberg,4.2,"Three pints and two bottles later, I've finally figured this one out.  Deep amber with a head that dissipates rather quickly. Hoppy sweet aroma - it smells like it wants to stick to your nose. Big time malty sweetness.  I prefer this one 5 to 1 in bottle over the draft version. On tap it's almost sticky, cloyingly sweet, with a caramelly malt sweetness that's palpable and a distant citric hoppiness. It's missing its balance somewhere. In bottle it all smooths out - caramel malty sweetness in a big way, but the balance between the malt and the hops is far better, with a lot of drying alcohol and darker, spicier malts to balance things out. The finish - a fine balance between caramel apple sweetness and citric PacNW hoppiness split by alcoholic fumes - simply rocks. 10% and I'm looking around the house to find another somewhere. What's that? A Stone IPA? That'll work...  Get a bottle. Toss its ass in the back of the fridge for 6 months.

Either that, or Ive become a little too attached to my beer these days and need to get out of the house more often.  There is much hype surrounding this beer, but you cant drink a bottle of hype. Beyond the mythos and hyperbole, this is truly, ultimately a world-class beer. It features a profound malty fragrance that is very sweet and bread-like. The brew itself is clear until you spill the yeasties. It has minimal carbonation and a deep honey-garnet color.  This one sat in my fridge for two months, which probably wasnt a very healthy idea. It wasnt very healthy for the potato salad that sat next to it either. But I was still able to taste everything this big fat Bastard aspires to be. It is muscular and profusely malty with a full-bodied mouthfeel, an alcoholic undertow, and an understated but complimentary bitter finish. It lacks a bit of lace and the head fades quickly, but the potato salad more than made up for this.  And as for that Youre not worthy! stuff, let me tell ya.

Pours out to a dark brown in the glass with a nice head. Excellent lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is that of a sweet malt and is very enticing. The beer isn't as scary as the name implies, but rather a flavor powerhouse of a beer. The malt is so thick you can nearly chew it and is so well-balanced by the hops, which grab you hard, but don't over do it as you might think. Its drinkability is near perfect and if you like pales, IPA's and barleywines, then you'll enjoy the aspects of this one. It is such a well brewed beer. Kudos to Greg and the crew at Stone. Yum.

My brother and I broke this out along with the Stone Vertical Epic 03.03.03 for a mini tasting. This beer is absolutely beautiful to look at. It poured a clear dark ruby color, with a thick foamy tan head. The smell was heavy on the sweety syrupy hops, with other sweet smells such as honey, pine, and maple sap in there as well. The taste is a huge sweet hoppiness just as the smell would indicate. There are some more subtle hints in there, with some earthy tones barely noticible, but really most of the flavors are masked by the wonderful hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth with plenty of carbonation. If i remember correctly, this beer was in fact a gift to me, so for whoever got it for me (I seem to have forgotten), thanks.

It took me a while to get over those vapors and get to studying the rest which had a big caramelic malt profile and a fruitiness approaching orange or watermelon. There's also an earthy/peaty aspect in there, but of course, besides alcohol, the bold hops dominate. In mouth, there's evidently intense hoppy grapefruit juice, caramel, crystal malt and still a moderate alcohol taste. Finish is huge, monstruously bitter, mouth-grabbing, memorable for a while. Mouthfeel is rather thick, closing onto syrup. Definitely worth a try to experiment it, but masochism as they say, is to be consumed in moderate amount.

Could have a more complex flavor, there is a point at which ""More Hops"" becomes a LIABILITY! This brew is right at that point.  Mouthfeel is the thickest brew I have yet tasted.  Drinkable?

A deep reddish brown beer with light carbonation. An arousing aroma on this beer, very sweet slightly piney notes as well. Taste is sweeter than expected due to the higher alcohol. More malty than hoppy. A little fruity , I'm thinking plum? . The hops are a kick in the teeth but this is necessary to keep up with the sweetness. The fact that the malt and the hops are outrageously out of balance brings balance to the beer.That is If you follow illogical logic.

Syrupy, lip-smacking goodness. Big fruit flavors up front, slathered in malty caramel sauce. Alcohol is well-integrated but plainly obvious. In keeping with its Arrogance, it's a blatant exercise in extremes. But somehow, I find this version a bit more drinkable than Arrogant Bastard -- more balance being the key, I think. Citric fruit and pine sap bitterness mingle well with the fruity, estery flavors up front, and it provides a great transition to the finish.

Sticky swirls of lacing cling tenaciously to the inside of the glass.  The aroma brings a muscular wave of toasted malt sweetness battling a king's ransom of floral citrus hops. A caramel note wraps itself around a definitive nasal invasion of alcohol, muting the overall potency slightly.  Simply....Wow! The first sip brings a tongue lashing of poignant malt sweetness smoothly carrying the expected note of caramel, and even some berry holds its ground briefly before being utterly innundated by a dry grapefruit and florally creamy tsunami of hops. The dense pockets of flavor also pack a solid wallop of alcohol, keeping you attentive. It doesn't so much finish as thunder to a close with a legacy of currants and a mouth-drying hops bitterness. Bold and brash, it impressively balances some pretty big ticket flavor elements.  Heavy bodied, it lubricates slickly and coats sweetly, filling the mouth with chewy texture and leaving the tongue glowing hoppily.  It's meaty, beaty, big, and bouncy! Delivering on a reputation that's obviously well-earned, it's all I hoped for and more. Because of the hugeness the balance seems precarious, but it never falters. Like the rest of the beer, the ABV is big too, and it will smack you down if you let it. Still, I'd drink as many more of these as I could until I fell down, but I'm sure I'd be sorry come morning.

Citrus comes first with grapefruit and pineapple, followed by fresh pine. Next inviting scents of toffee and caramel maltiness let you know things will be alright. Then the smell of alcohol mocks you now that you're drawn in.  Flavor is very complex. Begins very smooth and creamy. Toffee, burnt sugar, fruits, and caramel kick things off. Toasted malt follows and then the tounge gets a lashing. Grapefruit and piney hops takeover allowing an earthy-woodiness to settle in the backround. Then comes the alcohol to say its peace as it warms the belly and lets you know the rollercoaster ride of flavor is over.  Full-bodied and creamy with mild carbonation. Drinkability takes a hit due to the richness and high alcohol of the brew.  This is a huge beer that is amazingly balanced for something that can be so malty and so hoppy at different times.

There is a little bit of alcohol evident which becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. There is a slight oily feeling left on the tongue which i actually enjoy.

Don't get me wrong, there's a shitload of hops in this brew, but the maltiness is HUGE! Very roasty, moreso than its younger sibling. I'm glad that malt profile is so big, it balances this brew out so well. Resinous wood and pine notes are noticeable as well. Loads of flavor, a fantastic beer. I wouldn't expect anything less from the kids at Stone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,sulldaddy,4.03,This is a 2003 release that I drink at room temp. The brew pours ruby/mahogany in color and a beige fluffy tightly packed head foams up easily and fades to a edge layer around my snifter. The aroma is very fruity with hints of apple and pears also a floral hop aroma is present. First sip reveals a gentle carbonation and creamy smooth texture. The flavor is malty sweet up front with some earth and piney flavors in the middle and finish. The finish is also a little dry and vinous. I definitely get alcohol warmth on the way to my belly. This is a pretty tasty brew and fairly easy to drink for a 10% abv!,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Billolick,4.5,"Bomber bottle, enjoyed in paper cups at the Warwick NY Disc Golf Ice Bowl. This beer is the ultimate, huge, flavorful, over the top and strong. Big nose, big malt, crushing hop bitterness. Alcohol obviously present, but well in the background, Thick body feel, dances on and coats the tongue and entire mouth.Stone is setting the standard. Perfect brew for a winter, BBQ. Went great with spicy chili and hot sausage sandwedges.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Hops are bastardly huge. Taste: huge malt sweetness. Alcohol. Brandy. All balanced by big resiny hops. A little raw methinks, age might do this beer some good. Mouthfeel is thick, sugary, and big.

147,1056,xgrigorix,4.62,"Twenty two ounce brown bottle, 2003 release.  Pours out a glowing chestnut brown. Clear, with swift moving small bubbles of carbonation. Topped by a thin, dense tan head, that leaves some spotty lace behind.  Complex, toasted malt, plums, resinous piney hops, & a whiff of alcohol.  Wow! Wonderfully sweet toasted malt, caramel, juicy ripe plums, & hints of apple. A brash tongue searing hop flavour takes control with notes of orange zest & pine balance this out. The hop oils linger pleasantly & beg another sip.  Slick, thick, slightly syrupy, modest carbonation.  Is it an IPA? Is it a barley wine? I don't care! A bold & brash sipping beer, that takes regular arrogant bastard out back, beats it with a switch, & takes off with its wallet.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,sprackops,4.67,"Appearance: Very cool bottle. Pours dark amber, almost black into my nonick pint glass. Low to medium carbonation. Thin but adequate head, leaves some lacing.  Smell: Grapefruit, caramel, molasses all melding into what I can only describe as a pineapple-like scent. Both the hops and malt take over the room by exploding in this delicious bouquet the moment you unleash it from the bottle. Through all of this I can hardly detect the alcohol.  Taste: Sweet and fruity at first, opening up to an incredibly complex array of flavors. Tangy juicy hops battle dark malts with an almost scotch-like smoky caramel flavor for dominance. Never bitter or cloying, the balance of this brew is just perfect. Barely detectable alcohol presence. Very satisfying.  Mouthfeel: The thickness of this brew's malt backbone coupled with the hop oils is something unique which I regret to say I've never experienced before, not even in imperial stouts or heavy barleywines. I hesitate to describe it as syrupy, but I think in this case it is an apt description which applies only in the most positive of ways. Gentle carbonation releases new flavors on the tongue. Truly exceptional.  Drinkability: I could easily knock back several of these in a night, rather unusual for such thick, high abv brews. Truth be told it just tastes and feels so damn good that you can have one after another until you're absolutely plastered if you don't stop yourself.  One of many reasons we should be proud of the microbreweries here in North America. This is truly innovative, worldclass beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Color was toasty red. maybe even a brown ruby Lacing is very nice.  Nose: The smells explode out of the glass. It is very sweet, with fruits, citrus, malt.  Taste: Quite foamy in the mouth. It started bitter and ended with alcohol. The bitter hoppines and alcohol made for an interesting aftertaste. Carmel, fruit, citrus, hops, wheat are all present. there is a mean hop bite in the middle of your mouth.  Notes: This is an excellent brew.

This smells like a wonderful barleywine with copious malts and hops. There is an undertone of carmel and chocolate.  The taste is malty and sweet with a strong hop finish. This tastes like a world class barleywine. Wonderful.  Mouhtfeel - Full bodied and creamy in the mouth with a strong bitter finish. Great balance in the mouth and a fine drinking experience.

Very nice lacing  The smell is sweet, lightly grainy and a little hoppy all at the same time.  The flavor is a little coffee like, a little carmelized grain with a hop kick. There's a fruity flavor playing hide and seek in the background and some nice spice. A nice mix of flavors.  The feel is substantial but not heavy or gritty. A solid beer.  Drinkability is good.

147,1056,freed,4.37,"The beer bears a somewhat intimidating label that is suggesting I shouldn't buy the beer, let alone drink it. I can make my own decisions.  The beer is almost a ruby color under the incandescent lights. Very clear for a big beer. There is almost no head, and the little that congealed disappeared after a couple sips. There was no lacing.  The aroma is perplexing. There is a massive spicy malt aroma mixed with a massive spicy hop aroma. Complimenting the aroma is a slightly orange peel and alcoholic sensation. Still pleasant though.  The taste is quite robust. Bountiful even. Strong malts that provide a mix of sweet, almost syrupy drink. A mix of hops and malt provide a nice spice compliment to the syrupy flavor. There is also an alcoholic sharpness that compliments quite well.  Drinks well, and the 22oz isn't too much. That's kind of surprising considering its strength. Maybe the challenge on the label works.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

I was just about finished reading the label's ""diatribe"" when I thought, 'This is better than I thought when I first tasted it a few minutes before.'

It's everything those beers are without any of the faults. That's right, that's it, this beer has no faults, nothing I would ask more of it. So I can give it a perfect rating, right?

Taste: Full flavored malty to beginning to end of fruit mainly charred citrus peels with malty backbone that little or no brewer's can believe this beer is awesome with syrupy mixtures of sweetness and pine cone flavored hops this is a masterpiece, just too good. Full meaty blend of malts and hops adding to this beer's addicting personality just way too good to express within flavor guidelines. Mouthfeel: Full bodied chewy sensation with an exubrently carbonated beer that stands infront of you just drops the jaw of your face.

147,1056,Gusler,4.87,"Release 2003 On the pour a translucent deep garnet color and the head portly in size and spumescent in texture, the color a toothsome light tan with the resultant lace a satiny veil to obscure the glass. The aroma of the hop flowers quite evident along with the fusel alcohol, malt sweet at the back, fresh and a portent of things to come this nose, start is ambrosial, rich in malt with the top a full in its feel. Finish is perky in its acidity, the hops omnipotent and the 10 percent ABV instantly warms the tummy, droughty aftertaste that maintains the bitterness alcohol and hops to the very last. One of the beers I wait for each year, a six pack for the fridge, and a case for the cellar.  Release 2002: On the pour a crystal clear deep Sanguineous color with the head majestic in size and frothy in texture with the lace a thick glutinous sheet. Nose is malt; hop floral, caramel, hints of butter and light fusel alcohol tones. Front is ambrosial, the top middling, the finish is devastatingly hopped, peacefully acidic, the aftertaste is beastly alcohol bitter, a major league Belly Warmer to boot"". Oh God, how I love this magisterial brew, its a Jekyll and Hyde beer, good at the start, brutal at the finish.  Release 2001: The beer pours a deep ruby color with a portly reddish-brown head that is semi-creamy and after its decomposition a fine sheet of lace forms to cover the glass. Nose is buttery, sweet, hints of brown sugar, and traces of hops. Begins malt sweet with the top full in its feel and the carbonation moderate, the acidity moderate, also the finish is loaded with hops and the aftertaste dry and alcohol bitter with the 10 percent ABV warming the tummy.

It must be the big body that makes the light bend (but the big body is not the syrupy business of an EKU 28 that requires it to be served very cold...but that's another subject).  I tried this beer before and chose not to review it since I had previously reviewed Arrogant Bastard and thought Double Bastard to be too much ABV to be worthy of a review.

Pours a deep crimson. Not much head, maybe you can blame my pouring, but what's here is dense and leaves a thick sheet of cascading lace on the glass.  A rich and sweet maltiness permeates the first shot to my nose, followed by faint hop undertones. And again on taste, malt takes the lead and leads slowly -- oh so slowly, the metaphors I could attach to this transition are better left unsaid, it's pornographic -- into a spicy hop aftertaste. The high alcohol content is not overpowering, it's warming. Warming and, of course, arrogant.  This beer punches you in the face and massages your soul with its strength and balance.

147,1056,bditty187,4.83,"Four bombers of this elusive beast landed in my possession thanks to my cousin Scott in Las Vegas and thanks to DESTRO for all of the information needed to track it down.  Double Bastard seems fitting enough for my 600th review on BA.  Dark crimson-brown in hue with coppery highlight, it is fairly dense in the middle with great color depth, a finger and a half of light beige head was impressively fluffy with great retention. As I quaffed unorganized sticky lace was produced. As a whole this is a lovely beer in appearance. The bouquet has more balance than I was expecting, the maltiness is has great depth, there is a touch of sweetness upfront, toasty behind the sweetness and caramely in the finish, the hoppiness is noticeable but more restrained than I was expecting, in no way is that a negative assessment. The hops in part an aroma of pine and grapefruit. The nose is very inviting. One sip of this nectar and I swear I got misty-eyed! Oh momma is this tasty! Upfront the palate has a quick burst of alcoholic heat that is swiftly encompassed by a rush of thick, hearty hop bitterness with a forest of tasty pine trees and groves of grapefruit. The hoppiness is long-lasting and powerful, as conceived by Stone the massive malty qualities close the beer with a big, sweet, caramely thud. It is huge in sweetness but far from cloying. The threesome between the alcohol heat, hops bitterness, and malt sweetness is beautiful in its grace, threatening in its power, and orgasmic in its taste. The huge flavors all work in harmony, each taking center stage on different sips. The aftertaste is so great you have to sit back in your chair and ponder the beauty that resides in your glass. I might be gushing but it is absolutely worth the praise. Full bodied, period, there is nothing medium about it, the strong malt backbone and firm carbonation creates a mouthfeel that is sturdy enough to support the big taste. Arrogant Bastard was great but swill in compassion to its older, angrier brother. Even with the whopping alcohol potency it is highly drinkable. It is quite the belly warmer. What a great beverage, it is as simple as that. If you have not tried this demon yet I highly advise you do. Wow!  2003 Release.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Holy crap, I could easily find myself into trouble over this beer. I have never been disappointed by the Stone brewing Co. and this beer was the best of 23 beers at my latest beer tasting. Poured a luscious golden colorl; so provocative that I barely stopped to smell. The smell showed its alcohol content more than the flavor. Actually, I honestly expected some sort of fruity overtones to cover the high ABV of this beer. But in Arrogant Bastard style, they make no excuses for their beer; you can taste hops, alcohol and thats about it. Surprisingly, this made for an enjoyable experience.

The head left behind a fine lacing that coats the inside of the glass. The aroma was a wallop of floral hops, and sweetish smoky malts...wowsers! The taste matched the aromas well: Huge roasty sweet malts, rounded out with an equivelently powerful bitterness. This is the classic Stone roastiness I am tasting. This is a huge, in your face, MoFo of a beer... a big beer for big beer lovers...like me! The mouthfeel was large, full, smooth, and completely satisfying.

As I take in another breath, the malt seems to be a bit more dominating that the pine but wait, the taste will get the hops into play. Yes, the flavor is outstanding.

Initially pine, hops, and alcohol are the backdrop of a very aggressive aroma. Fresh hops abound in the smell. The first taste is malty and quite sweetas you work through the glass, the malt aspects of the aroma become more and more intense. A little spice and a lot of fruit tastes. A really nice mix of sensations. After a few sips the alcohol warming sets in. Big, soft, full mouthfeel. The mix of flavors blend into a huge and bitter hop finish.

Mohagony color with auburn highlights and an airy tan head that dissipated quickly. The nose is citrusy, hoppy, malty, and strong in alcohol. The taste was super complex. Starts off with a thick, sappy malt syrup flavor then follows with an acidic taste with some sweetness (grapefruit w/sugar added). Alcohol comes in strong and throws me back.

The body of this beer is full and has a viscous feel to it. Mouthfeel is actually quite creamy. This, along with the nice taste, leads to a high drinkability even though it's 10%. The taste is quite exotic. A virtual cornucopia of fruit flavors. Passion fruits. Pineapple. Ripe melon. Grapefruit rind. All this is accompanied by a noticeable EtOH heat and a high alpha acid hop bitterness. The malt tones are what really make this beer great though. The toffee and caramel tones are quite delicious.

Bitter hops that in some ways remind me of some kind of stout or porter, as the bitter aftertaste hangs around for a while.

I take a sniff. My fear that this would be ""like Arrogant Bastard, but moreso"" were unfounded. The scent doesn't even remind me of Bastard except for the citrus constituent, and even that is not immediately detectable. The smell is sharply hoppy with a sweet citrus overtone.  I take a taste, and... Mmmm. This is much more balanced than Bastard. It's tasty, astringent, woody, and malty, with plenty of molasses and a hint of smoke. It's really impressively complex, and with each sip I become more amazed at the elaborate and languorous progression of flavors. First comes a malty, woody, slighty smoky taste. Then I get a wave of citrus which reconfigures itself into a hoppy bitterness. After that comes a scorched, ashy phase and finally a tart, bitter finish which lasts well over thirty seconds. Yes, I was actually so impressed with the taste progression that I timed it.  This beer has certain qualities of Belgians, most noteably a marked complexity. However, it's most definitely its own animal, and unmistakably American. I'll be getting more of this.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Malts up front, enormous brown sugar and butterscotch all over the palate, then huge hops come barrelling through, unbelievably fresh, flowery hops! grapefruity and tannic; alcohol warmth in midpalate and is that rosemary?! rye whiskey? Wolloping mouthfeel is just body, body, body that BITES; firm, pervasive, lingering. Drinkability gets high marks because you just keep coming back to explore the flavors. In a word? Vast.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,taez555,5,"This beer poured a dark brown ruby red body with a small tan head.  The nose was a dark, sweet malt smell. Soft citrus tones. Sweet and actually a little fruity. A slight touch of bread and biscuit even.  This beer was very thick and fully bodied. Lots of dark malts, with big juicy fruit with a strong citrus hop taste. It basically starts off very juicy, almost like an apple. It then proceeds into this dark malt taste, and then... it's followed by a huge, very loose, centennial type high alpha acid hop taste. Smooth and very present, but really all over the place hop wise.  Overall I was really impressed by this beer. I'm sure the description doesn't do it justice. I've never been a big fan of the arrogant bastard. I can admire it, but it just seems like all the flavors are stuck together as if it's coal being pressed into a diamond. This though.... The flavors are all there, it's very drinkable, and just very tasty. A superb beer, my new favorite from Stone.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,byrd,4.28,"Double Bastard pours with a large frothy head that is quite long lasting. The head eventually dissipates to a thick light brown lace. Reddish brown in color and clear, yet becomes hazy on later pours and white sediment eventually collects on the bottom of the glass. This brew is wonderful, but tough for me to wrap my arms around. The aroma is strong with notes of dark fruit and caramel malt. I picked up some slight vinous notes on the nose as well, along with loads of hops and alcohol. The start is smooth with dark fruits and a touch of oak and alcohol (rum, whiskey, bourbon, cant really put my finger on it). The hops kick in mid swallow, and last through the finish. Alcohol melds with all the piney, grapefruity hops and leads to a rather warming finish. Some roasted notes are also noticeable in the end reminding you that the malts have never faded from the picture. The aftertaste lasts forever. Rich, complex brew. At 10% ABV, this is one that is great to enjoy slowly during an evening. Flavors develop even more as the brew warms a bit, making a slow paced drinking of this brew even more rewarding.  I bought 4 of these this winter, and have made sure to put one aside for next year. The rest won't make it through the month.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

Taste is well.... some people can find malt in there, well all I taste is hops, hops and more hops. Mouthfeel starts out smooth and mildly sweet, then what rears it's mightly head? hops, hops, and more hops! To me this is just another IPA, more than a Strong/old ale. A true hop lovers dream.

147,1056,Starchild,4.77,"When I used to think West Coast, I would imagine Sierra Nevada Pale ale, but Im starting to picture big bold hoppy beers like this. Stone has displaced my notion of the west. Great pour into my chalice and perfect accompaniment from Metallica with Welcome Home. Great garnet color with just a ring of foam around the sides of the glass after the foam head dissipated. Big bold taste. Its heavy on the hops and heavy on the alcohol. Some pine, pepper, citrus going on juxtaposed by spices. I always wonder if my reviews become biased at I drink a 22 oz 10 percent bomber. Anyway, I love how this beer in writing and taste embodies Stone.Im not sure if one brew speaks realms about any another brewery. I bought three of these and Im regretting not buying a case.

147,1056,Lafe,4.59,"Hated by many, loved by few. Loved by me.  Pouring this bastard revealed a lovely reddish caramel color, and released the most amazing malty aroma I've had from any beer. What the smell promised, the taste delivered. First on the palate was an almost confusing explosion of flavor lorded over by a malty sweetness and quickly followed by a punch of hop bitterness. The high alcohol lurks in the background, but is evident. After the chaos subsides, you're left with a malty caramel aftertaste, and a lingering bitterness.  This beer is far sweeter than I expected, almost like a barleywine, but the alcohol flavor and roasted notes make it seem almost dry. There is a lot of complexity in the flavors of this beer, and they change delightfully as the beer warms.  Very low carbonation, and not much head, but still a fringe of lace that follows the surface of the beer to the bottom of the glass.  I love this beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,benmiliron,4.38,"This one has been in the house for almost a week and I finally just cracked it open. Listening to ""Master of Puppets"" while I drink and review this as it seems appropriate. First impression is thick, molasses-like, nearly syrupy. Smell of malt knocks you over, but hop fragrance not very noticeable, which I prefer, but the malt aroma is very nice. Couldn't get much head out of this one either, but the Bastard cares not.  First taste: holy shit. it's all about the malt here; and the malt hits you like a freight train on steroids. Underlying alcohol plays with the malt on your tongue.  A few more swallows: sugarless caramel, chocolate and coffee. Dry, but not overly dry. 10% alcohol packs a punch.  Halfway through: just phenomenal blend of malt. This is what malt was meant to do. More hops would be interesting, but might interfere.  Finishing: I thought it too thick at first, but with a lot of food in my belly, I'd be able to drink this lovely brew all night (though I couldn't afford it!) A lesson on the beauty and oft-forgotten capabilities of malted barley. Thank you Stone Brewing!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,oggg,4.82,"2003 Double Bastard Bomber  What the heck type of beer is this? I figured it'd be a double IPA or something, who knows. Certainly not a barleywine, IMHO.  Appearance wise, you can't tell what you're in for. Dark orange brown, nice head.  Then you get the aroma, and you expect, oh hey, a nasty bitter IPA is coming up. Anything that smells this wonderful is going to wring my tongue with bitterness.  You do indeed get hit with a marvelous hop bite... a hop gnash... king kong size, mac truck bitterness. I've never had anything this bitter. Marin Brewing White Knuckle, maybe... But the malt backbone, the caramel, the malt, the malt is the key. It starts strong and ends stronger and really keeps the bitterness in perspective. The bitterness does not linger and you're left with sweet malty caramelly chewiness.  I just saw that this beer is in the Strong/Old Ale category. I guess that would be appropriate. No winey taste of a barleywine here. At 10%ABV, you don't notice it AT ALL. After one 16oz glass, I was flying high. I let my roommate taste it, and he didn't notice the alcohol at all either, so it wasn't just because I was in heaven. Why on earth is it in a freakin bomber? Because after you wake up, you can finish the rest of it and start you're trip back to heaven all over again.

147,1056,tavernjef,5,"Wowee, wow, wow, what a fantastic beer! The beer Gods from Stone have bestowed this upon us for a reason, because to know heaven you must pass through hell! This is pure pleasure and make no mistake you will pay by nights end. Pours a deep firey tawny amber brown, settles a bit darker in the chalice glowing of newly created lava from the earths crust as it procedes to grow a tall, firmly thickened, whipped froth of tannish wonder. Fades ever so slowly like a dieing fire to a thin ring and a hazy skim across the liquid leaving massive sticking amounts of webby laced sheets. Aroma appears stronger then smoke, more like heat from an oven with mounting sweet caramel, lightly burnt, darkened tropical passion fruits, earthy crispness of deep woods pineyness. Malts are king in this world of aroma, ruling with a mighty pitch fork that pokes at the hops as if to say ""Ha, ha... Try to take my throne you measly weed"". Taste is where it leads you down the path of whats about to become a head full of everything thats tempting. Complexing malts are forest fire big, tons of great semi sweet caramel, thick and thicker yet, flowing in and out of scorched and deeply ripe dark fruityness, pineapple, mango, plum, and raisins bursting within with a light burntness touching everything. Its calmingly smooth and far to creamy for such a fire to burn, but yet it does, and it builds with a wind of hops thats burning up brush of small dwindling pine, dried leaves, and wood. Incredibly balanced bitterness is deep and crackly over the musculature of the big boned skeleton of malts. Alcohol never makes its presense felt til it finds its way to the head where it smokes out any notions of all before it. You remember liking this thing you enjoyed the next day but are now lurking around like a zombie wondering how in the hell did I survive such a dance with the flames of a devil. F*cking great stuff!! Can't wait to dance again with this dark nectar, but not any time soon, as not to become a devils second hand. I hopefully have learned my lesson. Why did they have to put this in a bomber?

147,1056,Shiredave,4.67,"Bottle diatribe/ public service rant against contract brews is hystarical. It gets even funnier as you drink and look up words in the dictionary. Hazy, ruby brown, sporting a gooey biege head atop that looks like kreusen on fermenting wort in primary. Lace drips all around the tulip glass. Aroma is all juicy ale-fruit and crushed wildflower petals- clean and pungant but not overpowering. Up front the flavor is ripe spiced fruit - sweet red watermelon and vanilla with a sort of nutmegy thing goin on. Hot red pepper and pine needle hop bite takes over aggressively, sending grappling hooks of bitterness into the tongue and throat. Mouthfeel is perfect. Big barleywine body, slick and oily feel w/out being real heavy and alcoholic. Lush, creamy malt coats the mouth as a thin barrier against the citrus and pine hop barrage. Warm bitterness and slow Tequilla like burn lingers forever. 2003 bottle which I think now I should have sat on for a while longer. The big malt body and flavor are there, waiting for the confligration of hop activity to calm thier little green asses down so balance and order can take hold. Remarkable marriage of Classic British malt sweetness and west Coast hop flavor and intensity. One of the top barleywines Ive ever had, and in the Top 10 on my 2000+ beer list.

The smell is sweet with a fruity, almost grapefruit like quality. The taste is smooth, with a heavy dose of hops. It has almost a syrupy consistency to it as you sip, but a pleasant sweet aftertaste. Strong malt flavors as well, more so than the regular Arrogant Bastard. It's amazing to me that this beer is 10% ABV the way it goes down. The alcohol taste is not overpowering, and the fruity hops and malt make it almost unoticable. I wouldn't reccomend trying to finish more than one bomber at a sitting due to the high alcohol content. With it's drinkability though, the taste would allow you to do so. This is a straight up American barleywine with an ass kicking hop profile with malt balance.

I just love the smell of this beer. It's smell is obveously familliar to Arrogant Bastard but the harsh hop and pine scents are tamed down quite a bit, and replaced by a much maltier scent. The flavour is perfect. It starts out with a huge hop kick and then settles into a nice carmel flavor with a slight bittersweet aftertaste. The taste of pine is there too, but not nearly as much as Arrogant Bastard. As the beer warms, the hop bite becomes more subtle and the warming alchohol and malt flavors come out much more.

Lace clung well to the sides of the goblet.  The aroma was grapefruit and caramel off the start with a slight kick of alcohol. The taste was unbelievable. A roasted malt backbone holds together the citrus and spruce flavors from the hops. Caramel sweetness and some brown sugar tones combined with some kinda spiciness, maybe coriander; hide the high ABV in this Bastard. This has to be one of the most well balanced ales I've had.  Nice chewy thickness with the perfect amount of carbonation, this coats the mouth and slides down the throat. And that fact scares the shit out of me.

147,1056,ithacabaron,3.8,"2003 bottling.  Pours a deep cloudy amber with a small head that quickly retreats to little more than a coating.  Smell is rotting grapefruit rind (not a bad thing, mind you) and citric acid, with a slight black pepper spiciness.  Taste is quite pungent, and lacks the malt to back the hoppiness up (although this is quite malty). Don't be mistaken, there is quite a bit of alcohol in here (the alcohol is not phenolic, but clean, crisp, and entirely noticeable) but it is thin in nature, sort of like an immature Brooklyn Monster Ale.  Drinkablility is low, if only because one would have a hard time rising from their chair after a bomber of this. No one needs to drink a bomber of barleywine. Drinkability is improved by pairing with food -- I had mine with some roquefort, which was a nice ""meet cute.""  This is very young and green, and overly hopped -- and yes, I know that's the point. Would love to see this sold in a 12 oz or a nip bottle, but this would be the perfect size to break out at a dinner party, with snifters for all, and the larger format is better for aging.

147,1056,ManekiNeko,4.65,"22 oz bomber of the 2003 release served slightly chilled in a Trois Pistoles goblet.  Appearance: Hazy dark ruby liquor topped with a scanty beige head that's quite short lived. Smallish bits of lace are left on the glass.  Smell: Glorious grapefruit, pine, pepper, circus peanut candy, and caramel malt aromas. Nicely pungent. I also caught a mildly soapy smell once or twice.  Taste: Painfully bittersweet initial assault followed by some raisiny caramel malt sweetness. Lingering pine aftertastes. Alcohol flavors lurk menacingly in the background, packing heat.  Mouthfeel: Slight burning sensation as this goes down, but it's quite pleasant. Bracing and heavy in body, this is reminiscent of a really really hoppy barleywine in feel.  Drinkability: This is sadistically good. Almost everything about this beer is meant to challenge to the worthy and punish the unworthy.

Has a clear cinnamon color with a ¾ blotchy, firm tan/beige head that left a decent amount of sticky lace around the glass. The smell was more subdued than anticipated. Still, the spruce and grapefruit notes are there and some caramel. As it warmed, hints of alcohol leach out too. The taste was a direct hit from a hops bomb. Plenty of resinous grapefruit peel and piney hops juice yet not completely overpowering as it coats the tongue. Some sweet candy-ish flavor noted but not very much else in terms of malts or other flavors. The alcohol content shows itself with a nice bit as DB warms, leaving a soothing warming sensation in the finish. The feel was full-bodied, thick and syrupy and smooth as the viscous brew coats the palate. I almost felt like getting a knife and fork for this beer. Even after slowly putting away this bomber, I was still wondering if the floor would soon rise up to greet me, such is the alcohol content.

Rich dark (cooked)caramel taste with hints of fig and grapefruit rind. The finish leaves the tongue smooth with hints of pine. The mouth is very complex the brew starts very very smooth and silky and then as the brew rolls down the throat the mouth gets dry with a hop pucker of dark fruits. It leaves you wanting more.

The alcohol is very evident in the aroma. Fruits (grapefruit?), malts, and the alcohol are the main parts of this most powerful aroma. The malts are strong in the taste and it has a syrup-like characteristic. Grapes and caramel were upfront in the flavor along with a strong alcohol taste. Almost reminds me of red wine in the aroma ... Great beer. Loved it. The description on the back of the bottle is spectacular as well.

147,1056,RoyalT,5,"Preparation  I popped an Arrogant Bastard for comparison purposes and thought it might be interesting to do the review in this manner. Not only is this my 400th review, but its also my 39th birthday. Cheers!  Appearance  This came out a beautiful brown, lighter than the Arrogant Bastard but with a bigger head. I knew after a few minutes that it was not going down for a while, so I left it for five minutes or so.  Smell  The sharp, complex hops come out slowly and very tight. I left it again to warm a bit and came back to a smack on the olfactory bulb. The toasted malt balance is there as well, but this is all about the awesome Stone hops.  Taste  This has a little bit more malt balance than the Arrogant Bastard. Otherwise, it is surprisingly similar. It seems a bit more refined, though. The extraordinary complexity of the hops is astounding. Every type you can think of sends a delegate to this gathering of electives.  The malts have to be huge just to get noticed, and they are. Theres actually some sweetness to this one, mostly caramel and table sugar.  Mouthfeel  Full-bodied and bitter, but with a touch of offsetting caramel on the cheeks. This ale is smooth, smooth, smooth. Not a hint of alcohol that I could pick up. Unbelievable!  Drinkability  What makes the Arrogant Bastard a shade from perfect, IMHO, is the lack of refinement and harmony of flavors (which could probably be relegated with a little cellaring). The DB has it all, and IMO can not be improved.  Update  The 2005s just came out (11/10/05) so I culled one out of the cellar box before tucking it away. Its tight and not opened up yet, but man the hops are raging and the malts are in full effect.

Nonetheless, an enticingly attractive brew that screams for one's attention. Resinous, sappy, piney hops dominate the nose, while the lion's share of sweet malt appears to keep the hop notes in check. Grapefruity, piney hops smack the palate around at first, though as the beer warms, a sizeable, lightly toasted malt profile introduces itself, expounding lavishly sweet caramel flavor to the near-dominant flavors that the members of the lupulin family emit. Fresh pineapple notes linger, as well. A touch of alcohol is evident on the finish, but hardly enough to be overly distinguishable. The full, round mouthfeel is viscous, oily and sappy all at once. Drinks quite well for a beer of ten percent ABV, but the effects certainly introduce themselves shortly after the emptying of the bomber.

Powerful malty, hoppy aroma and super fresh. Can also detect a malt graininess and slight fruitiness. Really smooth and syrupy mouthfeel with a nice kick of hops at the end, yet not overly bitter. Chewy and resiny that sticks to your mouth like peanut butter. I detect pineapple in the flavors along with a super blend of hops and malt. This is one fantastic brew! I would almost peg it for an Imperial IPA because it has similar qualities to many I've sampled.

The Stone Brewing Company gave birth to this double bastard on November 3, 2003 (release day) and there I was, ready to reap the rewards of time and place.  The huge beer in front of me was a sensory journey par excellence. From the lovely cream-crowned rusty amber body to the nose of multi-themed beer ingredients to the overwelming tastiness, this was a journey to remember. The beer is so complex with its huge malt backbone to its overhopped balancing act, the waves of taste and aroma come as an onslaught to the senses. Heavy in alcohol and warming of the innards, the barleywine-like body pushes the limit.

147,1056,Rumrunner,4.61,"Consumed at Naja's. 2003 vintage. One big Mug.  May the onslought of my taste buds and the hedonistic way in which they enjoyed this ale be remembered by me for a long time.  A deep ruby mahogany color that hypnotizes the drinker. It draws the gaze closer. The bubbles rise to the top at the double quick. They jockey for position and form lines as if going in to battle. The head they form is thick and it stays with the ale. Surrendering slowly. The beige lace coats the glass to the end. Awesome. Scents are pushy grapefruit rind and resiny pine. They come to the forefront and have no sympathy for the malt and caramel scents trying to flaunt their images. The spices and perfumes that rise to the nostrils seem unintended. Hidden but noticed. The alcohol is very potent and pushes the rest aside to be noticed and is a final warning. ""Should I venture further?"" But of course.  Oh what an ale. The flavors are so perfectly matched and unique it is a cruel trick. A big syrupy malt flavor pushes on the taste buds. A sweet caramel beckons. The next wave is big piney hops. Resin and a milder rind. A flavor of deep unsweetened grape mixes with a clove flavor and makes a statement before a very heavy alcohol blends and tries to become the focus. This is enveloped by perfume and spices. These flavors, as the bastards children, hold this ale together. All battle for the right to be dominent but all must stand down and blend together. Unity in diversity must prevail.  It feels strong sticky and overbearing. The carbonation is all business and never relaxes. Strong until the final sip. A real bastard.

147,1056,Gueuzedude,4.05,"2004 Release, Sampled November 2004 Wow, this is certainly pungent and fresh smelling, it is a solid punch of citrus hops that is approaching the level of candied fruit. I get notes of apricot, tangerine, ruby red grapefruit, tangelos. The aroma is really quite interesting, and before my first sip of this beer, I am going to hazard a guess that this is the best part of this beer. The beer itself is a brilliant deep amber color that is topped by a creamy tan head.  The taste is definitely not quite as intense as the aroma. It is full bodied, with a certain creamy fullness to it. The taste is definitely hoppified, with a nice mixture of apricot, grapefruit, and an astringent herbal character. This beer is not overly bitter, in fact the bitterness is pretty well in balance, there is a lingering astringency that sticks to my tongue long after the beer has slid down my throat, this seems to be from the copious amounts of hops added. I am sure this will fade with time, but so will the fresh hoppiness that I am enjoying right now.  There are some notes of hot alcohol in the finish as well, but nothing overwhelming. This is not nearly as malt dominated as I remember last years being. Basically this beer is quite tasty, and quite a bit better than I have previously given credit for.  2003 release, Sampled November 2003 A brown head, that as you pour starts deceptively small and then blossoms in my tulip Duvel glass to about 3 inches (7.62 cm for the non-Americans) thick. A hazy amber color with beautiful garnet notes when held up to the light. A malty hoppy aroma, evokes the thought of a sticky sweet hop smell. Surprisingly, very malty was my first thought upon tasting this beer. The hops are there, but not over the top and in your face. This is a thick bodied beer that seems to leave a coating film even after I have swallowed. Definitely hoppy, the more I sip the more I can detect the bitter finish in this beer. A syrupy hop flavor hits your tongue at first, and then finishes with a drying bitterness. Rating 3.7/3.5/3.5/4.0/3.5/3.5",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,winomark,4.37,"2002 Release that had been staring at me for about 6 months.  Appearance: Pours an ominous copper/deep caramel with a nice head, considering the 10% ABV.  Aroma: Copious amounts of hops give an amazing balance with the wuite noticable alcohol sweetness.  Taste: Suberb balance of the hops, malt, and alcohol. Arrogant Bastard on steroids, yet dare I say, more balanced? Fantastic!  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: WOW! A Fabulous beer! Luxurious, brash, elegant, and definately arrogant. Too bad this is a limited release, because I could see myself enjoying this one quite often.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Darkale,4.4,"Slightly cloudy red-brown body. Head is fat-bubbled and light tan in color, thick and long lasting. Lacing is so thick it's 3D.  Ripe fruit aroma, faint chocolate, sweet and nice.  Slick and graceful mouthfeel. Rich deep and fruity. Chewy, thick, and profound. Wow. Only a few beers make me say wow. Wow. This is an exceptional beer. Marvelous and complicated and somehow in balance, like sumo wrestlers performing a ballet. I would never have believed that there could be a step up from Arrogant Bastard, and there is. It's darker, more burning, more like a barley wine, with a high and sharp sweetness.  I spent an entire afternoon with this beer, following its journey from cold to warm, and loving every step.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,philipt,4.12,"This is a monster of a beer..monster hops...monster malt...monster alcohol.  Ruby color with a hint of orange and a mediocre head. This beer is heavy on the hops in both the smell and taste. Significant malt sweetness but somewhat overshadowed by the hops. There is an initial explosion of caramel with a hint of cookie dough before being slapped across the face by tremendous hoppiness. Maybe a year or two of aging could smooth and balance this beer. The alcohol in this beer is not over done and, in fact, fits nicely with the beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,beergeek279,4.82,"2003 Edition, served in the 22 oz. bomber. The color is a dark amber, with a wisp of head, more than expected for a 10% beer. The smell is a nice sweet (barleywine) malt mixed well with hoppiness. The taste starts with a malt sweetness, then the hops hit like a sledgehammer, and a lingering bitterness remains long after the sip is gone; alcohol is barely even noticable. Mouthfeel is fairly heavy, but more than acceptable. Drinkability-wise, I'd drink these till my mouth went numb (which sadly might be sooner rather than later!)  I didn't think it was possible to improve on a classic like Arrogant Bastard, but apparently I was wrong! Despite the 100 IBUs and 10% ABV, the beer somehow manages to remain well-balanced, and a true treat for the coming cold season (and for those in San Diego, the chilly 70 degree season ;) ). A truly great beer and one that I imagine I'll be waiting for every year!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Ellbert,3.92,Appearance: Pours a nice brownish/red color. Looks blood red when held up to the light. Very clear. Has a nice tan head that slowly fades.  Smell: Pretty weak. A faint smell of floral hops hits the nose and not much else.  Taste: Taste is great. It starts of very sweet and mild and the the alcohol fades in with the hops trailing short behind. It leaves a sweet malty and spicy alcohol flavor in your mouth begging for more.  Mouthfeel: Fairly thick with subtle carbonation. Small bubbles slightly tickle your tongue.  Drinkability is fairly good for such a strong brew. Not too much to keep me from finishing the bomber but much too strong to open another one.,Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,far333,3.48,"Dark honey colored with a haze that makes it look thick enough to spread like butter. An orangey beige head tops it off, but disappears quickly. Aroma is light, but smells fruity and sweet with alcohol vapors rushing upward (do not pour near open flame). Flavor is sweet and big and rich. Some sweet malt and honey, hints of pear, finished with an alcohol tingle and burning on the back of the tongue and throat. Very warming and chewy flavor. I like this beer, but it tries too hard.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,marc77,4.48,"Clear deep garnet hue, covered by a light beige, dogged, dense head that yields exiguous lace. The aroma is comprised of a dominant buttery toffee and nutty carob combination, contrasted by a balmy, smoky pine wood and herb laced citrus hop nose. Swirling releases heaty ethanol and subtle fruitiness of a bourbon soaked fig character. Surprisingly well rounded and understated in aroma, but certainly ominously appetizing. Transient wash of burnt caramel sweetness incipient in flavor is promptly ensued and complemented by a combination of buttered sweet biscuit, freshly baked brittle and woody, fructose rich dried dates. Bellicose hop presence storms in mid palate, with both barbed bitterness and a deeply sappy, spruce and citrus pith hop flavor emerging concomitantly. This more than adequately tapers malt sweetness, and leaves a static, simplified, yet richly buttery toffee malt presence that mirrors that of the aroma. Full bodied and firmly dextrinous, with a oily, unwhipped heavy cream like viscous mouthfeel. A late resurgence of biscuit couples with the constituent citrus and stately diacetyl, lending a rich, bitter marmalade on singed toast impression. Finishes clean and simply bitter, with a mellow roasted grain and alpha acid extension. Agreeable alcohol warmth surfaces after a deliberation and envelopes the palate, throat and tummy. A truly delicious brew, that's reminescent of their Old Guardian in overall character, but is seemingly more balanced and drinkable. Double Bastard is a deceptively mild mannered strong ale that integrates robust hop character into a malt driven flavor profile. Superlatively drinkable. Another wonderful Stone brew...",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,OldFrothingSlosh,4.5,"""Ye Shall Know the Bastard, and the Bastard Shall Set Ye Free.""  Presentation: 2002 release that's been sitting in my beer fridge for about 8 months, staring at me, tempting me.....daring me to attempt to tame it. ""Surgeon General on amphetamine"" warning on the back explaining the dangers resulting from the consumption of the vile atrocity contained within the bottle.  Appearance: Do I see evil spirits escape from the bottle when the cap is removed? Poured a very deep and dark copper in color. Tan-colored head sits regally (dare I say...arrogantly?) atop the swirling liquid beneath it. Monstrous lacing of the glass as I try to consume this beer before it consumes me.  Smell: A veritable onslaught of intense aromas pound your nostrils like a jackhammer. Raw sugar cane sweetness clashes with the pine hops whilst the alcohol fumes entwine the citric hops in a death squeeze. Oh! The Humanity!  Taste: From the moment this concoction first assaults your taste buds to the last remnant of flavor dies away, everything about this beer screams intensity. Alcohol-soaked dark fruit appear for but an instant, only to be followed by a toffee-caramel flavor. Impossible bitterness rules over all, gloating in its supremacy. Shards of malty sweetness pierce the cheeks, drawing blood that the alcohol only burns more. You fall to your knees, unworthy of the beast that is now within you. As it reaches your stomach, you feel the warmth of the hideousness begin to envelop you, waiting to spontaneously combust you and consume your entire being. Sadly, you were explicitly warned of the impending doom associated from partaking of this entity...yet you continue.  Mouthfeel: An exquisite mix of incredible smoothness combined with the raw burn of the alcohol make for a truly remarkable mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Should I enjoy the ass-kicking this beer has imparted on me? Yes....indeed I should. This is one amazing beer. Such a complex and intense beer. The flavors got warmer and richer as the beer came to room temperature. Not one to quaff, but rather sip and enjoy as the twin gargoyles pound your into oblivion.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

This beer's malts and hops reach out and grab you places you may not want to be grabbed. ( it could be VERY painful) Flavor is full and complex. Brown sugar, molasses, hop spiciness, grapefruit and .. are all here, and assault your taste buds. This is one kick-ass beer. Not for the timid. Taste is thick, somewhat chewy and a little high alcohol oily. Mouthfeel is full, round and expansive. Finish is clean and surprisingly smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and warming.

147,1056,UnionMade,3.51,"Talk about over the top. I think this beer is the definition of the term.  The beer pours a deep mahogany color. Bloody red when put up to light. Menacing. A thick topping of frothy head appears from it's depths, reminding me of the foam that forms on the lips of a maddened attack dog hungry for flesh. Aroma is heady and decadent. An onslaught upon the olfactory glands. Monstrous malt, pale with a healthy dose of crystal malt goodness. Estery fruit, with notes of black cherry, fig and apple. Some toffee. Plenty of hops, without question. What else would you expect from Stone? Alcohol is certainly present, and this beer is ready to punch your teeth out. Flavor is incredibly malty, with tons of esters, black cherry, fig, currant, and apple. A slight peach flavor, in a brown around the edges way. Light toffee. Hops are massive of course, coming through the middle and finishing the sip. Plenty of citrus, as well as herbal qualities. A slight tang when coupled with the alcohol in the finish. Gigantic body, mild carbonation. Sort of chewy and way too sweet, particularly when the beer gets to room temperature. It's a pretty good beer, but so completely over the top that I doubt I'll ever buy it again. The beer is just way too intense, especially at first. The flavors are well-wrought, but sort of ham-fisted, in the way that it's trying so hard to assault you with everything in it's arsenal. A kick you in the teeth, spit on your face, then get up and give me twenty kind of beer.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,cokes,4.8,"Flames shoot forth from the fiery crimson pool of magma. Tan smoke fills the area overhead, but clears after several moments.  Charred aromas emanate outward. Crackling, sticky pine, engulfed apricots, charred pinapples, blackened caramel and seared brandy-drenched woodchips.  This is not a blisteringly hot inferno, but rather a creeping, encompassing torch. It wiggles its way into the oral cavity and ignites explosively.  It consumes all of the sweet kindling left unattended. Brown sugar scorches. Pineapples dance and sizzle on the grill. Plums shrivel and burn. Toffee melts and bonds with the teeth. Cotton Candy wilts and liquefies. Oranges turn brown, then black, then ashen gray. Mangoes do the same. So do limes. Raisins are reduced to a pile of dusty, glowing orange powder. A fruit-laden smoke fills the mouth.  The blaze rages and moves further back on the tongue. Roasty and toasty yet, but the conflagration has reached the hops. Citrus and tropical fruits leave their jellied resin behind. Pine trees are combusted, leaving behind a messy residue of clinging sap. The woody bark is fuel for a tempest that is rapidly gaining strength.  The wall of fire reaches the entrance to the esophagus and detonates in a fantastic alcoholic blast. The ensuing push floods the throat and mouth with a sticking Port shrapnel, as everything else is incinerated. The Port gains heat and becomes cognac. The cognac gains heats and becomes pure ethanol.  The blood is heated by this thick, but airy, semi-adhesive burst of fire. The warmed blood travels to the brain, where it first ignites the pleasure center. The face reflects the increased temperature and becomes red and the mouth draws up in to a smile. Affect is heightened. Flights of imagination and verbosity are common. Next, the sensory-motor complex is set ablaze. The eyes burn red, mirroring the status of the interior. Sirens reverbrate and hum within the ears. Balmy impulses are sent via the nerves to the outmost extremities. The whole body has been consumed. The brow emits sweat beads in an attempt to cool, but it is too late. The ""old brain"", source of the body's basic functioning, is overcome. The enflamed person becomes increasing sleepy and disorientated. Verbals cease, except for the basest formation of language, exemplified by mutterings such as: ""This is fucking awesome, man"", and ""Holy shit!""  The eyes close.  The ears ring louder.  The smile continues.  The fire ventures onward and outward from the limp body.  (2002 Release, courtesy of feloniousmonk.)",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,bigbelcher,3.97,like many of Stone beers this is a beer that is much better off if you give it time to age.

Mellow, on the tongue and tastebuds, at first, but soon sizzling with hops, flavor & booze, sweet boooze! Boom! Bam! Biff, bang, Pow!!! There is no relief, nor should one seek any, from this hoppy, malty onslaught!!! DAMN! I can't think of a tastier ale with this much strength, anywhere! The Double Bastard has seriously laid me to waste! Rich and delicious, and full and fruity and strong and BOOM!, SCHMANG! SCHWOOP!!!

There's no relief, no respite, no nothing, just the full-on fruity, hoppy explosion that is this BastardX2!!! How does it compare to my favorite, Bell's Third Coast Old Ale?

147,1056,Boto,4.7,"2002 bottle: Well here it is, another highly anticipated bottle from Stone. The beer pours a slightly reddish color. The head has a little bit of a cascade to it. The head is fairly thick, and lingers awhile. Very complex nose: it's hard to distinguish the individual aromas. What is suprisingly not jumping out at me are the aroma of hops. I've come to expect that in a stone brew. The taste is very rich. A huge maly sweetness that I'm sure is balanced by a large amount of hops that are just well hidden. The alcohol is also hidden.

147,1056,aaronh,4.65,"2002 Release.  Pours a captivating red-copper color with amber highlights. It is topped by a modest tan head that fades rather quickly, but leaves a thin film of foam atop the beer. The aroma is actually rather balanced, with a noticeable hop prescence and a wonderfully sweet and fruity malt aroma. Actually, the sweetness may dominate the aroma. The taste is delicious. Malty sweet, chewy flavors of roasted malt, caramel, malted milkshakes, and all kinds of fruit. A nice, mellow bitterness finishes off the palate very well, preparing the way for the next drink. An ever so slight alcohol note is detectable one drink, but not the next. ABV is expertly hidden. The mouthfeel is super-creamy, and must be experienced to believe. This is about as thin as Dom Delouise, and smoother than Billy Dee Williams. Drinkability is just too good, regardless of the ABV. Good thing this is a big bottle, or I'd be in tears about now. This is a beer to experience. Thanks to avylover for the trade. Who knows when I would have found this around here.

147,1056,Dantes,4.57,"Presentation: ~10oz. from draught in a tulip glass at The Blind Tiger&#8217;s Stone 12 event. 2001Vintage (1 of 6 kegs left). Served a bit cold. Cost: $5. (Also enjoyed: 2002 Vintage in a 22oz. bomber. $4.99 via mail order).  Appearance: A beer that shows very nicely in the glass, and probably even lovelier in a Shaker glass. A dark auburn color maybe a half-shade darker than the Arrogant Bastard, capped with a medium-thick ½&#8221; of foam, which resolved gradually to an opaque film.  Smell: Possesses a rich, lovely aroma composed of many elements: malt, fruit, hops, wood, and loam; buoyed by a firm hand of alcohol.  Taste: I was surprised that my first sensation was of sweetness, not bitter hops. However, this maltiness was quickly leavened by the complexity provided by components of citrus, wood, hops, and herbaceous spiciness. This is the rare beer that manages a great balance between a hoppiness and maltiness. Does finish &#8220;hot,&#8221; but not unpleasantly so. I would expect bottled DB to improve for some time.  Mouthfeel: Extremely creamy and viscous mouthfeel, without being syrupy or cloying. Really excels on draught, while the bottle is a bit thinner, coarser and more carbonated.  Drinkability: Eminently drinkable for such a strong, richly flavored beer. I had little trouble enjoying a full 22oz. bomber.  In British literature, a character may be described as &#8220;a man of parts.&#8221; No, this is not an obscene reference. It means someone who is good-looking, well-educated, and accomplished. In more cliched terms, a &#8220;Renaissance man.&#8221; Well, after all of that, Double Bastard is the beer equivalent. It looks like beer should look, it smells good, tastes good, and will knock you on your ass if you&#8217;re not respectful. For such a potent potable, this ale is well-balanced and delightful to drink (especially on draught). Don&#8217;t deny yourself the pleasure of making this beer&#8217;s acquaintance.  Bottom Line: The Jack Aubrey of beers; big, boisterous, but ultimately well-mannered, accomplished, and with a heart of gold.

Hops are in the background...but there for sure. The taste is a front-burner mix, dancing twixt a powerful maltiness and an in your face but not a palate blinding hop bitterness. Yeasty fruitiness seems to bridge the two flavor elements nicely. Alcohol taste takes a back seat to the interplay of malt and hops, it's not very noticable/felt at all.

147,1056,francisweizen,4.53,"*Update*  The 2002 is currently tasting like the 2001 did last year. It has a darker, murkier, reddish-brown colour and a smaller head with less retention. This 2002 version which has been aged for about a year and a half is definately more barley wine in style than the 2003 IMO. The mouthfeel is chewier and creamier than the 2003 and the drinkability may be a notch better as well. If I were to rate the 2002 it would probably get a 4.8 or a 4.9. Cheers!  2003: This years DB is a light red colour with a lovely, light beige creamy head. The aromas are all heavy roasted malts, citrus hops (cascades?), alcohol, and more. The taste is super rich and enveloping. I can taste various types of hops, nice heavy malts, a bit of booze, and some more undistinguishable flavors, all in a very perfect harmony. This has to be the most ""balanced"" version of DB to hit the shelves yet. Truly a wonderful brew that has a great creamy mouthfeel and the ultimate drinkability for a ""strong ale""  CLASSIC  2002: This is an excellent beer that pours a super clear dark reddish colour with a nice, fluffy, white head. This beer has aromas of alcohol, malts, hops, and other things. The taste is very alcoholic, very malty, very hoppy, very everything. The mouthfeel is slick and SUPER creamy and smooth and the drinkability is great for such a strong brew. This beer will certainly knock your socks off with its 10%abv and super intense flavors. This was very good, but to this BA it did not live up to the greatness of regular AB. This was just TOO big, and too alcoholic. It did not have the wonderful citrus-y flavors of the AB and the hops were a little less pronounced. Still, A classic! Cheers! -F  Thanks to Hyuga for the sample...beer mail me will ya!  2001: Sample provided to me by EyeChartBrew. It has a darker, murkier, reddish-brown colour and a smaller head with less retention. The aromas are more pronounced, alcoholic and less hoppy. This 2001 version which has been aged for about a year and a half is definately more barley wine in style than the 2002 IMO. The flavors meld together nicely and make a very nice sipping brew. The mouthfeel is chewier and creamier than the 2002 and the drinkability may be a notch better as well.

147,1056,dmarch,4.38,This is one of those beers that I could just feel is going to be good even before opening it. Pours a dark ruby color and has a well retained head. Aroma is big on malt and big on hops. I think it's safe to say this is a big beer. Initial tast is of butterscotch before the hops and alcohol kick in.

Pours a clear, deep chestnut in color with a thick, creamy, tan head that slowly settles to a thin layer and leaves a solid lace. A spicy aroma jumps out at first, malty with hints of nutmeg, dark fruits and grain alcohol. Taste is of alcohol, raisins, smoky malts. Much dryer than I expected. It sweetens up a little mid-glass just in time for the hop bitterness to make its presence known. Hints of pepper on the mouth-numbing finish. Big body, Big alcohol, Big malts, Big hops, It's just B.I.G. BIG! Smooth & oily mouthfeel and on the lower end of carbonation. Drinkability is very high.

(Would love to partake a whiff of an aged one) Taste was a malty body covered in apples, a great clean and clear barley, and some cherry and oak, too. Became earthy and woody as it opened, as well as a grapefruity development. An almost chewy malt finish.  In general a spritzy taste at first that awakens you without overpowering like the Arrogant Bastard does. Had a cool oil mouthfeel and a very smooth finish. Adds a yummy burp of sour fruit and hops (without the Stone saltiness or bitterness).  A serious barley with some hops that match and not overpower it, rounded out by many nuances.

147,1056,MJR,4.45,"2002 Release.  I was lucky enough to get a few bombers of this and was waiting for a special occasion to drink and review it. I suppose an ordinary Tuesday night after work is special enough...  Appearance: Pours a stunningly clear red with hints of orange. A light tan head starts out two fingers deep and holds it's size fairly well. Nice lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell: Aggressive aroma with lots of raw, pungent hops. Grapefruit, pine, the usual suspects here... Hidden underneath the hops is a hefty backbone of sweet malt that comes across as fruity and caramelly. Nice whiff of alcohol too.  Taste: Starts off by balancing the huge malt bill and massive hop flavor and bitterness. After the initial shock begins to wear off, the flavors start to come into focus: roasted and burnt malt, grapefruit, charred fruit, pine, caramel, and spicy alcohol. Very rich and BIG tasting! Finishes with a huge rush of warming alcohol. It would get a 5, but the heavy alcohol flavor prevents that. I know it's 10%abv, but there are other beers with more alcohol that's more well hidden...  Mouthfeel: Rather thick and syrupy with a dry mouthfeel from the high alcohol. This is a big one...  Drinkability: Not unlike the effect their Ruination IPA has, my mouth is getting a bit numb as I work my way through the bomber. Simply put, this is one big-ass brew and it takes guts to drink it!

Smell: Fruity(mostly cherry), caramel malts and alcohol dominate the aroma. Taste: Very full bodied, thick and chewy mouthfeel. Flavors of cherry and caramel malt seem to dominate, however a well balanced bitterness is mixed in before an alcohol taste finishes off the sip. Reminds me of other barleywines like Old Horizontal or Bigfoot, but this beer seems to be much better balanced. Drinkability: I found this beer to be about average drinkability. The mild alcohol taste prevented me from taking large sips, but I couldn't stop my hand from automatically pouring another sip in after I swallowed.  Overall this is a good full flavored beer.

The head was pretty thick at first, but died down to a laceing. The head was a creamy white color. I thought that the taste had a little bit of a bite to it at first, but mellowed out after a while. It had a nice fruitt flavor, probably of the citrus origin, mixed with some caramel or lite chocolate. The aftertaste was kind of peppery, but not too bad. Being a bastard myself, I must say that this is one bastard of a beer, a double bastard that is. hehehe",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,zerk,3.95,"Pours a hazy light amber, with a persistant off white head. Aroma is perfumy and sweet, with caramel, floral, citrus, and pine notes. Flavor is very sweet and malty, beginning with caramel, then becoming somewhat buttery, with a very aggressive dose of spicy, citrusy hop bitterness. The flavors balance pretty well, but this beer is just BIG. It's bold in every facet. The moutfeel is oily and thick, with moderate carbonation. A great beer, although for regular consumption, not quite as drinkable as its little brother. Big thanks go out to DavidBanner for this bottle!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95

147,1056,CharlesRiver,4.75,"I have been waiting to try this for weeks. I had managed to buy a bottle and not touch it for two weeks. This Saturday night I broke down and I am glad that I did. Amber in color with almost no head even after an aggresive pour. The first thing that I noticed was how smooth this beer was. Hops, malt, blaaaaa, complex, overwelming, and delicious! Let this one warm up a bit in the glass, the flavors really come out then. A bit like a barley wine but even better. Very warming as it goes down. When my 22oz. bottle was gone I could have cried. I must get more!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,beernut7,4,"This beast pours into a deep amber color and a creamy off-white head. The aroma alone could knock you over, screaming of a major hop addition and a bold malt presence. The initial taste is like eating a lit cherry bomb. The gigantic malt sweetness couples with an otherworldly offensive bitterness on top of a smooth thick body. This brew definitely has an arrogant personality. This ale could take my place in a bar fight. I'd just sit back and let it kick everyone else's ass. I treid tasting a couple beers after this one and my taste buds were completely shot...useless to me for the rest of the evening. So drink up, but drink last.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,IPAlot,4.47,"I really felt quite violated after tasting this beer. As soon as my nose crossed the rim of the glass, the aroma impaled my head with its pungent decadence, and lodged there like some mind-controlling parasite from another star system, where it's planet's native atmosphere is a boiling cauldron of scrumptiously malty gaseous organic compounds. I had to give a 5 for smell because I could not see, with my limited insight, room for improvement. This heady rush reminded me of Old Wooly Barleywine from Big Time Brewery in Seattle (Excellent beer check it out limited distribution and availability). This beer is all about the malts up front. The thick, sweet flavors coat your mouth. I gave a 4 in mouthfeel because I can see this beer gaining another dimension with some nitro creaminess to balance the malts. Only after you have accepted the Double Bastard into your mouth do the hops make their presence known, which I feel is generally in a supporting role, though they successfully add to the complexity of this beer's sequence. Paying close attention reveals that the flavor profile is very well preserved. The aftertaste is a masterpiece, you can just sit there and continue tasting your last mouthful for several minutes. Like the best foods, this beer stays in your mouth long after its physical substance has passed to your nether-regions. All the while the aroma smolders in your nostrils with a potency that makes you wonder if your lungs are receiving enough oxygen to maintain vital metabolic processes. I had a Chimay Trippel (tap) immediately after this beer, and it's subtlety was dashed against the lingering presence of the Bastard. Have to remember next time to drink a palate cleanser before dropping 12 bucks on a Trappist ale. It was like coming back to your nice girlfriend after a tawdry encounter with an experienced older woman, and you don't feel guilty that you're bored with your girlfriend because it was worth every second. A landmark addition to strong american ales.  IPAlot  ps I had this bar at Mahar's in Albany (check the beerfly review this place is unreal). They had a raffle going for a *magnum* of 5th anniversary Arrogant Bastard. The bottle had a cork (obviously) and a big 5 on it, but I didn't look close, I just bought a ticket and offered praise, worship, and eternal servitude to any god who would bless me with a winning ticket.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,aracauna,3.86,"Pours a deep reddish brown with a nice darker than off-white head which is nice and foamy and lingering. The aroma is nicely caramelly malty with a slight hop bite. The flavor is big, rich, earthy malts and a long bitter finish. This is definitely a sipping beer as it's very hard to drink fast. When it nears room temperature, it starts to get a little too sweet and thick, but served just below cellar temp and this is an excellent beer. The mouthfeel is whipped, airy liquid cream.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,scottum,5,This may just be the best damn beer this side of...   ...anywhere.  Sooooo gooooooood!!!!!!   This beer is of special character. It is good and it knows it. A bit of a strong smoked fruity bite to it mellowing into a nice hearty roll down your throat smile. Pours dark brown with an offwhite head. It feels so good sliding down to the belly. Mmmmmm mmmmmmmm.  I think I'll buy one of those 3 liter bottles for a special occurance.  Any thoughts on how this beer will be given some time to rest?

It pours a deep dense amber with a nice white head, I would swear this is a Barleywine. Complex maltiness with the signature Arrogant Bastard hop flavors. This is an excellent beer. Without a doubt one of my favorites. A hearty thanks goes out to Xlperro who turned me on to this stuff.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,sinistersteve,4.03,"This is one mother of a beer. I think the lable should have a skull with crossbones to inform the consumer of what to expect. This beer has a full onslaught of malt and hops that will even take the most professional of beer drinkers down to their knees. This beer is not for the timid and even the worthy of his Arrogant brother may be no match for this beer.

147,1056,Bierman9,4.7,"29FEB04 - Am just about to finish another of these....damn...this Bier is so fucking good! Damn!!!  31DEC02 - Another winner from Stone! I had a small sip of this at Bukowski's when Greg Koch visited last Summer, but hadn't seen any until just a few days ago at my local bier store. A most pleasant, and welcome, surprize! DB pours a verrry attractive, clear, copper-chestnut color. Head begins as a rich, creamy layer, but recedes to a fine, thin coating atop the bier. It leaves a decent bit of lacework in the glass, too! Nose was quite strong, reminding me initially of some good barleywines. Loads of malty sweetness mingle with the big hop notes. Quite aromatic! The body of DB is well over medium, closing in on full; and it has a lovely, smooth feel on the tongue...almost chewy. DB kicks off with a big whack of strong, sweet malt, with some caramel poking it's nose in there. Hops come into play in a big way, with loads of citrusy notes and, as VENOM points out, a piney sort of flavor. Seems to be a bit more malty than the Arrogant Bastard. This bier is a big-time player, and it warms your innards nicely! I love it!! Zum Wohl!!  overall: 4.7 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 4.5  452",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,PhantomVodoo,4.6,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting to like this beer. Sweet, high malt and alcohol beers aren't among my favorites. But DB is different. Yes, it has a strong malt character that seems somewhat carmel in nature and obviously is high in alcohol, but this thing is hopped like an IPA. Flavor explodes the second it hits your tongue. But it's definitely not all about the malt. The hops do way more than just balance this beer. Hops seem piney in nature. DB finishes well although the 10% ABV is evident. Pours a dark coppery red with a nice tan head. Both malt and hops can be noted in the aroma. Very drinkable for a beer of this magnitude. Awesome beer with great malt AND hop character! Had this beer 2 days ago and I can't get it off my mind. I only wish I could get more, but I'll likely have to wait until next year. This was the first year Ohio's beer laws allowed Double Bastard in the state. Much to my dismay, the supply in bottles was gone before I attempted to purchase some. But all was not lost, a local pub had received 1 keg (according to the bartender there were only 2 shipped to the entire distributing area). I was lucky here because my freind and I drew off the last 2 pints. Next year I won't be tardy on the arrival of this one.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Wildman,4.92,"This beer poured a dark reddish amber color and formed a nice light tan foamy head that looked like a float subsiding and left circular lace. Some carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel, spices with a hint of the alcohol present. A flavor of malt, caramel with a touch of chocolate. The finish is sweet with a slight astrigent element to it. Another fine beer from Stone and another thank you to the Ohio lawmakers for letting get this.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,DarthMalt,3.81,"What a Bastard!  Beautiful dark-red amber. STANKIN' hop whiff along with smokin' hot, candy-apple esters, and an alcohol nose of a double+ bock.  I was expecting an arrogant, hop kick in the arse, but it seems the original gravity really shunts those lupulin glands down to size (chalk one up for the maltsters!). There's definitely a seasonal, barlywine-like appeal in here, but not as earthy.  Everything really peaks in the midtaste--hops sing their swan song, malt pervades every tastebud, and alcohol shoots flammable gases out your nose.  Finish is bitter, numbing, and gritty, like many a big beer. After a beer such as this, no other beers should be reviewed.  [This beer could be purchased solely for the diatribe on the back of the bottle]",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Dogbrick,4.28,"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. This beer is knock-your-socks-off strong. Who is worthy indeed?

147,1056,jreitman,4.85,"An absolutely amazing brew. A friend said it best when he said ""Holy S^&$"" upon his first sip. The beer is full of grapefruit and other cirtus aromas topped off with some caramel and sweetness that binds everything together. Dark red in color and nearly opaque with a nice bit of white head. The beer fills your mouth with flavors and has complexity off the charts but still comes off as somewhat delicate. Grapefruit, caramel, and a bit of pine jostle for dominance in the mouth and are followed by a nice dry and bitter finish. Definitely not a beer you want to drink quickly or you will a.) miss out on a lot of flavor and b.) be knocked on your ass from the alcohol. Suprisingly good at room temperature (had left a 3rd of the bottle sitting out) where the hops mellow out but the flavors are all still there. Truly amazing.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Myk,4.78,"22 OZ. of 2002 double bastard.  simply bliss. wow.  the appearance is brilliant. bright, clear ruby red color. thick, full, off white head that sticks to the sides of the glass.  the aroma is heavy with malt, carmel, and alcohol, slight earthy and citrus scent.  taste... AHHHHH. so complex. from the first sip, i was in love. it was well balanced, full bodied and coated my mouth and trout with yummy goodness. for being such a large beer ( 10% ABV) it is hard to imagine that thie baby could be so smooth in mouthfeel. full of syrupy/chocolate malt. alcohol and perfect flavor hops. pretty earthy and little bit of a piney taste. i cant quite pick out the exact citrus, since i dont eat many citric foods, but it is kinda deep, and low.  the finish.. DRY, malt and alcohol. this beer is so warming its like a a hundred degree day with no air conditioning. it warms with every sip. watch out because this will creep up on you. simply amazing.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,NeroFiddled,4.68,"2001 batch. 22 oz bottle. Pours a clear, very deep ruby-tinted russet brown with a densely creamy light tan head that holds extremely well and leaves some nice lace. Exceptional. The aroma offers bold notes of pineapple, soft grapefruit and berries as well as some grassy, earthy and piney hops - all of which reside above a candyish and lightly caramel tinged maltiness. The body is full with a very fine, median carbonation that's creamy and just slightly syrupy in the mouth.The flavor starts quite sweet, reveals its deep fruitiness and then some very rich caramel maltiness along with some clear alcohol. A solid bitterness balances well against the rich malt - solid, but not overly bitter. The finish is surprisingly clean and dry for such a sweet and malty beer. I was really surprised by this beer. Firstly, at how different it was from the Arrogant Bastard; secondly, at how directly the fruitiness found in their flagship pale ale was carried over; and thirdly, at how good it was! This is a really exceptional beer that may smooth a bit with some age on it; although I don't think the alcohol will cool much further.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,hyuga,4.9,"2002 release. Well, here I go! After so much anticipation and excitement, I finally have a glass of 200% pure bastard in front of me. Alright, enough talk, I'm eager to dig in. Invitingly evil (or is that evilly inviting?) deep crimson color. A two-finger tan head sits on top. Stays well at first, then disappears. Huge, and I mean MASSIVE aroma. And on top of that, very complex. Citrus jumps out at you first, then raisin and plum. Just a touch of alcohol. Malt is deep inside, but definitely present. On the palate... ever hear the term ""flavor rush""? I think it's associated with some brand of potato chips. Well, that's not ""flavor rush"". Double Bastard is ""flavor rush""! My taste buds didn't know what hit them! So many complex flavors hit the different parts of your tongue. I'll try to describe them. Malt and hop sections are both at maximum capacity here! Malt is caramel and a bit peat-like, extremely chewy, thick, and tongue-coating. Hops are aggressive pine and citrus, a bit leafy and floral on the edges as well. Raisin, plum, and berries have a big presence too. With the hops, this creates kind of a plum or berry skin bittersweetness, which is a very unique thing. It even stays on in the aftertaste. Alcohol presence, although noticeable, is minimal for a brew of this size. Grainy malt is noticeable as well, mostly in the aftertaste. You could almost call this a barleywine, but that wouldn't do its strength justice! I must say, this is beer heaven! I can't even put it into words. All I have to say is I'm getting as much more as I possibly can when I go back to the store tomorrow!",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Mark,4,"This bad boy poured a very deep amber, slightly tan head settled down to a thin persistent layer. Lacework was erratic but good. The aroma was very inviting, and the taste was hoppy and very powerful, with a noticible alcohol presence. I tasted notes of grapefruit on some sips and more malt on others. a very big complex beer that is very well made and has exceptional mouthfeel. Very full bodied and rounded. I will say though that I don't enjoy getting hammered on one bottle. I guess for me 10% is just a bit too much. I'm not ashamed to admit this, but I will say it's a fine brew nonetheless.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Brent,3.9,"Poured a beautiful amber-brown and the cold aroma was vodka soaked Hershey's kisses (if there could be such a thing). First glass was too cold, and the burnt sugar and molasses flavors were held back.  Once the beer warmed the flavors emerged, but the alcohol also blossomed and seemed to run roughshod over the palate, so that it was difficult to pick out the various flavor elements. I kept trying to get past the alcohol flavor to discover the rest of what this beer was hiding, but the 10% abv held me back from getting very deep into the flavors.  A massive barley wine-like ale, and a good choice for those who want a strong ale that will kick you in the teeth. I'll hang back and settle for arrogance.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,mzwolinski,4.85,"Wow, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this on the draught list at Papago's. I'd already had a hefty porter earlier in the evening, but couldn't leave without snapping this up.  Best idea I ever had.  An incredible brew, but like the company says, not for the faint of heart. The color alone should be enough to warn you off. It's a devilish deep amber, mahogany. Colors like that are put in Nature to tell other living creatures to back the hell off.  Head is thin, leaves a nice sticky lace on the side of the glass.  Aroma is.... well, wow man. Caramely sweet, very pine-like hoppiness, and maybe just a slight hint of alcohol.  Ok, well, not so slight. It's big. So are the hops, for the matter. And the sweetness.  And then there's the flavor. Did I say wow already? Butterscotch sweet, with a warming alcohol feel and flavor that starts around mid-palate and keeps on growing. Fruity notes are present, and a magnanimous dosage of hop bitterness. Stone manages to pack an immense amount of flavor in this beer. Very complex.  Don't plan on drinking anything else after this beer. First, it'll taste like tapwater, and second, you simply don't need any more alcohol after this. Go take a nap and have pleasant dreams of the next great offering from Stone instead.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Todd,4.85,"From the 2001 batch ... 750ml bomber = loads of brain rot and trouble.  Deep copper in colour with a magnificent and healthy looking off-white creamy head -- sticky and retains well.  Aroma ... pineapple, intense alcohol, loads of robust maltiness and pine-y hops in the nose.  Taste is so incredibly smooth that I might cry. Full-bodied, rich, robust, sugary/syrupy/sticky (carbonation seems suspended in the liquor) and extremely sweet. Flavours run all over the place: caramel, burnt sugar, chocolate, mega-fruity, pineapple, deep penetrating alcohol, pine-y earth/wood bitterness with an oily hop feel on the palate. Finish goes a touch dry with bready flavours and unsweetened chocolate notes.  Holy christ on a crutch!! Can you form a religion around a beer? This beer is everyting the name suggests, and then some. Extremely drinakble for a 10% beer, even more so as it warms up, and very warming.

Since I just tried the '02 version, I'm updating (and upgading) my orginal review. This beer is nothing short of beer bliss. Yes, it's packed with hops, but it's also packed with malt and an amazing array of flavors: similar in flavor and complexity to a good cognac.

Beautiful maerzen color. What an aroma! There's something about a powerful hop aroma that is part sweet and part hoppy. Deep, rich, and full aroma. This beer would be perfect if only sniffed. But the taste. Slightly smoky side of hop flavor, slightly earthy. Big body. Balances great as it warms. Deep alcohol aroma. It's a rare day when a beer makes me consider brand fidelity and a long-term committment. This one has my full attention and appreciation.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
147,1056,Jason,4.28,"Presentation: 22 oz brown bomber with a white and red silk screened label, mirror image if the gargoyle is creepy. Short essay about the meaning of life and why you are probably no worthy to drink this beer yet is on the back. No freshness dates though I am sure with its strength it does not worry about petty freshness dates. I am a little worried about going further  I must trek on.  Appearance: Deep and dark reddish mahogany brew with a thick light tan lace, this is a devils brew  devious in colour and taunts you to drink it. Even the bright clarity coerces you to drink it yet tells you to be fearful.  Smell: Citric and piney, caramel and spicy alcohol. Very aromatic, chocolate covered cherries laced with brandy is quickly suggested, higher alcohols will intimidate the nostrils. Almost vodka like in the fusel alcohols.  Taste: Exquisitely smooth right off the bat, its a well place carbonation  its placed out of the way but still hangs around to hold up the full body of malt and slightly syrupy mouth feel. Huge fruitiness with a bossy caramel maltiness, alcohol is sweet and fumy with a spicy overtone. Slight roasted malt and over caramelized flavour hits the tongue with chicory and faded burnt sugar. Hop bitterness pushes through the double doors of this beer and sets this beer even and balanced in a chaotic arrogant way. Piney and grapefruit rind hops flavours invade the taste buds. Warming alcohol increases with each sip, sweetness is large throughout but the hops and alcohol keep it in check right into the finish. Malt sweetness just cant let go but hops and burnt sugar flavours tag along so the sweetness does not get too flamboyant.  Notes: Yikes! Barley Wine in character but dont say that in front of the beer because it will set you straight, this is a American Nitro No Holds Barred Monster Truck Bitch Slappin Strong Ale. Youll feel the redness on your checks after this one slaps you around, youre probably better off not drinking this one alone just from the dominance and arrogance let alone the whopping 10% abv.",Arrogant Consortia,"California, United States",American Strong Ale,95
