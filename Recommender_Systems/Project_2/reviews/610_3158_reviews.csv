610,3158,RyanK252,4.19,"Bottle poured into a Bear Republic Brewing Co pint glass  A: Pours copper brown amber with a frothy tan head that settles to a firm layer and laces nicely.  S: Toasty bready malt, rye spice, earthy, herbal, pine, floral notes, light citrus, faint hints of dark fruit, and a little toffee sweetness.  T: Peppery rye right up front, toasty bready malt, spicy pine, floral notes, underlying citrus, grapefruit lemon, and orange, earthy, green herbal notes, hints of dark fruit, and toffee sweetness.  M: Just a touch on the fuller side of medium body, moderate carbonation. Deceptively smooth for an 8%er.  O: Could have sworn I reviewed this one at some point, but I'm glad I was able to snap some up. Definitely a piece of NorCal brewing history. Excellent Rye IPA!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ryan1788a5,4.11,"16oz can poured into a New Belgium globe.  A: Dark ruby red color with lighter orange hues. Super healthy head formation and retention. A solid two and a half fingers of cream-coloered head stick around for the duration and leave behind gobs of chunky lacing in a loose ring formation.  S: Juiced ruby red grapefruit, pine and resin, green and spicy hop oils. Underlying malt toastiness, sharper earthy rye spice, and a distinct crystal malt sweetness that brings a touch or berry/candy shell. Clean fermentation profile, probably chico yeast.  T: Opens with a fat crystal malt sweetness. Caramel, toffee, and candy shell. This very quickly gives way to a drying blanket of toastiness, flashes of burnt crust, and a lot of spicy rye. Hop profile hits hard and fast with a lot of vibrant and bitter ruby red grapefruit juice. Butter line and resin too, along with an oily and green spiciness. Bitterness is quite firm. The finish dries quite a bit with long lingering rye spice, oily hop bitterness, and traces of soot.  M: Full bodied with some chewiness and a very round and creamy malt texture. Plenty of raking hop astringency too. Ample carbonation scrubs firmly.  O: What a throwback. I do think this is the first rye IPA I ever had, circa 2008, but I can't remember ever revisiting it before today. I do miss rye beer in general, and feel like it got unfairly buried under the sea of west coast and hazy IPAs. This particular beer is considered a venerable classic within the rye sub-styles, and deservedly so. I love what they've done with the hop profile: the rye is unabashedly bold, and there's some interesting specialty malt character to round things out and create just enough balance to ground the bitterness and spiciness. Drinking it bakes me feel like I pulled something special out of the beer archives, but in this case I didn't have to blow any dust off of it because it was nice and fresh at my local packie.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,harrypowers,4.15,"Pours a hazy brown with a small head and light lacing.  Smells of malt and caramel.  Tastes of toasted semi sweet spicy malt with a slightly bitter, alcohol warm finish.

610,3158,mothmanscott,4.4,"From notes 12/15/12: Pours a clear hazy deep amber/light brown which clears some as it warms. As the beer settles a small amount of sediment becomes evident. The pour produces a heavy finger of frothy, variously bubbled, somewhat lasting, light tan head that leaves a thin pasty wash of lace. Aroma is hop forward earthy, floral, grapefruit, pine with a fruity hint, rye bread and rye spice. Taste is nicely balanced: earthy, grapefruit, orange zest, pine: caramel malt heavy, rye spice and a hint of chocolate. Sweet, lightly bitter finish with a caramel bitter aftertaste. The 8% ABV is well hidden with pleasant warming appearances in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy with moderate carbonation, very smooth, creamy and rich. Very, very nice.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,JNeakrase,3.96,"A really smooth, pleasant quaff. The rye gives it a spicy complexity, but it retains the fruitiness and herbal qualities of a nice brown ale.

Found in bomber in bodega in SF for night cap. a) Pours a dense 1 finger cap in the smallest glass and HOLDS IT, Lasts, laces, rocks it over a hazed ice tea body. s) IPA made more bitter, more astringent by rye. But too faint. t) Taste is abundant. Brings intense bittering, balanced by grainy sweet, whiskey like but hiding ABV well, then cascade of hop citrus, pine, grass, earthy floor, and dank flavors. Some mollasses, dark toasted grain, long finish, with pepper, muskiness, earthiness. f) Creamy, great mouth feel, luscious.

610,3158,Lone_Freighter,4.05,"The appearance was a nice hazy golden orange to amber color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about thirty seconds leaving some messy lacing roaming all around the glass. The smell had a nice sweet to spicy blend of rye malt to come across in a nice sweet citrus way. The taste was mainly sweet and lightly spiced through the rye, a light citrus runs through and leads to a quick sweet dry caramel to spicy aftertaste. There is a sweet citrus finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Sticky sweet malty notes run over my tongue. Overall, I say this was a pretty good DIPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Taste: It has flavors of rye, plums, grain, earthly elements, spice, and caramel.  Feel: It has a moderate body to it with a moderately high bitter finish. It has a moderately high carbonation level as well.

The aroma is an enticing blend of piney hops and spicy rye malt. The taste is aggressively bitter piney hops with the spicy, earthy rye malt appearing in the middle of the palate. After that you get more bitter piney hops. The mouth is dangerously creamy, smooth, and quaffable considering the strength.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,Czequershuus,4.59,"This beer pours a deep choclate brown with a very solid and well structured head. The aroma is replete with resin and pine, mint, violets, roses, and a touch of maple. The flavor begins soft and floral, especially redolent of violets, moving into subtle woodsy spice, baslam, sandalwood, and rich breayd, almost cookie like malts, like an oatmeal raisin cookie. The finish is solidly bitter, with resin, pine, camphor, and mint. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, but never heavy. Overall this is a great beer, complex, full of unique and interesting flavors. I love the way is starts so soft and ends so bitter.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,TBoneJones,4.51,"Terrific rye IPA. Brown/ deep ruby pour, creamy top, citrus nose with underlying rye. Taste is yummy citrus IPA with well-placed rye flavor.

S: Rye spice and grassy resiny hops scented with a touch of a meadow smell after a soft rain blending earthiness, grass, vegetation and light floral.  T: Rich malts, biscuit and rye with a fairly assertive hop accent growing at the finish. Some grain or hop driven astringency at the finish. As it warms caramel notes become more prominent and rye flavors develop and create a strong urge for pastrami and German mustard.  F: Very creamy texture supported by soft carbonation that makes its medium body feel light and airy.  O: Loaded with layers of flavor that achieve a delightful balance.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,MattyG85,4.49,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an IPA glass.  Appearance: Pours a deep brownish amber red with a lot of rising bubbles. Big two finger off white head which slowly settles into a thin creamy layer.  Smell: An earthy and spicy hop driven aroma with a scent of rye, grass, and caramel. Earthy and floral hops with a scent of grass and pine along with subtle citrus hints. Barley malt with a big scent of rye spice along with hints of caramel, biscuit, grains, and toast with yeast. A very nice aroma.  Taste: Like it smells, an earthy and spicy hop forward taste with notes of rye, caramel, and grass. Strong hop presence with earthy and floral notes of pine resin and grass. Subtle citrus notes. Barley malt with a lot of rye spice and notes of caramel, biscuit, toast, and grains along with yeast. A very good bold taste.

610,3158,Tenessee_Jed1972,3.94,"Looks almost like a scotch ale after pouring. Deep, dark red color. Ruby-esque. Tastes pretty hoppy but even the hops in this IPA are dominated by the rye. Holy rye!

610,3158,Guppy314,4.26,"Unabashedly Hoppy, but there is also a caramel taste. It is very comparable to a HopDevil (Victory Brewing), which I felt was ""crisper"".

610,3158,Ri0,4.09,"Poured 12oz bottle into snifter. It has a rich, brown color similar to ice tea with a 2.5 finger sandy head. Leaves behind a pretty good amount of lacing on the glass. Rye malts and piney hops sit in the nose. A sweet, malty taste opens up and then leads into a slightly bitter hop taste, before being slashed and settled by the rye. Great taste, and kept well in check. Mouth feel is medium and stick with great carbonation. It's easy and a pleasure to drink. Overall, a well made delicious IPA with a sold spicey finish from the rye.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BeerSamurai34,3.89,"Just ok for me. I think this is really popular with many, but rye IPAs just are hit or miss for me. This one had good hop character, but the hop profile just didn't work with the rye for me.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,rodbeermunch,3.9,"Pours light brown to auburn. Easily darker than most ipas. Its a heavy malt ipa. Aroma does impart notes of rye, toffee, c hops.  Taste, very good when fresh, as they get older the toffee and wood like rye malt notes become less sweet and more heavy on the mouthfeel. Fresh can have that bright feel, which is nice. The rye is minorly sweet, pepper edge to it. Strong alcohol, moderate tree and citrus notes.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,beercam,4.93,"Hop Rod Rye...  A Specialty Ale indeed.  Two pours of a 22 oz. into a 16 oz Fremont Brewery can pint. This bottle is very fresh, with an expiration date of late April 2016.  L: This shone with a forest-fire red upon pouring. Meanwhile, a persistent and tufty head of fine foam billowed and roiled luxuriously. The lace was mesmerizing and extensive while the liquid looked sticky and and syrupy. Supreme aesthetics here, folks. S: It slipped by undetected by my olfactory radar at first. Slowly did I begin to discover this fruity, rye-y, quintessentially hoppy smell (pines+citrus+_), which was pungent and present and involved. T: Rye. Right upfront. Almost a pepperyness to this rye, a bit smokey, strong, then bulldozed by a crash of adventurous hop intensity. There was a true cacophony of flavors here, perhaps descending down from the great white north, or wherever hops land is, and aqueously descends upon my tongue. This in itself was deeply disorienting, intoxicating, and along with this very strong beer, punching in at 8%... On to other reasons why I drink this beer.. F: Viscousy. Sharply carbonated at a bit below room temperature, could've, should've been colder, but it was really nice flavor wise warmer. It lingered on strongly, with physical mouth presences of pepper and something wheaty. Feel was really smoooth. This is classic, classic rye.  O: This is a courageous, successful and masterful brew of a very rye-y recipe at 18% a commercial batch. For me, beyond this level of rye proportion in a beer can taste quite sour. And I don't drink sour beers.... yet.  Try your hardest to find this beer. It's perfect. Thank you Bear Republic. Cheers!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,Brolo75,4.6,"12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip  A: Pours a deep rich mahogany with a caramel colored head, some head retention, lots of lacing, decent amount of carbonation streaming off the bottom, this beer has a very rich full appearance, looks really good.  A: Lemon like citrus, hint of pine needles, rye spice, no alcohol on the nose, great balance of aromas, not too hoppy, not too spicy, smells solid.  T: Hit of lemon/grapefruit like citrus up front, spicy rye in the middle, moderate amount of citrus peel bitterness in the middle, touch of bread/biscuit from malts, adds a nice balance, big dry finish with lingering flavors of citrus and rye, very balanced, very drinkable.  M: Big mouthfeel, full, creamy, dry finish.  O: I really love this beer, first beer I have had with rye, love the balance of hops, rye, and malt, has lots of flavor, creamy mouthfeel, just overall, a world class that I especially enjoy in cooler weather.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BethanyB,4,"Look: A slightly hazy medium copper body, witht bubbles that glom on to every inch of the glass. The substantial, creamy head is of a pale khaki color.  Smell: Strong toasted malt gives way to a sweeter caramel character as the beer warms. The rye definitely comes through on the nose, curbing the caramel sweetness, along with resinous and earthy hops. Nice balanced complexity.  Taste: The sweet caramel is evident right away, and only becomes more prominent in the finish. It is balanced by the complex hop profile, which combines herbal earthiness wth a citrus element perhaps made more obvious by the sugary base. The rye creates an element of peppery spice that works well against the softer notes.  Mouthfeel: The strong hop and malt flavors are well supported by medium body and medium carbonation . The dryness is detectable only after the swallow, at which point the tongue begins to prickle.  Overall: A tasty, well balanced beer which uses rye to bring a unique spicy kick to juxtapose the unusual sweetness. Some may be put off by the high level of caramel. For me, it verges on being slightly too sweet, but overall, I think it does well to even out the hoppy spiciness.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,youcantmakeme,3.75,"To me this one is slightly above okay, I liked it its not my favorite though and don't think I would buy it again. I like it more than an torpedo which I found similar but this one kept changing on me from hoppy to sweet, on my fourth pint bottle I even got a hard cheese and soy sauce. I did like the boozy end it gave me sometimes. I like my Ipa a bit on the light side, easy drinking and not too sweet so I have to give this one a slightly above OK rating which is good but not great.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,Reema,4.5,"Serving type: 12 oz bottle into a shaker pint  Pours a dark hazy amber/brown color. Smells lightly of toasted bread, hops, pine resin, and fresh baked bread. Taste reflects the smell with a slightly larger hops presence, major toasted bread, slight malt sweetness, with a minuscule spiciness somewhere in the middle. It's different and I like it a lot. Medium-heavy feel, with medium-light carbonation that works very well with the toasted bread and malty sweetness. Overall, this is a very good beer with great bready and malty characteristics without sacrificing or impeding the hops flavors. Highly recommend.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Maybe the spiciness of the rye is doing strange things to my brain.  T: Comes across as more of a Red Ale / Amber than an IPA. Rich bready malts with a touch of caramel. Bitter, but not overly so.  M: Medium-heavy body, but with a clean finish. Lingering malt and floral hops.  O: A little hard to know what to do with this... The brewery calls it an IPA, but it's way out of style guidelines. Seems to be a pleasantly hoppy Amber to me. It's a fine average-plus beer, but I'm not really sure what it's doing on the Top 250.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,Jadjunk,3.71,"""Hop Rod Rye is a high performance, turbo charged, alcohol burnin' monster ale with dual overhead hop injection, made with 18% rye. Brewed in the style of an American Rye IPA, available as a year round release in 12 oz. bottled 6 packs and on draft.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a snifter glass. Served above 57 degrees Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a billowing creamy frothed head of a maple cream color over a moderately hazy deep mahogany amber body with plenty of flecked sediment ranging from opaque to black in suspension. Retention is very good and lacing is light and streaked. 4.25  (Smell) Aromas of bready, tangy rye malt and biscuity caramel syrup up front with a lesser note of herbal, spicy and piney hops secondary. Potency is medium-high. 3.75  (Taste) Dense bready rye and caramel body sweetness up front, fairly clean tasting but the viscosity is certainly there. Lesser emphasis on resinous, piney and herbal hops, somewhat faded. Fairly tasty, although I think the bottle is a bit dated. The rye flavor and character is forward and well carried through. 3.5  (Mouthfeel) Texture is moderately syrupy, medium chewy and mildly dry. Carbonation is mellow, generating a mild frothiness and a soft crispness. Body is medium+ for the style, medium+ overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to hoppy bitter, although the impact of age on this bottle in particular has the sweetness taking the front stage. Alcohol presence is mild and there are no significant off characters. 4  (Overall) I was a bit disappointed to find following this review that this bottle was a good bit past its prime, but still very promising with lots of rye flavor, texture and a solid malt body. Paired with a substantial hop flavor and bitterness, this would be no doubt be a fantastic beer. Will re-review at the next opportunity as Bear Republic is not currently distributed to Georgia and I got this on an out-of-state trip recently.

Achieves such a fine balance of malt and hops to the point where you can almost pick one or the other to focus on, but both are still respectfully present. Casual but classy; solid from start to finish with no fuss . This beer is marriage material.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Brutaltruth,4.25,"Enjoyed from the 22 oa bomber in a pint glass. This sturdy ipa pours a copper brown with a firm white head that slowly dies down to a thin foam layer with fantastic lacing. Nose of heavy citrus hops, grapefruit, orange zest, lavish caramel malts, and spicy rye. Flavors are a full on hop and rye assault on all sides with caramel malts sweetening out the spice of the rye and the bitterness of the from the hops to culminate in a symposium of a bitter sweet monster. Bitter hop and spicy rye is calmed by thick caramel flavors on the aftertaste giving balance to this fine ale that finishes wet and bitter. Creamy mouth feel and moderate carbonation makes it highly drinkable with alcohol warmth coming in on the back, especially as it warms.  I am no hop head by any means, but this is most excellent and highly quaffable!  Cheers!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Gajo74,4.86,"I'm in love with this great brew and need to get more ASAP! Pours a dark copper with a modest head and a small ring like lace that retains throughout. It seems that this one is unfiltered as you can see some sediment. No problem, as it does not affect it negatively. The aroma is malty sweet with hints of caramel, chocolate, syrup, toasted bread and a tiny bit of alcohol towards the end. The taste is a malt lover's dream. A firm malt backbone with toasty bread flavors and caramel. Yet, this sweetness is never at risk of being cloying. Make no mistake about it, this one is also a bit of a hop bomb. This is evident in the finish and aftertaste which is a perfect marriage of dry, bitter and sweet. There are also elements of spice coming from the rye. I like my IPAs to have a good balance between hops and malts and I'm so impressed by the perfect balance this one has achieved. What a feel! It is full bodied and chewy yet so drinkable. I just finished it and I'm sad because I wish I had more. Reminds me a lot of dogfish head IPA 90.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,fps_dean,4.4,"Pours a solid orange color with limited head that disappears quickly.  Smells of strong piney hops, bready malts, with a hint of alcohol.  Tastes of piney hops, rye, and caramel with a touch of alcohol. Fairly well balanced overall.  Moderate bodied and lightly carbonated. Fairly smooth, and easily drinkable.  Overall this is a very solid brew that I would buy again. It certainly lives up to its name as it is not weak in the hops or rye department by any means.  Edit: I'm increasing my rating for this one.

610,3158,bassboneman,4.06,Poured into glass Immediate scent of piney alcohol - mmmmmm... Definite finish is on the sweet side - very strong - but endearing hoppy quality as well. Carbonation is right on point! Love this bear beer :o),Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,breadwinner,4.5,"This was one of those beers that was an absolute eye-opener for me. I didn't know you could make beers like this. Big pops of pine marry with brown sugar sweetness and rye spice underneath. It's an ingenius blend that, even after all these years, still never fails to mesmerize.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Andrew041180,3.93,"Pours a brownish amber color, much darker than I expected. Nice low head diminishes rather quickly while leaving sticky off-white lace.  The aroma is faint. Mostly getting dank hops and syrupy sweetness.  Taste is earthy hops and dark caramel sweetness. No flavor stands out, but the combination offers quite a punch. The alcohol is well hidden.  This is full-bodied and smooth - my favorite part. Very little carbonation at play here.  Someone seriously mis-classified this beer as an IPA. It's far more like the American Strong Ales that I've had than any IPA. I would rate it more highly along those lines, but it's not my preferred style and probably not something I would buy again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,GreesyFizeek,3.5,"Bottle purchased at AJ's in Henrietta, NY. Bottled on date of 12/5/13, so it's a little bit old. Should have checked the date.  Pours a tawny amber brown, with a half inch white head, and a little bit of lacing.  Smells like caramel, rye, and a bit of pine. The hop aroma seems diminished.  At this age, this is still a somewhat decent rye ale, but it's not an IPA anymore. There's some slight hoppy pine bitterness, but it's mild. There's the spicy, grainy rye flavor I would expect, with some caramel and molasses. The malt flavor is at the forefront here, at this age, but it's not that interesting.  This one has a bready mouthfeel, with a lower amount of carbonation. It's kind of drinkable, I guess?  I'm disappointed. If I get a newer bottle, I'll re-review this.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,bricksandivey,4.5,"Delicious rye beer for those who worship at the house of rye beers. Enjoyed this in draft 16 oz pour in standard pint glass at The Craft Bar Destin, Fl.

Great smell T- Really smooth, very complex with a lot going on. Berry and hint of licorice comes out. A bit bitter on the finish but ok. F- Good feel, substantial for a dark red beer, almost like a stout. A bit on the heavy side and a bit too much carbonation. O - I really like this beer in all aspects, but I don't usually have more than one or two at a time because it is bold.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,mac31,3.75,"Initial thought: sweet and hoppy. Amber, slight smoky, deep rich maltiness. Roasty notes. Hints of caramel. Floral hoppiness. Resinous and dankiness from the hops counteract some of the sweetness. I'm really digging the soft bitterness from early addition hops. For how sweet the beer starts out it finishes somewhat dry possibly because of the rye in the grist. Some nice subtle spiciness is detected in the finish combined with some cereal grain finish. Nice beer, a little sweet for me. Medium body w/ perfect carbonation allows all the flavors to shine and lends very well to the drinkability of this brew. If your going BR, give me a Red Rocket Ale or Racer 5 please. Good brew non-the-less.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Brewhemoth,4.5,"From a bomber into a tulip.  A: Pours a dark amber with a thick, creamy, off-white, head. Really nice head retention and excellent lacing. No visible activity. S: A caramel sweetness and piney hops followed by a heavy, earthy, rye spice. T: Resiny hops upfront and rye spice followed by light roastiness. A nce long lasting bitterness. A medium level of carbonation. M: Nice and full for and IPA, goes down very smoothly. Coats the mouth well, and hides the alcohol very nicely - hits you harder down the line than you think.  Overall: An extremely tasty RPA, one of the better, if not the best, one I have had.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Great retention forming tons of spotty and lingering lacings in the glass  S: Strong notes of caramel, sweet malts and hops. Very citrus hops profile. Strong notes of citrus fruits too (grapefruit). Earthy yeasts  T: Slightly sweet upfront. Sweet caramel malts, toffee, rye, some roastiness. Notes of grapefruit very well combined with quite citrus hops.

Massive tan head accompanies a rich aroma with a good bit of rye in it, along with secondary notes of pine forest hops. Visible sediment left in bottle.

610,3158,BeerBeast,4.25,"Another fantastic IPA entry from Bear Republic, one of my favorite California breweries. Nice frothy head, highly enticing aroma, and an excellent rye-dominated flavor.

610,3158,TheBeerSipper,3.92,"Appearance - A wonderful mahogany look with a tan head about a finger thick.  Smell - a very rich curious smell that builds anticipation to what you are about to taste.  Taste - If you are expecting a normal taste here - you will be surprised my friends. The taste is similar to its rich bourbon esque smell. Though the taste is slightly less strong and flavorful than the smell, it is still very tasty.  Mouthfeel - The feel is very similar to the taste.  Overall - This is a very good, unique brew that differs greatly from your typical ale.  Until Next Time  The Beer Sipper",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,slym,4.3,"I picked up a bottle of this while buying a six of Weihenstephaner's Hefeweissbeir, to have something a little different, and because I am trying all the RyePAs I can.  This is a damn good beer! As I cracked it open, I can smell the fruityness coming off the bottle. On the pour, the nose is pineapple, citrus, and pine. Nice bit of head (giggity) that lingered longer than most, with light lacing. The taste is fruity, not at all as bitter as some IPAs I have had, and has nice malt sweetness and rye spicyness. It's not too carbonated, but nicely fizzy.  Total ""hops & pineapple"" burps, as I just found out as I write this review! *L*  A really fine version of this type of IPA. Totally earns its ranking, and I am not the biggest fan of the style. Easily will I recommend and buy this again!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Gabriel_Vaughn,4.07,"pours well into my glass, a deep dark amber. The head is creamy off-white like the foam you may see in a latte. It has a bold scent of rye ale and alcohol. The scent really hits you as does that initial swig. That 18% rye content does a number on the flavor. Excellent craft ale from northern California once again. Overall this particular brew earns a 4 and a quarter.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,JohnnyJam,4.32,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle with no code date visible into a pint glass and got one finger on head. This bottle says 8% ABV.  A: Pours a reddish, dark amber color with one finger of head that dissipates at a moderate rate to leave a covering on the top of my glass and a fairly thick ring of head around the glass. lots of nice lacing from top to bottom.  S: The first thing I smell is white pepper and then some sweet caramel and brown sugar. the smell of grass and a little pine is also present.  T: It is sweet but spicy. The hops have a resin taste but they come off spicy probably from the rye. I have to say the taste of ruby grapefruit is also present.  O: Did I mention that this beer is 8% ABV? The alcohol is really well hidden. This is a medium-bodied and more than medium-carbonated beer. It goes down smooth and easy but it that high alcohol content can creep up. It's a really nice beer: easy to drink, complex and tasty.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,SteveB24,4.86,"Appearance: color is a clear ruby, there are lots of bubbles within the beer, which pours a thick, bouncy head that has superb retention.  Smell: aroma is very hoppy, with powerful notes of grapefruit and pine. Rye pepperiness lingers there as well.  Taste: citrus hops burst forward, followed by pine and rye spiciness, as well as malty burned sugar that beautifully balances the faint, hoppy bitterness.  Mouthful: body is on the lighter side of medium, not crisp but not creamy either, but moisture from the thick head lingers on the back of the tongue on the way down.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Immortale25,4.43,Had on-tap at Westville Pub Asheville. Served in a Highland pint glass.  A- Pours a light brown color with a 1/4 inch tan head that retains decently before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a full sheet of surface foam. Semi-resilient lacing leaves a jagged ring behind.  S- Quick stab of rye along with some brown sugary sweetness.  T- Starts out kind of tasting like a barleywine with its sweet malt character and mild hop bitterness. But then the drinkability makes for a much smoother drink and clearly more of a straight up IPA with a pronounced malt sweetness which is actually a bit surprising since most of the rye IPAs I've had have been more spicy with the rye than sweet. Great hop burps.  M- Surprisingly tame considering the flavor. Very smooth with medium carbonation and a fullish body.  O- An excellent rye beer that's hoppy but doesn't overdo it. Balanced I guess would be the right word but there's enough intensity of flavor that it excites the taste buds all the way to the last sip.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,curasowa,4.1,"Appearance: Mahogany color with suspended sediment and one finger of tan head that fades slowly with thick lacing.  Aroma: A great blend of malt; Caramel, definitely rye, some light roasted notes, husk, faint cocoa and some earthy hops.  Taste: Creamy, slightly chewy mouthfeel, toasted, bready malt, spicy rye, bitterness starts appearing midway through and builds to become quite bitter on the finish. The bitterness is pretty earthy. Finish is lingering with a fair amount of dark chocolate.  The Rest: Really good; complex yet drinkable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,TempeBeerMan,4.07,"Poured from a bottle into a nonic pint.  A - Mostly clear dark copper color with a rocky, two-finger, khaki head. Rings of sticky lacing. Good head retention.  S - Pungent aroma of west coast hops, caramel malts, and black peppercorn.  T - Much earthier than the nose would indicate. Caramel malt forward with dank and herbal hops in the mid-palate. A bit of lemon/lime sweetness throughout. Rye makes itself know heavily in the finish, with spicy bready kick and even a hint of caraway seed (or maybe it's just my imagination) Complex and tasty.  M - Lighter side of medium bodied, with soft carbonation. Seems like it could use more of both given the flavor profile. Finishes with a nice coating; more wet than dry.  O - I love rye ales, and this one is one of the best. A few flaws in the mouth feel, but the flavor makes up for it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Bone53,3.71,Poured from a 7 month old bottle into a snifter at around 45°F  Appearance: Dark copper color with a frothy two finger off white head  Smell: Sweet malt and a hint of citrus hops  Taste: Same as the nose. Resiny on the palate  Mouthfeel: Medium body with slight bitterness  Overall: This is so old it's not credible. My fault for not looking at the date but stores should atleast have these beers on sale. Tastes more like a decent Scotch ale than an IPA.

610,3158,Valley_Town_Sipper,3.97,"Despite it's tacky looking label, the inexpensive Hop Rod Rye is a formidable ale that hits both levels of hops and malt and issuing a nice flavor profile. The micro sediment is barely noticeable in its nice amber tone. And even though I was the dumbass who sniffed this one too close and got a nostril full of head to bring some water to my eyes, I am not judging the ""smell"" because of this. The scent is light, semi-sweet, and gives but a hint of what the flavor really can bring. For the price and the availability, the Hop Rod Rye is definitely worth its merit. . .

610,3158,TonyC,5,"Not going to give the same ole type of review for Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye. No way! This is my most favorite beer in all the lands. From the opening aromas of rye and hops gently wafting into the air, to the wonderful dark pour and oh so wonderful rocky, creamy, off white head that stays with you like a best friend, and leaving the most wonderful lace, to the malty/bready/caramel rye flavor and truly perfect balance of hops and carbonation, to the finish that begs you to take another sip, this beer is king.

610,3158,kj8525,3.8,"Poured out of a bomber bottle ~3 months from bottling date. Poured a rich amber color with a foamy finger of white head.  Smell is floral, sweet, and rye.  Taste is floral, piney, and rye. I also pick up a very slight sweetness maybe citrus.  Overall, I like the beer. It's a pretty good representation for a Rye IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,cjgiant,4.38,"A: sort if a dirty orange, but translucent. Copious amount if head that maintains a decently thick layer on top while lacing the glass significantly S: floral and slightly sweet, some rye noted T: wonderfully smooth, caramel to toffee* sweetness atop a rye base that balance very nicely. There is a hint if dark fruit (date I think) that might be a result of the combination. There is a light orange-like sweetness (thinking orange-Creme) that I notice as well. M: the carbonation doesn't attack the tongue, as the smoothness continues into the end feel. A rye-driven dryness increases from the start, but never grows too strong. O: I have had before, but don't remember enjoying this much. Will have to go into heavier rotation.  * it's really annoying I had an impression on first taste that I was distracted before I wrote down. It didn't make itself as obvious to me after the first taste, but at the time I thought it perfectly described the taste to me.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,obrike,4.28,"Absolutely beautiful look in a pint glass. Dark copper color, ample, rocky head that lasts for the entire beer. Bits of lace clinging to the glass throughout.  Love the bitter hops, mixed with spice scent. A fantastic smelling IPA..., caramel malt, citrusy hops, maybe even some grape (doppelbockesque?)...so different than most IPAs out there. Fresh and clean...super smooth.  A very unique tasting beer, but one that suits me just fine. Definitely has the uber-hoppy taste of a DIPA, but the addition of the rye makes puts it in a class by itself. An interesting and delicious combination of dark fruits, spice, and bitter hops. Very thankful for the 4 packs...but would be so much happier if BR would release it in a 6 pack someday.  (update...March 2014...6 packs baby!!!)  I would love to drink these as my staple, but a bit too boozy for me to drink more than 2/3 per sitting. Still, a great price for such a great beer. Hard to believe this one's classified as an IPA...there's so much going on in it.  A homerun by Bear Republic for sure. A must try for any IPA lover...heck, a must try for anyone who just loves great beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Copernicus,4.25,"22oz. bottle poured into a Sam Adams custom.  A: Pours a translucent dark amber/light golden brown. The head is khaki, rocky, and very sticky, like that of a root beer float. It leaves a loose-weave lace and shows great retention.  S: Divinely malty. It smells of caramel, honey, wheat bread, spice, and sticky dried fruits like fig and raisins. The playful hop aroma, on the spicier side, balances everything out nicely. There's definitely some sturdy spice from the rye.  T: Very pleasant beer. A bit weak in the front due to lack of a solid hop structure. The middle is all malt: crystal, amber, and the rye. It's a complex but not overpowering grain bill. The hops debut around the finish: spicy, resiny, and woodsy.  M: Medium body with vivid carbonation, but larger bubbles. Cobbled. No evidence of alcohol or astringency.  O: This is a fun, tasty, and very drinkable beer. Everyone plays nicely together. I would pair this with spicy roasted chicken, most likely Moroccan style. A smoked pork shoulder would go well too. For dessert: caramel and spice creme brulee, apple pie a la mode, or peach cobbler.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

So, at a visit to our local beer shop, I picked up the Bear Republic's entry into the Rye IPA field.  The beer is good. It looks great--incredible head, excellent appearance on the glass--and feels only slightly heavy in the mouth. It also tastes good, albeit a bit sweet for me. I wish that it was a bit hoppier and that the sweetness was toned down a bit.

S: smell doesn't disappoint. Sweet toffee and the rye really comes through. The anticipation to taste grows!  T: finally! Nice sweet caramel on the lips and front of the tongue. As it rolls across my mouth I get the rye and hops at the end. Then...the rye lingers. Like a fresh slice of homemade rye bread. Amazing!  M: creamy and the right amount of carbonation.

The sweetness of maple at the front of the mouth, the incredible balance of malt, booze, molasses, and bready biscuits all come together perfectly and caps off with a refreshing bitterness that makes you want to repeat the sweet and smoothness you get at the beginning. Highly drinkable. This beers aroma ends up melting right into the flavors as it warms up. Some rye ales have great aroma but tastes one dimensional. This one offers aroma and taste.

This offering pours a rich caramel brown with a very generous thick beige head that lasts throughout the pour. The aroma is malty and spicy. Definite rye notes, toffee, pepper, spice, floral citrus, and light coffee notes. This beer is chewy and coating in the mouth. The flavor is what really sets it apart.

610,3158,BearslikeBeers,4.03,"Pours a dark gold color with a small white head that laces up the side of the glass. The smell is nice, fresh, hoppy and almost a little starchy at the end. It smells very rich for lack of a better term. The beer is initially sweet and a little fruity up front, less carbonated than most IPAs, and then the real profile starts to set in. The rye is very rich and malty but the hops really define the aftertaste. Very dry and very bitter finish. A little flat and syrupy but a really nice balance of the rye and the hops definitely would purchase this one again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,silverblaze540,3.99,"Appearance - It is a deep amber color, and is a bit cloudy. My pour produced a very small amount of head, which retained well. Carbonation actively bubbles and, when held up to the light, particles/sediment are visible. Looks very tasty.  Smell - Fairly piney, but not overpowering, sweetness and perfumey, which just a hint of maltiness.  Taste - Hops, hops, hops, but not extremely strong for this type of beer. A bit of a citrus taste. The taste balance is pretty good, as no taste is extremely overpowering. Seems to fit the IPA/Double IPA style without being overpoweringly bitter.  Mouth-feel - Medium build; carbonation seems perfect with a small amount of burn; alcohol taste is not strong, especially for 8%.  Overall - This is the best IPA I've tasted because the taste balance is good and the hops are not overpowering. It is bitter, but not to the extreme. There is still a strong hoppy taste, so I would probably not drink this beer that often, and I am not a huge fan of the hoppy aftertaste.

610,3158,dexterk1,4.46,"Pours a reddish brown color with a good head and left good lacing. Odor is a little sweet. A little bit of caramel and malt perhaps some citrus as well. Taste starts well and gets better. Begins with hops and pine. Continues with some malt and toffee notes and finishes a little sweet with more pine, citrus and mild grapefruit flavors. Rye does come through and helps bring a nice bonus to the taste of this beer. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth with relatively light carbonation. Overall, an excellent rye IPA that stands out from many. Good odor and taste with very little alcohol coming through. Definitely high on my list!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Darkmagus82,4.29,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass  Appearance – The beer pours a copper color with a one finger of foamy tan colored head. The head has a decent level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a nice level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.  Smell – The aroma is big of a nice rye bread and hoppy smell. The hops are mainly of a pine nature but also consist of a good showing of a grapefruit smell. Along with these aromas are some lighter notes of a caramel sweetness as well as some grassy like aromas.  Taste – The taste begins much sweeter then the nose would have let on with lots of caramel and toffee flavor as well as some fruit flavors of a more tangerine nature. Right from the start there is also a bready taste with hints of rye mixed within. While the rye if very light upfront it grows in strength as the flavor advances with it becoming more potent at the end. Hops are present from the start as well. They begin largely of a light pine and grassy nature at first, but are later replaced by a grapefruit hop flavor. The grapefruit really takes control of the hop profile toward the end, and when mixed with the strengthen rye favor as well as the sweeter flavors that remain strong to the end, one if left with a satisfying, grapefruity sweet rye bread flavor to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the average side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is average as well. Both are fine for the blend of hoppiness, sweetness, and rye all while keeping it a rather easy drinking beer overall.  Overall – A quite tasty and sweeter rye IPA. It had a wonderful blend of tastes and a very easy drinking feel which mare this one a very flavorful and enjoyable brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

The taste is where this beer goes from great to outstanding. Strong hop character up front with grapefruit, and pine giving way to the spicy rye and caramel backbone. Hops and malt are perfectly balanced as the beer finishes off spicy and bitter with just a touch of alcohol. The beer is perfectly carbonated and teases your tongue to have another sip.

Getting on the older side, yes, but it ain't exactly Barbara Walters old. Still, Raul finds this sucker a bit more malty and syrupy than hoppy and, uhh, ""rye-y.""  Yes, my children.

610,3158,BeerWizard,4.43,"Second sampling of this. I had a bomber of it previously and was disappointed, mostly because I was wanting more of an imperial marzen, but I’m finding this is actually closer to that than I'd previously experienced...just with tons of hoppiness. Pours a rusty brown with some cloud to it – I love how Bear Republic’s IPA and now this have some cloud. I’d like to try more of their stuff but those two are all I’ve found in CO. Decent head that breaks down in a couple minutes and laces the glass. Smells hoppy and sweet, with citrus and pineapple to it. The flavor is where the rye comes in, giving it some heartier grain and malt, cherry and light spice, along with the hop bitters. Has a medium mouthfeel, leaning heavy, and the alcohol is present but not offensive, especially for being as up there as it is. Works well with the flavors. Overall, really glad I tried this again. I think the first time I was so affronted by the hops that I couldn’t get past it to enjoy the rye aspects, but this time around, definitely enjoying the combo. Will definitely get this again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,TheBrewo,4.31,"This brew was served on tap at One Eyed Betty’s in Ferndale, Michigan. It arrived in a generic nonic glass, showing a rich kettle-copper coloring. It boasted a one and a half finger tall head of creamy, ghostly white foam, showing decent retention. This faded into a single thick sheet of lacing left virtually covering all walls of the glass. No haze or sediment was noted, and carbonation appeared to be medium. The aroma boasted citric and grassy hops, dried lavender florals, metallic rye grit, pales, and ambers, softer cooked caramel sweetness, freshly pressed honey crisp apple juice, commercial cranberry juice, red grape skins, watermelon jolly ranchers, and bite of plastics and black pepper spiciness with warmth. Our first impression was that this was the single best depiction of rye graininess that we’ve ever tasted, with no mystery as to why it is such a classic, well-regarded beer. The taste opened with syrupy thick caramel grain that was quickly cut by biting rye wash, light smoky peatiness, cooked coffee malts, heavy buttery diacetyls, eucalyptus, cranberry flesh, black pepper, moss and musk, citric hop oils, and hibiscus. The middle came through with bitterness and seriousness of the grain, with rye and amber malts shining through a lingering background of heavy creamer, lactic sourness, strawberry and cranberry fruitiness, and black and herbal green tea leafiness. Washing through the end was a final blend of fusel booze, black pepper, phenolic plastics, the sheen of rye metallics, pale and cloying caramel malt, rose hips, and resinous piney, soapy, and citric hops. The aftertaste breathed of sea salt, lobster shell, Oreo cookies, gingerbread, buttery diacetyls, lemon cleaner, soapy and piney hops, gravel and dust, nutmeg, dried florals, and caramel syrups. The body was decidedly full, and the carbonation was medium. Each sip showed great slurp, smack, cream, froth, and pop, with the mouth left fully coated and cooled. The belly, on the other hand, was warmed. On a swirl around the mouth the foaminess became huge, with slow and eventual puckering astringency to follow. The abv was appropriate, and while thick, you could really sip and glug this guy back with ease.  Overall, the best thing about this beer was the incredible showcasing of rye grain, with its unexpected smoke and hidden darkness to it in the taste. The grain is so prominent that you actually forget about everything else, especially the hops. That is not to say that the hoppy side is missing, because if you stop and think about it, they are as strong and forward as ever!! This just speaks to how deep and intoxicating the grain bill is here, as it really will take you by surprise if you let it. This is due, in part, to the rich and sweet fruity inclusions that meld so well with the grain bill. In evaluating the hops, they do show an excellent oiliness and variety across the spectrum of flavor, with great dimensionality. In the end, this guy may be a bit booze heavy for some, but it is an undeniable classic that we’ve ignored for far too long, and one of Bear Republic’s best.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,KYGunner,4.02,"The rich coloring is caramel hued, coppery and even a tad cloudy. The head is thick, foamy tan in color and laces nicely.  The scent is robust in caramel malts with a piney hop underpinning. I also get aromas of grapefruit, tangerines, sweet dried fruit, flowers and rye.  The flavors are rich and robust, almost thick. The caramel malt and rye is prevalent but it is joined by a tremendous punch of floral hop pine. The pine does not take on that metallic tinge like some IPA s. The malt, rye flavor conjoins the floral, pine and grapefruit in one thick unit.  This is a man's beer, rich robust and in your face but then settles well for a great IPA experience.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Taste has more tropical fruit coming through in the way of mangos and grapefruit rind. Malt pounds upfront, hop onslaughts the tongue with numbing sensations and rye pulls through for the finish. Tastes way better than it smells.  Medium body and velvety. Creamy as an Irish red ale. Hop has staying power much like an imperial.  Beside the aroma, a most pleasant quaff to spend time with.

Has a medium to high hoppy flavour to it with good hints of fruity and citrus tastes. The rye added to this beer gives a very unique taste and aroma. The aroma itself has a slightly heavy quality to it and in the pour it had very little head to it.

These guys really have 1 style in mind seems like and I must say its one of my favorites. Poured this into a standard American pint glass.  A - deep dark amber to a brownish colored body. Off white/beige colored head has a pillowy fluff to it and sits beautifully atop the body. Leaving loads and loads of sticky and slow moving lacing. A bit of funk and sediment creeps around the bottom of this amber-brown beauty. Very fine looking ale.  S - floral and somewhat fruity hops sit the pace with the slightest hint of dark fruit. Molasses and caramel whiffs give this brew a sturdy malt backbone. Rye spices creep up toward the back of the nose.  T - sweet with a rye spice character. Hops are floral like with sometimes big hints of fruitiness about them as well(the hops). Caramel malt and molasses are spot on offering this big and complex flavor the balance it needs. It's sweet, spicy, bitter hoppy, floral and fruity. A real treat in a bottle. Alcohol/rye spice in the Finish that is on the bitter side, but still very enjoyable and does nothing but add to the tastiness of this jewel.  M - big and thick texture. Coats the mouth with a liquid that's nothing but world class. Some alcohol paired with the rye lets off some bitterness but it balances everything else out perfectly. Really enjoyable mouthfeel.  O - instant favorite of mine. From the first sip this brew became something I will always be able to drink and enjoy. It's just a matter of finding a way of getting it here where I live. Easily 1 of the 10 best tasting brews for me personally I've ever had. It has a bit of everything for it and I'm extremely glad I picked it up. Bear Republic is becoming one of my favorite breweries and I can't even get their brews here. They are definitely pumping out some of the world's best tasting brews and I look forward to getting my hands on more Hop Rod Rye.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,DJScroggins,4.21,"Picked up a bomber of this at the recommendation of a friend.  Dark amber. Creamy mocha head that fades quickly. Thick lacing.  Fruity (smells a bit of apple pulp), citrusy hops. The rye is subtle but there.  Don't get much of the sweetness in the taste, but rye is more pronounced with bitter hops. Mildly bitter finish. I expected a more bitter/dryer finish, but was pleasantly surprised as rye sort of just settled on my tongue as the hops faded.  Relatively heavy body. Smooth. Light carbonation.  I adore rye ales and enjoy IPA's. This is a worthy hybrid of the two. It's definitely still an IPA, the hops an grapefruit are still in control, but the rye plays nicely in the background.

Tropical fruit, apple, and tobacco.  T - Surprisingly, rye is not a dominant feature. Hints of tobacco, apple, nutmeg and brown sugar with a somewhat bitter rye finish.

610,3158,RickS95,4.28,"Extremely dark for an IPA, but Bear calls it an amber so I'll go with that. Not entirely brown, more a burgundy brown. Held to a light it resembles the color of wine. Up top is a fleeting IPA-like collection of foamy bubbles. Retention isn't impressive, but there's a nice lace and a ring of bubbles left behind.  Kind of a strange smell, with a party of citrus, rye and caramel all vying for attention.  The taste is strange as well, but it works. The brewers did a good job of providing just enough of each contrasting ingredient to keep the taste buds working. Orange peel, malted rye, caramel and even some vanilla just before the finish.  Mouthfeel is complex with a battle of sweet and bitter. It's very crisp in the swallow, leaving a faint burn as it hits your throat. A good composite of malt up front and hops following. The bitterness isn't lingering, leaving you ready for the next drink.  Overall, Bear Republic has done a good job with this. It's really easy to drink, has a truckload of flavor, and the alcohol is high, but not aggressive. Well done.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,WheelsPSU,4.49,"Technically, rye is an accompaniment to this beer as its listed as an Imperial strength IPA brewed with 18 rye malt. That being said, the rye in this beer gives a deliciously spicy flair.  Poured from a 22 oz bomber, it was copper in color with tons of sediment floating. I checked the bottle and it indeed states ""unfiltered."" The lacing was long, leaving large froth all over the glass.  The smell was not all rye. Rather a delicious IPA nose of grapefruit and pine with the added bonus of the rye.  The taste was spicy and peppery from the rye. A bit bitter that eventually gave way to a bread like spice.

610,3158,Jekyll,4.21,"American IPA or DIPA or rye IPA?!?! Who the hell knows? So judgement based primarily on not pinning it down to a specific style. Great spicy bitterness from the rye and amazing hop presence throughout. Not much balance so I can see why many would not identify it in the DIPA category as a strong malt backbone is required by some to qualify as a good IPA. I can't pin down the style and can easily identify it as all the 3 I mentioned as well as dare I say an American strong ale to boot. Good solid beer my only qualm and it is a small one is I tried this in a 22oz bomber and the mouthfeel and flavor seemed to dissipate on the last 1/2 of the bomber. Not sure if this is available in 12oz bottles but if so I would like to re-visit it in that format. Nonetheless no matter the ""identity"" of this beer it is a very satisfying experience.

610,3158,magictacosinus,4.35,"Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. No freshness date, but whatever.  Pours a deep reddish amber color complete with about two fingers worth of an off-white head. Head retention is surprisingly decent, whittling down to a ring complete with semi large bubbles. Lacing is prevalent, although far more in the manner in resembling granite and sugar-soaked drops than anything else. Very dirty looking, actually, almost to the point of being oily. However, I find this personally appealing and as a result makes this more intriguing looking.  This bottle may be a bit old, as the hops in particular are showing signs of breaking apart, but there's still an astonishing varieties of flavor in this thing. There's an initial piney dankness that leads to grapefruit and blood oranges, and then other fruity notes such as cherries and apricots. Peppery, and well as spicy from the rye itself, which smells cracked and vibrant in midst of the hoppy dankness and toasted bready malts. Honey, as well as dried red maple leaves come in. Slightly boozy, although very well covered up by all of these phenols piled on top. Really good stuff - prickly and firm, yet warm and well balanced.  The flavor follows the same schematics as the aroma, but, to my surprise, everything is far more well integrated and even more subtle overall. There's an initial juicy bready, spiced rye character which melds into a massive citrus peel and pine profile that is herbaceous and zesty at the same time. Peppercorn, caramel, nutty flavors, and cereal pleasantries round up the explosion of hops and spice at first. Another thing that heightens the drinking experience is the clean, creamy, near chewy feel of the beer that approaches perfection. Not syrupy by any means, and not too heavy on the palate (or gut), this drinks like an everyday ale despite the intensity of flavors. The aftertaste is only slightly astringent, but otherwise everything goes down like a charm. Alcohol is marvelously hidden, with no bite to speak of. Silky, and ridiculously easy to drink.  I can't believe I passed so many chances to try this until now. While Racer 5 is my personal favorite, this may be, objectively speaking, the best thing I've had from these guys. None of these flavors conflict with each other, and the rye provides a spicy, rustic flavor that is a breath of fresh air for the style. Extremely well crafted, and world class in the realm of hoppy rye beers. I'd love to have this on tap or fresh one of these days. This is a charm to drink any day of the year on any occasion.

Definite floral and pine notes  Spicy hop bite with a slight caramel notes  When aerated in the mouth more caramel malt comes out but fairly thin.  Good beer but more of an IPA than a hybrid hoppy/rye. I would have loved to taste more spicy/caramel rye and malt. If you want more malt taste serve very cold from freezer.

I'm excited to smell the rye in the forefront; even though it's an IPA, I'm really getting into rye beers lately. Taste is deliciously subdued; this isn't a hop bomb, but it has a nice hoppy flavor at first, melding into rye flavors and then finishing into smooth, caramelized malts with a bitter hop pinch at the very end of the aftertaste.

610,3158,GoblueMS,4.75,"Sitting in a hotel room in Breaux Bridge, LA after consuming copious amounts of seafood tonight, I pulled a bottle out of my cooler that dutifully accompanies me on my business trips. Mind you this is not my first rodeo with Hop Rod Rye (more on that later). But this is an excellent product.  The appearance of this poured into a glass is caramel colored with excellent lacing down the glass, with a half inch head remaining. Smell is of muted hops with a hint of rye. Taste is outstanding (though in the last 8 years of having this on hand I have had to drain pour a few bottles, probably due to them having been abused in the distribution pipeline. They were spoiled.). I first tasted HRR at a brewfest in Portland in 2005, and it was love at first taste! There is little way to say how good this iteration of a rye IPA is. It is chewy, complex, simple, quenching, enticing, and of course most satisfying all at the same time. Overall I would say that this is a world class brew, and one that anyone who is a hophead should choose.  I won't go into the detail that so many patrons of BA render (not that there is anything wrong with that!), but this is one of the finest IPAs in my mind to ever hit the market. Try one and agree!  If you like a rye style IPA, this one should be on your list. I have it brought in from adjacent states to MS when ever possible. Excellent brew, and now this bottle is gone!

Smell - Aroma is a mix of bready richness from the rye, with notes of caramel and malt. There is just a hint of hoppiness. Very promising.  Taste - Rye bread with a kick from the hops, and well balanced with malty semi-sweetness. Finish is pleasant with some lingering bitterness. I would like a little more bite, but I do like the fact that you can really taste the rye base.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with a nice amount of carbonation to support the chewiness of the beer.

A lot to take in.  M - A real wild ride, high level of complexity in the mouthfeel. Starts off fresh and wet, then picks up with bitterness and just as it peaks it slides off with a sweet counterpoint.

610,3158,Hendry,4.02,"Bear Republic beers are highly rated, and I bought Racer 5 based on that fact: it really missed the mark for me. This bottle of Hop Rod Rye was a gift from a friend who swaps beers with me, and he didn't seem to think much of it based on the fact that he read it was ""one of the top beers that changed the world.""  Where Racer 5 left me flat, Hop Rod Rye was a very pleasant surprise. Pours a deep rich amber with a reddish hue, relatively small head and not much in the way of lacing,and really no cap either. Aesthetics aside, the aroma is pleasant with some piney hops and a touch of spicy rye that thankfully doesn't show up in the taste. Other rye ales have a tendency to be acrid, not the case with Hop Rod Rye.  Medium bodied and well carbonated, it is a bit thin in some respects. The hops are present but it is extinguished by a heavy maltiness that is rich, yet pleasant at the same time. This is an enjoyable beer with a distinct flavor that is worth trying at least once.

The aromas are really rich, juicy nectarine, lemon candies, rich florals, hay, some ‘bakery-like’ sweetness, with the rye malt standing out. Fresh citrusy hops, but a real rye malt character, amazingly complex. 4.5  T- a rich array of juicy floral hop bitterness, nectarine, pineapple, tropical fruits, even some berries, balanced really well with a sour rye maltiness that adds a countering kick, some cashew nuttiness, pine nuts, pepper, the rye is a big star here. Then tartness (lemon, kiwi) and a bit of oiliness on the finish, but clean, a bit of mild ‘pine forest’ hops. This is downright delicious. 4.5  M- Big presence, rather slight carbonation, smooth oily hopiness but also some perceptibly malty body with a bit of the sour candy/rye feel (sour cherry blasters). A coating slickness, a lasting tingle sensation on the finish. Satisfying, no alcohol perceptible behind the hops and rye. 4  A real must try beer.

Oh well, I must review it as-is. If the brewer cared about age, then obviously they'd tell me when this beer was bottled.  Medium body and a nice, oily feel, but whatever flavor exists is absolutely dead. I get some toast and marmalade up front, a little bit of rye at mid palate, then nothing.  I'm not even finishing this. Major drain-pour. It isn't even worth the calories in the glass. Do I think this beer is better than what I experienced? Absolutely. Will I give it another chance? Hell no. I know we're not supposed to slam beers, but this is what the brewer gets for selling a product with no freshness date on the bottle. This stuff tastes dead. I could make a better beer than this with an all-extract homebrew kit. Bear Republic should be ashamed of themselves for allowing their product to sit on shelves this long. I've tried two of their beers now and both of them were bland, boozy disasters.  EDIT: Another BA graciously told me where to find freshness data on the bottle.

Some pepper, rye, bits of caraway and licorice root. Really picking up the citrus and yeast as it warms up. Really nice! A wonderful mix of spicey rye, tropical fruit and citrus, pine and caramel. No one flavor dominates, they all just flow together and stick to different parts of your tongue. Pineapple-orange marmalade spread on lightly toasted whole grain rye bread. Pink grapefruit and grain notes stand out as it warms while the nose has more and more pineapple. The 8% is very well hidden and you don't so much taste it as you do feel the weight of it on the tongue. Sparks of CA citrus, HI tropical fruit, and mid-west grains. The rye really steps up to the plate. This could be a dangerous all day drinker. It just flows so easily. I'm so glad this one is finally near me in 4-packs instead of just bombers.

610,3158,ThisWangsChung,3.8,"Portion of a 22 oz bottle poured into a nonic pint glass.  A: Pours a dark burnished copper color. The head is an attractive one-finger offwhite shade that is somewhat creamy-looking in texture. It also fades slowly to provide nice lacing on the glass.  S: This almost comes off like a low-strength barleywine instead of an IPA, or even a DIPA for that matter. Grapefruit peel pops out at me first, before being followed up by caramel, brown sugar, and piny hops. Not much rye comes through here, but the aroma is quite enjoyable.  T: The faint sweetness from the caramel that initially pops up slowly gives way to a finish of grapefruit peel and black pepper. Given the chance to open up, it develops a very solid rye tone near the finish. Probably the most enjoyable feature here is the hop/malt balance. The flavor strikes me as being very 'savory' in general, instead of being sweet or bitter.  M: I notice many hoppy rye ales have a sharpness to them, whether it be from carbonation or the rye malts themselves - and this is no exception. Here, it seems to be from the former. Once the medium-high carbonation fades a bit, the feel becomes balanced if not exactly mellow.  O: I like this one. Not the most drinkable ever, but I love how rich the rye flavors are without killing the balance.

Just wish it was a little more sticking.  Taste: Little sour, and has a lemon citrus feel to it but also bitter. Lightly piney-ness to it. To take a sip is tough on this one, it improves progressively as you get closer to the end of the glass.  Mouth: The mouthfeel comes off with a little light to medium combination.

Taste is a better balance than one might expect from a west coast IPA with hops first followed by roasted malt, rye, some alcohol and a hint of citrus. Mostly full bodied, dry finish, medium effervescence. Cleans the palate nicely. Slightly warming as well.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Jake_Ramrod,4.13,"I've always been a Red Ale fan, so I was excited to get this in trade from a nice lady in CA. Adding in the rye flavor was a pleasant surprise and worked really well. A really nice beer and one of the best red ales I've had. Enjoyed out of a tulip watching my UK Wildcats whoop that butt.  A: This beer is somewhat cloudy and is a light mahogany-red beer topped with a creamy white head about a half inch in height. The head receded quicker than I would have expected for the carbonation present  S: The smell has a wonderful caramel malt sweetness plus a bit of citrus in the hop character. I have to agree that this nearly smells like a barleywine.  T: I love the flavor of this beer - not too sweet and just a hint of bitterness. The malts lend to a very drinkable beer and the rye grain and hops gives it a funky kick in the end. This has a complex flavor and yet remains extremely drinkable. Tons of flavor.  M: This has a great mouthfeel as the rye leaves a lasting impression that just keeps on going. A bit oily, but it really works.  O: I really enjoyed this beer. IMO, this would pair really well with some Asian food, curries, and meats. It remains a complex beer and yet is completely drinkable and balnced. All the flavors work harmoniously together. Well done and I'll be hunting these out.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Shows good lacing and a low amount of retention.  S: Aromas have a caramel malt sweetness plus tropical fruits, tangerine and grapefruit in the hop character. The smells seem kind of like a barleywine.  T: The taste is initially malty and is quickly followed by a big hop bitterness. I also get the spicy flavor from the rye grain. As the beer warms the hop bitterness is more pronounced.  M: Prickly carbonation and a medium body define the mouthfeel, with a finish that is fruity, hoppy and spicy.

S - 4.0 - Malty sweet and rich honey, pungent hops. Distinct.  T - 4.0 - Can't quite put my finger on the main taste in the body... fairly sweet malt (but not too sweet), very rich. Very manageable bitterness level. To the degree I notice spicy rye, it's only subtly, on the exhale with the aftertaste.  M - 4.25 - Medium heavy body, unexpectedly. Somewhat viscous. Very nice.

Look: Poured a very dark reddish amber color. Semi-clear body. Head was a consistent film of tight eggshell bubbles. Lacing was hit and miss. Not much for carbonation. Notice some floaties in suspension.  Smell: Pungent aroma of a garlic and onion hop character. A very resiny malt quality was in the background. Some booze was noticeable.  Taste: First up was the onion hop note from the aroma. Then the sweet malts hit in the middle. The rye hit in the finish was of mustard seed and pumpernickel. Aftertaste was a mixture of bitterness and sweetness. No real alcohol detected in the taste.  This was a solid Rye.

With rye comes the spice that is perfectly balanced with the element of toasted malts. Bold hops come through in the midpalate finishing off-dry. Quite fruity complementing berry and citrus. Oh, how lovely.  M: a lot of carbonation which would normally turn me off with this style but this beer drinks more like an IPA so its alright. Leaves alittle of an oily texture: medium bodied.

610,3158,dar482,4.69,"There's a rich dark copper, ruby color. The beer starts off with a strong hop and tropical fruit aroma along with tons of apple with a spice rye aroma to it too.  The grapefruit taste pops at the tongue quickly. Then there’s a malt/rye finish that rounds off the beer nicely and brings some amazing sweet tones. It hits with a dry bitterness at the end that hangs around for a while.The taste is piney and bitter, but well done. The crisp from the rye helps the bitterness and gives it some smoothness.  The rye is amazing to help out the body and giving this semi-creaminess to the beer.  The dryness in the end detracts from the beer slightly, but it's pretty different from non-ryed IPAs. Definitely recommend this variation to the style. Everytime I have this beer, it just keeps getting better.

610,3158,mfnmbvp,3.95,"1 pint 6 fl oz. bottle, poured into a Firestone Walker pint glass. No apparent bottled on date present. Never had a beer by Bear Republic before, so I'm keeping it unbiased and unexpected.  A - Pours a dark ruby color with virtually no head at all except a vague white bubbling foam across the surface. Tons of sediment to be seen suspended in motion. Very nice looking lacing coming down the sides. Looks pretty nice indeed.  S - Extreme amounts of hops and rye abound. Vanilla. Oak. Cream. Maybe a hint of dark fruits with a slight hint of bourbon also. Smells very nice, my taste buds are tingling with anticipation.  T - Smooth creamy oaked iced tea type flavor. Not very strong in the way of hops, but still very bitter. Well-balanced and very tasty, to be sure. Has almost some coffee attributes to it in the end, but I think it is more akin to some kind of an English breakfast tea leaf type taste. Very smooth to be masking an 8.00% abv.  M - Sticky mouthfeel, yet smooth and clean at the same time. Resinous, but not overwhelming. Smooth vanilla taste seems to linger.  In all, tastes like a very well made beer, and at five dollars a bottle you can't really go wrong with this. Rivals some of the better Lagunitas offerings like Lagunitas Hop Stoopid or Lagunitas Wilco Tango Foxtrot price-wise, and holds it's own as a unique and complex brew. An intense beer with a nice 8.00% abv masked nicely. A bottle I would have again, to be sure.  Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye ---4/5.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,His_Royal_Hoppiness,4.01,"A: Lovely dark amber colour with an off-white head.  S: Strong smell of citrus, pine and malt.  T: Initial taste is that of a well-balanced IPA, then a distinct malt profile sets in - there's almost a hint of doppelbock to the afteraste. A delicate rye flavour comes through, but because of the strength of the hops, it's much less discernible than in a German roggenbier.  M: Smooth and medium-bodied - alcohol is well-concealed.  I would probably rate this slightly higher if I was paying US prices for it, but at £3 for a 12oz bottle, I was hoping for a bit more complexity - it's straightforward and delicious but I wouldn't go to great lengths to seek it out again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

S: Fruity, citrusy aromas, from the hops but mostly malty from, I guess, the rye. Some burnt sugars, maybe.  T: caramel, malt, flowers, a little grassy. Very balanced sweetness with initial bitterness of the hops. Round flavor.  M: I'd say medium to full body with little carbonation. Goes smooth, no alcohol feeling.  O: Super nice beer.

Nose is typical IPA, pleasant grapefruit, but slightly bready from the unique malts used. First sip is surprisingly mild. The rye malts come through strongly in the middle and the hops aren't as pronounced. In fact this is one of the sweetest IPA's I've had in recent memory. As such the alcohol is almost undetectable. Not a hint of metal or lingering bitterness form the hops, just a really clean finish. Almost ESB-like in its smoothness and balance. Nice hefty body too. An instant favorite, I think!

I bought another bottle a few months ago and have had it in my fridge, wanting to let some space between impressions to see if really was ""all that"". Poured from a bomber into a Reidel stemless chalice.  A: Pours a very dark chestnut / copper, pretty clear until the last pour from the bottle. One finger caramel head is pretty creamy looking and durable, leaving nice lacing down the glass.  S: Nose is aggressive spicy hop and rye with citrus / pine and a bit of booziness. Smells damn good.  T: Taste on this is just lovely, great balance between slightly sweet caramel malts, pretty big hops, somehow perfectly balanced by the rye, with a hint of citrus / floral / honeysuckly flavors. For me, this beer is just so perfectly balanced. Well designed and solidly put together. I wouldn't call it out as 8% ABV without reading the label.  MF: Mouthfeel is refreshing and crisp, though it's pretty full bodied and almost creamy and very coating. So drinkable.  This is a really great beer and honestly the best rye ale I've had (so far).

610,3158,Jugs_McGhee,3.53,"Saw the high ratings so I picked this one up. 8% confirmed. 12 oz bottle into conical Samuel Smith's pint glass in Los Feliz, CA. Reviewed live. Expectations are through the roof. I googled the Bear Republic bottle codes and discovered this was bottled 09/12/12; I'm a little pissed at my bottle shop but I'll give her a spin anyway.  Served straight from the fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a two finger creamy frothy head of good thickness and great retention for the high ABV. Body colour is an unexpected dark copper; semitransparent and translucent. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Decent lacing as the head recedes, but it looks like it'll retain for a good five minutes. The colour is fantastic for an IPA; I'm already impressed.  Sm: Nectary hops are dominant, with some floral character and a bit of pine. Some oily hops. A bit of bitterness comes through, but just enough. Caramel. Sweeter malts than pale malts, but not quite amber or biscuit. Some grapefruit citrus zest and even a more herbal note; perhaps mint? Yes, natural mint leaf. No yeast is detectable, nor is any alcohol. I'm looking forward to trying it. An average strength aroma.  T: Mmm. Hoppy yet incredibly balanced; lots of nectary hop character, with perfect complementary floral and light pine character. A bit of herbal fermented mint leaf aids its refreshing feel. No hop bitterness whatsoever comes through. Shockingly well balanced. Light oily hop notes. Caramel and sweet malts form the simple yet effective foundation - which is more than merely a platform for the hop notes. Slight spice is also detectable. The rye works here beautifully, complementing and cooperating with the nectary hops to give it more depth. No yeast character. No alcohol comes through. Constructively, it's a bit too sweet and the hop character could be much more complex. Lacks subtlety. Still, it's tasty - and let's not forget it's four months old.  Mf: Slightly oily, very nectary, and smooth and wet. Soft and refreshing, yet a bit too thick. Perfect carbonation. Complements the flavour profile very well.  Dr: An incredibly drinkable and refreshing IPA, with a well hidden ABV that'll sneak up on you. $7.99 a four pack is quite fair for a beer of this quality. Bear republic has impressed me. For a four month old IPA, it's rather good. I intend to revisit it fresh; it deserves that respect.

A clear mahogany or rust orange color with no carbonation evident. A hazy with remains leaving some nice lacing down the sides of the glass. Great looking stuff.  SMELL: Lots of hops on the nose. Pale malts, caramel and honeydew melon there, with some nice pineapple, mango and a good dose of piney hops. Bolder as well. Nice stuff.  TASTE: Pale malts, rye malts, and lots of piney hops up front. Sweet mango and honeydew melon as well, leading into a bold and lingering finish. Piney hops, bitter floral notes, some spicy rye with a light caramel sweetness adding some balance to the brew. Very hoppy with a nice spicy element from the rye. Really good.  PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Enough weight on this one, creamy on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes dry. Some bitterness lingers.  OVERALL: This is excellent stuff.

On the nose I get pine sap, grapefruit, a syrupy sweetness, and spicy rye.  On the palate I get everything described in the nose. The forward flavors are dominated by grapefruit and piney, resiny hops. Those flavors linger into a dry, sticky finish of caramel-syrup sweetness and a hint of spicy rye.  Mouthfeel is very hoppy, with high carbonation tickling the tongue long after swallowing.  Overall: A strong hoppy IPA that is matched by its sweet malt with a rye kick.

Smells of pine, resin, grapefruit and tangerine - nice west coast style IPA nose here. I like. Malty flavor with hints of spice and a little sweet hop character (like in the bag hops). Not much in the way of complex IPA though. Sweet with a bit of hop character is what I'm getting. Medium bodied with lower than anticipated carb and a semi dry finish. Decent beer, nothing special.  1st review: 23FEB11: 3/2.5/2/2/2 -2.15 A: Pours dark, deep red with limited translucency. A few more SRM's and this one would qualify for a CDA/ABA. Single finger, peanut colored head dissipates quickly leaving fairly confluent foam sheet. Limited lacing. S: Some citrus, but predominantly, this is very, very similar to their Red Rocket - maybe because the beer has been sitting on the shelf too long - but too bad, learn to date your product. Lots of malt, smells like a red or ESB. T: Yep, about the same as the Red Rocket. Too bad. Getting low marks for this. If an IPA is to be had fresh, date your bottles!

610,3158,SassieCassie,3.73,"This is one tasty beer.  Pours a dark red color, slight head served in a pint glass. The scent is not over bearing but you definitely smell hops with little floral notes mixed in.  The carbonation is strong, lighting up the taste buds. The taste is not too sweet with a very light syrupy feel. It's definitely hoppy, and it finishes nicely with a small hint of rye.  It's simple and strait to the point. My kind of beer. You can't beat the flavor for the price, and heck... the abv :)",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Philousa,3.58,"Pours dark red, nearly brown, with a thick tan head that dwindles to only stick to the glass. Laing is moderate. Caramel, slight chocolate, and spicy, sweet rye. Smells like fermentation ended a bit earlier than most IPAs (read: sweet). Definitely a good dose of piney, slightly citrusy hops. Spicy flavor in the rye is up front and lasting, accompanied by dark chocolate and thick, sweet caramel. Lots of specialty malt additions in this one. The sweetness sticks in the back if the throat a bit, pungent and annoying. There is an alcohol aftertaste that cuts this feel a bit, it's welcome. The bitterness from the hops cut it a bit, with some grapefruit rind. Feel is solid, middling, and appropriate for the style.   This is a wild beer. Lots of flavors are battling it out on the palate. It's a little too much, but it's also intriguing. Although I'm not thinking of drinking this every day, it's a fun one once in a while.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Leaves a brilliant lacing pattern  Smell: Citrusy and piney, like a hoppy beer would be. A bit of malt comes through.  Taste: Absolutely delicious. Fairly sweet and malty, with quite a bit of rye coming through. The hops definitely come through throughout the sip, but do not overpower all that's going on in this brew. Leaves a bit of a hoppy finish, too.  Mouthfeel: medium-heavy on the palette. Modest carbonation comes through and the alcohol is very nicely hidden, but not entirely so.  Overall: Definitely tasty and a fine brew to kick back and relax with. Don't expect a ton of complexity with it, but it definitely does a good job at what it is. It's also a dangerously drinkable beer at ~8% ABV. Sessionable? I think so.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Smell – A very nice hoppy smell with a bit of pine and a nice floral scent. Also a hint of sweet lemon and malt.  Taste – Taste is somewhat similar to the smell with a touch of rye.  Mouthfeel – Carbonation went away shortly after the pour. A thin syrupy texture. The 8%abv is very well hidden in the taste.

Aroma is loaded with hop juiciness, mainly pine and grass and some nice malt sweetness as well. Taste is very smooth, bitter throughout, some grapefruit and nice sweetness in the background on the back end. Insanely drinkable for a high abv, no alcohol anywhere in the tasting. This must be an expensive beer to make, it's clearly loaded up with malt and hops. Awesome.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,shand,4.89,"Hop Rod Rye pours a hazy red-brown color with a smaller head. The aroma is outstanding, citrusy hops and spicy rye rule here, along with some caramel malts. The taste is just about tailor made for me - it's got a huge hop kick along with a massive amount of rye spiciness. There's a bit more of a pine flavor in the hops than the nose let on, which works excellently with the rye. This is a big and brash beer, which is perfect for me. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and has that hop dryness that can only come from a massive amount of hops. The drinkability is superb. Overall, Hop Rod Rye is really a beer that's just about tailor-made for me. I love rye beers and huge IPAs.

610,3158,StonedTrippin,4.33,"been meaning to get on this one for awhile. this is a monster beer. hands down one of the most hoppy and most complex rye beers ive had. it pours a deep indian brown color with just a bit of haze. looks pretty dense, with some light coming through, but not much. theres about a one inch off white head on it, but it recedes pretty quickly. the nose is very very hoppy. sticky sweet dank hops, oily and aggressive. theres also some spice from the rye, bready and pungent, as well as a darker sweeter malt profile than i expected when i bought it. the flavor is unreal. so much going on. at first sip its a hop trip, high alpha and mean, but that gets interrupted fairly quickly by a really distinct and different peppery rye flavor that comes out of nowhere and lasts the rest of the time. sweeter malt kicks up at the end, and the bitter aspect of the hops finally comes back. the finish is long and complex. this is a gem as far as flavor journey goes, more rye heavy than any ive had i think. mouthfeel is good, big and thick on the body, with enough carbonation to make it dangerously drinkable. there is some hop resin left in the mouth though that is a love it or hate it kind of thing. i think it makes the beer come across a bit heavy, but thats just me. this is a perfect cold weather beer, with all the necessary elements. high abv, big hop, lots of body, and stick to your guts malt. this is worth the hype for sure.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,DrinkMoreBigBeers,4.45,"Did not see any date on the bottle. Nor have I from any bear republic beers.  A - Poured out a Clear mahogany red color with a one finger off white head. Head died down and left a frothy supper tiny bubbled head clinging to the sides of the glass. Impressive lacing on this one.  S - Can smell the nice distinct pine off of the hops with some citrus and a spicy zest of the rye in there. Also get caramel malts and a sweetness here. Nice clean enjoyable smelling brew.  T - I can really taste the spice coming off of the rye in this one with a distinct pine flavor from the hops. The combination of pine and spicy rye gives way to a nice earthy-ness, along with a sweet dark bready caramel presence. The alcohol comes in on the back end, and cleans the palate getting you ready for the next drink. On a side note, hops build on your palate but do not overtake the other flavors like some other big hoped up beers tend to do.  M- Medium full bodied, creamy and smooth to the mouth.  O - For a rye beer this is a must try with a lot of positive aspects to it. I do wish Bear Republic would get with it and date their bottles. Not sure how fresh my bottle is however it is really enjoyable none the less. One that I will revisit when in the mood for a great Rye IPA.

A healthy amount of bakery bread and pine forrest along with a citrus grove spiciness. Light sweet alcohol. Taste is so big, malty and smooth at first. Then BAM hops hit like a velvet fist with a lovely grapefruit and hop oil finish. This is full of spicy rye bread and malt to give it a nice chewy flavor and overall feel. Finish is quite nice with dry graininess and a light minty grapefruit. Feel is lightly syrupy and chewy with a nice smooth carbonation. A great robust beer that rewards sipping but begs you to keep it up so seductively that the glass is empty before you know it. Very drinkable and no real notice of the abv so watch out.

610,3158,micromaniac129,4.45,Pours a deep copper amber with a very tall head. The head is dense and sticky with lots of lacing. It's extremely carbonated so I don't think the head is going anywhere.  Aroma finds a more reserved bouquet of oily hops grapefruit and tangerine. Malts have a caramel sweetness and a hint of rye.  Tastes great and well rounded. Malts are sweet yet have a spicy crispness. It counters the hops boldness perfectly. Hops are quite bitter with grapefruit seeming to be the dominate flavor. Tangerine too is present as is a floral background. An incredibly easy drinking beer.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BuxMontBeerLover,4,"Purchased at Atlantic Liquors in Rehoboth Beach, DE  Poured into and reviewed from a DFH Pint Glass  A - Beer pours a deep amber/reddish copper color. A very fluffy, beige colored, one-finger head on the initial pour that gradually fades to a light skim. Huge amount of sticky lacing left on the glass.  S - An earthy aroma with hints of hops and caramel/toffee.  T - The beer hits you on several levels. The initial taste is rather hoppy, slightly bitter with a hint of citrus. Then you get a sweet caramel-like aftertaste. A spiciness is also present from the rye. The beer is well balanced and goes down really smooth. The ABV is barely detectable.  M - A medium consistency. A decent amount of carbonation the tingles the tongue.  O - I enjoyed this beer. Being a fan of hoppy beers, this gives you some great hop bitterness and spiciness with a nice sweetness to round things out. Well crafted. Nice brew, Bear Republic. Recommended!

Strong notes of bitter orange peel against a firm backdrop of nuts, milk chocolate,  cereal, and that grainy almost spicy hint of rye.  T - nutty almost like an extremely light roast of coffee up front. Bright citric hops enter mid palate while a dark grainy bread character provides balance along with some vague hints of dried fruit esters in the form of raisins.

610,3158,RussBecker1,4.77,"A- Beautiful deepness and complexity of colors. The body is a deep mahogany which is only made prettier by the white head that sits atop the glass. Both colors play off of each other in a nicely distinct way.  S- Delicious smell. The rye strand is apparent but does not overpower the hops, which in turn does not over power the citrus and other spices that compliment the beer. It is pretty remarkable to have such a smooth distinction between each flavor without one overshadowing the other.  M-Crisp and effervescent, but still able to coat the taste buds and prepare them for the complexities of the beer.  T-Wow.

610,3158,viverlee,4.78,"Why I don’t drink this more often is still a mystery to me. The first time, it was ludicrous, barley pancakes and hoppy syrup. Once or twice in between, buttered flowers on toasted rye bread. Today, I’m nearly out of worthy descriptors.  I’m in my 30s now, having missed the sexting and DTF foam party generation. The silver lining, maybe, is that I get to experience the craft revolution at a time in my life when I have some bills to spare. And this Down To Quaff beer is a tastegasm worth enjoying now.  STYLE: Rye Beer  ABV: 8%  LOOK: Forest brown, copper highlights. The glass sweats, my mouth waters. It’s thick, rich, sturdy. Most importantly, it has structural integrity. A half-finger head could easily be confused with a protein shake. It moves with the beer, like pudding, without thinking. It’s just built that way – it has no choice.  NOSE: Strong hoppy nose. Herb butter, grapefruit, lemon peel, pine. Honey and subtle spices, I’m not sure what, pop in to say hello.  MOUTH: Bold statement time: It might be the most balanced beer I’ve ever had. In a different way, I think Allagash Curieux would give it a good run, and maybe prevail. But that’s another review for another time. This one, oh my. Sweet, bitter, malty, floral, distinctive. Three things happen with each sip. First, my nose swells with aroma, mostly buttered hops. Next, a soft soft blanket slowly coats the inside, then the outside, of my mouth, tongue to cheeks to lips to throat. Finally, the perfect astringent bite, a special reminder of who’s the boss.

Awesome retention and lacing. Clear with a moderate amount of bubbles.  S – Toasted malts, spicy rye, and a generous dose of hops with orange, grapefruit, mango, peach, pineapple, and some grassy, herbal aromas. Smells terrific.  T – Starts with sweet and toasty malts but rapidly shifts toward the earthy, smoky, spicy taste of rye. Bitter hops gradually work their way into the forefront with grapefruit, orange, mango, grassy, and herbal notes. Delicious.  F – Medium-to-full-bodied with good carbonation, a sticky, chewy, and spicy mouthfeel, and a spicy, bitter, and dry finish. Hop bitterness and fruitness lingers for a little while, but the spicy and earthy rye works its way back in and lingers for longer. There’s a very subtle throat-warming sensation from the alcohol that makes an appearance at the finish as well.  O – This beer is outstanding. It’s like a good DIPA, but the added rye makes it more unique. This beer really has very few flaws. It looks and smells amazing, tastes great, and has a terrific mouthfeel.

610,3158,ddean,4.43,"A pretty, dark amber/red color. A pour from bottle to pint glass gives some intense bubbles on the side of the glass that dissipate over a couple of minutes and a thin but nice foam lacing. I would give a chance for the beer to warm up a bit so as to get a solid feel for its complex scent and flavor.  And what a sensory experience. The aroma was not as hoppy or citrusy or strong to me as others report for them, but some hops right up front, followed by a pleasant combination of roasted malt and brown sugar as the glass warmed up. Delicious taste, with sweet malt, dark cherries, a nice, balanced bite from the hops and rye. Mouthfeel is perfect, a smooth followup to the taste with a lingering, yummy hint of cherries, chocolate, and red grapefruit.

Smell is sweet rye with faint hops. Taste - first thing that struck me was a definate note of buckwheat honey. This is probably the mix of the sweet malt and darker rye malt but if you've ever had buckwheat honey, it has a very distinct flavor that is what this beer reminds me of. Also notes of toffee and very nicely balanced hops. Mouthfeel is slick and coating, goes down smooth. Rated the best Rye beer for a reason.

610,3158,dmatsui,4.66,"Appearance: Tulip from a bottle, aggressive pour yields a tight, off-white three finger head which dissipates quickly leaving gorgeous, soapy lacing after each sip. Pours a dark Mahogany brown with lovely little hop floaties.  Smell: Heavy hop presence, but not particularly bright or citrusy. Aroma is mostly dominated by the malt base which smells sweet, biscuity and has a distinct spice and earthiness from the rye addition. Not the most aromatic beer, but I believe that the lighter hop aroma allows the rye to be showcased.  Taste: Very complex. First the hops come through, again more bittering hops than citrus (chinook, citra, etc) but distinctly Norcal IPA character. The hops are nicely supported by the rye addition which brings more earthiness and spice, hints of cinnamon and lemongrass come through mid-palate. Hop Rod Rye rounds out and finishes nicely with a caramel maltiness that goes very well with the rye, with just a touch of warm alcohol at the end.  Mouthfeel: slightly sticky, oily and full-bodied. Again, that rye addition provides for some spice. Nice, tight carbonation and a dry finish really satisfies. Not exactly a session brew but at the same time very drinkable.  The careful marriage of hops, malt and rye provide for an interesting and unique experience, another winner from Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,SmashPants,4.18,"Bottle: solid 355mL brown bottle. Funky (and perhaps a bit tacky) label. A very U.S. package.  Appearance: Pours a dark and hazy amber colour. Dense and creamy light tan head, similar to an English ale. Nice.  Aroma: Sweet malt aroma - caramel and brown sugar. Pine and grapefruit hops. Strong, almost pungent in its heavily hopped nature.  Taste: Very, very big flavours, true to U.S. IPA style. Again, caramel and brown sugar, grapefruit and pine hop flavours. Very well combined, super smooth for an 8% ale.  Aftertaste: That big hop flavour dissipates slightly to be replaced with a calm bitterness. Lingers for quite a while - very nice.  Mouthfeel: medium carbonation, complements the beer nicely. Medium-bodied.  Overall: A nicely made American IPA, addition of rye makes for a very interesting beer. Unfortunately in Australia, the price is far too high at AU$130 a case (2012).

Pours a dark tea color with a fair head...lacing seems pretty impressive.  This beer has a definite caramel sweetness to it, with a definite earthiness to it as well. The spicy rye is present and accounted for and is easily detectable. The hops come out on the finish with a resiny quality to them that lasts a fair while into the aftertaste.

Very strong grapefruit, yes, a bit of spicy rye, some dark fruit as well, I actually get almost like a prune aroma. Pretty good.  T: Wow, so much going on in this beer. Piney and grapfruit hops, dark malts, and to me, just a hint of rye coming through. Not overly bitter. Some alcohol warming at the end. Almost like a full bodied double IPA, but with a very interesting malt expression. Nothing takes center stage in this beer, very well balanced.  M: Full bodied. This beer is filling and with such an interesting flavor profile not very drinkable. But still enjoyable, the full body of this beer adds to its complexity.

Robust brown pour with a precious inch of foam. Rye comes through of course in the nose and palate, hops are bouncing out, but there is such a nice toast present. Beautifully hopped, American-West Coast but mild blend to work with that sweet, but mildly bitter caraway malt. The balance is perfect.

Smells of heady malt, piney hops and yeast are present on a non overbearing nose. Just an inviting aroma.  Taste is outstanding, built on a strong rye malt backbone with a firm hoppy bitterness. Hops are clean and forward, but not overdone.  Leaves a clean bitterness on the palate and back of the throat. Complex but still refreshing. Very drinkable and yet interesting enough to ponder what went into its creation.

Muddled clarity through some chilled haze, but ample carbonation is apparent beneath the persistent head and ring of lace.  S: Loads of spicy hops, funky yeast and bready twang as well as a mild, herbal tea-like sweetness.  T: Fairly sweet and rich up front with a fruity and floral malt complex comprised of bready malts, dates, fennel seed and spicy hop additions. The finish is rich, smooth and roasted with a hints of caramel and bready sweetness awash with bitter, citrusy and complex hops.  M: Full-bodied with a smooth, balanced feel that's accentuated with some slight tartness and spice from the rye malt.  O: A really nice, big rye beer at 8% ABV. It strays from the Rye-PA most folks are used to, but is still pretty liberal with the hops. Perhaps it's just my perception, as the complex malts and careful balance steal the show here. I'd get it again, for sure.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

I had heard the name mentioned around, but for some reason, I just didn't give it a try for quite a while. I was not let down! I love the appearance of this beer! A nice dark brown color, a TON of lacing sticking all the way down the glass to the very finish. About a 1 finger head with the pour. Not too impressed with the aroma, too piney for me, but hey, the taste was GREAT! The mouthfeel was nice, with medium carbonation. Overall, a VERY good Rye beer!

Smell - Smells of peppery rye and a bit of pine, with a hint of citrus in the background.  Taste - Lots of rye in the flavor, from start to finish. In that you'll find notes of citrus and subtle pine. There's a touch of caramel sweetness, and it leads the flavor into the aftertaste, with notes of tangy sourness.  Mouthfeel - Medium body. A touch sticky. Carbonation is a tad on the low side. Finishes dry.  Overall - This beer gets high marks, but frankly I find it a tad boring. It's got all the elements, but for whatever reason they just don't work for me. Maybe it's the dryness.

A malty sweetness rounds out the aroma and there’s a good amount of dark, malty sweet notes on the flavor, along with an evident bitterness and a rye spiciness on the finish.. I am thinking of caramel malts, almost like a barleywine-ish “lite” sort of feel and finish—not to mention appearance.

Clearish, with some bubbles. Heavy lacing.  S: Sweet malts, citrus hops, and a touch of spice that is unlike any rye I've encountered before. A sort of caramelly pine. Good.  T/M: Full, rich, and decadent. The 18% rye bill shines through by providing spicy edges and a dry aftertaste that is unexpected after the huge barley base. The maintaste -- excepting the edges -- is distantly sticky and lightly bready, sort of like biscuits and molasses. Piney hops complete the picture.  O: An excellent beer, far better than I remember it being. Recommended, and would drink again, though not what I typically expect from a Rye IPA (less spicy-dry, more thick-sweet).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

S - Citrus bomb. Orange peel, lemon, some pine, some earthy rye character in the background. Very aromatic beer.  T - Surprisingly sweet and caramely up front. The dry rye flavor comes in toward the middle along with increasing hop bitterness. Fruity, citrusy hop flavor is prominent throughout. Finish is bitter, refreshing, slightly candy-sweet like a barleywine. Overall a very unique and refreshing West-coast hop grenade of a beer.  M - Medium body.

Resin and a hint of citrus hop accompany rye, but are somewhat subtle.  Flavor reveals more hop character. Grapefruit, lemon, and pine comprise the initial flavor, ending in a decidedly bitter rye aftertaste. A slightly sweet toasted malt backbone ties together the hop onslaught.  Body is moderate to slightly heavy, with moderate carbonation and a hint of alcohol warmth.  Overall, the aroma was a bit misleading. Hops are definitely the stars of this brew, accentuated by a bready malt and rye bitterness.

Sits on top the caramel malt with a balanced presence. Great spicy finish that isn't cloying at all. Slightly earthy hop balance that lends some lemon rind to the mid palate.  The mouth feel is really what makes this big beer seems so balanced. The medium full body brings the terrific backbone that hoppy rye of this magnitude needs.  Overall I really like this brew.

One finger of yellowish tan head, decent retention, really nice lacing.  Smell is floral and grassy hops with some citrus peel, and light spice prickling the nose. It's rounded, smooth, and very ""dark brown"" (can smells have color?). A really nice stable stage, like a rounded ball, that allows the highlights (hops and rye, duh) to poke out and show their stuff during brief solos.  On to the taste. Wow, there is some serious rye flavor in there! Grainy and spicy up front, followed by a kick of bitterness. Late on, the rye comes back in and does a little duet with the hop bitterness. Alcohol is barely detectable. The hop bitterness is more dominant than I'd like, but otherwise it's quite tasty.  Mouthfeel is unobtrusive. Surprisingly light for such a big beer. Carbonation right where I'd expect to be. Not bad, but not the highlight of the beer.  This is the first rye beer that's really impressed me.

Caramel, toast stand out... perhaps a hint of hops here and there.  Taste is strongly bitter. While I like my strong ales sweet, I dig 'em like this too... good malt complexity and a smack of bitterness. Good hop flavors too with citrus standing out, so I hardly doubt its freshness, although I have no way of being 100% certain.

610,3158,MattyV,4.24,"Pours a deep copper color with a fair bit of floaties and a thin light tan head. The aroma's a pungent mixture of sweet caramel and spicy/citrus hops. The malt profile plays a prominent role in the taste - sweet toffee, bready, and spicy flavors are all present. The big malt body is balanced by a fair amount of piney/citric bitterness which seems to hit hard at first then mesh nicely with the malt leading to a long, pleasant balanced finish. The rye is detectable and lends a nice layer of spicy earthy complexity to the malt profile but doesn't overwhelm the beer. This full-flavored ale is also moderate to full-bodied with a slightly creamy and oily mouthfeel. I fear this may have spent a bit of time on the store shelf before I picked it up, but it still proved to be a great rye beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,rowmine,4.82,"Loved this beer.  A - Poured clean with a 1.5 inch head leaving nice lacing on the head. Nice rich color.  S - Smell has quite the balance of malt and rye and hops.  T - Taste reflects the smell although the hops aroma comes through, the striking bitterness often associated with that punget a smell is lacking.  M - Nice medium body. Could use a little more carbination.  O - Loved it, not a rye DIPA which others may be looking for but a SOLID rye IPA. Deff will be buying again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Hopdaemon39,4.62,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass- poured a dark and clear mahogany color with a one finger head; dissipated quickly, left a little oil slick foam on the surface, and some nice lacing rings.  Smell is very enticing- full and round scents of hops and rye. Not too sharp but as I said, very enticing.  Taste does not disappoint- very smooth because of how well balanced it is. Sweet amber malts balance with the sharper rye flavor well, along with minimal hop bitterness but maximum hop flavor. Excellent.  Mouthfeel is generally not as carbonated as I like it but it is very refreshing. Light to medium bodied with very little carbonation. For some reason it suits the flavor profile. I""ll definitely get this again- rate it up there with Red's Rye PA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Smells a but nutty as well.  T: I like the taste. It's got a good rich bready taste up front and then follows with a bitter hoppy taste of grapegruit type hops. Very good flavors which melt well together.  M: Lighter mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation.  O: overall, i like this beer. I would drink it again and would like to try an even fresher beer. I believe this was from September 2011.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,pants678,2.9,"It's a dark but clear brown, I couldn't get much of a head on the pour.  Little citric with grainy earth tones, rye of course.  Not so bitter, I'd have to call it a notched-down IPA. Carbonation isn't so aggressive, same goes for the hops. Seemed to be a one note brew here. Maybe I'm just not that into rye, it is sorta floral and sorta spicy but I'm not picking up much sweetness. Hop Rod's not offensive, but it's not terribly interesting either.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Absumaster,4.12,"A deep copper beer with a thin head. Lots of shades of copper, gold, amber.  Smell is great, a good citric smell with grapefruit, pineapple and mango. Some hints of honey, of the sweet malt. It adds a dextrinous malty smell, which combines great with the hops.  Taste is a sweet malty base, with what I guess is the rye malt that adds a slightly nutty taste and what I would describe as wild rice, maybe even some light husk. Though not astringent. The bitterness is not too high like an average IPA. It goes well with the malt. The hops are really balanced. They add an exotic taste that has pineapple, mango and some grapefruit.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,TheBeerAlmanac,4,"Bottle poured into a tulip  A: Pours a rich, dark burgundy with a thin, grayish tan layer of fizz; it looks really thick.  S: Smell is of earthy and citrus hop notes with some malty grain and a slight lingering sweetness. Great balance on the nose really amplifies anticipation.  T/M: Carbonation is relatively high considering the viscous consistency. Biscuit sweet malt on the forefront is balanced by a long but pleasing earthy bitterness. Gravity feels high which disguises the alcohol well.  It's touted as super hoppy but it's much more balanced than it lets on, a really wonderful rich beer.

610,3158,RandyV,4.42,"Deep amber color, not a significant head but nice,sticky lacing in the glass. A really nice bouquet of flowery hops, malt and maybe some citrus peel.  The taste is of a nice combination of bitter hops with malt sweetness always having a presence. The rye spiciness fills the middle and really gives this beer a nice kick. It finishes slightly dry but again, the malt never leaves the scene. This is another stellar offering from Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Labeerfinder,4.48,"Dark brownish amber with a foamy off white head. Lots of hops and malts in the aroma and flavor.

610,3158,TMath524,4.16,"Popped a 12 oz. bottle I picked up down in MA. Bought it based on the rave reviews, but only picked up two single bottles because disgusting design work always makes me skeptical.  Poured it into a Maine Beer Co. Pint glass. Nice one-(fat-)finger head. Color is reddish brown like a maple demi-glace.  Nose is what I'd expect from a good rye beer, but I'm not getting much of the hops, which I expected since I read what the copywriter put on that seriously tacky label.  Taste is really smooth, with the hops and carbonation coming in towards the middle, and hanging out after the rye disappears with the liquid like two strangers who meet half way through a decent party, then have a great conversation and decide to go out for drinks when the host runs out of good liquor and the lame co-workers take over the iPod playlist. Overall, a winner.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,danieelol,3.8,Thanks to Chris @ Slowbeer  Pours a lovely red gold colour with real nice head and lacing. Bit of sediment visible.  Smell is so much grape(y) hops and spicy malt. Really sharp and hits the nose. Nelson Sauvin?  Taste is more grape mixed with malt. The rye provides spice and astringency.  Mouthfeel is medium with decent bitterness and some alcoholic astringency.  Overall an enjoyable beer. Little bit one note though in the grape/spice thing. I'll always be generous with intensely hoppy beers regardless.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Brewsky29,4.5,"This beer pours a deep orange with a half inch of creamy head that dissipates to a coating, with lacing you need to scrape of with a brillo pad.  The smell is of citrusy hops, a tiny bit of rye and malt.  Taste is citrus hops light rye and malt and a bit of a perfume like flavor hard to pinpoint it and hoppy aftertaste the mellows nicely.  Smooth with light carbonation.

S: Grassy, citrus, and floral hops are all present along with the malts. Hints of grapefruit, caramel, and rye.  T: Lots and lots of wonderful hop flavors combined with sweet bready malts, caramel, rye. The hops is in the finish and is citrus followed by the more dominant grassy flavors.  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy and none of the stickiness that I sometimes get from Bear Republic beers.  O: Nice complexity and nice balance in the smell as well as the flavors.

610,3158,output01x,3.83,"Poured from a 12 oz. capped bottle (no date) into a pint glass.  A strong pour yields a 1 1/2-finger tan-colored head that slowly fades after a few minutes to a thin dusting and thin foam ring. The body is a clear red amber with a decent amount of slow-rising carbonation bubbles. Some good lacing can be seen clinging to the glass throughout consumption.  Grassy and citrus hops aromas combine well with sweet malt aromas. Notes of oranges, grapefruit, baked bread, and caramel give the nose good complexity as well as balance.  Sweet, bready malts start each sip with notes of caramel, toffee, whole wheat bread, and, of course, rye. This is quickly joined by a light citrus flavor and bitterness. As the beer is swallowed a decent hop bitterness comes through but slowly fades to a flavor that can only be described as buttered biscuits. A grassy bitterness then comes in as an aftertaste.  Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is a little rough in the finish but is still very enjoyable. The body is a bit on the thicker side for a beer of this style but never becomes sticky or coating. The carbonation is a little light and does not really help this beer's drinkability. A bit more carbonation would certainly go a long way here.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

More hearty earthy hop aromatics paired with a sweet and prickly rye malt sweetness with a crisp toffee sweetness at first and a drier bitter finish. Some roast, a decent amount of residual dark sugars. Great balance. No bottle date, so I don't know if the hops should be showcased more. Loads of malts in this one, and some booze.  Nice warmth on the swallow. Milky smooth with a nice brush of carb. Almost velvety. A standup beer for feel for 8%.  Kick ass beer with some heft. Not overly showy on the rye, but nicely crafted.

The rye seems light in the taste at first but ramps up and leaves plenty of spicy impact from mid-taste on. Has a fine and lasting aftertaste that features both hops and rye. This is more like an imperial rye IPA than a rye PA. The taste is earthy and spicy, with only a faint citrus component, but with a nice hint of dark fruit.  M: excellent, moderate carbonation; slight dry finish.  O: Even though the bottle was left out for about 15 minutes of warming before opening, this beer did improve a little with further warming. A fine beer no doubt, but I had a newly released Ruthless Rye IPA from Sierra Nevada last week that was fruitier and better overall, IMO.

T: Fantastic caramel sweet beginning that leads to some complex flavors: Toasted marshmallow, cashew nuts, toffee...Then to sweet coffee that grows in bitterness until strong hops are leftover at the end. Challenging. Something in there brings memories of Pliny the Elder.  M: Heavy and dense, creamy without much carbonation. Nice.  O: Very good.

Has a bitter hop aftertaste, which is also overshadowed by the malts and rye.  Feels smooth, great carbonation, not as thick as it tastes, good balance.  Overall, if a beer is called ""Hop Rod"" shouldn't it be hop forward? I feel this is definitely a more malt/rye focused, with hops thrown in for good measure.

T: I don't know quite how to describe it. It changes constantly at first it was malt leaning with a pretty intense sweetness, however as it warms the hops and rye cut down on the sweetness. My only complaint is that in the whole panoply of flavors nothing really meshes completely.  M:l I was shocked to find out that this was an 8% beer. I could have sworn it was 6-6.5 tops.

O: This is a fantastic beer. Whatever it's classified as I don't care I don't put it on the level of an IPA. It's a nice balance of malts and hops that's easy to drink.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Flounder57,4.35,"22 oz bottle was poured into a Stella glass.  Appearance: The beer poured a two finger head that has reduced to one finger and left some nice lacing on the glass. The beer is a nice mohogany amber red color with no signs of carbonation.  Smell: piney, citrus, grapefruit, caramel malts, and a little booziness towards the end.  Taste: Same as above. I get a little spiciness and orange also. Alcohol is a little more noticeable, but very good.  Mouthfeel: medium to full bodied, very smooth, boozy, low to medium carbonation. All good. I could drink this over and over.  Overall: This is another good beer from CA. I have enjoyed several of their beers over the years and this one never lets me down. Unfilitered goodness at the bottom is one of the best aspects of the beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,TonyReaves,4.52,"Bought a 4-pack on a recent trip out of state. Wish I'd bought more of this old favorite.  Pours a beautiful amber with heavy lacing.  Smells heavily piney, with some caramel notes and a rye bready smell.  Flavor starts with sweet caramel before spicy rye kicks in. Great pine and citrus flavors in the finish, with a bit of booze in the end.  Has a full mouthfeel. Can't judge the carbonation because it's in a glass with an etched bottom and my dog started begging to go outside when I poured, so it sat for a few minutes.  Overall, extremely drinkable. I tasted a little booze, but I'm surprised that it's 8 percent.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,brewsclues,4.42,"Ok, Bear Republic nailed this one. It takes a lot to get into a ""Top 10"" IPA in my book, but this one makes a strong case.  A - Dark reddish-brown with some amber highlights. Great head, eggshell-white.  S - Rich, piney-hops with plenty of grapefruit undertones. Also, I really like the peppery nose to it. Wouldn't think this would work at first, but it is a rich, complex combination.  T - Awesome. Smooth and creamy, yet with tons and tons of hops that is really easy to drink. The rye malts (pumpernickel?) and the hop balance is almost perfect. Again, refreshing and yet powerful enough to live up to the name.  M - Mild carbonation.  Overall, this beer is what ""balanced"" should be: plenty of complex characteristics going on (citrus notes, pepper, rye bread and hops galore) but none of them are out of place. I'll be looking to pick up this one again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Mostly clear, though unfiltered, the yeast was reserved in the bottle.  Smell: West coast citrusy pungent fruityness with some alcohol lofting up as well.  Taste: Nice and hoppy upfront. Peppery rye spice, paired with pine and grapefruit zest. Malt or perhaps rye grain provides a small roasted note. Ale yeast giving off fruity notes. The alcohol is hidden well behind layers of hoppy, rye influenced goodness.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied, crisp, clean and refreshing. Some hop oils are noticed.

T: piney hops, bready, sweet carmel, brown sugar, bitter, a little rye, but well balanced.  M: bitter after taste with high carbonation thats a little too much, but for the ABV, it's pretty drinkable.  Overall a solid beer from BR.

Earthy pine hop aromas paired with a sharp grapefruit element hit the nose. Unbelievably clean. Rye is prevalent within the complex spice atmosphere of this beer.  Mouthfeel: Comes across with a mellow creamy body that sits medium to full bodied on the palate but finishes with a clean, crisp refreshment that doesn't fall heavy.  Overall: A unique balance in between an IPA and a DIPA. Clearly a passion at work within this brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Sure smells of rye and piney hops. A little cocoa as well.  Tastes of dark rye bread, with a bit of charred malt and some cocoa notes and piney hops. Finishes dry and hoppy with a lingering bitterness.  Body is medium and carbonation is spritzy, a little creaminess in the mouthfeel but also some crisp carbonation makes it very refreshing to drink.  This is a delightful rye beer, very enjoyable to drink. A well balanced combination of rye malt and hops. Best rye beer I've had.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Starts off with some citrus hop character. Rounds out into a malty middle with a spicy/piney hop finish. Again well balanced flavors.  Mouthfeel and carb are good.

The smell of the beer was more hoppy than anything else I could pick up on the nose. The taste of the beer was also quite hoppy, I was hoping to pick up on some more Rye than anything else but I continue to struggle with picking up the Rye in most beers. The aftertaste is bitter and yet sweet almost all at once. The mouthfeel of this beer was pretty nice, well carbonated, stings the tongue a bit, leave a bitterness on the sides of the mouth.

610,3158,rangerred,4.28,On tap.  Appearance is a clear ruby read. There is a thick light tan head that hangs around for a long time.  I get a nutty smell from this one along with some caramel. There is a sharp piny/citrusy hop aroma.  This beer definitely hits hard with the hops. They dominate the flavor up front but there is a wonderful spicy maltiness that comes though to balance things out.  Overall this is an awesome beer and one that I would never guess is 8% abv. It is extremely balanced. Wish it was available where I live.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Tucquan,4.03,"Had this on 2011-09-09 in Pittsburgh, PA at Fat Head's (from notes)  A - Mostly-clear caramel (with a hint of red), a 1.0-finger head and good lacing.  S - Mild caramel, hop floral and spice.  T - A bit of a hop bite up front, which smooths out to a spicy, mildly sweet rye malt. Then the signficant grapefruit zest teeters on balancing with the rye sweetness until finally beating the sweetness into submission.  M - Medium body and light carbonation. A little prickly and resinous but mostly smooth. I preferred it on-tap or in the bottle to cask.  O - I always enjoy this beer and it's combination of rye spice and hops.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Noxious26,4.33,"22oz bomber poured in a pint glass.  Beige head is 1/2 inch on the pour. Recedes to a few islands and a thin ring around the edge. Dark reddish amber, almost brown and a little hazy. Lots of lacing.  Aroma is resinous and piney. Hints of citrus, caramel and a herbal medicinal quality.  Big slam of hops at the start, but it's restrained by a strong malt backbone. Piney and citrusy off the start with caramel and nuts in the background. Hops slowly overtake the malt as we approach the finish. Long lasting after taste of pine resin hop flavours.  Full bodied and a little oily. Mild carbonation and pretty smooth. Too oily to be velvety.  Very nice. Interesting juxtaposition of flavours and nicely balanced. Bravo!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,paperbackfoster,4.33,"A - An amber pour with lively, nitro-like carbonation brings up a two finger head that reduces to a clumpy head. Very sticky retention, characteristic of rye.  S - Spicy sweet. Herbal, almost medicinals, come through from the rye and the bitter hops alike. Strong grassy smell with a chili pepper astringency. Sweeter malt notes, biscuit with honey, and a slight hint of yeast.  T - Dry, spicy, woody, delicious. The rye character is deep and earthy, with the spicy pop you’d expect. The hops stand on their own in this Rye IPA, too, with a nice pungent profile and herbal finish. Malt by no means takes a backseat, coming through with a rich, toffee base. This beer has a lot going on, but it’s not too out of control.  M - Medium-high carbonation, dry, acidic. Definitely sticks around on the tongue.  Overall - I'm easy to please when it comes to rye beers, but this is still outstanding in its field. A great hop profile of an IPA, perfect balance of caramel malt base for a pale ale, rye used as a spotlight spice, and the sweet tones laced within a bitter back end make this one of the best you can ask for. This is my fallback rye, and a bit of a standard for measurement.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,jhtipton,4.5,"Wow, what took me so long to try this. Pours a nice two inch head into my chalice, brown sugar colored foam and rich dark brown body. Smell the malty richness with pine needle accents. Taste is very complex for this rich IPA. Malty carmel not any rye bread taste, thankfully, but bread like as far as the body of this beer goes. A wonderful hop sandwich with a suntan. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodies, better than a stout. Overall one of my favorite American IPA and certaijnly challenges Arrogant Bastard for best in show.

The smell here might be the highlight.  T: Bitter up front, with a very strong hoppy after. Grapefruit lingering long after the swallow. A little intimidating, but it has a nice front. If you keep drinking this it'll taste fantastic - but the aftertaste really kills.  M: Thick, very thick with tiny bubbles that hide behind the flavor. This will bite me later, for sure. But it's very creamy - very IPA.  O: This is interesting, I'll give it that. I am impressed. This is a serious IPA that deserves respect. Quite delicious.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,rickyleepotts,3,"I know, I say this every time we drink… but my travel schedule has been insane. Don’t blame me. Well, okay, blame me for the last one. We were in Florida. But we drank a LOT of beer. Didn’t write on any, but drank a ton. Anyway, we are back… for the rest of the week, anyway. Hoping to get on some sort of schedule. I might hold my breath for this one!  Let’s see if I can remember where we left off. Oh yeah, my plan for drinking. Here we go:  In the Glass: The head is thick, and sits atop the beer with authority. It seems thick from the bottle, and when the head settles it still seems thick and frothy. I like a thick head on a beer, as that means the beer itself will more than likely be thick and smooth as it goes down.  Nose: The beer smells like an IPA. I am not picking up much, if any, of the rye that they talk about. But I am sure it’s there in the mouthfeel and the aftertaste. The nose isn’t as big as I had hoped, and does not stack up to most American IPAs that I drink. The tasting notes promise for some big flavors. Let’s see!  Flavor: The beer is immediately carbonated. I don’t expect that, that’s for sure. It’s also very subtle on the tongue. It doesn’t really kick in until the beer goes down your throat and sits there on your tongue for a few minutes. The flavors at first are nearly annoying, yet come back toward the back of the palate.  Mouthfeel: I HATE the mouthfeel… initially. It’s VERY carbonated, and I hate a carbonated beer But as it settles and slides down your throat, it calms down a little bit and then settles with a great aftertaste. I just can’t get over the initial bubbles. I don’t expect that, especially with such a thick head. That sort of hurts a little!  Aftertaste: This is where the beer comes in. It nearly saves the day for the brew. The aftertaste also lingers, which I love in a beer. Especially a beer with so much bitterness. Considering how many IBUs this brew has, I expected more flavor and a more bitter aftertaste, but I’ll take it. I will take it for the time it sits there.  The beer is good, but not great. It’s just average, and for a rye I expected more. The aftertaste almost brought me back over the top, but can’t save those initial bubbles. The beer does have a big ABV, and while that is not obvious, after a few of these, and an 8% ABV, you will feel them when you stand up. With a label like that, I wanted more. Not upset, just wanted more. Either way, wherever you are tonight, bottoms up!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,tlazaroff,4.27,"A: Pours out a dark reddish brown - rust - and sports a good two-finger head of mocha colored foam. Lacing is minimal, but it's there. Looks pretty good.  S: I get this wonderfully citrusy, resiny, spiced, and piney aroma. The pine is distinct, the citrus on the other hand is hiding a lithe - maybe lemon and grapefruit? Smells like it has a great body.  T: Upfront I get the carmel, malty sweetness which is quickly taken over by the ""hop"" part of the name. The hops come across as tropical in the taste, and I didn't get that in the smell. Well done! The bitterness shows itself, but isn't assertive or over-powering. This is a beer that hop-heads will like, but is palatable for a wider audience as well.  M: Medium body and a moderately low level of carbonation bring this beer to a place I love. It just feels right, and is perfect to me. I love it.  D: 8% is quite high for me at this point, been drinking a lot of session beers. This, however, is quite palatable and easily drinkable. Great beer overall.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Same as the nose just amplified in that perfect sort of way.  M - Perfect. Not too heavy and not to light. Perfect session sort of beer.  O - I would have written a more descriptive review but Im pressed for time. Bear Republic nailed this beer in every sort of way.

610,3158,jsprain1,4.05,"A- Pours much darker than I expected. Reddish-brown with a thin head to it. S- Some of the hoppy rye ales I've had haven't worked because they work against each other instead of with each other. This was a nice combination though. I got a bit more rye on the nose, really got a fair amount of a spicy tangy quality. There's a bit of a piney hop aroma as well. T- I'm quite pleased that the hops didn't overwhelm the rye character. I muted pine flavor is definitely there but it works in tandem with the rye. Fairly well balanced. M- Sticky, low on the carbonation. Substantive body. Hides the alcohol well. O- A good effort that I enjoyed quite much. I wouldn't necessarily put it in the very upper levels of beerdom, but it is still definitely worth a try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,angrybabboon,4.3,"Consumed 10/19/11  Appearance: Pours an unexpectedly dark amber color, borderline brown - nice little beige head that sticks around - sticky lacing, above average  Smell: Relatively sweet malt base, some caramel but the rye is not that apparent - the hops shine through the interesting malt profile with a ton of citrus, some pine, and some floral notes  Taste: Unique - the rye twang is quite obvious, but it isn't excessive - it adds that characteristic bready, grainy, flavor, but there are a lot of caramel malts to balance - this malt profile is on the sweet side, but it is well-balanced by the hops - nice amount of citrus, bitterness - somewhat of an herbal, spicy component that may be from the rye, from the hops, or from an interaction of the two  Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation, medium body, smooth with a somewhat dry finish, but a little sticky  Overall: Why... Why didn't I drink this years ago?  I've had so many opportunities to try this, but I've somehow missed it time after time. Now that it is finally distributed in Rhode Island, I knew that I needed to get some. This really is a great beer. It's surprisingly balanced, with an interesting sweetness that is perfectly in the gray area between ""sweet"" and ""too sweet.""

The rye add nice character. Bitter hop finish that lingers on the palate.  M: Full bodied, robust and smooth.  D: Nicely balanced, this is a well crafted brew.

Maybe it was the light, maybe I'm not that used to ryes, but pours a shocking red/brown with a thick off-white head. Beatiful.  Smell is hop, spice, but a little bit muted. Maybe the bar environment is not the best venue for smelling.  On taste the spice, malt, and especially the hop backbone, really come out. Definitely for the hop aficianado. Duh.

S - nice fruity hop aroma at first. becomes a more earthy hop aroma later. it's a bit of a hop assault sometimes.  T - good hop flavor backed with an interesting malt/rye flavor. definitely has that hop assault character from the nose... but also has the malt/rye backbone. it's interesting. i like it, but you would have to like hops to enjoy this beer. i guess that's why it's an American IPA, right?  M - Pleasant mouthfeel. Bites a little, but settles nice and smooth and has a lingering resin presence.  O - This taste more like an Imperial IPA than an American IPA, but I like Imperial IPA's. Depending on what you were looking for, though, this might not be your perfect ""American IPA."" That might sound like a strange comment, but hey, just trying to put this beer in context. It reminds in some ways of Hop Czar from Bridgeport, but with a tastier malt/rye background. I like this beer a lot and would recommend it.

S - Good amount of grapefruit in the nose, a bit of resin and pine, some bready malt, and just a perfect amount of rye that reminds you of a very light, rye bread.  T - Starts off a bit sweet, a touch of lemon and citrus before fading into a good amount of bitter, piney hops. Again, there's a good rye bread backbone that's a bit faint but balances out the brew nicely. Another bit of sweetness on the finish.  M - Sticky mouthfeel, but overall very smooth.

610,3158,zac16125,4.15,"Hop Rod Rye 22 oz bottle poured into a mug No born on date or other distinguishing numbers  A: Pours out a very dark amber, almost brown, with reddish hues when held up to the light. 2 fingers of very light khaki almost white head, with good retention. Leaves a good amount of heady lacing. Probably the darkest standard IPA I’ve had, but a very pretty beer when held next to light.  S: Big citrus hop aroma; tangerine, grapefruit, and lemon zest. A significant sweetness on the nose as well, with caramel malt and a ripe fruit/ fruit sugar sweetness. A touch of alcohol as well. Very, very nice.  T: The taste is similar to the nose, with a balance of hop bitterness and malt sweetness. At first the malt presence was a little too much for my liking. There was a big caramel malt sweetness up front, followed by a hop bitterness on the backend. But as I drank it, the sweet malts subdued and hops started to dominate, in a good way. The whole spectrum of hop flavors came out, citrus up front (orange and grapefruit were prominent) followed by piney hops characters to finish off each sip. A very tasty beer.  M/D: Perfect amount of carbonation that gives it a lively mouthfeel but doesn’t distract from the flavors. Medium bodied with a moderately good drinkability, I could and would have more than one but the heavy malt presence would probably keep me from drinking them all night.  O: Overall a very good IPA. The great aroma stands out particularly. American IPAs are one of my favorite styles, and although this isn’t the best one I’ve had (my top 2 being Sculpin and Stone) it is very good in its own right and certainly worth a try.

The nose has notes of deep, bready malts; peppery rye; and floral, citrusy hop aromas. The taste is deep, rich bready, biscuity, barley malts with some rye undertones. There's a great hop character that is balanced and adds floral, spicy, piny notes. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, and perfectly carbonated.  This is great.

The nose is most notably sugary, but the hops and the grains come through as well. I haven’t had many ryes, so I am still figuring them out. I do feel a difference in the body. For an 8% beer, it seems like this beer should be much heavier; somehow the rye has a less oppressive presence than a heavy malt version. The beer is very caramely, but then bitter hops to follow to round this one out. I cannot get over the clean feeling this beer has in the aftertaste.

Hints of black cherry and raisin as well add to this really big malt that battles with, but complements this well-hopped brew. Spiciness and more bittering pine hops finish this one out with some rye shining through late and more as it warms. Really thick, substantial, yet drying mouthfeel.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BBP,4.2,"A- Aside from the chunks of sediment in this, it looked absolutely gorgeous. The sediment was one of the worst I've seen yet. I enjoy the look of a hazy unfiltered beer, but this was just chunky and gross. I had to run it through a french press mug before I could consume it. It now looks like the Duvel of IPAs. I'd give it a 5 if it looked like this to begin with.  S- Very enticing. Initially it's grapefruit and pine, but it settles into a pine/rye mix. It fades a lot over time though. When I popped the bottle open I got a little giddy, but near the end it was hard to smell at all.  T- Hop forward, but led by the malt. The very first thing you taste is the hops, but then the malt takes hold. Shortly after some pine can be grasped again. Caramel malt plays a big part in this minus the expected caramel sweetness.  The finish is sharpened in the later half of the drink as the flavor embeds itself onto you.  M- Medium full body. Carbonation is very unintrusive. The finish is fairly dry and sticky.  O- The perfect blend to encourage easy drinkability. Alcohol seems like it should be there but isn't.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,BarryMFBurton,4.62,"Bear Republic’s Racer 5 was pretty tasty, but this is the bottle that has excited me the most. Thanks for the trade, tripelhops; I have a feeling this one’s going to be epic.  A: This one starts out sexy, pouring a luscious ruby red. On top is two-finger white cream, leaving awesome lacing as it falls. The color mix gives a sensation of red velvet cake: a mouth-watering crimson and cream allure.  S: Incredible! The malts are so damn sweet, a dark testament to plum, raisin, black cherry, apricot, and caramel apple; it’s a complex sugar buzz, and deeply satisfying. There’s a great balance of crisp pumpernickel from the rye and a slight smokiness, too, but they can’t help but play second fiddle to the juicy sweets. This nose can only be described as umami – savory as hell!  T: Sweet and fruity on the front of the tongue, with a sour kick, even. I love it. It’s mostly raisin and dark caramel, strung together by a yeasty thickness. Hops are big and bitter, and they pop in just in time to keep the palate from getting too malty (showing near-perfect balance). Afterwards, the rye comes in; and it’s so deliciously evident. Smoky, bready, and spicy, it delights the palate with a wonderfully forward earthiness. The last tastes are akin to a brown ale: nutmeg, caramel malts, hazelnut cream, and coffee. They overwhelm the aftertaste, which has a resiny hop hint, a small bit of grains, and an alcoholic bite on the side. Wow – in the short time I’ve been drinking it, this has become one of my absolute favorite beers.  M: Smooth, rich, and perfect for the palate. The alcohol’s warmth mixed with the slight fizz makes this even more interesting, too. In all, though, it’s just insanely drinkable!  O: What a ride! I would have never guessed that this beer would have fit my exact taste profile so perfectly, but it most certainly did. Hoppy yet sweet, roasty yet fruity; this really should be a more powerful force in the beer world. Hop Rod Rye is destined to go down as one of my “desert island beers,” and that is not something I take lightly.

610,3158,Tballz420,4.33,"Hop Rod Rye is a deep brown into black colored brew, which shines a deep amber color when held to the light. There is a lot of microscopic sediment floating throughout, so it must be bottle conditioned. Topping the beer is a small, bubbly tan head. Lots of lacing.  The nose has a whole lot of hops in it, a bit of alcohol (Hop Rod Rye is 8.00% ABV), with some rye and other sweet malts.  The taste starts with a lot of sweet caramel malt, and a lot of rye grains, some brown sugar, into some nice hops, probably some Zeus hops along with the more common west coast varieties. Nice citrus, grapefruit, floral and bittering elements. Medium bodied and wet.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

This beer is beautiful to watch as rivulets of lacing cascade down after each sip. Caramel aroma with citrus hops. Very well balanced malt profile hides the 8% alcohol nicely with fantastic pine/citrus hop blend. Really like the way this dances lightly on the front of the tongue but finished off rather thick. Overall I'm a big fan of this beer and Bear Republic. At 8%, I'm not sure why this isn't considered an Imperial IPA. Maybe the most impressive aspect of this beer is the price - a world class Imperial IPA at $4.99 a bomber!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Humulus85,4.33,"Thanks to tjkinate for this one...  Poured from a 22oz bottle into my trusty nonic. Produced a very, very nice, cream head that bubbled up slowly, from deep in the brew, much like a Guinness. It left great sticky sip rings all the way down the glass. Deep, auburn color, with some bright ruby tones when held to a light. Very nice.  Smell is strong, yet sweet, with some raisins and bread. Behind it though is an intriguing sting to the nostrils, that I suspect is from the rye.  This is a very good, but slightly perplexing brew. Strong piney hops hit you up front, but immediately yield to nice sweet malt, with faint chocolate and cocoa notes. Then this boozy sting hits, but it's the tastiest boozy sting I've had in a beer. It tastes like someone threw in a shot of bourbon right before I drank it. Very nice.  Heavy but smooth, with a moderate amount of carbonation. Smooth and drinkable, but still heavy. The booze warms the belly halfway through the pint, but on this cold Saturday, that's not a bad thing.  Overall this is a very good and intriguing beer. To me it tastes like a good American Strong Ale with a shot of bourbon thrown in for good measure. While I can't say I'll drink on a regular basis, I will recommend it to any one looking to try a different tasting strong ale, or any fan of rye beers.

Taste is all that, a little subdued, but good. Easy drinking for it's abv, wish I new the age of this beer. I think it may be on the older side, for a hop head like myself.

The head is a light tan that pours about a fingernail and dissipates slowly to there was just a light coating on the top. The lacing clings to the glass pretty well.  T & M: really interesting taste and very big and intense tasting. Piney hops and sweet malts at first but, finishes smoky, bready rye-ness, and hints of fruit (maybe grapefruit). The rye bitterness is very prevalent in the finish. Very smooth, creamy, rich beer. About a 6 out of 10 for body and medium carbonation. Beer is super filling, not very easy to drink.

From a hard pour, into a standard pint glass, comes a thick one finger head with decent retention and lots of frothy lacing.  S: Very hoppy, lots of pine with sweet malty undertones.  T: Less hoppy than the smell led me to believe, the beer is quite smooth and sweet. As the sips continue the hops become more prominent and build on one another. Even with the elevated bitterness the beer remains smooth and highly drinkable.  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, coats mouth nicely.

There's a very pleasing aroma of citrus hops and rye. Very good flavor! Bitter throughout, but never too strong. I'd describe the hops as having citrus and pine characteristics. Rye is tasted and gives a good kick. Despite the higher ABV, there is any taste of alcohol. It goes down very easily without much coating. What is left behind has some rye spiciness that I like.

Some raisin and dark fruits underneath.  T- I was surprised by spiciness, and at only fifteen percent rye. I'm sure some is from the hops, there's obviously a lot, but not at all overly bitter. Surprisingly clean finish with only a slight lingering bitterness. Well balanced for having so many strong flavors.  M- Full and slightly dry with prickly carbonation. Unfortunately I didn't get the massage, but pleasant none the less ;)  O- A unique brew, definitely glad to have the experience.

S: Hmm...I get lots of bready malt but there is also a lot of spices, pine, and sharp pungent hops. A hint of malt sweetness as well...and maybe a touch of alcohol.  T: Starts off with blood orange, grapefruit, and pine; middle of the tongue it transitions into the rye and bready malts, and then your palette seems to shift gears as the beer (with a lighter body than I expected) glides effortlessly away and all you're left with is pungent, spicy dryness.  MF: Near perfect for an IPA; light body, wet feel, just enough carbonation, and good finishing dryness.  O: Really impressed, this is a well crafted beer that does a ton of stuff right.

610,3158,Pintofbrown,4.48,"Appearance: Oh man… I must hurry through this to taste it, the way this thing looks already has me way too excited. On the pour, the foam frothed, stormed, danced, and swelled to three fingers of creamy head that is a nice off-white color.  There is considerable lacing clinging with all its strength to the side of the glass as the head slowly descends. It’s down to about a finger now.  The body is deep amber with pumpkin skin highlights. It is easy to see the sediment from the hops used in the beer floating lazily among the strong pillars of carbonation zooming to the top.  Smell: This Hop Rod's tank is full on the little green cone essence. The bright citrusy twang is evident before my nose is even over the glass. Plenty of grapefruit, orange, and some lemon zest permeating from the glass. What really makes this baby rev is the sugary hints right behind the hops, it makes this beer smell smooth. How feel is accomplished in smell is beyond me, but the sugariness is a wonderful touch.  Taste: Incredibly rich flavors accompany the hop zing that explodes around the tongue. The rye for instance, is strong in the front of the drink that smoothes it out as the grapefruit and orange hops are kicking around. The malts are oh so subtle too, just a little of the caramel malt backs up the rye as the drink starts to finish.  And does this thing finish. It is long and deliberate. It feels like the hops are actually gaining strength slowly after the swallow. It is bitter and it is dry, but as someone that wanted a strong IPA, this is perfect.  Mouth feel: The dry finish crashes with the smoothness of the drink, creamy and definitely medium bodied. It just feels good man.  Overall: American IPA? Maybe American DIPA. The higher alcohol content and extreme dose of hops in the bottle make the case for this in a big way. Oh, and it is absolutely delicious.  Two Hearted was my favorite IPA, until I cracked this one open. The extreme hops and subtle feel of the rye and the caramel malt notes really push this one into a category all its own.  Find a way to try this beer if you love IPA’s.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,liamt07,4.25,"Bottle shared with Steve, 650ml into two tulips.  Pours a deep red, with some nice mahogany hues. An offwhite head of a couple fingers forms, leaving some nice lacing and moderate retention. Nose holds rye, tropical fruits and some grapefruit. A beautiful malt profile, holding rich caramel, rye bread and graham cracker notes. Taste has again some nice rye and caramel character, bitter grapefruit and orange again. Strong lingering bitterness. Good full mouthfeel, light to moderate alcohol notes and exceptional drinkability, a sort of IPA+ due to the ABV. Quite excellent and I can only imagine this being divine on tap, as I believe freshness may have detracted from the fulll experience here.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Bendurgin,3.23,Thanks for the brew Randy. Poured into a pint glass. This one pours a dark brown with a thin layer of white foam.  Lots of rye in aroma with a little bit of candied orange. I would immagine that is from the hops but it seems a bit weak. A little bit of caramel in the aroma. The rye is really the best part of this. The flavor is a lot like the aroma. Good rye flavors but not enough on the hops for me. Candied orange and a little bit of caramel.  The feel is a little sticky with decent carbonation. A little heavier than I would like. Overall not to bad here. Nothing really exciting. The rye is good but the other flavors are simply underwhelming.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,titosupertramp,4.05,"A: Deep amber with red highlights when held to light. Two fingers of slightly off white head. Leaves behind a lot of lacing and a nice looking film with large bubbles around the edges. This would get a 4.5, but it has tons of floaties. If I had been aware of them, I would have been more careful in the pour. Next go round, if I'm able to avoid them, I'll rescore.  S: Big orange citrusy hops and caramel malts. The smell is soft and sweet, but pretty potent at the same time.  T: Like the smell, not overly complex, but very enjoyable. Mainly orange is what I get out of the hops, sweet caramel from the malts. A very nice balance between the two as one doesn't over power the other. Has a nice spicy character from the rye.  M: Full and creamy, almost chewy. Leaves a sticky coating.  O: Good beer although I was surprised to see this in the IPA category. I would have pegged this as a hopped up red ale. At any rate, this is a very tasty beer that I'd be happy to drink again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,fastd03,4.03,"This is an exceptionally hoppy beer. I have yet to try any other bear republic beers, but this is certainly a good start. Strong and hoppy, it fits the standards I set for a beer well, and has an attractive dark color. I have had smoother beers, but overall it goes down relatively smooth with a hint of carbonation (but not so much as to make my stomach bubble). I have had better beers, but this is certainly fairly high on my list.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Raven3464,4.35,"Appearance: The beer pours a very dark amber color, almost brown, with a creamy head. There is very little carbonation.  Smell: Citrus (maybe grapefruit) dominates early followed by a sweet pine aroma.  Taste: This beer tastes much better than it smells. It's both bitter and sweet due to the ridiculous west coast hop injection. There is a sourness upfront which fades into hints of citrus and spicy rye. This ultimately develops into a pine taste. The aftertaste is extremely bitter.  Mouth feel: Very dry and spicy with the right amount of carbonation.  Overall: A very good west coast style hop bomb. Take a very good IPA, add some rye and more hops to make it super bitter; you'll get this masterpiece.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

T-Wow...very smooth and tasty, very dry and fruity nice malts and a tad of spice, well balanced and refreshing...I think the rye does wonders here...

610,3158,cbarrett4,4.38,"This was a stunning surprise. Pours with a deep red/brown hue, good foam and excellent retention, nice lace.  Smells of IPA: pine, citrus, malts, and a little spice. The flavors are nice with pine and citrus up front, framed by the rye and lightly roasted malt. Very complex palate. Texture is nicely balanced with alcohol, bitterness, acids, all in sync.  Definitely a big boy, but not over the top as some IPAs can be. The rye adds a lot. I couldn't pound these one after another, but it is nice to sip and enjoy one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,iDrinknewglarus,4.41,"A: Really dark ruby red mixed with brown... let's just call it burgundy. Lots of particles in suspension. Tan head that laces like few beers can. My glass is a lacy mess. Absolutely gorgeous.  S: Immediate west coast hops. Smells like cascade: grapefruit, orange, lemon citrus fruits. Pretty large malt backbone to boot. Smells bready and slightly spicy (like rye bread go figure). Very inviting.  T: Tastes even better than it smells. It is really well balanced. Both bitter and sweet from the truckloads of malt and hops used. It tastes malty and sweet all the way through, then you swallow and then comes the hop bite and the dryness of the alcohol to persuade you to take another sip. The rye is a very nice touch that brings a light spiciness to the palate. A nice change in pace from your standard IPA. Alcohol is nowhere is sight. Probably the most complex malt I've ever tasted in an IPA.  M: Heavy mouthfeel with light carbonation. Feels sticky and nourishing. I've had lighter imperial stouts to say the least.  Damn, this beer hit the spot. Flawless execution of a rye IPA. I was at first skeptical of the high ratings of this beer, but this brew sure can back it up. Highly worth checking out.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

HRR has a smell filled with rye, bread, some mango or other fruit too. Taking a sip from my pint glass and I am hit with some malts and hops, first off. From there, there is a sweetness from citrus and maybe some caramel. More malt and some bitterness also hits the palate. MF is med-heavy.

Plenty of hops, a little rye spiciness, and unless I'm mistaken a slightly meaty aroma.  T. Superbly spicy and bitter, but with a background sweetness that cuts through the hops and the rye. Fantastic bitter finish.  M. Full bodied, dry.  O. Whoever built this beer knew what they were doing. Comparing to style guidelines it's up there with the best. On a personal level it's absolutely one of my favourites.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Sweet malt with a touch of spicy rye, light toffee and floral hops. It’s okay but lacking something.  Medium body with moderate carbonation. Fine.  A decent beer but I’m not digging it. It lacks depth and clarity. The hops and the malt create something a bit muddy. Prefer it in the bottle.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,BierFan,4.28,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Big light tan head sprung up from a dark body. This beer is so dark it could pass as a porter. Lacing coats the sides of the glass. Head still persists after several minutes. Hops and rye in the smell. Smells maltier than most Cali IPA's. Creamy mouthfeel. Taste is similar to a porter, but of course with rye and hops.  It's been a while since I've been this impressed with a beer. Very good stuff.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ehammond1,4.15,"Bottle (2011)  Holiday Wine Cellar Escondido, CA  Dark ruby--a gorgeous color. Thick, persistent khaki head and gobs of lacing down the glass.  A pungently hoppy, slightly spicy, and sweet aroma. This nose really touches all the bases--it's quite extraordinary. There's grapefruit rind, rye spiciness, sweet baking bread, some dark fruit--it's unique and powerfully pungent.  Sweet fruits, molasses, grapefruit/citrus hops, and bitterness round out the flavor. It's varied and complex, getting better and better as the beer warms to room temperature.  The mouthfeel is just a touch too syrupy, though it doesn't detract much at all from the enjoyment of the beer.  A great beer, and one of my first loves.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,jondeelee,4.92,"Hop Rod Rye begins with the kind of aroma that makes you want more: deep sugars, redolent with sweet fruit and berry notes (orange, peach, berry, white grape); lightly toasted grains; and just a hint of freshly-baked rye bread.  On the tongue, the first flavors are confectioner's sugar sweet, and last for a mere fraction of a second before the rye kicks in, flooding the mouth with delicious bitterness. Whether due to the rye or the hops, a substantial part of this bitterness is grapefruit-rind tart, and dominates the mouthful from there on out, including lasting well into the aftertaste. Significant malt flavors are also present, cranked up to eleven to keep up with the rye/hops. Flavors here include the fruits from the nose, as well as caramelized brown sugars and Grape Nuts cereal-like toasted grains. The aftertaste is almost exclusively hops and rye. Mouthfeel is a silky-smooth medium, and carbonation is medium to medium-high.  Overall, this is a fantastic beer, and has been made by someone who truly appreciates the craft of craft brewing. It's not a beer for everyone, though, as evidenced by, if nothing else, the fact that the liquid is so bitter and tart--75+ IBUs, and that doesn't include the effects of the rye--that when left in the mouth for several seconds (as it is when, for instance, the drinker is writing a review of it) the tongue numbs and tingles. But enthusiasts who don't mind a good bit of bitterness should give this one a try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

T- Everything I look for in an DIPA. Bright bitterness, floral tastes, rye spice, sweet malt, carmel undertones.  M- Similar to a brown or amber ale. Silky smooth.  O- Brilliant marriage of hop bitterness, malt sweetness, and rye spice. All the mouthfeel, color, and sweetness of a brown ale; with a bright hop flavor.

Looking at this, my initial thought would not be an IPA but an Amber.  S: Citrus at first but then the rye comes along with a bit of caramel malt.  T: Hop kick on the first sip but then you get a rye spiciness, and a bit of caramel to finish. Awesome.  M: Thick and heavy on he tongue. Very good carbonation.  O: Absolutely awesome.

T: Flavors up front are intense with notes of grapefruit and pine, along with some fruity notes. Caramel, toast, and rye are present in the middle, leading the way for a dry, bittering hop finish.  Notes: Complex, yet very well-balanced, this brew has got it all. Medium to full-bodied, and has a mouthfeel and finish that lasts forever. It's awesome stuff!

610,3158,WastingFreetime,3.66,"Pours from my bomber a semi-opaque dark brown that shifts into mahogany amber highlights when held closer to a light source. Very bubbly light tan colored head rises up to two fingers when poured aggressively, but dies down rapidly, albeit with some quite impressive lacing. The body is on the thicker side of medium heft, and carbonation is spot-on. Upon opening the bomber, I am greeted by the aroma of intense grapefruit peel and pine resin over the top of a strongly spicey rye malt with a subtle smokey earth tone accentuated by mild peppery hop tones in the background. So at first, everything is amazing. However, five minutes later, all of the juicy citric hop aroma has evaporated (not hop flavor, the hop aroma) and all I am left with is the rye malt smell and earth tones. I find myself disappointed in the lack of sturdiness of the citric aroma elements, something that really hurts the balance of this beer's nose. Tastes of heavy hearty rye pumpernickel bread at first, joined up by the bittering wave of a standard hop bomb of boiled pine sap and grapefruit pith. I've not had a beer like this in quite some time which wears its ""Rye-ness"" on it's sleeve so proudly. I would even call it -educational- for providing an easily identifiable textbook example of what Rye malt should taste like. Spicey, earthy goodness all around with a heavy wallop of bittering. I'm OK with this.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

T - Bitterness from the hops was offset perfectly by a balance of spiciness from the Rye and sweetness from the malt. It was crisscrossing my tongue left and right (or was it right and left?), but somehow I didn't mind. An unapologetic hop bomb, the balance still made for a great beer.  M - Thickness from the malt and creaminess in general. Delicious.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

A finger or so of clinging head.  S- A very interesting smelling IPA. Some pine-y hops, a little rye, a little sweetness, and a bit of a bite from the 8%. The pine and alcohol come out more as it opens up.  T- Underwhelming, to be quite honest. Very bitter, but not a ton of flavor in the hops, just the bitter bite. Some sweetish, rye and pine on the finish. I have to say I expected more.  M- A little light and watery. Not awful, but not a selling point.  O- A very unique IPA that is hard to pin down.

Smells like spicy rye, malt, piney hops, and lemon. Taste is a bready rye with some lemon, finishing moderately bitter. I don't know if the hops are supposed to be this restrained, or if this is just an older bottle. In any case, I was expecting more hop presence. Mouthfeel is creamy, with a medium-full body and medium carbonation.

It's quite dark. I guess I think it's an IPA, but it doesn't look like an IPA.  Smell - Strong hops of pine and citrus, but quite a bit of caramel malt as well. It's interesting that both flavors manage to come out quite strongly. Behind the front flavors is a biscuit and toast malt aroma.  Taste - Hops, of course. Citrus hops, but the pine hops are accentuated by the rye spice, so it doesn't taste quite as fruity. There is a hint of sweetness that is balanced nicely by the rye as well. It's an interesting addition. The bitter finish also complements the toastiness.  Mouthfeel - Feels like a DIPA, but apparently it isn't. Nice and thick. All the flavors linger.

Lacing is very nice, but overall an odd color for this style, seemingly attributed to the rye it is made with.  S - Some grapefruit and citrus flavors, but yet, there is a substantial backbone of rye and amber malt, maybe with some roasted malt in there as well. Almost smells like a black IPA, but with slightly less roastiness  T - Immense hop character and bitterness all over this one. There is some rye, but this is really an IPA first, and a west coast one at that. Lots of refreshing citrus and hop characters up front, followed by great hop bitterness with some of the rye adding to the finish of bitterness as well.  M - Oddly refreshing for such a dark colored beer. A very nice addition to an IPA. Carbonation and alcohol are both appropriate.

610,3158,jibbyvonjibb,4,"The color is a hazy brown, with particles swirling around, allowing little light to go through. The ivory head has tiny bubbles, like vanilla mousse.  The smell is distinctly caramelly with sweet fruit flavors coming through like apples and raisins. The citrus hops complement these flavors. I think I even sense some rye in the background, which I associate with the harsh graininess of buckwheat.  The sweet caramel malty fruitiness in the aroma made me suspect that the malts would also dominate the flavor, and this indeed is the case. The same sweet fruits win out here, but there is definitely plenty of hops to balance, at least in the hoppy finish which lingers. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and I can detect a unique raw-grain texture in the back of my tongue which I can only presume to be the rye. Other than this sensation, however, I cannot associate any other flavor specifically with the grain that prominently featured on the label.  It's a good beer - flavorful and fairly drinkable. I do have to warn you that this is on the malty side of IPA's (I guess 1.020), and many, including me, prefer to stay on the dry side of the spectrum. It just makes things more drinkable and refreshing.

A - Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a very deep, muddy looking red color with a good fluffy two finger off-white head. Very cloudy and darker than expected. Leaves good lacing down the sides.  S - Big caramel and dark fruity notes. The spiciness of the rye is present as well as that big west coast hoppiness. Grapefruit and slight pine is there from the hops.  T - Quite complex. Caramel, figs, cherries, pepper. Toward the end, the hops really come through nicely to balance out the big caramel sweetness. Leaves a lingering mild sweetness balanced by a grapefruity bitterness.  M - Mouthfeel is excellent. Nice and creamy with pretty low carbonation. Fits this one well.  O - Overall, I was really looking forward to this one and I wasn't disappointed. However, I just based my ranking on how much I enjoyed it, not to the style because I believe it has been wrongly categorized. This is at least a DIPA, and you could make the case that it should be a barleywine. I found it to be VERY similar to Terrapin's Rye Squared.

A: Really nice looking crystal clear deep amber color. Aggressive pour leads to a monumental 3 finger head that stuck around most of the drink. Lacing filled out the glass and stuck throughout as well. Really beautiful beer, one of the prettiest I've seen. Add that to a beautiful glass and it's quite the combo.  S: Full of hops. Citrusy hops to be exact followed very closely by rye and then the malty backbone solidifies this beer as a great one. The age probably stole some of the potency here but it was still really nice.  T: Wonderful hop-forward beer that punches you first with grapefruit hops, then follows closely with the spice of the rye. Then comes the sweetness and then again with the rye! It's an interesting back and forth of rye and malt and hop again.  M: Medium body, thick, sweet mouth coating. Spicy notes and the 8% ABV create a nice warm feeling that lasts for quite a while.  O: A delicious IPA with rye notes. I'm not a huge fan of rye beers and I know that this is technically not a rye, rather an IPA but it has wonderful rye spice that adds to the delicious IPA that lies underneath.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,MoustacheHero,4.05,"A bottled offering from the Bear Republic Brewery.  A: A warm amber colour with a white, bubbly head that holds its own. On an appearance side note, quite a dated looking label, kind of found it tacky.  S: Sweet, caramel smell with spicy rye notes and hoppy kick.  T: Great amber flavor mixed with hoppy notes throughout, made complex with rye spice.  M: An surprisingly bubbly beer with medium body. Creamy going in and washes clean.  O: A wonderful beer to explore the influences of rye. Definitely a keeper.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,katybee,4.18,"MMMM....yummy! An exceedingly bitter beer at first taste, balanced by smooth body and carmellized sweetness of the malts. It poured clear, cola golden brown with a 1/2"" creamy head which rimmed my glass with a persistent lacing. Very nice. Initially bitter on the tongue, the presence of rye definitely detectable in flavor, complimented by some strong flowery hopping. But very dry; no residual off-tastes, just a little peppery spiciness on the tongue. MMM! And a smooth soft creamy body that makes you want to let the bitter liquid linger a bit longer on your tastebuds, at which point the slight sense of carmelized malts hits you. Then surprise surprise, as the beer in your glass warms up, you notice some sedimenttion falling through the brew. Yeasts? Malts? An interesting authenticity.  Overall, very enjoyable and easy to sip throughout an evening, with the unique scent of rye replacing what would be hops in any other ale. Thinner than a stout, without any sense of ""soy-maltiness"" or ""guinness dryness"" this is a gorgeous brown ale. Try it! My only complaint was that the label didn't quite do the beer justice; they should rework it. lol.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,MrVonzipper,4.32,"Poured a dark mirky brown with a bubbly light tab head with low little retention and light lacing.  Very nice nose with nice malt character, leathery-like hop notes (which made sense to me at the time) and mild pine.  Well balanced flavor. Mild caramel malt with sweet candy-like fruit balanced with a subtle floral-piney hop character on the back end. 8% abv blended well enough to know that kick is there but not overwhelming at all. Rye flavor comes through just a touch in the aftertaste with the lingering mild floral hops.  Full bodied with good carbonation and a touch of tackiness.  Overall a real good beer. I think this might be my first rye style, who knows I've forgotten more beers that I've had than many people Have had. If it isn't, it's definitely the best rye I've had.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,woodychandler,4.85,"My local trader, tone77, and I did another pick-up/drop-off the other day and this time our roles were reversed - I dropped off while he was at work. More bottles for me to keep the numbers aligned with The CANQuest (TM). So be it!  From the bottle: ""Hop Rod Rye is a high performance, turbo charged, alcohol burnin' monster ale with dual overhead hop injection, made with 18% rye.""; ""Brew Master Notes - Don;t drink & drag. Sediment at bottlom of bottle may be the result of the truckload of hops in this non-filtered ale.""  I do not understand how I have never reviewed this beer until now. I even visited them with UncleJedI and PurpleHatJoan and they sent me a patch for the latest jacket. It is time to make this right!  My slow, gentle pour still got me a finger of light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity, thanks to my pour. I will stir up the lees at the end to see what I get. Nose was grapefruit and black pepper, owing to both the copious hops and all of the rye. Man, but the mouthfeel was full, with a spicy intensity that makes me want to remind you to be sitting down when drinking this beer! That was a Public Service Announcement, courtesy of yours truly. Stone likes to think that we are ""not worthy"", but even as a self-avowed hophead, I may not be worthy of this one. It just exploded in my mouth with citrus and black pepper and swallowing did not help, since it was so dry that I immediately gasped and reached for the water. Oh my! To say that this was good would be an understatement. Put another way - it may not be for everyone, but if you like American IPAs and you appreciate what rye can do for a beer, you should try this beer, if you haven't already.

610,3158,spicelab,4.47,"Bomber with thanks to Adam@Platinum Liquor  Deep mahogany with a dense light beige head which leaves a very sticky one-finger lace ring after it recedes. Pretty solid.  Pineapple, tangerine and cherries bombard at first. Lemon sherbet and a pretty intense floral character ramp up the sweetness. Prunes, raisins, liquorice and more generic caramel malts round things off beautifully. How good is this?  Rich pine gorgeously tempered by earthy rye, which additionally knocks the edge off the sherbet sweetness. Plenty of lemon rind, grapefruit and bitter orange. Restrained biscuity malt presence allows the hops to really shine.  Spot on carbonation, with a totally unobtrusive medium mouthfeel and moderate lingering mid-palate bitterness.  Very satisfying and clever brew. The rye provides just enough spunk without detracting from the hop profile, which is magnificent in its own right.

610,3158,OttoBomb,4.21,"Poured from a 12 oz (355m l) bottle into a Dogfish Head signature glass (June 23, 2010). No freshness dates that I can find.  Eyes: Pours a an expectedly ruddy darkish orange, the rye is visible immediately in terms of color, thick haze and a dirty foam cap. Strong retention and lacing.  Nose: A abundance of citrusy hops, with an undertone of the dry rye malt.  Tongue: Similar to the nose, a very hop forward palate is paired with the much lighter dry rye and malt dimensions. The rye supplies a nice dry component that actually pairs well with the massive hop punch.  Mouth: Almost a DIPA level tongue scorcher for what is considered an IPA. Very dry aftertaste with a bitter finish.  Libation: 8% ABV might be enough to push this into DIPA range, but this is quite drinkable. One of the very first rye IPAs to become distributed, and is stil one of the very best.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,StoutHunter,4.12,"I picked up a bottle of Hop Rod Rye last week for $2.00 at The Lager Mill. I have never tried anything from Bear Republic before and since I heard that they recently started distributing in Michigan I have been wanting to try some of their brews, so when I saw three different bottles from them at the store I knew I had to at least give one a try so I chose the one that visually appealed the most to me and hoped for the best. No visible bottling date. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  A- I like the label a lot, the old school hot rod gives this beer a pretty cool look, and that was the deciding factor on what one to get since I liked both the styles they had equally. It poured a nice looking dark and bold amber color with two and a half fingers worth of off white head.  S- The first thing I picked up in the aroma was lot of hops, it seemed to be mostly citrus but there was also some pine aromas thrown in there. There are some nice grapefruit, tangerine, mango, and pineapple aromas that mixed in with some nice lightly toasted caramel malts and a slight bit of spicey rye.. There was a small presence of booze, it seemed like the citrus hops were the dominating force in the aroma  T- The flavor mirrors the aroma nicely. The hops are the main player here and mainly consist of citrus hops with the pine taking a back seat to all those great citrus flavors like, grapefruit, tangerines, mangos, and pineapples. The rye and caramel malts come together nicely and combine to make a very nice base for this beer and it imparts enough flavor that the hops don't completely take over this brew. The finish has a medium light bitterness to it that worked well with this brew and there was hardly any presence of alcohol.  M- Smooth and medium full bodied, a little thicker then most IPA's, it could be toned down just a touch. There was medium amount of carbonation that suited this beer.  Overall I thought this was a pretty good, balanced and complex IPA. This brew was heavy on the citrus hops but the excellent caramel malt and spicy rye base of this beer helped balance out all those hops ans made for a pretty complex brew. I liked the aroma the most with the flavor just falling a little short and it had really good drinkability for an IPA, I could for sure go for another one if I had one. I could see buying a six pack of this when I am in the mood for IPA, the balance and complexity were awesome. I recommend this beer to anyone who likes IPA's, it's doesn't hit you over the head with hops, but it wins you over with its balance and complexity. This beer made for a good first impression of Bear Republic and I am looking forward to trying some of their other brews.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,JTSbeerislife,4.35,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a British Imperial Pint “no nick” glass. No date on case or bottle but my reliable distributer stated that this case was just shipped to them a week or so ago.  Poured aggressively forms a nice two finger head, which dissipates a into 1/8” cap. Easily revived with a little swirling, this beer is alive. Dark brownish amber color. Decent lacing adds to the overall attractive look of this Ale.  The first smell is one of spicy hops, a dark bread aroma, medium intensity (not overly powerful), followed by some nice yeast. A very, very pleasant aroma that could be great with a little more intensity.  Very crisp, medium bodied entry into the mouth, distinct spicy hops but you definitely notice the malt/Rye/roasted grain in the middle, the Rye could be stronger but it is present. Quite delicious really, to the point that this is a good choice for a “house beer” (you know, the one you grab after work, but still pay attention to what you are drinking)  Very long, rather dry finish of bitter hops, faint malt and a surprisingly distinct Rye quality. An excellent finish and probably the most attractive component of this Ale.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the dryness of this Ale. IMO so many beers are becoming more and more sweet, especially if they have a high ABV. I have not been overly impressed with the offerings from the Bear Republic Brewing Co., but I have to say this is a very good brew. I would definitely by another case. This is one of the few beers that I find more flavorful on the colder side, that being said I drank this at between 50-55 degrees.

610,3158,tdexterc,4.75,"i've been a long time reader of the site but this is my first review. many more to come!  A- A smooth pour yields a nice 1 finger head and a deep ruby/amber tone.  S- Hop Heaven! a wonderful assortment of piney and citric notes are upfront, followed by a sweet, but faint, caramel.  T- There is a sweet, almost sticky malt which shows through, followed by the slightly spicy rye. The hops are abound in this one but not overwhelming. All of this mingles with a smooth but growing bitterness and a very subtle and slightly warming alcohol presence.  M- One of the smoothest beers i have had the pleasure of drinking in quite some time. The carbonation is supremely matched to the tastes in this brew. A very difficult and rarely achieved balance between hop bitterness and sweet malts has been met perfectly in this brew.  Overall, I was wildly pleased with this beer. I LOVE hops, and this one definitely didn't disappoint. Had i not have known that this was an 8% beer going into it, i would have never guessed anything near that.

T- Big hop profile, similar to the nose with lots of pine and citrus. Rye malt is spicy but with some thick sweetness to it that hangs out in the background, it tries its best to compete with the hops, but isn't really up to it. Finish is dry with lingering bitterness from the hops and just a hint of caramel malt sweetness.

610,3158,rawfish,4.26,"Pours a hazy Brazillian cherry wood color with flashes of crimson in the light and small particles of sediment from the yeast. Off white thigh head tops out at and inch with undying retention and nicely webbed lacing.  Dark caramel malts with a slight roasted note and a light fruits, apples and pears from the yeast. Hops come through with pine and low amounts of grapefruit. Yeast adds an earthy tone.  Sticky malts with a touch of grain and caramel start out the front paving the way for pine, grapefruit pith and peel hop character that starts lightly bitter but intensifies in both bitterness and grapefruit flavor towards the end of the drink. A bit spicy and peppery in the middle of the drink and ends very dry, the rye really does make an impact.  Heavier body for an IPA, the yeast very much responsible for that, average carbonation. Dries impressively with accompanying bitterness. Warming alcohol with a touch of soap.  Impressive IPA standing by itself but rye as a novelty ingredient really adds a unique spice note and exceptional dryness despite malts darkening this up.

Grapefruit rind, tangerine, pineapple, bit of alcohol, sweet and roasty malt with a little chocolate in the background. Really nice smelling stuff.  Wow, this stuff is really flavourful and well-balanced. There don't seem to be too many beers around pairing this amount of biting, citrusy hops with such an appropriate level of malt .This is perfectly executed. Big grapefruit rind, resiny pine and tangy rye to start, with dark caramel, some roast and a little alcohol following up. A touch of cocoa powder and some pithy bitterness finish off with some drying and pine lingers on the palate.  Viscous, almost sticky medium body with a light-but-present carbonation.  This beer is the best of so many worlds. I love dark hoppy brews and I seem to love beers brewed with rye; I've also always considered a well-hidden 8% to be my favourite ABV.

Sticky powdered malt like lacing coats the glass. Nose is boozie and packed with earthy floral hops. A slight tinge of grapefruit is present as well. As it warms more caramel and toffee are present in the entire beer and has a awesome hop presence and the buiscuity mouthfeel is not outdone.

Aromatic hops waft from the glass, a touch woody, and a touch herbal with nuances of sweet malt and generous rye.  The flavor offers much more noticeable woody hops that are quite oily. Hops become herbal and spicy as the beer warms with the rye present the entire time. The flavor is also packed with bread-like malts but it comes back to the generous hops.

Goes down super smooth with just enough carbonation.  An excellent whatever it is, rye beer, IPA, it hits the spot. Way less expensive to get a four pack than a few bombers.

A small off-white head bubbles out of existence after only a short time, and there isn't any sort of lacing to speak of. Honestly, I don't care because the scent is too pleasant, with its seductive combo of grapefruit citrus and spicy rye leading the charge. Bready malts round off the nose giving a nice, even character and welcoming impression.  Now amplify the nose, and make every aspect of it even stronger. That's what it tastes like. Incredibly well-executed punch of bitter hoppiness, rye, and a kick of bread give this beer a complex, tasty flavor. Sensual body slides against the tongue, with the perfect amount of carbonation satisfying any beer-drinker's palate. Heck, it even goes down smooth and easy, making me wonder where in the world that alcohol disappeared to. Frankly, amazing.

610,3158,afksports,3.97,"One of the very first beers I had on my little Top100 quest (based on the top American beers from last August), this fine American IPA from Bear Republic in California was a good introduction to the craft beer community. Hop Rod Rye. With a flaming car on the front. Sexy.  Almost red from the tap, the murky amber body has a bit of head that lingers around just enough to keep you drinking. On the nose the head produces fermented rye, malt, and pine hops - with just a touch of citrus and sugar. The taste is composed of the same elements. While enjoying them it's easy to forget about the 8.0% alcohol you're imbibing. HRR leads with pine trees and grassy hops, comes through in the middle and back with rye and bittering hops, and all the while has a malty sweetness to cover it up and push through the alcohol.  Overall the medium bodied brew is a solid IPA, and a solid offering for rye lovers that's available in half the bodegas in New York City. That's a feat to accomplish, and although my rating may be slightly affected by my anti-rye bias, I should still salute Bear Republic for this hot rod of a beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Rschis16,4.38,"Almost as brown as the bottle it came in, with a beautiful half-inch to inch foamy off-white head that doesn't go anywhere after the pour. Lacing? You betcha. Tons of hop sediment float around at the bottom, and there's even some left in the bottom of the bottle. Gorgeous beer. The smell is pleasant and refreshing. You can tell tons of hops went into the development of this one. Citrus hops? That's what I get but I could be wrong. Whatever they are, they are potent.  Whoa, first sip's reaction is ""now that's an interesting and unique take on an IPA"". Certainly very hoppy and robustly bitter on the back side of the taste, but also pleasantly balanced out by a certain heartiness that becomes this beer's character. The ultra-crisp mouthfeel and dry finish also help to balance out any and all flavors within. Virtually no alcohol taste at all at 8% ABV. While I can only imagine that the 18% rye malt is giving this beer its uniqueness, it doesn't take away from the overall balance of the beer. That is why this beer shines. It's unique and delicious and will be sure to please any hophead, but it's so delicately balanced that most people would be able to appreciate it. Just one of these has turned it into one of my favorite IPA's, or specialty ales, whatever it is, and it has peaked my interest for some other rye beers. Great beer, congrats and thanks to Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Grass, apples, white bread.  T: Sweetness upfront with apple quickly replaced by bite of bitterness and hops: mild pine, herbal essence. The bitterness lingers and transitions into a nice pale malt experience highlighted by slight rye bread sourness. Ends crisp.  M: Thinner with good carbonation.  O: Great rye pale ale.

S: Good peach/mango aromas, both bright and deep. Quite good.  T: Sweet grapefruit and a hint of leather up front. Thin rye sweetness in the middle with some resiny pine on the finish. Tiny bit of spicy alcohol pokes through. As the beer warms, the sweet middle changes to more of a biscuity quality that persists further into the finish, but still yields to the pine at the end. I do like this.  M: Light/medium mouthfeel with good creaminess and a little oil on the finish. Creaminess grows as the beer warms.  O: Really nice and enjoyable beer, goes down very smooth for 8%.

The taste is both sweet and bitter (I’d say bitter sweet, but that implies that some part of this beer is not good). The beer starts off very sweet and then the hops kick in. The hops bite is very good, but not over the top. This is a very balanced rye beer. The mouthfeel is very good too, not to heavy, not too thin.

610,3158,bobhits,4.23,"Received in a trade from UCLABrewN84, great extra!  Rye IPAs are the way to do a darker double IPA. The more I have of these the more I like them.  The appearance is a dark amber that’s darker because of a lack of clarity, seems to work for this one. Pours a huge head that’s off white with good lacing.  Caramel malt with lots of hops and a hint of rye (what is the smell it isn’t sour and isn’t really bitter) start off the nose. Toast, and dark burnt malt hints fall into the back ground.  No clue on the age of this one, but the hops are taking a bit of a back seat here. Unlike others were the malt starts to take control the rye here really makes for an enjoyable experience. Caramel, toast, and floral citrus hops. Creates a deeper and darker flavor than most IPAs. Not the most clean tasting but the lingering confusion of flavors is more than welcome here.  Word to brewers, use rye in a black double IPA…really I’m waiting! Racer 5 is still among the best IPA’s I’ve ever had and Hop Rod is another wonderful beer from bear republic. I’m hoping this beer is a hair old and the fresher version has more hops, but either way wonderful beer!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

I wonder how this would be if they did a ""Belgo"" version like the Stone barley wine. Hints of smoke, lots of caramel, and the impression of a Scotch Ale with some extra hops. Quite bitter after the malt, but fades to a nice complex mix.  I have liked this beer for a long time. Glad to see it's rated highly by a lot of people. It's my idea of an IPA.

The bottle is not super fresh and some fading of the hops could lead to this. Pine and citrus hops blend with an earthy rye and soft caramel malt aroma. Very pleasant smelling beer.  The flavor mimics what was picked up by the nose. Slightly resinous pine and citrusy hops blend upfront with a sweet malt flavor. The earthy, almost tobacco rye flavor really compliments the pine flavor while providing a perfect counterpoint to the sweetness.  Medium bodied beer, carbonation clocks in at a low to moderate level. The finish is on the drier side though there is a bit of resinous hop flavor which will finger.

Not as hoppy as the smell. Quite impressed.  Mouthfeel was just right letting the taste coat the palate oh so good.  Overall this is a top ten for me.

The brew is a hazy, dark reddish-brown color, with active carbonation keeping the head respectable.  A generous hop blast hits the mouth first, with further bittering in the middle of the palate, nearly concealing the toasted rye flavors which sneak in near the back of the palate to produce a full-flavored complexity. Some side notes of barley and cereal grains with just a hint of toffee. Although listed at 8% abv, the alcohol is not very noticeable. Hop bitterness lingers on the tip of the tongue well after the swallow.  Nice recipe for a ""specialty"" ale, as it's called, especially for hop heads.

This ""HOP ROD RYE Specialty Ale"" was my first BEAR REPUBLIC experience and the CA location made me automatically knock off critical bias points. EVEN STILL, it fizzed and finessed its way into my top ten. The last Belgian style ale has now been knocked off my top ten list - now leaving only inhabitiants of porters, IPA's and stouts. HOT ROD RYE ALE has a very nice cap pop aroma of hops - though less than my other IPA's on the list.

Great lacing all the way down the sides during the entire beer session.  Smells hoppy. Flowers. Citrus. A little faint though, could be stronger.  A darkish earthy flavor mixed with hops. Must be some malts in here balancing out the hops quite well. A balanced beer - there is no one characteristic that stands out. There is slight hop bitterness but also a little malty sweetness.

More aroma hops end the onslaught of hoppy goodness.  T: A smooth malty amber beer is rapidly giving way to a hop barrage. The toffee and toasted rye and barley give way to pine, grapefruit, pineapple and herbal fresh, flavorful hops and plenty of them. Some spice and bitterness from the rye and hops finish the tastes.

I'm not one to really factor in appearance when reviewing beers; I'm a homebrewer and I'm guilty of some odd-looking beers from time to time myself. But this beer is just strange looking. It has a wierd mud-color to it. Not quite brown, not quite black, but also has some strange opaque translucence. No head at all, even after a vigorous poor.  Looks are deceiving, and aside from that, this is a terrific tasting beer. Wonderful blend of hops and malt. More robust body than your typical IPA, yet still retains the fresh, hop flavors and aromas you'd expect. Drinkability? This one has it in spades, and goes down scary smooth. The ABV can really whollop you, since you don't even notice that you've just pounded down two in a row.  Great beer, replaces Racer 5 as my favorite offering from Bear Republic.

610,3158,DoctorDog,4.42,"Presentation: From a 12 oz. bottle into a nonic.  A- Pours a deep amber/copper and clear. Pours with ~3 fingers of creamy, light tan head, which fades slowly to a thin cap.  S- An assault of slightly spicy citrus/grapefruit and pine hop aromas upon pouring. Beneath the hops emerges a subtle caramel sweetness, which comes through a bit more as the head fades and as the drink warms a bit.  T- Spicy, pine, herbal, grapefruit hop bitterness, which is superbly balanced by a solidly sweet caramel malt. Really nice.  M- Moderate carbonation and a medium feel.  O- Very good. A real pleaser on on fronts, and quite easy drinking to boot.  Future outlook: In honor of my trip to California in a few hours, I decided to honor this far-too-long overdue Cali brew....and am now kicking myself for waiting this long.

Smell is floral hops and caramel malt, with a pleasant mild alcohol aroma. The taste is hops on the front end, followed by a thick tasty caramel malt, followed by a sharp hop finish. Based on the aroma, and the advertising on the bottle and the name, I was expecting all hops, but the beer has a very solid malt base. There is also an interesting spiciness in the finish that must be the rye.  The mouthfeel is slightly syrupy with low to moderate carbonation.

Soft, off-white to light tan head with great resilience and nice, sticky lacing coating the side of the glass. Feel like I might have to get out a scrubber to get the suds off after it dries. Slightly cloudy appearance and some ""floaties"" - not exactly sediment - which the bottle attributes to the massive amount of hops dropped into this unfiltered concoction.  Smell includes that strange spiciness of a rye brew, hops with hints of a number of subtle aromas - grapefruit, flowers, pine and a really subtle herbal scent.  Wow, I'm expecting something like Racer 5 with rye elements. Instead, my buds are assaulted with a rich, caramel malt, along with hoppy bitterness. After the first impression, that odd rye spiciness rises to the surface, then succumbs to the hop profile that includes primarily peels from citrus fruits - not so much of a pine or floral taste as the aroma might have suggested.  Medium body, on the low end of moderately carbonated, yielding a fairly soft and voluptuous mouthfeel. Even silkier as this brew warms. The style guidelines suggest 45-50 degrees, but I started really loving this one at about 50-55.

610,3158,Schwarzbart,4.88,"I think the first think to note is that the bottle is really cool. The color when poured is really good also and gets a big wow factor with a dark mahogony brown color. The head is a 2 finger, off-white, creamy and rocky one. Quite a bit of sediment can be seen when held up to the light. The lacing is spectacular after the first sip until the end with a creamy draping.  The nose is a hop load, smelling of grapefruit, spruce, citrus and lime.  The rye is quite detectable, which I expected, since the bottle noted that it was 18% rye. It adds some spice to the hops and even some more bitterness. The sweet malts are there and try to balance out the hops and rye and doesn't do a bad job at all. Hops are sprucey, grassy, piney and spicy, so they bite just like I'd expect. Caramel, bready malts come out more with warming.  Creamy and chewy mouthfeel with a medium full body. Well balanced with high hop bitterness just like it should be for a beer of this style.

I can even detect a little cocoa. Mouthfeel is great. Good carbonation and supple without being heavy. Almost creamy texture. Interesting palate as well. The rye gives it more of a grassy taste but the bitterness from the hops rounds this out quite well. Finishes rather clean. The hops still provide some resiny bitterness but the rye makes it more crisp and the roasted malt keeps too much sweetness from creeping in. Definitely not your classic DIPA but a welcome interpretation and an impressive effort. I would almost call it a brown IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,EricCioe,3.83,"This pours a great looking mahogany with pretty red highlights at the edges, a nice frothy two finger ivory head rising with the pour and leaving good lace. On the nose there is a combination of the spicy rye with a big hop presence manifesting in citrus fruits with maybe just a bit of pine resin. In the mouth there comes some somewhat dry malt base, but the rye adds a nice fuzzy edge of spice to it. All the while there is an overriding grapefruit note that adds some spice to the rye. The body is medium and the feel is ultra creamy, coating the palate in a pleasant way and leaving a long finish. This is a very nice variation on the IPA theme, with the rye adding a good deal of interest to a style that's been done to death.  EDIT - Had this side by side with Ruthless Rye at a tasting last night. Comparatively, it wasn't as dry as Ruthless, and there was a bit of sweetness that seemed out of place creeping into the taste.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

The rye spice is distinct and and pungent, the resin is soft yet strong. Citrus offers a cutting edge through the rye/resin base, while malt sweetness once again rounds everything out. This is a ridiculously good beer, and having it on cask is even better than I imagined it would be.  Mouthfeel is full and creamy at times, crisp and slick at other points. It does what it has to do, and the cask carbonation is perfect on top of it all. Drinkability is amazing for such a strongly flavored beer; finish is spicy and bitter without being offensive, and really makes you want another sip. Stickiness is just enough to not get in the way while adding another element. Phenomenal.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Smakawhat,4.15,"Poured from the bottle into a Nonic pint glass.  An off tan light brown head that forms so perfectly foamy. Real nice retention and about three solid fingers on the pour. Body is just slightly opaque but a dense looking solid amber color. Real great looking beer here. Not much lacing.  Great nose on this drink. A slight grapefruit but a unique mix of sweet malt perfection with the fruit in front. Hint but small of toasted bread.  Taste though is kind of small, but is there. Real good feel but a bitter hop presence in the mid palate, and lingering on the finish. No sense of sweetness on this one, and kind of never leaving. I was hoping for some bread based on a hint from the nose and this malt sensation but not so much. It's got a good hop feel for sure but I don't even feel a citrus punch from this, but a slight oil citrus on the finish in my mouth only after the swallow.  An enjoyable beer just verging on the cusp of real greatness I think. Glad I tried it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,claytong,3.35,"I wasn't impressed, I was hoping for more rye taste, but instead I got bitter and a bit more bitter. I've been on a rye kick and this one helped me get off it. It was very disappointing especially for the price. If you live in Colorado go to Averys to check out their new rye beer, amazing.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,betsona,3.96,"Thanks to seeswo for this 22oz bottle, poured into a tulip. No date information on the bottle.  A- Pours a dark rusty amber with a beige frothy head. Good head retention throughout the drink. High amount of head lacing on the glass that made an impact on me.  S- Got some grapefruit rind with some slightly burnt caramel. A bit of uncooked rye comes through sort of like a cheap rye whiskey. Really nothing all that powerful or memorable.  T- A lot of grapefruit, but not the traditional ruby; rather yellow. The bitterness comes through in the yellow grapefruit taste, but is balanced by the smoothness of the rye at the end. Didn't get much lingering taste. A little bit of spice comes through, which is probably due to the rye.  M- Medium to heavy body with good carbonation. Has a slight creamy texture that is unique and something that further distinguishes it from other IPAs.  O- I can see why a lot of people are high on this one. The rye is a nice touch that other brewers should consider trying once in awhile. It is extremely drinkable seeing as I forgot I had finished my glass off. A nice beer that I look forward to trying on tap.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ChefCook730,4.24,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz. bottle.  A: The beer has some sediment; not sure why as I know this isn't a bottle conditioned or refermented brew.. THe color is a medium amber mahogany yet it is translucent, letting in about 50% of the light. Decent head when poured dissipated after two minutes.  S: This beer smells great. A very nice balance of booze with piney/citrusey hops. Makes you want to dive right in. If you've had they're more popular and more readily available Racer 5 IPA you won't want to wait to give this one a gulp!  T: Don't get me wrong.. It's a very nice ""strong"" IPA..It's certainly not a double IPA. Was slightly underwhelmed by the flavor after experiencing such tantalizing aroma smelling the beer. It is still a hearty and satisfying, flavorful brew. I have found that not only am I a fan of pacific IPA's but also in particular I am partial to Rye IPAs. This is a fine example.  M: The beer is smooth on the palate. For the style it is very drinkable and boasts respectable hop flavor with balance; not too bitter and plenty refreshing.  O: I like this beer. I am partial to IPAs in general but this is a winner for sure.

610,3158,ChugginOil,4.05,"When poured, a honey brown brew settles a dark hazelnut brown that is almost opaque. Less than a fingers worth of off white head sits and dissipates quickly, leaving bubble rings along the glass.  The nose offers a combination of pine scented hop oils and some apricot is evident as well. There is a bit of a sweet malt scent behind it all.  The taste sweet up front and a bit malty but immediately kicks in a bitter hop sensation. There is a pleasant pine flavor along with a nice caramel topped hop addition.  The mouthfeel is crisp and bitter with enough carbonation to donate to the hop kick. Pretty full as well.  Overall, this is a pleasant brew and getting better as it warms.

Nice pine notes as well. Taste is DELICIOUS!...as usual. Very well balance blend of citrus (grapefruit, lemon, and tangerine), rye, sweet malt, pine, and floral hops. Finishes with some nice bitterness. No sign of booziness or alcohol taste. Mouthfeel is full bodied, rich, complex, and finishes smooth. Drinkability is very high...scary for how high the ABV is.

Smell I'm getting mostly hop resins. Mostly citrus. No alcohol and not very sweet.  KaBlam!! There it is!! The bitter hop punch of a yellow grapefruit or any other bitter citrus you can think of. The alcohol comes out a bit and there is some tartness at the end. As it warms there is quite a bit of sweetness coming from the malts. This one is sooo good!!!  The mouth is as it should be. Smooth, full to the end and warms the lower throat and belly nicely.  Overall I must say I have always enjoyed this offering from Bear Republic. I am very fortunate to have this on the shelves of my local bottle shops for the taking, whenever I want.

610,3158,yeahnatenelson,3.93,"Appearance -- Pours a dark rosy amber hue akin to a red grape with a tuft of creamy beige head. A whitewash of lace coats the glass as the beer goes down. It certainly makes an impression.  Smell -- Grapefruit rind, pine resin, toasted malt, a modicum of caramel sweetness, and a waft of rye.  Taste -- The hop character is a great balance of juicy grapefruit and pine reisn. Malt base is that of golden toast, wild flower honey, with the sweetness definitely understated and in even keel with the rest of the beer. The rye is certainly spicy, but not in overabundance - it puts a nice slant on the other components.  Mouthfeel -- A hair above medium-bodied with mild carbonation, nearly creamy - a miss.  Overall -- I see the appeal, and honestly, the biggest complaint about this beer - the mouthfeel - could just as easily be the fault of the bar I drank it in. Very much a rye IPA, meaning that it's more of an American IPA with rye spiciness added versus a hop-forward rye beer.  Glad I finally found this on tap as every single bottle I've ever seen of this has been coated in dust. IPA with dust? Cannot trust.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,SpeedwayJim,4.1,"12oz. bottle. No freshness/bottling date. Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint.  A: Standard pour yields a frothy 2.5 finger light creamsicle head with good retention. Beer is a clear, dark, brownish amber. Lacing is oustanding. Ringed and layered with excellent retention. A gorgeous brew.  S: Nose is pungent citrus and piney hops. Autumn leaves, cane sugar, and resin. Fresh and very aromatic. Spot on for its style.  T: Opens resiny. Tea leaf bitterness that is characteristic of a rye beer. Citrus and pine hoppiness towards the middle with hints of tree bark. Definitely a west coast style IPA with no semblance of a malt balance. Finish is bitter dried leaves, grass, and tree sap. Aftertaste is a sticky resin hop bitterness. Nothing outrageous but very solid all the way around.  M: Light bodied and moderately carbonated. Slight prickle in the mouth and somewhat lively but rather smooth going down. Finish is messy with a sticky aftertaste that lingers. Personally, I'd rather have a quicker finish and after but this is again, very good.  O: Bear Republic has a number of beers on the top IPA list and I'm beginning to see why. An outstandingly solid beer all the way around from the appearance to the smell, taste, and feel. Definitely worth having.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Definite heavy on the rye spiciness as well, almost a black pepper kick in the back of the throat. Nutty taste to the malts.  M - This has a nice level of carbonation and medium body, normal for the style.  O - Solid brew for sure, just not sure I'm into rye beers, they spiciness always kills them for me.

This is quickly met by a bold hop profile that is paired very well with rye. The finish is bold and bitter. Everything is very well balanced with big time flavors.

It lives up to the name -- deep malt and rye pumped up on significant hops and IBUs.  richer tasting than a straight IPA, especially nowaddays -- this is way more thick and sumptuous than what we are calling West Coast IPA. i think simply calling it a Hoppy Rye Ale is enough. good to the last drop!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,Hoagie1973,3.54,"Semi-cloudy deep amber color. Small Cream colored head reduces to a froth leaving very light lacing. Smells fruity and hoppy before ever reaching your nose. Definitely has a unique, more bready malt character that is very interesting due to the rye, unfortunately it's then blasted off of your tastebuds by a ridiculous amount of hops. They start out flavorful and piney, then transition into an intense bitterness that lingers long into the dry finish; a bit too long. Full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. The addition of rye is very interesting and different and I wish the hops would allow that side of the beer to shine a bit more. Overall it's not at all bad, but instead of being something truly special, in the end it's just another hop bomb.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

This is only the second rye ale that I've had, but I love the style. Great spin on a traditional AIPA.  M: Prickly but creamy at the same time. Medium body.  D: Good. Wouldn't want to make this a session beer though.  This is a bold, delicious beer. Love the spiciness of the rye alongside the hops.

I've been having a lot of fruity IPAs, like Nugget Nectar, so the upfront bitterness of this brew is a nice change of pace. Surprisingly smooth drinking for such a rye and hops bite. Most brewers wave some rye near the kettle and call it a rye beer, this one brings the rye for a non-sweet bite, which accounts for very little lacing on the glass.

Finished a brown bomber without any problem despite the hop bitterness  Overall, wonderful for any hop-head, and a unique taste (my first rye ale).

Taste - You definitely get a very bitter hop flavor but in a very clean, crisp way. As expected the dark caramel malts and the rye come through much more as it warms up and add a great complexity to the beer.

T: Quite complex - hit with hops, initially, then some sweet maltiness, and finishes with rye/bitters.  M: Smooth warming heat, with some prickly carbonatino.

A semi-transparent ale. Not as fully visible as the racer 5 but still able to see through.  S- Rye bread, malt, hops, fruit, yeast. The ale is overwhelmingly more hoppy than i expected. I do get a nice amount of rye which is good as well. Reminds me of Founders Red Rye PA.  T- Hops ad rye again. I nice and smooth brew though, not what i thought when i saw the amount of carbonation through the glass. I thought it was going to pack a punch on my tongue but it didnt.

Excellent IPA flavor, with the rye adding more depth.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with balanced carbonation and a dry finish and a warming feel from the alcohol.

The offwhite head is not as thick I was expecting but leaves some lacing behind.  I like the smell, citrus hoppy but with a light perfume scent to it as well. Very good.  The taste is better and amped up significantly. There's a good malt backbone here but it's nearly lost in the layers of hops. Citrus notes and bitterness battle back and forth for supremacy. Really well done.  Like I mentioned in the beginning, mouthfeel is light for a beer of this strength. It smooth but not sticky and the carbonation is very right.

The lacing is spotty despite the absence of a sustaining head.  The smell is malty with a prevalent rye spice. A good deal of grapefruit comes through along with some pine.  There is plenty of rye that balances the malts in the forefront. Suddenly, a large dose of grapefruit comes through. I'm a sucker for grapefruit hops, and this really hits the spot. A bit of pine comes through as well, likely due to the multiple hops used.  My mouth is satisfied by the smooth full feeling of this brew. The low carbonation with the full mouthfeel creates a soft character.  This is the best rye beer I've ever had. It may be tough to drink throughout the night, but the 12oz I just had was not enough.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,stonermouse,4.52,"Poured into a Sam Adams glass.  Pours a very pretty amber, with a touch of red and a touch of haze. Exactly what I hoped for and expected.  The aroma here is moderately strong, but nice. A little sweetness comes through, with some grassyness. It reminds me a bit of a coastal marsh in the summer.  Flavor is complex. The first thing I noticed was the roasted aftertaste- not because it was dominant, but because it was suprising. The malts are as spicy as I had hoped, and the hops are both citrusy and grassy. The roastiness gives this a Black IPA feel, but the biting rye and the crisp, clean hops really dominate. Great flavor all around.  Mouthfeel is solid for the flavors. It's a little sticky, but the roasted flavor and stickiness blend well at the back end.  Drinkability is immeasurable. This beer is an all-occasions, anytime-type brew, and is just mild enough in ABVs to have a few. If it was a little more affordable, this would be a superb 12-pack purchase for company.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,rand,4.42,"From 22oz bomber to pint glass  Pours a dark amber, clear, with a slight chilled-haze. It forms a frothy head that leaves reams of sticky lacing. You can immediately notice big wafts of fresh pine carried by a bready, malty-sweet backdrop. The flavors have more depth than the nose, as the noted pine scent is met with layers of citrus. Lemon, orange zest, a little grapefruit. Quite bitter as well. The added rye provides an undertone which reminds of honey-sweet bread crust. Malts give plenty of support and make for bready flavors and mouthfeel. Chewy but not sticky. There's a slight alcohol punch near the end of the sip but it doesn't linger, leaving a bitter-sweet aftertaste.  Hop Rod Rye is a hopbomb, no doubt, but layered, complex and delicious. Candy-sweet notes became more prominent as the beer warmed and made the bitter tones extremely palatable. It was truly hard to stop drinking this.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,Fenris244,3.98,"Pours dark amber, beautiful 2 finger off white sticky head, great retention, left a thick lace while drinking.  Pine, candied lemon peel, I think I smell the rye but that could be my imagination.  Harsh bitterness up front, lemon and almost a grape fruit flavor, the bitterness lingers well into the finish, malty finish good sweetness on the finish too, on another note I would never expect this to be an 8% abv beer the alcohol is very well masked by the flavors.  Light in body, almost thin, the carbonation is nice a little light though.  Very drinkable, super flavorful smooth beer, to bad it only comes in 4 packs",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,CaptDavyJones,4.7,"Poured a clear dark brown color from a 22 oz bomber, with ABV on the label. Didn't see freshness date anywhere on the bottle. One finger head that dissipates slowly leaving behind some really nice lacing. Very good carbonation Aroma is absolutely hoppy. Nice floral notes, with hints of hops and rye/fennel seed like aroma coming through. Ooooh yeahhh.... an all out assault on the taste buds. The taste upfront is perfectly bitter hoppy goodness. Balanced nicely with hints of malt/sweetness in the finish which lasts for a few seconds before the hop bitterness takes over again. Perfect 'bittersweet symphony' going on here. Consistent lacing throughout the duration of the drink. Even with it's higher ABV, this is very drinkable. Very good mouthfeel, chewy and oily hoppy goodness. One of my all time favorite brew's from Bear Republic. This is one IPA that I can have anytime, anyplace. A must-try IPA for every hop-head. Highly recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,latackbeer,4.7,"22 oz bottle with great value! Poured a wonderful pillowy white head, the smell of deep grapefruit tickled my nose. Color is dark brown with reddish at the edges.

Lacing is an A++++  S: Nice citric smell with a faint twinge reminiscent of rye. Some maltyness in the background.  T: Very nice and balanced. Very hoppy and bitter all the way through the drink. The rye is very present in the taste.  First off this is an exceptional beer, but this is not a repeat buy for me. Amazing look and smell but the taste was just a little off at the end for me. I credit this to the rye. World Class beer Bear Republic Brewing Co.!!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,CrazyDavros,3.77,"Pours dark copper with a large creamy head. Nose shows pine, resin and grapefruit in large quantities with supporting sweet crystal malt alongside. Very similar flavours, but with a toasty character joining in. Finishes with a massive grapefruit-tinged bitterness. Pretty full-on. Carbonation is a little high. Finishes too dry and bitter in my opinion, and there's not enough going on in the way of hoppy flavours.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ColdPoncho,4.8,"A - A lovely crimson body with a formidable tan head. Tons and tons of floaties, which surprised me. A second tasting (4-5-2011) reveals almost no floaties and really beautiful lacing. This looks so good  S - Sweet and creamy hops - not sure if that's diacetyl. hint of rye spice. Some tropical fruits and dark fruits and the citrus tang of hops. A really good, and interesting nose. Not as hop heavy as I'd expect from an IPA.  T - Incredible balance. Very present bitter and citrus hops, and that definitely dominates, but the sweet and spicy malts and rye really bring a great level of complexity to this beer, and really balance out the citrus and bitter hop profile. Wow!  M - Medium-big body, a touch dry and a touch heavy on the carbonation. Very nice mouthfeel, especially if this is really a single IPA.  D - I think this is incredibly good tasting and is very easy to drink. I would drink this every day.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,heebes,4.12,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a dark brown with reddish tints, thin off white foamy head. Thin lacing follows the brew down the glass. Nose is delicious auroma of fresh hops; pine, citrus and honey. Good presence of malt in there too. Taste has the distinct rye flavour, malt body with some bitterhops and a quick finish ending dry. Medium to heavy mouthfeel. Pretty great tasting beer and unique IPA. No idea how fresh this bottle is but I imagine the Hop Rod Rye really fresh is amazing. Perhaps a revist on the next beer haul from Buffalo.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BigB415,4.71,"With this being my first rye beer I didn't know what to expect but to my delight this worked out extremely well. Pours dark red color with high lacing. It's unfiltered so you can't see through to the other side since there is a cloud of sediment in your way. When I smell I get hops and another element, perhaps that's the rye since the bottle says it's brewed with 18% rye. Tastes like an IPA and even the after-taste tastes like an IPA but to me it's a mellow IPA. No hop bombs here. Nice job Bear Republic. Another winner.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,weizenbob,4,"This bomber was received as a great extra off my wants list in a trade with jmkratt. Thanks John! The label informs me that this is brewed with 18% rye. Try as I might, I could not locate a bottle date. I poured this into a wine goblet.  An aggressive pour gives two fingers of foamy tan head. Retention is very good. Sticky bubbly lacing lines the sides of the goblet. The beer is a dark walnut brown featuring very little translucence. There is a small amount of visible carbonation.  The brew is heavily aromatic even from across the table. A nice floral bouquet wafts effortlessly from the goblet. There is grapefruit, and bready malt. Alcohol is noted on the tail end but only because I was looking for it. It is in good balance.  This is indeed a hoppy brew. A watery sweetness sets the pace but is quickly lapped by some mellow rye maltiness with hints of citrus. The beer starts slow and easy but takes on a parabolic flavor shift. Slowly the flavors blossom like a flower before burning up in a blaze of alcohol and grapefruit bitterness. As hop oils coat the mouth, the bitterness lasts and lasts.  This rye is medium bodied. The aggressive alcohol content provides a nice weight and texture. The minor amount of carbonation also aids in this texture. The beer makes full use of its 80 IBUs. The full on bitterness and 8% alcohol content are telling me that I'm going to be done with this when the bomber is empty. However, this bottle was no chore.  Not surprisingly I found Hop Rod Rye to be comparable to Founders Red's Rye PA. As Founders is distributed here I will probably not seek out Hop Rod again; but if you are in an area of the country that distributes one but not the other, I can fully recommend either of these fine hopped up rye ales.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,NWer,4.73,"Bomber. 8% abv on the label. It's about time I tried this beer. I've looked at it long enough and what a treat. Dark murky brown a result of being unfiltered and loaded with hops - according to the label. Fine with me. A beauty to behold much more appealing than the highly filtered stuff. Rye and hops. i've died and gone to heaven. Wonderful balance to be praised with words usually reserved for the most revered beers. Outstanding effort. If you haven't tried a rye beer and want to, this is the one. Update 11/08/11 Reality check just to make sure I didn't get caught up in the moment. Revisited since my initial review and it's everything I remembered. The gold standard for the style in my opinion. So, why is this classified an American IPA when clearly it's a Rye beer? It even says so on their website.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,mikeg67,4.29,"12 oz bottle. Pours reddish-brown with a thick, off-white, foamy, long lasting head. Aroma is of sweet caramel malt, ripe fruit and piney hops. Medium, slightly crisp body. Herbal hops, spicy rye are balanced by caramel malt and ripe fruit on the palate. Long, spicy, dry finish. Simply the great brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,TKEbeerman,4.33,"A: Poured into my pint glass, this brew pours a chestnut brown with a 1 inch medium tan head. This head is leaving some good lacing, and this brew is almost impressive enough to be perfect.  S: A strong rye/toasty aroma is present among piny ""raw"" hops. The aroma in this brew is great, yet underpowered (as is with Racer 5).  T: The flavor completely makes up for the aroma. Full of piny fresh hop goodness. Rye is a strong backbone and a welcome flavor change for an ""IPA"".  MF: Mouthfeel is good for a hopped up hot rod. Finish is as smooth as a Lincoln.  D: Drinkability at 8% is spot on.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Cylinsier,4.03,"12 oz.  Pours a cloudy reddish brown with bits of particulate matter floating in it, presumably yeast, with a medium eggshell head with pretty good retention.  Smells of strong floral and bitter hops with hints of mild rye grain.  Tastes hoppy and bitter, with noticeable rye in the aftertaste. A bit of sweetness rounds out the profile.  Mouth is moderate with mild carbonation on the back of the tongue.  A very good and tasty rye-P-A. A must try for IPA fans.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,daliandragon,4.48,"I can't remember why I haven't reviewed this before but I've had it a few times and I liked it a lot. Pours a medium brown with a transluscent body hinted with orange and ruby. Head and lace are impressive and tan. The nose is a hoppy melange of pine, citrus, and other fruit. Sugary sweet malt balances the bitterness well.  An initial blast of hops is rounded and counteracted brilliantly by the full caramel and bread notes in the malt. The rye adds a spicy note that hits the spot. The aftertaste returns order to this IPA with pine and citrus. Overall, this is satisfying and delicious and goes down ridiculously easy for eight percent.  Wow, this is even better than I remember. Must be tried.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,GarthDanielson,4.29,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a ruby amber color, with a thin, thick layer of sparse head. A little bit of haze in the coloring, and lots of sediment throughout the beer, which they do a good job of warning you about on the label. Smells are heavy on the hops, with a little malty sweet balance. The beer is bitter-sweet, with hops and caramel sweetness. Also a smokey-toasted malt flavor throughout, which keeps the hop flavors nice and smooth. The beer is a bit dry and smooth in mouth. The sediment really issn't overly bothersome. Quick on the finish, with a lingering hoppy and sour aftertaste. The beer leaves alot of flavor on the back of the tongue, while puckering the front tongue and lips a bit. Makes it really easy for the follow-up gulp.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,JohnnyChicago,4.2,"Split a bomber; poured into a pint glass.  A: Ruby red with a three finger head that sticks around.  S: Lots of hops! Just a hop bomb in the nose.  T: The hops dominate, but the twangy sourness from the rye peeps through and the caramel-like malts a present as well.  D: Good drinkability. Not overbearing or heavy, but nice and interesting.  Overall: Well its not an IPA, thats for sure. Its a rye beer, and if not that, a Double IPA, but its a great beer nonetheless.

610,3158,mjsheehan08,4.3,"Two finger head sits on top of this reddish, woody colored beer. Has kind of a dark murky brown look to it.  Really great hop oil smell with some grassy notes kind of smells like dried grass. Really floral notes that leave me thinking that I really like the smell of Rye in my IPAs.  Sweet bready malts that finish with a really great hop finish. A little bit of spiceness is present from the Rye, and it is blended in a perfect way with the malt for one of the best feelings an IPA has ever given my palate. Honestly, there isnt much to say about this beer other than it is fantastic. I could barely take my time with this beer because it was so good I wanted to keep drinking it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,StaveHooks,4.23,"A - Pours a slightly hazy amber brown. The 2 finger tan head stands strong and holds very tight. A good amount of sticky lace.  S - Large amounts of resiny and pungent grapefruit with a good dose of fruit bread wrapped in. Very hoppy nose on this brew.  T - A fruity toffee malt dominates. Fresh grapefruit, pineapple, and some pine adds lots of flavor with the bitterness sticking to the sides of the tongue. Faint hints of rye but more of a tobacco flavor comes through to add an extra layer of flavor. Great finish. Dry and hoppy. Bitterness lingers.  M - Medium to full bodied smoothly floats over the palate.  The nose is full of hop aroma and the flavors have serious balance. The rye is there but I probably wouldn't have picked it out if I didn't know.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,gopens44,4.43,"A - Big generous frothy head that doesn't go anywhere quickly. Color was a hazy dark copper with a pleasant fun time floaty object thing happening.  S - Bright, vibrant piney hops with a very well balanced amount of malt aromas rising up as well.  T - Brilliantly bitter and extremely well crafted. Balance is almost great, yet it seems to be just a little hot, bu tin a very nice ""bold drinking experience"" kind of way. The piney hops in the nose come across in the taste with just a touch of earthiness to it.  M - Very smooth and again, well balanced in the carbonation and body.

610,3158,LukeD23,4.23,"Pours a deep amber color, with a minimal head. Got some floaters in this one, but not to much.  Aroma, is nice, apricot and caramel stawberry, slight earthy note of pine. Overall aroma is sweet. I do get a strange smell, I think it might be the rye, spicy and tart.  Flavor, I love the finish on the flavor, crisp, slightly spicy and loads of tropical fruit. Up front is nice as well, big sweet hop flavors backed with spicy malt and mango. The flavor on this beer is so wonderfully complex, it rolls from one flavor to the next so nicely.  Mouthfeel is nice, full with a crisp finish. Drinkability is good but it is a big beer with alot of flavor, I would say one to two at most for me.  Overall this is a wonderful imperial IPA. It kinda bridges a west coast DIPA with an East Coast imperial IPA. I like it, Im sure it would be even bigger on the aroma fresh on the west coast.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Grassy hops as well. Rye toast earthiness.  Hops lead the taste, citrusy, bitter, pine and grass. It has a nice bite to it. Similar to a creamy brown ale with a bit of spice and a solid dose of hops. The flavors blend and complement each other quite well. Earthy/herbal malts with toast and some toffee sweetness.  Leaves a smooth dry aftertaste from the hops.

The carbonation is smooth and has an incredible mouthfeel that makes you want to savor this beer on your tongue. The rye malts are a nice spicy touch giving this IPA a bit different flavor that's a welcome change from the norm.

A bouquet of hop scents, pine needles, lemon and a hint of mint.  I tasted mostly pine with some orange marmalade, sweet caramel malt, I couldn't detect any rye.  This beer is medium bodied with soft carbonation that reminded me of pop rocks and it has a long dry finish.  There is absolutely nothing bad to say about this one at all, it drinks easy for such a high abv, and I think the rye kind of starts coming through in the aftertaste.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

A. Beautifully clear amber to copper hue. Awesome creamy two-fingered head that left a nice lace.  S. Complex yeasty aroma that turned malty. You definitely notice some spice and then the hops. Wonderful stuff!  T. Big malt flavor...the yeast recedes a bit and you get some mix of baking spice (warmth) and a really nice bitter finish.  M. Lighter than I would've thought...leaves behind a mild syrup-like residue...a slight tackiness.  D. Its maybe good for a couple but the law of diminishing returns does affect this one.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Smell is a hoppy dream. Pineapple, pine, with grapefruit acidity. Creamy smooth flavor leads with the sweetness but then comes the rye notes and finishes with a long resiny hoppy bitterness Great creamy mouthfeel with dry finish Drinkability is tricky given this is really a DIPA at 8%. But the bomber really never stood a chance",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Avantyawn,4.63,"A: Deep ruby amber red. Beautiful thick creamy head, almost like a stout.  S: Creamy rich rye and slight citric overtures  T: Deliscious. This to me is a fusion of a red ale, an IPA, and an american stout. It fuses the elements masterfully. Smooth creamy initial flavor, then tart slight fruity bitter IPA effect. The rye adds a nice earthy backbone. Extremely flavorful. I've had this on tap and it's blown my mind. I've had this in a bomber and it was almost as good as on tap. In a 12 oz bottle is is still excellent, but it doesn't taste quite as sublime. Maybe it isn't as fresh as my previous tasting. Still, an amazing brew.  M: My favorite part of this beer is how is feels. It has a wonderful balance between bitter and sweet and the carbonation is very understated in an excellent manner.  D: Extremely high. Despite the 8 % APV, it goes down fast and furious. This is not a sipper, but a gulper! And watch out at 8 %!! The only thing holding it back from a 5 is that it is dangerous to drink too much of this! It is so smooth and flavorful!

S: If you where lost in a pine forest, and came across a log cabin from which you caught a whiff of freshly baked rye bread cooling on the window seal, you would have this beer.  T: Hops to the front and hops to the rear, with a sweet rye malt in the middle.  M: This beer is sticky on the tongue but the body is medium and the carbonation is ample.

T- This is like dating a really hot chick that later tells you later that she has turrets. Starts off great but goes down hill fast. great flavor up front with a hint of citrus blueberries. but the aftertaste is horrible. kinda like when you throw up in your mouth and then swallow. has that stomach acid taste.

Some lacing on the glass. OK carbonation. Like other Bear Republic beers, lots of floating sediment in the bottle.  S: I get malts and some piney/earthy hop aroma from this one. It doesn't jump out at you as much as I expected.  T: As some other reviewers mentioned, this has a solid malt base initially that leads to a good crisp hoppy bite at the finish. The hops are earthy. I also get bready yeast....sediment?  M: This is medium bodied with a crisp finish. Not too coating, but some chewiness.  D: 8% was hidden pretty well.

Deep clear red, brown-red. Strong head and nice lacing.  Smell was raisins, hops, and alcohol, in that order. Not great but maybe that's its age showing through.  Taste was hoppy and sweet, with a hint of rye and little backbone of malt. Quite tasty.  Felt really good in the mouth, nice and creamy.

610,3158,stakem,4.2,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a shaped pint glass. This brew appears a clear amber burnt copper color with a finger of yellowish stained head that is composed of large bubbles. A light swirl revives the cap and lacing sticks to the glass is stringy patches and spots.  The aroma of this brew is bold and hoppy with a scent of pine-like resins and some herbal quality that is lightly minty. There is a sweetness present that comes across a bit caramelized, floral and citrusy as well. The alcohol's presence is felt in the nose with a seemingly cooling effect and light astringency. As this brew warms more a citrus aspect of the hops come out.  The taste of this brew is modestly bitter upfront with a flavor of pine, herbs and grass. Through the body is a toasty malt quality that really accents the bitterness of this brew with a short lived type of light sweetness. The alcohol is readily apparent with a lightly solvent quality that pierces the hops and warms the back of the throat with every sip. Long, lingering clingy aftertaste of herbal and pine hops meld well with the toasted malt character inside the mouth. As this brew warms up, it picks up more of a citrus hop component that is lightly rind-like in it's bitterness and flavor somewhat reminiscent of grapefruit.  This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. The bold alcohol and toasted malt quality really made this brew stand out to me. I feel like an ass for seeing this beer on the shelf for more than 2 years now and always passed it by in favor or something new or different. This is a solid brew that I will be returning to again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Poured into a pint glass, has a very dark amber body with a finger of light tan head sitting on top. Couple minutes of retention lead to some nice lace spots.  Lots of spicy rye and hops (pine / citrus) in the nose, as well as a nice malt character. Lots of balance throughout in this IPA, certainly a burst of hops and rye right up front, but plenty of bready and sweet malts coming through as well. Fairly bitter and dry finish. Medium bodied with a nice carbonation level and even a bit of creaminess to it.  Im a bit perplexed on this beer. I like it, its quite tasty, but not sure Id consider it an American IPA - I thought it looked and tasted more like an American Amber or Rye. Given the choice, Id take a Racer 5 over this as far as IPAs go, but I will certainly be trying this ale again in the future.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

This is the best beer for the money I have had in ages. The alcohol is well hidden and this brew is so flavorful. How do they do it?? I would give it a 5 for drinkability, but the 8% would crush you after 2-3 of these. Get this and share it ONLY with truly worthy souls.  Thanks to Kyle (Southern Lights), my Binny's beer guy in Buffalo Grove for suggesting it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,sjverla,4.08,"Nose: Hoppy and spicy. Hints of molasses and alcohol. Faintly biscuity. Smells well-rounded. Nice play between sweet and spice.  Appearance: Super-rich ruby. Very dark, but clear. Not too much cream-colored head, but what rises is tight and looks nice. It does lace some, too.  Taste: Excellent balance. Great complexity. Well-mannered sweetness crossed the palate first. Then washed away by a strong, rich, roasty bitterness. Fades to assertive hop grassiness that lingers on. A slight alcohol tartness, but not much. Something like cinnamon raisin toast with a grass-fed, very sharp cheddar. Effervescent and lively feel compliments the ranging flavors. Peppery flavor lingers nicely.  Overall: Really solid beer. Awesome color, great flavor. Thanks to Weston.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,HopHed,4.3,"APPEARANCE: Clearly, I have failed! I drank this from the bottle, and did not think to pour it to get a look. Two lashings for me...  AROMA: A very noticeable tropical mango note, and a slight pine note as well.  FLAVOR: A definite grapefruit/grapefruit rind taste, with a back note of mango, and a sweet malty flavor, finishing with a piney finish.  PALATE: A medium bodied beer, with some hop bitterness. Not IPA hoppy, but noticeable.  MOUTH FEEL: A medium to moderately carbonated, almost watery beer. But don't let the liquidity of it fool you, this packs a great mouth feel, my guess is from the carbonation.  NOTES: An enjoyable medium carbonated 8.0% ABV beer that is a touch sweet, and very clean.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,livewire78,2.77,"Been looking forward to trying this one for a long time and thanks go out to sdawson for making it happen.  Brown and boring is how I'd describe it. No vibrant colors. Not opaque but bordering on it to a degree. Looks like a brown ale without the pretty brown head. Meh.  Average is the smell here. No overpowering hop aroma, no distinct malt presence, nothing great at all. A little faint spice (from the rye?) on the end but again, meh.  Since I consider myself an IPA guy, this one is below the average for the ones that I've had so hence, the score. The citrusy hops are muted, the malt just seems lazy, and the two in combination don't add up to anything spectacular. The only bright spot is the rye, which adds a spicy finish with sort of a peppery flavor. I wouldn't say it tasted bad, but it's not good. Sorta below average. Not even a meh. More like a blah.  Mouthfeel is nice and full. Carbonation level is right where I like it to be. Slick but not oily. Pretty good.  If this was the only craft at the bar, I'd have another one. But... I wouldn't seek this out again and that's too bad because for the most part I really like Bear Republic. I won't hold it against the brewery, but there are much better IPA's out there.

610,3158,cdkrenz,4.01,"A - Brown more than coppper with a head that would make any gal jelous. Quite mild in the visible carbonantion department. Find one and pour it.  S - Citrusy pine in the hop aroma area. Find one and smell it.  T - Dark, roasted... almost smokey flavor in this hop. A hint of tangerine begs for you to find one and taste it.  M - Very mild coarse feel in this specialty ale. It has a great texture. Very rare in this style and certainly a positive attribute. If I were you, I'd find one and feel it.  ~ The drinkability of ths brew ranks high among other IPAs. Mainly due to the character in the texture.

610,3158,Mancer,4.08,"This beer poured a hazy amber with a one finger high off-white head. The head dissipated to a thick and sticky lace that coated the top of the beer and the sides of the glass. Visible in the bottle and at the end of the pour was hop sediment. The initial smell of the beer was really something that I would find on a DIPA, heavy pine and citrus with a slight metallic zang. The initial taste of the beer was that of heavy resin, pine, citrus which lead to the rye notes and finished bitter and dry. The brew had a medium body with light to medium carbonation.  What really surprised me here was how this beer really performed like a DIPA. The flavors were bold and straight to the point. The body was very smooth and dessert like. Overall this was a nice beer and I'll have to check out the rest of the beers that Bear Republic has to offer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,DelMontiac,3.85,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a New Belgium globe.  Hop Rod Rye (cool label) pours hazy burnt orange creating a gently rising white two finger head of microbubbles that recedes to a thin blanket. Each drink is marked plainly on the glass in a fine lace.  This seems more malty than most IPAs, probably from the rye. The rye does seem to give it a somewhat woody/earthy extra spice (for lack of better terminology). Not near as piney as I would have thought. The citrus character is quite nice and remains from start to finish. Nice and malty with rye breadiness on the finish.  It's also more smooth and creamy than most IPAs. The carbonation is great - the smoothing kind, not the tongue tingling/burning kind. Nice.  All this makes for a very drinkable IPA. Hop Rod Rye is better warmed up a bit than it is straight from the fridge.  I think this brew is very good, but not great as the BA Top 50 would indicate (at this moment).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Strong aroma of molasses like malt, dust and citrus hops. Big rye flavor, robust and slightly burnt. Lots of hoppy bitterness that is long lasting. Quite sugary upfront. A touch of pineapple and grapefruit with a good amount of piney resin. Great rye/hop aftertaste. Medium/full body that is a little bit creamy.

The aroma of fresh herbal hops quickly followed. Maybe also a tinge of alcohol.  T - The citrusy hops and sweet bready malt comes through first. The bitterness from the hops became more apparent as it goes down. Dry and hoppy finish.  M - Medium bodied, texture was amazing. Could probably use a little more carbonation however.

Sweet hoppy aroma with a nice combination of sweet citrus, earthy pine, rye and caramel malt. Dank oilly fresh hops are bursting through with hints of pine needle, tropical and citrus fruit. Hints of grapefruit, pineapple and citrus peel countered by sweet rye and malt.  Chewy body that is much fuller than expected with a blast of bitter and sweet hop flavor up front that lingers throughout into a dry finish. Bitter earthy pine needle is countered by sweet tropical and citrus fruit notes as well as the sweet rye and malt backbone. Hints of pineapple, grapefruit and citrus peel counter the dry bitter character and are complimented excellently by the sweet rye and malt profile. There's also a creamy presence mid-palate that adds to the complexity and mouthfeel. Excellently balanced with a well masked ABV resulting in an extremely quaffable hop bomb.

M - Mouthfeel is a little fuller than other IPAs I've had. Not heavy, but a slight coating of the tongue, more just a smooth velvety feel.

I don't think I've had a beer that had this amount of grapefruit citrus in the nose. Very floral as well with some spicy rye and bread notes. Interesting and unique.  T - Taste is actually much more balanced than the nose. There are ample amounts of the rye and malts that add a nice chewiness to this beer. The hops emerge at the end of the beer with a vengeance though, and it's quite spicy and bitter. In fact, this beer is very damn bitter that grabs on tight with a grip that doesn't let go. Finish is long and bitter as hell.  M - Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Creamy smooth but with a hip bite that helps stagger the feel.  D - Drinkability is moderate.

610,3158,mewanderinghome,4.35,"Note that I do something perhaps a little different and compare each beer I review to a ""control"" beer of the same type that I am very familiar with, and which I drink at the same time. In this case of American IPAs, my control is Bell's Two Hearted.  Poured from 22oz bomber into standard pint glass. No date on bottle, but purchased within the last 2 weeks (normally I'd sample sooner, but I got a cold right after buying a bunch of brews I'd been wanting to compare).  A: Compared to Two Hearted, Hop Rod Rye is significantly more red- a full mahogany to Two Hearted's amber. It has more clarity (at least until you get to the bottom of the bomber). It has approximately the same amount of carbonation & head & similar lacing characteristics...all of which are typical of first-rate craft IPAs.  S: Significantly sweeter, less 'sharp,' citrusy-floral smell than Two Hearted. Hints of the rye and some sweet earthy breadiness. Excellent.  T: The citrus notes that some of the other reviews of this beer mention are indeed there, but they are not as pronounced as those in Two Hearted. More maltiness despite still reflecting a whole lot of hops (excellent balance). A little nutty even, in comparison to Two Hearted. I have always loved Two Hearted's flavor, from initial taste to aftertaste, but Hop Rod Rye manages to make Two Hearted's aftertaste seem ever so slightly soapy in comparison- something I've never noticed before...in short, Hop Rod Rye tastes awesome.  F: A little lighter mouthfeel, less creamy. The carbonation in both beers is more evident in the feel here, sparkling on the tongue.  D: Yup :) The only thing I can really mention is that I did start feeling quite bloated halfway through the bottle. Could be due to the slightly-higher-than-average carbonation of both beers or some reaction the yeasts were having with each other in my stomach during the taste test :)  P (Price): This is a category I feel is important. At my local store, the 22oz bomber of Hop Rod Rye is a very reasonable $3.79, and a 12oz single of Two Hearted is $1.79. 17 cents per ounce vs 15. Very close & both reasonable.  Overall: Thanks to previous reviews on BeerAdvocate, in only my 2nd official taste test I've found a very worthy competitor to Two Hearted. Maybe it's the newness of the find and my enthusiasm will dull over time, but for now I'd even venture to put it above Two Hearted..ever so slightly. Its characteristics make it seem especially well suited as an American IPA for the winter season.  UPDATE: The 2nd time I had it, I was less impressed. Not bad by any means, but it came off as quite a bit maltier and less balanced. Not going to change any of my numerical ratings because it may have sat longer on the store shelf or my taster might have been off.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,ncfrey,4.62,"Bomber purchased at DaveCo in Thornton, CO for $4.50, poured into New Belgium globe glass.  a - pours a crystal clear but fairly dark ruby-brown. Gorgeous color, but a fairly aggressive pour yields only a 1/2 finger off-white head with average retention. Leaves a thin, delicate lacing all down the glass.  s - very pleasing. Toffee, caramel, and that rye spiciness. Rather sticky but well-balanced by fruity, floral, spicy hops. This beer seems very fruity to me, with cherry and other dark fruits, citrus, and some other brighter fruitiness I assume is due to yeast esters.  t - possibly even better than the nose. Everything mentioned there is still present, but the rye spiciness is stronger than perceived in the aroma, and there's also strong toasted and faint roasted notes. The black cherry and rye flavors go great together. Hops come on strong throughout, and the finish is long, bitter, and boozy.  m - medium-bodied, fairly bubbly, and slightly astringent. Creamy, but not thick. Normally I like beers that feel a bit more... substantial than this one, but I think that the bright, aggressive palate lends itself well to this feel.  d - great, considering the ABV and the wealth of flavors. My stomach/tongue's tolerance would probably exceed my brain's.  I bought this one a whim, because it was cheap, because Bear Republic doesn't distribute in my home state of New Mexico, and because I tend to like rye beers.

Hops (piney and floral) are dominant in the flavor, if not a little overpowering. A bit of citrus and a subtle, spicey rye character can be picked up in the background. Extremely long, bitter hop finish. Medium bodied with fair carbonation. Alcohol is well-hidden.  The rye character definitely takes a backseat to the hops here. Didn't realize it was going to be such a balls-out DIPA when I ordered it, which might account for the comparatively low marks.

M - very thick, creamy, rich body for the style...helps hoist up the bitterness. because of this, it doesnt finish as dry as a lot of beers with similar profiles.

Aroma is of mostly floral hops, with grapefruit and some bready malt. Good but not a departure from many other IPA's out there. Tastes of bitter hops, with the bitterness especially coming out in the end. Some bready malt balances very well with the hops, and the rye adds a wonderful spicy taste. Very well balanced.

610,3158,AlCaponeJunior,3.51,"Dark amber. Clear. Great head and lacing. Excellent appearance.  Smells piney and citrus/grapefruity with plenty of malts and bread crust on the side. I would say the hops take center stage, followed by malts, with an extra side portion of very bitter hops and plenty of citrus pungency. Garnished with floral aromas, bread crust, and notable alcohol.  The bitterness and malts don't seem to mesh as well as I was expecting. Everyone loves this beer but it didn't quite do it for me. It seems to clash some, as if it can't decide what it's supposed to be. I think there was a pretty darn good rye beer under there somewhere. Halfway through the bomber I was wishing it was just a simple red or rye beer so I could get on with drinking the rest of the bottle without further angst.  Tastes to me like a great red or rye beer that's been over-hopped to the point of being forced to classify it as an IPA or DIPA.  It's rich, medium bodied, slightly sticky on the lips and amply carbonated.  Honestly, I won't seek it out again. I'm not sure what the big deal was on this one.

610,3158,beagle75,4.36,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass.  A: Clear, medium reddish-brown color with one finger of off-white foam head featuring an interesting assortment of variously-sized bubbles. Heavy lacing remains, leaving visible relief on the inside of the glass.  S: Pungent grapefruit citrus is featured prominently, becoming more floral over time. Caramel notes offer a darker side to the smell, also suggesting sweetness to come. No alcohol is detected in the smell.  T: Begins off-dry, with toffee and bready umami, accompanied by pine and dark citrus hop aromatics. Spicy, drying rye emerges to mark the transition into a middle that remains hops-laden. This beer finishes surprisingly mellow--bitter, but not destructively so. Acidity is pitch-perfect throughout, enhancing the overall experience. No alcohol is detected in the flavor.  M: Medium viscosity, syrupy and sticky on the palate, with low carbonation. Again, the acidity level could not be more appropriate and appealing.  D: Perhaps craft brewing's most famous rye beer, this is truly a delightful and robust DIPA that gets almost everything right. Even small details, like acidity, are executed in such a way as to make this beer more than the sum of its parts. While Bear Republic dabbles with other DIPA recipes (Racer X, for example) there is little point in trying to outshine this beer as it is when served from the bottle. In fact, this is one of those beers that seems to benefit from a little time spent in the bottle. Hop Rod was my draft selection during my sole visit to the company brewpub in Healdsburg and I found it to be be overly spicy--a sensory mix of capsaicin and volatile herbs--due either, or perhaps jointly, to the rye or the eye-watering freshness of the hops. Either way, the imbalance I experienced in the draft pour at the source does not typically carry through to the bottled brew reviewed here.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,alcstradamus,4.33,"Pours a mahogany color with two fingers of foamy head and webs of lacing.  The aroma is bready, citrusy, and slightly nutty. Subtle and very nice.  The flavor is a stellar blend of pine, citrus, and rye bread.  The body is medium and carbonation is low. Slick mouthfeel rather than sticky.  Overall this beer is a great example of its style, and one that stands out as being well crafted with no flaws. Will it knock your socks off? Probably not, but it will go perfect with some hamburgers and good conversation.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,rembrant,4.2,"Appearence is a cloudy amber/orange with a good frothy head about 1 finger and rather durable.  Aroma features some caramel and fruit in the nose with hints of grain or biscuit,and a whif of piney woods.  Taste leads with the citric hops mainly grapefruit. The maltside is lurking and leaves some flickers of sweetness. As it warms,it gets a little more diverse on the hop side and some rye/spice notes emerge with an overall increased flavor presence.  In short...tastes real nice.  Mouth is quite good for the type. Drinkability? Yes, this is a category where drinkability is major. The Malt bill is busy mostly keeping the hops from going too bitter while letting them bring big flavors. Hop Rod is just a bit different from the mainstream IPA varints,which gives it a good niche.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Agold,4.18,"Hop rod has a really nice amber garnet color with a half inch of off white head which has great staying power and leaves nice lacing all the way down the glass. Unfortunately there were little hop floaties in it, otherwise it was perfect. The citrus hops are very prominent and dominant in the nose with floral hops and a crisp biscuit maltyness filling out the nose. The taste is ofcitrus hops, with a bit of a bitter bite, but a definite caramel malt profile and spicy rye. Mouthfeel is great with good light carbonation and medium body.  Great IPA with a great malty presence which I wouldn't mistake for balance. But this goes down really nice and is a great IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,DrinkingDrake,4.2,"Pours a dark brown with a big red hue. Nice off-white head that leaves a ring around the edges with some big puddles of foam.  Smells of sweet caramel with a slight tang that comes from the rye. Fresh orange citrus hops. A lot of candied fruit like melon and mild oranges. A very juicy bubblegum. There is a large amount of subdued citrus hops.  Tastes sweet and malty with a lot of mild fruity bitterness. Dew melon. Again, very juicy with an amazing pine/orange-citrus hop profile. The hops really stick out in the aftertaste. The bitterness is nowhere to be found until you swallow. Then it hits you but like a ninja it drops in. It has a very mellow mellow, fruity and dry finish. For the amount of hops and bitterness it leaves it goes down pretty quickly. I served it in the mid 40s and as I drank the hop definition became intense.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ztaylor1,4.37,"Appearance- dark amber/brown with a beautiful off white head. Brilliantly hazy.  Smell- hops galore. Citrus rind, a hint of pine, and some very faint spicy malt.  Taste- fantasticly hoppy and sweet. Bright flowery and citrusy notes with a spiciness that I'm assuming is from the rye. Nice and bready.  Mouthfeel- medium to thin body. Notthing too extravagant, but just right for the style.  Drinkability- fantastic finish leaves me longing for more!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,sbauer,4.45,"22oz  A: Dark amber-red and brown. Light lacing.  S: Great fresh hop aroma. Floral citrus, dark cherry, bread.

D: Very drinkable and delicious super-hopped rye IPA. Amazing rye flavors balanced with strong hops.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Hamsteroceros,4.97,"22 oz bottle poured into Sierra Nevada tulip glass.  A- Deep, deep reddish amber color that I wish more IPAs could pull off. Decent head that left moderate lacing.  S- Everything I love about West Coast IPAs is here: grapefruit/citrus, zesty, piney. The rye cuts in nicely as well.  T- Just incredible. Bitter then sweet, bold yet balanced. The malt sneaks in late more as the beer warms. That tangy rye bite I was hoping for balances the rest really, really nicely.  M- In general, I find the major drawback to a good IPA is a lingering astringent/acidic ""stripping"" in the mouth. It seems like the better a beer tastes, the more pronounced this effect. With all the huge flavors in Hop Rod Rye, I was expecting that here but NO! This beer is so clean and smooth on the finish.  D- I am thrilled that this is a year-round release. I will have many, many more of these.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,DeanMoriarty,4.25,"Had this on draft at the Chowder House in Point Arena, Ca for $3.00 served in a pint glass.  A: Pours a deep brown/cherry hue with an insane head that sticks around for a while, leaving a thick coat of lace in my glass from start to finish.  S: Roasted grain, sweet chocolate malt, earthy moss, and burnt biscuits. Solid but wish there was a greater hop presence (I was drinking Eel River IPA just before this one and there is no comparison in hoppiness).  T: Similar to the nose in every aspect except that the hop presence is much more prevalent - resinous moss and earthy flavors. The rye is very noticeable as well. Finishes and ends with oily hoppy goodness like a proper IPA should.  M: Medium-bodied but on its way to being full-bodied, very clean and dry, the carbonation is perfect for the style and there is a major lingering oily bitterness from the hops.  D: A very drinkable IPA, but the heaviness of it gets to me after a couple. Not one I would post up on all night, but good for a couple no doubt.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

S - Fresh. West coast IPA hops. Fuckin' awesome. Malt there too.  T - Hops, rye, orange zest. Delicious. Sooo fresh tasting. I'm amazed.  M - Medium bodied. Perfect carbonation. Dry as ever.  D - Drinkable. Oh man. Delicious. Definitely more of an IPA than a rye beer though. So fresh. I can't get over the freshness of the beers that Bear Republic puts out. They and Green Flash really have a rivalry going in that area and it's great for beer. Bear Republic's beers are as young a beer as you'll ever try. Everything put into it wasn't harvested too long ago.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Chincino,4.32,"I had this beer for the first time the other day and I really enjoyed it.  It poured to be a dark amber color/mahogany color. It smelled slightly of citrus and you could definitely smell rye as well. Slight bitterness, smooth.  The alcohol was well-hidden in this beer and I could drink more than one in a sitting. Great beer!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,jtk,3.98,"A: Deep, dark amber. Smallish head that disappeared rather quickly.  S: I could smell the hops big time. Chocolate smell, too.  T: Big malt and hops together. Not super complex, but real tasty . Bitter finish. Sort of a hopped up stout, but the stout aspect was a little thin.  MF: Good, medium body with medium carbonation.  D: Smooth but bitter ending. Fairly easy to drink, especially considering the ABV. A good one to pick up here and there. Curious how it tastes on tap. I think I was definitely getting some bottle type of tastes that may have not been true to its real taste.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Chaney,4.23,"22oz. bottle poured into my gigantic Dogfish Head snifter.  A: The liquid itself (as it was coming out of the bottle) was a dark, almost burnt brown color, but when the glass collected it, it turned into a ruby red delight, with about a 3-4 finger beige head the quickly melded into a sudsy foam.  S: Hop, citrusy bitterness for sure, but the rye added a tinge of licorice to the hop bomb. A bit of candy sweetness came through nicely.  T: Whenever I took a generous drink and held it, I actually got some chocolate notes. Oh, and there's bitter hoppiness.... almost the sort of astringent bitterness I commonly find in a wet-hopped brew. As the marketing-speak on the bottle suggested, there was some sediment in the bottom due to lack of filtering.  M: Profound and gargantuan amount of bitter hops used in this puppy. However, carbonation aided tremendously in slicing and dicing the hops down the size. My glass looked like it went through a car wash without rinsing afterwards.  D: Uhhh... the bitterness stung, so for my tastes, I found this a bit overbearing. However, the brew as a whole was outstanding and definitely deserves its place among the big dog IPAs on the market. Bear Republic doesn't make a bad beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,dwilson01,4.35,"poured from a bomber into my arrogant bastard pint glass, the body comes out to a hazy maple sugar brown color topped by a splotchy tan to mocha creamy looking head. Nice fingers of lace are left at the dissipation.  The smell is very hop forward with not much underlying malt contribution. Orange peel, some spices like coriander and cinnamon come in to play a bit. Small amounts of bready grain type scents come out but it's subtle.  The flavors are mingling quite well for me, a citrus hop flavor comes through in the forefront. This is mixed in with a spicier hop flavor that is not super bitter but is just delicious. The malts come out to play in the flavor as well reminding me of a sweet honey pumpernickel rye bread.  The mouthfeel is awesome, I love the rye malt addition which gives it a small amount of dryness in the rear. But it's also full bodied just like the flavor. Great brew all around I highly recommend snagging one if you're into IPA's and want something a bit new.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,chicagoabbot,4.43,"22 oz chug into a large snifter. Color is almost like a barley wine, a deep dark amber. Head is not massive, but is fluffy and plenty. Aroma is fantastic, it has a big hoppy nose like an IPA but with that wonderful rye sharpness. Taste is bitter and sharp...if this wasn't such an incredible beer, I would be tempted to say the hops overbalance the malt, this beer is hoppier than most IPAs and as hoppy as many DIPAs. Alcohol hidden very well. Bear Republic has a big time winner here.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

It is sweet and bitter at the same time. There is sweet and roasty malts up front and then spicy rye and hops on the back end. What a great flavor!  M- good body, low carbonation.

610,3158,elgiacomo,3.97,"22oz bottle, unknown date.  Pours brown/red/copper with a one finger tan head that holds a light cap and leaves a good amount of spotty lacing.  Aroma is features a nice dose of that signature rye malt smell, bready, some caramel, some citrus and pine, good strength.  Flavor starts with resinous hops, some citrus and pine and a whole lotta spicy rye malt along with caramel and dark bread. Some Amber Ale-like qualities. Moderate sweetness, fair bitterness, although it doesn't feel even close to 90 IBU.  Mouthfeel is medium to almost full, somewhat creamy, medium carbonation.  Love the rye malt in this one, one of the better rye beers I've had but was a little disappointed in the level of hopiness, but this may be an older bottle... Still, very glad to get a chance to try this!  Oh, and I have to wonder about the style classification here. This doesn't belong in Rye Beer?

More of that bourbon-vanilla flavor, but not overpoweringly boozy.  M - Bubbly and full, neither overly crisp nor oily and heavy.

The mouthfeel is full-bodied with an amazing creaminess and the perfect level of carbonation. The most dominant flavours are sweet and sour citrus mixed with malts and lots of hops. There is also a dark fruit flavour, perhaps plums or cherries. Other flavours include caramel, chocolate, and rye. The beer finishes with a bitter sweet caramel hop aftertaste.

610,3158,Cheesemoose,4.36,"Poured from a bomber into one of my favorite snifters.  Nice frothy head forms with a solid 3 fingers of head That dissipates slowly. Mahogany to deep amber body with an off white head. Healthy amount of lacing that stays around throughout..  Big hop aroma, citrusy, piney, close to grapefruit. Malt aroma is mildly sweet, though the hop load is rather large, so much it is hard to balance. Rye is a distant subnote, rather indistinguishable to the rest of the smell.  Cold beer results in a big hop bite with a mild malt background. Though as it warms, the malt becomes more of a presence. Citrus hops play off a mild caramel malt base that slides along the tongue. Rye spice notes warm as the beer does. With out a doubt, for a DIPA, one of the more complex.  Creamy, smooth, refreshing mouthfeel. So nice and mellow, it is ridiculous. This has to be my favorite in the style so far. As for the abv, it is high, so stick with oen bomber for the night. Alcohol is nonexistant in the mouth, nose, but not in your head.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Taste: A lot of citrus and a bit of spiciness from the rye up front. A good deal of piney and floral hops on the back end. Fairly bitter finish. A pretty sweet taste overall.

I think to call this beer an Amerian IPA is why the BJCP doesn't work very well. I rated this beer upon whether I liked it or not, not to the style.  Pours darker brown with a light brown head. Average clarity. not the greatest head retention but nice lacing on the glass.  smells really good. I totally smell rye malt, and notes or caramel as well. And a dash of American hops along with a bitter smell. I feel like I remeber it having more of a hoppy citrusy smell, which may mean this is a older bottle.  good maltiness for an IPA. Heavy handed bitterness and ABV. I do find the smell more appatizing than the flavors. There is a distinct ethinol flavor, I usually don't expect that in IPAs. I really wish I knew the born on date, it would really help me figure this beer out. Flavors more like a rye barley wine.  pretty full mouthfeel. not to syrupy even thought its a high abv malty beer.

610,3158,CHickman,4.13,"Pours reddish brown in color with a 2 finger foamy beige/tan head that lasted a while and left great lacing and a creamy ring around the top of the glass; the lacing didn't move unless a sip of beer flowed over it.  Smells of big hops up front, with piney hops, citrus hops, grapefruit, sweet malt, orange peel, coriander, pepper, cinnamon, grass, hay, apple and some wheat; very pungent hop aroma that was surprising to me nice since I was expecting more rye.  Tastes of piney hops, citrus hops, grapefruit, sweet malt, orange peel, coriander, caramel, brown sugar, pepper, cinnamon, grass, hay, tart apple, flowers, rye, spices and what seems like syrup towards the end; really hoppy overall with the rye coating the tongue after the other flavors wash away. This is a different kind of IPA and I like it and its light spicy approach. The sweetness and the sharp rye spice leave a clean yet almost fruity flavor lingering and make for a nice niche IPA.  Mouthfeel is creamy and very smooth, with very light to no carbonation, a medium body and a snappy tart finish that screams of the rye. There are hints of alcohol, but they are so mild that it's not a distraction.  Very tasty and quite drinkable, especially for IPA fans who like a mix of malt and other ingredients like rye with their hops.

I would buy again to share again with some friends that enjoy the IPAs for sure.  I purchased this since I have an upcoming homebrew that I'm going to incorporate rye into and was looking to see how the 18% rye level impacted the taste. Definitely has a more intense hop flavor than I hoped for (My fault for not seeing the Rye IPA part when I bought this on a whim). Pretty highly hopped beer so it was difficult to ascertain the impact of the 18% rye vs say 10%.

The taste at first is a nice hop explosion that is mixed with the sweetness from the malts, you taste the rye more that what you can smell. The balance is somehow off here though. There too much sticky bitter hops in the finish for my liking. I would rather nave the spicy/bitterness from the rye and hop aroma in my rye ales personally. The mouthfeel is just too abrasive for my taste. Adequate carbonation.  Overall this may be a good beer but it is just slightly unbalanced for my liking. Definitely bitter, spicy and really hoppy.

I didn't notice any alcohol on the finish---the abv is 8%, not exactly a lightweight. The brew is very well made, but I found myself not getting past the rye spice flavors.

There was an initial finger of light brown colored head with a fairly aggressive pour, but it recedes quickly, leaving a little bit of light lacing.  Nose is fresh pine, with a nice lemongrass herbal note. A bit of malt detected as well. Floral qualities come out as the beer warmed, though I can't put a name to the flower I think it smells similar to. However, the nose wasn't quite as strong as I expected, especially compared to a Racer 5.  Taste followed the nose initially, with a decent piney and citrus flavor as it hits the tongue. A nice bread malt sweetness midtongue joins the bitterness and finishes fairly dry and clean.  The carbonation is light, but decent, with small bubbles. Medium body results in a slightly syrupy but substantial beer in the mouth.

Aroma is sweet malts, rye(of course), dark fruits, and a hint of resinous, pine-y hops. Not very hop forward so this may be a touch aged. Tastes like a rye ale with a biting bitter back end. Bit of grapefruit and floral-ness lingers on the back of my tongue. Mouthfeel is great. Not super drinkable as I think the bitterness has ruined my palate after only one and I consider myself fond of hop forward brews.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Phelps,3.95,"A: Pours a deep maroon that's dark yet clear, with oodles of floating flakes. A one-finger, thick head of khaki foam quickly becomes a hefty top layer, never really leaving completely. It leaves full, tacky sheets of lace as I drink.  S: Skittles! Citrusy and super-sweet, I'm picking up notes of tangerines, orange juice, strawberry, orange blossom, lilac and lime.  T: Again, lime skittles. Taste the rainbow! Dank hops hit at the start, expanding to bitter notes that linger and grip the sides of the tongue. Mid-palate I get hints of toasted crackers, spicy pepper and rye, while flavors of orange and grapefruit peel linger at the finish. Pretty sweet throughout.  M: medium-high, prickly carbonation tickles the tongue amidst a medium-light and slightly runny body.  D: Hop Rod Rye strikes a lovely balance between sweetness and bitterness. It's very drinkable and interesting enough to keep you pondering while you do.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,chalsk,4.22,"Pours a dark amber, almost brownish color with a white soapy head. Has an aroma of grapefruit and caramel with hints of pine and rye. Sweet and malty, with a nice hop hit and more sweetness on the backend. Just delicious.

Has a great heavy, fruity,dried fruit hop flavor. sweet notes start in the middle and continue through the finish.  MF- nice mouth coating with med. Body.

610,3158,jbowers56,4.08,"Lovely red colour with a cream coloured head that just sits there. Plenty of lacing. Super clear despite being unfiltered.  Nose is good, but I think its a few months old so lacking some pungency. I get grapefruit, pine, some leafiness, and also some slight rye notes.  A little maltier than I expected. First off I get a strong caramel malt presence. This is immediately backed up by grapefruit taking my tongue for a ride. Bitterness is definitely up there. The alcohol content is NOWHERE to be seen. Loving the rye in there. As a rye noob it reminds me of rye whiskey which I love.  Feels great in the mouth. Super creamy but adequate carbonation and a great hop presence clean it up sufficiently.  Drinkability would be higher, i think, if this were a little fresher. Some of the pungency of the hops is missing. Its all still there but a really strong juicy hop flavour would help make this more enticing to sip on. Brewed in april.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,Siegmund,4.43,"Poured from a bottle into a SAPP  It didn't pick up as great of a head as I'd like, but it was there. same with the lacing. The glass had been through the dishwasher once or twice, so it might not be the beers fault. It has a beautiful color, a deep coper with just a hint of mustyness. It kinda smelled like a typical IPA, but the rye in the taste makes it stand apart. I'm not sure exactly how to describe it but I've already purchased another Rye IPA to try (Founders). The high ABV is hidden well, so I could drink this all night.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,keith712,4.8,"Poured from a 22oz bomber bottle into a 1.5l hefeweizen glass that promotes head retention due to scoring along the sides and bottom to create nucleation points for the CO2.  Appearance: Pours a deep, almost scotch like color. A HUGE head was presented that hung around a bit and stayed a solid 1/2"" thick throughout the glass. This is a simply beautiful beer!  Nose: Spicy, pungent, crisp, sharp, powerful. Hops, hops, and some mild grapefruit and pine notes. Typical to me perhaps for a strong IPA, I really don't smell the rye malts.  Flavor: WOW! What can I say, not super complex, but it has EVERYTHING I want in an IPA, the rye malts are noticeably different and add a certain punch that is hard to define. Fairly dry, high carbonation, and crazy crisp.This is a ""turbo hops"" beer that might be a bit overpowering to an IPA n00b.  Mouth feel: Superb. Medium feel, high carbonation, begs for another mouth full! (easy on the jokes fellas). Crisp on the palate, pungent on the cheeks, and it makes my mouth happy. It thickens a bit as it warms and the flavors do become more pronounced, certainly a sign of a wonderful beer.  Drinkability: Can I have another? The alcohol at 8% is well hidden and I could down these easily in a session with friends, although by the terminology of a ""session"" beer...you are going to be quite high by the time you drink 3-4 of these. What else to say, it goes down easily and the flavor makes you want more, more, more.    Overall: I give this IPA an easy 9.5 of 10 points. Simply a superb beer.  EDIT: 12-28-10, drank another full bomber of this beer. Simply wonderful. Huge fluffy and creamy head that lasts, nice change of pace for a good IPA, the rye is awesome, the flavor gets better as you go through the glass and smooths nicely as it approaches 55+ degrees. I am going to make this a mainstay.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Briken,4.4,Hazy brown with big tan foamy/frothy head with great retention and good lacing all though it became a little spotty and clumpy. Robust rye and citrus hop aroma. Balanced rye and grapefruit with caramel sweetness in the background and a nice rye bread linger. No alcohol in taste and a mouthfeel that is very smooth and silky with a light stickiness on the lips.  Very simple yet completely engaging with a bit of different flavor in the rye. It has fantastic consistency to make it an easy and pleasureable beer experience.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

It pours a deep amber color with a thin off-white head.  Smell is heavy on the citrus (grapefruit and orange), hops, and rye malt.  Taste is of sweet malts as well as the citrus flavors that were also evident in the nose. Overall, an awesome tasting beer that I will buy again.  Medium body and very smooth feel. Light to moderate carbonation.

I decided to try something new. I was very pleased with my choice, the beer had a lot of hop flavor, but it didn't beat you over the head with the hops.

610,3158,bound4er,3.66,"A. Dark amber to ruby with an off-white head. The head sets up nicely and stays with the beer in a skim until the end.  S. Not as expressive as I thought it would be - some grain and grassy hops. The rye pokes through with some coaxing along with some booze.  T. Initial malt flavors (bread and rye) and then a big hit of piney hops. The lingering bitterness from the hops leaves a strong impression on my palate.  M. Well carbonated with a light to medium body. Could use a bit more pizzaz in the mouth.  D. Goes down pretty easily. Though I love most hop-forward beers, the lingering bitterness is a bit too much for me here. I prefer Racer 5 to this by a long shot and if I need a rye fix, I have Founders Red's Rye at the ready.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,bohemiandonut,5,"A careful pour into a blasphemously chilled glass explodes with the densest, thickest cappuccino foam I've ever seen. The beer is ruby red mahogany with luminescent orange highlights.  I already know Bear Republic for some of the greatest IPA aromas in the world, but this takes the cake. Juicy candy grapefruit and orange dominate a subtle herbal/pine backdrop. As with Racer, sweetness teeters on the novelty with bubblegum, cotton candy, and powdered sugar on fried dough. Just the kindest hint of spicy rye is noticeable on this level.  Rye is more noticeable on the taste, rounding out the bitter hops and sweetness with its distinctive savor. The rye also adds a welcome bit of fullness to the Racer 5 profile, which was prone to the occasional metallic twang. This is a smoooth drinking beer, rich and creamy but not sticky. At $4 a bomber, this makes its way onto my top shelf. A helluva an IPA with as much to ponder as anything oaked, barreled, or double malted. Absolutely worthy of its place. Incredible.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Hints of apricot and pear, with sweet malt.  Smooth, with sweet malt, citrus hops, slight spice on the tongue, and a pleasant astringency that eases its way onto the back of the tongue. Some evergreen notes as well toward the top of the mouth help finish off this well balanced IPA.  Mouthfeel is smooth, slightly dry and not too thin.

A touch of thin veils of lacing remain on the glass as I drink it.  S- Damn, good hoppy profile to it, but not to be outdone is a slightly sweet and roasted malt background. Very intriguing to say the least.  T- Very similar to the smell although the malts really take a backseat here. Good amounts of citrusy and floral hops take over, simply demolishing my tongue with its bitterness. The rye does play a role here providing a bit of graininess to it. Very tasty.  M- Slightly carbonated, medium body. Very smooth.  D- Easily drinkable. The bomber was no problem to finish off. I still fail to see how this is an IPA.

610,3158,carolinabeerguy,4.43,"I had this on tap at the Taphouse Grill at Ghent in Norfolk, VA on Saturday.  Appearance: Pours a deep caramel brown with ruby highlights and a 2 finger foamy off-white head. Excellent head retention and lacing.  Smell: Caramel malt and citrus hops.  Taste: Caramel malt up front followed by citrus hops in the middle and bitter rye at the finish. Nice bitter aftertaste. Absolutely delicious.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. You could knock back a few of these over the course of an evening.  Overall: Probably the best IPA I've ever tasted. I just wish we could get it down here in Florida. This would be my go to beer. If you see it, try it.

The color was rich and brown with a thick head. The aroma had lots of citrus and somewhat of a creamy buttery-ness that I enjoyed.  The flavor was of roasted malt and not nearly as bitter on the palate as I assumed it would be based on the aroma. There was some bitterness on the initial taste, but a creaminess washes it away leaving you with a rich, roasted malty flavor that slightly bordered on chocolate.  This beer has an excellent mouth feel and and is very drinkable. I loved it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Big floral, piney hop aroma wiht a hint of orange citrus. Medium body, very smooth feel. A brief sweet malty flavor that is quickly overrun by hop flavor. However, the sett malt remains beneath the hop character throughout. Floral and piney hop flavors take over every available taste bud.

Smell: Mostly citric hop aroma. Mango, orange, and fresh fruit with toasty, bready sweet malt.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Starts out with a big citric hop flavor before the rye malts shine through with notes of rye spice and bread crust. The finish of the brew sticks around awhile on the palate. Very well balanced and refreshing. Mouthfeel is smooth as silk, nice carbonation and mild hop bitterness.  Drinkablility: I just love these hoppy rye brews. This one is very tasty and easy to drink.

Two fingers of soapy/rocky beige foam crests above the glass. Lasting retention, sticky tendrils of lace.  Super fresh pineapple, grapefruit, kumquat, and pine in the nose - big C-hops through and through. Light spicy background note as well...  Superbly balanced flavor profile, with a lovely sweet/spicy rye taste offsetting the hop bomb (which has primarily citrus, but also substantial evergreen and maybe a little tropical note) that is full of flavor without being overly bitter. Light caramel and somewhat toasty malt evens the score further. Slightly earthy finish with a touch of pepper and anise (reminiscent of a Sazerac).  Moderately carbonated, medium-light bodied, slightly oily mouthfeel.  Immense flavor without an equal measure of bitterness - not nearly as pine or hemp forward as a lot of NorCal IPAs, this has a superior balance.

Taste: Sharp hoppy bite that builds over a base of deep malts. These malts have a very roasted quality. The rye pulls through towards the middle/end of the tasting. Hop bite is slow to fade and remains through the aftertaste. Mouthfeel: Medium body with a good deal of hoppy slickness on the tongue. Drinkability: Not too heavy on the ABV.

610,3158,climax,4.7,"Hop Rod pours a deep caramel with ruby highlights. It was very cloudy with a floating haze and some scuba yeast particles. The large head was a very foamy mass which stuck around and had sinkholes in the middle. Lace was good, notching all the way down.  The nose was a fresh refreshing burst of citrus and mint grass hops. Toasty caramel was evident as the malt backbone, but never distracted from the showcase of hops.  The rye, which became evident in the nose as it warmed, was much more distinguishable in the flavor. Cocoa and caramel had a nice sweetness to add on to the roasty malt profile. The juicy grapefruit and floral punch of the hops may have outmatched the malt, but it had an excellent well-balanced enjoyable flavor. Awesome.  The body was medium and had a nice sticky feel. The carbonation was quite generous, giving a solid bite long into the lingering bitter dry/chalky finish. This is a fantastic beer, enough hop kick to be a real good IPA, and a hell of a good malt profile to make it a heavyweight of flavor.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

The smell of this beer is outrageous: citrus peel, honey dew melon rind, mint, pine, flowers, carmel and rye. The best thing about these smells is how distinct they are, you're not going to take a whiff of this beer and just say, ""this smells hoppy.""  First taste is smooth, crisp, full-of-everything-you-want-in-an-IPA. Really good balance between the bitterness of the hops and the malt, and as it warms the rye character starts to shine lending a spicy flavor to the palate.  Nice full mouth feel and drinks smooth for an 8% ABV beer.

610,3158,generallee,4.43,"Presentation: It was poured into from a 1pt 6oz brown bottle into a tulip glass. There is no noticeable ABV or freshness date on the label.  Appearance: From the pour I got a deep ruby red body with some carbonation and a tall light beige head. The head is thick and long lasting which makes for some think clingy lace patterns on the glass.  Smell: The aroma has deep lemon pith and lemon oil like hops with a touch of resiny pine like hops too. I am also getting rye bready and lots of roasted/toasted malt.  Taste/Palate: There is a heavy concentrated hit of resiny pine and citrus hops backed up by a deep solid hit of dark roasted grain, caramelized malt, raison like dark fruit and toasted rye bread. The ABV is fairly well hidden but does add a touch of sweetness and warmth to the overall character which is intense. The finish is long and full of hop bitterness that very slowly fades off the tongue. Under this I also pick up some mellow sweet alcohol and a hint of an almond like toasted note. It has a very deep and complex finish.  Notes: This is absolutely crazy, deep and complexly concentrated beer.

Lots of caramel and some brown sugar as well as well. Taste is similar to what I just described. Medium-full body, good feel and carbonation. A bit big to be truly drinkable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Lukafer,4.2,"Thanks to AlleyKatking for his generosity!  A slow pour yields a dark amber/light brown with about a fingers worth of dark red head. Smells are caramel malts, some raisins, hops and rye. I taste rye right off the bat, hoppy, sweet but balanced, very good. The malt backbone remind me of a barleywine, but the spiciness of the rye and hoppiness make this a really unique version of an American IPA. Mouthfeel is full bodied and sticky. Drinkability is high with this, so glad I got a bomber and not a 12 ouncer, would defintely drink if they disributed to Indiana.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,metter98,4.3,A: The beer is slightly hazy amber in color and poured with a thin off white head that has good head retention properties and never completely faded away. A medium amount of carbonation is visible. S: There are strong aromas of grapefruit and piney hops in the nose along with some notes of rye. T: Flavors of piney hops really stand out in the taste and finish. There is a mild to moderate amount of bitterness that isn't overpowering due to a good balance between the malt and hops. M: It feels medium-bodied and smooth on the palate with a medium amount of carbonation. D: The alcohol is masked rather well so this beer is easy to drink.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,CONOR8832,3.67,"A - Nice thick froathy tan head, dark copper in color with some redish ruby tones, not a clear beer, there are a bit of hop remenents that settle at the bottom of the glass, so you can expect a nice hoppy beer.  S - Sweet malty/carmel notes, followed up with nice earthy pine smell with a splash of citrus, mild and faded rye scent, it is there but you almost have to go searching for it.  T - Nice hop expolosion at first mixed wtih the sweetness from the malts, you taste the rye more that what you can smell, it is a good comibination of rye and hops, and the alcohol taste is present.  M - Good carbination that stays with the beer, to which acts as a trasnport for all the armomas and flavors this beer offers. IMO a little on the heavy side.  D - This is an overall good hoppy beer, not one for the record books, however I do not think my palate has had enough training to get the full effects this beer has to offer. I had a hard time trying to figure out all the flavors that I was tasting and the aromas that I was smelling.

Head settles slowly to a bunch of sticky lace and a thin cap on top. Burnt orange brown in color with a good amount of haze.  S- a striking balance between rye malts and bold hops. Grapefruit and cut grass. Some spice and caramel.  T- rich and roasty rye malts with a ton of citrus and pine. Hops and malts bring each other to new and interesting levels. Long rye bread finish.

610,3158,Offa,4.11,"This is a very good, fairly complex beer that I have now had cask conditioned, in which form I like it better as usual.  Deep red amber, very clear and bright, with a small off-white head soon thinning to wispy top and foamy ring, leaving some nice, rich, even, foamy lace.  Aroma is grapefruit with candied citrus peel, very flowery, with some bread underneath. It's good, but a bit too one-dimensionally citrusy-grapefruity.  The taste is much better, more complex, balanced, and well-rounded. It has grapefruit, but also spicey candied citrus rind, rye bread element is light but very clearly noticeable, especially in the finish and aftertaste,, along with light winey fruitiness. The bitterness is spicy and just dominates the finish and aftertaste, lingering but with the other elements and character. It is fairly easy to drink but not extremely drinkable, reasonably light but a bit still too heavy and spicey to be truly easy to drink. The complexity and subtle notes really come through more from the cask, but the aroma from just smelling it is more subdued and not truly indicative of what is to come in actually drinking it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Kinsman,3.93,"Second Review: After my first review last week (see below), I wanted to try this again, but buying it from a different store to see if I could get a fresher bottle.  Appearance is about the same, but the aroma and taste have definitely been improved. I've found the ink used for their bottling date to be rather hard to read, but still I can see this one, a 12 oz bottle, was bottled on June 28, 2010. At two months, the hops are still plenty fresh. The rye still provides a slightly stronger malt presence than most all-barley malt IPA's but it compliments the hops well. Overall a very enjoyable beer thats even better when the hops are still noticeable.  Poured from 22oz bomber into glass  Dark amber body with red highlights capped by a super sticky light-ivory colored head. Light bubbles quickly work their way up along the walls of the glass as they feed into the head.  Moderate malt presence in the aroma, with the rye certainly contributing to this but also a solid caramel malt note. A slightly floral hop character starts to make its way through but was not as strong as I expected.  As with the aroma, the taste came across as more malty than expected. Caramel malts came through strong as well as a good bit of bread-like flavors. Where are the hops though? There is a nice bitterness but not nearly as floral or citrusy as the typical west coast IPA.  Mouthfeel was a bit on the heavy side but very smooth.  Overall a very drinkable beer that I absolutely enjoyed, especially the rye character. However, the hop character did not seem to match that of an IPA. It improved as the beer warmed, but at no point did the beer seem like an IPA.  I really wanted to give this beer a better review, but the aroma and taste did not match the style for me. Hopefully this was just an old bottle with faded hops, and I'll make sure to give this beer another try with fresher hops.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,vkv822,4.42,"12oz. bottle into tulip pint.  Pours a very attractive amber red, with a fair amount of light tan head. The nose is primarily of hops, giving resiny pine and grapefruit citrus notes. There are also sweet caramel malt notes as well. The rye does make an appearance, though it blends in quite well. This could be a good or bad thing depending on preference, as I would like to see the rye more pronounced, but am thankful it is not over-bearing. The taste is much along the lines of the aroma, with the caramel malts and pine and lightly citric hops upfront and rye following up and becoming quite a bit more present than in the aroma.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation, that is very active and but not distracting. I really enjoyed the blend of sweet malts, rye spice and pine hops that this beer offers, the use of rye really does make this a unique and memorable IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,DefenCorps,4.2,"I had this beer very early in my BA days and by my estimate, haven't had it in about 2-2.5 years. This review is way overdue.  Pouring a deep reddish brown with a dense light brown head with spectacular retention and excellent lacing, this is a beautiful beer. The nose is excellent as well. This has some of the characteristics I don't like my IPAs to have - a noticeable caramel and sugary sweetness, but the flavors around this really make it work. A prominent rye spiciness and a pronounced pine hop character are in harmony with the moderate sweetness that also has some brown sugar and toffee. However, the hops really do dominate, and this smells excellent.  The palate opens with a blend of caramel-like flavors - brown sugar, toffee and caramel - but not cloying on the palate. Along with it is a rather strong pine and candied grapefruit hop character with moderate bitterness and plenty of flavor. The rye comes in on the mid-palate with a pronounced spiciness that lingers into the finish. Moderately drying on the finish, this beer has a wonderful blend of toffee, rye and pine hops. The mouthfeel is quite sublime with a medium-light body and a soft carbonation, a level which really accentuates the good qualities of this beer. Excellent stuff, I'd drink a lot of this - if only I could find a bottled on date. Despite the moderately high ABV, this goes down very easily, and I will pick this up on a more regular basis.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Nice fruit kick with the hops, a real pleasure for the tounge.  Drinkabilty - Wow, what a great beer, this is not only a top 5 ipa for me, its simply one of the best beers ive drank.

610,3158,FreshHawk,4.43,"A - Deep coppery amber color with a huge, very thick, creamy, and frothy head. Amazing retention that finally settles into a thick creamy layer of lace.  S - Sweet toasted caramel malt with some lightly burnt sugar. Pretty strong hop aroma with a fair amount of pine and some grapefruit. Some earthy and grassy aroma as well. Rye is present but not really strong.  T - Fairly bitter tasting with a strong hop taste. There isn't a whole lot of fruity hop taste rather more pine, earthy, and some floral and grassy taste. Rye is present and has a bit of a spicy and bready flavor. As the beer warms a bit more citrus comes out (slightly more orange than grapefruit) also the hop bitterness balances out a bit more. Toasted caramel malt provides a nice background and comes out a bit stronger after warming. Some brown sugar taste also present. Fairly spicy overall.  M - On the lighter side of medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty smooth and a bit of a slick feel.  D - Much easier to drink as it warms up. To start it was a bit too bitter and hoppy for me and not quite balanced. Pretty drinkable overall though.  Notes: Bottled 05/10/10. Pretty good and interesting IPA. Spicy flavors come out pretty well. Also the fruity hop flavors are more hidden and just come out in a more subtle way and act as undertones. Enjoyable beer to drink, but probably not one to start someone out with if they are new to IPAs.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Bonis,4.41,"Appearance - By the time this one got to me, the head was almost gone but a thin layer remained. Looks almost like a brown ale, a little hazy though. Leaves a good lacing, common for the style.  Smell - This one smells awesome. Some citrusy resiny hops. I'm getting a lot of caramel malts, not what I normally smell in an IPA. I don't smell rye, then again that's not a familiar smell to me.  Taste - Reminds me of the smell. A strong citrus hop presence, but well balanced by a rich caramel malty taste. This is amazingly tasty at 8%. I don't get much alcohol at all, but the flavors do explode in your mouth. It's a really great tasting beer.  Mouthfeel - This is a full flavor blast in your mouth, what's not to like about the way that feels? Pretty crisp on the back end and the flavors linger for a while, which I like.  Drink - Well, this is a freakin intesne brew, so I wouldn't suggest trying to handle more than 2 or 3 of these in a night. I prefer to drink one at a time myself.

610,3158,cooncat,4,"Purchased as a single from Save-On in Mentor, OH. for $2.00/12 oz. bottle.  Poured into my S.A. glass at fridge temps, had to do a fairly hard pour to raise about a 1/2 inch beige head. The beer is a deep bronze/copper in color. Head dissapates rather quickly to a very thin cap, but some nice lacing developes as the beer is quaffed.  Hops up front in the nose, mostly citrus in nature. A bit of carmel makes it through the hops.  The taste is similar to the nose; hops are up front, with caramel in the background. The use of rye seems to add a bit of spice to the flavor, not usually found in other IPAs/DIPAs. Despite the 8% abv, no hint of alcohol is detected .. perhaps just a little warming in the tummy. Mouthfeel is medium, with moderate carbonation helping here. (definitely not 'bitey' by being over-carbonated) Drinkability is better than expected, as this doesn't feel like an 8% ABV beer. It goes down very smooth, so I could see quaffing more than one of these in a session easily.  I've always enjoyed Bear Republic brews, and feel that they consistently put out a good product.

Aroma is of hops and bready malts, with perhaps a hint of rye - though that could just be power of suggestion. While the nose was good, the taste was phenomenal. What a wonderful flavor profile here - you've got a great malt backbone with the rye bringing a nice smoothness, and then the hops cutting through it all. Delicious.  The mouthfeel is superb as well.

T - Taste definitely doesn't have as much hops as expected. Malt comes through a lot. Caramel malts dominate, doesn't taste like what the color suggests, still tastes like a typical IPA malt-wise. Some rye comes through, but really not as much as I was expecting, still noticeable. The hops are mostly citrus staying constant the whole way through.

610,3158,AWolfAtTheDoor,4,"Why this is in the American IPA category, I'll never know. Apparently there aren't enough rye beers to have their own category?  This is the darkest ""IPA"" you will ever see. Dark copper that is fairly opaque. Reasonable lacing.  Lots of rye with a hint of sourness from the hops on the nose.  Like others have stated, incredibly smooth taste. But I think this is where the beer falls short. It has RYE right in the name, boasts of being made with ""18% Rye"" on the bottle.. yet the rye is overpowered by the hops. Overpowered is too strong of a word, I would say neutralized. To their credit, it is a balanced beer and quite drinkable, but I was hoping for more Rye. I live in california for christ' sake.

Yeast with some floral notes, and a hint of caramel.  T: Bitterly hoppy, but with a bit slightly sweet and robust malted flavor. Has almost an iced tea tone.  M: Bitter throughout. Almost to the extent that it shocks the palette on arrival, and lingers to the end. Dry.  D: A sipping beer. The hops demand it to be so.  Great atmosphere. The appearance is formidable and intimidating, and the nose is not complex but very full. Flavor, also not complex, but does it what it does well.

610,3158,Chizoad,4.31,"Picked up on a recommendation. I am glad I got the 4 pack, because this stuff is amazing.  Gave it a vigorous pour, and out came a caramel colored cloudy brew with a 2 finger head that left exquisite lacing. The head faded eventually to a thin layer on top.  Very muted smell, possibly because it was too cold at first. As I work my way through the 4 pack this number may be revised. Hop bitterness and quiet malts.  Wow, great hops up front, amazing malt and as it warms they come together perfectly. Many layers of flavor here that change over time. Not good enough to name what's going on, I just know that I love it.  Very low carbonation, and on the heavy side of medium body. I think a little more carbonation would be better, but maybe it would mess up the flavor. Still, it took some coaxing to bring out the bubbles. That said, it's amazingly drinkable and it could easily be sneaky 8% abv bottle after bottle through a session.  **Edit: the rest of the 4-pack was a little more carbonated than the first bottle I had. The mouthfeel improved to what can only be described as perfect, but I do think the flavor actually suffered just a tad.

Hop Rod Rye has the great grapefruit and floral hop aromas of American IPA's, but is made with rye, is darker than the standard, with a fuller mouthfeel and slightly higher alcohol content. The aroma is a very enticing combination of orange flower and grapefruit zest. The beer is a very nice juxtaposition of piney citrusy west coast hops with spicy rye The beer is thick, luxuriously coating the tongue with each swallow. This is a very good beer, but with the sweetness and 8% abv, it might be a bit much to handle",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ianmhall,4.51,"very excited to drink this one which i netted on a trip up to table and vine in west springfield, ma... i'm drinking this beer out of my trusty stemless bordeaux glass  Appearance- the beer pours with a great thick head creamy white it is very fluffy, very enticing even as it thins out, a beautiful lacing... this nectar is dark brown with orange and red highlights about 10% opacity  Nose- not overwhelming me at first maybe its a bit cold on the first sniff, there is some alcohol here but the nose as this elixer sits becomes quite the more daft. Sweet fruity yet earthy, caramelized pear, some light muddled citrus like a lemon cooking in mollasses, a bit spicy with big fruity esters-- some pecan pie, some stewing plum  Taste- like ayinger celebrator had a cousin who moved to California and became a celebrity after he starred in pineapple express... yes this beer is good, like gets better with each sip good, caramelly, toasty, and chocolaty with lots of spicy, pert hop flourish, every sip is a little different, there is tremendous depth to this beer... as a sit admiring the aftertaste i start to think of orange tootsie pops... seriously  Mouthfeel - balanced, and very pleasing (as long as you like a hop finish) dry, yet sweet the hop bite here unarms the any concern of a sometime cloying malty sweetness in brown ales like this...  Highly drinkable for lovers of big hoppy ales, quite imperial brown rye ale (IBRA) or (DRBA) doppelrye brown ale for me not that it matters overall better than i had thought at first sip this beer really gets better as you go, durn good...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,PantherLightning,4.42,"A - Poured a dark brown with hints of red with a one finger very light tan head. Excellent retention, and heavy lacing left in the glass.  S - Very hoppy, slight citrus, and maybe a hint of caramel or some other sweetness  T&M - Lots of crisp hops and dark, malty taste upfront. The rye comes through more heavily towards the finish with another burst of hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp.  D - This beer is excellent. I take a sip and taste slowly, but as soon as i savor the lingering aspects of the beer, I just want more. After the first time I had had it a while ago, I felt guilty drinking it, like I should be saving it for something special...but it's too damn good to do that.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,DrDemento456,4.4,Had to try this when I found out it was one of the top 100 beers. Found it for 7 bucks at D's six packs and Dogs.  A - A very nice dark amber with an inch of fluffy white head  S - Wow the rye in this beer is spicy. Also can smell quite a bit of hops which seems to be balanced well.  T - Very smooth. Really expected more hops but the rye really balanced the flavor leaving a malty bready taste. Really good.  M - Medium bodied and full of flavor.  D - Well I may have it again but I really didn't love it. Guess I will let others drink it.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Pittsburgh,4.5,"Re-review, had this a while ago and am now getting around to it for a second time. Nice bitter flavor, tastes like a red ale/IPA combo, very complex, easy drinking, has a fruity and sticky quality to it, yet it is very smooth and refreshing at the same time. Score stays the same for me, even after all the other beers I have tried in between, this one stand the test of time. All time great.  Overall, a solid beer, right on par with what I was expecting, which is an above average brew, never had a Bear Republic beer, but I am ready to try others.  Pour was very nice with an above average amount of foam that sticks around for a while and then settles down to a thin layer.  Hops, are excellent, nice pop, bitter, gets you in the back of the mouth, has a piney/fruity element as well, tasted fresh, full of flavor. Balanced with a alight bit of malt, to make it a pretty complex beer. Good from start to finish, the last sip with some sediment at the bottom was awesome.  I put this up there to go toe to toe with any IPA I've ever had...very solid. I will be getting this again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Very crisp grapefruit hops, slightly bready malts, definite rye ""spiciness"".  T - Caramel malt backbone with a lovely balance of grapefruit hops. More rye and pepper. Really well put together.  M - Amazingly smooth, crisp, and refreshing. Carbonation is spot-on. Medium bodied.  D - Ummm...where did my growler go?! Very drinkable, absolutely no hint of the 8% ABV. Amazing beer, definitely one of my favorites, and at around $5 a bomber its one of the best deals you can find.

610,3158,Riccymon,4.06,"Received as a gift.. I've wanted to try Hop Rod Rye for some time, but as a malt-head, I've always found something else to spend my beer dollars on.  Pours from the bomber an orangey-amber color with an assertive three fingers of head. Some lacing remains long after the pour, and a small cap of head never completely recedes. Very good looking beer. As for the aroma, this might be the most IPA-smelling IPA I've had. Right after the pour, the head, straining at the edge of the glass, holds a piney bouquet. I notice increasing citrus as the beer warms, particularly grapefruit.  When the beer was colder, I smelled and tasted some rye spiciness, but it's definitely secondary to the hops. Particularly noticeable is lemon and grapefruit hoppiness, and I really can't pick up the rye after having sipped for half an hour. At first, I couldn't pick out much in the way of malt either, but there's a small pocket of sweetness I observe when initially taking each sip. Unexpectedly, I noticed more alcohol when the beer was colder than I did after it warmed up. Hop Rod Rye presents a bitter mouthfeel in that post-swallow, the bitterness coats the mouth and tongue. While sipping, however, the beer drinks rather smoothly.  Hop Rod Rye was tasty as far as hop bombs go, and it seems well crafted. Although the ABV is on the high side, I didn't find this to be a messy, thrown-together brew. If I was a hop head, I think I'd return to this one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,eclaycamp,4.42,"22 ounce bomber. Pours a rich copper that reminds me of a new penny. Color aside, the head on this beer is quite impressive, huge and billowing with tons of lace that absolutely sticks to the sides of the glass. Aroma is fantastic, though a bit light. I get lots of pine with some notes of bread, most likely from the rye. Really love the depth that the rye adds to the taste, lending incredible balance to the beer. Caramel and bread up front, followed by a very enjoyable finish of light grapefruit. Little to no alcohol character, which is surprising given the ABV.

This is one of those beers that I've heard is good, and always see sitting on the shelves at the various beer stores around town, but that I have always walked by and thought, ""Oh, I'll try that sometime soon"" but keep passing up. Well that time has come...  A: pours a dark brown but fairly red when held up to the light. A vigorous pour yields a half finger light tan head that has sub-optimal retention but nice lacing.  S: Rye and nuts, but not a very aromatic beer.  T: As the name implies the rye really comes out in this beer and is quite good! For some reason it reminds me a lot of raison d'extra but without the big alcohol kick. Perhaps this is because this beer has flavors of plums/raisons in addition to the rye. There is a nice hop finish that balances out the sweetness that comes out up front.  M: Pretty good feel. Nice level of carbonation. Medium bodied.  D: Wonderfully drinkable. The alcohol in this beerl is hidden well, it's not overly sweet, and tastes great.

S - Very pungent pine/grapefruit upfront, sap, it's got a fresh soil & earthy quality to it that reminds me of a Winter Warmer. A bit of toast & biscuit underneath the pungent hops, ah there it is, just a touch of a bready rye like quality in there.  T - Very herbal with tons of orange peel and pungent tree sap like flavors everywhere! It finishes with pine & more peel, fresh oily hop flavors, there's a nice bready quality that comes through but nothing that immediately puts my mind to rye bread. Bitterness isn't over the top & makes an appearance as a lingering burnt bitterness on the back of the tongue, and this beer definitely doesn't taste like 8% ABV!  M - Smooth & creamy, soft crispness. Around medium-full bodied.  D - Such a great IPA, fresh herbal hop flavors with somewhat mild bitterness. I could definitely quaff 2-3 pints with some spicy & tangy ribs! I look forward to having this one again, highly recommended. Cheers!

610,3158,JosiahS,4.52,"Glass: Tulip  Color is a dark amber with a soapy, 1-finger head sitting atop. Lots of small splashes line the glass where beer once was.  This beer has an amazing resiny and herbal-like scent. Citrus fruit rind are also present. Beneath the hops, deep sugary, caramel malt is revealed.  Taste is approaching my opinion of a perfect IPA. It has a fresh or wet hop taste that can't be beat. Resiny and herbal hops along with the perfect amount of grapefruit and lemon rind bitterness. Malt is strong but so well-integrated that it's hard to distinguish one from another.  Mouthfeel is light and velvety with low to medium carbonation.  Drinkability is high.

610,3158,koopa,4.03,Had this one many times over the years but figured I'd review the sample I had on tap at the Copper Mine Pub in North Arlington NJ last Sunday.  Appearance: Pours a deep mahogany with a massive khaki crown that shows good retention and lace.  Smell: Loads of citrus and some faint pine notes from the hops plus plenty of rye goodness.  Taste: Same as nose.  Mouthfeel: On the heavy side of medium bodied with good carbonation.  Drinkability: Goes down pretty well despite the massive hopping and the 8% abv.

610,3158,hopsbreath,2.7,"Twelve ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. This is my third one in the past week, not because I particularly like it, but because I'm stuck with the four-pack I picked up.  The dark murky mahogany body has a lot of large particulate in suspension with a two finger crown of tan head sitting on top. Spotty lacing shows up throughout the drink.  Smell is the best part but seems like a big hoppy barleywine rather than an IPA. Big tropical fruits would dominate the nose were it not for the heavy malts intertwined throughout.  Tastes similar to a barleywine like I expected. Cloyingly sweet malt base has quite a bit of metallic bitter hops in conjunction. The spice I associate with rye is not really there. Why add the rye if its not going to star here? Not my favorite.  Mouthfeel is thick, syrupy, and sticky. Personal preference alert, but I prefer IPA's to have a thinner body.  Drinkability is on the low end. Big, heavy, and metallic just don't do it for me.  Like I said at the beginning of my review, I bought a whole 4-pack of this stuff and am now trying to drink through it although its taking over a week.

Been regularly drinking Stone IPA/Ruination, GF West Coast, Hop Ottin, Torpedo for many months and now back to my ""roots"".  A- A gentle pour reveals a fairly dark, opaque, muddy amber with a nice 1 finger head - still hanging in there 2/3 of the way thru. I can see each sip in the nice lacing.  S- I can smell caramelly malts/maybe rye? Not sure. Also definitely detecting the hops.  T- Definitely bitter right off the bat followed by a balanced but strong taste of malts, a little rye, and a lot of really bitter hops. A little alcohol at the end, but not enough to prevent you from wanting another sip. Deliciously bitter and hoppy, with a very strong malt backbone. The rye is subtle yet makes this absolutely not your run of the mill every day IPA.  M- Creamy, but not super heavy.  D- Too high. I remember having a 22 oz. bomber of this before a couple of other 7%+ IPA's (quite some time ago) and receiving a buzz that was more than necessary. Anywho.

Aroma: Heavy grapefruit notes with underlying piney notes. Carmael malts present themselves in a subtle yet bold way.  Taste: This one has quite the creamy mouthfeel. A caramel sweetness gives it a sticky coating on the pallate. Nice citrus notes with pineyness rounding it out.  Notes: A tasty offering from Bear Republic.

Taste: Bitter hop taste, but heavily mixed in with darker caramel malts. Hops have bite, but not the fresh flavor of the nose. The rye malts give it a kick as well. Alcohol is present, but not overwhelming. Long linger.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied. Tingly to start, with moderate carbonation, and a bit of an alcohol bite to finish.  Drinkability: A very interesting IPA, with the rye malts. Very fresh hoppy nose, with a more balanced taste. The rye gives it an interesting kick, unlike the hops which usually fuel this style. Hops in the taste or more subdued than I would like, but aren't overly harsh like others. A good one to try.  Buy Again? Yes.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

T- so bitter, yet so wonderful. Huge bursts of pine with the aftertaste of some light citrus. The first sip is a little overwhelming, but then it just turns into this sheer awesomeness of hops.  M- good feel. Its what I consider the perfect feel for an IPA...that happy medium being having a solid body without being too thick or too thin. Love it.  D- I don't know about this. Its a good gateway beer for novice hopheads, but could be considered a little weak for someone more experienced. I'm somewhere in the middle, so I really like it. Did I enjoy it more than Racer 5?

The citrus aromas that dominate the smell seem absent in the taste. IMO, this brew could use a bit more malt to balance out the bite of the bitter hops. I've seen this bottle for months at the liquor store, so maybe some of the taste has faded...  M - perfect mouthfeel for an ipa: not too thin, not too chewy, just the right amount of carbonation.  D - this is certainly a drinkable beer, limited only by the persistent bitterness of the hops upfront as well as in the finish.

Very smooth and enticing aroma that evolves as the beer warms to include some piney hops and bready malts. I can't wait to taste it, but just smelling it makes me happy.  T: I must admit, the term ""rye"" turned me off just a little (only because I'm not a big rye bread fan), but I wanted to try it because I like their Racer 5 so much... and I'm very glad I did. Sweet, spicy, and bready notes collide to create a well-rounded brew with an exceptionally smooth lingering hop flavor. A perfect hint of bitterness finishes things off, but the bread-like malts stop it just short of being overwhelming.  M: Very thick, which is well appreciated for the style. When I drink a full flavored ale, I want each sip to fill my mouth and be a new experience, and this beer does just that.  D: The 8% is hidden oh-so-well.

610,3158,HopNuggets,4.38,I've had this before but this one was thanks to Braleybbradford. Poured the bomber into a snifter.  A - Poured a deep brownish amber color with a 1 finger off-whte to tan head that dissipated to a slightly spotty covering. This one is unfiltered but I poured the first 3/4 of the bottle to not aggravate the sediment on the bottom. This bottle is a lot more filtered than the first one I tried that was very cloudy and chunky. As I peered into the bottom of the bottle there was a bit of sediment but not a solid covering on the bottom.  S - I get some different fruits due to the rye. There seems to be a pear and apple character to the nose that is a bit different but very nice. A bit of caramel or toffee malt to back the citrusy hops. As it warms the pine aroma is more prevalent ahead of the citrus.  T - Very balanced and quite excellent. You get a little pear upfront and a bite from the hops that if balanced quite nicely with some caramel malt followed by a nice bitterness and spiciness from the rye. There's a bit of a earthy aftertaste accompanied with a spiciness from the rye.  M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Goes down easy for the 8% ABV so watch out. There is a bit of a oily residue that hangs around from the aggressively hopped beer.  D - At 8% this one can do some damage as you can enjoy this one without thinking about what is going to happen after the bomber is gone.  Bear Republic produces some excellent beers but the consistency is not always there as this one was quite amazing as well as the first one that I had but they were a bit different. You know you will always get something very good but each batch will vary.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,emmasdad,4.37,"Another great beer from one of the best value breweries around. Pours a dark, reddish-amber color, with burgundy highlights and some generous foam. The nose is overload with fresh, juicy, resinous hops, which is the point, I suppose. Great hoppiness on the palate as well, as well as just a hint of the spicy rye. Dangerously drinkable. A four pack goes down way to easily.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Zekezilla,4.45,"I've never had a rye beer before, picked this up because I've really enjoyed Bear Republic offerings I've tried thus far. This was a great treat. Everything I'd expect from an American pale ale but also with delightful caramel/malty undertones. What a great combination. Beautiful orange/amber in color with lacing throughout.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,kwjd,4.45,"Pours a brownish-red colour with thick slight off-white head. This may be the darkest IPA I've seen, but looks really nice. Smells of citrus hops and caramel. Taste is first some bitterness with citrus and piney hops, with lots of sweetness of a caramel flavour. Not a huge hop monster, but incredibly well balanced. This is a great beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BabyBastard,4.44,"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle, this may be the darkest IPA that I have ever seen. Great looking shade of dark, hazy amber with tan head that has great retention. Surely not what one would expect an American IPA to look like, but Hop Rod does not leave one dissatisfied.  Smell is hugely citrus hop filled, pine resin notes and caramel maltiness comes through in the nose. This is one exceptional smelling brew. Truly for the hop head. If you can't handle the hoppiness, steer clear here.  Tastes like a big mouthfull of pungent, sticky, oily goodness. After that huge hop bite, this brew balances itself out with a subtle malt backbone that holds it all together. This could be the definition of a wonderfully balanced brew. According to me, that is. And what do I know? I just know this may be the perfect brew. Maybe.  Carbonation is spot on here, nothing less is expected from Bear Republic. Always top notch. Has that oily hop feel, very smooth and easy drinking. This one may sneak up and bite you in the ass if you don't watch it. Treading on the double IPA turf, this hop monster certainly satisfies those hop cravings. I'd say this is most likely the best American IPA out there. Just my humble opinion.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Jwale73,4.03,"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Poured a hazy, reddish-copper with a dense, one inch off-white head that settles into a thin, fairly consistent cap. Broken sheets of lacing are revealed during the tasting and exhibit excellent retention. Nose starts off as sweet and malty with toffee notes, followed by a citrus hops presence that follows closely behind; a faint metallic quality also comes out towards the back. Taste follows nose - some piny hops in the mix and just a very light bitterness reveals itself at the back and the metallic quality disappers. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation and just the slightest viscosity and a little residual alcohol heat. This is a very tasty brew that has a big malt profile and falls a little closer to an IIPA than a standard IPA. Very tasty and complex, but not something I would drink more than one or two of in a sitting.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,KickInTheChalice,4.65,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Wow, defining this as an IPA is somewhat deceptive. Hop rod rye has an amber brown color, thick bubbly head with good retention and tons of lace - this looks like a double IPA. As the label warned me, there is some light sediment toward the end of the glass due to the unfiltered nature of the beer.  Smell: Very balanced aroma with tons of tops; grapefruit and pineapple citrus hops, soft pine, and a light spiciness from the rye.  Taste: Again, balance is the word of the night. The rye is a nice touch, adding some spice up front. It starts sweet to kick start the flavor. Hops are present throughout, but this is not just a hop bomb. Peach, grapefruit, pineapple, floral, and sweet pine hops provide such a great counter to the spicy rye. It finishes spicy with a sweet bitter touch. Very unique and profound.  Mouthfeel: I am not sure if it is the rye or the carefully crafted nature of the beer, but there is a dryness that just puts the feel over the top. It stays grounded, never completely unleashing its strength, and there is enough carbonation to cause my mouth to tingle for a minute. Creamy, with just a little hop oil residue.  Drinkability: Oh Hop Rod Rye, you slay me. This is probably the best balanced IPA I have had. This will be a regular in my fridge, and I could drink it all night.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,andyfrancis,3.6,"Deep red-amber. Not much head to speak of, the little bit looks nice.  Smells like a glass full of hops.  Taste of bitter hops up front followed by a slow rumble of alcohol and rye.  Pretty hot for 8%. Not that 8% is anything to scoff at. Still, the booze is not trying to hide.  Worth a try. Probably not for everyone.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,akorsak,4.17,"Served at Al's of Hampden.  A: The IPA is very dark, many hues away from the standard copper color. This is more dark caramel, approaching brown ale territory. The pour seemingly lacks nitro, as the head was negligible at best.  S: The nose is hoppy, muted a bit (perhaps a little long in the tooth), but still heavy woth pine and citrus. The muted hops allow the rich carraway and spicy rye to shine though. And man, I love those rye beers.  T: Much like the nose, the hops are bold but not as bold as they could be. Piney citrus, oily and thick, can be avoided. Again, the rye stands out more than normal, adding a rich peppery spiciness that overtakes the hops mid-sip. The dark bread, emboldened, is chewy, with carraway spice livening it up. I really like that the rye is prominent. The bready finish incorporates the resiny hop bitterness that has been lingering throughout.  M: The IPA is spicy, not in the hot way but in a rich, dark bread way. The emphasis on rye presents a stark contrast to the sharp hops, allowing both to play off of each other.  D: A meal in the glass. Bitter hops, chewy malts. The ale can't avoid its booziness though, so strength is an issue (albeit minor).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,zoso1967,4.2,"Hop Rod Rye pours fairly deep amber with a copper hue. If this beer was wood, I would make a nice desk out of it. The head is parchment and minimal, but it has staying power and leaves nice lace. The aroma is of rye, sweet malt and pine. It also has a very estery fruitiness to it that I find quit unique. The flavor is a mix of pine, grapefruit, caramel malt and a touch of rye. Together they combine to create some interesting flavors that are very berry like. This is definitely a take no prisoners sort of beer, and while I am defiantly picking up what it's laying down, I wish there was more rye. A paltry complaint, but what can I say, I'm a rye whore. Also, the alcohol really shows through in the flavor, though the more I sip the more I think this just enhances the overall experience. The mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium and is well balanced with a nice spiky carbonation that works well in the overall package. Pretty drinkable for style (this is def a double IPA, not a single as indicated) and another fine offering from bear republic. If only they could calm down about the copyright lawsuits...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,wolfinthemirror,3.81,"Pours a really nice, translucent copper-brown color, much darker than the average IPA, i'd say. excellent lacing.  smells of sweet caramel malts up front with citrusy herbal hops in the background. pleasant, but maltier than i expected. there is a sort of toastiness to the malts.  Wow. Very good taste, but not what i'd expect from an IPA. This is really quite the malt bomb. I get a lot of the malt character that I detected in the smell and some smokiness with muted hop bittering towards middle and fading into the end. The feeling on the back of the tongue reminds me that it's an IPA. There's quite a bit going on here.  Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied. the malts really beef it up for this beer.  I think this is a sipper for me, a 12 oz bottle would be plenty, but I've got a bomber to finish. This definitely isn't the beer i'd go to when I wanted a good hoppy IPA, but if i wanted to something on the maltier side, it's a good choice.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,sweemzander,4.3,"22oz. bottle poured into an imperial pint. No bottled date.  (A) - Pours a hazy brown amber color that produced a good frothy tan head. It stuck around for awhile before dissipating; left some bits of lacing behind. A bit darker in color than your normal IPA, but it fits because of the rye addition.  (S)- A fresh burst of citrus: lemon, pineapple, and peach. It has a dryness to it at the same time with a light spice from the rye.  (T)- Again, a fresh citrus/hop kick with lemon, pineapple, and peach fruits. Has a light spiciness & sweetness that I appreciate that is like a caramel/bready maltiness.  (M)- A great carbonation level and balance. Has a good bitter yet citrusy hop bite that is well balanced by an adequate malty sweetness. Surprisingly crisp and smooth too; refreshing.  (D)- A superb IPA that is even better with the rye addition. It has everything that is great about the style with a lightly spicy rye bread/caramel sweetness. I could easily have 2-3 bombers of this if I wanted to. Great stuff.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Head is one-finger but sticky and lasting, leaving attractice lacing throughout. Nose is floral and earthy with some citrus (lemon, grapefruit) notes. Taste starts with some bitterness from the hops but moves to sweetness from the bready malts. Good carbonation. The Finish is somewhat bitter and dry with some alcohol warming. I was looking for more effects from the rye which weren't there for me. A decent IPA but not among my favorites.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,timholio,3.85,"Very heavy beer. I was drinking some other IPA's and had this one to compare it to. I prefer a lower ABV, this is such a heavy drinking beer.  This has very deep flavors and heavy hops of course. I prefer the lighter IPA's such as Blind Pig or Lagunitas IPA. This one has a particular strong flavor that reminds me of the Stone AB.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,deltatauhobbit,4.23,"Pours a nice amber/mahogany color with a slightly tannish head, decent sized head that fades fast but there is a ton of patchy lacing all over my glass, good amount of sediment that dropped quite quickly to the bottle of my glass (there is a warning on the label afterall about this unfiltered ale).  Smell is a good balance between caramel malt and hops with the malt just eeking out ahead, definitely picking up rye that adds a nice dimension.  Taste is primarily caramel malt with rye and some slight bitterness from the hop contribution, the hops aren't really the showcase though in this IPA and that's fine with me as the caramel/rye characteristic is quite nice, carbonation is nice and soft which adds a creamy/velvety factor.  Another the hops aren't really as pronounced as they should be, this is a very good beer and one that I could see being a staple in my fridge if it was distributed in Maine.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Banger530,4.33,"Poured a transparent almost like a cherry wood color. A dark brown with hints of red. A very welcoming tan head on top. Nice lacing all the way down the glass.  I got a sweet almost earthy aroma. Definite piney and citrus aroma in there as well.  What can I say about the taste. Well balanced. A citrus flavor, of grapefruit, up front. A sweet piney flavor next. A hop bite with no alcohol flavor to finish.  Medium body with sufficient carbonation.  Very drinkable. Went down smooth.

M-A little thin bodied with medium carbonation and a slick mouthfeel.  D-It's by no means a bad beer, but the bitterness makes it a little one-sided. Also, where's the rye???

610,3158,snogglethorpe,3.23,"Despite the name, there's absolutely no hint of rye flavor. I really like the taste of rye in beer, so was disappointed to discover this.  Beyond that, it's not bad, but not really great either. There's some nice hop flavor in there, but none of the forwardness and bold flavors one usually expects from an American IPA, and no obvious subtlety to compensate for that lack. It just didn't seem very interesting.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,wingman14,4.18,"Poured a nice dark red with a tall off white head. The smell was really hoppy with some sweet notes mixed with a malty tone. The taste starts hoppy with a citrus kick, stays nice and smooth then finishes with a bitter kick that is both malty with the rye and hoppy. This one has a nice mouthfeel, a heavy medium, very substantial beer, but not overwhelming. It was hard to believe this was 8%, but the kick came later. Nice deep flavors, great balance, definitely a beer to try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

S- A floral earthiness/pinyness from the Amarillo hops.  T- At the front, you taste the floral earthiness/pinyness of the Amarillo hops. This hop flavor is mostly bitter, with a hint of sweetness toward the end of the sip. There is also a hint of dark malts that provide some more sweet to counterbalance the bitter hoppiness. The aftertaste is the bitter pinyness from the hops.  M- Great full, round body that coats your entire mouth with flavor, which is typical of the brewery.  D- Wouldn't mind having a bottle or two, but it is a filling brew due to the medium ABV, full body, and robust hop flavor.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Nice retention and lacing.  S - Lots of floral and earthy hops, some graininess and a load of caramel.  T- A very nicely balanced IPA. The rye does wonders to balance the hop bite, which is assetive and considerable. A mild sweetness at first, it is quickly overtaken by the hop punch, yet it is not overly bitter in a punishing sort of way. Quite nice.  M - Medium to full body, moderate carbonation, dry finish. Anticipated this being a bit thicker, but it is adequate and satisfying.  D- At 8%, this is approaching DIPA levels, and it shows. There is a bit of alcohol warmness in the mouth.

A dark beer with a load of lace and attitude. After first mouthful I could feel the piney taste of hops stuck to the roof of my mouth.  This is not a beer for sipping as a big mouth will just be a massive hop explosion of taste.  The kicker is the rye. I felt it just complemented the amount of hops to give a big balance.  Amazing beer - but best left to last as anything else will be completely tasteless as Hop Rod Rye will claim your palate for its own!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,squidbrand,3.81,"Bomber into bourbon nosing glass (why not?).  A: About as dark as ""amber"" can be without rolling over into ""brown"" territory. Big, tenacious head with lacing to match. Looks thick. Promising, and unconventional if you think of this as an IPA.  S: I don't get the citrus-bomb aroma from this. Am I insane? Generally clean hop aroma with some orange peel, and sweet malt, with a brighter grain note from the rye.  T: Big malt taste at the start, and then a spicy rye rush as the mostly-clean bittering hops take hold for a solid, dry finish. The alcohol flavor really punches through at the end as well, detracting somewhat from the rye. I can clearly taste that 8% ABV.  M: Low carbonation, and thick as hell. Throat-coating sensation, like a whisky.  D: A slightly smaller version of this beer would be highly drinkable, but the thickness and the alcohol get to me. They call it a ""specialty ale"" and they are right. Feeling a little woozy after this bomber. Good flavor balance helps the situation a bit.

Creamy head leaves an amiable ring of soft lacing which coats the glass well. The nose is a mixture of caramel, rye and floral hop. The flavor is excellent, right off the bat. Brown sugar malt meets rye grain and a juicy, bitter hop for quite the exciting mouthful. A bit of fruit comes in to (somewhat) soften the bitter blow of an aggressive hop & rye mixture. Full-bodied, sturdy and refreshing. This beer is not for the timid. It's bitter, it's sweet, it's dry and it's bold!

Slight lactic odor, but I don't think it really detracts from the enjoyment. This beer has a HUGE nose to it, even cold. Alcohol slightly noticeable in aroma and taste. Full body and moderately carbonated. Rye is strongly present in the taste (18% rye had better be) without dominating. Hops and rye blend very well in this beer. This bottle has been in my basement for a while, so the hoppiness has probably dropped. I like beers that age well, and this beer can age very nicely without losing its appeal.

610,3158,BuckeyeOne,4.35,"Had on tap at the Eastside Tavern in Olympia. I've had this in bottle many times without a review. Decided to review after having this on tap.  I'd had Racer 5 many times from the bottle and on tap and it's one of my favorite IPAs (if not beers). I couldn't help comparing Hop Rod Rye to Racer 5 when trying this. However, they are definitely different beers. This beer is a bit more malty than the Racer 5, though the hop bitterness (citrus and fresh grapefruit) breaks through with a vengence after the caramel malt takes the first swing. This describes both the nose and the flavor.  The mouthfeel is just a bit syrupy. The aftertaste is bitter, bitter, bitter --- but in a good way.  I didn't find the Hop Rod as drinkable as the Racer 5 due to the caramel malt presence. Too many of these and I tire of the sweetness. But it's very good. Better than most. It just doesn't compare to the Racer 5 for me and, given the choice, I'd almost always pick up the Racer 5.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

A little bit of grassiness and some caramel. Aroma seems somewhat muted, could be a little stronger. No bottling date is given, so its hard to tell how old this bottle is.  Creamy, malty, hops mixed with rye. The taste is much like the aroma, but stronger. Again, caramel malts come through. Hops add bitterness and a slight amount of citrus. The overall flavor reminds me a bit of Arrogant Bastard, but not quite as fresh and tasty. Still good though.  Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and lightly carbonated with lingering bitterness. Very well done, but doesn't really come across as an IPA.  Drinkability is quite good. This beer goes down really quickly and the ABV is unnoticeable. Nothing is standout about the flavor, but it still tastes good and the body is elegant.  Overall, this is a tasty Rye IPA. Everything about this beer is good, with the body probably being the best aspect. Racer 5 is still my fave Bear Republic beer, but the Hop Rod Rye is another good addition to their lineup.

Poured a beautiful, cloudy amber-red. Throughout the course of drinking, the lacing was exquisite.  S - Rye, brown sugar, and an abundance of citrusy, piny hops.  T - I'm not sure how a beer bursting with this much hops flavor can be balanced, but this succeeds! The distinctive rye flavor and the malty backbone hold up well next to the delicious ever-present hops. This is certainly very bitter, but it's not a one-trick pony by any means.  M - Very good. Although it's not syrupy, there's definitely some substance here. A bit less than average carbonation, perhaps, but this suits the beer well.  D - I want another one right now. Very drinkable for 8%.  Suffice it to say that I was blown away by this beer. I've been a big fan of Racer 5 for awhile, so I'm not quite sure why I haven't tried Hop Rod until today.

610,3158,cdizinno,3.83,"Poured into a tulip glass from a 22oz. bottle with a date of 05 15 0?. The question mark could be an 8 or a 9. I pray that it is 9 and I have to do a better job of finding the dates before buying!  A: Cloudy brownish-amber color witha nice light tan head with moderate lacing.  S: Boozy, tobacco scent probably due to age. Some pine hop aroma and sweet citrus.  T&M: Fairly smooth, medium bodied ale. Slightly rough carbonation. The taste is way better than the smell and I will have to look for a fresher bottle to taste in the future. Spiciness of the rye and hops are fairly well-balanced with a nice malt character. Hop bitterness is not sharp. Finishes bittersweet.  Decent idea of what this may taste like when fresh.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,GarrisWH,4.08,"A - Pours a very nice looking, deep brownish-amber color with a moderate sized beige head. Good retention and leaves some nice lacing behind.  S - Hop aromas with citric and slight pine qualities. Some spicy character as well, although I'm not sure if its the hops or the rye. There is also some sweet, caramel malt lingering in the background.  T - Big hop flavor with a pronounced, but not overwhelming level of bitterness. The hop flavors mostly conjure up thoughts of grapefruit and resinous pine. There is ample malt backing up the hops, lending some brown sugar and caramel flavors. The rye adds a spicy quality that really blends well with the other flavors.  M - Full bodied with a lighter carbonation. Has a very smooth, chewy, resinous mouthfeel.  D - A very well-made brew from Bear Republic. Great combination of flavors, and the addition of rye added an interesting touch. Quite drinkable for 8%, and at a great price for a 22oz as well. I will definitely revisit this one again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,HayesdaHophead,2.86,"I don't have a lot to say about this beer. The rye character just didn't come through for a beer that brags on the label to have 18% rye in the grain bill.  Nice color and drinkable, but maybe I got an old bottle. It didn't seem to be super hoppy or have a distinct rye character. The bottle art is misleading. Not a bad beer, just not something I would buy again.  The label also seems to have another marketing error. It states the sediment might be there in the bottle due to a ""truck-load of hops"". It has been my experience that hops settle out pretty well in brewing and it is just yeast sediment in a bottle. Kind of shook my faith in Bear Republic to see that statement.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

A= Great dark mahogany brown, with great off white cream color head! The retention to the glass for the lacing is unreal, I have small mountains growing off the sides of my glass, never seen lacing like this before.  S=you can really smell the hops. and a sweetness in it, entrancing smell.  T=Wow, you can taste the IBU's in it. wonderful taste. Starts off almost sweet and like the racer 5, then at the end its dry and WHAM 100+ IBU's are there. The rye they use is very noticeable first rye beer. great!  M=As i tasted my 22oz my glass got warmer, warmer it got the sweeter it got for some reason maybe the rye?? but mouth feel was what you would expect from racer 5's cousin(sort of)  D= could definitely drink a couple more!

Followed by spices and sweet malt. Scent is very appealing  T- bitter grapefruit with a spicy follow up. The bitterness reigns supreme throughout consumption. There is some sweetness in between the grape fruits slapping the tongue  M- creamy and carbonated. Really engulfs the mouth with flavor  D- a great ipa from bear republic. The west coast really exemplifies the bitter ipa scene. Great brew that uses some sweetness... A bunch of bitterness...

Creamy light brown heading that left little lacing and the heading didn't last the whole ride. Went flat about halfway through.  Smell malts upon malts. Very bready in the nose with a subtle spicey rye finish.  Taste again is very malty.The bready maltiness is there but is dominated by a nice blending hoppiness. A has decent spicey yeastiness to it but where is the rye? It is there but is hidden.  Mouth is mid to full bodied. Smooth with decent carbonation. Nothing really popping here.

Smell is hoppy with some bready malt. Taste is a dry bitter hoppiness with rye flavored bready malt. Very clean fresh flavors. Medium bodied and sticky mouthfeel.  I guess I don't really have anything profound to say about this one. It's really good but not mindblowing rye IPA. That's about it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Great lacing; each sip and/or gulp is well documented on the side of the glass.  Smells of sweet hops and a hint of malt. Definitely has a load of hops in this beer. A great bitter kick on the tounge with the first sip with a rye twang. Man this beer is nice. Some citrus and spice play very well in this ale.  A bomber of this is the perfect serving size, well maybe two of them would be perfect... Very tasty. Grab one is you can....",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

The nose is sweet, piney, malt forward with noble hops, some citrus, pretty well balanced. Taste features a good dose of caramel malt up front balanced by the rye, not too sweet, with an even hoppy finish, noble bitterness. Good dose of rye and roast for balance. Mouthfeel is medium, given cask condition fairly smooth. Drinkability has the ABV well hidden, farily drinkable once you get used to the rye malt. A nice change of pace, something that I look forward to having again. Highly recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,zoolzoo,3.16,"Thanks Charlatansin  Delerium snifter  Pours a clear, dark mahogany brown, minimal head. This thing smells floral and earthy. Im not getting a blast of citrus like some people are describing. Really, this smells like a bouquet of flowers with some caramel malts thrown in. Booze is nowhere to be found in the nose. Im not really impressed here  As far as taste, the hops are no longer floral but purely bitter. A tinge of citrus hops are present but bitterness dominates the palate. Caramel malt and rye spiciness appear mid palate, the finish is bone dry, and surprisingly nutty. Texturally, this is pretty good. Creamy, medium carbonation.  For 8% beer I can barely find a hint of alcohol. That has to count for something right? Drinkability is pretty good.  Overall this just isnt one of my favorite rye beers. The most off putting thing for me was the aroma. I have a suspicion that this might be a bad bottle or something, the taste seemed faded compared to other rye IPAs Ive had.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,kirkpjr,4.08,"Reviewed from notes.  Poured into a Duvel tulip.  A: Pours a deep, dark, caramel brown. Two full fingers of head. Very little light makes it through. Nice lacing.  S: Grapefruit and piney hops here. Predominantly Cascade I think. Some sweetening caramel malt her rounds out the nose. A sweet alcohol in the finish that strengthens as the beer warms.  T: The grapefruit bitterness follows in the taste. A strong caramelesque malt tones down the hop bite. A touch of dark fruits. A little alcohol is here as well.  M: Moderate carbonation. Creamy presence with resinous hops that linger.  D: A little to sweet to drink many of these. Overall probably the best rye beer I've had. The alcohol also brings down the drinkability.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,zoso493,4.52,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle with no discernible dating on it into a Guiness tuliped pint glass.  Appearance: This is the most gigantic head that I've ever seen on any beer. A gentle pour along the side of the glass produces a two-thousand-finger head that takes forever to dissipate. It's also an especially thick head and it leaves a huge amount of lacing on the glass. Aside from the massive head, the beer pours a beautiful bronze-amber color that is sufficiently hazy.  Smell: This is easily one of the hopped up IPA's in terms of smell that I've had the pleasure to drink. It's just an immense blast of grapefruit, pine and citrus - every kind of hop goodie you can imagine is present in the smell. Very impressive nose.  Taste: The taste, unfortunately, doesn't live up to the promise of the scent. There is a good amount of hop bitterness and the rye is certainly present, but the beer tastes a bit faded to me, which may very well be the case. The hops are still present and take on a fruity profile in the taste, but they don't blast you like the nose would suggest.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is very nice on this brew. It's not the thickest DIPA but it's certainly not lacking in body. It's nicely carbonated and is very smooth and refreshing.  Drinkability: This is a very alcoholic IPA in terms of ABV, but you'd never guess the alcohol was there. As it's not too bitter, this beer is a dreamily drinkable IPA. It's not crisp in the truest sense of the word, but it's definitely on the drier side, leaving you wanting another sip.  Overall, this is a very nice IPA. It's a mind-blowingly flavorful beer like some other West Coast IPA's, but it does everything very well. It's exceedingly drinkable and is one of the better rye beers I've had. All said, this is an excellent IPA and a tremendous value at only $4.49.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,chetripley,4.45,"Poured from a bomber into a Guinness tulip.  Poured an orange, slightly heavier mixture with a decent off white head that lingered for a while, allowing me to savor the smells of spices and pine and grains.  Taste was unique and flavorful, expecting a ton of hop presence but was surprised by the amazing smoothness, which I attribute to the rye. What a great combination of these different sensations. Slightly sweet and oddly enough mildly bitter followup that leaves a pleasant presence on my tongue.  Drinkable thanks to the smoothness, and I am trying hard to keep from drinking quickly, due to the higher alcohol content.  This was the beer that I liked the most.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,jmbranum,4.87,"(drunk in Oklahoma, brought back from a trip to Junction City, KS where I stocked up on lots of different beers)  Wow!  This is something special. I've only had one other rye beer that I can recall (Real Ale's Full Moon Pale Rye Ale from Blanco, TX), but I must say I wish more brewers used rye based on these two.  The Hop Rod Ale pours a pretty orange-copper hazy liquid into the glass. The aroma is lush with spices, grain and hops. The flavor is from another planet. Lots of spices from the rye, rich malt, maybe some caramel but matched perfectly by the perfect mix of strong floral and bitter hops. Perfectly balanced. Not too sweet or too dry.  Mouthfeel is perfect, full and smooth. Lots of glorious texture.  Lingering aftertaste that makes me long for more.  Frankly this beer reminds me of making love. After you've had your fill, it isn't long at all before you want more. It is that good.  I am in love. This beer is thing of exquisite wonder.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Smixam,4.05,"Bomber into a Sam Adams shaped glass.  A - dark amber color with a stark off-white long lasting single finger head. Clear for an unfiltered beer, with seriously heavy lacing.  S - Hop heavy as expected, but with strong fruity undertones. I've not a lot of experience with rye-style ales, but this seems to be consistent with the others in the category. Very nice note of citrus.  T - Strong pine and citrus hop throughout but with a distinct malt character that does actually work to balance the bitters - a little bit of nuttiness on the front side? I can't really tell for sure. Grapefruit towards the end adds to a dry finish.  M - This is an 8% beer, and while there's no sense of an alcohol burn, you can tell its there on the finish as it warms on its way down. Seems a bit 'thick' too - per the lacing on my glass, the flavors stick around a while. I can't pick up any impurities.  D - This is a strong beer, and not one I'd want to session. that said, I have no problem enjoying a bomber to myself every now and again. This is sure to become one of my stronger, special-occasion staples.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Flashsp2,4.37,"Hop Rod Rye bomber into snifter  A soft pour shows a red red, perfectly clear body with golden highlights and a dense two finger head of light sand color.  Aroma is a great blend with sweet caramel malts, prickly hop leaf, grapefruit and some resinous pine sap. A bit of spicyness from the rye as well. Not your typical IPA/DIPA, but it is a rye IPA, so it has its own thing going on. I swear this reminds me more of an old ale or english barleywine.  Is this a barleywine? Damn this is tasty. Waves of flavor hit the palette, leaving you reaching back to pick up more complexity with each sip. The first flavor is a sweet caramel drizzle, then big hop style grapefruit, citrus, spicy rye, and a nice oily hop finish that is pretty clean. Some toasted wheat bread and raisin as it comes up to temp.  Mouthfeel is a great part of this beer. Soft, sticky, heavy but not oily, with a medium carbonation that keeps it all together.  Now this is a beer that is easy on the mouth. Easy drinking, oh yes.  If you were to hand me this blindly I would almost think I was drinking a Bigfoot, which is really saying something. This beer warps my perceptions of what an IPA is, since it has such an interesting malt base to it. Now this is a hyped beer that has the power to back it up. I wish this were in NM, because it would get regular rotation at my house, which doesn't happen with very many beers.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,TCHopCraver,4.5,"A: Pours a rudy red/mahogany into an oversized wine glass. A light khaki,1 and 1/2 finger head recedes over the course of a minute to leave a thin retaining film. The lacing is sticky and thin and looks like ancient hieroglyphics.  S: Very intriguing. The combination between the hops and the rye malt produces a cranberry and fig smell that is supported by the expected citrus and floral aromas. Call me crazy, but in a way this smells like a Belgian quad with the figgy-sweetness. It has a unique aroma for an IPA, to be sure.  T: This is a really special meeting of hops, barley malt, and rye in my mouth. The cranberry and fig sweetness that I alluded to in the smell kicks off the flavor on the palate, followed by an exciting collision of the fresh hops and spicy rye malts. The finish is nice and bitter and awfully tasty. This is not your typical American IPA, but its ingenuity and creativity makes it a truly unique and great one.  M: This beer is a dancer; it's a soul's companion; you can feel it everywhere. But seriously, folks. This one really hits all the buttons of my palate. The carbonation is deliciously crisp, the barley and rye malts lend a good, full body, and the bittering hops donate a dry, bitter finish.  D: Would I have another? Yeeeaaash. If you couldn't tell, I really dig this beer. I'm not sure if it's the mood I'm in or what, but this is really striking the right chord with me right now.

610,3158,Musition12,4.23,"12oz bottle poured into a Fin Du Monde tulip.  A: Pours a hazy, dark amber-mahogany color with a glorious 3-finger light tan head that leaves moderate lacing down the glass. Head eventually recedes to a 1/4 inch, but retention is good. Beautiful looking beer.  S: Sprightly citrus with accompanying bitterness. Oranges, grapefruits, etc. Hints of spicy maltiness presumably from the rye.  T: Fresh-squeezed grapefruit leaving a considerable bitterness in the dry finish. This is backed by a sturdy malt foundation with an ever-present grainy rye flavor and subdued caramel notes. The spicy rye really balances the bitterness and makes for a marvelous tug-of-war on the palate with the grapefruit hops winning out ever so slightly.  M: Medium body and carbonation. Simultaneously juicy and creamy. Alcohol is barely noticeable.  D: Very drinkable despite the 8% ABV. I would drink this all the time if the alcohol didn't sneak up on me.  One of my favorites. Accessible, yet tenacious flavor profile. Dewy hops tempered by stately rye and caramel malts.

The head was long lasting and left prominent lacing on the walls of my pint glass. The clarity of the ale was slightly turbid with a moderate yeast ""halo"".  The aroma was cirtus, ripe plum, with a grainy note to end.  The flavor was sweet malt, tart rye, hop bitterness. Very refreshing, but slightly heavy.  The drinkability was good given the robust ABV and full rich mouthfeel.  I really like this ale. Normally a IPA fan, but the addition of rye gives this ale an unmistakable crispness that is different than the normal hoppy bitterness.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,jminsc76,4.07,"Pours a large foamy head atop a reddish/amber body. The head is big and takes a while to dissipate, leaving some nice lacing.  Aromas of pine, citrus, oranges, and roasted rye. Very fruity, almost sweet.  Flavors of hops, a little grapefruit, some maltiness, but devoid of the slightly caramel flavors I taste in Racer X or Green Flash's West Coast I.P.A. Packed with flavor and enjoyable bitterness.  Mouthfeel is thin and the alcohol burns slightly, but nothing overwhelming. Almost exhibits a meaty consistency across the palate.  Overall, while I do enjoy this beer, I prefer the Racer 5 more. This doesn't have the refreshment that other IPAs have, and I cannot figure out why. I like the rye aspect, but when it comes to IPAs I much prefer ones that are less induced with it, and have less of a sour and heavy feel.

Similar in flavor: intensely citric hops overshadow a substantially spicy malt base. Hops quickly permeate the palate with strong grapefruit rind bitterness. Spicy, slightly grainy malt profile provides some ripe fruit undertones to the citrus flavors. Finishes fairly dry and bitter with hints of spicy malt/rye grain and citrus rind.

Everything about it screams that this is a great IPA.  Very citrusy aroma with plenty of pine in there too. Herbal and earthy. Not much in the way of grain or malt, but I believe I smell some of the rye in it. Sweet, fruity flavor of orange and grapefruit. The rye adds a wholesome, doughy, and sweet flavor.  Not overly bitter, a bit sweet, and with a thick, creamy mouthfeel. Smooth and silky.  As my first rye beer, I thought this one was excellent. The hops and rye pair great together.

Appearance: Deep dark brown, not very vibrant, with lots of sediment floating around the glass. After a while this settles on the bottom. There is a one finger beige head with good retention as well.  Smell: Hop citrus lends a nice aroma to the brew. Hops are not overpowering but are still in your face enough to make this feel like an incredible IPA. Some rye spice also balances out the aroma.  Taste: Much like the aroma, citrus and grapefruit notes of the hops lead the way. There is some bitterness but it is not overpowering. The hops are rounded out nicely but some nice malt notes and the nice little kick of rye that increases in flavor the more you drink.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied. Some nice carbonation keeps this beer crisp and drinkable.  Drinkability: For an IPA with this ABV and flavor, I find it incredibly drinkable. Nice clean flavor and a crisp mouthfeel make this dangerously easy to drink.  Overall, certainly one of the better single IPAs I have ever had. The interplay of the rye spice and the hops is perfect and makes this a unique and incredible brew. Certainly recommended, especially to IPA lovers.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Smell: A sort of grainier IPA aroma, though not very strong. Grains and some hops/citrus.  Taste: Citrus aroma throughout, starting with hop bitterness and leading to a bitter rye flavor which persists into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with light carbonation and relatively smooth.  Drinkability: The rye flavor is awfully intense; hard to take.  I'll confess I'm not the biggest fan of rye, but the taste here is very bitter and way over the top. Too much for me, unfortunately.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BeanBone,4.32,"Appearance: A murky copper-brown body capped by a finger of off-white head that leaves nice patchy lacing.  Aroma: Piney, somewhat green, and citrusy hops over a big caramel body and some medium booze. Very appetizing.  Flavor: Up front, a wave of grapefruity, resinous, lightly herbal, and bitter hops. Underneath, a biscuity caramel malt body with some definite rye notes. It's all balanced nicely. The alcohol is masked well, adding just a little spice. Biscuity malt and lots of resinous bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and a little creamy with smooth medium carbonation and a dry finish. A few bare hints of warmth from the alcohol.  Drinkability: About as drinkable as a hoppy and full-flavored eight percent ABV beer can be.  Verdict: Solid and thoroughly tasty throughout, Hop Rod Rye is a great ""medium-alcohol"" Double IPA with a nice rye twist.

610,3158,exparte,4.46,"Strong and pleasing aroma of sweet and spicy malt with citrus hops. Very American in both malt and hops. I'm guessing the pineapple and pine aroma comes from the same Columbus and Cascade hops that's featured in their Racer 5 IPA. The rye makes the beer slightly spicy and considerably darker than the IPA. It pours a deep reddish orange with a big fluffy off-white head that lasts long beyond the final drop. The taste is a fine balance between the sweet malt, spicy rye, and citrus hops. No component outshines the other. It's full bodied with a smooth texture and a lingering bittersweet finish. This beer is full and satisfying with a delicately balanced character that allows you to fully enjoy each drop which is remarkable for a style in which so many others punch you in the face with just one element.

The smell is very malty, dark fruit/cherry, pine. Bitter hops and smooth malts are balanced here excellently. Pine, caramel, rye, and dark cherry all take turns dancing on the tongue. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. This drinks almost like a mini-strong ale. Alcohol is very-well hidden, a tiny bit shows through at the end. Long ago when I first tried this I didn't think much of it and thought it was one of the most overrated beers in the top 100. Now I can safely say it deserves its place.

The scent is dominated by spicy notes and flowery and citrusy hop aromas. It is very much like smelling a handful of citrus zest, honestly.  The taste is very interesting: The taste of rye is new to me, but it seems a little sourish and slightly spicy. Shows a good crispness, accentuating the deliciously bitter hops. A very grainy aftertaste of bready malt.  It's medium-bodied with a fair amount of carbonation tickling the tongue.

S - Strong earthy hops upfront with a bit of malt in the back.  T - Tale of Two Cities here. Great taste upfront, nice hop presence, bitter in a good way, but what an horrific finish. I felt like I was drinking a cactus. My throat cried ""What are you doing to me?!"" and there was this horrific itchy feeling. After about 5 or 6 ounces of this it went down the drain and saved my throat with a nugget nectar.  M - Considering I practically needed to shove a back scratcher down my throat, I would say 'horrific'.  D - I love IPA's, both the single and the double.

610,3158,sophisticated,4.03,"I'm lucky enough to have gotten 2 bottles in recent trades so thanks to JosephLondon and Caresville!!  Definitely not familiar with rye, which is one reason I was eager to try this.  A) Awesome. Brownish-amber and cloudy (unfiltered) body with massive head - 3 fingers of massive super-foamy bubbles that lasted forever and left huge lace. Fantastic.  S) Upon opening the bottle citrus hops poured out. Sweet and fresh. Also some peppery spice I could feel in my throat just by smelling.  T) Wow! Delicious IPA with rye. A balance of sweet citrus, piney hops, bitter rye, and spice. The more I drank, the more the rye and spice stood out, giving it an unusual taste for an IPA.  MF) Pretty creamy, very soft from all the foam  D) Good! Attractive ale, nice smell, nice taste. Very well-balanced and tasty. I enjoyed the rye - it gave it another dimension than other IPAs which was different but good. It makes me curious to try more rye beers.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Beer leaves great lace and a huge chunky island that nears touches the nose with every sip. Awesome.  Brew smells of piney hops, caramel, yeast, spices. Smells complex and very tasty.  This brew has a deep complex flavor; caramel, malty, yeasts, big hops, spicey, rye. Easy smooth mouthfeel, finishes a tad bitter and dry. This is a very drinkable brew.  Wow, hands down one of the best Rye/American IPA's I have ever had. This is a classic must drink brew. I could easily session this 8% alcohol brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BeerGodz,4.08,"Look: Dark amber, clear, big fluffy head with staying power, and excellent lacing  Smell: Huge hop aroma! Mostly pine with some citrus, and bready malt  Taste: Up Front: Pine, orange rind, sweet malty goodness. Finish: Pepper (from the rye), lingering malt, and hop bitterness  Mouthfeel: Medium body, creamy with medium carbonation  Drinkability: Resinous astringency character in the finish.  Overall Impression: Rye just ain't my thing. Luckily this is way more like an IPA than a Rye beer, and I love IPA's. At 8% ABV this one is close to being a Double IPA, which is one of my favorite styles. This one is just a little too astringent and bitter in the finish for my palate, but overall it was outstanding!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

T: Tastes of sweet roasted malts, hints of caramelized malts, a big spicy rye mixed with earthy and piney hops really brings this one together. The rye mixes very well with the hops and it hides the abv so you wouldn't know if you didn't read the bottle how big of a beer it is.

610,3158,bosox941827,4,"Poured from a 22oz bomb bottle into an imperial pint glass; poured cold but drank slowly over time to let it warm.  A - Mahogany is the best word to describe the color, along with the implied warmth that comes with that term; this is an inviting-looking beer, though dark for the style. A bit cloudy as it is unfiltered. A medium-aggressive pour yields a big foamy head that dissipates and leaves lace all the way down the glass. S - Mostly hops, with a bit of malt tossed into the mix. T & M - Big, soapy hops right off the bat, with an (initially) unplaceable sweetness in the background. Hops linger throughout the palate, and at the end the maltiness begins to resolve and become discernible; roasted malts (especially) and rye are pretty prominent here (mid-palate). Long, long finish that dries out the tongue with a ""off"" taste (rye?). Mouthfeel is almost creamy, as the carbonation is perfect for the style. Alcohol is nowhere to be found, which is pretty amazing at 8%. D - Yeah, pretty great. Could drink a bunch of these despite it being a pretty substantial beer.  Overall this is a pretty darn good IPA, with the rye making it a bit more interesting. IPA/hop lovers with love this.

Really wish i had some strong cheese to pair with.  M: Mouthfeel matches the strength of the flavor and aroma. Minimal, but good carbonation.

Smells of rye malt and great American hops. Pretty good aroma.  Tastes just as it smells. The Rye adds a great flavor to the IPA. A nice malty sweetness blanaced by the hops well  Mouthfeel is great. The malt to carb ratio is good and to style.  Overall this is a great beer that everyone should try. Get it in a trade if you have to.

A-Deep amber red, almost brown. Head is a light tan that dissipates quickly.  S-Caramel, malts, pine, and rye with strong hoppiness. Noticeable citrus as well.  T-Follows the nose here. Malts and rye dominate with a bitter, lingering hop finish.  M-Medium, maybe even full bodied. Medium carb. As mentioned, it has a lingering aftertaste which is just awesome. Overall pretty smooth.  D-ABV is barely noticeable and it goes down smooth.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,nopucophop,3.85,This beer is kind of hard to review. I first off think that the bottle I am reviewing may not be one of the freshest offerings available. Secondly there are no flavor or appearance criteria in the guidelines.   As far as appearance goes this is a deep red / dark copper color that has a head that holds up well and then slowly fades but always slightly remains.  The aroma is a combination of hop and malt with the hop being more prevalent. I believe a fresher serving would have even less of a malt aroma.  The taste seems to be overly malty to the style but again can be a result of the age of the bottle. Still has a nice hop profile but not as intense as I would have imagined.  The mouthfeel is a nice medium body that that has a semi dry finish. Does have a slight warmth from alcohol. Very true to style  The drinkability is good. Once again I believe freshness play a big part in this. I have still enjoyed this bottle however fresh it may be. I will be looking forward to getting another bottle to try.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,VaTechHopHead,4.17,"A - Deep brown with a mahogany red hue. Slightly unfiltered with a tan head that fades kinda quickly but leaves its fingerprint all the way down the glass.  S - It has a nice blend of malts and hops but the hops take over towards the end. The addition of rye isn't too apparent on the nose but you can tell it is there.  T - The spiciness of the rye definitely comes through a lot more in the taste. It is complimented with piney/earthy hops that taste very fresh and clean, plus pair nicely with the flavors of the rye. The malts give it a great backbone...they aren't too strong and are slightly roasted, and pull all the flavors together. No competition between flavors in this one and they are all separate but blend well together.  M/D - Medium/heavy body that finishes quite dry from all the hops. There is a little apparent heat from the alcohol but nothing too distracting. Drinkability is high but you wouldn't want to put down too many of these at one time.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,SDHoffers,4.67,"I love the initial hop-hit when you dive into one of your favorite IPA's but Hop Rod is one the best at lingering around for awhile on the back of your tongue. There is definitely a strong malt note here. Not overpowering but significant. Coppery and murky. The rye is not overwhelming and it's incredibly easy to drink at 8 percent. In my opinion, there really isn't a bad brew from Bear Republic and this is a great example of the quality they produce year after year.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,diechipmunk,3.23,"Poured from bottle into an Imperial Pint, nice bronze color with bit of ruby glow. Thick 2-finger head that hangs around and left a good lacing.  S - Strong earthy smell; hops, pine and Grapefruit backed and malt. I got a smell of something that reminded me of a gym bag - not necessarily bad, although it sounds that way, is that the rye? It's only my second rye beer.  T - Bready/malty sweetness with resiny hop bit that clings to the tongue. Grain flavors come through in the middle with a lingering finish of spicy/peppery hops. Still a bit of mustiness - possibly the rye. It's different (to me), but not unpleasant, but it is strong.  M - Rich, smooth, resiny, very silky throughout. Lingering.  D - A very drinkable brew, complex layers of flavor and no alcohol intrusion from the 8% ABV.  This beer is good quality, and complex. The taste is not my favorite, at the moment, but that is personal preference.

S-Pungent pine resin hops predominate with a malt backbone whiff in the background. Enticing.  T-The caramel backbone is well supported by the resinous citrus hops that dominate this brew, but it is not so hop-centric that it throws off the balance. Damn tasty slighly bigger brother to Racer 5 with a spicy rye twist.  M-Well balanced, creamy and just perfect.  D-Entirely drinkable...never would know that this is an 8% ABV brew.

610,3158,Daniellobo,3.75,"Remarkable brew that borders on a rye and DIPA character but ultimately achieves something else.  Presentation: 12 oz bottle. Old school flaming vehicle design mixed with the Bear Republic branding, a bit kitschy and, true again, the motor topic does not do it for me. Brief and assertive narrative with some nice brew master notes, including its non-filtered character.. Lacks date of bottling or freshness, neither shows IBUs or °Plato, only Alc. (8.0%) Poured into a tulip glass.  A - Pours amber-brown to brown color with some scarlet tones towards the edges. Short creamy head, medium to small retention and some unremarkable lacing.  S - Very subdued on this version. There is a faint hoppy grapefruit and pine resin whiff, with a shy rye remembrance.  T - Hmmm there is a malty sweetness coating a shy rye note, and a finishing hoppy bite. Grapefruit and a bit of a resiny range.  M - Medium body with what seems initially medium carbonation that goes quite light quickly. It is very short of the rye texture, maybe due to the proportion of grain used, maybe because of a freshness issue.  D - It´s rather nice and a good brew to be had. But in this current incarnation it is also something not to keep at the forefront for a drinking experience.  Notes: I rather like it but does not fulfill a series of expectations. Ultimately this does not matter much since it is a a very pleasing brew and full of character. But for me it is quite a bit a shy on the rye, it could use a bit more for my taste, at least to call it ""rye anything"", and likewise I do not perceive the super assertive hoppy profile that is typically associated with this brew. Likewise, it feels too hefty and off the beaten path to consider it an American IPA. Strange and remarkable brew in any case.  To be fair, I have nicer memories from a bomber I had of this a while back. Since it has no freshness date I wonder if this four-pack has been sitting for a bit too long in a beer boneyard, and it may have lost at least a good part of its aroma, and hop assertiveness.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BeerFMAndy,4.23,"22 oz bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada Imperial Pint. 8% ABV, 317 09 printed on the UPC.  A - Hop Rod starts up nicely with an amber-brown body that's clear with a three-finger, off-white/tan head. Great retention that eventually succumbed to a rocky, clumpy pile lowering down leaving tons of awesome lace all over the glass.  S - Bold notes of American Graffiti...er hops come out. Pine and mild citrus with a strong rye nose backed by a good maltiness. Overall it's somewhat low but good none-the-less. Maltier with rye more than hoppy.  T - During the nose and appearance the hops were just revving their engines to burn rubber in my mouth! They peel out with a well-balanced pine and citrus patch followed up by a smoke cloud of rye, malts, and light honey left in their wake. Very smooth balance.  M - Smooth feeling and soft on the palate, Hop Rod is gentle with a moderate bitterness to the finish.  D - Hop Rod is one smooth ride. A great beer with great suspension, there are a lot of nice flavors going on here. The alcohol is nowhere to be found and the 22 can be polished off by one person I'd say.

It whispered, ""Drink me, I'm all the company you will need tonight"". Might I add that i was already a little tipsy at this time, so speaking Beer is not that uncommon. Once I had purchased the item in question, I proceeded to make my way home, where i could truly enjoy this masterful American brew.  Appearance- Clear with a little clouding, giving this beer a mysterious and ominous look.  Smell- Strong notes of citrus, pine and biscuits. Quite a nose pleasing and pungent concoction.  Taste- A hearty IPA flavor that was followed by hints of sweet french bread and a hint of malt.  Mouthfeel- owh so good, yet a little thick.

T: immediate taste of apples, hoppy and bitter citrus, bread-like, with a strong malty balance. fades to a peppery and fruity finish. very bitter with alot of malt sweetness.  M: Full bodied beer, thick and creamy, then gives way to a tingle of hops and light carbonation. finishes very crisp, with alot of hop resins, and a warming alcohol effect. finishes dry.  Overall, a unique brew with alot of muscle! This is my 2nd IPA/APA to review that was brewed with rye that I know of(other was Founder's Red's Rye P.A.). I love the unique characteristics that this extra ingredient adds to the finished product. It gives the beers a bready, crispy, and spicy quality that adds to the expression of the hops. This is a must-try for hopheads looking for an extra treat!

610,3158,feelmefoam,4.3,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a DFH specialty glass.  HopRod Rye pours a beautiful burnished mahogany color with some nice lighter walnut highlights when held up to the light. Certainly not the kind of color I was expecting for this, but it is really pretty. The beer put up a finger of off-white, foamy head that had decent retention and left some solid, sticky rings around the glass.  The nose is chock-full of hops. Hoppy citrus and pine aromas waft from the nose and a tiny bit of brown sugar maltiness comes through in the end. Very aromatic as well, you don't have to search for the scents.  The taste is intriguing. Up front, a bit of toasty caramel malt flavor comes out in conjunction with a little bit of piney hop flavor, then it is absolutely blown away by more citrusy hop flavor. The rye adds a bit of spicy flavor in the background. Doesn't blow me out of the water, but it's good.  A good mouthfeel here as well. Medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation to help mask the alcohol. Crisp and zesty on the tongue with a drying finish.  All in all, this is a well put together, drinkable IPA. Drinkability takes a bit of a hit with the higher ABV, but I can't really put this one down. Is it a DIPA or a regular AIPA? Make up your mind. Either way, it's pretty and its tasty, and I won't have any problems finishing the 4 pack.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Such a complex array of flavors, lead the way to a bitter finish. Crisp taste, medium body and carbonation. Just the right balance between rich and smoooth feel.

T- Initially I get crisp pine, as well as bitter grapefruit/lemon rind, then some really nice spiciness and a slight sweetness emerge, which eventually give way to toasted bread and rye/graininess. Maybe a slight bit of nuttiness on the tail end too. Really complex and unique.  M- Medium bodied, nice spritz-y carbo which really lightens the weight of the body.

Smell is a ridiculous caramel and hops aroma is strong as well, creating a smell that might be requested by me on my death bed.  Like other reviews, I agree the 8% abv isn't noticed, but the caramel, hops and citrus, which may or may not be a product of the 18% rye, balance oh so well.

Taste: Fresh hops out front followed by a barrage of dry grain. A little spiciness from the rye comes through. Booze and a lot of sweetness, then followed by a lingering hop bitterness. Hops never overwhelm and the grain character plays really well with the herbal hops.  Mouthfeel: Thick and hearty, vigorous carbonation, but not too much.

Chunky sheets of lacing. I don't see how this beer could look any better.  Juicy hop aromas mix with spicy rye notes and pine to form a nice nose.  Flavor is big, piney, and spicy. Pretty rich and malty, with a burnt caramel character. Hops and bitterness outweigh this though. Rye adds an earthy, bready component, making this beer complex and about more than just hops.

A-A very deep red almost brownish color, holding it up to the light shows off the deep red color, has a solid head and leaves a solid lacing on the glass.  S-Floral hops with an almost caramel hint, with a cross of some dark rye bread.  T-Very hoppy at first almost biting, after that there is a bit of a rye flavor that almost smooths it out. Every other sip seems to go from biting to smooth. Very interesting, just that fact makes this one of my favorite brews.  M- Again it goes from biting to smooth and vice versa. I find it quite unique.  D-Can't really go for more than one of these in a night. I actually prefer to split a bomber with a friend. It doesn't show off the 8$ abv at all, seems so much less than that.  I would have to say that I highly recommend this beer, as it blows me away.

610,3158,mgbickel,4.42,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Perfect Pint glass. Formed thick, 2 finger tan head. Quick dissipation that left behind a little lacing. The body a deep reddish brown with lots of floaters...from active yeasts I hope!  The hops attack the nose...piney and grassy. You can also detect some malts, sweet breads and undertones of citrus fruits. All of this is on a rye backbone that comes through better as the beer warms.  Waves of flavors come across your palate. First is an initial preview of the hops...bang! Bitterness hits the tongue. This gives was way to a sweet caramel, malty flavor that lasts for a few seconds before the second wave of hops hit again. This one lingers into the aftertaste. Nice balance...  Mouth feel is medium, oily and moderately carbonated.  Very drinkable...pretty darn hoppy, but not overpowering. Complex and refreshing!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Taste sweet caramel and crystal malt up front, some great piney hops float mid way through the mouthfeel and rounds out with a mild pine and grassy hop flavor rounded out with some toasted biscuit and rye sweetness and dryness.

610,3158,Lunch,4.5,"Served on-tap at Victoria Gastro Pub in Columbia, MD (12/31/09). Served in a 12oz. Pilsner-esqe pint glass at an appropriate temperature (01/11/10) .  A: Pours a slightly hazy golden amber with one finger of an off-white head that leaves nice lacing on the inside of the glass.  S: Fresh hop aroma of containing nice citrus and piney tones as well as a hint of rye surrounded by a slightly sweet caramel malt. There is also a very nice tropical fruit aroma milling about as well.  T: For an American IPA brewed with rye, the rye certainly takes the backseat in the flavor profile. Citrus and piney hops start things out with some flavorful layers of tropical fruit. The malt backbone consists of caramel and toffee which helps to balance out some of the bitterness. Great flavor profile with just a hint of rye.  M: Medium-bodied and slightly creamy and slick with moderate carbonation.  D: Great drinkability especially for an 8% abv. American IPA as the alcohol is completely hidden and the bitterness is never too severe.  Overall this is certainly my favorite Rye American IPA to date and another solid effort from Bear Republic.

T: Earthy, piney hops along with a huge malt taste, dark caramel, a tingly spiciness, more hops in the back of the mouth. M: Oily hops, high carbonation, tastes ""rich"" without being cloying. D: An awesome beer, for a massive hop bomb, it is very balanced. There is no hint of alcohol making this a potentially dangerous beer. I really like that there is obviously a lot of caramel malts here, but it is not ""caramelly"". Interesting, it seems to be a cross between an old/stock ale and an IPA, definitely not a standard DIPA. Highly recommended.

610,3158,Vancoubeer,5,Awesome beer. Looks like an amber but tastes like an IPA. Hoppy blend of stuff put into this brew makes it a great one. I will get it again. Had it after a malty sweet beer and is amazing in contrast. I wonder where the rye is. Perhaps if it gets a bit warmer.  10 min later: definately can taste the rye. It gives it a bolder taste.

Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a pint glass  A - Pours a copper color with a reddish hue. There is a finger width of cream-colored head, and it sits like a soft pillow on top of the beer. The lacing is like a tall woman - legs forever! They just stick the glass and look like a spiderweb stretching all the way down.  S - Initially some piney notes. There's a touch of spiciness somewhere in there. Is that rye? On the finish, there's a faint smell of bready sweetness in there too.  T - Wow. There's a lot going on here. I never eat rye bread, so it's hard for me to place the rye, but I'm assuming that's the taste I can't define. I had Nelson from Alpine a few weeks back, and so I can find the similar taste between the two; the rye! Anyway, there's a lot of hops up front with some balance from the rye and malts on the back end. Pretty tasty. My palate jargon is definitely lacking.  M - Medium body with a good amount of carbonation.  D - I'd definitely consider having another if it were in my fridge. Glad I finally picked one of these up.

The Hop Road Rye is unfiltered, evidenced by the hazy/murky body littered with some rather chunky particulate. I have no problem with this.  S: A bit of nutty/bready/grainy malts are definitely noticeable among the hop forward aroma. Grasses, herbs and flowers...fairly straightforward. Leafy yeast notes. The Hop Rod must have went Off Road. Additional aromas enhance the complexity : Honey, brown sugar, coriander, nutmeg and a light touch of simple syrup sweetness.  T: Follows the aroma pretty closely. Nothing too flashy about the Hop Rod. This is simplicity at it's finest. Just phenomenal.  M: Light, creamy body. A little low on the bubbles. Despite the heavy hop hand, the bitterness was surprisingly low. Could have been a little more souped up. The mouthfeel was the least impressive aspect.  D: This is my favorite beer by Bear Republic.

The taste begins with a malt flavor that is dominated by hops. The malt fades away, but the hops lingers for quite a while.

610,3158,pvsob,3.82,"A - Deep amber/mahogany color with a thick, two-finger head that lasts forever and leaves great lacing. Somewhat hazy, with suspended particles.  S - Aroma consists mainly of citrus (grapefruit) with a little pine as well. Pungent/sour/spicy rye aromas come into the equation halfway. A pleasant floral aroma mixed with some caramel sweetness balances out the rye character. As the beer warms, I start to pick up some candied oranges and just a hint of alcohol. A very balanced and complex aroma.  T - Starts off with a nice sweetness from the malts in the beginning. In the middle the rye rears its head, and along with the citrus and pine results in a spicy/bitter finish. Good, but not great.  M - Mouthfeel is medium to full. It has just enough carbonation to keep this beer from becoming too sticky.  D/O - A well made AIPA that is well balanced when it comes to the hops, malt, and alcohol. The rye is there, but personally I would have liked it to have had a stronger showing. Nothing mind blowing, but I'd still recommend it if you haven't tried it before.

610,3158,Dijeriduster,3,"Disclaimer, I did get this on sale - a sign it could be an old sample. Still its high alcohol, high hops soooo  A - Dark brown ambery colour pour heavy with fairly prominent head. That faded fairly quickly to a little bit of a surface cover.  S - Very hoppy with caramel/malty flavors coming thru. More bitter than citrus smelling...  T - Very diff with the rye, seems strong here vs other rye ipa's. starts off with caramel malt tones quickly succumbing to the massive hop profile. Rye hits in the middle with a strange spiciness you won't find in any non-rye beer. Finish is a little sweet and syrupy.  M - Pretty good, but it does straddle the too sweet / syrupy zone a little too close for me. Has a slightly creamy feel overall.  D - Not that great actually. Again I might have a bunk sample but this isn't the first time I've had the beer. Frankly its too sweet on the malts for me - vs other local ""strange IPA's"" beers with an emphasis on the hop profile.

610,3158,biegaman,4.8,"The glass is painted in chromas of orange, ruby and amber; their embers are bright and flare up to the light. Its clarity, until the very last dregs, was spotlessly clear which furthered the beer's splendid aurora. Its head bubbled up like magma and exploded into a scatter-spray of lacing. The eccentric patterns would make an excellent ink splotch test.  Bring an umbrella - it's raining hops! As they fall from the sky a wave of pungent tanginess manages to penetrate right down to the marrow of your bones. It has the same all-consuming sensation as a gust of cold winter air or the burning radiance of a hot summer sun - it is not only noted it is sensed by all parts of the body. This beer is as hoppy as hops are green and every bit as aromatic as an incense.  It's an herbal, floral, citrus-spritzed fragrance and it carries over into the taste. The roasty graininess of the rye is also evident in the aroma and it, too, doubles as a flavour. The moderately-strong spicy flavour of the rye is nearly reminiscent of pumpernickel bread, and certainly brings to mind a choice Jewish bakery, but is so drizzled in chunks of caramel and candied citrus bits that it is, and should be, only recognizable as its own delicious being.  For all its resounding hoppiness the beer is considerably balanced. The graininess of the rye ensures a stiff, hearty, naturally tangy maltiness that blends ideally with the orange zest and piny serum of the hops. The alcohol may just as well not be noted and, although it pains me to admit it, I would probably drink this until unconsciousness if it were feasible to do so. The experience can vary between general pleasure to pure hedonism.  Honk if you love hops! If this beer were a car it would come fully loaded with plenty of legroom and a 350 horsepower V8 engine. And it's probably won my car of the year award every year since I've tried it. In fact, I remember the first time I took it for a test drive - I awoke the next day to find my hands still smelling like hops. No kidding!

The one time I've had Racer X it was heavenly. Bear Republic may be my favorite brewers, so let's see what this beer's got.  Poured from the bottle into my Swarthmore College pint glass.  Appearance: Cherry cola, a dark brown with maroon. Nice medium-sized head which leaves lovely, sturdy lacing.  Smell: Big hops, mostly citrus. A bit weak, but pleasant.  Taste: Those citrus hops mix wonderfully with earthy malt and rye. There's a bit of sweetness down there, too. Plum, I want to say. It all mixes together perfectly to create one of the better balanced beers I've had.  Mouthfeel: Big, sturdy body, with moderate carbonation. It's pretty sticky.  Drinkability/Overall: I could drink this beer all day, everyday. Perfectly balanced, and absolutely delicious. It doesn't quite top Racer 5, but it'll become a regular in my fridge.

Hops aren't really exploding but well balanced w/rye malt + other malts. Citrus and pine come out in the hops about halfway through and leave a lasting bitterness.  M: Medium. Fairly thick for an IPA but very smooth malty.  D: Fantastic. Well balanced and delicious especially for IPA.

610,3158,number1bum,4.38,"Pours a brown, slightly reddish color with about two fingers of light beige head. Keeps a thick, full lace and leaves some very nice rings of stick on the sides.  Smells of some juicy citrus hops, grapefruit pith, a bit of a toasted aroma with some rye. Not a super robust nose, but it is nice.  Taste also starts off with some citrus flavor and then transitions into some bitter grapefruit peel, bitter hops and an explosion of spicy rye. It's also quite resiny, with some sticky pine flavor. The bitterness and rye mount as you get deeper into a glass of this brew, as well, and ultimately completely take over the taste buds. This is a very tasty beer, but this is also nothing to be trifled with, that's for sure.  Mouthfeel is a creamy medium body, or a bit on the plus side of a medium. The immense bitterness and complementary rye make it very dry in the finish. It is quite smooth, however, before it drys the mouth right out, with a slick resiny feel to it.  Mmm this is tasty stuff.

610,3158,cavedave,4.1,"A vigorous pour plants a thick dark beige head of bubbling foam atop a cloudy dark red amber beer. A swirl of the snifter leaves mountain ranges of lace.  The smell is medium strength, full of yummy citrus, light yeast, brilliant notes of rye, and a gentle bitterness that balances a sweetness to the bouquet.  The rye here is strong up front in the sip, and in the finish, more than in the other four takes on this style I've enjoyed ( including a reg. in the beer rotation here, RastafaRye) Haven't tried many, but tried enough to know what makes the style great, and that I like it a lot. The rye comes with a bit of a sourness that's followed by sweet malt, yeast, citrus, citrus peel, and ends in a blend of rye, citrus, and into a bitter crescendo that is earthy, bitter, dry and delicious. Describe it? It's clean, it hits all the areas of the tongue with nice pleasure, it's complex with lots of flavor going on to make this beer a gem, and it gets better as it nears room temp.  Mouthfeel is hard to judge for me, but as it relates to promotion of a clean, long, delicious flavor and finish, I rate it very good, without trying to conform it to style.

Not much head to speak of, just a broken layer of tan bubbles leaving a nice collar and a few islands of bubbles on the surface. Nice lacing down the sides of the glass.  S - Spicy and richly malty...nice bready aromas in the center and some earthy hops. Grainy rye aroma is prominant. Not as much hoppiness as I expected, or much at all, for that matter.  T - Quite a bit of rye, medium-dark roasted malts, a touch of caramelly sweetness. A strong, but sorta in the background bitterness that sits underneath the other flavors, perhaps a touch on the harsh side, but still good. Quite bitter, but not much hop flavor in here, a bit of earthiness, but it is hard to distinguish whether this is from the hops or the rye and roasted malts.  M - Medium bodied, tending toward the heavy side. Feels a little thick on the tongue. Carbonation is just right...plenty there, but not too much - just enough to enhance the flavors and feel - just a bit tingly on the tongue. Bitterness pervades the entire mouth and lingers for a long time after the swallow.  D - Good tasting beer...not sure I can call this an IPA, but whatever. At 8%, a little high to be sessionable.

The foam is crawling up the side of the glass and throwing gobs of lace all down the side.  S- Spicy, probably from the rye. Piny, floral hops underneath.  T- The malt base comes in first. Its spicy and smooth. The hops arent too big here. They are piny, and mostly citrusy. The finish is really spicy like allspice and cinnamon. It sticks to the back of the throat leaving a slightly bitter and really spicy oily aftertaste.  M- Thicker than I expected. Really smooth. Its a nice contrast to the sharp spicy bite of the rye and hops.  D- Decent drinkability. Some alcohol warmth and bitter lingering taste bring it down just slightly.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Beerandraiderfan,4.23,"Damn good beer. Me likey. Probably the pre-eminent rye style beer. You really can't go wrong with a Bear republic product can you?  If I had only one drawback to speakof, well, maybe two, it would be  A) that it seems a little inconsistent. Sometimes it has been mindblowing, sometimes it has been well, very good. B) The grain bill, malt etc. . . seems a little heavy. I dunno whether rye makes a beer lighter or heavier, but I'd be interested to taste this beer a little less out of balance, like a Hop Rod Rye Moster, where the hops predominate. I wouldn't necessarily like it more, but I'd just be interested to see the envelope pushed even further with ryes.  On a good bottle, you'll get plenty of hop brightness, accompanied by the rye. Bad bottles seem to have lost that lovin' hop feelin'. Of course, if they bottle dated, this might not be a problem, the inconsistency would just be age.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BeerAdvocate,4.42,"From BeerAdvocate Magazine Volume II, Issue II:  The brewery describes it as a strong American IPA, not a Double IPA. You have to love the gray area within American styles. Very tiny bubbles are slow to rise but do form a sufficient head that drops stellar lacing on the glass after each sip. Deep brownish-amber color has a slight haze from the hops. Massive hop aroma of sweet citric peel, wild flowers, hint of grapefruit, pine and fresh mint. Lavish creamy smoothness from a deep-seated carbonation and a full body to boot. You'd swear the mouthfeel was massaging your taste buds. Both the spiciness of the rye and hops battle it out with a thick malt character. Hop bitterness never becomes excessively sharp and lays down a stodgy blanket of citric rind flavor. This beer is 7.5 percent ABV? Deceiving for sure. Spiciness of the rye peaks right in the middle, at the same time a heavy hand of caramel and bready malt sweetness flaunts its sturdy foundation. Finishes bittersweet, certainly more bitter, but it never clouds out the malt all the way.  Hop Rod Rye throws the gloves off and comes out swinging with flavor, certainly a snapshot of what American craft beer is about, and we love it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,PDXHops,4.48,"Bomber, poured into a snifter  Pours a deep mahogany with massive fluffy, puffy, ""bumpy"" off-white head. Excellent retention with loads of lacing.  A challenging and complex IPA from start to finish. Pungent pine sap, tingly rye spiciness and plentiful caramel malt immediately demand attention, but there are loads of aromas and tastes to explore. Dark fruits, a hint of sorghum, citrus rind, and fresh baked bread join in as it warms up. It's fairly full-bodied and chewy, with moderate carbonation and loads of lingering bitterness and peppery spice. Very enjoyable beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,woosterbill,4.02,"12 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: Deep, dark, slightly hazy reddish amber body with some floaties; a vigorous pour yields two fingers of light tan head recede fairly quickly, leaving a moderate amount of lace. Solid, but not great.  S: Super-charged hops (I may unconsciously have stolen that from the bottle), some spiciness from the rye, and a rich fruity sweetness as well. Complex and appealing.  T: Hops surprisingly take a back seat here (there I go with another car metaphor), with the grains' spiciness (cinnamon, especially) and sweetness showing up first; moderate alcohol heat after that, and only at the end do the bitter, piney hops show up to apply the brakes of a crisp finish. Quite good overall, but not as intriguing as the nose.  M: Rich, smooth, and fairly viscous with ample, velvety carbonation; this is a great-feeling beer.  D: As much as I'm enjoying this beer, I can't say that I'll be craving another one right away - its combination of spice, heat, and bitterness is great, but only in fairly small doses; I'm glad I opted for the 12oz single rather than a bomber.  Notes: Very good beer, but not quite as appealing as Racer 5 IMO; I'd love to try it on tap someday, and it would be fun to taste side by side with some other imperial reds (Gordon comes to mind). Solid brew to say the least, and one that I wouldn't mind trying again sometime soon.  Cheers!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Greggy,4.37,"A- Pours a massive billowy creamy white head over a beautiful yeasty-hazed red body. 10 minutes into the beer, the head is still a large fluffy cap.  S- MMmmm.. Grapefruit city here with ample hops. Also loads of the obligatory pine. Not a ton for rye, right off the bat here.. we'll see what develops, later in the glass. As the glass empties, there is a large amount of biscuit malt that also comes through.  T- Hello delicious-nous. Starts off with a nice piny dry malt background with hints of rye. The finish is quite dry with a residual biscuity malt present.  M- 8% gives this a very thick body, which it should. The finish is quite delicious, as well.  D- For an 8% beer, wow, this goes down quick. I'm not sure how extremely fresh this bottle is, but I'm sure I'll be getting this again. Think two hearted, a hair more alcohol, and a bit of rye.

610,3158,WeedKing4,4,"22oz bomber. Pours a dark ruby brown. Maybe I had a bottle past its prime, but I was pretty disappointed with this. With all that I heard about the Hop Rod Rye, I was looking for a lot more. Its a decent beer and very easy to drink, but nothing stood out to me. Again, maybe I need a fresher bottle, but pretty big disappointment with this one, considering how much I was looking forward to it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,devilben02,4.08,"Deep, burgundy color with a thick, frothy head. The aroma is certainly hop-filled, with notes of pine and citrus, but it is also much sweeter than I would have expected with a big caramel sweetness. The flavor is bigger and bolder than the aroma suggested, with an earthy, grapefruit hop bitterness that is solidly balanced against an underlying caramel malt sweetness. In contrast to this balance, the bitter hops are dominant in the aftertaste, which effectively masks any hint of the 8% alcohol. This ""specialty ale"" is medium-bodied and nicely (but not overly) carbonated, but despite this solid mouthfeel and largely balanced flavor, it's the overwhelming bitterness in the aftertaste rather than the higher alcohol that makes this one almost more of a sipper than a session beer. That said, I still happily plowed through this bomber in no time.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Philabeerphia,4.28,"Badass motherfucker, right? The beer doesn't bow in heavy homage to many other examples of the style - it blazes its own path. The first time I drank HRR a few years back, it was just one of those moments... beer can be so much more!  The beer settles frothily from the bomber into the chalice. Murky hues of brown, crimson - almost violet - and topped with a tanned cap of churned bubbles that lazily dissipate. Thick and soupy, dark and intimidating.  Smells like a trip to the bakery: pumpernickel, rye and sourdough bread are front and center. A bit of wild champagne yeast makes an appearance, backed by some mildly sweet molasses. A zesty citric hoppiness shows up along with pine and earth. An herbal wisp of medicine closes the show in my nostrils. OK, not overpowering, but unique, complex and very pleasant...  Creamy from carbonation on the tip of my tongue. Caramel, orange zest, and ripe tangerines are all playing around towards the front. Surprisingly bright. Deepens into wheat and other whole grains...coats the top of my mouth and is deeper now. I'm tasting sweet notes of cherry and tobacco, combined with plenty of citric hoppiness. Bright again.. I swear I'm chewing on ripe tangerines. I'd put money on it. The hops heat up nicely in the back of my mouth. The resin hangs in bitter coats on my throat. Great mix of oils, sugars and spreading carbonation. The MF is the character that makes the package.  Grainy, citric, earthy, dark sweet big complex. I really enjoy this beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,TheFlern,4.2,Appearance: Pours a nice amber with plenty of white head that stays. Lacing is decent  Smell: Very muted hop aroma that is sweet.  Taste: Even more muted. Its nice but not nearly enough to leave a good impression.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and finishes nicely. Carbonation is just right.  Drinkability: Its a heavy beer but doesn't pack the taste punch I was hoping for.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,beerwolf77,4.5,Poured into my imperial pint glass the beer is dark red brown with orange hints around the edges. The head is a full inch of mocha hued creaminess. Gobs of sticky lace cling to the rim.  The aroma is full on hop assult.Plenty of grapefruit and pine sap. The rye is is also very present. Like fresh bake rye bread dipped in sour fruit sauce. Not sure how that would translate litterally but as as beer goes it's heaven.  The flavor is unique for sure. Super charged hops followed by malt and smoothed out by a real nice rye bread tone. I love rye bread and hops so this just makes for a great mix of flavor.  Medium to full body that's very chewy and stout.  Very well put together beer here. I can see why everyone seems to love this stuff. I will keep my eyes open for this one in the future.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Each sip begs my to drink more.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Lldeegan,4.03,"Poured into my New Belgium globe. Pours a dark brick color, great clarity. Has a nice off white head that sticks around and leaves nice lace, this beer looks like a Dubbel, but one whiff and you will not be mistaken, it is a beautifully smelling IPA. The nice pine and floral notes that Racer 5 has are a bit more subdued in this American IPA from Bear Republic, it has more of a malt presence. Once you taste it, wow it makes it's hop prescence known. The taste is the aroma times a hundred. At first the piney hops take over, but then blend beautifully with a malt character that creeps to the front of the palate as the hops bring their bitter to the sides. Some of the grapefruit I expected is on the backend as the brew leaves the palate with a crisp but lingering bitterness. This is a medium to full bodied beer with a bit of a slick oily mouthfeel. As I continue to drink it, that head still stays, making this a very nice beer to stare at up until the very last drop. The aesthetic enjoyment of this beer is right on pace with the taste. As the beer warms a bit the hops become toned down and the malt is more present, and as it unfolds, it remains a very complex beer. This beer is delicious enough to keep drinking, but I feel this is best suited as a single to be paired with a chicken or meat dinner, it will most certainly add to the sensory experience especially as it develops over the course of the meal. Perhaps grab the 22 oz. bomber and split it with someone over dinner, definitely a good choice for a BYOB spot.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,infi,4.08,"22 oz. bomber - poured into a snifter.  Beautifully pours a dark caramel color with hints of red when held towards the light with an initial fat white head sitting atop that slowly falls to a thin layer. Visible carbonation streams and spotty lacing throughout and around the glass respectively. The smell is very malt and hop balanced. Initially, the sticky-ickiness of the hops hits at first but then sweet aromas from the malt emerge. There's slight hints of citrus after some vigorous swirls of the glass, but nothing more. Mostly pine hop and sweet malt.  Taste echoes the aroma as the pineyness from the heavy hops immediately comes into play and transitions beautifully into the caramel malt sweetness. Great balance of flavors and very straight-forward. Bitterness all over the place in the aftertaste, but lingers for just a few seconds, and the alcohol is subdued enough. No palpable taste but the burn as it goes down is definitely felt. Also, the rye is actually more prevalent in the aftertaste along with the citrus than in the initial taste. Very nice overall.  Mouthfeel is extremely creamy. Just about medium-bodied with fairly low carbonation. Very smooth drinking for an IPA. Not much of a crispness to the brew at all, but more like a porter. Admirable in mouthfeel for sure. Drinkability is deserving in that this is a classic template IPA with the pine, malt, citrus and subtle spice. Evenly balanced and each component shines very well in presentation with nothing being too overpowering. I'd recommend this to someone who is trying to get into IPA's. A great West Coast IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

This quickly is blasted away by the citrus and piney hops. There is a little spiciness there as well (I think maybe from the rye).  M- Smooth and slick on the tongue with a medium body.

S: Great citrus (especially grapefruit) smell with the characteristic aroma of hops; present, but not overpowering like most IPAs.  T: Wow. Huge taste of hops that provide a powerful, bitter bite. Citrus fruits coupled with a strong herbal medicine taste that is, amazingly enough, not off-putting. Rye malt is there and complements, not conflicts with the hop taste.  M: Nice juiciness which provides a full-bodied and refreshing blast.  D: This is excellent; an IPA that is at once very much a highly-hopped ale, but not overpowering in aroma and taste like other domestic IPAs.

S: Very nice balance of malt and hops... but the hops win out in the end. Interesting.  T: Malt is quite prominent with a good amount of sweetness at the beginning, then, of course, it finishes quite bitter and dry with the hops. The rye is detectable in the background, providing for a different type of taste than I'm used to. I really like it. Long duration.  M: Medium-body with a very creamy texture. Soft carbonation.

610,3158,cptierney,4.43,"I always seem to neglect Bear Republic, even though I live relatively close to their Healdsburg location. I think it speaks volumes about the quality of beer here in Northern California that a quality operation like Bear Republic can fall through the cracks. Poured into nonic from a twelve ounce bottle.  I'm immediately taken with this beer's appearance. Looking more like an English IPA, this beer pours a dark amber. The off white foam on the head is fluffy and very retentive, taking minutes to recede to a thin layer across the top of the beer.  I find the nose on this beer a bit light. I am subject to small piney hints of hops along with a most unusual hit of bready malts. I suppose it could be the rye I'm smelling, but I get more of sourdough hit than anything.  Perfect marks for mouthfeel. This beer is viscous enough to provide a solid swilling experience but light enough to not overwhelm. The carb bite is minimal and welcomed at the end of a sip.  This is certainly the best IPA with rye I've ever had, and as far as IPAs are concerned I place it second only to the mighty Furious. The juniper affect of the heavy hopping meets a nice orange/grapefruit citrus note, colluding to make a phenomenal hop profile. The malts aren't weak in this brew either, and the tang of the rye stands as a reminder that a great beer isn't made with bittering alone.  High drinkability. The hop oil isn't too sticky or cumulative and a person could easily enjoy three or four of these in a sitting. Hats off to Bear Republic, this beer is a classic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Really sets it apart from other IPAs. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy, with not too much carbonation. The rye and hops leaves my tongue feeling tingly after a sip. Drinkability is quite good.

S- like others, i like the hops smell more than the rye, but it all works well for me. The smell is very light and underwhelming to me.  T- The taste is well...tasty. Not my favorite IPA, but a formidable contender. The rye is not easy to pick out. I think i found it, but the hops are definitely around. You can taste the alcohol pretty well here.  M- Like the smell, its smooth with light bubbles and a light lingering of alcohol feel in the chest.  D- This beer is very drinkable.

I don't quite have a taste for rye, but I think I can pick it out and it is quite a nice compliment to the hops.  M- Tangy bubbly smooth goodness going down.

Taste...lots of piney/citrus hop bitterness (too much for me), followed quickly by Alcohol. Tasted like every bit of its 8.0% ABV. This is no stealth beer. I didn't get much in the way of caramely malt presence others have mentioned (again...different perspective probably).  Mouthfeel...medium to heavy body. VERY Silky.

The rye also adds a spicey kick on the finish. I was expecting more fruity flavors from the nose but the grapefruit really takes over and makes it quite bitter.  M: Mouthfeel is good with a nice amount of carbonation and a slightly oily coating of the mouth but not as big as a DIPA.  D: The bitterness really kills it for me in the drinkability category...I like my IPAs balanced between sweet and bitter.  I'd rather pick up Hopstoopid, Gordon, or DFH 90 for about the same price.

Rye is very noticeable in the taste and brings a dark, spicey quality to a good Double IPA. The appearance and smell was very nice and it's unusual to get these kinds of aromas from a beer this dark.

Appearance is a dark amber topped with a one finger creamy head which dissipated after a few minutes. Smell is slightly bready with a big dose of hops.  Taste is pine and grapefruit over a semi-sweet malty backbone that the rye helps make stand up to the hops. Still loses the battle, but it's nice for balance.

Smell-bready as expected, a whoosh of alcohol and plenty of hops. Lots of aroma.  Taste/Mouthfeel-hops hit with a flourish, piney taste, bready character to the beer, not really tasting anything that distinct that would make me realize it's a rye, but still a great tasting beer.  Drinkability-I had no trouble finishing mine, strong beer but definitely drinkable.  Overall-once again, I couldn't really determine that it was rye based on the taste alone, but still, this is a great beer from a brewer that I've really come to respect.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,Dspohn,4.41,"22 oz bomber into a pint glass.  A. This is a great looking beer. Beautiful amber color when held up to the sunlight and talk about an awesome head! Big, rocky, sticky, impressive retention with great fluffy rings all the way down.  S. Smells very balanced. Not as much rye really until it warms up some but a big grapefruit citrus hop nose with some well balanced caramel malt.  T. Taste is better than the smell even. Strong ass hops but a great malt backbone and the sour/sweet rye taste in the end is phenomenal! Trust me and let this beer get a little warmer before drinking because the rye really comes out and is truly wonderful to balance the strong hops.  M. Feels awesome, perfect carbonation on a nice medium body.  D. I don't want to find out how many bombers of this I could down in a night but the abv is nowhere to be found and the balance is pretty much perfect if you like a nice hoppy beer that has a few extra dimensions. Easily one of the best IPAs I've tried. Highly recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,allboutbierge,4.5,Color is brown and hues are mild and golden. Large flamboyant overflowing white head with high degrees of lace retention. Nose is full but not overpowering...lots of hoppiness but the Rye does a great job of taming it and keeping it in balance. Lots of grapefruit and spiciness in the nose. Toasty rye dominates the finish with a foreground of restrained hoppiness. The slightly sourness of the Rye comes in great play with the mountain of hops in here. The citrus and spicy herbalness is kept in healthy check. Its very drinkable.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ditch,4.68,"After having a Founders' Red's Rye P.A. I had to start trying other rye beers. This is my next, and I must say I made a good decision!  Poured a dark dark copper. Very thick and creamy off white head. Lacing is beautiful and sticks to the glass indefinitely.  Smells of sweet barley and rye with a background of citrus and pine.  Taste is very complex. A little sweet and spicy, followed by the bitterness of a black tea. Hints of citrus and pine come through. Dates and raisins also.  Mouthfeel is great. Carbonation is perfect for this style beer. Perfectly compliments the flavors. Leaves a dryness in the finish.  Drinkability is great, but I don't know that I could call a beer this complex a session beer.

The aroma is unique you get some grapefruit and orange with nice hops, but not hoppy overpowerment.  The taste is greeat and very smooth.

610,3158,bump8628,4.55,"Poured from a bomber into an Imperial pint glass. Bottled on 5/14/09  Mahogany in color with an inch of sticky, frothy, off-white head. Impressive clarity considering this is a bottle-conditioned beer.  Hops jump out of the bottle as soon as it's opened. The aroma is raw and resiny with herbal, spicy, and citrusy hops dominating. A medium-strong malt profile also comes through with spicy rye and medium-dark crystal malts reminiscent of dark fruits and burnt sugars.  The intense taste of this beer is a mix of strong, herbal, spicy, coarse, American hops and a malt complexity comprised of rye, dark crystal malts, and some subtle toastiness. The spiciness of the rye complements the hops nicely.  The rye combined with a lower level of carbonation and bottle-conditioning gives it an exceptionally smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable with well-hidden alcohol.  This is a fantastic beer that may be listed as an IPA, but definitely pushes into the double/Imperial IPA category. The extra malt presence gives it more balance and much more complexity than other IPAs/IIPAs.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Smell: nice collection of citrusy and spicy hops.  Taste: not the hop bomb I would have guessed from the name; in my opinion, this is a good thing. There is plenty of malt backbone to give the hops room to shine; it reminds me almost of a strong dark Belgian. The hops are spicy on the front and remain on the tongue that way, but toward the end mellow out into a nice floral flavor. Great stuff!  Mouthfeel: nicely carbonated, medium body, and very creamy.

610,3158,bamadog,3.42,"Not much else interesting on tap at Fries the other night, so I went to the cooler and this is what I pulled out. Not too bad. Pour is from the bottle to a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a deep coppery/caramel color; comes with a solid one finger head (off-white/lightest tan) that has OK retention and fades to a full, yet uneven, skim; body is cloudy and there are odd shaped clouds and spots of lacing.  Smell: Very weak - I can barely decipher what scant scents I'm smelling - some faint whiffs of hops and grainy rye, but that's barely detectable.  Taste: Nice flavors that are almost pungent; decent bitter/earthy hop presence and the toasty rye flavors combine to make a solid tasting and nicely bittered ale; a nice malty sweetness sneaks in as it warms a bit.  Mouthfeel: mild/soft carbonation; body is smooth and almost creamy; leaves a thin coating on the tongue and roof of the mouth - film feels a little dry, perhaps because of the 8% ABV.  Drinkability: Moderate - I enjoyed the solid bitter aspect, but I really wish there was a smell to compliment and enhance it a bit; other aspects of the beera are solid as well; 8% ABV is a bit high for many of these in a night.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Dark caramel color with a thin head/foam but it sticks madly at the glass. The smell is citrusy hops with nice notes of caramel. The beer is also slightly fruity. The taste is excellent. Right at the beginning the hops show their presence and then I get the caramel from the malts and it switch back again to the aggressive hops. The bitterness is perfect. A very well balanced beer.

T- Pine resin, heavy, gourmet baked bread. A doughiness hits about mid palate before finishing dry and bitter  M- A bit of astringincy in the mouthfeel but not harsh. Becomes a bit heavier and more bitter as it warms.  D- A beer I will drink a couple of times per year(probably during cool weather) and really enjoy it.

610,3158,diamondc,4.87,"The pinnacle of American IPAs, in my opinion.  Drunk from a New Belgium goblet. Beautiful lacing, huge fluffy head, kind of a dark copper color to the beer instead of an expected 'pale'. Head eventually dissipates but leaves a nice cap of foam all the way to the end.  On first sniff is hop .. beautiful, citrus infused West Coast hops. Orange peel, grapefruit pith, with some subtle pine lurking in the background. The smell is intoxicating by itself.  The taste is equally sublime. Perfectly balanced with that huge grapefruit bitterness with the sweetness of the malt coming through. A bit of burnt toast & caramel in the malt. The rye leaves its mark on the aftertaste, the bitter caraway seed-like taste gives this beer another level of complexity begging for another sip. Can an IPA be anymore better??  I wish I bought a six pack of this, instead of a bomber. But then again, the high abv limits you to maybe one bomber or two 12 oz bottles. The expected alcohol burn is non-existant, the hop bitterness doesn't destroy your palate, and the mouthfeel has the perfect amount of carbonation.

Mouthfeel is medium with a good hoppy aftertaste coating left on the tongue, alcohol brings in a good warming effect. Drinkability is good but not great, alcohol might become too much and the piney/woody hops will definitely overcome the palate after one or two of these, still a great IPA and a unique experience.

It is somewhat hazy with decently visible carbonation running throughout, sustaining the well-retained 1/2 finger of tan filmy foam. Spotty lacing streaks the glass.  Smell: Aroma is pretty light, but distinct notes of really toasty, almost roasted rye and slightly citrusy hops. The toastiness almost smells a little smoky, but not in a clear or overpowering way.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The thing I appreciate most in the taste of this beer is that it is satisfyingly bitter without overwhelming the palate. The rye is really toasty and crispy and provides a great backdrop to the hops that to me taste a lot like citrus rind and pith. A little bit of grassiness comes through as well. There's a slight sweetness that also balances out the dry, roasty bitterness, too. The feel is moderate, with some bright carbonation and a sticky residue.  Drinkability: Really high.

Pine and citrus (grapefruit), hint of rye bitterness, very floral. Some toasty malt buried in there.  Taste: Lightly roasty malt up front followed by the punch of rye and hops that linger quite a while. Great balance, quick and smooth transition from toasty and sweet into bitter and hoppy as the flavor develops. After a long while, fades into a very flowery hop flavor. Excellent.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, low carbonation. Not heavy, but not light on the palate. The rye and hops really take over the palate as soon as the malts fade, leaving a fresh and lingering flavor. Would be excellent to cleanse the palate with some strong and creamy blue cheese.  Drinkability: Great. I could have one of these any time. Very well balanced, not overly bitter but definitely packs enough rye/hop punch to make you take your time with it. Sipping slowly, letting the flavor linger.

The taste is rye malt at first. Almost all rye malt with a small bitterness at the end of this first sip. The rye malt flavor continues to show it's self on further sipping. Some good floral hops that seem to be just towards the end of the sip.  The feel is this beer is a light medium bodied beer. It is light on the pallet and goes down pretty well.

From the smell alone, this brew seems to be well-balanced with its fruits and hops.  The first sip is complex and resonates quickly into a perfect bitterness. Reminds me of autumn fruits.  This leaves the palate with a dryness of sorts--as of a nice glass of wine. Captures the crisp hop taste of an IPA--but with a far more interesting and hearty aftertaste.  Tends to leave a slight alcohol resonance afterwards--but it is well in check. I want to take my time sipping on this brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

The color is a dark gold/amber, head is a yellowish cream color and retains nicely.  S- Prominent hoppy aroma with floral and fruit notes. Much more appealing than the appearance, I'm actually excited again.  T- Unfortunately, excitement was short lived. Bitter hoppiness prevails. I don't see the balance from the malt that I'd expect. I'm not sure I really like what the rye is bringing to the table, either, compounds the bitterness a bit, I think. It seems appropriately alcohol-y, but I'm missing something on the malt end  M- It lingers for a little bit, then fades, leaving a little too much bitter hoppy aftertaste  D- Meh. Given the ratings, I was expecting much more. While I'm not the ultimate hop head, I do appreciate many super hoppy beers, this just isn't one of my favorites.

610,3158,SpdKilz,4.38,"Appearance - Poured into a SA perfect pint. Pours a nice, red mahogany color. Honestly it is darker than I would have thought compared to other IPA's I've had. About a finger of head that dissipates almost immediately (since I've typed this) and there is light lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell - A hoppy, floral, and citrus smell immediately hits the nose when smelling this drink. Not an overpowering scent by any means. It takes quite an inhale by me to get the full aroma.  Taste - An immediate rush of citrus and hops that is strong but not overpowering. The taste then mellows into a bit of a sweeter note (just for an instant) then finishes with a nice dryness. Very pleasant taste!  Mouthfeel - One can definitely feel the hop oils as the liquid slides around your tongue. This to me adds more body to it and I would say this has a creamy, pleasant mouthfeel to it.  Drinkability - For an eight percent rating, the alcohol is well hidden (thought there is just a nip of it in the aftertaste) and this is very drinkable. After coming from many Stone products as some of my first IPA's and IIPA's this is not as ""bitter"" and more easy to drink (does not destroy your mouth).

T: Smooth...very session like. Again, nothing really jumped out at me...except for the incredible balance of grainy/wheat malt character and hop bitterness presence.  M: Light to medium body with mild carbonation; great for the style.  D: Very impressed! When I was first handed a mug of this...I really thought I wouldn't finish it. About twenty minutes later...I was wrong.  Overall: A good beer...maybe not deserving of the Top 100, but I can also see the appeal as well.

A nice ruby brown with good carbonation. Has a small tad-off white head.  S: Smell isn't particularly as strong on the hop scale as I would have imagined. I pick up malts just as easy as the hops. It is a very even balanced aroma. I'm impressed. I don't pick up any alcohol on the nose.  T: Very nice hop flavor in the forefront and aftertaste. The malt presence is short and sweet, but there nonetheless. I get a very earthy hop presence with nice citrus notes. Good rye flavor.  M: Good medium bodied rye.  D: Well I could certainly drink more than one, but I don't think I would go out of my way to pick this up again.

S - Fresh grapefruit notes in a strong malt backbone. The rye comes through at the very end. Smells like a good strong IPA, but nothing extraordinary.  T/M - The rye certainly accentuates the piney bitterness of the hops. Very bitter. The grapefruit in the smell is only in the aftertaste. The rye must thicken the feel, because the juiciness i've come to expect from hoppy beers is cut, and it's a little filmy.  D - Too bitter to want more than one, but this is a well made beer to be sure, just not my type.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Morey,4.31,"This beer pours a deep rich reddish brown color with a nice frothy tan head. Nice lace clinging to the glass.  Smell of roasted malts, grains, with some subtle hop aroma in there as well.  Taste is very rich and earthy. Nice blend of roasted malts and hops. The Rye comes through nicely as well. This beer is brewed with 18%, so it comes through better than in other rye beers.  Mouthfeel is nice and chewey.  I could drink a couple of these, but you best take your time because they sneak up on you quick.  Morey's Bottom Line: I'm a big fan of Founders Red's Rye, but this is just as good. I would love to taste them side by side. Highly Recommended!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Very dense head with some bigger bubbles sprinkled around. Head retention is awesome. Lacing sticks like glue to the glass very attractive.  S - Its piney and hoppy with some citrus notes but it is a little more mellow than the bottled version. Some nice sweetness from the alcohol as well.  T - Very great taste, freshness from draft is apparent much more oily and crisp. Piney with a sweet malt balance. The finish is dry, bitter and with grapefruit hints. I really do prefer the draft version as with most beers.  M - Carbonation is a little on the low side. Nothing too bad though. The hop aftertaste is crisp, dry and just plain great.  D - I could probably have 33oz of this stuff before being overwhelmed by the flavors. The ABV isnt crazy but should be respected. Great beer.

610,3158,Wheelinb,4.11,One of the things I always check out is the packaging of a beer. This one has a very cool label. It has the hand drawn look of some of the car magazines I used to read way back in the day.  Deep copper color with a nice white head. Not huge aromas coming off this one but the first flavor I get is the rye then the hops take over.

610,3158,mothman,4.18,"Poured into Sam Adams Sensory Glass  Pours 1 and 1/2 fingers of slight tan head. Color is a dark copper brown. Decent retention, but leaves great lace walls. Some sediments managed to sneak out of the bottle.  Aroma: A big nose of caramel comes off first, and then a ton of floral and earthy hops hit. Seems to have a mix of citrus flavors, but the hops are fairly dominate here. A decent amount of rye is present as well.  Taste: A much bigger rye taste here. Caramel malts. Hops aren't as bitter here as I was expecting, they are mainly earthy tasting. A lot more malty than I was expecting, but I don't mind it.  Mouthfeel: Has a nice bitter bite, but it isn't overwhelming. A little booze shines through at the end, but other than that there is really no presence of it. This beer ends with a hoppy rye, slight dry aftertaste. It is medium bodied with decent amount of carbonation. I am liking the mouthfeel for this style of beer.  Overall, I am liking this beer. It is drinkable and has a big hop flavor but isn't overdone. I shouldn't have a problem with my bomber. I didn't even realize the abv was 8%. This drinks incredible for that high of an abv.

610,3158,Mistofminn,4.42,"Finally got a chance to purchase this in Hudson, WI. Very affordable at $4.99 a bomber too. Here goes.  Pours a clean mahogany color with a lively carbonation. A careful pour produces a large pluming off-white light tan head. Great retention fueled by the lively carbonation. Excellent lacing, nearly the entire glass is coated in it's sticky sheets.  As soon as the bottle was cracked, I could smell the citrusy and fruity hops as well as the spiciness of the rye. Thats pretty much it, although I can detect a hint of the malt base.  The rye very dominant in the taste department. Sour and spicey (sour like rye bread is sour, not ""wild beer"" sour). Unlike the nose, the hops are more piney and resiny than citrusy and fruity. That disappoints me a little, but not too much. It still tastes great.  Strong bite from the carbonation and bitterness. Other than that is is surprisingly smooth. Lively carbonation and light to medium bodied. Easy drinkability.  Rye IPA's are really one of my favorite ""sub-styles."" The only thing that could me this brew better, in my opinion, is if they went with a more fruity hop in the flavor, to match the aroma, to get a more citrusy and less piney taste. I'm not sure if this should be considered one of the best brews in the world, but it definitely gets a strong A from me.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,pokesbeerdude,4.34,"22oz single from Wilbur's in Ft. Collins, around $4.  A: Dark copper, with quite a few red accents, about half an inch or so worth of cream colored head, quite dense looking. Pretty fair retention, and some nice big gobs of lacing. A little darker than most IPAs but still an ok looking beer.  S: Citrus hop profile, somewhat melon like as well, slightly caramel as well as a nice dark bread profile. Rye isn't as present as it is in other rye beers, but still noticeable. Slightly boozey, but really smells nice.  T: Big time hop profile, citrus and pine both with a large amount of bitterness. Almost like biting a grapefruit peel. Malt has a nice caramel presence but the rye really pulls this beer into a new direction. Slight boozey/whiskey sort of tones underneath it. Alcohol is notable for being at 8% but doesn't detract.  M: Dry, this beer is wicked dry, and lingers in the mouth forever. Medium thickness, medium carbonation, and slightly warm from the alcohol.

The smell is mostly a hops, mostly piney, grassy hops with a touch of malt coming through. The flavor is extremely well balanced for such a high abv. Taste starts out with big piney hops and the hops continue through the beer, mingling with a nice malt backbone and just a hint of breadiness.

Appropriate carbonation. Leaves a light coating of malt around the mouth.  D: A very good beer. I'm afraid my bottle wasn't even the freshest bottle, yet this was still a very good beer.

610,3158,albern,3.68,"This IPA is a bit over the top for my tastes. The hop bitterness is quite biting, ultra piney, almost like pine tree residue. The beer looks good, has a nice caramel amber color. The beer has a very nice off white creamy head, good retention and lacing. The nose is very pungent piney hop.  There is no real citrus or acerbicness or fruity burst in the hop to balance out what seems to be just too much really piney, really bittering hop. There is a nice bready malt base underneath, with lots of caramel, lots of full palated malts. I keep coming back to the almost charred quality of the piney hop and how that imbalances this beer. There is almost an oaky or slight whisky quality to the beer as it settles in. The IBU's must be in the stratosphere with this ale. There is a slight ABV throatiness.

There was a bit of lacing, but it dissipated fairly quickly.  S - The smell was dominated by floral hops and citrus as well. Could also pick up some sweetness and a hint of alcohol.  T&M - Taste was very balanced throughout. Hops were up front that were strong but not overpowering, then you could taste the spiceness (probably from the rye), and ended with a perfect malt sweetness that leads to a very balanced experience.

610,3158,Reaper16,4.26,"22oz. bomber served into a Gulden Draak tulip  Pours what initially appears to be a very dark mahogany. More exposure to light reveals Hop Rod Dye to be dark amber. I hate using the word dark twice in a row, but that's what I think of when I look at this beer; compared to other IPAs, this is pretty dark. The off-white head was more than two fingers after the pour, but receded quickly to a 1/2 finger ring. Lacing is soapy and vinous around the glass.  Hop resins are the strongest scent that I get from this beer. The caramel malt backbone stands out, too. The rye isn't pronounced to me, but it peeks through more and more as the beer warms. Perhaps too malty. Nothing about the smell of the look of this beer screams out ""IPA,"" which is part of the fun of this beer.  That strong element of caramel malt in the aroma? Its nowhere near as strong on the tongue as indicated. This is a bonafide hop bomb. Hop resins galore strike a bitter chord on the palate as soon as you take a drink. Grapefruit, the sweet kind, is the prevalent fruit. The more the beer warms the more the grapefruit comes out; while cold its really more of a generic citrus taste. A little bit of lemon zest... not so much lemon flavor but the citrus rind oils. The rye that differentiates this beer lends a wonderful spicy/peppery note on the back end of the drink. The finish is all hop resin and prickly rye, leaving a drying bitterness behind it.  I really like the feel of this beer. Its just carbonated enough to set off the sharp flavors and there is enough body to carry the day. The great finish to this beer commands further drinking, and if not for the relatively high ABV% you would want to climb aboard this Hop Rod for the whole night (yeah, I went there).  I'm a recent convert to the ways of the ""RyePA."" Founders Red's Rye on-tap was a revelation, and while I may like Red's Rye more than this beer the margin between the two is slim. Hop Rod Rye is an IPA that does pretty much everything right: its a hop bomb, has a good bittering finish, has quality malt, is playful, and leads to good ""hop burps."" Kudos to Bear Republic -- I've only had three of their beers so far, and they have all been fantastic (time to go deeper into their lineup, I think). This is going to be a beer that I purchase quite often in the future, and I'm confident that you will think the same once you've tried it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,wheatyweiss,4.5,"Poured from a bomber into an imperial.  Pours a dark copper, light mohagany with ruby tinged edges. Slight cloud, with a smallish head that settles to a cap. Not much for huge pillowy head, but it is 8% so I can forgive this.  Aroma is fruity hops up front with a good solid bready malt aroma. Fruitiness is very apparent and smells sweet and juicy. Hops have a piney back to the aroma, but more fruit than resinous pitch aroma.  Flavor is sweet malt on the front. Malt is doughy, bready and full. Malt yields to hops that are fresh and juicy in flavor. Hops are fruity and very much akin to pineapple. Citrus and pineapple in heavy syrup. Finishes clean and with a very nice snap of dryness from the hops. The malt sweetness is cut nicely by the hops as well as the spiciness of the rye.  Mouthfeel is moderately heavy and creamy. Carnbonation is soft and cask like. It strikes me odd that the last beer I had was in the same mouthfeel area. Slick oiliness remains on the tongue for a brief moment.  The alcohol is very well hidden in this beer. The balance is struck very well between fruity hops and sweet malt. A very nice IPA.  Edit: As this beer warms the peppery spiciness of the rye comes through more.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ocelot2500,4.7,Pours a clear dark amber with a rising off white head. Plenty of lacing on the glass.  Smell is of mostly citrus and floral hops dominating. Some spice maybe from the rye with a slight malt sweetness.  Taste is of the big hop taste up front with a decent caramel malt backbone. The rye is definitely present as I can find a spicy note in there as well. The hops are aggressive in a good way and this is a hop bomb.

610,3158,kegger22,4.03,"A dark amber as it pours into a pint glass. Hardly any head the first time, so I poured the rest of the bomber aggressively and was rewarded with two fingers worth. The aroma was citrus, as expected in an IPA. The taste was a sweet grapefruit. Feel is good and drinkability is also good for an 8.0 ABV.

The finish of this beer is great and really stood out to me.

610,3158,bjacobsen,4.4,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip.  Before I review, I have to share that my first real craft brew epiphanies happened at a wedding in Sonoma Co about 2 years ago. I was drinking Russian River (Santa Rosa) and Bear Republic (nearby Healdsburg) at the rehearsal dinner and reception before I knew how lucky I was. I just wanted an interesting beer and these were the local choices. I was so impressed that I have never ordered a BMC since.  A- Pours a deep mahogony. It is almost black with just a faint redness that makes me want to remind it, ""You're a hoppy, not a malty ale, OK."" Nice off-white head to it with a lace, no doubt from the assertiveness of the hop profile.  S- Floral hops up front with a sweeter, grainier malt scent that was already balancing what was no doubt going to be a tasty beer.  T- Delicious! I knew what it was ( A rye based American IPA) going in to it, but I still love the ""this beer tastes so different than it should"" effect. Reminds me of one of Stone's anniversary ales (Black IPA) that I found to be equally tasty and beautiful. Hoppy up front with a sweet malty(maybe rye incluenced) middle leading to a dry finish. Maybe, just maybe, a bit of warm alcohol lingering.  M- Hop Oils are present with a complimentary grainy-resiny mouthfeel. This has an easy carbonation to it that lends to its element of surprise.  D- I do love the hops, so I would say that this is quite drinkable. It is a tad high on the ABV spectrum but I could/would honestly open a second bomber, if I had one.

Aroma's are abound with hops. I feel like I just feel into hop-heaven if there is such a place. Grapefruit, citrus, and slight pine are also to be noted with a nice sharp rye scent playing in the background.  POW right in the kisser! Hops spring forth in all there glory, giving way to a very welcoming caramel sweetness to balance out this monster of a beer. I loved the introduction of rye into this beer, it plays well with the variety of hops while complementing the slight caramel backbone. Masterful!  Feel was superb. Nice prickly carbonation and full body makes this a big beer by far.  This is a dangerously good beer.

610,3158,boatshoes,4.2,"Bomber purchased at Total Wine after enjoying some other Bear Republic brews at a gathering with friends. Split over dinner between myself and two others.  Appearance- Pours a nice dark amber with a solid two finger beige head. Appears to be a pretty lively beer with quite a bit of carbonation beading up the sides of my glass. Head retains very well but gradually fades. Lots of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass as this beer disappears.  Smell- Piney hops and resin are the most noticeable elements for me in the nose on this one. The hops don't come across as particularly citrusy or floral, but very much more resiny. Some spicy undertones which I'm guessing are imparted from the rye, though I'm not too familiar with rye beers.  Taste- A nice punch of piney hops up front on the palate followed closely by some spiciness and a smoother maltiness that rounds the beer out and takes off some of the edge. A bit of a lingering bitterness that dries out the tongue and keeps you coming back for more , but surprisingly balanced overall.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- I found that the balance in this beer, combined with the late drying bitterness made for a very smooth and drinkable beer. However, I did find the carbonation level to be someone on the high side and the slightest bit prickly.  Overall, very solid beer that I could drink easily in a night and would go back for more.

610,3158,velosuds,4.88,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a clear pint glass. No freshness date. Single purchased at local health food store for $1.85.  A-Pours a deep amber-reddish brown color with a one finger, off-white head with average retention and modest lacing. This beer gives ample reason why all good beer should be poured and enjoyed from a glass. Appearance is almost lustful.  S-Prominent citrus hops with sweet twang from the rye malt, I suspect. 20% rye content makes for a very interesting IPA.  T-Very well balanced, yet complex, IMO. Hops are aggressive without overpowering the taste buds. Nice rye malt backbone in finish is subtly sweet. Very distinctive, even surprising. A real treat. Very reminiscent of He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A., which is a 10% DIPA I love. Hop Rod is much more affordable though. No bitter after taste and alcohol content is not noticeable, even at 8% ABV. Extremely well constructed.  M-Very smooth and extremely well balanced. Carbonation is nearly perfect.  D-Dangerously smooth given ABV. I prefer to sip this one, especially since the taste and drinkability improve as it warms.  Not sure this is properly classified as an American IPA. At 8% ABV, it approaches the DIPA style. Moreover, it is vaguely similar to Arrogant Bastard Ale, which is classified as an American Strong Ale. This is one of my favorite ""specialty beers.""

610,3158,mwa423,4.74,Pours a solid two fingers of head with lacing that sticks to glass. Color is a very clear dark amber. Lots of pine and citrus on the nose with some sweetness from the rye.  The taste is fantastic with the rye malt really bringing out the citrus hops. The rye has a bit of a caramel aftertaste on the very end.  Overall this is a strong beer that really hits the taste buds hard and while I could drink the four pack the hops would numb the tongue after the second.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,OldSchoolGamer,3.83,"I will admit, this used to be my favorite beer about a year ago when I first got into craft beer. But for some reason, I never really drank it very often. Since they decided to release it in 4-packs, I decided to give it another go.  A: Pours a real deep amber, almost brown color. Very clear. Head is tan and leaves nice lacing on the glass.  S: Smells rather sweet. Lots of caramel and notes from the rye. Hops seem somewhat earthy and floral. Not very strong, but pleasant.  T: Good, but not nearly as good as I remembered it being. This is not a complex or overpowering brew at all. Very balanced and somewhat on the sweet side. Hops are very subdued but exhibit flavors of citrus and some earthy hops. Malt is much more prominant with caramel and rye flavors dominating. Bitterness is very tame. Somewhat flat tasting compared to some other IPAs I have had lately.  M: Medium bodied. Somewhat creamy. Finish is very clean with some crispness.  D: This does drink rather easily. A little heavier in the mouth compared to some IPAs, but still drinks very smoothly. Could drink a few in a session.  I have to admit, this one just doesn't hold up. It is still good, but when comparing it to the likes of Founders, Great Divide, or Hoppin Frog, this one kind of loses out. A bit overrated and just seems to lack a certain punch that most great IPAs have.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,sudsface69,4.17,"Appearance - Pours a beautiful, mahogany brown with a fine, off-white head  Aroma - Complex. Dark fruit, touch of pineapple, brandy-soaked cherries, bold, funky hops, maybe even a little bit like pumpernickel bread - a really nice, deep, intriguing set of smells going on in this one  Taste - not shy on the IBUS or the ABV. This is a pretty big beer. But, oh boy, what a tasty treat! Bold, hoppy, fruity, almost vinous,...this one really fills the mouth with flavor. A little kiss of sweetness and a touch of a floral thing going on as well. Big, expressive, really nice!  Mouthfeel - Pretty much perfect carbonation for me. No complaints here.  Drinkability - I'm on my first one right now. I'll have to see how I progress through this 4-pack, but as I've usually found out the hard way, if it's sold in a 4-pack there's probably a good reason for that.

This beer has one of the best aromas ever. Very fragrant. Fresh and clean. Spicy, fruity, hoppy, caramel and molasses.  Taste is fabulous. Pineapple, and almost berry like undertones. A nice fresh spicy flavor and a buttery caramel flavor.  Mouthfeel is smooth, perfectly carbonated. Creamy buttery smooth with just a touch of bitterness on the finish.  I can't believe this is 8%.

610,3158,barnzy78,4.41,"22oz bomber shared with my friend, Ken. Poured a reddish-brown color with a towering, frothy creme colored head with good retention and thick, sticky lacing. Aromas are bold rye malt, caramel, and grapefruity citrus. Taste reveals loads of rye up-front which immediately tingles the tongue with a peppery effect; caramel and bread crust also present in the bold malt base; hefty dose of citrus and pine provides assertive bitterness. Mouth-feel is medium bodied with a nice oily resin towards the finish. Balance is tremendous here and really channels all the flavors across the palate. Although complex, it comes across simple, which aids its drinkability. Alcohol is well concealed. It's been awhile since I had this one and is definitely one I will go back to again and again - great quality ale.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Smells of resiny hops, sweet caramel and rye, alcohol fumes  Taste is hops up front followed by the hint of rye and malty sweetness with a lingering bitterness that hangs on the tongue. Very well balanced.  Oily mouthfeel that tingles all over and sticks to all parts of the mouth. Medium body.  Great drinkability for an 8%. Taking it slow though.

A: Really nice sweet hoppy aroma. I get some citrus, mainly grapefruit and sweet orange, but I also get some big bready malts, maybe some honey, and alcohol.  T: Taste is pretty good, very malty IPA. Sweet malts, and the rye upfront and then the citrusy, and grassy hops make there presence felt at the back end. Finishes very bitter and dry.  M: Medium body, creamy. Good amount of carbonation gives it a little kick.  D and overall impression: Drinkability is above average, could have a couple of these bombers. Overall, this is one fine IPA.

610,3158,BARFLYB,4.05,"Thank you Bear Republic for putting these out in 12oz bottles, i've been waiting to review this because im leary on the freshness of bombers.  A- Hop Rod Rye is darker than your average IPA. This has a dark copper look almost looking like a lager. A nice one inch of off white foam rises up & sticks around a bit before settling down. OK lacing.  S- A delicate balance of hops, rye and malt, well balanced. The hops give off a slight citrus vibe while some sweet malt gives off caramel, not overkill though. Some light spice blends well with the rye.  T- This fresh bottle displays all the ingredients in one swig. I get the citrus hops backed by the malt followed by rye. The rye is not as prominent as I remember it from bombers years ago, but a good amount is here. Getting some toasted bread from the malts plus grains.  M- A pronounced medium feel from this, HRR is a bit thicker than your average IPA as well. The carb addition is not high and melds well within the body. The finish is spicy with a soft bitterness and dryness.  D- Not sessionable, but I would do 2-3 12oz in a night if I focused on it. Now that these come in a smaller package, I will be bying more of it on a semi regular basis here and there. Im not blown away by HRR, but this is a damn fine bier.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,madtowndmb1,4.65,"I have been looking forward to trying this beer for a while and it did not dissapoint! Poured a darker gold with a nice white lace. The smell wasn't as Rye as I thought it would've been. Sweet though. The taste was honey sweet, very delicious, and there was a touch of bitterness maybe from the rye instead of the hops. Extremely drinkable and the price can't be beat!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,cmoon,4.18,"Poured this from a 22 oz bomber into a large glass mug made to fit. Appears as a dark amber, but in lower lighting can appear completely black.  The smell and taste is complex, the smell being more subtle--a sort of roasted grain sensation. The taste is heavy and perhaps off-putting to any one who isn't a fan of coffee of darker beers. There's an initial clean hit of hoppiness that quickly gives way to the rye taste eluded to in the title. Like Arrogant Bastard, this really doesn't belong to any particular style, so expect to be surprised by the heavy complex taste.  The beer has an oily texture to it that clings to your mouth. It might be good to pair it with something else (some sort of food, or a glass of water) to help offset beer. Here's where the comparison to coffee comes again, because like a good, rich cup of coffee, sometimes it is overpowering and you need something to cleanse the pallet before having more.  The Hop Rod Rye is a magnificent beer, but also characterizes both the strengths and weaknesses of the Bear Republic brewing company. These folks make make strong, distinctive beers that are highly individualistic and uncompromising. They also, often have a lack of polish to them that you've probably come to expect from a lot of other beers. The Hop Rod Rye is probably an 'acquired taste', but given time, this one has more to offer than just about any other beer in its price range ($4).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Great lacing, head sticks around as a thin cap to the somewhat hazy body.  Smells A little sweet with some floral hop aroma. Notes of sour rye malt. a bit of maple kicks up the sweet side. A quite pungent odor.  It has that sweet rye malt taste that is absolutely balanced by the prodigious use of hops. Hops are zingy and tongue tingling throughout the finish. The rye malt isn't exactly my cup of tea, so this was only slightly above average for me. A bit of bourbon also becomes apparent as it warms.  Mouthfeel is good, not great. Not creamy, but right what you would expect from an IPA. Like i said, tongue-tingly in and throughout the finish. Slightly bitter, not overly so.  Drinkability is good. I guess it all comes down to how much you like the rye malt flavor. I probably won't seek this one out again, but i will enjoy the rest of the bomber, thoroughly.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,BDLbrewster,3.43,"Thank you Damienblack  Pours an oily-sap like shade of reddish amber, about 65% visibility. Small head from a violent pour, soapy lacing all around.  Smells of rich rye up front along with syrupy, pine resin hop notes. If you dig deeper, there are also sweet sugary notes down there as well.  Toffee and super mild caramel right away, followed by a moderate punch of balanced grapefruit pith and pine resin. The ample hop crunch overshadows the rye flavor I was hoping for, it is indeed there, but just not as upfront as I was looking for after smelling this one. Nicely rounded bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel was a huge let down. Almost no carbonation to speak of. Not very syrupy (good thing,) and medium bodied which was nice for the style. But virtually no carbonation once so ever.

610,3158,Epicedion,4.7,"22oz bomber poured into an oversized wine glass.  A: Deep, dark amber, almost brown. Bright carbonation creates a thinnish head that lingers. I liked the wine glass for this one, since it let me agitate the beer and bring more carbonation out.  S: Not very powerful. A little fruity, and a little sweet. Some alcohol. Nothing stands out as remarkable, but it's kind of nice and mild, so I give it good marks.  T: Very earthy. There's a blend of sweet fruit and sharp bitterness. For some reason it makes me think of a Belgian dubbel. I've had this beer a couple times now, and I really can't get enough of it.  M: Perfect. Sparkly. Medium and smooth. Long finish that remains nicely consistent with the taste of the beer.  D: I could drink this one cold on a hot day or cellar temp on a cold night. Or anytime, really.

Fairly hazy to look through...not too much light peering through.  A sweet, floral hops hits my nose. Lots of sugar on the aroma. A bit of a ""funky"" smell as well that is a bit sour, but I can't dispell what that may be.  Sipping reveals a big hops flavor that is both fairly bitter, but smooth, not too piney. Fairly bitter up front but sweetens up as it goes down with a bit of alcohol coming through. Interesting to say the least. Good floral aftertaste. Yum!  Very smooth ale. Unbelievable actually.

Surprised by the amount of malt in the aroma. Some citrus hops is also detected. I found it well balanced with a solid caramel malt base. Citrus and pine lets you know there is a healthy hop bill. The rye is detected in the finish with an exotic spiciness. No hint of the 8% ABV. Found it dry overall. Chewy texture, medium body, good carbonation, and all seemed well matched. This beer manages to balance three distinct qualities between malt, hops, and they rye.

610,3158,drtth,4.5,"Served in an no-nic pub glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: The beer is served with a ¼"" off-white fluffy head capping a clear, dark copper colored liquid and leaving a ring and speckles of lacing when sipped. The head recedes slowly, leaving behind some foam, a think ring of foam and light speckles of lacing when sipped. Eventually there is neither foam nor lacing left.  Smell: The aroma is that of bitter grapefruit and pine hops with a hint of some spice from the rye. It is a pleasant hoppy aroma that invites one to sniff again.  Taste: The flavor has strong bittering from grapefruit and pine of the hops but the dark caramel sweetness of malt tempers the bitterness so that the piney citrusy taste is clearly there but not overwhelming. The spiciness of the rye puts in an appearance and adds to the complexity of flavors in this beer.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is reasonably full bodied and smooth, with noticeable carbonation from start to the end of the beer. The finish is long, spiced by the rye, bittered by the hops and softened by the dark caramel of the barley malt but despite the best efforts of the malt the finish is dry and bitter.  Drinkability: I've had this one before from the bottle and will be going back to it again. In fact it was the bottled version that led to my fondness for beers made including rye malt. It would be easy to consume two or three of these in an evening and the flavor and aroma guarantee I'll be keeping this one on my shopping list.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Personally, I like this a lot more than Bear Republic's Racer 5 IPA and Red Rocket Ale.  A - Beautiful deep amber color which was surprisingly clear for an unfiltered beer. Nice head and lacing that would be perfect with more retention (I know that I'm splitting hairs on this point).  S - Gorgeous hop presence and very promising malt and caramel aromas.  T - This beer delivers on every bit of flavor hinted at by the aroma. I really don't know how better to put it. Exceptional finish' as well.  M - I love the fullness and richness of this beer. The somewhat mellow carbonation accentuates this perfectly.  D - This beer is delicious, but it is slightly heavy and the 8% APV could definitely sneak up on you.

610,3158,NittanyBeerFan,4.83,"Poured into my Duvel tulip glass...  A: Pours a dark combination of mahogany and molasses with a nice thick inch of head perched on top. The lacing is gorgeous.  S: Scents originating from the rye base flow freely through the aroma. They couple with a truckload of citrus hops. Mainly grapefruit. Roasty caramel malts and pepper come through with the rye. There is a promising pungency emanating from my glass.  T: MMM...Delicious. First off, the alcohol is extremely well masked. Next this beer is incredibly balanced. The grapefruit jumps right out at you as soon as you sip. The roasty malts and spices come through later and leave an incredibly satisfying taste on the pallet. The hop bitterness is just enough to tingle the tongue, without crushing out the other flavors.  M/D: The mouthful is nice and sticky, medium to high carbonation. You get exactly what you would expect from looking at it and watching it pour.  I don't know if I have ever had an IPA quite like this. The rye base adds an unreal element to the beer. The complexity is through the roof, as the brewer must have gone insane to mix the proportions of these ingredients. Its part IPA, part winter warmer (?), part DIPA, and all delicious.  To think that I paid $5.49 for this beer, and I got the worst deal on the entire page really says something about this beer. For the price, you'll have a really hard time finding an IPA that even comes close. This beer has the entire package. Delicious, balanced, and complex.

610,3158,asabreed,4.53,"Bomber into a pint glass.  Appearance: A deep amber color with awesome hop floaties, which I'm a sucker for. Give me something to look at in the beer, whether it's yeast or hops, just not spiders or bugs or anything residual that's not supposed to be in there. A dense and rocky slightly off-white head sits atop the body of the brew, and it's one of the best jobs of retention I've seen with foam in a while, especially with an IPA. Gobs of lacing's left in thick, mustache-like rings  Smell: Juicy and pungent citrus hops, with a peppery and spicy backbone lingering and ripe orange and grapefruit, along with the spiciness from the rye, made for a heady bouquet of flowery, sweet, citrus goodness all around. Balanced as hell, but it has a nice bite to it also.  Taste: Way too easy to drink, but balanced and rich in hops and bitterness. The juicy grapefruit and orange come out here, mixing with the acidic bitterness, which lets some lighter tropical fruit in also. Leafy flowers and candied fruit come in as it warms, and the finish lingers between sweet, estery malt, and bitter citrus rind for a long battle over the taste buds.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a great fullness and creaminess from the carbonation, which you can suspect from looking at the amazing drops and sheets of foam all over the glass.  Drinkability: Believe the hype. It's beers on the top 100 like this, which you can get for under $5 a bottle, that really make me excited about some beer you can get at your fingertips that's so above and beyond your average brew. The fact that the price is so low, in addition to the quality, not to mention the slightly high but not-too-high ABV, make it something that should probably be a huge staple in my future.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,nicnut45,3.44,"Appearance- Pours a beautiful dark ruby red. Nice off white halo, and a soft head coats this beer. Lacing is maintained throughout.  Aroma- Not as big as I thought it would be. I think the rye aroma kind of subdues the hops in these beers. Theres your typical citrus aromas, but this kind of has a danky earthy rawness to it, and it is muted. You have to splash this one around just to get a whiff.  Taste- Earthy dirt like tastes take over. The rye in this contributes to the somewhat unpleasent bitterness. Although I have to say the alcohol presence isnt offensive whatsoever. I have to take a big whiff to draw any other flavors from this. The rest is just some mild sweetness from the malt.  Mouthfeel- Average at best, medium to low carbonation.  Drinkability- I was really looking forward to this beer due to the high ratings on BA. But I am sad to say I will not be buying this one again. Maybe it is just west coast IPA's they seem overly bitter with no hop taste or good aroma.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Overall a strong hop profile and a nice spicy flavor that is enhanced by the rye.  Lightly carbonated with a sonewhat dry finish.  Overall, this is a classic in my book.

The grainy malts fail to cut the waves of bitterness that hit all areas of the palate, starting on the front of the tongue and moving slowly to the back where it will remain until the next sip. I don't mind the lack of balance one bit. A very tasty beverage.  M- A medium-bodied feel with mild carbonation. It's light enough to offset the intensity of the flavor, which adds to this beer's drinkability.  D- The heavy bitterness from both hops and rye make this just a tad heavy on the stomach. I could probably have two in a sitting but no more than that. The 8% ABV is hidden exceptionally well and I could see this one really creeping up on you if you're not careful. I've had a hankerin' for a highly-hopped beer and Hop Rod hit the spot.  Glad to see this one in 4-packs.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Tolnik,4.3,"This beer was a first for me so I am not accustom to a rye beer. Overall it is a great beer if rye is the desired drink. The darker reddish, orange hew of coloration produced a fair amount of head that trailed off to wisps to tantalize the palate. The Fresh hops smell of the beer wanted to make me take it camping where the woods smell of pine would fit in. Overall the taste was that of vanilla.

S: Piney hop smell that makes a hop head's mouth water.  T: Tarty, piney, hop flavor that is tempered nicely by a strong malt base. Ends with an ever so slight hint of vanilla taste.  M: Thick mouthfeel over the front and middle of the tongue that dries out in the back/end.  D: Well, I could drink this all night long except I'd be laided out pretty quick.

610,3158,JoshuaJ,4.28,"Pours a gorgeous deep mahogany with a rich, creamy head and thick lacing all the way down. Off to a good start.  At first, the nose is a bit weak. Faint aroma of grassy hops and sweet malt. As it warms, caramelly malts and the spicy rye make themselves known.  Taste is good. Really good, in fact. Bitter hops are at the forefront at first, but as the beer warms, they fade a bit to let the caramelly, malts through. The hops come back at the end and it finishes dry and crisp. Strong flavors throughout with a lean toward hop dominance. At first, I didn't detect a large rye presence in the mouth, which is unexpected, considering...well, that's kind of the point with this one. But as it warmed, it comes out very nicely with it's sweet and spicy flavor, tickling the lips and warming the throat and belly.  This is a full bodied beer. Thick and smooth. And this is exactly what it claims to be: A bold, strong, badass American beer. Personally, I'd classify it as a hopped up rye beer before an AIPA, but that's beside the point. I'll drink this anyday.  Notes: Let this one warm up. It's good cold, what with the hoppy bitterness pummeling the taste buds, but it becomes much more flavorful and complex as it sits in the glass. That hot and sweet rye is a little shy at first, so give it time to come out and play.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Sweet caramel and nutty scented malts hits first, which is usually what pops out first with a big hoppy beer. Sweet red fruits and a very leafy-bitter aroma with gentle edge of rye.  A very nice balance of heady malts, pretty sweet with gentle caramel and very dry from the yummy addition of Rye! Red fruits are in the hops along with a very nice leafy edge.

A - A deep copper, almost brown color with a very slight haze and a moderate beige head. This beer leaves behind a very nice lacing.  S - A nice firm earthy, rye aroma with some piney hops mixed in.  T - A very balanced beer with both a rich malt and a citrusy bitterness. I love the way the caramel and earthy malts intermingle with the characteristically west coast hop flavors. I tend to prefer the hop bombs but this one has it all and makes it work.  M - A substantial, creamy beer with just enough carbonation to do the job.  D - This is one of my favorite beers.

The aroma that's being presented is citrusy alongside the smell of the malt backbone.  Taste: As it hits the tongue the carbonation starts to release a slightly sweet malt. The alcohol makes a quick appearance on the way down the throat. On the aftertaste is a nice bitter ending with the hops coating the mouth. A very pleasant earthy and citrusy taste present themselves.  Mouthfeel: A medium bodied beer with a good level of carbonation.  Drinkability: My first beer from Bear Republic, and it's a winner.

There is a nice undertone of caramel malts.  Wow, the malts are fighting a losing battle, here. Huge notes of pine and grapefruit attack first. Other citrus hops notes follow. The rye spice comes to the surface, briefly. The finish is bitter. Quite harshly bitter, IMO. I find this to be way too out of balance.  Great medium body on this one. Very smooth with a light amount of creaminess sneaking in. Quite nice.  Sorry, but for me the hop bitterness is extremely off-puting.

610,3158,GilGarp,4.03,"The bottled date appears to be 3/27/09.  Pours into my Sam Adams glass a dark coca-cola color with good clarity and thin off-white head.  Aroma is hoppy, even from a distance. Upon closer inspection it has a nice brown sugar smell mixed with piney hops.  Flavor is rich in both malts and hops. At first it's just sweet in a nice brown sugar and carmel kind of way. The rye must be contributing to the flavor in this way but I can only assume as I haven't had many rye beers. As I move it around in my mouth some, the strong bitterness from the west coast hops comes forward. There's lots of pine but it's all kept in check by the malts. It's a bit roasty at times and not entirely what I expected but it's good nonetheless.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and sweet with a smooth, low carbonation feel. Drinkability is good but it's not my favorite.  After having the Racer 5 several times, I expected this to be an amped up version but it's really quite different.

610,3158,alleykatking,4.45,Got this is in 2 trades here. This one is from mjl21...thanks Mike!  A- Poured in a pint glass. Nice dark dark amber beer with 1/4 off white tannish head. Good sticky lacing that clung to the glass.  S- Nice piney hop smell to it. Tons of sour rye undertones to this which I expected. Kind of a sweeter underbody to this as well (both malts and hops).  T- Nice bitter hop bite to this. Big pine taste along with some sweeter citrus hops as well. A little bit of malt background but this is overpowered by the hops. Of course a nice rye taste at the end. Little alcohol feel to it.  M- Good medium mouthfeel to this. Nice pine hoppy taste that coats the mouth and leaves it after the sip. Along with the hop taste the rye sourness always sticks around too. Good carbonation that leaves the beer moving good over the tounge.  D- This is a very drinkable beer that I love. I am starting to be more into rye beers and this is a fantastic beer for the style. I will be looking to trade for this again very soon.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

A touch of sweetness in the backbone but thoroughly pummeled by the hops. Tons of traditional sour rye flavors as well.  M- Medium bodied with nice carbonation.

The retention and lacing are out of this world. Mountains of foam cling to the glass indefinitely.  It smells amazing too. Candied pineapple, white grapefruit, rye, pine resin, and flowers.  The flavor from the rye is HUGE... probably because it comprises 18% of the malt bill! Delicious! Also, there are nice floral and caramel notes and SO MUCH grapefruity goodness happening here. It turns very pine-resiny going into the finish. This really tastes exactly like what it claims to be: a hoppy beer with lots of rye in it. You have to appreciate truth in advertising.

Equally spicy and fruity aromas lead off... pineapple, spicy wildflowers, geraniums.  T: Classic hops fruit bitterness unites with a rustic rye spiciness. Flowery and a touch piney.

Definitely different. I like it a lot.  M- Creamy, medium carbonation, pretty good body for an IPA.  D- Pretty good, although high ABV kind of hampers it a little. Definitely a good sipper.

I know this is a rye IPA, but I wasn't expecting it to be quite this dark and foreboding. About a finger of off-white head with large bubbles. Doesn't hang around too long.  Smell: Smells fairly hoppy. You can definitely smell the rye and some malts along with it. It definitely isn't a purist IPA in the hop-purist sense of the word.  Taste: Rye and malts right off the bat. The hops add some bite, but they are nowhere near as prevalent as some prior reviews led me to believe. The bready flavors certainly are coming out. The spicy rye flavors hit on the backside of sip. This is kind of interesting.  Mouthfeel: The rye hangs around. As you lick around your mouth, you still find morsels of that spicy rye. It's a very solid, sticky beer.  Drinkability: This is quite the American IPA. It definitely borders on and shares some of the traits of a Rye Beer.

The malt backbone is solid, being mostly sweet caramel. No alcohol is present in the nose.  Bitterness is at a medium level. The concentrated hop flavor is grapefruit and pine, with some rye, which tastes fantastic. The finish is citrus bitterness and spicy, with a low level of alcohol.  The beer is medium bodied with a creamy, smooth mouthfeel.

Taste is hoppy with a strong malt backbone, somewhat similar to a DFH 90 minute yet not as malty or strong. The finish is bitter and malty. Makes me think of a hoppy amber ale, but somewhat flowery.

Medium and smooth body. Great balance and variety of full flavors. (4.2) Rerate: Deep reddish-brown with a massive meringue-like head that leaves dense lace; I really can't fault anything there. Spiced bread and lots of hops in the nose, with a vivid fruity kick. The flavor has a sweet toasty, spicy and raisiny malt character that it cut by a ton of hop bitterness. The rye seems to add that something extra that sets this apart from your normal IIPA. This has proven itself as one of my favorites of the big, hoppy style.

Head is beautiful, cushiony & meringue-like -- when it sinks it leaves an island. Heavy lacing. Eye-pleasing.  Smells of caramel from the malt, lemon from the hops, rich but refreshing at the same time. Taste is of of maple with a crisp, strong snap from the hops. Caramel is strong & upfront, too. There's a bit of something straw-like, like it tastes how straw smells -- is this the rye I'm picking up?  I like the IPAs with a soft, smooth mouthfeel, & this is one such IPA. I'm not a big fan of the bite that some impart, that attacks the tastebuds. This mouthfeel is like a creamy, smooth hello.

Nice fluffy 3 finger bone white head. Good retention, nice full lacing throughout.  S: Floral and pine notes from the hops, but this one has a real clear sweet bready, caramel character in the nose. Much more so than many other west coast ipas.  T: Great bitterness to this brew. This is what I'm talking about when I refer to balance in an IPA. Floral and pine hops at first break way to a great sweet malt middle - this is where this beer shines - lots of complexity to the rye malt, earthy, bready and caramel - just a tinge of rye taste. Then the bittering hops come round to ram this one home.  M: Mouthfeel is just great. Really smooth and creamy from the abundance of rye malt.

610,3158,merryjoulton,4.75,"Pours a deep golden brown, a little hazy, full white head that sticks around. Smells deliciously sticky, piny, citrusy, fruity, a little bready. Tastes incredibly bitter and balanced well by the garden of aromas. Mouthfeel is perfect.

610,3158,washburnkid,4.46,"A: Super thick, creamy, firm beige head over dark amber and caramel hues. Phenomenal retention and lacing. S: Sweet malts dominated by a rush of hops, but not unbalanced on the nose. T/M: Creamy medium-bodied mouthfeel. Florals and pine, with bittersweet residuals after the sip. Alcohol hides well beneath the impeccable balance. Hints of ripe fruit throughout, with spices making an entrance as the beer warms a bit, maybe from the rye. D: Huge flavors, and stellar drinkability. This is on par with West Coast DIPAs, like Pliny. A quick favorite!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Nick3,4.38,"Gorgeous burgundy color on this beer with a 2 cm head that fades quickly. Beer leaves some great lacing from the start to finish. Nose is citrus and some caramel malts and the rye. Taste is smooth and crisp, which was a bit unexpected after the color. Very easy to drink, 8% abv is well masked. Good carbonation and a medium body lend itself well to the style. Beer is very well balanced through most of the drink with a little hops/rye kicker in the finish. I really enjoyed this beer and would be curious to taste a cask version if one is ever created.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Onenote81,3.86,"Bottle received courtesy of tzanio in a recent trade.  This beer pours much darker than I expected, due to the rye I can only assume. Looks like a tawny-brown tinted amber. Nice inch-sized ivory head on top. Retention is firm and the lacing rings are superb. Smells of flowers, citrus rinds, bread, and a slight astringent scent.  Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I like, slightly wet as well. I like my IPAs to be crisp, this one was lacking a bit. As I sip, I can definitely pull the rye out of the flavor. It's mild though. I like what it adds to this beer. The definitive hop smack is there and it finishes slightly sweet. I like this. I received a big ol' bomber of this and had no problem drinking it down. Wonderful beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,bfields4,3.88,"Pours a crisp clear amber color dark for an IPA. A nice tight head that refuses to go anywhere (this I really like).  Very piny hop smells are accompanied by nice sweet caramel malts.  Bitterness complements the heavy rye and caramel malt flavors. A very sweet aftertaste.  Not very heavy on the carbonation. A nice lasting creaminess, but not to thick. I would be happy to see this beer on tap any day. Very interesting with the rye and hops.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Arbitrator,3.37,"On-tap at BJ's in Fremont.  A: Dark brown / amber color with slow carbonation up the glass. Has a half-inch off-white head that recedes within a few minutes into a film on the glass, with some lacing as I drink. Not as impressive as I remember the bottle being.  S: Pine and grapefruit are the two strongest aromas. I also smell some caramel malt. A little rye and grass.  T: Hop bitterness in pine and grapefruit varieties smash the mouth up front. Floral hops are also detected in mild quantities. The mid-taste sees an evolution of caramel malt and small rye bite, but it's nowhere near as strong as it was in the bottle. The finish is all sticky hops, with a dry aftertaste.  M: Medium-bodied, with low carbonation and a very light rye bite. Slightly oily and has a very sticky flavor.  D: A quality IPA on tap, but if you hadn't told me it was supposed to have rye in it, I might have missed it entirely. I may stick to the bottle on this one...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

S- I can tell I am really going to enjoy this one right off the bat -- bitter hops, a bit more citrus than pine, balanced very well by sweet caramel.  T- Very similar to the smell, kicks you in the face right off the bat with some pretty killer hops, pine and grapefruit, then mellows to a very sweet caramel. The alcohol is present in the aftertaste, but very well balanced.  M- Very strange, almost sticky feel to it. Extremely smooth, and definitely on the thick side.

I taste super bitterness and grapefruit hops. medium bodied, medium carbo. Good good brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Bcaulin,4.42,"Served from bottle into new Sam Adams glass.  Excellent deep mahogany color. Deep reddish brown that looks great when held up to a light. Nice head that had pretty good retention. Great lacing.  Tons of hops in the nose. Much more than I initially expected. Almost smells like a completely straightforward west coast IPA with its citrusy notes. There's definitely a little something extra in there that makes in in its own category.  If you taste it before it warms up (I'm guilty -- I couldn't wait) you really get a great hop flavor, but not a whole lot of depth. The rye flavor really doesn't come out until you let it open up a little. Once it does, it moves into an absolutely great taste. You gotta love hops for this one, but its definitely not a gimmick IPA -- the rye adds a great balance.  Extremely smooth and delicious. I could easily drink a couple of these, and if it wasn't for the 8%, I'd be thrilled to drink more than just a couple.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,lstokes,3.99,"It looked great--poured a deep red with a substantial head, leaving lacing on the glass--but the smell was nothing special for me, I got some hops but not much more complexity than that.  I've never had a rye beer before, so I'm not sure which note the rye was, but the beer was well balanced in terms of hops and malts and a little bit spicy, which must have come from the rye, with a really nice mouthfeel--a high level of carbonation that accents the sweet-bitter aftershock in your mouth.  The beer was--darker and grittier? overall, than I expected. I think I was expecting something very different from what I got, something more like a traditional IPA, but I did really like it--I think I'm going to have to try again before I form a final opinion.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,SykDoc,4.45,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. It pours an interesting amber/red color. A beige 1/4 inch head forms and leaves a spotty lacing over the top and around the edges. No sediment or minimal carbonation is visible after it settles.  The aroma is as the name would imply, primarily hops including citrus and pine notes. There is an earthiness to this that includes some floral-like notes.  The taste is strong with the hops including grapefruit/citrus and pine notes. The malts also provide a sweet backbone. That earthy and bitter component is also there and likely related to the rye. Minimally spicy.  The mouthfeel is very good. There is a nice level of carbonation that highlights the flavor. A healthy bitterness lingers on the tongue as a reminder. This is fairly medium/full bodied and goes down very smooth.  Overall, I was not quite sure what to expect, but it is extremely good. The initial presentation leaved me underwhelmed and then it hit my mouth and wow. The flavors blend very well and it sits so well in your mouth. This beer is amazingly drinkable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,atsprings,4.47,I've been hoping to try this one on-tap since we've been getting Bear Republic beers in NC and finally found it at The Pit. Served a nice crisp dark red with a beautiful frothy head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is a nice amount of malts and rye with a nice hop presence. The taste is a wonderful balance of Rye malts and pine and citrus hops. The beer is quite light and refreshing with the alcohol well-hidden. This one is just as enjoyable as I'd expected.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,youngblood,4.52,"Poured a ruby amber color. Very lively white head stacking up as I pour. Ended with a two finger head. Smells strongly of hop oil, nice pine, bit of spice. Some nice biscuity malt in there also. This has some exceptional flavor to it. Very nice spicy rye backbone, leaves a caramel like sweetness on the tongue. The strong citrus plays nicely with the spice. Feels very creamy and smooth on the tongue. I want to drink far more of these than I have. Overall, this is a heck of a beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,scottyshades,4.15,"A: Pours a nice healthy garnet color that produces one of the fluffiest, billowy-est, longest-lasting, largest-lace-producing heads that I've ever seen. Retention is awesome, but much darker than your average IPA  S: Super hops! The most unbalanced, yet best crafted noses I've come across in a while! Real flowery and perfumey. Its actually hard to describe, but there are either some spices in there, or some spicy smelling hops. You get some rye in the nose, as well as some caramel malts.  T: Again, super hops, but a little more balanced than the nose suggested. Very fruity (grapefruit, orange peel) followed by some sugar. Interesting flavor, I think it may be the yeast, but it tastes kind of like dextrose...  MF/D: A little sharp and bitter, but still very goood!!  One of the best I've had",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,MetalHopHead6,4.8,"Poured into a pint glass from a 22oz bottle.  Beautiful dark copper color that becomes a brilliant near-orange when held to light. Massive foamy head--the best I've seen this side of Orval.  Unexpectedly subtle smell and flavor. Nice bitterness lingers on the tongue. More balanced than the color and alcohol content would suggest.  Bear Republic beers have a gritty hard-nosed feel (like Knob Creek, as opposed to Makers Mark) and this is not an exception; however it is more smooth than Racer 5.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

I hope the 120908 isn't the brew date... because if it is... it's too old to sell and should have been pulled from the shelves long ago... but who knows.. it's stamped on the UPC.  - Much more dark than I expected... a nut brown ale type color with thick creamy head... and lacing gone mad. Looks malty rich and smooth.  - Sweet malt aroma, some bread... sharp hop scent but not bitter... some brown ale notes..  - Wow.. so very smooth and balanced... rye tone with pine hop, and balanced well with a rich caramel malt that isn't too sweet. Not the hop bomb that I expected... but very balanced.  - Slight bitter mouthfeel... very much creamy left overs... like having to swallow the same flem 5 times.... chewy.. bit of resin and oil... but sweet.. aftertaste of the dark little rye breads at Christmas time..  - Very drinkable... smooth, creamy... like a brown rye cream ale.... and balanced balanced balanced.. and not the hop bomb that one might think... a very good rye ale. and a must try!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Very pronounced bitterness, maybe from the rye? Finishes dry as a bone and spicy bitter. Great creamy mouthfeel.  A very unique beer. Extremely hoppy both in aroma in taste.

610,3158,thryn,4.3,"Dark amber, good clarity and lots of carbonation dancing to the creamy-looking off-white head, which is occupying about the top inch of my Otter Creek World Tour glass (which almost a whole bomber will fit in). As I drink it, the head retention is good and there is tons of sticky lace.  Sweet grassy hop in the nose with just a touch of ... biscuit? Something almost funky going on here, too. It's nice, but muted.  Oh, this is yummy. The hops are forward at the start, but then step back and let a nice sweet malty note come through. It's almost fruity, then the bitterness returns with a little bit of spice and sourness as well. This may be the first rye ale I've had that I've really liked a lot. It has a lot of flavor but everything is balanced. The alcohol is noticeable, but barely.  Mouthfeel is a little slick and a little sticky, with medium body and moderate carbonation that seems to emphasize the spicy character.  Very drinkable. I should probably slow down.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

The aroma is somewhat subdued. There is noticeable caramel, but I can't find the hops. The hops are definitely there in the first taste. A nice balance of caramelized malt and hoppy bitterness.

610,3158,mjaseattle,4.82,"Appearance: Poured into a pint glass from a bottle. There's about an inch of creamy, frothy head on top that lingers until you take a sip. Underneath is a deep orange/mahogany beer with a few narrow streams of bubbles running up the sides of the glass. A thin layer of foam sits on top throughout the experience.  Smell: The smell alone won me over. Pine and grapefruit dominate, and something else I can't put my finger on... Something sweet, like maple syrup...  Taste: Just like it smells, but on a higher order of magnitude. There's such a good balance in this beer, an obvious smattering of hops at the start, with a mellow undertone of malts that seem to crescendo slowly through every sip. It ends with a bittersweet caramel aftershock, and a citrusy air.  Mouthfeel: There's a burst of carbonation on contact that mellows quickly to a smooth, almost syrupy feel. Pretty full-bodied for an IPA. For a lighter experience, swish it around a bit-- though this does bring out the alcohol presence, it expands your food pairing options.  Drinkability: This is definitely what I call an ""experience"" beer, meaning it is best enjoyed in large, attentive sips. There's a lot going on that you don't want to miss. It will pair well with any strong-flavored food, but it really shines on its own.  Notes... I first had this beer (on tap) a couple months ago at the bartender's recommendation, and was very pleasantly surprised. I'm not at all familiar with ryes, but I know my IPAs, and this is top of the line.

610,3158,joshuadlight,4.51,Split a bomber with my brother while watching the maybe too action packed Quantum of Solace.  This is one of the best beers I've had. The appearance is a dark honey with a frothy magnificent head that leaves some of the best lacing I've ever seen. The beer smells of a malt backbone with a floral bouquet filled with grapefruit. The rye comes through in the taste along with more grapefruit and other citrus notes. Quite bitter and leaves a very nice hoppy after taste. The creamy mouthfeel is nice and there is only a slight downgrade in the drinkability due to the high ABV.  Super offering from Bear Republic. I bought this six hours away in Dallas and wish that I had purchased much more. Its outstanding.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,photomike,4.06,"Pours really, really beautifully into a pint glass. 2 finger tan head that looks pretty much exactly like an english muffin on top of my beer.  Smell is rather light. Malt, vanilla and a bit of whiskey, presumably from the rye.  This is a really tasty beer. Not quite as hoppy as I had imagined it would be, but it was stored unrefrigerated at BevMo for an indeterminable amount of time. Still, the foremost flavor here is hops. Bitter, but not as west-coasty as some of the reviews here imply. The taste is less citrusy or piney than it is oaky or woody...again, I think the rye is at work here. Quite balanced, this isn't overly sweet and not the least bit alcoholic tasting. Very interesting, very complex. I wish my palate was refined enough to pick everything out here.  This is a ridiculously smooth beer at 8%, and somewhat chewy. Very nice.  I can and would drink a lot of this stuff in one sitting. The chewiness might be a bit much after a while, but two bombers of this is not the least bit intimidating.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Clydesdale,4.33,"A: A very deep, somewhat hazy brownish-red. The head is moderately large, densely frothy, and a touch creamy, with a light tan color. Retention is excellent, with some very nice lacing.  S: Rich brown sugar and citric hops - rather sweet orange and candied grapefruit. Some floral and herbal hop notes as well.  T: Very nice. A robust dose of brown sugar and toasted caramel malt up front. This is followed quickly by a strong shot of citric, floral, and vaguely piney hops. Bitterness is firm, but the flavor is quite strong. The rye malt begins to shine later in the taste - a uniquely spicy flavor that sets this apart as more than just a very good IPA/DIPA. As it warms, some note of alcohol show up.  M: A fairly full, slightly sticky mouthfeel. Carbonation is tight and tingly. Maybe it's the rye, but this has an almost absurdly creamy feel for the style before fading into the dry finish you'd expect from this type of beer.  D: A very interesting big IPA from Bear Republic. The rye really makes me happy. Rather than just adding more and more hops, they went for an interesting malt profile that adds a lot to what would have been an already very tasty beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,FallinDeck,3.72,"Body has an amber/ruby color to it. Nice tan head with superb lacing all the way down the glass. The light hops smell didn't impress me all that much. Maybe my sniffer wasn't up to par this day? The mouthfeel was rather heavy, with a dry hoppy/spicy taste. It had a Great lasting kickass spice finish taste. I couldn't do more than 2 pints, so the drinkability suffered there. Here's a first for me... Yes a burpability factor of 10.

Darker than many IPA's, I'm blaming the rye. It's a deep amber almost dark ruby color. A nice inch of foamy head. Pretty clear. It looks nice, but not that beautiful glow of some IPA's.  Smell - Hops. Some definite pine. Also some citrus. But a real malt back there. Definitely an herbal smell. Almost some caramel or burnt sugar lingering.  Taste - Wow, lots of caramel malt flavor. Way more than expected. Almost woody, at times. A sweet semi-caramel or toffee finish. A little hop burn as well, with some of that pine. Very nutty flavor. Almost some pepper.  Mouthfeel - Pretty solid. Good carbonation, good coating.  Drinkability - Not bad, but I'm not in love with the nuttiness. I'll enjoy this one. Also, the pepperiness builds.  Interesting beer, but not a super favorite. Good, but not really great. Was hoping for a cleaner hop flavor.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,YesFest,4.25,"Smells of aromatic hops, bread... A mild pine sandwich.  Hoppy bite, heavy malts. Big hop and alcohol finish, malts are an undertone the whole way, but still strong. Warming up reveals fruit, mild boisenberry.  Mouthfeel is a thorough coating. Thick soapy aftertaste and sweet on the front of the roof of the mouth.  Definitely a sipping brew. The mouthcoating hits on too many different spots like pressure points that it takes a few seconds to mentally digest each swallow.  A strong Rye IPA, definitely not an every day thing for me but a strong showing definitely worth checking out.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,tronester,4.15,"Pours a deep amber/red with a thin off-white head. Smell is very herbal. Taste has abundance of hop flavor, you can really taste the raw, pungent, piney hops. There is maybe a hint of citrus, but this beer is all about the pine. There is a nice sweet malt backbone to match up with the hops. Dry IPA this is not. There is just a hint of spicy rye, rounds things out nicely. The finish is nice and bitter, hop oils coat your tongue. Mouthfeel is super creamy and smooth, very nice low carbonation levels. Drinkability is fantastic, a 22oz bottle is great for an entire evening. I usually like the dryer IPA's but Hop Rod Rye is an excellent choice for a well rounded beer.

610,3158,twiggamortis420,4.28,"Pours a pretty clear deep copper color with a very large fluffy beige head. Sticks around forever and forms a mesa in the middle of the glass as sheets of lace replace the foam that trickles down the sides of the glass. Nice.  Smell is of grapefruit citric hops and spicy rye pumpernickel bread. Some earthy malt notes and raisin reign in the hops to make this a complex smelling beer.  Flavor is very nice. Leans heavily toward a hoppy rye IPA, but has plenty of sweet malts to balance it out and even hold it's own. The hops definitely have a west coast feel, and the flavoring hops might outshine the bittering. A dangerously drinkable IPA that is bold, yet not palate fatiguing. Only issue I have is a bit too much carbonation. The spicy nature of the rye adds a nice element to the overall complexity of the beer. I have yet to be disappointed by a Bear Republic brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,TexIndy,4.65,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. No dating info. It was a reddish brown color with some yeast bits floating around. Also had several carb steams and good lacing. It had a massive creamy light beige head that slowly settled into a thick foam.  The aroma was awesome. Pine, grapefruit and citric hops. Classica AIPA. I'm fighting spring allergies and this just punched right thru it and demanded to be appreciated. It got the taste buds salivating. The taste was also exceptional. Good hop bite from the start. It builds right up to and thru the finish and ends with a nice bitter bite. Towards the end you do get shredded tongue but it's worth it.  Overall, an exceptional beer that deserves the ranking and hype. Highly recommend. This will be a player in the rotation.

A floral hop and grapefruit aroma that was really nice. There was a smooth grapefruit hop flavor with a nice bitter kick in the finish. The malts flavors in this are also very good. The hops do get a little ""spicy"" with the higher carbonation. I couldn't tell if there was a rye flavor as I haven't had to many beers with rye in it.

A thick, sticky lacing is left on the inside of my glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells and tastes of grapefruit, lemon, pine, caramelized malts, spicy rye malt, bread and more grapefruit. Very little alcohol presence for an 8% ABV beer. Just about the perfect balance of malt and hops for my tastes. Somewhere between medium and full bodied with medium carbonation.

610,3158,stingrayvr6,4.85,"Had on tap at Local 44 in Philly. Beautiful amber color with fantastic creamy, off white head. Excellent retention and sticks to very inch of the glass. Smelled oily and citrusy. Incredibly smooth and citrusy, and fruity but sharp and bitter from the hops and mellows out with the rye. Very bitter with a balnaced and lingering finish and strong rye taste in the finish. Absolutely excellent.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,bsend,4,"Poured this 22 oz. bottle into a standard pint.  The beer poured a dark brown color (suprised me a little at first), with bits of amber. A creamy looking 1 1/2 finger off white head formed. The beer was opaque when held up to to the light.  The beer smelled of thick, wet hops. Heavy smell aroma that let me know what I was getting myself into.  The taste was exceptional. Hops were found through out the brew. The 8% abv isn't even noticeable as there is very little alcohol after taste.  The mouth feel was nice as well. The head was a nice introduction to the well crafted beer. I could easily play around with it on my mouth and experience the flavor.  This beer has got the drinkability. The overall hop might kill it from being completely sessionable, but two bombers could easily happen.  Final Thoughts - The more I try from Bear Republic the more I begin to enjoy. I want to compare this to their regular IPA and see how this Rye comes into play by comparison. Definitely try a bomber.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,brewdoc75,4.58,"From a bomber into a pint. Bottled on 11/19/08. Served at 45-50 degrees.  A: Mahogany to amber in color. Brownish hues are present. A bubbly white head fizzes on top. It unfortunately dies pretty quick. This may be my fault however (used too much soap to clean the glass). Solid carbonation.  S: Piney, citrusy hops at first. I do get a slight breadiness and some caramel as well. Really not a whole lot of aroma, but this may be due to the fact that this guy is a few months old.  T: Breadiness, followed by a strong caramel flavor hits the tongue first. This quickly evolves into a hoppy onslaught w/ a predominate grapefruit flavor trending to piney bitterness. As I drink further, the hoppy grapefruit flavors persist. I also really appreciate the malts in this IPA. Toffee, caramel, breadiness, and even some spiciness from the rye. Unique and delicious. A perfect balance.  M: A light to medium bodied IPA. It has a slight stickiness from the hops and the malts. Great carbonation. Finishes clean.  D: An exceptional beer. Quite possibly one of my favorites. It is a solid IPA, but adds an element of uniqueness with the rye. I haven't had a whole lot of Rye-PAs, but this will definitely set the bar for any future beers from this style. I am aching to try this on tap or at least get a fresher specimen to truly experience the hops. This beer is a definite must have for any beer lover.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,CrossansWright,4.38,"Had this beer on cask at Fathead's in Pittsburgh. It was served in a dimpled mug. It was a deep copper color with an off-white head that left some, but not much lacing. I picked up some caramel in the nose, but piney hops were far more prevalent.  First, let me say that this is a really, really, tasty beer. The hops come through beautifully and they are balanced by the caramel flavors of the malt. It seems that this beer is sweet, maybe it's the malt? All I know is it is extremely good. The alcohol is incredibly deceptive for 8.0%, making this a brew that goes down smooth but is also potentially very dangerous.  Truly a wonderful IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Lots of little bubble. Pretty much perfect.  Smell is oranges, grapefruit and pine hops, sweet rye, caramel malts. So delicious.  This is pretty much the gold standard for IPA taste, I might suggest. The first taste to hit the mouth is the sweet rye and caramel malts which is quickly replaced with the big piney, bittering hops. There's some grapefruit and citrus in there, some slight bread notes, some spiciness. It's a big, hoppy IPA but at the same time there is never a hint of unbalance - the sweetness and malts are always there to keep it in check and add other dimensions. Great carbonation gives it a lively feel which is needed in an IPA.  Wow. Seriously. I have died and quite possible found beer heaven. I love West Coast hops and yet crave some balance in the malt section. This is it. I could drink a few of these (though might regret it later at 8%) and it would meet all my needs. This moves to #1 on my IPA list.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

A crisp, pine & grapefruit hop aroma is contrasted by the sweet rye. Nothing overpowering, but a tasty blended smell indeed. Lovin' this taste, I swear hops are not the first thing you taste, it the sweet carmel malt upfront, but very quickly the hops hit you, and hit you strong, providing that bitterness, and citrus character, that contrasts the sweetness very well.

610,3158,taylorhamrick,4.04,"Pours out a reddish color, deep amber, almost brown. And it looks perfectly clear, with a massive off-white head. It looks very sticky and stays around, though it leaves minimal lacing. I don't mind, it's a beautiful beer, though not American IPA look (possibly a bad classification, but there isn't really a good one). The smell is crisp and hoppy. Pungent smell, possibly some C-hops and very resinous high AA% hops in this beer. There's also a noticable sweetness underneath, with the spicy rye. The taste is really nice. There is a definite IPA hop taste, a bit fruity, very resinous, a tiny bit of citrus, not a huge kick of bitterness, which is nice, balanced with nice malt backbone. The rye is noticable, but I'd be interested in just a little bit more there. The alcohol is noticable, lends a bit of a burn. The beer clings to the mouth, leaving a feeling of hops after you swallow, which I prefer, but the alcohol kind of lightens it up, but not too badly. This one is kind of a chore, not for the flavor, but because of the 8% ABV. A good beer, definitely worth trying.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,tmoneyba,4.18,Bottle at The Local. Poured a clear copper color with large frothy off-white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Heavy complex citrus hoppy aroma with a rye tone. Medium to full body with a slick texture. Heavy balanced flavor with a medium bittersweet rye finish of long duration. This is a standout beer and very good double IPA.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Birchgrove77,4.14,"Poured from a 22oz bottle purchased at Binnys and buried in the back of my beer fridge.  A: Very brilliant copper colored with red-orange hues against the right light. Beautifully fluffy creamy mocha colored head that laced from the top of the glass to the bottom.  S: Nice citrusy aromas with the occasional piney notes depending how far you buried your nose into the pint glass. A very distinct sharp, almost acidic, toasted grain character. I presume this is from the 18% rye. A very nice syrupy/malty aroma lingers at the end. An infrequent caramel character also exists.  T: Fantastic! Began with a grapefruit/tangerine hop character which progressed to a very nice piney finish on the back of the palate. The rye provides the a bit of a spice note and a sharp finish. Alcohol presence is very well hidden, somewhat noticeable as the beer warms, but plays well with the rye character. Thought I notice a very slight molasses character.  D: Even though I've had this before, the alcohol snuck up on me pretty quickly. This would be a perfect beer for enjoying the last beautiful day of autumn, or any other time for that matter.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,stephens101,4.33,"A nice-sized bubbly tan head grows quickly above a big blast of carbonation bubbles, then slowly fades, leaving a chunky, spider-webbed lacing all around. Color is a clear amber with some slight reddish hues. Smells of bright, citrusy hops with a malty sweetness lurking behind. Tastes of more big citrusy hops with the sweet malts becoming more aparent on the palate than to the nose. In my opinion, complexity of aroma and taste is not as sought after as is perfection in the hops vs. malts profile when you're speaking of IPAs. This one is ideal, with the sweet malts backing up the hops, but not getting in the way. A sort of malts as Bonnie to hops as Clyde duo; all outlawish and sexy. Goes down nicely and doesn't put the weigh-down on too much, despite its medium body. Possibly the best IPA i've ever had, and I'm completely stoked that it's now readily available here in my neck of the woods.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Vonerichs,4.12,"It poured a clear ruby color with a tinge of brown. I poured this fairly aggressive into a tulip but only got a slight head which departed within a couple minutes and left almost no lacing behind.  This has a very complex smell. There is a brown sugar sweetness, a little bit of spice, and a load of herbal hop presence. All of it is distinct and separate from one another.  The taste is equally unique. For being made with 18% rye, it barely comes through but that's a good thing because it balances out the hops unlike any IPA I've tried. Don't get me wrong, though, there is undoubtedly an herbal hop character. It's flavorful and spicey, but not very bitter.  Medium to full bodied mouthfeel that finishes only slightly bitter with a touch of spiced sting, like a light tobacco.  I could easily put back an handful of these in a sitting.  This was quite a unique brew that I thoroughly enjoyed. My style is typically a little more over the top with the hops, but I understand where they were going with this and Bear Republic created a very well balanced beer that I will definitely add to the fridge on a consistant basis.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Crisp spicy hops and rye dominate the nose. A bit of citrus, a balanced sweetness from the base malts, and a little floral floater from the yeasties. The taste is out of this world, smooth, spicy sweet. A little citrusy on the finish which melds well with the traditional hoppy flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth with perfect carbonation. The body is pretty big for the alcohol, a big chewy beer that somehow manages to become smooth and refreshing. Delicious. I could drink this often and in decent quantities.

610,3158,GatorBeerNerd,4.48,"22 oz bomber purchased at Green's in Greenville, SC. Poured into a Sierra Nevada Hop Tulip glass.  A: Pours a beautiful dark brown with ruby highlights. A pillowy frothy tan head that does not want to dissipate at all. Saying that it has excellent lacing would almost be an understatement. An amazing looking beer.  S: Hops dominate the nose. There is a hint of rye and caramel malts as well, but the main aroma is definitely hops.  T: The caramel and rye malt flavors supply a great backbone for the load of citrus hops and what tastes like a hint of pine hops as well. I give this one a high score because it is unique in comparison to many of its competitors in the style. The rye really adds something to this one.  M: It has an incredibly creamy mouthfeel. The brew is thick and smooth. The rye gives it a little more interest with an almost spicy like character.  D: I love the complexity of all the things going on with this brew. However, the rye and hops cause this one to be a little bit of a sipper since there is so much going on. That's OK with me. Its just that much longer that I get to enjoy this one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,amneziak,3.99,"Appearance: Right off the bat the Hop Rod Rye Ale from Bear Republic is one of the nicer looking beers I've seen. It is a beautifully clear caramelized red-orange color. The only drawback, however, is the lack of head you get from the beer. Even after a vigorous pour, I was only able to get one finger of nice pale white frothy head. Once this dissipates, you pretty much have to beg it to come back. For this reason alone, I suggest pouring only a few ounces at a time and then refilling as you go.  Smell: As suspected there is a good punch from the hops on the nose, which later becomes a little more pungent. Surprisingly, this is followed by some slight coffee components that help round out the glass. There are other aromas, but they seem to be too muted to pick them out individually. Early on in my bottle, I even picked up (I hate to say it) a coppery smell of a nice shiny penny. I'm not sure why this came out, but luckily it diminished about five minutes in to the beer.  Taste: First and foremost I don't taste the rye elements. I know it's made with 18% rye, but I certainly don't taste it like I do in whiskey. However, if the addition of rye has anything to do with how extremely well balanced this beer is, then I am exceedingly satisfied with its presence. There is a good amount of bitterness from the hops. What makes this bitterness so amazing, though, is that it's the kind of bitterness you'd expect from a strong coffee rather than hops. Really magical stuff if you ask me.  Mouthfeel: This is a medium bodied beer just teetering on becoming heavier. In addition to the amazing color, its mouthfeel is one of its best characteristics. Every sip fills the mouth with a perfect amount of bitterness and at no time falls flat on the tongue. It was at this point in the drinking process that I began to really appreciate this beer for what it is - a well-rounded flavorful ale with a nice hoppy bite.  Overall: My first reaction upon pouring this beer is that I wasn't that in to it. The coppery component that I got right off the bat was a huge turnoff. However, the more I poured and the more the coppery taste dwindled, the more amazing this beer got. Half way down and the Hop Rod Rye became one of the better beers I've had in a couple months. And as I said before, you could look at this as an IPA/Stout hybrid because that's pretty much what it tastes like.

610,3158,beerfanbill,4.8,"appearance: dark, lively. very active, head clings to the glass in rings and stays there the whole time.  smell: very hoppy. truly lives up to its name. i always raise the glass to my nose several times before i begin drinking just to appreciate the distinct, pungent hoppy aroma.  taste: tastes better than it smells. the hops dominate the pallette. they are as strong as any hoppy beer ive ever had and yet not too strong. perhaps the hoppiest beer ive had that didnt over do it.  mouthfeel: smooth, crisp. savor each sip to have the hops coat the tongue.  drinkability: personally i find it to be a great session beer though its 5 dollars per pint at the bar i go to so i only usually can afford one. however, if i had the resource$ i would definitely have several. although hoppy beers are my favor so i am slightly biased in that regard.

610,3158,ommegoose,4.53,"$5 for a bomber. Great value. I'm not buying the American IPA guideline, and won't be reviewing it as such. I think it fits more in the ever nebulous ""rye beer"" category, if not the equally vague ""American strong ale.""  Explosive pour, maybe because I didn't cool this enough after I got home from the store. The rest is going back in the fridge. I got a three inch head that dropped to an inch in about two minutes, leaving lacy lace all the way around. A deep ruby color with lots of carbonation. Lacing runs all the way to the bottom of the glass. Great looking beer. Taking a chance on the sediment resulted in some flaky stuff and haze, which you may want to eschew.  Noses a bit more sweet and malty than I expected. Possibly there's a little age on this. I was expecting the hops to pop out much more. Not sure if this is made with any brown sugar, but it wouldn't surprise me. Similar sweetness to something like Lagunitas Brown Shuggah, or Two Brothers Cane & Ebel (palm sugar). Rye is there. Some piney hops. A fresher one probably scores better.  A delicious rush of rye and hops. Caramel/molasses/brown sugar is there, definitely much more than any to-style IPA. (No gripes with that though, or much else.) It's like the thick, sticky stuff you'd cook up on the stovetop, not the Smuckers stuff in a jar. That rye spiciness blends so well with the hoppy back end, leaving a very dry finish that seems to lean towards the rye spice. Hops are mildly piney, a little citrus hiding in here. You can find hoppier beers of the sort, but this is no slouch. I'm on the fence as to whether to go all the way to five here, but I'm going to say it's not quite there. It's just a touch muted, and doesn't quite pop and burst out enough. Takes a turn towards the maltier side in the second half, becoming a more balanced brew.  Silky. Rye seems to do wonders. Actually seems rather delicate. Beers this smooth are often viscous, but this is on the lighter side. It's dreamy.  Drinkability is a level of dangerous somewhere between Chuck Norris and Jack Bauer. Alcohol is imperceptible, and each sip begs for the next. It's like the beer swallows itself. This is such a pleasure to drink. A classic beer, and a landmark example of how to make quality affordable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,StJamesGate,4.13,"Pours brown-red with a rocky head. Sour rye and cranberry nose. Bready malt with wine, ginger and dark fruit but little sweetness. Big tart hit of grapefruit hops at the end. Chewy body, frothy carbonation. Hot from the 8%.  I'm not sure I like what the rye gives here, but that could just be me. Either way, it does burn too much. No more than one in an evening.  2nd tasting: Dark amber with trailers from custard head, resiny caramel nose, raisins and Demerera up front with sappy California hops, lots of chew.  Solid construction with surprisingly barleywine-like qualities. Can't find much hops or rye, so I have to suspect the age. This will require a 3rd visit.  3rd tasting: Chestnut with creamy pitted beige head, orange + skunk nose, some bread cut by BIG fresh tangerine juice with hint of papaya + pine, grassy finish baby aspirin linger; medium, round, chewy.  Finally got this decently fresh (10 weeks out from 9.27 bottling) and what a difference. Rye is much more supporting role than feature: wouldn't swear that grassiness wasn't dry hopping.

Almost as good as Stone IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Large carbonation bubbles visible on the top of the beer, and a decent amount of carbonation flow inside of the brew after it was poured.  S: Sweet hop presence.  T: Strong rye taste a the beginning, fading into hops and a delicate sweetness. The rye returns in the aftertaste. The malt comes through as the beer lingers, but the hops provide the dominant sensation.  M: Carbonation and taste sting the tip of the tongue, but in a pleasant manner. Sits so well you don't want to swallow.  D: Perfect mouthfeel and great taste. This one is exceedingly drinkable. Can hardly wait for more in between each sip.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,glid02,4.75,"Had this on-tap at the Big Hunt in Washington DC.  Pours a turbid red-copper color with a one-finger tan head. The head sticks around for a while before dissipating into a pancake of bubbles on top leaving solid lacing.  Smells of floral, citrus, and mildly piney hops, and lots of them. There's a nice malty background and some light spiciness from the rye that comes through as well.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Huge hop flavors throughout, backed by robust malts. A mild spiciness comes in midway through the sip and asserts itself more through the end. There's a nice bitter ending that still leaves room on the palate for the hop flavors to linger.  Mouthfeel is amazing. Thick and grainy, it seems as though it has a life of its own. The only other non-stout I can think of that feels like this is Troegs Nugget Nectar.  Drinkability is great. I finished one very quickly and would've had many more if it hadn't been getting late.  Overall this tasted even better than I remembered. Tons of hop flavors that aren't over the top, a solid malt backbone, and some light spiciness from the rye. Wow.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,OldYoda,4.18,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into my trusty standard Troeg's pint glass. An earlier review called this a ""dirty amber"" - nothing dirty about this. It was a beautiful amber ruby and clear and clean with the carbonation bubbles racing to the top. Minimal head but nice lacing and retention. This is a lovely beer.  Smell is hops and a follow up of earthy malt. Very inviting.  Taste follows smell , the hops are there with an excellent malt backbone. An exceptionally well balanced beer. Taste for me is a real wow.  Mouthfeel is outstanding - creamy and full.  Only drawback for me on this beer would be drinkability and the fact that it comes in bombers. Two of these would be a little much for me at this ABV but this is an absolutely outstanding brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

S- heavy smell of flowery, earthy and a citrusy grapefruit smell coming from the hops. You can also smell the sweet malt backbone in there.  T- similar to the smell with strong earthy hops up front along with a sweet malt flavor that gets involved.  M- Full-bodied  D- An excellent beer that is hoppy like a good IPA, but has a thicker body then I'm used to for most IPA's.

610,3158,argock,4.6,"Poured from 22oz brown bomber into a clear pint glass. No freshness date. Purchased from Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $4.49.  A: Dirty ruby-amber hue with a head that cannot be contained by the glass. The off-white head is towering and ungodly large and leaves formations and thick rind of lace at the top with incomplete sheets down the glass as well.  S: Spicy and earthy, floral hops with enough caramel and pale malt sweetness to keep it from smelling moldy.  T: Spicy, earthy, and floral hops are front, center, and end in this beer. The rye spiciness with a rough edge is a welcome change of pace. The malt sweetness is perceptible but barely and keep the bitterness heavy but manageable.  M: Low carbonation but lively due to the spiciness. Some coating but the feel is helped by prper serving temperature. Aftertaste of floral and pine hops are long and lovely.  D: A high ABV IPA/DIPA with uniqueness and robustness that is not matched by many brews out there. Bottle version has the distinct advantage of controlling temperature which enhances the earthy nature of the rough and tumble but sumptuously delicious beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Nose is nice, sweet rye, spicy, with a piny hop note that meshes with the spicy rye perfectly.  Taste begins with a nice, sweet caramel malt body, complemented by rye notes, with a resiny hops making an appearance early and for the duration of the beer.

Small, fluffy, beige head fades slowly and leaves only a small amount of lacing  S- The nose give off a big, hoppy, flowery bouquet. sugary pine, pineapple and grapefruit. As it warms the sweet caramel malt aroma becomes unveiled, but still understated. A bit of rye spiciness.  T- There's a lightly sweet caramel malt presence from start to finish that provides a very nice balance. The malt sweetness that's first evident is met by a nice spicy rye flavors in the center followed by an intense hop bitterness in the finish. A dry parching finish yet the aftertaste lingers a bit imparting a bitterness and light alcoholic spice.  M- The body is full and thick with a moderate carbonation. Smooth and a bit creamy even.

610,3158,Mebuzzard,4.2,"This is my first review of a Bear Republic brew. I 've heard good things about them, and jumped on the chance to try this one. Drank it during the second half of the Pitt/Arz super bowl. Pours a murky, dark amber body that produced a small, yet dense head. The white foam lingered for a bit, chunked up in small splotches and then faded. Perhaps it was poured too cold. Slight citrus aroma mixed in with the pine and rosemary. A slight sharp alcohol twinge to it as well. A bit of smoked honey thrown in there as well as some wet malt. Taste is well balanced. Pine starts off on the tongue then the citrus comes into play. Sweet malt separates the two and helps with a smooth finish. Alcohol is a bit noticeable, but blends well with the hops as far as bite is concerned. Overall a solid beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Smelled first of hops, but also of bready malt. Taste was like the smell, hops up front and in the nose, but balanced by the rye maltiness, but not enough to take away from the beautiful hops in this IPA. Mouthfeel was decent, and drinkability is good due to the rich taste.

610,3158,SupaCelt,4.05,"Looks delightful during the pour. Nice rich mahogany colour. Dense appearance as it flows from the bottle to the glass. Small head on a gentle pour. It fades fast. Lacing ensues.  The nose casts sugary pine, pineapple and orange juice, and peppery rye impressions all with a smattering of dirt. I can tell by whiffing that this is going to be a delightfully bitter and dry experience with interesting flavours along the way. Happy trails to me.  The flavour is quite bold. The bitterness hits right away and holds on as faint citrus accents roll through and peak quickly. A fluffy caramel malt base frames these features and some chalky yeast and burnt toast crust linger about as well. The finish is hasty and all flavours are muted by a dryness that is quite profound and parching. Well done.  The body is fluffy and round. It has more substance than I was expecting and borders on thick. This characteristic becomes more pronounced with warming. Quite satisfying.  This beer makes pondering enjoyable and is a pleasure to consume. It is not available in my immediate vicinity, but if it were I would definitely have this on hand in my fridge.

M-Medium bodied beer with a prickly mouthfeel at first but again as it warms it smooths out.

610,3158,ToddT,4.55,"A- Pours a medium brown with a nice red tint. Well defined cream color head that sticks to the glass leaving a well defined lacing pattern. Head diminishes very slowly.  S- Big notes of hops, malt and rye. Nothing subtle about the nose on this one.  T- Not as aggressive as the smell would you have you believe. Nice bite of hops upfront, then rye that fades to a medium hop bitterness, not over the top, well balanced. Finish is dry, leaves you wanting another taste.  M- Creamy and smooth , thicker that average body has substance to it, a little chewy. Not heavy on the carbonation, maybe lacking a little bit here.  D- Easily one of the best rye IPA I have tried. Everything in a nice balance. Nothing dominates the taste, the only thing that will stop you from having too many is the 8.0% ABV.  One of the best introductions to a rye IPA you could have. Very well done.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Stimack,3.93,"Gave this brew a try last evening as it was a brew that I have been passing by for a long time. Based on the reviews I figured I just had to give it a try as it seems that I was missing something. I know why I have passed this brew up as I am not a big hophead though I do like hoppy brews, just not a steady diet of them. This brew poured to a somewhat cloudy dull amber color with a huge bubbly light tan head that had incredible retention leaving thick chunky lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma's for this brew are really dominated with a huge hop presence, it hits you hard from the time you open the bottle and make the pour. The hop aroma i catch is more pine than citrus/grapefruit. Caramel like malt aroma is there as well but takes a clear back seat, besides that it is hard for me to pick up other scents. The flavor is nice, resin like hop flavors seem to hit right from the start and just linger at the back of the mouth for a good period of time. I have had brews that have seemed more hoppy before but this one is pretty heavy in the hop area, also not sure the age of this bottle so they could have even mellowed a bit. I think I am getting some malt (Rye?) base as well in the flavor but it does seem hard to find anything under the layer of hops. Quite drinkable (though I was getting hopped out, lead to a lower drinkability but that i just my take), finishes a little dry, nice carbonation. Not a brew I would continually look for but one I would clearly recommend!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BuffaloTapHugger,4.2,"Poured 22 oz bomber into my favorite pint glass. A darkish brown liquid emerged. A crazy three-finger head with some mountaintops make for some visual, dissipates somewhat quickly. Smells of nutty malt and some earth tones with some hop in play. Gulp. Kind of spicy on the intake, the hops are right on. The rye malt and the over the top hops make for some combination. The mouthful is flawless, very mild and smooth for the ABV provided. Easily makes this a session beer. Beautiful lacing that coats the glass from top to bottom, great for keeping time.  A nice twist from the typical IPA's out there, recommended to all the hopheads looking for some change.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

This is beautiful to look at.  S: Bright hops at the front, with roasted grains and a spicy finish that has to be the rye. Definitely seems good so far.  T: Fresh, malty, bready and slightly spicy grain notes out front. Finishes with a significant hop bitterness. Some citrusy notes with the hops. This is complex, balanced, and delicious.  M: Medium-heavy, sticks a bit in the mouth. Seems appropriate for something with this much malt in the flavor. Carbonation is light but present.  D: Despite the ABV, I could drink these all day.

There is a bit of spicy rye detectable as well.  T - wow. this is a delicious IPA. The grapefruit and sweet maltiness dominate the palate. There is also a bit of pine and the rye adds a nice touch of spicy sweetness to the flavor.  M - creamy and full. The 8% abv is very well hidden.  D - With more powerful IPAs I am sometimes ready to put the bottle down before I finish. With Hop Rod Rye, I was more than ready to keep drinking more. I enjoyed this IPA very much and will be picking up more in the near future.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

It gives off an earthy, grainy smell. I get a hint of pumpernickel as well.  T - The taste starts with the sweetness of the malt and the spiciness of rye. It finishes strongly with the hops. The hops remain as the lasting flavor I get with each sip.  M - A clean and long mouthfeel that goes from the initially sweetness of the malt and ultimately finishes with the bitterness of the hops.  D - This beer is so interesting and flavorful I wouldn't want to have more than 2.  Overall, hop rod rye is one of the more impressive and innovative beers I have had in a while.

This beer pours a hazy dark copper brown with an abundance of foamy, frothy white head, that takes its sweet time going away. The smell is grapefruit citrus hops, and sweet caramel malt, with a bit of grainy spiciness. The taste is a wallop of citrus and pine hops, balanced by a decent sweet malt backbone. The grainy spiciness of the rye is quite evident, and a nice addition to the usual suspects. The carbonation is on the moderate side, and there is only a mild warming from the alcohol. This finishes off-dry, with a nice tangy bitterness from some leafy green hoppiness. Once my palate reset itself to Hops, Straight Ahead!, this became very drinkable. Would that i could have this as the base for a session...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Smell - Not surprisingly hoppy with caramel malt and pronounced citrus tone.  Taste and Mouth - Smooth but crisp mouthfeel. Taste is hoppy throughout with a bit of sweetness and warming on the backend. The rye flavor comes out just enough for my taste.  Drinkability - To me, most every west coast IPA is sessionable (can't get enough of them hops), and this beer is no exception.  Bear Republic needs to 6 pack this stuff so I can have Hop Rod and Racer 5 in the same sitting without dropping two bombers and 10 bucks.

Aggressive nose of hops and bitters, mixes in pine resin, white grapefruit pith and field flowers, any fruit is like dried apricot pits, compactness in its punch may inhibit breadth of scents. Lots of foam in the mouth during attack, more full-bodied than medium as it sits very solidly on the palate. Hoppy as a hyper rabbit, less bitter than nose might suggest due to the sweeter grapefruit, tangerine citrus and more present apricot, peach fruit. The rye flavors there but not a huge aspect, blends into accents of hay, straw, fallen pine needles and spices. It expands in the mouth until you have to make a concerted effort to swallow.

610,3158,jamie2dope,4.4,"This is a beer that I do not pick up enough. Pour reveals a dark ruby color, with one finger of tan head, and small chunks of sediment floating around. As I was pouring it, the words, ""damn, now that is a glass of beer"" popped in to my head. Rye, grapefruit, pine, brown bread, alcohol and something very herbal/spicy all come through beautifully in the smell. Rye and hops dominate the taste, but there is also a very juicy fruity aspect to it. Slight alcohol burn, with some bitterness as well. Malt and hops combine nicely to make this a bigger IPA than most. The body actually feels bigger than the amount of alcohol present. The slight alcohol burn and bitterness that this one only mildly difficult to drink; in other words I cleared the bomber off without a problem.

There are some chocolatey notes I get, chocolate malt, and a light spiciness from the rye.  M- Medium-full body with a moderate carbonation. Quite filling, but not quite a meal in a bottle.

No memory of the appearance or smell (I just entered average for my ratings to keep things even). This had more of a rounded taste than the Racer 5, with a nice mix of malt flavoring and pine hops. It had a smooth aftertaste and great texture. Easier to drink than their IPA, and a good overall beer.  Edit: I tried this again not too long ago. What a fantastic beer! It looked great, smelled great, tasted fantastic, and had great body. It was clean, balanced, unique, and delicious. Very bold flavor, but still fairly easy to drink.

610,3158,TMB0424,4.26,"Bomber into pint glass.  Poured a dark mud brown with auburn edges when held to the light. A fluffy off-white head held extremely well. Lace clings to the glass for dear life. Can't wait to try.  Smell is surprisingly subdued - maybe the massive head? What I do detect is bits of caramel malt and a lot of citrus, earthy hops. A musty sweetness lurks in the background.  Wow, this tastes amazing. They are not kidding with the rye. Starts off with a quick splash of sweet, caramel malt then is quickly overpowered by a tidal wave of pine, citrus (grapefruit and orange). Thrown in the middle of all this is a roasty, spicy grain and rye element - and damn is it awesome. The rye brings in a slight hint of chocolate, as well as some tobacco leaf. Almost like a fine cigar. All of the flavors factor into the finish and it's great.  Mouthfeel is super creamy. Full bodied. Leaves a thick, oily hop coating in the mouth. Buttery, as well. Just dances around. Very drinkable - the alcohol is masked very well and leaves a nice warmth. What a satisfying brew. So well put together.

I like the struggle going on there. The mouthfeel is nice, a little thicker and creamier than a standard IPA.  D - Mmmmm good. Reminds me very much of a more malty Double Wide IPA.

Excellent lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass.  S- Beautiful fruity hop notes of orange peel and estery strawberry or green apple.  T- The brew introduces itself with a brief malty sweetness that quickly gives way to delicious, intense hoppy bitterness with toasted grain and nut flavor. There was a hint of orange peel and green apple in the finish, but the fruit flavors weren't especially prominent, which surprised me a bit given the fruity nose. Very interesting spiciness to the finish, presumably from the rye. Alcohol burn is noticeable, but not a detriment. Flavors keep coming as I keep sipping - very complex.

610,3158,Slatetank,4.47,I purchased this growler at Cobbblestones in York. Poured chilled into a Guinness tulip.  A - a beautiful garnet color with very good clarity and foamy light tan head .  S - Buttloads of citrus w/ a high amount of grapefruity goodness and a subtle caramel malt sweetness in the nose  M - For an agressively hopped beer there is a nice amount of creamy and sweet texture from the malt.  T - A nice sweet orange rind sour and bitter hop flavor up front that relaxes slowly into a spicy and grapefruit-like flavor. The light caramel and a lovely floral hop layered beneath the citrus and subtle rye edge is splendid  D - The drinkability of this beer is extremely good. I drank several pints from the growler in one sitting. I consider the combination of flavors delightful but the abv is the only thing that keeps it from a '5',Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Gyle41386,4.35,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle purchased at Total Wine in Columbia, SC.  Pours a deep reddish brown, good head with nice lacing. In your face hop aroma with some spice. Piney hop taste hits the tongue from the initial sip. The rye is quite noticeable as opposed to the usual citrus notes in an IPA.

610,3158,ThreeWiseMen,4.42,"Split between Wisemen Nick and Peter.  Appearance: Pours a very dark, earthy amber with thin, sticky, off-white head. Light carbonation can be seen when held to light. Nice lacing. Very unique looking. N: 4.5; P: 4.0  Smell: Caramel apples, pine, berry pie filling, spices, lemon zest, and some (somewhat faint) oily hops in the finish. A great smell! Very complex with a good amount of sweetness. N: 5.0; P: 4.0  Taste: Not nearly as hoppy as anticipated, and we are not complaining. Starts with pine, earth and caramel malt, and finishes very spicy: black pepper, cinnamon, we're guessing that's rye? Some red currant sweetness toward the end. Finishes dry and pungent. Once again, very unique. N: 4.0; P: 4.0  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated - very smooth. Medium in body and somewhat sticky. Good mouth coating with a dry, spicy finish. Too spicy for Pete. N: 4.5; P: 3.5  Drinkability: A very unique, fun brew. Starts out a bit hot and spicy, but gets much smoother as you drink it. Nick really liked this one. Pete liked it as well, but thought it was a bit too spicy to drink a lot of. A one-of-a-kind brew and a definite must try.

Tasted even better. Tasts like a brewery smells if that makes sense.

610,3158,SwiftyMcBeer,4.33,"Poured from a tap in the Map Room in Chicago. Good looking auburn brew with a nice head. The smell is typical IPA, but that doesn't carry over to the taste. The rye really shows itself in the taste, especially the latter portions. I like that this has a ton of hoppiness but you remember the other notes as well. Been drinking a lot of hop bomb beers lately and this was a nice change of pace on the hoppy them. Really interesting twist on an IPA, I would definetly like to have this again.

610,3158,mrandolph,4.34,"This pint was pulled during a Bear Republic Tasting in NYC. The first surprise was how different the draft felt, more bitter and more carbonated. The aroma starts with the malt and some low levels of hops. The appearance is a lovely auburn, where red turns to brown. There was no head but a great deal of good carbonation, which felt like a plus. The flavor starts with a malt with rye spiciness floating through. Next is a bitterness with some rye left over. It finishes bitter with a sweet aftertaste. The bitterness is not citrusy as the usual IPA style and borders on astringent. The mouthfeel is medium with a lot of carbonation which cuts the overall body down a bit. Overall it is a good beer that I'm glad to have had on tap but enjoy more in the bottle at a warmer temperature.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Smells hoppy and fresh witha a bit of malt. Taste let me down, ALOT. Something wasn't right at all. Maybe I got a bad one or something. The hops was right up front with the rye but there was a bit of a funkiness with it. Maybe I'll get another and see. Drinkability was low due to the taste. This doesn't compare to other IPA's at all.

S- fragrant grapefruit and pine stand out. cascade? centennial? amarillo? idk but it smells great. fresh and tropical, notes of pineapple and passion fruit come out as well. toasty caramel, almost chocolatey (more like cocoa acidity from the rye) back up the hops achieving quite an impressive aromatic balance. a whiff of alcohol and rye spiciness as well.  T- gotta love that rye flavor. it's no wonder they boast such a high rye bill considering it is a dominant flavor with a spicy earthy flavor and a bitterness separate from the hops. fresh hop flavor of burnt grapefruit, orange, and pine lasts from start to finish and the toasty caramel malt in combination with alcohol and all the rye characteristics create a mild cocoa flavor that is very raw and grainy. woodsy, tobacco, and mushroom, finish is full of fresh grain and hop flavor and a touch of caramel sweetness. would be #1 killa with some spicy food.  MF- resinous and slightly oily with definite juicy qualities about it. somewhat boozy feeling with a tannin dryness. almost low carbonation gives me a strong-beer-pub type feeling as opposed to the session-beer-pub type feeling that i often get from quality english ales. lingering coating bitterness like some herbal medicine.

Tastes sweet and sugary like sugar plum fairies. The fruity, sweet pear malt from the aroma is there as is some toasted caramel. Very malty but very hoppy also. Mainly fruit and floral hops.

Gorgeous bead running in reverse cascades up the beer and especially around the edge of the glass. Slightly thin lacing and slightly translucent. Overall, damn goddamn arse fine-looking bastard of a beer.  Nose - oh, that is so the shit for which I'm looking. Delicious pungent smell of hops with a deliciously sweet character of candied orange. But mostly I'm sticking around for those delicious hops. It's beautiful, aromatic and delicious and makes me want to dance with sugarplums. Not complex, but pungent and sublime.  Palate has intense hops all the way through, but it's a very well-balanced feel with no mouth-puckering bitterness until the very end of the palate, by which time it's just a subtle lingering but intensely hoppy finish. Has bold, malty characters adjacent to the bitterness which makes it full-bodied and tasty and just very enjoyable. Alcohol is mostly hidden but I sense a slight vodka-like hint at the back.

Aroma of hops of coarse... real earthy and a little piney ... and something I can't put my finger on... the rye! A little alcohol and something else. I guess it's the rye.  It looks like a hazy redish brown liquid heaven in a glass. Not to style very much but still, very appealing.  Tastes like it smells. The rye realy comes through with light spicy characteristics. The taste keeps getting better as it warms unlike the aroma.  And it is smooth on the palate.. very refreshing. And the rye is so unique.  I love it and will probably buy some more. My first from bear republic. The Lord bless the hop harvest!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,cvstrickland,4.6,"First off, I'd like to say that in no way, shape, or form should this beer be characterized as an American IPA. It's way more than that; it's a rye bomb-- a scratchy, peppery good one at that-- and should be king of that dullard catchall category so imaginatively named ""Rye Beers"". That said, the 22-ounce bomber bottle poured into a large tulip glass yields a hazed crimson-tinted amber body capped with two fingers' thickness of whipped cream-style stained ivory foam. The fine-bubbled head relaxes very slowly, deflating into a misshapen, convoluted dollop that sticks fine, semi-solid sheets of lacing onto the glass.  The smell is all hops, with loads of zesty citrus liberally sprinkled with sticky herbs. The sweet fruitiness is as if grapefruit were dusted with brown sugar and baked in a maplewood-fired oven, with a note of zippy Key lime and fragrant orange blossoms, plus a bonus whiff of evergreen.  The taste is crisp with fruity hops and a spicy flavor of peppery caramel. A generous dose of rye malt adds a tingle to the tongue and a significant zing to the drink, complementing the sturdy hop charge perfectly. Once again the idea of baked grapefruit and brown sugar pops into mind, only this time the sugar is syrupy and the grapefruit seems much more warm and savory than sharp and citrusy. The rye reasserts itself each wonderful mouthful, dominating the drink and the aftertaste in spite of continual hop-based interference. A splash of grapefruit here and a pinch of lime zest there are repeatedly snuffed by the rich rye maltiness, but like Timex, the little green guys take their lickin' and keep on tickin', coming back again and again to get themselves some more succulent rye-bomb beatdown.  The drink is full-bodied with perfect carbonation, and its hefty 8% ABV is invisible to me. Easily one of the most quaffable brews I've ever encountered.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Mouthfeel is dry and light making me want another drink as soon as I set the glass down. Very drinkable beer but not as drinkable as other IPA's earning it a solid 4.

610,3158,MasterSki,4.2,"Shared this with the family during dinner tonight - my father-in-law loves the bottle. No discernible date on this bad boy - wish all makers of IPAs would give freshness dates.  A - Golden amber color, largely opaque, with generous creamy head that dissipates quickly to a complex lace that lines the sides of the glass.  S - Hops, sweet malt, rye whiskey - I think this is an older bottle because I remember the hops being stronger. The age actually balances this one out quite nicely. There's a nice array of bitterness, sweetness, and sharpness to the smell.  T - Fruity and malty, the hop bitterness only really makes an appearance in the aftertaste. I get lemon most of all out of the citrus notes. Not tasting that much rye - there's just the slightest hint of whiskey and wood at the top of the palate. Not at all boozy - wish this had a little more depth to it.  M - Good density, not overly carbonated, smooth and creamy. Leaves a resinous feeling afterward.  D - Might be a little too sweet for me to have all the time, but it's easy to down a bomber.  Very solid, and the rye and bottle label make it stand out from what is otherwise a very crowded genre (American IPAs).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,sgoodship,4.55,"This was my first Bear Republic brew. I loved the humorous copy about the sediment on the label. $4.99 at Binny's - great value.  A: Almost a very dark brown haziness on top that becomes a clearer dark amber at the bottom of the glass. Deep and interesting looking. Without vigorous pouring, it delivered a nice slightly off-white head that started clinging to the glass immediately. Awesome lacing throughout and a nice ring and thin head stayed the course.  S: Really big hops. Initially, it was a grassy, earthy hop but as it warmed, I got more of the grapefruit profile. There was also some caramel syrupy sweetness underlying the hops but it was not the dominant force. I think I could detect rye but the hops are so dominant that it was hard to pin-point it.  T: Good hearty taste. Pretty much as the smell. Generally, feels quite complex and deliberately hop focused. Rye ads a nice dry crispness and slight spicy bitterness to the palette along with the hop bite. Aftertaste is nice sour hop. As it warmed up, the combination of the caramel malt and the big hops was quite lovely.  M: Smooth, medium body mouthfeel with medium/low carbonation. As it warmed up, it was nice and round and thoroughly fulfilling.  D: Very drinkable. Downed it in record time. 8% ABV is hardly noticeable and therefore dangerous. Thoroughly enjoyed this. I think that this is one of my new go-to hop fixes. I love what the rye ads to the mix.  Don't know about style categorization but this has to be bordering on the DIPA. Higher ABV and a pretty deliberately aggressive hop.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Hop Rod Rye is a deep, clear and solid ale, carmine in color and topped with creamy beige head that slowly diminishes over a long time and leaves some alto-cumulus lacing. The aroma? Fresh hops! Pine and fruit! Wood and oranges! Fresh citrus sweetness! It is extremely smooth and pillowy on the tongue, medium to full bodied and has a chalkiness in the after-feel from the hops.

Sometimes hops are intense yet delicate and nectar-like in the citrus and pine...this one reminds me some of the citrus and pine cleaners. (in a good way) Later on as the beer warms I think I can detect some bready malts.  Lots of hops in the mouth as well, but better balanced out by the malt/rye load. I was wondering if I could notice anything from the 18% rye. I can detect a hearty spicyness that's unique to this brew, especially as it warms up. That must be the rye, or so I've been led to think. Very full citric and bitter flavors, bready, but not very sweet malts.  Chewy, thick mouthfeel. Lively carbonation, and long-lasting flavors and bitterness remind you of the Hop Rod long after you've swallowed it. Definitely keeps up with the flavors.  Overall, a very impressive and unique beer. I'd like to taste more rye beers to see if they have the same impact as it seems it does on this beer. Definitely in the DIPA class, in my estimation.

The aroma is nice but not very strong. The flavor is big and bold. A nice citrus hop slap to the face. The hops play nicely with the rye malt, gives the brew a nice and spicy flavor. A nice toasted malt helps support the spicy and bitter flavors. The brew is well bodied with a chewy malt, prickly carbonation gives it some crispness and helps cut the bitter finish.

I taste it from the beginning all the way to the finish. Strong bitterness after the initial citrus blast. Still far off is a little brown sugar sweetness. Smooth mouthfeel works well with the hoppiness. However, I feel the taste is a little unbalanced. The citrus and bitter work alongside like champs, but not much is bringing up the other end. Oh well.

As it warmed the 18% rye became more noticeable in the nose. I could sniff this stuff all night. Medium body and smooth as it coats the palate with hops all over the place. Pine, lemon, orange, floral, and bitter hops assault the taste buds into submission. But there is balance. Solid toasted malt provides the rail for this hop-dump to ride in on. And ride it does, like the green flamed road racer on the bottle. Hop Rod exits dry, but leaves a tingly sensation reminding you of the pleasure you have just experienced. This is a great beer. I love the surfeit of hops, the balance provided by the malt and the way it all goes together.

610,3158,lynx1245,4.25,"Appearance: I wasn't really expecting this. Very nice dark brown that is completely clear with zero visible carbonation. White head recedes quickly into a small ring which dissipates itself very soon after.  Smell: Sweet and malty. Definitely can smell the rye in there. It's like a sandwich on rye with a side of oranges.  Taste: Pleasantly surprised. I haven't tried too many rye beers, but this one is great. Excellent balance between spiciness of the rye and sweet malts and citrusy hops. I love the perfect amount of hop bitterness to finish it off.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy but where is the carbonation? Medium body. Could finish a little dryer.  Drinkability: This one is still very drinkable at 8% ABV. The taste really puts it over the top and I'm getting a really good alcohol warming sensation. Will definitely try this one again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

I've tried other rye beers, and never had more than a few sips before drain pour. This one is perfect due to the hop profile backing up that rye.  M: Thick, but a nice kind of thick(if that makes sense?). It's far too complex for me to describe (there I said it!).  D: High. The 8% is a little high octane. I hope they decide to 12oz this bad boy. If your into IPA's you gotta give this one a shot!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,sweetbrew82,4.63,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass:  P: Pours oak brown from the bottle, and sits in the glass boasting a gorgeous deep reddish-brown colored liquid. The off-white head that it forms is simply marvelous. It's so thick and rocky like a puffy white cumulous cloud in the heavens, and the head retention is absolutely phenomenal. Even when it finally does settle down a bit, it still forms a thick cap on top to remind you of its greatness. Not to mention that it leaves what looks like the definition of lacing on the glass. Amazing!  A: Aromatics consist of grapefruit and orange hops with a piney kick, too. Also some freshly baked bread from the toasted malts.  T: Oh, baby! This is a hop-head's delight. Resinous pine leads the way, followed by citrusy kick that features grapefruits and oranges. The malt backbone tries to provides balance, but fails miserably...in a good way. Caramel is tucked away in the background to provide a little variation in flavor. Finishes very smooth and dry, while a substantial spicy rye taste joins the fold for a nice kick on the way out. Just how I like it!  M: I would classify the mouthfeel of Hop Rod Rye as being a notch above medium-bodied, smooth, and one of the stickiest beers out there.  D: Sounds good to me! I wouldn't mind having a couple more 22's of this delicious brew.  Notes: Hop Rod Rye is fantastic! I just can't figure out why it's not listed as a DIPA. A ""truckload of hops"" and an 8% ABV should justify this, but for some reason it's an IPA. Whatever the case is, this is one that every hop head should feel guilty about if they haven't had it yet. Do yourself a favor and go pick up some Hop Rod Rye from one of my favorite breweries, Bear Republic. You won't be disappointed!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,chrisafari,4.36,"Aroma: crisp hops, mostly pine put some nice citrus as well. Some malt in the background (carmel).  Pour: dark brown, looks more like a brown ale than an IPA. Seems a little too dark for an IPA, not a nice amber but a rich deep dark brown. Thin off-white head, developing some nice lacing.  Flavor: begins with nice citrus. Middle is crisp, clean, piney hops. Really, really nice. The finish is dry, with a spicy hoppiness. The malt is also subtle throughout, but there in balance, the rye seems to add a nice assertiveness to the hops.  Mouthfeel: medium body with perfect carb. for an IPA. ABV is too high, though, for a standard American IPA.  Drinkability: High to medium high. Really easy to drink, one sip begs for another.  Overall: a very good IPA and a beer that I have ignored for far too long. Really well done. The rye is great in the malt and is balanced with the Hops that American IPA's are known for. Definitely something I'll have again!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Daehpoh,4.1,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass.  Appearance is dark orange-amber colored with a bit of haze. Head was substantial and fluffy with a nice stickiness to it. Smell was upfront juicy, citrus, floral hops with underlying caramel maltiness. Some tanginess in the aroma as well. Taste was wonderful and well balanced with grapefruit and earthy hop flavors dominating. An obvious rye tang provided a great complement to the hop bitterness. Caramel malt flavor balanced the hops nicely. Smooth feel with medium-full body and a dry finish. Drinkability is good but limited by the impact of the considerable hops on the palate. This beer isn't overbearing, however you will have some trouble tasting lesser flavors afterward.

The beer poured suprisingly dark, and looked like a dark ale that would be overwhelmingly malty. The head was a nice off white with a brown hue, that looked nice and bubbly and left great lacing  Smelled very piney, floral and hoppy. Malt undertones in the lingering aftermath  Tasted great, absolutely not what it looked like it would taste, if that makes sense. Huge hoppy, floral explosion that is really nicely balanced with the malt aftertones.  Mouthfeel was gaseous, and bubbly but just the right amount.

While thick, not much hazing.  S - While I was gauging the appearance, the smell was already evident. A combination of grassy and earthy notes with some more floral hops flavors. Smell is rather edgy.  T - Not much of a ""chord"" of flavors on this beer. The flavor is dominated by a single attribute. Starts fairly light, switches to and finishes with some more sweet notes. All around a sweet ale. The aftertaste has some of that edgy rye flavors that I was looking for.  M - Has a fairly amount of thickness. The unfermentables created by the rye are noticeable. Almost oily at times. No carbonation bite.  D - Fairly easy to drink, without overwhelming me in both alcohol and flavor. Although the rye edginess does begin to wear, overall I wouldn't find this beer tiring.  An interesting beer - not sure how this fits in the American IPA category.

610,3158,TheMistler,4.19,"From a 22oz'er, this poured a dark hazy brown, with an off-white, bubbly and foamy head. Very nice lacing. As with other aspects of this beer, the amount of retention hinged greatly on whether it was my initial pour, or the finishing pour. The amount of yeasty sediment in the final pour - despite my attempts to avoid such an onslaught - astonished me. Poor retention initially, the head stuck around seemingly forever with more sediment.  The smell just didn't seem like it should go with observed beer. A very bright citrus aroma. Hints of dark rye bread peek through.  The taste is similarly citrusy, with one of the fully developed tastes of grapefruit I've gotten from a beer. That is followed by resin-y pine bittering to finish, and it sticks around. Rye grain, with a much more pronounced bread taste after the sediment is introduced.  A creamy feel, with a bit of hop oil slipperiness. A tad light on carbonation, and what there is didn't feel prickly, contributing to the creamy feel. Hearty for a medium-bodied brew.  Very nice, very tasty (more standout sans the huge amount of sediment), but 22oz just about taps out my single-session interest in drinking it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

As a result of the head the lacing is incredible. Its like the head just sticks to the side of the glass.  Smells citrusy pine with some spice.  Taste is magnificently complex. You taste the spicy heaviness of the rye initially then the warming alcohol finished by the bitterness of the hops.  It has the perfect body not to syrupy heavy not to light, Carbonated perfectly.  Drinkability: At $3.99 a bomber my temptation is to fill the bathtub with this stuff! I could probably drink this brew all night, At 8% abv I know I will regret it in the morning.

The flavor was citrus hops, sweet malts, dark fruit, raisins, and some rye seeds (not as much as I might have thought). The finish is pure citrus hops, and lingers on the palate.

Scent is spicy rye, bready grain, citrus hops.  Taste is spicy rye, grapefruit and citrus hops. Nice soft bitterness and spiciness lingers on the tongue after each sip. Fresh bread notes and a mild sweetness - perhaps the softest touch of molasses? The hop profile and the amount of bitterness are quite subtle and I wonder how fresh this beer is.  Mouth is creamy and lush.  Drinkability is very high. The 8% ABV is remarkably well hidden and this great big beer practically quaffs itself.

It pours well into a creamy orange-like color head. This stuff is thick, you cannot see through it and the setiment on the bottom is something that I personally enjoy. It smells wonderful, it smells quite yeasty, like a loaf of sour-dough bread that had sat out....and I mean that in a good way. The taste is incredible and lasts in your mouth for quite awhile. It is big and bold and with only 8% in the bomber you cannot get into too much trouble. As always, Bear Rupublic hits a home run. I will be adding this to a regular stock in the fridge.

A definite aroma of hops, wow, STRONG with some hints of pine and citrus.  The taste is overwhelming on this one... overbearing hops and bitterness, but the other flavors shine through.

S- Slight smell of hops combined with sweet malt flavor. Like a bouquet of flowers drizzled with syrupy sugar. Heaven in a bowl!  T- The only way I can describe this is like a wave coming onto the shore. The initial wave is a taste of bitter hops that you think will dominate and just stay there. On the way down (the wave receding), sweet malty flavor just rushes back up and eases the bitter hops that sits in the back of the mouth. Simply amazing!  M- Medium consistency that is oh so smooth!  D- The unique combination of hops and malt makes this an extremely interesting beer. Given the amount of alcohol and taste, this beer is extremely drinkable.

Not much hops on the nose, but definitely a sweet malty flavor. A bit smokey as well.  Somewhat of a creamy feel.  In my opinion, Bear Republic's Racer 5 is a much better offering to the IPAs. In fact, I really question the IPA label from beer advocate, since nowhere on this bottle is it labeled as an IPA, nor does it taste much like one.

The foam really was fantastic, as it gurgled like a root beer float. Beer was cola colored, with a nice transparent to opaque gradient from bottom up. Head had nice stickyness to the sides of the glass.  This beer was really something special on the nose - and one of my favorites to date (if not my #1). I got hints of brown sugar and chocolate chip cookie from the malts. Hop scent was oaked and fruity.  The taste notes were not as complex, but still very satisfying. A nice sticky malt beginning turned into a solid hop finish. I didn't feel it was overwhelming hoppy, but then again I do have quite a hop loving palette. Hop flavor was mainly grapefruit rind. The feel was ceamy, smooth, and dry at first. The beer resonated in your mouth, and the rye really began to come out.

A: Deep reddish brown color but still somewhat clear. Single finger reddish white head that produces great lacing.  S: Massive hop smell with citrus fruits and earthy pine. A nice little sweet malt smell can be detected also. Really no hint of rye on the nose.  T: Orange, grapefruit and pine lead the way with a well balanced hop flavor bringing up the rear. There is a more earthy flavor than a normal IPA that must be the rye. From that point a nice sweetness hits the mouth midstream, with alomost dark sweet dried fruits that lends to a FANTASTIC balance with the massive hops. The finish is the earthy bitter hops finish that I love as it lingers on in the mouth for quite awhile.  M: Medium to heavy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden but there is still a sticky resiny feel. If you like a full bodied beer, this beer is for you.  D: Extremely impressed by yet another Bear Republic brew, these guys have got something special going on.

It is sweet, malty, flowery, like a big bowl of sweet red cherries in the summertime.  The flavor is just as good - smooth, malty, with that spicy bite of rye, and a lovely dark cherry feel. The grain is so lovely that it might take you a moment to realize that the hops are outstanding as well - floral, a little piny, with a large, satisfying bitter bite on the finish. An altogether lovely experience, with a satisfying malt spice down the throat.  The mouthfeel is smooth and tongue-grabbing, with a bite of carbonation and a cling that leaves the hop bitterness sitting on the top of your mouth.

Lots of roasted caramel malts and just a hint of hops. More of the hopping profile comes across in the taste, but this is a malt bomb. Easy drinking and really smooth. Decent beer, but I prefer the Founders Reds Rye.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,beerkittycat,4.7,"My first words at tasting this beer was, ""Oh my God that's good."" Appearance is slightly cloudy, deep copper-brown with a frothy off-white head. Good lacing. Aroma has a sharp, fresh hop nose of pine, citrus, and woods. Flavor is absolutely amazing. Lots of fresh hops up front with a complex malt backbone of toasted grains and the spiciness of rye. Moderate hop bitterness but not harsh at all. Full mouthfeel but very smooth and velvety makes this brew extremely drinkable. Watch out for this smooth beer sneaks up at an impressive 8% ABV. A wonderfully complex, balanced and unbelievably smooth IPA. Don't miss it!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,bkilpatr,4.08,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. 09/22/08.  Pours a clear mahogany color with about three fingers of light tan head. The head faded slowly and left some nice sticky lacing. Aroma is piny hops and grassy hops with a generous dose of sweet caramel malt, and some brown sugar.  Taste starts with a lot of sweet caramel malt, brown sugar, and molasses. Finishes with lots of piny and citrusy hops, and grapefruit. Mixed within is a spicy rye bread-like flavor. The alcohol is barely noticeable.  Feel is smooth yet well-carbonated. It had a medium body and not too heavy. It does have a lingering aftertaste that isn't entirely pleasant. Drinkability is pretty good. The flavor is interesting, but the aftertaste kinda gets to me. Finishing the bottle isn't a problem, but I wouldn't want another.  Overall, an interesting beer. The flavor is pretty good but I don't care much for the aftertaste. Worth a try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,orangemoustache,4.45,"Pours a rich reddish amber slightly hazed by the yeast that escapes the bottle. The head is thick,soft and delicious looking,it holds for a good minute before dropping to a thin cap,leaving behind some luscious sheets of lace. The nose is super hoppy,packed full of citrus,and pine sap aromas. This has some of the freshest,heaviest,and smoothest hop bouquets I have yet to appreciate. Nice caramely,spicy malt balance truly makes this IPA a stand out,in the broad world of hop beasts. The body is thick and mouth coating,with a soft creaminess and impresses from start to finish with the taste bud assault that I crave.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,aqsprint,4.42,"A- Deep amber with 3 fingers of foam that lasted forever.  S- Usual suspects pine and citrus with a little spice.  T- Caramel malt, can really taste the rye, very good. Great balance, the hop bitterness goes well with the 18% rye.  M- Coats the tongue nicely but not too much  D- The balance, smoothness, and mouthfeel make this beer very drinkable.  Get this beer!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,HalfFull,4,"Pours a rather silky amber with some deep red orange hues. Nice head on the glass, and decent lacing throughout.  Quite hoppy on the nose, and increasingly so as the beer warms. Mostly of pine and woods as for the hops. Nice nose and notable malt presence as well, perhaps too much as there is some conflict with the hops.  Taste is solid. I didn't even know this was an IPA when ordered and was unaware of the ABV. The nose shows that this is a hop bomb as it warms and settles(yes, an IPA), and the taste hides the ABV almost too well. Is it the rye? Not sure about the rye component but I find this beer very enjoyable and it offers a certain coarseness of texture and pepper spice that makes it quite drinkable. A slight hint of cinnamon/allspice couple with the texture to yield a nice feel and an enjoyable brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,edbeered,4.43,"Thanks, as always, to Kingpin for the bottle. Poured from said bottle, this is a warm reddish brown(pale mahogany?)hue, with a small white head that fades, but leaves ample lacing on the glass. Tht smell is faintly hoppy. The taste is hoppy yet smooth. The hops are citrussy with grapefruit notes predominating, although I taste a hint of pine. There is a dry note(from the rye?), as well as a smooth malty backing. The mouthfeel is astonishingly great, with intense flavors, yet a silky velvety smoothness as well. Damn you, Kingpin, for sending me only one bottle! This is a great beer!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Spikester,4.63,"So far my favorite from Bear Republic Brewing. Beautiful beer with a large head and copious lacings. Aroma of floral, resinous hops. Taste is bitter citrus, resins, pine, and orange-pinapple fruits. Plenty of sweet malts for the style. The rye must have a smoothing or melding effect on the flavors as I enjoy this beer immensely. Nice smooth bitter finish. Wish I could get a growler fill somewhere near home or maybe not...I would probably drink too much beer!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BDTyre,4.17,"Nice IPA with an interesting twist to it.  Fairly dark copper-orange colour with a really thick, speckly brown head. Sweet citrusy hop smell with hints of fresh baked bread and toffee. The rye adds a nice smell to it.  Hoppy, zesty taste. Yummy rye and toffee malt taste, with a bit of yeast character. Slight alcohol burn in the background, but it is not overpowering or even that noticeable.  Good carbonation, just the right amount of tongue-numbingness. Very smooth, even for 8%.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,RodBurg,4.22,"Poured a dark hazy amber into a pint glass. Tan head with webby lacing.  Has a nice spicy hop aroma to it, grapefruit, pine and floral notes. Caramel malt is there with some fruity tones.  Flavor of an IPA with a spicy, bready finish. Citrus and floral hops with oily pine flavors. Finishes with the rye and some light alcohol warmth. Pretty unique not to mention delicious.  Great complex brew. Very drinkable and distinctive.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ffejherb,4.41,"22oz. bomber into imperial pint glass on 9/17/08.  A - Beautiful clear burgundy body with deep amber highlights and two fingers of dense, rocky beige head that retained exceptionally well and left thick swatches of lacing around the glass. Lots of carbonation bubbles jetted through the body.  S - Hops aren't as dominant as when I had this on tap, but there is still plenty of pine and citrus notes backed by a burnt caramel malt and an apparent rye presence. Some alcohol creeps into the mix as the liquid warmed up.  T - Sweet caramel and toffee notes segne into a wonderful hoppy flavor with hints of citrus rind, pine and grass paired with an underlying rye presence and a touch of alcohol. The rype really comes to the forefront in the finish.  M - Full bodied and creamy with lively carbonation providing ample tongue prickle. Warm alcohol presence. Finish is moderately bitter and a bit dry from the rye.  D - This is definitely one of my favorite beers of all time, and the one that got me into rye beers. The hops really build up as the liquid warmed up. This is simply an amazing beer!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,lacqueredmouse,4.6,"Pours a dark, brownish cherry-red, perfectly clear, with a huge pillowy head of beige foam. Lacing is out of this world, clinging like crazy to the edge of the glass. Little carbonation, and the viscosity looks high. Awesome looking beer.  Amazingly powerful and complex nose - aromas of pineapple, sweet citrus, molasses, rosewater, and tantalising hints of vanilla, resin, wintergreen and cut grass. Oh my. The plethora of flavours presented here is extraordinary. Such a wide swathe, but all intermingling, bouncing off one another, in a seeming anarchy that makes a peaceful whole. What a wonderful smelling beer - possibly the most blissfully aromatic brews I've ever sampled.  Taste is also fantastic. A delicious initial sour character bites the front of the tongue, before a welling up of juicy, luscious hop bitterness cushioned on a base of almost fruit sweetness. Tangy, slightly sour finish that leaves you wanting more, more, MORE. Mouthfeel is very nice, with a very slight effervescence on the tongue which coincides with the crescendo of hops.  Wonderful, wonderful beer - what a top notch drop. This will easily be one of the hardest things I have to leave behind here in the States when I return to Oz.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,itcomesnpints,4.4,"Amber red with a frothy off-white head. Impressive lacing. Floral hop aroma with a touch of grapefruit. A spicy hop blast on the taste buds that rounds out nicely with help of mild malted rye and barley. Medium mouthfeel, very smooth. A heavy yet very impressive IPA that I will certainly return to. Another great brew from Bear Republic. This is even better than Racer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,RickSawyer,4.42,"Pours a dark finished oak with a creamed head that rises to the occasion tremendously. As the head falls, curtains of lace wrap around the glass. Smell is beautiful. Tropical, notes of orange peel, piney resin, mint, and a bit of rye breadiness. Tastes wonderful. Begins with a wonderfully bitter hop presence full of pine, touches of lemon juice, floral citrus notes. Then a brilliantly balanced malt marches through full of bready, great rye notes give a hint of a whiskey finish, touches of red apple and caramel. Finishes bitter, dry and clean. Wonderfully crafted beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Silenus89,4.3,"Poured a hazy brown with a reddish hue to it. The head retains well and clings to the glass. Smell of bit of citrus hops and caramel and toffee in the malts. This is a very balanced brew with a creamy mouthful. Bear Republic has a gem in this one, a very nice beer to sap.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,spointon,4.5,"I poured this one from a 22oz brown bomber bottle into an imperial pint glass.  A= This ale poured a relatively clear auburn-ruby color with a gorgeous 2"" dense tan head. The head stuck around a long time and eventually dropped to 1/8"". Big sheets of sticky lace down the glass.  S= I detected big hop aromas up front (grapefruit mostly) followed by sweet malts and spicy, prickly rye.  T= This had a complex mix of bitter and aromatic hops, balanced well by a big sweet malt backbone and the spicy chewy rye. Bitterness was dead-on perfect.  MF= Upper medium carbonation crispness lifted the medium body significantly. The lingering head and the tiny carbonation bubbles gave this one a creamy mouth feel.  D= An outstanding ale, to be enjoyed as a sipper by itself or could easily stand up to grilled meats and barbecue. Recommended!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Wench,4.42,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Deep Caramel with orange lights, half inch of creamy foam after medium pour. Great Citrus and fresh hops in the nose. Rye bread, orange rind and fresh hops on the palate. Seriously round with some decent alcohol heat. Surprisingly drinkable for it's high ABV.

610,3158,KeefD,4.34,"Half inch of tan colored foam sits on top of a dark amber/red body with little retention and some lacing. Nice citrus hop aroma, backed up by a strong alcohol presence and sweet malts. Lemony hops, hints of orange peel, certainly bitter, but a nice malt backbone to keep it somewhat balanced. Hop character is huge, and I don't understand how this can be considered a regular IPA, as it fits every standard of a DIPA. It delicious, strong, and a must try for all hop-heads.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,athensbeermaster,4.26,"This gem pours a large dense head that never goes away,the lacing in great for such a malty beer. The nose reveals a woodsy quality with a lush rye grain scent. The taste starts off with a smoky dark brown sugar then the hops kick in with a spicy accent. Smooth mouthfeel for being so high in alcohol and hoppy. I wish I had a cigar to go with this tasty brew. Another great beer from Bear Republic they never let you down!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,PatronWizard,4.35,"Bomber to arrogant bastard pint glass....  Deep caramel slash amber. Total mush mellow head. I actually poked it to see if it was real. Jiggled like jello. I love the look.  Smell is mouth and eye watering hops. If it taste anything like this smell, it will be awesome.  Biting bitter goodness. Lots of hops. Unique flavor. Really good. I try a lot of beers on a wing and a prayer, I love when I get one like this.  Very smooth.  Overall: oh hell yeah",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,nrbw23,4.33,A- Pours a cloudy deep amber color with a nice froathy cream colored head that leaves excellent layered lacing.  S- A wonderful balance between a ton of hops and malts with a touch of rye in there too.  T- A very deep hop flavour. There is a more Earthy flavour here than a normal IPA I guess that must be the rye. About half way down a nice sweet flavour comes with some fruit hit and then a perfect balance with the massive hops. A nice hop bitterness that lingers on for quite a while.  M- Medium in body and sticky.  D- Highly recommended her. Very solid brew.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

T/M - Fabulous! The hops jump out at the forefront but struggle for dominance in the face of the rye that lends a unique, silky quality supported with perfect carbonation.  D - Not for the weak of heart but spectacularly drinkable with any beer enthusiast. I would not really recommend this ale with many foods beyond dry-rubbed BBQ ribs or fish & chips.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,cameraman,4.57,"A deep amber to ruby color, with a two finger thick, cream colored head. The scent has the sharp, pepper aroma of rye, that is followed by citrus(grapefruit), grass, and pine, with a touch of malty sweetness at the end. The mild taste of malt at the start, that blends with the tasty pepperness of rye. The hop onslaught then takes over. A grapefruit, pine, and earthy flavors dominate till the end. A slightly foamy feel of carbonation at the start, outside of that it is a thin feel, that gains weight as it crosses the palate. This is a very drinkable IPA, with the an inviting aroma, intense flavor, a little bit of a faulter on the feel. Plus, the rye does not shy away from the hops in flavor and the aroma. This is an outstanding beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BretSikkink,4.23,"Murky brown color with orange highlights. Comes from the tap with about a half inch of tanned head, bubbly but firm, with good retention. It took a minute or more to even be able to get a read on the nose because the head was so thick.  Cracked black pepper and pine resin are first on the scene, but the citrics do come in and make a strong impression on the nostrils as well. A tiny bit weaker than I remembered, but I must have had too-high expectations.  A very bitter and dark IPA for sure: the brightness and zestiness of the hops is definitely there but is overtaken for the most part by the resinous, alpha acidic side. Flavors include pepper and other spices, grapefruit, pine, and a strong dose of toffee and caramel malts that line up to be shot down by the hops.  Medium full mouthfeel for style, I love the rye addition; a little bit like oatmeal in a stout, it's just a pleasant combination. Carbonation stays wells out of the way, and the finish coats the palate for a while.  Great beer, no matter what the style. I think of it as a double IPA, the bar called it an American strong ale, and BA lists it as an IPA. That's a hell of a lot of IPA!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,popery,4.28,"Bear Republic makes some great beer, and Hop Rod Rye is particularly good. It's full of hops while maintaining balance. It also looks exceptional.  The beer has a deep, red-golden color that glows beneath an exceptional head. Even after a bit of time, a carpet of tiny bubbles covers the beer and clings to the side of my stein. Hop Rod Rye smells of hops. Strongly of hops. It's sweet and fruity but doesn't overpower in the least.  The beer tastes just delicious. I'm a bit partial to strong, hoppy IPA's, so my score might be a little bit inflated here. The taste has nearly no low-points for me. The sweetness is paired with a perfect, accompanying bitterness. The feel only loses points for being slightly sticky. The carbonation is just right, and the lingering aftertaste is also enjoyable.  The drinkability is very high. The alcohol content is just right. This is a beer that is just perfect for a quiet drink. Its flavor is a complex display of hops. All in all, Bear Republic has made a really good strong IPA, or really a DIPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Zadok,4.03,"Poured a deep oak copper with a head that measured two fingers and was of the off-white variety and very nice and frothy. Lacing also stuck around for awhile.  Aroma is of hops and light malts.  Very smooth hoppy flavor with a very subtle earthy undertone. Each drink has a nice hop bite on completion.  Mouthfeel is relatively smooth with the aforementioned hop bite and low carbonation.  First experience with BR and definitely won't be the last, will be looking forward to trying the rest of what they have to offer. As far as this one goes, being a 1 pint 6 floz bottle at 8% probably makes for having one of these in a setting at a time.

Pours a mediun -dark amber, with a massive off-white head that takes FOREVER to go down. I poured it carefully, and it was still massive. Kind of annoying, as I want to drink it! Smells a little different then I remember. I can definately pick up the rye and hops, but thee is something else in there that I can't quite put my finger on...not a bad thing, but still kind of bugs me. Taste is good. I first get a taste of the rye malts, then the hops kick in, then I get the spicy rye flavor again. Pretty tasty stuff. Mouthfeel is good as well, especially for 8%. It goes down a lot smoother than it should. A nice rye aftertaste coats my mouth. Drinkability is almost too good, but I'm not complaining. It's a very solid Rye IPA, and one I will definately seek out again.

Smell is subtle hops & rye, with a pinkie of sweetness undertow.  Taste sends my mouth into a tizzy. Is this a red? An IPA? What's with that rye? Calm down, everyone. Another sip & I just have more questions. There's all sorts of pleasant layers in there, as hinted at by the nose, but more malt than I'd suspected. Complex. I likes.  The suck-down rating is good. Despite the higher ABV, there's no alcohol sting & the complexity keeps bringing the glass back to my face faster than it should. All the shit going on in this brew is nicely balanced.

610,3158,clayrock81,4.02,"Had a pint glass of this and received a leathery brown with rubish tints that gave off a rocky yet quickly receeding three-finger head with a lace ring. A mix of both intense tropical citrus notes such as banana and orange, coupled with some roasted, toffee and caramel malts - must've been the rye kicking in. A thick, almost full-bodied beer with a very dry backbite. A great hop bite with citric, earthy hops pounding the tongue and a stoutish, caramel aided roasted malt taste follows. Unfortunately, a slight alcohol burn derides some of the tastiness. I guess the rye can be thanked for both (the mix of tastes and the burn). While very affordable and I enjoyed me brew (not for the faint of palate), I don't see myself sessioning this one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

It eventually became so noticeable that I had to stop drinking it and give it to someone else. Sad, but true. I'm really sensitive to slight tastes and smells. Mouthfeel&gt;Pretty decent.

610,3158,lincoln44,4.67,"This brew poured with a monstrous frothy head, resembled a beige cloud upon a mahogany/deep cherry wood elixir. Rocky 2 in head with pillars of froth between the declining portions. After a few minutes there was still a small pillow of head floating around the top middle of the beer along with patches scattered along the non-contact area of glass above the brew.  Smells of pine, citrus, and dark caramel malts. Hint of the 8% alcohol coming through but balanced nonetheless. Sweet fruity aroma of typical description: figs & black currants.  Bursting forth with flavor, all I can picture is pairing this with Provel or sharp cheddar cheese. Sweet with residual sugars but malt/rye character is still prevailing on the exhale.  Mouth feel was a bit oily and slick. The higher alcohol presents a nice warming tone that falls off quickly under the cover of hops.  Overall this is a good brew and a great representation of the style. It is a beer of balance between hops and malt, Bear Republic has another great beer among their lineup.

Poured from a bomber into a wine glass (sadly I have no tulip glasses left, they've all broke because I am too rough while washing dishes!)....Hop Rod Rye is a reddish orangey color with a huge, light tan head, which lasts awhile. Leaves awesome lace on the glass.  Smells like aromatic earthy or flowery hop plants. Really fragrant and nice.  Taste is citrusy bitter at first, then tea like and earthy, then finishes with a long, (almost tart) bitter spiciness on the palate from the rye and mega amounts of hops.  Mouthfeel rocks due to the bitterness left on my tongue...its not quite as good as Green Flash, but close.  Drinkability gets marked down a bit because its 8%. I can only drink this at home, and only 1 bomber at that. I still have to sip it because at 8% it goes straight to my blood. If I had two of these in one sitting I'd probably be very intoxicated.

As a homebrew contest judge, I found that I have a very low threshold for phenolics. I detect them at levels most tasters do not. Judging from the reviews on this site, many people are not tasting what I do, so it is not the beer, it is me. Now on to the review:  Pours to a creamy, frothy off-white head and hazy brown-amber color. Aroma is strong on hops with some bready malt and a touch of phenolic. Flavor is a well-balanced and tasty blend of US hops, pale and caramel and darker specialty malts and a nice hoppy/malty finish. I do detect some phenolic or chemical-like flavors in the taste that bug me a bit, but the dominant flavors linger and make it worthwhile.

Nose is nice hops, but there is a sort of dryness mixed in with some good maltiness as well. Taste is thick hops, but there is kind of an akward dryness to this I am not a huge fan of.

610,3158,hwwty4,3.76,"Thanks State of Kansas for finally getting off your butts and allowing Bear Republic to come into the state. Poured a 22oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. This beer pours an amber-brown with a big 2-inch beige head that sticks around for the entirety of the beer and also leaves a quite beautiful lacing. The aroma is citrusy hops, grapefruit mostly, grains, bread, and a bit of the rye spiciness. The taste isn't as big as I thought it was going to be. Its really just a mild citrus hop bite and a bit of rye spice. It's not bad by any stretch of the word but still slightly disappointing. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied with little carbonation. It's a very drinkable brew, but just not what I had expected.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Wetpaperbag,3.95,A- A brown hazy beer with a thick and foamy head.  S- Lots of hop flavor with a great citrus smell. Thats pretty much all you can smell.  T- There is a grainy hoppy taste. The aftertaste is a bit more on the grainy side of things.  M- There is a bit of a bitter soapy taste that stays on the tongue in between sips.  D- Easy to drink.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,PerzentRizen,4.23,Hop Rod Rye is a breath of fresh air. When I bought it I was buying a mixed bag of a bunch of different beers that I cannot get in Mississippi. If I had any idea this beer would be so good I would have bought 6 more.  Hop Rod pours a coppery brown with a thin lace head that tends to be thicker if the temperature is about 60 degrees - which I learned later in this tasting.  I drank this delicious beer in a trappist glass to let the aroma build. I would say that a tulip glass would also be very appropriate.  This beer is comparable to Dogfish Head's 90 minute IPA but it definately sets itself apart. The hop aroma and light bitterness is evenly balanced with the creamy malt and appropriate alcohol bite.  My only regret with this beer is that it evaporated way too fast! I will definately be back to get a few more soon.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,TEXTONE,4.85,"Look-Dark Amber w. red huge very nice head retention with lacing down to the bottom of the glass Smell-Hoppy, malty sweet hard to get a really good read on this due to smells from the restaurant.

610,3158,THEBEERBAR0N,4.17,"This beer was poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass, producing a nice thick head with lots of lacing. The color reminds me of filtered cranberry juice.  Floral pungent hops cut with a spiced rye edge dominate the smell.  Tastes not quite as good as it smells, IMO the alcohol and hops are not balanced as well as they could be.  Light swishy mouthfeel with medium carbonation.  Drinkability is good for an 8 percent beer, and I like the idea of using rye as an ingredient. All in all good, but definitely not my favorite beer from Bear Republic (go Racer 5!).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,wagenvolks,4.57,"Bomber into a pint glass.  Pours a gorgeously clear ruby-copper body, with a rocky, voluminous head that retains well and leaves thick patches of lacing behind on the glass. The aroma is a heavenly boquet of pine, resin, grapefruit, bubblegum, cotton candy, spice, and a big backbone of toffee malt.  Spicy rye and pine notes coat the middle of the palate before rich, caramel malts come into play. The aftertaste is complex and spicy, with rye paving the way. Surprisingly, Hop Rod isn't as dry as alot of rye beers tend to be, and the medium-thick body leaves a lasting bitter hop finish. However, the mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated. Nevertheless, Bear Republic has delivered once more with a tasty, complex and interesting brew that I look forward to having again.  {Edit: bumped Taste from 4.0 to 4.5 on 12/2/2009--this stuff is just too damn good.}",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,johannasclimacus,4.85,"I was surprised at how dark this beer pours. I thought I saw one poured a few weeks ago that was a much different hue, but realized when I got mine that I was mistaken. The appearance is dark as many have noted, a deep reddish brown.  The appearance is also of a very creamy, smooth ale and the taste fully backs this up. The taste is a dynamite combination of malts and hops; it was just simply a tasty beer that didn't last long.  At 8%, this could be a very dangerous beer. But that is only a compliment to the outstanding taste and drinkability that Hop Rod Rye brings to the table. Excellent job by Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,marksto,4.11,"Picked up a bomber bottle while in Cincinnatti for this years NHC.  Pours a hazy brown with slight reddish hue. A thick off white head with dense bubbles floats atop, and as it sits it develops a rocky appearance. Aroma has citrusy hop elements along with a slight spiciness. Flavor displays a slight toffee-like edge to the malt, along with medium-high hop bitterness. There is noticible carbonation and a significant dryness from the rye.  Overall, a very nice beer, and one that showcases very well the tasty elements that rye can contribute in a beer. Recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,swizzlenuts,4.22,"Whoa! This beer is incredibly dark, it looks like a brown ale and has a head that is pretty large, with a brown tint on it. The beer is pretty clear and has pretty good head retention. The beer has loads of aromatic hops with hints of citrusy hops with a nice fruity backbone from the malts. Not huge on hops on the palet, but a nice bitterness with caramel and toffee in the malts. Can you say balanced? Holy crap, every flavour is mixed evenly for a beautiful taste. Nice creamy mouthfeel, but incredibly drinkable. This is what you call a dangerous beer! Eight percent and tasty as fuck.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,theghost3,4.18,"Pours a reddish brown with a thick beige head. It smell strongly of citrusy hops. The flavor is strong of bitter hops with just a little malt & spice.

610,3158,corey0212,4.63,"Pours a deep copper color, tons of ruby highlights, mountainous tan head, dense and foamy, and staying put! Smells amazing...sticky piney hops dominate, slightly floral, and a hearty malt backbone. Taste is just killer, and one of those ""this is everything I could want in a beer"" moments for me every time I have this brew. Way heavy on the hops, piney, bitter, resinous, and a kiss of citrus. Creamy and lush, slightly oily, with intense lingering hoppy bitterness. One of my favorite beers from one of my favorite breweries.

Smell: Sweet and sticky hops, slick and oily with a spiced loaf of marble rye in the background.  Mouthfeel: Light and delicate on the palate, sweet and oily with a pine like floral kick.  Taste: Unreal sweet hop bomb... smoothed out with a creamy caramelly malt but hops are king here... sweet and spicy finish that makes me want more.

610,3158,ewright,4.87,"A: A thin layer of fluffy head forms after a moderate pour. Several minutes later, there is still a coating of tiny white bubbles with lacing all down the glass. The beer is a gorgeous deep mahogany-red color, reminiscent of some barleywines I've had.  S: Full frontal assault of citrus-bearing hops with a slightly sweet malt background dotted with hints of rye spiciness and creme brulee. One of the best smelling beers I've had.  T: Forward bitterness that doesn't come out and shock you, but strangely seems to intensify as the beer goes down. Lovely spicy notes from the rye and just enough toffee notes from the malt to balance this beer out.  M: Moderate to full body with carbonation so fine it feels like a layer of silk on the tongue.  D: I could drink this with lunch. I could drink this with dinner. I could drink this with (or for) dessert. I could drink this for a nightcap. I *might* even consider it for breakfast, it's just. that. good. The only problem is that the ABV would ruin me by afternoon tea-time.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

The smell is wonderful, the main smell is of the hops and then you can also catch a smell of the grains. The taste is incredible, this has to be one of the smoothest drinking IPA's I have ever tasted. A nice nutty flavor @ first followed a nice hops flavor ending with a bitter bite @ the end, a pleasant one not a rough one. The mouthfeel for this beer is nice and if not for the pricetag it would certainly be something I would always drink. WELL DONE",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

A: Pours a deep chesnut color with crimson edging and a two-finger, tan-colored head with unflagging retention. Session yields massive filagreed lacing down surface of glass.  S: Mega hops. Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, pine, brown sugar, coffee, cocoa, and a hint of spice.  T: Extremely complex taste profile: Citrus hops and pine collide with sweet caramel malts and spiced rye. Notes of grapefruit, brown sugar and orange rind, followed by toasted caramel and sponge toffee. Finishes bitter with nods to chocolate and rye.  M: Full-bodied, creamy and heavily carbonated.

610,3158,roadhouse,4.4,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appears a nice dark reddish copper color with one and a half finger off-white head. Particulate matter floating around but that's probably just because the douchebag at Binny's decided to put the bottle in my box upside down when I wasn't looking.  Aroma is big grapefruity hops, some pine, and a nice spicy rye tone.  Flavor is also based around the grapefruity hops. Piney hops are also present. Some caramel and biscuity malt then it finishes nice and bitter along with a spicy rye flavor.  Mouthfeel is oh so creamy and smooth. Medium, almost light body that makes it very drinkable. Carbonation level is outstanding.  I can't believe this stuff is only $4.99 a bomber. Amazing stuff - better than some that are double the price.

S: Spicy rye/hop aroma. Flowery. I might have smelled a little honey in there.  T: Crisp rye ale sensation. Malt on the leading edge, an unusual transition that makes you open your eyes wide, and then the spicy hop/rye on the trailing edge.  M: Medium body. Good carbonation. I hate using the word again but it is crisp! With an 8% ABV there isn't a strong alcohol taste.  D: I love this one. Rye ales are becoming one of my favorite ales.

S- A dominance of spicy hop aroma with a hint of rye and maltiness. T- The hops control most of the flavor here but rye deffinatley comes threw in the end giving a nice pleasent dry finish. The rye really compliments the heavy hop character well. M- Alot of carbonation massages the mouth which lightens this medium bodied brew.

Aroma was very hoppy with a little bit of spice from the rye malt evident as well. Taste was quite sweet and caramelly with a swift kick of hops mixed in. The spicy rye flavor comes in toward the finish and complements the hop bitterness perfectly. Very nice balance and very drinkable as the 22oz bomber in front of me emptied rather quickly.

Awsome retention with thick gloppy lace around the glass. Ruby dark reg in color with a glowing like quality when held to light. Smell is really close to a double ipa. Huge wafting sweat bready dough and caramel aroma, with just as much hops. Floral dry hop aroma's with clover honey likeness. Honey butter creamyness at the knose as well.  Awwman, that taste is soo delicious and well balanced. Big sweat maltyness, caramel overtones. Hoppy bittering at the midle with a piney grapefruit and some grassy earth tones. At the swallow some alcahol warming and a spice kick from the rye that lingers very nicely. Mild carbonation at the swallow, ohh this is good. Also noteing a very slight hint of charred oakiness at the swallow that sticks around for only an instant. Medium thickness to the mouthfeel. Highly recommend this.

610,3158,Reagan1984,4.53,"This ale poured with an impressively creamy off white head that lingered for almost as long as the beer was in my glass. The beer was deep dark copper in color and only slightly hazy. A wonderful amount of lacing remained in the glass.  Aroma was spicy, sweet and subtly floral. Very nice. I think you get a sense for the higher hop content by the strength of the floral notes and the spicy character of the aroma.  Taste is very nicely balanced and this beer carries a BIG flavor. Quite nice. Again, I notice a peppery/spicy flavor happening behind the malt goodness and the hop bitterness. Also some great fruit qualities to the sweetness provided by the malt. Definitely a little plum or pear. Also some nice grapefruit flavors that I have to assume come from the higher hop content.  I am really enjoying the subtle spiciness of this brew.  Mouth feel was quite big but also refreshing as it was creamy in texture. I also notice that the combination of the spiciness and carbonation cause a flutter on your tongue as you enjoy this beer.  Really good! I saw this in a local store where I am vacationing and figured it was a good one to try after coming home from the beach. I am happy to have another bomber at home in my fridge.

610,3158,slammo,4.23,This was hard poured from a bomber bottle and I knew it was something unique. The color is dark reddish brown; I think you might call it copper. The head by the way really sticks around and leaves a lot of lacing behind.  Do not be afraid to stick your nose in there deep as to inhale all the citrus like notes that lie within.  The taste is wonderfully hopped and the rye makes itself known as well. With an 18% rye content it is no wonder. But this ale just gets better and better as you work your way to the bottom. If you love hops then you will have found your match.  The mouthfeel and drinkability are only matched by how much alcohol you can handle. I can handle another thank you!,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

No biggie, I liked it either way.  Dark brown color turned brilliant red with light behind it. Huge cascading head with piles of lace.  Lightly sweet smell with piney hop aroma, but nothing special in the nose.  Very tasty though, sweet nutty malt with a huge oily citrus and pine hop kick. Medium body with good carbonation.

The head is a gigantic four finger plus beast that rolled over the top of the big ass mug that I poured it in! The foam is beige-tan and thick, and sticks around for a loooong time. Lots of really fluffy and sticky lace is left on the glass.  S - Big time dank hops. Citrus fruit...orange rind, grapefruit, and pear. The malt backbone is thick and beefy with lots of apparent yeast notes. Wow.  T - Hop bomb city. I can taste the rye aspects...spicy black peppercorn and rhubarb, along with the massive hop muscle that powers this 'rod. Citrus and pine exist in a 80-20 relationship, and I'm reminded of wet hay and dank weed when I taste this one.  M - Thick, yeasty, meaty, and chewy. This is the very definition of full bodied. The finish is slightly dry, and I suspect that it would be much more spit-wicking if not for the really sweet and chewy massive level of malt.  D - Damn fine beer. Damn fine beer.

Smells of sweet brown sugary malts with loads of fresh orange, grapefruit, and piney hops.  The nose was very nice, but the flavor is where it is where Hop Rod really breaks away from the pack. Sweet caramel malts with sweet fresh oranges and grapefruits. Toasted wheat with a big spicy-bitter rye bite, and fresh citrus rind and pine needle hops complete this one.

It has a big floral character to it with hints of grapefruit and pine. You can kind of pick up the rye on the back end, but it is overpowered by the hops (not a bad thing).  The taste isn't quite as overpowering as the aroma was, but it still provides a decent hop-kick. The hops are definitelyprevalent, with the grapefruit and pine coming out stronger, while the floralness fades into the background. The rye is very notable, and gives the beer a distinct dry finish. It is fairly well balanced and is an excellent representation of the style. The mouthfeel is a bit fuller than most IPA's, while the carbonation is a bit thinner than you'd expect.

Unfolds with beautiful rye kick, followed by flowery hop bitterness. Smooth. Spicy. The rye adds another dimension to this IPA. Somewhat bready and delicious.  Mouthfeel: Spicy and bready. Floral and hoppy. The bitterness of the hops lingers on the palate.  Drinkability: Very, very drinkable. From the start, you're treated to a very nice floral hop kick with the rye adding to it.

Superior bitterness after the citrus up front and a rye ending for sure. I wouldn't say that the malts ballance this baby but they are definitaly there.

Really an excellent and rich aroma.  T&M: Some faint initial bready malt followed by a (C)ascade of bitter citrus flavor. Rye comes in later and is prevalent in the finish, giving some spicy bitterness on the back end. Body is slightly on the heavy side of medium, with light, crisp carbonation that adds well to the flavor.  D: Hop Rod Rye is an excellent IPA.

610,3158,AmishT,4.25,"A - Deep amber/crimson in color with a great off-white, foamy head that isn't goin anywhere fast. A nice cap in the head formed after it had receded a bit. I like this. Good lacing left behind.  S - Citrus hops dominate, with a biscuity malt in the background Very bold aromas. Very inviting.  T&M - Delicious, balanced flavor. Spicy hops are very prevalent; they may be balanced just a bit by a faint bready malt backbone. Low carbonation, which allows the flavors to emerge. An earthy bitter aftertaste is also prominent. Smooth. Medium bodied. O man, the flavors settle really well on the tongue.  D - The dry, earthy aftertaste really sets up another sip. Great flavor. Unfortunately, I think the drinkability diminished a little bit as I continued drinking. Also, the last glass I had of it out of the bomber was not anywhere near as enjoyable as the first.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

S-Light sweet malt foundation, citrusy hops, light pine, rye, apple, grape, hints of dark, dry fruits. T-Upfront slightly sweet roasted malt w/hoppy tones of citrus (mandarin and grapefruit plus a hint of resin), and light bitter rye flour. In midpalate, fruit esters emerge, including apple and grape.

610,3158,jophish17,4.6,"22oz bomber purchased at Total Wine in Greenville, SC.. but only because Green's was out =/  Aroma: It smells wonderful, super rich in hops! As the bottle indicates, the 90+ IBUs are the centerpiece of this beer, and very little else can be picked up by the nose.  Appearance:: a dark amber body with a beautiful finger of head. Retention is just ok, but the lacing makes up for it!  Feel: Seems to have less carbonation than my first sampling a few months ago, but it still goes down smooth with the hops biting the palate. Not too thick, not too thin.. a nice body that is just right for an IPA  Taste: WOW!! Few beers can match the taste of Hop Rod, which is likely my favorite IPA. The loads of mouthwatering, bitter hops are equaled out just enough by the rye malt to keep a nice balance as the beer goes down.  Drinkablility: Very hard to judge.. I could have one just about every day, but not more than one in a day, at least not in the bomber variety, as it is a very big beer that takes a lot out of me. But oh my is it worth it!  Few beers can live up to the standard that Hop Rod Rye creates in terms of brutal hoppiness with balancing malt character. Highly recommended beer!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,becktone,4.8,"Eye: Killer cascading head. Awesome lacing, the head itself is very creamy in appearance and has some good retention. Color is brown with garnet highlights. Looks great, what can I say. You don't see too many of these, that just about perfect.  Nose: Green and very hoppy. Just what I expect from an IPA. Citrus fruity hop aroma. Real good aroma, some malt under the hops, the presence of them is detectable, however, its not potent enough to describe subtle nuances in it... some dark fruits and slight chocolate and perhaps some caramel nutty aromas, after more inspection.  Tongue: Alcohol is detectable and adds another dimension to the flavor. Roasted grain is notable in the flavor. Hops there, up front but not in your face. Dark fruit also in the flavor of this beer. Green hop flavor melds with alcohol, to me the two are almost inseparable in this beer, they meld together. Hops are floral in flavor, but citrus in aroma.  Mouthfeel and Drinkabilty: Heavy in body. Moderate in carbonation. Has an overall nice feel, nothing special, nice long lasting finish leaving flavor in the mouth that is as alive as the beer itself. This is one that I will easily buy again, however, since there are many more to try it might be awhile. This is one killer IPA, no doubt about it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Wow nice fruity nose. pungent and powerful. Taste -- excellent , good super strong hoppy citrus, grapefruity and a bit lemon. Rye gives the malt a bit of a sharpness (I love Rye!!!). Mouthfeel: very nice. I'm going up to my scores and bumping them up at least 1 notch. I love this beer!!!

This beer pours thick and creamy leaving a 2+ inch light tan frothy head that drops very slowly down to about 1 finger. I've never seen an IPA look quite like this one. Carbonation bubbles in the beer are minimal despite the large head. A dark amber copper color that is nearing opaque. Very thick marbled lacing.  Floral, citrus and pine hops noted in the nose. Some balanced malt along for the ride as well.  Taste is refreshing and light, but not light in a bad way. This beer is very well balanced which I could detect in the nose before it even hit the mouth, but taste definitely confirms this. All I can say is this is a tasty one!  Creamy, medium body, nicely carbonated. I could drink this one all night and I wouldn't even know it was 8% until I felt if after a few pints.  Highly recommended.

This beer could not be more beautiful. A deep malt backbone is evident, with absurd hopping that is balanced between resiny pine and a bit of citrus, but is clearly of a few hop varieties. Alcohol is also evident in the nose. Initially sweet malt, a fine, balanced flavor, finishing in intense hops and a bit of alcohol. There are hints of fruitiness and a bit of honey-sweetness. Astounding. Silky-smooth with medium carbonation and intense bitterness bringing an astringency, as well as a hint of warming in the finish. This beer is extremely drinkable, especially for the alcohol content and intensity of the flavor. This has become my go-to beer when I want a hop fix.

There are hints of sweet malt and rye, but the hop flavor dominates (wow Hop Rod Rye is hoppy??? Who knew?). Aftertaste is bitter yet fruity and really enjoyable  M - solid bodied with good carbonation. It sort of coats the mouth and tongue and all around rules.  D - oh hell yes this is drinkable.

Big two inch head upon pouring shows great retention and lacing. This is a very nice looking beer.  S: Big resiny pine hop smell along with the rye malts in there as well. Also some fruity hops with grapefruit.  T: Very interesting taste that I think can be attributed a little bit to the rye. There's definitely the huge blast of pine hoppiness in there with a significant citrus presence as well, but the rye really adds something interesting. A bit of malts in there but it's really the hop bitterness that runs the show.  M: Fairly creamy and thick mouthfeel with strong carbonation.

It has a very good looking, if different appearance from most IPAs/DIPAs, reddish brown, closer to red, reasonably clear until you pour the sediment at the end of the second serving; voluminous light tan head, eventually dropping into a long lasting collar, with decent lacing. Aroma is heavily hopped as expected, fruity and piney, but there is also a malty sweetness making its presence noticeable. Fuller bodied than I expected, limiting its drinkability somewhat, it is a hop assault as expected; quite bitter and fruity, piney, but some sweet malts and a faint spiciness can be noticed from time to time.

610,3158,Kadonny,4.5,"I thought I had reviewed this before, but alas I did not. I have just tapped this beer at home, so my review will be based on the tap version. So I poured from my tap into a imperial pint glass.  A: A deep reddish brown color but still it allows light to filter through. Nice carbonation with a single finger reddish white head that produces great lacing.  S: Massive hop smell with citrus fruits and earthy pine. A nice little sweet malt smell can be detected also. Really no hint of rye on the nose.  T: Wham, hit me with hops (as I expect from Bear Republic) of orange, grapefruit and pine needles. A very deep hop flavor. There is a more earthy flavor than a normal IPA that must be the rye. From that point a nice sweetness hits the mouth midstream, with alomost dark sweet dried fruits that lends to a perfect balance with the massive hops. The finish is the earthy bitter hops finish that I love as it lingers on in the mouth for quite awhile. Awesome.  M: Medium to heavy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden but there is still a sticky resiny feel. If you like a full bodied beer, this beer is for you. I love it.  D: Very high, in fact I gave it a perfect 5. You can drink this beer all night long. The 8% will eventually catch up to you, but you would never know it was that high going down. I could drink this beer any day at any time.  Overall this is quickly becoming one of my favorite beers ever. I'm going to throw it in my top 5 for sure, it's even better fresh on tap. If you don't have access to this beer, then you are missing out. This is just a notch below perfect to me, right up there with Nugget Nectar and that's saying something.

610,3158,csmiley,4.32,"A - Pours on the darker side of reddish brown. It really looks like an attractive red or amber ale. Head short and tight, topping out at just over half inch. Retention was good. Lacing was quite impressive.  S - The aroma starts out with some fruit hops (orange with grapefruit mixed in). Midway, some wood and tobacco show up but get balanced quickly with caramel-like sweetness. Just a hint of alcohol and charcoal on the end make for a nice aroma overall.  T - Sticks with the hop theme in the flavor and tosses in some fruity goodness right from the start. It is about even between orange and grapefruit. Once the hop flavor has the chance to fade, some sweet flavors start to make themselves known. Caramel, honey, and maple come to mind. Flavor is finished off with some bread and earthy flavors (could be pine but hard to pinpoint).  M - Medium bodied with good carbonation. Smooth from start to finish with an aftertaste that is bitter and sticks around for a while.  D - Drinkability is quite good. The alcohol is hard to detect. It is easy on the palate but still has a nice bitter IPA finish to it. I would have no problem drinking a couple more of these.

610,3158,indiapaleale,4.32,"This beer is responsible for my fascination with what rye can do for a beer...especially when an absolute boatload of hops are also included.  Pours a dark ruby red almost brown color. Its nice and clean and definitely still fresh! The head is BIG, rich and foamy. Its 3-4 fingers in thickness and is very slow to seep back into the delicious liquid from which it came.  The smell is exceptionally fresh and hoppy. Lots of floral scents coming from the head on this beer. Along with the big hop presence is some malty sweet aromas and a slight hint of the moderately high alcohol content.  A nice big swig makes my mouth very happy. There is lots of hop bitterness matched with malty sweetness and that distinct spiciness that only rye malt can provide. That spiciness hits your tongue and the back of your throat in a very interesting way. Its kind of drying and provides a nice little kick. Its also the taste that lingers longest after you've swallowed.  This is a nicely balanced strong IPA.

It has a beautiful 1/4"" thick creamy head that doesn't go away, which adds to this amazing creamy, malty flavor with every sip. It finishes so smooth, going down nice & easy without any bite to it at all. There's an incredibly pleasant, mildly bitter aftertaste along with that creamyness that's still hanging in there.

First pour into the oversized wine glass resulted in a huge offwhite head that lingers, lingers, lingers... as this translucent amber brown brew goes down the hatch, there is lots of lacing. Wow.  S: A trace of something different than your average IPA, the rye? Otherwise, we're talking grapefruit run through the refinery...that petroleum-like smell you just want to keep inhaling.  T: With all those rye malts (18%) this baby is rather bready. A very different kind of bready than in one in doppelbocks and darker wheat beers. If I had some rye bread (my favorite) here, I'd create a monster deli sandwich to pair this with. But make no mistake, this is an all about the hops IPA. There is some token maltiness, but then it's hops assault on your precinct 13 palate.  M: I cannot make out those lovely oily IPA hops here. This is a dry-style IPA. The mouthfeel is light, esp. for a 8% abv.  D: Rye malts in an IPA makes for one bitter brew. It is a bit too hoppy for this man's taste. Simply put, this makes it less drinkable.  This is a good beer that many will like or even love. However, I've had more complex, hoppy brews with a crazy taste or more radical mouthfeel that made the beer in question more drinkable.

Taste follows the same- very strong- bitter, makes your mouth tingle. I did like it- just I felt I could not drink another one of these- even though I shared this bottle. I was looking foward to the rye, and I think the tang that cane with each sip was different, and probably due to the rye.

610,3158,jeonseh,3.47,"From a 22 oz bomber and poured into a GI tulip Glass.  A - A rather dark mahogany with a slight hint of deep orange and gold. Actually one of the darkest IPAs I've ever seen as the primary color is a dark red and not an orange or gold. Has a nice big, tough head that sits on top and reminds me of the color of caramel. Can see a few trails of carbonation coming up but not too much. Tons of lacing left behind and have to say one of the most unique and best looking beers I've seen of the style.  S - Smells of candied grape fruit and also a bit of a syrupy sweetness. Smells more sweet and less hoppy than I actually expected.  T- At first, I get a big whiff of bitter hops that quickly fade into a sweet, tangerine orange and caramel malt. The hops come back in the end but they are not really that noticeable. It seems to be that the malt characteristics of the brew were more dominant than expected. This is a way reminds me of a DIPA where they tried so much to keep the beer balanced that in the end, they eliminated much of the hop flavor. I do want to point out that despite the prevelance of the malt this is not a sweet beer at all. The hops do seem to make themselves known in the aftertaste I find myself with that familiar hoppy, bitter taste sitting on the tongue after the rest of the beer goes down. I almost have to say where this is one beer where I like the aftertaste more than I like the actual taste of it in my mouth which is a bit odd but the way I feel.  MF - A rather nice creamy feel to it. Only a small amount of carbonation that is nice to cut the sweetness. A bit cloying as I can feel the syrupy-ness sitting on my mouth after I drink it. The afterfeeling is a bit astringent but only mildly.  D - Overall, this is a nice and easy drinking beer but not one that really stands out. Has only a small hint of hops really and has the caramel malt, which is not overpowering, but makes the beer sweeter than I expected and wanted it to be. It is good but probably not one that I would reach for again for the reason that there are easier drinking beers and ones that stand out a bit more.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

M: Lots of carbonation and a smooth finish. Definitely a full-bodied beer.  D: This is an excellent brew. Vibrant, complex and tasty. Very well-made.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,OKCNittany,4.17,"A: Poured a huge three finger light-tan head with great retention. Left lots of lacing. Body was a clear brown.  S: There was not much of an aroma. Some fresh grapefruit & some malt, but it really needed to be bigger.  T: Seemed too balanced to be a DIPA, but it was awfully strong for an IPA. There was a wonderful, fresh citric hop bitterness perfectly balanced with plenty of biscuity and caramel malt. The flavor more than made up for what the nose lacked.  M: The body was about halfway between medium & full with tingly carbonation. Smooth and a bit oily on the tongue, leaving a lasting balanced aftertaste.  D: The big flavor hid the alcohol just about completely, and at 8%, that's dangerous. I recommend a driver, because you're not going to want to stop at 1 ... or 2.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Lenny2884,4.25,"Pours a beautiful mahogany/caramel color with a huge off white head that doesnt go away. Nice lacing as well.  Smells of big beautiful citrus hops with a hint of grapefruit and malty sweetness. This has set off a waterfall in my mouth!  Super clean! Bitterness is perfect, citrus hops are on point and sweetness of the malt is there in great balance. Great brew all around. Hops are big but not overpowering.  Overall, very impressive brew here. I could drink this all day and night. As it warms more complex flavors arise. Cheers to Bear Republic",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Maudite,2.8,"Maybe I missed something, especially after reading other reviews in comparison with my notes, but, after two tries with the same results, I am just unimpressed.  A- This pours a fine looking AIPA: Creamy, thick sticky head with tremendous doily lacing. Body is a deep, ruby copper, a few shades darker than typical. Good looking beer.  S- The nose as well is great, but probably the only part of the beer that I could say is well constructed, or even remotely balanced. The large amount of hops blended well with the rye malt creating a nose laden with pine, citrus, woody-floral, astringent, minty. I'd buy this for an air freshener rather than a beverage.  T- I was excited to try this, because every other rye beer I've had has been exceptional. The hops were too aggressive on the pallet, in that they come across as unbalanced and conflicting. I wanted to taste the smooth almost minty/oaky quality that rye can lend, but all I got was a flavor I can only equate to tree sap. The hops were not very citric as the nose let on, and the bitterness was just over bearing. I had to force my way through this beer. I normally love hoppy beers, when balanced properly (Deschutes Fresh Hop ale being a good example of great balance). As it got more to room temperature the flavors balanced better, and I appreciated the fact that they stayed in my mouth for around 5 minutes after a swallow. With some tweaking of the hop bill this could be a world class beer, but I was left confused and disappointed.  M- Like I said, the hops do alot of things to your mouth. Some good, some not as pleasant. All in all I'd say that the feeling your mouth gets from this beer is enjoyable, disregarding the flavor.  D- I'd like to try it again and see if perhaps a third time is the charm, but I cannot recommend this beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,crayphish,4.52,"This is currently the only Bear Republic brew my home store carries, and despite my love for Racer 5 and Big Bear, I couldn't be happier. What a great brew. A fairly dark IPA, nice deep amber with plenty of carbonation and a sudsy head. Smell gets your attention. Piney grapefruit hits hard, accompanied bya grainy alcohol edge. Taste is exceptional. The grapefruit and pine aspects overwhelm the palate. A spicy hot aspect is there too. A hint of caramel malt tries to balance this brew out, but fails, this is a hopheads dream. Mouthfeel is great, very enjoyable with the palate demolished by the hops and left refreshed. Each time I've enjoyed this brew it's been a single bomber, and it was justnot enough of this fine IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Avryle,4.32,"A- Dark, slightly hazy copper color with a thick almond-color one-finger head. Floaties abound.  S- Citrus & piney hops with a strong rye presence. There's a chocolaty aroma lingering in the background too. Unique.  T- Holy bananas, Batman! Super intense flavor. Very strong rye and grapefruity hop impact... I guess that's the point.  M- Full & sticky. Almost meal like.  D- Even with the uber-intense flavors, its pretty darn drinkable",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,TheIPAHunter,4.23,"22 oz. bomber enjoyed in a HopDevil pint.  Appearance is medium carmine with hints of black cherry drizzle. Body is caliginous and has a borderline resemblance to syrup. A cascade of perpetual foam engulfs the glass in sticky lacing.  Nose is a pleasant mixture of citrus, grapefruit, and wheatgrass.  Relatively smooth up front and decidedly bitter in closing. Delicious grapefruits hops, spicy grains, and pinches of cumin.  Oily with a prickly aftertaste. This one lingers exponentially.  This is a very satisfying IPA; a step above Racer 5 (in my opinion) and easy to indulge in, despite the higher ABV of its aforementioned kin. I commend Bear Republic for being adventurous.  Nicely done.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

A slight grain taste at the end...must be the rye.  A good tasting Ale. A nice dry bitterness, slight citrus and slightly sweet. Very well balanced at first but then the hops take over.  A nice Ale in my book. I'll buy this again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Some carob/rye in the back.The taste is resiny, piney, grapefruity, spicy.  Hops are aggressively in the forefront.  Rye backs it up, as does a pinch of caramel sweetness as it progresses. Alcohol is there, but mellow.  Finishes very dry.Full-bodied with an adequate amount of carbonation keeping it from being too thick, though it does have a stickiness associated with a DIPA.

610,3158,ShrLSU,3.55,Pored from a 750oz bottle into a pint.  Appearance - Poured a dark reddish color with a 2 or 3 inch thick white head. Once the head settled it stayed clumpy on top and side of the glass.  Smell - Very hoppy with some slight citrus and malty finish  Taste & Mouthfeel - Very crisp at the beginning but gets smoother as you go further into the beer.

Sheets of lace on the sides of the glass.  Smell is a smoky sweet dark fruit aroma, with a bit of a stinging pine scent.  Taste is a semi-sweet caramel malted flavor, with some fruit flavors, a bitter finish and a little war,m alcohol bitterness. The flavers are interesting and well balanced.  Mouthfeel is buttery smooth and full bodied.  Reasonably drinkable given the ABV. The flavors are well balanced and noting is over powering.

610,3158,soupyman10,4.66,"I tried this one on tap about a month ago and was blown away. I'm happy to see that the bottle version follows through just as strongly; a truly excellent beer. Nice looking deep brown color with amber highlights and a frothy, massive head that seems to never go away, and when it does leaves excellent lacing. Nose is nice and strong, lots of spicy malt and then piney hops. One very minor complaint is that the nose is not particularly complex. Taste is wonderful, all over the place. In no particular order: piney hops, caramel and then toffee malt, light roasted malt, a touch of citrus, very mild dried fruit. Excellent flavor. Feel is full bodied with perfect carbonation. And my second minor complaint: the ABV is too high to drink to many of these, although that might be good, cause I might be downing these 24/7 otherwise.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,ryrust5301,4.13,"Pored from a 750oz bottle into a pint glass. Logo has an old jalopy with flames on the side.  Appearance - Pours a murky reddish color with a lovely clumpy three finger head crowning the top. So clumpy it looks like brain. After the head went down, huge white clumps cling to the side of the class. Still a thick patchy layer of head left on top of the beer all the way to the end  Smell - Lots of hops, somewhat of a spiciness to it. A faint malt is hidden somewhere in the back behind some citrus notes as well.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Crisp and hopy up front, but it blends nicely into a smooth creaminess before finishing slightly bitter on the back end. Hops relaxed a little bit, and it got hella creamy and malty as it warmed. Spicyness kinda kicks in on the aftertaste as well.  Drinkability - Beautiful combo of hops and malt.

610,3158,firkinhophead,4.37,"Pours a cloudy amber brown with a small head that fades to a ring and a thin film of foam.  Aroma of spicy, floral hops, toasted malt, caramel, a bit of citrus in the nose, as well as some alcohol burn. Looking forward to this one.  Wow. Body is much thinner than I expected. Washes right over the tongue clean and bright. Hops are as promised in the nose, with some herbal tastes as well. Rye whiskey flavor is prominent, along with an oaky dryness. If I didn't know better, I might have said it was barrel-aged. Caramel and toffee flavors are more toasted than sweet.  Mouthfeel is superb for such a strong ale. The alcohol isn't exactly hidden, but it goes down smooth. Very little hop bitterness, but avoids cloying sweetness. Fairly low carbonation, but not at all dull on the tongue. Probably the best utilization of rye that I have tasted.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,CrellMoset,4.57,"From a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: A deep, ruddy brown brew that's beautifully clear with a thick, foamy, tan head which lasts for a good minute or two. The lacing forms thick, lateral rings on the walls of the glass. Carbonation inside this beer is very sparse - occasional dribbles of bubbles will drift up lazily from the bottom of the glass, but by and large, it remains very placid.  Smell: A strong, heavy, pungent hop aroma - running the gamut from tart citrus peel to sappy pine - is the real star here. I always really enjoy the smell of rye beers for some reason, and this one is no different - it's earthy, and the bitterness imparted by the addition of the rye melds with the hop bitterness in unique ways. Very well-rounded.  Taste: The faintest hints of sweet, lightly toasted malted barley around the edges ... absolutely smothered in a delicious cacophony of bitter glory. Sharp piney resins, the dry, spiciness of the rye grain, and a floral, citrusy twinge in the finish all represent here. The alcohol is warming - no, no, it's hot - and leaves its mark in the back of my throat. The beer doesn't leave so much an aftertaste as an afterfeel, if you can imagine such a thing. As the beer warms, the flavors grow in intensity and complexity.  Mouthfeel: Like a pillow on my tongue. The bubbles are large, which lightens everything, but everything's connected so well and so smoothly, it's still creamy and rich.  Drinkability: Alarmingly good. The alcohol in this brew (8.00% abv) is borderline dangerous, but the bitterness of the rye keeps the tongue from detecting it at all - a 22 oz. bomber of this beer seems like the perfect amount given its alcohol content. On the other hand, my throat is still on fire from the bitter assault it just received, but like the man said, it really does hurt so good.  What a fantastic beer. $3.99 is cheap for a bomber of pretty much anything decent, and for a beer of this caliber it's pretty much outstanding - I was genuinely surprised at how inexpensive it was. That being said, this beer, more than most others, is not for the faint of heart. Not because it's incredibly alcoholic, or even just incredibly hoppy. But it was really, truly bitter.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

There was some sweet malt and pine resin that combined with the dry crisp nature of the rye palate. On the finish and fade was a beautiful dry citrusy flower hopping, that was sweet and bitter. Overall incredibly balanced with the dry crisp rye complimenting the flowery hop finish with a well rounded hop bitterness and flavor that was not coarse like many other ipas.  M: medium-full with a nice viscous nature, slightly oily with almost no carbonation detected.

610,3158,kkipple,4.2,"220z bomber. Just arrived in SC!  A gorgeous fat 3 finger head leaves lots of lacing as it perishes, settling to cover a rich bourbon-amber brew with a few centimeters of dense, thick foam.  The glass explodes with big wet hop aroma. Lots of pine and bitter citrus invite you to taste the sharp, malty brew beneath. Unsubtle hints of booze and a little rough 'round the edges, that'd be the rye. Smells intense, 'cause it is.  Q. How do you awaken a hophead who is passed out?  A. Wave a goblet of Hop Rod Rye under their nose.  The huge hop flavor carries on into your mouth on a small sip, a larger one simply coats the palate with oliy, bitter hops. Lots of American hops here - Cascade for sure, with a residual sugar-kissed bitterness that awakens the senses. Despite the hop and rye (which is quite noticeable), this is almost decently balanced with some hefty malt richness. That said, it's an extremely bitter, bracing beer.  Mouthfeel is creamy and hot, wet and boasts a sharp lingering bitterness that will make your toes curl.  Hop Rod is quite drinkable, despite the bitter factor, and is worlds better for the rye - it imbues the beer with life and character and saves it from being another ho-hum American DIPA. Hop Rod Rye has character to spare and is highly recommended.

This mixes w/ the incredibly fragrant hop aromas. We found citrus (grapefruit), mint, and cinnamon. (My kids help with the smelling phase.)  Taste Wow! There is a lot going on in that bottle, a lot of good stuff. First I though of the sprouted grain breads that you can buy in health food stores, especially the ones with dried fruit. There is a big malt base that's followed by a rye sourness. Then the hops hit with bitter and herbs and pine. A great balance, it all works together. I don't feel that any one thing overpowers, but I like sour. The after taste stays with you, and you want more.  MF. This beer has a thickness and weight and the carbonation seems just right. The after taste is quite dry considering the malty feel.  Drinkability- Huge tastes, I will be going back for more.  This went well with our pasta and sauce.

S- The rye sticks out a lot with nice caramel syrupy malts and very prominent hop tones. Earthy but roasty too.  T- Very roasty and a tad oaky. Hops are bittering and in your face. Alcohol lies in the back. Well balance and just awesome!  M- Medium thickness and high carbonation.  D- High drinkabilty to me but non hopheads will not find it as appealing I think. But, who cares?

610,3158,bobsy,4.8,"Oh crap...this is sublime. Bear Republic, I will try all of your beers I can find. Bottle at Volo.  Hop Rod Rye pours a nice deep mahogany, with a fluffy white head, that laces brilliantly. The aroma makes my knees weak - northwestern hops (predominantly grapefruit), caramel and nuts. The rye comes in with a really pleasing spiciness that compliment the hops perfectly. The taste is beautiful, with roasted nuts duelling for dominance with caramel malts and big bitter citric hops. Excellent balance between sweet and bitter. Crisp, spicy bitter finish and medium body reinforce the quality of this beer.  Absolutely amazing IPA that's verging on the imperial - I could drink it all night.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Hophead101,4,"Bear Republic - a favorite brewery of mine. Tasted tonite while watching Big Brother 9 - not that you care - but more for my record keeping purposes.  Poured into a chalice glass. let it sit from fridge temp for 10 minutes or so to warm up a bit.  The appearance was fantastic. A great looking beer - nice thick head, small and bubbly on the sides. A very nice almost dark burgandy brown. The head stuck around for quite some time. rather impressive.  Smell: great smell as well. hits the nose very hard. great hop aroma. fills the entire nostril. subtle hints of rye - predominantly a hop nose - some chooclate malt in there?  Taste: crisp top of the mouth hop taste. smell and hop taste seem to disconnected. but good flavor none the less. minimal rye flavor until the beer warms up - then it becomes much more pronounced.  Feel: lingering hop flavor which i thought was a bit too much. but don't get me wrong - the flavor is fantastic.  Drinkability: the lingering hops again takes a bit away from the drinkability.  all in all - this is one kick ass beer. Bear Republic does not dissapoint.

610,3158,DevilDogBeer,4.7,"Hop Rod Rye poured a slightly cloudy (bonus points for yeast!) orange color with a nice white head with small bubbles. The brew left nice lacing down the glass and the head had serious staying power. The smell was dominated by the abundance of hops in this brew. There was a subtle rye aroma in the back of the nose if you took a deep whiff in the glass. The taste was excellent. There was a distinct hop hit up front but it faded nicely and left no poor aftertaste. The rye was mostly hidden by the hops, however, a bit of a letdown since it is difficult to find a good rye. I did not let this deter me long as this beer was exceptional. The mouthfeel was robust and well rounded but did not make me fool or cringe from the high IBUs. This beer drinks well and is a great accompaniment to a strong flavored dish or as a dessert on its own! Cheers!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Damian,3.53,"Drank on-tap at Deep Ellum, Allston, MA  Poured a gorgeous, dark, russet mahogany with a tight, frothy, two-finger head of sticky foam. Excellent retention. The head deposited thick rings of lacing all down the sides of the glass.  The aroma was hoppy yet ultra smooth. Citrusy hops, ripe fruits and a touch of sugary goodness made this beer a wonder to inhale.  The taste however did not contain anywhere near the balance or the smoothness that the nose did. ""Hoppy"" barely begins to describe this beer. The piney, spicy, bracingly bitter hops appeared as soon as the beer hit my lips and never let up. A touch of malty sweetness came through on the front end, with some fruitiness appearing mid-palate. As the beer made its way to the back of my palate, the slight sourness of the rye became apparent as well. The finish was outrageously hoppy, piney and bitter with the flavors further intensifying in the lingering, dry and pithy finish.  Mouthfeel was a bit thin and watery for the style with a less than average amount of carbonation.  While the 8% ABV was hardly detectable, the completely unbalanced nature of this beer made it somewhat difficult to drink.This is one brew that should be enjoyed by only the most devoted of hopheads.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

The smells are of strong pine notes, grapefruit, and a slight bit of mint. Strong northwestern US hops for sure. There is also a slight spicy note from the 18% rye.  Taste is very strong and delicious. The spice is subtle but up-front. The spice from the rye lingers throughout the tasting. There is a maltiness and a malt sweetness but this blends perfectly with the huge hop bitterness and aroma. Really a spectacular blend of all these characteristics. And throughout it all is that spicy rye. Very clean and crisp finish that adds to the hop characteristic. Medium in body but very, very drinkable.  The aftertaste is piney and very strong but this only makes me want to drink more. Thankfully bear republic puts this into a bomber for me to take down.

Hops, pine sap and caramel with some light rye notes in there, but nothing overwhelming. Big hops here, but I would say this was rather well balanced. Dark, thick flavor to this brew, like a wafer cookie with dark chocolate chunks, although not as sweet.

Noticeable sediment in the bottle. First glass was a careful pour, second one let the sediment mix in... affecting the mouthfeel some but that was about it. The aroma is a great balance of roasted malted and piney and citrus hops. The taste is equally as impressive. Some lightly roasted, biscuity malts, and a big, fresh, fruity hops presence. Wonderful finish. Big and hoppy without becoming very cloying at all. It has a medium body, crisp, bitter texture, and soft carbonation.

Standard fruity belgian yeast smell, but more lightly than most of the style, and mixed with a dark roasty malt like smell and flavor as well. As it warms big notes of licorice come through and stay.

After several minutes, I'm able to get a little more beer into the glass and it eventually settles down into a downright beautiufl creamy retention that left some awesome spirals of thick lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is absolutely rich with a nice blend of roasted rye malts, some caramel sweetness, citrus notes, and piney hops.  The taste is initially sweet up front with a mix of roasted rye and caramel malts but then gives way to resinous hop bitterness that sticks and lingers on the palette before a final wash of sweetness comes in. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a very nice smooth and creamy feel.  I must say that the balance between the rye and piney hops in this beer is almost damn near perfect and is what really makes this great. As for drinkability, I was hard pressed to remember that this thing was 8% at the rate that the 22oz bottle disappeared.

610,3158,AltBock,4.48,"22 oz. bomber bottle that has slick black label of a vintage hot rod with flames on the doors and flames around the circle this car is in. To the far right of the label is just the Government warning and barcode. The far left side of the label is quite different. That side has a description of the beer, a Brew Master Note (that note talks about the sediment), refund values, address of the brewery, a small map to the brewery, and ""Sonoma County Ales"" in red and white letters. Bear Republic didn't bother to put on a best before or bottled on date anywhere.  Appearance: When poured into a Brooklyn Brewery Euro style pint glass, this beer appeared to be a dark mahagony brown, but instead it was a light crimson red that was blened in with some cherry red and orange. It started off with an off white colored 1/2 inch head of foam. In only about a few seconds, that head of foam changed into a creamy white film and streak after streak of creamy and bubbly white lace.  Smell: It had a very potent aroma of roasted rye (no duh!!), a pinch of dark roasted malts, a smidge of sweet caramel, a dab of juicy fruits, a few pine needles, and then all of this ended with dry roasted citrus hops. Although most of the aroma was malted rye, it was nice to see the rye let the other aromas come out and play. Even though the other aromas were small, it does remind me of the saying, ""a little bit goes a long way.""  Taste: This is where Bear Republic puts the rye in ""Hop Rod Rye!"" The taste has the same story as the aroma, although most of it is malted rye, the rye will let the other flavors come out and play. If you can't tell already, the taste started off heavy with malted rye, a pinch of dry roasted malts, and small dab of caramel. After the caramel, the malted rye hands over the torch to the dry roasted citrus hops, grapefruit, and pine. I still can't say the taste was finished. Sometimes after the hop bomb was over, in comes a small touch of bitter dark chocolate. I guess this taste wasn't allowed in by the malted rye and citrus hops, so after both of them were finished, it came in by itself.  Mouthfeel: The malted rye was the king of this beer and it made sure that this was known to your tastebuds. It they didn't know, the malted rye will assault them. It doesn't completely cover up the alcohol content. Some of the alcohol will get through and let you know you're drinking a 8% beer. The aftertaste is long lingering and contains more malted rye, roasted citrus hops, and a dash of pine.  Drinkability: I would be lying if I didn't say I wouldn't touch this beer again! This is a great beer and I will be buying this one again in the near future. If you like being assaulted by malted rye, then you better pick this one up ASAP.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

A nice easy pour yielded a two finger, rocky, cream colored head that floated on a deep red amber body. Lots of tiny bubbles making their way north. Great retention and giant chunks of lacing stuck to the glass. This is a pretty beer.  Has a rather zesty smell, very fresh. Smells of spruce, pineapple, and grapefruit with a smokey grass seed like malt presence. Obviously the rye.  Heavy citrus and pine flavor that really doesn't explode like I want it to. Maybe its the rye malts that keep the hops at bay. I crave a real explosion of hops in my elite IPA's. While this has a nice balance, it lacks that really big punch I was hoping for. The sweetness of the malts really comes to the forefront, pushing the balance towards their side of the ring.  A medium body with an oily, bitter hop finish.  Drinkability is on par.

Taste: Tangy, with that sweet cloying flavor that rye imparts. I love rye, and love to brew with it, so my impressions might be skewed, but I think it's delicious.  Mouth: Moderate body, but fairly slick and full finishing. Slightly tingly carbonation, and moderate alcohol warmth in the finish.  Overall: Tasty -- I like the stuff, a lot.

Nice slow pour and we have a nice crisp, clear mahogany amber color with a giant, frothy, tight head. Amazing retention and lacing, head ""dies down"" to a nice finger thick clumpy patch of bubbles and film. Inside of glass is pasted with clumps foam, as well as streaks. Yea, I like this, haha. S: Like Hopsickle, big punch of hops, but somehow I like this better. Not quite as bitter smelling, a little fresher. Mild citrus and a little pine. Strong presence of the rye malt as well, leaving a more balanced aroma than most ipas. Good stuff. T: Starts off dry and hoppy, but not overly bitter, strong presence of the rye malt providing nice balance. In the background more the grapefruit rhine from the nose, but very mild and not very sweet. Hops are there big time, but not bitter or palate destroying. M: Medium to full body, very smooth, creamy. Medium carbonation but not overly active. D: Probably my favorite IPA, just slightly ahead of Two Hearted and Blind Pig. Big time hop presence but perfect balance from malt and rye and not overly bitter or sweet.

This looks like a perfect power beer. Light rye-bread tones on the nose. Wafting bitterness expected for the style isn't hindered by excess carbonation. Honestly, I expected a little more here but the aroma is pleasant. I really need to let my beers open and breathe and get a little warm prior to pour...almost like you do with wine when talking about something powerful like this. Nice, hearty, bready structure - the rye almost feigns the tingle of carbonation here. Hops take a back seat in the first few sips but come back after about 20 minutes in force. A little earthy taste in the end. Well blended stuff with tangy finish. At first, it feels slightly sour but this evolves over time into more prevalent hop goodness.

610,3158,jbphoto88,4.03,"What a pretty brew. From a 22oz bottle this beer is a dark ruby and rust colored red. A thick fluffy head about an inch from the beer forms fast and leaves a nice webbing texture on the glass as you drink.  Smell is like a hoppy rye bread. I've never know any bakery to make that but if it smells like this beer that bread should be great. There is also some nice citrus scents and fine malt profile. A very nice nose.  Taste is all ipa. Its got some fine hop flavors with some sweet maltiness. There is a little citrus that leads to a metallic, astringent taste and feel. It is a little distracting from the brew but by no means a nail in the coffin. I can't taste any rye characteristics, they might be hidden by the hoppiness and bitterness in this beer.  This beer is a fine beer to have on hand. Its not too pricey and has a nice taste but it is not on the level of great IPA's.

610,3158,lightindarkness,4.48,"A big thanks to barefootbrewer for this one!  This is a surprisingly complex beer in everything from appearance to taste. On first try it has launched itself to one of my all time favorites.  Appearance is intriguing, with overall deep brown color, shining with amber highlights and darker reddish tones. A good creamy head sits for only a while, but leaves a nice web of lace. Streams of carbonation are visible at first, but obscured by the sediment when the last bit is poured.  Nose is filled with big fullness of rich caramelly malt and a juicy hopped up spine. Bready, with peach and grapefruit notes, spiced with a faint crisp scent of rye. A slightly off dankish hop whiff sneaks in, but does not interfere.  As for taste, crap, this is good. A crisp snap of rye rounds with a plenty of fullness in bready caramelly roasted malts - depth and flavor well outside of an IPA. Bitterness swells in the end, fuller and with less sharp attack than most IPAs or DIPAs. Finishes with grainy rye and bitterness softening to yeasty bread. A good deal of alcohol is detectable at the beginning, lessening as it warms and sits.  A nice rich yet medium bodied beer. Creamy smooth, with hints of dryness offset by sticky slightly oiled hop feel. Nice full carbonation.  Complex and flavorful in drinkability. Not so high in terms of mass consumption, but certainly for overall character and attraction.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Proteus93,4.37,"A: A deep copper brown pour with a nicely foarming, foamy head. Slightly off-white, not too sticky, but great presentation.  S: Very hoppy, a bit of a floral aroma seeping through it all. An alcohol smell - notable smells of the rye, though there was a hint of a metallic aroma sneaking through very subtly.  T: Pungent, resiny hops. The infused rye flavours are quite strong, perhaps even a little more than expected. They found a way to blend the two distinct flavours very nicely, though. Similar to smell, a very slight metallic taste came through, though it could be that I'm smelling and tasting something a little off. A touch of warm malts provide a touch of balance. Quite an intriguing flavour.  M: A medium-heavy body. Wet, but leaves enough coating to allow the flavour to sink into the tongue.  D: A bit more arrogance than with some, but I tend to use that word when describing the body and taste of some of the harder liquors. Perhaps I'm putting too much into the rye elements. Ultimately, though, a good flavour, and a moderately easy drink. Take it easy, and enjoy it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,John_M,4.35,"On tap at Max's on Superbowl Sunday....  The beer pours a hazy, orange/amber color with very good head retention and lacing. On the nose the beer is very IPA-like, with lots of floral citrus and lime. On the palate the beer is quite delicious, with the rye flavor quite noticeable. The rye gives the beer a somewhat dry aspect, but also some additional complexity. There is plenty of citrus as well, and the beer is surprisingly light on its feet for such a hoppy beer with 8% abv. The beer comes across as quite drinkable, with a cascade of bitter all through the finish. Just delicios.  Another very fine beer from Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,watchnerd,4.52,"Om yom yom, this is a delicious beer. Almost an IPA, yet not, the normal west coast IPA hops being balanced out by an intriguing creaminess on the finish. Is it because of the rye? Special malts?Or secret Bear Republic elves? Dunno, but this brew is good, and unique. The only downside is that, like the Stone Ruination, the taste experience is intense enough that you need to give your palate a rest afterwards. And the drinkability takes a hit due to the high-ish ABV.  Bear Republic might be one of the most under-rated breweries with the widest range of good beers: Racer 5, Racer X, and Black Bear are all good to amazing beers.

What I did pick up was fairly clean hops with a slight roasty chocolate? T: I tried this beer both warm and cold. What I found cold was very lack luster. The hops were nice and shapr on the back with a slight grainy nuttiness. Kind of seem watered down to me. once a tad warm I picked up very very light chocolate with a nice solid malty sweetness.

610,3158,younger35,4.7,"Grabbed a bomber of this brew on my resent trip to Chicago. This will be my first taste of Bear Republic beer and Im glad its this one. Drank from my snifter while watching the Chargers vs. Patriots.  Appearance- Pours a murky reddish orange with breaking hues of yellow where the light is allowed to pass. Loads of yeast is floating about in my glass below a half finger super white head. The frothy top recedes fairly quickly leaving a lily pad like head, thin collar and a good amount of lacing. Smell- Raw and piney with enough earthy hops to really dominate the nose. Maybe a bit of floral lilac and grapefruit citrus but for the most part its pine and grass. Some brown sugar sweetness and some spicy bits of rye come through as well. Big bold hoppy nose! Taste- The hop aroma seems to permeate my entire mouth with this rich floral lilac flavor that is extremely unique and extremely good. Loads of caramel malt adds a bit of balance to this brew but lets face it, the hops rule. Hop flavors reminiscent of oranges, grapefruit and even some lemon zest are present as well. The rye is another great addition to the beer that adds a bit of spiciness along with the abundance of yeast. Finishes with a lingering bitter floral aftertaste with a small amount of rye nuttiness. Mouthfeel- Medium body with a slick oiliness and a spicy, tingly feel on the tongue. Sharp, aggressive carbonation. Drinkability- This is an absolutely wonderful beer. The hop profile in this brew is unlike anything Ive ever tasted. Its perfectly to that point (for me anyway) of hoppiness where its not overpowering but assertive and tasty. This is the 2nd brew with rye in it Ive had in a week or so and something about the addition of it just takes a beer to a whole other level. Great beer that I wish I had access to.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,LittleBreeze,3.92,1/17/2008  The aroma was a mix of pine and citrus. Relaxing smell. This one is crisp and clean. A slight bitterness balanced with a slight sweetness.

610,3158,Ryanbob,4.82,This beer pours with a big head and a nice amber color. It smells great with lots of hops coming through. It tastes malty first with sweet raisan and alcohal burn.

610,3158,DIM,4.49,"a: This beer is dark orange color with amber hilights. Pour with a big white head that dissipates quickly.  s: I got this bottle at Capone's and it is super fresh, bottled about 3 weeks ago. A huge overwhelming piny hop aroma just about knocked me over while pouring this one. Underneath that there is citrus notes to the hop. Beneath all that there is a whisper of sour grains and sugar. They could market this as cologne and charge a hell of a lot more than 6 bucks a bottle.  t: There is not a lot of complexity here, but I love this beer. The piny hop dominates here as well, though some grapefruit or lemon does peek through. There is a bit of sweetness and a hint of sour rye on the finish. As it warms the rye becomes a bit more pronounced.  m: A bit of a let down here. The carbonation is fine, but the body is a bit thin.  d: I'll certainly buy more of these.

Beautiful mahogany color with a thick creamy head that left lots of lacing but didn't retain as well as other reviewers seem to have experienced. Very well could have been due to a poorly washed glass, but who knows.  Smell was beautifully hoppy. Predominantly piney but there is a load of citrus in there as well, not to mention a little bit of rye spiciness.  Taste was very hoppy as well, but a bit reversed. Seemed more citrusy than piney, but it had a nice malt backbone to balance it out. Couldn't really make out much rye in there, i don't think i am really quite aware of what it adds to a beer. hmm. Anyway, tastes great.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin and oily, but not so bad that it truly detracts much from an otherwise amazing beer. For such a strong hoppy beer this is very drinkable.

Lacing stayed high on the glass throughout the tasting. Nose hits you long before you pour, and is all the pine and citrusy goodness you would expect. Now prepared for the taste that I have come to love. Immediate blast of Tomahawk/Columbus hops with a nicely balanced maltiness and the harsh reality of a rye finish. This beer is so damn good. It's my current favorite AIPA, and it's always available where I live. I like to take some time between pours of this beer, since it does get in your face a bit.

BIG thanks to Vancer.  i'm drinking this tonight out of a new sam adams glass.  the beer poured a ruby red with a hint of cherry. i pour pretty hard, and i got about an inch or better of creamy head that stuck around for a couple minutes, leaving some rather nice lacing on the glass.  HUGE hoppy smell, pine, a hint of citrus. big on the hops, as the name would suggest. a very robust smell, but the smell seemed to fade very quickly. once the head was gone, the HUGE robust hops smell was gone. if it had stuck around longer i could have rated this a half a point higher.  the taste is again hops, pine, very bitter, but finishes surprisingly clean. it leaves the mouth a little dry, but that just makes me want another sip, which at 8% can get pretty hairy pretty quickly. i'm also picking up a good citrusy sweet taste that i think balances out the tartness quite nicely. i'm not a huge fan of ipa's, but this one tastes good.  this beer feels real good and thick in the mouth. very carbonated i mentioned dry earlier, but i don't sense the dryness in this category. superb here.  ok, i originally put down (before i finished the review, in my notes) a 3.5 for drinkability, but upon further ponderance (i will commonly make up words, hopefully they make sense) it is a helluva drinkable ipa. (i'd also like to add here that the new firefox things helluva is a real word and doesn't tell me i misspelled something)  so... this one pretty easy to drink. i'm comparing it to masala mama, which i just had a couple days ago. this is a damn drinkable ipa.  thanks again Vancer!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,illidurit,4.28,"Poured into my Ruination pint glass. Dark amber with ruby hues and a dense light tan head of 3 fingers. Lacing and retention are very good.  The aroma is intensely hoppy, with pine and grapefruit exuding from the glass. Caramel/toffee malt notes are barely detectable behind the hop barrage.  Taste is initially sweet as the malt hits the tongue, but it's sharply interrupted by a strong bitter hoppiness that lasts forever on the palate. With warmth one can perceive the spiciness of the rye.  Mouthfeel is oily from the hops but the bitterness dries it out a little. Medium bodied, almost more into double IPA territory, and adequate carbonation.  High abv for a single IPA makes this less drinkable than one would expect for the style. The huge bitterness also might turn some people away, but the sweet-to-bitter dynamic kept me coming back for another sip without fail.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,letsgopens,4.85,"This IPA pours very woody ruby brown with gorgeous ruby highlights. The off-white head holds pretty well with just a bit of spotty lace. After the head recedes it can be rejuvenated with a quick swish or by freshening up your glass from the bottle. Phenomenal looking with that luscious woody visible texture that often implies deep sprucy, bitter, hops.  Huge, sharp, piny, hops. Spruce; sticky and resinous in the nose. Talk about anticipation. Some nice caramel malt and bitter citrus. Bright and semi-sweet with some distinct breadiness and light toffee. Pungent and mouthwatering. I don't think it gets much better than this. Everything I look for in an IPA and more. Unique, complex, and wildly aromatic.  Heavy, floral and bitter on the tongue. Hops, hops, and more sprucy, piny, resinous hops. The well pronounced caramel malt provides a slightly sweet and substantial canvas for the hops. Ok, more about the hops; spicy and herbal with lots of citrus tied in as well. Citrus contributes in a big way. Orange and bitter grapefruit pith. Cracked black pepper and coriander. Interesting spicy rye focuses in the middle. Juicy and slick in flavor and texture and not dry. I'm actually going to tie the flavor in with mouthfeel as far as the review is concerned because of how well they compliment each other.  The hops linger so well throughout the finish and beyond that they dominate the texture of the brew. The fact that these huge, boisterous flavors can be balanced so well is a large testament to this beers craftsmanship. Lingering floral hops come through with a clean slick finish. One of the all time best beers I've ever had. An absolute treat to consume and to evaluate. A masterpiece of malty, hoppy deliciousness.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,jmalex,3.91,"A special purchase from my trip to California last month. I figured I'd better crack it open while the hops are still in all their glory.  APPEARANCE: Pours into my Victory becker glass a mostly clear amber-red with some crimson highlights. The head is off-white and quite large at 2 fingers high. It eventually drops to a full surface coating with tons of lacing.  SMELL: The aromas don't jump out at you tremendously, but a resinous, west coast hop profile is unmistakable. Citrusy and grassy hop aromas come out immediately. But they're nicely balanced by a decent malty sweetness that is just a bit toasty.  TASTE: Whoa, after the seemingly balanced aroma, the taste leans waaay toward the hoppy side. Resinous and sticky, the hops have predominantly citrusy and grassy notes as in the smell. A malt backbone shows itself slightly as the beer crosses the palate and in toward the finish. I'm not particularly experienced with rye beers, but not too much stands out to indicate the presence of rye - maybe a slight twang, but I'm not too sure.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium to medium-full bodied, this is a sticky, syrupy beer. The carbonation is at an average level.  DRINKABILITY: It's a big beer, but the alcohol doesn't show itself at all. I'm pretty sure, though, that 1 bomber is enough. It's certainly a well-made beer and something that I'd buy again if the mood struck me.  A very solid, delicious offering from Bear Republic. It seems like I can get any beer I want here in Pennsylvania, but these guys from California are one of the few that don't distribute here.

Leaves a good bitterness on the tongue.  m: Good carbonation, chewy, sticky texture, medium to heavy body.  d: An enjoyable brew, the rye provides an excellent balance to the substantial hop presence.

610,3158,rxdrewthejew,4,"Poured from a bomber into my Stone tulip glass.  A: Jumps out right from the beginning that this is not your usual IPA. Very dark, reddish-brown. Big white fluffy head that leaves major lacing and retention. Tons of sediment and plenty of tiny bubbles.  S: Citrus hop bitterness and some sweetness. There's a scent that I associate with what breweries smell like, though not exactly sure what it is.  T: Bitter from start to finish, plenty of citrus and pine and even some floral. Deep sweet malt character is hidden below this but quite detectable, and the rye gives it a bit of a different, perhaps tangy, taste. It's not blaringly obvious, but it is noticeable.  MF: Very smooth and enough carbonation to give it some bite. Alcohol is well masked. Easy to sip and easy to glug.  D: The rye gives it a somewhat unique flavor among IPAs, and it'd be a good beer without the rye too. It's good. For me, it's not great. I'm not really sure what else to say. Very solid offering.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,bluemoonswoon,4.6,"22oz bomber poured into pint glass  A: Pours a cloudy dark copper, like a dirty penny, with a two inch thick loosly packed tan and toffee head. Has a nice tapering color effect with it going from almost black from under the cap to a lighter copper near the bottom. Decent amount of sticky lacing clings to the glass all the way down, very pretty.  S: Subtle grapefruit and pine with a lemony nuttiness and fresh spiced bread crust, smells like something you might bite into not something you would drink, very good.  T/MF: Malt presents itself from the start which is nice to see in an ipa, really more nutty and pine like in the hops than the bitter citrus flavors of grapefruit and orange that typify the style, it is nice to see a change of balance here. Really crunchy mouthfeel that leaves the tongue a bit slick but wanting more. Just a well balanced IPA, nuts and pine all over the place with a good malt backbone to balance things out, great offering here.  D: I LOVE this beer, always come back to it. Though it might not be the best IPA out there I will always reach for this one when I see it, YUM.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Durge,3.73,"A deep brown tea colored brew with a big off-white head and sturdy lacing. The aroma is of mellow pine hops with some sweet apple cider in a malt background. The flavor is a bit unique with a combination of bitter, earthy hops and sweet licorice malt. A bready base in a very full bodied and evenly carbonated ale. Not a typical IPA but quite good, not quite as much of that rye quality as I was hoping for, but an excellent ale just the same. Fairly drinkable for an 8% beauty, alcohol is not dominant here I don't think. Very much recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

T - I don't get much sweetness here - only as an undertone. The rye is full and nice, married well with the hop finish. Very dry beer; finishes nicely.

610,3158,pwoods,4.63,"22oz. brown bomber purchased a Jungle Jim's, poured into an imp pint. No dating.  A: Pours an almost blood red.. absolutely stunning. 3+ big ass fingers of super rocky, slightly tinted head. Pretty good retention and nice patching.  S: Piny and Citrus hops all over the place with a nice alcohol rye filling the background. Malts are just barely seen and only when it warms a bit, adding just a bit of light husk.  T/M: Nice crisp, clean, piny and grapefruit hops with good bitterness and much more rye than expected from the smell. Alcohol gives just a tiny pinch and done. Malts are controlled but give just enough balance to round things out. Slightly sweet and nutty. Body is fairly light and carbonation average. Finish is drying and bittering with defined rye notes. Would like to see just a tiny bump up in the malt department, but this is still very tasty nonetheless.  D: Goes down easy and invites for more.

S: Nice hop aroma, more citrus overtones than pine.  T: Big hop flavor with a very long-lasting hop bitterness.  M: Very clean finish, with no bread-like aftertaste. Nice.  D: Don't know if the 18% rye in the mash had anything to do with it, but clearly a very clean, hoppy, goes-down-easy IPA.  Comments: I've never used rye in any of my homebrew recipes, but might have to reconsider after trying this beer. Well done, BR.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,kosmoraios,4.45,"Pours a dark amber cherrywood color into my pint glass with about 1 finger of white head which lingers on the ale. This is darker than any IPA I've had, with the exception of Stone's 11th Anniversary ale, classified as a ""Dark IPA"" according to them.  Aroma is of hops! Fruity, pungeant, lovely hops. Citrus, pine. The rye comes through as well, lending a dark malty tinge to the aroma.  Taste is amazing. Certainly a nice, bitter IPA, but the 18% rye gives it some interesting depth. There are undertones of overripe plum and fig beneath the citrussy bitterness of the hops.  Mouthfeel is very light and carbonated, with less of the phenolic oilyness I associate with Imperial IPAs. A very drinkable ale, mainly due to this and the fact that the 8% ABV is undetectable.  I will certainly make a special trip for some more of these. Kudos to Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,madjr80,4.75,I had this beer at Bukowski's Bar in Boston. This was a great quality sipping beer. I wouldn't want to make this my session beer.

610,3158,JayQue,4.78,"A fantastic IPA experience. Pours a deep clear mahogany color with a huge off white head. Sheets of lacing left on the glass. Good strong and pleasant hops smell but it can't do justice to the taste experience. The taste begins with crisp, sharp hops. Bitter but pleasant and rich tasting, more pine than citrus. As the beer warms up, the hops do not give way, but there is a strong caramel malt taste as an undercurrent. The mouthfeel is incredibly rich, not as oily / resinous as Celebration Ale...more crisp. Drinkability is very good, too high an abv for a session beer, but I was left wanting more after draining a 22 oz'er. Will definitely seek this one out again!!!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Homerbag,4,"Dark murkey red with heavy head that laces heavily down the pint. Citruisy hops are up front with notes of pine, caramel malt, but little rye. Taste of citruisy hops in back, some malt in front with a heavy dose of pine across the middle. Feels good, coats the tounge just enough to let all the hop sink in and suprise you with the rye finish. A very good IPA for hopheads with a craving for something to go along with the hop.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Dogbrick,4.22,"Pours a deep reddish-amber color with a thick and rocky light tan head that has good staying power. Patchy lacing. Big piney hops aroma that has a good citrus and malt presence as well. Rich body with a dry, hoppy character. Notes of citrusy grapefruit, pine and a solid caramel malt base. Alcohol is well-hidden but definitely there. The finish is dry and hoppy, and only here does the rye flavor show up with any force.

610,3158,ArrogantB,3.58,"On tap at the Falling Rock and I actually ordered it mostly out of excitement that Bear Republic might be coming back to Colorado. I did not like this when I had it for the first time last year but I figured why the hell not give it a second chance? It was dark red, and smelled like orange rinds. The taste was rye at first and then delicious citrus. Unfortunately the rye ruined it for me, the finish was not enough to make up for that rye up front. Very strange flavors for an IPAbut I am still looking forward to Racer 5.  update 05/2014 actually not a bad rye beer, feels more like a strong ale than an IPA though.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Sleestak,4.6,"Picked this 22oz'er up at the local liqour store. I am a big fan of BR's Racer 5 so thought I'd give this one a try. According to the bottle ""made with 18% rye"". Pours a beautiful burgandy brown with a considerable fluffy head. Pungent floral hops abound along with a good deal of pine and just a tad of citrus. A hop explosion in the taste. Floral and citrus-y hops mainly with lots of caramel sweetness. But make no mistake, this is a hop loaded brew. The alcohol doesn't make itself known in the taste even at 8%. Thick lacing as I make my way down. Thick creamy mouthfeel. A powerful beer though not overpowering in any way.

Lots of citrusy hops, and the rye shows up well, smell is remeniscent of a fresh baked loaf of dark rye. Taste is less hoppy than i expected from the aroma. The rye shows up very nicely. and a bit of citrusy hop flavor comes thru shortly thereafter. Mouthfeel is very smooth, some resiny texture towards the finish, nice and moist. Drinkability is quite good. Would pair well with some corned beef, maybe even a reuben on rye bread. Well done.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,hellcatsjg,4.24,"Appearance: Dark ruby coloring with a thin tan head. Good bit of lacing as you go.  Smell: Smells great. Wonderful combination of spices, sweet fruits, and citrusy hops.  Taste: Good, but does not fulfill what was detected in the smell. Sweet and spicy at first gives way almost immediately to a citrus hop flavor. Could have used more rye, or perhaps it is just overpowered by the hops, which I suppose is to be expected since this is classified as an IPA and not a Rye beer.  Mouthfeel: Hops coat the mouth nicely and leave just the right amount of bitterness behind. Does not overpower with the hops to the point of being too much.  Drinkability: Very nice IPA. Sweet and hoppy is a good combination for me. The ABV is reasonable, and this is not overpowering, so this is quite drinkable.

610,3158,gwood,4.83,"22oz poured to a Sammy Smith Imperial Pint...  Pours a deep crimson red with accents of mahogony when backlit. The pour was a bit too agressive and I ended up with a massive three plus fingers of thick, sticky, frothy off white head that formed valleys and peaks as it began to settle from being so rudely awakened. The head refuses to give up on this brew, lacing it's way in glittered heartbeat ring patterns ALL the way down to the bottom inch of my pint glass. What a sexy brew...can't wait to try it.  Hops climb out of this beer in droves. Strong citrus notes followed by a good deal of malt hanging on the tongue in the middle, followed up by a long crisp finish. This beer really improves in character as it warms up a bit, seems to bring out some of the rye charateristics more, quite a nice change from the sweet middle present in some of the other beers in this style. I think that it is really one of the key factors that sets this beer apart from some of it's peers.  This is a highly drinkable, medium bodied, ass kicking, name taking IPA from our good friends at Bear. May they continue to give the world great gifts for many years to come.

The taste was great! The first that that hits you is the citrus blast of the hops... not too much... very nice. Then the rye bread taste comes into play.

The smell of mild piney hops filled the nose upon the first sniff and a hint of a spice or two.  The taste was not as inviting as the aroma. A little weak on the flavor. All I could taste was hops and that was about it. Not what I expected from past ale's from this brewery!

Taste - Initial taste of toasty caramel malts, with a touch of a biscuity quality. Malt is immediately beaten into submission by the hops. Hops match the nose. Fruity/citrusy/orange hops dominate the palete. The finish is dry and spicy with a long lingering hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Chewy with a prickly carbonation.  Overall this is one impressive beer.

610,3158,tpd975,4.18,"This one came in a trade from ByTor2112.  A: An absolutely beautiful beer. Pours the deepest of red, almost black in color until you hold it up to the light. Once placed in the light a beautiful garnet color is revealed. There is some sediment in the glass floating around like snow in a snow globe. The head is big thick and rocky. With a now empty glass beside me I am enjoying the spider web type lacing all the way down the glass.  S: Nice big aromas. Nice hoppy citrus aroma... Big and Bold! There is a hint of spice probably from the rye, and a nice sweetness is picked up as the aroma travels farther into my nose.  T: Wow! The taste is soo inviting. Wonderful bold tastes that mesh with each other to make a perfect marriage. Right from the start you are hit with hops. Big sweet cascades with the power of citrus. A malty sweetness comes in and finishes with a hint of the spicy rye. Yum!  M: Medium bodied with a dry crisp finish.  D: Uber. Wish I had more than one bomber of this one.  Overall: I have had many rye beers all of which I thought were nice and unique in their own right. But this beer is the reason other brewers are using rye. They have tried this beer and decided they want to make one of their own. Well try as they may this one will be hard to replicate. It is a perfect beer that has everything. Tons of hops, tons of flavor and a drinkability factor that is off the scale for such a big beer.  If I could get my hands on this beer regularly I would be such a happy man.

610,3158,JerzDevl2000,4.18,"Picked this up a few months back up at Downtown Wine and Spirits in Massachusetts. Bear Republic's offerings are not available in this neck of the woods, and their beers on tap that I've had in New York City were wonderful. When I saw this, I was excited to try it out, and for the most part, those needs were met. Having a big bottle is just the icing on the cake!  This had a beautiful, translucent mahogany brown hue to it, and a rich head to match. Of course, there's hops here, and they have a west coast flavor to them, but the rye balances out well with them and the aftertaste is just above that of a dry-hopped beer. It's not as buttery as Sierra Nevada or up-front as stone, but I can pick up some pine and earthy tones here, with just a hint of citrus and metal underneath everything. This works well for an IPA, but the heaviness of this makes it worthy enough to be enjoyed as a warmer, additionally. Having lacing on the side of my glass is a good touch, but what works for me is the balance of this. It's not a hop wallop!  The 8.0% ABV is just right, and I easily downed the whole bottle without feeling too rushed or too drunk from the alcohol. I haven't had a lot of beers with rye as a main taste factor, but I'm certainly glad that I got my hands on this one. It's full-flavored, full-tasting, and full of craft brewing enjoyment. Seeing an IPA that is just a bit more subdued is a welcome change for me, and will probably be for anyone else looking for a variation on this style.

Bitterly hoppy from the jump, but gradually balanced by some hearty rye malts. Nectarine, grapefruit, and date characterize the hop flavor, with the malts revealed in a toasted breadiness.

The taste easily eclipses the smell. Hops ride this one from start to finish but are complemented very nicely by the addition of rye. It adds a different kick and flavor to the beer which is very nice. A solid malt backbone helps to create a wonderfully balanced beer that's got quite a kick to it.

Some floral hops mixing with some fruity hops. Sweet maltiness and a hint at the alcohol hidden in this one also came through.  Hops take tghe spotlight in this one.

A bit soapy and grainy. The taste is very bold. There is an instantaneous burst of bitter american hops that dominate most of the sip. In the back are lingering notes of hearty, toasted grains.

Little carbonation activity in a still glass, but swirling produces many tiny bubbles that ascend in streams from the side and bottom of the glass. Aromas of pungent rye spiciness and malt sweetness. The hop aroma is on a level with the rye spice and seems hidden but reveals itself with a mild raw cone smell. Taste is explosive. I love rye beer and this is a tasty one. There is a hazelnut nuttiness that's pretty subtle. The malt is not hidden and is the beer's source of sweetness. Bitter and dry-hopped flavors are of grapefruit. Mouthfeel is very smooth to creamy. With so many positive flavors and textures the result is a complex and delicious brew. Everything just comes together for a solid aroma/flavor profile. Bear Republic is above average and consistent with it's quality. Decant this beer to keep the yeast sediment in the bottle.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,SilentSabre,3.8,"Part of a nice haul my mother-in-law brought back from a recent visit home to San Francisco. Poured much darker than I expected for an IPA. A nice dark reddish bronze colour. Lovely craggy foamy head. Huge floral hops in the nose. While malt is present, this is definitely more hops than malt. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and the 8%abv is well concealed. This is a very nice, very drinkable IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,MiguelMandingo,4.45,"This beer is f**king awesome. That is a direct quote from my notes on this brew. In fact, the friend that I was sharing this beer with said this at the EXACT same time I did. What is great about this beer is that it is more than affordable at $3.49 a bomber, and it is one of the best IPAs available.  Poured part of a 22oz. bomber into a DFH shaped pint glass.  Appearance  This looks nothing like a standard IPA, but it still looks freakin delicious. It is very a dark, deep, transparent brown/ruby color. On the first pour it produced a two finger cream colored head, and left a TON of lacing the further along I drank.  Smell  This brew contains notes of orange zest, grapefruit, a little pine and roasted malt. Very hoppy. The smell is very indicative of what the flavor will be.  Taste  Man, oh man, this beer tastes good. The balance in this beer is remarkable. All of the flavors in the scent are contained in the taste. The front is bitter hops, bready roasted malt and the slightest touch of rye.  Mouthfeel  Goes down extremely smooth. The carbonation level couldnt be much better. Medium bodied for an IPA.  Drinkability  This beer is so drinkable, it is almost scary. It is extremely deceptive  I couldnt even tell it had a 8% ABV from tasting it; although I could definitely feel it by the end of the bomber. I would happily drink two bombers in one evening, and if it came in a six pack here in Texas, I would definitely be slurring right about now.  This one is worth searching out. Sucks to be you if you havent had it. My life hasnt been the same since they started selling it here in Texas a few weeks ago. I know on this website HRR is rated higher than the Stone IPA, but I have some arguments with that. It is almost as good as the Stone IPAAlmost I guess the Stone just has a special place in my heart.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,kimcgolf,4.58,"Poured from the bomber to a bright copper color with thick, creamy off-white head that lasted through the entirety and left excellent lacing. Strong aroma of floral-citrus hops and sweet malt. Mouthfeel was full and somewhat biting, offset nicely by the malt. Flavor starts out on the floral-hop side, with the malty sweetness creeping in shortly after.  This all leads to a long full, bittersweet finish, and although the 8% alcohol was well hidden in the nose and aroma, it made its presence known by the end of the beer. All and all, a very good ber, and I wish we could find Bear Republic in ATL.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Risser09,4.48,"22 oz bottle from 2007 poured into a wine glass  Appearance: Pours a dark brown color with shades of copper. The tan head rises to about 1.5 inches and slowly falls down. Plenty of lacing is left behind.  Smell: Wow grapefruit. Plenty of it along with blood orange, pine needles, sweet basil and honey.  Taste: Blasted with a juiy hop flavor immediately. Fresh squeezed grapefruit and sugary orange. Pine is there is the finish. This is an impressive beer but isn't as complex as it should be in the taste department.  Mouthfeel: This beer, along with many other rye beers, excels in this area. Despite the hopped up aroma and taste, it remains consistently smooth and endearing. There is a dryness at the finish that is accompanied by an alcohol bite. Well done.  Drinkability: Very nice, although the alcohol will slow you down at some point. This is one worth seeking out, but is not as preferable to me as a Double Simcoe or Hop Slam. However, these bottles are a steal for what they are priced at, so buy a few whenever you see them.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Onslow,4.15,"Pours with a big tan-cream head, 2-3 fingers - has good lasting power  Smell is a delicious burst on the opening of the bottle 'like an english style imperial ipa'  Taste is bold and pure, Good powerful flowery hoppiness - has a special something something  Enjoyable and smooth- assertive yet graceful...I like bears... the bitterness just coats the mouth as you drink... and not a bad buy economically either...  I can very easily see why this is a staple in most fridges!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,franksnbeans,4.05,"IPA? If thats the case then this is one of a kind. Pours a dark brown with sediment everywhere, good head that dissapates slowly and when I finished the beer, there was still a coat of lacing covering the entire pint glass. Smells of hops, citrus, fig, rind, malt. Tastes as it smells and finishes with big bitter hops. Full in the mouth with great carbonation. Drinkability is good but more than a bomber or two could lead to choking down a delicious craft brew. A must try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,beeragent,4.1,"After trying this with a friend at the Flying Saucer and really enjoying it, I decided to buy a bottle and review it. Poured into a pint glass from a bomber. The beer pours a deep amber/brown, forming a thick creamy 1 inch head that slowly fades. Medium spots of lace stick to the glass. The aroma is very strong hops, along with a light smell of sweet malt and caramel. The flavor is absolutely wonderful! A good balance of the hops and malts. Citrusy hops dominate the front, followed closely by the malt, and finishing with a sweet caramel flavor. Very complex and full. Medium mouthfeel. Extreme flavor and higher than usual abv. keep this from being an all-night drinker, but still exceptionally drinkable for an IPA. Overall, I was very impressed with this ale. This is among the better IPAs that I've tried. I would highly recommend this!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,bluejacket74,4.38,"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a red/amber color with about a half inch off-white head. The aroma is citrusy and pine hops, along with some malt and spice. Taste is hoppy (pine and grapefruit), with peppery spice, caramel, and grain/bread. There's a good mix between the mild malty sweetness and the hoppy bitterness, it's well balanced. The rye is a nice addition to this brew. Mouthfeel is medium, slick, creamy and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good too, the alcohol is well hidden and it's good and tasty. I think this is a pretty good beer overall. I haven't tried too many of Bear Republic's beers, but the ones I've tried have all been quality.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,JudgeRoughneck,3.85,"OK first of all I am not reviewing this as an IPA. Nothing about this beer is IPA as far as I'm concerned. That noted...we will proceed.  The beer is a beautiful clear rosewood color and has a nice thin, rust-tinted head that fades to a thin layer. It leaves fragments of lace. The spicy nase gives a boquet of alefruit and fresh orange. Very inviting. The taste is a simple but lovely swirling of big ale fruit esters, perfectly proportioned rye kick, crystal malt, and herbal hop all melding together for one very co-hesive brew. I might call this an ""Imperial Amber"".  Mouthfeel is alive with rye and carbonation. It is a little stingy but this helps accentuate much of the flavor profile (specifically hops, rye, esters) and does much to add drinkability to what would be an otherwise oppressive full body. As beer warms and carbonation dissapates it actually gets nice and creamy. Man this beer is a journey.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,kernalklink,3.59,"Good A IPA from Bear republic- nice color, light amber on the pour with some lacey head. Aromas were good as well, not too overpowering and the hops really come through the othe scents present. Taste was somewhat harsh- mouth puckering hops hid most of the malt counterbalance and an odd citric aftertaste dominated the finish. I was dissapointed that there was not more rye flavor present, the idea of a combination of the hops and rye was exciting to me, especially in an american IPA. I really dont understand the hype- its a decent beer but BR has made much bigger and better than this one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,bgraney,3.38,"Deep red, mild carbonation, white foamy head. Surprisingly, not much hop aroma, mostly a yeasty/biscuity aroma. Tasty hop bitterness, lemony with a definite alcohol hit, somewhat sweet. Leaves behind an enjoyable lemon tang that lingers throughout the mouth. The sweetness may prevent multiple glasses but I think a couple is a good idea. I should point out that I had this on tap recently and that would have received higher ratings than the bottled version.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,balconybrew,4.03,"Poured into a nonic glass from the bomber. Pours a reddish brown with a medium size head that feel rather fast, leaving a ring of foam and some lacing. The aroma is of ""C"" hops, but I wanted more. (it may be the hop head in me) I don't smell any malt. The flavor is full of hop bitteness, with a great ending. The taste starts with hops melds to malt (missing some rye) and back to hop ending. It finishes a little dryer then expected. (maybe the yeast and rye) For being 8% abv, I didn't get any alcohol taste or warmth. Great beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,allengarvin,4.23,"Great pour! Served into a pint glass, this murky reddish-brown beer has about an inch of long-lasting foam on top. Hugely hoppy aroma, just bursting in floral, citrusy hop scents, with a tinge of fruitiness at the edge. Flavor is all about the hops as well. There's some residual malt sweetness that adds balance, and some fruity yeast character, but the main flavor from start to finish is luscious hops. Finish is crackerly dry. I don't find much rye malt taste in here, though.  Top-notch IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,slagle9480,4.2,"A: Great red body with an off-white colored head that held rather well.  S: Aside from the hops, I could smell pine and some citrus flavors.  T: Wow, this is a great beer. This is my first from the west coast Bear Republic... I love it. BR definitely loaded up on the hops with this one. Definitely a hop-head's taste. Also notes of citrus flavors but nothing that compromises the hoppiness.  M: Lush. Delicious. Totally smooth. Great beer.  D: This category doesn't even need to be filled out. Just go buy the damn beer. If I lived closer to Cali this would be stocked in my fridge.

610,3158,MICAMD,4.16,"A- A perfectly clear dark orange liquid fills the glass and a massive, thick, foamy head makes itself at home on the top. Some streams of bubbles keep the head around for awhile. The mead maintains itself for the entire time, it's wonderful. Leaves some excellent lacing.  S- Fairly light in the smell department. What is there is some citrus and grassy hops. The malt aroma is very caramely.  T- An excellent balance of grassy, citrus, and pine hops with the malt. Not overpowering or harsh. Just a nice, smooth, well balance IPA. The rye is very light.  M- Wonderful. Very smooth and doest not build on the palate at all.  D- Awesome. At 8% this goes down like water. The hops are not harsh, its very smooth, and the alcohol is not noticeable at all. Dare I say a sessionable 8% IPA?",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BMoney575,4.44,"Sampled on 7-29-07  Pours a surprisingly dark red/ambers with a nice off-white head that leaves spider-web lacing on the glass.  The smell is clean, grassy hops, with just a hint of citrus and malt.  Taste is all big, fruity hops at first and then the perfect match of earthy, malty, and bitter to keep everything straight. Absolutely fantastic.  Mouthfeel is great, with a nice hoppy thickness.  Drinkability is terrifyingly good, at 8%.  Overall, not what I was expecting at all. Given the title and the abv, I was looking for a balls-to-the-wall double IPA. What I got was one of the cleanest, most well balanced, and most easy to drink IPAs I've ever had. Highly, highly, recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,tempest,3.98,"Big yet relatively well-balanced IPA. The malt combined with a spicy undertone with the big citrus and slightly juicy hops that showed off a bit of orange rind at the end. While this had a big and tasty hops flavor, the aroma was a little weak and the taste wasn't that complex. It was a great beer, but nothing life changing.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,TuckerCarlson,4.23,"Pours a mostly clear dark amber with a tone of sticky, foamy head that leaves really nice lacing down the glass.  Lots of grapefruit with a definite whiff of pine back there.  Quite high on the bitterness scale, even as it warms up. Really good citrus flavors with enough malt to balance everything out. I'm not entirely sure what the addition of rye contributes, but it all works very well together.  Nice, thick, and chewy.  I wouldn't call it a refresher for a hot day, but a great one to sit down and sip during a long conversation.

Spicy nose, peppery with a piney/citrussy hop aroma. A bit of malty sweetness and a little bit of earthiness from the rye. Subtle at first but then becomes more complex as it warms.  Taste is Piney bitter with a bit of citrus rind. Peppery with a hint of caraway and even a little plum fruitiness. Some alcohol and a hint of vanilla. very enjoyable.

610,3158,jjayjaye,4.3,"This to Mr. Lew Bryson (award-winning, beer-drinking, whiskey-sipping, brewery-visiting, cask-tapping, thirst-creating drinks writeresteemed critic, connoisseur, Advocate, and Patriot) I am seriously getting your point about standardized styles.  This one pours a clear and very dark amber, almost mahogany color (non-standard-typical), with an absolutely huge stiff three finger run-away head that resists fading. A whole lot of lacing going on; some 3D.  An aggressive smell but not the hop bomb I anticipated. Instead Id say it has a much sweeter malty aroma...similar to a DIPA. Im assuming thats the RYE. Ive only had rye beverages a half-dozen times but Im definitely already big fan. Anyway, you can smell classic rye.  Medium bodied, the mouth feel is incredibly smooth and creamy. Absolutely no tingle from hop or effervescence (and thats not style-typicalbut, IT ROCKS!). The flavor of the hops is there without the typical sensation. A full and balanced rye malt flavor persists.  A wonderful drinker. Produce and Distribute widely as a gateway beverage' for the AB masses longing for a true experience.

610,3158,mikesgroove,4.68,"Hop Rod Rye   So I have made it, here it is, my 400th beer review! Wow, thats alot of beer! I was deciding last week on what to have for this as I knew it was coming up. I wanted something good, but I am saving something real special for my 500th(always looking ahead), My decision was made easy when I fionally landed a bottle of Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye! I had been waiting forever to try this beer. It just seemed like something I had to go for, right up my alley so to speak, and I just knew I would eventually land one. So when it came time, I knew just where to turn, to the fire painted hot rod on the front of the bottle, which would bring me a whole lotta hops! So onto the beer....  A - Poured a very deep hazy burned amber. This thing literally looked like a burgundy, great great hue on this one. One of the biggest, thickest, gooiest, stickiest off white, tannish colored head I have ever seen in a beer. This thing was huge, an easy three plus talls with a ton, an absolute ton of residual side glass lace dripping down the side. It was completely obscured throughout the session. Great carbonation was visible leaching up from the bottom of the glass, almost immediatly and lasted to the bitter end. For appearence, absolutly perfect. I could not have made this look better, and thats the damn truth, Fives all around for the pour on this one.  S - Wow, just a deep citrus sweet hoppy aroma. Not overpowering, just luxiuosly rich smelling. A slight touch of alcohol in the aroma in the beginning. Such a complexity rarely found in the nig IPS's, usually they are just overloaded with hops to the point that its like grapefruit gone made. This was much more blended and refined. Had alot of amlt backing and that was evident even from the smell. Lots of orange peel, and tangerine, mixed with a nice caramel sweetness and a touch of some earthy grain, very nice indeed.  T - Awesome, just such a nice blend between the hops and the malts made this so damn pleasurable. Major flavors from the start were bitter grapefruit and orange, with some candied sugar. Balanced perfectly with a touch of caramel and a really nice grainy sort of ceral back. No weakness or watered down taste here, in fact, this has to be one of the most complex and finaely crafted IPA's I have ever tasted. It just seemed to have such depth and character. A ton of time had to go into getting this flavor right, as it was damn right. I relly could have drank this forever. As it warmed it lost some of the alchol punch and just seemed to get more blended together. Great dry finish and a long, I mean very long bitter lingering aftertaste. I could still taste this one like a full 5 minutes later, wow, damn fine tasting brew, for sure...  M - This was just remarkably smooth and consistent. Very sticky at first on the gums and teeth, but that soon passed. Great carbonation really let the flavors pop. It just danced around on the palate soo smoothly, very awesome feel. Light enough to be drnk consistently, but thick enough to be a sipper if you needed it.  D -Outstanding, one of the finest beers I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. I would stock the fridge, or buy a keg of this in a heartbeat. Just cannot say enough good things about it.  Overall I really do not know what elseI can say. I loved every second of this beer. Really just fantastic, and worthy of my 400th review, or my 1000th!!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ByTor2112,4,"Shared this with a friend. Poured a killer shade of copper going to garnet red. Not much head formed with this, but a small off-white layer of foam was present. Aroma-a sharp hoppy aroma with mostly piney notes. Mouthfeel- Whoa! this is one aggressive brew. The hops are well layered and the malt body is not too sweet.The Rye really gives an excellent edge, almost a bite on the finish. Alcohol is noticeable and with the Rye gives the brew a kick that says: Hey I am dropping high octane and hops all over your palate jack! Almost a solid 4, and I like Rye grain, but being truly quaffable is slightly diminished by the hearty edge of this one.

610,3158,MiScusi,4.7,"from 22oz bottle. I had this on tap back around march and it was great.  This is really an exceptional and interesting beer. Its a very very dark reddish-brown color and smells of fresh floral and piney hops. The taste is fantastic with the malt and rye body backing up the seemingly very fresh hop taste so well. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium, with a relatively slick and smooth body.

Just so much hops, but still a strong level of malts and rye as well.  Taste. Just a whole bunch of flavors going off in my mouth. Has a very nice level of bitterness, but a sweet maltiness (caramel) is quite present as well. I cant tell if the hops are dominant or the rye flavor. Hops are piney with a little citrus in it. The flavor is just so strong! Aftertaste is spicey and bitter.  Mouthfeel. It is a full body with a very creamy texture that fills the mouth nicely.

M: Very well built, immensely smooth for such a beer.  D: A little lower due to the robustness and high alcohol, but very tasty and a very nice beer to drink that revels in its own complexities but does not go over the top; not to mention that it is virtually ubiquitous in my area, and is relatively cheap, hovering around $3.29-$3.49 for a bomber.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

It has a dark hue that almost looks two tone when you pour a full glass. There is a red tint to the brew that is probably because of the rye. There is a thick off white head that stays forever on the beer.  The smell is a great combination of hops and malt. Though the fruity hops really come out in the smell.  The first experience in the flavor is all hops, it is strong upfront and gives way to the malt and has a hit of the dry rye flavor. It has a light bitterness that goes down very smooth.  It has a pleasant mouth feel because it's complex, but not too much all in one flavor. There is no alcohol burn.

610,3158,bort11,3.76,"Thanks to Solomon420 and the New Anniversary Bomber Bif for this one.  22 oz bomber poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Massively massive head. Standing in at about three inches, it was there to stay. I had to set down the glass after pouring to change a baby, let the dogs out, and fill the dishwasher. When I came back I don't think that head moved at all. That is fantastic head! The color itself was a very dark ruby red color. That's an interesting color for an IPA, which I'm guessing is due to the rye. The smell had an expected rye bitterness, blended with an herbal hoppiness. Taste is equally bitter, a bit of citric sweetness mingles. A lot of floral notes. Mouthfeel has a solid medium body with a tad of creaminess extended from the head..

610,3158,MrMcGibblets,4.25,"poured from a bomber into a standard pint glass, this was ruby/brown in color with just a slight haze. the tan head left sticky gobs of lacing all over the glass all the way to the bottom. this has a powerful bouqet of toffee, caramel, citrus, resin, dark candied fruit, and some spicy, roasty notes. taste was big and well-balanced. the interplay of sweet malt and bitter hops was pretty much perfect. the spiciness of the rye along with the lingering hop bitterness lead to a long, cleansing finish which leaves you wanting more. medium to full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and just the right amount of carbonation. drinkability is not quite perfect due to the abv, not because you don't want to keep drinking it, 'cause this is some good fuckin' shit. Note: have had this since many times including 12oz versions...there may be some freshness issues...have not been as impressed overall.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Bierguy5,4.03,"22 oz. bottle, 8% ABV. Cloudy, very dark brownish/copper, with some huby shades. Thick tan head. Great retention and lace. Look dark for an IPA.  This is bursting with citrusy and piney hop aroma. Toasty, caramel like maly is present in the nose as well. Fruity, mainly some tropical fruits.  Rich toffee like malt character. Very robust. Seems to fall into some woody flavors, then a blast of citrusy hops. Finishes with some peppery flavor.  Good body and carbonation. Well balanced. The rye addds a very unique character. Very nice.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,awall422,4.33,"Wow, this was my first Bear Republic offering. Not disappointed! Poured a dark reddish-orange out of the 22oz bottle. great 2 finger, off white head that lasted a few minutes, with pretty good lacing. Good resiny, fruity hop aromas make you eager to taste this beer. For a strong IPA, it was really well-balanced. Sweet, caramelly malts fight to stave off a strong hop bite. Oily textured, but smooth and eas to drink for a beer this strong and this hopped up. Really nice.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Monkeyknife,4.32,"Poured from the bottle a clear dark amber red with a light beige head and light lacing.  Definitely a very hoppy aroma to this beer. Heavy on the pine and it lets you know that the rye is present.  Crisp and bitter from the hops but there's also a nice maltiness to it. The alcohol leaves a warming zing on the tongue at the end.  Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. Dry with the zing mentioned earlier.  What a great IPA this is. Drink one if you can,",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,CreamyStoutMan,4.22,"Sadly, I didn't get a chance to pour this one due to lack of a clean glass. Looking through the tinted bottle, though, I feel that I can still judge its appearance a little. I can see that it is a deep, thick amber and (if I had a clean pint glass) I'm just about positive that it would pour a pretty creamy head.  Smells hoppy in one of the greatest ways that I can remember a beer smelling; reminds me of ""hazed and infused"", ""hop wallop"", and (too a much lesser extent) a number of IPA's. As one would expect from the explanation on the bottle, rye is definitely what is dominant on the nostrils.  Rye and intense, organic hops are definitely what dominate the palate as well with this one. I was thinking, at first, that this one was going to lean more to the direction of being an extremely hoppy specialty ale like hazed an infused, but after a few sips, I am convinced that it is definitely an IPA, and to be completely honest, it is probably my favorite of the style that I have sampled thus fur, which is saying a lot because I have tried many an IPA.  The mouthfeel is creamy and thick and wonderful. I really don't think that I could ask for too much more in this department, in regard to an IPA.  I could definitely knock back a few of these. I drank 1 pint 6 fluid oz. a lot faster than I thought I would and it's only eleven in the morning! Note: I have been eating pizza as well (which is somewhat of a common compliment to IPAs) so its slightly possible that it is throwing off my review, but I doubt it. I will definitely purchase this beer again when I am search of something with an extremely high hop and alcohol content.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,OWSLEY069,4.67,"Pours a nice deep amber and a tan head. The aroma is HOPS. You can tell its comming. It has a fantastic taste. Grapefruity hops balanced out with the sweet malt and dryness of the rye. It leave a stickiness on the lips, but it is well worth it. One of the best beers by far.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,DoubleJ,4.33,"An IPA injected with 18% rye? Wonder how this will do. On to the beer:  Pours rich dark from the bottle, which it settles into a dark amber in color with an awesome, thick head. There's a litle rye, ginger, and hops with a metallic twist to it in the nose. Now to taste it - leans towards the fruity side, not as hop dominant as the other IPA's. The flavor doesn't explode on you, but it's still pleasant. What makes this one unique is it's dry finsih (from the rye I suppose) that allows you to quaff this brew with ease.  I was wondering what the difference between the two Bear Republic IPA's would be, and this I would label the ""different"" one with its rye shot. The other offering I will try soon to compare notes. (Update: Racer 5 is tastier, but Hop Rod Rye is more quaffable.)",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Budlum,4.1,"Pouring this beer produces a tan head at one half inches tall. The body is a rich garnet and brown shade with excellent clarity. The head retention is good but nothing too special.  The nose of this beer presents a sharp rush of hop aromas. The hop smells are very earthy with a salt and pine resin kick. There is only a very muted sweetness in the background.  A flowing presentation of hops glides over the tongue with the first sip. Much like the aromas, the hops are very earthy with pine, grapefruit and many bitter flavors. A sweet maltiness blends with a light peat flavor. The hops regain strength for a long, bitter finish. The most impressive characteristic of this beer is the flavor presentation. There are mountains of hop flavors in the beer but it never overpowers the senses. This was wonderfully crafted.  The mouthfeel has mild carbonation and a balanced, spicy feeling from the hops.  Drinkability is great. The powerhouse of flavors matched with their awesome presentation make this easy to enjoy in large quantities.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,goochpunch,4.68,"Pours out a rusty hazelnut with plenty of carbonation present in the body. Head is thick, creamy, and beige, and holds up extremely well. There are some dimples atop the foam and with each sip there is left some lacing that reminds me of the residue left by the steamed milk on a cappuccino. The aroma is of citrus, vanilla custard, toffee, caramel, cane syrup, and a little hint of rye. Alcohol merely peaks out from this, but is well subdued considering the strength. In the flavor, malts start off sweet, bready and with dried fruits and caramel. The hops start to push into the middle then come into the forefront by the finish. Flavor is mostly citric but there are undertones of pine, earth, and strong herbs such as rosemary. A very understated rye makes itself known amongst the hops, which I think works well, but I would rather the rye to be a little more present. The bitterness does not overstep the sweet malts in the end, rather they create a balance. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, moderate to full, and the carbonation is extremely mellow. It's rare to find a beer of this strength as being this drinkable, but you don't notice it while you drink. Amazing beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,DavidSeanNJ,4.38,"Poured from a 22oz. bomber into a pint glass. The label itself is great- black background with a hot rod car- lots of flourescent eccentric colors.  TONS of head on this one- over an inch at least- very fluffy with a tan hue. Poured a beautiful amber brown- tinted with reds. Looked delicious and picture perfect.  This is a hop bomb- tons of hops in the scent (grapefruit) as well as the taste. The rye gives it a bitter taste and balances out the sweetness (caramel, malty) undertones. This is quite a sticky one- leaves tons of lacing on your glass as well as your lips after consumed.  I absolutely loved this beer- flavors were blended so well together to make a truly unique and enjoyable IPA. If this were more readily available in my area, I would be drinking this all the time.  The West Coast breweries are top notch at the moment and this may be the best offering I have had to date.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,mjgardner,4.33,Aquired from umustdrink. Thanks Nick. Drank with bross242 and dannosparks. One of 31 beers in a exceptional day of drinking.  Appearance - Pours a clear brilliant dark amber with a big tan head that dissapates a bit. Very good lacing.  Smell - The big citrus hops hit right away. There is also a noticeable rye aroma with some citrusy pineapple at the back.  Taste - A bit hop bitterness with quite a bit of rye. This has a nice malt character that helps balance the beer out.  Mouthfeel - Light to medium bodied with very little carbonation. Quite refreshing.  Drinkability - This is a very drinkable IPA. The alcohol is hidden very well. Definitely one of the best IPA's I have tasted in awhile.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,williamherbert,4.1,"Dark rose-red color wiht a big puffy head. A tiny little bit of sediment. Looks like an amber. Head is quite formidable. Excellent lace.  Outstanding bitter hoppy smell. Nice biscuity, subtle malt. Hops smell of pine.  Quite bitter but excellent. Piney hops leave a bitter blast. Halfway between a regular IPA and an Imperial. All bitter. Very bitter aftertaste. It's a strong ale with lots of hops. Sooo bitter.  Kind of thick and creamy. Leaves a bitter coating. So so bitter. Substantial. Might as well be an Imperial. It's like a hoppy strong ale.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Contra,4.2,"Enjoyed this with an excellent Reuben sandwich. Seemed appropriate, and went well together.  Pours with massive mountains of head that has peaks and valleys. Copper red color, slightly translucent at the bottom, thicker in the middle. Extremely hoppy with a desirable bitterness. more on the floral side, as opposed to the pine flavor. Still has a nice mix of both. Very intense, perhaps too much if your not into IPAs, but perfect for those who are.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Lacing is one of the strongest I've seen.  S - Piney and earthy hops with a good peppery malt balance.  T - Starts spicy and bitter malty and goes into a bitter, piney, oily hop. Aftertaste is almost smoky, but equally hoppy and malty. I believe the spicyness to come from the 18% rye malts.  M - Consistency is straight up medium. Carbonation is medium to minimal.  D - Very good IPA with almost no alcohol detectable. Taste is very solid, not outstandingly complex but also not just a hop bomb. Also, this beer has an excellent value. There is nothing not to like.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Brewlore,4.42,"Pours a brownish red color with a nice somewhat thin head.  The smell is wonderful with the hops obviously coming in heavy and strong. Spicy hop notes abound mostly with this brew.  The taste of this American IPA is outstanding, surely one of my favorite IPAs to have come along. Very hoppy with spicy and citrus notes running around. The malt is present albeit in a subtle way, which is good. It lets the hops run rampant!  It's got a medium body and feels good across the palate. Good carbonation and ends with a somewhat dry feel.  Amazingly drinkable brew. It packs a bunch with 8% ABV but it's pretty well hidden. This is surely a beer I'd want to drink throughout the summer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,kirok1999,4,"Pours an almost brown ruby red. Nice thin white head with tons of lacing. Smell is spicy sweet malts, the rye really stands out in the nose. Taste is an amplification of the smell. Sweet malt balanced well with hop bitterness. The malts fill the mouth and the bitter hops bring up the rear. Smooth and creamy with a very nice carbonation level. Slight citrus hops blend well with the caramel malt notes. Really nice beer, easy to drink on a cool spring night. This would go well with many heavily spiced foods as it stands up on its own.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ncvbc,4.7,"Poured a ruby amberish color, quite dark for an IPA but still beautiful. Nice creamy head and excellent lacing and carbonation. Smell is great as well, juicy grapefruit hops and sweetness. This is definitely one of my favorite tasting IPAs hands down. I can't tell that rye has been used but for damn sure know that this is for the hopheads. Citrus, fruity hops and a malty balance that makes this one mouth watering. Not quite thirst quenching but for sure mouth watering on the tongue. Silky smooth and just utterly great. Very drinkable beer here, although I do like the more standard IPAs as well. Bear Republic has to be one of my favorite breweries. Yummy.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ccrida,4.57,"American IPA, eh? I guess that's what the first guy thought...and a good example of why I don't much care for style guidelines. This is a big hoppy red, Northern Cali style - bring it on!  Pours a clear, dark amber, with a thick, amber tinged eggshell head of a good 2 fingers, very long lasting leaving lots of sticky, bubbly lace -nice!  The aroma is very appetizing and right up my ally. Bright, pungent hops, sweet fruit- cherry and grape Yummm.  The taste is more complex and balanced, but still true to the aroma. Just amped up spiciness, malt, resin and pine, brown sugar, but still sweet and fruity without being to much. This reminds me a lot of Lagunitas Lucky 13 but a bit less zing (or better balanced?)...two great beers from the Sonoma valley.  The mouthfeel is a bit oily, but on the lighter side for such a flavorful beer.  This is very drinkable. The warmer it gets, the better, but who has the patience to let it sit around.

Found my glass to display a lighter color at the bottom and the beer appears to be much darker toward the top. Poured with a very large head of caramel color.  Smell - Smells very nice balance of the hops and rye, with the rye shining through a little more.  Taste - I can taste the rye more than I can smell. Not very hoppy, but that is probably the intention with the addition of the rye. I should compare to their Racer X IPA  Mouth - Not as carbonated as I would have thought, but the taste more than makes up for the lack of carbonation.

Hop bomb upfront; grapefruit and pine needles. Other flavors include: tobacco, plum, molasses, and roasted malt (not really IPAesque). Finishes pretty bitter and lasts.  Chalky mouthfeel with some carbonation bite.  I don't really consider this beer to be an IPA of any kind. There are a lot of flavors going on here that would be better suited if it were placed in the American Strong Ale style.

The appearance was a dark amber with a slight ruby shine, also held a beige two finger head. Left an excellent amount of sticky and salty lacing (lip smacking). Darkest AIPA I've seen to date. The smell was phemon. A blast of grapefruit citrus upfront with a some piney in the middle. Also experienced a hint of caramel, nutty malt and toffee. The taste began slightly sweet plum that was well balanced with the hoppy blast toward the end. Somewhere in the middle this southern biscuit shine through. This brew felt middle to full, bold, slightly oily and crisp with a dry ending. The only down fall was, with a long drive ahead of us, we could only have one drink.

Aromas of citrusy/piney hops dominate. Taste is unevenly balanced on the side of hops, but still with a goodmalt presence. Rye lends a spicy afternote. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, medium bodied, with a slickness from the rye. Overall, a fine IIPA.

Faded to a cap pretty quick. Sheet like sparkling lace. Real sticky. Looks tasty.  Pine and citrus with up front with huge malt smells in the background. Impressive. Slightly floral. A bit boozy. Some chocolate. Seems like it could/should open up a little with some warming, but I'm still not getting a whole lot.  Mostly sweet. Some caramel. No real distinct flavor jumps out here. Surprising. Some dark berries, mildly vinous character. Gets a strong grapefruit bitterness on the aftertaste that grows as you work your way down the glass. Some citric and wheatlike flavors work there way in eventually.  Fairly light on the body. Pretty smooth. Not much there in the way of mouthfeel. It just comes and goes. Reasonable balance. Definitely bitter and slightly acidic on the finish. That 8% is pretty well hidden.  One of the strangest IPAs I've ever had. It's just ending slick and bitter.

There was an exceptionally fluffy white head. There is a lot of rye and hops in the aroma. It has a good malt profile as a backbone though. The flavor is very complex. Initially there is a good sweet maltiness followed by a equal amount of hop bitterness over the sweetness. It finishes very balanced, maybe even a bit on the sweet side. This is a good IPA, although there is something about it I'm not crazy about. It might be a bit sweet for me. It is good though.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,prototypic,4.47,"Appearance: Pours a dark copper to brown color. Head is very foamy and about one and a half fingers deep. Very good retention and heavy coat of lace lined the glass.  Smell: It's a mix of grains, hops, and citrus fruits. As far as citrus goes, it's a sweet blend of grapefruit and mango scents. Hops are nice and piney. The light grainy smell must be due to the rye. Certainly smells a bit malty as well.  Taste: I'm supremely impressed. It's got a slight sweet taste. Hops are nice and bitter. Definitely a bit dry. The rye aspect of it is very interesting. It gives it an earthy, grainy twist that develops into a toffee malt taste. It's extremely well balanced.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Extremely smooth. Carbonation and abv are ideal. Very, very drinkable. Overall, this really is a fantastic beer. It's my first experience with Bear Republic and I walk away looking forward to the next.

Into a pint glass, pours like cream a beautiful copper amber, falling gently as an full two inch head of frothy foam head caps it off, off-white, with heaps of lacing all over the place. Lovely. The aroma is fresh and sweet and fruity, floral hops of goodness. I'm having a very hard time finding anything wrong, or, anything not right, with this beer.  And then, taste. Utterly fantastic. And the wonderful thing is it changes slightly as it warms, giving it even more dynamics. The hops are definitely the star of the show, dominant but not overbearing, a biscutty, caramel malt doing it job balancing thing out and the mouth only magnifies the beauty, its velvety smoothness, well tempered carbonation, and coating, full body making this a fantastic beer to drink. In other words, I continue to be impressed with the beers Bear Republic puts out, and would dare to say they are massively underrated, or at least much under-hyped.

610,3158,Kendo,4.35,"A: Poured into a Duvel tulip. . . . A moderately aggressive pour yields a 2-finger creamy tan head over a brown body that shows orangey/ruby hues when held to the light. The head settles slowly and leaves clumpy rings of lacing on the way down, with a pillow sitting on top in the middle of the glass.  S: Surprisingly sweet at first -- brown sugary, almost -- as I was expecting a hop explosion. Citrusy hops are there, however, just not as strong as I expected.  T: Very nice. A bit of rye spice up front, becoming even more evident as it warms. Caramel-like malty sweetness and then citrusy -- grapefruit, I think -- and fruity bitterness rounds it out. It finishes fairly dry and bitter, however, for a nice all-around balance. No notice of the 8% ABV at all.  M: Very good -- nicely carbonated but also smooth and fairly creamy. Medium-bodied.  D: Very good.  Notes: Not sure if this is best described as an IPA or a DIPA as some have suggested. Whatever you call it, I like it.

More pine than grapefruit here, and suggestive of the bitterness to follow. A bit spicy and some alcohol is noted as well.  Hard not to be disappointed by the taste by comparison to the rest of the beer. There is underlying sweetness showing the relative balance of this beer before the palate is whacked with a big hop hit. More bittering than expected, and less citrus. This probably deserves a 3.25 at least.  Feels great in the mouth - full smooth creaminess and appropriate carbonation. Drinkability is quite high for the ABV. I liked most everything about this beer, and even in the taste I generally liked all the parts...I just didn't particularly care for how they came together.

About an inch of tight, bubbly off-white head formed. Head dissapeared somewhat quickly into small gobs of lace in the glass.

Hops that are not overwhelming, on a smooth malty backbone. Also hints of citrus, pine, bready yeast, and a nice touch of rye. Somewhat dry but almost perfectly balanced. A very enjoyable drink.

Deep but clear amber red - lets you know from the start that this isn't your typical IPA. Smells heavy but balanced - loads of malt, American hops, but neither one really winning over the other - leads with sweetness, but ends with a slight dry bitterness.  Taste is integration and magnificence defined - my first 5 on BA. Rich malt, but no syrupiness. It's no total hop bomb, but all kinds of American hops citrus and pine integrating beautifully with a medium-aggressive yeast and that rich but ultimately dry malt. My only knok on this beer is a slightly over-thick texture - either it has crept in over the past year (I've noticed it several times on tap, also in this particular bottle), or I've become more sensitive.

610,3158,spdrz,4.23,"I had walked by this ale repeatedly, passing it over every time. When I saw the rating it received on this site recently, I had to give it a go.  Appearance: Pours cloudy with browns dominating the color profile. Nice head, almost a light tan. Medium-strong lacing after the head recedes. Clearly unfiltered and a unique hue for this style.  Smell: Can you smell the rye? I can in a subtle spiciness that peeks its head through the the citric-floral hop aroma. Malt is present with a grist-y sweetness that piggy-backs the spicy rye.  Taste: This is a VERY balanced IPA. I am pleasantly surprised. No overwhelming, cloying, astringent, resinous hop-attack. It is there, but well in equilibrium with the rest of the ale. Some floral-ity that could be hops or rye, and a little peach-pine zip. Again the rye is noticeable with a woody, lemon zest spiciness. 8% abv. is well masked, with just a tinge of alcohol induced sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Really gentle on the palate. Medium-heavy mouthfeel. 18% rye probably plays a major role in the feel. One of the better characteristics that this ale has going for it. Truly adds to the overall enjoyment.  Drinkability: HIgh marks for the big D-(rinkability). Because of its balance this Rye-PA outshines many of the super-behemoths of this style. It is smoooove.  Overall: Marks down for a non-traditional hue and a subdued hop aroma in the nose. Marks up for balance, mouthfeel, flavor, and drinkability. Great ale.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,ruinationation,4.38,Pours a dark maroon almost brown color. With a rocky cream colored head.  Good smelling ale with enough hops and citrus. The rye adds some good aroma but not overwhelming.  This beer has more malt than I expected but enough hops and citrus to balance it out. The rye brings out a good bread after taste.  Great feel to this beer. Maybe thicker because of the rye. Liked this beer alot and plan to have it in my rotation.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,malcontent,4.13,"Chunks, chunks I say! Major flakes of floating yeast still aren't enough to detract from the beautiful mahogany body topped by an incredibly pillowy head. Awesome looking.  Rye 'n' hops, rye 'n' hops, rye 'n' hops. Okay, some spicy citrus and sa surprising level of booziness as well but otherwise this one is straightfoward in this department (to its advantage).  Obvious strong rye presence although (I never though I would say this) the rye becomes a bit much in congress with the hops. Don't get me wrong, it's still exceptionally tasty, especially the bready/whisky quality from the rye, but the bitterness is over-aggresive on the finish.  Creamy, satisfying texture makes for a complex, pleasant experience throughout. Still, for a rye beer I still think I'd give the nod to 2 Bros. Cane and Ebel over this (by a hair).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

This is going to be good! T: An incredibly complex medley of bitter hops along with some other unusual IPA flavors that must come from the rye malts. M: This beer plays around on the tongue.

The smell is a strong citrusy hops with a little sweet malt. The taset is balanced between hops & malt with a bitter bite at the swallow. A slightly sweet taste occurs for the first 2-3 seconds then succombs to carbonation before the bit of bitterness. Mouthfeel is pleasant, medium and wet along with the carbonation.

Nice hops fruity citrus orange, peach mixed with pine notes. Big chewy smelling but also lots of hops mixed with a rye note.  Taste is big malty caramel with nice rye notes adding to the feel and flavor that is common in good rye brews hard to note but easy to taste. Nice hops also in the flavor good citrus fruits with pine needles scattered about. This is one big rich full brew, not really an IPA even with the good amount of hops.  Mouthfeel is big for an IPA, the rye makes a good noticeable difference adding to the feel. Sporting a good medium level of carbonation.  Drinkability is very good , very enjoyable more then an IPA, wishing I had a frig full of these. Thanks go to Enola for this fine sample.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Gatch,4.38,"A - Hop Rod is a nice change to the typical IPA color. This is an amber/maple syrup brown color. The head is off-white & thick. S - Malt, maple syrup, light honey. A slight piney hop to the nose as well. T - A lot of malt for an IPA. The hops make an appearance but serve as great company to the malt, making it have a nice balanced and flavorful finish. The hops don't really show until after each sip. There is also some roasted malt, nuts, sweet fruits, and some light oak. M - The malt & hop combo creates a smooth & balanced mouthfeel. The roasted malt stays on the tongue and palate throughout the bomber. D - I've had so many IPA's in the past few weeks, I was almost hesitant to drink this. This is exactly the opposite of what I expected because it seems different from an IPA. It seems like a really good amber with more of a hop presence. The malt is the best part, which makes the drinkability high and enjoyable. The hops come out in the finish to show you it really is an IPA. I love this stuff.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,guitarmage,4.59,"Appearance: Poured very dark for an IPA. Hazy brown with some copper hues, looks like a Belgian dubbel in color. Head struggled to form but there's an off white lacing floating on the beer.  Smell: Nice malt sweetness, not a dark sugary sweetness, light and fruity, suggestions of apple juice, hops are floral and smooth, great smelling IPA.  Taste: Sweetness tastes of apricot, ripe fruit, hops come in but don't take over the beer, there's a nice balance of sweet and bitter, then the beer dries up with faint alcohol, and bready finish.  Mouthfeel: Nice medium to full body, carbonation is consistent and prickly on the palate, a dry finish but a little oily.  Drinkability: A lot of sweetness for an IPA, but a lot of hops to balance it out. This beer is rather complex for the style, and very well done.

A - Pours a cloudy brown with a medium off-white head that leaves some sticky lacing behind.  S - Grassy/piney hops with some sweet malt in the background...bready notes also detected.  T - Very unique IPA. A solid, hoppy backbone...but resting atop the hops is a biscuity/bready flavor. I loved the creamy-bread finish. Not quite as good as the Racer 5, but pretty damn close. I might need to do a side-by-side tasting to determine the winner.  M - As this warmed, it got extremely creamy - solid carbonation throughout the life of this beer. Bready aftertaste with hints of bitterness.  D - Excellent IPA - definitely one of the most unique.

Citrus and tropical fruit aroma.  Hops also dominate the taste. The more subtle malt is upfront with dark fruit and roasted character. Alcohol is faint in the finish with the hops giving you a nice smack on the palate.  I enjoyed this one, it was a lot more hoppy than I expected. The rye malt taste is subtle.

A: The beer is a light reddish brown color with a thin but foamy off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is hoppy and very fruity with a little bit of carmelized malt. The citrus sweetness and floral hops are very complimentary.  T: The taste is very well-balanced with a good, strong hops burst, some citrus sweetness, some dry rye breadiness and a good hearty malt character. The after-taste is heavy with hops bitterness.  M: Smooth and very crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean and dry.  D: Tasty, goes down easy with no hint of the ABV, despite the description on the label (alcohol burnin monster ale), very good representation of style. I took out the bomber rather quickly.

610,3158,westweasel,4,"Poured from a 22oz. bottle.  The beer is a very dark chocolate amber. It poured with a huge head that dissipated to about 1/4 inch. The aroma had the smell of brown bread with lemon and a sweet-scented flower.  The taste had a strong hop bitterness and a sweet brown bread flavor. It also had a dry bite that I seem to always taste in rye-type beers. The mouthfeel was between medium and full, with a bitter and somewhat dry finish.

A full two inch head rises up and lingers long before slowly settling down to a oily, sticky, bumpy cap with tight webs of lace rising up the insides of the glass.  Aroma of bready malt and fresh citrus hops.  Rich flavor of citrus and pine hops. The citrus moves from subtle sweet tangerine to orange rind to grapefruit rind to piney hops. The bitterness increases in the finish and lingers. A dark and luscious malt backbone rides beneath, but I'm picking up inconsistent and faint rye notes. A peppery spice accentuates the finish.  Full and creamy mouthfeel punctuated with carbonation tingles and slight alcohol warmth. Finishes a bit dry.  Very rich, but very drinkable.

A - Dark, stained-wood body with a thick, rocky, beige head that tries, tries so very hard to stay at a 2-fingered height, but slowly decends, clinging to the glass.  S - Big, citrusy hops (clean, clear, and...wait... grapefruit and pine?) mix and mingle with spicy rye and sweet malts.  T - First, the smooth, robust malts sweep the mouth, fading into a rye-breadiness that tastes fresh-baked and steaming. From there its big bitterness from the hops (think licking the rind of a ruby-red) and finishes with a nice twinge of rye-spice and alcohol bite. moderate warming in the throat and chest after the swallow.  M - Amazingly crisp for the complexity of this big brew - mid-level carbonation, creamy foam, light astringency from the hops... man this is what i look for in an IPA.

610,3158,RidiculedDisplay,4.25,"This is probably the sixth or seventh time for me with this beer, including once on-tap. However, I've never reviewed it until now so I thought I might as well.  Poured into an imperial pint glass.  Appearance: Incredible meringue-like two to three-finger head. Lacing is huge, cavernous in formation. Body is a dark grain amber. Very pretty looking. Head dissipates to a half-finger after a minute or so, but remains for a fairly impressive stretch prior to that.  Smell: Citrus and pine hops. Interestingly, the citrus in Hop Rod comes across more lemon-like than any other fruit, which is unusual in any IPA. Almost like a smoothed-over Pine Sol aroma, which one could say is detectable in many IPA's but here is more prevalent. This isn't a bad thing to me, I enjoy Pine Sol's scent. : ) Rye and hop bitterness on the back end. A slight bit of caramel. Like other rye beers, the hops and rye aromas seem to coalesce, oddly, into a sort of fruit punch flavor.  Taste: Mmm citrusey, pine-y hops. A little more orange-like in the flavor than the nose, but there's still that lemon lightness. Rye spiciness on the back end, but not quite to the extent of something like Founder's Red's Rye. The aroma trumps the flavor for me in the complexity department, but it's still very enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy, slightly astringent, fairly adequate carbonation. Nothing wow-inducing, but nice. The spiciness one might expect from a rye-based beer is not really that prevalent, but it does provide a bit of a sting at the roof of the mouth.  Drinkability: Extremely enjoyable, and one of the finest IPA's or rye-based beers in existence. An archetype for the style.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

The aroma was striking -- among the best I've ever sampled. My nose was a bit stuffy with the cold weather, but no more after a whiff of this. Fresh hops came through loud and clear, along with enough sweet malt to round out the experience.  The flavor can give even the most jaded taste buds a workout, starting out with a full-spectrum hops flavor, followed by a mellow maple-malt finish.  Mouthfeel was very good. A nice texture to go along with full flavor.  It's tough for such a bold brew to be drinkable, but the brewers did a creditable job.

The taste starts was bitter, hot with alcohol, lingering, oily hops, grapefruit, some candy notes, even a little melon. Good mouthfeel, a bit creamy but also crisp.

T: First sip reveals clean citric and pine hops with a nice bitter bite that lingers into a perfect caramel malt balance. The finish is all about earth and rye.  M: Clean and refreshing. Medium carbination. Slightly dry finish.  D: Not your ordinary IPA. Still refreshing and clean like most IPA's but the rye malts add a completely different element.

Taste - Lots of bitterness from the hops and toasted malts, a distant taste of caramel. The rye can definitely be felt, lending a unique spiciness that really adds to the hops. The beer has a thick, malty feel.  This is a superb beer, well balanced between the hops, and malt. The balance of rye to barley malt is also fantastic, with nothing taking over the show.

Intensely pungent hops in the aroma with comparatively mellow malt sweetness. Rich, clean hop spice and delicious hop flavor in the bitter palate, though its nicely balanced by a solid grain base and firm bready malt sweetness. There is a touch of peppery rye spiciness in there but its mostly eclipsed by the assertive hop character.  You know, Ive been drinking craft beer for a over three years now, and have been a beer advocate for almost that long, and yet I still end up passing over these beers time and time again. Even though Ive known about them for a long time and even though everyone raves about them, I still take my sweet time in getting around to trying them, at which point I truly regret not trying much, much sooner.

Beautiful deep brown colors with ruby highlights. Excellent clarity.  Juicy malts and sweet caramel mingle with citrusy hops. My wife smells chocolate. And she is never wrong about that! I get hints of cocao as well. The rye ads an earthy element to the malt profile. Some alcohol notes, but minimal for the level in this beer.  Tastes just as it smells. Judicious malt and hops interplay and dance around the mouth. Sweet caramel, but well balanced with hops so as to not be cloying. Finishes sweet with bitter tingling on the tongue.  Carbonated just right. Not too harsh on the tongue. Firm and substantial gravity.  A big beer that didn't let me down. I get consistent, excellent quality from every bottle from this brewery.

The aroma is sweet caramel, piney floral hops and some melon and alcohol.  The flavor is rye, sweet caramel and melon with a sharp lingering bitter grassy hop finish. The alcohol is well-hidden, but it sneaks up on you. The mouthfeel is medium and kind of watery.  Overall, a nice IPA. It's definitely a hop monster, and the rye adds a nice touch.

A very nice blend of hops aromas. A super lemony citric strength up front develops a scant but nice pine aroma in the very end of a whiff. A very light note of the rye was hard to detect but present.  Fantastic taste. A strong taste of grapefruit and tangelo. There is a definite rye taste that is very balanced to hops. Pine taste is also lightly present in the finish at the back of the mouth.  Thickness is above average, but tthe burst of carbonation helps this one coat the surfaces and move through a range of tastes.  A super high quality beer.

I can't really describe how great the hops taste...but it is very much like the way hops taste in fresh wort that hasn't been fermented...incredibly fresh, pungent ....a LOT of flavor along with the mouth puckering bitter.

The brew itself is in the middle ground where brown meets red meets gold meets mahogany. Just a beautiful looking beer. The aroma is spicy and piney/floral with a bit of malty sweetness and rye poking through. The initial flavour is of malt and rye, if only for about .05 seconds, before the hop onslaught displays the back of its hand and gives me a proper pimp-slap. That lasts for a good long while until the malt backbone of this beer regains its footing and melds with the hops for a nice complex finish. Green piney hops with floral notes, toffeeish and rye malt, bread-yeast, bitter orange rind, almond-hazelnut, and a smidge of bittersweet chocolate.

Aroma of piney hops reaches out and grabs the olfactory senses, leaving room for little else to be considered. Palate is more balanced - lots of piney hops up front, tempered by a blend of sweet caramel malt and rye after it sits on the tongue for a second. Finish is both sweet and dry - a product of the rye, I suppose. Body is rather creamy, a nice and rare character for an IPA. Very drinkable, and not much betrays the fact that this clocks in at 8%.

Smell: Hops are in control, grassy, floral, fresh and zesty. Fruity notes are second-in-command, with ripe cherries, prunes, raisins, and essences of port and nutty sherry. Toasty rye and a dark rummy sugar cane sweetness are also detectable. Very complex, difficult to tease out and describe all its nuances.  Taste: The rye is definitely noticeable, adding a somewhat earthy, almond-like nutty edge. Chocolate and carob flavors also appear, countered by a strong, sharp hop presence, spicy, dry, and estery. Sweet, fruity, boozy fortified wine notes emerge as it warms. I just realized that I wrote the words ""very nice"" in my tasting notes three times, so that should give you an idea of how good this is.

I tried this at the Oregon Beer Fest this summer, wrote a review in the forum, but forgot to post it on the beer. Great rye fragrance. Since trying this beer I have found myself buying more rye bread for sandwiches as I have discovered I really enjoy it. Nice head with what appears to be some quality lacing (the plastic tasting cups aren't the preferred test for this). Wonderful flavor, it was a welcome change from the DIPAs I was hitting hard that day.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,scruffwhor,3.91,"Appearance- Would have been perfect if there was more bubbling. The brown sugar and rubgy hue are a nice, dark contrast to you typical IPA colors. I've always been parshel to the darker side of things. The lacing and head add to the whole look of this beer.  Smell- Grapefruit and a little sweet. Not bread in oven sweet, or biscuit sweet. More like maybe cinnamon buns without the cinnamon with a brown sugar syrup.  Taste- The darker side of the IPA seems to shine through on this release. The rye,malt, and hops combine to make a complex mix of flavors with each other. The dance nicely The Grapfruit is definetly muted to make way for some of the rye and malt.  Mouthfeel- The palate is definetly bitter. A little thicka dn heavy on the tongue for an IPA, but thats just fine by me.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,gmcfarre,3.93,"22oz bomber poured into Imperial Pint Glass Poured @ 45 degrees  A - Dark copper brown with a massive 2 1/2 inch head that remains rocky and bulbous. Lacing is minimal.  S - Very dry and roasted malt scent that complements yet overpowers the floral hop essence of this brew. A breaded sweetness comes through as well.  T - Smooth blend of a dry roasted & bready malt with a nice hop balance. I was expecting more of a hop presence in this brew, but it seems the rye malt has taken over for the most part. A slight caramel taste is evident, along with the requisite hop bitterness.  M -Slight carbo tingle with a rapidly filling mouthfeel. Dry and cloying with a slightly bitter aftertaste.  D - A very different take on the IPA that deserves to be experienced at least once. The rye creates an intriguing flavor, but not one that I would desire everyday. 8%ABV takes its toll after an entire bomber.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,rayjay,3.85,"On tap at Vino's Wine and Cheese in Roseville, CA. I was very excited about trying this on tap.  This keg had been online a bit too long, and the beer was mellowing out and loosing it's attidude, while gaining thinckness and maltiness. Still, it had plenty of it's old personality. Piney hops and lots of carmel and toffee in the body. Rye bread character is more evident from the bottle. Chewy thickness with lots of hop resins.  One note: I didn't feel that this beer was a good match for cheese. It worked, but there are much better pairings.  Rye beers with lots of hops are becoming more common, and it's a match made in heaven. This is a great IPA, and it's also a clever twist on the style.

610,3158,Callenak,4.72,"One of my favs that I've waited a while to review  Bear Republic is one of my favorite breweries. To me they make beers with great drinkability. I almost always have a Racer 5 in my fridge. That and Hop Rod are just staples in the beer diet.  Pours a rich, dark amber with a great, cream head that dissipates quickly to leave a nice lacing on the beer and glass.  Smell is spicy and hoppy. Rye beers seem to go great with hops and this is no exception. A bouquet of citrus and pine. A great malt presence to back it all up.  Tastemmmm. This beer has it all. Loads of hoppy greatness, spiciness from the rye, malt backbone and alcohol to balance it all out. This is the beer that started me down the path of rye. Now I've had a collection of rye beers, homebrewed many rye beers, and even have a bottle of rye whiskey laying around. It will change how you look at beers. Bravo to Bear Republic. I love living in California.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Assertive hops and pine in the nose, with a very slight hint of malt and caramel.  Plenty of hops, a lengthy grapefruit peel taste in the finish. Nicely balanced with malt and rye bread.  Very creamy and mouthfilling. Luxurious, with a nice bitter finish to keep you standing straight.  Enormous hoppiness, very intense. Yet so well-balanced that it's a great pleasure to drink.

Four finger tan rocky head that had great staying power and great lace  Smell fresh clean hops cirtus (grpaefruit rind) and green , there was a nice rye bread smell as well as some great malt structure, almost like toast.  Tasted of green and citrus hops, well balcned with rye amd malt. This is one really good beer. As the beer warmed up the complexity really came out, there was a spicy quality, multiple grains like rye and barely were there, it almost was reminiscent of a 12 grain bread but toasted.  Had a creamy medium body with a little stickyness from residual sugars  Really drinkable, a wish I had more than this one bomber",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,nortmand,4.8,"Pours solid caramel amber, with a fluffy white head that leaves sufficient lace.  Citrusy grapefruit hop aromas dominate. Some spicy rye notes as well. Sweet, supportive caramel notes in there.  Passion fruit and cotton candy flavors up front. Soon there are solid, semi metallic spicy rye flavors. Leaves a bitter pineapple aftertaste.  Full bodied, a tad overcarbonated, but not bad. Relatively complex, a very flavorful and refreshing brew. Extremely drinkable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,tjthresh,3.7,"Pours a deep ruby red with a firm creamy whipped tan head. Slight haze with some bubble raising in the middle. Lots of pungant citrusy hops win out over some sweet caramel and spicy rye aroma. Again, the hops are the major player, but the rye character is worthy of your attention. Both together create a wonderfully blend of citrus and spice that would please the most disearning hop head. Body may be a bit thin, but that my make this sort of a refreshing beer. After drinking the whole bottle, I can feel the hop resin in my mustache. That has to count for something.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,largadeer,4,"Appearance: Murky reddish-amber - surprisingly dark for an IPA. The first pour provides 2 inches of frothy foam that lasts a respectably long amount of time.  Smell: Intensely hoppy; notes of pine and bready malts with a touch of citrus.  Taste: Extremely bitter and hoppy from the get-go; a subtle beer this is not. If you want balance, grab a Racer 5. The hops have a strong pine-like quality to them, typical of many of Northern California's best IPAs, but it's harnessed in an unusual way here. The rye provides a hint of spicy, gingerbread-like sweetness, creating a rounded flavor that a lot of bigger IPAs lack. The finish is oily and resiny, leaving a coating bitterness on the palate.  Mouth: Full-bodied and oily; this drinks almost like a stout.  Drinkability: Delicious but extremely potent. Not exactly a quaffable beer, but highly drinkable nonetheless.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Foxman,4.47,"It pours a hazy and rather carbonated deep amber, marginally orange. A full finger of light tan head recedes to a fuzzy film. Animal crackers of lacing cookie the inside of the glass.  The aroma initially grants caramel malt sweetness and crusty rye bread, sans seeds, of course. Biscuit and yeast duel a swirl of pine and citrus hops. A port presence gets along quite well with a mild but homey draft of alcohol.  Upon tasting, the palate is graced with well-toasted malt sweetness, almost syrupy, along with a tart rye earthiness. Caramel, biscuit, berry, and tangy yeast assert proportionately. Decidedly crisp grapefruit and orange hops mate with warming alcohol to dry out the middle ground. More coating grain sweetness appears toward the close and exists paradoxically with a simultaneous lingering dry and and lightly floral finish. The sassy twists and turns make for a mouthful of tasty pleasure.  Medium bodied, the grain and hops combine to coat and tingle the palate tangibly, almost creamily, and in a very fun way.  The flavor is a surprisingly melodic melding of diverse sensory elements. And the wonderfully lingering aftertaste is damned near ambrosial, leaving a vestigial grin in its wake. Sure, the ABV is a hoot, but it simply joins in the fun rather than do anything to dampen it. Caution be damned, this is one mighty drinkable creation.

610,3158,SwillBilly,4.33,"Poured from 22 oz bottle:  Appearance: Pours a deep, rich, clear, copper topped by an impressively thick and foamy head that last forever. Thick sheet of sticky lacing line the glass. After the head fades a sheet of foamy lacing tops the ale.  Smell: Citrusy and fruity sweet with hints of caramel and brown sugar.  Taste: Starts with a nice citrusy hop bite, almost lemony then transitions to a middle that brings out the malty goodness with an underlying sweetness of dark fruits with just a hint of caramel to balance out the hops. The finish is long and well balanced with those big citrusy hops and the malty sweetness linger long after the swallow. A tell tale rye flavor is mixed in a well hence the name Hop Rod Rye.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy with a dry finish.  Drinkability/Notes: What a really nice beer. Very well balanced with big citrusy hops and a fruity, malty sweetness that isn't too obtrusive. A lingering taste of rye in the aftertaste is definitely present. Extremely drinkable for 8% abv. The alcohol is hidden very well with just a slight warmness on the face. One of my favorite IPA's that borders on a DIPA and one that I never pass up. The appearance is one of the best I've seen. Highly recommended.

Some maltiness and alcohol carried up to the nose as the beer warmed up.  The flavor of the beer was of bright earthy hops and grapefruit. The maltiness of the beer was nice and rich, with a peppery spice from the rye. Definitely a nice twist on an American-style IPA.  The carbonation was just right and the mouthfeel was medium.

The label describes the contents as a ""high performance, turbo-charged, alcohol burnin' monster ale with dual overhead hop injection made with 18% rye"". Yum.  A: Color is dark red-auburn, a warmer version of the color of the bottle. Bubbly & creamy ivory head which retains well.  S: Juicy citrus hops and brown-sugar/caramel maltiness burst from the glass. BIG and mouthwatering. Candy with a dry grainy smell from the rye.  T: Copious amounts of hop flavor, tangy oranges with a dry spiciness. Notable flavor from rye grain is a little toasty and grassy. Some mild alcohol burn in the long bitter finish. Very well balanced overall.  M: Impressive fullness in the mouth. Creamy with a bit of sticky-sweet maltiness up front and a bittered grainy finish. I could still taste this one almost an hour after finishing it.  D: A very tasty IPA, different from the rest with its high grain bill. Bold flavors, a big ABV, and 22 oz. serving sizes make it the type of beer I'd only have one of in a night. Most flavors will pale in comparison to this. A recommended beer for certain...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Smells and aromas are deep and wonderful. Think candied fruits, a touch of piney hops, and a slight note of the alcohol within.  Taste is excellent. What a well done and well thought out beer. Flavors burst and linger all over your mouth creating a great mouthfeel.  Creamy malty sweetness up front. Then the flavors finish with piney resiny hops. The balance is right there too.

Lots of fresh hop flavor. Sweet, toasty malt. Hop bitterness, especially after a second or two, but not overpowering. Well balanced, there's a nice transition from sweetness to a long finish - dry, less malty and more hop driven.  Creamy and somewhat heavy mouthfeel, not cloying, excellent.

610,3158,joe1510,4.28,"22oz. Bomber  Opened with a good healthy pop. I've had two of Bear Republic's beers in the past and both of them had giant, sticky, rocky heads. Hop Rod is no different. The head is off-white and leaves big chunky lacing all the way down the glass. The body was a lightly hazed dark amber. Lively carbonation comes up from all over the bottom of my pint glass. This stuff looks pretty damn tasty.  The smell makes my mouth water in anticipation for a drink. It starts off sweet like caramel which stays around in the background the whole time. The hops take over pretty quick though and they are pure citrus. A couple layers of the citrus. There is grapefruit and orange.Orange being the latter of the two. Hitting at the end is the rye.  This beer will make you pucker up and get your tongue tingling. It's similiar to the smell in that there is a solid malt backbone that tries to balance but doesn't get it done, which is just the way I like it. The rye comes through mid-palate along with a strong bitterness that fades to something more managable but lingers. The hops come through right after the rye makes its appearence and finish the drink off with nice splash of citrus.  The mouthfeel is really the way I like it. Medium bodied with above average carbonation that tickles your tongue. The hops get your tongue tingling like it's about to go numb and makes you need that next drink.  The drinkability is high for the simple fact that each drink almost makes you need another. Of course the taste doesn't hurt either. Very good.  This is one of the top IPAs in my opinion. The ability to hide the alcohol like they did makes this one dangerous. The rye just puts it above so many other IPAs. This is an excellent beer that I'll be visiting often from now on.  Slainte!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,dblinkhorn,4.45,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Stone IPA specialty glass.  Appearance - Pours with a light-tan two finger very frothy head that very slowly dissipates to cap of thick and creamy foam. It leaves excellent and full lacing on the way down. The beer is a beautiful amber/ruby color that is very clear.  Smell - I can smell those juicy, herbal amarillo hops right up front. The rye hits you almost instantly afterward, it has a peanut butter kind of character to it. It's faint, but definitely there. Also some more crisp and slightly citrus and floral hops are mixed with the amarillo. A mellow malt background aroma is also present with very little alcohol scent overall.  Taste - That rye, peanut butter style flavor is paired evenly with the herbal and ""juicy"" style of the armarillo hops. Also in there is some bitter hops of a different variety. Some doughy and rich malt with strong rye flavors come in for the finish. The aftertaste is mainly rye and earth tones. Again, little alcohol is detectable.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with excellent smoothness. It isn't full-bodied but the beer has a very heavy feel to it, I imagine from the rye. The carbonation is perfect after the beer has sat in the glass for about five minutes. It has just a tad too much bite right at pour/open. Superb mouthfeel, a treat for your mouth!  Drinkability - Lots of hops flavor and some earthy rye also. Heavy body. Probably couldn't have another 22oz'er of this, even though it is very good.  An excellent IPA and a great seasonal offering. I'm really starting to like Bear Republic brewing. This beer has a great mouthfeel and very nice mixture of hops and malt/rye. Also, my first beer with a significant addition of rye as an ingredient.

Hops seem to get bigger and bigger while drinking this beer. Like a compound effect in a way. Much rye to speak of as well, godamn delicious. This tastes more like a DIPA than just an IPA. Just guessing but seems to have a boatload of Cascade and Amarillo hops. It is a huge beer, to say the least.

This was one of those beers. Oh man, its a good one. Its dark red and smells just like raw hops right after you open the sealed bag. It's flavorful...bitter and hoppy with a nice creamy, bready taste underneath. The bitterness on this beer isn't super strong at first but it grows and then holds steady throughout the drinking period. I do like it very much indeed.

Not as hoppy as I would have expected... but the slight bite they do dish out last quite a while on the tongue. It's not a hop barrage, more of an ambush; a Trojan horse made of rye! Very well balanced with sweet rich rye and barley up front, followed by hops. Finishes quite dry. Refreshing and smooth. A unique IPA!

Fresh piney hops, pushed up against a nice malt backing, with a large share of delicious rye bread. Now on to the taste. My initial thought is, ""Damn, this may be the perfect beer."" Upfront has a very quick bready malt snap. Mixed in with a good deal of rye. The malt/rye lays on the palate for just a second, and soon gives way to a strong piney bitterness. The pineyness lingers until the very finish, where it is meet with another wave of malt and rye. This is in my mind, a perfect IPA. The flavors work perfectly together in intervenious harmony. This beer is truly a masterpiece. The mouthfeel is just right, and the drinkability is incredibly dangerous. 8%?? Where?  This is the epitomy of bold IPA's.

Smell: Light caramel malt aromas that become stronger upon swirling, rye spiciness and strong resiny hops and a hint of grain.  Taste: There's a lightly sweet caramel malt presence from start to finish that provides balance. The malt sweetness that's first evident is met by a nice spicy rye flavors in the center followed by an intense hop bitterness in the finish. The aftertaste is lingering bitterness with a light alcoholic spice.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, with moderate carbonation that somehow seems subdued.  Drinkability: The alcohol is well hidden and the beer is well-balanced.  Overall: Very tasty. The hop bitterness is high, but is balanced by an underlying maltiness that never seems too sweet.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

A nice frothy, light oatmeal colored head with icky sticky lace on the sides.  S: Creamsickle with subtle evergreen high notes and lymon lows. Obvious hints of rye.  T: Begins with some red fruit sweetness. Almost a rye/vanilla moment soon after that...very original. From there the hops pop up with tangerine, strawberry and some red wood. Lingering rye characteristics with a moderate bitterness.  M: Medium body, juicy and smooth.  D: For me, the beer starts out mediocre...until the palate adjusts to all the various flavors.

610,3158,froggyfrog,4.55,"A Hop Rod bomber bottle sits perched on a printed cardboard coaster on my desk. I've heard the hype. I've seen the ratings. Now my very own bottle waits, perfectly timed by a kind and knowledgeable trader to be enjoyed at its peak of perfection. And...it's on!  Serving vessel: A burly glass snifter. Serving temp: 50°F  First up for evaluation as always is the outward look. A moderate pour has produced a mountainous head, frothy with tenacious eggshell lace. The bowl is marbled with deep red and the dark purple of a two-day-old bruise. Jittery carbonation bubbles bounce to the surface like the juggling balls of some mad jester.  The smells coming off of this glass are breathtaking. The aroma is a whirlwind of malted milk, earthy/spicy citrus hops and hearty rye.  The taste is warm malt and dark rye with high bitterness and an exceptionally smooth finish. Alcohol is detectable but not dominant. The rye bread character coats the tongue while bitter hop acids linger like thousands of prickly needles. This beer stands out from the pack for its palate-exciting complexity in a style that can easily be overrun by monotonous hop flavors.  For mouthfeel, I like the way it travels; creamy texture with a dark bread twist and then, after you think it's gone, the hops pop up to bully the tongue.  Drinkable? Yeah. Good for an AIPA. Not a session beer by any stretch but a really nice treat.  RedwoodGeorge: Thanks for the hook-up!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

S-Citrus hops come through the stronger smell of rye bread. can't tell if there's malts or if it's just rye. T-The critrus hops make splashes in the pond of rye. There is also malts mixed in with the rye taste also. The rye taste is definitely the dominant taste. In the aftertaste it is a medium bitterness with rye bread and light citrus hops. M-Smooth, medium body, light/medium carbonation. D-Definitely different than any beer I've tried. It's good though.

Smell: A truly gorgeous aroma of toasted caramel and sweet brown sugar. Full, gorgeous notes of pine and grapefruit. There's rye in the scent, too, but I expected more. Still, if someone can beat that aroma I'll give them a shiny new quarter.  Taste: Big, rich caramel (and brown sugar) sweetness marked by heavy hop accents of grapefruit and pine and the apparent taste of rye. Also, a little bit of vanilla in there as well. Tangy rye-ish, sweet finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Excellent texture and carbonation.  Drinkability: An expertly crafted, wonderful beer. Marvelous!  Shiny new quarter.

Thick lacing along the sides of the glass. Classic west coast hoppy aroma loaded with freshly cut grapefruit and pine needles. Mouthfeel is quite full and round with just the right amount of carbonation for this style. Immediate flavors of spicey rye, orange, grapefruit and some lightly roasted malts make their presence. Although of course the hops dominate there is a notable background malt sweetness which balances it all out nicely. Finish is long, crisp and moderately bitter.

There is a diffinite hop bitterness from beginning to end. There is what I precieve as the malted rye that has sort of a sweet and dry taste.

610,3158,Derek,4.7,"Definitely more of a rye beer than Founder's Red's Rye (which should certainly be classified as an IPA). This one could fit comfortably under either category.  Compared to the Racer 5, there's more bitterness, but not as much hop flavour (which is rounded out with the malts).  A: Deep, deep amber/dark-caramel; fluffy, slightly off-white head, some retention, great lace.  S: Pine, floral, citrus, toffee, jaggery, dark rye bread.  T: Pine, citrus & spicy hop flavours are upfront. Dark rye bread and a little caramel balance out the flavour. Bitterness is quite assertive, but not harsh. Warming alcohol in the finish. The EXTREME fusion of flavours is truly exceptional!  M: Moderate to full body, moderate carbonation, slight acidity. Well attenuated with a relatively dry finish.  D: Incredible for its strength, but certainly a hop-heads delight.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Appearance is unremarkable, sort of coppery reddish brown with a thick stiff head that persissts. the smell is earthy/spicy over a robust maltiness good but not excessive citrus hops. The taste is well balanced, plenty of hops and noticeable alcohol but well counter-balanced with both malt sweetness and a certain earthy flair.

Appearance:  Pours a startingly clear brown with hints of ruby, accompanied by a half inch of tan cream. Glorious to behold.  Aroma:  This may rival Stone's IPA for aroma! Smells more like a grapefruit than some grapefruit I've had. Hints of malt present themselves as well, but hops take center stage. Very fresh.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  Mouthfeel is phenomenal. Smoothest IPA ever. This is perfection in a bottle!!! Hops are up front in your face citrusy, with a nice sweet malt background. Not sure if the rye accounts for smoothness, but this is dangerous. At 8% alcohol, this one packs a punch quickly, even though it tastes so good going down, you want to keep drinking.

The head is quite large and required a slow and controlled pour to keep it down, it hung around a little and laced nicely on the glass. Initial aroma is mainly a nice sweet orange smell, there is also a little grassiness that works in as it warms. There is also some sugary sprite like sweetness with a yeasty bread aroma. Taste is a nice balance between the sweet and bitter with a nice zip and a slight tanginess as well. There is a nice spice to the finish and a slight dryness. The alcohol is well balanced, I don't really notice it until the very end as it is pretty much at room temp. Easy to drink.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Smell has a nice mixture of piney green hops with a some bready toasted malt notes. Although its a little light.  Has a great mix of rye bread and toasted malt flavors with a very strong and bitter Juniper hop finish. As it warms the rye becomes stronger and the hops mellow a bit, but still is a very hoppy bitter beer.  Mouthfeel is very creamy with a dry finish.

A nice, dark amber/almost brownish body with a wafty tan head. Smell was of bittering hops and bready, toasty malt. A nice combination. I would have pegged it as an Irish Red Ale, or something along those lines, rather than an American IPA. Anyways, a nicely balanced beer with a medium mouthfeel and really easy going down. Definately worth trying!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Smell is strong, and is a nice mixture of hops and malt together. There is also a big chewy smell that is very enticing. Boy, does the taste sure deliver! The first quarter is heavy on the malt with the sweetness hitting immidiatly and playing on our tongue. The next big taste has the malt and hops together, and they create a synergistic effect that leaves you craving more. There is also a taste that is foreign to me, but I will say its Rye, as its a main ingredient in the beer. As this beer goes down it lingers for a while with a pleasant sweetness of the malts, and even at 8% there is no appearance of alcohol. Truely a special beer!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,nlmartin,5,This beer came to me by way of trade with dhchatfield. Thanks again! This would be my new go beer if it was available in Cincinnati.  The beer was poured into a pub glass and shared with my wife.  Appearance: The beer has a dark amber coloration. The beer has major amounts of particles floating in the beer. I swear it looks like rye seeds are floating in the beer. The head was a massive craggy creamy biege coloration. The head never gave up during the entire session. The beer left thick rings of pancake like lacing on my glass.  Smell: When I popped the cap on this beer I knew I had a winner. While still in the bottle my nose was assaulted with major rye and cascade hops. Upon pouring this beer in the glass. My initial thought was sorry honey you aint getting any of this. The beer had major rye bread smells. The cascade hops produced perfect citrusy lemon and lemon zest. Pine needles bring up the rear of the smell.  Taste: This may very well be the mother of all Rye beers. Gods this beer is loaded with rye upon breadyness. The flavor made me wish for some ham and cheese on rye bread. The citrus nature of the hops dominate the piney hop flavors.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is slightly bigger than medium body. The beer is well carbonated. The hops have a pleasant lingering oilyness. This beer is really something special. I enjoyed the beer from the instant I opened the beer. I would highly reccomend this beer to my other BA's.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Very fresh smell of rye blended with some spicy hop aromas. A slight smell of alcohol as well.  The taste is very powerful and clean, but also a little simple. I love the bitterness, but it lacks a little bit of complexity. Spicy hops up front followed by a pronounced rye flavor, some creaminess, and finally a long slow bitter burn.  Mouthfeel is very good. Creamy, nicely carbonated, good body.  Very drinkable- especially for an 8% abv. Nice long flavor that keeps you wanting more.

610,3158,BEERchitect,4.49,"Rye grains in any other beer style doesn't work for me. But in an IPA, I think it adds character and an intense bittering. An otherwise, great IPA has been improved with some serious hopping and a rye grain flavor / astringency than any malt base cannot compete with. Sweet, of course, but quickly dominated with hop citrus, pine, grass, and dirty flavors. Rye contributes a deep molassas bitter-sweetness and a grain husk bittering. Perhaps too astringent to make it easy drinking. Otherwise malty sweet with a dark toasted grain flavor. Bitter til the end with a shadowing sweetness, muskiness, and earthiness. Very good beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,dbalsock,4.43,"After having this numerous times and loving it, I think it's time for a formal review. Poured from a bomber bought about an hour ago.  Appearance: Murky red with an off-white head (about 1 1/2 fingers). It laces the glass beautifully as it settles.  Smell: Hops of course cloud the nose in grapefruit form, but are soon followed by a sweet fruity smell, almost like plums or prunes. Further comes the caramel malt taste.  Taste: Again the grapefruit with a caramel balance. It's piney and smokey almost like a coffee.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth yet bitter and tangy. awesome.  Drinkability: For something so high in abv, i want to treat it like a session beer. It's both tasty and engaging.

Medium plus body.  Smells very strongly of rye, orange/citrus hops. Light earthy smokiness, and a bit of grassiness.  Super rye taste initially that progresses into a citrus hoppy middle and finishes with a pleasant grassy, earthy, citrus hoppiness.  Supremely well balanced maltiness and hoppiness.

Aroma was of hops and something else I can't quite identify but is probably the rye. Taste was very hoppy like most IPA's but with a different background, again probably the rye, excellent flavor but not the regular sweet malt flavor you get in most IPA's. Went down very easily, would have gotten a 4.5 or 5 for drinkability but the high ABV means it's not a session beer, for me at least.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

The smell is more malty and sweet than I expected. Biscuits, and maybe a hint of rye. The hops are there, just not as dominate as I was expecting. Taste: Woaa there's the hops! Wonderful hop bitterness. It's a strange but very good hop flavor. I don't get the citrus, floral, or piney flavors that I've come to expect from hoppy beers. Maybe it's the rye mixture. The flavor is very strong and complex. You can taste the alcohol as the beer warms. The alcohol is very warming in the mouthfeel and the beer is a bit heavier bodied than most IPA's. This in no way detracts from the beer. I wouldn't consider this a session beer, but it is drinkable cause it's so damn tasty.

There was a nice hop bitterness that was just right. There was a red ale nature to this beer as well.  The mouthfeel was smooth. No overpowering notes of any type. Balanced.  The drinkability was superb. The higher ABV was so well hidden it may lead you to think this beer would session easy. A big beer that does not act big. This beer has fanfare and now I see why.

A - Pours a clean, transparent deep ruby color with a huge oatmeal head that would probably last until the next milenium if I gave it a chance. I have said it before, but BR knows how to brew a beer with an impressive head. This thing is thick as all hell.  S - Citrisy hops dominate, with the rye playing a subtle, yet unique background role.  T - I have said before that this beer could easily be classified as a double IPA, and I stand by that. Very aggressive hop up front, followed by one of the smoothest malt profiles I have ever had in an IPA.

Very attractive beer, but much darker as I would expect for an APA.  Piney and citrusy notes balence well with some malt presence as well. Slightly sweet malt flavors with just a little rye present to start with a nice dry, hoppy finish. The rye presence is there, but not as prevelant as I was expecting. The mouthfeel is much thinner than what I imagined when admiring this beer's appearance.  Just the right amount of bitterness to keep this beer very drinkable.

610,3158,InsolublePancake,4.05,"A- Dark copper with a great big off-white head and a very sticky lace. Quite appealing.  S- Huge hop aroma. Pine and citrus abound with sweet fruit and a touch of malt as well. Very nice, a near perfect IPA smell here!  T- Definitely a different tasting IPA. Starts with some sweetness coming from the malt and hop oils. Malt profile is interesting. The rye is definitely noticeable as there is a bit more of a spicy character here than the toasty one usually found in such IPA's. Sweetness is also lower than expected. Huge hop profile as expected, typical northwest flavors of pine and citrus that were alluded to in the aroma. Finishes with a big, chalky bitterness and some lingering spiciness from the malt. Hops are literally lip-smacking in this one, as the lips are actually sticky from hop oils following each sip!  M- Medium bodied and smooth, not a whole lot of carbonation, but enough to make it pleasant.  D- Easy to put down, but a little overbearing with the bitterness. High abv also contributes to make this a one-and-done beer for me.  Very nice, I enjoyed it. Bear Republic has impressed me with their beers so far, and this is no exception.

I truly enojoy the hoppyness and the crispness/spicyness/whatever-the-word-is-i-am-looking-for of the rye. It has convinced me to try and brew a rye beer of my own. The appearance is typical of an IPA, it may have been a bit darker, but then again underbones and the ph are kinda dark. Smell comes across initially as grapefruit, but then there is a new smell that must be due to the rye. Exceptional taste, as i mentioned above the hop/rye goes well together IMHO.

A modest 1/2"" head, but wow, I can smell the hops from across the room, so let me just jump to that portion of the review.  Delicious piney west coast hop aroma with more malt than I would have expected. Perhaps the rye brings out the malt in the aroma. Nevertheless, a wonderful smelling libation to be sure. Citrus notes cling to a rich backbone... fantastic.  While the hops are certainly there, the rye makes this one difficult to classify. It is certainly rich and deep enough in flavour to warrant a strong ale classification, but oh well, some beers defy classification. Overall, a wonderfully complex flavour... more so than your typical IPA.  Surprisingly thick with low levels of carbonation, again like a strong ale. I think it fits this brew perfectly.  Extremely drinkable and enjoyable for an 8% brew. This one will certainly frequent my fridge in the future.

The hops content is fantastic and overwhelms the nose at first. I sensed a bit of malt but it could have been my imagination. It tastes of bitter hops and is well balanced with a malty rich profile. There is a fantastic balance in this beer that made me want to go to the store and grab some more after the first sip. It coats the mouth very well and the bitterness on the back of the throat is strong but palpable. This is a very drinkable beer.

If I could give this beer a 5.5 for appearance I would. The aroma is sharp, spicy, citrusy, grapefruit, with a nice malty undertone. The taste is sharp like the aroma, but more so from the hops than from the rye. The bitterness leads the way with the rye coming through in the aftertaste.

Just hops. A bit piney, a bit bready.  Taste: Again, the predominant flavor was hops; it tastes like it smells. However, it was actually pretty mild and not too bitter. Slightly buttery, slightly carmelly, but hard to place in general.  Mouthfeel: Mildy bitter but no intrusive carbonation or alcohol burn. Overall, very smooth.  Drinkability: Pretty mild, easy to drink - seems like a good compromise between an IPA and a more standard ale, as the rye seems to make it a bit richer while the hops aren't as intense as they would be in the average IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Nose is extremely piney, almost toxic smelling. Taste is initilly very piney with minor grapefruit tones. This trails down into an almost herbal quality, tea-like. Quite good, but definitely aggressive with the hops, a bit too much so for my tastes. Mouthfeel is thin and slightly slick, not particularly well carbonated.

Taste: Malty flavor balanced by a hoppy middle. Finishes quite bitter on the palette because of the hop profile, but not overly so. Bitter finish does not linger...  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, Crisp finish after a smooth middle. Tastes clean.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. Refreshing & smooth. Would need to be cautious with these due to the 8% ABV. I could drink a few..  Comment: This was a very good beer. I liked it all the way through the bomber. Nice example of the style....",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ccs,4.07,"Dark amber with a slightly off-white head. Lacing left along the glass all the way down. Smells of malt and caramel. Taste is a little surprising, since very little hops is detectable in aroma, but it is very much a hoppy beverage. Carbonation was a little choopy, making for an odd over-carbonated mouthfeel.

610,3158,Phyl21ca,3.77,Bottle from Hogtownharry: Poured a dark amber color ale with huge foamy off-white heat with great retention and lacing. Aroma of citrus hops with good malt backbone is very interesting. Taste is a mix between semi-sweet caramel malt with some c-hops that provide a bitter finish. Rye is quite hard to distinguish and doesnt seem to provide that much in the overall mix. Body is slightly above average and alcohol is well hidden. Very well done overall but definitely not a style (American strong ale) that really excite me.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BradBLR,4.29,"This is to date the coolest looking beer I have had. Poured this one in a 20 oz. glass and it had a great head. Half the glass was a nice yellowing foam, and it lasted almost the whole life of the beer. Color was a brownish red, much darker than any IPA I've had. The smell of this beer was ok, it was a rye hop smell where I think the rye and the hops kind of contradicted each other not giving this beer a very strong aroma.  The taste of this beer was reaaly good. The first couple of drinks were very bitter, really tasting the rye. The after that is was a very well balanced beer with a strong rye and hop flavor, very smooth. The mouthfeel of this beer was right on for a strong IPA.  All in all a great beer and one of the most amazing beers to come out of a bottle. Bear Republic probably does bottling better than any one else. Try it if you get a chance.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,hoffman,4.53,"I have a fever...and the only prescription...is more hops. This one doesn't dissapoint. By far the darkest IPA I have ever encountered, this also makes the beer possibly one of the most attractive in the glass..that and it's glue like tan/mocha head that rises past two fingers and stays at one finger throgh the first 3/4 of the session....wow. The smell is robust and full piney floral hops, a definite rye tinge and even some woody notes, very herbal. The taste is nice, more roasted malt than I had expected...and almost perfectly balanced....wow again. The mouthfeel is ultra creamy with just enough carbonation to let you know what you are drinking. I could slam this one all day long...and then go to sleep.

Aromas of pine and citrus, some grapefruit, sweet malt. I was pleasantly surprised, as I was expecting an over-the-top hop smell. But this is extremely balanced.  The taste was quite surprising. I liked this beer much more than I expected. It is exquisitely balanced, with a lot of hops presence however is it complimented with a very satisfying malt flavor. I really like this. As it warms, the rye flavor begins to come through, although it is very slight and it stays n the background.  Mouthfeel was a little over carbonated. Medium thick feel.  Nice beer. It came highly recommended, but I was a little concerned that it would have too much of a hop flavor for my tastes, but I was pleasantly surprised.

The smell is very hoppy with a bunch of grapefruit and spices hitting my nose very nicely.  The taste is big on hops up front. Nice flavours of grapefruit and spiciness hit my palate causing me to make a smacking noise. ;^) There's also a bit of malt presence that sweetens it up just a tad mid way through and the finish is the closest this brew comes to being balanced but...no matter how you slice it, this is one hella good tasting IPA that really satisfies in every category.

610,3158,gbarron,3.93,"From a 22 oz. bomber. Hopefully this 'bear' of a beer had no trouble making it all the way to Va from Cali.  A - deep ruby, slightly brownish red. Perfectly clear. Head is very beautiful -- puffy, rich bed of small bubbles, off-white in color. Hangs around the entire way leaving excellent lacing. Beautiful beer.  S - mixture of tart, tangy hops, malt sugar sweetness, and alcohol. Hop aroma is resinous, pine, and citrus. Lots of malt backbone, sugar, caramel, and higher alcohols.  T - richly flavored, big beer. Deep malt sweetness, toffee, butter. Sticky candy sugar sweetness. Balanced out by tart, acidic citrusy hop flavor and bitterness. Aftertaste is very warming, alcoholic. Don't know that I'm picking up a lot of the rye here - although there is a tangy, tart flavor to this beer.  M - medium to full bodied beer, slightly syrupy and sticky in your mouth, both due to the malt bill and hop content of this beer.  D - this is a very, very tasty product and well crafted, but the full body, above average alcohol content, malty sweetness, and strong bitterness is so great, I couldn't drink more than one or two of these in a sitting.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Taste - From the smell I totally expected the taste of malts to outpower the hops, I was wrong. While the beer obviously has plenty of malts to go with the hops, it is extrememly well balanced. I have never had anything with Rye in it that I have enjoyed, but I really enjoyed this beer.  Mouthfeel - Medium body.  Drinkability - Extremely drinkable. I really wish I had a case of this.

Beer is a red-brown color and has a few random bubbles coming up through the glass.  Nose: Hops!! The hops go so deep it's like I'm smelling them with my throat. Also has the presence of strawberries or another red fruit.  Mouth: This beer is so hoppy the bitterness actually burns, but in a yummy way. The hops carry an excellent herbal spiciness with them and the high alcohol content just heats those flavors up to an even more amazing degree. The only let down is the soft mouthfeel that really disappoints me because otherwise this would be one hell of a beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,yelterdow,4.03,"Found at Cable Beverage in NY, not available yet in NJ. Bomber served at just over fridge temperature in a pint glass, on a humid late Spring evening.  Appearance- As I pour the beer with my usual tilted pint glass, the head beelines for the rim. A gorgeous deep, reddish iced tea colored beer supports a wickedly alive bone white head... three to four fingers easy, and five minutes later it's still huge and thick. Lacing is ridiculous beyond description... more sculpturous than just sticky. A balls to the wall IPA in the eyes department.  Smell- Citrus meets sweet, with a superbly balanced malt backbone. Terrific and remarkably appetizing... it smells big, yet not overwhelming like some DIPAs of elevated abv that go way overboard with hopping. Nice and round.  Taste- A definite rye character meanders throughout the aggressive hop journey, while the malt notes counter nicely. Hops are king here, along with a slight alcohol burn that detracts just a bit. Still, an IPA lover's muse.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Medium bodied in the mouth, with just enough to keep it alive. This beer is much bigger than its mouthfeel suggests, as it packs its punch enormously in the belly and body.

The rye hit my tongue at first but after a couple sips it went away and all I noticed was a citrusy orange and nice hoppy floral flavor. Oh wait, there's something like caramel in there too.  This rolls around the mouth all too well. I think I like the aftertaste better than the taste itself!  I deducted a bit on the ""drinkability"", because while it is quite drinkable, it's too hoppy for me.

610,3158,Ego,3.96,"found at cable beverage, bardonia, ny (I have also seen it at deciccos in pelham ny)  eyes... 2 full fingers of tan froth, it simmers as it slowly recedes, the head is big and soapy and retention is quite good. it slowly forms crags and melts down into the beer... leaving a good amount of beer batter on the sides of the glass, dark chestnut in color, there are some floaters in there as this is unfiltered.. really nice. (is this really a straight up IPA?)  nose... the rye is mega hard to detect.. this is almost all hops, the rye comes in the back end of the aroma piggy backing itself on the coattails of the florals from the hops, after it sits a bit you can get some tasty caramel tones as well.. but mostly this is hops... it's pretty good  taste etc... I immediately get the rye actually, it is a strange flavor in a beer, almost liek bitter malts.. or the quality of smoked malts.. something like that, mouthfeel is medium to full with the carbonation just right... it carries the brew and is a little prickly on the tongue, ah, now I am getting more of the hop oils... but I wouldn't condier this super oily like some suped up IPAs, it is somewhere in the middle of ""coating"" and then it leaves the mouth fro your next sip. there is definite warming and almost acid burn on this one... but you don't taste the alcohol at all, in some strange way it drinks/feels like an overhopped brown ale.. wierd... but not a complaint. I am not blown away by the hops here actually.. this doesn't even seem too bitter to me, there is just a nice lingering balance with some bitterness left on the back of my tongue.. honestly the beer burps are hoppier than I think the beer is.. maybe my stomach is just rewarding me...  verdict? I needed some corn beef and gulden's mustard to go with this... just kidding. I don't think you can compare this to your everyday IPA.. it is very different. maybe a bit too heavy for an IPA ? regardless it is quite enjoyable, for the price it is very nice... another good one from Bear Republic... come to new jersey goddamnit !!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,plaid75,4.38,"Poured a deep hazy dark amber/ruby hue with two fingers of thick, clumpy and creamy head. There was excellent retention and superb sticky lacing. Very impressive.  The smell was dominated by a citrusy hop aroma. There was a decent grain presence and little touch of spice - perhaps the rye.  The taste was full blown hops. Beautiful oily hop flavor, balanced with a spicy grain and malt element. A nice clean biscuity aftertaste. A bit of an alcohol presence.  The mouthfeel was full and smooth. Excellent carbonation.

610,3158,matjack85,4.42,"This beer poured a cola like color in the glass, but was red when held to light.

In fact there was still a bit of foam left in the glass even after I was finished, and it left a lot of lace all the way down the sides.  Huge grapefruit citrus and piney hops nose. The 18% rye content is noticeable as well. For an 8% abv beer, the alcohol is well hidden.  That huge hops smell isn't there for nothing. This is an immensely hoppy and bitter brew, not for the novice beer drinker. Loaded with hops, rye, citrus flavor, and spice - then a splash of malt all wrapped up in one beer. Delicious!  For all the bitterness, this beer maintains a silky smooth mouthfeel. I can't get over the creamy velvety texture of this beer while at the same time imparting a kick-ass bitterness.

The smell is mainly hops, but it smells a little like La Chouffe too (maybe some coriander). The flavor is spicy and hoppy with an intense bitter after-taste. Maybe the rye adds some spicy quality to the flavor... Kind of medium body, not as thick as DF 90min but not as light as Goose Island IPA.

The freshest orangey hops aroma, wonderfully addictive.  Ta/Mf: Big malt, smooth and complex. The flavor profile evolves from sweetish malt into bitter hops in a transition that is near magic. I expected an ale that would be heavy and hard to drink, but this one is medium bodied, very smooth, and an absolute pleasure to imbibe. Finishes with a slight spicey-cinnamon edge, again pleasant.

Very piney floral flavors with a light rye backbone.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,VoodooBrew,4.38,"22 oz bomber. I brought this back from a recent trip to Cape Cod. The color is a deep amber-copper with reddish highlights. Nice clarity, big fluffy light tan head. Hops feature prominently on the nose. The aromas are floral, sweet, and surprisingly a little subdued. On the palate, clean and semi-fruity hop notes transition smoothly into a robust bitterness that lasts long into the finish and aftertaste. For a beer of this size I'd expect more malt to figure in there somewhere but it's really mostly hops. Luckily for me I love hops, but others may see this as more of a flaw. Later on the hops take on a spicier note, and this may be the rye perking up as well. The aftertaste also contains that characteristic rye sharpness. The alcohol (8%) is surprisingly well-hidden, and only begins to stir in the gut after several sips. This is pretty much on the low end of the Double IPAs.  I'm not sure how old this bottle was when I bought it, and age may have taken a slight toll on the aroma.

Seriously, when I finished the last sip in my glass there was still this little dollop of cream sitting in the bottom of the glass. Admittedly, I love rye beers and this is no exception. Nose is oat and bread malts with wonderful fruit esters, pine, and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is massages the tongue like the older girl who taught you how to kiss in high school.

610,3158,soultrain,5,"Poured into an Ommegang Chalice.  A-reddish dark amber, the word ""garnet"" comes to mind, hop/ yeast chunks abound in a great way... thick beige head, rocky as all hell, though not quite Duvel in it's impressiveness, it's damn close...Christ what a head...mooncrater fascination and everything...crazy lacing lasts long after the glass is drained. S-Dry hopped ale scent/sweetness/bitter fruit astringent hop smell which I love; smells like an invitation to a ritual, and it is. Since my first review, I have reaccessed my initial ""smell"" number.... I actually docked the smell 1/2 point because, in my imagination, it could be even more enticing if it was even more pungently hoppier...but that's bullshit; let's dwell upon what actually exists on earth, here, now: this beer smells awsome; it is unique in it's aroma, and to dock points off from this beer because of some imaginary hop notion, would indeed impoverish the language, and atrophy the soul of beer advocacy. I have yet to encounter a beer related scent that is more enticing, yes, even in Stone Ruination. T-Rye makes it's presence known here, but in a not overpowering way: in fact the way it appears is very subtle: a slight sourness/ a slight breadiness, and then in the fantastic protiens that make up the head of this tremendous beer! Seriously balanced malt/hop ratio is obvious though, but in my present acolyte state I cannot discern what the malt is (besides Rye) or what the precise hops are...seems to me that grapefruity cascades (+ some serious I.B.U. hops of the California variety) are in the house to some great degree....middle is really juicy...god this is good...8% alcohol is totally absent. and I mean ABSENT from the palette; this Bear Republic brewer obviously knows his stuff..semi-dry finish....Aftertaste is sublime and demands repeated sips, gulps, bottles....This beer probably goes well with some foods; but it is best consumed by itself....to be contemplated as the work of brewing art that it is....IMHO. M-Perfect. Wouldn't change a thing. All beers should have this mouthfeel....really... D-Sublime Drinkability. S U B L I M E. Damn! CRUX: ESSENTIAL RYE HOP BOMB EARTHY GIFT FROM THE GODS. This is ALWAYS in my DBF, as this beer is in my top 5 beers of all time. This beer is a masterpiece, and as a creation it's as fine, essential, and profound as: air conditioning, James Brown's back catalog, penicillin, Jackson Pollock, anesthesia, the selected poetry of Ranier Maria Rilke, air bags, Bose speakers, and Blue Note vinyl records. Damn!, it's poetry time!:  But because Truly being here is so much; because everything here apparently needs us, this fleeting world, which in some strange way keeps calling to us. Us, the most fleeting of all. Once for each thing. Just once; no more. And we too, just once. And never again. But to have been this once, completely, even if only once: to have been at one with the earth, seems beyond undoing.  Ranier Maria Rilke, 9th Elegy.  **NOTE: It took me at least 12 bottles to come to these scores. When I first tried this beer, it was my first ""rye beer"" and I thought it was a great ""one note"" IPA. That ""note"" was a good ""note"" though, akin to the ""one note"" guitar solo in Neil Young's ""Down By The River,"" but further bottles have revealed that this is indeed ""the gift that keeps on giving,"" and very complex IPA worthy of serious consideration. I have been totally seduced by this ""perfection in a glass"" fantastic Rye IPA. Is this review too long? Yes, even I think so, but I find something to appreciate in each new bottle, and cannot imagine tiring of this beer, ever....TOP, TOP NOTCH STUFF!  THE END.

610,3158,MEANxOLDxTOM,4.48,"On tap at House Of Brews in NYC. A- The beer was a bronze color with redish orangish hints, with an off white/pearl colored head that left a sticky lace around the glass. S- The smell was of strong citrus and resiny hops and just the slightest bit of malt. T- The hops are definitely present all the way through this beer. There was a nice balance of malts and hops in the beginning, but as soon as the middle of the body hit the hops took over. It was definitely the citrus hops that came out in the smell, but was lacking the resiny/dank taste that I was expecting. The finish was really big, really hopy, and pretty bitter. (although it took me drinking another rye beer...I know know the smell and taste...this one definitly had it in both smell and taste). M/D- This was in enjoyable IPA. The after taste was bitter and lingered a long time.I can't say that it really blew my socks off, but I will definitely give it another try.  NOTE: I drank a bomber of this again last night and it was totally different. I can now confirm that something was wrong with the taps at house of brews....both Hop Rod Rye and Magic Hat #9 tasted off during my visit.

610,3158,Metalmonk,4.03,"Looks great in the glass, a deep burgundy/ruby color, with a soapy beige head that lasts a good bit then finally gives way to splotchy walls of lace. Pretty mild carbonation which, along with the color, reminded me more of a barleywine than an America IPA. [Depending on your inclinations, be careful how you pour...my second and final pour resulted in a mass of large flakes floating in the beer...they warn you about this on the label...kinda cool, like hops pulp or something...]  Smells are faint but solid, obvious grapefruity hops sourness and mild grains but not much else.  The rye really comes through in the flavor, and it's an appreciated balance to the pine/grapefruit essence of the hops. The flavor sticks in the mouth, you can ride it out a good while between sips, so it's a beer you can savor. Nice breadiness pervades too, which makes this feel more like a meal.  I was hoping for a little more weight or presence in the mouth, but it's on the watery side. Luckily the flavors stick around for a while, regardless of the thin body.  This is a cool take on the American IPA, with that rye essence coming through not just in name but full-on in the flavor.

Aroma is mostly hops, pine & citrus, but their are some mild notes of rye malt.  Taste is hoppy as well....rye malt, with pine, & grapefruit hop flavors throughout. The malt backbone balances this beer out extremely well. Nice lingering hop bitterness in the finish. The rye is noticeable throughout, but seems more prevalent in the aftertaste.  Medium bodied, with light carbonation. Definite alcohol kick which kind of sneaks up on you. Easier to drink than I expected, if it wasn't for the 8% ABV I could see drinking quite a few of these at a time.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,granger10,4.5,"Darker mohogany color with copper twinge. Meduim creamy dense tan head rests atop. Lots of bubbles rising. A few hop flakes seem to have found their way in. A hop blast greets me as I smell the beer. Spicy, piney hops. Caramel, rye flakes. A bit of some roasted malts compliment the spicyness. Taste seems to follow suit. Begins with the huge hop hit. Spicy and bitter but not overdone. Caramel and bready flavors balance it out. Bitterness wins but the malts add another element of flavor. A slight alcohol burn lends a hand towards the finish. Rye seems to be there but really brings out a spicy, sweet finish with some hop flavor melded together. Slick body with the right amount of spicyness and pricklyness. Fresh tasting, I could drink many of these. Well done all around.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,kmo1030,4.47,"dark mahogany with a tan head. huge hoppy aroma, with a piney grapefruit rind, almost minty menthol smell. the rye is faintly apparent along with some malty aromas. toasty caramel and spicy rye make up the non hoppy portion of the flavor. sticky pine needle hops, round out the rest. the true greatness of the flavor doesn't come from the necessarily stellar flavors, but from the unique balance that is achieved here with a very healthy dose of hop bitterness, and the malty/rye characterisitcs. it is quite bitter, but you almost don't notice it. i'm impressed. full medium body with active, but fine carbonation. it achieves a creamy texture. very drinkable, it makes a good sessionable higher abv hop heads beer if that makes sense. bitter hoppy, fairly complex, but mellow and smooth. very nice.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,DaggerEyes,4.54,"Poured out of a 22 oz into my trusty pint glass.  Poured with a rowdy 3 finger foamy head that had me diving to the class slurping in order to prevent spillage. After settling slightly the head fell down to a rocky craggy foam of two fingers. What a great great looking head. Sticky as hell lace has been left all over the upper regions of the glass where the head once was. The color was an opaque and deep mahogony.  What a nose. So wonderfully balanced sweet sugary malts, smells like candied fruit mingle with bitter citrusy hops. Very fragrent. some slight floral or honey smells creep in. Also some ever so slight buttery notes.  The rye is really present in the mouth spicey with the bitter cirtus flavors of the hops...It's not too much though as a subtle sweet carmel-esque backbone balances it out. This is an extremely active beer with an incredible mouthfeel. Medium to full body with a good amount of carbonation and a fairly clean, though bitter thick and bold finish...this beer really gives your mouth a work out.  A very drinkable beer. Wonderful to kick back and enjoy on it's own. Bitter as all hell. A very very unique American IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ultralarry2006,2.96,"Light brown two finger head poured from 22 oz.'er. Deeper than normal copper for an IPA, more copper than orange, and there was the expected haze. Very nice lacing. Aroma -citrus, and diacetyl malt. Taste - the citrus hops, of course and slight diacetyl, somewhat less than aroma had me expecting, which is good because I rather dislike the diacetyl taste, instead the malt had a small somewhat doughy taste upfront, which I suspect is due to the rye, but then diacetyl aftertaste made unusally bitter by the citrusy hops. The mouth was fairly smooth owing to the hops, and somewhat more carbonated than I expect or want for an IPA, leaving a slightly thick, and bitter coating. Diacetyl usaully ruins a brew for me and this is the case here- Hop Rod was an okay ride- but one I think will let pass me by when hitchhiking the HopHead Highway.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,bruachan,4.18,"for some reason i love rye beers. this one in particular is a gem  dark ruby poured to the edge of the glass (therefore no head to speak of. but i'm convinced there would be a nice one, if allowed. it's tight)  the hops are scaled back to let the rye shine (i think we're in the 55-60 IBU range). and the rye does shine, slipping in with the bitterness and supplying a nice spicy kick. almost a tactile quality as well. can't smell it, but that coul dbe my fault or a result of drinking it in a restaurant setting  honeycomb lacing atop the brew, with a collar and some frostiness left down the glass  clean malt, floral hop aroma  i love this stuff, man. i wish they had the black rye when i was there; i'd love to try it",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

The bouquet includes mango, some rye tang, pineapple, mandarin oranges, ruby red grapefruit, pine, and some alcohol. Smells wonderful. It tastes similar to the aroma with the addition of caramel/buttery malts, biscuits, and a healthy bitterness on top of a big, creamy, chewy body. This is quite drinkable and a nice take on an IPA. I like the rye kick, as it blends well with the other flavors and doesn't overpower them. Delicious.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,barknee,4.15,"H.R.R. pours dark amber with a rich mocha colored head with generous carbonation visible within, creating a well-aerated frothy head and a well-mannered nose of fresh hops, sweet malt and pine. The mouthfeel is moderately bitter, with a viscous coating within the mouth. Hints of sweet honeyed cashew and a nice citric element draw the taste buds to attention. This brew is nicely balanced in all of the senses, very much in proportion and quite an enjoyable west coast libation.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ITK4ever,3.97,"I had heard so much about this that I had to try it. It was on many folks' list on their all-time hoppy beers. As an IPA, I was rather confused when pouring this into a glass. Poured a deep copper color...darker than any IPA I had seen up to this point. Good light tan head that lasted. You can pick up a hint of rye in the nose, but the hops overpower. I was expecting a little more from the rye, and I'm not really sure why it's there at all, which make this beer a little disappointing to me.  It is different, however. But, I would like to see this a little less hoppy and step up the rye to really set it apart.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ReDave,4.38,"Rather dark amber really brown color. [served in my favorite Imperial Nonic) Nice aroma. The head just wont' quit! Beautiful Brussels lace all the way down! While the mouthfeel is full and somewhat balanced, wonderful hop bitterness grabs you, and provides a great aftertaste. Rye doesn't jump out at you but is present. Very fitting for a hop head like me. Rye IPA is becoming one of my favorite styles. [Everything from Bear Republic is GREAT!]",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,WeymouthMike,3.92,"Well at first appearance this doesn't look anything like any ipa I've had before. Appearance is a dark amber similar to what I would expect from a winter warmer, head is creamy similar to a Guiness. This beer explodes with aromas of pine and citrus,more than I've ever experienced in an IPA. Taste is similar to smell with pine and citrus as the predominant flavors with a strong bite at first taste. Mouthfeel is smooth after the initial carbonation bite, the 8% alcohol is hidden pretty well. After drinking for a while I notice quite the build up in my mouth of hops. Drinkability, I would put simply as I would have no problem downing a bomber but as with most strong IPA's I'd better be home if I wanted to have another. For price factor this is an incredible beer, I paid around $4 for a bomber.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,bjohnson,4.15,"A: Pours a dark amber color with a nice frothy cream colored two finger head that leaves wonderful lace.  S: Aromas of hops hit the nose first--definately got the rye notes combined with less potent citric and pine.  T: Taste of hops come first with a nice malty combination. Mostly citric and pine notes, but the rye is definately present. Not overly bitter.  M & D: Mouthfeel and drinkability on this one are very high. Well balanced and smooth make is a nice session beer. Good carbonation and a smooth finish allow you to take advantage of the complex taste. High alcohol content isn't very noticeable--this may creap up on you depending on how many you drink.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Terp96,4.37,"This is one of my old standbys. I liken it to Arrogant Bastard as it has many of the same qualities.  Very hoppy, spicy aroma and taste up front. This beer is very complex. Even more so when it warms up a bit.  So balanced with a nice malty sweetness and a huge hop backbone. You can even taste a little of the rye kick as it warms.  One of the best beers I have ever had.  PS Why is this labeled a seasonal? Is it really? I have been able to get it regularly for a few years now.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Great tasting beer, in which one can get in trouble with. Bear Republic, make some very good IPAs. These I would consider to session beers, because you can drink more than one because of the great taste. If anyone hasn't tried Bear Republic than they should, awesome double IPA. I want to state something about Bear Republics IPAs, they are dangerous, they are enjoyable to drink and one can drink one after the other. Awesome beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,wingnutter,4.25,"Poured into a tulip pint glass....I was surprised at how dark this beer is. Deep brown/mohageny color with a HUGE off white head (aggressive pour) that dwindles down to a thin layer as I drink it. Glass has lacing rings throughout.  Smells sweet, hoppy, citrusy, piney....Im not sure what rye smells like, but this smells pretty damn good. Alot going on in the nose.  Taste - Wow, this is a smooth, balanced, hoppy beer. Sweetness right off the bat with enough bitter/citrusy hops in the front to make it taste like a true IPA. Piney hops also make an appearance. Medium to thin mouthfeel, which is a surprise....I was hoping it would feel more like Racer 5, which has a thicker feel to it. It does have a creaminess to it though. Dry, hoppy finigh that lingers a bit. Another winner from Bear Republic. Dangerous drinkability.  Bear Republic has impressed me with every one of their beers Ive tried. They get it done consistantly, and at a high level. They are quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries.

This is a great smelling IPA,  T - First sip is hard for me to describe... I'm not familiar with rye and this is my first rye IPA but the very first thought that came to mind was: balanced. Big nose of hops as you take a sip and a nice malty, I guess rye?, sweetness balanced with the citusy and piny hops. It's not overly bitter so I was shocked to see it listed at 90+ IBU. I certainly can't tell. Delicious. The finish is slightly dry - makes you want to drink more.  M - Malty and smooth. Moderate carbonation. An easy drinking malty IPA that can easily sneak up on your at 8% ABV.  D - I highly recommend this one. It's very drinkable and if I wasn't such a lightweight I'd probably drink 3 or 4 of these things in one sitting. In my opinion, this is a robust 'session' beer - ok maybe not sessionable at 8% but tastes like you could.

The aroma was significantly hoppy and I noticed the head was tinted green after the initial wiff. Can smell influence sight?? The flavor at first sip was not expected, clean...balanced. Then after the second sip, the character of this beer came through. It was hoppy and dry. The rye was clearly in the swallow and left my throat parched and wanting more.

Thin tan head on top that wasn't sticking around for the whole ride. The nose was of big, citrusy hops, very little pine in this one, lots of citrus, also a heavy nose of rye. The taste is sweet malt that is dominated by the rye flavor that doesn't overwhelm, but doesn't hide either. Thick citrus flavor sticks to your mouth while drinking this amazing beer. I made the comment that I almost wanted to drop some saurkraut and swiss cheese in it. I would definiately pair this with a lighter flavored cheese, or a reuben sandwich.

Excellenct lacing.  A big burst of citrus aroma, and also traces of smoke.  Taste is ...remarkable. An assertive malty caramel foundation not only kicks things off, but seems to alternate sips with a piney/citrus hop blast. A true miracle of balance. The rye seems to add a little base grit to the whole thing and makes the whole brew distinct from the typical ""West Coast Big IPA"".  Mouthfeel is just ridiculously creamy damn fine. Drinkability? This is a rapidly disappearing bomber, and I look forward to one day revisiting this fine brew.

610,3158,numenor1,4.16,"Clear copper colored, few streams of carbonation, some floaties (I dont mind), very finely bubbled, yet massive khaki head. Very sticky, and long lasting. The nose is a perfect balance of muted hops, rye and toasty caramel malts with a slight burnt aspect. Based on other reviewers, I really think there's quite a bit of bottle age on this one. I venture at least a year, perhaps more. Flavor upfront is wide and expansive toasty, rye, very slightly sweet. Muted by underlying bitterness, but that seems very muted as well like the hop flavor. There's some definite age to this. This could almost fit into the old ale category, not IPA. That said, the balance is spectacular. Very slow evolving flavor, and ponderous as slight hops ebb in and out between substantial malt and alcohol/rye spice. At this stage the rye is very evident. Very full in the mouth with light carbonation, perfectly creamy. Very drinkable, but due to the age, ponderous. I like it this way, though, i am sure, a completely different animal than when fresh. Shouldn't even be considered the same beer. That said, anyone with ready access to this should try aging it a bit.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

I wasn't very impressed with the bottle serving, but on draught this beer was outstanding!  It was served to me in a pint glass, with a nice 3/4-1"" of foam. It never really dissipated-- left a beautiful lace on the glass as I drank.  The taste was outstanding-- although I'm not a huge fan of Rye, I could taste it immediately in this beer. That broke through to a nice malt and hoppiness, and was very smooth going down. Definitely not a ""session"" beer-- I could only drink one.

As it is consumed this brew leaves leaves solid sheets of lace and a few very thick pillows of lace on the sides of the glass... artistry.  Aroma is malty, bready and sweet with some vinous notes and some floral hints.

Were it not for the thorough recommendations this beer had been given, I never would have tried it. Stupid rye.  Thank god I taste absolutely no rye in this at all. It pours a dark auburn color with a beefy head - that retains seemingly forever. The aroma is all hops- very piney with a slight nuttiness. The malty flavor adds a great taste to the overwhelmingly wonderful hops. It's sweet and bitter. A nice alcohol warming as the creamy beverage smooths out.

610,3158,Dukeofearl,4,"22 ounce bomber purchased at La Bodega in Riverside Ca, in Feb, 2006, for $3.49.  Pours a deep dark amber, almost brown, but there are way too many red highlights in this beer to be brown. What's the hair color term- auburn? OK, it's auburn. A largish wihte head (it overflowed my Imperial Pint glass) that mellowed out in a decent amount of time.  Aroma is west coast hops. In your face hops. Get-down get-funky hops. Caramel-burnt-toffee back burner notes, but just as a reminder that this isn't pure hop juice. Oily, piney, flowers, but only big, strong masculine flowers. Maybe cactus flowers (although I can't say I have ever found an aroma in cactus flowers, the analogy works).  Flavor is definite DIPA bold hoppiness in all its glory. Dark roasty malts actually stand up to be counted- is this the rye doing this (I love rye bread, and I see it here)? Definte style points for that.  Mouthfeel is incredibly rich, chewy, bold and strong.  I have to admit, all said and done, I think this is one I might love on the right time, on the right day.

I've reviewed this once before and much of what I said stands but a couple additions are merited: the bitterness that lives in the flavor is a dark chocolate bitterness... really quite pleasant if you like that kind of thing. This is a different looking, different smelling, different tasting double IPA. Sweeter, maltier and deeper tasting. This could easily hide more alcohol within the Big-ness of the flavor, though it has a good kick as it stands. Maybe somewhere in a spectrum between an IPA and barleywine?

Pine hops taste up front followed by the sweet finish. Malt candy sweetness comes through as you drink more but it never becomes overbearing. Slighly bitter aftertaste but not overly so. 8% ABV is nicely hidden.  One of the few double IPA that had enough hops bitterness to cover the sweetness. This is one I really enjoyed. Another winner from Bear Republic. Much thanks to the immortal maltygoodness.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ghostwalker,4.3,"Dark reddish-brown body, huge thick flufffy white head. Really a cool looking brew and different from almost any other IPA that I can think of.  Nose is fresh pine/grapefruit hops. Definitely a sign of hops to come.  Flavor is delicious, quenching, tantalizing hops. God, this stuff is great! The word Rye in the name threw me off a bit. I did not expect this. This is a world class West Coast IPA. Some malt and perhaps rye flavor in the middle, I can't really tell behind all the wonderful, wonderful hops. This is not a balanced brew, and I really couldn't care less. Nearly perfect.  Mouthfeel is medium-smooth with a great hop zing and some sense of piney hop residue. It has enough of that tooth enamel stripping IPA'ness to enjoy without being annoying or painful.  Drinkability is very high. I could session this one with great ease and pleasure.  I have seen this on tap at Redbones, but passed on it since they had Stone IPA and I just wasn't sure about it. I will never make that mistake again.Great work, Bear Republic!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,mrasskicktastic,4.09,"A - What a head! It is thick, creamy and never goes away. The brew is a slightly hazy scarlet. The lacing (although it takes forever) leaves giant thick rings of lacing on the sides of the glass. After twenty minutes the head is still substantial. An island of head is left in the middle of the glass after the sides finally dissipate. My very last swig was a mouthful of head, that is the first time that ever happened to me. When I reached the bottom, the monsterous lacing made the glass look like the painted desert.  S - The strong pine (frazier fir if I had to choose) and alcohol odors blend and form something which smells like a Christmas tree farm and grain alcohol (or maybe a drunk Christmas tree farmhand). There is a barely discernable malt character underneath. The alcohol is too strong for my liking, it actually burns my nose a bit.  T - The hops are not nearly as intense as I was anticipating. It has a definite pine character, but other flavors are prominant. There is a smoked oak flavor and some floral hops (lillies and a bit of roses) in the taste. A caramel malt and some faint coffee as well. The beer has a sweetness to it, but it doesn't seem to be a caramel-like sweetness. I think that sweet flavor is from the rye. The aftertaste is more mild than the foretaste is. It has some light coffee bitterness, pine bitterness and a touch of rye seed spiciness as well. The alcohol is not detectable in the flavor.  M - The beer is medium viscosity and very smooth. It could be better in the refreshing category, but it could be a lot worse.  D - I really enjoyed this one. It has a fabulous taste and a great look. I see why everyone enjoys this so much. I could buy this again definitely (especially with Bear Republic's reasonable bomber prices).

Nice head and excellent lacing.  The smell has a big aroma coming right out of the bottle. Following the lines of RyePA. Pine notes with citrus overtones really dominate the aroma. Limited malt smells but there are caramel and basic malt smells are present. Some hints of rye as well.  The taste is mild hop taste and a good spicy flavor from the rye. A good piney taste upfront that quickly makes room for a limited bite from lingering bitterness and rye. A slight astringent note but not over the top. This is followed by a limited but flavorful caramel taste is noticeable in the background. Some minor sweetness into the finish with some hints of soapiness that lingers. A light yeast character but mostly clean.  The texture is a littled watery but good flavor and decent body. A creamy taste but the spice limits the texture.

Head is off-white, about 1/2"" thick with very fine bubbles and it appears to be sticking around.  Smell: huge hop nose, strong on floral and pine overtones, but clean and fresh, not earthy. A slight hint of lemon.  Taste: The floral and pine qualities come out immediately, resolving to a a very clean citrusy bitterness, more like lemon than grapefruit. I'm pretty sure this is some major Centennial hoppage, and I love it. Somewhere in the beginning/middle of the sip, there's just enough bready malt support to keep this from tasting like hop water. The rye comes out mainly as an aftertaste, but that's OK.  Mouthfeel: just the perfect amount of carbonation to bring the hop flavors alive on my tongue. The rye gives it one heckuva head retention; I feel like I'm getting a milk moustache here. Contributes to a nice full body without seeming too chewy.  Drinkability: though I tend to hit my hop limit after one IPA per session, I could come back for a few of these. A few... pints, that is. I dunno about these deuce-deuces.

Smelled of extremely intense floral and citrus hops with a predominating pine.  In the flavor, the only reason this intense hop experience is made tolerable is the fantastically paired rye crisp and grapenut-like malt that supports it. There are also some sweet marshmallow undertones to this beer. Then, this beer finishes with a bit of malty grapefruit and rye, that arguably had too much bite.

The rye is also present throughout the drink, but shows through best in the aftertaste. This is a nice and balanced DIPA. Mouth feel is medium bodied and moderately carbonated. The alcohol content is hidden quite well.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ChiSox05,4.06,"Poured mohogany with an inch tall head that just sat perched there the entire time. Tough lacing left a ring down the glass every sip, ending with bars of lacing after the beer was gone.  Citric hoppiness and a roasty rye in the nose.  On taste the hops are all over without hurting their own cause, on a small sip a sweet-tart juiciness wakes up the taste buds. Fairly easy on the mouth, alcohol is detectable, slightly bigger than medium bodied, rye and carbonation add spicy feel.  Different from other DIPA's, not as slick and oily. Head retention was amazing, great presentation by The Map Room. Just checked ABV, had no idea it was near 8%, could easily catch up with you because one isn't enough.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,masikon,4.97,"This beer is absolutely perfect if ever there was a perfect beer. I'm changing my favorite style to American Double IPA based on this. Pours a rich amber to mahogany with a rich sea foam head that lasts and clings everywhere. Nose is full of delicious citrus hops, some subdued candy malts and a slight alcoholic pepper. Taste is divine, a solid perfectly executed wall of hops slams the palate with grapefruit, zest, pineapple, and candy sweetness in the background...no foul grassyness or over the top bitterness here. Bear Republic has reminded me with this beer of why I love beer, a true masterpiece....im gushing...I can't say enough.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,connecticutpoet,4.5,"Dang! This is a clear, very red brew that forms a full four finger rocky head that left a LOT of lace on the sides of my pint glass. This stuff clings! When I was done, it didn't want to wash off readily.  Aroma was of pine hops and caramel, with a slightly sweet toffee character. There was definitely a bit of rye spiciness that nicely complimented the hops.  Taste was bitter pine and grapefruit hops, but not overpowering. medium-bodied malts were evident as an underlying theme, and the rye bite was definitely there. Quite nice and well-balanced. I see why it has the rating it does.  Mouthfeel was full and chewy, not as astringent as the high alpha acid content would lead one to believe, not oily even though there were obviously loads of hop resins. Damn fine.  Drinkability was up there. Without a doubt I would be willing to have this one again,",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Gavage,4.41,"Appearance: pours a clear deep copper color with a thick 3"" merangue-like head that lasts throughout the drink. Thick lacing also develops.  Smell: strong citrus and hop bitterness is easily detectable.  Taste: this beer covers it all, as a nice sweet malty backbone is kept in check with strong piney bitterness and fat orange slices. Hint of graininess and some brown sugar notes too.  Mouthfeel: crisp at the start and finish, with all flavors lingering on the tongue long into aftertaste. Slight dryness on the finish.  Drinkability: great drinkability, a must have for those who haven't had one yet.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Tupperwolf,4.58,"Pours from a 22oz bottle with no freshness date into my nonic a perfect impression of Coca-Cola dark red-brown. The more I drink, the redder it gets. The head on this thing is HUGE! Big frothy mountains of tan-white head burst upwards for long seconds, and very slowly settle down to a thick, complete covering that won't go away. As I drink this beer it leaves shelf after shelf of lace rings. So beautiful I want to cry!  The smell has distinct hop oils - grapefruit and pine, but they aren't so aggressive as most kick-ya-in-the-teeth double IPAs; Actually, they're kind of secondary to a sugarcane, saccharine sweetness. The overall effect gets my mouth watering hard.  Ah, there's those hops! They dance around on my tongue in a devilish samba, all piney and twangy and hoppy. Mmmm. I think the rye gives this beer a serious plus; It doesn't diminish from the hoppy taste, but adds so much sugary, malty smoothness. It still isn't aggressive, which is how I like an IPA, but damn if it isn't GOOD. I mean this beer tastes excellent. It keeps my mouth watering and I just can't help but dive back in for more! The second glass brings a level of additional spice and zing with the brewer's yeast that only adds more complexity. Mmm.  Slick on the tongue, with just enough carbonation to keep me happy - I'm glad it went to the head instead of sticking around in the body, because the flavors of this beer are accented by the amount of carbonation it has. Kind of a clingy hoppy hop-oil aftertaste that lingers and lingers. Mmm.  I put some pizza in the oven, intending to drink this beer with them when they were done, but in the ten minutes it took the pizza to cook, I drank the first 12oz like a greedy bastard and had to pour the rest of the bottle to have with my food. This beer deserves all the praise it's received! God Bless California!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Goban,4.28,It has a beautiful pour with a rich and thick creamy head. Head retention is great and leaves a wonderful lace sticking to the glass. The color is an appealing dark brown with a slight hint of red. It smells very hoppy with a sweet citrus background that is very inviting. A wonderfully rich mouthfeel that holds hoppy bitterness that lasts and lasts.  Hop Rod is my first brew by Bear Republic and Im sold already.

610,3158,hero27,4.85,"22 oz bomber. Listed 8% abv. Says on the bottle it's made with 18% rye...interesting.  Rapidly forming head of khaki foam. Mostly clear amber color. Elegant hop aroma.. floral hops are strong, but not overdone and won't take the paint off the walls like some hop aromas will. Very fresh, spicy hop flavors up-front that blend in ridiculously well with the earthy Crystal malt presence...quite smooth going down, also. Damn, this stuff's incredible...every flavor works in harmony, with the hops, malt, and rye doing their part to make one insane beer. This brew is the real deal.

Looks impressive.  Smell; has a really nice spicy rye aroma that I really enjoy, piney and slightly citrusy hops with just a hint of sweet caramel.  Taste; the piney hops hit first followed by that rye spiciness that just really stands out. A nice grapefruit flavor mixes in with a nice caramel malty presence on the finish that's really pleasant. For a DIPA this beer is not overly bitter. This beer has a nice and chewy mouthfeel, but has a little more of a carbonation bite to it that I would have liked. This is a truely ""outstanding"" beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,Shultzerdugen,4.5,"Brown bomber bottle.  Clear red/copper in color with a super irregular almost tan head. The froth was long lasting.  Assertive hops take over the nose, bringing out citrus notes like grapefruit, pineapple, and mandarin orange. Also the faintest whiffs of booze and malt.  Surprisingly full bodied, creamy, and well carbonated. Almost grainy. Hops come out to attack, bold and dominating, still along the citrus bent. Halfway through the glass the spiciness from the rye becomes apparent, adding real depth and enjoyment.  Bear Republic makes some damned fine beers, this one being no exception.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,IntriqKen,4.83,"Wow. Ok...I'll try to do this intelligently but I've had two 22 oz bottles and that may not be possible. Pours deep, deep brown...almost black. Heavenly head of sable color that stays with a pretty lacing throughout the drink. I smell grapefruit...probably the hops. Taste is heavenly....tingly hops with slight grapefruit aftertaste....wonderful blending of hops and malt...almost perfect. Nothing overpowers...just a heavenly blending. Light carbonation...high octane but no high burn going down.  I enjoyed this brew totally...maybe too much. In my mind this was 'the perfect beer'. Heavenly blending of malt and hops....aftertaste is clean and nice. If it was only half the alcohol I would drink a sixer...as it is, I may anyway and regret it tomorrow. My favorite. I'm inclined to give it 5's all over because I love it but will be honest in my ratings. EDIT: I had to make a note after finishing about my 10th of these (no...not at one sitting. This beer has the most incredible head I have ever seen in a beer. It is almost stiff in intensity and the entire two fingers will last through then entire drink. You litterally can sculpt the head of bubbles you will get with a pour all the way to the bottom of the glass.

610,3158,TheBungyo,4.88,"Ok, let's be honest here, this beer pours so damn dark, if it were just a few shades darker, it'd be black. Dark brown with ruby edges and a nice velvety dense head that fires off aroma at you. Hitting you from every angle ... pine, followed by grapefruit and then smooth caramel malt. A sip treats the tongue to initial bitterness followed by a whallop of pine and grapefruit. The malt smoothes things out followed by fleeting grain and an citrusy orange taste. Mouthfeel is big, which is just what I want in a brew like this. Your tongue will say yes to more and more of this but beware, with an 8% ABV, respect is in order. The only Double IPA I've had that can even try to stand up to this is Hercules by Great Divide. Even then though, I wouldn't be shocked to see the mighty Hercules fall. This brew is that tough.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Not like any other Double IPA I have ever had. It is slightly piney. Behind the somewhat weak hop aroma, I detect a malty caramel like aroma. It also has a nice crisp citrus aroma.  This beer has a mild hop flavor. It is not overpowering at all. It has a slight malty flavor also. It is balanced very well. It has a slight spicy rye flavor.  This beer goes down very smooth, leaving a slight hoppy aftertaste. It has a very creamy mouthfeel to it. The carbonation is just right.  This beer would make a good session beer if the alcohol content was a bit lower. It is at 8%, so it might be hard to dring this beer all night, but with the mild, non aggressive flavor, I might just have to have another one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

The hop's smell does not let much else through. This beer smells wonderful. This is a great tasting beer. The first part is all piney hops and as it fads the rye comes in. The rye really gives this beer a good taste. The aftertaste is nicely bittered, but not a whole lot of malt to balance. The mouthfeel is a little thin for a beer this big, but the drinkability is stellar.

The rye flavor really suprised me, as I expected nothing more than hops, hops, and more hops. Quite delicious.  Body is solid for the style. Nice and full, with a slight creaminess to it.

This starts with its beautiful appearance, the color of which is very dark amber. A huge tan head forms that never really completely disappears. Instead, it just gets rockier and rockier unitl it looks like a snow covered mountain top. The lacing is so thick, you can't see through it. The aroma is very strong full of a gloriously resinous hoppiness, obviously from the Pacific Northwest. The taste picks this up and a beautiful, but never harsh, hoppiness asserts itself. This is supported by a very nice malt base that keeps it from becoming too harsh. The rye begins to come through towards the finish and gives this beer a unique character when compared to other IPAs. The mouthfeel is great, nice and thick and chewy. The drinkability is dangerous at 8%. As I've already said, this is a superb beer that packs a punch from start to finish.

The aroma is strong pine hops but the dry smell is definately the rye. The rye isn't that strong but i like it. Same goes for the taste. Pine trees and rye. To me this tastes very similar to racer 5 when it comes to bitterness, maybe even less flavor. But it seems more well rounded and interesting. A coarse tasting beer that is still pleasant.

610,3158,HardTarget,4.26,"Bottle Inspection: 8% abv, 18% Rye, seasonal brew.  Aroma: Hop! A classic west coast citric hop goodness with a hint of rye and some sugary malt base all come together for a great package.  Appearance: Just gorgeous. A copper, amber, ruby glass crowned with a clumpy tan, slightly red head that fades slowly leaving great loops of lace as it fades.  Flavor: Hop on Pop! Rich hop flavor but backed by a rich malt base. The rye comes out nicely. The overall taste is that of sugared hops, a great blending of basic beer goodness.  Mouthfeel: Serious chew in a heavy mouthfeel. Perfect carbonation level, lively yet low, and a dry, slightly oily hoppy finish that lasts for days.  Overall Impression: Serious brew; a nice double IPA with a great dose of rye. I have even more respect for the great bear now.

Some sweetness in there too and just a touch of earthiness that may or may not be the rye.  Appearance: A deep, slightly cloudy crimson brew with a gorgeously rocky tan head and excellent lacing.  Taste: The hops are there and come out in full force. The citrus is there, but balcned well by sweet tastes of caramel & malt, and, what's this? There *is* rye in my beer. I'm convinced the earthy smell I picked up on is in fact the rye and the unique taste it brings to this brew. Like someone put a few drops of pumpernickel essence in here. Fantastic interplay between the hops & grains goes on for a while.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with modest carbonation & a silky feel to it.  Drinkability: A very entertaining brew.

Pours a dark garnet/mahogany color with a few fingers of tan, rocky head with some good lacing and retention. On my second pour a film of rubbery-looking yeast plopped into my glass, kinda strange. Looks more like a scotch ale to me. Nose is strong, rich floral/piney hops with sweet tropical fruit notes. Taste starts off with a hearty pine-hop kick but as it warms transitions into caramel malt, sweet pineapple, apricot and citrus. A faint rye bitterness can be detected but I wouldn't have guessed there was rye in it without the name. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. This is a highly drinkable DIPA, the alcohol is well-hidden. Nice balance between sweet malty/fruity and bitter hops here. Another winner from Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Smell wasn't that distinctive - fruity and malty, with only a subtle hop sense. Tasted pretty much how it smelled, but was really enjoyable. I don't think I've ever left a beer in my mouth as long as this. I just couldn't bring myself to swallow it. Definitely taste the rye, along with some citrus flavors. Highly drinkable for a DIPA, which may perhaps be because the alcohol content isn't that high for the style.  N.B.

Very dark amber, nearly opaque, just a bit of light gets through. Great, beautiful lacing.  Smell = Strong, intense pine hops. Almost too dominating as it smells like a bottle of Pinesolve cleaner. It's clean and refreshing though.  Taste = bitter, tough, testy tasting DIPA. Hops dominate as expected. It's a bit raw and course but the pine hops are well played. Not much citrus here and not much malt either. I can't really taste the rye very well. I do enjoy the clean, brisk taste but wish it had a bit more complexity. I feel like the pine hops just dominate everything.  Overall = I'm glad I got to try this. The head and lacing is absolutely gorgeous and it's one of the better looking IPAs I've ever seen.

A distinct rye twinge goes right to the nose. Gummy caramel malts underneath. Enticing.  Even in a year+ old bottle this beer remains very hop-forward. Rye malt takes a supporting role adding tartness to the strong bitterness.  Addictively dry, with lingering bitterness that makes you crave more. And more. And more.

Now you taste me, now you don't.  M - A little watery, but ultra sharp from the carbonation. It gives it a spritzer tingle.  D - A slower drinker, for me at least.

The hops ultimately rule the profile, but there is a very noticeable malt presence. There is a pretty grainy aroma that I would guess is the rye.  Taste: This is a really nice beer. You can pick out the rye, but there is a complete enough malt balance to make it taste really appropriate.

Nice bitter hop scent with citrus smells.  Pretty smooth at first, the bitter hop finish really doesn't kick in until the very end. Very nice, rather thick.

The taste is very hoppy with tonnes of juicy citrus character and herbaceous hop leaf. The wall of hops is well balanced by a sweet maltiness. Possibly its 'hop sweetness' Im tasting.

Orange comes to mind with a hint of grapefruit in the background. Perhaps it is a blend of the hops and sweetness of the malt that provide this exquisite aroma.  First sip echoes the citris hops at first, but soon gives way to the dry, spicy rye. The sweet caramel dark crystal malt fights its way in there as well lending a perfect foundation. Finish is long, bitter, and dry. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. When I poured the rest of the bomber into my pint glass, the head made it seem as though I was drinking a milkshake. Very full.  A very satisfying brew, a very different IIPA in a very good way. This is one to keep in constant supply. Be careful- this does weigh in at 8%ABV, but I would never know it from the taste and the smooth way it seems to fly down my throat.

610,3158,NearerMyBeerToMe,4.34,"Thick, creamy head rushes up the sides of the glass on the pour... it's huge! I stick a finger into the densely honeycombed bubbles, and they actually ooze upwards along my finger... not the kind of behavior you expect from a beer operating under the normal constraints of physical law. Beer is very dark in color--almost mahogany--with highlights of glowing auburn, copiously streaked through by steady-rising lines of carbonation. From the bottle I smell fresh papaya, but out of the glass this just reeks of hops. Nosefeel is fragrant and arid, with a framework of dried-out hops; dry leaves and berries; and piney, aromatic, sage-like herbs. The flavors seem almost entirely free of sweetness. Pumpernickel bread and cedar blend with an array of dried spices, everything held together by spicy seed-oils. Hop bitterness penetrates deeply but melts away with perfect timing, dissolving into a finish of beeswax and clover that absolutely fills the mouth. The rye element has just made things so, soooo smooth. Drinkability is off the fucking hook. I've had three bombers of this in my life, and I'm pretty sure not one of them has lasted much longer than ten minutes. Yum.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,mattcrill,4.12,Compliments of BIF 16.  Appearance: Pours a crystal clear amber brown with a tan head. Little yeast floaties noted throughout the body.  Smell: Nice citrus and bittering hop aroma. A touch of alcohol and malt sweetness but dominated by a strong hop presence.  Taste: Rye bitterness up front followed quickly by a citrus and bitter hop splash. The rye base is noted throughout as it leaves a bready and dry taste on the palate. It's nicely balanced by the strong and dominating hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and chewy.  Drinkability: A very well balanced and enjoyable beer. I could drink this all day. Strongly recommended.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Litterbean,4.03,"A bold looking beer. Very dark red, with brownish hues and a bumpy off-white head that looks very dense.  The hops hit the nose first, but beyond that there is a sweet sugary character as well. The rye is also noticeable, as there are bready hints within.  Taste is sweet and hoppy, well balanced. Notes of citrusy hops along with a bready malt taste. One of the finer double IPAs I have tasted. Very delicious, and smooth, and quite a warming up beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,texashammer,4.5,"Wow. I'm very impressed. Beautiful brown with ruby tones; when held to light shows ruby red with fine suspended sediment. Head is thin but resilient; upon swirling it is huge and fluffy with beautiful small bubbles and boy, does the smell come out! Floral and bitter hops, caramel, heady alcohol. The hops clear my sinuses. I taste mellow bitter hops and rye spiciness. Full body, rich smooth and spicy mouthfeel. Finish is long, bitter and dry, and very tasty. I just can't get enough. So full and rich. An extremely drinkable beer. I just can't get enough. I've only ever had two rye beers but judging from these two, I like rye in my beer a great deal. Also I love my hops and this scratches my itch. Yum.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

No freshness info.  Appearance: Pours a very dark red - almost brown with a nice head that has great staying power. Small amounts of visible sediment.  Smell: Aroma is very powerful - lots of hops and malt both. The hops come on first - thick and piney. Then the malt makes an appearance with a slightly sweet smell. Just a hint of grain in there too.  Taste: Medium bodied with low carbonation. The hops definitely dominate here, leaving a nice bitter finish. Lots of thick piney hop flavor in the start, and then the malt helps balance it out a little bit. Slightly sweet towards the end, with that special kick I've only tasted in rye beers.  Overall impression: Definitely one of a kind - this is a great DIPA with a nice added twist from the rye. Definitely worth a try - it may become a staple!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,orfeu,4.26,"Pours a dark rubyish brown with a substantial and dense tan head (settles at about 3/4""). Sticky sticky lacing. Smells malty sweet with nascent hops, caramel apples... The first sip: wow! didn't expect malt like that. There's an incredible balance here with the hops bringing up the back end, but that malt sweetness is right there up front. And mind you, it's not an out-of-place sweetness. The hops are definitely there, but I'm a bit surprised that they're not beating my palate up and down the block as the name and label description led me to believe. This is not a bad thing, though. If I can't quite accept the characterization of this beer as a hoppy monster, that still doesn't prevent me from enjoying it immensely. In the mouth this one is nice and chewy, with a full, creamy body. Damn if that 8% abv is not hidden better than those magical Iraqi wmds. All in all, even though I am more of a hop-head than anything, this brew is definitely one of the best DIPAs I've yet to come across.

Big hop aroma slaps you across the face, it's Piny, citrusy and delicious. Thick, full mouthfeel, slightly slick across the top of the mouth. Sweet malt taste balances the big hop taste and bitterness. Lots grapefruit taste and a nice clean bitterness. Good stuff.

The bouquet is dominated by bitter citrus peel but also has very light notes of floral pollen. Starts big and waxy and finished dry and crisp, though slightly alcoholic.

The beer has aromas of malt, alcohol, citrus fruit and sugar. The taste is extremely dry with a really nice hop punch.

Smell is tremendous, I would give it a 4.9 if possible. Hops Hops Hops, sweet Floral, citrus grapefruit, I love it. Very little malt smell which is fine by me.  Taste is great, nice sweet malt flavor balances the hops nicely, citrusy grapefruit taste abundant with dry after taste  Mouthfeel is bubbly at first and then goes bready and then dry at the end  Drinkability is of course great.

More of an apple/pineapple aroma rather than a citrus one.  Taste: This is not your typical double IPA. It's much sweeter than I expected. It has wonderful balance. Plenty of IBU's to satisfy even the most hardened hophead, yet the finish is malty and is much sweeter than other DIPA's I've tried. A rye flavor showed up so long after the sip that it surprised me.

610,3158,wedge,4.18,"Pours a dark translucent brown with noticable sediment on the bottom. Huge frothy off-white head with a light, lasting lacing. Smells of spicy hops and slight alcohol with sharp rye accents. Taste is not overly hoppy at first but gets pretty damn hoppy with time...not overpowering...but appropriately so for a double IPA. Dark malts are present as is light alcohol. Mouthfeel is full and sticky, dry. Good to the last drop...I was satisfied.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Nice and juicy citrus hop aroma, and a grainy aspect which adds complexity to the beer. Taste was nice and hoppy all around, but there was also a nice balance, between light toasty malt, and a dry, chewy, rye side to this beer. Full mouthfeel. A very nice IIPA, the rye gives this a different feeling to it, and really hides the 8%.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,tastybeer,4.33,"Pours a deep warm mahogany color with an unyeilding creamy tan head. Really nice retention. Looks great. Smells like a hoppy evergreen forest combined with flowers and oranges, and hints of rye. Taste is real crisp at first, followed by a huge wave of hops, that flows into a big malty sensation, ending in spices and citrus bitterness. There is some alcohol taste that mixes well with the hops and maltiness. This beer brings the idea of an IPA ocean to my head. Really hoppy and feels great in your mouth too. Drinkability is good but it is so ultra hoppy that after a couple I'd probably have something else.  Another great double IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Taste is pretty similar to the aroma, only much much better. Bitter hops, caramel, very slight chocolate, and a bit of smokiness. Rye dominates, but is well balanced with the hops. Strong flavors abound but never really get out of hand. No alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is very good for such a strong flavored beer, not slick or overly oily. Overall, a very very good beer.

Of course there is a huge hop presence, but there is more as well. Citrus and piney hops hit you first, but there is a presence of rye bread after the hops kick your tongue with full force.

But by then my palate was so ruined from the chipotle glazed chicken wings that I had to have it again to get its full effect (and certainly to review it)!  I love the color of this beer. Ruby and brown with a creamy tan head. Excellent retention. Lots of hop bitterness in the aroma but the rye gives it a terrific sweetness. The flavor is amazing. Tons of hops, yet there is definitely some balance there with the malts as well. And the rye just gives it a sensational sweet flavor. The body is medium to full with a thick, creamy texture. Awesome! As delicious as it was, it didn't leave me craving for another one, but it certainly satisfied, and I wouldn't argue with someone if they put another one down in front of me.

Bigass pungent hop aroma that lets you know exactly what you are getting into. Hop character here is totally off the hook. ""Dual overhead hop injection"" indeed. Extremely floral, piney, citric, and bitter, with the rye significantly adding to the spicy kick and only minimal sweetness from the malts. Rye and hop aftertaste lasts seemingly forever.

Great label design and name. Hop ROD Rye.  Bear Republic is becoming one of my favorite breweries and this is another fine example of the attention they pay to detail.  Head is perfect with thick lacing. Dark Cherry color. It's already on the christmas list. Like most IPA's its quite hoppy but the key is they control it a bit and the rye edge is outstanding. The rye adds a bit of depth but it was an afterthought at best. The true heart of this beer is like any other IPA and DIPA its in the hop flavor and bitterness. This is amazingly hopped up but yet still has enough malt character to keep it somewhat in check. Apricot comes to mind, citrusy and plenty of hop oils to slicken things up. Surprisingly it finishes fairly clean although it was a bit oily. Every drink was enjoyable. Highly reccomend this beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Tan in color over a crystal clear brown liquid with ruby and blood red notes. Smells mild and clean citrus hoppy. Grapefruit pith and tangerine. Toasted grains. Tastes, whoa...gentle to start. Sweet with strong apricot and malt over a rising hop flavor and bitter. Lupulin is stronger than co-humulone for the hops and it's really mouthfeel creamy smooth. Caramel is found deep beneath, but there is also a malty zing that fights the hoppy grapefruit pith. Mouthfeel is md-thick and carbonation is mild (but stingy).

610,3158,ithacabaron,3.8,"Pours a very dark, deep amber ...really, deeper than what should be described as amber, but good all the same. Soapy head on top that sticks around for the party.  Smell is a nice mix of Maris Otter, 2-Row, Caramel Malt, and a slightly cloying aroma that reminds me of those old red and green barley sugar popcicles that my grandmother used to hand out. Must be the rye. Hops are there, but a bit in the background, surprisingly, smothered under the malt sweetness. Not bad.  Taste is a much brighter attack of hops, a few alcohol flashes, and a good depth of sweet malt. Oddly enough, the ratio of hops to malt at the start of the bomber leans towards the green stuff, but swings decidedly in the other direction by the end. That may be related to the mouthfeel, however (see below).  Mouthfeel is very unusual, almost a bit slimy -- a characteristic I've ran into with other rye beers. A characteristic or not, I can tell you that I don't care for it. Interesting, but it adds another layer of sweetness that I, as someone who lacks any resemblence of a sweet tooth, doesn't appreciate.  Drinkability is decent. No problem finishing the bomber, but I don't think I would have ordered another pint at a bar.  All in all, a decent rye beer, but I would have liked it if the hops were shown off a little more, and the sweetness was toned down (either by adjusting the malt bill, or increasing yeast attenuation, although I doubt that's the problem).

Pours a deep amber, almost crimson color with a big three-finger beige foamy head. The head takes its time falling, and leaves a very thick frothy lacing. Solid retention. Aroma is very hoppy, strong citrus hints, particularly grapefruit. The grassy aroma from the rye is slightly evident behind the hops. Taste is crisp, strong grapefruit-type citrus hop, thick amber malt and a hint of the rye flavor compliments the malt nicely. Bitterness persists at the back of the tongue, but not too strongly. Despite a visibly active carbonation, that's only slightly felt in the mouthfeel. Makes it feel a little more creamy than perhaps i had anticipated. Overall very enjoyable. Will certainly try again. The rye works well to give the brew a little different character.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Plus I had to wait out a unintentionally rough pour. All my nose picks up is hops. But that's a wonderful thing. Taste is a citrusy hop paradise that cools off at the last moment into a easy drinking sweetness. I don't have experience with rye as an ingredient in anything but bread, so I can only say this COULD be attributed to the 18% rye. In any case, this is a great one.

Hop Rod had a deep coppery color, mucho carbonation, and a thick, creamy vanilla-colored head that never even started to die. At the bottom of the pint was a thick carpet of foam and the glass walls were smeared with thick sheet lace. Gorgeous looking brew! The nose had a nice even balance between soft caramel malt notes and the harder, pine-laden hops aroma. Funny, the hops aromas aren't really that potent compared to when I tasted it. Very enticing. Whoa, big-time hops! I mean, BIG hops. Moderately sweet caramel drizzled malts and fruit flavors which only briefly stem the onrushing tide of sticky, resinous, sappy hops oils. Hoppy bittering simply pervades every crevice of the palate, leaving a long hops flavor lingering on the tongue and producing some tremendously satisfying hops burps. Abundant carbonation gives Hop Rod a lush, full feel. Boy, am I glad my nearest pub started carrying Bear Republic! Hop Rod Rye on tap is fantastic in all aspects.

I really like the intensity of the caramel malt. The flavor is very big. Sweet caramel hits first followed by sweet juicy hops, finishing with a spicey rye. The bitterness is not too intesne, but lingers very well into the finish. Very enjoyable. The feel is incredibly thick and chewy, almost a touch syrupy. I dig it. Like some body on my DIPA's. 8% alcohol is nowhere to be found in this one. Its really doing good for me on this humid and rainy summer day. Big flavor and nose that leaves a great aftertaste.

610,3158,whartontallboy,4.21,"This is a beautiful beer. Pours into a chalice with a dark copper color and a huge foamy off-white head that recedes at a glacial pace and leaves a ton of lace. The only other brew I've had that looked this pretty lately was the Bear Republic Racer 5. Beautiful.   Smell is hoppy and piney with a little hint of the rye, but it's light. The 8% alcohol comes through in there, too.  Taste keeps up the good work. There's a pretty obvious rye flavor in here, especially in the finish and aftertaste. However, what comes through more clearly are the hops, which is nice and expected for a DIPA. The malt sticks in pretty nicely, and the rye twists it in such an interesting spicy way that really reinforces the bite of the hops.  Mouthfeel is medium, smooth, and creamy. The hops are incredibly aggressive and present, but this is an excellent DIPA with an interesting quirk from the rye.

Pours to a very dark brown, only slightly ruby colored liquid with a massive fluffy white head that coats the entire circumference of the glass in a perfect frilly Victoria's Secret crotchless panty-style lacing. She really is quite sexy looking.  Smells freshly dry-hopped with what seems to be amarillo hops. The taste isn't mind bogglingly explosive and complex, but it's one of my favorite hop smells. Also has a bit of a deep malty smell to it, though well hidden under the hop profile.  The rye malt really shows through in the taste, just as in the appearance. Has a bit of a mild roasty bitterness to the malt flavor paired with a chronic amarillo hop taste. The bitterness and sweetness are quite evenly matched, though the bitterness has the upper hand in the finish (it seems to be the rye malt rather than the citrusy hops that produce this effect).  The mouthfeel is good. Not creamy, not harsh. The alcohol is quite well hidden. Quite smooth. If not for the high alcohol content, I wouldn't consider this a double IPA as much as I would label it a single.  I would probably be able to drink quite a bit of this, but at 8% I'm wary of labeling it as a sessionable brew, much less because this beer is not available in my locale.

Big grapefruit hops assault the tongue upfront, giving way to a grainy rye maltiness, and fading into a wonderful linger piney hop aftertaste.

Served chilled and then poured into my new Unibroue tulip glass.  Pours a mahogany with rich amber highlights. Hearty and frothy off white head stayed forever and left excellent lacing on the glass. Slightly hazy.  A real noseful, with a rich mix of molasses, alcohol, and pine hops. The aromas change as you continue to inhale. Really hard not to dive right in.  Rich, full flavored and medium to heavy mouthfeel brew. Heavy and hearty roasted malts are tossed around with a perfect mix of grapefruit and pine hops. Slight alcohol warmth and a little rye spiciness  Lingering sweet/bitter mix in the mouth. Very drinkable even though it is chewy as all hell.

610,3158,sponberg,4.7,"Here's to great beer stores like Glenville Beverage, who have this on tap on a semi-regular basis. Pours a dark reddish-amber with a tight cream colored head that laces down the rest of the pint. Aroma of resiny, citrus rind hops over a backdrop of sweet fruity malt and a distinct rye bread fresh from the oven spiciness. Mmm...  This is almost two different beers in one pint: pour it straight from a fridge-temp growler and the bountiful hops grab the tongue and give it a good shakedown before the fruity, toasted-rye maltiness comes in to pick up the spare change and cufflinks - they're there, but the beer is decidedly hopcentric. But...  Let it warm up for a few minutes, to say 45 or 50 degrees. Then everything kicks into gear at the same time and the results are astounding. From the sip, aggressive hops still try to rough up the tongue but now the rye spicy-graininess is standing alongside, carrying a Thompson submachinegun of dry caramel and fruit maltiness and faint distant warming alcohol. It's all there in one sip. I just love this beer. Finishes with a distinctive ""really good rye bread"" aftertaste with trailing notes of citrus rind, the Kordite smoke of maltiness still present in the tastebuds. Just chewy enough. Far too drinkable.  Simply an outstanding brew - if this is your local, consider yourself lucky.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,blitz134,4.33,"A very nice looking DIPA. A voluminous two finger off white head that went down to a lumpy mass. Laced the glass well. Body was a deep caramel. Mostly transparent but some floaters hanging around.  Aroma is citrus and a bit of pine. A light rye bread flavor works its way in there as well. Taste is balanced well between a good general hop flavor and the rye. Finishes dry like most rye beers but is complimented with some juicy hops. These two factors are probably why I like Rye Ales so much. They always seem to have the best of both worlds in them: dry but still juicy, hoppy but balanced with the rye. Hops have a touch of citrus and dry bitter resin flavors. Some good sweet malts in there as well. Very tasty and very well crafted.  Mouthfeel isn't exactly where I would like it. I would like to see it be a bit thicker. It does coat well though and the flavors linger for a while. A slight amount of carbonation makes this refreshing. Drinkability is pretty amazing with the nicely blended flavor profiles and the lighter feel.

Lacing is as thick as sea-foam with moderate head retention. A thin veil of head will remain till' the end.  The aromas...wow. I get a nosefull before I even get my nose close to the goblet. Melted pine sap poured over fresh baked honey biscuits. Deep, resiny, pungent, biting hops dominate the nose. There's a good measure of scorched caramel malt notes to provide balance. I'm in!  The flavor begins with a sweet hint of toasted caramel and brittle English toffee. It is quickly washed away by a sea of liquified pine sap with dried grapefruit peels floating in it. Hop glory. There's a spicey, woody, almost earthy feel to it provided by the rye. It reminds me of Aquavitt, a Norwegan liquor flavored w/ carraway seeds. The finish is long and ferociously hoppy. Smiles all around. Alcohol is well hidden by a mask of unrelenting hops.  The body is big, make that huge. Mouthfeel is thick, viscous, and absolutely chewy. If this were sweeter and maltier, it would be a barleywine. As it is, it stands out amongst the crowd. A joy to drink, I savor every sip.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,goschool,4.83,"The creamy off-white to orange head atop its deep, dark and cloudy copper-red body releases huge pine aroma. The first sip is fantastically ferocious. The rye adds a tangy and spicy flavor that's reminiscent of bourbon. This brew is very hoppy, with rye and a wee bit of malt (sweet toffee/caramel flavors are in here they're just a little shy and intimidated by the hops) to make this so complex. This stuff is super drinkable; I feel like I could finish a keg of this by myself- I'd sure like to try.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,DrJay,4.85,"Hazy, toffee/red colour topped by a thick, fluffy, off-tan head. Excellent retention and stickage that leaves a very thick lace on the glass. I could smell hops as soon as I started pouring the beer. Plenty of citrus and floral hop aroma, to the point of being perfumy due to quantity. Malt is in there as well, a little bready, with an almost gingerbread quality that also shows up in the flavour. Complex hop flavours that are in balance with each other and are absolutely amazing. Grapefruit hop flavour is present all the way through, with a bit of pine resin, some hop spice, and orange. Maltiness is slightly grainy and quite drying. Assertive bitterness, just short of aggressive, that balances very well with the malt. Long, dry, bitter finish. Full bodied with medium carbonation and a rich, creamy texture. This is really, really good beer. The combination of rye with the high hopping rate works very well.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ZAP,4.5,Brilliant ruby red color..perfect 1/4 inch creamy off-white head...nice citrus/leafy nose...body is medium-full...firm...I love the use of rye in beers and this unique application works wonders in this hopped up effort....the rye really adds a unique malt backbone...spicy rye bread dabbed in grapefruit juice....  Hops are big but remain balanced in this....mainly citrus but some leafy/tobacco like notes too...finishes dry  A heck of a nice effort here...unique....and loaded with flavor....quality stuff,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Brewfan,4.53,"22 oz bomber. 8% ABV. Beautiful tan fluffy cotton head upon pouring. Head will reappear throughout the live of this beer with a little swirl. Dark reddish-mahogany color. Thick lace proceeded to cling to the glass like the mynocks to the the Millenium Falcon in the ""cave"" in Empire Strikes Back. Steady stream of bubbles rise to the surface the entire time I'm drinking this. Hops upon very dominant upon opening, and continue to dominate the entire time, but make way for rye and grapefruit aromas. Very well balanced aroma. Heavy mouthfeel stays with you well into the next sip. I actually think I may have a 1/8 inch layer of hops on my tongue by the end of my bottle. Mid level corbonation. Glorious hoppiness on the tongue, but a well balanced malty sweetness is there as well. Bitter, but not too bitter. Hoppy, but not too hoppy. Sweet, but....well, you get the point. Very well balanced. Some pine and citrus thrown in to boot. Not for the beginning hop head. I wouldn't have liked this 3 years ago. But now is a different story.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,unklesyd,4.09,"I've had this a few times on tap at the Horse Brass, this is the first time from a bottle.  The thing that I noticed more than the wonderful dry hop aroma coming from the head on this thing was that it was so ridiculously huge! It was amusing at first, but was annoying in that it prevented a full-on pour and created a pretty unsightly merangue-foam hybrid on top of the beer.  The taste was obviously highly hopped and dry, but interesting hits of dry malt that faded quickly. Really nice, though, that this was not an undertone, nor was it cloying or sweet in the least.  Nice medium/light body, very drinkable indeed. The ABV encourages drinking and discourages gorging! Nice work.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,fizzyfred,4.02,"This beer pours an almost grayish brown color with a nice small head. Lots of hops aroma, grassy and citrusy. The taste is unique in that the hops way out in front but it still has some balance. The rye really gives the beer that dry base that accentuates the hop flavor. It tastes light in your mouth with a slight hop bitterness on the way down. As intense as this beer is, it is well crafted all around.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,rhoadsrage,3.97,(Served in an American pint glass)  A- This beer pours a deep amber slightly hazy body with strong carbonation and a thick creamy light tan head.  S- Nice citrus hop aroma with a bit of grassiness. A hint of spicy malt finishes the smell.  T- Nice creamy maltyness with a powerful bitter grapefruit hoppiness that has some resins and pine notes. Also a nice pepper spiciness that adds to the burst of hop flavor.  M- Creamy mouthfeel with a slight astringency at the finish but very faint. No alcohol warmth noted.  D- This is a big hop monster with a great creaminess and nice spiciness from the rye. It is well balanced malt and rye that gives a backbone to the great hops. I'm glad this comes in a bomber cause a 12 oz would be to small.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Higravity,3.55,"Kind of a shrug beer for me. It is a beer of almost and could a been. I have had several well done Rye beers and this one lacks the Rye punch and the hops seem mis-matched for the spicyness as they were fruity and bitter but not spicy. The alcohol also comes through a little to much. I let the bottle warm up more and the rye come out a little more but mostly it is just an after taste. The malty body is nice and thick though but a little too high on the carbonation. A decent Rye beer, but it almost could been better.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,oggg,4.42,"On tap at Fathers Office in Santa Monica, CA  This beer is brown with auburn tints at the edges. The head is tan-brown and very fluffy. The aroma of citrus and pine hops is pretty good, and then you get a little spicy rye. Carbonation perfect, followed by solid hop bite. Dang this beer is bitter even after all the other dIPAs I've had lately. Pine and juicy citrus hop flavor is huge. The rye gives a wheaty feel to the malt, as well as a little spiciness that just goes perfect. Full bodied and smooth. Just a touch oily at the finish.  Overall: Excellent dIPA in its own right, the rye just makes it even better.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,weeare138,4,"Appears as a ruby/copper vivacious brew with some small bubbles creating a small off white head which fades shortly. It looks pretty good! In fact, it's almost excellent with the exception of the heavy heavy sediment and lack of carbonation after about a minute. The lacing is lovely as it leaves a nice perfect ring which lasts for most of the duration of enjoying this brew. Smells of faint maltiness with some amarillo hops coming through, along with a faint nutiness. The taste is pretty decent as it hits most of tastebuds up in the front and the middle and the dryness lingers all the way to the back. Not a real full bodied mouthfeel but it is up there as far as filling it out. It is also quite drinkable. Again, the only thing that I didn't really like about this well done brew was the heavy sediment and the lack of carbonation.  Finger licking good!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,canucklehead,4.88,"As the immortal Kinky Friedman would say"" Killer B baby"". This is one of the best beers I've had in some time mainly because the complexity is stunning. The beer looks awesome with a dark brown body with a bi old head. A hoppy, woody smell with some interesting age notes. The taste is large and many facets. A unique bitterness due to the rye comes off the back end. All in all this is a stunner that demands your attention.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,cracker,4.04,"An interesting beer. Pours an amber brown color (a bit darker than most ipa's) with not much of a head. Smell is of fresh pine and grapefruit with a hint of sweet malts. Taste is definitely hop predominant (chinook hops more than likely) with a dry, somewhat harsh, astringest aftertaste. I'm assuming this is what rye contributes to the beer. Don't notice much of a spiciness or sour like characteristics. Overall seems more like a 'darker' ipa than anything else but nevertheless a quality product.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,beveragecaptain,4.5,"22 ounce bomber. This beer has a dark brown appearance, unusual for an IPA. Big foamy white head that leaves loads of lacing on the glass. The aroma is very hoppy, but not just a hop bomb. There are nice malt and spicy aromas too. The flavor is fresh hops, but balanced with the malt and a noticable rye. Very interesting, complex flavors. Creamy mouthfeel. High alcohol, but not in an overwhelming way, just gives the beer a nice bite. This is a well made and delicious hoppy beer. I think this is the fastest I ever drank an 8% abv 22 ounce bottle.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,shirfan,4.28,"A rich, dark orange with hints of brown; the head on this billowed up to 3-fingers in height and then simply refused to disperse. After several minutes, it finally yielded slightly, with clingy lace and fluffy mounds still remaining.  Aroma is citric, caustic hops, orange chocolate, alcohol, candy store, incense.  Taste is fairly dry, with grapefruit-toned hops guarding an earthy, voluptuous malt body. Enough hops to decimate the unappreciative, yet well balanced and not at all one-dimensional.  A slick and seductive ""you want me but you can't quite have me"" mouthfeel teases for subsequent sips. It's as if the full flavor of this beer is always just out of reach.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

610,3158,goodbyeohio,4,"pours crimson and fizzy with a light tan head of substance and character.  aroma is dangerously overwhelming with hops. mild buttery notes, but nothing can compare to the almighty hop gods making their presence known through the neck of this bottle.  tastes hoppy. bitter. mouth-puckering. the appeal to this beer is the rye background, which gives the hops a much higher ground to attack from. rye itself contributes a base spice here which launches my taste buds into orbit. and then a blueberry note.. from where? a hophead's delight.  i've sometimes been adverse to crazy hops but the complexity here helps me to appreciate it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,crookedhalo,4.32,"Pours a nice rich copper color with a fluffy light beige head. Piny, sprucy and citrusy in its hop profile with a caramelized malt notion and, of course, a dry rye character. Hints of holly. Incredibly dry, hoppy and citrusy. The usage of rye really accompanies the dryness imparted by the high alpha hops. Very dry and bitter; with some caramelized malt, counterbalancing rye, and a dextrinous mouthfeel. Very enjoyable. A beefy beer for lovers of the hop.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ALESwhatCURESya,3.98,"$3.49 22oz bomber  I took the cap off of this one and my mouth was watering to get a taste of the hop juices that filled this bottle. The appearance was gorgeous. A deep amber color with a sticky, cream head. The head alone, was delicious. The smell was a little different than many other IIPA. The rye aroma really stuck out and gave a different nose to the prominent hops. The taste was started out with a little sweetness followed by the crucial hop bitterness. The finish brought back almost and orange sweetness followed by a dry ending. The hops suck out every drop of saliva you have left in your mouth. It is great, but would be a little too much all night. Either way, this is an awesome beer that could become a staple in my fridge.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,sulldaddy,3.77,"I am sampling a bomber at room temp poured into a snifter. The beer pours a deep garnet color with a large soft fluffy off white head foaming up 2 cm on a slightly agressive pour. The head fades very slowly throughout sampling. Aroma is very hoppy, a nice mix of pine, grapefruit and earthy scents mix to give a solid hop presence. Not too much else on the nose. First sip reveals a rather thin body with a creamy texture that coats my palate. Very fine rolling carbonation tingles across the back of my throat. Flavor is light malt up front with a hint of caramel and some rye flavor, like reuben bread. Finishes slightly twangy with a hint of the hops that were on the nose. Mostly the hop bitterness hits the back of my moutgh after I swallow. The beer is easy to drink and gives no hint of alcohol anywhere. Quite an interesting mix of grains. Good but not a WOW! beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,lackenhauser,4.56,"Very nice amber to deep orange color. Second helping out of the bottle had a killer head to it. Great big grassy,citrusy aroma-we are talking full frontal hop assault. Nice mild sweet malt flavor with a huge hop presence. Very tangy indeed. Somewhat dry in the finsh. Good body-has a tad of a ""soapiness"" feel to it. A killer beer indeed. Very crisp yet full of flavor. At 8% I dont know if I would call it a session beer but I could see it becoming a regular in my fridge.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,studentofbeer,4.5,"dark, rich brown color with orange highlights. prettier at the top of my nonic, where it is a full woody brown but it looks like a nice piece of oak throughout. excellent dart-cork colored head, thick and and fluffy, with awesome lacing, and a nice cap that doesn't go away.  amazing bouquet of hops--super ripe and juicy grapefruit, tangerine smell. though it's hard to get past the hops, they are so full, there's a creamy, milky sweetness in the malt and some raw grain aroma. As it warms some spicy plum and nutmeg become apparent. very rich, with both dark and bright flavors mingling.  the taste is a full on assault of goodness--a boatload of hops truck through the mouth, but the ale is so creamy and the malt so smooth, sweet and spicy, you're getting a little of everything. i pick up dried fruit, obviously tons of citrus, milk and milk chocolate, peach, some sour rye (like rye whisky) and a touch of pepper. the hops come barreling back in the finish, leaving a happy aftertaste of bitter citrus rind and nuts. in many ways the best part is the odd milky/chocolate sweet characteristic in the malt that must develop because of the rye--it, the spiciness of the rye and the hops do great things together.  for a powerful beer full of hop madness, this one is quite drinkable... and balanced, even though it is extreme.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Goldorak,4.51,"Appearance: Ruby brownish red, with nice clingy lacing.  Smell: Hop damn! A slice of rye bread spreaded with a generous amount of strawberry jam. Unique.  Taste: I was expecting some kind of freaky concoction with off-centered flavors and just too much of everything, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a very well balanced ale, with everything in it's proper place, leaving room for everyone make a statement on my tastebuds. Rye tartness, big malt roundness, slight alcohol sting and hop finish. Bravo.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Wolfsdenbrew,4.38,"Poured with a finger thick beige head and a clear deep ruby bronze color. Left behind a moderate amount of lacing.  Aroma was full of hops and pine, some sweet caramel undertones and a bit of dark pitted fruits.  The taste carried lots of malt backbone to counteract the piney hops. An excellent balance of malts/hops. The rye comes through a bit on the finish along with bitter hoppiness.  Carbonation was spot on for the style and a medium to full bodied beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Beersignal,4.17,Had this one during a light dinner with Goldorak and company was my favourite of the evening.  Deep brown colour with russet highlights letting light stream through the slight haze. A medium head was witnessed but posessed minimal retention and offered no lacing.  A sweet spicy maltiness from the rye was buttressed by a fresh and balanced hop presence initially. Aromas of berries and grapes surfaced amid the malt and hops to lend a pleasant complexity and a faint softness of sugars danced with the hops in the finish.  The flavours mirrored the aromas and were equally balanced and seductive. Up front I detected embracing and sturdy maltiness with a touch of tartness through notes of ripe apple and peach flesh. Hints of maple water surfaced before a wave of biting hop bitterness washed the palate clean.  One of only two rye ales I have had the chance of tasting and I hope to come across it again... I loved it.  Merci Martin!,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,GeoffFromSJ,4.5,Sizeable head which goes down to sizeable lacing. Color is a clear brown/amber. Smell is of hops. Lots of hops. Taste is dominated by the hops (my pallate isn't good enough to figure out which ones). Rye characteristics do come through esp. as you finish a swig. The taste which lingers is hops-dominated however. Very smooth. Very drinkable.  Major thanks to blitheringidiot for giving me this gem.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,GIVEMEBACKMYSON,4.92,"Absolutely floral perfume for smell. Some fruity notes as well, grapefruit and overripe tangerines. Pretty red and auburn color, with sediment both sunken and suspended. A creamy rich head persists and coats up the edges of the glass. What a hop bomb. This beer shows all the things I love most about hoppy brews. The citrusfruit notion, the pine sap, the i-give-in sweetness at the finish. Rye and hops really combine for a great bitterness in a beer. It is genious. This is a favorite of mine.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,cncbofh,5,"The first beer I've given all 5's.  Poured with perfect 1 finger carbonation. Creamy and bubbly. Clear Red color.  I wouldn't normally call sediment pretty - but oh yes... these green flecks of hops make me smile.  The Rye is there - spicy and malty and slightly sweet - just very subtle. The taste is out of this world. Raisiny malts mixed with citrusy hops, and a final bitter bite that reminds you exactly what you are drinking.  Perfection.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,tjd25,4.38,"Dense creamy head, lasting on a a beautiful mahogany color body. Great retention on the sides of the glass. The smell was definitely hoppy, with Chinook hops appearing, but in a less excentric way as I expected, not as fruity and sweet as I thought. Quite fresh and grassy with perceivable notes of yeast.  The taste showed some raspberries and blueberries at first, and a second after a citric feeling. Then a more chewy wooden character, with a syrupy caramel flavor combined with a round and dark maltiness (rye I guess) that gets close to chocolate. I particularly enjoyed this hoppy west coast beer since I found it so well balanced with a real and deep malty personality. Mouthfeel was enjoyably creamy for a hop monster, and the thick mouth-drying experience was interestingly combined with refreshing and sweet notes of grain, in a slightly sticky syrupy way. I also find in surprizingly drinkable for the style. So much more balanced and interesting than Stone ruination (imho).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,gimmehead,4.4,"Beautiful rich mahogony with deep ruby highlights. Foamy off-white head and intricate lacing. Huge aroma. Floral and citric hops, roasted malts, almonds and light grassiness. Hop bomb! Taste is very earthy, huge grapefruit and resinous hops, roasted malts and a lingering, stinging, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is thick and full. This is a huge beer in every aspect. Bitterness can be a bit overwhelming by the end of the bomber, but if that is all you are planning to have it's pretty darn drinkable. Outstanding beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ppoitras,4.38,"22ozer bottle from Yankee Spirits, Sturbridge, MA.  Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" beige/light tan head above the dark copper brew. Head is airy like bread as the bubbles burst, and laces very nicely. Aroma is hops, citrus, pine, you name it, it's here. Seems like there may be some malt under all of it, but the nose can't find it. Taste is mostly about the hops (see Aroma, above), but there is a body and smoothness over the tongue that defies you to just pigeonhole it as another bottle of hops. Mouthfeel and drinkability excellent for the style, must be that rye making everything work out so well.

610,3158,GClarkage,4.03,"02/07/05- On tap at the Toronado in San Francisco, CA  Presentation- Poured into a standard pint glass.  Appearance- Red-amber pour with a nice thick and creamy white head. Adequate lacing.  Smell- A light smelling hoppy beer. At least with my nose it was. Fruity hops and a bit of malt. Nothing outstanding, but better than your normal IPA scent.  Taste- Decent amount of piney tastes as well as grapefruit flavored hops. Not a hop bomb, but enough to keep me interested.  Mouthfeel- Average carbonation here.  Drinkability- Nicely well balanced beer. Was actually happy I didn't notice any rye as I despise rye with a passion. Tasty and well rounded.

A toasted caramel smell with herbal pine and lime hops with hints of maple, allspice, and nutmeg.  A light sweet taste with the flavors of roasted caramel and light molasses malt; moderate herbal pine and grapefruit lime hops; and hints of (salt free) soy sauce, pepper, licorice, and cola.

610,3158,watermelonman,4.32,"This poured to a dark color of brown with very dark hints of red. The head was fairly small, but it still left some good rings of lace.  The smell brings hops on top of a base of rye. In the taste, the rye dies down a little bit but really compliments the bitterness. The malt content tastes much lighter than the beer looks. There's no shortage of flavor here, but it's still pretty easy to drink.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ADR,3.68,"On tap, Anam Cara, Brookline, MA...  Clearish amber color with a nice head of 1/2 an inch. Laces fully with intricate patterns all over the glass. Smell was more muted than anticipated, hops dominate but there's a touch of graininess and almost a nut tone. Feels light to the tongue but with plenty of flavor presence and solidity. Slightly minty flavors, closest to spearmint, acidic with scouring resiny hops. The malts are interesting, combine with the hops to give a wood sense, but aromatic and biting, almost like cedar. Different, but for me, not incredibly easy to drink. Still, a challenging beer to pick up when the mood strikes.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,twelvsies,4.4,"Never had a brew by this brewery before and I was definately impressed. I'd heard good things about this one. An amber on the darker side pours a brownish tawny red color with the foamy off-white head retaing for quite a while. Smells bitter and hoppy, with a sweetness rarely found in a west coast IPA. That's a good sign. It's east enough to get excited about the overly hopped west coast IPA monsters but I think the real gems are the ones that are more complex and balanced. This is one of those beers. The hops are bitter, not too in your face, all though fully a main asset to this beer. At the same time, it's not all this beer has to offer. The bitterness comes in waves and is accented my sweet mellow malts and a light bready character. As the beer warms it tends to get more spicy, bready, and herbal. Definate complexity in this beer. Such a refreshing beer from the west coast. Disconfirms my previously growing opinions that every brewery from the west coast is going to hop the shit out of beers and that's it. Much more attention here paid to detail and a great dry yet somehow creamy texture. I'll definately go back to this one. Hella sweet or something. Wicked. Whatever....",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,carln26,4.29,"This poured into the glass a hazy brown color with a thick tan head. Definitely some residual yeast in this beer (It appears this is bottle conditioned). The head clings to the side of the glass a thick sheet of lace. The nose has a piney/floral hop character along with malt sweetness. The rye lends a nutty tang to the backbone of the aroma. The flavor has the rye nuttiness up front followed quickly by the hop flower. Explosions of pine accented my the rye. I think this may be more interesting in this bottle form than it is on tap. Oily mouth feel and a good drinkability. I was a little afraid to try this beer at first, now Im strangely drawn to this style.

Rusted froth, my-my-my it looks so sexy with lace dripping off all the curves of my imperial pint. Ooh, it's randy too! This runs on hop fumes, and has a sweet and spicy body.

610,3158,rousee,4.75,"A-Beautiful murky amber with a 3mm head of apricot tinted white. The head holds extremely well. Lush velvety lace clings to sides of glass as well as the thicker lace rings spaced evenly all the way to the bottom of the glass.  S-Hoppy, malty and rye. Exactly as billed. It reminds me of the warrior or amarillo hops that are in the DFH 60 minute but they are balanced by either malt (or rye) or another kind of hops to make it not have as much bite as the forementioned brew.  T-friggin fabulous. This is just like DFH 60 min but it doesn't make me belch as much. The rye or something else that I am missing seems to temper some of the extreme hoppiness. This hoppiness is still noticeable however and it is fruity and berry-like again but tapered on the end so it mellows at the finish rather than zapping or zinging the tastebuds. The characteristics taste-wise are again as billed and almost identical to the nose-hoppy/malty with rye.  MF--smooth and non-descript. Slighly foamy, a little sticky--nothing too pronounced though.  D-Excellent. Now here is a session IPA (or tastes like it anyway)--oh maybe not its 8% ABV. They sure do a good job of not allowing that 8% to be real noticeable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,warriorsoul,3.88,"A deep, burnt amber color w/ a very creamy tan head. Beautiful lace clinging to the glass for the duration of this pint. Hints of floral hop w/ a nice toasted malt and caramel flavor. I did not know the taste of rye in my beer until now....I like it. The taste is very nice...more hops w/ a slight bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is well balanced and thick enough to be called a Double IPA. Alcohol presence is well hidden for this 8% offering. This is not a very overpowering brew and I believe I could enjoy this beyond a couple of pints....oh yeah, would not be a problem. A nice seasonal ale from Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,baiser,4.65,"Pours a dark brown colour, with a fluffy tan head, tremendous lacing. The aroma rushed out of the bottle. Floral, piney, juicy fruits, and just tonnes of hop flavour. The only way to describe this beer is that it's a hop monster. Initially, it's got such a fruity, juicy gummy bear kind of taste, but ends with a tremendous amout of hop bitterness. Just so much flavour packed into a bottle. One of my favourites.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,RedwoodGeorge,3.85,"What a novel take on the ""West Coast"" Double IPA and yet it's still unmistakably a California Hop Monster...  The beer pours a deep walnut brown with a minimal head which disappeared quite rapidly (leaving no lacing on the glass) The nose was a bit faint but quite interesting - the first, second and third notes are most certainly hops. Piney, citrusy, a wee bit floral and then more citrusy. Hiding amongst those notes is an interesting grain smell - not malted grain, not roasted grain but pure, distinct grain. Open a fresh loaf of rye bread and you'll recognize the same smell.  The taste follows the smell right down the line - hops, hops, hops and oh, by the way, rye. There is a malt note in there somewhere but it's way far down. Balance isn't exactly the theme here. Of course, the hops are very, very yummy, leaving a crisp, clean note on the palate that just begs for another sip. The rye is a very nice compliment to the hops - it's just too bad there's not a more pronounced malt note to balance out the taste. On the positive side, there's not a hint of alcohol burn which would come across as an off 'sweet' note in this mix.  If you're a hop-head and you need a fix, this is a great brew for that. It's a bold, strong double IPA that delivers a big dose of the hop juice. It's quite tasty and I'm sure I'll be going back for another nip of rye shortly...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,swamiswamu,4.58,"Appearance- Murky reddish orange with a healthy head that never dissapates and plenty of lacing Smell- hops create a floral bouquet, malt somewhat weaker than in the taste Taste- perfect! somewhat reminds me of Young's Old Nick, Instead of malt with a hop finish, hops begin with a strorng hit of grapefruit. It is mellowed with a malt finish creating the most balanced 2IPA out there. mouthfeel- smooth and cohesive Drinkable- if not for the 8%, i could drink it all night.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,RenoZymurgist,3.51,"Poured a deep amber brew with an off white head that persisted quite well, I am definetly sure that this is not a ""pale"" IPA but it still seem to be way to dark for me to give it a high score on appearance as I believe it is out of style. The aroma was a classic hoppy scent that I believe is decidedly Northwestern in style. The flavor is an all out hoppy assault but it has a definite break in the hops when a sweet caramel malt flavor breaks through. The hops linger on the tongue in that wonderful IPA way but it seems the flavor of the hops is a little toword the bitter side and not the flavor/aroma side as the only thing holding this together is the stepped up maltiness that makes the overall brew pretty good. The body is pretty good but the carbonation tends to make the already bitter hop flavors a bit more aggressive than it needs to be. I like the flavors of the hops as this ale warms and becomes less carbonated as the dryer malt flavors become more apparant and it gets smoother. If you could get a cask conditioned version of this it would be very good.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,IrishRedRock,4.27,"I'm pairing this hop monster with some bakery fresh rye bread right now, and it is goood. It would be good anyway, but mmmm. Pours richer and darker than most of its brethren, a deep mahogany with a sticky quarter-inch head. Aroma is pungent and powerful - resinous, piney hops and a musty rye maltiness along with a candy sweetness too. The aroma reminds me of Double Bastard as well. The hops are rich and bitter with some minor rye undertones. Medium bodied and the alcohol is hidden quite well. A good drinker...I'll polish this bomber off in no time!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BuckeyeNation,4.78,"Sanguineous antique bronze. Hop Rod Rye is chock full of fine particulates which create a lovely prism for the late afternoon sun slanting through my front window and cause the beer to explode with warm color. Perched atop the liquid is a creamystiff cap of pale tangerine that only an outrageously hoppy beer could produce. A perfect, rounded mesa of heavy cream awaits disruption, but not until I spend a few more moments enjoying the beautiful array of filagreed lace that sticks with impressive tenacity to the glass.  Hops, hops and more hops. And then some more. This is one of the most hop-dominant noses on any DIPA in existence. Too often beer of this style is balanced, as if balance is the Holy Grail of all beerdom. Well screw balance. It appears as if Bear Republic has given the most hopheaded among us what we crave. If the flavor follows the nose... we have a winner. Since brown sugary grapefruit and orange practically leap out of the glass, I feel pretty safe in saying that at least one, and probably multiple, of the 'C' hops are in use.  This is my kind of DIPA. I can't figure out why it continues to be classified as an IPA with such a high ABV and such a juggernaut of a hop load. There's plenty of sweet, toasted caramel flavor that does its best to keep the hops in line. Balance, shmalance. What kicks Hop Rod into orbit is the use of a not insignificant amount of rye malt that sets it apart from just about every DIPA that I've ever had.  As far as I'm concerned, rye is an underutilized grain in brewing. In the same way that it gives bourbon its spicy kick (except for Maker's Mark and a few others that use corn, barley and wheat instead of the usual corn, barley and rye), it gives this beer an exotic, piquant spiciness that is complemented by a citrusy thwack! from the hops and a sugary pine needle bite. A long, mouthcoating finish is borne of a full, chewy mouthfeel and nearly unnoticed carbonation.  I can't say enough good things about Bear Republic. Each and every beer is top-notch and is a marvel of the brewer's art. Hop Rod Rye is an intense, fantastically delicious DIPA and instantly leaps to within sight of the summit on my 'most favored beers of all-time' list. Wow!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BrewMaster,4.38,"I had this beer on tap at the Library Ale House in Santa Monica. The beer was served with a nice, off-white head on top of a beautiful clear red beer. The color was very nice on this. And the head had mad-crazy retention through the whole glass leaving nice lines on the side of the pint glass after each sip. The aroma was mostly hoppy with a slight malty. The flavor was not as hoppy as I would expect from a DIPA, but still very nice. A rich and sweet malty flavor mixed with a caramel and nutmeg flavors. I had no idea this beer was brewed with rye by the taste. I dislike rye on its own and in rye bread and such, but none of the harshness of the rye carried into this beer. it was velvety on the palate and a dream to drink.  this beer went perfectly with the NY Steak Sandwich at the Library Ale House.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,danadeny,3.6,"Had on tap at Anam Cara on new years eve. Dark brown body, no head. Smells of roasted barley, not much else.

Drinkability is good due to overall balance of flavors.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,FormatKid,4.65,"This is one of those beers I've been waiting to try ever since I started getting into craft brew. I actually managed to grab a bomber of this from State Line in Maryland, and I am happy to say it did not let me down.  The body of this beer is quite a bit darker than I'd imagined, completely brown practically with some hints of amber and red. The head is off white and sticky, fat globs of lace are spread about sporadically. The nose is explosive with hop aromas, pine, citrus (grapefruit), pineapple. The underlying malt was broken up a bit by the aroma of rye. The first thing I notice upon tasting is that the typically thick, sweet malt backing was softened up by the rye, gaining it a bit of complexity. The bitterness levels were aggressive througout with the finish being dominated by sharp spikes of those lovely hop flavors, pine, apricot, pineapple, grapefruit... The mouthfeel is perfect, soft with light carbonation, neither too slick or clingy. What a great beer, next time I see it I will be sure to stock up.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,brewdlyhooked13,4.73,"Appearance - reddish brown, 4 fingers of mocha head that melt down with lace clumping on the sides and surface. Refilling to top off the glass creates a sculpted, thick cap like a cappuccino.  Aroma - interesting blend of hops and a soapy, sweet grain. Fresh smelling despite having aged for 9-12 months. Hop florals win out, but a nice blend.  Taste - rye grain sets up a nice contrast for the hops while at the same time providing a malt base that's got some distinct flavor itself. The hops are intense but not overly bitter. A great blend of sweet and spice on the hops. Finishes with a sweet note, a little chocolaty and a trace of alcohol, then a warm, intense rye grain aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - really smooth on the palate, a resiny coating leaves a juicy hop sweetness behind.  Drinkability - abv is well-hidden.

610,3158,nogoodreason,4.62,"It pours out fairly dark, not quite brown but some ruby highlights highlights. Towards the end there are what I believe to be (very) little chunks of hops floating in this beer. Sounds unappealing, but in truth it adds to the experience.  Nose is of gold old American citrusey hops with a strong malty backbone. Sweet, but not overly so, with a rather inviting spiciness. There's an odd, almost roasty bitterness detectable.  In your mouth, it's full, not particularly thick, just full and smooth, smooth, smooth. Carbonation adds a trace of creaminess and goddamn, it's nice.  There's a distinct hop bitterness with rich, caramelized malt presence and that lovely rye tang which adds so much depth. That odd, almost roasty bitterness is there again in the finish, must be a result of rye intertwining with hops(?). It's plenty sweet but never sticky, rather remaining delicate and refreshing while intertwining with the grapefruit flesh and forming a delicate candy like presence to complement the intense hop bitterness. The hops, The hops, it's hoppy as hell and plenty bitter yet it never seems vulgar or hopped simply to be hoppy. Ridiculously drinkable for such a big beer. No alcohol presence is ever noticeable.  At the end, the rye gets more assertive taking on a slightly spicy character behind the grapefruit flesh, caramel malts and a perfect lingering hop bitterness.  Really a unique and special ale. A great example of the creativity and talent of American craft brewers. A new favorite.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,alexgash,4.87,"From notes. Had a pint of this at the Yard House in Costa Mesa. Zero atmosphere, but very clean tap lines. Fresh out of the tap this beer is even better than out of the bottle. Still has the same brick-red body and creamy tan head. But the spicy, piny, resiny hop aromas are even more pronounced and appetizing. The caramally maltiness still holds its own though. Hop and malt flavor are also enhanced. I just love the spicy character throughout--even in the malty sweet beginning. I just wish I could get this on-tap more often.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,garymuchow,3.91,"This bottle courtesy of Gueuzedude. Many thanks. Aroma seemed fairly simple hops quality of grassiness and slight citrus. I didn't pick up much malt. Dark amber of deep gold, brown and red. Big full steady head that became rocky. Left a great trail of lacey rings. Some setiment on the bottom and that showed in some cloudiness as poured towards the end of the bottle. Flavor is a hop monster to be sure. Pleasant grassy taste up front that grows in intensity in the middle then bursts to an intense bitterness for the very long finish. The touch of malt is nice, but not outstanding and too quick and incomplete. Great fullness from high carbonation, but it's largely soft and allows for some smoothness. Nice feel overall. The excessive bitterness of the finish mellows a little as it warms, plus the malt charater increased simultaneously, but neither is enough to make this exceptional.

Nice aroma of pine, fresh citrus and a bit of dinner roll smell. Yummy!  Taste is bitter yet balanced by some sweetness that comes in during the after taste. Lots of pine and grapefruit taste in the forefront. Im not sure what the rye adds, but the beer is tasty. More caramel and alcohol emerges as you work through the beer.  Nice smooth mouth with a very nice level of carbonation. A little tongue numbing at time. Easy to drink but the high ABV would keep this from being a session beer.

Some floaty sediment particles floating around topped off by a rock solid craggy, surface of the moon head cap of khaki tan tight bubbles ½ thick that wont go away if you asked it to.

With an aromatic scent such as this, one needs to be intrepid to taste.  First Spark Plug Sparks: Grounded deep malt back to the overwhelming hops eruption. Deep resinous hops oils and biscuit malt wheat bread backing. Acidic feel is syrupy sweet and tacky. This is a flavor playground. Pez powder and syrupy acidic lemon rind & oranges. Aftertaste is a lingering acidic sizzle and grain. The rye is a beguiling deceptive ingredient that reveals itself only in the most subtle way of graininess.  Handling: Hand me a steak knife and a fork. Thick full body. Quite filling on a chilly nite tnite. This is a sluggable big powerful beer. Scary Drinkability factor since another bomber (if only to be so lucky) would go back in a 2000 RPM engine rotation.  Cross the finish line: Half 2IPA, half BarleyWine. Big and bold. 8% ABV.

After several weeks of drinking pumpkin ales and Oktoberfest brews, I'm ready for something bitter and hoppy. Wow, this is bitter! But I like it. Not for the faint of hop-heart, this brew slammed me with a constant dose of malt flavor, hop flavor and then that hop bitterness kicks-in. The rye is in there, mostly it seems on the finish. Overall, the bitterness seems a little harsh, and my own preferences would tone it down just a bit. Then again, sometimes we just need to get a good kick in the arse, and this brew will do just fine for that.

A very strong hop aroma; piney, oily, and some citric aromas. There's also a mellow clove-like spiciness which I attributed to the rye.  A great juicy Double IPA! The flavors are grapefruit, lemon, and hop oils at first that give way to a burnt toffee aftertaste. The rye is almost nut-like and very warming. It balances out the over the top hop flavors well. A medium malty sweetness is also present that provides a great bitterness.  This is a big hop beer and it is thick on the palate. Any Double IPA with this much flavor though is expected to be a bit thick and heavy. At 8%abv this one goes down very smoothly.  A great beer for the style, especially if you're a hophead.

Aroma was of floral hops and a sweet smell reminiscent of brown sugar (although this could have been the malt).  Taste matched the aroma, with the bitter hop flavor dominating. However, what was interesting was the way in which the flavors emerged. The taste starts off bitter with the brown sugar flavor coming through in the background. Suddenly, the flavors then stop like a caesura, temporarily canceling out one another to nothingness. Then the bitterness and dry finish come back in a rage. Very cool effect.

So bitter almost has metallic quality. Mouthfeel is a tease of sweet malt followed by palate destroying, tongue numbing, IBU train wreck of flavor.

The head was a bit short lived, but the copious lacing left on the sides of the glass while departing was a constant reminder of it.  The aroma was primed with piney and citric juicy hops, bready rye malt, and perfumey alcohol. The taste was like buttered rye toast with a touch of honey dunked into tea made of hop leaves. The mouthfeel felt a bit thinner than the alcohol in the aroma first suggested. The aftertaste was peppery and dry, and left me longing for the next sip.

610,3158,yankeeheel,4.2,"Pours a nice dark amber with a very spacious, foamy eggshell head. Tons of retention and nice lacing. Smells quite citrusy with a nice amount of biscuit and lemon grass coming through. Tastes like a premium IPA should. Not a huge hop kick in the nuts, but a very balanced, strongly hopped beggining. This is followed by a slight malty reprieve, then turns back to grapefruit, lemon, and rye. Mouhtfeel is rather large and the body is moderately chewy. The alcohol is hitting me hard on this.

610,3158,CarolinaCardinals,4.47,"Piked up a bomber at TJ's recently. Bear Republic is my 2nd favorite brewery anymore. Look out Stone!  This dark reddish brown brew poured a nice head leaving a nice lacing down my 22 oz glass. Smell is wonderful, of glorius floral hops, grapefruit, and rye. Taste is excellent. I have paired this off with tortilla chips, con queso cheese sauce, and hot salsa. The high alcohol content is masked extremely well by a wonderful blend of rye, sweet malts, and a ton of hops. My tounge feels totally alive as a result of a more than generous share of hops. This is an extremely drinkable beer but as my credo goes, ""Beer will always be my friend as long as you don't abuse it""!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ngandhi,4.52,"Gigantor. Robust hops -- the rose of Centennial, the grapefruit and tropicalia of Cascades, the dry lemon of Amarillo, and astringent pine; I have no idea if those are the hops that are actually here, but it makes no difference in the end what the names are.  Hop Rod Rye blooms with flavor. Apparently quite malty, but never aggressive with sweetness. Malts peek in and out as if this beer is being seasoned as I drink it. Loads of fruit from the hops. Dry, pressing bitterness on the finish is intense, but more evocative than anything else. It lingers and, after some time, pains me. Yet it brings more hop flavor -- never washing out. Some grain. Rosemary. Herbal.  Rye berries as it warms. The spicy grain of the rye is a perfect match for the toturous hops, to the point where all of this beer's flavor seems to be coming from the hops. There's an indescribable finesse to these hops -- you taste all that West Coast goodness, but there's something more. To my surprise, this is the rye which, once the beer really warms, comes off as pumpernickle, but is so delicate and such a fantastic complement that I don't think I would have known what it is without the label.  And, oh yes, that bitterness again. Oh, the effort it takes for me to not move the back of my tongue, to not excite it and awaken those raw hops yearning to make me cry. I think it has been destroyed. Think of this beer as an exercise in anatomy. I've read about the four main regions of the tongue; Hop Rod Rye excites them all, makes them each individually recognizable and simultaneously stimulated. This overload of a single sense has forced the rest of my body to shut down to compensate. I can't hear any more and everything I see looks like a hop bud. And my tongue is numb. Really.  The finish goes on for centuries, asymptotically approaching a final, bran-melting bitterness that, in the end, is tamed by tremendous hop flavor. An unnerving balance of extremities. Well, unnerving at least.  Masterful.  Relax, relax. ng",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Mouthfeel: Definately thick. The head is still there till the last drop and adds to the creamy feel. Aftertaste is great bitterness.  Drinkability: A few of these will put you in your place.

This came in the usual 22ozer from BR with a hop rod car on the label. This poured out a nice dark amber color with a good sized rocky beige head. Nice rings of lacing were left around the glass as I drank this. Aroma is full of hops as the name would suggest as well as a bready malt presence. I could also smell the rye distinctly after a few sips as it warmed which added nicely to the aroma. The taste opens up with light malt sweetness and hints of rye before the hop rod drives through your palette and deliver a good does of earthy hops and a nice bitter rye aftertaste. This beer is perfectly balanced, not overpowering in any aspect but not weak in any either. This has a nice medium mouthfeel with good carbonation.

It was bitter, acrid, and overly hopped. While there was a hint of rye in the aroma, and an undeniable rye component to the beers flavor. Overbearing, and uninteresting hop flavors dominated.

Hop Rod Rye is one of those great big beers that are brewed out there in the Bear Republic brewery in California. It is a fine example for it's style and always will be. Pours a thick, almost unfiltered looking hazy amber colour with a thick head that just cascades from the glass, no matter how much care you put into the pour. The aroma is strong with the rye, It's almost all that is smelled. I'm happy that the yeast isn't as pronounced as it could be. Rye bread isn't my idea of a good drink. The taste is also very strong with rye. There is a nice hoppy bitterness that lingers on the tongue for a few seconds after the sip has been taken. Not a bad beer, in fact, it is a fantastic beer for it's style.

I guess the name HopRod didn't click. It was a good surprise though, totally made the night. Arrived at the table looking mighty appetizing with its deep red glow, and creamy perfect head. Was greeted to a wonderful citrusy hop aroma and a slight rye character. Hops weren't overpowering like with their Racer X, but were definitely in the forefront. The taste is predominantly west coast hops but finishes with a semi-sweet rye note. Extremely balanced and drinkable. I really wanted another, but another 20 oz. pint would've done me in.

The aroma was malty and hoppy with citrus and fruity aromas and rye.  The flavor was malty with a slickness from the rye and a substantial bitterness that shines through the flavors. The bittering and maltiness along with the mouthfeel work together to keep the beer from becoming overly bitter or overly sweet.  The finish was dry with a pleasant yet muted hop bitterness lasting into the aftertaste. The body was medium, actually just a bit more, but not quite medium full.

The taste is a citrus and pine/grassy hoppiness with a strong rye dryness laying underneath of it, and a very slight alcohol; the aftertaste is a strong rye. Mouthfeel is average. As for drinkability, this is definitely a beer I could have quite a few of.  Probably the best rye beer I've had. A rye pale ale, for lack of a better term, with a good dry backing to the citrusy West Coast hops.

Hops and some ginger and pine spices on the nose, very strong and intense, and call it inviting. A huge tongue to throat blast of hops, and a mild sweetness to it. Piney offerings as well as sharp grapefruit and fresh citrus notes. Some rye tastings are just enough to offset the massive hops; becomes a bit acidic and bitter, yet in a good way; some caramel malt notes towards the bottom of the glass. The balance seems to be pretty decent, a definitive hops based body, but is quickly backed by the noted tastings. Could easily pass as an APA in style, yet the rye/barley offerings place it in it's own class, and at the lead; seek and destroy!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Light grassiness and caramel beneath.  Taste is big on bitter, doesn't quite hit you at first but really comes out strong fairly fast. Nice citrus flavors, orange and grapefruit, as well as a bit of rye flavor as well, not as much as you might expect though. Finish is bitter, still hitting hard with the citrus notes and leaves you with even more hops well after swallowing.  Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, medium-full body, with wonderful carbonation.

It has a lingering head of about 1/8"" and the bubbles are tight. I smell hops and I'm looking for a rye smell and nothing jumps up to greet me.  The taste is bitter and hoppy is still going on on the smell side. It almost tastes like smoked beer. The rye is supposedly 18% of the bill and I now taste it but not like other rye beer I've had. Perhaps the rye works better in a wheat ale than an IPA.  The mouthfeel is thicker than I expected. It's a little silky. It's tasty.

Sweet malts to start then massive hoppy grapefruit and pine flavour which is undercut by the sticky flavour of the rye..This is good the brewer has balanced the malts, hops AND rye to a tee!

Rich blast of malty sweetness, with bittering hops trying break through. There is a sense of rye; the flavor is subtle, but you know it's there. Slightly peppery. Finishes even with malt/rye sweetness on the tip of the tongue, a drying bitterness in the rear. The mouthfeel is dense and chewy, but the carbonation keeps it lively.

610,3158,nomad,4.6,"An even amber color is transparent with a somber crimson hue. Generous amounts of carbonation supports the pocky head. Thick stain and lace is present and accounted for.  Smells begins with a grapey amber malt with hops that are a nebulous mix of arborous, spruce, and grapefruit notes. The rye component is interesting to my nose as a bready scent with peppery spice. Solid but not wowing.  Rye spice is delicious as amber malts and Northwest hops banter back and forth. Fruity bits of grape run astray because the hops, Centennial in sort, dominate with earthy bitterness and speckled dryness. This beer rolls with flavor, turning over similar shades of complementary flavors (roast barley, rye, rough fruity hops) that aid in drinkability. An absolutely slaking combo comes from these well-treated ingredients touched off by a fresh, tart finish of biting lupulin oil. Could a beer be tastily chalky dry yet still wet? Only because there are so many flavors creating a balance. The full mouthfeel with dead-on carbonation is impressive for a bottled ale.  Dangerous drinkability with that alcohol volume. Simultaneously thirst quenching and inducing. This is why the bomber sized bottle exists. Kick ass label design, too. I really dig this beer, I could drink it any day.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

You can find the rye/grains and a kind of honey sweetness too. The yeast is also present. Theres a slight spiciness and fruitiness also. The taste is light and pleasant, and as this is my first rye beer, I do say that I like it. It's got a bit of eatrhy sweetness and grainy flavors too, with a bitterness definately from something other than hops. Mouthfeel is medium in body, but it is very low in carbonation. It would be great if it had just a tiny bit more carbonation.

610,3158,Mitchster,4.48,"18% Rye, 8.0% ABV, OG=1.074, 90 IBU.  Pours out to a beautiful deep garnet, forming a creamy tan head with superior retention and lacing. A recent bottle poured out silty, which is fine with me. Probably the boatload of hops and rye they put in here. The head remains at least 1/4"" thick until the last drops. There are flittering pieces of hop leaves suspended in this gorgeous brew. Aroma is intensely hoppy with piney and citric notes galore...sweet and not too harsh, but definitely West-Coast. Mouthfeel is semi-smooth with a medium-dense body. Taste starts with a ton of citric, followed by piney hops with a distinctly woody note, followed by a sticky amber malt body, some grainy dryness (rye), a bit of grain husk towards the astringent and intensely hoppy and moderately-strong bitter finish. The finish is very earthy and woody with more notes of dry grain dust (biscuit malt?).  In a blind tasting, this would consistently be called a Barleywine/Old Ale. In fact, this tastes very similar to Kzoo Old Ale, Kzoo Batch 6000, Stone Old Gaurdian, Hog Heaven etc. Good brew, but I would much rather drink their Black Bear Stout:)",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Aroma is all hops with a light piney aroma.Lots of hop flavor but balanced well as a roasted rye flavor is not hidden. Smooth and creamlike on the tongue with a carbonation level that is right on.

Nose: Wow, you could smell the hops as soon as you opened the bottle. When you tip your nose to the glass it's like grabbing a hand full of hops and sniffing them.. Maybe some mild berries. Some grapefruit as well.  Taste: And now the taste; maybe this is what it would be like if they made hop gum! I get some grapefruit in the middle. This has a burnt after taste, like roasted coffee. No alcohol taste at all. maybe a little roasted malt at the begining.  Notes: I enjoyed this very much. If you love hops, this is a must.

610,3158,RedDiamond,4.2,"Hop Rod Rye is a delightful beer with an inviting, rounded mouthfeel and a pleasant malty nose. But I cant say as my palate is sufficiently attuned to the nuances of rye malt as to either explicitly identify it as such or even to enjoy it. Perhaps I just havent yet come to appreciate the style. But the rye content of Hop Rod makes only a modest contribution to the overall flavor profile, and I havent found any compelling value for it. Hop Rod may be the first rye beer Ive ever knowingly consumed and Ill be certain to make further overtures to the style in the future. But for now the style itself has shown me little of interest and the variation is too modest to justify the effort.  That said, I certainly enjoyed Hot Rod. It is clear with a warm chestnut color. It forms a good lumpy head of off-white suds and leaves behind a fair tailing of lace. The finish is crisp and culminates with a succinct pinch of bitterness. The aroma is dark and molasses-like, yet also strangely piney. The taste is relaxed if not compressed, and Im wondering now if the bomber I drank was particularly fresh. The bottle indicates that this is a seasonal ale but it doesnt say which season.  The flavor definitely takes a turn away from the taste of pure barley malt  its a little earthier or peaty. But the disparity is meager and I cant say as I appreciated the merits of this distinction to any notable degree. I also didnt grasp the muscle car potency of the hop infusion, which alleges to measure out at 90+ IBUs. Perhaps the rye took the edge off the hops. It was definitely hoppy, but not that hoppy.  One more thing  I felt virtually no effect from the alcohol. Strange.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Taste is sharp hops at first followed by some malt with earthy fruity undertones. A bit hard to find the rye, but you can tell its in there adding a bit of grainyness to the beer. Hops blast in again and provide a healthy dose of bitterness and drying power. Nicely carbonated and very easy drinking. Alcohol is hidden well.

Flavor hops up front, followed by malt, followed by bittering hops. Great balance. I have never found a beer before where each of the big flavors simply end and another takes over. I can't find any subtleties however. If it sits in my mouth too long I find a god-awful bitterness that sits at the opening to my throat.  Nice and creamy.  I have to bring it down in the drinkablity, because I can feel it killing my palette. Don't get me wrong, it is a very drinkable beer, however, after a couple I would have to leave this beer for another to cleanse and I would probably never return during that session.  I like this beer. I like this beer a lot, but only hopheads need apply. I am left wondering though: what contribution does the rye bring?

610,3158,Suds,4.09,"Pours a deep, clear mahogany color with a medium colored creamy head. The head is considerably sticky, and eventually retreats to a thin film. Theres an intense, strong hop aroma. The assertive hoppiness gets in the way of the other aromas, but underneath theres a malty, grainy smell. Its resinous, pine-like, peppery, sticky, medium bodied, and very bitter. The bitterness runs throughout the entire taste, and creeps from the back of your tongue to fill your entire mouth. I have trouble discerning the ryetheres a bready, grain-like backbone, but its not as intense as a lot of rye beers. The finish is hoppy, peppery, and bitter. Alcohol can be sensed through warming, but is well hidden in the taste. This ones aggressive, no-nonsense beer.

Arrives with a glistening, dense amber body with a viscous off-white head that deflates gradually and leaves some pretty patches of lace on the glass.  Smell is a rich flourish of pine needles, rain-wet dandelions, crusts of rye bread. A faint brown sugary malt presence drapes the underside of the nose.  Taste opens with a peppery burst of hops, followed by a sharper hop presence -- sourdough and rye distinct along the edges -- through the finish the brown sugary malts tilt in but the hearty bitterness takes the stage front and center.

The scent of grapefruit and hops were very up front and just made me want to drink this beer even more. The flavor was great with a generous dose of hops and a nice citrus-y sweetness.

Rather, it's a complex, flavorful hop monster, bwah-hah-hah...  It had a red-amber body, with a lumpy tan head. No flames or pinstripes were seen. The aroma was grapefruit, malt, and rye. A 5-speed taste tranny, with grapefruit, chocolate, caramel, rye, and pepper smoothly shifting the gears. The mouthfeel was thin and smooth, with small, light carbonation. Nice lace sheeting, too. It finished up the 1/4 mile with grapefruit, lemon peel, cardboard, and leather (rich Corinthian?) Great mileage/drinkability from this well-balanced brew. 0% financing available from your local beer store...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,jonnylieberman,4.68,"Poured out perfect from a 22 ounce bottle. 2 inches or more of head that just sat there, enticing me. Darkest orange and a little brown in appearence.  Smells of hops and rye. A little plum, too.  Lovely taste. To me, a perfect of example of a California beer. Explosive, monumental, bigger, better. Hops are all over the place. In the nose, the mouth the finish. Intensley aromatic. Perfect malty backbone with the rye only adding to the dried fruit aspects. High in gavity (and alcohol -- 8.0%) there is flavor to spare. Like all great beers, Hop Rod gets more intersting with each passing sip.  Mouthfeel is just about everything you could want. Plump, full, without being too syrupy. Yums!  I could drink a keg of this by myself. Don't believe me? Let's bet, come on, try me.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,kmcnair,4.38,"Sampled from a 22oz bomber.  Fills my glass with a nice deep amber/red color with a thick offwhite/tan head. Head lingers around for a bit and then gets topped off. Leaves a bit of lacing in the glass as I drink it.  Smell is rich of malts with a light floral finish and notes of citrus.  Flavor is complex and the hops attack instantly. Its both creamy and spicy at the same time. Hoppy and bitter just like the name suggests. The rye is in there, and is most noticable in the finish.  Mouthfeel is full and thick, malty caramel coats as it goes down.  All in all, this is a rock solid brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,pio,4.18,"deep amber liquid with a foamy cream/tan head, gently poured it's about a finger but dense and unyeilding. medium activity with slow rising little bubbles. complete sheeting lace with a head that is along for the whole (fast) ride. only a bit hazy if poured well. on the nose the hops, rye and malt balance well but the toasted rye scent is just outstanding and alluring. the hops scent here is a bit understated but seems a good counterpiece to the rye and malt. dark citrus hints as does a rarely discernable earthier hop note. no alcohol detected. as i suspected alot more hops used in bittering and flavoring than the scent lets on. the start is toasty and malty with a touch of sweetness and the rye takes off and all those hops come into play helping make a somewhat sour and earthy middle then a citric presentation abides with the rye. it really puckers and dries up with a bitter woody and toasted rye finish. the rye is the main player here and is notable throughout the whole ride, maybe that's why they have the word rye in big letters on the bottle.warming alcohol in the belly but hidden in the flavor. a medium crisp effervescance and a medium to heavy body that leaves just a bit of a powdery feeling if you will. the first time i had this i knew i had to go get another and the second was the same way. very tasty, drinkable and special brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,lampkins,4.3,This has been one of my favorite ales of the last year and a half. I love rye ales and they are few and far between so I almost wet myelf when I saw this at the store.  The beer poured a copper red which gave a descent head. The aroma reminds me of strong IPA. The beer packed a powerful hoppy punch that finished off with a characteristic smooth rye zip as it went down my throat. The malt taste is like eating a rye toast.  I have tried this beer right out of the fridge and have let it warm a bit and it is great either way. This is one of my favorites and I can't get enough of this brew.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,HiroProtagonist,4.4,"Start your engines! Hop Rod Rye was served from a 22 oz. bomber. In a pint glass, the beer was a wonderous and brilliant ruby-orange, with a creamy tan head that left sticky and thick lacing. The ""in your face"" nose had a firm and grainy malt profile, with a super-charged volatile hop bouquet I imagined distorting the air above the glass. The taste reflected the nose, starting with a robust dry nutty roasted malt backbone wrapped up in a superbly monstrous bitter finish that got the blood pumping. A touch a sweetness at the end rounded out this finely tuned package, and left me captivated and completely satisfied. The full and muscular body matched the full flavor spot on. Considering the mega-hopped up flavor, this beer drank suprisingly well. I am very happy to find Hop Rod Rye making a home in Portland. Put your bets on this one, its a winner!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,twilight,4.5,"The glass was this strange Imperial Pint/Pilsner hybrid. Tulip-ish like an Imperial, but tall like a Pilsner.  I had this as a last brew because I knew I wouldn't be able to taste anything else afterwards. The pour was copper red, and, right away, from arms length, I could smell the hops. The taste is an intense slap of that trademark west-coast hoppiness, with a malt sweetness that gives way to a dry hop aftertaste that lingers, with a bone-dry finish that feels as though the rye had come to lay the hopped wasteland of my tastebuds out to dry. Mouthfeel is rich, intense. I really could drink this all night regardless of the ABV, just worshipping at the altar of the hop.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,merlin48,4.8,"22 oz bottle pours out a clear, copper/red color with a thick beige head that retains well before fading into patchy sheet lacing. Aroma is a complexity of rye bread and westcoast hop notes of pine and sour citrus. Pears are noted in the background. Mouthfeel is thick and coating, as hops pour all over the palate. Taste is very highly hopped, but the rye and roasted grain flavors blend exceptionally well. This is really an extraordinary beverage! The rye bread flavor is a very hardy backbone for the orangerind and pine hop flavors that weave in and out, and all around this flavorful brew. Very chewy, and tastes like liquid food at times. Floral and fruity notes jump around the flavor profile as well. This is one of the finest ales I've sampled in quite some time. Complex and full of flavor, this is one kickass beer. A beautiful work of art that satisfies in all respects. Highly recommended!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,longpondbeerman,4.05,"Another trip to Half Time Beverages in Poughkeepsie and a whole new slew of beers to review. First the Hop Rod Rye, which poured a luscious deep and clear mahogony from the 22 oz. bomber, bearing (pardon the pun) a quintessential Healdsburg hot rod on the label. To top it off there was a thick pearl-white head that receded slowly into a lovely and sticky lace. The folks in Sonoma are not prevaricating--the hops are front and center in the aroma, but still balanced with an overlay of malts (is this the rye?). Yes, I think so, and perhaps that's the reason for the slight smoky tinge in the taste. Oh, the hops are still most evident, but the Bear Republic brewers manage to get in a coal or two somewhere in the process (though not as prevalent here as in the Red Rocket). The mouthfeel is creamy and bubbly. I like this stuff.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Rastacouere,3.9,"Bronze body with a sticky off-white head. Aroma is very hoppy, enough hops that I couldn't take notice of any rye at all. Sweat, wood, pencil fragments, floral. The taste initially consists of a medium caramel sweetness, fading malts. Hoppiness is huge, intense. Finish isheavily bitter, dry, very long, woody, piney. Creamy medium body. Powerful west-coast style to which you add peaks of originality and that's the result. Thanks John",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,jeffboo,4.22,"A very nice spicy,hoppy beer from the West Coast. This one is a dark copper color with a nice tan foam. Very fresh hop aroma with a mix of both floral and citrus smells. Body is medium/full with a very spicy, complex flavor profile with toast,rye bread,smoke, and caramel malts rolling with the hop flavors. A very easy to drink hybrid IPA with lots of flavors to challenge the tastebuds.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,hyuga,4.52,"Poured for me from the tap and filled nearly to the top without much head, which is something I don't like, but this one has good head retention so it's not so bad. A reddish mahogany beer with a whitish head. Lots of lace is left on the sides of the glass. The aroma features generous ""west coast"" hopping of a pine cone character and also more than a hint of citrus. Rye is noticeable along with the malt in the backbone. Smooth in the mouth, even a bit creamy. Maltiness at the very front of a rye grain character, followed very soon by a big piney hop bite, and then filled out with a big backbone of rye character. Hints of citrus all around. Bitterness comes out on top at the end for a crisp, dry finish. Excellent beer, my favorite from this brewery, although I actually prefer the bottled version of this one. Makes sense though, it is bottle conditioned, unless my memory is playing tricks. Highly recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,abents,4.62,Very dark amber-brown apperance with a sweet smell. Smells sweet with the hops coming through. Feels amazing in your mouth with a malty smooth taste and unbelievable hops overpowering the tastebuds. Also taste spices and rye throughout the beer. Overall an amazing beer that I will likely have to try again soon.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,mschofield,4.38,"Hazy red-amber with a three finger bubbly rocky head, well carbonated, and the head just lasts and lasts. Very hoppy aroma, citrus and floral. Hoppy (orange and grapefruit) and grainy taste, interesting. Almost a bran flavor note. Alcohol esters are noticable. Rye bread taste follows the upfront flavors after you swallow. Caramel, and toffee flavors. A little rough edged, I couldn't drink it too often, but it's an interesting brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,avylover,4.45,"Pours out a deep mahogony color with a nice healthy off white head and tons of yeast floating around in there. A smell reveals a hefty caramel maltiness with a strong hop presence in the background. Taste is fairly sweet for a beer named ""Hop Rod."" There are no doubt some bittering floral hops in there, but a sweet maltiness rules this ale. Great malts & great hops. My friend just mentioned ""This is really good."" He's right. Nice slick mouthfeel and immensley drinkable. This borderlines on the perfect strong session ale.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,OatmattStout,4.4,"As with all the Bear Republic beer's I have had this one followed suit with an incredibly rocky, fluffy and thick head and rendered the appropriate full lacing on my glass from top to bottom. Nice deep mahogony color with plenty of particles of unfiltered hops and yeast. The nose was of firm and fresh hops and a hint of rye. Taste was great with the hop slam hitting you with all the usual suspects, pine, citrus and a grapefruit rind biting finish. Nice malt backbone to hold up to the hops . Awesome.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Realale,4.16,"Full clear deep mahogany brown. Extremely fine 1/2"" beige head stays throughout the pint leaving excellent lacing. A truly beautiful beer.  Nose is leafy citric hop over slightly bready, slightly spicy malt. Bit of yeastiness, slight touch of clove add complexity.  Medium full in the mouth. Very nice base of bready malt. Excellent hop flavor and bitterness throughout, but maintains its balance well. Touch of chalkiness distracts a bit on the finish. Great length.  Stunning soft creamy bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. Bear Republic really, really nailed the mouthfeel on this one. Quite drinkable for an 8% brew. Highly recommended.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,frank4sail,4.73,"Got this rare ""Bear of a beer"" in these parts via BA brother Boilermaker88 Cheers my friend..  Fresh ""spring morning like grassy nose"" with a little pine tree as well. Cherry/peach color with a huge lasting pale pink fluffy airy head... what retention.. stiff peaks. Big hoppy piney, chewy, grapefruit taste with a malty rye bread backbone. The finish really brings out the bready rye notes in the beer which helps to try and balence the brutal hop punishment on the tongue. Medium to fuller chewy coating mouthfeel. The next time I get to the west coast.... I will be seek these out with a vengance... my kind of beer. Makes a cornbeef special look like babyfood. A hop monster with unique craftmanship...",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Stingray5,4.1,"22oz bomber pours a beautiful dark ruby with a white head. Lots of fresh, fresh hops in the aroma. Thick mouthful with moderate carbonation is very pleasing. Taste is a balance of big hops and big malt. Hops, as in the aroma, are very fresh. While my first few sips were smooth, the hops began to take on a bit of a harsh quality. Not sure how much of this could be the rye, though. Only the drinkability suffers as a result. Finishes with long lasting hoppy goodness, but a little too dry. No indications taste-wise of the abv.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,francisweizen,4.5,"This BR brew pours out a dark reddish/ruddy, rusty brown colour with a nice tan/beige head of foam. The aromas are of sweet and roasted malts, citrus-y, piney hops and alcohol spinged spiciness. The taste lives up to the hype with a big, bolshy, excellent malty backbone for truckloads of hops to play upon. This brew has a lovely fresh cut hop finish, and an after-taste that will not only give you hop burps, but excellent, malty hop burps. The mouthfeel is thick, but not cloying or over the top and the drinkabiity is excellent for an ale of this size. 8%ABV, wow you could have fooled me. An interesting and excellent brew from BR",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Naerhu,3.85,"Huge tan head, brown read body, great lace. Mostly pine hop aroma. Cannot tell what makes this a rye. Cannot taste any rye. Medium body and long lasting elegant finish. This beer's selling point seems to be its hops, not its rye. Spicy maltiness that I imagine is attributable to the rye. An elegant light sweetness.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,saskguy,4.35,"Wow, what a beer.  Has a great head that sticks around, with a dark rich colour, and a nice hoppy aroma.  The taste starts off with a large floral attack and finishes with an wonderful bitterness.  I could drink gallons of this stuff even with the high abv.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ybnorml,4,This is my first taste of a Bear Republic Ale. I will be trying more. The head was marvelously thick almost merienge. Looking thru the glass the ale is a dark amber not quite pristinely clear. The aroma has a great hop floral boquet. A good hop sweetness a the begining of the mouthful and a good hop bite on the swallow.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,WanderingFool,4.35,"Not knowing what to expect from a rye beer I found this one to be quite a tasty surprise. It pours a clear dark brown color with some ruby hues mixed in. The ivory head quickly dissolved to a ring around the surface leaving a good amount of lace behind. A hoppy aroma of citrus, pine and pepper hovers over the beer.  Each sip is medium bodied and packed with flavor. Hops dominate with grapefruit and pine, but there's a nice caramel malt hidden in the background that balances everything out. It finishes bitter leaving a hoppy flavor behind.  This beer is moderately drinkable and full of flavor. Hopheads will find it tasty and Maltmen will appreciate the balanced flavor.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,xgrigorix,4.08,"Twenty two ounce brown bottle, no dates.  Dark auburn colour, with fast moving lines of carbonation. Dense off white head retains very weel, leaving lace behind as it slowly settles.  Bright grapefruit loaded hop aromas invite a sip.  A great bif IPA, with a sour rye twang that takes it someplace very tasty. Loads of sweetness, & a hoppy finish loaded with pine & grapefruit. Medium bodied, farily brisk carbonation. Highly unique, and quite delicious.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,ElGuapo,4.5,"Deep dark brown amber topped in a large coating of off-white head. Huge nose filled with hops. There are floral and citrus aromas as well as some spices in there. There is a little bit of malt sweetness that is detectable as well.  You start off with a blend of citrus and floral flavors that is pretty intense, but not overpowering. It gets a touch of sweetness to balance. It then gets a little toasty, but it doesn't seem to have as much rye character as others. It is all about the hops here. The body is pretty full, and it is smooth all the way down. The 8% is hidden extremely well. It is easy to drink, and even though it is on the thicker side, it doesn't seem like it after a pint. This is a marvelous brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,taez555,4.12,"This beer poured a white head with a dark amber/brown body.  The nose was very inviting. Dark citrus hops. I serious in your face grapefruit peel citrus attack. Any hint of malt is completely overshadowed by this ambrosial smell of hops. It&#8217;s quite breathtaking.  The beer was medium bodied with a smooth creamy mouthfeel. A serious citrus hop punch sits atop the malt. Tight cascade/centennial hop taste. Wood, citrus, black pepper, pine needles, sharp sharp sharp citrus peel. A perfect balance of caramel malt against the hops. What&#8217;s really interesting is the how you can actually taste the rye malt in this beer and how it&#8217;s matches the hops so well. Basically you wouldn&#8217;t notice it unless you tasted for it. You&#8217;d just assume whoever made the beer did an amazing job with the hops.  Overall just another great beer from Bear Republic, even if it does taste an awful lot like Sierra Nevada Celebration.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,RoyalT,4.6,"Appearance  This one is a beautiful cloudy brown in color and just clear enough to view the sediment floating around. The head was absolutely gorgeous! It foamed up quickly, lasted a while, and tried to leave a little lacing.  Smell  The lovely aroma of piney and floral hops are mixed with a bit of citrus and a hint of the promised rye. The fragrance is sharp yet balanced. Nicely done.  Taste  The balancing malt sticks its chest out just enough to balance. The complex hops from the nose come on wonderfully here, mixing with the subtle rye notes to form a symphony of flavors. This one does the almost impossible task of establishing a sharp, crisp, strong hop flavor then bringing it to the drinkers lips balanced and smooth.  Mouthfeel  Crisp and sharp yet refreshing and smooth. This nearly full-bodied rye-tinted IPA is a mouthful for sure.  Drinkability  When I partake of my occasional whisky indulgence, I usually go for straight Kentucky or Tennessee rye. This ale couples that wonderful flavor with a tremendous IPA offering. Hats off!  Update  Cvschaller brought an 04 vintage over to my place for a pizza party. I really do love this ADIPA. Its a unique and fully satisfying take on the style.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,dweideman,4.23,"On Tap at Anam Cara  Medium white head, mostly lasting. Clowdy orange-red hue. The aroma was mostly of the bittering hops with some sweetness coming through. Sweet beginning taste with the huge hop flavor coming through in the middle and at the end in a big way... Detect a small grapefruit flavor on the palate as it lingered in my mouth. Light to Medium bodied with a dry texture and lively carbonation. Wonderfully hoppy IPA style -- hopped to the extremes.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,PatandDavid,4.5,"Wow, this rocked in the bottle. I think I liked it even better than when I had it on tap. Pours a nice dark copper, with a very creamy head. Left sheets of lace throughout my glass. The aroma has to have been the piniest seeming beer I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. What I noticed is nice carbonation, actually a real tongue tingler (go ahead, just stick your tongue into the glass). It's almost all hops, but it's riding on a smooth malt base. Great palate cleanser. I liked this one! pat",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,aaronh,4.47,"Dark copper body topped by a thick tan head. A few ""floaties"" in the beer, but not too much. Sweet hoppy aroma, simialr to Stone Ipa or Two Hearted ale. The sweetness is more of a floral aroma. Overall very clean smell. The taste is very crisp. Nice malt backbone, strong bitterness, and sweetness from the malt, alcohol, and a little bit of resiny hop sweetness. Then that rye aftertaste blends very well with the residual hop bitterness. Hop burps start almost immediately. The mouthfeel is solid, very smooth yet not overpowering. Drinkability is very good for a 8% ABV brew. Goes down pretty easily. No need to share this bomber. Another very fine beer from bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,mikeys01,4.2,"I sampled my first bottle of Hop Rod Rye purchased on the East Coast (MA) this weekend, from a 22 oz bomber. Appearance is a nice deep amber with flashes of garnet. Aroma is robutly hoppy, but blended with waves of rye malt and a little grapefruity sweetness. Taste is sharply hoppy at first but is very mellowed immediately with very smooth malt and has a very nice dry finish. Leaves just little bit of lingering hop tang in you mouth at the finish....",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,rabidawg,4.3,"Appearance: Brilliant ruby with a nice, sticky beige head. Quite carbonated. Left tons of irregular lacing.  Smell: Very clean hop aroma, more evergreen than citrus. Nice rye spiciness in the background. Nary a hint of malt, and what's there is certainly drowned out by the massive hop aroma.  Taste: Initially tastes almost a little salty. Foams in a very uncreamy fashion in the mouth. Rye comes through after the swallow, fighting with and holding up quite well against the huge hop infusion.  Notes: This would be severly unbalanced without the rye, but I don't think balance is what BR was aiming for here. Great beer, possibly the most hopped I've ever had.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BeerResearcher,4.47,"It pours an old worn leather with a solid beige head and loads of lace. A strong floral hop aroma dominates while strong smells of rye crackers and whiff of alcohol creep up. This potent brew is just bursting with unrestrained flavors. Wild malt (6 row?) and edgy rye flavors are completely separate from sharp grapefruit, zesty orange peel, light lemon and a hint of metallic tanginess. A touch of toffee sweetness does little to counter sharp flavors, but that's ok. All of these sharp edged flavors are accompanied by a constantly noticeable alcohol kick. This beer is unrelenting in its wild character and never mellows or sweetens further, even when it warms. I love this stuff!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,goz,4.12,"Pours a deep mahogany, with a huge tan head that lasts, lacing very nicely. Aroma is big fresh hoppiness, slight smokiness, and maybe a hint of rye in the back. Flavor has a tinge of smoke, an even smaller tinge of rye, and a huge wallopping hop attack, very bitter, a little spicey, and lingering on just about forever. Medium to full bodied, lightl hints of alcohol on the 2nd half of the bottle. A tasty and large brew (maybe a RyePA?).",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,UncleJimbo,4.35,"Sampled on tap at Redbones.  This beer poured a hazy, red copper color with white foam that settled but left a thin head that coated the glass. The smell was very hoppy: grassy, fruity hops. There was also some malt aroma. The taste was very hoppy (grassy green hops and also floral hops) with a nice balance of sweet malt. There was a hint of oak in the finish. Not much rye flavor could be discerned. The mouthfeel was dry, smooth, and hoppy with medium body and moderate carbonation. The hoppy flavors lingered in the aftertaste. This was a very nice and enjoyable beer -- pretty much an IPA.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Jason,4.75,"On-tap at Anam Cara, stated that it was 7.7% abv  I have seen people say that it is 7.5%-8.0%.  Superb frothy head with an unyielding retention. Perfect clarity showing a deep reddish mahogany colour. Massive hop aroma, clean and pungent going from piney to grapefruit rind. A hint of spicy rye in the nose as well.  Lush crispness with a creamy back in the full body  I swear it was massaging my tongue. I felt the malt covering the palate but the hops are too much to handle  in a good way. So much hop flavour and the bitterness was spot on, when the beer warmed up a bit the spiciness of the rye came through as well as some caramel maltiness.  By far one of the best west coast beers I have had to date.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,CharlesRiver,4.25,"I had a couple of these on tap at 'Bones tonight.  Amber in color with a smooth creamy off white head that leaves a great lace. The smell is mostly hops with something sweet coming through. The flavor is actually very balanced for such a big beer. Starts out with apples and pears then the hops come in and stay all the way through to the aftertaste.  Kind of reminded me of a tame Arrogant Bastard? (I think that might be an oxy-moron?) Much more smooth with a creamyier, smoother mouthfeel. I would have this again anytime. I would also love to try the bottle version.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,LiamStLiam,4.13,"OK, second Bear Republic review of the day (already had the Big Black Bear Stout).  From one favorite style to another, stout to hop-head.  The first thing I thought was, ""wow, hops exploding on roof of mouth). The first rush of taste was as good as my favorite, Hop Devil.  After that, other tastes begin to push through, including the rye. Interesting, but not something I would drink a lot of. Didn't seem to sit all that easily.  Very tasty.  I thought the color was an amber, but folks seem to see this one in different ways.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,WVbeergeek,4.85,"Appearance: This one pours a copper ruby tone with something floating inside could be yeast could be hop particles and forms a decent thicket of cream toned head with brilliant patches of lacing spread thick and evenly. Aroma: The combonation of piney and floral hops blended with the rye are such a great combonation here, this is one of those classic beers buttery hops in your face but not over done what a great scent I would buy soap that smells like this if it was available. Taste: So much hop flavor yet not too much bitterness it's like they added hop extract or something to make the perfect blend of pine, this isn't all hops the malts make an appearance here they act as sweetened butter coated on lucious steamed hop buds with the rye here to accent all of the flavors this is by far the best rye beer I have ever tasted b/c they didn't try to make the rye the dominant flavor. Mouthfeel is medium in body but the smoothness of this beer going down is impeccable perfect amount of carbonation so easy drinking this one deserves awarded across the board. There is no hype behind this beer and by the quality and great flavor of this beer I am sure that the rest of the Bear Republic lineup in my fridge is going to be just as prosperous. A 22oz. bottle of this goes down effortlessly if this ever made in a keg to the east coast it would be first in line for my newly converted kegerator, awesome brew a hop suspension is going on with specks of hops floating but oh the joy that comes from sampling this beer, thank you to whoever brewed this fine nectar for the beer gods of blessed thee.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

This beer looks as good as any beer you will ever see. Pours beautiful 1"" head the nicest lace you will ever see. Clear dark bronze/copper color. This beer is hoppy. Either pale or India pale ale. I am ignoring the rye ingredient. Very strong hops some malt slips through. Leaves a velvetty mouth feel. Alcohol is not noticable until you drink this 22 oz bottle. Two Hearted Ale(Kalamazoo/Bell's) is the only one of this class I would rate higher. A fine beer.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Gueuzedude,3.98,"A deep amber color, with a cream-tan head. This beer is quite clear from the get go. It has a spicy hoppy aroma to it with notes of lychee and grapefruit. The first thought after taking a sip was that this beer is redolent of a hop syrup. This is all about the American hops. As for the rye, maybe there is a certain fullness/ silkiness fro the rye, but it is not all that evident, the hops overpower any taste that one might get from the rye character as well. This beer is big bodied though, and it is pretty good.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,SheepNutz,4.17,"22oz. bomber poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep brown color with 2 fingers of head. There is lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of rye, caramel, and hops. A nice full aroma. The taste starts with roasted malt and rye, fairly sweet and good, even though I'm not a huge rye fan. It's surely a lot better in beer than in bread. The finish is big and full of bitter hops, a very nice balance. The mouthfeel is very strong and heavy. The drinkability is also fairly nice for 8%. A very unique and nice brew.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,RBorsato,4.13,"Solid brown color (with fairly large pieces of suspended sediment), a nice tan/light brown head, decent carbonation, and big sheets of lace. Big hop and malt aroma. A big huge flavor of malt and hops -- an incredible balancing act. Hops are piney and sprucey. Not sure the Rye really stands out due to the bitterness. Medium-full (leans full) bodied, creamy, and smooth.  More of a big huge American IPA/Strong Ale (a la Stone Arrogant Bastard or Rogue Mogul Ale) -- I prefer the Hop Rod.

610,3158,johnrobe,4.62,"I knew this was gonna be a stellar brew as soon as I cracked it open. Familiar PNW hops citrus and pine wafted up in the air but there was also a spicy sweetness, like somebody just took fresh-baked gingerbread cookies from the oven. If you're expecting a wildly different brew you might be disappointed. At its heart, HRR is an IPA...albeit one with a twist. It pours a deep mahogany with a sticky beige head that lasts throughout consumption. I can't help but draw comparisons, and this brew is reminiscent of yet another outstanding beer...Great Divide's Hibernation Ale. Citric, piney hops are assertive in the taste yet there is a mountain of dark crystal malt providing balance. There is a slight spicy-sweet crackle in the finish...again, like sweet gingerbread. It's not too much to be cloying, but just enough to add some welcomed complexity to yet another IPA. This is easily my favorite brew of Bear Republic's respectable lineup.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,tavernjef,4.63,"Dark brownish amber of chestnut in color with a two finger high tight-whipped cream ivory colored top that never, ever fades, one absolutely beautiful glass of hoppy necture. Top gets crusty with smooth divets as it settles in. Eventually the top lays a perfect cloud of ivory puffed crustyness and the lace in super huge thick curtains, lots of curtains!  Aroma is deep dark dried hops that hints at pine and citrus, a good load of hops for sure, nice and piney with a sappy resin and airyness of pine needles thats nose fillingly awesome. A real nice backing of hard darkened rye and toasty malts with a touch of chocolate sets some nice noting.  Taste peels out of the gate with a smooth and soft roasty malts up front, thats quick and fast then it slams into high gear with a complex wall of full octain hops, alot of dried variants, crispy bitter pine, dried grapefruit peels, smokey caramel, buttery burnt biscuit and torched lemon, very leveled and smacked of great hoppyness. I barely detect the rye but I think it helps with the overall quick sharpness thats poking through in some of the first hints of bitterness giving it a boost like extra turbo. Zoom, Zoom,Yummy!  Feel is quite full and fully loaded with bitterness from just beyond the beginning; strong midway point and floats into the finish as the parachute opens with nice bitterness and a woody baked dryness.  You lucky bastards out in Cal. you've got it made. This stuff and Stone brews! Wow! What a treat it must be to visit your liquor stores? Great stuff!! It burns down the track and never looks back.

610,3158,freed,4.4,"Deep cooper color, nice ruddy hue, and a well developed head. Fresh grassy aroma from the hops, which almost convinces me I'm about to drink an IPA. Beneath the hop aroma is a nice tart malt smell.  One sip fills the mouth with a very nicely stacked malt profile with a light grainy flavor from the rye. Malt body compliments the bitterness very well, and the beer drinks quite easily considering its somewhat aggressive build.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Rumrunner,3.88,"22oz bottle. It pours a deep amber with tons of sediment. I decent head which disipates quickly and there is some great lacing. Like an archeological dig. Many layers. The scent is more citrus than rye. There is a malt carob smell as well.  A very citrus tang starts this ale off. The malt is there but the rye is very listless. I enjoy the flavor of this ale but calling it a rye ale is tough to accept. Side note: When I tasted this ale at the San Diego real ale fest there was more of a rye flavor. Which I really enjoyed as something different. Out of the bottle it is a very good ale but not a great ale and not much rye.  It drinks well and is enjoyable for what this ale is. Just do not expect a real different flavor because the word ""Rye"" is in the name.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,GreenCard,3.37,"Tasted at the Oregon Brewers Fest 2003 on 6/25/03...  Appearance: dark brown, thin sudsy layer of head, good clarity  Aroma: huge hit of grassy-green hops overpowers a very subtle malt thread and even more subtle rye scent  Flavor: the biggest flavor element is a bloom of piny hops (must be dry-hopped), the malt sweetness peaks thru the hops just before the dryish finish, hop bitterness is at a nice level, can't really detect the presence of rye  Mouthfeel: medium body, fine carbonation, slight astringency from the hops  Overall Impression: A bit disappointed. Good beer, but I'd like to actually be able to taste the rye. Sorry... the non-hophead strikes again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Quaffer,4.33,"22 oz. Bottle  Appearance: This beer was a dark amber color with slight hints of red within its depths. A creamy-tan head that was dense and pillowy rose up to two fingers. I took a long time to finally sink back down into the beer, leaving a fairly thick cap of foam floating on the top of the brew for all of the drink. It left a butt load of lace.  After awhile I noticed that there was stuff floating around in my glass. And not your typical yeast sediment type of stuff either. It looked like it could be hops particles. I wouldn't be suprised if that's what it was, considering the hoppiness of this beer.  Smell: On the pour, this beer smelled like pure, raw hops. Nothing more. After the brew settled down, a maltiness emerged on the nose combined with a light fruitiness. The hops aroma was still very prominent at this time as well.  Mouthfeel: On the first pour, it was medium-bodied with a lot of tingle to it. A very crisp beer. I was much more aggressive on the second pour, though, and the beer smoothed out a lot and took on a creamier character.  Taste: Upfront, there were some smooth, almost rich, malt flavors. Nothing overly complex, but still very good. Very quickly a good dollop of hops kicked in that had more of an herbal character that anything else. This bitterness lingered into the finish and long into the aftertaste. I know this is a little gross, but any belches produced by this beer had a very raw hop quality to them. Also on the finish was a chewy, grain flavor that I supposed could be attributed to the rye. I'm not sure, though, because I have tried very few rye beers before.  This was a great beer. Very hoppy and very refreshing. Even though the flavor was not too complex, there was a depth to it that a lot of bitter brews don't have. I only wish that I could get it locally so I could drink it regularly. Twenty-two ounces was not even close to being enough.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,beerguy101,4.5,"Dark Red color, medium head. A full bodied BIG ale, made with a ""truckload&amp"" of hops and 18% rye malts. Very malty and spicy. Full flavored. Complex taste. Malts and rye and over hopping combine to form a complex flavored beer. Smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Alcohol content is 8% but is not that noticable.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,BierReise,4.38,"This is one of those great ales that I find extremely satisfying. Reminds me of Rogues Brutal Bitter with the addition of Rye. Beautiful looking ale, dark and cloudy with a huge frothy head which completely laces every inch of the glass. I found this to be the case with every ale I've had so far from this brewery. Nice aroma of hops and malt, very rich. Full bodied and smooth with some bitterness. All around fantastic ale and one I'll look forward to again.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,JohnnyDuvel,4,"Another beer that fits firmly into the category of American IPA. Strong smell of citrus hops, quite hoppy, with a somewhat thin but oily body. I have had numerous beers now that fit this profile. Not much in common with English IPA's. This beer has a wonderful appearance, thick foamy head, dark amber color. Significant rings of lace, which stick firmly to glass. Great citrus aroma, the taste is there, but a little overpowered by the hop bitterness. This one ranks similar to the Rogue IPA in that regard. I still feel that Two Hearted acheives the best balance in this category. Still, this is an excellent beer, and certainly one all ""hop-heads"" will embrace.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Mark,4.65,"The one thing I find strange about the beers from Bear Republic is that I prefer them from the bottle. I have been to the brewery numerous time for lunch and brew and without fail the beers are always headless. Oh well, I might be making too much out of nothing. This bottled sample dusts the pint I had at the pub and it was right from a fresh batch. Deep amber, thick head, and rings of lacing. Sharp hoppy taste with the right amount of Rye. A very drinkable, exceptional, beer that is chock full of flavor and character. Bear Republic!!!!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,jcalabre,3.74,"Originally sampled on 8 May 2002. The rye makes this IPA unique. A light bodied medium brown color, w/ a great hoppy/rye taste.

A nice, small, off-white, dense head leaves thin sticky sheets of lacing. Two bubbles tag-team it slowly up through the deep red/amber beer. There's some fine sediment on the last pour.  Sweet, creamy, malty nose shows some raisin and promises hops. The front is dark, kind of bittersweet. Lots and lots of delicious hops in the middle, with a little tea, a little cream, a little grapiness. Some of the fruitiness survives in the hoptacular finish. Fantastic grapefruit rind burps. What a great, great beer. Hugely hoppy bitter, with some balancing sweetness.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,beernut7,3.65,"I have never had a rye ale with quite the punch of this one. Usually they resemble a more rounded mellow wheat brew. This one, however kicks the asses of all those others. Pours a heavy brick red with a thick foamy off-white head. Absolutely HUGE earthy hop aroma with just an edge of sweet malt. Initial spicy hops flood the senses paired with a malt that makes it best attempt to catch up but never quite makes it. The alcohol warmth sits in the back seat like the malt, but is there nonetheless. An earthy, grassy rye flush powers the flavors through a lingering finish",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94

Lush, delicious mouthfeel, and a lingering, long-lasting finish. Hops are emergent throughout, with the deep, dark, fruity, delicious flavor ringing through and through. At first, the hop attack is harsh and spiney, but ultimately this brew gets rounded out quite nicely. The notes I construct this review from are not perfect, they were scribbles and scratches jotted down while sharing this bottle with a friend. Rest assured, though, that it made an indelible impression on us both! Another great one from the Bear!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,MJR,4.35,"Appearance: Pours an alluring bright amber with orange highlights. The clarity is quite good, considering it's an unfiltered bottle-conditioned ale. The light tan head stays strong at a small cap. Great lacing on the glass.  Smell: Very aromatic with a ton of fresh hops. There's a sublte, spicy touch from the rye, and it blends well with the hops. Lopsided balance between the two distinct aromas, with the hops taking control. Far below them is a hint of alcohol.  Taste: The taste is very firm in it's bitterness, with a nice bite to it. The hop flavor is extremely fresh and green, with lots of pine, citrus (grapefruit), and floral notes. The rye stays way in the background, providing a subtle, spicy character. There's not much of a malt note other than the rye...maybe a touch of caramel from some crystal malts. This brew is all about the hops, with tons of bittering, aroma, and flavor hops in the recipe. The finish consists of...you guessed it...hops soaked in alcohol! Damn good stuff...  Mouthfeel: Medium in body with a really dry mouthfeel. Hefty alcohol feel on the finish.  Drinkability: This is an interesting brew. It's one of the few beers I've tried that uses rye as a considerable percentage of the grain bill. While it's strength prevents me from ever having more than one or two in a single evening, this is a brew I could drink on a regular basis.  Yet another fine ale from Bear Republic.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Bierman9,4.25,"This Hop Rod is painted a chestnut color, with a slightly dull finish, mostly clear, with just a hint of cloudiness. The roof is a tan hue, creamy and fairly thick. Lace-work is quite plentiful and attractive.  The exhaust on this is not too intrusive. A bit of grapefruity hops melds in with a malty sharpness (reminding me somewhat of the aroma given off by an Arrogant Bastard).  Bodywork on this baby is solidly in the medium range of craftsmanship. And it rolls smoothly down US Route T-2, the tongue-throat expressway.  The malt engine upfront is a bit toasty and yet spicy, too, with some caramel aspects. The rye gives it a distinct crispness,as well. The real power behind this one is the hop drive-train, Cascade-like in construction, though it doesn't bowl you over with too much hops-power (I was expecting more, from the bottle-notes). Despite that, the hoppiness lingers long and hard in the rear-view mirror.  It takes a few minutes to get comfortable in this Hop Rod, but after a few spins around the block you feel right at home.

610,3158,brakspear,3.5,"I enjoyed this rye twist on the now too typical high octane Westcoast ales. The rye adds something to the whole, a crispness perhaps, but there is something missing that I cannot precisely put my finger on...maybe the hops have numbed my brain.  The beer pours a deep brownish-red with a very minimal beige head forming and fading quickly, a collar hangs on for dear life with decent lacing.  The aroma is all citrusy grapefruity hop with a rye twang pulling up the rear...nice, not too sweet.  The taste misses for some reason, all the appropriate notes are there: hop bite, rye dryness, malt sweetness, but the sum is lesser than the parts. Perhaps it is because the beer seems too light-bodied for the hop load. Nice smooth finish though.  I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. It is also hard to believe that it kicks in a 8% alcohol. A nice beer for a change of pace, and I give it extra points for breaking the mold and using rye.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Winter,4.3,"22 oz bomber. Poured a dark garnet in color with a light tan head. The head levels to about a 1/4 inch, but remains throughout consumption. Aroma has a pleasant citrusy smell to it, akin to grapefruit. Hops dominate the nose. There's also a feint caramel sweetness that underlines the hop aroma. It's there if you search for it. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Hop Rod Rye goes down so easily. The taste is a complex and layered offering. Again, hops dominate the initial impression with flavors of pine and citrus combining for a pleasant bitterness. Typical Northwest hop flavor pulls through in the profile. The beer finishes with a superb rye flavor, that rounds things out nicely. I feel that the final rye statement really makes this beer that much more unique. Oh, and the 8.0% alcohol is masked so very well that you never notice it... until later.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,PhantomVodoo,4.2,"Somewhere between amber and copper in color with a tan head. Fair amount of sediment towards the bottom of the bomber. Big citrus hop aroma. There's something detracting from the aroma I beleive to be the rye (I am NOT a fan of rye).  Steady, yummy citrus hop bite. Sweet roasted malts and rye also play into the bold flavor of this beer.  Good mouthfeel. Very drinkable for a beer this heavily hopped.  Saw this as a new item at The Party Source and quickly snagged it. Hopefully we'll be seeing more of the Bear Republic around here. I very much dislike rye so I have mixed feelings about this beer, but I definitely hope to sample it again. It proved to be quite tasty and grew on me as I drank it.

Really can only detect the rye in the finish, which has a medium body to it.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Brent,4.55,"Poured a glowing amber-bronze. Big aroma of very sweet cascades hops. Since rye bread is strongly flavored, and this is my first beer with a substantial rye percentage, I expected it to be likewise strongly flavored and probably a little harsh. I was utterly delighted to find that the beer is exceptionally smooth. The flavor profile reminded me of SN Celebration Ale.

610,3158,TXHops,3.55,"-ABV: 8% -Malts: 18% Rye  Hop Rod Rye starts its doomed-to-be-brief life in my glass as a reddish brown, surprisingly clear (for an unfiltered beer), fall colored liquid sporting a pretty impressive, though small head of fine beige bubbles. A big pink grapefruit-orange juice aroma leads off the non-visual sensations. Theres a definite twang in the nose, but Im not accomplished enough to know if this is from the rye, or if the hops are inducing that aroma. The flavor is harsh, bitter hops, sweet and tangy malt and a lingering, assertive bitterness. To me, this beer tastes a LOT like SN Celebration with a shot of tangy, heat-inducing Everclear. The rye adds an interesting tartness that seems to be a catalyst for shooting the lupulin bitterness from harsh to puckering. A constant undercurrent of brown-sugary, sweet malt almost stands up to the painfully bitter finish, but not quite.  Ive only had 3 or 4 other rye beers, and none were brewed to this gravity, so its hard for me to comprehend if the harshness is being contributed by the rye, or if this beer is simply assertively hopped. Heres the bottom line: it tastes to me like Hop Rod Rye had a single addition of LOTS of American hops at the beginning of a 90 minute boil, and there they sat: losing most their flavor and aroma, while the whole time, more and more bitterness was extracted. At the same time, the liberal use of crystal malts created an interplay that I frequently find in big, American ales: harsh bitter. Im just guessing, so I dont know what really happened. I know Im wrong about the hopping schedule, because theres a good shot of citrus in the nose and I know I can taste some flowery hops underneath the other flavors. Plus, my burps reveal a wonderful hop character that I missed going down. This beer just exhibits a character that I taste too often in American, specifically west coast (Rogue and SN to be really specific) hyper-hopped beer: harsh bitterness. Having tasted 90 Minute IPA and Ruination, I know its possible to make a beer with over 100 IBUs taste extraordinarily hoppy and not be painfully bitter. In fact, those beers are two of my favorite all time brews. Oh well, they cant all get 4.5+ scores. Id rather have MANY other beers over this one. I guess Im kinda bored with tasting hyper-hopped beers that are extraordinarily bitter, but display very little hop flavor.

Tremendous palate, pine and grapefruit with subtle outright bitterness, raw hoppiness, noticeable rye notes all of these flavors balance perfectly then add in toasty malt, and a hint of cameral, for substance. The rye is more noticeable towards the finish, plenty of oily, foresty hops. Medium bodied with an appropriate mouthfeel. Pleasantly brawny hoppy aftertaste, long lasting, lingering dryness that begs you to quench your parched tongue and you gladly take another sip, youll repeat this over and over again.

The head resembles the clouds that you see when you are flying over a storm front in an airplane, and the lacing clings to the glass like a drowning swimmer.  The first taste is sweet, caramel, slightly smoky, and then the hops burn as you swallow. A round rim of something fruity, like cherry.

Leaving trails of smoking buttered breadiness and nutty rye skidmarks. The rpms are red-lined as the raw pine, citric hoppiness is nearly too much for the engine to handle.

These mild malt notes start off the flavor as well, but it's not long before the palate is overwhelmed by a huge blast of hop oil. The rye lends a lightly bready flavor to the beer which helps smooth the flavor out on the way to what is acually a very balanced finish -- ever so slightly dry, with nice spicy and piney notes which linger into the aftertaste.

610,3158,NeroFiddled,4.68,"Wow! This beer really knocked me out. Love at first sip! It pours a rich mahogany colored body topped by a densely creamy bone white head that holds quite well. The head eventually drops, but keeps a good collar and light surface covering - as well as leaving some excellent lace. There are some suspended particles of yeast & hop, but it's only slightly hazy beyond that. The aroma offers a light fruitiness, a gently sweet maltiness, and some sweetly citrusy/lightly piney hops. The body is full, oily, and quite creamy as it warms in the mouth, supported by a moderate and very fine carbonation from bottle conditioning. But the flavor is what really caught my attention! Richly malty with a toffee-ish sweetness, boldy fruity, lightly spicy, and well-infused with bold hop flavor and a firm, but balanced, bracing bitterness. It's quite unique. Although there's only a small percentage used, I guess it's the rye that really helps to give it its distinct character. There's certainly some caramel malt going on, but it also has a spicy edge to it. It finishes dry with a short burst of malt sweetness up-front, and then a long lasting mild piney hop flavor and bitterness.

Its all about Hops, for they are dominant, start to finish, but they are not overpowering, silkily introduced they seduce you between the sheets, before you know it, you have your pants off and Mrs Hop-Robinson has you in Bed. What a Beer (Bear?). Imperiously marvellous extremely drinkable Ale that I will definitely purchase again.  She-Cham-Beer-Leon. Sheltering its ego, it contemplates seduction and calculates its mastery, and then realizes - it really is that good. This beer has few masters. So, Forgive its conceited boasts.  I dont know about you  but after this beer, Im ready to go Street Racing ..Im just a bit worried about the skid marks in the morning!!!!",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Murph,4.89,Pours a great looking dark amber color with a creamy tan head that holds tight and rings the glass very nicely. Wonderful fruity/piney hoppiness as well as some nice sweet malt. The first thing to hit my tongue was the insane hoppiness of this brew. As the hops begin to back off there are some great fruity esters that give this beer a very nice complexity that is perfect for a fall/winter seasonal. The finish sees the return of the hops as they jump into the foreground again and stick around on the tongue for quite some time. Very creamy and crisp with the awesome hoppiness providing a light and refreshing quality to this brew that makes it extremely drinkable. This is just one awesome beer and I can't wait tot ry some more of Bear Republic's brews.,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,insomnboy,4.88,Tried a bomber of this last night for the first time. I really only have one word to say about the Hop Rod. Yum!!! I think I might have to go get a couple more for tonight. Cheers!!!,Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,sinistersteve,4.38,"Deep dark color nearly resembles the bottle in which it came out of. Nice looking head that seems to want to hug the sides of my glass. The taste reminds me of Stone's Arogant Bastard, but not as bastardly. The aroma is decent and warns you of what's about to pass your lips and invade the mouth. This is the second beer I've had from Bear Republic and, once again, I am not disappointed. These guys put out a great beer here.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Jordan,5,"Good god. Hop Rod Rye is royalty in peasants clothing. Assertive and mature hop/rye characteristics. A tricky trilateral balance between the three key ingrediants. Somehow this brew is able to maintain an equilibrium. The hops is undoubtedly seated top of the pyramid, but a keen sense can easily distinguish the awesome barley/rye essenses. Silky and lubricating mouthfeel. Notes of toasted barley, wood, resinous hop cones, and of course... rye. A prost to Bear Republic, undesputed brewery of the west coast.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,marc77,4.64,"Hazt, tawny, dark bronze hue, topped by an off - white head comprised of heterogenously sized bubbles. Excellent Belgian lace is left down the glass. Piney, grapefruity, resiny in your face Pacific Northwest hop 4 C hop nose (seemingly dominated by Chinook) hits the nose upfront, but dark caramel and toffee are discernible-- there's only a hint of rye spiciness towards the end of the aroma. Hop bitterness dominates as expected, but although very assertive, is quite clean & manages to allow spicy rye and the rich, toffeeish malt profile to surface. Meduim bodied, w/ a slick, proteinaceous, coating mouthfeel from the rye. Pine hop flavor. Finishes w/ a puckering bitterness that leaves me craving more, while seemingly out of nowhere biscuit malt eeks its way in. Hop Rod Rye is tremendously flavorful and rich-- it's not unlike Red Rocket Ale minus the roasted barley notes. Delicious.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,mickeymac,4.7,"It's bourbon color with a nice lasting head. The smell is the familiar northwest-style knock-out hops. I've never had a rye beer before, but it definitely has a unique and satisfying taste. This beer's a bit sweet with a distinctive flavor that balances out the sweetness. For a beer of its abv, it's eminently drinkable. It's good to see such nice beers coming out of the Golden State.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
610,3158,Bighuge,4.59,"An amber-/brown mix in the color. A frothy head that clings on the glass. A beautiful hop aroma. Very bitter. Nice bite. I like it. The rye is ever so subtle, but nice. A big beer. I'm really catching the NW hop varieties in this one.",Bear Republic Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Rye Beer,94
