39,131,Bluerabbitbell,4.19,"2/14/23 Happy Valentine's Day! Poured from a 12oz bottle at Pig and Fire BBQ in Washington, PA.  Deep clear, caramel black. Heavy tan head.  Aroma is bready, pumpernickel.  Taste follows above. Not overly sweet at all. Coffee overtones throughout.  Very nice feeling beer throughout.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Doppelbocker98,4.91,"Stands just hair above all the rest in doppelbocks. In my opinion, the best you can get in doppelbocks today.  Dark brown color almost like a red ale.  Smells faintly of a dark brown bread.  Heavy malt, but not overly sweet like you may expect from doppelbock. Still retains a complex graham-cracker quality despite being very malty.  May be the finest doppelbock that you can buy today.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,GrumpyGas,4.35,"330ml bottle ""L1062"" poured into a pint glass shows a deep, dark mahogany brown body, boasts a proud 2"" head of chestnut brown mixed bubbles that recedes to a persistent cap and leaves random spotted lacing.  Strong roasty, malt, maillard aroma flows directly into that classic dark roast flavor. A combination of bitter cocoa and coffee.  Lighter leaning mouthfeel is still full, yet neither creamy nor tongue coating, and a drying effect that clamors for more.  Overall a great dark beer in the classic tradition.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ChipChaight,4.21,"Bottle from Schaller & Weber on the UES NYC. Pours an opaque very dark amber/brown with a finger of off-white head that dissipates, decent lacing; smell is big, dark, candy malts, molasses, molasses cookies, molasses bread, vanilla, hints of smoke and wood; taste is dark candy malts, sweet brown bread, dark chewy caramel, sticky toffee pudding, hints of pumpernickel and licorice; feel is medium bodied, light carbonation, sweet.

Smells of dark fruits, caramel and sweet bread. Not a super strong aroma.  Taste follows. Malty up front with slight bitterness on the swallow.  Full-bodied. Slightly dry finish. Bit of a bitter aftertaste. Low to medium carbonation.  This beer is an absolute pleasure to drink.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

T - Toasted toffee caramel malt base up front with some nuttiness at the end a light to moderate bitterness starts to build well after the sip. (Think bready bread crust.) There's also some dates, figs, and a slight bit of charred toffee thrown in the mix creating some nice layers of complexity.  M - Big medium body that's bready and somewhat sticky on the lips.  O - Pretty much perfect for the style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,MikeWard,4.13,"On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter pa this evening.  Looks splendid in the glass deep dark reddish body. Off white head shrinks to a ring and covering, though no lacing.  Light aroma, sweet and malty.  On tasting, it is very sweet. Also full, rich, and smooth.  Mouth full, finish initially sweet, then a delightful light ashy roast cuts through the sweet.  Overall, lovely beer. May be too sweet for some, but not me. The finish is really enjoyable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,SLeffler27,4.56,"Dark brown in an old handblown pilsner glass (SRM 23-26). Murky mahogany highlights add intrigue, while 1"" of creamy almond foam gradually compresses over several minutes. A ring of lace decorates the top of the glass, while only a few spots are retained below.  The malt aromas are rich and alluring, with faint floral hops. Sweet, toasted sugar leads to dates and light mace, while raisin bread lingers in the background. Warmth brings out sweet black coffee.  The flavors build on the aroma, with charred sugar, dates and pumpernickel bread. Sweetness is less than expected from the aroma and in balance with roasted bitterness. The finish is full on pumpernickel that seems to last forever. Warmth amps-up the roasted malt, adds a toasted quality to the bread, while mellowing the already modest sweetness.  The body is medium to full, with a creamy texture. The alcohol feels about as labeled. Carbonation has an initial burst before calming to a light prickling sensation. Residual sugar builds on the lips.  Just as I sat down, an intense and sudden electrical storm roared through, enhancing the experience. Celebrator is the quintessential bread in a glass. I enjoy it most while reading and listening to expressive music.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

This legend pours a dark blackish brown with a fantastic head of khaki foam that settles to a thick ring, thick clumping layer, and sports some very nice lacing. Nose of coffee, brown sugars, raisin, subtle cherry, dates, and dark breaded malts. Flavors give it their all with dark raisin bread, coffee, brown sugars, cherry, and perfect toasted malts. Nice mouth feel; medium body, medium light carbonation, smooth, lightly coating, and finishing lightly sweet with a balanced malt note dashed with subtle hops.  Overall----a legend for a reason!

39,131,Luscious_Malfoy,4.45,"poured from a 330mL bottle into a willi becher pint glass. pours a fairly dark brown with almost three fingers of wet sand-colored foam. dark fruits, rye bread, hints of coffee even and some toasted malts. it’s robust and smells like a big beer, which i suppose it kind of is. a huge malt presence in the taste coupled with dark rye bread, raisins and coffee. this is not quite a sipper but it’s not refreshing or drinkable either. it’s rich, full and hearty. packed to the brim with flavor. a full, malty mouthfeel with a lower level of carbonation. this is a real treat. certainly far from a daily drinker but it’s easy enough to take down a small bottle or even 2 if the mood struck. really enjoyed this one and it’s been far too long since i’ve had this offering.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,defunksta,4.23,"Appearance: Pours a mildly clear (40% clarity), dark amber to brown color with a strong tan head. SRM of 19.  Aroma: Initially, strong bready aromas stand out upfront. Among them some chocolate notes. Hints of licorice, dark fruit, and caramel to support.  Flavor: Strong flavors of dark bread upfront. A strong dark bread yeast is present that gives a bit of bubblegum and bread spice. After this, getting more licorice, roasted black malt before a chocolate and caramel sweet malt finish off the end.  Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. Finish is malty, but relatively dry for the ABV. A bread spice and chocolate flavor linger.  Overall: A fantastic doppelbock. Honestly I haven't had a doppelbock that wasn't fanatastic. This one nails the flavors and probably leans more bready than the others, but hard to tell. Exactly what a doppelbock should be. Should probably compare to others to see if this one is truly better.

39,131,LanceBiggums,4.33,"Very dark, opaque, almost black, with a garnet tinge around the edges, and two fingers of light brown head that dissipates quickly - to be expected given the 6.7% ABV. The smell is rich and powerfully malty, with sweet dark fruits, caramel, chocolate, dark bread, and beef broth. The taste mostly follows the nose, but is not quite as strong, which I found slightly disappointing, but at the same time makes this beer more drinkable - almost dangerously so. The warming spirit alcohol is noticeable but unobtrusive, and wouldn't slow you down all that much from necking this stuff if you didn't know better. Overall an intense, complex, rewarding beer -in other words, par for the course for a Doppelbock, and another home run from Ayinger.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Joshhardigan,4.94,"Pours deep ruby with an enormous khaki head, which sticks around, and leaves quite a bit of lacing all the way down to the bottom.  Rich malty goodness on the nose. Almost a bit like beef consomme as well, which actually follows through on the palate. Good fresh baked brown bread.  Entry is semisweet, complex. The malt, the brown bread, that faintly meaty beefy note I always associate with bock style.  Feels good and heavy, just this side of overpowering I would say. Really stays with you, without that overhopped bitterness some bock, doppel or otherwise, can have. A real mouthfiller...  Overall this may be the ideal doppelbock, perfect expression of the style. I've been going back and reviewing a lot of old favorites, and I'm about to branch out into some of the more modern expressions, so I'm thinking of beers like this as setting the standard. This Ayinger has got a bit of a potent ABV, not so much as a Belgian ale or a modern IPA, but combined with that lingering aftertaste, makes for a pretty satisfying bottle. And I also think something should be said for the label, which may be the coolest label of any beer I can think of right now... Two goats (two goats get it?) rampantly celebrating a pretty large footed, dimpled glass of doppelbock... Truth in advertising! Putting this one up at the top rank with Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout as maybe the ideal expression of a variety.  As a side note, I'm old enough to remember when American Brewers like Pabst and Yuengling used to put out their seasonal spring bocks; in fact my grandfather used to bring a case or two of the Yuengling bock back in the trunk of his Galaxie, from our Easter trips to Pennsylvania, which was right around the time they seemed to release these beers back in the day. I remember the steel cans of Pabst Bock with the goats head on them...",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,AlexandraDen,4.24,"Pours very nicely, about an inch and a half head that dissipates quickly but leaves a lot of lacing. Looks very nice in the glass! It’s almost black, like a deep blood red but more opaque than some ruby red beers (like Guinness, which is a bit clearer)  The smell is malty and coffee like, with a bit of fruit, reminds me of dried cherries covered in dark chocolate. Taste is very complex, smooth and malty at first, like toasty graham crackers but evolves over time into a mild spicy flavourful mix of mild fruits, raisins, caramel. Very savoury beer! The mouthfeel isn’t exceptional but by no means bad, it’s very smooth with low carbonation — I think I got an older bottle.  It tastes how you want a beer to taste when you hear it’s a world class, complex beer. Some folks say it doesn’t linger on the tongue, but my experience was completely opposite. An exceptional double bock, with the caveat that I’m just getting back into beer and haven’t had many double bocks, it’s excellent amongst all beers I’ve tried!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Clear, extra dark brown appearance and large tan head with moderate lacing. Complex aroma of cinnamon graham crackers, caramel, toasted malts and dark fruit.

Luckily when I stopped in Half Time the other day, they had some relatively fresh bottles, so I knew I had to pick it up. Let’s crack it open and see if it earns its title  Pours a very dark brown with 3 fingers of light brown head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  It’s just straight up malty goodness in the nose here. I’m picking up on aromas of dark bready malt, toast, raisin, toffee, brown sugar, sweet caramel, and molasses  It’s pretty similar in taste, but it takes on a bit more of an aggressive taste. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting red grape, dark toast, herbal hops, apple skin, toffee, sweet cocoa, and a touch of smoke. The swallow brings notes of dark toast, molasses, burnt sugar, raisin, smoke, and herbal hops  A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a a rich beer. Finishes off dry  This is great stuff, a classic for a reason. I’ll definitely have to pick up more",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The flavor makes you slow down and examine it. Not as sweet as others of the style, but filled with nuance. Dark bread and toasted malt followed by raisin and charred fruit. The finish is perfectly, mildly dry with a pleasant lingering of malt. Moderate to low carbonation. I’ve had many dopple bocks and I love them- but this one stands in it’s own class as one to be savored and pondered. Very glad I picked this one up.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,md3kcn,4.9,"Purchased as a four-pack of bottles from The Cellar (Troy) for $11.99. Poured into a tulip glass.  L - Motor oil black with a mahogany-reddish hue when held to the light. A four-finger tan head. Laces very well. S - Rich malty character here. Stone fruit and bauernbrot. Molasses and a slight honey note. Hint of bran. T - Molasses and whole grain bread start us off here, and the beer slowly evolves into a heavily-emphasized medium-roast coffee and fig. The finish is dry, yet subtle; a sticky, bittersweet malt with raisin. F - Filling. Medium carbonation with a full body. Very drinkable. O - This beer holds a special place in my heart. When I was 16, I did a lot of research on beers out of curiosity, and fell down the rabbit hole. I couldn't wait to try this beer when I came across it online, and when my mom and I were shopping at a kitchen supply store, we found and purchased a single bottle of the stuff. When we got home, I opened the bottle and took a sniff. It was the most incredible thing I've ever smelled, and it smelled like a lot of things at once - all of them great. I was allowed a two-finger filled glass, as I was still a kid. I tried so hard to drink it, but I wasn't used to the bitterness of beer, so I couldn't finish the amount in the glass. However, it smelled so good that I couldn't wait to try it with a more mature palate. I digress from that memory to review it as I have it in front of me; a damn fine beer! Complex and well-rounded, as well as filling (like eating a mini-loaf of dense whole-grain bread). Very malty, but definitely not sweet. It's not too bitter, but it definitely ends up on the more bitter section of the spectrum. This is a must-try beer. I usually am only able to find this stuff around Easter, but I was lucky enough to find it in late July of all times! If you see it, buy it without hesitation.

39,131,Steve_Studnuts,4.43,"Man, that is one dark pour for something that isn't a stout or porter. Not black but just the deepest, darkest red, bordering on brown. Fluffy beige head sort of thins out to a ring. Minimal lacing, but does appear to be ""sticking"" around the margins - if that makes any sense. Nose is dark fruit and lots of it along with brown bread topped with caramel. Why? Maybe I'm a little stoned and that sounds appealing to me. Either way, my god this smells amazing. Tastes excellent as well. Sweet, concentrated dark fruit but with a bittering that doesn't really seem to come from hops. Or at least not fully. Bitter chocolate, perhaps? Slightly burnt brown sugar? Whatever; I'm grasping because I have a trash palette, but it's fucking tasty. You know what it's like? Coke if it wasn't so overwhelmingly sweet and had some kind of herbal bittering component. Mouthfeel is proper nice; soft, fluffy and far too chug-able. Great beer. I need more doppelbocks in my life. Especially ones that come with little plastic goats strung around the bottleneck.

Glad I did too, this is really good. Poured deep dark brown with reddish tinted edges and topped with a dense, sand colored head that refuses to go away. Beautiful beer. The aroma is very good, but I have decided my nose is somewhat less capable than many others so it may be awesome, I just can’t tell. The taste though, wow. Malty and rich indeed. I didn’t get the coffee or chocolate that some report but did get dark fruit with the malts and they blended amazingly well. No bitterness but no sweetness really either, impressive! The feel is spot on, what more can be said? Felt right. I plan on making this a regular offering in my beer fridge.

39,131,GrandpaMiltysMalts,4.7,"Picked up a 4 pack at Total Wine for $12. Total Bargain. God I love US craft beer competition that forces prices down on world class beers. 330 ml bottle, LO294 consumed 4'21. Poured dark brown, similar to cola or root beer, albeit with a creamy thick tan head. Poured a libation to the old man, like I always do. Wife's dog looks at me quizzically ""why U wastin' good beer?"" she askes with her head cocked. ""What do U know, you're a dog"" I respond. But she is happy for the next hour as I incessantly throw her the Chuck'it ball.  Let's just get to the money shot, the taste. Hint of caramel, without the sweetness. Waiting on the hops. Still waiting ... ""Beuller, Beuller ..... anyone, anyone?"" No hop flavor, but still balanced. How is this possible? About 4 sips in it hits me that the balance is through a dark chocolate taste that is more bitter than a 72% level chocolate bar. Genius. This is world class.

39,131,TommyG22,4.5,"Everything written about this beer is true. An enjoyable Doppelbock. I avoid bitter and stayed away from this one thinking it would be.

S: Stewed dark fruit. Plums and prunes. Semi sweet chocolate. Deep and substantial.  T: Chipper, semi-sweet dark fruit arrival. Dark breads on the development. Great balance between bitter, savory, and malty. A touch of noble hops pop on the finish, which is relatively dry and very bready.  F: Excellent! Medium bodied. The carb makes the feel fluffy or pillowy.  O: This is a sustaining meal in a glass without leaving your mouth sticky or your stomach full like, say, an imperial stout.

A pour creates a head as substantial as you could want.. pour carefully! The color is a beautiful, rich dark chestnut brown.. hold it up to the light and admire the beauty! The nose is a pleasant enough blend of earthy hops and malt, with a carmelized, vanilla / cocoa sweetness, The taste amplifies all the fragrant points, and they dance about your mouth, leading your mind to think of positive experiences, and beauty. Plus, a full, substantial mouthfeel, German engineered heavyweight bottles.. and the 'Celebrator Goats' that hang from the neck of each bottle look like they would form one hell of an electric tabletop football team.. there's a lot to ponder, when you down an Ayinger Celebrator.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Leaves wavy lines of lace, and later wide bands that merge together beautifully.  S: Deep roasted malts and fresh hazelnuts, a light toffee. Faint and fleeting notes of leather, toasted oak, and dates. The nuttier aroma picks up as it comes to temp.  T: Oh wow. The nose is really typical of the style, not powerful, and only slightly nuanced, but the taste is impressively rich and balanced. Definitely the best of the style by far that I’ve ever had.

A bit of treacle as well to add to the complexity.  F: Fairly dry but quite refreshing.  O: This is not your everyday DB, it's nowhere near as sweet as most Doppels and has much more going on with the bittering flavors to add depth.

The smell was very pleasant with coffee, dark fruit sweetness and a hint of yeasty bread. The flavor was amazing and quite smooth I thought. Right away you get a malty sweetness that isn't overly sweet but seems just right. There is also that yeasty, bready and dark fruit flavors much like was detected in the aroma. The aftertaste is of slightly bitter chocolate and coffee. The mouthfeel I was quite impressed with, very smooth, full bodied with medium carbonation.

It's also bitter just right. The carbonation is rather low, I wonder how it was brewed?  F: Wet finish. Would pair well with food. Or uhh... another Celebrator...  O: I love it.

The pour is fairly inactive, the head dissipates quickly and leaves a slight amount of lacing, that also slowly disappears. On the nose, it smells sweet and rich, in between toffee and figs with a hint of roasted coffee beans in there somewhere.  The taste is fantastic but maybe just a (tiny) tiny hair too sweet. With one or two, it's unlikely to lighten my enjoyment in the slightest however. I taste sweet caramel, toffee, ripe olives, roasted malts, and coffee-like bitterness at the tail end.

Bouquet: Cold, doughy malts and buttery, melted caramel with an almost unnoticeable backdrop of grape jam and squishy-ripe figs.  Feel: A velvety medium with carbonation so serene it just manages to tickle the tip of the tongue.  Taste: Caramel, stretched into a thin sheet and folded gently around the tongue. Ensconced within that slender, silk curtain of caramel are toasty malts and creamy cashew. An ample handful of authentic, Belgian milk chocolates awaits you at the finish.

It had a light khaki colored head with nice looking foam, but it had little retention to it.  The aroma was a mix of big maltiness and dark fruits. Notes of caramel, grapes, plums, and raisins filled my nose upfront. The alcohol in the aroma was definitely noticeable, especially in the back-end of the aroma where I got a noticeable ethanol aroma.  The taste upfront was pretty malt-forward like the aroma suggested. Notes of burnt caramel and medium roast coffee filled my palate in the front-end. The dark fruits that I mentioned in the aroma filled the middle of my palate, but these notes mellowed out to just notes of prune, a burnt caramel-like bitterness, and a toast-like bready taste.  This had a pretty soft medium body to it and a moderate amount of carbonation. This was pretty smooth and satisfying to drink.

I let it warm up to get all the nuances. 4.5 The mouth feel just crosses the line of being thick and is a tiny bit silky, a little creamy, and has a pleasant low level of astringency which is long lasting. 4.75 Overall, it's crafted with intention at every level.

Pumpernickel, fruitcake, molasses, dark cherry, candy apple, fig, raisins, prunes, bready yeast, carob/cocoa and tobacco. The aroma is a harbinger of a malt explosion.  The promise of the aroma is fulfilled on the tongue. The brew hits fruity-sweet on the tip of the tongue, with dark sugars and dark fruits as well as toffee and caramel. The mid-palate is hit with the toasted malt flavors, bread dough and yeast. It is here that the faint coffee, leather, and tobacco notes manifest The finish is an interesting meeting of slight booze, faint earthy hops, and soy sauce/brine.  The brew is medium full to full. Creamy, not sticky, with a touch of slickness. Limited carbonation but, for whatever reason, it isn't missed here.  An exemplary version, if not the paragon, of the style. Any markdowns are from a personal taste perspective, not ""faults.""",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

This is peak quality 'winter warmer' territory. F- Pungent depth, feels indulgent. The 6.7% fully comes through, no problem knowing this has that oomph. I don't notice anything out of place here. Becomes richer/a touch sweeter as it warms. One for me to slowly sip away on and savour. O- A superb beer, one I will buy again.

Smells of slightly roasted, bready, caramel malt, some dark fruit notes of fig, raisin and plum and lighter notes of chocolate, licorice and herbal hops. Taste is a perfect, quite rich balance of slightly roasted, bready, caramel malt and bitter, herbal, spicy hops, with some quite rich dark fruit notes of fig, raisin and plum, distinct chocolate and lighter notes of brown sugar, coffee, licorice and peppery spice. Finishes dry and bitter, with a very light sweetness and some dark fruit, chocolate and licorice lingering in the aftertaste. Full, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.  So is Celebrator truly the king of Doppelbocks? In a word: yes! What I love about this the most is its somewhat dry and bitter character, being a lot less sweet than most Doppelbocks, with a bit more focus on the roasted rather than caramel malts as well. While there certainly is some caramel and brown sugar sweetness to this, as well as strong dark fruit and chocolate notes, these are kept in check very nicely by some quite earthy, herbal hops and spice, with the licorice being particularly distinct here, while body and mouthfeel are outstanding as well.

The dark fruit is more prominent as the beer warms.  Mouth is full-to-medium-bodied, malty, almost chewy, with some carbonation.  The taste corresponds to the nose, bready, roasty with taste of bitter cholocate, rounded out by smooth dark fruit sweetness in the finish.

39,131,Thisdrinkinglife,4.3,"Review: 0,33l. Bottle of Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock: ABV: 6.7% vol  Nice brown bottle with a lovely old fashioned design and striking label, very nice. Also have a cheapish looking ornament, in the form of a plastic white goat, with it tied around the neck, which is a bit silly, but there you go. A goat of course representing the fact that it is a doppelbock.  On pour got a darkish brown coloured beer, almost black in fact with purple/reddish looking highlights, with a nice decent sized tan head, some good carbonation going on too, and overall the appearance looks pretty damn good. It all looks very appetizing, nice n frothy.  The smell is equally as good. Got a wide variety of smells, was very malty, got some fruity smells of raisins and prunes, and with strong hints of alcohol.  Loved the smell which was strong and pleasant on the nose.  Taste, got some nice creamy tastes and very filling mouthfuls. Nice hoppy aftertaste which can be felt at the back end, nice and manageable.  Can taste the fruits, and, of course, the sweet malts and caramel.  Nice enough, a slow burner and definitely one to relax with and sup.  If there was one negative is that I did get a little bit of dryness in the mouth. The alcohol is also well hidden, very well hidden.  It’s alright, is very tasty for sure and I got a fulsome feeling. A nicely balanced beer with a lot of flavours to be had.  On the second pint the alcohol was finally hitting me, got the beery taste. It is 6.7% after all, but it is manageable and not overpowering.  Over all yeah its a good beer, not bad and a nice and tasty brew, very drinkable and not very sour or bitter. Was a bit tipsy after the second pint, but it was easy enough to drink overall.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated and smooth. The finish is slightly sweet with a hint of caramel, yet not cloying as it is very cleanly lagered. Overall, excellent.

Sticky clinging lacing everywhere.  The nose finds a wonderful blend of sweet malts and dark fruits. Add to those some English walnut and raisins. Bready and rich. Some spicy notes.  Tastes of Heaven. Dark whole grain nutty bread combines with huge sweet malts and dark fruit. Maybe plum? Sweet. Touch of hoppy bitterness but still finishes sweet on the palate. Heavy body. Thick and chewy. Mild carbonation.  A wonderful example of the Double Bock style. The best I've had by far. World class indeed! Cheers!,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,Pantalones,4.34,"Finally getting around to reviewing this one; last bottle from the 4-pack, no bottling/best-by date that I could find but I know the beer store ordered these after I mentioned that they were out when I was looking for this beer specifically, so it should be reasonably fresh.  Pours a clear cola-like brown, looking darker brown (almost black at a glance!) once it's in the glass. Big head of light tan foam at first, shrinking to about half that size within a few minutes and then into just a thin cap on the surface of the beer with a thicker ring around the edge of the glass a few minutes after that. The beer is so dark that my little LED flashlight only barely penetrates it -- it gets through as some faded points of red light -- but shining it into the beer I can see some rising bubbles.  Smell is TONS of rich malt -- basically smells like some nice dark brown bread is sitting in my glass! I also noticed a bit of a frutiy thing on the end when I first took a sniff after pouring, but I'm not really finding that now. Maybe just a hint of a brown-sugary sort of thing in there behind all the bread, too. After taking a few sips, I'm noticing there's almost a sort of butteriness to the smell, which works well with all that bread.  On the first sip, taste matches the smell for sure -- loads of bread right away, like really nice whole-grain bread. Also a good bit of dark roasty/bordering on char flavors mixed in, somehow coming across as both fresh bread and toast that's a little crispy around the edges at the same time. There is A LOT of breadiness going on in this beer. Surprisingly dry -- other doppelbocks I've had were noticeably sweeter. About halfway through I'm beginning to pick up on that brown-sugary thing I noticed in the smell -- it pops in for just a few moments at the start of every sip, before giving way to the waves of bread that dominate the flavor of this beer. i think I may have just noticed a tiny bit of that fruity-ish thing I smelled early on, just for a second at the end of a drink. Lingering flavor after swallowing tends to lean toward the dark-roasty elements, with occasional bread and slight doughiness finding their way in, too.  Mouthfeel is nice -- right on the line between ""big gulps"" and ""little sips,"" so it works pretty nicely either way. There's a bit of a slickness to it, while not going so far in that direction as to be sticky from sweetness the way some other high-ABV dark beers tend to be. A little bubbly but in a pleasant way, no excessive fizz/prickliness... no negative features at all that I can point out really.  Overall, this is a great beer -- definitely glad I finally got around to trying it after all those trips to the beer store where I considered it, but then ended up trying something else instead. Plus, it comes with little plastic goat ornaments on every bottle (at least if you get to it fast enough -- I've noticed that the goats tend to go missing from 3/4 of the bottles in each pack when a 4-pack sits at the store for a while) -- how many other beers have THAT going for them??",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Red cherries, chocolate, toasted barley sugar (like cheerios), molasses.  T: lightly sweet arrival, turns toastier, then the molasses roast and sourness come through. Much less sweet on the palate than the nose, but still a sweet beer. Lingering clean lager yeast and malty chocolate.  M: this is where this thing really shines. Medium to full bodied, but somehow magically retains this crispness that makes it feel light on the tongue. Slick finish.  O: I have wanted to try this forever, and it was totally worth the wait.

Some legs are noticeable on the glass after movement. Strong malty aroma with dark fruit and hints of chocolate and coffee. No detectable hop aroma. More malt and dark fruit flavor and even stronger chocolate, creating a kind of chocolate covered raisin flavor. The dark fruit is definitely not overpowering, in fact the flavor is almost ephemeral: disappearing from the pallet quickly after finishing. No hop flavor is detectable. The finish itself is somewhat sweet but not cloying, with very low bitterness and a small amount of alcohol flavor. Medium full body with low carbonation.

39,131,bonns42,4.47,"12 oz bottle with the goat ""necklace"" poured into a pint glass.  Presents as a dark brown, nearly black, translucent liquid that appears to be roughly the consistency of milk. Puffy, off-white head fizzles away rapidly, leaving just a light lacing on the glass.  This one smells of dark berries again, much fruitier than the Troegenator. The aromas are noticeable from over a foot away from the glass. As it warms a bit, a sweet milk chocolate aroma starts to push through.  This is definitely more bitter than the Troegenator. Quick attack of fruit esters (blackberries maybe?), followed by dark chocolate bitterness and some roasted coffee notes that linger through the finish. As I drink some more, the bitterness fades a bit and is replaced by another flavor, like a mild sourdough bread, and some fresh green grapes, that cleans up the lingering coffee.  Feel is medium to thick, a little thicker than milk, with medium-to-light carbonation that gives just a bit of fizz in the back of the mouth. The feel lingers on the tongue for a while, along with some of that sourdough.  Overall, this is super tasty and way more complex than I was prepared for.

39,131,anon,4.36,"First off, I initially rated and reviewed this Sept. 09, 2013, when I was still a newcomer to the beer scene; that initial review rated this beer far lower than where this one stands and I believe shows how a pallete develops over time.  This time around; things start out nicely, deep Ruby hue with a finger-width head, reducing to a small pool of foam. Not much lace to speak of. Smell is all malt; sweet, nutty, bready, yeasty. Rich and flavourful brew; heavy caramel malt, toffee, raisin, fig, chestnuts, hazelnuts, light coffee, baked bread, cherries, so much goodness. Toasty bread lingers in the finish with sweet caramel candy.  Rich, medium body goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more. This excellent brew deserves a proper meal pairing. Simply one of the best, so glad to finally return to this when I can fully appreciate it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Jerseyislandbeer,4.52,"At Glasgow's Hippo Tap Room on Sauchiehall Street I spotted this on there bottled beer list. Great looking label, it pours beautifully with a brown/ black body and a beige head. Aromas of caramel & smoked malt. Taste is of caramel, chocolate, cocoa & smoked malt with a medium body. Aftertaste is of a smoked malty caramel. Outstanding Doppelbock, and one of the best beers I've ever tasted.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Indy8080,4.85,"Here is the top of the line of Doppelbocks in all around taste and quality. The other Doppelbocks just don't quite measure up to it. I buy mine at Kahn's in Indianapolis, where it is fresh with continuous turnover. I don't care so much about how a beer looks, smells, or feels. I just like the Celebrator taste, which is marvelous. It has a full body and well balanced ingredients. Most of the beers throughout the European countries are mediocre at best compared to many of our American craft beers, but not this one.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,cwalter,4.54,"Incredibly dark brown in color with slight hues of red. Supports a fluffy tan head about two fingers in depth. Hints of dark chocolate and coffee beans along with caramel in the aroma. Mouthfeel is a medium body. At the forefront of the taste is a nutty character, more similar to toffee than caramel. Then you get subtle waves of chocolate, vanilla and maybe a little oak. Towards the end you get a roasted coffee bean flavor with the lingering roasty bitterness. The toffee/flavor is slightly more predominant, but the flavors all mix very well and one does not completely overpower the other. Really great doppelbock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Beer poured burgundy brown with a nice white head that is leaving some lacing behind.  Nose is liquid bread, sweet malty goodness and dark fruits dominate.

Smells of toasted oatmeal bread and brown sugar, roses and vanilla.  Tastes like brown bread, molasses, chocolate caramels and dates. Finishes with a little burnt sugar-roasted chicory bitterness.  Feel is medium-thick and slick, meaty and chewy. Carbonation is vigorous out of the bottle but disappears almost entirely within a few minutes.  Overall, a super-satisfying, smooth-drinking beverage.

It was served in a Pilsner glass and I neglected to ask if it was ""vom Fass"" or ""Flasche"". I believe it was on tap. Very dark, slightly reddish color with a tan head. Great aroma of coffee, toffee, slightly spicy...obviously a lot going on here. First taste is all malt and a raisiny sweetness that immediately reminded me of a Beerenauslese wine I had drank the day before. Hard to find much hops presence other than the appropriate bitterness. I'll bet the IBU's on this are actually pretty high. Just overpowered by all that malt. Not quite as sweet as the Kulmbacher Eisbock I had on the same trip but definitely a little sticky.

39,131,hyperbolic_chamber,3.9,"First ever review-- fittingly, done for a classic. 11.2 ounce bottle, with no freshness date, poured into a pint glass.  Large creamy head that dissipates quickly with little to no lacing. Deep, ruby hue which is only visible at the thinnest part of the glass-- otherwise, completely dark.  Fruity esters and grape rinds with no hop smell noticeable. A sticky sweetness is driving this beer's smell, but not in a bad way. Hay-like malt underneath it all.  Alcohol hotness is forces its way to the forefront, followed closely by a raisiny sweetness and plum, but then again with the hotness, which becomes almost rum-like as the beer warms. Heat and raisin collide in a way which is reminiscent of a cinnamon raisin bagel. Definitely a predominately malty beer, with a tad bit of noble hop presence if you really are looking for it. Some cola beneath it all. Big, loud, and chewy flavors at all phases.  Thick and creamy, with a denseness that lingers once the moderate carbonation is long gone. A meal in a glass.  This beer is sweet, hot, and not the cleanest; but somehow, these generally negative attributes meld perfectly to create something exceedingly nice here. Truly a one of a kind brew. This beer is the well-deserved flagship of a style which doesn't get enough attention.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,911CROFT,3.95,"330ml bottle into a small weizen glass. Paid £2.70 for a single bottle.  Pours a dark, almost opaque, mahogany body with plenty of red highlights near the edges of the glass, small amounts of fine streaming carbonation become visible when held to the light. A two-finger in height, dense, foamy, tan coloured head quickly reduces to a thin film and collar, leaving behind small amounts of soapy lace.  The rich and robust nose primarily comprises of dark roasted malts and lightly sweet fruity esters. Very faint hop bitterness and traces of alcohol are also detectable in the background. Taste follows suit. Sweet, dark, bready malts and dark fruits combine to lead the flavour profile upfront. Raisin-like sweetness transitions to complex roasted profiles around the mid-palate, as subtle hints of dark chocolate, roasted coffee and nuttiness develop. Towards the finish, mild, dry, roasted bitterness and subtle woody, herbal and spicy hops expertly balance initial malt sweetness. In the mouth, a medium to full body and soft carbonation give a luxuriously smooth and velvety feel. Lingering roast and hop profiles along with touches of alcohol warmth give a long finish, drying the palate to become lighter and crisper towards the end.  Overall this is an excellent beer. Hugely complex, beautifully well balanced, and both rich and malty but still crisp, dry and easy drinking. Recommended.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,Beginner2,4.39,"It is hard to argue with near-perfection. The figgy, nutty Smells, the opulent malty Tastes that does not attenuate too sweetly and the soft, luxurious sitting on the tongue is all something that does not last long enough and should happen more frequently in a better world.  Celebrator is the most celebrated doppelbock. (Double the number of BA ratings of the style's #2 and comfortably ahead of its competitors' in average rating.) As such, it is reviewed and praised in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic"" 300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"" It also is reviewed in the ""1001"" and most certainly deserves to be on the list. The reviewer had a great descriptive phrase that the beer had ""marzipan moments"" which explained well the late bitter-sweet palate to me. The reviewer also remarked that Celebrator was created in 1982 with the U.S. market in mind and got popular here before Bavaria. (Credit Merchant duVin for this and its many other imports that elevated the game of the then-nascent American crafters.) Penetrating our market explains Celebrator's dominance.  But sealing the deal is MJ's 1999 ""Guide"" -- while giving it only 3 of 4 stars -- his words over-flowed his cup: ""This outstanding example of the style is a beautifully balanced beer. Its figgy, coconut-like sweetness mellowing out in a long, spicy (cinnamon? ginger?) finish."" Note the parentheses are his (or his editors) to connote that subtleties exist that sentences should not attempt to describe ... and, I believe, this is a practice that seems lost on this century's interactive reviewers... including me, when I fail to make the effort preciseness.  11/22/18 Returned to an old friend to gird me for Thanksgiving dinner with my siblings. I even saved some Celebrator for pecan pie. No Bavarian roasts malt like Aying. Lots are trying. Very, very few will come close.  2/19/19 First of yet another 4-pack. Despite having six Aying beers, I went on their website for the first time and see they have not only a high-tech modern brewery, but a beer hall with food and even a hotel. They talked about beer as more than ""liquid bread"" but also a ""social cement."" I'm going to Munich in early May for a few days, and showing such cultural insight, I really want to visit Aying for lunch. 4/27/19 ditto as I prepare my research for a Place review.  5/20/20 Got to Munich a year ago, but didn't have time for the train ride to Aying.

It has a rich, complex flavor featuring roasted malt, molasses, raisin, caramel, and burnt coffee. The flavors blend beautifully. There is only the slightest hop presence and virtually no bitterness. The feel is creamy with only slight carbonation and with an ABV of only 6.7% it is incredibly easy to drink.

The first one I had I did not know what to think because the overwhelming initial malt smell almost made me sick to my stomach. After getting over that and trying the beer; just pure greatness. To me it tastes like a sourdough raisin type hybrid. It is a strange beer: I could chug the entire thing no problem it is that easy drinking; but then when you sip it slowly the rich flavor really comes out. One day will get to Germany and try it fresh (if that is a thing). Do yourself a favor and put down the overhyped imperial double IPA that tastes like cheap booze and get one of these bad boys.

Beer has a decent amount of carbonation, very light feel to the beer, very drinkable and hides the ABV quite well.  Overall a really good doppelbock, supremely drinkable and very flavorful.  Revisited 2/4/16. No metallic taste, incredible flavors, lovely beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,Libeertarian,4.26,"From notes taken 03/13/16:  Clear but very dark red-hued brown, fairly viscous. Head is creamy and fine-bubbled. Only moderate retention at first but leaves a film for the duration. Smells like dark fruit, especially dates, but some berry suggestions as well, lots of brown sugar, a little molasses. Toffee, dark fruit, molasses, anise, toast to the taste. Any hops in this are all but lost in light roasty/smokey character. Booze is well-disguised, even when it comes to warmth. Full-bodied, syrupy, loaded with fine suds, velvety.  Very good beer, probably the best Doppelbock I've tried so far. So good I went out and bought some more less than a week after making my initial notes. Alas, the one I reviewed here was a 7.1% ABV and I probably had it for a year already, whereas the new ones are all 6.7% and fresh. Not anywhere near as good, I've already tasted one, will review one of the next three in an update to this review. Not awful either, fortunately.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,EricVonStein,4.25,"Nice dark amber colour, big bubbles and a one finger tan head that looks like its still fermenting.  Big malts on the nose, lots of molasses and pumpernickel, black licorice, leathery.  Taste is almost exactly like the nose, dark rye malts are overpowered by black strap molasses, definite earthy hop presence to provide some balance. Lingering anise and herbal bitter touch at the end. Plenty of warming reminiscent of a Jager shot.  Nice bright carbonation keeps the powerful flavours dancing around and feeling light. Feels like a medium light body and doesnt leave any film on the tongue.  As advertised, big malt flavours with the warm booze of a dopple bock. This has a very distinct molasses and black licorice character that sets the Aying apart. Not exactly a flavour I love but works well enough together with the rest of the flavours.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

I can't find date info.  S: [3.75] Caramel, toffee, tobacco. Lots of sugary malt aroma.  T: [4.00] Follows the nose with more caramelized malts. The caramel flavor is smooth and not overly sweet. More toffee (but no tobacco). Has a complex brown bread flavor.  M: [3.75] Creamy and smooth with medium body. Has a hearty malt finish.  O: [3.75] This is a nice robust beer. Hearty malt bill all of the way through. The mouthfeel steps up the beer another notch. I really like this one, compared to other German styles. Lots of complexity. Good malt bill.

You will come across these descriptors again and again when reading reviews of this beer, because they are apropos. There's a wonderful pumpernickel bread quality to the malts, with a kiss of that palate drying caraway-like sourness that elevates it to a world class level. This is one of the best dopplebocks I've had, likely one of the best there is in the world. It's a reference beer for the style. Curious about dopplebocks?

Luscious. Some might call syrupy, but carbonation is perfect. O: Drink this beer. It is good and wholesome. A classic that isn't overpriced and is approachable to even people who may not think they like beer.

Tastes of chocolate coated raisins, burnt brown sugar, faint cold coffee, ripe banana and more mild baker's chocolate. Faint leafy hops.  Feels soft and smooth.

AROMA: Very sweet malt, cocoa, milk chocolate, slight crusty, bready, sourdough bread, and a little bit grassy. TASTE: Just as aroma. Sweet, with all of the flavors from the aroma and a nice little bit of bitterness to give it a bit of balance. A slight grassiness. FEEL: A little slick, oily, but finishes more on the dry side. Carbonation level is average and adequate. OVERALL: A very pleasant DB, no doubt. I find the Weihenstephaner DB a little less sweet and more balanced. This one is slightly too sweet, for me, but not cloying. Nevertheless, a great brew.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,akdo,4.88,"Look: The beer has a dark brown body, a two-finger mocha head and a copper leg. Of all the German beers I have tried, this one has the best head retention. It recedes to a layer of a few millimetres. By the time one is about to finish drinking the beer, the head will have a few small holes.  Smell: The nose has a mild note of malt. It is a tad reminiscent of chocolate milk. There are no trace of hops in the aromas.  Taste: The palate is almost a replay of the nose. It is very malty and because it is dark, it has a slight toasty taste which makes the beer taste like a toned down Schawzbier. The dominant note was that of caramel, chocolate milk and dark fruits. True to the style, this beer was neither bitter nor dry on the finish.  Feel: The beer is light-bodied and is not astringent. It has a juicy feeling and it is fresh. The warmth of the alcohol can be felt, but it is very low. It doesn't burn the throat. There is also no carbonation.  Overall: This was love at first taste between this beer and me. Despite having an ABV that is comparable to an IPA, this Doppelbock's alcohol is barely felt. Moreover, this is one of the few beers I have tried that comes so close of being to style as per the guidelines of Beer Judge Certification Program.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Taste: Cherries, chocolate, slightly bitter. Little hint of booziness. Very complex and very tasty.

Aromas of dark fruits; plums, figs, some breadiness, cocoa.  A sweet malty body up front gives way to a slightly subtle sourness, for lack of a better descriptor, that doesn't last too long. Tastes like a dark chocolate covered plum or prune. Very tasty.  Medium to full mouth feel, has a lovely velvety smooth feel to it.

Mouthfeel: Light carbonation with heavy body. Overall: One of the best beers that I have every tried. An absolutely delicious beer that does not overwhelm the palate.  Ironically, while vacationing in Munich, I visited the Ayinger Brewery, and while there I asked specifically for this beer (after reading its glowing reviews on Beeradvocate.com), but they told me it was not the right season (I was there in August), and they do not serve this beer until early spring.

Body is very dark, almost black; light is allowed to pass through though and reveals deep crimson red highlights along the edges of the glass. The head is a light khaki color, thick and rocky, that quickly recedes to a thin ring. The nose is very inviting, notes of dark toffee, prunes, dried figs, cocoa, roasted chocolate malt, fruity yeast esters, brown sugar, and toasted tree nuts. The mouth feel is excellent, lots of carbonation, pleasant malt flavors with no bitterness and a clean aftertaste. The taste is all malt, sweet complex notes of caramel, toffee, cane sugar, molasses, chocolate, and dark fruits. The yeast rounds everything up nicely, blends it all together flawlessly.

Has a velvet mouthfeel to it, with a medium carbonation and a silk, malt defined smoothness throughout.  Tastes of burned toffee, molasses and caramel, outstandingly well balanced by bitter, dry earth. Its bitterness reveals coffee dregs among an herbal, leafy dryness. Adds a soft dried fruit quality to the flavors, with rock sugar creating a short, sweet peak after the swallow. Nontheless, its world class mouthfeel maintains, due to an aqueous quality soothing the sweetness, creating a transition for the well nuanced bitterness, slowly developing from its earthy foundation. This enables a clean finish, with a brief, toffee coated finish.  Quite complex and pleasantly challenging, as the beer denies the palate to drown solely in sugary malts.

Boy, was I wrong. This Ayinger Celebrator was an experience unlike any other. Served in a goblet, it had a black but still appealing hue of darkness, a decent head, but little staying power (admittedly something I easily overlooked). The smell was not necessarily anything that was memorable, but it didn't have any of the other ""heavy"" odors of dark beers. The feel was truly smooth, silky, and easy to be sessionable. But what simply blew me away was the taste - by God - I can't say enough about it. It was unlike any other dopplebock I have had. If given the chance I would probably drink this stuff for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (but I suppose it's a good thing I don't.) Overall, it was by far the best beer I've had in a very long time, if not the best ever.  UPDATE: 12 August 2016 This is still the best damned beer I have had to date. And now, after having as many as I have had, I can tell you there is a hint of honey to the brew. So not only delicious, but a hint of sweetness to it. Damn, the Germans really know how to make beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The appearance was a moderately hazy mostly dark brown color with a nice looking almond color-ed two and a half finger-ed head. Lacing speckled nice and thick in the wake of the head. The smell started off with some sweet caramel malts, a light dose of nuts, some dark fruits, molasses, cocoa. The taste copied the smell pretty much spot on with a sweet bready aftertaste and finish.

This beer poured dark brown with a khaki head. Smelled of bread, malts, slight chocolate, and faint hops. Taste is where this really got interesting. The hops were faint if at all noticeable. I got bread, raisins, dark fruits, bread, malts, and slight chocolate. The taste was very intriguing and very enjoyable. The complexity on the taste really impressed me. The carbonation was just right to make this very very smooth. I did not pick up any alcohol. I am really impressed by this heavy beer and it is downright almost chewy.

Foam dissipates slowly, thick coating of lace. The smell has lots going on, dark sweet malts, a bit of smoke or light char, some fruitiness as well, prune and plum. Touch of alcohol, that also comes out on the palate. Flavor is rich and full, dark plum fruit, sweet malts, hint of smokiness, then just at the end some hop bitterness comes through. A bit nutty, maybe even chocolate flavors develope as it begins to warm. Not overly bitter, but just enough to keep everything else in balance. Very complex, but still smooth and drinkable. Lots of deep flavor, almost like a quad, but still light and refreshing so you don't feel tooo full. Worthy of its ""World-Class"" rank.

An opaque brew (seemingly black) with vinous red highlights around the base of the snifter in the light. Rich and malty on the nose, opens up to some nice dark fruits (plums, raisins) and hints of tobacco and light chocolate notes. Nice, but really had to work on the 'smell' portion here. Just a hint of tartness up front on this one, moving into the dark fruits which came in as some nice cherries on the mid, and alcohol warming noticeable. Aftertaste actually brings up more of the malty and chocolatey notes sneaking in. Nice coating mouthfeel and creamy carbonation. Drinks like a bigger ABV beer.

Lacing is wonderful as it is in abundance and adheres to the sides of the glass. SMELL: Has strong aromas of caramelized malts that entangle with mild roasted malt, fig, and plum aromas along with a hint of spicy hops. TASTE: Intial taste is of strong caramelized malt flavors with a hint of alcohol. Mild roasted malt flavors and subtle spicy hop flavors enter immediately after the initial flavors. As all flavors persist in strength, subtle fig and plum flavors complete the 3rd and final act of flavors about 3 seconds after the initial taste. FEEL: Full-bodied, subtly carbonated, with a thirst quenching finish that sticks to the back of the throat. NOTE: I love, love, LOVE, how the alcohol was barely detectable.

S: Pumpernickel bread, toffee, prunes and raisins, wet coffee grounds  T: Toasted wheat bread, graham cracker, molasses, prunes, wet coffee grounds. Finish is like burnt sugar, dark sweetness that leads to lingering bitterness. Super elegant and complex for so much malt.  M: Light to medium carbonation, really decent chew to it. Not imperial stout chewy, but definitely full bodied for the style.  O: I think it lives up to the hype. Back of the bottle says ""DARK, MALTY, AND RICH"" and that's exactly what you get. But more. This is like a loaf of bread at an artisinal bakery or chocolate cake from a high end pastry shop.

39,131,BeerConny,4.76,Exceptional beer! I gave the smell a 4 only because it is not very strong but as other people have mentioned before.....we are not drinking this for the aroma. Doppelbocks are similar to stouts except they are not as bitter and they are more sweet. That is how this beer is. Wonderful taste and a good creamy mouthfeel. I can hardly taste any alcohol. Great for colder months. Though mine was 7.2 abv and this says 6.7. What gives?,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Toasty and oaky flavors come through with subtle notes of dark dried fruit in the end. Heavy and creamy on the palate with a slightly dry finish. This beer's flavors balance nicely with its alcohol content. After the first couple sips the strong toasted flavors make way for more of the noticeable hop profiles.

Moderate bitterness on the finish  Overall: Being a fan of good American porters and brown ales, i highly enjoy this as i find some similarities. The dark fruit, light chocolate and vanilla, caramel, toasted grains, etc. The taste actually reminds me of a weaker version of Dogfish's Palo Santo Marron.

A dense knitting of tan froth for a head, and a very, very dark body that betrays hints of rich ruby to the light.  It smells of raisins, cherries, vanilla, and chocolate. The chocolate is actually fairly pronounced. Definite ripe banana, too. You know what? It kinda smells like an ice cream sundae!  Dark fruits such as prunes and the cherries and raisins come out in the flavor, then the vanilla and chocolate. The finish is malty, yeasty, a bit earthy, and reminds me a little of chocolate milk! Delectable.  Really nice feel going on. Smooth, creamy carbonation and a seamless yet fairly thick consistency.  Truly an exceptional example of a most malt-forward style.

Feel- Medium bodied, medium carbonation, almost creamy texture, and very smooth in the finish with a very pleasant lingering malt presence.  Overall- This is definitely worthy of being regarded as one of the best doppelbocks out there and beers in general.

39,131,JohnnyI,4.6,"Poured from an iconic 12 oz. bottle, complete with miniature plastic ram, in to a small glass mug. The assertive carbonation yields a massive, mounded head of foam that resembles an oven-rising baked biscuit. The beer has a deep chestnut brown appearance with tawny accents. It smells of fresh-baked whole grain bread and a vague notion of sweet nuttiness. Earthy accents of soy sauce and molasses are present in the nose as well. The flavor is very malt-forward, but steers well clear of the cloying sweetness that so many other malt monsters convey. There's some dark fruits, with hints of subtle tart black cherry. A mild earthy hop profile perfectly accentuates the distinct Bavarian flavors. Suggestions of smooth, sweet dark coffee and minerals linger in the aftertaste. The texture of the beer is phenomenal. Rich and creamy velvet perfection. Oh so easy to savor. For such a hearty beer, this is sooo easy to drink. It's simply a masterclass. I've yet to try a dopplebock, foreign or domestic, that I put in the same league as Celebrator.

39,131,HattedClassic,4.51,"The beer pours a very light head that takes a bit to dissipate. The head is a dark tan color with a creamy texture. The head does not completely dissipate but leaves quite a bit of presence on the top of the beer. The beer itself is a very dark caramel brown. The beer might appear to be black but rather a very dark brown.  The beer smell is hoppy with a deep and luxurious caramel malt smell. The hops add a bit of bitterness to the nose and has a deep contrast with the lighter caramel notes. The ops are fairly sharp and crisp. No floral or complete domination but quick and to the point. The caramel notes are pretty big but the hops seem to steal the show here.  The taste has the same notes but the caramel notes seem to be the stronger of two notes. The caramel taste seems to be very strong and dominate the taste while the bitter hops act to contain and reduce the sweetness of the caramel flavor to make it more drinkable. Overall, the beer has a nice caramel taste with a crisp hoppy finish to it.  The mouthfeel is extremely smooth and thick. Given the fact that the beer is malt heavy, this is not surprising. The beer is extremely smooth from the beginning to finish.  Overall, a fantastic doppelbock and worth getting. My only problem is that it's expensive to get.

39,131,EOsborne,4.54,"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a large snifter.  A - Pours a dark, chocolatey brown with a thin tan head. Despite the darkness, it is crystal clear, revealing lovely orangey-brown highlights not unlike cola. The head subsides quickly, and there's little to no lacing, but it rouses nicely when swirled. Looks very luxurious in the snifter.  S - Wow! This may be the most heavenly smelling beer I've ever had. It leads with a rich, complex breadiness, like a toasted pumpernickel. The overwhelming caramel aroma that characterizes many dark beers is subdued. In its place is a bountiful, savory bouquet - a whole meal's worth of smells. There's buttered bread, roasted meat, dried fruits, dark chocolate. It is hard to smell this beer without imagining a feast fit for a king.  T - After such a delightfully busy nose, the flavor is surprisingly straightforward. Dark chocolate and coffee with cream dominate the palate. Oak, vanilla, and subtle, earthy hops lurk around the edges. I was surprised to find the finish very dry and a bit savory like the nose (the syrupy sweet Salvator had me convinced I didn't like doppelbocks for far too long). Where the aroma is beguiling, the flavor is reassuring - a sort of confident, robust answer to the questions posed by the smell.  M - There is a medium thickness somewhere between a brown ale and a stout. The relative lack of carbonation lends an oily slickness, and yet it remains crisp. It lingers for a moment on the palate, then dissipates, inviting you to take another sip.  O - I received this beer as a Christmas gift from my brother, and after one sip it emerged as the most memorable gift of the season.

Wonderful aroma reminds me of coffee, dark slightly bitter chocolate, and sweet earthy grains. Taste aligns with aroma and includes an aftertaste that is creamy and with a tiny touch of hops. Furthermore, there is a mild alcohol aftertaste like a dark dessert liqueur. Great feel; carbonation light but tingly on the tongue when served cold.

I come from a place of favoring strong dark belgian ales and whilst I do understand that this is not that, I feel as though it attempts at least in some sense to support the fruity flavors it claims to carry but the yeast does not do a very good job of it, this is a malty, malty, malty beer. It very much tastes like a generic porter or stout with dark fruity notes at the back of the take, but the strongest flavor is the roasted malt, which dominates the beer  mouthfeel:crisp but a little thick, not bad in this regard  overall: not aweful but if you're in the market for something like this, you can certainly do better.

39,131,MaximalC,3.91,"Pours seal brown with a moderate khaki head that soon settles into a thin, frothy veil. Mild aroma smells of caramel, brown sugar, molasses, milk chocolate, and green Bavarian hops.  The taste features a kick of big-time roasted sweetness up front with just the right amount of grassy, earthy hops to balance. The malt character is the headliner here, with a robust blend of molasses and brown sugar that is inescapable. Hints of milk chocolate and smoke add an additional layer of complexity. Shades of acetaldehyde suggest candied apples with sufficient warming. Zippy carbonation cuts through the sweetness and maintains the closest thing to a crisp, dry mouthfeel one could hope for in a doppelbock. Plenty of sticky residue coats the lips between sips.  Celebrator lives up to its reputation as THE doppelbock. The sweetness is big and complex without being overbearing, and the bitterness and mouthfeel lend excellent contrast while still allowing the malt to shine. This isn’t my favorite style, but Celebrator is the best representation of the style I’ve yet encountered.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,MikeKnauf,5,"Poured from bottle to snifter.  Dark, dark walnut brown with very small, creamy head.  Smells kind of like molasses.  Taste is a lot like the Ayinger Dunkel, but stronger. A bit sweeter. Dark bread, molasses, coffee. I found it to have a nice bit of bitterness in the finish, more than some of the others would suggest. It really needs it to try to balance the heavy malts up front.  Mouthfeel is a bit heavy, bordering on a warm syrup, but not burdensome to drink. Carbonation is light and subdued.  Overall, like the Dunkel from this brewery, it's my favorite in the style. The Dopplebock seems to get a bit more praise but I feel the similarities through and through. It's a perfect pre-meal in a bottle on a cool autumn day. Love it!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,UrbanCaveman,4.29,"12 oz bottle, poured into a tulip at approximately 45 degrees F.  A: Pours like a heavy molten caramel, and settles into the glass a deep, rich ruby brown, like a well-worn bit of mahogany furniture. Holding the glass to daylight reveals burnished copper-bronze highlights and the faint shadows of fingers on the opposite side of the glass, with bubbles streaming merrily by. The head is impressively thick and foamy, a beige color, which leaves rather persistent and thorough lacing down the glass.  S: Warm baked bread, sprinkled with crumbles of toffee and drizzled with sweet caramel, open the aroma. Lurking beneath the malt bouquet are some fruity notes, like currants and dates with a suggestion of plum. The nose is yeasty, malty, and warm.  T: That is, in fact, a liquid loaf of brown bread, dunked in caramel and molasses, then dipped in toffee as if breading it for frying. While the previously mentioned fruit hints are present, if deeply buried, there is a distinct note like old leather and an almost chicory sort of bite as it goes along. Towards the finish, there is a bitterness not unlike a varnished wood, which fades into a molasses sweetness during some sips, and lingers as a wooden bitterness with others. As the beer warms, the odd bitter notes fade into the background, allowing the sweet, rich, and complex malt to star unmolested, and allowing the currant-date notes to come more forward.  M: Full, rich, and sticky, this beer clings to every mouth surface. There's a sharpness from the carbonation, which seems a wee bit heavy to me.  O: Given the wooden and slightly earthy notes this doppelbock carries, I understand why many tout it as the best of the doppelbock line. I am in no way suggesting this is undeserved, nor that this is a poor quality beer in any way, shape, or form, but it is not my favorite doppelbock as a devout malthead. The odd notes that seem like hops trying to come a little too forward for my liking cut down on my enjoyment - when I want a doppelbock, I want glorious, unrelenting malt and associated flavors, not anything trying to balance or even display hop flavors. Hence, my rating this beer below other doppelbocks, in spite of my unabashed Privatbraurei Aying fanboyism.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Almost no light comes through when held up to light. Definitive chocolate and malt flavor with notes of coffee and perhaps a distant plum. Sort of a roasted taste on the back end.

Smell: while chilled, picked up some caramel and vanilla. As the beer warmed up, I picked up whiffs of root beer.  Taste: sweet malt with a touch of bourbon. As it warmed up, noted flavor of Cola. Whiskey flavors became a bit more prominent. Finishes slightly burnt, maybe a little bit of ash. Not a huge malt bomb, I'd say more balance with the malt sweetness and finishes burnt. It wasn't overpoweringly sweet like I expected.  Mouthfeel: highly carbonated - kind of goes hand in hand with the slight Cola taste. But carbonation seems to fade as it warms up. No booziness or heat noted.  Overall: The flavors are well balance between the sweet maltiness and the burnt finish.

39,131,jsausley,4.54,"Poured into a stout glass from a bottle.  A: This beer is a wonderfully dark, thick and rich doppelbock. It is mostly a dark brownish-black with hints of red and even amber at its thinnest points in the glass near the stem. Some creamy frothy head but no major lacing on on my pour. The beer seems so thick that as it leaves the glass it pulls the lacing with it. Lots of soul in this beer's look.  S: Not super fragrant, gives the impression that it's thick and not aromatic like an IPA. Big malts hidden deep and a very noticeable molasses smell.  T: I'll be completely frank from the start. I struggled between a 5.00 and 4.75 here. This beer isn't really perfect but it's too good to be 4.75. Unfortunately I don't think it quite deserves a 5.00 but it's so close that I almost gave it to it anyway... Anyway, on to the review.. The first sip is very smooth and crisp considering its thickness, very similar to a nice drinkable wine. Extremely malty, one of the richest and maltiest beers I've tasted. Tons of depth and various flavors as the beer cools. Rich caramel and molasses over hints of coffee. Even a little twang maybe like a green apple on the nose. Nothing overpowering, perfectly balanced. Extremely drinkable. 6.7% ABV and virtually zero bitterness. The roasted malts are huge. The only thing it needs is a little more hops to give it a nice crispy finish. Massive, deep rich beer. Wonderful. A++++.  M: Thick but not syrupy. Very crisp and tons of carbonation deep within the beer's rich texture. A wonderful mouthfeel after drinking with almost no aftertaste. Super smooth, super flavorful and super easy to drink.  O: By far the easiest doppelbock I've tasted, and possibly one of the best beers I've tasted. Rich and powerful, deep and thick but not overly strong, sour or bitter. Lots of wonderful notes and a very fragrant nose. Dominant flavors are MALT MALT MALT MALT with some caramel, molasses. Followed by some subtle coffee and citrus hints. Wonderfully balanced, maybe the best balanced beer I've ever sampled. Unbelievably drinkable for this thickness.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,JSigsbach,4.09,"This beer is the real deal German Doppelbock, ""-ator"" ending and all from visual appeal to taste. Packaging is beautiful with the dark brown bottle as backdrop for the light blue label punctuated by the amber-red glass of beer. The finishing touch which I love (see picture) is the small goat hung from a red thread--just a classy finishing touch to say ""we’re really proud of our product."" Very eye catching. Beautiful nearly black, amber color so inviting with the creamy tan head, washes smoothly, beautifully over the tongue very complex but well blended flavors with ever so slight chocolaty notes to me, some bitterness on finish but not overpowering. The only thing that detracted for me a bit, resulting in a slightly lower aroma score, was the aroma upon finishing the pour--it was slightly--no other word for it--""tin canny."" Ever so slight but just noticeable. It did not in any way come through in the actual taste of the beer and was then indistinguishable by half way through the glass of beer (drunk from a stemmed, rounded belly goblet that allows aromas to experienced well). This was my first tasting so it may have been an aberration. Aside from that aspect, which I can’t call ""very minor"" since, for me, the pre-first drink aroma experience is part of the overall experience, the beer is superb. I would definitely recommend it to a friend. As a matter of fact I did and he fell in love with it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Immortale25,4.21,"Poured into a Duvel tulip. No freshness date.  A- Pours a medium brown color with a 1/2 inch tan head that retains well before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a large center patch of surface foam. Semi-resilient lacing leaves a jagged ring behind.  S- Toasty malts actually bordering on the line of roasty bring notes of dark bread, vanilla and nuts. Very pleasant. Somewhat sweet smelling.  T- Solid toasted malt brings more nutty notes plus some dark bread crackers like rye croutons or something. Not as much vanilla in the aroma, more milk chocolate tones here. Pretty damn complex for a lager. A touch of alcohol.  M- This is where you can tell it's a lager as it's not necessarily thin, just not as robust as the flavor and appearance let on. Medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the fuller side.  O- Though I'm not much of a lager guy, I would reach for this all the time if the price were lower. Flavorful and slightly robust with a well-hidden ABV. I can see why this is so revered.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Dark, cola-like color.  What I smell: I get a sweet vanilla/toffee smell, but that is an over simplification.  What I taste: I drank it slightly chilled or cellar temperature. Thing that struck me most was how smooth the after taste was. Initially you get that strong alcohol taste, but it quickly changes to almost a sweet bread-like heartiness. The more you drink the better it gets and it sort of just glazes your palate leaving you hungry for another.

Leaves other doppelbocks in the dust with its balanced flavors and well-hidden alcohol. A great beer that can be enjoyed year round.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Roastiness comes through in the end. Bit of chocolate, big malt. Touch of candied ginger and a definite phenolic fruit. Almost like banana.  M: Medium bodied. Ample carbonation.  O: Exemplary example. Very complex for the style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Pauline_K,4.4,"This is my first Doppelbock and it has set the bar extremely high.  Appearance: It pours a deep dark chocolate brown but shows a beautiful amber color when held up to the light. It has a nice full head.  Smell: The beer smells rich, sweet, and malt forward. Hints of molasses and dark, dried fruit dominate the nose.  Taste: It has a medium mouth-feel and the light carbonation makes it smooth, creamy and very drinkable. Hop bitterness is almost nonexistent, however, there is a very slight spiciness that mellows as the beer warms. It is malt forward, with cocoa like flavors and a dry finish. It is a sweeter beer but the dry finish enhances the drinkability.  An absolutely wonderful beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Fear4Beer,4.6,"So dark, malty, and delicious. One of the best beers I've ever had. Drink it warm, its meant to be drank at 16 degrees Celsius (around 59 degrees Fahrenheit). If you drink it cold you are not drinking it the way it was made to be consumed and the taste profile is TOTALLY different. When it is warm the flavors explode. It has a very little alcoholic zing at the end. Bitterness is next to nonexistent but it does have a beautiful dark cocoa taste. Cocoa is very bitter but this cocoa is balanced among all the dark fruit and other flavors. If you are a fan of other Ayinger beers you can taste that hefeweizen core at the very end. I LOVE their hefeweizen (Ayinger Bräu Weisse) so this is a nice change of pace. A perfect cold weather beer while the hefeweizen is perfect for the warmer weather.  Ayinger is one of the best beer crafters in the world. This beer continues that pedigree. If you want a lighter beer from them look for the Ayinger Bräu Weisse.  Other notes: If you check the Alström Bros' review it looks like they made a mistake in Jason's review. He gives the beer an overall rating of 3.5 out of 5 but every other aspect of the beer (taste, appearance, smell, and mouthfeel) got a 4.5 out of 5 or higher. Seems like he made a typo when setting the overall rating. Seems like it should have been 4.5 instead of 3.5",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Stevedore,4.43,"11.2oz bottle, indeterminate bottling date, comes with the small plastic toy. Poured into an unlabeled snifter today, 3/27/2014. First time sitting down to review this beer, have had the chance to drink this in the past both here in the US and abroad in Bavaria.  App- Dark ruby-brown body, two finger white head with great retention and lots of lacing. Initially poured with a lot of foam as if it were undercarbonated but quickly dropped to a more normal sized head with great retention.  Smell- Sweet caramel, dark fruits, raisins. Brown sugar, not quite molasses. A bit of yeast esters, kind of banana-like.  Flavour- Nice and sweet yet not overwhelmingly so. Very malt forward. Lots of caramel and raisin, some toffee, brown sugar, a small handful of esters and sharp spices, with a very slight booze on the finish. Certainly a complex beer that is worth appreciating over time.  Mouthfeel- Feels medium bodied, not particularly thick but the carbonation is spot on, making it feel creamy. Aftertaste seems to be similar to eating fresh raisins- sweet but a bit bitter, with a nice bit of dryness.  Overall- Very nice doppelbock that reminds me of my time in Bavaria. Delicious, creamy and malty as expected. A very good and accessible example of the style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ricknelson,4.35,"Served in a Sam Adam's glass. When poured it came up to a very nice high suede head. Maybe because I poured it a little too fast. However it made the beer that much more enjoyable to me. NIce color, head and lacing. Loved the smell, not over powering at all. Mouthfeel was very pleasing, so much so that It went down very fast, way faster than I intended. Looked down at it and, Poof my Doppelbock was gone. This was a very good drinkable brew of which I have not had too many. Don't know if its Ayinger's version of Double Bock that I liked, or just Double Bock, but I intend to get more of it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,1000lbgrizzly,3.87,"A: Dark brown tree bark/ruby, but clear. Thin tan head that gets even thinner over time, not much lacing, nor carbonation.  S: Rum fruitcake, plums, raisins, plus a little bit of wet dog. Not super appealing.  T: Raisin, hints of caramel. Some sips hide notes of spices such as cinnamon and clove- surprising, but welcomed in this otherwise heavy-handed brew. The total lack of bitterness leaves the mild sweetness unrestrained and especially noticeable, like a kid holding a bank hostage because he's the only one with a gun; it's an odd dynamic. Lasting finish.  M: Full-bodied, soft, with fine but mild carbonation.  O: So, so malty. Doesn't really contribute many flavors that I usually seek out, although it does somehow present them better than other beers with similar profiles. My score is boosted for its perfectly representing the style, however different it is from my preferences. It is pleasant, but a slow sipper for sure... or maybe pound it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,WesMantooth,4.84,"This beer puts the Doppel in Bock (that was bad). This beer is legen, wait for it... Smells like a German angel who bathed in molasses syrup and worked 8 hours in a candy- bakery shop combo. Aromas and flavors of toffee, figs, molasses, carmel, malt balls, and taste like you put a sweet swizzle struessel dessert bread in a blender with the DNA of a 1500 year old monk. Not too thick and hard to drink like it would lead you to believe, but fairly full and creamy. It even comes with a souvenir goat. What more could you ask for? ...dary!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Shroud0fdoom,4.23,"*11.2 oz. bottle* Look: Very dark ruby red body, off-white lacey ring around my glass.  Smell: Strong notes of toffee, dark red fruits, licorice, well rounded vanilla, faint hint of cocoa.  Taste: Toffee, slight cherry, licorice, bitter cocoa, subtle hints of spice, toasted nuts, vanilla, well balanced dryness that finishes slight bitter.  Feel: Medium-light body, poppy carbonation.  Overall: Very tasty and to the point. I can see why this is called Celebrator. At nearly 7%abv, there is a lot going on. The flavors are pronounced yet seem individual other than just being a mess in a glass. The dryness leaves you wanting more. This is recommended.  *Originally reviewed on 10-18-2013*",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Roguer,4.15,"Pours a huge beige head with stout-like action. Retention is excellent. Brew appears a solid black, but when held up to the light, reveals garnet and brown highlights and some translucency. Nice but scattered lacing.  Nutty, bready, fruity aroma: dark fruits (prunes), yeast, dark bread. Yummy. Smells like a lighter, yet sweeter, Belgian Dubbel.  Tastes like one, too! Very, very sweet, almost syrupy; liquid bread with a huge prune and yeast presence. Slightly boozy. Some caramel malt presence.  Mouthfeel is light and very drinkable, a clear indicator of the style, despite the huge flavor profile. Again, a little boozy on the back-end, despite being only 6.7%.  This is a nice, super-drinkable dark beer that goes down easy.  No bottle date I could detect.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

(This should be interesting)  S: Fig, raisins, roasted malts and some other dark fruits.  T: Very intense deep dark fruits up front. Followed in the end by a nice, pleasant sweet touch on the end . . . Probably from fruits.  M: Full bodied and crisp to thick feel in this one.  O: A good spring brew.

A sticky lace holds throughout consumption  S - Caramel and malts are predominant for me. Very good aroma that makes you crave it  T - Dark fruits, caramel, toffee, butterscotch and with a malty backbone. Absolutely perfect for the style  M - Smooth, medium body with a low carbonation. Ultra smooth finish  O - Doppelbocks aren't usually my thing but there's no way you can't appreciate how great this beer is. The 6.7% masks amazingly well. I could crush this beer so easily. The unique flavors meld perfectly together. This is absolutely world class and I'm kicking myself for continually passing it up time after time",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Copernicus,4.45,"330ml bottle poured into the Libbey Craft Pub glass (like a pils glass but with a slight inward taper at the top).  A: This exciting ale poured a luscious dark brown like the color of beef stock or chestnuts. the head is a toasty tan, rocky and vibrant at about 2 fingers with medium retention. Full lace; the foam climbs up the glass.  S: Oh boy oh boy. Malty malt. Caramel. Figs. Prunes. Dates. Quite intense. All malt body. No hop. A little spicy fermentation.  T: Oh man. It's full of dark dried fruit, and then the malt backbone reveals itself: All toasty, roasty malt. Finishes with a slight bitterness from the roast. This is clearly an ode to rich malt as the West Coast IPA is to the hop.  M: Despite it richness, it feels bright and clean at first, but then coalesces into a sticky, but not unpleasant, tenacious syrup. Medium-heavy body with playful carbonation.  O: This beer is sensational. Not only the best bock I've had, but one of the best beers. Damn. I'd definitely pair this with roast game or roast pork with some spice. This is definitely an appropriate beer for roaring fires and red meat off the bone!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BoilerMo,4.94,"a: Wondeful look in the pint glass. Dark browns, not muddy but darker richer browns.  s: very light roasted carmel tones  t: smooth on the tongue, slight roast after taste and some sweetness.  m: Looks full bodied, but mouth feel is lighter, thinner but in a good way.  o: Fantastic beer, we did pint glasses at 57F and could have drank a lot more. Generally higher alcohol beers taste like it, but this was simple and easy to drink with no hint of the higher alcohol esters.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,eclipse54,4.14,"Pours a deep brown that nearly appears black; hues reminiscent of dark oak push through only at the fringes. A generous, 3 cm layer of khaki-colored head developed and lingered briefly. Minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel, molten brown sugar, warm molasses, and earthen grains. The flavor amplifies these notes and adds a nice bready background flavor/texture. Some fruity elements - date, plum, and even a hint of pear - push through on the finish. Mouthfeel is superb with a viscous, full-bodied consistency and clean, slightly effervescent finish. Overall, this is something of a “style-defining” beer for me, and I tend to gauge the quality of other dopplebocks against it. Celebrator is well balanced, full-bodied, and rich in flavor; combined with its availability and affordability, it’s a first-class choice.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Tucquan,4.33,"Had this on 2014-02-16 in Columbia, PA. Tasted side-by-side with an Andech's Doppelbock. Add this again on 2018-03-02 in Bolingbrook, IL from a bottle (still delicious).  A - Clear but very dark mahogany with a 2.5-finger tan head that sticks around and leaves very good lacing.  S - Fresh, lightly toasted wheat bread, molasses, touch of clove. Not real strong. Similar to an Andech's but with just a bit of sour dough thrown in. The aroma on this is slightly stronger than the Andech's.  T - Dark fruit (plum and fig), molasses, medium-roasted grain with a touch of char. Earthy spice, a touch of chocolate and a very nice bit of roasted and hop bitterness. Finishes with a chalky chocolate and toasted sour dough finish with more of the balancing bitterness. Dries moderately / reasonably for the style. Very enjoyable.  M - Light-medium body and carbonation. Not substantial but not watery. An easy drinker.  O - An excellent Doppelbock. Compared to the Andech's, the contrast between the various flavors is more pronounced / bolder. The Andech's has more of an integrated / balanced flavor plus a firmer mouthfeel. In this head-to-head comparison, the Andech's wins by a nose. You can't go wrong with either.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

There's also a touch of fruit in there, but the maple syrup is the dominant flavor.  M: Medium-ful bodied and smooth.  O: While I wouldn't say it's as good as Salvator, I would say that it's way better than most other bottom fermented beers.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

All above aromas plus a little roastiness and mild tingly hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, chewy, tingly, malty, light to medium bodied, and medium carbonation.  Overall: I haven't had this in a while for no reason. I forgot how good and delicious it tasted. I'll be buying or more often now.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,CalgaryFMC,4.18,"The oft-proclaimed king or queen of dopplebocks. Certainly this brewery is one of the best at executing traditional German styles and I delved into this with high expectations. Enjoyed on tap at Craft Beer Market in Calgary, served in an authentic Celebrator glass. Aroma is full of dark, sweet malt and buttery notes: Dried dark fruits, butterscotch, molasses, espresso, and (unexpected) some celery seed spice. Where am I getting that from? Its there, I swear, probably a yeast phenolic element or due to spicy hops. Tastes like chocolate-covered coffee beans, fresh pipe or cigar tobacco, dates and raisins, prunes ... Smooth, creamy mouthfeel yields a chocolate milkshake effect. Rich and sweet but earthy in the finish, with a moderately thick body that coats the mouth. I found that the bitter, earthy, roasted flavors were more salient for the first half or so, at which point more of the sweet buttery flavors reared their heads. The alcohol is warming but not aggressive. Believe the hype, its one of the best doppelbocks I've sampled and strikes a near-perfect balance between roasted, earthy bitter, and sweet domains.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

T: Roasted nutty flavor on the front end, very smooth, no pop, with a sweet coffee, toffee, caramel flavor on the back end.  M: Extremely smooth medium body, slightly creamy feel balanced by light carbonation (too flat for my taste), and a slight alcohol warming sensation that lingers.

39,131,SneakyPotato,3.03,"A- Pleasing to look at, and the head was beautiful while it lasted, which wasn't long. It did retain a small froth on the top, all the way to the end. I was very pleased with this. As the head subsided, there were small white ""floaties"", which I haven't seen in other beers. My glass was clean.  S- I was not really expecting how sweet and light this beer smells when it's compared to it's looks. I couldn't quite put my finger on it until I read somebody else's review, but it definitely smells like raisins and malt, with a slight alcohol smell on the nose.  T- Initial taste is sweet malt and raisin, followed by a dry yet smooth middle, finished by a slight alcohol taste on the tongue. After my pint was half finished, the initial flavors seemed to have subsided and all that was really present was the bitterness, but not the roasted malt kind.  M- This beer definitely coats your mouth, but I personally don't really like the flavor that it leaves. Its reminiscent of drinking cold medicine and having that taste in your mouth afterwards. It's not a heavy beer at all, despite what some people say.  O- I gave this beer a fair review, and I can definitely say there's a lot of good about it. I just recognize that it really isn't my cup of tea (or beer). It was definitely worth a try though, and I would recommend it heartily to people that don't enjoy lighter beers and dislike the charred coffee taste of stouts and lagers. It's sweeter and not as harsh as some of the stouts that I enjoy, but I wasn't much of a fan of the alcohol on the nose and palate. I feel like it needed more body and more complex flavors to compliment the alcohol finish.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

T: The first flavor that hit my tongue was the sweetness. This is most likely the reason why this beer is so popular. It's unique in that you don't expect that taste when drinking such a dark beer. M: Warm, smooth coating all around. Very enjoyable! O: I don't have a long history with bock beers, but it this is any indication of the experience, I might have found a new favorite type of beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S: Roasted malts, oats, coffee, and toffee. Very nice, very simple, very sweet.  T: Nutty and nicely browned. Oats, burnt malt (on the cusp of being bitter), and some nuts.  M: Dry and coating with a touch of stickiness. Good carbonation and a tingly, creamy mouthfeel. Medium-full body.  O: Really good doppelbock. This might not be the best doppelbock I have had but it is certainly one of them. The beer is much more subtle than Korbinian is on the whole, and is right on the mellow side of the spectrum of dark bocks (as I see it). This is a mellow but filling beer, and is worth trying.

Poured fridge cold into a brandy snifter.  Appearance: Deep and dark, occasionally hinting flashes of crimson with a nice tan colored head and sticky, long lasting lace.  Smell: Complex sweetness and roasted malts make you want to keep sniffing away in anticipation of what is to come.  Taste: Oh boy. This is the doppelbock against which all others are measured. Sweet malt, raisins, the most subtle hint of alcohol spice, maybe a touch of toffee and dark chocolate. Absolutely delicious and the aftertaste lingers as a reminder. Additionally, it seems to get better as you sip it and as it warms revealing more complexities of malted goodness.  Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel with beautiful carbonation not too bubbly, expected it to be heavier than it is. Creamy without being syrupy. Feel free to swish it around.  An epic representation of the style and awful nifty that it's available year round. Not overly alcoholic at 6.7% which is good because you will want another.

Pours a deep, barely translucent garnet with just over one finger pale head. The head fades to a thin layer that laces well.  Aroma is almost dominated initially by an unfortunate bitter metallic note. Behind that I get some caramel, raisin, faint cocoa and biscuit. The metallic smell slinks further into the background as it warms but doesn't disappear.  Luckily the flavor has only a hint of the metallic strangeness from the nose. Chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit, earthy, nutty, hints of cherry, caramel, toffee, slight coffee and a mild floral bitterness. Crazy how complex and layered with flavor this is. Malty and delicious.  Creamy medium body with fairly heavy carbonation. Malty aftertaste with cocoa, nuts, toffee and raisins.  Outstanding. Not sure what took me so long to try this.

There is a touch of caramel as well.  The taste follows the nose; thick with nuts, roasted and sweet malts. Caramel vanilla and biscuty  The feel is thick, bready and chewy. There are some light resinous hop oil in the backend and some of the oil sits on the tongue after swallowing.  Overall this is a very good Doppelbock.

Those biscuits are prominent, some spicy (cinnamon, nutmeg) notes, vanilla, bourbon, cherries, caramel, toffee, smoke, honey, banana, clove, roastiness. I could go on, and on, picking random flavors I recognize out of this. But this beer is more than the sum of its parts.

The look of this thing makes me want to get into some more traditional German beers!  Smell - Rich malty goodness, some molasses sweetness and dark fruitiness (raisin/dates/figs) throughout. Textbook and then some.  Taste - Malty and fruity like raisin/dates/figs and super smooth, alarmingly so even. Touch of hops that most IPA drinkers might barely notice, but it complements well in this style.  Mouthfeel - Light-bodied with low-medium carbonation, as often these traditional lagers should be. Zero booziness which is incredible for 6.7%. Rests fruity and gentle hop linger. Great drinkability.  Overall - This is definitely the standard by which all doppelbocks are judged.

39,131,TheAlamoWrocker,3.55,"As a Dobbelbock this is a spectacular example of one (easily an A), but as a beer it's just something that feels like less than a porter while still carrying attributes of one. I'll rate this as a beer rather than just a Dobbelbock.  Reviewed November 16, 2013 at 0245. Poured a 330 mL bottle into a pint glass.  A: 1/2 fingered tan head followed by a dark reddish brown body. Head quickly dissipates.  S: Light pleasant bready malts. Thin molasses smothers the light chocolate of the drink.  T: Toffee followed by a lingering dark chocolate. Tad hit of alcohol on the end.  M: Lightly heavy carbonation with a medium body that is smooth.  O: This a a solid dark version of a Dobbelbock. This is a drink that is made for the everyman. This is the drink that one would get the Shiner Bock drinker to explore more into the craft/micro beer world.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

T - Roasted malts, chocolate, nutty, fruity, baked bread. Velvety smooth mouth feel.  O - This is one of the smoothest beers I have ever had. It gets better with each sip as it comes to room temp.

39,131,jb510,4.94,I typically favor stouts and bocks and for many years this has been my favorite beer. It's been getting much easier to find the last couple years.  It serves well out of the bottle or out of a glass. Having a light cream head with very little carbonation that gives it a silky mouth feel.  It is richly flavored and a bit sweet or sugary. The with hints of molasses.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S = Rich and malty, roasty, hints of chocolate and toffe, mollasses, a touch of alcohol.  T = Yowza... not what I was expecting. I knew it was going to be rich and malt forward, but DAMN. Roasty and rich, very sweet (almost cloyingly sweet), chocolate and molasses, and something I can only describe as ""beer funk"". There is some hop bitterness but malt takes a front seat here. There is a slight booziness to it as well.  M = rich and chewy, very heavy  O = My first example of the Doppelbock style, and I can honestly say I don't think I was ready for it. I'll give it another try in the future, perhaps try another example of the style, but for me, this was far too sweet and heavy on the palate.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S: Very complex with lots going on. Sweet and delicious smelling. T: Smooth and deliciously malty with a perfect hop bite. Dark fruit flavor.. figs perhaps? M: Looks like low viscosity oil, but is very smooth and easy to drink. O: Amazing. Expensive, but worth every penny as a treat or early birthday present.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Good clarity, two finger light brown head.  S- Pumpernickle and raisins.Maybe a touch a alcohol.  T- Similar to the aroma, pumpernickle, dried dark fruits, a very slight roast, little bit of hop bitterness on the end.  M- On the lighter side of medium, pretty easy drinking really.  O- This is one of my favorite beers and one of the first I had when I got into drinking craft. It has a bit of something to it that is different than all other doppelbocks that I've had. It is very smooth in all aspects and has a nice roasted touch to it. It is certainly the darkest doppelbock I've found. One thing is that I find many doppelbocks have too much of a fruitcake like flavor to me but that is not so with this beer. I try to pick up a single every few months and am lucky enough to live in a city where a few bars get it on draft. Probably my favorite German beer!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smell - Slight cocoa and spice smell. Hints of raisins and other dark fruits. Malty undertones.  Taste - Many flavors tend to explode off this one. Chocolate, Coffee, Fruitcake, Spice.  Mouthfeel - Surprisingly light considering how the color is dark. The strong flavor does not linger on the palate too long.  Overall - This is my first taste of this beer.

After a straightforward pour into an Ayinger pokal, this deep ruby, slightly viscous beer starts out with a one- to two-finger head with a hint of maroon. The head dissipates fairly quickly, with no cling. After the foam disappears, a sweet aroma, redolent of prunes, is released.  The beer's taste is smoky and dark-fruit sweet. The aftertaste is of oak, with the barest whisper of hops and a wafting alcohol volatility. The beer feels satisfyingly thick and smooth on the palate. It's a nice choice for an autumn evening, a few steps this side of a stout.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Appearance - Dark brown, nearly black, yet a few red / amber hues when the light hits the glass right. 1.5 Fingers of creamy tan head with decent retention and lacing.  Smell - WOW! Dark Fruits, Rum, raisins, cherries topped off by a massive dose of chocolate. The smell is a reminder of all the celebratory times of year and the holidays.  Taste - Nice malty backbone, picking up prune, rum raisin, and some moderate smokiness. Bitter chocolate aftertaste is nice too.  Mouthfeel - Rich but not too creamy, alcohol is very well disguised. If the beer had too much thickness, it would be one that you would have to limit yourself to one or too, because of the richness and heaviness. Instead, you can enjoy many.  Overall - First time trying the style, but this was glorious. A great beer to celebrate with!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,fourstringer,4.56,"Poured from a 330 mL bottle into Brewer's Art goblet with a moderate hand. Chilled in the fridge for about 90 minutes. Goat figurine studied and set aside.  A: Very dark amber red. Almost black when viewed straight on. 1 finger of caramel colored head that reduced to a fine layer after approximately 1 minute. Pretty nice.  S: Very sweet. Chocolate. Sugar. Raisins. A bit like Xmas. Not piney Xmas, but spice cake Xmas.  T: Full malty sweetness initially with a gradual fade to a dark chocolate-like light bitterness. Some cherry, raisin, spice. Minimal hop bitterness. Into an empty stomach it provides a nice late-onset warming. Nice spot-on coffee notes.  M: Full bodied. A bit too much carbonation on the first sip, but perfect by mid-way. A little agitation in the mouth renders it delightfully creamy. Leaves a notable stickiness on the lips and tongue, which I could do without.  O: This beer is pretty amazing. Even more so given it adheres to Das Reinheitsgebot. The taste, in particular, just abounds with complexity and really fine coffee/chocolate/dark fruit notes. Having recently had some similarly flavored beers with coffee/chocolate actually added as ingredients, I am surprised how this beer has outperformed them.

The little white plastic horse hanging from the bottle neck is a nice touch.  a: Black with dark ruby clarity when light is shone through. Finger thick tan head dissipated fast to a large spot of surface foam. No lacing to speak of.  s: Mild dark malt.  t: Dark malt/ fruit with a sharp edge. Mildly bitter dark fruit aftertaste. Tasty, but the bitterness detracts from the malt, which should be more prominent than it is here. I could praise its balance, but like in a milk stout, I'm really looking for more malt dominance in a doppelbock.  m: Moderate, lighter than expected. I did not find it to be as rich as the label said it should be. Lots of carbonation which mostly did not show up in the head.  o: A very good, easy drinking doppelbock, but a bit disappointing considering its high rating. Not a favorite I am likely to buy again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

On top sit s thick creamy tan head of foam that 's cloud like and loathe to fall. It finally does but leaves wet lace dripping down the glass with each sip.  Nose is intense. First the most authentic scent of blackstrap molasses. With that earthy little sour to it like if you had put your nose int he jar of it. Dark fruits and fresh plum. Behind that a treasure of dark dried fruits like raisin and prune. bit of caramel and a dark and breaddy malt that is toasted perfectly. Toasted bread and you can almost smell the crusts. There's a whiff of alcohol but it is not unwelcome and a light spice. Smells like a pastry made with lots of dark fruits and nuts.  Taste is fat chewy and velvety malt. Toasty and breaddy. Glides over the tongue with all that fruit and the creamy molasses. There's a touch of hops on this and they are bitter but not too much. Endless and smooth. creamy with dark sugars and toasted grains. There's a touch herbal in the drink and the body is round, full and fat. Finishes with a delightfully authentic aftertaste of molasses.  This beer is perfection in every way. it's rich and delicious. Smooth and forthcoming. It drinks sticky and has a complex palate that has just the right amount of sour and bitter to offset it's deep sweetness.

The aroma has dark sticky caramel, dark brown sugar, figs, and raisin with roasted malt and nuts. Pretty sweet and malty. It's a big aroma for it being a 6.7% beer. There's also that fishy umami.  The taste follows with a round pack of flavor of roasted malt, molasses, dark brown sugar, and some rich raisins and dried cherries. The finish follows through with that doppelbock flavor of slight stickiness and nuttiness. It's a clean wonderful finish with actually some alcohol in there.  The mouthfeel is a full medium with a creamy mouthfeel, but quite rich compared to other doppelbocks. The others I've had do not pack the huge delicious flavors as this, but along with that lager crispness in there too.  One of my favorite lagers and one of the best doppelbocks out there.  Pairing notes: Definitely have this with pretzels. That malty note in pretzels from the lye just explodes with this beer. They compliment so well. The same goes for rye chips as it mixes so well with the spicy rye and bready notes of the rye chips. One of the better pairings I've found.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S: malt, malt and more malt -- it's a donut shop, a bakery, a yeasty sweet aroma that for my money is as good as it gets. i've only encountered this perfection once or twice outside of Celebrator, but with those other brews, it is a hit-and-miss thing ... sometimes they produce the perfect aroma, sometimes not quite. Celebrator offers this malt perfection consistently. raisins and a slight wine-like note show up at times, but never at the expense of the perfect sweet biscuits smell.  T: doesn't follow the nose 1-to-1, but obvious malt notes permeate each swallow ... lots of sweetness, some raisins, a little bread -- the taste seems a bit ""darker"" than the nose. it's almost like it smells more like beer and tastes a little more like red wine ... a slightly sweet but definite red wine.  F: a slight silkiness to it, not super heavy, enough carbonation to last the entire bottle, but it's not the brew's strongsuit for me.  O: without question, the brew is a great one. my scores on the lower end (taste, feel, overall) only reflect the fact that i'm not a fan of raisins. you can *look* at Celebrator and tell it's world-class. the pour alone is dazzling, and the nose is so perfect i might keep coming back to this one simply for it.  the 6.7% ABV is every bit of that. the Germans give it to you strong here ... i don't taste even a hint of alcohol, but 2/3 into a little ol' bottle 11.2 oz. big, i can feel that 6.7%.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A little bit of iron in the aftertaste.  M- This is kind of chewy in consistency, with a bittersweet finish. Carbonation is mild, giving it a smoother, more drinkable beer.  O- This is a really good beer. It tastes great and I really like the feel. Nice and malty, and it won't knock you down if you have a few in a sitting.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,JohnG190,4.62,Bottle poured into pilsner glass. Served at 50 degrees.  Appearance - dark mahogany with thick tan head.  Aroma - roasted malt and molasses.  Taste - sweet roasted malt that finishes slightly smoky.  Mouthfeel - rich and creamy with light carbonation.  Overall - a loaf of bread in a pilsner glass. I now understand the hype around this beer.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Nugganooch,4.5,"330ml bottle with the hanging lil goat and a standard Pils glass *Notes taken on 05/17/13  A: Pour is a dark chestnut brown with a lighter shade around the edges and some effervescent carbonation visible. The beer produces a cakey mass of dark tan foam head and displays some of the best retention I have seen in some time. The glass is left with patterns of chunky splotched lace after each sip. Indeed a very nice looking beer.  S: Smells of chocolate malt mixed with some deep plum and dried dark fruit. Rich and surprisingly aromatic with a sweet raisin bread likeness. A dash of alcohol noted. Enjoyable aromas overall with some nice dark roast and caramelized grains coming through.  T: Tastes is a wonderful blend of dark and brown malts with flavors of caramel chocolate cream and dark fruits like raisin, fig, and plum. Comes together very nicely like a nutty chocolate bread. There is a modest amount of earthy hop bitterness to the beer and alcohol is well masked throughout. Creamy and delicious with a great balance of charred sugars, milk chocolate, and dark fruits. Fantastic stuff.  M: Feel is moderately light and a touch watery thin but with some higher carb it brings a nice creamy consistency to the body. A soft bittering and fairly clean overall. Tad wet on the finish.  D: A delicious Dopplebock that is easily accessible and even easier to quaff. Rich with chocolate fruit and bread yet surprisingly light. I have not experienced many Dopplebocks but I can easily see why this is one of the best.  World class beer. Highly recommended and the little souvenir is a nice touch.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Cubatobaco,4.38,"A - deep, opaque, that is reminiscent of cola in the glass. In the light it reveals a garnet color. Good carbonation streams around the edges.  S - heavy malt, raisins, toffee, dark roasted coffee, lingering sweetness  T - The flavors of the aforementioned aromas are what you first get followed by other complex layers of bread, and a slight hint of metal  M - great acidity, luscious, long finish with a very light hop bitterness on the end  O - I'm new to Doppelbocks, but this will not be my last. I feel I've set the bar too high as this is going to be hard to beat. This is very complex with layers of flavor that work in the mouth like an escalator; one after another. I can see how other say they could drink a ton of this. A definite must have in the cellar and a great change of pace beer!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,dc87,4.01,"A - Dark brown, with dark ruby red around the edges. Thin head just off white. Head disappears quickly.  S - Smells wonderful. Distinctive, bright smell. Very sweet and malty with some dried fruit, raisins. Not smelling any hops.  T - Rich. Very similar to the nose, but just a little less exciting. A little sweeter. Malts, dried fruit, and some caramel sweetness. The aftertaste is dry, hoppy and slightly toasted.  M - Decent. Light bodied. Very smooth, light on carbonation.  O - An interesting, rich lager. Pleasant to drink, but for me it doesn't live up to the hype surrounding it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,rickyleepotts,4.82,"I have had this beer several times. My favorite part of this beer is the little goat that hangs on the side of the bottle. Not sure if he has a name, but he's cute! There are also goats on the label. Does anyone know the connection with goals the doppelbock style?  My palate has been out of sorts lately. I haven't been in the mood for a particular style in a few weeks, and nothing tastes good. Not that it doesn't taste good, but there are days where I am not even in the mood for a beer. Good thing I know what this tastes like, and know it will be an enjoyable experience. I can already smell the bready sweetness on this bottle as I was pouring it. Let's drink!  In the Glass: I remember this beer being dark, but not this dark. It is nearly black in the glass, and offers a nice thin tan head. The lace is nice and thick, too. I am sure this will, as it heats up, it will get better. But I KNOW it will be good from the first sip.  Nose: Lots of bread on the nose. The more I smell it the more malty flavors I am starting to pick up some dark chocolate, almost coffee notes after a few sniffs. The aroma is so powerful I can almost taste it as I smell. That is a sign of a good beer. Before I take my first sip, let me tell you… the beer looks creamy in the glass now. Maybe it is the way the light is hitting the head, but the beer looks even more inviting than normal. Maybe my desire for beer is coming back!  Flavor: Holy. Crap. This beer is SO SO SO good. I mean, great. I could seriously drink a gallon of this and be fine. Well, not fine… flavor wise, anyway. There are some nice layers of carbonation to start, then the dark bready flavors really shine through. Then, as you swallow, it turns somewhat sweet and finishes with a nice hoppy dryness. Think Irish stouts when without the metallic finish. The flavor here is just incredible. I bet this would make a good food beer, too. It is thick enough to be a meal all by itself. This is what beer should taste like. Bravo, Aying!  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel on this is thick and creamy with slight bubbles around the edge. I did swish a sip around in my mouth, and it did open up a little bit. Not too much, but the fluffy texture turned to bubbles. I rarely finish a glass before I am done writing, but this will be gone before I am finished. It is too good to let it heat up. Right out of the fridge and I am satisfied. Guys, this is one of the best beers I have tasted in weeks and I plan to make this the beer of the week next week at Total Wine & More. YUMMY!  Aftertaste: For a beer that has this much flavor, I expected the finish to be a bit more bold. The drying is nice, though. It lasts for a few minutes, but isn't as intense as the flavor profile here. I guess I will just have to take another drink. Hold on… be right back! Man, this just gets better with every sip. Maybe I have found a new love for doppelbocks.  This beer makes me want to celebrate!!! Get it? I doubt that is where the name comes from, but this is such a tasty beer, I might buy another one on my way home tonight. We are going to some grand opening somewhere… free appetizers and free drinks. Not sure what, but it should be fun. I don't even know what the place is called! Anyway, I am excited to try a new bar and hopefully they have some good cocktails available. If not, I will leave and find a bar offering Celebrator. CHEERS!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BMMillsy,3.67,"Pours deep dark brown/black with nearly no head. Some ruby edges in teh light. Sweet molasses aroma, roasted malt, and licorice/anise. Flavor is big licorice with hints of chocolate, then more licorice. Pretty sweet stuff, but a lingering bitter on the palate. Very low carbonation, thick mouthfeel, and heavy. Velvety as it describes. Interesting brew.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The focus is totally on the malt with only a slight hop bitterness.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Hermanater,4.58,"Can you say molasses?  Had this beer while sampling several bocks. Of all of the bocks we tried, this was my favorite.  I tend to stay away from sweeter beers and bocks typically have that sweetness. This had a wonderfully bittersweet molasses aroma and flavor.  Respectable appearance-much darker than most bocks.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,TheCondor,4.59,"I fell in love with this one as soon as I looked at it. The ram figurine, the packaging, the fact it is an Ayinger, whose Dunkel I am a total homer for...all the elements lined up. And I have wanted to try a big-time German doppelbock forever. Side poured from the bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance - As previously mentioned, the packaging is so cool on this one. I added the figurine to my brewerania collection, including bottle caps and rare labels. This beer hasa magnificent presentation. Dark, dark brown, almost black pour with a nice one finger head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. Doesn't sound like much until you've seen it.  Smell - Sweet malts, rich dark fruit, molasses, and did I mention sweetness? If a beer can smell rich, this one does.  Taste - Oh Lord Jesus its' a fire. This is one of the most spectacular tasting beers I have ever had. Rich and creamy sweet malts wash the palate, with some nutty notes in there as well. Dark fruits round out the spectacularly balanced taste. My wife said it tasted like beer and wine had a kid together. I said it tastes like proof God loves us and wants us to be happy.  Mouthfeel - The most incredible part of the beer. Washes down so smooth and creamy, almost like cream soda or a root beer float or something. Leaves you wanting to drink more, so smooth. By far the best aspect of an incredible beer.  Overall - Seriously, this beer is in contention for the best I've ever had. This blew my hair back for sure, even my wife liked it, and she typically hates all beers. I'd buy this by the gallon if I could get it (and afford it). Unbelievable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,NoLeafClover44,4.09,"330mL bottle poured into SA Perfect Pint glass. No dating info to be found.  A - Some hissing on the pop of the cap. The tan head fizzled out just as quickly as it wasformed. This one looks like coke in color and head behavior. What gives? I thought bocks were supposed to have rich, fluffy heads that stuck around for the entirety. No lacing at all. Maybe there is something wrong with my bottle?  S - Sweet caramel and considerable fruit notes. Cherry, fig, and boisenberry all come to mind. A little bit savory. Roasted barley and nuts counteract the sweeter components. Not bad.  T - Deliciously malty on the start with roasted grain, sweet toffee, and bitter molasses. Cream soda flavor follows. The finish is clean with some grain and mild sweetness.  M - Smooth feel with light carbonation.  O - I was very disappointed by the appearance. The pour yielded some of the quickest dying head I have ever seen with no lacing. Luckily, it was all uphill from there. Beautiful display of malts in the aroma and flavor. I can imagine drinking this stuff out of a large dimpled mug at Oktoberfest. Good stuff.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

T: A rich malt flavor. There is a spicy belgian character in the back of this beer as well.  M: Nice heavy body with a decent carbonation.  O: A great beer. Well worth picking up.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Jacurdy60,4.6,"Pours a pitch-brown color with a thin toffee colored head that sticks around for the duration of the drink. Coats entire glass and leaves a nice latticework. Smells of burnt sugar, maple syrup, toasted bread, phenols (a bit medicinal), and of dark fruit, perhaps dates or figs. Tastes boozy on the front of the palate but it is balanced nicely in the middle by the malted sweetness of residual sugars and caramel, followed by a bready hopped twinge at the end but it finishes smooth and stays thick throughout the whole tasting experience. The balance and body are perfection. So smooth on the palate. Sticky, chewy until the swallow. This brew is world class. I haven't had many doppelbocks, but I could tell from the first sip that this was something special. It's very complex as the esters, phenols, malts, booze, and hops balance perfectly with a thick, chewy body on the palate.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

M: smooth, medium-full body, some gentle carbonation fuzziness; teensy bit of stickiness  O: a celebratory beer for sure - easily my favorite doppelbock - and I'm not a big doppelbock guy or anything, but this is an excellent beer - reminded me of holiday ales and really good brown ales",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,twiggamortis420,4.71,"11.2 oz bottle pours a very dark brown color with a creamy cap of tan head. Average retention and lacing.  Nose is sweet and caramely with a touch of dried fruit...raisins or prunes. Not sure Id go so far as to say chocolate, but there are some cocoa-esque notes in here.  Taste is wonderfully malty without being too burnt, toasty, roasty or otherwise bitter. Its so smooth and creamy. Malts are sweet, but never coming anywhere near cloying. There is a kiss of herbal hop bitterness on the finish as well. Just the right strength...some doppels, especially Americanized ones, seem to think they must clock in at 8 or 9 percent. This is one of those beers that you go back and revisit and wonder why the hell it has taken so long to buy again! This is the best doppelbock out there when fresh, I dont even really think it is debatable. Delicious.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Burnt toffee, caramel, toasted biscuit, and dark fruits. Lots of sweetness up front, but earthy hops keep everything in check. Notes of chocolate and nutty malt come through as it warms.  M - Creamy, smooth, medium-full body. Crisp and clean with decent carbonation.  O - All of the flavors here are in perfect harmony with one another.

Small amount of lacing.  Smells bready and sweet, with some dark fruits, like plums.  Tastes pretty similar, with roasty bread like flavors, intermixed with sweet plum flavors. Gotta be one of the maltiest beers I've ever had.  Full body, low carbonation.

39,131,Bowdoinbeerboy,4.65,"This is one seriously tasty beer.  Pours from a bottle, almost no head. The beer is a deep, deep amber color, its almost opaque, but some red light manages to trickle through. The nose is nice and subdued, but some hints of candied fruit manage to work their way through.  The mouthfeel on this is great, it really gills the palate and just seem to be extremely viscous. Lots of dark flavors, very, very malty. This almost tastes like heavy rye bread in liquid form. It is absolutely delightful. Definitely a end of winter beer here!  Buy again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,DAllspaw,4.17,"pours a dark ruby, color, almost like Coke. A slight brown head which quickly dissipates.  Smell is a bit of fig and molasses, but very much a warm, rising dark bread. A bit of amber honey as well.  Taste is where this beer comes alive. The body is moderate to heavy with a pronounced malty, pumpernickel taste. certainly sweet with a slight bitter finish to offset the sweetness perfectly.  Realy nice beer, every bit as good as I thought it would be.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,barczar,4.29,"2011 vintage.  Pours an opaque deep brown with ruby highlights and a frothy, dense one inch cappuccino head that dissipates slowly, leaving sheets of lacing.  Bready, deeply caramelized malt, extremely rich, with molasses sweetness, toffee, nuttiness, and dark fruits form the initial aroma. Smells like wort with undertones figs, dark cherries, raisins, and dates.  Flavor is sweet initially, with nutty, toasty notes hitting mid palate, finishing a touch roasty and dry. Malt is extremely rich and complex. Brown sugar, tart cherries, raisins, and a touch of chocolate emerge. Melanoidin character, that standard kettle caramelization, abounds.  Body is a touch light, with moderate carbonation and slight alcohol warmth.  Probably a little more dark fruit character than when fresh, but that malt richness is phenomenal. Great malt-centric brew.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smell - brown sugar, dried plum  Taste - caramelized malt sugars, hint if smoked meat, rich. Raisin?  mouthfeel - medium-thick, almost chewy, just enough carbo- low-medium.  Overall - Definitely better than Spaten Optimator, but not I'm not sure it's worth the price difference. $1.60/bottle Optimator, around $4 for this bottle.  Not as complex as I'd expect, with how renowned it is. But Doppelbocks aren't ever as complex as Belgians. A great doppelbock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,silverking,4.63,"A- Pours a clear mohagany with a sturdy tan head. Head retention is fantastic, as is the lacing. Lots of bubbles rising in the glass. Very nice to look at  S- Aromas of malt, figs, hops, spices, and cocoa come together beautifully.  T- malt with hints of Molasses. Slightly spicy towards the middle with notes of cocoa and ripe cherry and plum. The finish shows dark cocoa in the back of the palate with a slight bitterness.  M- Medium bodied and silky, with lots of carbonation. The carbonation really helps to bring this beer to life. It dances across your tongue on an bed of Co2.  O- Big surprise here. Seriously awesome",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,artoolemomo,4.3,"Appearance- The foam is a little slow to rise at first on the first pour but this eventually becomes half a medium tan head and half a muddy chocolate brown body that show garnet hues when held up to the light. The foam dissipates rather quickly while leaving the slightest of lacing.  Nose- This starts off bready and malty and then begins to show raisins, banana, and chocolate. There is also some sugar and caramel. Most of this light but I imagine it would be a little different if this were warmed up a little more. Honey also makes itself known.  Taste- Sour cherry and raisins backed by chocolate and oak appear first. There is a very woody bitterness at the finish at the back of the throat. So far this is dominating the beer. Chocolate, raisins, brown sugar, and bread become more notable and the woody finish acts as a necessary counterbalance.  Mouthfeel- This is medium to a bit heavy as far as the body goes. It has a nice creaminess which makes this a very drinkable beer. This particular beer seems as if it may have a little too much carbonation. As smooth as this beer is, it wouldn't hurt at all for it to be heavier.  Drinkability- Only a slight alcohol burn which aids the overall flavor profile. Very nice texture working with a great flavor profile makes for a very drinkable beer.  Overall- I would give this an A with some tendency toward A- but mostly an A. It falls short of being exceptional in my opinion. For the price, it gets very close however.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,FLima,4.3,"Brown ruby color with a constant thin off-white head. Malty aroma with notes of caramel, dark chocolate and earthy hops. Delicious flavor, elegant and with character at the same time. Taste of toasted malts, earthy hops, dry fruits, brown sugar but perfect sweet level, plums and some pines. Aftertaste is dry, bitter and malty. Medium to full body with low carbonation. A classic mistake of some beers of the style is not to conceal the alcohol (or be harmonic), and here is seen nowhere. Definitely the best Doppelbock I tasted so far. This should please both malt and hop lovers, even though it is perfect balanced (and not a balanced over extremes). No short cuts and still a great outcome. Celebrator was a well-deserved name. And this should pair nicely with a broad range of food, especially meat or something that can stand to it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

It's hard to imagine a better brew to suit my taste (although it is such a rich beer I don't see myself drinking more than one or two at a sitting). This beer has a rich brownish-black appearance and pleasant aroma. The mouthfeel is like drinking milk although the taste is nothing like that.

Pleasant pine undertones with almost a hint of Irish whiskey. As it warms up, rich grape takes over and is almost malty caramel kool-aid like.  Mouthfeel: a great balance of creamy and carbonation with slight preference to carbonation  Overall Impression: I could drink this. I will drink this. There is a reason a beer like this has already been rated so high. Beautifully complex, yet simply delicious.  Food Pairing: I had this with some Irish lamb stew and it really goes perfectly.

Aroma of sweet ripe dark fruits, toffee, and the floral aroma of noble hops.  The intertwining flavors of dark, toasty malt with the aforementioned dark fruits are the highlight of the flavor profile. There's just a tinge of bitterness on the finish, enough to impart a wonderful balance to the flavor. While some doppelbocks can be one-dimensional and cloying sweet, the roasted malt and skillful hopping here lend complexity. Exceedingly smooth mouthfeel thanks to a soft, fine carbonation.

39,131,WilliamAlbrecht,4.85,"Ayinger's Celebrator is definitely a fantastic brew. I must admit, I love doppelbocks. This is a TRUE bock. Definitely tasty, not too heavy, and great to behold!  Appearance: Poured into a Ayinger Celebrator 'chalice' and certainly looks great. Pours a darkish brown/bordering on black like color. One and a half fingers of nice, delicious, puffy, creamy head!  Smell: Wow. Smells great. I smell raisins, figs(for sure!), toffee, and perhaps vanilla in there as well!  Taste: A very very rich flavor. This is one of the best doppelbocks around. I must admit that I have yet to encounter a doppelbock that can stand toe to toe with the original, Paulaner's Salvator, but this is a fine brew in its own right. The taste is incredible and the carbonation is not too heavy..in fact, it's not heavy at all! No bitter aftertaste in the least bit!  Mouthfeel: Wow..very creamy, very full bodied!  Overall this is a fantastic doppelbock. I would recommend anyone that loves quality beer to get a hold of a ""four pack"" of these. Whereas they are rather pricey..it is TOTALLY worth it.  Nice touch on the goat(bock) on the bottle. Save them! They look great!  Celebrator is a great winter time beer. It goes great with a t bone steak, with a sirloin steak, round cut steak..in fact, it goes great with meat period! I would also recommend having a few as a dessert. Heavy on taste and quality, definitely worth a purchase!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,StonedTrippin,4.08,"this is the essential doppelbock as far as I am concerned. it is true as true can be to the style, and is downright delicious. flawlessly made. the pours is a rich mahogany to molasses color with a foamy khaki head a few fingers tall, excellent retention. looks like a lot of body and a lot of malt character, judging by looks alone. the nose is really heavy malt, some roast, some caramel, some dessert or bread pudding type of aromas, and more alcohol than you would think at only 6.7% abv. the flavor is really heavy, dark wheat, heavy toasted barley, and mineral rich water are evident. the yeast is also characteristically german, bready and drenched in dark fruit. there is a peculiar weight to this that makes it wholly satisfying but may reduce drinkability to a certain degree. its rich and smooth, and the carbonation is slight. its a perfect early spring beer to me, and one that would work well with grilled meat, a peppery arugula salad, or even fresh baked cookies. its not for everyone, but if you like the style, this is the go!  edit: oddly enough, my lady loves this one, nothing sexier than a woman who loves her doppelbock!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,tectactoe,4,"Pours a color close to inky black at first, but shows some deep ruby red clarity when held up to the light. A big, creamy, light-tan head tops this one off - nice retention, however much to my surprise, not much lace is left behind.  Nose is powerful, right from the start. Caramel malts take center stage with some sweet, brown sugar heavy in the background. Light fruits also help contribute to the sweet smelling aroma - raisins, plums - all covered in molasses. Some grains help dry things out a little bit and stop the aroma from being too overpowered with sweetness.  Up front, the alcohol is noticeable, especially considering the brew is only 6.7% ABV, but it's far from off-putting. It meshes with the dark fruits to give almost a wine-like presence and sweetness. This beer is nearly as sweet as it smells - molasses, syrup, deep black licorice, and a faint spice, somewhat reminiscent of anise. Rustic, dry cocoa flavors hide in the back, but are definitely there.  Roasted malts? A little. But I'm getting a larger quantity of sweetness from the malts here - this brew is very caramely and toffee-like. Some earthy undertones trace the outline for this beer, with some herbal hop aromas, slightly tea-like on the tail end. Aftertaste is a fading, earthy caramel sweetness with a hint of dry bitterness. Medium bodied, light creaminess to it on the palate, medium amount of carbonation.  Very robust and full-flavored brew. Haven't had many Doppelbocks, but this one was certainly tasty. Packed with intense malt and sweetness without being cloying - very impressive. Score may adjust once I open up and sample more and more beers of the style, but this is definitely something I'd like to have again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Efay,4.26,"I've heard from many people that this beer was excellent, but I kinda held off of it for awhile. Today I saw it in stock at the store and decided to give it a try. Had my tries of bocks but never had a doppelbock.  A- Lot's of carbonation and lots of foam. This foam is extremely creamy, and is a pale brown color. The body is almost pitch black, but some light passes through and you can see a hue of dark brown. Lots of thick lacing.  S- Subtle roasted malts, with some dark chocolate. Smells very sweet. Maybe a hint of dried fruit. This smells aren't the strong point in this brew. Every thing is very subtle.  T- Roasted bitter malts and chocolate are nice and appropriate.Some burnt sugar that definitely makes this an after meal must.  M- Medium bodied and light amounts of carbonation. This is highly drinkable and goes down extremely smooth.  O- Even though its lacking in smells, the taste and easy drinkability make up for it and make up for where it lacks. This is much like a porter but different at the same time, minus the higher drinkablity that comes from this doppelbock. I definitely enjoy this more than a typical porter though.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The scent is of raisin and molasses, sweet and dry. Theres a Hint of malt in the back but the molasses wins out.  This is smooth on the tongue, smoky sweet and dry. There's a nice burnt malt flavor but offset by a sweet prune or raisin. The burnt blends well with the sweet and creates a tasty well balanced bock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Sweet and sugary up front, followed by some dark roasty notes and a lingering bitterness on the followthrough. Very sweet and malty with just enough edge to make it interesting.

39,131,Groenebeor,4.4,"Ayinger undoubtedly makes some of the best German beers exported to the US. Celebrator is perhaps their best offering.  Celebrator pours a dark brown/ruby red in the light. Small off white head that sometimes will cling to your glass, if your glass is clean and the beer fresh.  I don't get a lot of nose from this beer honestly, but what little I get smells a bit like toasted rye bread and a touch of raisin.  The first thing you notice when drinking this beer is the amazingly thick mouthfeel. It feels a bit like a well syrupped coffee, but tastes more like coffee beer with dried fruit on the back end. Very little alcohol spiciness. Deep, dark chocolate, toasted bread, and malted milk.  One of the best doppelbocks - if you prefer your doppelbock to be more fruity, and have coffee overtones, this is the go to for you.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S: Roast, love, prunes, and a hint of banana. Rather mild for the style. As the beer warms, prunes come out more and more.  T: Similar to the aroma. Roast is interestingly quite strong, particularly for a style it's not really expected in. Bready malts are also quite strong - this reminds me of having a rye bread. Raisins and clove come out behind the roast and breadiness, though they are mild.  M: Medium to thick mouthfeel with creamy carbonation.

39,131,thehyperduck,4.7,"330 mL bottle from the LCBO; no packaging/best before date. This is one of those beers that I've basically never heard anything bad about, ever - it's been on my 'must try' list for a while, and I'm glad to finally scratch it off that one. I must point out that I haven't had a lot of doppelbocks, and the few that I have tried didn't really impress me that much... but maybe this one will turn out to be the brew that changes my outlook on the style. Poured into a mug.  Pours a deep brownish-black colour; looks nearly opaque, but under the light I can make out some crimson tinges and the translucency of the brew. Topped with two fingers of puffy, creamy, off white-coloured head that wilts slowly over the next few minutes, leaving behind a smooth, dense cap about 1/2 a cm thick, and smears of lacing on the sides. The aroma is pleasing and intensely malty, with hints of raisins, butterscotch, figs, fruitcake, brown sugar and sweet potatoes. I might be imagining the smoky notes, but with or without them the bouquet is rich and enticing.  And that richness carries over into the flavours, as this is one of the tastiest dark lagers I have had in my many years on BA. Some light brown sugar or molasses sweetness is quickly overpowered by figs and raisins, some toasted, biscuity malts, with the smooth finish being dominated by bittersweet notes of baker's chocolate and a pleasant demerara sugar sweetness. The aftertaste is mostly lingering roast and a weak hint of booze. On the heftier side of medium-bodied, with mild carbonation that gently prickles the tongue. The mouthfeel is silky-smooth, and even though it's extremely easy to drink this stuff, the small sample means I'd rather savour what precious little I have.  Final Grade: 4.70, a nearly flawless A+. Ayinger Celebrator was just what I needed - a doppelbock to convince me that I don't hate doppelbocks. I have trouble envisioning a more finely-crafted bock than Celebrator - it really is the gold standard; the doppelbock that other doppelbocks should aspire to be like, and an amazingly drinkable strong lager that I will definitely pick up again at some point. Highly recommended to newbies as an introductory bock, and something worth stocking up on if it isn't always available in your area.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,axeman9182,4.22,"11.2 oz bottle, allowed to warm before being poured into my Brooklyn Brewery tulip.  Celebrator pours a bit short of solid black, as a good amount of ruby highlights are easily appreciable. About a finger and a half of khaki colored foam crowns the beer and shows a little bit of endurance. Lacing leaves something to be desired though. The nose is comprised of a very nice blend of biscuit and toffee aromas. The flavor profile has a bit more depth, as a light dusting of chocolate serves as a bridge from the toasty bread to caramel centerpieces, and a subtle dried fig note appears during the finish. If at least of those secondary characteristics was a bit more developed, everything would be just about perfect. The body is picturesque, full and sturdy, while remaining as far away from viscous as a sub 7% ABV beer should. Carbonation is nicely understated. It's easy to see why Ayinger's Celebrator is considered a classic version of the style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The alcohol is a touch medicinal, and it integrates well with the fruity, lightly grainy smelling malts.  T-The taste is not quite a fruity as the smell. I get molasses, rum, tobacco, the aforementioned dark fruits, and just a touch of medicinal alcohol. The flavors are complex and long-lasting. There is just a touch of bitterness at the end.  M-The feel is medium bodied and surprisingly crisp for the style. This isn't to say there is a bunch of carbonation, because there isn't, but the beer is not heavy or syrupy, and the feel is perfectly matched for the flavors.

39,131,Bouleboubier,4.7,"Had only had this once, out of the bottle, years ago. Why haven't I had this again? Wow!  Among the darkest (if not THE darkest) and thickest-looking doppelbocks I can recall. The foam is a bit lighter than I would have expected (no roasted barley, just decocted?). Despite its appearance, it doesn't look like a (dry) stout. Looks heartier, that's for sure.  First impression of the smell is the unmistakably molasses, almost ginger snap aroma. Comes across like a dark, dense, molasses-y German bread with a bit of underlying dark fruit (black grape, cherry), and a kiss of alcohol.  While the taste, like the smell, screams ""dark-toasty, lightly-spiced, dense, dark bread"", I can't help but get a little peppermint(?!), as in, candy cane. Super rich-malty. The overall taste, maybe more than any other (German) beer, is that of ""liquid bread"". The body, for me, exhibits a filling-smooth, almost doughy quality. Perhaps it could be a little cleaner - but that's only what I'd expect from a lager. Can't argue with what this offers though. Such a rich malt character! - Dark-toasted bread - dark, but not roasty or bitter - bold molasses and background cherry. The depth of the malt flavor is excellent - sticks around on the palate for what seems endlessly.  This beer has some complexity but also very (unique) bold/loud flavors - more character and depth, but less clean than most.

It pours an incredibly dark mahogany-brown, maybe as close as you can get to black without it being quite black. (It does radiate a very solemn red in its center when you hold it up to the light.)  A very sweet nose: brown sugar, carmel, rum raisins and brandy. Flavor-wise I would venture something like ""that combination indicated above dumped in a bowl of very good-quality Scottish Oatmeal, with maybe some blackstrap honey added on top as a garnish."" Amazingly the mouthfeel is as silky-smooth as can be, even the grainy-mealy finish is delivered as more of an afterthought than a real kick.  I think this is one of the classic beers out there.

39,131,williamjbauer,4.22,"Bottled served in a weizen glass. Had this a few times but finally trying it again to review it.  Pours deep dark brown with hints of garnet light on the edges of the glass, the 2 finger khaki head quickly forms and fades fast leaving a minimally sticky lacing and a thin layer of head remaining over the beer.  Aroma is subtle with smokey notes, savory meat, dark fruits, molasses, is inviting but not overly strong. The flavor too is subtle as the start with caramel sweetness on the tip of the tongue that evolves into a smoked meat and a smooth tobacco character flavor on the middle palate with dark fruits, dates, raisins, and sizable molasses and caramel notes. The finish is pretty bitter and the alcohol is quick present which was surprising to me considering the ABV is only 6.7%.  Mouthfeel is smooth, wet, with moderate body, and medium-low carbonation.  Celebrator is a high quality Doppelbock with a really cool but gimmicky advertising goat charm and great label.

Having it poured into the correct stemmed vase-like glass adds to the enjoyment as well.  Just a joy to find it on-tap!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,rangerred,3.84,"330ml bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a nearly opaque dark brown with a half finger tan head that fades rather quickly leaving just a tiny bit of foam on top. No lacing.  Aroma is full of malt. Lots of caramel, toffee, and burnt sugar along with an almost soy sauce like character but it is not off-putting. A touch of chocolate as well.  The flavor is very heavy on the burnt sugar/caramel but it doesn't become astringent. This leads to some milk chocolate and a touch of coffee and toast. A little hop bitterness towards the finish but it is far in the background. Malt dominates. Mouthfeel is full and sticky/sweet but stays just below being cloying.  Overall, one of the best Doppelbocks out there. This is probably one of my least favorite styles but I can appreciate it for what it is; a nice, malty, cold weather beer and this one really packs in tons of flavor.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,tarheels86,3.58,"355mL. Pours a deep deep ruby with lower carbonation and a small, dark tan, lingering head. Aroma is black cherries, coffee, minerals, coffee. Taste is less fruity, almost like a smoked beer with tobacco, chocolate, savory meat, cinnamon. Nice mix of roasted coffee and mild, sweet barbeque. Raisins, brown sugar, black cherry soda and caramel come through. Overall very drinkable, lighter palate, neutral aftertaste. Fairly decent, but again this is one of the few decent doppelbocks to be distributed stateside. Like almost all German beers, they don't hold up well in the bottle. Need to find this on tap or stick with local dunkels in Germany. Or better yet, pilsners/lagers.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,RichardMNixon,4.13,"First time I'm rereviewing a beer, with a bit more experience and I think a better or fresher bottle of it.  It pours a dark ruby-root beer colored body with a finger and a half of persistent off-white head. The smell, while pleasant, is faint and is the beer's major weakness. The mouthfeel was chewy and perfectly carbonated at first. As the beer warmed, the caramel scent grew stronger, improving the aroma, but the mouthfeel weakened, becoming more watery and one-dimensional. If there's some perfect temperature sweet-spot where the two trends lined up it would be marvelous. The taste is certainly the selling point. Leads off with a burst of caramel that drops off slowly leading up to an aftertaste of chocolate and toffee. These guys know their malts.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,denver10,4.08,"Pours deep brown with a nice thick, frothy khaki head. Smell and taste is pretty much straight up raisin bread, minus the cinnamon but add some molasses. Flavor includes a nice creamy finish with a splash of some cocoa. A medium bodied to fuller, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, very nice. Glad I finally got to try this one and I will definitely try it again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Dope,4.1,"A: Pours a dark mahogany. Huge light brown head. Fades very slowly, however only leaves fluffy tufts of lacing behind here and there.  S: Loads of dark fruits. Raisin, grapes, cherry, plums and fig. Very earthy with some hints of cocoa and caramel.  T: As mentioned above, dark fruit overload. There's cherries, raisin, figs, prunes and grapes. Lots of them. Very earthy in the middle. Hints of cocoa on the back end with more hints of dark fruit, slightly drying.  M: Medium bodied, a bit drying.  O: A well-attenuated example of the style. Lots are very sweet, this is actually surprisingly dry. The earthiness and dark fruits really shine here. Excellent beer, surprising complexity in only 6.7%.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Ford,4.5,"If you like Doppelbock's, this one is outstanding.  Had it at the Flying Saucer Beerfeast in Sugar Land, Texas.  All the typical DPB flavors. Really was great. Had to go back for more on this one at the festival.  I wish I could have tried it side by side with Real Ale's 16th anniversary Dopplebock. Would love to compare them head to head.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,RussBecker1,4.6,"Whew! This is one helluva beer. This doppelbock has a malt profile unlike anything I have ever tasted. One of the most complexly balanced flavors I have ever had the pleasure of tasting and without question the best doppelbock I have gotten my hands on. The profile begins with a smooth hit of tangy molasses, but directly before that flavor gets to be too much, the profile shifts to a great hit of hop bitterness and a twinge of alcohol. In addition I got a bit of what I think may be coriander, and it was all wrapped up beautifully with a harsh smoke note and a beautiful caramel coffee finish. It is not often I find doppelbock, but when I do I snatch up every bottle I can get my hands on.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,brystmar,3.9,"Plastic goat hangs around the neck of the bottle. Brown body, tan head, not the best retention. Toasty malts, bready aroma. Smells slightly sweet, not pungent enough.  Toasty, sweet malts; deliciously creamy body; finishes dry. An enjoyable beer that's quite good for the style, but definitely doesn't deserve a spot in the Top 100.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,jondeelee,4.5,"Celebrator opens with a rich, malty, yeasty nose, liquid breads and bread dough spilling forth in waves of marble rye, French baguette, honey wheat, and thick brown bread, all topped with a gooey thread of molasses and wildflower honey. Add to this a good measure of brown sugar, vanilla, caramel, toffee, and lighter touches of coffee and cream, as well as a good range of fruit esters, including raisin, fig, black cherry, orange liqueur, date, and prune. The aromas aren’t necessarily powerful—perhaps a seven in terms of sheer strength—but they are exquisitely nuanced, balanced, and developed, resulting in a nose that only lightly taps your chin, but still somehow knocks you to the floor.  On the tongue, the beer opens with a wave of bread dough and toast crust that carries mainly dark wheat and grain flavors, but these are soon joined by a rush of molasses and brown sugar, and following just behind, caramel, toffee, and creamed coffee, as well as darker fruit esters (fig, prune, date, black cherry). In subsequent sips the molasses, date, fig, prune, and black cherry notes come out more clearly, kept earthbound by marble rye bread, spent grains, and touches of pepper. Late in the mouthful a cola, or perhaps kola nut-like flavor emerges, and this carries into the aftertaste, along with a surprising amount of sugars and breads, which linger on the tongue for a very long time in syrupy goodness. Mouthfeel is a slick, syrupy medium, and carbonation is medium.  Overall, this is one of the finer Doppelbocks on the market, and while it’s not one of the strongest, it is one of the more balanced, flavorful, and all-around fantastic examples available. Too many beers sacrifice the beauty of nuance and tempering for beat-you-over-the-head hoppiness/sugars/alcohol/etc., and it’s very nice to see a beer that’s obviously been made by someone who knows the supreme strengths of subtlety and crafty understatement.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,GMB,4.12,"Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock pours a black body that turns deep crimson red when held against a strong light source. A moderate pour and some vigorous swirling fail to produce any head to speak of.  The beer's nose is very nice: Roasted malts suggest molasses and chocolate; the yeast and alcohol contribute the smell of raisins and prunes. There is a faint tinny aroma at first, but it seems to disappear after the initial sniffs.  The taste follows the nose, but is much richer: chocolate and molasses. The taste of alcohol is nicely balanced; present but not intrusive. As the beer warms, the flavor of dark raisins moves to the fore and mingles with the buttery yeast-derived flavors. Imagine butter-braised raisins and prunes, molasses, and bittersweet chocolate.  The beer's body is full and rich, as one expects from doppelbocks. There is perhaps too little carbonation. Creamy froth would augment the appeal of these flavors.  The nice balance of alcohol-derived and roasted-malt flavors that one finds in Ayinger's Celebrator places it among the best representatives of the Duppelbock style. This is a delicious beer, and I'd gladly drink a more. Still, I hold out hope that one day I'll run across a rendition of this style that delivers at every level. This one didn't.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,TheBrewo,4.44,"We pour a deep nut brown brew, which lightens up to a clean chocolate coloring around the edges. A one finger medium brown head sits on top, showing okay retention. There is no lacing to be found until little rings appear as the beer disappears. There is, however, a nice bubbly sheet with a flick of the wrist. There is mild haze, no sediment, and carbonation appears standard. The aroma is rich with caramel, toffee, and bittering molasses. Warm cashew nuttiness mixes, with chocolate malts, a hefty roastiness. Chalk, chocolate syrup, and salt round up the end. Our first impression is that there is fantastic depth to the malts. As we sip, buttery roast, bread, coffee, and tinny metallics open the floor. Brown sugar sweetness and a nice banana sweetness help to cut any initial bitterness. The middle peaks with caramel, white sugar, tin, and buttercream. These pull us to the end, where milky cream and butter enhance and mix with a final drop of char before a tidal wave of caramel malts to wash. The aftertaste breathes with brown sugar, grassy bitter hop balance, caramel malts, sweet toffee, and alcohol. The body is medium to full, and the carbonation is light to medium. There is beautiful slurp, cream, and froth with each sip, and there is a robust stickiness left around the mouth. The palate is cooled and coating, with a final lick of astringency. The abv is appropriate, and drinkability is excellent.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. It was savory, sweet, and salty, exhibiting the perfect malts bill for a doppelbock. There was a great level to the sweetness, but an evenly mixing bitterness for the balance. This beer is highly satisfying, and an instant classic amongst any of the German originals.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Sweet malt and dark fruits throughout, finishing with a light malty, pleasant fruit finish. Almost perfectly balanced and pleasant. Bravo. I have had interesting results aging this beer. Most bottles at 2 or 3 years old have lost some of their intense malt and fruit flavors, but have mellowed and integrated into an interesting malty bock. Some bottles lose most of their flavor and are not that interesting. A few others develop into a superb creamy, malty uber-bock that is very delicious. Most of these bottles were from a case that I cellared, so the differences are probably not due to batch differences. The worst of these is still ok to drink and most are still very nice, so it has been worth it for the exceptional aged bottles.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,DerekP,4.3,"With my nose in the bottle I can smell a strong aroma of amber/caramel malts. Glory be to the beer gods! In a sizable mug with a confident handle, I poured an excited beer with an enormous head. Glory be to the beer gods!  Appearance is dark brown, almost black. Big head at first, but disappeared almost completely. That said, mahogany hints at the bottom help this beer look very inviting. 4/5  An aroma of burnt raisins, cold coffee, roasted grains, and very warm alcohol underneath all that goodness. This beer asks to be quaffed! Well, actually that we be a bad idea. Sip slowly... 4/5  Sweetness up front with a heavy dose of caramel malts. Bittering hops and alcohol hit the tongue on the back and the middle, respectively. Malty, malty, malty. Raisin bread, figs, caramel, hops for balance. Good stuff! 4.5/5  Feels slick in the mouth. Enough hops for the body which is frankly, heavy (anyone who says differently needs to take a break from beer). Alcohol lingers a bit, but solid. 4/5  Overall: 4.5/5 (very tasty!)",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Flavor is similar to the nose but a little better. Again mild watered down dark fruit. Plum, prune, figs and raisin. Some dark euro malt.  Mouth is light bodied with med+ creamy carb.  Overall this is a little bit of a disappointment after not having one in about 6-7 years. I remember it being better. I think my palate is just better trained now. Not a bad beer by any means. Easy to drink. Just nothing special.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,DocJitsu,4.45,"Pours medium to dark brown, with lighter brown edges, where light passes through. This beer looks remarkably like a cola. The foamy head, the carbonation bubbles that accumulate on the side of the glass and the lighter brown glints around the bottom and edges of the glass are reminiscent of a glass of brown cola. The aroma is rich and quite large. Horehound candy, sorghum, prunes, and heavy brown sugar characterize the nose. The flavor is so big it's nearly vulgar. I said nearly. There was still quite a bit of a tact employed in stopping just short of over the top. It is almost like drinking liquid candy. I respect this beer for how bold it is, if for no other reason at all. I've had imperial stouts and barleywines with less personality. All of this big malty flavor at only 6.7% ABV. Probably because the beer was engineered in a fashion to retain more unfermentable sugars. I detect some chocolate liqueur, brown sugar, and prunes. There's just the faintest bitterness at the finish to help offset the sweetness. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied with very little scrubbing on the tongue. This is not necessarily a style that I'd say is in my wheelhouse, but I do appreciate this beer. I wish it wasn't $14.99 a four-pack. Otherwise, I'd keep it in my fridge all the time as an alternative to port wine for an after dinner dessert drink.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The nose has a caramel sweetness and subtle yeastiness. Very little spice is present. As expected, the taste is rich and bready with a lingering sweetness. There is almost no bitterness on the back end and the alcohol is well hidden. There is a slight fruitiness reminiscent of prunes followed by notes of tobacco. Medium bodies beer that feels heavy during this hot summer day. Overall, this beer is as expected and a reliable doppelbock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,bnes09,4.03,"Dark chocolate brown. Pours a thin head with no retention and zero lacing. Opaque quality of the brew and lack of head reminds me of prune juice.  Tons of sweet dark fruits and malts in the aroma along with a piney spice and touch of alcohol.  Flavor profile is highly roasted with toasty whole wheat and smooth dark chocolate. Prune sweetness mellows things out a bit. Mild earthy hop comes to life and attempts to balance but is quickly reminded that this beer is all about the malt.  Burly medium to full body with lots of lingering malt texture. Fairly low carbonation. Smooth, slick feel.  Not as good as I expected but still really solid.

39,131,JohnnyHopps,4.49,"I first had this beer about three years ago. Since that time, I have grown to appreciate the dopplebock style and wanted to revisit this one. This is the first time I have reviewed the beer.  Poured from bottle into a pint glass, a very nice brown sugary aroma was apparent. The dopplebock appeared a very dark brown and allowed a half inch mocha-colored head at the top of the glass. For the style, it exhibits an appropriate amount of retention. The initial taste was a sweet brown sugar with a bread/biscuit backbone. It almost comes off like a good homemade cookie in liquid form. There even seems to be a hint of spice or cinnamon involved. The aftertaste is moderately warming with the sweetness of the brown sugar yeilding into a molasses flavor. The impression of thickness allows the flavor to linger.  This is about as close to perfect as one can get for this style. Of course, the fact that it is actually made in Germany only helps the cause.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

In the bottle this is a gorgeous smell of sweet brown sugar which is balanced by a savory roastiness.  There is really no head which might seem a real negative but this is helped by a beautiful dark oaky red brown colour. In the mouth there is fullish penetrating prune, meat and a luxurious dry chewy earthy end. Bit of fizz in there too. Absolutely totally delicious. And do I detect an echo of the classic taste of Old Peculier in there as well? That's probably taking things a bit too far but without a doubt this deserves all the praise it gets.

Roasty malt and over-ripe fruits like raisin and fig. Overall its pretty sweet and quite inviting.  T: Roasty malts, sweet molasses and fruits similar to the smell. Dark sugars provide a toffee like taste. Smooth and a great representation of a doppelbock.  M: Lighter body than I expected, a little watery. However it is quite balanced and very easy drinking.

39,131,kevanb,4.18,"Celebrator pours a deep dark brown, almost black color, hints of ruby and burgundy when held to the light and despite the dark color, it has a clear complexion with no haze. A nice tan caramel colored head sits atop the beer with very compact bubbles that dissipates quickly leaving behind only the lightest lacing. The aroma is great, huge notes of dark malt and heavy grains, some faint chocolate is also apparent as well as a hint of tobacco and molasses. The grains really dominate the nose, really brings to life the phrase ""bread in a glass."" The flavors are just as nice, big notes of malt and grain, like a nice dark brown bread, some hints of cocoa, molasses with tobacco at the end. I was almost expecting some woodiness, but it never really comes out, there is such an emphasis on the malt bill that the auxiliary flavors don't really take over like they would in a stout or porter. The one unexpected element to the palate is some dark fruit, black cherry or plums, which added a nice layer of complexity and helped tone down the toasted malt flavors and darker grain and chocolate. The body is somewhat thin when thinking about the flavor profile and the carbonation also a bit higher than I would think is needed, but it's sticky and coats the mouth very well.  Verdict: Solid stuff from Ayinger. Great mix of flavors that strikes a great balance, the body leaves a bit to be desired, but make no mistake, this is a fantastic beer that is artfully crafted and is one everyone should try.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,thecheapies,4.35,"Celebrator, poured into a pint glass (wish I had the stemmed Celebrator glass; debated on using a snifter or a mug).  Looks dark ruby-brown with a rich khaki head that capped tight at a finger-and-a-half. I can imagine a regal pour if I used a tulip or snifter.  Sweet dark, figgy malts, chalky yeast, and a muffle of earthy hops. Slight stingy tartness from a black cherry note.  Hardcore malty-good. Big thick slices of brown bread, caramelized sugars, pressed cherry juice, dates, alcohol, roasted cereals, molasses, and nutty coffee. Tremendously complex, and the sweetness doesn’t overpower the intricacies. If you seek it, you can taste bitter cocoa. If you seek it, you can taste caramel or toffee. If you want to concentrate on the fruity character, you can taste apple/pear, grapes, or red currant. A near-perfect doppelbock.  Light carbonation. Filled-out body with a lots of stickiness. Gluggy.  A hard-to-top doppelbock. My favorite, and quite possibly the best-there-will-be.

39,131,endovelico,3.68,"My quest for the perfect Bock has been a long one, similar to what is happening to me with the Barley wines; It's a style that on paper seems like my chosen stuck-on-an-island drink but alas no exemplar I've had has stood out has anything other than a average to good quaffer.  You can imagine the excitement i was in when i had the chance to first open this legendary brew, that was sure to break the spree.  The brew was much darker than i had thought and much more effervescence, not necessarily over-foaming, just showing lots of bubbles. The aroma is mute and closed, something i tend to feel when sniffing heavy beers like Bocks and Barley Wines - might this be related with my apparent spree?. You still feel that melanoidin quality which makes its appearance in the taste profile, exactly what you would expect after smelling the beer. In addition, a strong yeast bite character also reveals itself in the mouth alongside a coke like syrupy caramel taste/texture.  It's full bodied, not very bitter and in my opinion much more carbonated than it needs to be. I wish i had liken this more, i really do, but this one is not for me, even if it's a beer whose technical merits are beyond discussion.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,steveh,4.39,"Went in search of some .5 liter bottles of Salvator, due to some discussion of world-class beers and other conversation, but came up short. Picked up some Celebrator instead since I haven't sampled it in a (long) while and have been meaning to. Perfect for a 90° day, right?  11.2 ounce brown bottles in a $10 4 pack. No dating on the labels. Only 6.7? Man, that seemed so strong when I first discovered this brew back in the mid-80s.  A -- Gushered bottle on opening. Could be age, could be shaken up a little on the drive, but it had set in the fridge a while before capping. Deep, clear chestnut color with red highlights when held to the light. Dense light tan head that didn't hold as long as I'd have expected.  S -- Rich, dark bread crust character up front, some mild caramel and chocolate characters back, with some vague dark fruit peaking through.  T -- Same rich, toasted dark bread crust character up front, mild dark fruits thru the middle, finishes with a pepperiness from alcohol and an aftertaste that is lightly caramel, almost molasses-like.  M -- Mouthfeel is chewy and almost thick and syrupy, body is medium-full and smooth with a dry finish that fights a sticky after-feeling.  O -- A very good take on the style, and would have received higher marks without the gusher -- I'll amend that with the next bottles if they're cleaner.  This is certainly the quintessential ""liquid bread."" You could almost make a sandwich out of it.

S - The beer has a very rich and complex malt smell (caramel, chocolate, toasted bread) with some hints of vanilla, cherries and dark fruit (prunes, dates).  T - This is complex like no other doppelbock out there! It starts out fairly typical, with lots of caramel and bread and a slight fruitiness to it, but then I get a massive chocolate and vanilla taste, which ends with a very nice and lingering finish, with hints of toast, coffee and prunes. There are also some minor vinous qualities and a slight hint of honey in the after-taste.  M - Medium body, medium carbonation. Very smooth and velvety on the palate. The alcohol barely shows, even after the beer has warmed up.  O - Hands down, this is the pinnacle of the style.

The head had big carbonation bubbles entrapped within and faded quite fast. Upon fading it left a persistent film on the surface of the brew.  Smell – A big bready brown bread aroma with strong roasted malts aromas. Mixed in with the breadiness there is a nice sweetness of molasses and brown sugar rounding out the roast very nicely.  Taste – A thick bready base with big roasted malt flavors greets the tongue nicely. The taste begins a little on the drier side and sweetness as notes of brown sugar and molasses enter the scene. At the end, the roastiness, when mixed with the sweet creates a somewhat sweetened coffee flavor. This brew has some very nice transitions and all the flavors at all times complement each other very nicely. Fantastic.  Mouthfeel – Quite a creamy body with a lower level of carbonation.

Balanced against the refined fragrance of molasses is that of spicy phenol, sweet caramel, and a toasted malt character.  Taste: Beautiful and complex. The first property that takes ahold and hangs on for the entire ride is that of malt and molasses. Subtly, the essence of fig augments the flavor. Piercingly, hops enter to contrast the sweet foundation and create dissonance in this otherwise harmonious symphony of flavor. During the recapitulation, an essence of alcohol and grain are present to usher this dark nectar to an unceasing end.  Mouth-feel: Unable to break the grips of its captor (rich, full bodied, thick malt), the carbonation, fully infused, makes this beer smooth.

39,131,UCLABrewN84,4.27,"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson brown with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark bread, wheat/grain, caramel, and some subtle cocoa aromas. Taste is of dark wheat/multi-grain bread, caramel, and some cocoa flavors on the finish. I am also getting some dark fruit flavors as the beer warms. This beer has a slightly crisp carbonation level with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a very nice set of flavors that work together extremely well.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,cradke,4.33,"Appearance: Dark brown. Thick. Pours a thin but present head. Good carbonation.  Smell: Chocolates. Wheat and grain notes. Clean and complex.  Taste: Again, lots of chocolate here. Great wheat and grain notes. Almost like having a slice of rye/pumpernickel bread. Perfect sweetness to it. Very little alcohol. Aftertaste lasts for a minute and keep evolving.  Mouthfeel: A bit thin for my taste but the carbonation is spot on. Everything does play well with the carbonation though.  Overall: It's kind of hard to quantify why this beer is so good, but, it is. It's a great German in that it's beauty is in it's complexity and restraint. It's pleasant and delicious.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,TheSixthRing,4.35,"Appearance - Pours a beautiful dark brown with a slight amber red tinge. Head pours a light caramel, is 2-3 fingers thick, great retention, and the lace is fine and sticky.  Smell - A lot of caramel, coffee and toffee aromas on the nose.  Taste - A complex array of various dark, sweet flavors; cappucino, caramel, toffee. It's all there, and in abundance. Very rich.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and creamy. Full-bodied.  Overall - Works great as a dessert beer. As a session beer? Not so much. The richness can get a bit overwhelming, but when sipped and enjoyed over a decent amount of time, it's quite rewarding.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,NardiByNature,4.32,"Decent head takes its time to settle into a decent cap on top of this clean dark brown body with some ruby tinge. Smells are beefy dark fruits, cereals, even soy sauce. This beer has an almost savory taste and a good deal of dried fruits. Some roasted barley and coffee. Finishes crisp, chewy, and a little spicy. Definitely enjoyable. I’d like to compare this one to the Troegenator sometime.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The aroma has a sweet edge to it; hazelnut; very light note of roasted grain. The taste remains awesome; sweet but not cloyingly so; suggestions of hazelnuts, toffee and caramel, light brown sugar; mild booziness; phenol hints. Heavy body; rich and sticky; very light alcohol warmth.  Well, I toned-down some of my ratings although the taste remains a ""5"". There is a reason this beer is considered world-class. It's balanced and very approachable for the style. You can't go wrong with this doppelbock.  -------------------------- This doppelbock has it all. Rich, dark color; fat, dark fig and date and currant aroma with all the associated dark malt goodness in the smell and taste; additional tastiness in the bittering and excellent mouthfeel qualities. I doubt I can expand on any other rave review of this beer. So I'll just leave it at one needs to try this beer at least once in their life. It's that good!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,MattSweatshirt,4.25,"Foamy two finger light brown head. Slightly see-through brown and deep ruby body. The pilsner glass helps out the look of this beer. Bread, dark fruit, and molasses all jump out at once. There is a slight alcohol presence. Bread, molasses, and the dark fruits dominate the taste. There is a definite alcohol flavor. The hops are very subdued. A lovely creamy mouthfeel on this doppelbock and it has a little fuller in body than Optimator.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,AgentMunky,4.48,"Poured from a 33cL bottle into a brandy snifter. No visible date marking.  A: It pours remarkably dark, like molasses mixed with blood. Opaque, with the merest ruby glints in direct light. Almost black in the shadows. Thin head disperses quickly.  S: Big, boozy, and full of grapes (and other fruit). Sadly, once the first sip is taken, all the allure of the nose vanishes.  T/M: Delicious! A really great doppelbock, a perfect example of the style. Thick and almost syrupy, dripping with dark fruits and full malt. Very little bitterness; no hop presence. A smooth mouthfeel with a touch of carbonation that prevents the sugary fruits from being oppressive.  O: This beer is very highly rated, and deservedly so. A really excellent German beer, dark and sweet, and highly recommended. Would drink again. Easy drinking and rewarding.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S- Caramel, dark fruits, chocolate, bread, sweet coffee. Really nice and promising.  T- Wow, this is what a Doppelbock wants to be when they grow up. I taste the caramel/chocolate sweetness up front, fig/plum earthiness mid palate, enough hops to balance on the finish. Also a little alcohol on the finish. Well blended as the flavors seem to change while still being as one.  M- Outstanding mouthfeel, silky smooth without being creamy or sticky. Easy drinker. Not heavy, not light, just right  O- This is the gold standard for the style, worthy of the good reviews and hype.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ehammond1,4.32,"Bottle  Texas Liquor Carlsbad, CA  A dark brown pour with no clarity and a very large, big-bubbled dark brown head that rises quickly to the top of the tulip and stays perched there for quite some time. Gorgeous beer, though surprisingly, it doesn't leave much stick down the glass.  A rich aroma of dark fruits, black bread, brown sugar, and molasses. Complex and appropriate.  The flavor follows similarly, with the dark fruit and molasses coming together to create something lovely. Low bitterness and a rich malt character balance this out without being overly sweet.  If anything, I was a touch disappointed with this beer's mouthfeel. Even after the huge head, this beer seemed under carbonated upon drinking. The only disappointing aspect of this beer.  Per the style, this is damn near perfect.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Aromatic notes of toasted bread, raisin, dark brown sugar, and delicate chocolate. Rich and malty up front with note of dark bread, followed by dried fruits and light molasses flavours, finishing with a mild bitterness. There is a very mild smokey undertone to everything that lends another level of complexity and depth to this beer. Medium-bodied with low carbonation and a velvety smooth mouthfeel.

39,131,Jugs_McGhee,3.75,"11.2 fl oz brown glass bottle w/ crown cap cap served into an EKU 28 snifter in Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are high given its high rating. A hanging plastic goat lends the presentation a unique characteristic. I like the label art.  Served refrigerator cold and allowed to warm over the course of consumption.  A: Pours a one finger head of nice cream, good thickness, and okay retention - though the retention problem seems unlikely given the mere 6.7% ABV. Colour is a nontransparent solid black. Nothing strikes me, though it is appealing.  Sm: Chocolate, vanilla, caramelized malt, cream, and some toffee. Maybe some alcohol. A mild strength aroma.  T: Chocolate, with some dark malts as the foundation. Hints of cream and vanilla. Well balanced and built, if simple. A hint of nuts. Hints of roasted barley. Some mild layering, but nothing impressive.  Mf: Smooth and wet. Not creamy enough. Coarse enough to allow the flavours to come through without being unpleasant. Neither too thick nor too thin, but not perfect either.  Dr: Very drinkable. I do like it, but I don't know that it's the best doppelbock ever brewed. If it is, that doesn't bode well for doppelbocks as a style in my book. I'd certainly have it again, ideally on nitro-draught.  High B-  *** 04/14/18: I had to revisit this since it's been ~6 years since I've had it and my previous review is a bit rubbish.  $11.99 USD plus tax per 4 pack in Austin, TX. This beer doesn't currently appear in the Top 250 beers list, but it's #2 in the Best Beers from Germany list and #1 in the Best Doppelbock list. These facts alone are strong evidence of BeerAdvocate's American bias...  BOTTLE: Comes with the iconic billygoat hangtag. Label art is also iconic, depicting two brawling mountain goats. Brown glass. 11.2 fl oz format. Unbranded white pry-off crown cap.  6.7% ABV. ""Finest Bavarian Double Bock."" 6.7% ABV.  Served mildly chilled into a weissbierglas.  HEAD: Khaki in colour with thick cream and a coating viscous consistency. Frothy and flocculent though also dense, lasting an impossible 10+ minutes in spite of its high ABV. Leaves thick lacing on the sides of my glass as it slowly recedes. Starts at ~12cm in height and stays at ~7cm for a good 8 minutes before acquiescing its bid against gravity.  BODY: Dark deep ruby of dazzling vibrance. No yeast/lees are visible within. Transparent and quasitranslucent.  It's a formidable appearance for a 6.7% lager. Couldn't be truer to style. Carbonation seems perfect.  AROMA: Fresh and inviting aromatics of just-baked brown bread, caramel, luscious brown malt, the perfect amount of malty sweetness, and still more fresh baked bread. Scintillae of toasted bread crust and fleeting dark fruit emerge as it warms. No esters or phenols are present owing to its cleanly attenuating lager yeast.  As fine an aroma as I've found in any doppelbock I've encountered. The fresh baked bread aromatics are uniquely appealing; I can't wait to try it.  Aromatic intensity is moderate. I detect no off-flavours whatsoever, nor any boozy warmth.  Suggests a rich malty brew that earns doppelbock's reputation as ""liquid bread.""  TASTE & TEXTURE: Delivers on the promises of the aroma, bringing a rich malty backbone that's followed up by an impossible absence of residual sweetness...this is one of the best attenuated lagers I've ever tried.  Baked brown and black bread are evident, hiding hints of subtle dark fruit, toffee, and caramel in this beer's intricate melange of flavour. Rich amber malt/Munich malt finds its way in there, flirting with a Vienna-like caramelization. Roasty undertones leave this beer a bit drier than many expressions of the style, which coupled with its perfect attenuation helps coax out more duration and depth of flavour.  Not the meal in a glass I associate this style with ordinarily, but I guess that's to say it's more drinkable than most in spite of being a bit coarser and drier.  Unrefreshing (to style). Near perfectly carbonated.  Almost impeccably balanced.  OVERALL: I have no doubt this 4-pack sat in tepid neglect on the shelves of my local Total Wine before I picked it up, and nevertheless it drinks better than any doppelbock I can remember having in the last half-decade. Those who say lagers aren't complex haven't tried this. It's a classic German expression of a traditional style, and drinking it I can't help but wonder why Americans even attempt to rival it, let alone duplicate it.  If you want to nitpick, I guess you could say it's sub-7% ABV, which isn't quite perfectly to convention...if you hold up Salvator as the canonical expression of the style. (For me this supplants it outright.)  And there's a case to be made that Schneider Weisse has Ayinger beat - if you allow weizendoppelbock to be compared to doppelbock. Or Schlenkerla Eiche, if you allow smoked doppelbock. I guess the only rival for pure doppelbock is Andechs...  B+ / VERY GOOD",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Light brown head with quite huge bubbles, not very good retention but still a bit of lacing on the sides of the glass  S- Bready and caramel malts, with a bit of roastiness. Brown sugar is in the mix. Sweetness is balanced by a touch of earthy/slightly grassy hops and by a nice amount of undernotes: chocolate, coffee, dark fruits  T- The smell was promising, the taste is no let down. Bready malts, with prominent but never too strong caramel notes. Notes of chocolate and liquorice, expecially on the palate, with a touch of hop bitterness/earthyness to bring balance. Some dark/dried fruit notes may also be detected. A delicate touch of alcohol and spices gets in the mix, bringing a bit of life. Aftertaste on the earthy/sugary side, not dry or particullary refreshing but somehow still extremely pleasant. Many beers are bolder in flavour, but this one feels so perfectly balanced  M- Medium body, low carbonation, but just the perfect amount for this beer. Super smooth mouthfeel on both tongue and palate. Flavours and creamy smoothness linger on your palate for as long as the beer is there. Amazing  O- Complex, amazingly drinkable, perfectly balance.

A: Clear and very dark brown with reddish hues, a nice one-finger cream head with temporary lacing. S: Pecan nutty with brown sugar, green leafy hops, mild banana and coconut (like banana bread). Great. T: A very earthy and woody, deeply caramelized brown sugar. Hops are very subtle and are earthy until a slightly leafy finish. Quite good.

39,131,djbow,4.73,"A - Dark stout like brown with a deep ruby undertones. 2 finger head of thin off-white bubbles that dissipates fairly fast. Some lacing and minimal alcohol legs.  S - Caramel, toffee, toasted malt, dark tart fruit, bread, and mild alcohol. Subtle, yet complex nose that invites you to drink but does not punch you in the face.  T - Unlike the nose, the flavor of this beer is BIG. Caramel, toffee, toasted malt, dark tart fruit, bread, a bit of yeast (spice) and mild alcohol just lik the nose only amplified in the most pleasant manner. This beer is a very malt forward preparation, however, this inherent sweetness is counter balanced by a gently warming alcohol finish. Thus, balance is achieved.  M - Medium bodied, silky smoothly, easy to drink. This is part of the beer balance.  O - I am a Doppelbock fan and Celebrator is my favorite of this type. It is always consistant, available to me the best example of the style because it packs in big beer taste with just enough alcohol kick to make it fun. This is the point of a Doppelbock.

39,131,ThisWangsChung,4.04,"Poured into a Kostritzer pilsener glass.  A: Pours a dark yet lustrous ruby color, with a one finger off white head with unimpressive retention/lacing.  S: Rich dark fruit combined with some dark chocolate and a bit of licorice. An excellent smell.  T: Not quite as impressive as the smell would let on, but it's still excellent, for the most part. There's dark fruit, some caramel, toffee, chocolate, and licorice. All told, it's pretty complex and flavorful - but I think that the chocolate flavors clash with the malt base a little more than they should.  M: It has a medium-to-slightly-heavy body with high carbonation - though perhaps less smoothness than I'd like. Also has a somewhat brief, fleeting finish.  O: The way I see it, if this is like a brilliant painting of the Last Supper, then Troegs Troegenator is like an ordinary but well executed painting of Monica Belucci - I can really appreciate the artful precision that went into making this, but I'd take the Monica Belucci painting instead. Likewise, though it isn't as complex as Celebrator, I'd rather have Troegenator. Don't get me wrong, though, this is a great beer either way.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S - Candied sugar, toasted malt, light spice, dark tart fruit (plum?), bread, and a faint nose of alcohol. Subtly complex, and wonderfully inviting.  T - Follows the nose, though the flavors are much more pronounced. The toasted barley is heavier than expected, as is the yeast. It's a nice counterpoint to the sweetness of the malt and candied sugar. The fruit is most apparent towards the climax, where it strangely finishes with an alcoholic bite, though it's not intrusive. I like it quite a bit.  M - Medium bodied, not too thick, and finishes smoothly. Suits the flavors well.  D - It's a very good beer, though it's a bit of a let down given the current ratings.

Toasted grains, caramel, toffee, fig, a little coffee, and black raspberry. As the beer warms it emits scents of plum, perhaps raisin, and that boozy bock touch.  Taste: Yeah! It has that nice, helles kick of grassy hops. The mouthfeel is light, dry, and easily drinkable. The flavor is bitterer than the smell led me to believe.

Aroma is predominantly malty, lots of caramel, sweet esters, dark fruits and some notes of alcohol. Taste is slightly sweet upfront leading to a massive malt backbone that completely coats the palate. Wow, some alcohol burn in the finish. Completely unexpected from a double bock, but it is a pleasant finish. Lots of flavor packed in this bock. Not a lot of lacing, but the mouthfeel was very good.

A finger of tan head with small bubbles forms initially, but soon dissipates leaving only a thin layer behind.  S: Lots of dark fruit notes like raisins, figs, and dates. Alcohol is also noticeable, but mixes well. This is all layered on top of a smooth cocoa-malt base. A very rich aroma.  T: The taste mirrors the aroma with more of those sweet dark fruit flavors. The alcohol isn't as noticeable as it is in the aroma. The finishing flavor is that dusty dry cocoa flavor with a sweet dark malt note. Again, a very rich array of flavors.  M: It keeps from being too heavy or sticky sweet on the tongue, but still coats the mouth and has a not insubstantial body.  O: A very excellent example of the style. Sweet and rich without going overboard. A dessert beer, but a complex one that makes you stop and think about what flavors you're getting.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BrewerB,3.83,"Clear reddish copper, well formed medium-tan head sticking around a while.  Aroma includes a mix of prunes, toasted malts, and sweet grapes. Alcohol can be noticed but isn't harsh.  Maltiness taking front and center stage with a modest chocolate and toasted bread. Raisin in the medium-dry finish.  Medium bodied and moderately carbonated.  Not quite as good as I remember it being. The prominent maltiness seems toned down somewhat. Will have to give it another shot in the future.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,J23hc,4.32,"Enjoyed from pilsner glass. Pours with an appearance much like cola with a ruby red tinge. Good head that doesn't last too long. Brightly sweet malty smell, some fruits, cherry being one, and some cinnamon and ginger. Very full flavored, grassy, smokey, burnt malts, coffee. A little booze and bitterness in the finish. Smoothest and creamiest of its kind that I've had",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,gc4hokies,4.18,"In my review of Spaten Optimator, I noted that I poured these side by side to compare the flavors and characteristics.  To me the flavor of the Optimator is more to my liking. The Ayinger has many of the same flavor components. It's definitely more balanced and dry compared to the Spaten.  Color and appearance is almost identical, both are terrific.  Both have dark fruit flavors, plum, raisin and roasting caramel notes. This is slightly more dry and slightly less malty. If you are drinking more than one, this one is probably easier drinking.  Both are wonderful beers and the Ayinger is something I will be drinking again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Caramel, toffee, dark fruit and some butterscotch.  T: The toffee and caramel hit first accompanied by a perfect amount of roasted malt. Really nicely balanced. Finishes somewhat bitter with biscuit and phenol alcohol.  M: Medium-to-light carbonation despite the initial gratuitous head. May actually be slightly under-carbonated for my liking.  O: Easily one of the best dopplebocks I’ve had. The interplay between the caramel, roasted malt and biscuit is a treat. I’d probably enjoy this the most in the cool late-autumn months.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Raisins, molasses, plum mixed in as well. Faint wisps of vanilla bean.  Taste: Quite the malty backbone to this one notes of molasses, dark bread, raisins. The mouthfeel is very much smooth. Caramelized sugar, with a touch of smokiness in the back.  Notes: A very malty backbone very hearty. The drinkabilty of this is very good a dam tasty meal in a bottle.

Tons of sweet caramelization, molasses and bread up front, with some dark fruits right behind it. The taste is more of the same with a perfect balance of warming alcohol and just enough hop bitterness to cut through the primarily sweet flavor profile. The mouthfeel on this one is absolutely insane, probably the best beer I have ever had. Overall, this is a very nice beer and definitely worth seeking out.

Tastes similarly, malt and dark fruits dominate, but there are many other flavors I can't quite pinpoint. Coffee and chocolate in the back end maybe?  Mouthfeel is great, one of the smoothest beers I've ever had in my life.  If you are going to try only one doppelbock, make it this one.

S: The aroma gives off nice roast malts, light coffee, chocolate and some dark fruit, as well as some nice deep biscuit/bready malt notes. Light, noble hop presence, as well as some spicy lager yeast notes.  T/M: The flavor matches the aroma well, very rich and malty, crazy smooth for a lager. Well rounded roasted notes with more coffee and chocolate, a little molasses. The is a big munich malt presence underneath that lifts the other flavors, and it tapers off into a more herbal hoppy finish.  Overall: I can see the reason for the high ratings on this one, I have not had a doppelbock that could come close. Amazing beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

M - Extremely smooth. Nice carbonation with a syrupy and chewy mouthfeel. Medium to thick bodied. Slightly sweet aftertaste.

S: Smells sweet, fruity, chocolatey and a little boozy.  T: Dark fruit, caramel, coffee and a light hoppiness that melds with the sweet finish, with a little bit of alcohol in the finish as well.  M: Medium body with pretty light carbonation.  O: A real treat. Complex and absolutely delicious. Will definitely have this again (and again and again).",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,teromous,3.67,"A: Right off the bat, the appearance is fantastic. It's a dark beer the color of molasses, allowing beautiful dark brown tones of color to show through when held up to a light. The head stands about the width of my small finger, and sinks to a sliver across the top of the beer. It is a light tan color, and looks milky smooth across the surface. Lacing is already starting to build.  S: The beer is very light in the scent department. I pick up notes of caramel, some roasted grains are in there. Most of the scent is caramel.  T: There's a nice light smooth roasted flavor to this. It's a very good tasting Dopplebock.  M: It's a very smooth beer. It's medium bodied, and very easy to drink. Very light bitterness.  O: Overall it's a really good beer. It is, what a Doppelbock is. I would recommend it to another person, and would drink it again. I don't pick up much nose from this beer, and the taste is not very complex or rich as I'd want it to be. It's still a good beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,StJamesGate,4.15,"Ruby brown with a creamy tan head that fades to film. Raisin toast nose with some spice. Prune, dark rye and milk chocolate with branchy hops. Cherry pit finish and spicy linger. Medium, smooth, creamy and chewy.  Silky with no burn. Reminds me of Edmund Fitzgerald in that it’s so smooth, balanced and well-constructed that it’s hard to deconstruct why it’s so good. Paragon for the style.  2nd tasting, 8/16/12; exp.10/12: Cola body and head with brown sugar, fig, ash and meat juice on the nose. Christmas cake malts with some black grape, cherry stones in the middle, lots of crusty melanoidin notes, mulling spice end and a long dry bitter linger with echoes of ginger and bark.  exp. 02/09: Same color with stiff whipped cream head; nose is sharper: booze and dark dried fruit like port. Gentle fruitcake (prune & molasses) malts with little hops, dark rum finish and bitter carob linger.  Smoother, drier, less fizzy, creamier, subtler, deeper yet less intricate and darker (if that's even possible) with some age. Any sharpness from fruit is gone in the 3.5 year old bottle, leaving lots of round, artisanal chocolate notes, edging towards a Scotch Ale. Reminds of how laying down Double Bastard knocked all the rough edges off. At the same time, the tartness and hopes in the fresh bottle did serve to keep it from cloying, probably improving drinkability overall.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,rinhaak,4.4,"This is a famous beer, but it deserves the hype. Unlike many German Doppelbocks, this beer is never too sweet and commands a tremendous depth of flavor that is really (and unfortunately) uncommon for the style.  It pours dark red with a full thick head, though the head doesn't last terribly long. The nose is full of cherry, coffee, caramel, dark sugars and a faint metallic aroma.  There are robust roasted coffee, burnt chocolate, and dark caramel flavors that really contribute to the beer's depth. Though there is some fruit present, it is among the least fruity Doppelbocks I've ever tasted. As it sits, freshly baked bread joins the flavors, but the darkness of the roasted malts always remains in the center.  I cannot imagine a Doppelbock with a better mouthfeel. It's not at all syrupy, never too sweet, and with the right amount of carbonation.  This is well balanced beer that you dancing with every sip.

39,131,brewsclues,4.57,"First experience with Ayinger Brewery. The Celebrator Goat trinket is now hanging on our Christmas tree. Excellent.  I haven't had a ton of doppelbocks - maybe 4 or 5? - but this one comes out of the factory lookin' and smellin' great.  A - awesome deep, deep mahogany brown, almost opaque, but when held up to the light it has a nice reddish hue. No haze, perfectly clear. Head retention is outstanding - three fingered tan head to start, and lacing that looks like a skeleton crumbled apart while crawling up my glass.  S - Tons of malts, first off, but there's so much going on here: caramel; raisins, figs, and prunes; a very distinct bready nose with some hints of dark chocolate and coffee. Off the charts good.  T - Big, sweet, malt flavors with plenty of raisins, toasted bread, and deep bitter chocolate finish. I love the caramel taste at the end, but it's not cloying at all. With this many flavors mixing together, it's got a real nice balance. Outstanding.  M - I love the smooth, creamy finish and the mild carbonation. A softer finish that you might imagine, and I like that the coffee/chocolate finish lasts quite a while after the sip. It is a bit sticky, however.  Overall - This is one heck of a beer, one of the best I've had, period. Coming from a hop-head, any lager this interesting, flavorful, intense, smooth, and rewarding as this is worth noting. At first smell, it was hard for me to imagine ever having more than one of these in a sitting, but it's actually quite drinkable for a robust, sweet-ish lager. This is a world-class example of a doppelbock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Agent1,4.45,"According to some, this beer initially set out to harness the beauty and complexity of Trappiste Rochefort's 10. Do I think they achieved this? We shall see...as for now, here's to another taste-testing...or should I say, ""taste test-ator""? Ha!  Appearance - Very dark, almost porter in color. Hardly any brown is visible until you hold this up to the light. The head is quite creamy (beige in color, with light traces of brown). Not much head to this Double Bock, but it retains it well.  Smell - Very nutty. Dark, roasted malts are also some of the first things that come to mind. There is a *very* mild hoppy aroma, although, not much at all. This beer boasts of roasted nuts and sugar, first and foremost.  Taste - A barrage of roasted nut. This seems to be one of its dominant attributes. There is also a strong presence consisting of dark chocolate/ bitter chocolate (most likely from the hops) and even a slight bit of dark cherries and fig. Similar to the Apt 12, I would even go as far as to say there is a 'breadiness' to this beer.  Mouthfeel - A reasonably smooth beer. Doesn't fully hide the alcohol and it definitely stimulates the roof of the mouth more than other areas. Decent mouthfeel.  Overall - There are not too many Double Bocks out there that I tend to frequent time and time again. But this specific brew always leaves me wanting more. A very rich, malty beer that is not for the faint of heart. It is quite bold in its approach and if you happen to like Belgian quads, you may find this beer to be a great way to mix things up. Although quite different and much more 'chocolaty', it has the thick and heavy body of a rich Belgian quad and the darker characteristics of a porter. Overall, this beer is COMPLETELY different from Trappiste Rochefort 10, but a magnificent beer nonetheless!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S - Intense malt and fruit flavors. Noticeable smells of figs, raisins, bread and toffee.  T - Sweet bready flavors - complex mix of fruits and spices. Hints of bitterness after the sweet. Roasted malts also seem to be present. Unique and complex taste. The more I drink the more I discover on the palette.  M - Extremely smooth. Nice carbonation with a syrupy and chewy mouthfeel. Medium to thick bodied. Slightly sweet aftertaste.  O - Ayinger's Celebrator is an awesome beer - simple as that. Its sweet and slightly bitter full of interesting and complex flavors.

It even has a little plastic goat hung on the neck (cute as bock is German for goat). I served it in a tulip-shaped glass (sans goat). The beer is very, very dark mahogany with relatively low carbonation and a head that, although thin, has good retention. It took me a while to get past the nose of this beer as there's a lot there. I get figs, brownies, hazelnut, gingerbread, and leather.  The taste is practically off the charts. A huge malt bomb of flavor greets you. It's extremely well-balanced. Sweet, but not cloying. Crazy complexity. Biscuity, chocolatey, figgy flavors develop to raisins, molasses, and hints of coffee. Every sip seems to bring something different. Nice little hoppy bite at the finish.

Not certain exactly what the scent is that makes a bock a bock, but this beer has it in spades. Flavours range from the sweetness of caramelized malts to black molasses, with all the expected roasted elements and that “bock” essence.

Some slight chocolate notes seem to float around in the aroma. Dark fruits also play a part here. Perhaps raisins or dates.  T – Pretty close to aroma. The first things that hits my palate are the dark breads (similar to dark rye or pumpernickel) and molasses. The flavor becomes roasty and malty as it makes its way to the back of my palate. For some reason I'm not able to pick out any chocolate. The dark fruits seem to be less present in the taste. I do, however, pick up the slightest bit of bitterness as the beer exits.

A big, rich beer that definitely fits the ""liquid bread"" moniker. A damn near perfect example of the style. That being said, it's not my favorite doppelbock but I respect it for its characteristics.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,rand,4.82,"From tap to stein glass  A: Pours dark brown, maybe a shade lighter than black, with a vibrant dark brown head. Little lacing remains under the weight of this viscous brew.  S: Notes of molasses and bready malts up front. A rich bouquet as touch of ripe fruit plays with the chocolate and alcohol notes.  T: Malt forward with flavors of molasses and toffee prominent. Rich, chewy, layered, the ripe fruit in the nose plays a bigger role here. A touch of hop astringincy adds balance, and all of the flavors work in harmony.  M/notes: There's a reason dopplebocks work as meal replacements, and this brew highlights why people can go weeks consuming nothing but this beer. The flavors are delicious, the complexion is satisfying. I try to keep this around as much as possible.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,liamt07,4.35,"330ml bottle from the LCBO, into a tulip. Best before March 2012.  Poured a dark burgundy/brown, almost opaque. Fairly dense dark tan head, a thick collar sticks around with a thin head. Nose has some dark breads, caramel and toasty malts. Taste has some toasted dark bread/cereals, some chocolate, toffee and light grain notes. Loads of malt flavour. No alcohol on the palate but catches up after a couple of bottles. Smooth, sticky and drying body and finish. Opens up and really becomes something else at around room temp. Didn't understand the comparison to liquid bread until I actually got into this. Really warming and essential drinking for the cooler months.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,jmarsh123,4,"Pours a deep brown almost black and opaque. A small tan head dissipates into a wisp after a few seconds.  Aroma is some sweet bready malts maybe a bit of raisin.  Malty bready sweetness assaults the taste buds. Hints of raisins and fig before finishing with a little spicy hoppiness.  Not terribly thick on the mouthfeel so it doesn't get cloying.  I generally don't like more malt forward brews so I doubt I'll go back to this one often, but for the style it is pretty good. I was expecting a bit more complexity, but it's still good.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Dark malts and caramel up front, raisins and dark fruit on the back end with a mild hop presence to balance things out. Lets you get that dark fruit taste without the lingering fruity after taste. Also has some earthy under tones.  Tastes are good and alright but nothing spectacular. I also expect a bit more out of a Doppelbock.

Smell: Roasted bready malts dominate the nose.  Taste: Balanced between roasted malt bitterness and a caramel sweetness. This beer has the distinctive caramel notes of a lager which really define this doppelbock. The best way to describe the flavor is toasted (almost burnt) caramel. Pleasant and an excellent example of the style.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated which makes this beer seem on the dry side with a mildly bitter finish.

This one made a nice tailgate beer a week ago for me at the Giants game!  A dark brown beer with red highlights. Semi-clear. Good sized tan head with strong lacing.  Aroma is richly malty, bready, with traces of dark fruit notes and booze. Nutty, caramel, raisins, fruitcake spiciness.  Taste follows the nose…it’s all in there. Very bready, spicy, and malty, with a subdued sweetness and booziness. Complex. Lots of flavors swirling around. Caramel, biscuits, fruitcake and all the attendant tastes: raisins, prunes, dates, alcohol. Low levels of hop bitterness underneath nevertheless cut through just enough to give it some definition.  Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonation, a touch of sticky chewiness, and a fairly clean finish overall. A truly great doppelbock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Dark brown with ruby accents when held to the light. A half inch of cream-coloured head, nice retention in the form of a thick ring. Some lacing.  Nose is lovely and rich: dark bread, raisin, chocolate, caramel and spice. Very pleasant.  Terrific stuff - rich and malty, with big raisin and spice flavor, a nice rye or pumpernickel bread backing, a bit of coffee, some sweetness and a great nutty character. Finishes surprisingly clean.

Lots of a caramel and toffee malt in the taste, but not overpowering as its balanced with breadiness and just a hint of spice. Wonderful hints of cocoa and roasted malt as well.

Spiciness, faint floral hops, and a hint of black coffee in the finish.  M: Full-bodied, creamy smooth, and wonderfully chewy with slight stickiness while staying far from feeling cloying or syrupy for one moment; it could give an oatmeal stout a run for its money. The finish is incredibly light and clean, just a faint aftertaste of bittersweet roasted malt.

39,131,MONKandTUCK,4.05,"A - Dark as a good Baltic Porter, bordering on very dark brown and black. A free pour leaves a frothy head that takes its time settling.  A - Rich malty aromatics are noticed even before the beer begins to settle in the glass. You can practically see the thick chewy malt rising above the liquid. Chocolate milk and the slightest suggestion of Port accompany classic Continental malts.  T - Creamy and rich, this is equal parts Lager and Chocolate milk. Some dark fruit crystal melt adds complexity, but mostly very rich malt maloidins coat the palate.  Despite a comparably low ABV, this Doppelbock is chewier than most. It has a more restrained flavor profile than most Stouts, Roubust Porters, Baltic Porters and even select Brown Ales, but it's also no challenge to savor. There's a straightforwardness to this that's very appreciable.  M - Creaminess sells this one. Even if bigger and more exciting beers are out there, few have the tautness of this one. Drinking this beer would be pleasurable even if it were void of flavor.  O - Not the best Doppelbock, but head and shoulders above the most regularly available examples. And definitely king of the (too often overly opulent) Winter beers.  Pound-for-Pound Ayinger is as good a German beer as any. Curator is the only D-Bock I've enjoyed more, but that's beer's staggering strength isn't always appropriate. Celebrator is no sissy, it just drinks so easily and is so versatile there's no fault in treating it as your Winter session beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Overall a very bold flavor but it's still smooth.  M: Full bodied with not too much carbonation. Finishes a little on the dry side.  O: Great flavor profile on this - and that's coming from someone who isn't a big raisin fan. Overall it's very well balanced. Would definitely buy again.

A little bit of red port and sugar with strong dark fruits. Absolutely lovely. Very inviting.  T - Dark fruits and sugar. Some more rich maltiness with pumpernickle bread.

Taste is similar to the nose. The bready malt is in focus, ad the grape and raisin as well. Fairly dry, with the brown sugar causing a bit of a syrupy feel. Chocolate.

Dark fruits, baker's chocolate, sweet malts, roasted grains and oak. Nice bitter finish.  Creamy and hearty mouthfeel with a low-medium carbonation. Yeasty sensation on the tongue. Aftertaste is dry with oak and fruit tones. Very drinkable, little trace of alcohol aside from the pleasant warming effect.

Smell - Malts, raisins, prunes, roasted/smoke  Taste & Mouth - The beer has a low amount of carbonation and it feels very creamy on the tongue. There is a lot of dark fruit taste - raisins and prunes and also a molasses/caramel flavour. I can also taste roasted/smoke notes and a bit of a woodiness and a tiny bit of chocolate.

Has since settled to a rather thin and spotty lace with minimal head retention and lacing. Truth be told, this looks an awful lot like a glass of Pepsi.  Sure don't smell like it though! Big nose full of bready malts, molasses, a hint of soy sauce with a touch of smokiness.  Taste is full flavored and malt driven up front. There is some bitterness towards the middle, but it's just enough to add to the overall flavor of the beer. Doesn't get in the way of the malts which are obviously the star of the show. Smooth with a slight smokey finish.  Medium (almost full bodied) ale. A bit chewy with moderate carbonation.  I've had a fair amount of Double Bocks now, and this one tops the list. Only Smooth Hoperator comes close, but this is obviouly the more traditional of the two.  Morey's Bottom Line: I've had this one before, but it had been a while. I won't wait this long again.

Tan head that fades by 1 min with spotty lacing.  Smell: Rich, sweet toffee and raisin. No roasty/smoky aroma but it just smells ""darker"" than Salvator. Can't place them but fruity esters noted along with faint alcohol.  Taste: Smooth, rich, sweet bread and raisin. There is alcohol, but it is modest and plays a supportive role as it fades into a dry, malt, bitter finish with some tannins drying the tongue.  Mouth: Full body with low-moderate carbonation. Thick but not as viscous/oily as Salvator. No astringency.

Recedes down to a tight, thin cap. Spots of lacing here and there down the sides. Dark brown, slightly darker than cola. Hints of light poke through here and there.  Aroma is full of malt with dried fruit and alcohol. Perhaps a little vinous too.  Very malty and sweet. Nutty, chewy malt with dried fruit. Almost like a fruitcake in a bottle. Strong alcohol presence at the end. Not alot of complexity here, just straight ahead malt bomb. A little bit like drinking cough syrup.  Thicky, chewy mouthfeel. Mild carbonation on the palate.  Definitely a sipping beer. It's so thick and chewy that you couldn't drink it fast if you tried. Plus, even if you could pound it back, the alcohol would smack you around shortly after finishing.

Finishes with a near vanilla malt experience. Very nice.  Feel is as nice as the flavor. A velvety easy drinker. A well balanced brew.  I've had this Doppelbock many times. I've tried others, but always come back to Celebrator. It's the gold standard Doppelbock. Readily available, consistent, and awesome every time.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,fsvan,4.52,"Bottle poured into New Belgium globe.  A- Dark copper/maroonish. Very dark. Two and half fingers of light, quickly disappearing head.  S- Tons of malty goodness. Caramel. Dark bread. A good dose of sweetness. Other than a tiny, tiny bit of alcohol, a very clean smell that gets really big as the beer opens up.  T- Again, tons of malts. Some caramel. A hint of chocolate. Sweet bread. A bit of a peppery bite. No real hop presence. Just a wonderful malt bomb, as anticipated.  M- Heavy of medium. This is insanely drinkable. Just sipping it I realized I had drank half of it before typing in the taste component.  O- I like me some doppelbocks, and this guy deserves the hype.

39,131,mttaylor1066,4.5,"Pours as a dark coffee and produces a tan foam that subsides quickly.  The aroma is of dark malts and dark fruits. Just a hint of hops. Delicious and deep.  Taste starts with Munich maltiness and a big hit of coffee follows. There's a tannic backbone to this beer, like a strong red wine. There's an alcoholic ""wash"" on the aftertaste, not unpleasant but not expected. a good beer to drink on a rainy day in Fall.  The mouthfeel is on the heavy side, but not too thick to inhibit an immediate second sip.  Overall, an excellent doppel bock. Not quite as outstanding as the Weihenstephaner Korbinian but enjoyable nonetheless.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

I poured this beer into a fluted glass. On the pour I got a pretty good amount of head. There was around four fingers of the beautiful, tan foam. This came down to scum over time. This didn't yield any real lacing.  Celebrator smells really good. I get coffee and dark fruit from the nose.  The Dopplebock has really good texture. There is medium body and a small amount of carbonation.  The taste is extremely well balanced. You get more coffee, but there is the sweet fruit behind it. The after-taste is minimal. The flavor just departs in balance. I don't know how they do that.  This was a great beer. I love trying another great classic.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,angrybabboon,4.2,"Review adapted from notes taken 5/11/11  Appearance: Very dark brown, with surprising clarity - a nice, tan head that lasts for a while, eventually fades to a great lacing  Smell: Rich, cooked biscuits - slightly roasted, slightly toasted - caramelized malts, some sweetness, molasses - a hint of soy sauce  Taste: Somewhere between a sweet, malty biscuit and roasted bread crust - very malt-forward, as it should be, with caramel malts, roasted malts, and the bread crust flavor I associate with bocks - very clean, hints of molasses and a faint, potentially imaginary touch of soy sauce - very clean, not excessively sweet  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly thin despite the amount of flavor, nicely carbonated, could be smoother  Overall: Obvious why it's a classic  I have to admit that I haven't had many dopplebocks, but this is a great one. It's very malty, full of flavor without being extreme in any way. This reminds me, I need to figure out if there is a reason why each bottle comes with a plastic goat.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ChrisCage,4.72,"A- Pours a chocolaty dark brown color...almost stout like to be exact. The head is simply superb, being caramel in color and initially about 3-4 fingers in thickness...it settles down to a cloud like layer over the liquid. I can't really tell how carbonated this beer is but it appeared to be creamy while pouring. The lacing is the only area that lacks, with some clumpy foam quickly sinking back into the beer. Outside of this, it's a very nice looking beverage, plus there is a goat trinket tied to the bottle....how cool is that!  S- This smells very rich....dark fruits are noticeable...prunes and/or raisins mainly. There is also strong molasses and a hint of brown sugary malt present. The finish is also rich and sweet, being of toffee and caramel.  T- Very nice indeed! Along with some of the aforementioned aromas being tasted (raisin, prune, molasses), there is also hints of cocoa, black cherry, baking spices, black coffee, and roasted grain. There isn't really any bitterness....just perhaps a dollop right at the end of the swallow.  M- Full bodied for sure....it's almost like a meal itself! The carbonation is creamy smooth...even sticky/oily on the palate....the flavors are so well balanced and I don't think anything can compare.  O- What can I say that hasn't already been said about this one....a rich, powerful brew that is warming, but nothing near boozy. Full flavors, full bodied, very nice looking and pleasant smelling, this one has it all! I am sure this set and continues to be the standard for the style and I highly recommend this to anyone who is a beer lover!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,GusDom,4.2,"Good looking beer, poured straight from a 12oz. bottle into a snifter. The beer itself is dark, not pitch black, but pretty close to black. The head is two fingered and mocha in color.  The aroma is of molasses, dark fruit, bitter-sweet chocolate, and caramel.  The taste is pretty on-par with the aroma. You get a slight peppery note as well. The molasses and caramel notes take a front seat, as chocolate and fig ride not too far. Again, the hops dont play a dominant role, but they do exist somewhere in the back. Peppercorns are surprisingly present and add to the complexity of the beer.  This is definately worthy of getting picked up again. Very good double bock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smell: Strong aroma of sweet molasses.  Taste: Again, strong molasses flavor. Some alcohol pushes through tasting a little hot.  Mouthfeel: Not too heavy considering the look, smell, and taste give this away as a meal in a glass. Carbonated and coats the mouth like medicine.  Overall: Definitely tasty, but drinkability isn't high for me. One and I'm done!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,bump8628,4.35,"Deepest brown with a well structured tan head. Heavily malted with fig, toffee, biscuits, caramelized sugar, and raisin all present. Hops take the smallest edge off the maltiness and lend a faint earthy spice. Warming, but not boozy in the least. So much malt packed into less than 7% ABV, something American brewers have yet to master.

S: Dark roasted malts, caramel and a slightly woody smell. Smells sweet with molasses and burnt sugars.  T: Taste is phenomenal. Roasted malts compound with toasty flavors, caramel, molasses, some spice and a slight hint of alcohol. Additionally hints of vanilla.  M: This is one of those rare cases where the flavor and the mouthfeel don't just coexist, but play beautifully off of each other. The mouthfeel is light but creamy and slightly sticky, letting the flavor linger in the back of the throat.  O: Really a great beer. The aroma and flavor are complex, compact and absolutely delicious. Worth a look, worth seeking out.

Strong grainy aroma with molasses, dates, dried fig, tobacco, and some toasty malts.  Strong carmelized sugars and malt dominate the tastebuds. Some aftertaste of coffee.

The smells are of figs, prunes, molasses and tons of malts. Feel is medium to thick, a little creamy. The taste is like it smells, lots of malts, almost too much, no real hop balance, but this is probably right for the style. I get a little banana, some dark fruit and lots of molasses. This is pretty thick and sweet, I'm only just starting to like these malt bombs so I'll have to try this again in a few months (I like it more every time I get it).",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

There might be some skunkiness in there too. The taste was also very sweet and like figs. It had some hops to balance it, but not quite enough, giving it sort of a taste that I associate with the smell of the cat food I used to give my cats. So, I'm not really a fan. But it was an alright, decent beer. I don't usually ever say a beer is overly sweet because I like sweet beers, but sometimes they just are. And this one was. Too sweet, that is.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Sweet and sticky, with cocoa, dulce de leche and biscuity malt flavours. Hops are pulled back big time, but keep this brew from being saccharine.  D: Hides the alcohol and is just bursting with flavour. This is a beer you could drink all night long; alone, with other beers, with a meal, or without.  Overall: Great brew!

The beer pours a very dark brown with hints of dark red. This is so beautiful to admire. I think a rare dark brown is a hard quality to achieve. The tan head is frothy, like rich espresso the oils slowly erode the head. what remains is some light lacing that are like fingers dragging me into this holy elixir.  The aroma's remain strong in this bottle. I have no idea how long this has been on the shelves but it smells like it was just cooked up in a cloistered abby by a jolly red faced monk. I imagine the bald friar's nostrils flaring at the smell of caramel, candied sugar. The sugars resound in a symphony of chocolate, dried fruit, apricots. Is it Christmas in August?  This beer taste like it was cooked by a fireside, chestnuts, spices. The nutty dark roasted malts become a nice banana bread flavor in my mouth. The subtle hints of sourness and bitterness lend a punch to the beer. The beer finishes with a mild cocoa flavor. This is terrific.  The mouthfeel is really good. It taste like beer soup oils and malts fill my stomach and a light alcohol presence warms my head.  I love this beer. I am glad it is so widely available. This is the go to doppelbock. It's also a beer to reflect on. To slowly savour and appreciate the miracle of life and beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

It has a finger and a half head that eventually falls to a decent film leaving behind lacing. Very pretty.  S: Smells like toffee and a toasted English muffin to me. Very sweet smelling.  T: This is like the caramel of beers. It has a caramel like sweetness with a touch of bitterness from the dark malts used. The hops are not detectable to me, but that’s ok, it would throw the flavor off. It ends with a little spice. The aftertaste is too pleasant to eat with this beer.  M: Sticky, thick, high sugar beer. I think this should be drunk on it’s own. It has a creamy like feel in my mouth as well, nice job on the carbonation.

A: After pouring fairly gently, a nice 2 inch tan head grew from the beer eventually settling into about 1/2 inch that never went away. Looked like a nitro-can pour; however, the head was nice and foamy, and stayed around for the entire glass. Beer is a dark brown color, almost opaque. Beautiful. Lacing was amazing, shimmering all down the side of the glass.  S: Toasted malts, sweetness of caramel, maybe toffee? Very pleasant, but I don't like whatever sourness is there. It's not much, and maybe it's the glass I poured it into, but I would have preferred it to not be there...  T: Definitely toasted malts, like the smell. I like this very much. Also, dark fruits, though I am not experienced enough to really pick them out individually. The taste is extremely pleasant, that's all I can say really.  M: Absolutely wonderful. Borders on perfection. Light carbonation, light-medium weight on the tongue. Silky and smooth, I want another already. Finish lasts a while, and tastes great. No need to clean the palette either.  O: One of the best beers I've had. Looks beautiful, tastes wonderful, and finishes perfect. I should buy this more often, and I'm not sure why I don't really.

The look is great, it looks to be black but when held up to the light, you can see that it is a very dark brown color. There is a beautiful tan head that is like Rocky in the ring, refusing to go down. Not a whole lot of lacing but still very pretty.  The smell is a malt bomb in the best way. Huge savory malts, molasses, and brown sugar hit with other notes of dried figs and other assorted accompaniments to a meat and cheese plate, if you get my drift (dark fruits). A large amount of barley was injected into this beer and I love it.  The taste opens up beautifully with a symphony of malts all working well together. A very nice molasses notes with sweet savory fruits that leave a lasting brown sugar taste that just refuses to go away. A super complex malt bill with just a glimpse of the alcohol in a refined savory sweetness in the mid palate. Figs and dates, a nice big black berry lingering taste as well... Just what I'd like in a doppelbock, thank you very much.  Creamy and semi thick, great amount of carbonation. Nice to sip and savor, but also could be drank in large quanities without any burn or carbonation getting in the way. If it was just a hair thicker I'd go 5 for it.  Just an outstanding beer, and another classic European beer that I should buy much, much more often (like Aventinus, Weinstephaner, Rochefort 10, etc.). So happy it's very available.

Big and malty, this succeeds where other doppelbocks fail by being not too sweet for what it is. A strong dark fruit component with malts that are tamed a bit and nice dark fruit and bready components. This actually reminds me of Dr. Pepper a bit, but not as carbonated and obviously not nearly as sweet. Pretty big body with good carbonation, this is a winner.

Nice frothy cappuccino-type head. After several minutes, there's still a formidable amount of head.  Smell: Toasty malt with a gentle sweetness, and some moderate ester tones. Sweet bread, licorice, woodiness, dark berries...very nice!  Taste/Mouthfeel: Beer is light on the tongue, the carbonation keeps it floating. Esters are fairly high, as is the wooden cask flavor (oak? hickory?). As the beer settles into the palate, that very toasty malt comes back with some licorice and possibly blood orange bite. Finishes wet. Tasty.  Overall: I absolutely despise doppelbocks. This is a good beer. That's all that need be said.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,hoptualBrew,4.38,"11.2oz bottle with a celebrator ram figurine hanging off the neck. Pretty cool stuff, love the label work as well.  Deep dark brown, with amber hues when held to light. Opaque for the most part. Nice khaki head falls to a layer up top and mild lacing on the glass.  Nose is nutty toffee caramel malts with a little roastiness & some sweet dark fruits. The nut aroma really stands out though!  Caramelized sugars hit up front & toffee coat the palate. The back end is where the brown nut smack comes through, a bready character & also somewhat of a drying bitterness. Moderately thick in the body (7/10) & carbonated well, thick goes down really well.  Overall, amazing and well balanced dopplebock. Absolutely loved it. Worth the $3 bottle? Yes.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,OakedCanuck,3.6,12oz bottle into cervoise.  A - Pours an opaque brown with reddish edging. Off-white single finger head. Minimal lacing  S - Lots of sweet caramel and toffee. Slight herbal hops on the nose and some figs.  T - Lots of sweet caramel malt along with brown sugar and a bready yeast. Decent accenting pine hops.  M - Thinner than I expected. The sweet malts gave it a certain stickiness and ABV wasn't noticeable.  O - I thought it was going to be a bit heavier for the style. Tasty sweet malts but didn't stand out for me for the style.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Pintofbrown,4.03,"Appearance: Beer grows into a two-finger cap the color of toffee. After a couple of minutes, it has still retained about one finger of head that looks pleasantly creamy.  There is quite a bit of carbonation coming up through the opaque body, some beige highlights when held up to the light. Celebrator is a good looking beer!  Smell: The malts produce a sugary, caramel sweetness. The sweet is accompanied by some sour esters too, reminds one of raisins, apples, and pears. The sourness is not off putting at all, it really invites one to take a few swigs, don’t mind if I do.  Taste: There is a nice balance between the sourness of the hops and the sweetness of the caramel malt. It finishes more on the sweet side with a strong taste of raisins and pears. The finish is very long. It is a little different from what I usually drink, but it is still very good.  Mouth feel: No dryness here, the sweet finish sees to that. The beer is also quite chewy, and finishes smooth, with that distinctive raisin after taste. I don’t know if I’ll ever find a beer that finishes with this flavor profile. I feel like if I drink more of this beer, I’m going to really grow to like it.  Overall: My first doppelbock was certainly a good one. Now I just hope that the more I try I’m not let down because of how amazing this one was. The sweetness of the beer totally hit me by surprise, but it is growing on me easily.  I will definitely pick some of this up again someday, for now I’ll just have to display the bottle with the little ram trinket.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Brewski4Drewski,4.5,"Poured into Tilburg's Dutch Brown Ale glass. A: Pours dark brown and creates large foamy brown head. I can thank the tall glass for the huge head, this beer looks good.  S: Toasted malts not too strong but smeels amazing, maybe some kind of delicious baked cookie.  T: Taste is phenomenal. Like it smells but tastes sweet throughout. Good to the last drop.  M: Smooth in the mouth and on the palate and slightly creamy.  O: This beer is incredibly drinkable, I would like to see how a six pack would do over a nice dinner. A ""world class"" beer, it is overall one of the best of the category. I plan on collecting every ram trinket I get.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A - Pours dark nut brown with a nice one finger tall tan head, dissipating down to a thin film, leaving small wisps of lace down the glass.  S - Smells of rich caramel malt, toffee, chocolate, molasses, dark fruits like raisins and figs, and some light booze. Pretty sweet smelling overall.  T - Starts off with a mix of toffee and sweet caramel malt slowly giving way to hints of chocolate, molasses, dark fruit, and some dark candied sugar. A bit of booze begins to creep in toward the end of the glass.The finish is a mix of dark sweetness and light dryness, lingering for some time.  M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Rich, sweet, feel with plenty of sweetness lingering through the finish.  O - This one is very sweet but it has plenty of flavors going on to keep you interested.

39,131,Rschis16,4.43,"Nearly opaquely black, with ruby highlights and a good sized tan head that reduces down to almost nothing. Retention is lacking. Coffee and dark roasted malts on the nose, softly. Just a touch of German hops that add a slight floral aroma.  Rich and creamy mouthfeel that suits the style perfectly. Not too carbonated, but just enough to complement and even accentuate the Hallertauer hops. Those hops are so perfectly added as a rounding complement to the delicious dark-roasted malts, coffee malts and caramel malts. All three malt flavors combine to bring a very nice caramel coffee style beer, certainly the best I've had of the style. The 6.7% ABV is detectable, but only barely as the hops take hold and wash the booze character away perfectly. The aftertaste is mostly coffee, but not overpowering. Its got a long and pleasant finish.  Overall this is just a really great doppelbock and when I'm in the mood for the style, this is the one I'll be grabbing for.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,magictacosinus,4.62,"Poured into a pilsner glass from a 12oz bottle.  Appearance: A beautiful, brownish color with red hues. Contains a small head that remains for a while.  Smell: The scent of roasted malts are all over the place on this one. Raisins, cherries, dark breaded aromas come to mind. The hops are significantly noticeable, but there is *definitely* an instant alcohol aroma as well.  Taste: A smoky bitter flavor than manages to be quite fruity as well. This definitely has all of the properties of a boozier brown ale: other than the fact that it's bock, it contains the same delectable roasted malts and nuts, and tastes of dried fruits. I've not quite anything like this before! It actually tastes so good that I feel like weeping.  Mouthfeel: Perfection all around here! The malted creaminess and bitterness of the beer provides a wonderful drinking experience. As it's a lager, it feels smoother than most ales, and makes it an excellent pick on a warm or cold day! There's some sweetness and bitterness as it descends the back of the tongue - which is my all-time favorite combo in beers.  Overall: A beautiful, beautiful beer that probably tastes better to me now after finishing a ton of work! It's absolutely wonderful and completely delicious. I wish I could say more about it, but it's too good to keep waiting to be finished as I type here! Highly recommended, a world class recipe right here.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Clear medium brown body with tan head quick dissipation with a fair amount of lacing. Malty nose mostly caramel with some roasted malt. Taste is tres complex, caramel, some burnt brown sugar and a huge dark stone fruit presence, more prunes than raisins balanced by floral hops. Mouthfeel is on the full side of medium, pretty rich, sticky finish. We started the tasting with this and everyone thought this was the gold standard. Not the most drinkable of beers, very filling re meal replacement, but the relatively low ABV for this style adds to the allure of this world classic.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Brown/mahogany color with a 3-finger khaki head.  Aroma is dark malt, molasses, and brown sugar - overall a sticky sweetness.  Taste is smooth and silky, sweet and fruity, with a hint of spice.  Overall this is perhaps the defining version of the style.

Smell: bread-ish with a strong and sweet molasses smell, also some aromas reminiscient of dark cherry. Some spicy notes in the background.  Taste: Opens with roasted flavors; then, a very balanced middle...bitterness equaled by the molasses/roasted malt taste. Ends dry with a dark chocolate and (as it warms) coffee taste. Mellow throughout but interesting and tasty.  Mouthfeel: Mine had pretty low carbonation; medium-bodied with a slick feel.  Overall: Solid brew...No faults. Not a big or intense beer, it was more mellow than I was expecting, but I enjoyed it and will certainly have again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A steady pour into a SA Perfect Pint glass yielded a a good 2+ fingers of creamy smooth offwhite head that stuck around for a good amount of time. Beer was a nice oaken brown color. Smelled of leather, toasted malts, molasses, a bit of sweet dark dried fruit. Seemed almost quad-esque, sans the spicy yeast. Taste was big with the roasted sweet malts, prunes, chocolate, raisin with a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel was full & creamy, with a high amount of carbonation. Overall a very tasty beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Moon2Goddess,4.5,"Color: Rich amber, similar to a cola, quite dark, but allows light to penetrate. Demonstrates nice red tones in bright light.  Head: Hesitant development, chunks up like a rootbeer float. Beautiful caramel color, lively, bubbly, height fairly low, slides down the glass and eventually dissipates. A top layer lingers through the entire drink.  Aroma: Maple syryp, peanuts, pecans, biscotti and muted hints of licorice, cherries amalgamate into the scent of a classic malted german beer. Aspects remind me of Indian spices found in tikka masala- an aroma that makes it impossible to walk past Bombay Bistro without pausing; likewise you stop often during the experience to smell the rim of the bottle. This is my best attempt, but Celebrator has a singularly unique scent that I cannot find words to describe or a simile with which to accurately capture it.  Texture: Medium body, ultra smooth.  Flavor & Balance: Tastes precisely how it smells. Conspicuous malt flavoring, maple, milk chocolate and nuts remind you of eating a nut goodie bar without the sickening sweetness. Acquires nice fruit tones like the skin on a bing cherry. All the while, never forgets it's origin, and maintains the identity of a beer. 100% pleasant through and through, a very easy drink, I can have one while I am cooking and another with my meal, although I would never only have it with food and forego the complete flavor experience. Great sipping beer.  Sustained Taste: Progressively smoother, taking on more licorice, chocolate and bing cherry characteristics over time, without losing it's maple brown sugar goodness. A craver...every few months you will have a craving for a celebrator (one would be shocked at how many goat pendents I have!)",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Lolli1315,4.85,"A- Dark brown in color with a thin, creamy tan head. Not much can be seen through because of the color, but when held up to light its clearness becomes more noticeable.  S- Lots of toasted malt attacks the nose, most likely vienna or munich malt. Bready character becomes more prominent in the middle. Some light caramel rounds it out.  T- Rich, malty character is the defining attribute in the beer. Toasted malt accompanies the sweet malt as well. Some caramel and light hints of chocolate touch the flavor profile as well. Small hop bitterness lingers into the finish.  M- Medium full body with smooth carbonation. Sweet start and finish.  O- Though I already had a review of this beer, but nevertheless I still love it.

39,131,zimm421,4.41,"Poured into a pilsner glass from a 11.2 oz bottle. Appears a dark brown color with very little transparency. Has a fluffy brown head about two fingers thick that has great staying power and doesn't really ever completely dissipate.  The nose is sweet and full of maltiness. Lots of molasses and caramel, a slight amount of fruitiness. Aroma doesn't knock your socks off but definitely draws you in for another sip. The taste starts out sweet with the caramel, molasses and dark fruit flavors. Finishes slightly bitter, but is very well balanced. Very complex flavors here, tough to pick out the different notes.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation sting with each sip. Overall, this is a great brew. The complexity makes it very interesting, the flavors fit together very well and it is pretty drinkable for the complexity.

This brew poured up a hefty dark mahogany-colored body with a thick one-fingered tan colored with retention lasting long after the beer was gone and amazing lacing effects. Aromas of warm dark bread, caramel, molasses, malts and hops, and a very slight hint of alcohol. Of the doppelbocks, I am sure that this one reigns supreme!

Plumbs, raisins, and grapes are the first aroma that hits me on this guy. A little bit of toast from the malt. A hint of dry chocolate in the aroma. A lot going on on the pallet here. Slightly bready with that big dark fruit flavor that the aroma indicated. However this is a big malty monster.  The body here is somewhat full with good carbonation. Overall this is a malt bomb. Maybe not the best choice for a 90+ degree night but I'm enjoying the heck out of it anyhow. Malt heads, you'll love this (if you don't already)",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The smell of the beer was of rich caramel notes with some strong malt aromas. The smell is a little warming and inviting. The taste of the beer was had many of the elements that were on the nose, it was sweet upfront which faded into a nice caramel bitterness in the end.

Smells like sweet, thick, rich malts with a hint of chocolate. Some hints of dark fruits as well.  Wow, that is one delicious doppelbock. Everything from the aroma is present in the taste, but instead of different parts shining through at different times, the flavors mingle together and complement each other perfectly. You get sweet, rich malt with chocolate, fruits, and brown sugar, and a lingering roasty almost sweetened coffee like taste. The hops are not prominent in this beer by far, but you can tell they are in the background only complementing the malt profile.  The mouthfeel is right on too. Not too much carbonation. Its got a nice viscosity to it that kind of reminds me of chocolate milk. The lingering roastiness I mentioned earlier sticks to sides of your mouth for awhile. Pretty drinkable.

Flavor is very smooth and robust. Thick fig-like malt flavors, some raisin, caramel/burnt sugar--but not sweet. Finish is smooth and a bit creamy. Very little alcohol. A lot going on for how crazy smooth this is.  Medium-heavy mouthfeel seems appropriate for the robustness of this beer. Not like a stout or anything, but it sure isn't crisp.  This is a great beer that tastes delicious and is incredibly easy to drink for how robust it is.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,marcellaproust,4.42,"Great suggestion from a trusty bartender. The Celebrator pours a fluffy, coarse head which fades to thin lace. Great exemplar of the style, as its full bodied but light on the finish--no syrupy or winey over-production here. Color is a translucent chestnut-red brown. Nose is burnt toast. Mouthfeel is silky. Tastes like toasted oak (by which I mean the flavor that you get from over-oaked California chardonnays, but in the Celebrator a good thing). So, vanilla, burnt sugar/glaze, and . . . I'm serious, Kraft's dark milk-maid caramels (but without the sweetness). Finish is long and dries, reminding you that this is a beer.

39,131,zac16125,4.25,"330ml bottle with no freshness date or other bottle numbers  A: Pours out very dark, and initially appears an opaque black until held up to a light when a reddish hue comes out and a small amount of light shines through. A massive 2.5 fingers width of khaki colored head that dissipates down at a moderate rate to leave just an outer ring. Leaves a small amount of lacing.  S: Lots of dark fruit aromas, fig and plum, and roasted malt. There is a significant smokey aroma as well.  T: The balance of dark fruit (fig again), and roasted malts is in the taste as well. There is also a hint of caramel malt sweetness in there, and a subtle bitterness on the back end of some sips. One thing I really like about the taste is it has a surprising and unique berry sweetness in the aftertaste. Very good flavors, similar to the aroma, but the flavors as a whole are not as strong and are more subdued, and in that sense it doesn’t quite live up to the nose.  M/D: Smooth, yet sticky mouthfeel. Medium bodied with heavier carbonation that I expected from the appearance, but not quite to a negative degree. Goes down fast and is real easy to drink.  O: Overall a very good offering. This is not my favorite style of beer, but this one was damn good and I enjoyed it more than I expected. Certainly a beer I wouldn’t mind trying again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Tan, 3 finger head that recedes to a small ring and leaves behind some nice lacing.  Malty sweetness dominate in the aromas, getting mostly dark fruit(raisins, prunes). Some licorice spiciness along with a definate molasses secondary aroma. Slight bready notes as well. A very nicely balanced, overall great smell.  Taste is very similar to the smell, only abit more distinguished. Everything listed above seems to stand out more with the taste. Some added coffee bitterness. Has a nice alcohol bite without being too overpowering. Again, great balance.  Medium body, medium carbonation. A very smooth, super drinkable beer.  Not overly familiar with this style as there aren't a ton of good ones in my area, but really loving it after trying this one.

Quite a nice amount of caramel, toffee and light coffee. Finally, lightly vinous with raisins, figs and dates. Amazingly complex and balanced.  T: Follows the nose quite well. Except the burnt characteristics are quite stronger with the strong molasses, leather, oak, toffee and light coffee. Still quite sweet with a good amount of caramel and vanilla with light touch of cinnamon. Still just as fruity with the raisins, dates and figs.

Color is beautiful, almost black and seems opaque until held up to a light where it turns into a deep garnet that barely allows light to seep through.  Aroma is bready malt with a very muted fruitiness that becomes very pruny as the glass warms. No Hops detected at all.  Moutheel is slippery, almost buttery.  Taste: Mein Gott in Himmel! Where do I begin? The overall impression I get is a burnt malt smokiness followed by a syrupy sweetness full of prunes and dates and figs. This is a lager? With it's fruity, maltiness, it's seems more like a Porter or a Tripel.  This is definitely a warmer, a way to pass the evening when snow is still on the ground and the baseball season is a ways away,  It's amazing that when I review a beer it disappears so quickly as I try to analyze it's taste. I am sad as I only bought a single 12 oz. bottle.

I will need to have a bad beer in this style to better weight my ratings. I know now that this style isn't for me. To sweet for me.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

This beer is dark, nearly no light gets through this deep, dark, amber-brown liquid. It's a sight to behold.  S: The smell is my favorite part: Dark fruit, rasins, some woody-nuttiness. YUM. Taste: You get that dark fruit and raisons, a sweetness with a little bit of alcohol and a lingering coffee in the finish.  O: What a delightful beer. I would definitely get another for a special occasion, definitly a celebration in a glass!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,FosterJM,4.43,"564th Review on BA Bottle to Pils glass 11.2 oz  Thanks to my comadre for the gift!  App- As dark as some stouts I've seen but with more highlights running through. A giant 3 finger head that was fast to recede and leaves no cling but a film of head.  Smell- Spices mingle with malts that take on a dark cherry tinge and then follow up some roast notes. It's good and it's inviting.  Taste- One of my all time favorite tasting beers. One of the first craft imports I had and I was hooked. The dark cherry with spice remains and mingles with the lower but present ABV. Malts also remain with some roasted nuts.  Mouth- Medium bodied with a medium carbonation level. Not as thick as I remember but tasty cherry flavors remain.  Drink- So flavorful but retains a small quality. Balanced, flavorful, not a palate wrecker or tries to be what it's not. I'll come back to this beer a lot. One of the best",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Pours a deep dark brown, with faint reddish highlights and a 2 finger beige head that turns to a nice bubbly lace and stays with the the beer the whole way down. Smells of roasted coffee beans , bitter sweet chocolates, sour apples and grapes, and pear juice. Sweet chocolates and fruits are sandwiched in between a big mouthfull of bready malts and a smooth coffee/coca bean finish, awesome. Slight friendly alcohol presence can also be found towards the end of a sip. Creamy velvety smooth on the feel with a nice big body. Extremely enjoyable, delicious.

It's darker than Coke, so no light gets through, which I thought was cool. Very thick, but not syrupy. Very good, but not elite.  Smell: Also not great at first, but awesome as it warmed. Very sweet, mostly like caramel. Heavily malted and smoky, but not really roasted, something that I've noticed in other reviews. Great complexity.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Basically a whole lot of smoky sugar with a slight hop bitterness in the finish...VERY slight. This is basically a Cinnabon in a beer. Medicinal warming mouthfeel.

A - Pours a deep molasses brown (looks nearly as thick!) Yields a finger of light tan head that is extremely creamy and rich-looking. When held up to the light it has some light brown and amber highlights.  S - Strong hints of brown sugar, molasses, cocoa nibs and toasted grains.  T - Rich and sweet up front. Lots of molasses and dark chocolate character. Incredibly creamy and smooth. A slight bourbony booziness is present along with some bitterness from the hops and dark malt. This beer is good, but almost overkill on the sweet factor for me (but that is just the nature of the doppelbock style)  M - As noted earlier, creamy smooth texture with mild carbonation.

39,131,lnashsig,4.88,"Many thanks to Beenitty for the chance to try this! I have actually never had it before, and haven't had much exposure to this beer style at all.  Poured into my DFH snifter, pours a pitch black, completely opaque color. Off white/beige head fills the top of the glass then slowly recedes, leaving a crackly 1 finger worth of cloud-like head that never dissipates. Smell- Molasses, tea leaves, faint bourbon, bready malt. Taste- molasses first to the back of the throat. A roasty faint coffee flavor next. Oh wow. So much going on here, very hard to describe the complexity of this brew. There is a definite appearance of a bourbon flavor here, but it is offset by the roasty bitterness. I'm shocked. Why the hell haven't I been drinking dobblebocks all along? This is an amazing brew. I now forgive the Germans for their short-sighted Reinheitsgebot laws. Mouthfeel- this is perfection. Drinkability- for 6.7%, there is no alcohol feeling here. This is just amazing.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Have had this bock around 4 times in the past year (both bottle & on-tap from Lukas Liquor) and now getting the chance to review it. Poured from the Un-Dated Bottle into my New Belgium Wide Mouthed Snifter.  Appearance- Has a darkest brown/red body you can get to in description with a 1 finger, off white head that keeps bubbles at the top for a while. Nice carbonation!  Smell- Very dark, caramel, and dark chocolate notes with a raisin finish. Has tons of malt and stout like characteristics.  Taste- Has massive taste of raisin/plum with a hint of chocolate. Light on the hops but the bitterness is perfect! Nice fruit background (not sure what kind) and then has a sweet finish (not so bitter). Have to have it yourself to understand!  Mouthfeel- Full Bodied, Medium carbonation, Sticky at the end, and leaves burnt caramel taste on the palate!  Overall- Are you kidding me? This is my 5th time coming back to this beer!

T- Real deep, complex flavors of caramel and hops. I was pleasantly surprised. M- Very creamy and smooth. You get a little smokiness through your nose going down.  Overall- This was a fantastic beer.

A: The darkest doppel I've ever seen: Almost pitch black, with a massive two finger head, that left a slight trail of dried bubbles up and down the glass as the brew was siphoned.  S: Beet sugar, plums, caramel, and maybe a tinge of nuttiness. None of this was particularly strong and no flavor dominated. Homogeny at work!  T: A model for the style: Not too rich or sugary. However, the chocolate notes were prominent and the caramel wasn't far behind. Malted milk ball, with dark fruit in the mix, and a very smooth finish. Love it!  M: Creamy as hell, not sugary in the least, low carbonation, and low-moderate lacing.  O: I'm not a huge fan of this style, but this one is the exception.

Fairly clean with a touch of grape skins in the finish. Perhaps some prune juice as well?  M: Medium mouthfeel, clean with medium carbonation.  Just amazing, a perfect combo of flavors and aromas.

Looks lovely and fresh since no sediment.  S - Smells of brown sugars, toffee and caramel with just a mild bite of alcohol. Smells a bit maple like I guess.  T - Smooth with a nice bit of roast that rounds to candied sugars and sweetness does have a touch of maple too it. Slight chocolate as well and finishes clean with no bitter roast, hops, or even ABV burn. Man what a good beer.

The color was a very rich, dark reddish brown, that when poured into a tulip glass cascaded back into itself for about 30 seconds as the head built to a good 2"", that lasted until you licked it off the edge of the glass.The head was a dark amber with small bubbles. After the cascading ceased it was a very clear pour. WOW Taste was lightly sweat and bitter at mthe same time, remarkable!

39,131,StoutHunter,4.5,"I got a bottle of Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock for $3.49 at The Lager Mill. I been trying a lot of different Doppelbocks lately so when I saw one of most highly regarded Doppelbocks on the singles shelf I figured I better try it to see how it stacks up to the other Doppelbocks I have had and if it lives up to all the hype. No visible bottling date. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a imperial pint glass.  A- I like the label and packaging of this beer, it looks cool and is well done, the little white goat thing was cool too. I still don't get whats up with Doppelbocks being associated with goats, somebody needs to school me as to why this is. It poured a deep dark ruby red color bordering on being brown, the ruby red really sticks out much more when held up to the light. A slightly rough pour resulted in four fingers worth of light tan colored head that died down to a thick layer that left some nice lacing.  S- I pick up aromas of lightly roasted malts that impart some nice sweet dark chocolate and coffee aromas that are subtle but nice. The main player in the aroma is the dark fruits which stick out a lot, mainly plums, figs, and red grapes along with some brown bread aromas. Smells good and what I would expect from a good Doppelbock.  T- The malts impart some nice light roasted flavors that I picked up in the aroma along with some caramel that I didn't get in the aroma. The brown bread is a little more prevalent then it was in the aroma and blend nicely with the malts. Like most Doppelbocks I have encountered the aroma is far sweeter then the flavor. Just like in the aroma the dark fruits dominate, I like that, lots of figs, prunes, dates, red grapes, and little bit of raisins. Very well balanced, nothing overpowers one another and the alcohol is hidden nicely.  M- Medium full bodied, slightly chewy, smooth and it had the right amount of carbonation.  Overall this was a pretty damn good Doppelbock, one of the best I have had, to me it is slightly better then Bell's and Weihenstephaner's Doppelbocks. The key to this brew was balance and complexity, there were a lot of different things going on with the flavor and somehow they all came together nicely. This beer seems like it would go good with some nice BBQ are any other hearty dinner, it has good drinkability. Everything about this brew was on par for it's style and I really liked the dark fruit aspect of this beer, it was a nice mixture of dark fruits and was done better then any other Doppelbock I have had. This beer would do a fine job at representing it's style in my fridge, it may share some room with Bell's, but since this is available year round I see more of this brew to come in my future. If you like this style then you have to try this beer, it is a perfect example of it's style and certainly lives up to the hype.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

M: Creamy and smooth medium body with some carbonation.  O: Decent beer, don't love it and don't hate it. Looks and feels good but I don't really enjoy the smell much.

S: Sweet, roasted malts, cloves and a little bit of bubble gum.  T: Very mellow sweet malt up front, with a bit of fruit and bubble gum. Followed quickly by coffee, somewhat stout-like finish with a little smoke and chocolate. There is also a metal quality in there that is hurting the overall impression and keeping it from being a 5. But the rest is zo good that it's smoothing over this flaw to an extent. About half way through the glass, the metal seems to disappear.  M: Medium-heavy, smooth, a bit oily. Menthol feeling (more feeling than flavor) builds through the glass.  O: A very nice brew. Really wish the metal wasn't there, would be outstanding without that.

39,131,output01x,4.72,"Poured from a 330 mL. bottle (no date) into a snifter glass.  A strong pour yields a 1/2 finger tan-colored creamy head that quickly recedes to slight dusting and a thin ring of foam around the edge. The body is near black with no traces of color even when held to light. Lacing is not thick, but definitely there.  Aromas of roasted malt, milk chocolate, coffee beans, and hazelnut. Bold and delicious, the nose makes you want to taste this beer.  Dark malt with notes of rye bread and toasted nuts. Dark, robust, and complex, the flavors are interesting and more than satisfying. A slightly bitter roasted coffee aftertaste finishes each sip perfectly.  Full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is thick but not syrupy in the least. It coats your mouth well, but only enough to allow the flavors to stick around for the preferred amount of time.  I could drink Celebrator for breakfast, enjoy it with a chicken club sandwich for lunch, pair it with BBQ spare ribs for dinner, or sip on it as a midnight snack. And by ""could"", I really mean ""have and will glady do so again"". There is a reason why Celebrator is widely considered one of the best beers in the world.

The flavors are comparably excellent. Toasted grains abound; at times nearing the point of burnt but never crossing that threshold. Dark bread, too; calls to mind pumpernickel. Earthy hops and something of a light, dry spice. The finish is surprisingly dry with toasty bread notes.  Reasonably full bodied. Aside from the inherit graininess there is a smooth, languid feel. To the effect carbonation is low. Even grainier as time wears on. Still surprised at how dry it is.  Celabrator is an excellent beer; certainly top-notch in style. I can't believe I have never had it before. I'll be looking forward to the next time I drink it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,biegaman,4.97,"Ayinger Celebrator's dark tone and steadfast opacity give it the intimidating appearance of a guard dog, or maybe one of those angry, long-horned rams on its label in mating season. This is slightly ironic considering how its violet and ruby highlights are gorgeous and inviting. Its head, while thin, looks harder than marble stone (and is coloured like it too).  It smells like someone took the world's finest tawny port and improved it exponentially. The sweet, fruity notes of plum and grape are gracefully tempered, somewhat offset by a tremendously rich maltiness. This 'toast and jam' combination would make a memorable breakfast; even the best noses are bound to miss a feature or two. It's that layered.  I don't think you could find a better, more exemplary tasting doppelbock than Celebrator. The poised sweetness of a fig and prune compote is mushed into the taste of heavily browned bread crusts, which turn into a sooty, moderately bitter dark chocolate note on the finish. If ever a beer deserved a perfect score for flavour, truly, Celebrator is it.  There's rich - and then there's Bill Gates rich. This doppelbock is Bill Gates rich. Profound, full-bodied, uncompromising maltiness becomes heavily intimate with all parts of the palate, and refuses to go away even in the aftertaste. To suggest caramel is grossly overstating the quantity of sweetness, and downplaying the rich, luscious quality of it.  If you want to learn about German brewing, throw out the books and just stock up on Celebrator. Few examples pack as much punch per square sip or capture so elegantly the style's rich, nectarous qualities. Although the expression is used quite commonly, few things are actually ""mouth-watering"" - this is. Trust me, I feel myself drooling.  Brewers will make a lot of claims about the superiority of their beer on labels. Typically, these should be taken with a heaping tablespoon of salt. However, for Ayinger to call Celebrator ""the finest double bock beer"" is no exaggeration. It is unequivocally, undeniably the golden standard of the style; any attempts to replicate it or even to honor it only serve to advertise that fact and endorse the superiority of its brand.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,schlimenhaumer,4.47,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass at low altitude.  A: Pours a very very dark ruby color with a one-finger dark cream-colored head. Lacing could have been a bit better.  S: Caramel and malty bread notes come through quite strongly, with a bit of yeast at the end.  T: Primarily caramel up front moving into the malty bread flavors you'd expect from a dopplebock. There are some pleasant notes of bitterness toward the end, and I enjoyed the alcoholic notes on the finish.  M: Generally wet and creamy with some carbonation to tingle your tongue. Very nice.  D: This is a really filling brew, so it might better serve as dessert than something you drink all night.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BarryMFBurton,4.88,"When I bought this, the cashier at the liquor store told me this was “the world’s best dopplebock.” I love a good dark beer, so I had to try it out.  A: Pours dark and sultry. Very thin brown head that dissipates rather quickly. Looks like a deep, reddish-brown coffee after a few minutes. Has a thick and dark presence that instantly commands your presence.  S: Sweet chocolate and coffee pound the senses. Some surprising fruitiness, too. Smells very potent.  T: Wow. Wow, wow, wow. There's a lot going on here. Smoky coffee and dark, dark chocolate do a lot to expand the palate up front. Then, there’s a pine/minty kick that tickles the taste buds even more. It’s strong, and you can definitely taste it – the alcohol is as smooth as it is present. There’s some tropical fruit notes as well – mango, melon, and a hint of something sweeter, like pineapple. It’s an incredible mix of flavors, and well blended to boot. This is the most well-balanced beer I’ve ever had.  M: I had a feeling this would be a bit syrupy, but, on the contrary, it’s rather light on the tongue. Perfectly sippable.  O: Whenever someone tells me a product is “the best of its kind,” I am rightfully skeptical. But this is, without a doubt, is the best in the world. A true work of art. Gute Arbeit, Deutschland!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,mattkoon,4.27,this is a great beer. The smell is creamy vanilla. The chocolate barley really comes through in the taste very flavorfull yet smooth. This is a damn good beer. I was shocked at the drinkability. There is almost a molassis flavor that goes well with the rich dark hocolate flavor.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,jamescain,4.42,"Poured into a mug  Appearance: Dark brown, not opaque, when held up to the light you can see the light shining through with red highlights. One fingers worth of tan head tops it off.  Aroma: More reminiscent of a dark Belgian ale than a German beer. Aromas of dark fruit, figs, plums, sweet caramel malt dominate. Very complex.  Taste: Similar to the aroma, dark fruit dominates, but with a molasses backdrop and a hit of spiciness.  Mouthfeel: Thick and chewy are the only words to describe this mouth feel. It is thicker than most of the doppelbocks I have had in the past.  Overall: Considered by most to be the quintessential doppelbock and it lives up to its reputation.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,STKPICR0720,4.67,"This beer pours dark and by dark I mean like outbacks rye bread. This beer has so many different things gooing on in it you can't help but enjoy the conversation this beer tends to bring on. I have had plenty of dark german beers but I have to say this one is up there.  The taste is of a nutty, caramel almost roasted hoppy bitter taste. There really is not a bad part of this beer from the moment it is opened.  Find a four pack and enjoy with friends.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,notchucknorris,4.3,"A: Very dark brown color, almost like a dark maple syrup. A pretty sizable mocha-colored head rises up and takes a while to settle.  S: A lot going on here. Freshly baked rye bread, raisin, roasted malt and some nuttiness.  T: Rich and bready with a lot of malt sweetness. Molasses, a hint of smoke and a touch of hops and a bit of spiciness in there as well. Really nice.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,zeledonia,4.7,"Pours a very dark brown, with ruby at the edges when held to light. Quite clear despite the dark color, though very little light actually makes it through. The medium-tan head is fluffy and leaves great lacing.  Smell is all delicious rich caramel malts. Figs, chocolate, and root beer. And of course the characteristic bready yeast smell. The layers of complexity are amazing.  Once again, I get rich, sweet, bready, fruity malty goodness. Dark fruits like figs and a hint of cherries. A touch of tangy spice comes in late to give some more variety.  Thick and heavy, chewy, with just enough carbonation to balance out all that weight. Also has a creamy smoothness. Definitely on the thick side compared to most other doppelbocks.  This is simply an outstanding beer, all around. I could imagine the taste being a bit deeper or more complex, but I've certainly never encountered such a beer. Simply the best doppelbock I've had, bar none.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,B967ierhunter177,4.78,"Wow! This beer pours a clear, dark brown with ruby tones showing in the light. The aroma begins with chocolate and has hints of nuts and toast. The flavor is extremely well balanced with chocolate, raisin, and nutty notes with a bit of maple in the finish. It has a medium mouthfeel and is quite drinkable. Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock is an excellent example of the style, outstanding. Highly recommended!!!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,SSJPhatMatt,4.85,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a tumbler.  Appearance: Pretty hue of dark maroon, almost purple, with a perfectly-proportioned tan, foamy head. The head sticks around until the bitter end and leaves some lacing on the glass.  Smell: Many of the same scents I get in a dark Trappist ale I get here: raisin, fruitcake, rum, and a bit of cough medicine.  Taste: Perhaps I should just ""copy and paste"" my tasting notes of certain Belgian Trappist beers since Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock seems to have many of the same flavors. As we noted in the aroma, dark fruits and confectionary flavors are strong here. Fruitcake, rum, raisin, and toffee syrup are all prominent from start to finish. It's a rich, sweet beer to be sure, but it's never cloying or sticky. It finishes with a subtle, semi-sweet chocolate aftertaste to impart some bitterness and let you know it's still a beer.  Mouthfeel: The first thing I noticed about this beer even before the flavor was just how soft and gentle it was in the mouth. This is like getting a hug from a teddy bear.  Drinkability: There's no carbonation sensation, nor is the beer obese - it's perfectly medium-bodied. Not a refreshing beer, obviously, so it's not quite in league of a summer seasonal (bear in mind this beer IS a lager, not an ale). It's so darn soft and tasty that it's difficult not to drink it as fast as possible.  Overall, this is a pretty amazing beer I wasn't expecting to like nearly as much as I did. I think most beer drinkers will be pleasantly surprised by it as well.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Poured a 12oz bottle into a snifter glass to find a deep dark brown color, with a white creamy one inch head.  The aroma had a lot going on with dried fruits, malts and caramel.  The taste was just excellent, you pick up everything from the aroma and then some. There are also hints of raisins, coffee, plum, rum and caramel.  This was a great beer to drink. Not too heavy and not light, also a great balance between the alcohol and carbination.  Overall an outstanding brew, I don't drink doppelbocks too often but I will definatly pick this up more often.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Spider889,4.67,"Live review from the bottle.  Poured into my Troegenator Double Bock dimpled stein.  It takes a rough pour to produce a head of merit, but when done properly this beer relinquishes a head upwards of 3+ fingers. The beer has excellent clarity. Appears nearly black at a distance, but held to light you can see that the beer is a ruddy garnet color. Lace is intermittent and not as dependable as some doppelbocks.  The smell really blows you away. Rich and complex, you really begin to understand all of the praise that Celebrator gets once you savor the aroma of it.  Very sweet smelling malt begins things, providing notes of caramel and toffee. Lots of tobacco and coffee aromas are present as well. The essence of freshly baked wheat bread is the finisher, and truly something to celebrate. How long until Oktoberfest?  The flavor is another wonderful quality of this brew. I personally found it almost too sweet at times, but I can't complain about anything else. The flavor is composed of dark bread crust, roasted barley and wheat, and sweet chocolate covered espresso beans. Some fruity properties emerge in short order as well - mainly dark raisin or prune, very sweet.  Full bodied, almost chewy at times, Celebrator is fulfilling and superbly drinkable. I found the carbonation a tad high in the bottle, though. The lingering mouthfeel is very sticky, with coffee providing a very long-lasting aftertaste.  I couldn't hold onto my 4pack of this for longer than a week. Honestly, I could happily drink a 4pack in one sitting. I really wish this were more widely available year-round and cheaper, as I'd always have some on hand.  Notes: My wife loves the little goat hanging off each bottle.  This is a style the monks would brew to truly be a 'meal in a glass.' I would eagerly replace part or all of some meals with this beer. Daily.  I did a side by side of this and Great Lakes The Doppelrock on draft at Winking Lizard a week ago. Here are some thoughts:  Doppelrock certainly isn't as complex as Celebrator, but side by side they are fairly similar. Doppelrock was less cloyingly sweet than Celebrator, and it was also very creamy and smooth - a quality that seems especially suited to this style.  I really liked both beers, and after doing the side by side I think the Great Lakes version deserves a little more credit than it gets. That said, Celebrator is much better in the bottle than on draft imo, and it is ultimately the better beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Jemonster,4.17,"A: Deep red brown and opaque. The head is tan and half a finger wide after about one minute of settling. The carbonation appears to be pretty light.  S: Rich brown sugar right away. Nice and fragrant. I can smell some hops and malty character.  T: Maple syrup/molasses sweetness is the first note. Some nice bitter coffee hops in the back. Dark chocolate and wheat remind me of smores. Some alcohol is present.  M: Pretty thick and rich. Not much carbonation to balance it out.  O: Pretty great!

The beer also finishes with some coffee flavors. Pretty solid.  M: Full body with perfect carbonation.

The initial taste has a large amount of molasses flavored sweetness with some of the fig and dates notes. Some of the grape flavors linger around like wine esters.

The scents are incredibly sweet and malty, reminiscent of molasses, preserved fruits, and dark pumpernickel. I cannot detect any alcoholic or hoppy notes.  The taste is just as sweet as the nose would suggest. This brew is thick and delicious, but the sweetness is nicely balanced by a grainy characteristic.

Fresh, malty scent, mixed in with dark fruits, inviting, not overly sweet.  Man, what a nice surprise! Great flavor. I've had Shiner Bock all my life...this beer makes Shiner taste like mop-water, which it kind of does regardless, but still, what a great taste. Great mix of dark fruits and sweet malt. Who knew there was more out there than a good IPA or DIPA.  Probably one of the most drinkable beers i've had in a while. The second i put it down, I'm ready for my next sip.

I am also getting some distinct molasses and some very faint roasted or smoked notes.  T: Similar to the smell, the molasses and sweet malt predominate! Also some light coffee notes. A lingering residual sweetness. I love this!  M: Medium/heavy body...definitely Creamy & smooth as silk going down.  D: I could drink this all day. This is quite worthy of being among the highest rated beers, of its style, in the world! Amazing flavor for a lager beer. Cracks my personal top 15 list for sure...which means I'll always have this on hand in my fridge! An A+ ranking from me.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Deep, deep ruby brown color with an off white head.  Its hard to say if the goats mounting the beer on the label add or detract from the experience, but after the first sip the goats were determined to be irrelevant. The roast, the mild hops, the toasted bread notes, all are incredibly well balance and work in unison to create a truly unique and ideal doppelbock experience.  This is the best german beer i've had period. I plan on buying a few 4 packs of this because i am seriously impressed. Great drinkablity and at 6.7 abv one should check himself before he wrecks himself on this bock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

While the aroma is wonderful full of pumpernickel bread, chocolate and citrus, and a slight herb nature to it. All that comes out in the taste with chocolate so incredibly pronounced.

S: Has a great aroma of chocolate, coffee, and a strong molasses sent. It is not to overpowering though great balance.  T: Molasses is the first flavor, then it almost has a chocolate flavor to it, along with a nice malt and hops taste to it. It has a awesome sweetness to it but definitely not too much, just enough to make it flavorful, along with a little bitterness, but not at the finish. Good carbonation, the alcohol is just right. German brewing at its finest.  M: Very creamy, so damn good! Just an awesome feel to it.  D: Infinity on the Drinkability, I would get drunk on this not because I wanted to get drunk, but because it's so damn good. Highly recommend it, best Doppelbock out there.

Body is smooth with a pleasant drying finish. Dusty cocoa, roasted barley, nuts, fruit bread, molasses, caramel fill out the body which is not nearly as thick or sticky as some in the category, relying more on the smooth dryness. Hides the ABV well but could be a little heftier without harming the beer.

In order of perceived prominance: Toffee, raisen, dark bread, mollasses, coffee, smoke, vanilla. In summary, complex. Only complaint is that starts so complex and finishes a bit thin.

Chewy, with flavors of molasses, toasted dark bread, dried figs and plums. A warm alcohol sensation as it goes down and a dark brown sugar finish.  D - Incredibly complex flavors.

S: Baked bread and dark chocolate. A little oak tone in there, too methinks.  T: Hearty malt flavor, dark chocolate, nutmeg, coriander, and licorice.  M: Thick, heavy, and robust. Sublime combination of grain and chocolate, is amazingly well done. Grain, sweet, and a just a little dry in the finish. Strong alcohol flavor is not present despite relatively high alcohol content.  D: Only problem here is you want to slowly savor this quality, but it goes so easily it will be gone before you're ready. Oh, well....  Atmosphere is great here.

Out of a list of about 60 some beers, she picks this one. I could have kissed her for that! I love this beer. I would have never picked it because somewhere in the back of my head I have a notion that I don't like dark beers. But the last 2 beers that I have had were both very dark and I absolutely loved both of them!  This beer is very dark, almost black. I held it up to a light and you could barely see through it. I poured to from the bottle to a glass (as you always should) and it was a glorious moment watching that silky smooth dark liquor moving from the bottle to the glass. The head was thick with a almost tan colour. It had as very smooth texture going down, very easy to drink. The taste was not what I usually associate with a dark beer. The taste was actually very pleasant. I love this beer. I will buy it again. And I will suggest this to ANY beer lover!

The aromas are very bready. There's slugfest of yeast and malt with some caramel and brown sugar and it is pretty mild overall. It tastes of malted barley, brown sugar, molasses, and bready yeast. It also has some subtle dark fruits to it. It drinks really well and is light to medium in body. It has good crispness and goes down smoothly.

In my experience, it shows best in a tulip glass.  The taste is near perfection--one of the smoothest beers I've had, especially considering the 6.7% abv. Dark, roasted, bready malts, nuttiness, chocolate, coffee--really just a complex, and impressively drinkable beer that gets better as it warms up. I recommend not drinking it too chilled as it masks a lot of the flavor. That's the best thing about the beer, is that each sip is better than the last. Anyhow, I recommend this doppelbock to any beer drinker. Unquestionably worth the $14 for a four-pack.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

It finished with a slight bit of lager crispness.  M/D: A full thick body, the carbonation was very smooth. On drinkability terms, this one was fantastic.

There are hints of roast and dark chocolate, as well as caramel and ripe dark fruit. Slight bitterness at the very end. Extremely well balanced.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a mildly dry finish.

Sweet malts, caramel, dark toast, pumpernickel. Mild scents but indicating complexity.  Taste is part lager, part stout, part quad. Rich but subtle roast up front, followed by malt sweetness. Pumpernickel, oats, berries, toffee/caramel. Nothing is big in here. It has a wide array of flavors but all are just noticeably present.  Very smooth and pretty light drinking.

A - Pours a dark mohogany with a ruby red hue, finger of mocha coloured head with decent retention and no real lacing.  S - Musty chocolate and raisins, with a touch of leather. Reminiscent of a barley wine and almost smells like a wet dog.  T - Malted barley comes through with dark fruits and a touch of chocolate and molasses. Leather and toffee notes come through as it warms. A tad on the sour side, and I was expecting something a bit sweeter.  M - Medium bodied ale that goes down smooth but finishes a tad too dry for my liking.  D - Overall a tasty offering, but I certainly didn't have the same experience as some of the other BA's.

39,131,paulginva,4.73,"APPEARANCE: Pouring this beer from a 12 oz. bottle into a Pilsner glass, I was immediately struck by the 1.5"" dark tan frothy head. Lacing was excellent and seemed like it was stuck to the side of the glass with glue. The head dissipated very, very slowly. The body was a cloudy, rich mahogany color with particles suspended seemingly endlessly and a moderate carbonation bubbling slowly to the surface.  AROMA: There was a light aroma of toasted bread, caramel and molasses with a tangy hit of herb scented hop leaf and a light scent of alcohol and dried fruit. All in all, a very inviting aroma.  TASTE: A big hit of malt deliciousness consisting of light molasses and toasted bread matched up with a sharp snap of a smooth hop bitterness and spicy alcohol. A light amount of dried fruit is noticeable along with some hop leaf flavor. There is a really nice taste of residual sugars, dark sugars and fading grain in the end.  MOUTHFEEL: This brew delights the tongue with a full body, a smooth, creamy texture, a soft carbonation and a very light bitter finish. When sipped, the first impression is of a light sweetness and the finish maintains it with the addition of a slight bitterness that engages the whole tongue. Body lacing is excellent.  DRINKABILITY: This is the best Doppelbock I've ever tasted. I can't wait to have another. A bit more expensive than its competition, it still provides excellent value because it is just so much better. Simply a terrific brew.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Taste for me at first was good but not great until the glass warmed a bit, then it was stellar. Got the fruits some caramel some here say banana, I have no idea about that. I got some chocolate.

I remember liking this beer the first time i had it, but now i really really like it.  First it pours a deep dark garnet color with a light beige head. The smell of it is both malty and fruity. The malty sugary smell make up the great majority of the aroma with the caramelized sugar notes, but the stars of the show are the clove and slight banana notes that are present as if a wonderful mild Belgian yeast fairy dropped it into this smooth doppelbock. The taste takes some getting used to still as there is an acidic malt flavor that does tend to ruin what is a wonderful malty and clovelike taste. The mouthfeel of this particular beer is pretty damn smooth. While it isn't the easiest drinking beer that I've ever had it's pretty darn near the top 10.

39,131,BryanRex,4.55,"Holy smokes! This is truly a world class beer, and I can't believe I ran across it randomly at a supermarket for only $12 American (for a 4 pack).  Celebrator is fairly hoppy which results in a more bitter after-taste than I prefer, but it's so well balanced that it's very smooth and is definitely one of the top three beers I've ever experienced.  The pour is a beautiful dark brown which results in a creamy 2-finger head and excellent lacing that persists throughout the entire drink.  The smell is a strong roast malt that hints at a complex blend of roasted toffee, caramel, coffee and molasses. There's more going on than I can explain here, but it reminds me of being a kid at Christmas.  The feel is so incredibly creamy and smooth that it's hard to believe you're actually drinking a carbonated drink. I could appreciate this beverage all night and not realize it even contained alcohol.  If you aren't a die-hard American IPA fan then Celebrator is your brew. If you appreciate quads or any other Belgians (as I do) then you can find a place in your heart for this beer despite its relative bitterness compared to other beer of its style.

The head, leads to some amazing lacing that follows the glass to the very end.  The aromas begin with some toasted malts and toffee/caramel sweetiness at the front. There is a bit of spice and some citrus, herbally hops that come in as well. It finishs with bit of an alcohol smell that warms, but not to big.  The taste on this brew is nothing more then amazing. There is so much going on, but it all come together to make one amazing brew. There are some great malt flavors up front. This flavor leads into the caramel sweetiness that smelled in the aroma that gives and blends well with the citrusy, spicy hops. When you take the bitterness of the hops and the light fruit flavors and the toasted bread/biscuit flavors, you have one killer brew.  The mouthful on this brew is as I have said many times on this brew, amazing. It was cream, full bodied and thick. This super smooth brew, has a great carbonation level that makes it go down that much better.  The drinkablity on this brew is pretty good as well.

S: earthy and dark roasted malt, fig and plum hints. It is extremely earthy and hoppy.  T: burnt biscuit malt and leathery right up front. A lot of bitterness from the hops, and dark pitted fruits on the back and a lingering smokiness.  MF: thick and creamy, astringent and not very effervescent. Filling and extremely bold flavor. A little dry.  D: an amazingly bold and flavorful beer. Not a great deal but its so good I would quickly pick this one up again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,carolinabeerguy,4.47,"Poured from an 11.2 oz. bottle into a pilsner glass.  Pours a deep mahogany brown with ruby highlights and a 2-3 finger creamy khaki colored head. Good lacing.  Smell: Sweet caramel malt, raisins, freshly cured tobacco and a mild nutty aroma.  Taste: Bready malt and a faint hint of chocolate up front followed by caramel malt and dried fruit in the middle middle then finishing with a mix of nuttiness and hoppy bitterness. Aftertaste mildly sweet with a bit of bitterness. Extremely well balanced. Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Very smooth and somewhat creamy.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. The alcohol is completely hidden by the excellent flavor.  Overall: Excellent beer overall. Arguably the best doppelbock in the world. You can't go wrong with this beer. Buy it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,AdamBear,4.28,"A-very dark brown, white head. nice color for the style  S-very sweet with some molasses and belgian sugars. there's even some chocolate. this is quite a comlex smell. i'd rate it higher but its not very strong  T-hits with an extremely smooth taste of light belgian sugars and...bacon...okay okay i know, that sounds crazy...but its true! ends with a smooth burnt chocolatey taste...i love this. there are no negative flavors...just smoothness and complexity working together.  M-really soft carbonation with a dry finish  D-this is a great, complex beer. the complexity slightly runs together as the beer goes on, but the beer leaves me wondering...i feel like i'm missing something, like there's more to the beer and i need to have it again to see what else i can find in it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,StaveHooks,4.69,"A - Pours a dark brown with garnet highlights and edges. 2 finger off-white head that dissipates slowly.  S - Rich malt, chocolate, sweet molasses, creamy toffee, nuts raisins, dried dates, soft vanilla, slight metallic notes.  T - Sweet creamy malt, hints of chocolate a coffee, sugary raisins, roasted toffee. Has an underlying smokiness.  M - Soft creamy feel, adequate carbonation. Full bodied.

39,131,FanofHefe,4.28,"Poured aggressively into a tulip. Great three-finger dark tan head that dissipate fairly quickly leaving just a little lacing. Dark brown body that is nearly black.  Nice aroma of roasted malt and a hint of banana bread. Just a little dark fruity aroma as well.  Smoky roasted malt dominates the flavor up front. Sweet flavors of raisin, chocolate, and caramel compliment, but lightly. Very good combination of flavors.  Smooth mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. Excellent offering.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,random846,4.28,"Appearance: Pours a dark reddish brown with one and a half fingers of tan foam. Really nice lacing.  Smell: Sweet and malty, some caramel.  Taste: Definitely can taste the malts and caramel along with toffee, chocolate, and coffee flavors which were not as evident in the smell.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied, creamy, smooth. Alcohol is well hidden.  Drinkablity: Good drinkability, but I don't see myself wanting more than two of these in a row.  Haven't had many dopplebocks but this is one delicious beer. It is no surprise to me that it is one of the best examples of this style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,wampahoofus,4.45,"Appearance: Dark brown, not quite black. Lots of cream colored head. Really nice lacing  Smell: Sweet and strong. The malt shines through in the aroma. A bit of molasses.  Taste: A nice, deep, sweet, rich, dark malt! Lots of flavor here. The malt has a deep molasses character to it.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and rich. The malt lingers on the palette.  Drinkability: What an enjoyable beer! With all of the craft beer movement focused on ales, it is nice to have such a wonderful lager beer to enjoy!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,VWBuggirl,4.32,"First, this bottle has a little plastic goat that is hung on the neck... that is what made me grab it. I had to know what a beer with a plastic goat tasted like. My boyfriend who also loves beer snuck this into the cart for me.  That being said, I am so happy I gave this a shot! It was a great deep brown with a fizzy head. The scent was heavily malted with hints of chocolate and caramel. It is a smooth drinking beer and highly enjoyable. Not too sweet.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Smakawhat,4.5,"A great big 3 finger tan head with uniform small bubbles on the poor with good retention. Dark brown with many medium sized carbonation bubbles. Minimal lacing  Smell is of a small banana at first but nice malt and a little bit of roast like sausage meat. Slightly dry and bread like toast as well but hard to detect. Even some faint milk chocolate after quaffing. Great smelling beer lots going on here.  Great mouthfeel and a nice sweet banana at first with mild carbonation, turning into a good simple brown bread. Light milkshake wet/viscosity feel and some light faint milk chocolate as well. This is a great finishing drink and a fantastic tasting beer. I'd have another in a heartbeat.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,KickInTheChalice,4.77,"Poured from a 330 mL bottle into a tulip.  Appearance: A dark mahogany color with a fair amount of room for ruby to peer through in more narrow parts of the glass. A dark copper color sneaks into the very edge of the glass.  Smell: A very smooth aroma that works well together. Soft sweet molasses, some dates and spicy, herbal hoppy notes. Sweet bready notes round things out.  Taste: Chewy caramel malt flavor, followed with a touch of molasses, then some spiced bread as the body fills out in my mouth. Some dates step in before a touch of herbal bitterness sets in for a second. The end of the sip approaches, telling the grain and sweetness to wrap up the show in a polite fashion. Finishes clean and a touch sweet.  Mouthfeel: This is an absolute perfect feel. I can feel the little bubbles actually raise up off of my tongue, keeping it fresh for the next sip. Creamy, medium bodied. Sexy.  Drinkability: I'm not ordinarily a Doppelbock drinker, but this is just phenomenal. Extraordinarily happy to have finally tried this.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,plfahey,4.45,"11.2 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance-Deep dark reddish brown with gorgeous ruby highlights. Clear, but almost opaque. Moderate tan head with fine bead, decent retention, and some lacing.  Aroma-Big toasty, bready, caramel, and molasses malt aromas. Some low dark fruit aromas (plum, prune). No hops. Smooth, rich, delicious.  Flavor-Follows aroma, though not quite as sweet. Caramel, toast, bread, molasses, and some light roast in the finish. The dark fruit esters are very light here, but still perceptible. Moderately dry finish. No hop flavos, very low hop bitterness, and no noticeable alcohol.  Mouthfeel-Medium full body, almost chewy. Smooth as hell. Very very slight alcohol warmth.  This one is a delicious, rich, malt driven beer. I don't think I could drink more than a few of them, but damn is this tasty.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Skywave,4.55,"Pours to a Generous beige head that falls to a thin ring and light lacing. Color is deep ruby-brown and is very clear. Aroma is very malty and rich. Flavor is a nice blend of snappy Munich malts, caramelized malt (decoction?) and noble hops for balance. This is a fine doppelbock in terms of flavor. Mouthfeel is medium and CO2 is good for the style. Overall, I would say this beer is a fine representative of the style and a joy to drink. Celebrate!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,pburland23,4.67,"Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a pilsner glass.  Pours a dark mahogany. Almost looks like a glass of Coca Cola. The head is thick and khaki in color. Head doesn't stick around very long though.  Smell is of sweet bready malts, a little caramel and a touch of fruit...cherries and plums. Very complex in taste. It starts off slightly tart before moving to a smoky, not quite rauchbier flavor before ending with a savory rye bread finish.  This is a medium bodied beer with an appropriate level of carbonation. As for drinkability, the breadiness of a doppelbock limits how many of these I could drink in a sitting. It doesn't mean I wouldn't love to make a session out of Celebrator.  A world class beer...I fell in love with Celebrator while traveling in Germany a decade ago. It remains true. Always an enjoy pint.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,crnipeter,4.72,"330 ml bottle, BB reads 04.2011, into tulip. Pours creamy tan head with good retention & stickage atop of opaque yet clear dark brown body with ruby highlights. Aroma is rich maltiness with melanoidin-toasty qualities, dark fruits (plum, prune and dried grapes) originating from the malts used rather than fruity esters of yeast, dark chocolate and some caramel. Malty flavor with melanoidin-toasty qualities, chocolaty with roasty notes, non-harsh alcohol warmth and some hoppy bitterness towards the finish which is quite dry for such a dark Doppel Bock. Very clean lager character with less fruitiness than in the aroma. The body is medium with moderate yet fine carbonation allowing smoothness to this nearly flawless beer. In short: An excellent, rather dry Doppel Bock with clean lager character.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,CanuckRover,4.62,"Pours a very, very, very dark reddish brown, near black. Mocha head settles to a nice thick ring that leaves plenty of lacings behind.  Big rye bread nose with a sweet, almost metallic, twang giving it a bit of oomph.  Liquid bread up front. Big chewy rye-like malt. A very nice subdued molasses sweetness throughout. Just a hint of smoke in the finish as some nice dry, almost tobacco like, hop leaves take over. Finish is surprisingly quenching for such a malt heavy beer. Alcohol is blended in lovingly.  I find the mouth just a touch too thin, but it's actually nice and creamy.  A classic, what more can you say?",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,harrymel,4.08,"Reviewed 06/20/10 Poured from bottle to New Belgium tulip.  A: Immediate bubbling upon cracking bottle. Deep cherry brown. Excellent clarity despite yeast cake confluence.  S: lightly toasted walnuts. warm malts. cocoa.  T: Roasted, malty, nutty. Great beer! Excellent example of doppelbock, maybe one of the best at the price point.  M: fine, creamy carbonation accentuates this med-full bodied beer. rolls over palate and down throat with ease.  D: very drinkable beer. Great dessert. If you haven't, you should try.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,tburus,4.82,"Poured into a Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Cola-colored liquid with off-white head. Head rose high than quick fizzled down to a thin layer over the beer. Not part of the beer, but an added nod for the cute goat ornament adorning every bottle.  Smell: Sweet malty aroma, hint of raisin or cherry. Refreshing hop notes as well.  Taste: Lightly toasted malt flavor, subtle raisin sweetness, and a closing bit of hoppy bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, enjoyable brew. Barely noticeable aftertaste; somewhat of a malt/hop wrestling match going on with maltiness winning out in the end.  Drinkability: As drinkable as water but much more delicious. Low ABV for a Doppelbock and surprisingly complex palate. Available in 4-packs of 330ml but at a price where four Weihenstephan Korbinian 16.9oz singles are actually cheaper. A tough choice to make.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,mikeg67,4.68,"Bottle. Pours dark brown with a small tan head. Aroma is sweet, juicy, liquor like malt, dark fruits (mostly prunes), with some light hoppy notes in the background. Flavor is very rich, sweet malt and dark fruits with floral hops in the long finish. Simply Great!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Huhzubendah,4.45,"A: Dark chestnut brown in color, with a beige head that stands in at over an inch in height, leaving considerable lacing on the glass.  S: Toasted malt, sweet caramels, smoke. Very inviting, this smells like a world class doppelbock, which it certainly is.  T: Extremely tasty, with a subtle rauchbier / smoke flavor about it. A pleasant sweetness sneaks in among the smoke and toasted malt, but only enough to make the beer delectable, not cloying in the least. Toffee and bread with a splash of dark fruit are in there as well. This beer is so delicious and still very accessible, which I find very pleasing.  M: Medium to low in both body and carbonation. The beer is smooth, velvety and creamy on the palate, with alcohol content well disguised.  D: One of the best doppelbocks on the planet. A must have for any beer connoisseur.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Buy it as a gift for any friend or family member whom appreciates good beer and they will truly be greatful for introducing them to this creation. Smooth yet strong.

39,131,jwhancher,4.58,"Bought a single awhile back from the local bottle shop. Have had this before. Poured into my Victory Prima Pils glass.  Pours a ruby red with brownish tan head that lasts for quite awhile. Some suds cling to the glass quite a bit. Aromas of plum, raisin, & fig upfront. Also dark cherry & a tad of chocolate. A bit doughy. A predominantly malty beer.  Tastes of chocolate & cocoa, roasty, tad oak like, and some hints of vanilla. A very even bodied beer with medium mouthfeel. Dry tasting.  Drinkability is just awesome! Only wish it was cheaper to purchase.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,sartoric,4.03,"It pours dark brown with an inch tan head.  Aroma of honey, toasted malt and toffee with note of flowers. The flavour is really complex for a dopplebock. You can feel sugar cane and honey as well as coffe and toasted flavour with a light hoppy background.  The body is medium but not too strong or alcoholic. A very balanced Dunkel Dopple Bock. Definitely a must-have beer.  Paired with a typical Italian dish ""fagioli con le cotiche"" (""fasoeu cui cudich"" in Milanese dialect :-) ) stewed beans with pork rind.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,beerhan,3.43,Bottle poured into a pint glass and split. I really could not get into this beer but It probably is great if you like this style. I pours a nice dark brown with a foamy head but then everything goes down for me. Tastes and smells way too smokey and I did not find this to balance well with the caramel maltiness that much. Overall I found it just too thick and not very drinkable for what it was.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,Shrews629,3.53,"Appearance - Very dark brown with ruby and burnt orange highlights. Clear when held to the light. Decent head produced with the pour. Tan with good retention and nice lacing.  Smell - Complex roasty and smokey notes. Seems to be a lot going on with the smell. Dark, rich malt. One review I read mentioned the smell of ""lard"" and I'm certainly picking that aroma out. Some chocolate in there also.  Taste - Again getting a roasty, smokey flavor. A bit sweet, but not overly sweet. Agian, I am detecting that ""lard"" taste. Different for sure. Chocolate is also coming through. No real alcohol flavor, which is ok with me. As the berr warms it becomes more rich in the sweetness.  Mouthfeel - Medium to full mouthfeel. Creamy and smooth. Almost an oily finish. Plenty left on the palate. The mouthfeel reminds me of a Stout. Nice. Very nice.  Drinkability - This beer may be a bit advanced for my amateur palate and nose. This brew has a lot of different characteristics. Honestly, it was not that easily drinkable for me. This is probably a brew I will have to try again in a few yrs. First doppelbock I have ever tried and it was a bit overwhelming.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,ryan1788a5,4.5,"11.2oz bottle poured into a Pilsner Glass. Nice goat trinket.  A: Clear mahogany brown with a big creamy tan head. Great retention, the head lasts as long as the beer. Spotty lacing clings to the glass.  S: Lots of brown bread, some chocolate, light fruity esters, faint herbal and grassy hops, maybe a hint of straw. Mild alcohol presence. Assertive and very complex.  T: A touch of caramel and molasses, lots of bread, toasted malts, some raisin and plum. Light herbal hop presence. Finish stays rather sweet with flavors of chocolate, caramel, and bread.  M: Medium bodied, but lush, full, and creamy. Mild warming alcohol.  D: Very high for a bigger beer.  Notes: Excellent. Near perfection in every aspect. Not quite as big (abv-wise) as most of the doppelbocks I've had, and the spicy alcohol character is not as pronounced, but this is nit-picking. This beer is malty, thorough, well crafted, and delightfully complex.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A nice thick, light brown head accompanies an aggressive pour.  S: I'm a little stopped up because of the weather change in the last week, but let's see. Roasted malts come at me, a hint of chocolate, a hint of caramel, a hint of toasted nuts. Maybe the slightest earthy/grassy hint of hops is in there.  T: Definitely get some chocolate. It's interesting I tried this for the first time after the Sam Adam's Chocolate Bock in the winter seasonal pack, because this has all the dark, roasty chocolate flavor without any cloying sweetness. Roasted nuts appear again in the flavor, with maybe the slightest coffee acidity present.  F: Body has medium viscosity. Full and creamy, goes smooth over my tongue. However, it still finishes very clean, and keeps me coming back for another sip.  D: I'm very new to this style, but I could have a couple of these with some barbeque ribs and baked beans, I think.

39,131,tharper,4.24,"A- dark ruby brown - translucent to 200 watt bulb within 6 inches only (very opaque)- brilliant with two finger head that diminishes to 1/4 inch within 5 minutes  S- awesome, rich malt aroma with very slight hallertau hop tinge  T- smooth, silky, slightly sweet, deep malt - with very low bitterness &lt; 25 ibu  M- smooth, very full for the low gravity considering, lager vinegar aftertaste that disappears quickly leaving a round tone on the palate.  D- could drink 3 bottles easily without desire to change style  Overall this is an incredibly perfect example of the style. I have tried many dopplebocks and this is the most middle-of-the-road stylistic example. This isn't a slight, but rather a proof of concept and guide for crafting a more extreme sample.

39,131,Lemke10,4.32,"I bought a single bottle of this from Woodman's in Janesville, WI for about $3.50 in Fall 2010.  The German doppelbock is a must try as it is quite different than American dopplebocks. It pours a very dark brown color with a decent head on it. While there is very little carbonation, there is a reasonably strong coffee/cocoa flavor making the beer extremely flavorful but yet giving it a smooth finish. Drinks fine by itself, but would pair excellent with most foods.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,dirkchivers,4.02,"-goes well with food -first time i had this it had very strong fresh wort character, which was very unpleasant with the alcohol presence. the second round, upon which the review is based, was much different, more malt and chocolate.  A - deep ruby with a clinging head, a quick swirl shows some alcohol in the legs. Ayinger certainly have a distinctive packaging for this dbock, and i've been cognizant of Celebrator for years before i finally got around to buying a 4pk. S- alcohol in the nose melding with dark chocolate, well balanced. a lot of alcohol in the nose for 6.7%, but whatever. T- between roasted malt and munich malt character. some chocolate. alcohol coming in on the finish. cleans up well with a lingering roasty-ness M- silky but carbonated. well suited for the beer but was unpleasant the first round.

39,131,allforbetterbeer,4.33,"Poured into a snifter.  Pours thick and dark producing a refined and controlled two full fingers of creamy head that slowly falls to form a half finger layer that laces wonderfully and retains well. Body looks black in low light, but when back-lit, the light that manages to penetrate takes on a deep ruby color of exquisite hue. World class appearance.  The nose is not as strong as I expected, but the general make-up is spot on. A full array of malts greet my sense of smell, from medium crystal malt to much darker roasted malts. This whole body of smells doesn't stray into the dark fruit realm that some of this style or the barleywine style can, but stays more to the center of malted barley spectrum. Hop presence in the nose is minimal but enough to keep things in balance.  Rich roasted malts are powerful and delicate in this flavor profile. Burnt sugar, dark caramel, and hints of chocolate rush through the mouth as this excellent lager swirls over the tongue. There is a reason this is one of the main benchmarks for this style. A true malted barley experience. Alcohol is as hidden as can be. Hops are present only to keep things in balance and they do that job well.  The mouthfeel is full and smooth, in a word- rich. Drinkability top notch for this ""meal in a bottle"". Flavors are full, body is thick, and the alcohol is nowhere to be found. What more could you desire from this style?  Conclusion: A superbly crafted lager. The low ABV is remarkable considering the full body, complex flavors and overall power of this beer. This goes to show that tons of alcohol isn't needed to make a big beer that tastes wonderful. One of the best beers ever to swirled in my glass.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

It's burnt malts, sweet, but then there's some sort of tang I can't place. Almost sour.. or funky. It's distinct. Taste is great too - the sweetness continues with some nice hop notes in the middle. It fills the mouth - the bubbles take care of that more than the body.  With the low abv and the nicely complex taste, this one is a redrinker if you're into it. To be honest, I'm not that much. It's a little off for me.  I could see someone drinking a whole pack to figure out the taste. But I only bought one. So I'll just content myself with looking at the nice little animals on the front of the bottle.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Phelps,4.05,"Looks: charmed. Bonus points for the little goat necklace on the bottle. The beer itself is dark and purplish like merlot, and at first appears to be opaque, though a hold to the light reveals the clarity and color of grape juice. A one-finger head of light khaki foam sits atop and recedes rather quickly, becoming a thick, sticky ring and film. 4  Smells: like teriyaki! Wow, weird. Also picking up some raisins and lightly toasted bread.  Tastes: like toasted, rum-soaked raisin bread. The teriyaki drops off, but the Asian flavors continue with a little sesame. Oh so smooth.  Feels: very lightly carbonated. The beer softly massages the tip of the tongue. Velvet-smooth medium body, very lightly fizzy, with an alcohol warmth that tickle the chest.  Drinks: prominently. I enjoyed this beer in a tasting up against doppelbock standouts like Liberator and the classic Salvator, and even amongst the greats, Celebrator still stands out. A delicious doppelbock and a delicious beer in general.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Poured a 2"" head which gradually dissipated to 1/4"". Dark as coffee. It had a delicious dark roasted malt smell and taste with lots of chocolate and kind of a rye bread bitterness. Very flavorful stuff, including a long finish. I'd celebrate with this anytime.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,wmtxbb,4.5,"Bottle poured into pint glass  Appearance: Dark color with finger sized head that turns into an layer of lacing around the top.  Smell: Malts and grains. It's a very sweet smell almost like malts mixed with molasses.  Taste: Very complex. Sweet burnt malt character, almost stout like. Very heavy malts that mix with the hops and alcohol to produce a sharp flavored ending to every sip. I first had this beer at room temperature and then the next day I decided to have a cooled version for my review. I wasn't wild about the flavor at room temperature. It tasted sort of metallic and too malty. The cooled down version, which I'm reviewing now is far better.  Drinkability: This is heavenly nectar. I'm typically biased towards malty brews and this is one of the best I've had in a while. Easy to sip on and have by itself. I don't see this as a beer that you could drink with food though.

The back end shows a bit of floral hop bitterness. Very nicely done, indeed.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Mouthfeel is just under medium, very smooth and creamy, but a little light in my opinion.

39,131,Satchboogie,4.45,"11.2oz bottle, no freshness date, poured into a pilsner glass.  A: dark, dark brown with deep red mahogany when put up to the light. Pours a big 3-finger foamy head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving just a little lace.  S: Smells like a old-style porter, lots of dark fruits, bready, malty, a little bit medicinal. Pleasant.  T: Dark, bitter, and malty. Lots of stale dark bread, molasses, bitter roasted quality, prunes, figs, dark fruits, ester essences, some medicinal qualities. The bitter roasted quality his the palate fairly strongly and then mellows into the dark fruits and then fades into a dry, ester finish, slightest bit bitter and nice and warm.  M: Very bubbly (tiny bubbles) even 15 minutes in, little bit sticky, bitterness initially that returns faintly in the finish. Very smooth and somewhat refreshing. Very nice.  D: The slight bitter, ester finish makes you want to take another sip and I have no problem with that! I could easily drink a couple of these and feel refreshed, even on a hot summer day.  This is one tasty, refreshing Doppelbock that warms nicely, but isn't a hard hitter, sitting at 6.7% ABV. Very complex dark fruit flavor and malt, went perfectly with the pot pie I had for dinner.

39,131,cuttsjp,4.37,"Appearance: Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. SUPER dark. Almost opaque until you hold it directly up to a light, at which point you see some red and brown tones buried deep within. Small but beautiful and perfect tan head. Sticky lacing. Generally a beautiful beer.  Aroma: Brown sugar, molasses, and warm alcohol deepened with beautiful tones of dark fruit; figs, dates, plum, and raisins. A little spice on the nose as well.  Flavor: BIG complex flavor: raisins, figs, and dates accompanied by dark, natural sugars. Very similar to the aroma. Strangely enough, less alcohol in the flavor than in the aroma. Really balanced sweetness, not cloying. A definite perceptible roasty bitterness that is more like the crust on a good loaf of dark bread than like coffee or chocolate. Delicious bready malts round out the flavor (give us this day our daily bread...).  Mouthfeel: Beautifully smooth, with a medium-full body. Not quite as ""chewy"" as I was expecting from such a high gravity, malty beer, but I think that the real mouthfeel is much more pleasant than a giant, thick one that just bogs the drinker down. Matches up perfectly with the flavors.  Overall: What a wonderful beer. I have tried other dopplebocks, and this is almost definitely the one that I have enjoyed the most. The complexity of it is incredibly exciting to the palate and begs me to come back for more. Very drinkable for a big beer, because the whole thing is really very balanced. This is definitely not a beer that you would reach for on your average trip to the beer store, but it is a wonderful treat for a special occasion and definitely a great warming winter beer. Would be a perfect beer to sip by the fire on Christmas Eve while watching the snow fall. Ahhh...",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Nice finger and a half of khaki colored head initially that laces just slightly, but slides down the side of the glass. Starts to dissipate fairly quickly though.  Aroma is dark caramel malt sweetness initially, but with some dark dried fruit, figs, prunes and raisins. A little anise/licorice flavor as well.  Taking a sip, I'm somewhat surprised that the taste is not as sweet as the nose. The dark fruit is barely present, mostly a anise and malty flavor. Good, but not as complex as the nose when the beer is ~40°F.  Medium bodied beer with lots of small bubble carbonation leads to a nice, creamy mouthfeel. The beer is a little too easy to drink, as I can easily have several of these without noticing the alcohol content.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,JayS2629,4.18,"I part with the majority. I was very excited to find this beer. I found the only store in Columbus that carries it. Perhaps it was the hype that made it disappointing. Also, I might be biased. The first double bock I had was Troeg's Troegenator. Still my favorite. This one just didn't have the same richness and complexity.  A- Exceptional. A nice light coffee tone with swirls of amber. A nice wispy tan head.  S- Notes of caremel and molasis. Slight woody tones.  T- Very clean. hints of chocolate raisain. A slight smoky taste. Crisp. Not as rich as expected. Complex, but I've had better.  D- Very representative of what a double bock should be. I think its overrated. I prefer the Troegenator for its more robust and rich complexities. Not bad. I'd buy it again, but won't go crazy seeking it. Its a rarity so if I see it I'll get it.  This beer is very enjoyable and I completely understand why it gets the good reviews it does. I'm giving it an A and I would buy it again.

Middle consists of caramel malts. Finish is all dark fruits - cherry, raisin and plums with a minor hint of chocolate.  M: Medium body, medium carbonation, slightly slick mouthfeel.

The head is composed of rich tight tab bubbles 4 fingers high. After 5 minutes the head slowly subsides to a thin ring. In the nose I'm picking up a lot of rich caramel and chocolate with a subtle roasted element. The taste is so beautifully clean and crisp. There are elements of roasted chocolate, molasses and a subtle twist of smoke. This beer feels creamy and smooth on the tongue with subtle carbonation.

A hard pour of this dark brown brew gives a reluctant 1/2"" of creamy tan head that settles quickly to a thin layer. A generous level of carbonation is seen clinging to the inside of the glass. The nose is spot-on, thick and bready, brown sugar, some earthy nutty kind of aspects, banana. The feel is only moderately thick, fairly dry, with a fairly aggressive carbonation. Taste is kind of muddy- some earthy bitterness, burnt molasses, maybe some anise... all lumped together, none of it is distinct. Taste is much less interesting than the smell. Finishes with lingering bitter earth, mostly dry.  Pretty mediocre in my opinion, certainly nothing special. More like a dunkel than a doppelbock, especially in the lack of sweetness or body. Can't believe it rates this highly.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smell is toasted grains, chocolate, and just a touch of hop bitterness.  Flavor is great. HUGE notes of chocolate and dark fruits shine, and give way to a bit of toasted grains and a bit of a hop presence. Delicious brew.  Nice medium to full bodied mouthfeel. Slight bit of prickly carbonation keep it alive.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,biboergosum,4.35,"330ml bottle, this was a favourite at an office party where I provided the input to the beer selection, a few years ago, at least now. Time to enjoy it while off the clock, I suppose.  This beer pours a moderately hazy, deep dark cola colour, with a multitude of foamy, bubbly, and somewhat creamy beige head, which leaves some solid spidery lace around the glass as it gradually settles.  It smells of musty caramel/toffee malt, softly bittersweet sticky molasses, muddled black fruit, bready biscuit notes, and floral, spicy hops. The taste is lightly roasted caramel malt, well-aged dark fruit, slick cafe au lait, ethereal chalky cocoa, a twinge of salty nuttiness, tobacco ash, and adequately bitter leafy, earthy hops.  The carbonation is quite mild, but hardly absent from its underlying duties, the body medium-full in weight, subtly rich, and decently smooth by the same measure. It finishes in a nicely balanced manner, the lingering malt complexities and noble hops acting like they've been through this a few times before.  Nothing surprising here - the effusive, long-running hype is more than well deserved. Call it what you will - the blueprint, the (almost) progenitor, whatever, this is a deftly rendered, crazily easy to drink, amped-up dark lager, for all your latent winter-despising needs.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,haazer,4.82,"Poured into a hefeweizen glass.  A- Pours a thick chocolatey colored head. An amber, dark brown appearance to the brew. Bottom of the glass is a see through red glow, however up towards stubborn settling head is the dark brown, almost non see through chocolate color. Almost no lacing. The goat charm gets points just because.  S- Roasted peanuts, which is making me want some like crazy. Hints of chocolate and caramel. Smell the yeast in the slightest. The roasted peanuts though for me at least, is the most dominant.  T- Let me say something, this is only the second dopplebock I've ever tried, but I'm willing to bet anyone that I'll never taste a better one. Lets see, caramel, chocolate, roasted malts, the peanut flavor is there, and bread. This thing reminds me of malt powder somewhat in a milk shake, or the malt ball candy you can buy. Not only will this most certainly be the best dopplebock I've had, but also most likely, and currently one of the best tasting beers I've ever had.  M- Super creamy. Feels like buttermilk. Medium bodied. Slightly sweet on the palatte.  D- Incredible. Glad when I went to Total Wine that I got a fourpack instead of just one. When I go to the best distributor in my area next time, I'll be tempted to buy a case. No hint of alcohol whatsoever. The only thing from keeping this beer perfect is the appearance is good. Yes, MERELY good. Everything else is just incredible.  Notes: Prost to Franz Inselkammer for making such a great beer.

It's hard to pinpoint the taste since there is so much going on in here.... maybe burnt caramel over cocoa puffs!! Spicy, chocolatey and biscuity. Just enough alcohol warmth to cut through the malt and sweetness. Very easy to drink for a 7% ABV beer.  I see now what all the fuss was about with Celebrator Doppelbock.

Tons of lace all over the glass.  S- Instantly like it. The biggest thing here to me is the old caramel malt and nice slight spicy/earthy/floral German hop notes. Raisins, vanilla, rum come to mind. Old ale feeling.  T- Just like the smell but made better by truffley chocolate. Added to the caramel, German hops and dark fruit, it is delicious. Reminds me of a liqueur in a way. Very nice hop usage.  MF- Light and it makes it all the better. The low carbonation allows the flavors to really shine. Slight bitterness.  DB- Extremely drinkable for such a highly flavorful beer. The body allows the taste to truly shine. Has an Old Ale-like flavor set but drinks like an APA.

Milk chocolate, sweet biscuits and dark bread upfront, then with a subtle raisin-like fruitiness to the end. Very little bitterness and no noticeable hop character.  Mouthfeel - 4.5 Fine carbonation, light to medium body, goes down very smoothly.  Drinkability - 4.0 I could easily have had a second, and a third.

39,131,bobhits,1.96,"Dark reddish brown, barely allows light through but it does, thin head that vanishes, I can't see any carbonation but it's so hard to see through this.  Sweet dark fruits and then quickly goes towards bitter but doesn't get there. I want to say plums and maybe a hint of cherry and some raisins. It seems like a double bock only a touch sweeter, less powerful, and somewhat subtle and boring. A touch of alcohol at the end just barely.  This is a top 100 beer? Are you joking me? Just a malt bomb that as a hint of bitter flavor at the finish. A dark fruity opening, plumbs and raises and maybe caramel/bready malt. More bready than caramel. The hops are earthy and they pack almost enough bitterness, but they don't balance this beer.  The mouth feel is really really well done. Plenty of carbonation but not so much I'm burping it up. Creamy enough to savor, but thin enough for the style and to drink.  Well this is also really drinkable. I don't like the beer. I rarely don't like a beer. I often think it's a weak example of a style or a style that isn't very well made. This one just isn't very good. If you want a better example of the style check out Weihenstephaner's example....it's far superior. So I'm torn. I dislike it, but it without the flavor actor is pretty drinkable.

T - This is definitely right up my alley for the style. Too many (for me) doppels run too far to the sweet side, but this one sticks to the basics, with roasted malts, some earthiness, and a touch of yeast at the forefront. Yum.  M - Maybe a little on the thin side for me -- the carbonation is higher than I'm used to.  D - Mid-strong, and great flavors combine to make this a pretty drinkable beer.

Notes: Not my favorite beer. I do feel a bit awkward rating a beer so differently from everyone else. I looked at the brothers' review and I see that I noticed similar flavors as them.

39,131,Reaper16,4.52,"12oz. bottle served into a tulip glass  Pours as brown as brown can be. The body is brown like the glass bottle it came in. A bit of red peeks through on the outermost edges. One finger of lightly tan head doesn't stick around for very long. Lacing is left behind in high arcs, like arched eyebrows.  This is the malt bomb to end all malt bombs. Nothing smells like this. It smells like the traditional ""beer"" scent taken to its logical extreme. Deeply browned cereal grains, tons of toasted baguette, something sweet like cake. There is a deep, pungeant smell coming from the intense malt profile that makes me think of stink bait for fishing (I bet that's the first time you've seen that description in a beer review. I know, I'm just as surprised). Some decent roast character lends itself to flutters of dark chocolate.  The abundance of malt carries over to the palate. This tastes like fruitcake dusted with coffee and caramelized under a kitchen blowtorch. So much sweetness - from the sugary flavors to the appleskin and berry esters - meet with the coffee-like roasted character and the super-toasted breadcrusts. Perhaps a tiny bit of oxidation. There's just enough hop bitterness to keep this beer honest, but after it warms up that bitterness just melds into the roast anyway. This is the textbook Dopplebock.  I adore the mouthfeel of this beer. It is definitely on the heavy side of medium-bodied but it isn't extremely thick. It has a very satisfying toothsome quality to it. The beer is carbonated but the bubbles aren't very assertive. This makes for a incomparably smooth drink. The heft of the beer as you swallow is so satisfying. I'd give this a 5.5 in mouthfeel if I could. Drinkability is damn good for the style. All this abundance of malt flavor at only 6.7% ABV is remarkable.  When you feel like a very malty lager there are few beers you should turn to before Celebrator. Absolutely perfect for these Fall evenings.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Tastes of sweet caramel malts up front that give way to a bit of chocolate, and a hint of roasty coffee. The caramel sweetness lasts the whole way through and the roast and caramel sweetness linger.

Rich, malty but not sweet, more than a touch of coffee, a little less in the way of hops. Wonderfully dry finish and a lingering bitterness that comes from the roasted malts rather than from hops, I think.  Very good mouthfeel - thick, chewy, full-bodied.

A fair amount of lacing is retained.  Smell gets its own paragraph here. You know when you go to a brewery and the air has that distinct smell of grains intermingling with hops and the other aromas wafting around? That smell that, though it isn't yet beer, is the quintessential beer aroma, and you just can't inhale enough of it? Celebrator Doppelbock smells like that. It's perfect. Someone needs to make one of those Christmas tree air fresheners that smells like this - I'd never leave my car.  The taste is primarily malt - a bit biscuity and sweet, with a small but noticeable hop presence. There's also a slight alcoholic tinge to it that is surprising for its abv.

Dark fruits are abundant in the nose with dates and prunes being the most noticeable; some raisin is present as well. There is also a nice coffee and chocolate aroma that comes out as well.  D - Sweet malts with some nice molasses flavor and some clight coffee flavors. Dark sugary fruits are definitely in the forefront of this profile as well. Raisins and prunes stand out amongst all the flavors. Slight alcohol at the back of the palate.  M - Slightly sticky on the palate. Some nice carbonation and medium bodied. Despite it being not a full bodied, thick beer, it is a nice rich beer.  D - Nicely drinkable. Not too heavy and a great sipping beer. Could easily get lost in several of these in a sitting.

The spicy aroma is where the alcohol hides. Lots of dark sugars are apparent as well, adding some hints of dark fruit.  T - Bready, chewy, malty with sweet caramel. The sweetness just explodes on the back end with hints of burnt brown sugars and spicy dried dark fruits. Complex, yet to the point. This tastes excellent.  M - Fairly big bodied, yet creamy, smooth, and somewhat refreshing. The only trace of alcohol is on the way down.  D - This one could be gone in no time, but I'm savoring it because it's my first ever. This seems like a beer you could session at 6.7%, then again you'd probably get pretty buzzed.

Relatively large but uniform bubbles gave a great indication on the mouthfeel.  Supremely malty and sweet smelling. Definitely alluring, especially on the first day that's really felt like fall.  Great deep malts and sweetness up front, with a small metallic tang that I seem to get from a lot of German beers. After a few seconds of the malts dancing on the tongue, a vague balancing bitterness starts offsetting the sugar in a perfect manner. The hops crescendo to a straight bitter that is washed away by another glorious gulp, restarting the whole process.  My only complaint, and it's not a huge one, is the mouthfeel. This beer is seriously carbonated. If you swill a little of it and let it sit in your mouth, it becomes a ball of froth which is not really like liquid any more. Once the beer has gassed out a little bit this goes away and I think the beer is better for it.  Very very drinkable.

T - A good amount of burnt brown sugar/molasses with lots of toasted dark bread. Big kick of spice (mostly clove and pepper but others) mid sip with a good amount of grassy and herbal hop flavors with a touch of bitterness. Nutty and earthy flavors also come out mid sip. Some dark fruit (plum, fig, date, touch of raisin) provides a background taste through out. Also a slight tartness with that fruity flavor. Perfectly balanced flavors.  M - Medium body with a lot of carbonation. Pretty smooth and creamy, but could use just a touch more for the style. Touch of a drying finish.  D - Pretty drinkable beer with perfectly balanced flavors. Only thing that really holds it back is the slightly sweet and drying finish.  Notes: Very good beer and a great example of a Doppelbock.

I'm smelling dark fruits, plum, raspberry, fig, raisins. Also quite a bit of bittersweet chocolate here and vanilla/caramel. A smidge of coffee even enters the equation, which I wasn't expecting.  Taste is more of the same. Happy to report that this is not sickly sweet like many of the other doppelbocks I have had. Good bit of dark fruit up front, lots of fig, almost like eating a fig newton. Huge caramel mid-range, with a good amount of vanilla, and more coffee rounds out the flavor than was in the smell. Yum!  Mouthfeel is almost perfect. Smooth and creamy yet well carbonated, the only dock I can give it is that it may be a little thinner than I was looking for.  Drinks impeccably well. No alcohol heat to speak of at all, extremely palatable flavors with no off flavors at all. Damn, it's hard to put a finger on why this is such a great beer, but it really is a great great classic.

IBUs? 330 ml into a Samuel Adams ""perfect pint""  Apperance 5/5 Pours clear and dark brown with a light brown colored bubbly head, that recedes to a thin, but persistent and creamy one, with good lacing.  Aroma 5/5 A very rich aroma, full of dark fruit (raisins and figs), like a fresh, warm dessert. Caramel. There is a strong malt presence that goes well beyond mere sweetness. This is one of the best smelling malt forward beers that I have had a chance to try.  Taste 4/5 Taste is similar to aroma, but has a stronger candied, almost burnt, sugar character, that could be identified as molasses, but nowhere as viscous. Sweet all the way without being cloying, because of the excellent flavor. There is a slight bitterness that doesn't seem ""hop-like"". This bitterness balances the malts quite well, so that the overall impression is like caramel: nice! The finish is moderately dry: attenuated, given the sweetness. Although a residual sweetness is still notable over the course of the beer, it is adequately complemented by a darker taste. What's missing? Strength.  Mouthfeel 3.5/5 For a beer of this taste, I would prefer a stronger body. Also, the carbonation is higher. Wait after drinking some of it, and it does feel like you've had bread: very fitting! But my only complaint is a thin body.  Drinkability 3.5/5 I can drink a few of these. But if you're having more than one, it needs to be accompanied by some food, to avoid cloying aftertaste. I wrote that the taste is not cloying but a malty beer will get to you, given enough sips. Period. Usually this won't affect drinkability score for me, but this beer has a thin body. Had it been stronger in body, I'd give it a 5/5 on drinkability but in the long run, for this ABV & body, drinkability is not the best.  Other Overall, this seems like a milder doppelbock. An enjoyable drink indeed, but going by the style guidelines, it needs to be more aggressive in taste and body.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S: In addition to the rich maltiness and slight bitter scent, there is plenty of that characteristic savory doppelbock scent. Sweet vanilla, rum, scotch, and herbal scents dominate the nose.  T: Besides a strong toasted maltiness with a bitter side of hops, there is the savory, almost steak-like taste characteristic of good doppelbocks (as opposed to the not so nice ones which taste like marinara sauce). I can detect something of butterscotch as well. The dominant feel of the taste is something like drinking a good scotch, just with a quarter of the alcohol.  M: Incredibly smooth and luxurious on the tongue. You can clearly taste the alcohol. Leaves a smooth, wistful feeling in the mouth.  D: Very delicious, but ONLY WHEN COLD.

39,131,Kaiser81,4.12,"Did the Imperial beach Triathlon (actually think it's called Surf Town instead of IB, but whatever) and so I think this is a fitting beer to have.  Bought at South Coast Drugs, since I was in the neighborhood. Bottle poured into a snifter glass  A - A deep molasses color. There was a few mm worth of head, and it died down fairly quickly. Not much lacing is left on my glass.  S - Some nice roast smells mixed with a biscuity sweetness. I almost want to say I get a touch of oak or bourbon in there too. No, I lied. It's vanilla. I like vanilla.  T - Similar to the smell. Some nice roast mixed with espresso and a touch of malty sweetness on the back. Lots of flavor for the style. There's a little bit of a boozy bite on the end of it as well.  M - High carbonation with an oily/heavy body. Maybe a touch too high on the carbonation for me.  D - Really good doppelbock. It's drinking easy, but I prefer other styles. Glad I finally tried this, though.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A: Pours a deep dark brown with ruby highlights and a big fuzzy light brown head that reduced into a thick film that left spots of lace. S: Big malty notes of caramel, molasses with a hint of vanilla. T: Follows the nose with rich dark malts and molasses. Slight grassy hop undertones poke through the overwhelming malty sugary sweetness. Aftertaste has a light bitterness, but isn't dry, and tastes a bit like toasted marshmallows. Slight burnt notes. M: Rich medium body with a syrupy mouthfeel and light, tingly carbonation. Very slick. No alcohol present. D: What a rich and flavorful beer. I'm no expert on the style but I know a good beer when I taste one, and while this isn't going to win a whole lot of shelf room in my fridge, it is a great beer none the less.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

There is a slight metallic smell upon first pouring, but it soon disappears.  Taste -- Overall very sweet and malty: raisin, dark pitted fruits, molasses, coffee, cocoa, and dark toast. Like the nose, there is a faint metallic taste initially, but this soon disappears as well.  Mouthfeel -- Medium in body, but chewy, with mild, creamy carbonation. I can't imagine a better mouthfeel. Glorious.  Drinkability -- This is yet another beer that I set back on the shelf numerous times before finally purchasing. I could kick myself for missing out on such a great beer for so long. Celebrator is more than deserving of all it's accolades. Wonderful.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Tastes/smells of molasses, the city streets after a rain, the inside of a high quality Halloween mask, plum, raisins and a gasoline pump (on a good day) all rolled into a toasty, malty beer.  Very drinkable and nicely complex.  Drank while listening to soundtrack to ""Good, Bad and the Ugly.""",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Taste is of caramel malts...raisins...molasses....figs maybe. A heavy beer without being TOO heavy. Finish has basically no bitterness on it at all, but there is a very healthy dose of caramel sweetness....alcohol is somewhat noticeable but not astringent, as the ABV isn't all that high. There isn't that much of an aftertaste either, aside from a bit of residual sweetness.  It's certainly a malty monster, but I like that it doesn't go to the point where I feel I'm going to go into a diabetic coma from drinking it. It's balanced quite well.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,UnknownKoger,4.33,"Poured from the bottle into my Celebrator glass. Pours dark and has a good head which fizzles down into a nice foamy rim. Immediately the smells of coffee, nuts, and roasted malts hit my nose. Smells delicious. First taste confirms this. It's delicious and not heavy at all. For some reason I was always intimidated by the doppelbock style (maybe because it's dark?), but this is very user friendly. The taste matches the scents and has very light body and mouthfeel.  For me, it always comes down to drinkability and whether or not I would buy it again. This is very drinkable and, in my opinion, a good introduction to darker beers. And I would/will definitely buy it again",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Mouthfeel is solid - nothing wrong here at all.  All in all, this beer is good, but I just simply wasn't wow'd. To get an A out of me, I need to be wow'd. I found this merely ""good.""

The taste was complex and balanced, nothing at all was overpowering or stood out. The sweet malt was of dark toasted nougat, caramel, and graham, with a little raspberry fruitiness. A little spice was evident at the tip of the tongue, but I was unable to identify it. The mouth was full bodied and had a tight and secure fit over all of the flavor that this brew is carrying.

39,131,Soonami,4.33,"For my 100th review, I decided to pick a top 100 beer to drink, no. 57 Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock. This is a live review.  Celebrator is a great doppelbock, obviously. The beer pours a beautiful deep brown, the color of aged tan leather, with a khaki cap. The foam quickly disintegrates into a tan outline with a coat of lacing on the glass. The smell is of toasted whole wheat bread, molasses, and sweetly fermenting yeasty dough. The beer has very deep malt flavor with rich maltiness, toasty grain, and a hint of bitterness to cut through the malt sweetness. The body is rich and luxurious with perfect carbonation. The finish is a little sweet with resonating grain sweetness, but not cloying. The alcohol is warming on the way down, but imperceptible on the tongue.  This is a very nice beer that blends the richness of 100% german kilned malts with a solid hop bitterness and smooth finish.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Has a not so sweet caramel flavor. Personally I do not really like this beer but maybe that is because I just do not like bocks in general. I really do not like this beer at all.

Full of rich malt with a chocolate/coffee undertone.  Taste is very balanced. The subtle flavors of chocolate, coffee, and hops do not overpower any single flavor. Smooth, and vibrant.

39,131,klikger,4.07,"330 ml bottle poured into SA perfect pint  A - Dark brown with a dash of maroon; a modest amount of brown head dissipates & leaves some quality lacing.  S - Bold malts and molasses  T - Fresh barley and toffee start things off and stick around for the duration. As it passes through the mouth, the malt explosion continues, with notes of caramel and brown sugar. The end is more of the same, with a little earthiness and a hint of coffee bean adding to the complexity.  M - Very smooth with some substance, but not overly thick. Carbonation is understated.  D - Pretty drinkable, but the sugars would probably get to me after a couple.  This is the first bock which I've had in awhile, and I really liked it. I look forward to drinking it again in the coming months.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,rawthar,4,"A- Very dark earthy brown body, wouldn't be confused for a stout, full and thick with little in the way of carbonation working through the murk. Initially, a desert fatigue tan head blossoms from below, but it is quickly pulled back into the thick depths.  S- Hints of coffee and heavily roasted malts, some very dark and unsweetened baker's chocolate, and equal parts malty sweetness and woody bitterness. The overarching culmination of aromas adds up to something like a rich buttery toffee with a tiny mention of booze.  T- Flavors up front follow the nose closely, but the hoppy backstop really cleans up the terminus of the flavor, providing a really satisfying experience. Root vegetables appear in the finish to balance out the sugar plums in the introduction. Some lactic acid pops up throughout. Really goes places that few lagers can dream of.  M- Feels like a cold cocoa, thick and milky, and very smooth.  D- A little more appropriate for colder weather than the east coast is getting nailed with right now, but a nice occasional alternative to a stout.

39,131,Gobzilla,3.83,A: poured a dark brown with a thin head that left a little sticky lacing on the glass.  S: It had brown sugar and molasses aromas with hints of belgian yeast plums and other dark fruits. There is also faint booze notes.  T: molasses and brown sugar dominate the taste which had plum and dark fruit accents. Like the nose I could detect some booze and slight chocolate flavor.  M: medium to full bodiy with a low amount of carbonation that had a sweet and very slight boozy finish.  D: it drank good and was a great interpretation of a dopplebock.

39,131,bagpiper2005,4.67,"Pour: Gorgeous dark red color with a finger and a half of light tan head that dissipated somewhat quickly and left minimal lacing and a small ring of head all the way down.  Smell: Big caramel malt smell with underlying notes of chocolate, molasses, dark fruit, a light earthy hop note, and a just a touch of alcohol.  Taste: Starts off with a big sweet molasses taste and a slight bready note which then gives way into a less sweet caramel malty taste. This is followed up by a hint of currant/raisin and a slight hint of dark chocolate taste. The back end finishes up with a moderate hop bitterness and a slight bit of alcohol warmth, but neither linger.  Mouthfeel: This is the only drawback to this beer, I found it to be a little thin for the style (more toward the medium end of the spectrum), but it's smooth and creamy, with light carbonation.  Drinkability: About the most drinkable beer I think I've ever had. Smooth drink, slides down the throat, and leaves you wanting another sip.  Final Notes: This beer is big, bold, and complex. Potentially one of the best beers I've ever drank, it's nearly perfect. Enjoy it before a meal when your palate is still fresh so you can truly appreciate its complexity. A beautiful beer indeed, highly recommended.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Pretty good looking brew.  Brew smells chocolaty, dark chocolates. Malty; caramel, some hops in there as well. Has a bready nose in there also. Near coffee like. Maybe dark fruits as well. Has a good smell.  Brew is slightly carbonated and spicy on the tongue initially, then a creamy smooth taste and feel takes over. Dark chocolates, coffee, roasted malts, caramel. A bit of a hop bite as well. Near smoky almost. Can taste a hint of that bready/yeasty flavor as well. Finishes slightly dry, thicker bodied feel. Very good taste.  This is a style of brew that I haven't had much experience with. I definitely like this brew a lot. Has great easy drinkability that would make it an excellent session brew. However I guess I was expecting more, like in a world class kind of way. Again, I haven't had many of the style so maybe I need to research (get drinkin') and come back to it.

It pours a lovely brown, complete with garnet highlights, topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises dark wheat, rye bread, pumpernickel, brown sugar, and nutmeg. The taste holds notes of caramel, cinnamon, rye bread, dark wheat, light molasses, and a touch of maple syrup. The maltiness is off the charts, in a very good way. The body is a hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a sickeningly smooth feel.

The chocolate and coffee flavors that you can smell mix with something like molasses that leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste in your mouth that reminds you of the awesome sip you just had.

Wonderful balance of molasses, cream, and apples, along with a bit of smoky/fizzy carbonation at the finish.  M: A bit thin for my liking, but with an excellent level of carbonation.

S: I smell chocolate, bread, and some interesting sweet spice aromas rising out of the glass. There is a very dry, grainy smell accompanied by some plum and fig hints.  T: I don't know what it is about bock beers, but I get a very salty taste from all of them. If the taste of this beer perfectly matched the aroma, I would be over the moon. But the salt taste overpowers the chocolate flavor that is present and leaves a sodium residue in my mouth. That being said, there is a decent balance between sweetness and dryness in this beer, and it has a nice, crisp, clean taste to it.  M: Relatively full and coating at the beginning of the sip, and then a puckering saltiness/dryness takes over the feel on my palate. Crisp.

Raisin and grape hit first. This gives way as some roastiness takes over. The roastiness lingers, the sweet grape comes back for a second, before a long biscuity malty finish with a hint of lightly roasted grain. Dark breads kind of fill out the flavor from start to finish, and become most noticable in the aftertaste. Finishes a little sweet. As it warms, more dark fruits come out.

About a finger of tan colored head is achieved with a moderate pour, which dissipates quickly leaving little lacing.  Smell - Dark fruits, caramel, malts, light chocolate, and bread.  Taste - Dark fruits in the nose are prevalent in the taste. Prunes, raisins, and dark cherries. Dark, roasted (though not overly) malts make an appearance with a strong caramel presence. The more it warms the more the flavors begin to develop.  Mouthfeel - Quite thick and creamy overall, for appearing to be nothing of the sort from the initial pour. Light carbonation.  Drinkability - A very drinkable and tasty beer. I enjoy a good doppelbock and am surprised I have not tried this sooner. A very good beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Mora2000,4.3,"The beer pours a hazy dark brown color with a nice tan head. The aroma is toffee, chocolate malt and some bread. The flavor is more complex with some dark fruit and roasted malt early in the taste and then chocolate and coffee later. Medium, slightly watery mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

39,131,charlesbyrd,4.26,"Poured from a dark brown bottle (11.2 oz. I believe?) into a tall tulip glass. The label is great, gotta love the little plastic ram.  A: Pours a clean dark brown, almost opaque, with glimmers of ruby shining through when held to the light. Very clean, this is obviously a high quality brew. Poured vigorously, it will give up a nice beige head, but it didn't stick around for long.  S: Honestly, I didn't get much of an aroma from this one. There is a faint toasted bread smell coupled with that of roasted malt, but it's all very light.  T: The taste is everything I picked up from the aroma, simply magnified. At the front, I get sweet bread and cinnamon at the front, followed by a roasted malty flavor that reminds me of a good stout. The long finish has a coffee bitterness to it.  M: This is a very full-bodied beer, but it goes down really smoothly. The thick, oily texture goes well with slight prickles from the moderate carbonation, and the flavors are able to stick to the taste buds for quite some time. The ABV is on the low end of the range for this style, so there's not much of a warming sensation.  D: This is a very impressive example of a dopplebock. Rich and full-bodied, this beer has everything I could want on a cold or rainy day. Still, I think it's drinkable enough to suit any palate (even those who are turned off by ""dark beers""). A supreme standard of quality shows through in the appearance, taste, and finish of this beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,alkemy,4.2,"Pours a dark ruby brown with a tan head that quickly fades to a light covering. There are plums and tart cherries intermingling with sweet and sugary dark bread on the nose. It has a rich bready taste that reminds me a little of zucchini bread, except with dark fruit overtones...kind of roasty tart cherry and plum tastes. It's sweet, but then fades into a bitter chocolate/coffee taste that really lingers. I remember having this years ago and finding it overtly sweet...my how the palate has changed. I really like this.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,revdrkevind,4.28,"s- Bottle. I'm partial to collecting the little plastic rams.  a- Pours the sort of deep/black amber that I love, with a nice off-white head that laces well. Certainly a pretty pour.  s- Above-average, but so complex that it's hard to pin down, a common theme with this beer. Deep brown sugar and bread and fruit. It's a nice puzzle for the nose.  t- On first sip, I equally love and hate it, as it's so absurdly complex that I don't know what to make of it. There's a lovely burnt caramel malt, but it's bold to the point of overpowering. There's currents of chocolate and fruit vegetable and nut, and it's hard to tell if they add or distract. This is the hardest-to-describe beer I've ever encountered, and I like it. Overall, you mostly feel the bitter malt, with the hoppiness buried under the other rich flavors. I'd almost give this beer a perfect rating if I could just make up my mind about it.  m- A great medium feel with some cream. Carbonation is just right so it feels smooth and refreshing.  d- This is a perfect sipping beer as I always want to let it linger and think it over, and it's highly drinkable. I just can't imagine some pounding bottle after bottle of this stuff- I think I'd be mentally scarred exposing myself to that much complexity.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Poured a deep red mahogany color with a thick tan head on top that departed fairly quickly. Good Lacing.  Dark sugar smell upfront, similar to molasses. Also, Some sweet, fruity bread aroma. There was a pleasant black licorice scent through out as well.  The smokiness and malts hit you first, followed by a very nice caramel sweetness. The dark fruits, cherries and prunes I think, really hit the back of the palate.  Light/medium carbonation, thin and light body.

Head clings well to glass and is very fine, very well brewed.  S- Great smelling with many different aromas. There are several fruity smells that are immediately noticable and there appears to be some chocolate beneath that. One of the most pungent beers out there  T- There is a deep smooth taste with the same fruity undertones of the malts that are in the smell. Definitely something chocolate like at work. There is not too much hops taste, the malts seem to overtake it.  MF- Lightly carbonated that holds well throughout drinking. It feels very fine, with all of the flavors very well mixed. Feels great.  D- One of my favorite beers I've tasted ever. It is one you will want to savor throughout drinking. I haven't paired it with food but will definitely try to do so.

39,131,Thiestru,4.5,"Poured from an 11.2-oz. bottle into my Terrapin pint glass.  Appearance: Very dark brownish-red. One-finger off-white head at first, but it doesn't last long. Minimal lacing.  Smell: Very interesting. My first thought was 'malty V8 juice'! Whether that's good or bad depends on your opinion of V8 juice, I suppose; I happen to like it. I wish I could describe the smell better than that, but I'm afraid I can't.  Taste: Wow! Oh, but this is good. There's a certain vegetable-ish taste deep down in there, but the star of this beer is the malt. They taste something beyond 'roasted' - I'd call it 'burnt'! If that sounds bad, trust me, it isn't. It's great. Actually, this reminds me a bit of a rauchbier, but not as over-the-top smokey. Any hops in this beer lurk far below the malts; maybe that's what's imparting that vegetable taste. Damn, this is hard to describe. 'Outstanding' ought to do.  Mouthfeel: Neither very thick nor very thin. Carbonation is enough to give it a crisp feel.  Drinkability: From experience, I can tell you that drinkability is very high. Making whole nights of this is easy, but this is such a special beer that it's probably better to only have one or two every month or two. Or maybe once a week. Hell, drink up!  This is kind of a strange beer, but it's thoroughly fantastic. Get it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Leaves some light lacing on the glass; looks perfect.  s - Smells of dark sticky sweet fruits, some sweet malts, roasted malts, and caramel malts. Very enjoyable.  t - Tastes of smooth roasted and caramel malts, as well as sweet and dark fruits.  m - Medium body and light carbonation, very smooth and easy to drink. Perfect feel to it.  d - Overall I thought this was a great beer and an amazing doppelbock. It had a great feel to it and was very easy to drink; I felt like I could drink a lot of these.

The aroma is nice. Dark fruits and dark malts combine in a good fashion. I am also getting hints of banana and grapes.  A mild sweetness drives this beer with a solid malt backbone. The carbonation does not distract from what the beer is giving. Sweet raisins and chocolate malts come through in addition to everything that I was smelling.  As I mentioned above, the carbonation is gentle which helps provide a medium mouthfeel. There is some coffee like aftertaste...the best way I can describe the subtle bitterness. There is some mild stickiness with a slight drying.  This is very drinkable for a doppelbock. The maltiness is a bit much for my taste, but the style is nailed with this one.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smell: sweet, bready malt aroma with a rich fruitiness: pears, cherries, figs; I'm also detecting what might be hints of creamy chocolate, though very light. Quite nice indeed.  Taste: the flavor tracks along the same lines as the aroma. The only drawback here is that it is a little light in intensity; the composition of the flavor is very tasty, however. Toward the end there is the hint of vegetabley hops.  Mouthfeel: medium body with a great carbonation which is integrated well and yields a fantastic creaminess. Love it.  Drinkability: though the flavor has a couple drawbacks in my opinion, I very much like the overall composition. The aroma is fantastic and the mouthfeel is just grand.

Firm walnut head that fades quickly with minimal lace. The blackness of the color almost worried me. Darker than any German beer I have ever seen before.  Typical darkly roasted malt elements. Dark fruits come off most prominently. Rich prune with a strong coffee aroma and minor cocoa hints. The aroma is very rich and full bodied. The aroma alone will pull me back to this beer again and again.  The dark fruits that were present on the nose take a backseat in the taste, and the coffee and sugar/malt really come through. The taste is strong of caramel, but not sugary, and incredibly well balanced. Subtle hints of tobacco.  Velvety with a bite. Relatively minor carbonation, but present acidity. Smooth to consume with a long drawn out finish.  Overall a truly fantastic brew. The sweet, rich fruits of the smell combine with the rich roasted elements in the taste to make something very special.

T: The taste is very malty and balanced--dark malts dominate the flavors yet there are subtle hints of caramel, chocolate and nuts. There is a bit of sweetness in the initial taste and some dryness in the finish. M: It feels medium- to full-bodied and both smooth and thick on the palate.

39,131,afausser,4.17,"Thrown in as an extra from davolebomb on his homebrew trade--many thanks to an extremely generous trader!  Appearance: Pours an extremely dark cherry and plum toned brown (more of a toffee color when swirled around in the glass), with a thin layer of creamhy head that has the consistency of (and disappears the same way as) soda carbonation. Tiny and slow moving carbonation bubbles are barely visable here and there floating to the surface. Pretty enough, but nothing special.  Smell: Smells delicious, with lots of toffee and caramel notes, as well as some dark fruits, particulary prunes and raisins. Some bread notes are thrown in there. Smells a lot stronger as it warms, with some grape, red wine, and slightly sour and funky notes.  Taste: Somewhat similar to the smell, though not nearly as sweet. The hops come across as a sort of coffee note. Barely any caramel or candy toffee here, though there are some dark fruits. Slight alcohol is evident. Slight burnt toast are also present, and maybe a slight hint of toffee in the background. A bit of cream and chocolate tones, but these are very subtle. As it warms the burnt notes come out a bit more, as do the bitter hops. Also gets sweeter as it warms, with slight brown sugar notes (as well as sugar syrup in general) that quite soon are overwhelmed by bitter hops in the taste and aftertaste. Also an interesting wintergreen note that interacts somewhat strangely with the burnt toast.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is decent. Low but voluminous carbonation really lifts the heavier flavors to the top of the palate. Not abrasive and goes down pretty smoothly for a medium bodied beer.  Drinkability: Drinkability on this one is right in the middle--it's not sessionable, really, but it's not extremely hot for its style. Worth trying, but I don't know if I'd pursue this one again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,SpeedwayJim,4.72,"Poured from a 11.2oz. bottle into a Harpoon pilsner glass.  A: Moderate pour yields a downward cascading 2.5 finger semi-fine brownish-cream head with respectable retention. Beer is a dark, near opaque purplish-brown. Lacing is stringy and sptty and never strays far from the head.  S: Caramel, coffee, toasted toffee, signature European malt mintiness, slight sourness and cream. Overall aroma is very cakey and doughy. Pungent, yet subdued and subtle at the same time.  T: Brown sugar, caramel, toffee sweetness. Sweet coffee and cream linger in the background. Spicy at points that constantly tickles the back of the throat. Very chewy in the middle and even a little bit fruity. Burnt plums? Coffee comes back around for another go at the end. Slightly roasty characteristic this time though with the same accompanying sweetness. Finish is messy with a lingering roasted malt sourness that gets sweeter just as it disappears from the tongue.  M: Medium bodied and smooth as all hell. At 6.7% this is by no means a strong beer but it might as well be 3%. Alcohol is non-existent. Carbonation is there but at just the right amount it excites the palate while not interrupting the silky feel. Finish is messy but leaves such a delectable taste on the palate, I don't mind.  D: I thought I knew what a doppelback tasted... and then I had this. An astounding beer by every measure, this is probably one of the most sessionable beers for every season. Warming when its cold and quenching when its hot, there's no time when this wouldn't be enjoyable. A fantastic brew!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Didn't know what to expect but after having to hold myself back from drinking this too fast, I can say that this is one better beers I've had in quite some time. Based on the other reviews that I've seen on here, I think that most people would agree with me!  This poured a nice, dark brown with ruby edges to the hue as I held my glass up to the light. This had a nice head as well and a bit of lacing but then comes the mouthfeel...very nicely balanced and almost no sign of any alcohol in the taste. Lots of molasses, dark fruit (I'm feeling fig for some reason), licorice, coffee, and caramel. It blends together wonderfully with just a hint of roasted stickiness in the aftertaste. Certainly not a hopheads delight but it's not so full that the malt dominates with a biscuit-like overtone. One of the better balances in a beer that I've enjoyed lately!  I could see myself having a few of these with the alcohol sneaking up on me. Although I prefer regular Bocks because they're lighter, this is a great choice for spring and for those unaccustomed to the style (such as yours truly).

Toasted bread and a huge chewy malt mashes with tart dry fruits. Light molasses and spices linger in the background. The finish is sweet and succulent.  Mouthfeel: It has a wonderfully smooth, creamy and palpable consistency. The modest carbonations breaks free towards the end of each sip to punctuate the residual brown sugar sweetness.  Drinkability: The second I put the cup to my mouth I knew I was going to love drinking it. It's so full of flavor -- strong and complex but accessible. The consistency is close to perfect for a double bock.  Notes: I was skeptical at first given all the hype, now I'm confident this is a world class brew. The best part?

Smell was rather complex, with a fortitude of malts and fruitiness and spiciness coming to the front. The taste kind of surprised me as well. Very mellow and earthy, hints of leafy and dark malts. Quite bitter on the end, pronounced hop detail that can only lead to another drink. The only thing not 'good' about this beer was the odd bitterness, for some reason it did not sit well with me, but the drinkability remained good.

Aroma: Smoky, cheesy, wet chocolaty malt. Different and intense, but typical of darker offerings from this outstanding brewery.  Taste: As in the aroma: smokiness, cheese, wet chocolate malts, but also with a good vinous character and a christmasy spiced flavour, cinnamon and perhaps nutmeg or allspice, with a delicate treacle and honey sweetness. All of this balanced with just a touch of hop, enough to round it out but to keep this essentially a malt bomb. Absolutely delightful. 6.7% abv is not particularly noticeable.

Looks brownish black until held up to light. Tan head rose two fingers before settling into a ring and some wispy bubbles. Lacing is fine and light, and clustered together-- doesn't make rings around the glass.  Roasted malts. Smells sweet, like brown sugar and some kind if hard candy I can't quite place... Almost like those old root beer barrels!  Taste has a coffee like bitterness on the back end after starting out sweet and slightly fruity?. Not quite as toasty as I expected from the smell-- but certainly tasting those malts. A little dry too. Can certainly notice that yeast as well!  Very nice body-- on the fuller side of medium, but not chewy. Plenty of carbonation helps this be smooth, until the very last moment, it then feels just slightly syrupy.  This is one of the easiest drinking 7%ers out there!! Even my wife wanted another sip! Very tasty and drinkable brew here that I would not mind having again.

Nice foamy head that reduces to a thin layer of suds.  In the nose I get sweet malts and confections, and I can detect the alcohol. Has a very robust smell.  Taste is a sort of burnt bitter, or roasted malt with an almost medicinal taste. it seems to have some sourness to it as well. A bit one-dimensional, in my opinion.  in the mouth it feels somewhat thin and sticky, though it is medium bodied with high carbonation.  It's fairly drinkable but 1 or 2 would probably be enough for me, but it's obviously not a session brew. It would probably be a long while before I would decide to get this again.

Appearance: Poured a 1/2"" thick light brown foam that died down to a thin layer across the top of the beer. Plenty of lacing as I drank it down. The color on the table is a deep mahogany brown, but held up to the light is a deep garnet red. Plenty of carbonation coming up through the dark liquid as you hold it up to the light.  Smell: Sweet, but not overpoweringly so. Reminds me of the smell upon opening up a box of dark chocolate covered raisins. The raisin is the main smell, but there are chocolate and bready notes in there too. Very nice.  Taste: Caramel malt, the raisin fruitiness, bittersweet chocolate all rolled into one. A nice balanced bitter finish and some lingering bittersweet chocolate aftertaste. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel: Sticky and a little chewy, with just enough carbonation on the tongue to be noticeable. Again, very nice adds to the overall richness (but never excessive) of this beer.  Drinkability: My only problem with this beer is that the 12oz bottle is too damn small, I really want more to enjoy.

This feels flat and unimpressive. The flavors are malty in character. Some roasted malts at the onset, but then this gives way to a dark fruity flavor, and finishes with some alcohol heat.

39,131,Flashsp2,4.5,"Celebrator into Stone IRS tulip  Pours with a nice one finger tan head on a deep brown/mahogany body. Head dissipates quickly, and leaves no lace in its wake. A quick swirl leaves some nice webbing.  Aroma is a meaty dark malt, stewed prune, powdered cocoa (Nestle), light roast coffee, dark caramels. This is the imperial stout of lagers.  Too cold and this beer is very muted. In typical Bavarian style, this needs to be consumed closer to room temperature. At proper temps the flavors shine through; dark malt chewiness, breakfast blend coffee, molasses, a light touch of dark fruits.  Chewy with lots of residuals left, definitely not a dry doppelbock. Carbonation is restrained, but provides enough gusto to move the beer across the entire expanse of the palette before the moderately long finish.  Easy drinking, not too high of an ABV, but the price point is a bit stiff. That said, a price tag this high is warranted in a beer of this quality.

No freshness date.  Appearance: Thick, creamy tan head that subsides to a good lace and sticks pretty well. Dark, almost black body that tints red through the light.  Smell: Dark sugar smell upfront, similar to molasses. Some sweet, fruity bread aroma as well. Hint of some hops hiding amongst that bready smell.  Taste: A little sweet at the start, with some bread and molasses qualities. Some kind of mild fruity taste that accompanies the sweetness as well, raisins maybe, or perhaps figs. Becoming astringent from roasted malts and hops and finishing with a little hop bitterness that complements and reinforces the mild bitterness from the roasted malt.  Mouthfeel: Nice and smooth, but pretty thick. This is definitely no light beer.  Notes: Great brew, a little complex but also accessible and really likable. Tasty.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,FishGetter,4.37,"Dark nut brown color, able to see through when held up to light. Thin frothy mocha head. Nice toasted nut aroma. Rasin, fig, and heavy toasted malts. Some canndied fruit. Complex nose but not confussing. Great ballance. Rasin, figs, and canndied fruit all blend up front. Toasted grains show up midway with a mild nut flavor. Finishes with mild coffee and chocolate flavor. Big variety of flavors, all represented evenly. Very mild bitter finish. Great meduim to an aggitated heavy mouthfeel. Mostly clean finish. Great complexity in this offering. All flavors seem to be distinct and not mudded together. Well deserving of a top 100 brew.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,abrand,4.3,"11.2 ounce bottle poured into a pils glass. My first time trying this classic brew.  The Celebrator pours a deep amber/brown color with a 1 finger whitish color head and good retention on the glass. Aromas are caramel malts up front with a semi hoppy finish. Quaff is similar to the nose with caramel malts dominated. Also hints of grapes, raisins, and toffee. The quaff starts sweet then has a bitter phase with a sweet, fruity finish. A great tasting bock. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and medium bodied. Drinkability is solid. I would be interested in what a year would do to this beer but it is great fresh nonetheless.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ThaBobfather,4.28,"Pours a dark brown with a touch of ruby . Well retained lacing of whitish/off tan head. Smell has lots of sweet malt- notes of caramel, molasses and dark fruit pits Taste starts with caramel and dark cherries, it does then to a more wholesome malt character with notes of bitter and a slight hazel. Nicely complex. Finish is wet and creamy with a thick malt and sweet dark candy after-taste. Drinks very well here- smooth and malty with a very small bite here- nearly sessionable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,RomaniIteDomum,4.23,"This one pours a nice dark mahogany with decent head retention.  Smells mainly of caramel and sweet malts. A little lacking, but still quite nice.  The taste on this one is much more rich than the smell. Grains, malts, and some more caramel are hanging around. Even though I know this one has been hanging around the store for a while it still tastes like fresh grains.  The mouthfeel is quite creamy. Very nice.  Pretty drinkable. This would pair nicely with some German food.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ChrisPro,4.12,"On tap at Winking Lizard. It starts with the amazing aroma that smells of chocolate with slight floral hints. The head is fantastic as it pours a nice dark brown. Tastes incredibly balanced with a bit of sweetness, but the highlight is how smooth it goes down and the incredible finish. May be the best beer I've ever had.  Re-rated on 6/1/09: from Taphouse Grille in Bellevue.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Very smooth in the mouth, only a touch of heat from the alcohol in the finish.  This is really easy to drink.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,SeasonalBrew,4.47,"A: Pours a deep, dark brown with a nice one finger tan head. The head has good retention and forms decent lacing.  S: Very warm, toasty malts. Sweet molasses and caramel as well as dark fruit are very prevalent.  T: Not as much of a forward and strong taste as I was expecting. The smokiness and malts hit you first, followed by a very nice caramel sweetness. The dark fruits, cherries and figs I think, really hit you as you swallow. Even though the taste wasn't as strong as I expected from the nose, it is very well balanced and tasty.  M: Well carbonated and very smooth. Slightly thicker body, almost chewy in feel. Very enjoyable.  D: Excellent. I really enjoyed this beer and could definitely have a few with hesitating.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Musition12,4.4,"Purchased a 4-pack from City Beer Store in San Francisco. Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  A: Pours a very dark brown with hints of ruby peaking through the edges of the glass when viewed in light. 1-finger head with solid retention and spotty lacing. Small, compact bubbles in head.  S: Lots of malt. Molasses, caramel, smoke, nuts, and dark fruits. Anticipating a malt bomb.  T: At the outset, while the beer was still quite cool, it was just that: a malt monster. Creamy caramel and dark cherries. Chocolate and hazelnuts. Smokey malts and dried figs. As the brew warms, other flavors begin to show themselves. Hops begin to make their presence known with a slight twang in the finish. A very modest sharpness from both the alcohol and the hops really help in balancing an otherwise malt-heavy bruiser of a beer. This results in a remarkably complex (and delicious) flavor profile especially for this style.  M: Very light carbonation and a thick, chewy mouthfeel. Delicate alcohol warmth. Absolutely lovely.  D: At only 6.7%, this is definitely a sessionable brew in my book. I could imagine downing all four of these in quick succession. I'll probably grab another one after this.  I've never been big on doppelbocks. For me, they tend to be cloying malt messes or alcohol-dominated disasters. Not this one. This is probably the best doppelbock I've ever had and definitely lives up to its claim as ""the finest Bavarian double bock beer."" Amen.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,hawks10,4.13,"11.2oz bottle poured into my Ayinger Celebrator glass...  Pours a rich dark brown with a two finger, soft, tightly formed tan head which leaves a haze on top of the beer for the duration. When held up to the light, this beer becomes a translucent dark ruby/mahogany color, very nice...  Loads of sweet dark fruits on the nose, malt bomb. Sweet bready caramel malt, tons of ripe dark fruits a little bit of smoke and some subtle earthy hops...  Hmmm, not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be, given the nose. A somewhat smoky taste at first, more hop presence than expected. After the beer warms a bit I get more of the sweet malt, ripe dark fruits and caramel flavor in the taste...makes for a very balanced brew, thought I was in for a totally one sided malt bomb when I smelled this beer, I was wrong...again...  Very smooth and slick, medium bodied and somewhat chewy. A little light on the carbonation and a tiny bit of alcohol warmth...

S: Dark molasses bread, dates, and cloves.  T: Dark cane syrup, toasted wheat bread, roasted malts, and sweet aftertaste. There is a mild smoke flavor too. Very complex and nice.  M: Smooth and thick, but not cloying at all. Warming as it goes down.  D: You would never guess that this has the alcohol that it does. It's incredibly drinkable.

39,131,elgiacomo,4.17,"12oz bottle. Pours brown, medium body, with a two finger light brown head. Maintains only a small cap and doesn't leave but a few spots of lacing.  Aroma is raisin and other dark fruits, malty, bready, toffee, caramel, a little chocolate and some alcohol. Rich and fairly complex aroma.  Flavor is malty, chocolate, toffee, caramel, dark fruits, some alcohol. Slightly sweet, but finishes rather dry.  Body felt thin, low carbonation.  Only my second doppelbock, but this was far superior to the cloyingly sweet Samuel Adams Double Bock that originally frightened me from the style. Sweetness is kept in check and balanced nicely with the Celebrator.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BeanBone,4,"Appearance: An exceedingly dark brown body capped by about two fingers of creamy, tan-tinged head that leave only a few bare patches of lacing.  Aroma: Dark fruit and smoke over rich, earthy, and sweet caramel malt.  Flavor: Smokiness, mild coffee, and dark fruit over a toasty, earthy, and burnt sugar-like malt backbone. Lightly bitter hops keep everything decently balanced. No sign of the moderately-high alcohol content. Cereal grains, dark fruit, and herbal hops in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and creamy with smooth medium carbonation. Dries in the finish.  Drinkability: Easily quaffable, this is remarkably sessionable.  Verdict: Complex and tasty, yet highly drinkable, Celebrator is a brilliant example of the Doppelbock style. Not big and boozy like others in this style, this is a more fine tuned and subtle approach.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Appearance: The body has a very dark brown color in the glass and when held up to light it has nice garnet highlights. Some small bubbles of carbonation can be seen in the highlights and near the edges of the glass. On top sits a tight head of light brown foam which slowly settles down to small cap that hangs on till the last sip. Lacing is slick and slides right down the glass as I drink.  Smell: In the nose I get notes of sweet caramel, fresh sweet bread, ripe fruit and a kiss of German hops.  Taste/Palate: The flavor has a sweet overall character with moderate hoping that comes through in the end to finish things up without becoming too sweet or cloying. Up front are the caramel candy, brown sugar, light molasses and brown pear like fruit notes. Towards the finish bready notes become more toasted and mix with some light hop flavors to temper the overall sweetness. The finish is short and still on the sweet side but in a good way. Carbonation is lively enough to lift the palate of the solid, smooth, and full body and leave you wanting that next sip.  Notes: All I need to say here is outstanding!!!

The moderately high carbonation levels send out an aroma of light grainy malt with gentle hints of dark fruits. The aroma is echoed in the drink with a sweet malty flavor supported by delicious dark fruits and subtle alcohol warmth. The body is light and allows the tastes to flow quickly throughout the palate. The finish is light and quick as the sweet malty brew fades into a crisp clean lager end.

The body is an orange/reddish color with excellent legs as I tilt the glass.  Aromas are an intense combination of caramel, ice cream, toffee, and baked apple pie. Exhibits a similar bouquet as a Belgian ale such as a Trappist dubbel or quad.  Malty yet delicious flavors that include toffee, caramel, syrup (maple of the Canadian variety), and some candy. That may sound too sweet to many, but trust me, all of the flavors balance out VERY WELL. Yum nommy noms.  The mouthfeel is syrupy (like the taste) yet crisp (also like the taste). An overall medium-strength consistency that borders on the heavy side as I swish it on the palate.  Overall, this one is a classic and for very good reason. Most people here in the states will be popping their Doppelbock cherry with Ayinger's Doppelbock, including myself, and that is no bad thing. If there were an ale I would compare it with, the Okahom's Baltic Porter is the closest in taste and aromas.

Big flavors or very well done toast on the cusp of burnt but without being roasty. It moves a dark fruity sweetness; plums and prunes come to mind.

Nice bite on the tongue that was gone quickly after going down. I could taste the alchohol somewhat, especially after the beer warmed up. Mellow, fluid mouthfeel. Not too thick.

Raisons, plums, and even got a slight cherry taste out of this brew. Pretty complex. Slight alcohol taste comes out as it warms but not to much, the sweetness dominates.  M- Medium body with pretty low carbonation makes this brew extremely drinkable leaving a Barely dry finish.  Overall this is a great doppelbock, and hell it was the first DB recipe according to the bottle. Really cool to be able to taste the first DB recipe.

The smell is similar of a sweet good quality chocolate. it isn't roasty but a heavy sweet chocolate smell. There was some darker fruit tones behind the chocolate like raisin and cherry. It's really quite nice.  A nice low roasted chocolate pairs with a malt sweetness. It seems to be a fairly simple one dimensional flavor profile to me but it does it really well. It ends crisp and some alcohol can be tasted on the back end.  The body is think and carbonation on the low side which makes it very drinkable in my opinion.

Smells sweet. Like roasted caramel. Also smells like it's got a lot of figs a raisins and dark sticky fruits of that nature. A small amount of hops on the nose but this isn't supposed to be a hop driven beer.  Taste is mostly raisin. A small amount of fig but this definitely tastes like raisins and prunes.  Mouthfeel is light. This is a lager afterall. But theres enough there to grab onto. Somewhat creamy but really smooth.  This is a very easy to drink beer. Great flavors.

It is mostly raisin on the nose, almost exclusively, with some caramel. There is just something weird about it.  It tastes doppelbock enough, and it is pretty awesome. There are hints of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, dark fruits, and an interesting yeast kick. It is pretty sweet.  The mouthfeel is pretty good although the drinkability could be higher.

39,131,jjanega08,4.68,A= pours a deep deep rich amber color. I say amber because when held up to the light it is a deep amberish red color however when in the glass and not to the light it's just black looking. There is a nice two finger head coming out of it that I didn't expect to show up for some reason but it is there and it falls to a thiner one finger and stays there nice and dense. Great lacing as well.  S= pungent. I can smell it from a ways away which I havent been able to do with some of my more recent beers so that's a plus. When I stick my nose in there I get a lot of aroma. Nice sweetness to it. Smells almost like some delicious cookies. Good chocolate and roasty notes. Not so much coffee notes in this one which I usually expect from a beer of this color. Really a nice sweet smell. It may seem odd but it smells lagered. I dunno what it is but it has a nice crisp distinct lager smell.  T= Ta ta ta tasty tasty. Smells very similar to the smell. Almost to the tea. Upfront of the tip of the tongue it matches the smell word for word. As it passes along the tongue I get more bready doughyness from it that is just great. The finish is nice and bready with lingering roasty chocolaty taste on your tongue making this a beer you can nurse for a while and just enjoy without having to go back to much  M= Smooth and clean. Really sort of light I guess. The mouthfeel isn't my best evale area but I like this one.  D= As I mentioned before this beer has a lasting flavor so you don't have to chug a ton of them down however if you wanted the alcohol is a little lower so you could have a few... I wouldn't get too carried away though. This beer has great flavor and nose with a lasting complex mouth on it. I can see why it's among the highest rated in it's class.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,punkrkr27,3.93,"Pours a dark brown with a nice ruby highlight. 1 finger, quickly diminishing tan head. Aroma is warm molasses, orange and smoky malts. Sweet brown sugar & molasses flavor with figs and other dark fruit fading to a smoky roasted hop bitterness. Nice medium to full body.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Dawkfan,4.47,"A - Pours a dark brown, tinges of red noticeable when held up to a light. 1 finger of light tan head that doesn't last very long. A thin skim of foam remains on top.  S- Nice aroma of sweet toasted malts, caramel, toffee, burnt sugars, and molasses. There's an underlying smell of chocolate as well. Let this one warm up, the aromas really start to come out.  T- This is just as complex as the nose. Toasted caramel malts, and molasses up front, the sweetness starts to fade to a coffee and hop biterness in the end. Like the nose, I get a chocoalte presence throughout.  M- Thick and chewy, leaves a bit of stickiness behind. Nice and smooth, the carbonation stops this from becoming to heavy.  D- This is the standard for Doppelbocks as far as I'm concerned. A very complex and flavorful brew that I'd enjoy any time any place.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,fff,4.42,"Poured into a goblet.  A- Deep amber color, thin, dissipating head. A pretty color, but nothing too impressive here.  S- Sweet, alcoholic taste. Malty sweet smell. Very good smelling brew.  T- In a word, amazing. Rich malts collide with boozy, alcoholic sweetness in a rich tasting brew with complexity to spare. Toffee notes in aftertaste, with some other flavor that reminds me of truffles, but I can't quite figure it out.  M- Warming, stick-sweet beer that is a little syrupy, but not sickness inducing.  D- Not a beer I'd drink a lot of in a night as the sweetness (and abv) could make one sick.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,mostpoetsdo,3.95,"A: Pours a berry colored brownish red, with a great thick head, leaving behind great lacing.  S: Dark fruit, and caramel, malt.  T: Just as the nose leads on, sweet fruit up front. It is backed with a sweet malt flavor.  M: Medium body, but maybe thinner than I expected. Slight creaminess to it.  D: Great taste, low ABV, easy to drink.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,MrDanno96,4.01,"A: Pours a very dark brown color - almost black wit just a touch of light getting in. A thin ring of off-white head circles the glass, but sticks around for most of the drink. Looks very manly (if that's possible for a beer). Nice.  S: Lots of roasted malts meet the nose along with notes of caramel and dark fruit. A little more subdued than I expected. As the brew warms the dark fruits become a little more apparent.  T: Similar to the nose, but better. Plum, raisin, hints of caramel, and roasted malt all hit the palate initially. There is some brewed coffee flavor to go along with some bitterness in the finish. As with the nose, the dark fruits become more prominent as the beer warms. Some hints of what I think are anise and alcohol surface as well. Fairly complex and flavorful overall.  M: A thick and fully body, boarding on chewy, with a medium amount of carbonation. I would expect nothing less from a dopplebock.  D: Obviously this is a great example of the style. I wasn't as impressed as I hoped I would be, but it's a solid drinking brew nonetheless. A high degree of complexity combined with the well hidden abv give this one a high drinkability rating.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,atremains,4.53,"Pours a dark dark redish brown. Glorious light mocha head, its one of the fluffiest, frothiest head I've seen and the retention/lacing are amazing. Smell is great, molasses, caramel, malts, dark sweet fruits. Taste is great as well, all of the above with a bit of nutty character. Resembles a wheaty breadcrust flavor at times. Sweet fruits coat the tongue and the malt helps to balance the lingering deliciousness of this beer. Mouthfeel is medium. This was one of the first beers that really got me into craft beer, and a good one at that. A nice treat.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,MbpBugeye,4.75,"Wow. This was one of my first segways into good beer. Back then I didnt know what was going on. Now that I am a bit more seasoned I'll give this great beer a review.  A- Deep mahogany reddish brown. Even in my slender New Glarus pilsner glass light barely passes through this one. A nearly coffee colored head rises up high, sticks around for a decent amount of time but fades by the time I take a sip. There is decent lacing left behind.  S- MMM... Toasted bread crust, raisins, faint soy and an ever so delicate hopping. This smells like a liquid meal.  T- Wow-wee. I forgot what a treat this beer really is. Sweet candied and dried fruits. A faint spiciness, some soy sauce and residual sugars. This stuff is goood!  M- Thick, very mildly carbonated. Very smooth. Like liquid bread dough. Slightly heavy on the gut.  D- Ever so warming. But this is not a bad thing, it just brings the sheer size of this big lager together. A real meat and potatoes type of lager.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,sirpenny,4.65,"A. The color is a dark reddish brown. Can see the red when you look at with a light in the background. Head is light tan and fades but does not disappear.  S.

39,131,woosterbill,4.09,"On-tap at Prime 16 into a 3/4 pint glass.  A: Clear, deep ruby body with just a whiff of tan foam that swirls quickly into a thin ring. Nice color, but I want some head.  S: Subdued but highly enticing aroma of sweet fruity malt - raisins stand out.  T: All maltiness. Starts out nutty and toasty, followed by smooth, rich fruits. Dry, woody finish. Excellent.  M: Fairly thick, sticky body with somewhat light, spiky effervescence.  D: Flirts with cloyingness (and is definitely overly sticky after a while), but it's too tasty to put down.  Notes: While I'm not a huge doppelbock fan, this is definitely a world-class example of the style. Highly recommended for maltheads everywhere. Good stuff.  Cheers!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,crhensel,4.23,"(Bottle into mug) Poured a smooth dark brown with a half finger lighter brown head. The sweet malts dominated the nose, with a nice aroma of a cooked caramel with another strong sweetness that I just couldn't quite place. It is very rich in the mouth, as advertised, with a smooth carbonation that helped pull out some of the roast in the malt, enhancing the sweetness there. Be wary, as the alcohol was not really there, but at almost 7% it could smack you after a few. Finished with the same smoothness, carrying the sweet roast through the end. Highly recommended!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S - Caramel, toffee, and dark dried fruit.  T - Caramel and fruit come through from the nose. Sweet at first but a nice bitter aftertaste that doesn't linger too long. Malts become more prominent as it warms.  M - Medium bodied, not too heavy. Smooth creamy finish with good carbonation.  D - I could drink a few of these, but I may get worn out on the malts. Overall a damn fine beer. I don't drink too many dopplebocks, but of the ones I've tried this is near the top of the list.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,MOB210SA,4.33,"Poured 3 finger dense, solid, creamy tan/mocha head. Slowly deflating but maintaining and pretty awesome looking. Some lacing. Black looking appearance but really a dark brown with ruby red wine highlights.  Lots of chocolate, dark fruit and good amount of malt. For a bock(even doppel), this smells pretty nice.  Really nice chocolate and malty finish. Big on malt and a truly great bock. I couldnt imagine this style being too much greater. Almost Twizzler taste in there.  Great, velvety and smooth. Almost flat soda like mouthfeel, dense  Drinkability, I find this one a lot more enjoyable than the Salvator. Bocks really aren't my preference of beer but this is pretty damn good and enjoyable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S: Plenty of malty goodness with some semi-sweet chocolate. Some hints of figs and raisins.  T: Velvet malts, raisins, with some semi-sweet chocolate.  M: The malts eventually warm the tongue.

39,131,brianjay,4.23,"Hello, beer,you are one beautiful looking brew! A jet black but with some dark red hue around the glass when the light shines through. A creamy head with large bubbles which melts after sitting around a bit. The foam hangs around the glass in cloud-like formations. Put my nose deeply into this one for an aroma of black cherries. On the end of the aroma is a baked bread flavor, no doubt from the malt. When letting this beer sit in the mouth, I am finding more and more flavors come to life. The instant taste is of banana bread, nuts and candy. The fruit flavor (dark cherries, as I mentioned in the aroma) comes out as well. Surprisingly light in the mouth, this goes down with ease. The finish is more and more overtaken by the malt, as I can sense a roasted veggie/baked bread taste.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

T= immaculate, delicious, loads of dark fruity flavor, prune, burnt toffee, mild dry grassy malts, a little hops bitterness but not much. Overall very balanced.  M= toasty sweetness and fruits  D= very drinkable, not high on the ABV% as I would have assumed. Extremely drinkable if it suits your taste.  Plus, the plastic ram hanging on every bottle makes a great holiday tree ornament!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

No lacing. But my experience with most bocks is no lacing.  Smells of toasted sugar and caramel. Nice malty sweetness to the nose.  Taste is wonderful. Nice and malty and sweet with just enough roastyness. Nice caramel taste from the crystal malts.  Mouthfeel is smooth and silky. Perfect carbonation.

39,131,Chico1985,4.55,"**12/9/11 - more notes**  Had this last night for the first time in over a year, what an awesome beer all around. Excellent appearance, great scent and taste, flavors include roasted malt, toffee, dusty chocolate/caramel, dark fruit and dark bread. Exceptionally soft, smooth mouthfeel that reminds me of the lusciousness of beers like Westy 12 and Pannepot. I liked this beer alot before but I have come to appreciate it much more now, has all the traits of a very well made classic beer.  **original review scores - 4.5/4.5/4.5/4/4 11.2 oz bottle, my 3rd out of the 4-pack. Pours a dark brown with a small off-white head resting on top, looks good the whole time and leaves great lacing. Smell is great, lots of caramel and toffee along with some dark fruit maybe. Taste is tons of roasted malts, caramel, cola, maple, and a bit of chocolate. This and the TH Liberator are the only doppelbocks I've had but this definitely beats the Liberator (although that might've been a bad bottle). Mouthfeel and drinkability are good, it's not very thick and it's easy to drink but there are tons of malts here, definitely not something I'd want to drink often or session. A great beer for a special occasion...not that this was a special occasion...",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,FeDUBBELFIST,4.21,"11.2 oz bottle with no date indication. Poured into a chalice.  A: Respectable 2 finger head that is light brown and diminishing, fizzing out completely and leaving behind a very content, dormant looking brew. That was fun to witness. The body is dark, dark mahogany brown and has a very clean 90% opaqueness. No chance of lacing.  S & T: Average malt character. Molasses, caramel, roasted dark chocolate and some smokey grains. The hops are minimal, lightly woody, grassy and herbal. There is a very appropriate yeast bill of leather and peaty earth. The aroma, although very good, was lacking in complexity and intensity. Surprising though is how these two characteristics shifted from passive towards aggressive on the palate. Without adding much complexity, the aromas seem to come out of hibernation and onto the palate, adding licorice, dark berries, red grape and cherry, and thusly becoming more founded in the taste department. Well rounded, humble and fantastic in its own subtle way.  M: I generally feel that any mildly carbonated brew can infringe upon being too syruppy. The Celebrator, while on the lighter side in this regard, is not an exception. Thinner than expected but substantial enough, and maybe lucky enough that the creamy, velvetty quality keeps the mouthfeel pleasant and secure in it's 4 out of 5 rating.  D: Overall this brew drinks really well and any shortcomings I feel the Celebrator had were almost immediately made up for. Suitable for all day drinking.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,irishking1977,4.17,"A: Jet black with a small head and some decent lacing. I was expected a lighter brew with a thicker head. Almost looks like engine oil. Still, not bad though.  S: Lots of malt with a subdued alcohol background. Something odd in the smell, I can't quite place, but it's nothing I've experienced before.  T: Awfully tasty and malty with a subtle lingering bread presence at the finish. I don't think I've had a brew by Ayinger that I have not enjoyed at least a little bit.  M: Decent carbonation and a chalky, bready feel probably due to the massive malty character of this beer.  D: A good, hearty brew that seems to be perfect for the winter. Above average ABV and nice malt presence make this one a good winter warmer. I could enjoy a few of these.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,05Harley,3.76,"No bottle number, it's a mystery..  Purchased @ Tulley's, Wells Maine  Price - $14.00/4-pack  Appearance: Dark burgundy in color. If poured aggressively it reveals a 2 finger off white head. Lacing present on the glass.  Smell: Roasted malts up front with molasses following up the rear. No fruit smell present that I could detect.  Taste: Slight smoke taste with molasses. Hops are begging to come through but not unleashed.  Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy with a dry finish.  Drinkability: Certainly drinkable, but slightly overated in my opinion. Something is missing..  I keep this in stock at the house however it isn't a beer I crave. It has a strong reputation but in my opinion I'll take Andechs Dopplebock Dunkel every day of the week over this.

39,131,CHADMC3,4.38,"A pour down the middle of a traditional pilsner glass generates a massive, deep tan head that cascades through the glass developing a big, sticky lacing to leave when the head dissipates, after it sits atop the chestnut brown body for quite some time.  Big sweet malt aroma, hearty yeast, and possibly caramel. Although there is nothing deeply complex about the aroma, it certainly is appetizing.  The flavor on this beer is excellent, featuring rich toasted malt, fruits which I am having trouble identifying, and a very pleasant, but faint sweetness.  Medium in body and medium to moderate in carbonation and completely smooth on the palate.  This is an impressive beer. This is not a traditional big beer powerhouse style in my opinion, so you are not going to find a lot of complex flavors, but this beer plays the style highlights very well with traditional ingredients that are put together very well for a tasty offering.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Hypersomnia,4.24,"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle.  Aroma is of grape soda, maltiness and some kind of dark bread.  Taste has a hint of the grape soda, maltiness, sweet but not cloying, I keep thinking of prunes, figs, dates and or dried plums also brown sugar and molasses. Surpisingly though even with all this, it's still ""light"". There is a bit of ""spicy"" alcohol in there as well but it helps give a bit of bite to the sweetness, which ends up working well in this beer. This is a great beer.  Finish is not very long which makes this a bit easier drinking than I would have expected. This is not necessarily a negative, the combination of them pulling off a ""light"" but super tasty beverage that doesn't have a extreme lingering finish makes you want to keep taking another sip, if the finish lasted forever this would be too powerful/sweet I think, so this is perfect. This is a perfect winter beer.  Thinking about it some more, I realized that I had Damson Preserve this morning and this tastes quite a bit like that. Yummy! My wife is getting disturbed because I keep sniffing this and going ""Oh God! Mmmm!"" The aroma on this is just amazing.  This is excellent beer, highly recommended.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,OneDropSoup,4.67,"On tap at 6 & Save in New Kensington, PA.  Poured in a Gulden Draak tulip, a dark brown, near black with lots of ruby highlights throughout. Thin wisp of head, mild lacing.  Smell is great: bold caramel & toffee, like a Sugar Daddy. Stand-out.  Taste is greater, as it carries that smell up front, then builds in complexity with a tingue of bitterness midway, combined with slight heat from booze. Finishes the mouthfull with a grape & peach-like fruity tartness, & then steps up again with the caramel & toffee int he aftertaste. Gains a barley-wine like toasty intensity with some warmth. Sweet & very complex, love it!  Mouthfeel start moderate with a little bite to keep it from being a flat dessert drink. Builds & gets creamy.  KA-BOOM! This is awesome. So great to get a flavorful, malty brew that goes through so many movements & is complex enough to stay interesting til the end. My first exposure to this was years ago, was an eye-opening experience at the time, & it's wonderful to see it's held up so well over time. Definitely my favorite representation of the style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

There is a bitterness in the fade that reminds me of toasted caramel. This one sort of reminds me of a semi-stout; and I'm not too fond of that style, as I think they are too bitter. Being my first dopplebock, I can't tell if this (bitterness) is indicative of the style or not.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Light enough to drink but heavy enough to taste great. Perfect!  D: Goes down super easy. Very easy drink.  All in all, this is a very good brew. It has a nice fruit taste with a slight booziness.

Medium body, good carbonation, slightly slick finish.  D - Blahhh. None for me. I really don't like it. You might though.

Smelled of bready malt and caramely sugars with a touch of alcohol.  Taste was great. Big malt bready flavors with dark molasses up front. Finished off with a touch of alcohol that became more noticable as the beer warmed up. A bare touch of hop was noticed in the finish.  Mouthfeel was a big full feeling.

Lingering taste left in the mouth similar to dark fruit. As it warms both the aroma and the taste have a bit of hop character without the bitterness. Only faintly picking up on the alcohol character. Thick chewy feel and moderate carbination but wow is it smooth. I honestly feel bad for waiting this long to try this beer, it really is an awesome doppelbock.

Smells of very strong brown malt, a medium molasses aroma and a very light english hop presence  Taste is very similar to the aroma. This is a medium body brown malt / german flavored doppelbock as advertised. Very good flavor, it is a great doppelbock and a good model for the style. The molasses probably outshines everything but brown malt and a dry finish.

For those who don't usually like dark beers, don't be put off by the appearance here: Celebrator is a relatively medium-bodied, tasty brew that anyone can and should enjoy.

39,131,beerwolf77,4.5,"Thanks to BeerFMAndy for throwing this beer in as an extra on one of our trades.  The beer pours a deep dark brown almost black hue. The mocha head slowly rises to a full two inches and rest for what seems like an eternity. After a slowy recession I'm left with thick lace rings that cling to the glass like spider webs from the Munsters house.  The aroma is rich dark fruit, roasted nuts, coffee, chocolate, toasted bread, and hints of spice. This beer smells fantastic.  The flavor is just as complex as the nose. Roast nuts and chocolate malt blend perfectly with fresh baked bread and coffee. Hints of hops and spice come through after warming a bit.  Full body and very substantial. Rather light carbonation.  Overall an outstanding beer. I'm ashamed I don't drink this one more often. I can see why it stands out in the world of beers.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

After the initial pour, there's still a good amount of head retention and some lacing along the sides of the glass.  S - Sweetness is the main note right away - dark fruits, chocolate, and malts. There's some oak notes in there as well, but truthfully, the sweetness is pretty overwhelming for me.  T - Roasted notes of malts, chocolate, coffee beans are the primary flavors on this beer. It's not as sweet as the nose suggests, which I'm thankful for. There is some sweetness, but the roasted notes really balance this beer out nicely. Slightly bitter finish.  M - Medium to full bodied, lighter carbonation, rich and creamy on the palate. Creamy finish.  D - This beer is perfect if I'm not looking for a huge stout or porter.

Deep stain, like a Belgian dark ale, but without the fruit. Robust, malty, overtone is toffee with bread and toffee. Like a brown without the nut flavor, damn near as thick as a stout. A real cold weather beer that I'd take over almost every porter.  Unusually crisp.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

T- Nutty flavor with molasses sweetness and a good balance of roasted bitterness and hop presence. Can taste the alcohol but only the positive qualities.  M- Creamy and smooth, finishes clean with no aftertaste. Body is full but not heavy.

If this was Seinfeld and this beer sneezed, I'd say ""You are so good lookin'"".  Smell is awesome. Plum, figs, bread crust, caramel, brown sugar - it's all there.  Taste is exceptional. The classic to end the style - german malt, sweet baked bread, prunes, awesome.  Mouthfeel is the best. Classic. Perfect thickness and perfect carb. Creamy and sharp. Exceptional.  Drinkability?

Beautiful Dark Brown Body with a caramel tint to it. Dark caramel creamy, frothy head. Molasses, brown sugar, vanilla and caramel in the aroma. Very tasty and luxurious feeling beer. Very small nutty character like a handful of sugared pecans pureed into a large bucket of molasses. Big brown sugar in the taste as well, brown malt sweetness, if I didn't know better I might think this was a gargantuan Brown Ale. Mouthfeel is heavy, chewy for the style, small bubbles and very silky, creamy-the opposite of a dry finish. The best Doppelbock I've ever had under any circumstance. Highly recommended.

T: Robust malty, bready sweetness. Red fruit, molasses, and a light bitterness on the back end.  M: Smooth thick body with low carbonation. Creamy, but perhaps a bit too thick for my taste.

S: The smell is roasted malt, molasses, and a bit of caramel.  T: Now, I must say, that I've never been a huge fan of doppelbocks. This one, however, has a flavor unlike any other that I've had. A wonderful mix of roasted malt, caramel, and molasses to provide sweetness. The hops don't make themselves too known, but certain give some balance.  M: Moderate carbonation and rather on the full body side for a lager.  D: This beer is highly drinkable.

Smell: Bready aroma with some caramel mixed in. A bit of a nutty aroma intertwined I believe. Some mild spiciness, alcohol warmth and hop aroma's.  Taste: Toasted grains and molasses. Some oily hop bitterness towards the end. Hints of dried fruits (cherry) and spiciness with some alcohol warmth, but not burn. Hops come through mostly in the finish than anywhere else.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy. Not much carbonation makes it through. A refreshing finish.  Drinkability: A little heavy and a little strong to be sessionable. But certainly one of the best dopplebocks out there.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Turns slightly drier towards the end with dark fruit, a light roasted character and a slight spiciness.  Feel: Moderate carbonation, somewhat full lager body that is somewhat creamy and smooth.

39,131,augustgarage,4.52,"Poured from an 11.5oz bottle into my Celebrator glass.  Very dark bistre tinged golden brown body with rust highlights. Good clarity at the edges where light is allowed to pass through. A small persistent wheat colored head dwindles to a thick collar with a whispy cloud in the center of the glass. Sandy lacing and syrupy legs.  Rich malt aromatics, along with brown bread crust, biscuits, condensed milk, coffee, roast peanut shells, and pretty much any other metaphoric food that undergoes the Maillard reaction.  Depth charge of malt flavors, multi-layered, some toasted, some doughy - a touch of bitterness plays counterpoint to the sweet bready notes, almost like that which comes from pumpernickel. Faint coriander, prunes, and even vanilla in the finish. Very clean overall, lacking the slight ""malt liquor"" edge that many Doppelbocks deliver.  Very smooth yet crisp medium-bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. ABV seems a touch low for the style, but then again this is one of the definitive examples thereof, and it contributes to a near-perfect drinkability.  Though I'm starting to prefer weizenbocks on their own, nothing pairs quite so well with rich food (cheese, sausage, etc) as a good Doppelbock, and this is certainly one of the best.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Some nice bready maltiness sits on the nose, mixed with figs, grapes and other vinous characteristics. Roasted malt aroma as well. Really liking this.  The first sip reveals a fruity bread like flavor with toasted malts and lots of smooth creaminess. The alcohol can be tasted at times, but is actually a nice addition to the flavor and makes the overall feel of the beer more robust. Candied figs and sugary grapes make an appearance as well and mingle in the background.  The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Nice body to the beer. This one goes down pretty easy.

Teasing bitterness that doesn't present until it builds after a few sips. A little warming. The carbonation is there, but gone in a flash to leave a watery, slightly grainy mouthfeel.

Pours with a minimal off-white head that lingers for a good amount of time.  S: Smells very malty and smells like dark grains. I smell a ton of caramel or toffee, and some dark fruits like figs or raisins. Not in the same way as some belgian dark ales, but more rich. A bit of dark chocolate as well.  T: What a rich, malty beer! I'm always blown away at the malt complexity of this beer. Very sweet and malty, but not in a cloying way. Caramel. Raisins. A little bit of biscuit. Has a very good aftertaste finishes crips and clean.  M: Velvety and clean. 6.7% abv doesn't warm you too much, and has a good balance to it. Light like a lager, but still has some thickness to it, almost like a dunkelweizen or a weizenbock.  D: Clean and smoothe, very digestible and drinkable. Good for any occasion, and can be drunk in large quantities due to the incredible cleaniness of this beer.  It is a masterful creation, and the oppitomy of a German malty beer.

There's a decent hop bitterness hiding behind everything to keep this one in check.  M: Creamy, moderate carbonation, full bodied.  D: This is outstanding stuff.

Aroma is very malty sweet. Raisins, dates and slight chocolate. Very faint citrus pulls through.  Taste is near perfect for a doppelbock. Sweet chocolate and slightly bitter coffee malts followed by a weak piny spice. Again, raisins and dates. Gets better as it warms up.  Mouthfeel is a bit weak. Carbonation is low.

39,131,infi,4.35,"Poured into a nonic pint.  Generous pour creates an rising frothy off-white head about two fingered - almost three - in size that dissipates in a matter of seconds into a small crown. Speckles of lacing appear as you take sips. The brew is a fairly translucent yet deep mahogany in color with tinges of dark cherry purple and red. The aroma is heavy with roasted bready malt and dark fruitiness akin to prunes or dates. There's some hints of chocolate and caramel sweetness underneath the rest - very appetizing.  Taste is quite savory and done exceptionally well. The flavors initially start with sweetness of the malt and molasses, along with raisins. Chocolate and slight black coffee shines through towards the middle and finishes off with a nice toasted nutty flavor and a tad hop bitterness. Subtle warmth ultimately ends the experience. Very rich and creamy. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and drinks nice and smooth with adequate tactile carbonation. I actually didn't notice how fast I finished my 330 mL bottle, which should attest to its drinkability.  This dopplebock is substantially delicious and really can hold its own.

Still, not a bad looking brew. There's a big malty character to the smell, along with a slight bit of fruitiness.  Taste pretty much follows through on the smell with the maltiness asserting itself from the get go. Slight smokiness as well. Bit of bitterness makes itself known, but nothing too excessive; this beer is by no means hoppy. There's an almost wheaty backend, the kind I'm used to getting from hefeweizens, but it's fleeting and gives way to more malty sweetness that rounds out the finish into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is decent, somewhat thinner than I expected, but still quite serviceable. Quite a bit of carbonation that helps give it character.  Good drinkability, thanks to the unique smell and taste along with the only slightly higher-than-average ABV. Not as pleasant as the Weihenstephaner Korbinian, but definitely not a terrible experience. May merit another visit down the road.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

You see a dark body and get a full mouthfeel, you smell bread and malt and taste is much of the same. It pours a very deep color with a foamy tan head. The nose displays alcohol and some toasty breadiness that combines into a more toffee-ish character. Carbonation offsets the sweet malts for a good mouthfeel.

Bitterness restrained, no hopping to speak of. FInishes with a combination of bready, grainy notes and a much sweeter malt note. The after taste has some alcohol warmth.  M - Moderate beer body, but comes across stronger due to its seemingly potent carbonation profile.  D - Deceiving ABV - very manageable.

There are also slight nuances of dark fruit like dates, raisins and figs. Seems like this one might have a little skunk to it as well and there is only a hint of the 6.7% that is hidden within.

A touch of hoppy bitterness provides the balance needed for this style.  M: Heavy body and good carbonation, this is defintely a sipping beer.  D: A classic beer truly deserving of it's reputation, a tour de force. As others are apt to use the term ""hop bomb"" this would be the prototypical ""malt bomb"".

Aroma: Rich dark fruits, raisins, blackberries, and black grapes. Sweet malts, sugars, molasses, hints of vanilla, and dark toffee. Wonderfully aromatic, full and rich.  Taste: Sweet sticky malts right from the start. Lots of caramel and toffee flavours, entwined with dark forest fruits. Strong chocolate flavours force through in the middle leveling out the taste with a touch of bitterness. The aftertaste is malts still but there are impressions of bitter coffee, which linger at the back of the palete.  Mouthfeel: Full and heavy in the mouth, with a soft smoothness but still thick and chewy. The texture is quite oily.  Drinkability: World class, truly world class. This is the Doppelbock by which others should measure themselves. The flavours are rich and sweet, with a beautifully balanced fruity profile. The best beer in the Ayinger stable by far.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,jrallen34,4.08,"I drank this from the bottle into a chalice.  This beer pours a dark brown with medium tan head that is about 1 finger high and lasts about 1 minute. The lacing is ok but there is lots of carbonation.  The aroma is very light on the nose, you detect the malts which come off as sweet chocolate or toffee.  The taste is very nice its very sweet, definitely tastes like toffee and at the end some light hops.

Great chocolate and coffee notes, even better as it warms.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,deleted_user_357747,4.97,"11.2 oz bottle purchased from LiquorMax in L-Town. I love this beer, but this gonna be my official review. I'll try to be impartial. Served in a tumbler.  Pours a deep, deep brown, almost black with just a bit of light coming through. No head to speak of, lots of bubbles coming up. The goat fell in! The lack of head is the only thing keeping this one from a perfect 5.  Smells a rich velvety malt, wow! What a smell! Herbs come through, spices, smells like black bread, maybe pumpernickel. Smokey and wonderful. My mouth is already watering...  Taste is out of this world! This is probably the most balanced beer I've ever had. Starts off like it's gonna be a bitter beast, but quickly mellows out to smooth grains. Lots of burnt earth tastes, almost unnoticeable hops, very doppelbock-y. This is what I think of when I think dark German beers; this guy doesn't mess around, but it's kind and gentle. Absolutely fantastic, a delicious beer!  The body is medium with perfect carbonation.  Drinkability is perfect, too. A dark beer with plenty of complex flavors, but without the overpowering qualities that prevent many a dark and tasty beer from being consumed with the gusto it deserves. Ayinger has solved that conumdrum with Celebrator; I could drink this at a BBQ, a funeral or when I'm simply thirsty.  I love this beer, one of my all time favorites. It's especially good when we have our Swedish Thanksgivings; compliments the food without filling you up and becoming heavy. Highly recommended.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,astout,4.5,"overall just fantastic beer, never get tired of it, especially not while there are still bottles around the house.  Real dark walnut colour nearly opaque with a great tan head that slowly dissipates leaving a decent lacing.  Aromas of molasses toasted malt and faint date scent in the background. Also quite a few doughy notes coming through.  Tastes like a combination of roasted hazelnuts molasses and some type of nut brittle all with a slightly darker tone too it. Finishes with a little bit of drying hops but not too much, definitely still a little sweet towards the finish as well as up front, but plenty of roasty balance to it.  Great smooth weighty feel to this beer, carries the intense roasted flavours very well thanks to this and goes down very very smooth.  For such an intense beer goes down very easily and carries the alcohol well.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Mistofminn,4.05,"Little embarassed it took me this long to try this beer, given it's status among the Top 100. Never-the-less I finally got around to purchasing it, and now is the time.  Pours a dark mahogany color. Initial pour produces a very creamy one finger light mocha colored head that has decent retention. Has some nice lacing patterns.  The nose is strong on chocolate and toasted malts, very sweet smelling. There is an underlying fruitiness that I wasn't really expecting, but it makes sense the more I think about it.  The flavor profile is much what I would expect, very sweet, chocolaty and toasty, with the underlying fruitiness. Very smooth and creamy almost like a milk shake.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, like I said, like a milk shake. Soo smooth and creamy, this is really enjoyable. Medium in body, this would be a great beer to enjoy with a very heavy chocolaty dessert. Drinkability is good, you can't put this one down.  I had my doubts about this one, but it turned out to be a pretty good beer. One of the best beers in the world? Maybe. One of the best Doppelbock's in the world? Probably. A good, solid, affordable beer that can be enjoyed on any occasion? Definitely.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Time to revisit Dopplebocks.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Almost a Chocolate taste in there as well too. Sweet Finish.  M- Very velvety, Nice medium body. Carbonation is not very noticeable, but present. Nice sweet finish.  O- This is an amazing beer.

39,131,jdklks,4.16,"i dont understand doppelbocks because their body color has such a vast range. this one is nearly black, though really it is a barely-transparent dark brown with a sticky and foamy tan-bordering-on-brown head that laces the glass nicely. a very nice looking beer. the smell is slightly less intense than would be desired, but nevertheless has some interesting things going on. sweet malts, reminiscent of caramel and possibly even dark chocolate. a bread smell that equates to the smell of belgian yeast (no surprise here).  the taste is at first excruciatingly sweet, though it calms down and develops into an incredible complexity that is worthy of its high rating. caramel and molasses make up the sweet flavors that hit you at the beginning and linger long into the aftertaste. a nice dose of hops compliment the sweetness through the middle, though they dont express their bitter character as much as might be desired. the bready, belgian yeasty flavor is present in perfect proportion to the other flavors, and doesn't dominate like it sometimes tends to do. finally, as in the smell, there is just the slightest hint of dark chocolate that seems almost enigmatic in relation to the other flavors, and adds a very nice and subtle touch.  mouthfeel is great. smooth, on the fuller side of medium bodied, and perfectly carbonated.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S: Very ripe citrus and sour fruits on the nose right away. Then it's bready and sweet malts with an extra twirl of the glass. There are some toasted notes, ripening berries, yeast, and sugar residuals. T/M: Just what I expected from the aromas. Very nice flavor profile starting with the toasted bread which moves on to sweet berries. The alcohol is presented in the middle of almost every sip. A medium body with higher carbonation. There's a slight tang at the back to end each sip from the tulip. D: I felt like I was drinking a fine Belgian-style ale here. The flavors were really enjoyable. A really wonderful doppelbock that doesn't let you down.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A toasty aroma is present. Little to no hop aroma detected. Perhaps a tiny amount of fruit ester.  T - Very rich malt flavor. Sweetness from malt is most evident and a toasty note exists. Not detecting any fruitiness, but a slight chocolate-like character. Possible, but hard, to detect alcohol. No hop flavor, but slight hop bitterness at finish. Balance is definitely towards malt sweetness.  M - Full to medium-full body. Medium carbonation.  D - No harshness, very smooth yet rich.  ----  Probably one of the best examples of a German Doppelbock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A - Appearance is great: dark brown with a tan head that lingers longer than for most lagers, even strong ones.  S - Sweet caramel malt, dark fruits, mild roast, and spice.  T - This is a fairly complex beer on the flavor, malty with caramel, roast, chocolate, prune, raisin, and spice. Pretty good, but not a standout.

Very brown that shines a nice red through the light. Three finger, yellowish-brownish-off white head tha dissapated very quickly with no lacing.  S - Sweet sticky smell, no hops. Definately some fruit going on there, plums or dates it seems mostly.  T - No hops, almost a little stout-esque here. A lot of roasted malts, mostly toffee with a sugary taste that coats your tongue.  M - Syrupy, light carbonation. Definately not light, more the heavier side of medium.  D - Pretty easy to get down, they syrupiness of this brew would keep it from being a session beer for me, and the sugary aftertaste makes it turn a little sour if you aren't drinking fast.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The first sip fills the palate with a good amount of caramel and earthy flavors. Really well made.  Personally: Double bock or doppelbocks can sometimes shift into the too strong territory, but not this superb example of the style. A truly well rounded, well made beer. Highly recommended.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

It looks creamy and a good tan color. The beer is a caramely red in the glass with just a little active carbonation. The head is slowly fading, but still there, and leaving an okay, but not great lace.  S: Caramely smelling and a little bit of roasted malt. Very sweet and no hops, just as I would expect from a good db. Not terribly complex though, just straight forward sweet malt.  T: Less caramel than I had hoped, more towards toffee. Quite dry in fact. I get a little bit of roast still which is interesting and sort of nice. I don't know, I'm simply not as amazed with this beer as I had hoped, it's not sweet malty enough for me  M: Smooth, though there is a little kick at the end which I accredit to the roasted malt  D: Very enjoyable and inoffensive, just not what I want in a dopple.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

This beer is dark, nearly black. Has a nice head and it falls away quickly.

T - A super solid delicious beer, but this one needs to be served cold, not room temp. initial is a big caramel malt body, some slight bitter hops, and a distinctive metallic flavour (something which I have not experienced since I had that can of crap called boddingtons). the finish is malty caramel. aftertaste is a bit of roasted or burnt malts, with molasses.

This beer is an excellent example of a top-notch German Doppelbock.  Ample head and maroon/brown body with a syrupy consistency and light carbonation. A smoked salmon and apple softness combines with a deep caramel maltiness with an intense roasted, woody, earthy flavors to balance out the dark fruits such as fig and plum.  Soft and supple finish and texture. The flavors disspiate quickly, however. There is almost an effervescence to the flavors in that they are present as the carbonation is flowing, but as soon as the carbonation begins to disappear, then, too, does the maltiness of the flavors and body.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,DefenCorps,4.42,"It is time to celebrate the imminent arrival of Oktoberfest. Poured into my Celebrator glass.  A: The pour is deep ruby red with great clarity. There's a dense, two-finger creamy-mocha colored head that recedes slowly, leaving some lace. Plenty of carbonation. Pretty.  S: Bready and fruity, there's freshly baked whole wheat bread, along with raisins, dates, plums and a little clove. Wholesome. Plenty of brown sugar and molasses.  T: Opens up with pretty complex malt flavor featuring bread, raisins, plums and dates before a firm bitterness balances things out. Bitterness tastes like it's mostly derived from burnt/caramelized sugar, but there's also a faint earthy hop character that makes itself towards the finish, especially as the beer warms up. Mid palate has flavors of buckwheat honey and brown sugar. While having plenty of sweet flavors, this is far from cloying, and is quite tremendously enjoyable.  M: While it is fairly light in body, it also has a little heft to it. Carbonation is moderate, ample for the beer. While the finish is great, with flavors of burnt sugar sweetness and bitterness, I wish it had a little more oomph to it, as it seems a little light compared to the rich flavors. What flavor is present lasts long, though  D: I was supposed to savor this over 30 minutes, but it's almost gone in the 10 that it took to review.

Malty, but yet a hint of hops, again with that rich molasses flavor, fades to slight alcohol but leaves your mouth coated with sweetness.  M: Dense feeling, and thick but without feeling heavy, very smooth. Doesn't dry very much at all.  D: For such a dark beer a very pleasant one to drink. However, do not fool yourself...you want to drink an entire 12 pack and you might try...but it won't happen.  Notes: The second doppelbock I've tasted (the other being Spaten Optimator).

I would assume that enough dark... maybe chocolate malts are used to balance this out. really enjoyable flavor that changes from the moment it hits your lips to 5 minutes after you swallowed your last sip.  perfectly carbonated, I get a faint tingle from the floor to the roof of my mouth as I take it in. medium body that really leaves a nice coating behind. really enjoyable.  this is one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had in my life. lower in ABV and higher in taste and overall enjoyability... that's coming from one who enjoys big beers much more than their counterpart...

The richness of this brew blossoms extraordinarily. It is a strong, present contender, so young palates may raise an eyebrow more than once both at first taste and as the taste experience expands.  It's got a toasted, caramel quality to it, that twinge of sugary goodness a tiny but important aspect.  I cannot express how important it is to give this beer it's space and give it time to really flourish in your mouth. Take your time with it and enjoy the particularly fantastic aftertaste.  Without doubt, one of the finest beer experiences I've ever had, hands down. You'll rarely find my house without at least a few bottles of this.

At first chocolate, then dark fruit, brown bread, raisin and toasted nuts. Its a symphony in malt, which reveals more character in each successive sip.

39,131,mareth01,4,"A- This beer poured a nice very tan 1 finger head with a dark brown to black appearanc. Throughout the drink it had very good head retention with nice lacing.  S- The smell was strong of malts and carmel.  D- It was sweet throughout with a hint of a like carmel flavor with a slight bitter taste of dark chocolate.  M: Smooth with med. carbo., decent body that's just right.  D: Very drinkable, good flavors and taste, you don't know that your are drinking a doppelbock until the third or fourth one.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Kendo,4.2,"First review from 7/21/09:  A: Frothy off-white head over dark brown (almost black, actually) body that when held up against the light displays ruby highlights.  S: Toasty malt; slightly burnt scent.  T: Malty flavors dominant -- sweet, toasted bread. Also burnt charcoal or smoke. Very little in the way of hoppy flavors.  M: Medium-to-full-bodied. Slightly over-carbonated.  D: OK.  Second review, entered 6/27/11 after getting it on tap at Wolff's Biergarten in Albany on 6/24/11 and adjusting the scores accordingly:  A: Poured into a tall, thin glass - doesn't taper like a pilsner glass, but it's wider than a stange. Body is dark brown with a nice 1-finger light-brown head.  S: Toasted bread, chocolate malt.  T: Sweet malt - toasted bread, chocolate malt - and dark fruits. Notwithstanding that malty sweetness, it finishes fairly dry.  M: Medium in heft, nice and creamy in feel.  O: Very nice. Much better than the last time I had this on tap.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ClevoPiwo,4.08,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pilsner glass. The color is a rich dark brown or deep chestnut color that reveals some hints of a cherry wood or mahogany color when held up to light. The head is nearly tan, and is about a fingers width deep eventually settling down to a spotty froth on the surface with a little bit of lacing left on the glass.  The smell is primarily malty and grainy with an ever so slight compliment of dark fruit sweetness. I don't get much else in the nose, there is no distinct hop aroma, mostly just a rich malt and grain scent.  The taste is also very rich with malt and grainy flavors. There is a caramel sweetness up front that quickly gives way to a grainy aftertaste with a hint of lingering bitterness. The body is very full and coats the palate well leaving an unmistakable finish. Despite being rich, this beer is very drinkable as well. Definitely a meal in a glass!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,HopBacchus,4.25,"A: Pours a beautiful dark dark brown color practically black beautiful to behold. A medium sized toffee colored head that lasted for a long time. Lacing is excellent.  S: Roasted malts and Carmel fill my nostrils along with chocolate.  T: Roasted malts and chocolate an almost cogniac like taste a strong aftertaste of bitter hoppes.  M: Excellent carbonation keeps flavors changing and interesting a pleasant medium body follows a slightly watery initial feel.  D: Eh, flavors are certainly pleasant and a medium body lets you know you aren't drinking just any lager however the bitter hoppe finish makes this brew filling and hard to swallow",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,kegger22,4.28,"Pours rich and almost black with a small head that did not last long. Aroma is mildly of coffee. There is a lot going on with the taste and I admit to being unable to pick out the constituent flavors, but I like the resulting combination. Feels smooth and a little oily in the mouth. Celebrator is not a slammer, nor a sipper. I would be comfortable putting away a liter, or so. BTW, since I'm sure everyone wants to know, my dog ate the goat.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,NewGeneric,3.95,"Had this a while back but took notes. Poured a clear dark reddish brown color with cinnamon head that faded quick and left no lacing. Smelled of deep malts, toffee, roasted coffee and chocolate. Tasted almost exactly the same. Smooth, but slightly overcarbed. Could drink more of this.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,bamadog,4.2,"Read a review of this from Kels from earlier this week, and I thought to myself, ""Damn, I should probably try this beer too."" So I did. Poured from the bottle to a pint glass. But what's up with the goat? I mean, should I keep it? Do I put it on a keychain?  Appearance: Pours a deep dark brown (near black) with some nice ruby highlights when held to the light; comes with a very short beige head that quickly fades to a thin and uneven skim on the surface; spotty and uneven lacing clings here and there along the sides of the glass.  Smell: Smell is of deep toasty (even possibly burnt) malts with some slight hints of a mildly burnt sugar or caramel.  Taste: Very nice! The burnt and toasty malts are in the forefront and there is a bit of a caramel/cola sweetness that follows it; as it warms a little bit there seems to be a very slight hint of a dark fruity sweetness, but it's very mild; the flavors don't seem overly complex and there doesn't seem to be a ton hiding in it and I don't feel the flavors need to be deciphered, but they are very pleasant and wonderfully crafted.  Mouthfeel: It has a nice and solid carbonation to it that helps keep the flavors bubbling throughout the mouth; and while the body feels a bit watery while it's in the mouth, it definitely finishes a bit thicker and creamier, and definitely leaves a healthy coating throughout the mouth that helps carry the full flavors through the aftertaste.  Drinkability: Moderate to high, I would say. The flavors are nice and pretty robust, the mouthfeel lets you know you're drinking a substantial beer that has enough body to not be one I could drink a ton of, but I could definitely get a couple down in a sitting.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,willjschmidt,4.3,"Poured from a 330ml bottle into the proper Ayinger Celebrator glass.  A: Pours a very dark brown with red undertones.  S: Dark fruits along with some molasses and a bit of caramel.  T: Lots of dark malt in the form of dark fruits such as plums and raisins. Some bready tones as well to go along with a bit of molasses. The finish has a distinctive hop bite. A tad on the sweet side.  M: Medium bodied, active carbonation.  D: An excellent doppelbock, one of the classics.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BeerFMAndy,4.53,"11.2 oz bottle with the Goat Charm strung around the neck. No date.  A - Cascading sexiness on a medium pour left this dark mahogany, ruby-highlighted beer with an incredibly sturdy two-finger light tan head. Easily visible legs on the glass and strong rings of lacing.  S - Incredibly sweet with rich toasted malts both chocolate and caramel. No hop aroma. Just a touch of burnt malts.  T - Robust malty flavors of dark, bitter chocolate and a sweet caramel balance well while a burnt malty dry bitterness finishes off the mildly sweet beer.  M - Rich and smooth, it coats the throat on the way down. Fairly full-bodied but still crisp like a lager should be.  D - Not as sweet as many of the Dopplebocks I've experienced but it actually makes it a more drinkable beer. The alcohol, until you begin to feel it, is completely hidden and since it's a lager, it has a nice crisp lager feel and drinkability.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,meatyard,4.71,"Bottle pored into a Celebrator DB glass.  Pours out a clear, dark mahogany with a 1+ finger, tan head that lingers, falling slowly. It's such a pretty color when viewed through a 100W bulb. The smell is prunes, dark fruit and sweetish malt. The taste has a lot happening. There's a bit of smoke, some dark fruit, roasted malt and mild sweetness. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, medium body and smooth. Very drinkable, the first glass goes way too quickly. While not a low ABV, this is still an easy to drink couple with no harm done. This is better than my favorite American DB, Hooker's Liberator which is an excellent DB. If Andechs is better then I really want to try it sometime. Such a good beer, wish I had a case of it like I had a few years ago-what luxury that was.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,kels,4.5,"I'm really not sure why it took me so long to try this beer. I really enjoy dopplebocks, and considering this is one of the standards, I should have had it sooner. Plus, I really like the little plastic goat. This review is on a bottle poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours super dark, more like a porter or stout. It is darkest chocolate brown, almost black and very opaque - not viscous, just not clear at all. A short, 1 finger, watery tan head fades immediately to a well-retained skim with milky-looking bubbles. Light washes of tan head cling to the sides of the glass throughout the drink and slide back down slowly into the liquid.  Smell: The smell isn't incredibly prominent, but is strong enough. The bulk of it comes through in nicely chewy and toasted malts, with a little bit of toasty grain and sweet caramel.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Delicious. This is a very full-flavored and well-bodied beer. The taste is really satisfying - full of chewy, bready grains and lightly roasted malts that have hints of caramel and coffee. The aftertaste hints at slightly citrus hops and the fairly well-masked alcohol. Feel is wonderful. It definitely complements the heavier flavors well, lightening them up with a mouth-filling fizziness that spreads the flavors around the palate and makes the beer more refreshing than expected.  Drinkability: Really, really high. I appreciate the fullness of the flavors paired with the lighter, well-carbonated feel. It is a satisfying beer that's still quite refreshing.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,mtstatebeer,4.27,"33 cl. bottle. Pours a coca-cola brown with a decent light brown head, good lacing. Aroma is chocolate, roasted malts, fruity esters, molasses, and some bread. Flavor is similar, good malty profile, roasted malts, and chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium, fairly low carbonation, a very well-balanced beer. Warms well. Delicious overall and a perfect example for a doppelbock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,FleeVT,4.38,"330ml brown long with no dates to speak of poured into a mug.  A: Thick and syrupy, a deep brown coming out of the bottle. Once in the glass it is pretty much black with only the faintest of light penetration around the edged. A glorious tan head adorns the viscous oil, clings to the glass and my nose.  S: Imagine a old school chocolate malted milkshake with a hint of vanilla essence added. It's a beautiful thing. The chocolate malts have a nice roasted finish. Very little hop spice or alcohol on the nose.  T/M: A meal in a bottle, as one would expect from a Doppelbock. A nice mild carbonation gives the otherwise creamy brew a bit of purchase on the tongue. Roasted toasted malt with some brown sugar and caramel flavors. Nice finish that lingers with that warming alcohol sensation. Extremely deep complex beer.  D: A slow roller to savor. I don't know why I waited so long to try this one. Should be the standard for the style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,atpben,4.5,"Had this beer at the Gingerman in Houston. Poured into a pint glass. Wow, this is the best dopple bock I've had so far. Poured an almost black color with a little red and brown in it. Aromas of chocolate, toffee, and brown sugar. The taste has more of the chocolate, brown sugar with the taste of figs and dates. What a great combination. Starts off sweet and finishes dry with an almost smoky finish. I love this beer. This was the first time I tried it and this beer is now my favorite dopplebock.

D- Very high, but very filling. Still, this is great beer. Amazingly tasty.  This beer is one of my favorites, and with good reason. As close to perfection as almost any beer I've ever had.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,plaid75,4.47,"On tap at The Lark in East Northport, New York.  Poured a deep brown hue with a thin white cap. There was good retention and lacing.  The smell featured a heavy cereal grain, nuts, caramel and pumpernickle.  The taste consisted of layer upon layer of multi grain goodness. Doughy and crusty pumpernickle bread came to mind with a lingering, yet dry, caramel.  The mouthfeel was toward the fuller side of the style with a relatively dry finish.  Overall an incredibly enjoyable dopplebock. World class, but you already knew that.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

I almost thought it was black until a closer look revealed brown colors; almost a reddish/maroon center color.  S - Sweet roasted malts and molasses.  T - Can taste what I smell. A nice blend of roasted malts and raisins. The aftertaste remains of roasted malts.  M - Carbonation gives my tongue a nice little bite. It isn't heavy/thick but isn't light, and it goes down good.  D - The alcohol is covered well but the beer is almost too good to be just passing around as a session... in fact, I saved this beer and gave it to myself as a birthday treat.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Taste- Very mellow and blanaced. Roasty aromas marry with dark fruits, not to sweet but not bitter at all. At the end the hops make a soft spicy appearance.  Mouthfeel- Very encompassing and long lasting, the hops linger longer than the malt.  Drinkability- I could probably drink 1 or 2 pretty easy in the summer, but this would be a great fall early winter beer.  Not as sweet as people bill it to be but it's good nevertheless.

Appearance: Head was small, but the brew looked fantastic. Its primary color was a very dark brown on the interior, but with light coffee brown edges as the light hit it.  Smell: Malty-molasses goodness. Smokey, plus notes of coffee.  Taste: Roasted malty awesomeness. A little bit of dark fruit and nuts. You still taste some hops. What I love about it is how it's a complex beer without tasting cluttered.  Mouthfeel: I was afraid it would be too thick for its own good. But the mouthfeel is solid. It could have a bit more carbonation, but that was minor.  Drinkability: I didn't taste any alcohol so this goes down real easy. Well done.  Honest, well crafted, comprehensive, with a sense of history without at all tasting busy. Grab this when you can.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

It's almost black in color, with a slight amber hue and a thin tannish head that quickly recedes into a vortex-looking swirl in the middle. The scent of caramel and molasses with a hint of coffee greets my nose.  Tastes mostly of chocolate, toasted caramel and molasses, with minimal hops presence. Halfway down, the coffee becomes somewhat evident. I can taste a small yet sharp unidentified sweetness on the sides of my tongue. I want to say that it's butterscotch. This is very smooth, with little carbonation. Very drinkable and good to wind down to after a long day of whatever tires you out.  I would definitely like to have this again.

Lots of chocolatey smoothness. This is Germany in a bottle.  Drinkability: For a 6.7% alc/vol beer, this is ridiculous. Such an easy drinking pint, I'd be happy drinking this all day long.

Best one ever. Molasses, sweet, little hop, not to strong. Delicious.  M- Not very carbonated. Maybe, I drank it too cold? Rich, creamy, and smooth.  D- I could have drank 12 and gone to heaven.

(T)- Very coffee-like nuances surrounded by a super creamy milk chocolate and vanilla combination. Some brown sugar/molasses in this too.  (M)- Super smooth and velvety on the tongue. Good level of carbonation that balances everything nicely. Creamy and delicate textures.  (D)- This is one of the easiest drinking dopplebocks I have had to date. Most are too sweet and too filling.

Nice dark coffee/cola color with a finger width almond colored head at the top. Bubbles in the head were even but big. There was minimal lacing down the glass and very little head retention (thin wispy head is all that remains after about five minutes).  My wife says ""that actually smells like 'beer' for a change"". It's true; there is a lot of malt in the nose and up close it seems really sweet. Strong aroma with a flavor to match. This beer reminds me of a very dark chocolate and has corresponding coffee notes. The finish is consistent with a long lingering bitter aftertaste. Very enjoyable beer on the taste side. No real noticeable alcoholic notes for me.  One look at the bottle or the glass and you realize that this is meant to be savored. However, its a smooth beer that you can really get into. Creamy with a heavy body. Good mouthfeel, not crazy drinkable but good for the style.  I can see why this beer is so highly rated. I definitely intend to enjoy it again.

Nice bready leather tobacco smell, sweet caramalized sugars like the burning flesh of goats to dionysus.  Great Malt taste.

No smell of any lingering hops. Fresh bread from the malts as well. A nice mix of chocolate and dark fruits in the back. A great smelling beer all and all.  T- Having had some bad luck on some new dopplebock offerings it's good to come back to the best. Deep malt sweetness plus some bananas I did not pick up in scent. Some dark fruit as well with figs.

This is very sweet on the mouth and goes down oh so smooth. Just a bit of an aftertaste with sweetness and a touch of roast.  D- On my next bottle already, 12oz were not enough, and the ABV is on the low end which makes it easier for me in the morning.

39,131,OldSchoolGamer,3.78,"I can probably count on one hand how many different Doppelbocks I have had. Based on reviews, this is the premier example of the style. Here is my review:  A: First off, this has probably got the coolest bottle I have ever seen. Highly colorful label and it comes with a free toy. Nice! The beer itself is a dark brown color. Light does penetrate through the beer. Brown head dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass.  S: Smells very sweet. Raisin, dark fruit, hints of coffee, and some earthy notes.  T: Big complexity. The initial taste is brown sugar. Raisins, plums, earthy undertones, and quite a bit of coffee in the finish. Alcohol does come through in the flavor as well.  M: Medium bodied and very prickly in the mouth. Not prickly from carbonation, but from the alcohol. Coats the mouth somewhat. Leaves alcohol warmth in the throat. Not very smooth.  D: This beer drinks more like a stronger beer. It is only 6.7%ABV, but seems more like a 7.5% or higher. This is a sipper. Alcohol comes through quite a bit, but is not too harsh. It is quite filling as well.  This easily takes the cake as the best Doppelbock I have tried. That being said, I really like this beer, but I am not crazy over it. Definetly something that you buy once in a while, its not going to be a staple in the fridge.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,FloppyDog,4.42,"Served on tap at the Flying Saucer in Raleigh, NC.  This beer was poured into a stemmed beer glass. It had a deep brown color and minimal off white head.  Initially the aroma was solely of subdued malt, but as it warmed and was swirled in the glass, I picked up raisin/prune notes along with a pleasantly subdued alcohol aroma as well.  The taste began with slight burnt (but not astrigent) malt followed by some toffee and hints of sweetness that lingered for a few seconds. The beer was medium-bodied and very enjoyable.  Overall, very rich in malt character, and a good representation of a doppelbock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S: Chocolate, molasses and dark fruits and some caramel sweetness.  T: Lots of stuff going on here. First hit is chocolate, then then the molasses, dark fruits, caramel sweetness, grainy bready malt with caramel and a bit of a yeasty twinge. Very little hop flavor. Finish is long and creamy. Very good beer.  M: Thick, coating and chewy. No alcohol flavor.  D: Great, let this beer warm up a bit and all the flavors come together to make a great drinkable beer.  Overall I can see how this rates so high. So complex, so creamy smooth. The only thing that lowers the score for me was I thought it could have used a bit more hops, but that's me. Great beer, world class.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,drizzam,4.6,Appearance - Poured into a clear pint glass...Held up to the light it's a deep dark ruby red. Nice one finger tan head with decent head retention. Some lacing down the inside of the glass.  Smell - Malty caramel odor...some mild molasses as well. Not overpowering in the nose.  Taste - This is one marvelous tasting brew!! The caramel and molasses frolic wonderfully together. A great balance of malt and hop. I'm incredibly impressed with this Doppelbock!  Mouthfeel & drinkability - Velvet smooth mouthfeel...slick and almost oily. Mild to moderate carbonation. I could drink this all night long if it was a little cheaper. The cost is the only thing that lowers the drinkability in my opinion. Even the 6.7% ABV is superbly masked by the flavor. World class beer!!,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,BZero007,4.73,"Picked up from a Piggly Wiggly at the Common Market in Myrtle Beach, SC.  Poured from bottle in to my Aventinus glass. This bock is just plain sexy. It pours an extremly dark ruby color. The beer is pour black with the exception when light is beaming threw it, then you can easily the ruby color to it. The head forms easily and does not take much, color is an light tan color to it. The lacing sticks around to show this beer is a piece of art.  Smell is a great as it plows threw and makes you think of a certain fruit you have had. Everytime I took a wiff a new fruit sensation would take over.  The taste is some thing that makes you sit back and think. It is a very complex brew and certain flavors seem to come in the foreground with every sip. Mainly the taste is of a dark fruits with a molasses sweetness. With every taste I sat there and analyzed it untill about the fith sip, as I was hit with a bit of realization. This beer had asked me to sit back and relaxed outside and enjoy it.  The body is great and thanks to the perfect level of carbonation it helps the flavors and aromas greatly. The body and alcohol level makes this brew something I could drink threw the night. As I would relax and take my time with it as it rightly deservs it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

There is also some bread in there after a couple of breathes, more like a cracker smell to it. Limited hop charter definitely malty smell.  T - WOW!!! this is great. Very creamy with just the right balance of slight hops carbonation and malts. Slight roasted malt fell with definite chocolate present it is well balanced. Some nut tones as well.

39,131,TexIndy,3.61,"Has this one several times and was surprised to see that I hadn't reviewed it yet so here goes. Poured from a 330ml bottle into a pint glass. Had some dating notches on the front but no way to decipher them. It was dark brown almost black in color with mahogany highlights against a light. It had a large tan head that slowly settled down to a thick collar and partial film. Some carb streams but no lacing.  The nose was very sweet malt, caramel and molasses. Too sweet for me. Same with the taste. Very sweet with no bite to it. Needed something to offset the sweet. Not knowing the age on it so not sure if this is normal or not. It's been several years since I had one and seem to remember more of a balance to it. Mouthfeel was nice and creamy.  Overall, a good but not great beer. This isn't one of my favorite styles but even considering that this one was a bit of a letdown. Rotation-wise it's probably once every year or so.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A-Pours dark brown with a one finger sandy head that rather quickly dissolves to a ring with some residual islands of foam. Some minor spot lacing is left.  S-Malts galore in this one. There are both sweet and roasted malt smells giving off aromas of burnt sugar, dark chocolate, and coffee. There is also a bit of what I can only describe as dustiness in the nose.  T-The sweet malts hit first and give off flavors of chocolate and burnt sugar. The roasty flavors do not hide in the background and bring out the coffee flavor. The roasted and sweet malts play off each other very well and neither side dominates.  M-Medium bodied and a tad bit creamy. It has a perfect level of carbonation that can best be described as gentle on the tongue.  D-This is best reserved as a nightcap. One to be sipped and enjoyed as it opens up nicely as it warms.  A great beer that is able to balance the roasted and sweet malts. This is a great one to have after a busy day on a cold night.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

M- Malt is smooth as it hits the palate. Creamy, fluffy, chewy. A pleasure to drink. Hidden carbonation appears in the mouth to create a wonderful experience.  D- Very drinkable beer that just feels good to drink. A comparatively simple beer that just goes down well.

39,131,kflorence,4.28,"A: This beer pours a dark, almost opaque amber brown with a small layer of tan head. Looks to be a pretty heavy beer, a little syrupy. Not much lacing, foam dissipates and turns sticky instead of retaining its bubbles.  S: The aroma is bittersweet; roasted malts dominate primarily, but it's more complex than that. In the back, there is caramel, molasses, dark fruits and chocolate. A very small amount of carbonation and alcohol lingers in there as well.  T: This is a great doppelbock, perhaps one of the best; certainly one of the best I've tried. Packed with roasted malts, it comes off as semi-sweet, balanced out by a dark chocolate and coffee flavor. My first sip almost tasted like barbecued ribs, but once it warmed up it was easier to distinguish notes. Aside from the prominence of the roasted malt, there is also dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, caramel, dark fruits (figs, prunes)... there are some other spices in here I can't identify. The BBQ flavor still lingers in there a bit.  M: The mouthfeel of this beer is slightly syrupy. It definitely helps to distinguish its complexity and stays around on the tongue for awhile. I would say this is a medium to heavy bodied beer; leaning more towards heavy as it warms up.  D: While this beer is very complex and very tasty, I don't think I'd be able to have more than a few of them, they are rather filling. That said, it is very easy to drink but too good of a beer to be gulped, it must be savored. Overall very pleased by this doppelbock, look forward to drinking it again!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S: Tons of toasted malt, coffee, figs.  T: Following the nose, has a strong backbone of toasted malt. Has a slightly bitter character by the coffee, with some roasted malt presence that is nicely complemented by a fig finish.  M: Light-to-medium bodied, with medium carbonation that works well for the style. Aftertaste leans toward bitter.

T: A fine balance between sweet caramel with a dry bite of roasted coffee and bittering hops. A touch of figs. Little yeastiness compared to some other traditional German doppelbocks, in a good way for me.  M: Moderately thick and very smooth feel. Goes great with the taste. Maybe a tad bubbly.  D: Damn tasty. Easily among my favorite lagers. It could easily be better if bottle conditioned, but damn this is tasty. Six pack is atrractive, just too bad it will run twenty bones.

39,131,benwah22,4.7,"Enjoyed this delicious brew from the bottle into a .3L Celebrator Dobbelbock specialty glass. Pours the color of Coca Cola - black with the slightest hint of dark brown in the light. Tan head that disappeared rather quickly.  Good mouthfeel. With a beer this dark you just expect a creamier mouth feel, but still good nonetheless. Not a whole lot of aroma, but wow, what a taste. Malty, coffee, dark chocolate, burnt caramel but not overly sugary. A smooth finish with a hint of bitterness.  My tip, let the beer warm slightly. Not room temperature, but definitely not straight from the fridge. It really helps the complexity of this beer stand out. And let's face it, if you can get a Ayinger Celebrator specialty glass, it definitely tastes better.  EDIT: I let this warm pretty significantly and the taste just became incredibly complex and the mouthfeel changed substantially. It was almost syrup like and the flavors you needed to flesh out before just hit you over the head. Great stuff.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,Gigantis,2.82,"Cool bottle with a white plastic goat hanging off of it. Poured into my snifter.  It pours a thick-looking reddish-brown (maroon?) and it had a big tan head on it. It looks pretty damn appetizing - if dense and brown are appetizing to you.  The smell was the first cause for let down. I got almost nothing from taking a few whiffs of this one. Some bread and very toasty malts. And... that's pretty much it. It smells like a beer but there is no spiciness and it doesn't smell as dark as it appears to be.  The taste is better with some big time malts and flavorful sugary fruit essence mixed in for good measure. Not much in the way of hop bitterness to balance it out, I thought. Slight chocolate undertone... I'll try this again someday to try and pick out the intricacies. Not very robust... Still, a nice tasting dopplebock.  There is medium carbonation and a medium body. A little sweet stickiness/creaminess.  I didn't want want another one after this. It feels thick in one's stomach and although this is a creamy beer, I did not cream myself over it.

Theres some chocolate malt in there for certain, it comes out big time on the nose. Also some flowery kinda hops smells. It tastes big and malty, with roasted flavors and first and then straight chocolate at the end. It has more of a hop presence than I expected, and this cleans up the sugars nice. As it warms a bit the chocolate may over power it more than I'd like. Anyway, pretty great beer.

Poured into a chilled pint glass.  A: Dark brown with a good bit of head on it. Head disappeared fairly rapidly  S: At first, the typical ""lager-y"" scents, then a bit of the caramel and fruityness began to arrive. The fruityness increased as the beer warmed.  T: Nice malty blast. Maybe a teeny bit over-roasted though. That bitterness subsided with each sip. Became more balanced as the glass emptied.  M: Thick-ish but not bread-like.

39,131,johnmichael712,4.35,"Appearance: Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a pilsner glass. There is no freshness date on the bottle, but that doesn't matter because this is one of the coolest bottles I've ever seen. The old-world style label, the dominant use of white for a clean look, and the nifty little goat charm make this beers packaging a winner. Appearance is based on the look of the beer in a glass, however, so let's get to it. This beer pours a dark, cola brown color with ruby red highlights and is a shade or two darker than the Thomas Creek Deep Water Doppelbock I had earlier today. A fairly vigorous pour yields a soft, fluffy, two-fingered head that is a lovely medium brown color, perhaps a few shades darker than a pair of khaki pants. The head gradually fades to a light film covering the surface of the beer, and it leaves a small amount of Belgian lace behind on the sides of the glass.  Smell: The nose of this beer has an absolute mountain of very sweet malt in it; the kind of extra sweet smell that a Scotch Ale has. There are also hints of caramel, dark fruit, and perhaps a bit of chocolate, but the sweet malt is so overpowering that it's hard to pick these up. There are no roasted malt aromas, no hop aroma, and no alcohol presence, and this nose is spot on for a Doppelbock.  Taste: I don't have much to base my review on for how a Doppelbock is supposed to taste, only the Thomas Creek beer that I had earlier today and what the BJCP guidelines tell me. Right from the start, however, I can firmly say that this beer is much better than the Thomas Creek Deep Water Doppelbock. As in the nose this beer begins with a delicious sweet malt flavor that dominates the palate, but there are also notes of sweet milk chocolate, coffee with milk, and perhaps a bit of molasses and anise. These flavors are pretty dominant throughout, but the finish does bring a hint of smokiness, a slight leafy hop flavor, a bit of fig, and a slight drying effect to the table.  Mouthfeel: I think the best words to describe the mouthfeel of Celebrator are soft and gentle. While some beers seem rough, biting, or even like they bruise the tongue, this beer seems to roll on and off the tongue, gently caressing the cavities of the mouth. Medium-full bodied, low carbonation, and very, very smooth without even a hint of harshness or astringency.  Drinkability: All of the beers from Brauerei Aying that I've tasted have been exceptionally drinkable, and their Doppelbock is no exception. This beer is perhaps a bit too sweet for me to drink more than one of (unless I were drinking it with food, which as I type this I'm really craving some cheese or a steak to pair this with), but I'm having no trouble disposing of these twelve ounces. Would I drink this again? Easily. Would I buy this again? Oh yeah.  Notes: My first high quality Doppelbock, I was very impressed with all facets of this beer. I'm really anxious to try some more Doppelbocks after this one, mainly the Paulaner Salvator and the Victory St. Victorious. Considering the fact that these beers have a long history of being great seasonals for the spring time, I'll hopefully be picking some more up on my next trip to the store. Celebrator Doppelbock has given me a lot to celebrate about, and for that I give much thanks to the little town of Aying.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,dotsonjamesg,3.26,"Bocks to me are just...eh, bleh. They aren't bad but I have never been truly impressed with them. I have never had an ""A"" graded bock so when I found ""Ayinger Celebrator"" I was curious. I wasn't sure if I was willing to pay $12.40 for a four pack of beer, especially for a bock. I have no problem throwing that money down for an four-pack, or even a single 22oz, of Imperial Stout but I just can't imagine paying that much for something with such little alcohol content and flavor.  I figure if this brew has such a good reputation, it must be worth trying it at least once. I just hope I don't get let down. Seeing the goats on the bottle reminded me of ""Beerfest."" ""If you can drink Ram's piss, you can drink anything!""  Appearance: Poured a dark, filtered, cola brown with a dense of white head with moderate little, to light, retention and about the same for the lacing. The froth left on the side quickly dissipated and slide off the walls of my pint cup fairly quick. Not impressed.  Smell: The nose is pretty light and crisp with some earthy tones and bitter maltiness hidden in there. The brew is not very aromatic or impressive.  Taste: Bitter malty sweetness in the beginning that moves in to a subtle vortex of complexity. Hints of vanilla, chocolate, and fruit are subtle but still present. Light, malty, vanilla-like, bitter-sweetness lingers on for a bit after each gulp.  Mouthfeel: The medium body and low, yet smooth, carbonation really the brew go down easy.  Drinkability: In terms of alcohol content and flavor, its not worth a second try. I have another three from the four pack and I think that is going to be it for me. The brew itself is drinkable but it doesn't have a unique bite, nor is it high in alcohol. There really isn't any reason why I would buy this again.  Samuel Adam's had a lot more flavor, alcohol, and was cheaper. Plus I got twice as drunk for 3% less. Boo to Celebrator!  Germany aint got shit on American brewing!

I was determined not to come to a decision before I finished it or based on other peoples' opinions. This is the result.  The look is incredible. The head pours several fingers and just sits there. When it diminishes, it's to a fat pillow of at least two fingers. It just doesn't go away. Ever. Lacing is left all over the place. The color is nearly black and shines a rich, deep brown with red tint in the light. The complexity of the aroma adds to its appeal. Heavy malt with typical caramel, molasses and licorice notes takes up the forefront with a biscuity tone and some herbal, earthy hops teasing. The taste is just as complex; everything you expect from the malt with a little spicy bite and earthy hops. A nice flavor of toasted grains rounds it out for excellent balance. The mouthfeel is everything I dreamed. Thick and creamy as could be expected with a nice smoothness. Carbonation is lively but not heavy. It's complimentary rather than oppositional. As far as drink ability goes, I don't know why you'd want only one of these at a time.  Love the goat.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Overall it is well balanced in its mix of tastes I think and not too overwhelming.  Very smooth for the amount of taste that is going on.

39,131,laituegonflable,3.74,"Pours with a sensational surface pour with thick bubbles actually cascading down the outside of the glass and up the middle of the beer. Dark amber colour, about as dark as you get before it becomes a dark beer. Very generous beige head, fading slowly but still there, quite dense. Nice lacing, not very grippy.  Very malty characters on the nose, with a tart, spicy aspect. Slight roasted aspect, but yeah, more malt than anything else - smells like a brew day. Quite nice, but would like a bit more.  Taste is quite rich and malty, with a very slight pitter pang on the back, reminiscent maybe of coffee beans. Hint of nutmeg on the front or something but can't quite pick it. There is an inexplicably chocolatey aspect lingering behind the main palate. Mouthfeel is smooth, velvety and creamy and is suitable for the flavour although part of why it's smooth is because palate feels not very complex. Nice, strong flavours especially on the back, but otherwise not too layered. Very drinkable though.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,bfields4,4.72,The darkest mahogany brown before being black. A nice tight head that rises and falls quickly.  The sweet smell of toasted malts make my mouth water. Nice faint smell of biscuits and caramel.  Wow flavor hits right away. Nuttiness and malts and molasses and bananas and... so exceptional finally fades way to a very creamy caramel.  As a huge German beer fan I am ashamed it has taken me so long to finally pick one of these guys up. With Celebrator and Weinstephaner I always have a way to make my way back to Munich.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,birchstick,3.96,"A - pours with nice one-finger head and chocolate brown in appearance  S - This has a nice aroma to it with sweet, dark fruits (grape and figs) and caramel malts come though.  T - Starts off with dark fruits that soon mix with chocolate and some slight burnt malts. Not a taste I was expecting from the smell.  M - goes down creamy and smooth - mouthfeel is great.  D - this is an excellent doppelbock. I can understand why it is so highly regarded for its style. I know I will revisit this one soon.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,stingrayvr6,4.97,"Deep brown/red color, with malty, caramel, vanilla and molases smell. Two finger gream colored head, lingered and stuck well. Incredible taste, malty and sweet but balanced with molasses notes, and a somewhat floral taste. Very smooth vanilla caramel finish, but not too sweet. Incredible beer, my new favorite.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,JohnQVegas,3.93,"Draught into chalice.  Pours dark brown with reddish highlights and a creamy tan head.  Aroma is breadcrust, slightly roasty malt.  Taste is clean but rich - breadcrust and cocoa, a hint of dark fruit, and a slightly nutty roastiness that grows and dries out slightly on the finish.  Mouthfeel is light but velvety. Very nice beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,mwagner1018,4.23,"A- Very nice deep red tint, deep dark chocolate, nice creamy caramel head, about 1-2 fingers worth.  S- Nice strong toasted caramel malt note, not a strong aroma to this beer, but there is a nice creaminess to the head that spawns that sweet roasted barely...  T- Really well rounded, a relatively low (in my opinion 6.7%) doesn't come through at all, nicely balanced, caramel, roasted nut, deep coffee character, chocolate...very nice.  M- Creamy, yet carbonated and smooth, very clean rolling character in the mouth, flows over the tongue like a liquid roller coaster, enticing and tantalizing all of the taste buds...  D- Nice and drinkable for a dopplebock, could certainly have a few of these on one of those cold- not quite spring days, with the hint of winter still in that air...nice and rich...well crafted...",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,webmanspidey,4.35,"Pours dark brown/black.. fizzy with a tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smell contains grape, chocolate, and yeast. Taste is a smooth mix of chocolate and grape again. This is not bitter in the slightest.. very sweet with almost no alcohol presence. Drinkable and delicious, but not extremely complex. Mouthfeel is fairly fizzy and not too thick. This is probably the definitive example of the style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Rainne,5,Absolutely the best Doppelbock I've ever had.  A- Deep dark brown color. A big fat sticky tan head with the best retention I've ever seen. It leaves itself all over the place yet somehow never leaves. Incredible.  S- Toasty malt and caramel toffee sweetness right off with a good clean citrus herbal hops presence and light spices. Nice biscuit and not too powerful but warm alcohol as well.  T- Holy complexity Batman! It's a lot of things but everything fits together as if God himself were the unity. Malt up front with the caramel sweetness then citrusy subtle spicy hops. Nice balanced hops bitterness combined with light fruit flavors and toasty biscuit. Finish is lingering with light sweetness and grains.  M- This is a huge creamy thick full bodied brew. Very smooth. Carbonation is part of the harmony that is the hand of God in a bottle. Perfection.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,selecter70,4.4,"I love my doppelbocks, & Ayinger does not let down. 11.2 ounces that should be more, needless to say. A dark, copper-brown pour to blackish-crimson with red light fills with a light beige 1/2 finger head and decent lace. The aroma presents English biscuity malts & brewer's yeast with slight banana. The flavor takes the aroma & adds smooth good chocolate hints & a mild alcohol that sits briefly in the nose. Medium to full-bodied, this doppelbock grants you a warm feeling of strength.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Rayek,4.57,"A: Deep mahogany and ruby colored brew. Rocky tan head sticks around and has great retention. Leaves lots of lace.  S: Sweet, with a heavy dose of raisins, plums and chocolate, plus a hint of alcohol and smoke. The alcohol and smoke aromas keep the beer from being over the top sweet.  T: Excellent. Dark fruits from the nose carry into the flavor. Bittersweet baking chocolate and a hint of smoked malts come along to add to the complexity. Bitterness arrives with pepper and a mild alcohol bite that provides just enough compensation for the sweet flavors. Goes down with a lingering subdued sweetness and a hint of smoke.  M: Medium-heavy body feels thick and substantial in the mouth. Carbonation level is just right.  D: One of my favorite doppelbocks. A cut above other offerings of this style in my mind. The cool goat attached to the bottle is a nice bonus.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BierFan,4.34,"Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a cervoise.  Very dark ruby body capped by two fingers of tan foam. Big rich aroma, lots of molasses and caramel. Very sweet. More sugary chocolate and caramel goodness in the taste. Bitter dark chocolate flavor from the malts. Very creamy mouthfeel.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,JamesP123,4.8,"Wow this is one helleva brew. My Favorite Dopplebock!  A. Nice and dark, not translucent. Nice head that stays put.  S. First semll is roasted grains/toasted bread. followed by some sweetness and a bit of alcohol coming through.  T. This is where the beer shines. Very balanced flavors, Molasses/brown sugar with thick/rich roasted malts. Very smooth and balanced and soft.  M. Smooth and a little creamy. Medium bodied.  D. Great taste, smooth and enjoyable. Nearly perfection in a bottle. Definately a new favorite in my book.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,drtth,4.4,"Served in an Ayinger Celebrator glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: Dark ruby brown (or mahogany) color with minimal creamy tan head and lacing.  Smell: Soft sweet dark malt and fruits, no hops. Nothing particularly strong and the balance is subtle.  Taste: Rich malt flavor throughout with a faint underlying and residual bitterness. Definite touch of brown sugar, hint of roasted malt, and some flavor of dark chocolate. The key to this beer is balance of flavors. None dominate the others. Also temperature is definitely critical with this beer and it needs to be at cool room temperature in order to open up the flavors.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with soft fine carbonation. The finish is medium long with malt and fruit sweetness sliding into a faint bitterness.  Drinkability: Drinkability is good on this one and I could keep taking sips for much longer than the beer lasts even though I'd want to limit myself to no more than two a night.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A decently thick body but almost no carbonation to speak of, which this beer could benefit a lot from.  There is a certain grainy, cheesy sourness in the taste that I just can't get over. It bothers me a lot, to the point where I will avoid this beer in the future.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,heinekenike,4.28,"Nice.  Dark, dark brown color, maybe a hint of burnt red when held to light just right, but pretty opaque. Nice tan head exits quickly.  Smell is malty molasses, but doesn't really hit ya.  Smooth taste, the molasses and fruity aftertaste come together to make something special.  This is a real treat. At 6.7% not as strong as other doppelbocks, but it for something high in drinkability.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,PirateUlf73,4.83,"Poured into a mug.  A: Dark ruby-brown color with a thick tan head. Retention and lacing were excellent.  S: Lots of sweet caramel on the nose, along with a warm, toasty character. Some light roast notes come through as well. Rich aromas, but never overwhelming.  T: Deep roasted character, tempered somewhat by a rich, caramel sweetness. Warm toasty notes and a very mild hop bitterness round it all out. Very well-blended. On the lower end in terms of carbonation and the aftertaste is sweet and roasty.  D: Probably the most drinkable dopplebock I've ever tasted. Could throw a few back, but this is a sipper in my book.  Wow. I'm stunned. I cannot think of any way that this beer could possibly be improved. Rich and malty, yet very drinkable.

Head: Was very strong off-white in color and evaporated away shortly after the bottle was empty. Mouthfeel: Felt very nice throughout and wasn't too acidic/bitter on the tongue, didn't leave that bitter taste on the back of the tongue at all. Went down very smooth. Taste: I got a nice coffee flavor with some hints of fruitiness, was not able to pick a fruit out but it had a good mixture. Drinkability: Had mine after dinner and worked nicely as a digestif  I would recommend this it anyone and would like to have it stocked year-around. Highly, highly recommend.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

T- Taste is out of this world. This is the best bock I have had. Roasted dark grains along with sweet molasses and a pinch of hoppy bitterness.  M- Well rounded feeling. Not too dry, not too slick. Smooth carbonation  D- A slow drinker but definitely an enjoyable brew  Pair with: Chocolate",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Thorpe429,4.57,"A: Cola-colored as it comes out of the bottle. A fairly-light cream head with minimum amounts of carbonation. In the glass, it's a deep brown that is nearly opaque. Lacing in decent amounts as it goes down. Additionally, bonus points for having by far the coolest bottle I have seen to date, completed by the plastic goat.  S: Rich, rich malt with underlying complexity. Slight sugars of dates behind a caramel scent.  T: Very rich--much like the nose--and slightly sweet. Hints of light molasses, although the malt dominates--in a very good way.  M: Excellent creamy texture with low to moderate amounts of carbonation. Extraordinarily smooth with little to no alcohol presence.  D: Exceedingly drinakble. Beautiful taste and fairly light in body, combined with a low enough ABV to be quasi-sessionable, this is an excellent choice for the summer months ahead.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,TheBishop,5,"This beer defines doppelbock. It is nothing short of extraordinary. If there is a better doppelbock, send me some, because I don't believe there is.

Smells of malts, sourdough bread, slight hops, and a sweet smell.  Tastes similar with a strong malt flavor up front, bread, molasses, very sweet in taste. There are undertones of hops.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and slightly carbonated. Very smooth though.  This brew is excellent. It's a nice change from the usual over hoppy beers that I enjoy most. I would put the drinkability at a 5.0, but I could never see myself drinking this brew on a regular basis.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,GRPunk,4.59,"Bottle poured into a mug.  A- A normal pour created a 1-1/2 finger, tan/brown head that dropped, somewhat quickly, to a full lace. The body was a deep brown, nearing black, and showed a medium carbonation level. The sticking quality is there, although the glass I chose didn't do a great job of showcasing it.  S- Robust and complex. I was met with sweet scents that remind me of cooked raisins or prunes. Great malt profile is definitely showcased. There's something of a chocolate aroma in the background.  T- More of the goodness hinted in the aroma. Sweet raisin-like flavors. There's a quality that makes me think of a nice, dark, artisan bread.  M- Medium-light carbonation. Slightly warming. Bit of a hop/carbonation/alcohol tingle. Some light coating effect. Very solid.  D- It's so complex, yet goes down so easily. If it weren't for its potency, I could treat this as a meal in itself. I'd definitely go back to this beer.  Overall- I drank this one in a celebratory mood and it did not disappoint. This is a very solid beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,JonMich13,3.54,"A = Poured black/brown with a tinge of amber. Very little head on this one and no lacing.  S = This had me hoping. Smell was very sweet and inviting. Nice fruity (plum, prune maybe?) with kind of a buttery undertone. Some malt there, too.  T = Not sure if this is typical, but had a very unpleasant sourness that suppressed what seemed like some potential trying to come out. I could taste some sweet fruity notes in the background, but this weird sour tartness overrode everything. Did I get a skunked bottle?  M = Nothing special. Low carbonation. Not too thick or chewy. A little wattery it seemed.  D = If not for the unpleasant taste, wouldn't be too hard to drink.  Not impressed by this, but hope I got a bad bottle. Will not be seeking it again, but if I come across it I will give it another shot to see whether I got a bad one this time.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,thekanna,4.52,"From notes taken earlier:  I went into this having somewhat moderate expectations, as most German beers tend to be a bit thin for me and I prefer the heavier Belgians. Boy, was I blown away by this one.  A: Nice pitch black that turns brown when held up to light.  S: Amazing scent: dark fruits, chocolaty sweet malts, roasted coffee. Slight hoppiness provides a little bit of bite; but nothing overwhelming.  T: All the markings of a great quadrupel without the alcohol kick. The taste of alcoholic molasses and sugary bread pervades this amazing doppelbock. Like eating a great European chocolate biscuit (pain au chocolat filling, maybe?), or a piece of caramel-filled Ghirardelli chocolate.  M: Extremely well-rounded, full-bodied; almost chewy.

Brew poured to a dark brown color with some ruby highlights that try to make an appearance. Has a good sized creamy tan head that has some retention and does leave some lacing. The aroma is malt and lots of it with molasses, brown sugar, toffee, slight chocolate and smoke. Also there seems to be a slight musty aroma. The flavors are very good with the malt giving many flavors roast, chocolate, smokiness, toffee with a slight fruit like taste. This brew goes down very easily which is scary based on a 7+ abv level. Very good brew though the price of it sure has come up over the years, but I guess everything has. Very enjoyable brew, get it when you can as I do not think you will be disappointed as long as you enjoy complex beers.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Nose: A rich malty caramel malts, with some melanoids and toasty notes. There are some plum and chocolate like aroma in the background of the beer.

Sweet malt hits the nose with a refreshing blast. A hint of hop bitterness and some biting acidity is noticeable. A roasty scent lingers in the background. Smells complex.  Taste is an acidic blast of dark chocolate up front, receding into a nice deep roasty malt profile. Sweet layers of malt coat the mouth, with a chocolatey-biscuit finish. (I can see how monks would survive on this during a fast!)  Mouthfeel is very slick. Low carbonation makes it exceptionally creamy and slips down easy. Fantastic.  Drinkability-Great.

Poured a thick, dense, khaki colored head that slowly dissipated leaving a moderate amount of lacing. A sweet malt aroma with a touch of roast noticed. The flavor delivers on the promises that the aroma made to you. The roasted malt flavors are more pronounced. A smooth, full, well-rounded body that is very pleasant and fulfilling.

The smell is of roasted chocolatey malt, a dark bready smell (possibly rye), some raisin, and a hint of the alcohol. Very nice indeed!  has a big, heavy and sweet dark fruit taste. Raisin, possibly prune and or plum? Good mix of caramel, toffee, and bready goodness. You can taste the alcohol, but not to the point that it detracts from the overall drinking experience. It is sweet up front with a nice bitter hop finish. The balance is good and the body is a bit higher than medium, but not quite full, if that makes sense.  This is a top notch bock! Good complexity and balance. I would highly recommend.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,lacqueredmouse,4.51,"Absolutely amazing pour, like an inverted cascade effect, with the body straying into the head and then settling out. Amazing. Body is a really deep ruby red colour with a thick head of beige tight bubbles. Just amazing. I've never seen such a cool looking pour from a bottle.  Huge malty richness on the nose - smells like brewday. Sweet and grainy, organic and rich. Quite dark as well, but just with grain notes, no hints of alcohol or dark fruit. Very nice.  Very malty on the palate too, with a delicious dark roasted notes. Lovely. Stays quite sweet with dark organic notes at the front. It's only once you swallow that the darker notes of carbonised toast and charcoal come through. And it's not overpowering - this lovely sweet grain character stays the course. Just a delicious beer, wonderfully balanced and sippable. Mouthfeel is quite light, but that's good for this beer - once again, it walks a narrow course between roasted heaviness and light sweetness. Really great.  This is a very, very good beer - it's not extreme, it's just extremely well made. There's a really refined character to it; everything is in perfect proportions. It leaves it amazingly drinkable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S - Huge aroma of sweet malt and ripe fruit including raisins, cherries, and plums was extremely inviting. I could not wait to taste this one.  T - The taste did not disappoint. Malt sweetness is noticeable from the start and is nicely complimented by the flavor of raisin, cherry, and plum. Finish had a slight metallic aftertaste that quickly vanished leaving the palate clean and making me anxious for another sip. Alcohol presence is completely masked by the robust flavor, but provides a nice warm sensation.  M - Mouthfeel is smooth and light with noticeable, but pleasant carbonation.  D - This beer is extremely pleasant to drink. Given the masking of the alcohol content, it would be easy to have too many.  Overall, I think this beer lives up to its billing.

S: Butterscotch melded with more bitter molasses and leafy hops with sweet raisins and plums from prodigious malting create a full aroma  T: Dark fruits and toffee accented with coffee and light milk chocolate flavors, hint of acrid molasses and finished with butterscotch and some leafy hops.

Wow! Was it worth it. This is probably the best beer I've ever had. The flavor is intense, complex, but not overpowering. And I was particularly impressed with the smoothness of the beer.

Nice and rich malt and bread scents  t - very complex. coffee up front that moves into a smooth malt with a sour and slightly bitter finish. I'm tasting a little sweet cola on the swallow right before the alcohol pokes its head out briefly.  m - full bodied. Nice light carbonation.  d - more of a sipper as double bocks go. I can see the appeal. Drinks like a meal. The sour hit right underneath the tongue has me salivating for the next sip. It's relatively mild 6.7% ABV is perhaps a little more apparent than other beers but doesn't take away from the experience. I'd probably stop at one glass given its rich overtones. I probably could have done with a single bottle vs. the four-pack that I purchased at a premium.  The ad campaign certainly adds to its standing.

Little to no lace or streaking.  Aroma is of primarily dark, dried fruits (raisins, dates and prunes) with sweet caramel malt, toffee, and possibly a touch of anise.  A malt bomb. Big sweet caramel, raisins, toffee, and some coffee flavors blend to form a syrupy body. Not overly thick, but slick and syrupy. Medium to full body with a good amount of warming.

The taste was just as exceptional with a little warmth from the alcohol. However, that is when it started to fall apart. The beer started to develop almost a bitter metalic aftertaste that continued for an extended period of time. It certainly did not finish clean. Also, the mouthfeel was a little thin.  Given everyone else's positive review, I will probably try the beer again in case I got a bad bottle, but the poor after taste was a big turn off.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,tlinner,4.57,"I just realized I've never reviewed this gem. Nutty, roasted malt throughout. Very complex taste. Some notes of sweetness, but very ""dark"", like bread or dark fruit. Someone who hated it once told me it tastes like dead leaves. It doesn't, but that's not really far off, in a weird way. Nice substantial feel to it, like you're drinking a real man's beer. Absolutely on my Top-5 All Time list. Plus, the little goats make great Christmas tree ornaments.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Flavor is sweet,earthy, rich, and malty with chocolate, some coffee, some roast. A caramelly sweet finish with mild notes of spicy hop bitterness and wood smoke that linger at the dry finish.

39,131,rslomin,4.77,"Tasted the beer in a trapist ale glass  color: dark, coca-cola like color, nice little brown head smell: at first, like freshly baked dark bread, then gives a caramel and burnt sugar smell, followed by a marzipan and rum smell, and finally a bit of smokiness. Taste: dark bread, dark chocolate. Mouthfeel: Very smooth beer, has a slight bit of bitterness.  Overall: A great beer that that is certainly worthy of it reputation!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,nrpellegrini,4,"Pours a dark cloud brown color with a nice tan head that lasts a while. Smells of sweet malts, similar to a brown ale. Tastes similar, a very sweet malty beer with a smooth nutty roasted flavor. Mouth was very smooth and drinkability was the same, I could of had a couple of these. For the price I won't be looking for this beer again... and the taste for that matter. There are just better dopplebocks than this one...

39,131,steelerguy,4.82,"A - Poured a very nice dark chocolate color, that remained translucent in the tulip I used. Nice 2 finger head that faded quickly to just a covering on the top with a ring around the glass.  S - What a great malt smell, one of the best aromas from a beer I have ever smelled. You can really smell the darker crystal malts used, a great caramel and toffee like aroma with a slight hop presence.  T - Wow! I was expecting it to be a little more over the top, but the balance of this beer is superb. The malt really shines in this brew, so clean with a chocolate and caramel flavors dominating. Finishing with some dark fruit flavors and a great hop bitterness.  M - Great feel, there are quite a few unfermented sugars in here, really gives this a nice full feel.  D - So well balanced that it is almost dangerously drinkable. You could drink a couple too many of these before you knew what hit you. The alcohol really takes a back seat to all the wonderful flavors, but it is there, and you will feel it!  I am normally an ale man, love the complex flavors of them. This is hands down the best lager not to mention bock I have had. All the complexity of a great ale, yet still crisp and clean. If I had to pick one work to describe this beer it would be balance...if I were allowed two...perfect balance. If you have not had this beer get it, you will love it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Good head retention That sticks like a web to the side of the glass. Smell is slighty chocolatey. Taste is fairly light but smooth with hints of cocoa. Medium bodied mouthfeel. I could put away quite a few of these. A solid beer that I could see myself enjoying more over time.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Schwarzwald,4.88,"This is one easy drinking beer. Great flavor and color, typical doppelbock colors. The head is really nice and smooth, really nice feel in the mouth. It really has some depth with some oak flavors and smoothness. Once again, like most of my reviews, great with German cheese and crackers or bread. Yes, there are other cheeses, but why change. This beer is my constant goto beer. Just pour it in and enjoy!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,superdedooperboy,4.23,"Served at Aroma's Cafe and Wine Bar in Augusta, GA. Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a mug.  Pours deep chestnut-mahogany, with reddish highlights when held to the light. The thick, fluffy, light brown head reaches a high peak before settling slowly, clinging nicely to the sides of the glass.  A thick, sweet, malty aroma fills the nose, with notes of toffee and chocolate. Some light herbal hop notes make their way through as well.  Full-bodied, with a rich and chewy mouthfeel, flavors of sweet caramel, toffee, and chocolate dominate the palate. Hop presence is minimal, with some herbaceous, slightly bitter hop notes balancing things out in the middle. Finishes with a thick, lingering sweetness, but one that is far from cloying.  A delicious drinker, and seemingly less-filling than many Doppelbocks out there, though perhaps owing to its minimalist serving size; either way, it retains all of the characteristics that make the style great, with the ubiquitous plastic Bock to go along with it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,joshuadlight,4,"Almost black until held up to a light source which reveals that the beer is not completely devoid of translucence. The head is pretty light compared to the color of the liquid and doesn't last long. This is indicative of the lack of carbonation throughout.  I thought the smell and taste transformed twice while I was drinking it. At first, the smell and taste were a not overly pleasant buttermilk biscuit. But it got sweeter and sweeter in the mouth and nose as it warmed until it was not unlike a cinnamon roll. Then this soon gave way to feel and taste that was eerily reminiscent of wine with more and more alcohol showing up.  Overall, I thought it was very solid, but not spectacular. I'll drink it again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,donkeyrunner,4.46,"Dark brown/ruby colored. Thin dirt brown head that vanishes instantly. In fairness, it's been in the cellar awhile.  Smell is constantly changing. Sweet dark fruit, winey grape smell, molasses, dark roast malt, unfremented sugar. There's a lot here.  Dark, complex, well-balanced and evolving, Celebrator tastes like Black Sabbath sounds. Dark roast, black forest cake malt and caramel with unfermented fruity sugars. A hint of woody hop tang at the end. Nonexistant carbonation with a thick mouthfeel. Winey alcoholic warming. I dream of this beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Vengeance526,4.56,"Poured into a pilsner glass.  Pours a dark, almost completely opaque black color with a thick and creamy 2-3 finger tan head that retains nicely and leaves a great amount of beautiful lacing.  Aroma of chocolate and roasted malt with some butterscotch in the background. Mildly sweet and extremely inviting.  Taste reveals notes of chocolate, raisins, butterscotch, coffee and some figs. Very rich and really quite amazing.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. It's just a work of art the way this one works its way around the palate.  Alcohol is fairly low in comparison to some other doppelbocks so this is actually really easy to drink. Usually I wouldn't want to have more than one of this style in one setting, but I think this may be the exception. The king of doppelbocks and always worth having one on hand.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Tone,4.33,"Pours a dark black color. 1/2 inch head of a light tan color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of lager yeast and some earthy malts. The overall aroma characteristics are quite muted. Fits the style of a Doppelbock. Smooth and crisp mouth feel with average carbonation levels present. Tastes of good lager yeast, smooth yet distinct earthy malts, and the hop bitterness is noticeable. There is also a chocolaty richness that is quite extraordinary. This is one hell of a smooth lager family beer (includes bocks, etc.)!. Definitely worth a try.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ajr24,4.38,"Served in its appropriate glassware at The Belgian Cafe, this beer was quite a treat for a first timer. Dark, malty and plum colored body with a voluminous and creamy white head. Smells earthy, grainy, and exudes some hints of drupaceous fruits- like plum and prunes mixed with some fig. Its appearance and smell combine perfectly to deliver the drinker with pure, unadulterated, quality doppelbock. Taste and mouthfeel though are what make this beer great; from the glass it ensconces your tongue and mouth in its velvety consistency. The 6.7% ABV stays pretty dormant while drinking making it into a pretty drinkable beer. Just watch out because sooner or later the ABV will come out of hiding.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Aenema,4.4,"Appearance - Pours black with a a reddish brown tint when held to a light. Topped by a short tan head. Smell - Roasted malts, coffee and cocoa. Taste - Rich waves of flavor, chocolate, coffee and toffee. Great roasted malts. Truly mouth-watering. Mouthfeel - Very smooth with fairly light carbonation. This coats your mouth with flavor without a heavy, syrupy feel. Drinkability - For a beer with the tremendous richness and coating mouthfeel, this is incredibly drinkable.

This is the most exceptional Doppelbock I have ever experienced. The flavor and aroma from this Beer is beyond description, suffice it to say it is as near to perfection as I have tasted.  Bocks and Dark Beers are my favorites and this is the best Dark Beer that I have had to date. Thanks to my friend John who brought this one back from a trip. I will be purchasing Celebrator on my next trip to Pensacola.  I stopped by Four Winds in Pensacola Fl and bought all that they had on the shelf.

39,131,CoolJosh,4.17,"Had this one at Zeno's, Sampled at the German tasting, and was drawn to this beer by the little dangling horse...  It poured a clear dark amber brown, with a very beautiful khaki colored head that retains fairly nicely. There was still head present on my last sips, and I never expected this from a German beer before.  The smell is fantastic. Tons of chocolate oozes out, with strong malt characteristics as well. There is a nice sweetness and a buttery scent leading to both brown sugar and raisins. Simply irresistible, very pleasing scent.  I couldn't wait for this to splash on my tongue, and was not disappointed. Everything that was there in the smell was tastable as well. The start is very sweet with a contrasting nice subtle bitterness. Very nice doppelbock, which really hit the spot.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Not sure I'd call it lacing, but there are some clumpy bubbles that cling to the glass.  Wow, big aroma. Deep and dark. Sweet and you can sense the thickness of the beer right from here. A sense that is confirmed shortly after.  Maple, molasses, dark caramel. Some cocoa notes. Layers of malty goodness. Wonderful and rich.  The mouth feel is completely full bodied. This is about as thick as you can get.. Yet not cloying or overly done.  Nicely drinkable and smooth.. Although you can't have a bunch of these.

39,131,roadhouse,4.47,"Poured from 11.2 oz. bottle into a pilsener glass.  Pours a deep brown that appears much more red when held up to light. Tan two finger head that leaves a nice cap on top. Nice lacing as well.  Aroma is dominated by a sweet caramel maltiness that has deep complexity. Also noted was a very strong raisiny fruit character and some toasted malts.  Taste is quite sweet up front with lots of caramel that is quickly joined by the raisiny character. There's also a mild roasted component towards the end in this that's stronger than most Doppelbocks, probably correlating with the slightly darker color. The finish is reminiscent of dark chocolate covered raisins with a tiny bit of spiciness thrown in.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a nice chewiness to it, and a crisp feel on the palate.  It's been way too long since I've had one of these. Easily one of the best Doppelbocks out there, certainly in the top 3 for me. Worth every penny.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Invitingly sweet nose of coffee ice cream, caramel, butterscotch and chocolate covered raisins, blends in banana, ginger spice, pecans, all malt with no real hoppiness, very well balance nostril presence and staying power. Medium-bodied, the carbonation definitely smoothes out the sweetness and allows for more structural balance from the hops.

Taste is excellent, very smooth, roasty-- sweet yet complex. Syrupy sweetness and chocolately aftertaste. Mouthfeel is almost perfect. If anything, the carbonation seemed a little off, but really a delicious beer. I would say this compares very well to the Andechser Doppelbock, but with slightly different qualities.

Smell is very complex. Raisins and molasses definitely in the forefront, with a hint of cocoa powder, nuts, smoke, and alcohol in the back. Very nice. The smoke adds a great element to this.  The taste is of roasted, smoked malts with caramel and chocolate. But what really hits me in the face is the raisins (and possibly dates) - it's outstanding. The alcohol is not well masked, but it definitely adds character. The combination between the smoke, raisins, and alcohol just hits the nail on the head. It also has a bitter characteristic that most dopplebocks don't have, and it's welcoming.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with low end carbonation. It's slightly syrupy with a smooth and rich feel.

Some chocolate and faint alcohol. Also faint smell of fruit, maybe banana. Not much smell on the hop side.  First taste is of oak burnt malts. Little bits of coffee and banana also. Hops are present but the malts really dominate. There is also after taste of alcohol and some bitterness. Lots of different flavors coming through  Beer is way over carbonated which messes up the smoothness. Beer is rich with medium thickness going down.  Over all, really enjoyed this beer.

39,131,damienblack,4.45,"Pours a dark purplish brown, nice and creamy brown head. Plenty of nice looking lacing. Smells like earthy, tart fruit, like a dark plum. With plenty of malts.  First impression: Not quite as sweet as I had imagined. Tangy on the tongue, a sweet malt up front, but quickly zings into tartness with like a sour plum flavor. Also hoppier than I figured from my imagination and the smell. Regardless, the bitterness doesn't linger, but there's a little bit of pleasant cloying. Actually, as it warms, it further reduces the bitterness and increases the sweetness a bit. In the end, the bitterness is an afterthought compared to the encompanying malts. Almost roastiness in the mouthfeel. The longer the sip, the fuller the malt experience. Medium-full bodied and creamy, and very drinkable. Pleasantly carbonated. A little let down on the flavor, possibly because my expectations were so high, but the other aspects of my sensory perception do not disagree.

I bought a four-pack a week or so before Christmas; My kids had great fun hanging the little plastic Rams on our tree.  You know, I'm not sure if I just got a couple of bad bottles or if this style is just not for me, but the first bottle out, I quite liked. It was kind of sweet and malty, smelled great, felt nice going down--quite satisfying.  Then the next bottle was entirely disappointing. There was a slightly funky smell to it, and an even funkier taste. Bottle #3 was the same. I couldn't bring myself to even open Bottle #4. Did I finally experience skunked beer?

A= After an aggressive pour straight down the center of the glass, this beer appeared a rich, dark brown with cola colored highlights around the edges. The creamy tan head rose 2"" and then slowly dropped to a thin cap, leaving some spotty lace on the glass.  S= Incredible aromas of sweet bready malts, some toasted grain, molasses, treacle, a small bit of raisin, and mild alcohol. Very aromatic for a lager style beer.  T= This was a malt bomb of a doppelbock. Big malty base up front with a chewy, fresh baked dark bread character that was incredible. That was followed by the dark sugary molasses and faint raisins found in the aroma. The hop character was both unexpected and wonderful through the middle and finish of this one. Not bitter per se, but more grassy and earthy. Spicy alcohol capped this array of flavors like icing on a cake.  MF= Heavy side of medium bodied, with a creamy mouthfeel. The carbonation level was only moderate, and I think this beer could use just a pinch more.  D= This is a hell of a good beer.

39,131,johnnnniee,4.42,"Pours a solid dark brown with orange/red highlights when held to light. Stingy beige head dissipates quickly to form a cap and light lacing on the sides. Very malty nose. Caramel, brown sugar, plums, berries and a touch of alcohol. Taste of caramel and raisins up front followed but some nice fruity notes, dark pitted fruit, finishing with a long lingering molasses. Mouthfeel is creamy body is medium to thick, carbonation is ample. Beautiful Bock! Very complex.

39,131,gameface23,3.98,"NOTE: I am not a fan of Doppelbocks and usually not a fan of malt in general, but this was pretty damn good. Although I didn't enjoy it as much as an IIPA or the like, I still respect it for being exceptional within it's style.  Pours a dark brown with a great looking tan head. Smells of malt, raisins and molasses and maybe some very faint smokiness. Taste hides the alcohol well, with notes of malt.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,cleeze,4.32,"Time for a celebration, bitches!  Pours a dark almost black color with a nice fluffy tan head. Little lacing.  Smelled rather fruity. Sweet Molasses up in there as well. Also some great maltage!  Dark malts explode. Yummy mixture with the sweet dark fruits.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,tmoneyba,4.2,"Poured a huge creamy light brown head that last the complete brew with good lacing. Aroma of heavy malt, caramel and nutty. Full creamy body with soft carbonation. Flavor was moderate to heavy sweet dark fruit with a fruity bittersweet finish of long duration.  Very good brew.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,DoShek,4.83,"Appearance - poured with a finger and a half of tan head, brown with hints of ruby around the edges, head dissipates after a couple of minutes to a thin layer  Smell - malts all the way here, toasty, slight chocolate, bit of dark fruit  Taste - quick hit of bitterness upfront which quickly moves out of the way to let the malts do their dance, toasted flavor comes in strong at the back end providing the outro for the sip. As it warms bitterness subsides to almost nothing and the toasted flavor becomes even more prominent  Mouthfeel - full, but not thick, smooth  Drinkability - dangerously drinkable. I had to consciously take it slow with this one because it goes down way to easy. My only regret is not having more available.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,PEBKAC,4.18,"Bottle from September, stored in my mini-fridge. Odd little production notches at the bottom, but no corresponding letters or numbers to compare them to.  Fifteen minutes sitting, poured into one of Ommegang's tulip/snifter hybrid glasses. Two inches of cola suds, cascading down after barely a minute. Sporadic lace. (Barely enough time to play with the little plastic goat.) A thick oily-ebony color, with edges ruby-hued.  A super rich whiff of molasses, raisins, teriyaki, & dates. The alcohol trails with a permeated, lingering smoke. Some anise & coco finish off the toasted end. A little too much here; haven't even tasted it yet.  Taste is bready & reminiscent of pumpernickel. Slight, slight banana esters. Bitter chocolate & a slight metallic tone to it all. Lots of residual sugars without ever getting sticky or thick. Lightly bitter bark-like flavors, some stale coffee, & again, a bit of smoke.  Subtle carbonation is a big plus for me. The alcohol never acts alone, as it's always macerating in some flavorful aspect of the brew, & avoiding any upfront confrontations. Creamy, but without any hint of lactose. A touch of ""licking your fingers while turning the newspaper"" dryness right at the end.  Very savory, but the smokiness deters me from more then I want to consume. Just lighter in body then other doppelbocks. I think I prefer this one colder then most. It hides more of its diabetic & less familiar qualities that way, while still remaining succulent.  :)",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Riccymon,4.16,"Poured black though not quite opaque from the 330mL bottle. About one finger of brown head resulted and quickly dissipated. I found some nuttiness/malt in the aroma, which actually seemed really muted, though perhaps I was a little congested. First sip was deliciously roasty, and I tasted coffee notes. As I continued through the glass, the malt and nutty flavors stood out more. While very tasty, I found the high note of Celebrator to be its perfect, creamy mouthfeel. I'm happy to have tried Celebrator at last, and I'd gladly drink a couple of these in a sitting.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,CHSLBrew,4.4,"Poured into a pint glass.  A-Pours a dark brown beer, which appears to be clear. With the degree of darkness, though, the only light coming through is in some ruby highlights. Light-brown head, large off the pour, then reduces slowly to a consistent layer, sticking around for a bit.  S-Toasty, biscuity malts, with some hints of chocolate. Hearty and malt-centric.  T-Malty, biscuity, with a bit of malty sweetness. Chocolate comes through, as in the aroma. A slight hop bitterness appears prior to the finish, along with a slight, smooth alcohol flavor. Crisp and clean on the finish.  M-Medium body and medium carbonation. Slides pleasantly around my mouth. There is almost an alcoholic warmth trying to emerge, which surprised me, considering the 6.7% ABV. However, it's definitely there, and it lingers for a bit after the finish.  D-This has great drinkability. Smooth and enjoyable flavors, easy to drink. Many of its characteristics are appropriate to style, but beyond the technicalities, it tastes great.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

This is a classic doppelbock but I must say, since venturing into the world of craft and extreme beers, I'm not compelled to buy more than a few bottles of this years offering.  A: Brown mahogony look with Red overtones, pours a small off white head.  S: Smells of smoke and malt.  T: Taste is smooth, first smoky sweet malt, then alcohol then the alcohol and a bit of bitter.  M: Mouthfeel is thin to medium.  D: Easy to drink at least two of these, the beer is smooth and the 6.7% is not apparent.  This is a classic reliable doppelbock for sure but I am spolied by todays variety of offerings.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Had to dump it! My pal brewdog hates me for this.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,chaz410,3.72,"Poured a dark black body with a tan head. Smell is smokey, almost like bbq, and a small hint of sweet malts. Taste is sweet malts with lots of smokey undertones. The smokey hints are more of the meat, jerky-like variety than smoked or roasted coffee. This is not a smokey stout by any means, it definately has lager character and has layers of sweet smokey notes. A good beer, a good dark lager, and unlike most beers in this category.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,jpiper,4.1,"Poured from a 330ml bottle into a Celebrator 0.3l glass.  4. Dark brown with caramel around the edges and a white head. The head quickly dissipates to a slight ring around the edge.  4. Smell is strongly of roasted malts - chocolate with lesser amounts of toffee and coffee. There is a slight fruity component (raisins) to it as well. Very, pleasant.  4. Taste is more of the smell, roasted chocolate malts with caramel and toffee. There's a bit of a tootsie roll flavor to this beer. There just a hint of bitterness at the back end to balance, but the roasted malts shine through. The finish is moderately long with a slight spiciness to it.  4. The mouthfeel is smooth and a bit sticky. Medium bodied.  4.5. This beer is just a touch too decadent to be a session beer. But that's its fault. I could several of these and not get tired of it.  A wonderfully balanced malt bomb. Definitely one of my favorites and a perennial stand-by beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ChainGangGuy,3.92,"10 oz. - $4.75 at The Porter Beer Bar in Atlanta, Georgia.  Appearance: Clear, dark brownish-red body with a thin, very thin, white head.  Smell: Sweet-smelling, raisin-packed aroma full of heavy caramel overtones. Slighter hints of fresh grain and unsweetened chocolate.  Taste: Sweet, caramel-covered grains followed by tons of raisin fruitiness. Minor chocolate hint. A few gingerbread crumbs. Light spicy hops and bitterness. More alcohol than you'd expect from 6.7% creeps into the semi-sweet, fruity finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation. Sticky mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Ayinger's Celebrator Doppelbock, while we've had some wonderful times together, isn't exactly my favorite d-bock out there.

39,131,SerieDNo3,4.85,"11.2 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass (making do with what I can while I'm not with my own glassware)  A: Pours a dark ruby-brown with minimal light getting through. Tan one-finger head that dissipates quickly, leaving a very thin film. Minimal lacing. Looks a bit like coffee.  S: Roasty, malty aroma with a bit of alcohol on the nose.  T: God-like. Notes of coffee and a bit of molasses, and various malt flavors. Not as sweet as other doppelbocks I've had; the malts are a bit more bitter.  M: Obviously thicker than a lot of beers, in tune with the style, but not as syrupy as many doppelbocks. Low carbonation, and feels a bit like coffee.  D: If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, this would be on my short list of choices. I've had it in hot Chicago and DC summers before, and it's very drinkable even then. It's a perfect balance between the heavy/thick character a doppelbock is supposed to have and a lightness that lends itself well to continued drinking.  I don't think the English language is sufficient to describe how excellent this beer is. Simply phenomenal.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Wackyfoot,4.5,"11.2 oz bottle from Market of Choice in Eugene. Beautiful reddish-brown pour with a nice tannish head.

39,131,WalrusJockey,4.58,"330ml bottles into Ayinger Celebrator branded glasses. These are Pils glasses, I think?  Appearance- in the branded glasses, it is literally picturesque. Dark, dark brown, with golden-red highlights, and a golden-tan head. Beautiful. The head falls eventually, but all throughout the glass the lacing is significant.  Smell- chocolate-roasted malt, and lots of it. A hint of alcohol sent, and what I guess is a spice-smelling yeast. Primarily the cocoa, and it is very enticing.  Taste- wonderful chocolate flavors from the malt. Ranging from a medium-dark-chocolate, to a full on cacao flavor, all over the spectrum of high quality, rich chocolate flavors, washed down with a splash of coffee. On flavor alone, it reminds me of Brooklyn Black Chocolate stout, only it tastes much better.  Mouthfeel- thought the beer pours with a respectable head, and maintains it fairly well, there isn't a ton of carbonation on the palate, leaving this beer silky, smooth, and creamy. It isn't flat, by a long shot, and the amount of malt flavor suggests that if it were it would be wretched, but the carbonation is balanced, and modestly understated.  Drinkability- very high. Most beers with very strong flavor profiles I could not have several of in a day. This is strongly flavored, but I could drink 2 or 3 tonight, easily, and want more this weekend.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,JBogan,4.15,"Pours a dark brown with a one finger tan head which leaves good lacing behind. Pretty good looking brew.  Smells of malts and perhaps some licorice. Very inviting blend.  Tastes follow the nose here. Malts dominate, along with small amounts of licorice and maybe even a hint of coffee. Some dark fruits (fig, raisin, dates) make an appearance along with a hint of alcohol as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel was thinner than I expected, yet smooth. Small amount of carbonation, but the right amount for a beer of this style.  This is an enjoyable beer, although I wouldn't want more than one or two at a sitting. Not my favorite style, but for what it is, it's pretty good.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,cpn920,4.68,"Pours a dark ruby/brown with a quickly dissipating tannish head. The smell is definitely one of a malt aroma.

I love this beer and is without question a worldclass doppelbock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,RicoBrew,4.85,"A- Pours out a nice dark brown color. If you hold it up to the light, it reflects a ruby color. The head is nice, light, and lacy. It lingers for a bit, but fades after a few minutes to a thin off-white top.  S- Hints of malt come through along with ""christmas-like"" fruits. Plums, dates, a hint of cherry. A little bit of yeast spice comes through, but it's fleeting.  T- It starts out with a dark malt taste, but none of the bitterness of a dark malt. That note fades to more of a dark fruit flavor as the brew lingers on the tongue. The amount of flavor notes that come through is staggering. I'm sure people can write whole treatises on different flavors from this beer. It's a fantastically complex brew.  M- It's extremely light for a doppelbock. It seems to want to play on your tongue for an extended period and then vanish. You definitely always want more of this beer.  D- You could go through a whole case of this and enjoy every moment of it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

It poured with a large, long lasting, light tan head.  s: Wow, sweet, slightly smoky, malts that smell of almost burned brown sugar or molasses. There are also hints of dark fruits and a little alcoholic heat.  t: I had no idea this is what a doppelbock could be. I might have to go back and lower some scores elsewhere because nothing I've had comes close to this. Mildy sweet and slightly smoky malts with flavors of chocolate, nutty coffee, and maybe some mild fruits thrown in. There are layers here beyond my ability to describe.  m: The carbonation was long lasting and ceamy.  d: I'm just stunned by how good this is.

Poured with a 2 finger tan/brown head with about average retention but good lacing.  S: booming malt aroma as you lift the glass up; combines molasses, sweet bread, toast, honey.  T: the malt booms in the flavor like it does in the aroma. A powerful combination of molasses, honey, caramel, toasted malt, and baked bread dominate throughout, with a slight noble hop bitterness at the end that combines with a touch of smoke and slight dry alcohol. That touch of smoke is subtle yet extremely satisfying. This is the Led Zeppelin of doppelbocks.  M: heavy, chewy, creamy, and viscous at the same time. low to medium carbonation allows the malt flavors to be expressed.  D: enjoyed this as a dessert beer. I would have a difficult time having another, and found my palate almost exhausted after the huge malt assault.

The aroma has some what of a fruity smell to it. Almost like a banana and clove aroma. Taste is very smokey. It's a very hard flavor to distinguish, but it resembles some sort of grape that may have been roasted or something.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Leaves a very dry aftertaste in the mouth. Carbonation level is low.  Overall, this wasn't something that appealed to me very much. I had much higher expectations for this beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,HalfFull,3.65,"Pours a deep amber brown/red into a pint glass with a thin off-white head, which settles into a thin lacing.  Smell is typical of sweet German malts, offering a bit of roasted nuts. Otherwise typical of any bock style, yet offers a bit more depth as well.  Taste follows with sweet malts, slightly chewy and lingering, yet rather simple in the malts department and yet rather expected. I'm surprised this brew rates so highly as I find it just a slight variant of many a ---bock.  Decent feel with light carbonation and a sweet and lingering viscous finish. Drinkability suffers from the rich malty sweetness yet a nice winter brew in moderation. But then I live in San Diego and not in snow country, so I don't see myself revisiting soon.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

There may be a hint of herbal hops lingering in the back. It has a medium body and a smooth mouth feel. While the aroma provided malt, the flavor provides hops. This is what was lurking beneath this malty veneer! The bitterness is all that remains in the aftertaste. (rated Jan 30, 2007)",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Good clean finish, typical of most German offerings. Considering this is one of the highest ranking Doppelbock, would like to have seen more of all the usual dopplebock components, not just a moderate balance of them.

39,131,Duffman,4.08,"A deep and robust reddish brown beer with a head the color of creamy coffee. Simply gorgeous and highly notable.  Rich velvety aroma. Black licorice I want to say. There is something to it I can't quite describe, can't quite make out but it is distinct, festive (smells a bit like the holidays, and maybe not unlike Bechorovka Czech liqueur). Spiced fragrance, potpurri, perhaps even a tad medicinal. Nutty, spiced, raisins, sherry, cream. Decadent and diverse.  More of the same. Some honey sweetness in the flavour profile notably absent from the nosing. Ends with a good degree of spice and fragrant twang with a bit of saltiness as well. I almost want to say a bit like jagermeister. Highly distinct this beer, with regards to any style I've ever had.  A nice, smooth, medium-bodied beer. There is a sheen to this beer, it has a unique texture to fit its nose and flavour palate. It has a lingering hold on the tongue, and on the mouth. Impressive.

Raisins, dates, figs, chocolate covered cherries and a slight dampness/mustiness on the nose - quite complex. Similar tastes - nuts, mild chocolate and good maltiness. The finish along with the creaminess of this beer is fantastic - the aftertaste easily lasts for a few minutes. Very drinkable stuff and the first German beer to wow me in a long, long time.

Very nice strong smell of dark dried fruits from the malt.  Taste is not exactly my cup of tea, although I give it credit for its strong complex flavors. Licorice and burnt malt flavors come through. Keep this one out about 45 minutes before drinking, as its much better when its warmer.   Heavy mouthfeel with a bit of acidic aftertaste. I'm not digging the aftertaste so much, which also affects its drinkability. I sipped on this one for a long time, and I didn't feel like grabbing another.

Earthy malts with licorice and a light espresso touch. Smooth creamy caramel finds it's way into the background. Finishes like a Latte due to the light foam residing on the top of the beer, which is remenisant of a roasted marshmellow.  A richly complex and balanced beer that I would love to always have on hand. Tastes even better in my Celebrator glass.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S - Deep, dark rum-soaked red fruits and fig. Nice and sweet with alohol esters smoothing things out. Sweet malts stick in your nose.  T&M - So much like the smell. So incredibly malty up front with the sweet rum-soaked dark fruits sliding in and then the slick alcohol to close. So delicious. Impeccable flavor has me savoring each and every sip.  D - I could drink this all day if it wouldn't leave me wasted after the 3rd or 4th glass.  This is a fantastic brew and I wish I had an endless supply. I drank two of these about a month apart before reviewing and I liked it even better the second time. Perfect on a cold day and MUST be at cellar temperature.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Very malty taste with a little bit of hoppyness behind it to begin balancing it out, but the malt still wins big time. A bit smoky and sweet with a smooth malt aftertaste. Great to sip on and relax with, but so good I can see myself drinking it too quickly. I also really like the classic German bottle.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Really complex aroma- begins with raisins but deepens into a rich smoke and citrus fruit. F-ing dope. I'm a malt person so my first sip of this was heaven. Not overly strong like Optimator, but bready with a good alcohol and raisin base. Super rich mouthfeel with just enough carbonation. Some beers have different characteristics that seem very separate from each other but everything about this beer comes together into one. The alcohol is very faint here too, but just enough to give it some character. Here's to my 100th review! I'd go more in depth but I'm enjoying beers with friends, as they should be enjoyed, but I""ll be grabbing a case of this later.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,nick76,3.68,"The aroma is brown sugar, alcohol, herbs, coffee, toasted malt, and hops. The appearance is dark red/brown and the head is foamy. The flavor is caramel, coffee, raisins, chocolate, spice, nuts. The palate is just the right thickness for the style. The aftertaste is a bit acidic for my liking but overall it's very good.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,woolymammoth,4.85,"Cold bottle poured into chilled glass.  A deep crimson-brown when held up to the light, I had to only look at it to know that it was going to be incredible. This beer is on a level with few other beers. Larger-than-life, complex, and delicious.  Even with all the hype, this one still surprised me.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,gubbt,4.35,"Pours a dark brown with reddish hues around the edges and a tan head.  First thing that I detect is some smoke with tobacco leaf. Also in there is toasty malts and raisons.  Sweet overall with toast, caramel, raisons, figs, and a touch of smoke. Alcohol does not show at all. Finish has pretty good length. Very good balance of flavors.  Heavy side of medium, with good carbonation.  For the level of sweetness, it is effortless to drink. If you see this, and haven't had it, you must buy it. A classic and worth the hype. Bottoms up!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,kylephillips,4.03,"The color is an opaque, extremely dark brown. It has a creamy tan head. Lots of bubbles visible coming from bottom of glass.  It is sweet smelling with hints of chocolate.  This beer has light mouthfeel with medium carbonation.  The flavor is not particularly strong but it is a really smooth beer. Starts out with a little bit of sweet malt flavor, then a little chocolate. The aftertaste is rounded with with some bitterness.  Drinkability is decent on this one. It's a smooth beer, but not something I'm going to drink a lot of.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,glid02,4.67,"Finally revisited this bad boy at the Brick Store in Atlanta.  Pours a clear dark brown color with dark ruby highlights. The head is two-fingers of cocoa-colored foamy goodness that slowly recedes into a wispy layer of bubbles on top and a medium-sized ring around the glass. Lacing is decent.  Smells of molasses with hints of chocolate and biscuity malts.  Tastes great. Molasses and sweet malts up front followed by more robust malt flavors, roasted and bready, ending with a hint of dark chocolate and a bit of bitterness. Very well balanced, very complex.  Mouthfeel is good. There's a good thickness that combines with a grainy carbonation that really goes down easily.  Drinkability is good. I polished off one of these in a hurry, and the complexity is such that I could have three of these and find something new in each one of them.  Overall there's not much more I can say. This is a very complex beer that is very well done.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,hopdog,4.47,Bottle.  Another beer that I used to drink in mass when I was a teenager. Sitting here rating it brings backs the memories (or should I say lack of memories!). What a head! 90% of the glass poured a tan head. Color is a darker reddish brown. Malty sweet aroma and tastes. Caramel and dark fruits. Smooth and easy to drink.  Notes from 10/29/04,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,MisterClean,4.48,"Bottle from Bevmo  A - Dark auburn brown pour, nice mocha 2-fingered head, dissipates moderately and leaves a nice trail.  S - Honey, toffee, caramel, malts, and almost smells like dark Belgian candi sugars.  T - Wow! Excellent taste! Honey, toffee, caramel, and anise.  M - Balance in the mouthfeel leaves a chewy bitterness. Very carbonated and spicily hopped.  D - Almost perfect, but the mouthfeel could be improved.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Mosstrooper,4.46,"Poured from 11.2oz bottle into 19oz unbranded pilsner flute glass.  Appearance: Pours black with copper tones, with a large tan head.  Smell: All malts- sweet and roasted. Coffee and chocolate tones. The smell is very inviting.  Taste: Sweet at first, and finishes with roasted, coffee flavors. Very rich and flavorful.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, creamy, and smooth. Very slight carbonation.  Drinkability: Another beer hyped up a lot before I tried it and it more than lives up to its reputation. I paid $12 for a four pack of this which, for a college student, is rather steep. In this case, it was worth it. Not something I will buy regularly because of the price/availability, but something I would love to get again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BeerImmediately,4.52,"Rich, tan head presiding over a slightly copper-edged, black body.  Smell is simply outstanding - sweet molasses maltiness, with a touch of cinnamon.  Plenty of the syrup sweetness carrying over from the nose, followed by plenty of raisins and even a slight roasted coffee flavor.  Rich, full mouthfeel, but not the least bit overbearing.  Quite drinkable, indeed. Can't believe I've never had one of these before.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,corby112,4.36,"Draft at Teresa's in Wayne, PA  Pours a very dark brown with foamy tan head that forms a lacing that lasts throught the whole glass.

Very quaffable, smooth and easy to drink with malty chocolate flavor, caramel, toffee, and roasted malt.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,sweetbrew82,4.77,"Poured from a 330 ML bottle into a flute:  P: Pours a deep golden brown from the bottle. Sits dark brown in the glass and displays some golden reddish hues filtering in through the liquid around the outside of the glass. Forms a light tan head that dissipates to form a halo on top. Looks good so far!  A: Smells like a ton of toasted maltiness, with a bit of a fruity profile which is that of plums and grapes. A slight alcohol sting is also detected underneath it all.  T: This one is so damn tasty that I'm finding it hard to write this review without getting sidetracked. It's like Toucan Sam, it follows the nose. Toasted malts shine throughout, while the plum and grape flavors complement nicely to form a complex sensation on the palate. Not much alcohol in the initial taste, either. Extremely smooth, low carbonation on the dry finish that leaves an ever-so-slight alcohol tinge on the way down. This one is a champion in the taste department for sure!  M: Celebrator Doppelbock has a medium-bodied mouthfeel to it. It's rich, smooth, decadent, and cleanses your palate of all beer sins you may have previously committed in your life.  D: Through the roof in my book. I could drink these all night long, even though the 6.7% ABV is a little high to be considered an official ""session beer"" by some folks. Great QPR on this one as well. 330 ML of pure satisfaction in a bottle for only $2.49! Don't mind if I do.  Notes: This is one hell of a dopplebock, the best that I have had to date for sure. It smells great, invigorates the tongue with a deliciously malted toastiness that combines with the flavors of two of my favorite fruits, and is incredibly smooth. Add the great bang-for-your-buck value, and you've got a sure-fire winner. This is one that every avid beer drinker should try. Definitely a must-have! Now if you'll excuse me, I shall have another at once...",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,luvbeer,4.73,"It pours dark and thick with a very creamy thick head that is 3 fingers and lasts a long time in a nice cold frosty mug. The taste is very complex and delicious. It should be sipped slowly to enjoy every mouth full. It is my favorite beer except for Ommegang Abbey Ale which tastes very much like it. From now on, every time I go to totalwine (totalwine.com) my local watering hole, I will buy a few bottles of this beer without fail. If I thought I could brew my own beer and it could taste as good as this beer and cost less, (not that it costs that much because it doesn't), I would go through the trouble.

39,131,WYVYRN527,4.68,"The beer pours a beautiful dark mahogany, with an agressive cream colored head. The aroma is all malt, with hints of fruits, spice, and toast. The flavor is rich. Malty sweetness dominates, with toffee and fresh baked bread. The finish is very clean, with a slight hop character. Celebrator has a great silky mouthfeel, and is very easy to drink. This is a perfect example of the doppelbock style, and is definitely a benchmark.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A creamy eggshell khaki head sits atop the beer.  S: Very robust smell as I was expecting. A lot of figs, plums and raisins up front. Some munich malt, brown sugar, molasses and slight coffee follows.  T: Similar to the smell, and rather sweet. Tons of dark fruits and sweet caramel and brown sugar. A tad boozy, but not to the point of distraction.  Overall, a spectacular doppelbock.

T: Dark fruit sweetness--mainly raisins, but not as strong as, say, a quad, and a fair amount of malts. Finishes a little bit (hoppy?) bitter.

39,131,Zadok,4.3,"Poured a dark brown with a light tan head that dissipated quite quickly.  Smells of malts and dark fruits.  Very flavorful, tastes of many dark fruits and malt. Fruits to include raisins, cherries and maybe some dates. Also has a caramel quality.  Smooth mouthfeel with light carbonation. Slightly on the syrupy side.  Overall really quite tasty being that it isn't one of my favorite styles of beer but would definitely look forward to having again. A very drinkable sipper.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Very complex aroma here. Caramel too  Taste: Dark fruits dominate here. There is a apparent raisin flavor coming in. Very malty and very sweet and the alcohol taste is there, but not overpowering  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, and has a nice coating to it. Carbonation is certainly present, gives a crisp finish. Goes down well  Drinkability: Relatively low ABV for a doppelbock...it tastes great and goes down well. Recommended.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,SJI,4.83,"This strong lager just might be the ultimate beer - and I tend not to be a lagerhead. At 6.7% the ABV is at the low end of the range for Doppelbocks. So the alcohol presence is not overwhelming, as it can be with some versions of this style. The taste and appearance become one, as the smokey carmel sweetness is bespoken by the creamy tan head and dark reddish-brown body. Enjoy this one in a proper vessel - brandy snifter - to enhance its regal qualities.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,AgingWarrior,4.25,"Poured into a tulip glass. Very dark brown with some red highlights. Thin tan head that held up quite a long time and provided a fair amount of lacing.  Smells sweet and malty. A mixture of scents that are difficult to pick out. The smell of molasses becomes more evident as the beer warms up.  Tastes malty and sweet, a thick tasting beer with some chewiness to it. Good on the tip of the tongue, a slight alcohol taste in the middle with a sweet finish.  Love the way it feels in the mouth. Thick and creamy.  A very drinkable doppelbock. I only had the one, but it left me wanting more.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,TheMistler,4.57,"Poured the color of brownie batter, with some nice red highlights where light peaks through. A tan head, pouring to a pinkies' width and settling to hearty film and ring. Nice lacing.  The smell isn't entirely off from brownie batter either, especially the type I whip up that gets an extra sugar kick from maple syrup. A malty sweet nose, with a bevy of sugars and a kicker of caramel, but also distinct toasted notes. Another food item that randomly sprang to mind was a piece of toast with Nutella spread.  The flavors settle in, starting out light. Caramel malt, raisins and dark fruits. The roasted flavor and drying of having eaten a piece of overly-toasted dark bread, hint of coffee as well.  Medium body, well carbonated. Crisp but complex, the building taste ends up leaving a lot on your palate - none of it bad.

Head looks solid, but then does not stick around for long.  Rich malty aroma, like Grape Nuts, caramel, honey, and chocolate.  Tastes malty and sweet, with balancing roastiness and a faint herbal hop flavor. Grain, caramel, honey, chocolate, prune. Lingering chocolate and mild alcohol.  Rich smooth texture. Quite drinkable.

39,131,marcpal,3.74,"11.2oz bottle with the plastic goat hanging so intently. A dopplebock that has avoided me so I bought a pack recently.  A: Dark dark crimson with a tan thin head with lasting power. Bubbles are there to be found.  S: All dark fruit and burnt wood. Sweet flavors that are rounded softly but the woodiness. I actually like the smell far more than the taste.  T: Dark chocolate, raisins and malt. I dont get the same smoked wood flavor from the aroma. Dark chocolate and smoke in the beginning. May seem like blasphemy for such a style standard, but too sweet for my taste. Molasses and malts are surely complex but not crazy about it.  M: Medium body with a creamy texture. Carbonation is well pronounced but needed some bitterness.  D: By all means a well thought out, complex dopplebock. Too chocolatey and rich too go through several but it was one I was glad to finally give a try.

Pretty light tan head lasts for a bit then eventually falls to a nice slim coat. Course lacing all the while. Smells of dark fruit. It was a bit cold at serving so will get more as it warms. I smell a touch of vanilla as it warms. Tastes of sweet dark fruit, toasted malt, liqueur, butterscotch. Delicious Mouthfeel is medium, silky smooth. Low/medium carbonation with subtle bubbles.

39,131,ThreeWiseMen,3.81,"Poured into a .2L flute  Appearance: Pours a nearly opaque, dark chocolate-color with a quickly dissipating, fizzy, tan head. A lot of carbonation can be seen, especially near the surface.  Smell: Dark fruits and smoke are the first smells to jump out at me. Definitely some molasses in there. Also bready malts, meat, black pepper, and a little bit of bourbon. Personally, I think this flute is limiting the aroma's intensity, but this still smells quite awesome.  Taste: Dark chocolate and smoke in the beginning. Sweet berries, dark fruit, caramel/molasses, and barbecue in the middle. Toasted bready malts in the finish. Coffee seems to be spread lightly throughout, though more apparent in the beginning and finish. Aftertaste is very malty and dry, with some hoppy bitterness too.  Mouthfeel: A tad watery with tons of carbonation. Lots of malty chewiness as well. Medium bodied.  Drinkability: Complexity is good, but not all that smooth.

There are sweet notes in the scent, with primarily malt/chocolate tones. The taste is initially again, quite malty and sweet with some roasted nuts. There is a medium body and some bitterness at the end. It sits in the mouth nicely and has a lower level of carbonation. It is quite smooth.

This beer had a good appearance but the aroma and taste were far too malty for me. This beer tasted sweet and I couldn't detect any other flavors (aside from molasses) that were doing much for me. The drinkability was average, but honestly I would have rated it lower probably because I was getting too much sweetness... and none of the creamy or smoothness that you might expect.  I suppose that I could appreciate how someone would like this, but its not one that I would go for. Its a shame because I went in expecting much more.

When held to a light, it appears as a very deep ruby transparency. Lacing and head retention are non-existent.  Very malty, sweet, caramel tones, and quality. Reminds me a bit of some malted milk balls. Some biscuit, dark chocolate and roasted malts upon a closer ""look.""  Wow that packs a strong flavor. Malt overload which normally would not do it for me, but for some reason this one does.  The mouth on this one is quite unique. It poured almost like a thick stout, but doesn't go down as such.

Dark roasty grain.  Taste is chocolate malt, sweet molasses and roasty grain. A very slight spicy alcohol warming. Hint of wheat sourness. Bitterness in the finish.  Mouth is creamy and luscious.

T- The flavor offers a luxurious maltiness that's fairly complex with notes of molasses, deeply toasted honey-glazed bread, dried dark fruit, mild leafy hop, and a very subtle smokiness. Some lingering malty notes of caramel and subtle bitter & smoky notes add to it's richness.  M- A velvety mouthfeel is derived from a medium body and a very fine carbonation.

T- Never have had a doppelbock before, but this I was extremely surprised by this balanced taste. I thought this beer would be strong and overpowering with the malt flavor, but the sweetness of the malt and the fruit presence blended together perfectly.

39,131,dbek,5,"According to my opinion, and compared to approx. 2500 beers, this is by far the best beer in the world. It's absolutely flawless. Until now I have managed to taste it only from a bottle but it is said that it is available ""von fass"" (draught) during May. Drinking a Celebrator is a unique experience that starts from the moment it comes to your table for the first time, until... the day you die?? The first thing that will catch your eye is the bottle. I usually don't pay attention, but the uniqueness of the label and the little ""bock"" that hangs from it tell you two things: It's a beer that has a lot of tradition behind it, and that it is made by people who pay attention to details. And then you serve it... Its dark ruby-red / brown color plays with your imagination as well as it does with light. Its full aroma reaches your brain gradually. At first, I thought it was impossible to have a bouquet of aromas, so full and well-balanced. This beer smells of spring rain, wet wood and discreet flowers. The worst part is the 3-5 seconds wait it takes to settle. It takes for ever... But when you taste it you won't believe that such thing is possible! The world will subside and all of your senses will busy cherishing the unique feeling of drinking a Celebrator. No words. Perhaps I am over-reacting but have you tried it?  Suggestions: Serve at a temperature of ~5 deg. C in a tulip shaped glass. Accompanies well most plates (red/white meat, vegetables, fruit, chocolate) but the best way to enjoy is with just some pretzels.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,popery,3.92,"Celebrator is a very good beer with a great malt flavor. It is quite drinkable. I could easily have one regularly. It is relatively light on the palate, leaving a well-balanced aftertaste. I can certainly understand its long-established reputation, and perhaps superstitiously, I imagine it tastes even better when you drink it in Germany.  The beer pours dark brown with a big head and little lacing. It's a good looking beer without anything really wrong with it but I can't remember any high points either. The nose is sweet with hints of alcohol. Some of the roast comes through, as well.  The taste is coffee, chocolate and some spice. It's sweet but much better balanced than many similar beers. There are good bitter notes to weigh down the sweetness, but the sweetness predominates a bit.  The aftertaste is good, but my mouth feels a bit puckered from the sweet malt.

I chose this carefully because I love this beer and I thought Celebrator would be a great beer to Celebrate the next step.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,atsprings,4.3,"Served in a chalice a not quite opaque black w/ ruby highlights . The beer is topped with a thin head that diminished to a thin layer and left spotty lacing. The aroma was a nice blend of brown malts, chocolate and roasted nuts. The taste was a wonderful array of malts with lingering espresso bitterness. The beer was medium bodied with warming alcohol and decent carbonation. This beer has always been very enjoyable, and it's even better on draft.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,r3zim,4.05,Poured into a lo-ball glass.  A: Color is dark brown. Poured about one inch of head. Slowly dissipates to a ring of bubbles. Carbonation appears light and bubbles are large.  S: Smell is sweet. Hints of toffee and chocolate.  T: Sweet and mild. Creamy. Dark chocolate bite. A touch of bitterness or sourness.  M: Very smooth. Low combination. A bit of chalkiness at the ending.  D: Drinkability is very good.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,FtownThrowDown,4.25,"Pours a very dark brown in color, damn near black. Nice inch of mocha colored head forms on the pour. Smell is dark roasted malts and I'm getting a bit of cocoa/coffee. Taste is lots of toffee. Some more roasted malts. This is incredibly full and creamy on the mouthfeel. What a beer, I don't recall having anything like this in a long while.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BeenJammin,4.32,"A - Dark brown with a good head, good retention, and very nice looking lacing.  S - Very sweet and fruity aroma. Some kind of cherry/raspberry aroma is what dominates  T - Very much like the aroma only with less fruits and a lot more of the sweet malt. It was kind of toasy/roasty and there was almost a chocolate like flavor in there too.  M - It was medium bodied and full of flavor  D - Haven't had many of this style but I like it a lot. Definitely will go back to this one.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,mnj21655,4.33,"12 oz. bottle poured into a mug  Pours a clear dark brown color with ruby highlights and a full two fingers of creamy, relatively long-lasting off-white head. Aroma is strongly malty with some dark fruits notes from the Munich malts. Taste is rich and quite malty, some more dark fruits (figs, prunes, etc.), a bit of chocolate and a moderate hop bitterness. The malt flavor is present throughout whereas the other flavors seem to come and go. Initially the flavor is overwhelming fruity (figs, prunes). Then the hop bitterness appears but soon yields to a wonderful cocoa flavor. The chocolate flavor lingers into the finish where is mingles with a bit of alcohol. The finish is decidedly sweet but this beer is by no means under attenuated. Mouthfeel is good, medium+ body and moderate to low carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, just shy of perfect. Incredibly complex flavors coupled with a a well masked alcohol presence make this beer a treat.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,justin7742,4.83,"I have had this beer many many times, but I thought I would sit down and actually evaluate it for once. I opened the bottle and poured it into a heavy pint glass. It pours well with a very festive foam and thick creamy head that lasts. The color is a dark black with maybe a hint of amber. It smells toasty with a strong malt essence. After the sip I notice an extremely smooth mouthfeel and a slight sweetness. But then I get a smack bam! With a strong, yet pleasant, bold coffee-ish flavor. The sweetness diminishes and I taste a strong malty goodness. I love this beer and always have. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying out new doppelbocks or is into dark beers in general. It's a dark beer with real flavor.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,daythree16,4.65,"Pours almost black with just a hint of brown around the edges. Nice two finger head that slowly fades away to a thin film. Looks awesome and inviting.  First smell is the big malt bill. Lots of caramel with some figs thrown in as well. Taste is delicious caramel sweetness, but it's not overpowering. There is also a nice subtle bitterness on the finish. Noble hops? It's nice to have that acidic hoppiness to cut some of the sweetness of the malt. I haven't been a huge fan of most of the doppelbocks I've had because of their overly sweet nature, but this one is near perfect.  Full-bodied, smooth, and very, very drinkable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,clayrock81,4.05,"It has been a long time since I had this beer...was eating dessert w/ my wife and friends and the bar had Bud, Bud Light, some other macros and this. I took this as a sign to have it again. Arriving in a large pils glass, I received a beer with a blackish looking body with a clinging, one-finger head that stuck around. A sweet malt smell is prevelant, with caramel really sticking out. Also believe I smelled light hints of chocolate, coffee and some toasted malts as well. Minor hop presence. Medium-bodied and smooth, there is not only a sweetness to this beer but a creaminess to it as well. Good carbonation and a thickness in the beer fill the mouth well, and there are nice hops to be enjoyed on the backbite with a crisp and dry finish. Hints of dark fruit/reminded me a tad of a Belgian triple. I remember why I don't drink this more...the sugars lead to a Jagerbomb effect and after one bottle I had to pause for a few minutes. This is one great beer that packs a punch as well.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Dubbercody,4.1,"11.2 oz bottle.  Incredibly smooth, just a touch of heat on the end, but it's super drinkable, easy. Nice nose, good depth and complexity that doesn't assault you, just says, ""Hey drink me! Now!"". This beer disappears terribly quickly.  I don't really know why it took me so damn long to try this beer. It's one of those great ones you just pass by not really realizing how incredibly good it really is. At least I've gotten over my walk-past and had this wonderful beer.  Next time, I'll buy more.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ClavisAurea,4.62,"Consumed from the tap in a Celebrator glass.  Appearance: dark chestnut brown, slight head and very fine lace. It would have gotten higher marks if it had more head.  Smell: molasses, caramel, sweet, brown sugar and malt  Taste/Mouthfeel: spicy hop flavor profile, complex sweetness, molasses, smooth in the finish, lingering sweetness  Wow, like dark heaven in a glass. Can I have some more please. I was very impressed that I found it on tap. It was at Tizley's Euro Pub in downtown Poulsbo, WA.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,JonathanL7890,4.55,"Poured from an 11.5 ounce bottle. Color is an almost opaque black with a slight reddish tint. Carbonation left a 1 finger light brown head. Smell: Caramel, nutty, just the slightest touch of noble hops. Taste: Extremely well balanced. I get the maltiness balanced with the hops to leave a very smooth drink. Mouthfeel is thick. The alcohol is not perceived at all. Drinkability: I could drink several of these. Very good for a doppelbock. This is definitely the standard for the doppelbock style. I have not come across any that have even come close to this.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,UGADawgGuy,4.83,"Poured from a 330mL (about 11-ounce) bottle into a pint glass. I kind of wish I had a 12-ounce mug.  Appearance: Deep, dark brown, and almost totally opaque. A VAGUE hint of ruby red is visible around the edges when I hold my glass up to a strong light source. The head is about as dark brown as I've seen, and retention/lacing are both minimal. In spite of this, the color of the beer itself is truly unique, meriting a perfect score in my view.  Smell: The overarching scent is of roasted malt. Repeated sniffs yield some dried fruits (I detect dried plums and apricots), with a certain nuttiness that is tough to pin down.  Taste: Sweet and malty, followed by a nice, warm toastiness. I've seen this beer's flavor compared to coffee here, and I won't disagree -- at the end of a long sip, I can taste a roasted coffee bean-like flavor. Also present: dried fruits (as in the nose), roasted almonds, and brown sugar.  Mouthfeel: Mild to moderate carbonation. Very ""thick"" and heavy in the mouth, which is a good thing. I feel like I'm drinking some kind of holiday cake, with a hint of strong coffee.  Drinkability: Fantastic. The 6.7 ABV is just right for the style, as it's not detectable on the palate, but it rears its head in the stomach and the brain. This stuff is like the chocolate milk of beer -- thick, hearty, and comforting. I'd prefer this to hot chocolate on a wintry night.  In my opinion (based on the doppelbocks I've tried), this sets the standard for the style. Highly recommended.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,PatronWizard,3.98,"Wow! Comes with a free charm for your necklace.  Pretty damn dark. Head is off white, not too long lived. Can get a ruby hue if I tilt the glass, otherwise it's just about black.  Light sour scent.  Good flavor. I'm gonna let it warm just a hair. **Lets it warm**  The flavor and scent get a little stronger. There's a new scent that I can't name. Sorry, I'm stupid.  I think I now know the distinct doppelbock flavor. Love the 6.7%, can't sense it until it's too late.  Overall: good beer, worth a trial",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,SickBrew,4.5,"Purchased from Biggs Beer Wine and Tobacco in Vancouver, WA.  Poured from a 330ml standard brown bottle into a pint class.  Pours a fantastic dark brown with a creamy off-white head!  The aroma is wonderful, has strong maltiness that is accented by caramel and toasty notes with little or no hop aroma.  Flavor is out of the park and right on for the style. Low hops add to the sweetness and let the malt flavor dominate in grand style.  Mouthfeel is full bodied with a low carbonation feel.  Overall this is an outstanding beer, strong, rich and a must for any doppelbock fans!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Cyberkedi,4.75,"This comes out of the tap a deep, opaque sable, almost like a stout or porter rather than a bock. Rich, malty aroma has undertones of chocolate and roast coffee.

Excellent clarity and good head that sticks around and leaves decent lacing.  Aroma is roasty and clean with a bit of chocolate.  Taste is excellent. It seems sweet at the begining but then the palate is hit with bitterness and it finishes surprisingly dry. There's roasted malt, dark chocolate, and maybe a bit of coffee but it all seems well rounded and balanced.  Mouthfeel is very good with smooth crispness from the lager yeast. Appropriate carbonation.  Very drinkable and perfect for a cool, late summer night. I just wish they had it in bigger bottles.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Taste & Mouthfeel: WOW! complex indeed. Strong but not overtly. Has a coffee touch to it along with what seems to be molasses. Holds it's characteristics throughout. Leaves the mouth with a slight warm feeling. Very nice!  Drinkability: Any brew that comes with a ram ornament, that comes from Germany, automatically gains ""cool points"" in my book and this one lives up to the hype.

39,131,elniko,4.6,Poured into Stella glass  A: Beautiful looking brew. Deep brown with tan head with nice lacing.  S: Slighly toasty tones. The main smell that I get is licorice however. Wonderful strong smelling brew.  T & M: Taste is surprisingly light with nice crispness. Definite bitterness which I really enjoyed in the mouthfeel.

Caramel, figs and, dare I say it, canned pineapple (!?) in the aroma; malty sweetness. And what a flavor. Aged malts and whole-wheat bread, subtle molasses and /or brown sugar counter-pointed by a hoppy bitterness at the end. Balanced and very, very deep. There's a lot going on here. Great mouthfeel, smooth but poignant carbonation. Good finish too. A demanding beer that is not for novices.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

T: The beer tastes really sweet with a nice bock hint at the end. The beer is malty, with a minor chocolate spread through the sweetness. The beer doesn't for such of roasty malt like most dopplebocks; however, this sweetness and chocolaty part of the beer makes it quite delicious.  M: Syrupy and slightly thick.

S- Nose is a mix of rich caramel, chocolate malt, and molasses.  T- Upfront is semisweet chocolate malt with some caramel and molasses. A touch of toasted bitterness is added to these characters for the finish and almost nothing lingers.  M-Medium carbonation and medium weight body, though somewhat chewy. Goes down smooth.  D- This is a wonderful beer. Best example I have had of this style. Its not too complex but very smooth and drinkable.

Sweet and toasty on the nose. Reminds me of Guinness.  Taste:  Toasted malt with just a slight hint of astringency from the alcohol. Slightly bitter finish, but malt dominates throughout.  Mouthfeel:  Somewhat chewy beer, but not overdone. Carbonation is well done in my opinion. Sticky finish.  I haven't had many dopplebocks in my life, but this one lived up to my expectations.

39,131,cnally,4.55,"This beer came as a recommendation from one of the beer aficionados at the great Indianapolis establishment, Kahn's.  The Celebrator! Okay then, I shall begin celebrating. The beer poured out with a deep brown hue. We are talking Midnight Brown. Light has trouble getting through, and when it does, it picks up that brown visual with a touch of red. The head evaporated pretty quickly. The scent is a subtle nutty, woodsy aroma with some mocha. Caramel is the first flavor, which quickly settles into a convocation of coffee, mocha, molasses & almond flavors. Really deep complex flavor, where all the pieces come together one-by-one, creating a new experience. There is a bit of alcohol burn in the back of your throat if you don't watch it, but the beer is smooth enough. Absolutely a pleasure to drink and attractive in more than one sense.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,neenerzig,4.35,"My totally awesome girlfriend, who does not know crap about beer, got this for me as part of her 7th anniversary gift for me. Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into the totally awesome new beer mug she also got me as another part of the overall gift. I heard very good things about this beer but just never got around to trying it until now. This beer is a dark, deep brown color with some ruby highlights around the edges. The tan head is about an inch thick when poured, settles to a decent surface layer with a thin ring lining the inside of the glass about two minutes after being poured. Decent lace. Head eventually fades to nothing. Very malty aromas here along with a bit of caramel and dark fruit such as apples, raisins, and plums. Sweet, somewhat roasted malt flavor upfront followed by caramel and a hint of brown sugar and definitely some of the aforementioned fruit. The taste of alcohol is also present, but intertwines nicely with the rest of the flavors. No discernible hops whatsoever, and that's just fine here. Not the most complex flavored beer I have ever had of this type, but it is spot on for the style! Has a crisp, smooth and frothy full bodied mouthfeel with moderate to heavy carbonation. Excellent drinkability here. A very good beer all around here. A must try for those who are fans of this style!  Eric",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Appearance: Deep brown body with garnet and ruby hues, minimal lacing and a spritzy, fuzzy head which fades quickly.  Aroma: An amazing blend of light, fruity esters - green apple skins and sweet, white grapes - and deep, toasty malts - cocoa and lightly roasted coffee.  Taste: Dry and fruity, with plenty of almost-but-not-quite tart notes and plenty of those same roasted notes. Notes of toffee and butterscotch, and those same cocoa/coffee notes that become more obvious as things warm.  Mouthfeel: Big spritzy bubbles, rather even, though not perfectly so, and surprisingly thin for such a malty, fruity beer.  Drinkability: Surprisingly refreshing, tasty, and quite complex for a doppelbock - one of the classics, and definitely recommended.

Appearance - As picture perfect as a beer can get. In beer heaven every beer would look like this. A dark dark brown almost black color with a reddish tint when held up to light. A tan very thick head shot up about an inch to the lip of the glass before stopping. Head puffed out beautifully right over the top of the glass. Hundreds of tiny bubbles shot up the sides of the beer for awhile after the pour.  Smell - A sweet, very thick malt as well as a toasty grain for the base of this one. Spicy hop and alcohol linger too.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Man oh man is this a smooth drinker! Goes down extremely smooth with a quick little kick of carbonation in the middle. A bready, dark, sweet malt takes over right away, with the spicy hops and alcohol gently flowing through to give this one some background. The best part comes in the end, as this masterpiece goes down creamy and smooth, coating the tongue like a soft blanket for a slam dunk finish.

39,131,TheViceBlog,4.4,"The bottle excitedly came with a little stallion trinket on a string attached to the bottle's neck. Nice. More breweries should employ this Cracker Jack a-prize-in-every-box strategy in order to lure me into buying their product.  Beautiful dark chocolate pour with little hints of purple and a tan head. I never talk about a beer's lacing cause I typically don't give a shit but Celebrator has maybe the best I have ever seen. It was hypnotic to look at. Tastes of chocolate and espresso and it's incredibly smoky, like Worcester sauce or something. Very malty of course too and no sweetness at all. Slightly more sour finish than I expected. Very warming. Incredibly drinkable too as this beer is smoother than a eunuch's crotch.  If you have not had many doppelbocks in your life I think you would find this beer very odd and perhaps undrinkable. Even having loved many doppels in my life it took me a little bit to get acclimated to this one. I'm not sure if this is a beer you completely figure out until you're halfway through the bottle. The beer is much better the warmer it is served as well, as I began drinking it at too cold of temperature.  Celebrator is pretty much the dictionary definition doppelbock. It is the most known and arguably the best as well. However, I wouldn't advise an amateur beer-drinker to try this as they'd probably be in for a bit of a surprise and not enjoy it. As for me, though I found it brilliant, it lacked a few things I would have liked to consider it a masterpiece. First of all, it's a bit dull, a bit bland. I also think it could have used a sweet component or two. I also think the alcohol content should be amped up. But then again, I always think that.  But these are minor quibbles and this an amazing beer that rightfully deserves all the accolades it receives.  Aaron www.theviceblog.com",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,maximum12,3.56,"Thanks to genog for throwing this into a trade.  Pours dark with a hint of red sneaking in around the edges. Nice head collapses quickly into a thin ring around the Sierra Nevada pint glass. Not much of a distinguishing nose on this baby.  Given the faint aroma, the full taste is a head-rocker, wow! There's a lot of earthen, muddy, deep dark tastes in there, mixed at the end with a bit a sweet malt to even it out.  Feels full, rich, & lingers well on the palate. First time I've had this beer, very nice.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,THEBEERBAR0N,4.67,"I drank this beer from a pilsner glass after pouring it out of a 12oz bottle. Lacing is negligable.  It runs a deep mahagony color with minimal cappucino head that quickly gets absorbed back into the brew.  Bready smells with caramel, butterscotch, molasses, christmas spices... and so much more. This brew has an amazingly immense depth whose flavors transcend the bounds of my vocabulary.  The taste matches the smell... deep and rich with a lot of earthiness, breadiness, and caramel/toffee/butterscotch notes. I also get maybe... raisins? Finishes with a pleasant warming alcohol taste.  Mouthfeel is medium-thick at first and then somewhat chewy on the palate for the finish. The flavor sticks with you well after the last sip.  Drinkabililty is high but perhaps a bit heavy for the summer months, definitely a beer I prefer on a rainy night.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Palealetial,3.98,"I am several beers into my tasting but this is getting my attention.  I cannot put my finger on the exact taste but it is similar to figs, nutty, caramel, honey, with a pumpkin spice kicker.  I will celebrate the fact that this is my last beer of the night but it was enjoyable none the less.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,TAMU99,4.4,"A great beer. Very drinkable, no too anything.  Pours a clear very dark mahogany, with a thick tan foam. The smell is mocha with subtle spicing. Such a smooth, sweet taste. Mild hops complement the malt. No cloying aftertaste. Very drinkable and smooth mouthfeel without that syrupy coating on your throat.  I'll reach for this one again and again",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Stonebreaker,4.83,"Appearance: Deliciously black, thin head retained for the duration, solid lacing as well.  Smell: Oak, Cherry, chocolate malt, sweet raisins.  Taste: Same as above. Nice warming, with a very burnt chocolaty coffee finish.  Mouthfeel: Like some sort of delectable dessert, as rich a beer I've not had.

Familiar lager aroma, but certainly not typical.  T: Great malt sweetness, and the same spice from the aroma. Slight bitterness on the finish, surprising sweetness after that. Overall wonderful flavor for this style.  M: Really great fullness, slightly viscous, small bubbles of carbonation.  D: Flavor isn't overbearing and the alcohol is not detectable. Really drinkable for this style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Mryup,4.6,"A: A gentle pour produces the deepest of browns with red/yellows poking through in the light. 3/4 inch of dense, toasted head. ""My apartment smells of rich mahogany"" - Ron Burgandy. This is a great looking beer caught in a time warp.  S: ""That's quite pungent"". Good smells wafting to the olfactory. Rich molasses with sweet caramel malt Hops smell perfectly balanced with the malt. My barbaric senses can't pinpoint anything beyond although there some spices and maybe some plum.  T: I really thought the fruit would come out in the taste but I say say nay, it doesn't. Absolutely beautiful. Not sweet, but sugary molasses with surprisingly a lot of hops. Toasted malt as well. Some earthy spices and mild, mild aleish fruit esters poking through. All these things are PERFECTLY balanced.  M: A heavy beer but OH MY! More brilliance! The hops bring on a much needed bitterness creating the illusion of lightness.  D: Very drinkable for what it is.  Nothing revolutionary but it's impressively complex. A classic doppelbock that sets the bar.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,csmiley,4.47,"A - Pours deep brown with some ruby highlights. Some light is able to get through but not much. The tan head stopped rising after reaching a height of one inch and didn't stick around for very long. Lacing in the glass was good.  S - Sweet aroma with molasses and caramel taking the lead. Toasted bread and more caramel show up midway. Hints of butterscotch, raisin, and warm alcohol are on the tail end.  T - Flavor is where this beer really starts to shine. Starts out with molasses, raisins, and caramel. Some nuts, dark bread, and maple show up midway. Warm alcohol, dried cherry, and a toastiness are all present towards the end and achieve a very nice balance.  M - Medium to full bodied for the style. Carbonation is low but works for this beer. Smooth overall feel with a sweet finish.  D - Drinkability is very good. This beer is sweet, complex, and practically defines the style of Doppelbock. The alcohol is a tad high but does not keep this one from going down quick and easy. I could easily have more of these. Hats off to Aying for this offering.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BirdFlu,4.38,"dopplebocks tend to be a personal favorite and this one did not let me down. It pours very dark and mouth watering. The smell isn't too noticable, but the taste is very rich, roasted, and choclately. The sweet choclately taste does not become overpowering, however, and it is very drinkable (doesn't begin to weigh you down or feel too filling). The most outstanding characteristic is the mouthfeel. It is very bubbley but with tiny, microbubbles which make each sip delightful and fun. Highly suggested for fans of dopplebocks and Baltic porters or other similar styles.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Folderol,4.26,"Wow. This is damn near a Baltic Porter, it's so dark. Everyone seems to have their own definition of doppelbock, and Ayinger thinks it should be rich, roasty, chocolatey, slightly bitter and really smooth. This one definitely deserves its world class reputation.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BamaBeerBuff,4.67,"A: Pours a dark mahogany color with a creamy light oak head that retains well. Not much lacing to report, but the color and head are marvelous.  S: In a word: wow! Rich molasses, candied figs, brown sugar, and caramel all blend together wonderfully in front of a backdrop of rich toasted bready malt aromas. Damn near the best nose on a beer I've had to date.  T&M: I'll describe the feel first, as I'm still trying to get a handle on everything I'm tasting here: The body is medium with a light, fine carbonation that produces a smooth velvety mouthfeel that's absolutely delightful. Tastes include dark fruits, molasses, rich bread, some slight grassy/earthy hops, and a tinge of roasted malt. Wonderfully complex and bold. Truly an excellent beer.  D: Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock is a work of art. The only thing limiting drinkability is the ABV and slight heaviness in the stomach. Still, this is a beer to be savored and enjoyed--not sessioned.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Hoagie1973,4.67,"Wow. Wasn't expecting it to be this good. Best Doppelbock I've ever had bar none. Nearly opaque brown with a buttery tan head. Good retention with spotty lacing. Smells very sweet with malt, molasses and a hint of caramel. Doesn't taste as sweet as the smell. Starts that way, with molasses & toffee flavors, but quickly transitions into a nice roasty coffee-like bitterness in the finish. A little drying, but that gives way to the residual sugars. Hops help with the balance nicely. Mouthfeel is thick & full, smooth and creamy. Highly enjoyable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,beerlassie,4.52,"A very deep and rich brown color, and when held up to the light there are hints of dark red. When poured it has a light brown head.  Fruity aroma, with ascents of cherry and raisins.  Strong malty taste, very subtle hints of nuttiness and herbs. It leaves a pleasant fruit flavor on the palate.  Good mouthfeel, just the right amount of carbonation.  This is just an overall fantastic beer. I've had it several times and it always manages to impress me. Definitely should be tried.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,cvstrickland,4.25,"I have to admit being charmed by the appearance of this bottle with its rustic goats hugging/dancing with a big glass of beer. Clean, classic graphics and the little white plastic goat dangling by a red thread looped around the longneck make smile. It's all so kitschy I feel like I ought to hate it, but I just can't bring myself to do that.  Anyway, the neat little package is opened and poured into a goblet, yielding a clear ruby-brown body capped with a thick, creamy beige lid of fine, fine bubbles with rocky patches that leaves a bit of lacing.  Smell is rich and tangy malty with a toasted nut and honey note.A touch of wheaty molasses emerges as the drink warms.  Taste is chocolatey with a thick, chewy-sweet, malty breadiness that is at once brown sugary and earthy. A fine dry, yeasty edge and just a touch of dark, roasty bitterness keeps the drink from crossing the line from 'sweet' to 'cloying'. A rich starchy note of grain fills in the spaces.  Slick with only the barest of carbonation, the drink is smooth and very drinkable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,SQNfan,4,"It poured black color with a tan head that faded rather quickly. Aromas were sweet with scents of sweet malt, brown sugar, raisin and a touch of chocolate.

The pour produced a nice tan head, but it receded quickly and didn't produce much by way of lacing.  S: Smells of sweet, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, espresso coffee, and dark fruits. Very nice.  T: Does not dissapoint. Comes first with sweet, biscuity malts. Followed by dark roasted malt that adds a bit of smoke to the profile. Caramel, green apples, raisins, toffee, and coffee can all be found in the tasting. This brew is amazing.  M: This a full bodied beer that realy rolls right over the tongue and down the throat. Although it is chewy, it goes down easy. Varied malt flavors linger and there is a touch of alcohol heat on the back of the throat. Amazing.  D: This is a great beer and I could drink this all night, but I shouldn't. Very heavy brew that makes for a great after dinner beverage. This is one of the best brews I have had. Damn near perfect.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S: alot going on in this beer. smell of toasty coffee and chocolate. medium to heavy malting. dark fermented fruit aroma with spicing almost candy like. smells sweet and toasty. If the aroma is any indication this is going to be an orgy of taste on my palette.  T: nice and roasted, nutty, coffee taste. maybe even a bit smokey. sweet, fruity (plum, grape?) and slightly bitter to round it out. hints of dark chocolate. very rich.  M/D: moderately carbonated, with a rich, almost syrupy feel. smooth and delicious. very well crafted beer and one that could be drank over and over IMO.

39,131,BullCityB,4.52,"Pours a deep brown into my new Unibroue tulip, with a thick tanned head of foam. Retention looks solid so far. Further into the glass, it settles into a nice collar, nothing huge, but ok.  The nose is awesome. Dark, toasty malt flavors, fruit, chocolate and, oddly enough, a little smokiness? A touch sweetness in the background, and very little perceived alcohol. Delicious and completely unique.  The flavor is deep and intense, following the aroma. A little more alcohol noticable here, but it doesn't detract. Sweet, toasty malt, fruit, maybe a little chocolate and that odd smoky flavor. It's very subtle, only a background, but it makes the beer taste so deliciously earthy. Hop flavor is minimal, though there is enough bitterness to keep the finish medium dry and decidedly bready (think pumpernickle).  In the mouth, the beer is smooth, though not as rich or creamy as it could have been. Low carbonation is a plus here. I would put the body as a solid medium. While these factors conspire to leave a tiny bit desired, they make the beer as drinkable as the day is long - so smooth, so delicious...  Overall, this beer is a real winner. Bocks are a favorite of mine, and when they're as big and flavorful as Celebrator, well, it's cause for celebration.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Notes: This was something I had to try and it did not disappoint. So well balanced,so perfect in every way. I never thought I would have a Doppelbock that was so refreshing,so light bodied and yet so satisfying.

S- First off, I get what I describe as a fresh flour scent, with a nice chocolate, caramel maltiness, and even some light prune, and dark fruit spiciness. To sum up the smell in one word, this smells a lot like a french silk pie. Nice dark chocolate notes.. etc.  T- A low carbonation sweeps over the tongue, but you can tell this beer isn't lacing any body. Initially, you get some nice dry chocolate, with some lingering caramel, light cherry, prunes, and eventually a light drop hopiness, in the finish. Its like a dryer chocolate milk with some dry fruits added. Complex, and delicious.  M- Low carbonation works well for the style although a touch more might benefit the initial taste. The body is very nicely done as it isn't to thick, but not to thin.  D- @6.7%, this is one great beer. Of all doppelbocks I've had, this one is king.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Outstanding.  T: The very best. Malty, caramel, molasses, sweetness balanced out with an unnoticeable hop prescence. Completely balanced.  M: Perfection with the carbonation. Slick feel to it.

I also get a taste/scent sensation of split firewood post-swallow, but I'm not exactly sure where it's coming from. The taste is defintely a lager.

39,131,MiguelMandingo,4.22,"I picked this up to try something new. I haven't had a dopplebock in a long time, as I have been quite the hophead since I began drinking better beer.  Poured a 12oz. bottle into a flute glass.  Appearance - It pours a deep transparent brown color that is too deep to see through clearly - contains garnet hues as well. It produced a 1 finger head that quickly dissipated to thin halo. A quick swirl of the glass brings 1/2 finger head back for a few seconds before dissipating again - moderate to low carbonation.  Smell - The scent is pretty straightforward - dark fruit, fig caramel and chocolate with a bit of toffee. Toasty malts. Nothing overly deep or complex.  Taste - The flavor is pretty much just like the scent - caramel, toffee, dark fruit, fig, and chocolate. There is a quite a bit of toasted malt flavor and just a hint of molasses. There is a hint of salt toward the end that rounds out the flavor a bit.  Mouthfeel - This brew is medium bodied. The carbonation level is moderate, which suits the style well. Very smooth as it runs over the tongue.  Drinkability - Great beer. Very easy to drink. Smooth and tasty - I just wish that the smell had a little more bang. I could drink several of these in an evening, but would eventually want to drink something else to make things interesting. Overall very good. I would pick this one up again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Slight head which dissapates quickly.  Smells of nice, sweet malts. Almost like toffee or caramel. No hops or alcohol appear in the nose. This is good.  Sweet malts hit the taste sensors first. Mmmm. There follows a light smokey/roasted flavor. Just ever so light hops flavor on the back end with a touch of almost saltiness.  The feel is very nice, but with all the build-up of color and smell I expected it to be a bit fuller and richer. Would have rated higher with more body. Just a tad too light for my tastes.

T: A burnt, malty taste with a slightly fruity aftertaste. Hints of figs seemed to be evident in the aftertaste.  M: A little on the thin side for a doppelbock, but still very good nonetheless.  D: A fairly drinkable beer. Due to the high malt content, it starts to fill you up towards the end of the beer. Due to this, the lighter mouthfeel makes the beer easier and more fun to enjoy.

39,131,MusicaleMike,4.42,"I reviewed this beer tonight while listening to Slowdrive's ""Souvlaki"" album. If you like My Bloody Valentine, you should like Slowdrive; and if you like beer you should like this doppelbock. I poured the 11.2 oz. bottle into the patented Celebrator glassware.  A: This beer is a very clear dark brown, bordering on black, with some very dark red hues when held to the light. It was topped by a thick tan head with small compact bubbles which eventually faded into a thin lace on top. This would have easily scored higher if the head left more of an impression as the beer went on.  S: Celebrator smells strongly of toasted malt, with hints of caramel (sweet malty smell) and a slight bitter chocolate smell. There is virtually no hop aroma. Fits the style perfectly.  T: There is a sweet malty taste up front which is balanced (moderately) by bitterness. I really feel like the sweet malt character is balanced by a somewhat salty aftertaste. There is a roasted quality to the flavor which compliments the warming alcohol sensation.  M: Full-bodied. Smooth carbonation. A little bite towards the finish. What more could one ask for?  D: This is a delicious beer. Definitely my doppelbock of choice from now on. However, how many of these suckers could I drink in a night? Not many. The ""liquid bread"" that it purports to be fills one up quickly. Nonetheless, this is the go-to doppelbock, so that makes up for it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S - Rich roasted maltts, hint of dark fruit, coffee, dark chocolate. A very bold and inviting nose.  T - Whoa, really complex flavor. Bold malt flavor starts off by kicking you in the jaw. Wonderful, balanced finish: both earthy hops and rich malts work together in a very synergistic manner. Damn tasty!  M - Full bodied and very smooth. The rich, tasty malts are able to be savored when held on the tongue. I think that the level of carbonation is very appropriate for the flavors.

The smell, right off the bat is huge whiffs of fruit smack you pleasantly in the face. Hints of cherries and raisins? Some dark spiced fruits perhaps?  The taste is malt all the way. Very earthy and herbal flavors. Decent levels of bitterness to complement the malts. Malts come off as slightly doughy/nutty as well.  Mouthfeel is pleasant. Medium (approaching thick) bodied with mild (but good) levels of carbonation on the palate.  This is THE Dopplebock to drink. Easy to find (at least in my experience) and a complete joy to drink.

Very drinkable, higher abv but drinks easy. Alcohol is a bit warming but does not hurt the drinkability.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,coalcracker,4.25,"Appearance: Cool bottle with goat trinket. Pours a dark soda-like/caramel color. Head is tan and takes a while to dissipate. Smell: Sweet sugars/malt first noted here. Taste: Malts are king here with enough hops to balance the maltiness. Tastes of sweet fig, raisin, toffee, and a mildly roasted character contribute to the malts. Mild alcohol presence also noted. Mouthfeel: Thick mouthfeel, but smooth. Drinkability: A single Doppel usually does it for me on any given night. This is, nonetheless, a very drinkable beer. Overall: A thick and complex doppel that is very palatable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,PBBC,4.73,"Beer pours a deep deep brown, but when held up to the light, is a gorgeous shade of ruby red. The head dissipates rather quickly.  Aroma, the aroma reminds me of coffee crisp (the candy bar)... very caramel-like, with a tinge of bittersweet chocolate and coffee.  Taste is huge. A deep, deep malt complexity. Begins sweet and thick, rounding off with a raisin-cherry like tart-bitterness, and then a crisp, wheaty-carbonation that really aids in helping the beer finish rather clean for such a 'big' beer. The chocolate malt and alcohol content blend together to create an intense sense of lingering warmth in the mouth.  Drinkability: although the beer 6.7 percent, this beer feels like an intense experience that should be savored, and not overdone. Extraordinarily well balanced... but I wouldn't have too many in a night... this is a special occasion beer.  Delicious, an amazing example of the depth of the Bock style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Add a touch of booze and you have a nice dopplebock.  M: Thick and smooth. Somewhat creamy in an oily sort of way.  D: Not my favorite class, but this one is still enjoyable and very drinkable.

Molasses, caramel with toasted malt and some breadiness T: Very bready, toasted malt flavor with the hints of caramel and molasses from the smell with some light hop flavor as well. Incredibly well balanced. Finishes with a very strong flavor of bread and some sugar. M: Very chewy and smooth and some carbonation hiding in the background, but difficult for it get to the forefront. Faint taste of alcohol in the finish is very pleasant.

Everything is so well balanced and blended together.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Head's thin and settles quickly on this meaty man-brew.  Tastes of dark malts and fig. A fruity, roasty fullness permeates, and the finish is smoky bitterness.

Try it to say you hit that!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Aroma of roasted nutiness and dark fruits greet the nose. Taste is little chewy up front, but the finish is quite smooth. Some malts and raisin are noticeable in the flavor. Not a filling beer and actually quite good.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Deep brown but clear/ not stout-like Poured with a nice brownish head, thinned out almost immediately but leaves a nice lace with every sip.  Aroma and flavor of caramel hit me the most.

S - Mainly deep caramel, with a hint of dark fruit and spice.  T - More caramel dominates with some slight roasted flavors. Hops are present somewhere near the finish, with a small floral component mid- to late-palate. Finish is bitter with notes of something like nutmeg or mace, along with a fruity sugar taste, reminding me a lot of a demerara sugar. Quite sweet overall.  M - Nice and smooth with very little carbonation. Little bit of alcohol bite at the end.  D - I don't think I'd want more than one of these, though I could see some folks having a few. It's a little too sweet for my taste, rather heavy, and the alcohol really starts showing as the beer warms.

39,131,TroyS,4.4,"This is a nice bottle that I like to keep a couple of in my cabinet at all times. Celebrator by Ayinger is made by the best brewery in the world; Privatbrauerei Franz Inselkammer in Aying, Germany makes the worlds best beer, Ayinger Brau Weisse. Oh lord, thank you for Ayinger Brau Weisse. What a perfect drink. I drink more IPA's than anything, so Ayinger isn't my daily drinker. Anyhow...I'm a lover of the hops, but all in all, Ayinger gets it done right...all the time!  Celebrator pours nice and chocolaty. It's nice and dark with some roasted malt, but a nice smooth and dry finish. This isn't dry dry, but just a tad dry. I'd, maybe surprisingly, compare the mouth feel to Chimay Grande which is a bit dry, but nice and full. Mmmm...the light roast blends so nicely with the complex fruits of this Bock. Thinking about it more, it's a bit lighter in mouth feel as compared to Chimay, but more malt and roastiness. Note: Yes, Chimay Grande and Celebrator are two very different types of beers, but for some reason I like to mention the best characteristics of the best beers for that particular characteristic even if they aren't similar beers. I guess this points out my preferred characteristics too eh;)  Well...I don't know what to say more. I can definitely taste the ""Ayinger"" in this one. Mmmmm good! A really nice brown sugar spiced up with a nice, flowery but every so slightly there hop. Mmmm mmm. You can tell how much I'm enjoying a drink by how many times I type ""mmm.""

T: The initial flavor yielded a great, smooth smoky caramel with a nice fruitiness of apples. Extremly smooth with a light, dark sugary sweetness and rum raisins. Nice dark caramel sweetness that was very smooth and enjoyable. The rating speaks for itself.  M: medium-full, with a nice slickness and spicy alcohol fade.

A: The beer is a deep reddish brown color, with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of dark fruit, chocolate, caramel, lager yeast and a touch of hops.  T: The taste is well balanced with flavors of chocolate, caramel and dark fruit up front. There's a hearty malt character that brings a nice, substantial breadiness. The hops presence is mild but complimentary. The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly bready.  M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is very clean.

39,131,prototypic,3.85,"Appearance: It's dark and brown with just a flash of red. Light's coming through relatively easy. The head is a little off-white and about two fingers deep. It dissipates quickly and leaves a very light lacing.  Smell: It's relatively straight forward and a bit uninspiring. Strong malty aroma mixes with dark fruit scents (plum, prunes, and raisin). Due to its malty base, it is sweet smelling. There are ancillary yeasty and bready aromas in addition to a very faint hop aroma. It's not complex, but it's not bad. Just far from elite.  Taste: It features a strong malt flavor coupled with a heavy dose of raisins and prunes. They blend well and clearly make its flavor the strength of the beer. The dark fruits have an interesting residual bitterness about them that lingers into the aftertaste. Hops are light and may factor into the bitter taste. But, the bitterness appears to be attributable to the dark fruit. Just a personal observation. Slight yeasty and dry finish.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's somewhere between light and medium bodied. Carbonation level is good. It goes down easy and smooth. Drinkability overall is good. This is a good beer and perhaps one of the better doppelbocks I've tried. Given its lofty status, I honestly was expecting more. It's definitely a good beer and certainly should be featured on any BA's resume. But, world class? I can't go that far.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Big fluffy pitted tan head, but it doesn't last or leave much lacing. Some bubbles coming up from the bottom, but doesn't appear super-fizzy.  S: Huge dark bready malt flavor, accented with some spices. Almost smells like a Belgian dark ale or something along those lines.  T: Taste is extremely bready, mixed with some dark fruity esters. Maybe prune. A touch of spice but it's hard to pick out what it is.  MF: Fairly thick, and the carbonation makes it mouth filling. Has a bit sharper of a bite than I had expected, and a fairly dry finish. Even though the alcohol isn't that high, it has a strong warming effect and after just a few sips is pretty noticable.  O: This is good, although I can't say I like it more or less than Optimator or Salvator. All three are just so different that it's hard to compare them. This one has a lot of Belgian qualities to it, from the smell to the stinging carbonation and dry finish. Very clean flavor that's quite tasty without doing too much.

FOR some strange reason, there's a hint of bacon flavor coming in at the end. I don't know where this flavor comes from, but it's interesting to say the least.  As I said before, I've had better doppelbocks. I would even prefer to have a bottle of Leinenkugel's Big Butt in my hand right now, but this will do.

Poured into a Champagne glass, a mysterious deep caramel color with a large, smooth tan head that maintains a healthy cover, with big patches of lacing down the glass. Nice bright tan bubbles swirl during the pour. Pretty to look at.  Smells like birthday cake, caramel, faintly of raspberry cheesecake. Not overpowering but pleasant.  Taste is almost all malt, but not as sweet as most other doppelbocks I've tried. The malt flavor is toasted, with caramel and molasses notes. Very slight bite on the back of the throat. The alcohol isn't tasted but kicks in nicely towards the final third of the beer.  Mouthfeel is clean and a little sharp on the tongue, slightly spicy on the finish. Full-bodied, but not syrupy or tangy. Drinkability is good for the style, but it might sit heavy after two or three. A well-built beer, true to style, but lacking a distinctive character that sets it apart from other beers.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,bassmantin,4.03,Pours a dark brown with a semi-transparent reddish glow into a pint glass. Minimal head; I've got it pretty cold.  Smell is of malty sweetness. Taste is straight doppelbock. Good sweetness balanced by a nice tinge of bitterness in the aftertaste. Very full flavor throughout. I taste a bit of chocolate and a good bit of alcohol.  Very pleasant.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,KingPuuChuu,4.85,"One of the greatest beers out there, simply put.  I've had this out of the bottle, poured into pint glasses, but by far my favorite is poured into a heavy chalice or goblet.  The beer pours a gorgeous reddish brown, with a heavy 2 finger head, that dies down, leaving a nice lace around the glass.  Scent brings out floral hop notes, along with a citrusy hint.  Taste is heavy in those notes, along with a sharp alcoholic cut that slices through the flavor, but doesn't leave a burn. When you're finished, you want more, but the beer doesn't allow you to drink too much due to it's heavy notes and overpowering mouthful. An all around classy beer, and definitely a favorite that is always stocked in my fridge. Cheers!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,timbro81,3.96,"Pours a nice black color that when held to the light shows a deep reddish brown hue. The head is a nice 1/2 inch off white with good staying power and great lacing. Smells of nice roasted malts with a toffee like sweetness. Nose doesn't reveal too much, my only gig to this classic. Taste is slightly sweet but very balanced. The roated malts don't really come into play until the end. The mouthfeel is light yet silky. A really well balanced beer that could be sipped into the night. Highly Recommended and the pinnacle of the style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,biggmike,4.35,"Poured a dark brown color with ruby highlights and a creamy off-white head that lasted a while. Aroma is of toffee, molasses, chocolate, roasted malt.

Probably not something I could drink everyday but overall very nice.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Matty1918,4.04,"Bought a 4 pack for 9.99 at Muckeys in Lakeville Ma.  Popped the cap and had an overflow of a creamy dark head. Poured it quickly into a chalice.  The head disappeared almost immediatly but in there was a constant flow of tiny bubbles in the middle of the glass.  Lots of malt and a hint of caramel in the aroma. Very good!!!!  Malt and more malt in that first sip. A great silky, creamy moutfeel. Excellent. You can feel a slight warmness in the back of your tongue.  Not sure if the head was supposed to disapear that quickly....oh well I'll see if it does on the 2nd one.  I'll keep those little goats and hang them around the bar.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,turdburglar,4.87,"This is my favorite beer. The other members of Beer Advocate have certainly described its character and attributes more eloquently and accurately than i could, but i will say this: i have tasted every other dopplebock i could find and compared them to the mighty Celebrator. Most are good, but none can compare to this magnificent brew. To be fair, the Weihenstephaner Korbinian is excellent, but a distant second in my opinion.  GREATEST BEER EVER.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,currysage1,4.22,"I don't know about you but a little toy really does buy a good review. New Christmas ornament!  Not much head to this one but that is very characteristic of this style. Good clarity, but not easy to see through, too much malt in the way.  Really nice it almost smells a little like a Fig Newton, good bready smell mixed with dark sweet fruit.  Tasted of molasses and those same grainy breads, some chocolate there as well.  Feel was good, not exceptional, it had a little more carbonation than I like in a Dopplebock. Thick is a word that comes to mind so is that molasses word again.  Drinkability is ok, could session with this, but the thickness could overpower the want for another.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,hyland24,4.45,"Poured from a bottle with a plastic goat on it into a tall pilsner glass.  Poured smooth with an inch thick tan head which lasted maybe a minute or two. The beer was dark but had a ruby hue when held up to the light. The lacing was scattered and sporadic.  The smell was fruit mixed with alcohol with hints of raisin and smoke.  The taste was impressive. Malty start with a fruity slightly sweet finish. The aftertaste was pleasant. One of the more complex beers I have tasted with each sip tasting slightly different some spicy and some sweet.  Slightly carbonated that leaves behind a malty feel which last several seconds after the swallow.  This is a great beer that I would recommend to everyone, whether you care for this style or not. Not a session beer because of the fullness. I would recommend this beer with a heavy, sweet meal like Barbecue pulled pork, or ribs and brisket and maybe some cornbread.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Goliath,4.02,"Pours a dark brown, almost black, with deep ruby hues. A light tan head appears and quickly receeds leaving no trace of lacing.  The aroma is fairly complex. A big maltiness with caramel and molases. Some toasted bread and a slight bit of alcohol. There was a familiarity I couldn't quite put my finger on for a while, and then I began to think it smelled like the cereal Grape Nuts, but I could be losing my mind.  Taste is fairly powerful. Sweet malt with bready notes, and oats. Caramel also present. More flavors than I can determine at this time.  Mouthfeel is full, thick, chewy, and lightly carbonated eventually leaving a still brew as you near the end of the glass. Drinkability is moderate due to low alcohol levels but strong flavors.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,jongullotti,4.34,"This was one of the first good imports I had long ago that acted as a catalyst for helping me break into the world of quality beer. Just had another one last night:  Nice dark color. Aroma of sweet malts, candy, and nuts. Maybe because of my early experience, this tastes of the quintessential double bock - sweet malt, medium body, low hop presence, low carbonation, nutty finish. Very smooth and malty. Great beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Monkeyknife,4.2,"Poured from a bottle a deep dark brown color with a foamy off-white head. Nice lacing with this one.  Aroma of sweet malts, caramel, and brown sugar.

Sweeter than expected but not too much so.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Appearance is velvety dark chocolate with medium brownish head which was poured by server so glass 1 had two finger head and glass 2 had about 4 finger head! Malty, bready aroma with hints of coffee. Taste...I was in my own world with the taste, swirling it around and around. Malty of course with caramel tones, just outstanding with silky smooth mouthfeel to match. Just a pleasure. 6.7% ABV was not evident, was suprised to learn ABV was that high. Highly drinkable and hope to run across it real soon!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

It pours a dark red/brown color with some tan head. It dissipates slowly and reveals plenty of bubbles coming out of solution.  The smell is fairly complex. There is some dark sweet malts as well as some roasted smells. There is also a fruity smell, can't tell what it is by the smell.  The taste reveals that its a darker (possibly plum) flavor that I noticed in the aroma. All the rest of the smells translate to flavor as well. There is some sweet malts and a touch of roasted malt and even some hop bitterness but not too much.  Very smooth and refreshing. For as much complexity as this beer has its light enough to enjoy a large glass of with dinner.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,bisoubisou,4.8,"Doesn't taste like 6.7% at all. Nice balance of not-too-sweet maltiness, crispness, and body. It also doesn't taste as dark as it looks.

There is a tan head that turns white after settling for a bit. The head is composed of fine bubbles.  S: A nose of roasted malt is unmistakable with this beer. Possibly plum or fig as well.  T: Crisp and clean roasted malt taste. No bitterness or harsh after taste like some doppelbocks have.  M: Feels rather smooth in the mouth.  D: The crisp and clean taste with the lack of after taste makes this a very drinkable bock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The color is deep red-brown and it has a beutiful lasting light brown head. The flavor is sweet malty with very strong roasted notes; coffee, roasted bread, combined with caramel, alcohol, citrus, and more - great complexity.

39,131,Kegatron,4.53,"12oz bottle into a dimpled mug.  Pours a dark brown with some ruby highlights around the edges and a big 2+ finger widths of creamy tan head that retained down very nicely into a still fairly large layer that left thick swathes of lace down the sides of the mug. The aroma is caramel sweetness, brown sugars, raisens, just the tiniest waft of alcohol.  The taste starts out with a blast of sweetness and thick malts (with just a touch of hop bitterness) that gives way to just the lovliest flush of cocoa powder and dark fruits. Finishes thick and sweet on the lips. The mouthfeel is a rich, creamy feel with just a touch of warmth.  Wow, wow, and double wow! This is by far the best Doppel Bock I've had yet with just a ton of rich yet clean flavors and an incredible drinkability.

Well worth trying, but it didn't blow me away.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Jwale73,4,"Served in my Harpoon Oktoberfest mug. Poured a deep, dark brown with ruby highlights when the light hit the brew each time I took a sip. Two-fingered tan head subsided into a thin consistent skim of foam. Strong scent of dark fruit (figs, prunes), chocolate and perhaps molasses. Also seemed to have a slightly vinous fragrance. Taste similar to nose - dark fruit more pronounced as was as a strong malty backdrop. Effervescent tingly mouthfeel across the entire tongue finishing with a slight bit of astringency. Excellent brew. Wish I had discovered it sooner. Drinkable cold weather alternative to the big beers I usually consume.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Taste rosted grin figgy dryness Alcohol comes through in the end as well as a hint of bitter chocolate finish. This beer is very cleen tasting lager considering how complex it is if that makes sense. Drinkability was very good for a beer of its kind its a cold late winter night and I wish I had another doppelbock.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,jmalex,4.62,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. Definitely a great that comes from my favorite German brewery.  APPEARANCE: Pours a deep brown with lighter bronze highlights. The pale brown head starts vigorously and large and descends somewhat quickly to a large-bubbled collar and cap.  SMELL: Wonderfully smelling with a strong aroma of toasted grains, accompanied by chocolate, toffee, and some herbal and even vinous notes. All this while smelling distinctly like a lager.  TASTE: A clean flavor profile highlighted by grains at all points of the spectrum. Pale, toasted, roasted, and scorched malts all balance perfectly. Little else gets in the way with just a small noble hop presence serving to balance.  MOUTHFEEL: A shining example of what should be. Thick and chewy but still remarkably clean. Carbonation is at perfectly moderate levels.  DRINKABILITY: Drinkability is also excellent. The lower ABV (for a doppelbock) makes this a beer for anytime. It goes down so incredibly easy that I could really imagine wanting another.  I'll be coming back to this again and again. It's by far the best authentic German example of the style that I've tasted.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,IBUnit63,3.97,"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours like a Diet Coke - dark and carbontated with frothy pale head that dissipates quickly. Looks like powerful syrupy stiff.  German chocolate aroma - a little soft, a sour, sorta metal. After about 15 minutes it reveals a toasted nut texture - almost like pecan pie. Strong, smoked malt taste - a little too puckering at first but develops slowly. Still slightly sour. Alcohol and malt are there in force - could be a little better blended but still well-balanced. Short-to-medium finish. Carbonation is long gone a few minutes after pour - first sip is a little clammy; a few minutes later it's very soothing. This needs a little while to breathe, sort of like wine. Most likely best enjoyed in a dark, warm setting - bar, ski lodge, German brew haus, etc. - powerful, well-made stuff.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,logdogg,4.48,"This beer poured good got about 3 fingers head and some nice lacing. Dark black color and tan head. Smells and tastes like a doppelbock should. Malts are a carmel dark bisky very palatable somewhat creamy taste and texture. A very smooth beer considering the style of beer. Not super hoppy, but a great balance with more dark roasted maltyness than hoppyness, with the right amount of bitterness. I would definately recommend this beer it is worth the price and the beer ornaments are dope. This is an outstanding world class doppelbock that is very complex and drinkable, I could pound 8 or more of these and enjoy everyone.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,IgotsHops,4.58,"What can I say? This is one of the best Belgium Dopplebocks, if not the best. Strong caramel and chocolate on the nose, some dark fruit and molasses bread. Tastes very similar to the smell, full and rich of dark malt, dark fruit, molasses, and roasted grain. A wonderfully complex but drinkable beer.

There was a little head that didn't last especially long, but left a little lacing around the glass that had a brownish color.  Strong but not overpowering smell. Very malty with hints of older, dark fruits.  The most apparent aspect of the taste was the presence of coffee - at least to me. It was somewhat similar to a stout in this respect. Also, there were some sweets, possibly caramels and some yeast as well.  Had a nice amount of carbonation for solid mouthfeel.  Overall, the Celebrator is a drinkable beer. It goes down very smooth, without an obnoxious aftertaste. Surprisingly not a beer that weighs you down.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ABCJiugui,4.22,"bottle from 4 pack with the little plastic icon  poured into sam adams' new pint glass  A- Dark brown, nearly black with red/auburn hues in light. Half finger of head recedes quickly to minimal head retention, with creamy brown color.  S- Molasses, maltose/malt sugars, dried fruit (persimmon?) Upon exhaling, alcohol leaves nasal passages with a slight burn reminiscient of hot spices/chiles.  T- Malt sweetness is immediate, almost too sweet at first but is balanced by hop bitterness in the finish that is just enough. Scorched caramel, coffee, slighty bready flavors take a backup role but are present. Well balanced.  M- ridiculously smooth- silken on the tongue, carbonation hits quickly, but becomes mild as it finishes quickly and lifts away the malt sweetness, preventing it from being overpowering.  D- overall, I grew to like this beer more and more as I drank it (and I have issues with maltose/molasses flavors). I don't know if I could drink more than one at a sitting- I feel it needs food cause the abv seems to sneak up on you due to its insane smoothness going down, perhaps a meal of sausages or game with german black bread. Definitely something to warm you during the cold winter, goes great with a hearty stick-to-your ribs meal (heavy bean stews- had it with Publick House's cassoulet before).",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The pour yeilds a small, creamy off-white head, with great lacing, and a dark brown body. It nearly looks like a porter. The flavor is quite nice with a lightly sweet yeasty taste.

Dark brown with red tinges. Looks a lot like cola, actually. Nice fluffy head that slowly became a layer of froth. No real lacing, though. The nose is very sweet. Quite bready with lots of dark fruits layered on top of that. There were also notes of caramel. Taste is pretty complex, with a lot of flavors coming in different waves. First is a great malty taste. Almost like sweet bread. Then comes dark fruits, such as raisins, figs, and prunes. This is followed with an aftertaste of sassafras. VERY well done. Feels very creamy in my mouth.

T - Chocolate, plums, and a slight alcoholic presence but with enough hop bitterness to balance things out.  M - Rich and full bodied - very malty. Moderate carbonation.  D - Not bad but not my favorite style. My wife absolutely loves this beer. I could drink one or two but that would be it for me. I gave it a 4.5 on the drinkability because my wife just came by and smacked me for giving it a 4 - she says it should be all 5's.

Nice tan head that has good retention. The smell is amazing. Every time I have one of these I sit and smell it for at least a minute, and am amazed that I find something new almost every time I nose this beer. Dark malt, brown sugar, hops, chocolate, dark beers, caramel. I could go on. Taste matches the smell. With tons of dark rich malt flavors. Chocolate, and brown sugar.

Almost a bit tart up front as well.  M - Light fizz on the tongue with a medium body. Soft.  D - Very drinkable for a stronger brew.

Some toffee in the back.  T: Dark malt city. Brown sugar and hints of candy.  M: Excellent. Med to Heavy body. Carbonation is perfect for this beer.  D: Very drinkable. The problem for me with bocks is that the malt can become so overpowering as to render the beer undrinkable. Ayinger took it down a notch and it helps the overall drinkability.

Taste: Deep malt flavor is full of sugar. Mild hop presence keeps this beer intact. Biscuits, leather, roasted almonds. Dark fruit of plum, fig and raisin. Intense flavor.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and slightly bittering. Carbonation is ample. Medium high body. Alcohol is a lingering component. Belly warming.  Drinkability: Pretty good. This beer is intense for how little alcohol it contains. Usually a beer with such flavor is higher in alcohol. This is a very good one, but not as good as the Schneider version I enjoyed last night. Definitely worth trying.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A - Very dark chocolate brown, almost opaque but can see plumish hues to it as well. A nice thick creamy, bubbly head that left lacing down the glass.  S- alot of sweetness coming off of this one as well; smell mixtures of fruit, mostly the grape and plum. Also a bit of chocolate and toffee like sensations.  T - wow this is a really good beer that literally blew me away the first time I put my mouth on it. Loads of malt in it and can taste sweetness but it is not at all overpowering. The taste is a lot of plum, brown sugar, molasses is there too. Rather sweet but it is not at all overpoweringly sweet; it is actually rather well balanced as well. The aftertaste is a little less plummy but that is mostly what I note; also a nice warming alcohol taste which is necessary to offset some of the sweetness. Leaves a nice roasted flavor in the mouth as well.  MF - A light carbonation, not too sticky either; a little bit thin but pretty good. Leaves a slight tingly aspect on your tongue.  D - For such a big beer this is very drinkable. I think I could drink these one after another and definitely one that I would pick up again if I saw it out lying it around.

T - beautiful. somehow everything good about lagers gets distilled, darkened, and concentrated in this german classic. dark candy sweetness, but not a whole lot of cocoa here, mostly caramel, toffee, molasses, that sort of thing. just enough residual smokiness to remind you of its german heritage. maybe a bit too much smoke on the finish, but really it's quite a work.

D - i don't know if i could drink this all night, but a full pint would certainly be doable. i'm normally a stout/porter/wee-heavy kind of dude, but this is an excellent alternative/addition to the dark beer offerings that i can foist on those that normally turn their noses at whatever i happen to be drinking. this is the gold standard of doppelbocks for a reason.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,srandycarter,4.46,"Into the tulip.  A - Slightly hazy dark brown/caramel with small head, sudsy light lacing.  S - Deep malt, bready, heady, bit of dark fruit.  T - Oh yes. Major dark malt presence - dark, cooked fruit, brown sugar and satisfying bitterness to finish almost neutral.  M - Big, heavy, full, coating and just the right amount of carbonation.  D- A sipper. Savor it. Could wear your palate out after a few.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,deltatauhobbit,4.8,"Pours a dark brown with lots of red hues. Plenty of head, disappears at a moderate pace.  Smells is quite malty, lots of caramel, possibly some chocolate and coffee as well.  The taste is very malty, with a nutty sensation. Caramel lingers on the tongue, not too sweet though, the coffee/hop bitterness makes a very nice balance to this beer.  Went down very smooth with just the right amount of carbonation, I found I drank it much faster than I should have and regret not savoring it more. I'll definitely be visiting this beer again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,JohnGalt1,4.01,"12oz from Bucket O'Brew for about $3.75 (I think).. shared grudgingly with Brenda.. the lion's share from my New Belgium goblet.  One Finger Light tan head dies fairly quickly leaving behind a suprising amount of lacing... deeep brown brew... only reveals walnut/deep ruby highlites when held up to a bare bulb.  Dark bread and subtle molasses are the name of the game.. some dark caramel... only a touch of dried fruit comes through.. figs I guess... as it warms it reminds me of a cold mocha coffee without the sugars.  Flavor is complex dark malts.. and a waft of raisin and a little more dark caramel... light but present nuttiness... not alot of chocolate or coffee, just a touch. For me, the complexity lies in the dark malts.. very tasty... subtle noble hops are easily overlooked... I always walk into Celebrator remembering a bigger body, but the body is really just a solid medium with a creamy carbonation and mouthfeel... with warmth comes a touch of smokey/mild peatiness.  I know that what I am enjoying is world-class, although my simplistic palate is not refined enough to really describe it..",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Proteus93,4.52,"This was a real treat, and I'm very pleased to have taken the time out to choose this one for a tasting this evening. In my opinion, a champion dopplebock, and among the top of its class:  A: Deep, deep chocolate brown (almost black) with a huge, 3 finger head (very likely due to the bottle being shaken about a bit, as it started to foam as soon as the cap came off). A very attractive pour.  S: Rich, deep cocoa/chocolate notes, hints of black liquorice, mild flowery aromas. A bit of hops and alcohol in there.  T: Chocolate, almost a brown sugar flavour on the tongue, followed by a mild hops finish. Perhaps notes of roasted coffee and dark fruit. Very warm flavours, not overwhelming in the least - alcohol is very well hidden... delicious.  M: I am fond of the mouthfeel of a good dopplebock... rich, full bodied, somewhat heavy but not overly syrupy and sticky. This, I find to be a fine example of that.  D: Taste-wise, it's magnificent. A reasonably low ABV, considering the style, though naturally not the kind of thing to suck back a 6 of on a sunny afternoon. Wonderful to savour, and one I will definitely be going back for.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,beerN3RD,4.87,"As the 1,000 review of this beer i want to try and make this a good review. As i poured this brew it had a light caramel colored head that was beautiful, but did seem to not last that long. Was decent though. The color of this is a dark rich black/brown color. When looked at through the light i can see hints of red as well though. The smell is of brown sugar, molasses, caramel, and a nice roasted barley malt. Nutty wood chocolaty brew that pleases the taste buds. Mouthfeel was a mild to medium carbonation with a slight aftertaste and dry. Drinkability is high on this one, one of the better dark beers i have ever had. I would definitely urge anyone to go out there try this one.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,pwoods,4.65,"This'll be it's 999th review. One off! :)  330ml brown bottle, purchased at Belmont Party Supply, poured into a fluted glass. Appears to be dating notches on the bottom of the label but that's retarded.  A: Pours a walnut brown with some ruby hues when back lit. 1 1/2 fingers of toffee head form and makes a casual descent, laying at a skim of cream. Bits of patchy lacing.  S: Malty and caramel smells. A touch of chocolate covered cashews and some flat cola. The faintest of smokiness. Subtle but complex.  T/M: Exactly the same as the nose. Little bits of chocolate, nuts, flat cola and an even fainter smokiness. Delicious caramel malts blanket the tongue with some raisin sweetness. Body is medium full and carbonation is controlled.  D: Easily lives up to the hype. Very tasty and easy to consume. I'll definitely have this again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,elmore,4.12,"Pours a dark brown with a minimal fizzy head that receded rapidly with little lace left behind.  Smells of sweet maltiness: brown sugar, molasses and some dark fruits. Has a taste similar to the smell with a hint of bitter hops and burnt malt aftertaste.  Very minimal carbonation and a somewhat watery mouthfeel. Smooth character and low ABV make this very drinkable.  Overall a very pleasant beer that is very drinkable. A little disappointed with the low carbonation and the weak head though.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,TheodorHerzl,3.85,"This beer pours a deep mahogany with a very thin head that left just a swirl of itself for most of the beer. Malt is the strongest scent coming through, but there are scents of bread and brown sugar coming to life. The taste is packed with the malt showing flavors of coffee and dark chocolates. Possibly some dark fruits (raisins?) in there as well, but they are not very pronounced. It has a really nice smooth and creamy mouthfeel that is full bodied with low carbonation. This beer goes down quite easily and has very good drinkability with its moderate alcohol content.  Outstanding for the style and overall a really nice beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,SMark,4.5,This beer was poured from a 330ml bottle at 53° into a pint glass. The beer was dark brown and almost appeared black with less than 1 finger of tan head. Minimal lacing was noticed when the head dissipated.  There was a very sweet caramel malt aroma with faint chocolate in the background.  The taste was not as sweet as expected but was sweet and smooth with coffee tastes covering up the caramel and chocolate. This one also went down very smooth with a bit of bitterness on the tip of the tongue at the end.  This comes close to overwhelming the mouth all around and then clears out so you are ready for another taste. Conversation with friends is recommended with this one to keep you from drinking too quickly also.  I think this is one of those full bodied beers that packs a little punch if you try to make it a session beer because it goes down so well. A nice effort which I will need to return to on occasion.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Upgrayedd,4.6,"This bottle is probably about a year old, as I purchased this 4 pack early last spring. I couldn't stand to age this much longer and had to drink this last one. There is not much I can say about this beer that hasn't already been said. It is wonderfully tasteful without being overly sweet. Its viscousness is also a bit thin compared to American versions, but I like that. One thing to note is that I remember the first couple of bottles having a slight smokey flavor, while this aged bottle had none.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,AleDrinkToThat,5,"A: Deep mahogany with a perfect two-finger tan head. Mouth-wateringly good-looking.  S: The sweet bread-like maltiness as well as caramel really permeate the air, and the hoppy spice is immediately noticeable, too. It's heavenly.  T: Fan. Tastic. Rich, complex malty taste of yeast and caramel, with a molasses-like sweetness. It's the kind of taste that never, ever gets old or boring.  M: It flows so smoothly over the tastebuds with reckless abandon. The carbonation is pretty muted, which is wonderful for my tastes.  D: Any time of the day or night, it's wonderful. I don't think I could ever tire of it. The taste and aftertaste is enough goodness to make a grown beer enthusiast cry.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,bunnyhustle,4.42,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into mug, was excited cause I dont get to use my mub much but it seemed perfect for this brew. Pours very, very dark mahogany color. Thick and creamy off-white head. Retention is ok, very little lacing. Smell is of dark malts, some brown sugar, and a touch of roasted grain. Little bit of dark fruit as well, raisin perhaps? Fig? Taste is exceptional. Sweet and malty at first, then a touch of dark fruits and ends with a slightly bitter note on the back of the tounge. Very warm feeling and a kiss of alcohol as it goes down. Mouthfeel is perfect. Smooth and creamy, light carbonation, just absolutly terrific. Nice and full feel to it. Overall a great beer. Everything goes terrific together, Ayinger created an amazing beer here.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,champ103,4.65,"A: A very dark ruby color with one of the most massive white, almost tan, heads that I have seen in a beer. Loads of a lace, and a great looking beer. S: An awesome sweet dark malt, brown sugar, and chocolate aroma comes billowing out of my pint glass. Roasted caramel malt. Another wonderful aspect of this beer. T: Similar to the nose. Dark roasted malt, caramel, and brown sugar. Lots of chocolate and toffee. A delicious beer. M/D: Incredibly creamy and smooth. So easy to drink. There is not a hole lot I can say, just fantastic.  OK, this beer is out of control. One of the best in world IMO. Simply amazing.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Very opaque with frothy head that never quits.  Smells malty, a great attribute for a beer of this genre'.  Tastes malt, molasses, some hop and very light alcohol. Fills your mouth with flavor.  Feels almost perfect. Smooth, creamy and coats the tounge perfectly.  One of my favorite beers to date! I have had a lot of beers in my years and I always look forward to my next Celebrator. VERY drinkable but a shame to drink quickly.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Starts with lots of molasses, brown sugar, caramel, malt, and persimmon flavors. The middle has a little more fruity edge with prunes and over ripened black cherries. The finish is more or less roasty with a residual sweetness. There is some spice in the finish as well; clovey.  Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and very pleasant on the tongue. This is an easy drinker especially during the colder months and a must drink for any beer enthusiast. No in your face flavors, just good old fashion balance and drinkability.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Homerbag,4.17,"Almost pure black with frothy head that never goes away.  Smells malty, malty, and did I mention malty. Just what you would want out a dopple.  Tastes malt, molasses, some hop and very light alcohol. This is like liquid bread, but in a good way.  Feels almost perfect. Smooth, creamy and coats the tounge perfectly.  Very good beer. I enjoyed mine slowly just to enjoy a little more. The kids loved the trinket, but the beer is worth it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,tronester,4.05,"Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a medium tan head. Smells malty sweet, with just a touch of earthyness. Taste is malt dominated, with a roasted barley flavor.

I could drink several of these, a very tasty beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,mattster,4.4,"Poured cold 11.2 oz bottle into mug.  Very good dark brown, mostly opaque color. Very thin tan head, with some lacing.  Smell is of somewhat malty. Taste is nutty, slightly sweet, but not overwealming. Very nice smooth finish. This is my first experience with this beer and I'm quite impressed with it.  This beer is better suited as a dinner beer (I think) and would be a superb choice with a real starchy meal.

39,131,trkerrigan,4.11,"This is my first to exposure to the Doppelbock style... it seems as though I chose a great example for my first try.  The appearance was very dark, almost black color, with a hint of ruby. Head was nothing special, started with an expected tan and dissipated quickly.  Aroma was basically malty nothing really overpowering.  The taste had great flavors and complexity. The boldest flavors were of coffee and mocha, with caramel adding sweetness. There were also slight fig and raisin notes to deepen the flavor  Little carbonation resulted in a smooth mouth feel. Even thought this brew seemed heavy it was also very easy to put down, a very drinkable beer for sure.  All around the Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock is an excellent brew, and to add the joy, the best part is if you buy this around the holidays you get x-mas tree ornaments! (As there are nice little goat figurine ornaments on the bottles Score!)",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Gmann,4.08,"Pour a very dark brown color with some ruby hightlights, the head is nothing special and dissipated into a light ring around the glass. The smell is lightly roasted malt and perhaps some fig, not as strong as I thought. The taste is quite good, a nice mocha character that is created by some caramel that I am picking up and the roasted malt. Has notes of dark fruit and some spice but nothing that I can put a name to, which is fine as it lets the malt speak for itself. The feel is well bodied with fairly soft carbonation, very smooth; finishes rather balanced for such a malty brew.

Yeasty, malty aroma with coffee grounds and dried fruit.  Toasty sweet malt flavors abound: coffee, milk chocolate, molasses, caramel. There is a slight hop flavor and a slight pepperiness. Fruity esters come into play with warmth.  Modest carbonation results in a big chewiness. Smooth and sweet. Drinkability is great.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Aromas of molasses, dark bread, and various candied things.  Chewy toasted malt and molasses, plenty of both. Faint hop bitterness. A shade of dryness comes through before a sugary finish, not unlike that of oversweetened black coffee. Mouthfeel is a little oily, a little creamy.  So this is a real Doppelbock. Excellent.

Drinkability is pretty high, should age nicely.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,BlaiseDemon,4.17,"Very dark but when held up to a bright light, a deep dark red color shines through. Not much head on pouring, however, easily duplicated by a light swirling action. The aroma is sweet like wheatgrass and almost brown-sugar or molasses laced. Flavor is heavy on the carmel bordering on candied dates, slight nuttiness with a maple character which becomes more robust after breathing for a few minutes just creeping into a currant note. It has a smooth, almost creamy feel to the palate but somewhat heavy. A lightly bitter bouquet balances the sweetness very well, making it very drinkable. A great choice for doppelbok fans and anyone who likes to dabble in stouts and porters primarily. A nice experience that highlights the Bavarian character of this style of bier.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

After sipping on this one for so long I felt like I was drinking my meal. It certainly is filling.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,tsbuttry,4.5,"Being a fan of most every kind of Bock out there, I went to the Brickskeller in DC one evening and asked the bartender for a good dopplebock. She came back with Ayinger Celebrator and I found a good beer to celebrate special occasions with.  Appearance: Perfect. Good dark color, full head, nice lacing.  Smell: The maltiness reaches out to you, grabbing hold like a lover and holds on, making you feel good (felt like being artsy fartsy for a second).  Taste: The beer's a true dopplebock. Excellent, complex malty flavor. It's hard to pick up all of the notes in this beer, goading you into drinking more of it. The half point is deducted simply because I'm a minor hophead.  Mouthfeel: Feels great in the mouth, perfect carbonation, but like many low-hop beers, it leaves too much of an aftertaste.  Drinkability: Perfect with food or a couple at a time, but it's a bit too filling and robust to be a good session beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,redmagik99,4.06,"Poured a pretty dark brown, almost stouty black. nice head that lasted a good while, then leaving some froth and lacing. Smells not too far from the average dopplebock - very sweet malt. Taste had plenty of that of course. Lots of roasted coffee-toffee-caramel sweetness. Also very creamy. It goes down very easily for 6.7. A heavier session? Fine by me. This beer may not live up to all the hype but it may just be because I'm a little tired of the style.

Aroma- The aroma is inviting with a nice malt presence, and plenty of malt sweetness. Some toasted malts.  Taste- Wonderful mix of malt sweetness, with the perfect undertones of toastiness, bittering and flavoring hops, a barest hint of coffee. Very well done.  Mouthfeel- Almost perfect. Slightly heavy, syrupy body with the perfect level of CO2 to drive the flavors up front without killing your taste-buds.

Tons of dark fruit character such as prune and fig. Toasted malts and a pronounced nuttiness also make their presence known.  The previously mentioned characteristics come through strong in the taste as well, along with chocolate, coffee, and just the faintest hint of alcohol.  The mouthfeel on this one isn't quite as thick and creamy as I remember, but is still very pleasing to the palate. The carbonation prickles the tongue lightly and is dialed in just right.

39,131,Metalmonk,4.72,"Pours out a light tan head that doesn't retain very well, thinning to a crown quickly. Color is a soupy deep-brown/almost-black thing that glows with a ruby tinge when held up to light.  Aroma is beyond malty...a lively, nutty, sweet aroma reminding of pumpernickel, toffee, chocolate syrup. Hell, it's almost futile comparing this to anything. If you've had a few of these, you come to learn this is simply ""Celebrator"".  Same goes for the flavor. If you know this one already, you'll never mistake it. Everything in the aroma comes out even stronger in the flavor, bringing along frothed milk, burnt raisin, a very slight hint of smoke, soil, more nuts, more chocolate. And more frothed milk. All bolstered by a substantial, slick, thick mouthfeel that is simply superb.  A German classic. And of the best bottles ever, considering the plastic goat on the bottle neck (the grown-up equivalent of the free toys you used to get in cereal boxes?) and the old-time/timeless label drawing.

I've had this many times in Ayinger's designated flute, and it looks better that way, but for some reason I don't have one!  The smell is rich and sweet, yet soft, dark fruits and toffee  Taste is big and thick, super malty but not to sweet nor rich, a fantastic balance. Caramel and roasty, Ayinger's is the benchmark dopplebock, period. A truly great beer.  Mouthfeel is very creamy, the body on the heavier side.  Drinkablity is almost to high.

Very dark brew, impenetrable, little to no highlights, and capped by a dense brown head that stays around for a long time, leaves a nice thick collar and lacing. Aroma is delicious, although slightly more delicate than I expected. Caramel, toffee, some unexpected (to me) smokiness, alcohol, all blending quite nicely. Minimal carbonation in this medium bodied (I expected a bit more body) brew lends it a very smooth, velvety palate Flavor is just what you want from a doppelbock; sweetish malts, dark fruits, caramel, molasses, the same smokiness although a bit more pronounced. Some mild bitterness and alcoholic warmth and dryness is there to prevent it from being cloying, and it all blends perfectly.

Great sweetness held in check perfectly by just the right amount of spicy hops.  M- Smooth as silk, very full boddied.

I'm not sure that I can come up with enough wonderful things to say about it. From the wonderful dark brown appearance to the smooth, chocolatey, malty taste, this beer never fails to amaze me. The first one that I ever drank totally changed the way that I look at beer. I made the mistake of drinking it freezing cold and it was still delicious. I now let this beer warm to almost room temperature before even picking it up and it gets better everytime I experience it.

I can barely see my fingers through the glass. Nice retention. I poured into another glass for the rest of the bottle. The appearance becomes insane.  Smell is of apple phenol with THICK ass caramel malts with some chocolate malts in the back with some raisin and grape.  Taste is rich and robust. Caramel malts are aggressive with a nice touch of chocolate malts. Raisin and fruity undertones come out as well. Some grape notes come out as the beer warms. Hop bitterness is mild and just there to cut the sweetness alittle bit. Holy shit. This is the best double bock that I've ever had.  Mouthfeel is smooth as hell with a delicate creaminess. WOW!

39,131,Rainintheface,4.5,"I had my first taste of this at The German Beer Fest and was floored. I don't know why it took so long to pick some up.  A: ruby-shaded brown, dark, with nice 1+ finger foamy off white head  S: sweet caramel malt, dark fruits, chocolate  T: caramel malt, apricots, plums, raisins  M: full bodied, creamy, and chewy  D: wonderful beer to sip. not one you'd overindulge in but awesomely drinkable",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,sinistrsam,4.57,"I bought a case of this wonderful beer. I especially like the label adn the goat icon hanging around the neck of each bottle. Poured a very dark ruby brown, with a medium tan foamy head. Looked rather watery. The smell was outstanding; Rich spice and toasted bread, chocolate, caramel malts, dark fruits, vanilla and definitely some honey. Very complex and impressive. The taste was heavy on the caramel malt and spice, dark fruits and honey. Raisin for sure. This was fmedium to full-bodied, exceptionally smooth and creamy, with mild carbonation and a great long aftertaste. Overall, this definiteyl lives up to the hype and is an excellent beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,MiScusi,4.07,"A- Dark brown with a red glow to it. Sudsy bubbly head. S- bittersweet chocolate. Certainly not overpowering but strong enough to precede what you are about to taste. T- weak chocolate malt is all I can really get from it. It definitely has a certain lager quality to it, but the taste is very one dimensional in semi-sweet chocolaty malt. Not too complex, but good. M/D- The mouthfeel might make this beer very drinkable. So smooth. No prickly or burning carbonation, but overall the beer just kind of lulls me to sleep.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Dopplebock,4.7,"Although served from the bottle, this beer has it all! A wonderful malt fragrance carries the dark mahogany colored liquid as it pours into the glass. The mouthfull combines chocolate and caramel malt with a minimal hop presence. Smooth as silk, this dopplebock has an exceptional drinkability. The finish is moderately sweet with hints of vanilla. This beer is for one who truly wants complex levels of flavor! Let it warm to room temperature (recommended), and you open yet more complex flavors. I am not sure I've even experienced the full palate of flavors in this exceptional brew!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,SargeC,4.57,"Appearance: Beautiful black with a dense, tan head.  Smell: Caramel, coffee and rich malt with an undercurrent of hops.  Taste: Sweet malt and coffee. Scorched caramel and toffee. A faint hint of hops finishes the flavor off.  Mouthfeel: Dense liquid with a waxy quality that allows flavor to linger. A real stick to your ribs brew.  Drinkability: This beer is a treat. I am glad I finally found it. I have hunted for this beer for years. I am glad I finally made the kill.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Gehrig,3.97,"I just finished this good dopplebock, the first time I tried it, and was not disappointed. It pours a nice head, but one that is short in duration. The color is practically black. The flavors are nice--a bit of chocolate and coffee--but the aromas are not as prominent as I would have liked. The smooth texture atones for the modest aromas, and I would certainly request a second. Celebrator is solid overall, not outstanding but quite good and worth trying.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,goochpunch,4.25,"Pours out a dark, raisin-like color with a thinnish khaki head. Aroma is dark dried fruits, brown sugar, bread, and a tinge of alcohol. Flavor is very sweet and just about mirrors the aromas, aside from an absence of alcohol in the taste. Brown sugar and raisins are big in the forefront with some roasty malts in the background. Mouthfeel isn't too heavy, but has a stickiness to it. Carbonation is mild and gentle. Really good drinker and one of the better doppelbocks I've had.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,joeskirkie,3.82,"Finally after about three years I can pair a Celebrator with my Celebrator glass.  It's dark, thats fur sure. Damn near opaque. It was a very healthy head, it dissipated within a short period.  The nose consists of dark chocolate, toffee and cherry hints, whats not to like?  Same stuff on the tongue, chocolate, cherry, toffee, some bitterness and alcohol. The bitterness is strong but very balanced.  Medium to heavy mouthfeel. I definitely dig it. I am satisfied. I'd order another.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Taste was initialy sweet with a slightly bitter finish. Smooth with alchohol lingering but not for to long. A slow sipper. I could enjoy more than one of these at a time and would definitly drink this again. I'm a big fan of a dopplebock and I can see these becoming one of the top ones for me.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,likestoswallow,4.33,"Pint bottle from Bevmo. Poured a dark brown that only a trace of light will shine thru. Head was tan and faded to about 1/4 inch and held. Aroma is strong with coffee, chocolate, anise and burnt toast. Flavor mirrored the aroma. Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with light by effective carbonation. Hops were well integrated and hardly noticeable. Finish is long and smooth with some additional burnt cedar wood. Overall this is one great beer, my only complaint is that the bottle is too small, this should be served in a bomber.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Amalak,4.72,"Out of the bottle, it is dark brown/blackish. Good head, dissipates somewhat quickly, good lace. Thick coffee chocolate smell, very heavy.  Thick and smooth in taste. Leaves a chocolately trace in the mouth. So smooth, it goes down great.  Off topic somewhat, it comes with a little ornament...classy. Really a high quality brew. Heavy dark brew, that leaves you completely satisfied.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,TheTrevor,4.2,This beer poured a very dark brown with red highlights and a two-finger tan head. The smell is rich with a large amount of toasty-smelling malts and a slight hint of freshly baked dark bread. There is also a slight sweet smell that is slightly reminiscent of raisins. The taste is starts off a little sweet with a little bit of caramel and molasses taste with a malty undertone followed by a slight hint of hops that reminds me of unsweeted cocoa or bittersweet chocolate. The alcohol taste is present but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is slightly-chewy and perhaps a bit oily in a way that isn't at all unpleasant. This is definitely a beer worth savoring.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,afinepilsner,4.5,"11.2oz brown bottle  Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock was a deep mahogany color with a tan head. The head had good retention and left some spotty lacing. The aroma was toasty with toffee and caramel. The taste was very malty with molasses, dried fruit, and chocolate. It was sweet upfront with a semi-dry finish. It was medium-full bodied with nice carbonation. Drinkability was excellent. This beer is definitely worth trying.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,fitzy84,4.33,"What a great pour! Really dark bock; a mix of black and brown colors thickly settling in the glass. The smell was wicked good: a dense hint of cocoa perhaps. The drink was smooth and light. It had a well-developed taste, so it was not something you could just drink without savoring. It was deliciously strong; a well-worth it drink for those who want to drink something with soul.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,LeftyBWS,3.93,"Poured from a 12 oz. dark brown bottle into a Sam Adams pint glass. A: A darkish brown color with some deep amber tones. A very full 2 inch layer of bubbly/foamy light brown head comes with the pour and recedes quickly at first but does leave a thin layer atop the brew. There's also some spotty, slippery lacing that melts down the glass. S: Full and sweet malts predominate the smell, with notes of chocolate, deep fruit and an earthy grassiness. T: Fairly full of chocolate malts and mild sweetness.There's an interesting grassy flavor that shows up in the midtaste and then blends into some caramel/chocolate malts that lead into the finish. Overall, a really solid, smooth taste. Not much variation in the flavors, but what it offers is quite tasty. M: Solid and smooth. Clearly heavy, given the flavors, but not imposing. D: Pretty good. Refreshing and filling.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The Taste is sweet and malty, but very complex and very enjoyable. Mouthfeel senses moderate carbonation and goes down smooth with a bitter aftertaste. I had this beer several years ago, but never reviewed it. I forget what I was missing out on. This one can't get much better.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Trueant1,4.82,Pours a dark brown with a nice lasting head.  Smells like sweet roasted malts. Smells wonderfull.  Taste is all about balance. A balance between all the tastes coming from malts to the carbonation and the lighter hops.  This beer is wonderfully smooth and a bit creamy.  An all time favorite with me and my friends. For a special occasions.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S: Smell is light, yeast, some breadiness, a bit of sweetness.  T: Lots of malt in this one. Some brown sugar, molasses, caramel, and a bit of breadiness make this one up. Pretty tasty overall.  M: Smooth with a slightly crisp finish.  D: This is a great example of a doppelbock.

39,131,jackorain,3.5,"This was on tap at City Limits Diner in Stamford CT. Unfortunately, I think the CO2 balance was off at this place. My colleque had the same flat, but tingly carbonation feeling about the SA Oktoberfest.  A-Dark brown with a burgundy head. Nearly filled to the rim by the bartender. 1/8 inch head fell to nothin in the time it took her to bring it from the tap to my spot at the bar.  S-I only get caramel malt and a little yeast. Unforntunately this is probably due to the bad pour combined with the out of whack CO2.  T-Sweet caramel malt. Alcohol tatste. Slight bitterness on the finish  M-Full body, flat but tingly carbonation. Odd.  D-I just didn't enjoy this one, real bad way to finish the evening.

39,131,jdubjacket,4.22,This should be a staple in every doppelbock's lover's refrigerator. Pours a deep brown with minimal lacing. Taste is very well balanced between the hops and the malts. Beer is very nearly chewy when you're drinking it. It's drinkability is relatively high due to the mere 6.7 ABV.  Highly recommend this brew.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,AMo,4.75,"Celebrator pours a lot darker that the picture shown, which was reviewed before the picture currently shown. I'd say its more black, with a hint of amber if held up to the light. The smell is strong of chocolate and malts. This is also very evident in the taste which is complimented with a nice smooth, yet thick mouthfeel.

39,131,dnichols,4.42,"I poured a 330 ml chilled bottle into a frosted challis.  A: It poured a dark, dark hue that when held to back light had a distinct ruby red tint. The head was a latte rich brown but only about a half finger tall. It dissipated quickly leaving a slight ring around the collar of the glass. Dispite the slight retained head there was an even lackign that followed the brew as it was consumed.  S: There was a distinct aroma of milk chocolate, toffee and raisins.  T: There was a wonderful light chocolate flavor complemented by a touch of licorice and raisins. The hops spice the brew with a taste of black pepper. It is lightly carbonated but the alcohol and hops leaves a warm clean palate with a hint of dark chocolate.  M: Moderate to full body with a warm clean aftertaste.

I'll be back again and again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The beer smells like sweet caramel/chocolate and heavily roasted malt.  Fantastic taste. Lots of roasted malts, with a little bit of fruity sweetness--the sweetness of the malt, and a caramel taste, and almost a grape taste in the background.  It's light and smooth in the mouth, and worth just rolling around for a moment.  Very drinkable, and a very, very good beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S: Very malty, some brown sugar, with a slight hint of smoke, some chocolate.  T: Very tasty, very malty, lots of brown sugar and just baked dark rustic bread. There is definitely a chocolate note to this beer, milk chocolate mostly, a beautiful, complex malt flavour that is a delight to drink.  M: Lighter than what I would expect for such a big beer, smooth and creamy, close to a dessert in a glass.  D: A great dopplebock, I'd rank it slightly below Salvator, but it is still a great lager beer, and the first truly great beer that I ever had, a beer that made me go, ""Wow! That's good!"", so it will always hold a special place for me, one of Ayinger's and Germany's best.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,younger35,3.8,"Picked this up a couple weeks ago at my local beer store. Have had this before on cask during Oktoberfest. I wasnt too impressed with it then but I know Ill like this better. Drank out of my Laughing Dog pint glass.  Appearance- Pours a super dark amber-brown with a lovely foamy two finger sand tan head. Leaves great cap and collar along with superior lacing. Great looking brew. Smell- Surprisingly fruity. Plums, raisins and other assorted dark fruits fill the nose. Light malt smokiness with a touch of something that smells like peanut brittle. Smell reminds me a lot of HotD Adam. Taste- Starts out with a touch of malty sweetness that is not cloying in the least. Again, like the nose there is a slight smokiness but not as prevalent as the smell. Lightly fruity but not distracting from the malt body. Also there is a slight spicy pepperiness (definitely not a word) and hints of black licorice. Alcohol shows very very slightly. Mouthfeel- Slightly thick and slick with mild carbonation and very slight warming on the back of the throat. Drinkability- I really enjoyed this beer although I probably wouldnt find myself drinking it on a regular basis. I liked it much better than on cask (although I think the liters of Oktoberfest I had before might have had a bit of effect on my judgement). Its a fairly enjoyable beer with lots of big complex flavors.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,iconoklaztor,4.14,"The appearance is good as to be expected. This is a dark brew but light is able to penetrate the beer. Not as dark as a stout. The smell is great! Two sniffs...mouth open...the whole deal is well worth it. I was hoping the taste would have been as great as the smell. The taste is good at best. Seems to be a little weak with an average mouth feel. The best part is the time it spends after you swallow. With all the talk around my friends about this beer, I must admit I am a little disappointed in this beer. Its certainly a top 100 but I was expecting more.  I tried a second bottle yesterday! It was much better the second time around for me than the first. The taste was still a little weak but it was good for its style. I would say the mouthfeel was a little better this time around as was the smell! Still not my favorite but its a top 100.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smells of dark chocolate, figs, raisins, some roasted malts and a bit of spice.  Tastes much of the same: sweet malts, dark chocolate, molasses, with a lot of sweet dark red fruits throughout. Ends with a mild dark chocolate bitterness.  Mouthfeel was full-bodied and creamy. Very nice!  Overall, one of the best doppelbocks out there. Very drinkable, ver enjoyable!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Bitterbill,4.72,"Purchased at Wilbur's in Ft Collins.  It pours from 330ml bottle a clear dark brown with reddish highlights and a very small head of foam with almost no lacing.  The smell of caramel malt hits my nose before I even get close to the glass..lots of dark fruit like fig also there in abundance. Wonderful smell!  The taste is big on the sweet malt and has notes of roasted malt, chocolate, fig, toffee, and just a touch of bitterness that I find mainly in the finish but it's more of a dark chocolate bitterness and it really gives a superb ending to a great DB.  More sips in and I'm beginning to notice the alcohol a bit; it's mainly a warming after the swallow. I wish I had picked up more than the 2 bottles I have.  The mouthfeel is kind of chewy, the carbo is fairly lightly done, and the aftertaste lingers on for some time and *that's* a plus. Best darn Doppelbock I've ever tasted and I couldn't recommend it more. Another great product from Ayinger!!!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The smell of it has a lot of spice to it and maybe some fruit. I sort of smell figs.  The taste of it is really very nice. It is really full tasting. Hints of coffee and spice. It has medium carbonation and really disguises the alcohol in it very well. It is not bitter at all in fact this beer borders on being sweet. Very very rich malt flavor. This is a really good tasting beer. Also this beer really gets better with each taste of it. Every time you pick it up a new taste appears.

S- Smell was of cherry, spices...  T- Taste was wondefl. Dried fruits (cherries, some dates), cinnamon, nutmeg, malts, and a distinct alcohol flavor.  M- Moutfeel was very sticky and thick, stuck to my tongue, throat, and all over my tastebuds.  D- My second doublebock and this one is to be reckoned with. This is truly a masterpiece.

You get a tinge of spicy alcohol  Taste/mouthfeel: A nice big malt feel w/ molasses spread throughout. The spicy alcohol and hop bitterness comes in the end to balance out the flavour. A touch of crystalized dark sugar linger in the mouth that goes well w/ this creamy smooth beer. What's amazing is you get the molasses/malt taste instantly and it is quickly washed away leaving a touch of spice leaving the mouth a touch dry. Wonderful  Drinkability: A very enjoyable doppelbock, and honestly the best one I've tried. Goes down great and taste delicious.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Big time malts present in the aroma with lots of carmel, plum fruit, and a touch of semi-sweet chocolate.  Flavor is equally as impressive, with a huge fruity-malt backbone matched up with a surprisingly strong alcohol note, brown sugar, and sweet bread. Mouthfeel is above average, with a creamy, yet crisp consistency, a great carbonation level, and a nice bitter finish. Definately a complex, flavorful beer. I'll surely have again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Nice, thick light brown head that settled to a neat ring around the level of the beer after a few moments... Smell was of dark chocolatey roasted malt, toffee, and a distinct plum/raisin essence. I ordered this beer after dinner and it smelled like I had made a great decision... The elevated abv seemed not to overpower, but rather to deliver the flavors to the tongue while wafting into the nasal cavity from the back of the throat! Kind of an awkward, anatomical description, but hard to explain otherwise... Very sensuous; silky and sweet... I sipped this beer for about 20 minutes and enjoyed every second.

A: Pours a really gorgeous deep opaque brown, when I started pouring it looked like there would be nearly no head, but as I continued I soon got a nice thick beige layer of foam that left behind some nice lacing. S: Roasted malts, chocolate, spice, some whiffs of earthy hops. Pretty mouthwatering. T: Chocolate and toffee up front, some darker fruit, the hops providing a beautifully clean finish. From the smell I was a bit concerned the sweetness would be overpowering, but there's a near perfect balance. M: Thick, chewy, long. D: I could drink this all night.

39,131,John_M,4.45,"Had not seen this beer on tap for a while, so was quite happy to see it at Frisco's the other day.  The beer pours a dark brown color, more akin to glass of cola then beer. This beer has very good head retention and lacing, as one would expect from a beer with this pedigree. The beer smells all malty and grainy, with a sweet molasses, cherry and cola. Very, very nice. On the palate the flavors replicate the nose, with lots of rich malt. However, everything is in proportion with this beer, nothing is out of place. The beer is medium to full bodied, but is not the least bit heavy. There is a good clean finish, with some nice roasty flavors at the end. Very easy to take.... so drinkable.  As others have noted, this really is the mother of all dopplebocks. First had this beer on tap at Humpy's during the ""fur rhondy"" festival in Anchorage (99 or 2000, forget now), when it was first brought into the state. It was excellent then and is excellent now. Always a treat. This is an excellent beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,fank2788,4.28,"11.2 oz bottle served in a tulip Celebrator pours a nice deep dark brown with a bunch of ruby highlights and a sticky off white head that does a lot of lacing. The smell is dark fruit, plums, grapes, red wine, a touch of dark bread and just a hint of spicy alcohol. The taste is molasses and dark grain without all the bitterness, dark fruity sweetness rounded out with a bit of spicy hops and alcohol. Mouthfeel is nice and chewy full the finish is slightly drying but there are plenty of residual sugars and a lingering fruityness. A pretty amazing beer in a way it is reminiscent of an English RIS which isn't a bad thing, a real winner.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,jcdiflorio,4.3,"Got this in a care package from Sudsdog,been meaning to review this favorite of mine just never picked some up. Opened up this box of beer and found this bottle at the bottom with a slight leak. The bottle hissed when i tried to twist the cap gave it a quick chill and it opened with a loud hiss. Saved it, seemed fine.  Poured into my Mad Elf tulip glass frome a 12oz brown bottle with a crimped cap, a froathy 2"" light tan head emerged,black in color,very opaque. Good retention could barley see some staggering tiny bubbles rising from the sides of the glass towards the top.  A nice dark fruit aroma first presents itself followed by sweet maltiness,vinious,with complex fruit notes of green apples and raisins and dried plums.Has a nice pleasing tartness throughout the aroma.  Vinious tastes prevail,with lots of dark fruit and a nice sweet maltiness with a burnt edge, with some anise/slight licorace.Very good balance had a dry wine like finish leaving a dark fruitness lingering on the palate. Tastes very similar to the aroma.  On the light side body wise for a doubble bock. Suprizingly smooth and drinkable.Has some characteristics remisent of a English style ale. Enjoyable experiance, a must try beer in my book.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,GbVDave,4.23,"Poured from two 11.2oz bottles into two tulip glasses. Thanks to HeatherAnn for the assist!  A: Deep, dark brown. Almost ebony. Creamy, khaki-colored, 1/4 finger head that recedes to a thin film and leaves sticky lace sheeting down the sides of the glass.  S: Big aromas of sweet malty goodness! Chocolate, caramel malt, raisin bread, figs, and a slight lemony hop smell.  T: The beginning is all chocolate and caramel malt. Followed closely by dark fruit, coconut, and brought to a close by a faint whisp of citrus/lemon.  M: Rich and creamy. Surprisingly bitter when cold, but becomes noticably thicker and creamier as it approaches room temperature.  D: In my opinion, this is one of the top two doppelbocks on the planet. Sweet and earthy and so very malty. An excellent treat!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Fruitcake, and dried figs.  T- Big malt sweetness. Lots of the smells come through in the flavors. Molasses, Fruitcake, pumpernickel, and fig. It is beautifully balance with hop bitterness. There is some roasted bitterness as well. The hop flavor doesn't shine through but at the finish there is the taste of hallertuer smell. (If that makes any sense)  M- A little chewy, but in a good way. Smooth and dangerously creamy. It has low/to moderate carbonation that leaves that lingering dried fruit character in your mouth.  D- Be careful with it.

Brought me back to my childhood when I would get prizes in the bottom of cereal boxes... except this is beer haha... Anyway, this one was poured into an imperial pint glass from the bottle. Black, and dark brown when held to light. Suffice to say, this is a very dark beer. Head is 2 and a half fingers thick after a hard pour and dark tan.  Smell: You can tell what's coming in the taste here... strong smell of roasted malts and chocolate. Very nice. Coffee grounds come into play somewhere.  Taste: Wow... This is a big, chewy meal in a glass... dessert to be exact. Full of dark chocolate at first sip and continuing sweeter, as milky chocolate. Finishes with a great coffee note. Can't really say too much more about his one. I kid you not, there is a peanutbutter note hidden somewhere in there. I'm a big doppelbock fan, and this is quickly becoming a favorite.

39,131,WaveRebel51,4.38,"Certainly lived up to its lofty expectations. The dark brown color and roasty malt aroma was nice, but the taste was something that I cannot completey describe, yet won't soon forget. Very nice, rich malt flavor, which seemed to change with every sip, with a touch of hop balance at the back end. The glass was empty before I knew it and I can't wait for the next one.  The price and hype made me cautious, which is why I waited a long time to indulge in this -- don't make the same mistake.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Very strong, complex flavor, chocolate, coffee, malt, etc...the flavor doesn't stop. So much going on it disguises the alcohol taste wonderfully, even though it has a high ABV. Wonderful to the last drop. Certainly a new favorite of mine!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Taste...well, a minor hint of coffee, and wonderful sweet, dark malt. The ABV not even noticeable.  Finishes so clean, makes you want more.  Can't really think of a beer I'd rather have. This is what other beers want to be.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,JayQue,4.17,"Pours a clear dark mahogany color. A hard pour produces a big tan head that slowly fades to a light covering of the glass. Minimum head. The nose hints at sweetness and dark fruit, quite pronounced and good. The actual taste delivers the sweetness and fruit, but the predominant flavor is malt. As a hophead, this isn't my favorite style of beer but I was impressed with the ""bigness"" of flavor in a beer that is not a complete high octane / abv bomb. This one gets your attention like a Belgian. Mouthfeel is rich and the flavors are more balanced if you let the beer warm up as you sip it. Drinkability is good...would be very good for someone that appreciates malty beers more.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,bluemoonswoon,4.5,"11.2oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass  A: Pours a dark and I mean dark amber, this one almost looks like a stout. A tightly packed inch and a half tan head bubbles down to a cap and stays around. This one leaves sticky lacing all the way down the glass.  S: They were not kidding about the malts on this one, nice and sweet sugary aromas brown sugar and carmel, nice but not quite as inviting as I would have hopped.  T.MF: Not to much carbonation felt, this one did bubble over when I popped the cap off which I though was a bit strange. Has a very toasty and nutty taste balanced with a good amount of fruity sweetness with a hint of tobacco lingering around in the end, but make no mistake this beer is about malt. Another great thing about this beer is that after a few sips the beer begins to take on richer characteristics, the nutty flavors become more pronoucned and sweet with a nice buttery aftertaste. I don't know what it is but the further I get into drinking this the better the beer becomes.  D: I didn't what this one to end and I got happier with it the further along I got into drinking it, the only qualm I have with this one is that it felt a little flat on the tongue, other than that this one is perfect on the inside.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,yodaseo,4.48,"the head was something that i only dream about. the light brown head dissipated as the sticky lace etched a beautiful pattern on the side of the glass. the smell was of tons of malts that i could smell even through my stuffed nose, with a hint of tart fruitiness and a flash of the alcohol. the taste was exceptional, with sweet malts up front overwhelming the taste buds and a surprisingly dry and tart finish. but the mouthfeel in my mind takes the cake because it literally felt like chewing on malt syrup. the alcohol gradually crept up and warmed my esophagus, but my mouth was just left wanting more. extremely drinkable, the alcohol is very well masked but has just the right amount of presence so you know you're not drinking a light beer. a brew worthy of celebration indeed.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Head rose slowly and doesn't go anywhere until the last inch or so is left. Left a light lacing on the way down.  A lot of sugary sweet smell out of this one with some fresh baked bread on the top and a very distinct but noble hop tinge.  To the mouth the small bubbles make this one velvety and smooth to the palate while still giving it an effervescent quality.  A bit of alcohol on top but with strong notes of caramel and sugar and a nice hop bitter to kick it over the edge...you could probably taste this one over and over and get something new.

A slight chocolate aroma.  T. Toasty bread, chocolate and tofee.  M. Like heaven! Goes down smooth with a rich toffee chocolate after taste.  D.

Somewhat sparse archipelago of lacing sticks just above the head. Aroma has a yeasty belgian character; alcohol has a strong presence. Mouthfeel is medium-creamy and has a light and crisp carbonation tingle. Flavor is woody and grassy with a background of banana-yeast, parmesan, molasses, and a nice spicy (but distant) hop bite. Thick, roasty, almost smoky malts throughout.

39,131,tempest,4.33,"Picked up a bottle at the Party Source in Syracuse.  A gorgeous beer with a bit thick head and lacing. The flavor isn't as rich as I'd like. It tastes of fruity licorice with back current and blueberry cobbler with a dry cocoa aftertaste. The mouthfeel here is fantastic, smooth and creamy with a bitter edge. Really wonderful balancing here. I'd like more flavor, but at the same time, it lacks the overpowering licorice root that other doppelbocks like Spaten's have that I don't care for as much. Definitely the best doppel I've had.  More cowbell (see below).",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

There is a very faint roasted scent, but far removed from the roasted scents you'd find in a stout. Smooth as velvet mouthfeel with very fine carbonation. Almost syrupy malted taste with a slight hint of alcohol. Bitterness and malts meld into one beautiful flavor finishing dry.

Warm malt with a bit of toffee and chocolate.  The flavor is delicious. Malty and carmel from start to finish. There is a tiny bit of bitterness in the finish to take the candy edge off. Very well balanced and tasty. Did I say it tasted good too?  Nice mouthfeel. Nothing to complain about there.  Almost too drinkable. I could see killing a sixer of this and passing out.

That being said:  Appearence: I opened the bottle and foam shot out over the top. Roudh car ride maybe? Poured into a pint glass, it had a large head that I let settle in the fridge. It was dark but when I held it up to the light it appeared to have a reddish hue to it.  Smell: Was great! I love malt and this beer screamed extra malt.  Taste: Good, I found the alcohol to be a little intrusive, maybe overshadowing the malt that I love. I am new to this style, and while I like it, this didn't really impress me, as in I wouldn't pay the $12 bucks for a 4-pack.  Mouthfeel: Was sharp to the tongue but not sure if it was acidic or carbonation.  Drinkability: I wouldn't make this a session beer, but not bad with a light dinner, maybe chicken or a salad. I am guessing that this is a good example of the style but maybe not the best. cheers guys!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

(I was able to raise a frothy tan head on the second glass - but it didn't linger) It gave chocolate, oats, coffee, and malt aromatics and went down silkily smooth.  This beer has a low carbonation and high drinkability. Once in your mouth, earthy and bitter tastes come forward and move into the aftertaste - with a bite of alcohol at the end.  I am new to the Doppelbock style, so I cannot compare it to its kindred. As a stand-alone example, I was very pleased.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,TuckerCarlson,4.27,"My imperial pint glass is Ayinger-branded, so I figure I ought to try their flagship beer. Otherwise I'd be, like, a total poseur.  Very dark, mostly opaque. Shows through a semi-clear ruby (kind of a redder version of cola) when held direct to light. Finger and-a-half of tan head that goes away quickly, leaving a thin layer of foam on top. Not much lacing.  Brown sugary, coffee smell with something funky and maybe slightly herbal underneath  Wow, I was expecting cloying sweetness (the couple of dopplebocks I've had before had that unflattering characteristic), but each mouthful is incredibly complex. I'm totally going to miss some flavors here, but there's sweet toffee right off the bat, transitioning into some even darker coffee flavors, then a touch of that herbal (maybe not herbal; earthy?) stuff as it dries out, and just a little bit of funky sourness at the end. Nice clean finish that sticks with you. Definite coffee and something that reminds me of Ron de Barrilito Tres Estrellas, a high-quality Puerto Rican rum.  Medium to light thickness with moderate to light carbonation. The lighter carbonation is a bonus; I'm sure too much fizz would kill the flavor.  Very drinkable. It goes down easy, but its complexity demands your attention. Definitely worth trying, and a great beer to give to anyone who claims not to like lagers.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,boelker62,4.25,"Poured a creamy, off-white, but mostly-diminishing head atop a beautifully deep, oily hued combination of amber and reddish-brown. The smell is purely, and of pure grains and cereals. Really, a wonderful presentation of the style. Deep color and deep aroma. All this before the first sip, I can't wait. A light hoppy tinge is another enticing factor to this one.  The initial flavor is slightly sweet, with the grains and malts really plotting themselves firmly on your palate. A slightly acidic warmth is present as well.  This is a great shining example of what this style is to be. The mouthfeel is a medium body, and a medium-length finish.  This is the best of any bock or doppelbock I have ever had. It has convinced me to expand myself away from ales more.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

I picked it up because I hadn't had this beer for some time and was amazed to discover I'd never reviewed it.  Poured a super dark brown that took on a very slight ruby hue when held to the light. Decent sized tan head that dropped after a couple of minutes. Modest sheets of lace that slide down the sides of my pintglass quickly.  The nose is of molasses and mildly bitter chocolate. Not a whole lot else going on. Seems a little subdued for a doppelbock.  The sense of something that's a little too sedate for it's own good continues to the taste. The taste is mildly chocolaty, with a little balancing bitterness thrown in, but it's very mellow.  The mouthfeel is a little thin for the style. With a doppelbock I expect a meal in a glass - this ain't it.  Not a bad tasting beer, but nevertheless disappointing. Either this has been dumbed down in the couple of years since I had it or I've learned to expect more. Either way, if there's another doppelbock available, I'll be reaching for it before grabbing this one again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

I poured it into an over-sized Arrogant Bastard glass and realized the glass was just like the Celebrator glass, only huge. It was a serious dark brown, with ruby edges and a frothy tan head. The smell was roasty, toasty, and malty. The taste was toasty and I swear I detected licorice in there. This was a good beer but I think it tastes better on tap.

I tasted flavours of raisons, cherries, grapefruit, dark fruits. It was a little vinous. I also tasted some sweet coffee and chocolate. There was some hop flavour/bittering to inhibit the sweetness from overpowering.  Mouthfeel was full-bodied. Average carbonation.

Good head retention from the frothy pillow atop this glorious brew. Aromas are rich and pleasing with molasses, roasted malty goodness, and a nice shot of hoppiness. Absolutely envelopes the palate in luscious goodness. Huge chewy malt action with the molasses sweetness and a touch of faint alcohol makes this one very balanced brew. Hints of rich cherry and other fruits.  Perhaps as good as it gets with regard to imported Biers. This is the best of the best when it comes to this style.

39,131,Nesued,4.5,"Appearance - A very ornate 330ml bottle with a white plastic goat trinket tied around the neck on a red elastic string. Nice decoration for something bar-related. Poured a dark black color. When held up to a strong light from behind, appeared more of a burgandy color. Poured reasonably cool from about two hours refrigerated. A two-finger head formed that resolved into a thin layer. Glass was rinsed prior to the pour which (I'm sure) hindered the head formation. Thin carbonation.  Smell - Chocolate aroma with a roasted malt presence. Nice warm aroma with a slight sweet bit as well.  Taste - Nice malty taste, plain and simple. The roasted/chocolate presence is felt in each swig. There is a comfortable hoppy bite at the end, but it is well balanced and does not come as a suprise. This is one dense/malt-fest. Had I not known this was a doppel, I would have picked this as an Irish stout!! This is a meal.  Mouthfeel - Wow, this fills your mouth and palate with goodness. Very dense and very heavy (but in a good way). Giving a swish doesn't stimulate an overly carbonated ""bite"", but at the same time creates an even fuller mouth presence.  Drinkability - Dangerously drinkable!! This is one fine doppel. I will very much have this as part of my stable of offerings. I only hope my guests are worth it!!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

T - Bitter but with a milk-chocolate sweetness that complements and even slightly overwhelms the balance but by only the smallest measure. It ends with a lingering whiskey-like complexity and then a clean almost mossy-sweet finish full of damp soil and toffee. (Can you tell this is a favorite of mine...?) M - The beer itself has a rather light body. However, upon taking the first sip, one's mouth is coated with a wave of tiny bubbles. Once they dissipate, the more subtle notes of the flavor emerge. D - As far as doppelbocks go, it's a pretty heavy experience. More Christopher Marlowe's Faust than whatever episode of The Simpsons happens to on, if you know what I mean. Bonus - The fantastic little goat charms you get when you buy Celebrator. It's like the bygone era when Cracker Jacks used to have good toys in them...also, you get drunk, so, all in all, an awesome beer and a great experience.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

As with most of my reviews D-bocks are new to me so can't really compare by style. It was good, but after hearing all the hype maybe I expected more. Nose was malty, bready, not much actually. Taste was balanced leaning on sweet. Very drinkable, did'nt fill to heavy. Reasonably priced, if it were available here I would drink again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,greenbeaner,4.38,"Poured a very deep, dark copper color. Almost black. Forms two and a half fingers of head that quickly dissipates to a thin film on the surface. Very little lacing.  Strong malt up front on the nose, with a quiet chocolate finish. There are also tones of caramel and raisens.  Tastes heavily of lightly roasted malt and chocolate up front with a bit of a sweet raisen finish. Also apparent are hints of coffee and fig. Light carbonation is apparent as well. A very delicious, well balanced brew.  Feels large and full bodied in the mouth, but never syrupy. Goes down smooth and finishes slick. Feels great.  I put this one off for a long time, largely because of it's price-to-alcohol ratio...It proved to a huge mistake, as this is definitely one of the most deliecious beers I've tasted. A must try, often buy, in my book for sure. I'd drink it all the time.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smelt of strong raisins, roasted malt, dark caramel, almost molasses, some coffee black licorice and bananas.  Taste was upfront strong bittersweet raisin, black licorice, and roasted grain followed by a strong bitter yeasty and sweet dark sherry chocolate on a long finish.  Palate was medium bodied, creamy, softly carbonated and moderately astringent and slightly alcoholic.  Overall, this is a soft tasty doppelbock.

A slightly timid malty aroma with some dark fruit and cinnamon. A more pronounced syrup like molasses as it warms slightly.  Full bodied texture that coats the entire mouth. The mouth feel is smooth and creamy with a good amount of carbonation. A reserved bitter hop note beneath.  The flavor is sweet and malty also and it is complemented quite well by the mouth feel. A coffee sensation adds to the latent complexity.  This one is quite drinkable and at 6.7% ABV a person could enjoy a couple of these in a session.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Thick lacing. A very attractive beer.  S-Slightly sweet barley aroma dominates. A little bit of alcohol present as well with hints of unsweetened chocolate which can be distinguished from the sweet barley. Slight vanilla is in there too.  T-Not nearly as sweet as it first smells. There is a nice dry crisp finish. the roasted barley is ever present providing the slightly charred and smokey background notes. The yeast makes itself known midsip, a very German taste.  M-On the heavier side but never too thick. Carbonation is present but not harsh.  D-Perfect for a spring/fall evening.

The aroma was sweet toasted malts, toffee well done.  The taste of this full bodied brew grew to a complex nature. First a blast of toasted roasted malts. Dark fruits like plum. A bread charactor of biscuit and well done toast. The sweetness of molasses,honey and caramel. All rounded out and blended nicely by hops and suttle alcohol.

Chocolate lingers in the aftertaste. Luxurious.  M - Full bodied, but not syrupy. Has a soft creaminess, but their is some carbonation to keep things lively. Alcohol is very well hidden.  D - Goes down easy, and a fantastic brew to boot. I already want more!  Overall - My first tasting of this beer was after I had a local craft Bock that has a bit more hops and a lot more toasty character. When I tried the Celebrator, it seemed like a syrupy mess.

Exceptional taste, with a semi-sweet nut/sugar/bisquit that is initially creamy and borders on cloying with an overpowering coat, but somehow defies it. It finishes nicely, with an almost crisp, dry champagne zest. Complex in its simplicity, well balanced and easy to drink. Recommended.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A thick and creamy looking tan 1 finger head builds on top and diminishes slowly, leaving a nice ring but not a whole lot of lacing on the way down the glass.  Smell is bittersweet dark chocolate, some molasses and caramel malts. Very appealing. Those aromas don't disappoint in the taste, which is a wonderfully sweet and complex combination of malty goodness with a little bit of hops to create a perfectly balanced and incredibly delicious brew.

Taste is amazing; lots of chocolate and caramel malt with a good lager hops kick at the end. Really a tasty beer. Feel is good, good thickness, especially for a lager.

Smell was sweet and alcoholic. I don't know how to describe the taste exactly. It's sweet up front followed by a kick of funkiness that is strange and unfamiliar to me.

Smooth overall taste with little bitterness and great chocolate character.  M: medium-bodied to heavy, goes down smooth with no hint or burning sensation from alcohol, some bitter-sweet feel drifting towards sweet at the finish.  D: not the most drinkable beer.

S: There is a surprisingly strong roasted aroma with a good raisin scent and some chocolate in the background. The strong malt flavor, which I expected to be very bold, was hidden in between the raisin and the chocolate.  T: The malt that was missing in the aroma was very prevalent in the flavor. There is a strong raisin flavor and some caramel notes. Some bitterness is hidden in there but is overwhelmed by the sweetness  M: This is a good medium bodied beer that is incredibly smooth.

Great taste with the chocolate making its presence felt in this dark version of the style, alcohol present once again but faint and actually helps create some balance. Sweet malts also come through.

First whiff is malty as hell, super-sweet with some dark fruit and molasses.  Tastes exactly like it smells and finishes clean. Alcohol is virtually undetectable-- it's only 6.7% ABV and it shows. Packed with simple, rich malty sweetness-- a dessert beer for sure. It's not really all that complex, but Celebrator is pretty much a flawless doppelbock.  Mouthfeel is thin and very lightly carbonated. Pretty much on-par for the style.  Not really all that drinkable, but great for after-dinner sipping.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Slatetank,4.77,"Poured slightly chilled from a plastic goat adorned brown 12oz bottle into an Ayiner Celebrator glass with gold rim. A - Healthy, hefty head hangs on for a while only gradually relaxing leaving a generous amount of lace. A deep brown coffee color similar to mahogany.  S - An extremely pleasant malt with vinous raisin and slightly molasses odor emanates w/ a synergy of roasted malt and brown sugar, fig like scents. Earthy and woody underpinnings follow through.  M - A smooth buttery feel with a masterful blend of carbonation and malt sweetness that surrounds the tongue with exquisite nuance.  T - A beautiful walnut desert flavor gets tangled up in a luscious mix of fig, caramel, toffee, vanilla, subtle dark chocolate and sweet dark malt. The lager yeast really lets the spectrum of nutty, roasty and sweet satiny flavors blend with effortless grace. A majestic harmony is achieved with minimal bitterness and malt that fades into a rippling echo.  D - May be respected in small doses like a truffle with it's rich character and lasting residual sweetness.

I was attracted to the nice little goat charm. This is one amazing looking beer. Very dark ruby appearance with a wonderful dark khaki colored head that remains throughout entire tasting with a medium grainy lace. Smell is of a nutty chocolate with a toasted malt undertone. Very pleasant smell. Taste follows up quite well after the amazing odor. Lots of malt! Very sweet bready flavors, brown sugar, raisin as well. Little to no alcohol bite which I enjoy. Such a smooth enjoyable brew that has a fair amount of carbonation to it, but doesn't distract from its overall balance. This beer left me speechless, I highly recommend this no matter what kind of beer you prefer. I have a new respect for Dopplebocks and look forward to trying more. Thank you Pat from Finger Lakes Beverage!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,becktone,4.03,"Eye: Black in color with ruby highlights, this brew is everything that a doppelbock should look like. The head has good retention, is tan in color and appears to be creamy. As it recedes from the pour it leaves appetizing lacing along the sides of the glass.  Nose: Strong sweet malt aromas right up front. Alcohol presence is noticeable. No hop aroma present. Notes of chocolate come thorough, overall dark character to the aroma.  Tongue: Overall dark complex nicely mixed flavor. Flavor is also very clean. As with the aroma there is a chocolate presence, and a bit of alcohol is noticeable. Finishes with some roasted type and chocolate notes.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Smooth and creamy on the palate. Lower carbonation of this brew accentuates the complex flavors. This brew is real easy to drink, could easily drink this without getting tired of it. The body is a bit thinner than what I would have expected; however, it is still full bodied. Finishes more on the drier side once one has sat without taking another sip for a few moments. A great doppelbock, but for the price of 4 of these I'd probably rather buy Bell's or Spaten's doppelbock....you know more bang for the buck. But I guess If I want to splurge then I'd buy these.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ablaze,4.26,"Pours a very deep ruby red colour with a nice beige head. Looks like a rich beer, that's for sure.  Scent is a very faint rose or potpourri, with a soft undertone of alcohol that takes a few sniffs to notice.  The flavours unravel very well, and every sip is different. Very spicy and fruity at first with lots of strawberries, then blackberries, and then a solid rye bread finish. Very nicely layered with a rich, lingering aftertaste. It's a delicious and sweet beer, like candy.  Feels silky in the mouth, and clingy, like it's coating your mouth before it goes down. Quite pleasing.  Definitely a special beer, and it's well priced. I could drink it in any kind of weather on any day, and it would cheer me right up (but what good beer doesn't?). 6.7% by volume, but very easy to drink, and the alcohol isn't noticable by taste.  Overall, it's very deserving of the praise it has gotten and it is very close to what I expected.

Big tan head, faded after a moderate time revealing a big layer of lace that stayed until the end.  S - Smell was very sweet, and thick. Robust would be a good word. Lots of caramel aromas here, even some hints at cofee, rasin, or perhaps a light chocolate interspersed with a nice smoked aroma.  M & T - The first thing I noticed was a sort of flat, slick taste. I was hoping for some more carbonation and a fuller feel. The first flavor to hit was a nice balanced smoked, roasted malt flavor. Very nice, with a good amount of bittering hoppiness backing it up, almost a hint of a cola flavor as well. Lots of good sublties here, very well rounded.  D - Overall the only negative I have is that it needed more carbonation to give a fuller feel and better set off the flavors. It was very drinkable however, as nothing overwhelmed you and it never came off as too thick. Very nice relaxing nightcap for me.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

It's got a thin bubbly head that's tan-brown and long lasting. Not much lacing. It doesn't smell too strongly - just a bit bitter but mostly a sweet smell. The taste is slightly acidic/bitter up front, but then erupts into a roasty sweet chocolate taste on the end which dominates the aftertaste. Very drinkable and delicious - nice bitterness to balance out the sweet roast. Plus it's got a funky little goat necklace for some reason.

39,131,AustinBeerLvr,4.68,"Poured a 11.2 ounce bottle into a pilsner glass.  A: Huge rocky, creamy, thick head. The body looks very dark and rich. As it's being consumed, it leaves a substantial amount of lacing on the glass.  S: Mostly roasted malt and a good dose of clean hops in there as well.  T: This brew is very complex in that the first couple of sips seemed to have a lot of roasted malt flavor up front. Then, as I took the next few sips, the roasted character of this brew seems to mellow out and the hops really shine through more to balance the malt sweetness. In my opinion, the only thing missing from this brew is that it actually needs just a slight touch more of malt sweetness for all the hop flavor it has.  M: Simply awesome. Perfect for the style, but still doesn't weigh you down.  D: Without a doubt, the most drinkable double bock I've ever had. It's not quite as sweet as most brews of the style, and I just can't get enough the awesome hops that do such a nice job of balancing everything out. Also, this brew has a somewhat lower ABV than most doppelbocks, which makes it an excellent session beer if you feel like having a few.

Head is light brown with impressive creamy thickness and retention. Decent lacing as well.  Nose is lighted roasted/carmelized maltines and brown sugar. No hops noted, but a little of the alcohol strength is.  Taste is as I remember it - the best doppelbock I've had. Fruits not present in the aroma explode into the mouth along with the nice bready flavor. Nice balance of caramel and plum/berry sweetness with a somewhat drying and bittering finish.  Creamy full-bodied smoothness abounds. Carbonation relatively light. Always have to force myself to drink this slowly enough to enjoy it, as I never seem to have enough around.  Very drinkable.

To be fair, I had this brew on tap in the USA (i.e., perhaps not at its freshest), served into a Celebrator 0.3 liter glass.  Appearance was dark-brown with a reddish tinge. A bit more watery than other Doppelbocks I've seen.  Aroma was very good, almost of a chocolate cordial.  Flavor was OK, with notes of port wine and sherry. The aftertaste was almost salty.  Mouthfeel was average at best, with not a lot of body and cloying to the roof of the mouth.  Drinkability was OK for a Doppelbock, but you could definitely taste the alcohol.  Again, to be fair, I had it on tap a long distance from where it was brewed. Perhaps I'll sample it again if I make it back to Bavaria.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,GratefulBeerGuy,4.07,"11.2 oz bottle complete with a little plastic Celebrator ram.  AP: A deep dark brown with ruby red hues shimmering through in direct light. A mild carbonation creates a one-finger thick cream colored head, thin and bubbly, dissipted quickly to a scattered cap.  Nose: Honey malt, honey wheat bread, spicey hop, brown sugar and nutmeg, all very aromatic.  Taste: Semi-sweet malt flavor with dark chocolate, nutmeg, honey wheat bread, roasted oats and wheat with some sour fruit flavors and a nice spicey and zesty hop fin. Not as sweet dominated as the aroma will lead you to believe.  Feel: Medium body, Not as heavy and thick as some other good Dopplebocks, this one features a rather crisp and clean lively effect.  DA: Very east to drink and very enjoyable. At 6.7 % it still remains easy.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,DoubleJ,4.55,"I was shopping for beer at BevMo last week and saw a 330 ml bottle of this on sale for $2.49. Needless to say, I bought it. On to the beer:  It pours thick into a pilsner glass with a dark brown color. It has a very nice aroma of chocolate covered raisins and brown sugar. Similar taste too, and very well balanced. Not overwhelmingly malty, and a pleasure to drink on slowly. Why spend your money on a forty when you can enjoy this for the same price?",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Cute little goat charm around the neck.  Deep amber brown, nearly opaque. Frothy tan head, well-tamed, but sticks around nicely throughout. Aroma definitely not an ale - has metallic hints of noble hops, but not in a bad way. Taste is spectacular - sweetish maltiness predominates, with a nice drying bitterness on the finish, even a hint of a porter-like powder. Beautifully light texture, smooth, just enough weight to hang in there and invite the next sip.  A great beer, even if you think the style's not for you. Wow.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

It has a subtle fruity aroma that cleverly caused you to underestimate it's wonderfully complex flavor. Malty and nice fruit.  It posseses a buttery complex flavour with a light-hoppiness and toasty, bread-like undertones. It finishes as well as it starts and will keep you coming back for more; one of my favorites. A must-try beer experience. Smooth and falvorful.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Rich carmel-malt flavor, slight hop bitterness in the background. Not as sweet as the aroma suggested. Lingering malt coating on the tongue with a bitter follow through in the back. Carbonation tickles the nose. The sweetness might be too much for glass after glass but a couple is a great idea. I think this is one of the world's best beers.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Takes several minutes for the head to die down making for an impressive presentation (not counting the silly, but fun, plastic goat tied around the bottleneck).  Dark, sugary notes fill the nose with hints of blackberries, black cherry and maple all checking in.  Holy malt, that's good! Rich and lusty flavors pack this brew ranging from the savory (grape tannins and fennel seed) to sweet (brown sugar, sour cherries, vanilla). Burnt, bitter aftertaste makes for a beer that provides a whole range of flavor contrasts. Really good stuff.  Thinner than I would like from such a full-tasting beer but still creamy enough on the finish to make for a more than satisfying drink. Not something I could pack a ton away of but a great, great German beer; a real treat.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

I had this in Frankenmuth a few years back and realized that this was something special, beyond even Bells and New Holland.  Poured into a weizen glass. Huge 3 finger head after an aggressive pour that goes no where for a while then leaves plenty of lacing everywhere. Color is a dark reddish brown, almost like iced tea. Smell is totally roasted malt with a little touch of caramel sweetness and maybe a little fruitiness as well. Taste is sweet and roasty up front a little milk chocolate and coffee bitterness in the back - this is a wonderful beer. Mouthfeel is perfect - not too carbonated, but enough to carry the complexity. This is the perfect beer to have with any German food - brats, sauerkraut, spaetzle, etc. Drink it often, it's good stuff. Highest recommendation.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,eberkman,4.38,"Poured an opaque dark brown that when held up to the light displayed brilliant shards of red through the glass. An aggressive pour produced a big, billowing tan head.  The smell while not strong was a pleasing sweet maltiness.  The taste was initially sweet, roasty malts that gave way to a wonderful lingering dry bitterness that invited another sip. Also the warming sensation of alcohol was subtly present as a backdrop.  Mouthfeel is full-bodied, creamy and smooth -- almost velvety. Exceptionally gulpable, but the alcohol level is deceptive.  A great, great beer -- the mother of all doppelbocks and a real treat to pick one up.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

It was a deep brownish/red color with a frothy tan head that didn't last too long but as I drank it left a fine looking lacing all the way through. perfect!  It smelled sort of sweet and of roasted malt. perfect!  The taste was heavenly, not too sweet with no hint of alcohol or bitterness. perfect!  It was creamy and smooth in the mouth with a sweet aftertaste. perfect!  This is an extremely drinkable bock.

One finger light kaki head with decent retention and lacing. The body is a deep dark brown with nice ruby highlights and good gradation. Smells is rich, yet very subtle and light at the same time. I get light scents of dark coco and coffee, toasted malts, nice roasted nuttiness, maybe even a slight salty note. Taste is flavorful, nice complexity very similar to the smell, slightly more earthy, there is a mild syrupy character to this, which I like. The bitterness is perfect keeps it refreshing and interesting and balances malty goodness perfectly. The mouth feel is great, because it is lighter, but it has flavor attributes of a stout. Its refreshing and hearty, not cloying or over bearing on the palate, magnificent. This has great potential to be both a winter drink and a summer drink, very quenching. Its really good maybe too good I could drink these from sun up to sun down.

A 1+ finger tan head formed on thepour that ended up fading to a cap of frothiness. The body looks great. Leaves patchy lacing that slowly slides back into the body.  Smell are deep of lightly roasted malts and fresh baked bread. There's a brown sugar sweetness that comes through as well. A slight boozy quality reminds me of rum soaked raisins.  Flavor is much the same as the aroma. Starts with a solid dose of lightly roasted malts. Sweet banana bread hits mid-palate, seems doughy. Finishes with a touch of sweetness, mild nuttiness, the roasted grains, banana bread and mild alcohol fumes. Very nice.  Body has a somewhat chewy texture and nice medium, smooth body. Again, mild alcohol fumes show up occasionally.  Good cool weather hearty brew. Easy drinker and very enjoyable.  Celebrator is a truly well made doppelbock that deserves the praise it gets.

Still life in a glass. Smell is all malt all sorghum and molassas. Some notes of burnt sugar. Intriquing. Maybe my palatte has changed as this smells better than I recalled.  Taste is heavy with the sorghum. Sweet in a totally different way than the sweetness of a JW Lee or a Duchesse. It is not a cloying sweetness. There is a smokey or burnt sugar undertone which applies a sort of bitterness. It's all a bit much for me. The taste is certainly not ""average,"" but I would be hard pressed to call it ""good.""  While it is heavy tasting stuff, it is surprisingly thin in the mouthfeel. No carbonation to speak of. To me, this is usually a good thing, but in this case, it feels somewhat watery to be honest.

I like the fact that a little plastic statue of Lord Satan comes tied to each bottle with a piece of red string.  Poured out, the beer has a rocky head that collapses to a finger's thickness, over and almost-opaque deepamber/black brew. The carbonation seems pretty sedate, and the nose is molasses and dark fruit. It has a rich coffee and malt flavor with a dry finish having a touch of unsweetened chocolate bitterness.

Slight hint of molasses hits the palate on the first sip before it is taken over by a mix of dark, bitter - a good bitter - chocolate taste with a little mocha thrown in for good measure. Almost looks like a cup of coffee with this Guinness mug I'm drinking it from. Delicious taste hides the alcohol very well. Don't think I'd have more than 1-2 at a time however, like I would an ale or something lighter.  A great brew that I will be going back to over and over.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,EPseja,4.97,"I can't believe that this is the first time I'm ever having this beer.  Served from a 330ml. bottle with a neat plastic goat charm tied to the neck, at cellar temperature in my Samuel Adams Double bock glass.  A - Medium chestnut in color, pouring with some noticeable viscosity. The head just screams to come forth as it battles against the liquid still falling from the bottle. Once I pull back, the creamy sand-colored takes off for the rim of the glass, superceding it by just a little, then slowly settling and becoming more dense. The amazing, microbubbled head finally drops to a creamy island in the center, along with a thick ring around the glass edge - but after a full 6 minutes or so! Lacing is unfortunately spotty and provides the only (very slight) letdown in light of the amazing head.  S - Rich, warm hearth-baked dark molasses bread. Is there such a thing? Mmm... there should be. Nice, rich well roasted malts. The light sprinkling of hops that is (barely) noticeable adds a clean freshness that also plays off of the very subtle alcohol. Yummy.  T - ""Damn."" That was precisely the first word out of my mouth after completing one sip and swallow. Starts off with a candy-sweet maltiness that is quickly overtaken by a slightly yeasty-tart toastiness in the middle. I almost get a nuance of smoke in here as well... As it hits the back of the tongue, the subtle hops lend their bitterness to a drying finish. Once down, the aftertaste is bready, sweet and slightly dry. Fantastically delicious.  M - Definitely qualifies as one of the the top 5 best mouthfeels I've ever had in a beer. Soft like velvet on the way in. Creamy and fulfilling in the mouth, turning into seafoam as it moves around. The swallow is gradual, like liquid taking its time down a very slight grade. An absolute pleasure.  D - Well, all my friend Yelterdow's championing of this beer was definitely in the right place. This is an amazing Dopplebock. 'Nuff said. Less typing. More sipping. This beer is the real deal.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The head on my beer fell down much quicker than I expected and I was left with only a thin chunk of bubbles on top of the mahogany brown body.  The smell is sweet but a bit spicy. Alcohol probably contributes a bit to the spicyness.  The taste is where this shines. Smoothness galore. It starts out sweet and malty, then transitions into a bit of bitterness that tickles the tongue, then a sweet but clean aftertaste. SUper smooth and not a bit of alcohol is perceptable.

Each sip of this medium bodied beer is soft on the palate with a dry finish. I will say that it did feel a little bit thin to me, but not too much. There's definitely a lot of flavor in this brew. Mainly roasted malt with a fair amount of smoke mixed in. However, there are also notes of nuts, raisins and molasses. It finishes mildly sour leaving behind a molasses flavor.

This is the first time trying celebrator, after waiting literally months for it to be restocked after a rapid sellout at Sherbrooke. Thanks, VUE magazine!  A: Celebrator looks a lot like cola to me. Upon pouring it, the carbonation looks and sounds just like pouring a glass of cola. Color is almost exactly that of Dr. Pepper, only a little bit more brown. The head comes up with finer bubbles than said soft drink, but degrades evenly over a minute and a half into a light tan ring. I noticed that the outside ring of head was slightly darker than the stuff in the middle. This might be an anomaly... i'll have to drink a couple more to verify :)  S: The first thing I said when smelling this beer for the first time was ""wow, maltacular!"" It positively reeks of malt, in a good way. Behind that is a little vinuous note, and some smoke.  T: malty, then smoky, than hoppy, in that order: sort of like the smell. I thought this would be really similar to Löwenbräu Triumphator, but it has a much stronger hop character, where I found triumphator more biscuity and sweet. I'm not a beer god by any stretch of the imagination, but this stuff feels really balanced.  M/D: feels really smooth, not too heavy in the mouth or the stomach. I could drink this over an extended period of time.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,jhollick,4.69,"Pours a rusty brown color with a nice, persistant creamy tan head. The beer becomes much lighter when held up to light, and reveals its transparency. Smell is of sweet cocoa, oatmeal, molasses, dark berries, and a hint of hops. The mouth is thick and creamy. Beautiful beer to swirl around the palette.  Taste is surprisingly hoppy, but in a good way. The hop and malt balance is absolutely brilliant, allowing the chocolate and molasses to come out after a short while. A smoky flavor is also present throughout, and coffee flavor provides some additional bite at the end. I think I am detecting some citrusy flavors and smells as well. The flavor finishes slightly dry with a slight warming effect from the alcohol.  This beer really has it all; the taste is complex but understated, the smell is amazing, the mouthfeel is spot on for a bock, and you could drink it for hours if you wanted to. Oh why must you be so pricey? Oh, and please let this warm up a bit before enjoying. You won't be disappointed. The much celebrated Celebrator does not disappoint.

The color was almost black, but when held to the light let some dark reddish hues through.  The head held on through my sniff test which reveiled hints of coffee, chocolate and a sweet fruity-ness.  Upon my first taste, the head had diminished to about 1/4"" and was already leaving a pronounced lacing on the glass. The taste (like the smell) had coffee, chocolate and fruit characteristics, although they weren't as pronounced as I'd hoped. This one was a bit thinner that many of the other dopplebocks I've tried (most recently Spaten Optimator). Very little on the hoppiness factor. Spaten Optimator is a much richer brew in this Beer Advocate's opinion.  Mouthfeel was OK. A bit too heavy on the carbonation for me. Still smooth enough to fully enjoy.

Smell of rich molasses and caramel, sticky sweet with some hints of earthy hops. Taste of sweet vanilla, caramel and cashew. Some richness of yeasts seem present as well. Some dryness halts the sweetness from becoming overpowering. Finish leaves a bit of peaty aftertaste. Not really my type of beer, but it is good.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,kkipple,4.34,"Each bottle of this beer comes with a white plastic mountain goat (complete with unstoppable head-butting action!) stamped with the label Celebrator. A piece of red twine hooks through the goats head and attaches it to the bottle neck. This is incredibly cool and earns my immediate respect.  I pour out a yin-yang combo of blackest black blackety black black beer with a tightly packed, hefty tan head that marks an immediate division between the foam and the beer. Ok, I lied, the beer isnt really black, hold it to the light and you can see its a very deep red. But black is close.  Even after letting this one warm, the smell is minimal. Sweet roasted grain, brown sugar, ripe figs or raisins, and medicinal alcohol is about all I get.  Mmmm creamy, malt goodness slides down my gullet on the first sip. Its too sweet and rich for a stout or porter, but still leaves a wonderfully appetizing bittersweet charred malt aftertaste. Red grapes, a hint of prunes, and an odd coolness (mint?!) fill my mouth. Celebrator is remarkably smooth and, for the taste, thin. I get fleeting flavors of coffee and cocoa. Hops are subdued, but Im loving it.  The mouthfeel is superb, its not heavy or cloyingly sweet like some Doppelbocks are wont to be, and thus keeps you coming back for more. The beer is ultra-smooth and creamy. The finish is roasty and bizarrely cool. Why? I havent the slightest idea, but Im not complaining. After drinking most of this, not only am I happy but my breath smells like chocolate and coffee.  Perhaps the most well-balanced Dopplebock Ive had to date, Celebrator butts heads with the best of them. Its pricey, but worth it. If you buy it and dislike it, at the end of the day youre still ahead by a few small plastic goats. How many other beers can boast that?",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

I decided, however, that I wouldn't review it until I had a more practiced palate and I'm glad I waited. This is one damn good beer.  It poured a ruby-hued brown into my flute with a creamy tan head that dwindled to a foamy ring. This is one of those beers you can smell from a few feet away, radiating roasted malt, brown sugar, dried fruit and a slightly vinous aroma.  The taste was equally complex, starting with smoky malt that yielded nicely to some fruity plum flavours and sweet brown sugar. The roasty malt returned for a dry finish but I was impressed with the way all the flavours complemented each other without any one of them becoming too dominant or cloying.  The carbonation and medium body were perfect, making for a smooth-drinking experience. The alcohol is well-hidden, but provides a bit of warmth, which made this an ideal indulgence as I relaxed over the Christmas holidays.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Abita45,4.32,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass with a thin head and slight lacing and a deeply dark ruby/amber color. Nicely fragrant aroma of roasted fruit, like raisons, and sweet malt.  The aroma mirrors the taste of roasted raisons, brown sugar, and a dry, roasted malt that levels out the taste and makes it consistent throughout. There's an undercurrent of spiciness that plays right along with the fruit and sweet malt flavors. It is a thick beer that falls short of being creamy by virtue of the roasted malt flavor, I think. It has a nice consistency and is very good all the way around.  Drinking this beer makes you aware of its fragrance, color, and consistency. You can't help but be aware of it all as you drink it.

Tastes is mostly up front sweet malts, a bit of chocolate. Great deep toasty flavor with a bit of an alchohol finish.  Man this beer is good and comforting. Medium body and carbonation, and pretty darn drinkable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,mithrascruor,4.43,"12 oz. bottle poured into a mug.  Appearance: Pours a very dark yet clear deep ruby color. The head is extremely thick and creamy, dark tan, and lasts for a long time. Very impressive.  Smell: Very warm aroma of molasses, roasted malts, and some spices and hops. A bit sweet, but enjoyable and well-balanced.  Taste: Sweet roasted malts slowly accompanied by molasses and spices (ginger, etc.). Very complex, but not overdone.  Mouthfeel: Thick and quite creamy -- very smooth as well.  Drinkability: Very drinkable; goes down well and I can't really notice the alcohol. Sweetness, though, can be sometimes difficult.  A very nice doppelbock that I find to be enjoyable. However, it is a bit sweeter than I typically prefer this type of beer. Still, it's definitely something to try!!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,mpyle,3.64,"Deep ruby red color, crystal clear appearance. Reasonably large tan head, long lasting and tightly bubbled.  Candy sweet aroma, with a bit of black licorice (sp?) and plum. Clean aroma beyond the malt and fruity esters.  A burst of roasty malt flavor up front, but not overly sweet. Somewhat less malty than the aroma hinted at, and balanced by hop bitterness and/or darker malts. Finishes slightly dry and more bitter than a lingering malty sweetness.  Medium body and carbonation. Very creamy, and only slight hints of alcohol warming. Finishes fairly dry, and is absolutely clean on the palate (no astringency).  Overall a very clean, malty lager with surprising balance. Rich without being cloying, but I might actually want it slightly shifted in the malty direction. But that is a minor quibble, as it is a really nice, highly drinkable beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,cjgator3,3.87,"Pours a dark brown mahogany color with a tan head. The aroma is loaded with toasted malt, dark fruits (prunes, raisins) and just a tad bit of caramel. The taste features toasted malt with kind of a nutty chocolatey finish. The taste is a little thinner than I would have liked but it is certainly not bad. Mouthfeel much like the taste is a little thinner than I would have liked but does not detract from the beer that much. Overall, this is a fine representation of the style and a beer that is certainly recommended.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,kernalklink,4.25,This brew poured a dark amber with a huge tan head and sticky lacing. Aromas of dark malts and dried fruits were present and came through on tasting. The malts were huge and sweet yet cool and refreshing. A great balance- the thickness of the beer was offset by its effect on the palate. A perfect meal in a bottle.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,trevorwideman,4.1,"11.2oz bottle poured into a mug, courtesy of demcorhip. Thanks man!  Pours dark, thick and nearly opaque with some ruby highlights when held to the light. An almost full inch of head dissipates to a healthy lacing that sticks around. Mellow carbonation from what I can see. Smell is typically doppelbock, Dark fruits, plum, raisins, currants, chocolate and caramel malts, and a little alcohol to push it to the pleasure centre of the brain....  Taste is very nicely balanced. The chocolate toasted malts come on first, but they aren't overbearingly sweet, and are offset nicely by a mild lemonlike sourness. Less fruity than the nose suggests, but that said, there is some plumlike sweetness in the back. Earthy hops are present and subtle. Just enough to help balance this out. Finishes dry with lots of chocolate in the aftertaste. Thick and malty and perhaps a little syrupy, but I don't mind that. Carbonation is mild and befits the style. Drinkability is high for a few reasons: Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness/sourness. Sweet but never too sweet. Alcohol content isn't out-of-control, slides down very easily. Well done, and probably the best Doppelbock I've had yet.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ZimZamZoom,4.7,"Popped a 12oz bottle and let it sit a moment. After about 2 minutes I had a touch of foam coming out of the neck. Poured into a tulip glass.  A nice deep brown with just a bit of ruby showing through when held up to light. Got a good foamy tan head that leaves a nice lacing.  Smells of dark roasted malts, prunes, nuts, and alcohol. Quite lovely indeed. I would say if heaven came out of a bottle it would be put in there in Germany.  Taste is fruity and nutty, a rich plum/prune flavor with a slightly bitter alcohol finish. This is really thick and complex. I will savor every taste of this one.  Nice, warming, fill-you-up kind of beer. I can see why the monks brewed this to get through their Lenten fast.  Highly recommend this one. It's my first authentic sampling of the style and I'm intrigued to say the least.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,builder53,4.6,"Pours a dark reddish brown with nice adequate tan head and good lacing. Beer is a little colder than it should be , but I was ready so scents at first are somewhat muted. Mouth feel is silky and finish is smooth and dry without any negative after taste. Beer is coming up in temp and so are scents of mild caramel/brown sugar/yeast. Alchohol content undistinguishable, that could be misleading!! Hard to believe that this beer starts incredibly smooth and finishes smoother! Re-afirms for me why Belgian Dubbles are my listed favorite.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,shivtim,3.98,"Have had this a few times, just never reviewed it until now. Love the bottle. Classic. Appearance is nice, deep brown with red hints. decent tan head. Nose is smoky malts and grains, nuts, and some sweetness. Taste is strong smoky malts, bready goodness, and plums. nice. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is high. A solid brew!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,demcorhip,4.3,"Appearance Poured very dark, similar to a cola, a clear blackness with ruby hues throughout the body when backlight. Nice two finger head formed on the pour. Scant lacing collared this lightly carbonated brew.  Aroma Interesting aroma, quite like a date loaf, dark fruit, nuts, some treacle, breadiness, as well as more bitter notes of roasted malts. Some earthy and spicy hops rounded out the nose.  Taste Quite similar to the nose. A liquid date bread, fired in a stone oven, with some roasted and smokey character and a touch of sweetness. Very tasty, and the malts are nicely complimented by the earthy hop spice.  Mouthfeel A smooth, very well balanced and crafted medium bodied lager with light carbonation. The rich, slightly sweet, nutty and fruity malts are nicely complimented by their own touch of smokey roasty bitterness as well as the hop spice.  Drinkability Very drinkable for a rich treat. Not over the top like some other dopplebocks (think sam adams). Also very sessionable for such a deep, rich, and tasty treat. A great example of the style, and also a great way to introduce someone who likes date bread to darker beers. This is something ill come back to again and again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,GeneralZod,2.95,"APPEARANCE It looks like a bock, dark. Very inviiting. Ok head retention.  SMELL Smells chocolately. Very good.  TASTE It's ok. Good for a bock.

39,131,aforbes10,4.1,"A very dark pour. tan head grows big and foamy in the glass. looks nice. Smells of toffee, molasses, caramel and alcohol. Maybe some sugary dark fruits too. Taste is very, very smooth. Roasty, slightly chocolatey, hazlenuts. Lots of roasted smoke flavors, more than i expect from a dopplebock. very tasty though. I do like it, and i am impressed.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,CharlieMopps,4.3,"A: Poured a rich brown color with two fingers of thick, foamy head. Great retention and lacing to this beer.  S: An almost milky and caramel-like smell with a deep toasted malt profile.  T: Relaxed toasted malt flavor, some hop backbone, thick caramel and currant or some mellow fruit taste. Also had bread and chocolate characteristics, making it a damn delicious offering.  M: Creamy mouthfeel and a nice level of carbonation. Very smooth on the palate with a balanced feel to it.  D: Absolutely great. Drinking several of these would be a delight, as the tastes are complex yet smooth enough to savor over and over again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,afordney,4.42,"Thick, tan head. It was almost coke black, slightly reddish and bubbly. It left a really thick, tight lacing around the glass as I drank it.  The first smell was brown sugar, a malty sweetness with a little caramel following.  Tastes just as sweet, a little alcohol burn and then some roasted malt flavor, just fantastic.  balanced, sweet and bitter, good carbonation leaves a bubbly feeling on the tounge.  Just a great tasting beer, warms you up on those cold winter nights and seems excellent with desserts because of its sweetness.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,tjthresh,3.44,"12 ounce bottle. Poured a beautiful mahogany with a creamy light brown head that clings well to the sides of the glass. Aroma is not at bold as I expected and thats a let down for me. Prunes and chocolate chew are the major player. Flavors of smoke, chocolate, prune juice. abound. Full body.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,CAMRAhardliner,4.68,"I recall it being at the top of the BA top 100 list several years ago, ever since joining BA Ive been wanting to try it.  It pours near black with deep ruby highlights. I giant super creamy head is formed on the pour. It lasts a very long time and coats the glass with patches and webs of lace. The aroma is lively and complex with chocolate, overripe prunes and figs, caramel, winter spices (nutmeg?) and a subtle alcohol spice.  The taste is aromatically malty, with an airy, fresh character. Layers and layers of fruity, doughy malt abound. Some roasty, coffeeish flavors and dark chocolate ensures this is never cloying. Alcohol is very well hidden, as are the hops. Just a ghost of hellertau flavor is perceptable. The finish is sweet and somewhat grainy. The mouthfeel is thick and incredibly smooth with subtle tiny carbonation bubbles.  Ultra complex and tastey, a full on tribute to the glory of malts.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,adammills,3,"A brown amber in body, off white rocky head, a bit frothy. Smells of bread and malt. At first it is all malt, but not overpoweringly sweet and then the disapointing part, it turined like a citrus sour. I hope it was just the bottle that I poured from and not representative fo the beer, because I got a real grapefruit bitterness in the end that I cannot believe is desired. May try again due to reputation. But this was not good.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,warmstorage,3,"11.2 ounce bottle from BevMo Sacramento (Arden Way), poured into wide-mouthed wine glass, cold cellar temp. Silly plastic horse tschotke hanging on the neck (silly since it's a waste of resources, and I'll throw it away.)  Pours with a medium dense brown head that mostly goes away.  Aroma is chocolate and roast and metal.  Taste is fruity, thick, chocolate, roast, plum, (fig?), with distinct smokiness. Not as much metallic taste as the nose would have suggested, but still unpleasantly there.  Finishes warm with alcohol and tingly mouth.  Overall, a good DB, and a good beer, but I don't really see what all the fuss is about. Really, a pretty average beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,gpcollen1,4.5,"Pours a wonderful deep dark chocolate with a 1/8 head that is here to stay. An abundance of dark roasty aroma dancing out of my Ommegang Chalice.  Taste is akind to the aroma  dark roasted malt, coffee and chocolate  more as it warms. The mild carbonation really lends to the overall enjoyment of the flavors in this one. I can drink one of these every day  maybe two  who knows.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,AaronHomoya,4.32,"This was actually one of the first non-lager-or-pale-ale beers I had, and I didn't like it. Too strong, bitter and dark. I felt it was time I revisited it after having developed my palate the last couple of years.  Pours a very dark brown color that almost black. Decent-sized, off-white head.  Smell is bready, sweet malt, alcohol and a touch of hops.  Taste is malty, toasty, with a bit of alcohol in the finish. Dark fruits and maybe a touch of those hops show up in the flavor as well. Complex.  Medium mouthfeel.  Certainly a great beer I'm glad I finally revisited.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,lpayette,4.68,"Very nicely presented 11.2oz bottle with the ornament around the neck.  Appearance- Quite dark with hues of red and brown. It gurgles out of the bottle producing a big frothy, nearly tan head that leaves a good amount of lacing.  Smell- Very aromatic. Chocolate covered raisins, a bit fruity, slight amount of alcohol is percievable.  Taste- Chocolate (the sweet kind), raisins, something marshmallow-like, and just a bit fruity. A warming alcohol finish with a coffee twist to end it. Hints of nuts somewhere in there as well.  Mouthfeel- Umm... pretty much perfect. Thick, creamy, smooth. Modest carbonation fits well.  Drinkability + conclusion- A deliciously complex brew that while filling, I would be able to session just out of pure enjoyment. I should have broken down and bought this sooner. This has got to be in my top 5 favorite beers.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,tcfishler,4.25,"Deep brown with a hint of garnet. Bubbles in head and lacing are particularly fine.  Sweet caramelly malt on the nose.  Slightly less sweet in the mouth, with piney hops and a little bitterness to balance the malt. Lively and mouthfilling at the same time, with a smooth, sweet finish.  Delicious and drinkable doppelbock, but I wonder if it's worth the premium price.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,CWiggins,4.47,"I chose this from a menu to accompany a roast beef and gruyere sandwich at a local restaurant. I'm not sure if it was the most prudent choice, but I enjoyed it regardless!  It poured a very dark brown into a pint glass. The head was might at first, but it quickly faded into a lean film that mostly clung to the point of surface tension around the perimeter of the liquid. I find the aroma to be very delightful; it's mostly of dark, dried fruit and coffee/toffee overtones, although toasted malts aren't far behind.  The flavor is delectable. It's so complex: there are hints of dark fruits, espresso, and bittersweet chocolate, with lots of the aforementioned toasted malts and a brown-sugar sweetness that delightfully permeates the entire structure. It's near perfect.  As for the mouthfeel, it's certainly difficult to imagine a nicer texture. It's full and rich without becoming sticky, and the carbonation is just right for my taste: very little. The aftertaste lingers incessantly, and I seem to be able to recall it several minutes later.  This reminds me why I appreciate the Doppelbock style so very much. Highly, highly recommended!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,msubulldog25,4.47,"Poured from a 33cl bottle. I've had this beer on several occasions; this time my wife & I split one with dinner.  A: Seems to be the darkest shade of brown, almost black, until held to a light...then it glows with garnet highlights and is surprisingly clear. Capped with acreamy 1 finger flax-colored head, which recedes very slowly. Little carbonation.  S: Smoky malt and sweet citrus fruit burst from the glass. Confectioner's sugar. Toasted nuts. Mulled spices. Slight alcohol burn. All very nice.  T: Mmm...delicious sticky sweet malts; caramel, coffee, and bittersweet chocolate comingle. Finish is slightly sweet, slightly bittered with floral/herbal hops.  M: Wonderful full mouthfeel, thick and syrupy. A little carbonation prickle. Warm and spicy/dry finish with the lingering mild bitterness of fine chocolate.  D: A big favorite. Well balanced with a skew toward the sweeter malts. Satisfying beer in every way - highly recommended.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,PeatReek,4.49,"In the dark bar atmosphere, Celebrator appeared to be a deep brown with a pale/beige head, slightly more than a lid and quite persistent. The aroma is cool and sweet, with rich, deep berry overtones. The most noticeable aspect upon sipping is the savory, substantial body, just short of being too thick. All the sweet berry notes come through in the taste as well, with just a slight rumble of chocolate malt or roast barley late in each sip. The overall impression is one of excellent balance - Celebrator is sweet without being cloying, substantial without being thick, malty without being grainy. I could tell this beer was a bit above average alcohol-wise, but it's imminently drinkable and I would love to have had several more.

Taste is a pleasant variety of roasted malt flavors, coffee, caramel, and chocolate. This brew is somewhat thick on the palate, yet it washes away for a clean finish...very nice! I wouldn't advise putting down more then 2 or 3 of these in a sitting though, as this one will get to you. Full-bodied, rich, and complex. Awesome beer!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The lacing is not much to speak of, but the retention is very impressive. The beer is a murky dark brown until backlit, when it becomes a crystal-clear deep ruby. The nose is very malty sweet, with a bit of dark fruity vinousness, caramel, toasted malts, and earthy hops (just a tad). The taste is lightly smoky, with deep caramel and toffee notes. A tiny bit sour, too. The mouth is medium-thick, with very low carbonation. A worthy DB.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smell- sweet and malty. hints of chocolate and coffee.  Taste- malt is the story here with a hint of coffee/caramel flavor. really hits the back of the tongue.  Mouthfeel- medium body, light carbonation.  Drinkability- this beer is not overwhelming which leads to easy drinking, i have not had many double bocks in the past but i did enjoy this one very much and would be open to trying more in the future. the price tag will probably stop me from getting this often but it was definitely worth the try. plus it came with a cool ram ornament. go germany.  cheers.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,beerogre,4.13,"I first encountered this beer when I lived in Texas a couple of years ago. I was having a birthday party and my brother-in-law invited some of his friends around with the remit: ""He likes dark beer"".  They had picked this up at the Central Market in Dallas, along with another beer, which was obviously not as impressive since I don't remember it.  Wow, if only all the birthday presents I'd received over the years were of similar quality to this one. My brother-in-law was only partially correct: I did like dark beer, but not only dark beer. I liked good beer. It just so happens that a lot of good beers are also, coincidentally dark.  Personally, I think that no matter which system you might devise to judge the worth of a beer, Celebrator would come out favourably. It's just one of those beers, you taste and say: ""Yea. That's class."" I said it two years ago and I said exactly the same thing again on renewing my acquaintance with the beer tonight.  If you like dark, great looking beer with a caramelly taste and a slightly above average abv, seek out some Celebrator.  Currently, this is ranked only third best within its style. I'd like to meet Two and One.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,JoeyHotrod,4.5,"Truly one of the world's great beers and worthy of any and all praise it recieves, Ayinger Celebrator Dopplebock is grand in it's scope and a true pleasure to savor.  I remember this beer at one time being number one on the best of BA list, I was mearly a lurker for the most part way back then and while the beer has dropped to 21st (still quite remarkable considering the amount of beers out there) it's a classic in every way.  It's a dark brown, nearly black color with a rather nice head that lingers for sometime. There is some nice impressive lacing as well, lacing that lasts the duration of the glass.  The smell is that of smoky malt, with definite coffee undertones as well. Simply delightful!  The beer tastes of malt...malt..malt. Smoky malt, chocolate malt.... simply malt. This is truly a divine beer for malt lovers. This beer is akin to drinking a very very well made coffee in a sense.  This beer is truly world class and mere words cannot do it justice. If you've yet to try it, then please do yourself a favor and do so ASAP.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Alcohol is noticeable but faint. Medium-full bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. This one is pretty good, but the high ABV prevents it from being a session beer.

More subtle notes of toffee, nuts, and brown sugar/nutmeg with a very light fruity hops presence in the background.  Spicy and sweet. The complex malt character is dominant; mostly toffee and caramel, but the hops stand out a lot more than they did in the aroma as well. Alcohol presence is also fairly strong for a 6.7% but in now way overpowering.

Anyhow it poured out a dark brown almost black color. Nice tan off-white head. Very impressive looking presentation. The nice thick head dissipated slowly and left very little lacing in the pint. Smells of roasted malt and caramel tones. Had a rather interesting alcohol aroma almost like a scotch ale. Very smooth roasted flavor awesome malt character. Mild hop presence in the finish. Extremely enjoyable smooth malted flavor. Great mix of dark and roasted malt. The solid malt flavor is the back bone of this great thick bodied beer. Very impressive and tasty, drinkable but in moderation. It certainly packed a nice little kick with it so it seemed. Great overall flavor and taste. I would certainly give it another taste. I was weary trying it because there was no freshness date and I did not know how long my friend had it.

Smell was very nutty, with notes of chocolate and nutmeg in the mix. Taste was overwhelmingly filled with nut and chocolate flavors...a bit of caramel in there too. A lot lighter then i had expected, pretty medium in the end. Very nice as far as drinkability, one more would have been great. This is a really awesome beer...still deciding whether I like it better on tap or from the bottle. Also, seems more ale-like then lagerish.

39,131,Washburne,4.53,"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle to a pilsener glass.  Appearance - Almost completely opaque, but shows a very deep red colour on holding up to the light. I poured a little too slowly, so didn't gain much of a head, but what there was was a medium brown that remained until about halfway through the glass. I imagine with better pouring, the head may have lasted better or at least left the lacing that others have described.  Nose - A mix of fruit, malt and slightly burned caramel. Much more appetizing than it sounds!  Taste - Bitter, rich and smoky. The same caramel and a lot of licorice. Alcohol taste is present but certainly not overpowering.  Mouthfeel - Nice carbonation, surprisingly light for a double bock, although with the richness of the flavour I don't think I'd want it to be much heavier.  Drinkability - Reasonably strong, but very smooth. I think of it more of a sipper than something I can gulp down; I could certainly go for another one after the first, but the richness of the flavour means it wouldn't be a session beer.  Definitely has the 'Outstanding' tag for a reason. Highly recommended!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,dblinkhorn,4.6,"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a flute glass.  Appearance - Has a two-finger tan head that is creamy and fluffy. It settles at a cap of very creamy head that leaves good lacing as it goes down. The beer is an extremely dark ruby amber color that is mostly clear, with only slight haze (you have to hold this beer up to strong light to see through it).  Smell - Has a ""dusty wood"" aroma right up front. The smell reminds me of an old dusty attic. Some ripe fig behind that as a fruit aroma. Slightly sweet caramel notes behind this. Rich bready and toasted malt smell is the faintest behind all of the aforementioned. Very little alcohol smell.  Taste - Grainy bitter and oily hops up front. Same fig flavor, but less rich than it was on the nose. The malts are rich and toasted with some smoky attributes. Buttery caramel and brown sugar add a slight sweetness flavor to it all. Pepper as a spice is definitely present. A more fruity and rich finish turns to an earthy and toasted malt-dominated aftertaste with some tea flavors. Warming alcohol all the way through.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with good carbonation (although there is a slightly unpleasant bite in the beginning). Quite smooth as well.  Drinkability - Strong flavors, but very smooth. I could down a few bottles of this easily.  An excellent doppelbock. The flavors are excellent and it has a great mouthfeel. Highly recommended!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Appearance: Pours with about 3/4 of an inch of light brown, foamy head. This disipated quickly to just a thin layer of foam. The beer is almost opaque, but when you hold it up to the light, you can see a little bit of a reddish tint.  Smell: Malty, with an alcoholy sweetness. Almost a hint of raisins.  Taste: Initially, the sweetness of alcohol, followed by malt, and finished by roasted barley bitterness. A decent amount of bite from the CO2.  Mouhfeel: Average level of carbonation, mouthfeel is pretty good, decent body.  Drinkability: This is a very filling beer. I imagine it has to do with the high levels of maltiness, carbonation, and alcohol. Good, but not a session beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Jaynuze,4.33,"Pours nicely from a bottle with a little ram/goat/whatever on the neck.  Its appearance is a deep amber brown with a thick creamy head on top. Head disapates fast, but it does set a nice lace on the glass.  Its nose has notes of bread, sugar, and nuts. There is a hint of alcohol but it's subdued with a light note of malt.  The taste is very bready and malty with a bit of spice and hints of tobacco leaf.  The mouthfeel is full and creamy with a little agitation in the mouth.  This is a pretty darn good beer, one of the best of its kind.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,jletts,4.47,"A- reddish caramel with exceptional head that lasts and lasts.  S- Lots of elements come out in the smell. Strong plum, banana, slight apricot with notes of perhaps toasted almond in the end.  T- Plum, syrupy burnt caramel, yeasty with very slight notes of citrus and cocoa, buttery alcohol finish...smooth!  M- buttery and silky. Nice consistency.  D- very high, I could drink several and love it more and more.  This is my first taste of this great brew and will definately review again. I will need a few tastes to even begin to comprehend the complex flavors in this beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BlackJeremiah,4.73,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Put the goat in a safe place.  A: Incredibly dark, deep ruby with 2"" of head that reduces with significant lacing. Tantalizing, inviting.  S: Mild, roasted coffee, sweet plum, caramel, banana, brown bread. Very light scents, but they are temptingly blended. It's almost as if the beer knows it doesn't need to overwhelm to succeed.  T: Lots of banana bread sweetness, combining with caramel/brown sugar. Dark, mild coffee flavors pour over the top of this, with slight hazelnut and ripe, alcohol-soaked plums chasing. The nature and order in which these flavors are experienced changes as the beer warms; it's in a constant state of flux. Phenomenal.  M: Silky, creamy, velvety perfection.  D: This is simply an incredible beer, and renowned for very good reasons. The goat ornament will soon be joined by many more, without a doubt.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,swhitt,4.8,"11.2 fluid oz bottle with the nifty goat around its neck. Picked this one up from the Wine Gallery Kenmore in Boston. 4 pack a little expensive but boy, was it worth it.  Poured into my Dogfish Head snifter, dark brown with slight lacing and a delicate but delicious looking foam head. Almost opaque through the sides but viewed at an angle it's definitely a little transparent.  Smells of dark mollasses and slight fruity alcohol. Mmmm. Almost bready in texture. The light carbonation helps round this one out. Wow, almost perfection. This is one of my new favorites, up there with Liberator.  I could drink this one all day. This might be my new favorite beer. Too bad it's so pricey!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Osiris9588,4.38,"Poured from the 11.2oz bottle accompanied by that plastic goat. The color is deep brown, with some amber undertones at the bottom and edges. The fluffy, big-bubbled head shows solid retention, leaving some moderate lacing.  The nose if packed with grain, especially malt and oats, and a little sweeter, almost corn characteristic. The flavor consists of carmel malt along with roasted oats and barley, a little alcohol and molassas at the end.  The mouth is full-bodied and quite complex, going from lighter to toaster, then syrupy notes. It's quite a mouthful. It is also well rounded, making for a high drinkability. The beer is worth the price--the gimmicky plastic goat is just a bonus.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,wolffman17,4.57,"Ayinger Celebrator pours a deep and dark reddish-brown. A creamy tan head forms; not much lace on the glass. The aroma is dominated by big, sweet malts. Full of sweet plums, raisins, and caramel. There's a hint of alcohol in the background. This is one rich and full-flavored beer. Molasses and dark fruit are the forerunners; toffee, breadiness, and alcohol follow. It becomes more complex as it warms. It's thick and filling. For a big, malty doppelbock, this is very easy to drink. It's always fun drinking a beer of this quality. Bottom line: Celebrator is an exceptional beer. Tops the night off as good as any.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,MaltyGoodness,4.89,"11.2oz bottle  Pours a deep chestnut brown with a small tan head that recedes to the side of the glass. Mild lacing on the glass.  Aroma is rich and caramel malty with the scent of sweet molasses and a lightly toasted nuttiness. There are also some light bready and fruity smells dancing about. Smells perfect.  Tastes just like it smells. Amazingly complex blend of rich caramel maltiness with a hint of sweet molasses. Woven in are a delicious toasted nutty flavor and mild bready and fruity flavors.  Meduim body, light carbonation.  This is a truly amazing beer. Extremely savory and insanely drinkable.

Like dark chocolate & Bailey's Irish Cream.  Taste: Just perfect. I mean, my goodness. What the hell is going on here? There is nothing remotely critique-able about this beer. Not terribly complex, if that's a problem for you. Just very malty & dark chocolate-molassessy with a nice spicy finish  Mouthfeel: Like a Norman Rockwell painting in your mouth. Makes ya feel all warm & fuzzy. Like freakin' Christmas.  Drinkability: Oh, I'm celabratin' alright. This is goddam awesome.

The bottle has a cool goat pendant hanging from around the neck of the bottle, and this was served in a Celebrator pint glass...nice touch.  This dark brown / almost black brew has a minimal 1/2 finger head that went away pretty quickly. I smelled predominately vanilla, caramel, chocolate, hints of soy sauce and powdered sugar.  Sweet and smooth milk chocolate malts all over the place. Rich, medium bodied and milky in texture, this is an excellent beer! I like the supermalty smooth character of this one. Defnintley the best dopplebock I've had so far (although I really haven't had that many...I do like the style and will seek out others).",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,AudioGilz,4.09,"This brew pours to a substantially dark brown color; about as close to black without actually being black, yet you can still see through it when held up to light. There is not much of a head to type of. The aromas are pungent and can be picked up by my weak nose almost a foot away, which is quite rare. Coffee and cocoa make themselves well prevalent in my nostrils, to the tune of strong malt character translation into flavors on the palate; well above average. I notice dark fruits in the mix, along with a bit of chocolate and alcohol warmth. These qualities are meshed together with a slightly creamy molasses character, and just enough hop presence in the finish and aftertaste. There is quite a sweet aftertaste worth noting, definitely not a dry finish, but instead lots of residual sweetness that is most pleasant. Overall, it's not knocking my socks off, which makes me really want to try this beer on draft to really see what it can do for me.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,RobertDwight,4.6,"I had the privilege of having this lovely brew on tap after the wonderful tour at the Ayinger brewery. It pours a luscious looking dark brown/reddish color, with a lovely head that dissipates and doesn't lace. It has smells and tastes of chocolate, coffee, toffee, molasses, roasted barley, figs, dates, and roasted nuts. It has a heavy mouthfeel which is kind of sryupy. Drinkability is pretty good, but it is kind of heavy so i wouldnt want to many of these in a session.

The taste,like the smell,has dark fruit,smoked wood,vanilla, sweet malt,and maybe carmel. The m/f is medium with a nice creamy feel. All the flavors mix very, very well. An incredible beer well worth all the acolades given to it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,JWFokker,2.86,"It's a pretty decent looking, very dark brown doppelbock, with a good centimeter of creamy head when poured from the bottle, but it dissipates to about half that over a couple minutes. Lacing is pretty good, almost leaving thin sheets of foam down the side. The nose isn't particularly special, just malt and hops, no discernable alcohol aroma. The flavor isn't anything special either. It's pretty much what you'd expect from the nose. Malt, hops, bread. The mouthfeel is nice, thicker than many beers without being syrupy. The glowing reviews surprise me as I've found this to be a rather average beer. There are other doppelbocks that are considerably better than this one.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BeerSox,4.03,"330mL bottle into a mug.  Pours a dark brown, flirting with black. Ruby red edges along the bottom of the mug. With a mildly aggressive pour an inch thick head is formed. The head is sawdust colored, and slowly settles to a solid cap. Patchy laving all the way down the glass.  Dark malt characters can be detectd along with sweet syrupy aromas. Warm alcohol notes can be found hidden between the bitter malts and sweet smells.  Bitter roasted malts present themselves first, then followed by sweeter flavors. Mild hoppiness can be found in the back of the mouth. A little bit of alcohol can be tasted in each swig.  Medium bodied with spritzy carbonation. Somewhat of a dry bitter finish from the hops.  Not a bad beer. This one seemed to have more hops and a little less malt compared to other doppelbocks. Try this one.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Heavier wiffs i get some lighter creamcycle sweetness.  Taste. More tastes of smoke malts, lot more than the aroma would suggest, and more than i remember. Small amounts of dark fruits, prunes and cherries. Aftertaste is surprisingly light and sweet.  Mouthfeel is good. nice amount of carbonation, body is full and creamy.  Overall an excellent beer.

Smells is carmel, molasses, and fruit (bananas and raisons). Alcohol and hops are also present as it warms a bit. Also a bit of chocolate is present.  Taste is very contrasting. Initially very sweet like carmel. Then there is a bitterness from the hops. A little more hopped than I was expecting.  Mouthfeel is creamy and nice.  Drinkablility is pretty good.

Finishes very clean - lager yeast at work. Spicy hops aftertaste. Alcohol fairly well hidden, I think.  Mouthfeel: Medium body. Very smooth.  Drinkability: A very good beer, no doubt about it.

Thick with caramel, and layered toffee malt aromas. Sweet milk chocolate also teases the senses.  Double bocks and eis-bocks have been one of my favorite styles of late and this beer on draught proves this theory. Sweet somewhat roasty layers of caramel malt. Toffee coats the tongue on the long 45 second finish. Also the milk chocolate comes into play on the finish. Just spectacular.

39,131,Liquids,4.2,"A true dark brown color with lively ruby tones in the light with a full, one finger, creamy and not bubly, almond-colored head. This looks great in an oversized pilsner glass. Aroma is mild and delicious: definitely german but not stale and musty smelling as sometimes is the case--more malt aromas than hops but also not that ultra sweet, syrupy aroma. More of a husky, sweet chocolate malt aroma in the forefront with...a bit of peat smoked malt? Taste is delicious. Light but also dark, and so a bit hifi again like some schwarzbiers, though less so than others I've tasted of late, with some midrange sweet malt to balance. Definitely a touch of peat smoke with some drying cocoa flavors from dark malts. Unique flavor among dopplebocks, more complex. Definitely a lager, but that comes with the benefit of the enhanced smoothness factor. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full, and the weight on the tounge is retained even after some de-carbonation, which leaves many a beer watery and bland behind the veil of carbonation. Overall, this is among the great beers, best of style from Germany. I prefer Thomas Hooker's version admitedly, but this is the only other one I'd return to, and it's a worthy beer for special occasions.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Plum and raisin. Mixed in is a bit of red licorice. Very malty indeed.  Taste expands on the aroma, revealing the mass of malt in this one. Very rich toffee, baked sweets, faint creamy coffee. Finish has a black licorice character to it, a bit too much of that flavour for my tastes. Overall effect is very sweet, malty and packed with flavour.  Mouthfeel is very smooth, perhaps my favourite part of this beer. Full bodied with subtle carbonation, it feels just right.  The first time I had this, I was disappointed.

Sweet brown molasses smell with earth and nut notes and a hint of marzipan. Very prominent malt scent. Taste is caramel and sugar. Earthy and nutty. The aftertaste shows a little citric hop character just briefly which is then overtaken by another malt rush. Full and sticky on your lips mouthfeel. Good coating and slick sensation throughout.

This beer pours a rich looking dark chocolate color with garnet highlights. The head is a pale brown pancake head that fases fairly quickly to a thin covering.  The smell is a nose full of malt with some winey, fruity undertones. Maybe macerated cherries? A slight smokiness seems to be there as well.  Taste is wonderful-molasses and caramel with some dark fruit notes and some spice as well. Not at all sticky, though, just big and dry. Some burnt grain on the finish.

This beer tastes incredable. It tastes very toasty. Bready flavors are present. Also, chocolate and toffee are mixed in. I think this beer has a perfect mix of flavors.  This beer goes down smooth, leaving a creamy, toffee like aftertaste. It is low in carbonation, but it does not detract from the beer.  I think this beer would make an excelent session beer.

Hops are mostly floral and slightly spicy, but just enough bitterness to contrast the sweetness, quite balanced. Carbonation is low but provides a slight creaminess. Alcohol is barely detected, but at the level it shouldn't be.

Poured brown with ruby highlights, especially when held to the light. The creamy, slightly off-white two finger head slowly went to half the original size and remained for the long lasting drink. The smell was a blanced mix of chocolate, caramel, and hints of rich coffee. There was a slight fruity aroma in the background that enhanced the delicious aroma. The taste was superb. It was layers of rich, dark chocolate, robust coffee and caramel. As the drink slowly progressed, flavors of berry-like fruits came through to form an extremely well-balanced taste. It was rich and creamy in the mouth. It reminded me of eating a rich chocolate cake with raspberry or strawberry filling. If it weren't so rich/filling after a while (and not inexpensive) I would want to continue drinking these. It's one of my all-time favorites. Heaven in a bottle. Exceptionally smooth and delicious!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smokey rich malt is quite vigorous on the nose, almost meaty in smell. as it enters the mouth you get dark coffee notes. Smokey malt is the second wave but light and slightly watered down. Deep rithness is long on the mouthfeel and though the finish. There may even be a hint of dark ripe fruit. Very easy drinking. For fans of dark decently malty beers.

S- Strong malts...predominantly dark chocolate and coffee....very thick, roasty, and very sweet. T- Slightly sweet tip, light hop crispness in the middle of the body, and a long lasting bitter baking chocolate finish....a little bit of the coffee flavor creeps up in the aftertaste.

Taste is filled with a nutty sweetness that pushes up to a drying Munich character, emboldened by toasty grains. Wisps of peat. Layered molasses, licorice, anise, and a dry finish filled with raisins.  Mouthfeel is smooth and sweet, with piques of hop tartness that subsides to a quiet but complex sweet ending.  Two 11.2 ozer's wasn't enough to quench my increasing D-bock urge, but with a hefty price tag two ended up being plenty. Great beer...",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,instrumentality,4.47,"Poured into a Guinness pint glass that curved outward in the middle (my best glassware option at the time). This beer had virtually no head, and what did form dissolved quickly, leaving a thin brown lace that clung slightly to the glass where the head once stood. Beneath this was an opaque liquid that appeared to be anything from black to dark brown to amber depending on how the light hit it. I'll go with a very dark brown.  This beer has earned itself a new category: ""sound."" I could actually hear it snapping, crackling, and popping in the glass as if I had poured myself a Coke rather than a beer. Except Coke doesn't normally come with a plastic goat hanging from a string around its neck. What a great souvenir!  The odor was definitely potent, attacking my senses as soon as the cap was removed from the bottle. It smelled very richly of coffee and molasses.  I was expecting something intensely strong as I raised the glass to my lips for the first time, but instead encountered something amazingly smooth. The flavor was coffee-like but not quite as bitter, molasses-like but not quite as heavy, and candy-like, almost like toffee, yet only mildly sweet.  The mouthfeel was nearly perfect by my standards. The carbonation that had screamed at me before was very mild once inside my mouth, and the aftertaste was pleasing but very brief, making me anxious for another sip to replenish the flavor (I consider this a good thing, as aftertastes that linger tend to leave a stale skunkiness on my palate). The alcohol was noticeable enough to keep this from scoring a 5, but it wasn't intrusive.  I stocked up on Best of BA beers during my recent trip to Lone Hill Liquors in Glendora, CA, and I must say that so far, the experience of drinking them has been hit or miss (by no fault of the store - I just wasn't as impressed as I expected to be). This one, however, is definitely a hit. I'm not too familiar with the Doppelbock style, and it's been a long time since I've had any, but I seem to recall not being enormously impressed with past samplings. However, this beer is the definition of balance: the flavors are balanced, it's full-bodied yet easy to drink, and it's low enough on alcohol not to take me out of commission yet strong enough where one bottle is quite satisfying.  My only regret is that when I shared my first bottle of this (it came in a 4-pack) with a friend, we had to resort to plastic cups. He missed out.  Thank you, Ayinger.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,phishgator,4.75,"This is poured into a pint glass with a large tanned foam head. The color is a dark amber, almost non-transparent. The aroma is toffee, chocolate, bready yeast, and just plain sweet malt. The taste is much the same as the aroma of toffee, chocolate, big malt backbone, slight alcohol mixed with a little fruitness. The body is medium and smooth! The smooth and creamy texture of the body is velvety. I would say that more than two in one sitting is a my fill.

Dark roasted malt, almost chocolatey.  Flavor is very rich and complex. This is very much a roasted malt bomb. Has much in common with a great Belgian Trappist brew or a well done RIS, the layers of flavors just keep coming. Nutty, roasty, sweet, brown sugar, chocolate. Dark fruits like an RIS, almost a prune or raisin thing. This is truly a world class brew.  Mouthfeel is rich and thick, like skim milk. Coats your mouth with greatness!  Drinkability is very good.

39,131,InDreams,4.35,"Had this one at a nice beer bar on the Jersey shore, where they were kind enough to give me a bottle and a pokal to pour it into.  A: Poured into the glass beautifully; dark, coffee-colored brown, with a two finger-thick tan-colored head. There seems to be a bit of a reddish hue to it as well. Minimal, if any, lacing.  S: Wow, what an aroma! This is certainly for malty beer lovers. I get some roasted sweet malts; chocolate, caramel, maybe hazelnut. So sweet, it's almost fruity, and it gives you a nice warm sensation.  T: Mirrors the smell, only I don't know quite where this fruitiness might come from. Plums? Raisins? Otherwise, molasses, caramel, chocolate...general roasted malty goodness. Very sweet, as expected. Extremely rich. Too much flavor for you to pick up on the slightly higher alcohol content, and the hop character is underplayed and only really present, as perhaps some noble hops, on the after taste. Like the smell, it gives you a warm toasty feeling.  M: Thick and creamy, sort of lingering behind to give you a chance to enjoy the flavor. Not much in the way of carbonation or bite from the hops.  D: Delightful beer. I'm almost disappointed I didn't have it in the comfort of my home with a few friends and a warm winter fire. But there will be time for that. I will have to say however, that as with any very malty beer, and any extremely flavorful beer, this is one to be enjoyed in moderation. I can't see anyone throwing back a six of this in one sitting, but the 2-3 you may have will be quite fine.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A true dopplebock.  Malty sweet ""goat's breath"" nose on this beer, whatever that means, with some light roasted coffee aromas too. Some chocolatey toasty notes too.  Medium to full bodied.

Smell - roasty and malty with a slight hint of fruit. a very pleasant slap across the face, just makes you want to slide right in, kick off your shoes, and relax.  taste - just like the smell only much more prominent on the palate, the fruit doesnt stand out so much as it does in the nose but is still evident. the roasted malt is warm and toasty and lends those feelings directly from the mouth to your body. a good cold weather beer because of the roasted element, though there is also a certain crispness to it at the very beginning and it finishes a bit crispy too. good brew.  mouthfeel - coats your tongue and cheek, lingers for a moment and then finishes quite clean with a little residual flavor hanging out just to remind you what you're in for with your next sip.  drinkability - smooth and delicious, but it has such depth that it seems to be a difficult one to continue with after about 4.

Pours a dark, burnt-chestnut hue with a healthy, chocolately head. Strong smell of sweet malts.  For me, this has become the bar for doppelbocks. It is rich, malty, and sweet, with a really nice molasses flavor to it; the 6.7% alcohol content is not remotely evident in this complex brew. I have had some (alleged) doppelbocks that struck me as weak, watered-down caramel, and other that were nearly unpalatable malt-bombs, but this lands in just the right place.

39,131,macpapi,4.42,"Since I've been getting into dopplebocks this spring, I figured it was time to sample the highest rated on this site. Purchased a single bottle. Two rams, seem to be holding up a dopplebock serving glass. Around the bottle's neck is the legendary plastic Celebrator figurine, which I'm sure adorns many a BA's brewerania collection.  Celebrator Dopplebock pours a dark brown--almost black color--with a good sized tannish head. Nice rich and full color.  Smell is dominated by roasted malt. Chocolate, toffee and barley are also present in the nose. The full-bodied sweetness of molasses is also noted. Overall, this is a very deep and pleasing aroma.  Taste is very impressive. Chocolate is first to hit the palate, followed by deep roasted malt with hints of toffee. Deep sugary sweetness is present, along with a bit of hop (or is it alcohol?) bitterness. Balanced to the max.  In the mouth, this beer is full-bodied, sweet and bitter. It is relatively low in carbonation.  Is this Celebrator Double Bock drinkable? Um, yes. This is, as its bottle states, 'the finest Bavarian Double Bock.' Bavarian, or otherwise for that matter in my opinion (at least at this point.)

The smell is of dark, semi-roasted, malt with brown sugar, candi-sugar, some mollasses, caramel, and some anise. The ""smell"" of sweetness pervades the nose.  The taste is an inntial hearty helping of sweet malt with a big semi-chewy mouthfeel. Sweet from beginning to end with flavors of mollasses, brown sugar, and some caramel all easily detectable. Subtle toffee in the finish and just slight dry, especially as the beer warms a bit.  Mouthfeel is big and rich. A hearty and robust coating of the palate with little carbonation and slightly chewy from the sturdy malt backbone of this beer.  It's easy to see why this beer is in the top 100 and easy to see whay it is the basic epitome of the dopplebock. Superbly rich and sweet, right in line with what I want when I think dopplebock.

Balancing the dense malts are fruits-ripe apple, mixed berries including cranberries, mild resinous leafy hops, and a subtle but tangy wine-like alcohol. Taste holds true to the very well rounded smell. A wide range of sweet thick malts blend seemlessly with the various fruits and relaxed hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and juicy.

Somehow this beer is greater than the sum of it's parts, which, I suppose, is a credit to the brewmasters at the Ayinger brewery.

There is some alcohol in the nose, but it mostly smells of burnt malts that are slightly tangy, with caramel and a little black cherry. A decent brown head pours out to 3 cm and quickly falls, fizzling like nymphs absconding into the forest, to a splotchy film. (Again, I fear that this head is product of French mis-treatment of beer and glassware).  The flavor and color are equally deep and earhty (adjectives that can be used to describe everything about this beer). The flavor is smoky, of burned or even charred malts that has almost a barbeque quality to it. There is also an oaky and tangy side to this intense flavor with some red fruit and even hoppy grassy notes coming through.

39,131,Cwrw,4.47,"Finally! After what seems like ages, the renowned doppelbock becomes available in Alberta. Thanks to Delancey Direct for importing it into the local market. Comes in a 4-pack holder, telling about the numerous awards and a little piece on the side about the Aying brewery. 330ml bottles. The beers all have a white plastic goat-charm on red string around the neck...cool. I have never seen that before. Simple labelling showing two goats and a big glass of beer. Blue and white neck wrapping too. Popping the unlabeled white cap gives smoky bbq aromas rigth away. The glass reveals a cola-dark beer, deep chestnut brown and ruby-reds when held to light. Black, to look at it from a distance. A thin but consistent coffee-coloured head. Impermeable sheets of slow-moving lace. Looks mighty drinkable sitting there in the glass. But first...a sniff, revealing charcoal and seasoning salt firstly. Oh, but give the glass a slight swirl to release some beautiful notes of raisins, roasted peanuts, toast, grape-juice, and some very woody notes, like balsam or fir. A hint of the woodiness I am used to in some Belgian dubbels, but with more salinity. All the usual dark-fruit suspects: dates, prunes, and plums. The mocha/coffee notes arirve with the warming of the beer, adding a dusty bitterness. I get loads of salt in this beer from the roasted malts, giving beef roast and beef jerky smells. Some lactose in the malting too, very minimal. Little bits of German hopping appear now and again, but this is all about the meat-like grains for sure. For me it is similar to Salvator but more balanced: not quite as dusty or sour as Paulaner's doppelbock. Subtle, but extremely appetising. The mouthfeel is incredibly creamy and light on the tongue, like ice-cream. As soon as you sip you sense the almost airy quality of the body, smooth as oil on the tongue. Salty and sourish malting at first in the mouth, with full vinous grains on the finish. A lot of milkiness up front actually, with the soft sourness of table-cream. Hickory and tree-bark on the middle, some bbq and roast beef as well. A little less smoky or even malty as I expected, the whole taste just screams balance and tastiness. An aftertaste of mollasses and maple syrup, with next to no bitterness...this beer ends extremely sweet. Candy sweet with hints of licorice and brown sugar. The malting rarely lets you see the hops, but occasionally a little burst of continental hopping appears. Like the aroma, this beer just works through subtlety and good elements balanced masterfully. Full bodied and very low in carbonation. The drinkability is profound at only 6.7%. The alcohol is never noticeable. This is a doppelbock I could drink all night long. A noteworthy example of the style. Not trying to go over-the-top, just succeeding in a fine-tasting bock beer.

Smell  I like what I smell here. First off it starts with a molasses aroma which converts quickly to heavy caramel. There are chocolate smells as well with a touch of sourness which I like. I get brown sugar out of it as well as a grape like scent that almost reminds me of ice wine.  Taste  This one is maltyvery malty. There is some heavy caramel and toffee in there with the brown sugar sweetness added on. I do taste some roasted chocolate, but not much. Alcohol makes a bit of a presence as well. There is then a nice finish of slight hop bitterness and a fruitiness reminding me of dark grapes and plums.  Mouthfeel  Very nice here. Carbonation feels good and the beer is relatively thick. It almost feels chewybut not quite.  Drinkability  So easy for me. I had no issues downing this bottle and loving every drop.  This one is right up my alley. I had high expectations and they were met. I encourage all beer lovers to indulge in this one.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Nearly opaque however a ruby red hue under intense light. Also very cool that there is a small plastic goat hanging on the neck of the bottle.  Aroma - bready malt, molassas with slight hints of toffee and coffee.  Taste - pretty much as promised by the aroma. Subtle breadlike sweetness and toffee malt. Rich maltiness with a coffee bittering. Hops are undetectable except for the bitterness.  Mouthfeel - very full (yet not syrupy), light carbonation, smooth, very fast finish with only a slight coffee bitter type linger.  Drinkability - I would have to say this was impressive.

39,131,falloutsnow,4.62,"Enjoying the art on the bottle and pouring with forceful care, I'm left with a beer of incredibly dark brown body that when held to a light source reveals a dark ruby body with orange-red highlights. The head is a few centimeters in height, deep brown in color, and recedes slowly to a thing ring of dark bubbles around the glass with a few spotty islands of lacing. Swirling the glass and taking a sip leaves a few streaks of sticky lacing that eventually return to the pool of beer, reducing to small clusters of bubbles along the sides of the glass. Deep, rich malt scents: caramel, chocolate, and roasted malt aspects alongside more subdued aromas of figs, prunes, and alcohol. Quite the complex profile here, deeply enjoyable and always revealing more rewards to those willing to sit back and slowly enjoy it. The taste is fully developed and rich, almost nostalgic or memory-inducing in its goodness. A general smokiness pervades all the elements of the taste, like a fine mist on an early spring day. Rich roasted malt and chocolate malt flavors paired alongside sweetness derived from prunes and figs. The maltiness descends in the closing moments into a coffee bitterness that's quite well-received and rounds out the experience well. Mouthfeel is heavy to medium-heavy with a carbonation level that's very light compared to the body's heaviness, yet I wouldn't change a thing. It moves the beer and flavors enough around on the palate to be noticeable, but lets the beer be quite alone when it needs to be and allow its full complexity to develop on the tastebuds. Drinkability is fantastic: as this is a thick, rich beer one usually only takes slow sips of it. The 6.7% alcohol levels nearly guarantees that there's no effect from one of these. Having one or more is thus quite possible on a cold fall/winter/springs's day.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,debaniel,4.57,"i've had a lot of Spaten Optimator in my day, and i was eager to try the Ayinger Celebrator, as it's generally regarded as a top-notch Dopplebock... but does it surpass my beloved Optimator?   A- Poured from a bottle into a German stange glass (enhance that malt, baby) - you really have to hold it up to the light to see anything through this very opaque brew... a bright back-light reveals red highlights, like a concentrated Coca-Cola. One 11.2 ounce bottle poured to an inch of head, very little lacing.   S- The smell is, in my opinion, one of the finest aspects of Celebrator. All that delicious maltiness you've come to know and love in a great German Dopple, plus a very fruity sweetness... cherry, and chocolate toasted malt. I've been sitting here with my eyes closed, just sniffing, and enjoying it. Excellent. Touch of alcohol in the smell.   T- This one actually tastes a lot like it smells, without the alcohol. Very sweet fruitiness, once again reminding me of a cherry or plum. Chocolate and dark toasty maltiness, but very little alcohol taste. Warm.   M- i'd say a full medium body, very smooth, just the right amount of carbonation - just enough to prevent it from being syrupy with so much sweetness in the taste... but not so much that it tastes like a soda pop. Mouthfeel, while not chewy, is very satisfying.   D- Celebrator has such a fantastic aroma and taste that it's hard not to keep bringing the glass to your lips. Certainly more complex than Spaten Optimator - i only wish it were as cheap as Spaten! This definitely deserves to be called a world-class beer.  As an added bonus, each bottle comes with the little plastic goats around the neck... nice touch!

It smells warm and rich  T- dark roasted and bitter hops. A little dried fruit sweetness.  M- Medium to full bodied. It seems to lighten up as I drink it. It feels warm, but not like an alcohol warmth. Very pleasant.  D- This is a very enjoyable beer. I'm lucky that these are easily available in my area. I will try and keep these on hand.

39,131,MuenchenerKindl,4.73,"Poured from a bottle into a gold rimmed, steamed Ayinger Celebrator glass.  This beer is black as night with high lights of ruby red and orange when held to the light. The golden tan head is thick and lasting. It billows like high cumulous clouds on a warm dry spring day. An amazing beer to behold.  The smell is of chocolate, toffee and espresso with a slight carmel after taste. This is how god trained the Bavarians to roast malt. All should take homage.  The taste is the apex. This beer rocks. Richly roasted malts give way to a crescendo of chocolate and coffee and finised to perfection with hops in a way that leaves you begging for more. Better beers do not exist. I would gladly sacrifice feel and other lesser attributes for the taste and drinkability of this full bodied and unyieldingly complex world class beer.  Mouthfeel is quite adequate, your sences will be happy from top to bottom as it washes back.  Some rich dopplebock beers are great but you seem to be satisfied after a 12 oz or a 1 pint serving. But not this Ayinger. I say ' Herr Ober, Mass Celebrator, Bitte'  All in all quite an accomplishment from a brewery with barely a hundred years of experience. I purchased a case to age and will do follow up reviews as it does over the next several years. MK",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

It had a rich and bold roasted malt aroma with a hint of caramel to it and a medium hop bitterness. The taste was well-balanced and flavorful without allowing the higher amount of alcohol to make it taste ""boozy"". The mouthfeel was medium/thick with medium carbonation. I felt that this beer was quite drinkable simply because of it's high quality and excellent taste. My only lament is that I'm a college student and can't afford to drink these on a regular basis.

Color - deepest brown, almost black, and opaque, like coffee ( opaque and almost black ).  Aroma - bready malt, toffee, chocolate, and espresso. Tiny hint of hop lemon.  Taste - pretty much as promised by the aroma. Chocolatety bread and toffee malt with hint of citrus hops, followed with slight cola-like finish. Very good, seemingly rich without the full feeling one can get from rich taste ( full feeling in the stomach, that is ) .  Mouthfeel - very full, light carbonation, smooth, a little bit chewy.  Drinkability - this is very good beer, I could drink several in any one sitting. Abv of 6.7 may intimidate some into just one or two, but not me. Also alcohol is totally not present in taste at all, so that should be something to be mindful of if you're driving, but if not, well, bottums up !!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Came in a 4 pack of 330ml brown bottles, slightly art noveau design on the label, and each bottle comes with a small white goat charm attached to its neck.  Pours out a deep mahogany, opaque until it's been held up to the light where it attains some translucent cola-hued highlights. Two fingers of spongy tan head that recedes fairly quickly. Chewy toffee and dates on the nose, rich dark dried fruits, faint trace of alcohol. Traces of powdered dry dark chocolate.  Very dry mouthfeel. Roasted malt, dark toffee, a bit of fig sweetness in the middle, with a finish of dry dark chocolate and light roasted coffee beans. The flavour is not intense, but refined and balanced, the progression of flavours marries well. Well into the aftertaste a bit of boozy preserved fruit sweetness breaks out, helping to contrast the overall dryness of the flavour and mouthfeel.  Most certainly an enjoyable doppelbock, it definitely has produced its own niche for its take on the style, and a worthy following. Although I liked it I couldn't see myself buying this on a regular basis though, perhaps saving it more for special occassions and to introduce friends to this unique ale.

Very malty, caramely, brown sugar with some dark fruits and just a hint of hops to balance the sweetness. Not cloying at all.  The mouthfeel is amazing. so smooth and creamy. Like velvet, with just the right amount of bite. It just glides right down the throat.  Drinkability is great.

Smell: I agree with other reviewers that the caramel scent is obvious. I also picked up something I could put my finger on, until I thought about brownies. Very sweet and malty scent to this one.  Taste: As one might expect, the taste follows the smell. It's got a very smooth mouthfeel, and i found you get a bit more of the alcoholic warmness and kick to come out if you aerate the beer in your mouth a bit. Overall a very sweet, caramel, light chocolate and malty taste. Also I can pick up a hint of pear and apple. Hops are pretty hard to pick out. I'm new to bocks and wasn't expecting such a sweet brew, but I really liked it.  Notes: This isn't something I'd order with a big, spicy steak or any meal that's too powerful. It would make a great after dinner beer, though.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Nose is drenched in coffee with chocolate and alcohol on backing vocals. This is a very hardy, dense looking beer. Not quite as intimidating as I was anticipating, this doppel is not quite delicate but much more fluid in taste and texture than I was anticipating. The taste features coffee and caramel and liquorice flavors and well balanced hopping that hides the alcohol almost to a fault although also improves drinkability in the same measure. Carbonation is low and allows this beer to sit in the mouth for an eternity. In short, this is an excellent beer.

Aftertaste is residual with only a hint of drying noble hop I felt was a bit shy even for the style. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with low carbonation and a syrupy body.

Some caramel notes mixes with fruity tropical smells. Plums, a touch of raisins and a hint of fried plantains (bananas yum).  The taste is all malt. A sweet mix of caramel and lighter toffee. There is an almost syrupy taste with strong notes of molasses. The fruit flavors become more apparent then even the nose would indicate.

The flavor provided the expected big malts with a wonderful molasses presence. A medium body and excellent warming beer. There exists a hint of smokiness to Celebrator as well, very subdued, but there.

Fig and Date-like fruityness swirl-around as well adding a nice fruity complexity. The presence of pungent German hops is there on top, but is soon lost amidst the swirling, decadent sweetness to follow. A treat to drink, mellows and sweetens (though never too sweet) as it warms.

Pours a beautiful dark reddish/brown color with a nice head and long-lasting carbonation. Smells sweet (maybe chocolate/hazlenut?) and very malty. I was expecting a super-stong taste - but it was a rush of sweet malt that wasn't as heavy as it appeared. It went down very smoothly and felt great in my mouth. For such a syrup-looking beer, it was surprisingly smooth.  **EDIT** Had another few samplings of Celebrator, and each time, it fell a little in my rankings.  A heavier mouthfeel than the first I had tried. Taste and aroma were still that of malty cocoa; both were still wonderful. Just not as drinkable as my initial tasting.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,nlmartin,4.85,The beer was served in a wide mouthed 20 ounce goblet.  Appearance: The beer pours a very solid dark brown with a mountanous thick creamed coffee colored head. The head retention was nearly perfect. Thick lacing remained behind on the glass.  Smell: This beer has the smell of extremly good maltyness. There is a bit of fruityness and spicyness playing in the beer.  Taste: The beer is very sweetly malty. The hops just tingle with a bit of spicyness but not alot. This beer has a bit of fruityness and brief spicyness breaking up the malts.  Mouthfeel: This beer is full bodied. The malty taste seems to go on forever. The bits of hops prevent overkill. Just a massively chewy beer treat.  Drinkability: This beer is a very enjoyable beer. The beer is dam near perfect. I suspect I may have had a religious experience drinking this beer.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,edchef1850,4.6,"I finally got to tap a 30 liter keg of Celebrator and i couldnt wait to christen the barrel by enjoying the first glass. A rich deep brown when poured into my glass, decent head, tan in color. The aroma is inviting, malty and sweet, the flavor, as usual with this beer, is phenomenal. Big mouth sweet and malty with a nice roasted balance. I love this in the bottle but on tap man im obsessed with it. If it wasnt almost 7% abv i would drink it alnight avery night all winter long. This is pure malty goodness!. If you like this in the bottle seek it out on tap and you wont be dissappointed.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Best boublebock I ever had.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Tupperwolf,4.69,"I have been enjoying doppelbocks recently, and know Celebrator is the quintessential. However, it wasn't until trying it that I realized it's quite an exceptional beer, and all of the -Ators that pay homage to it fall just a little short in total experience.  For example, this pours out an extremely dark color - it looks like cola as you begin the pour, and darkens as it nears the top of the glass, forming a thin yellowish head - It's very dark indeed, happy to give up red highlights in the right light, but nearly stoutlike in other lighting conditions. The head is thin and leaves behind minimal lacing.  Rich, roasty, toasty oat bread slathered with butter and fresh clover honey - that's what I get from the smell. Very slight whiffs of alcohol, but no hops to note. Deep, dark, complex, lovely.  Warm alcohol whispers to the front of the tongue, while the middle tingles with the sweet, rich caramel of the malts. Toasty, tasty. What might be a hint of hops graces the back of the tongue when swallowing, and another slight hint of alcohol precludes a creamy aftertaste.  A slight sparkle from alcohol mingles with very gentle carbonation - slight, fluffy, it doesn't get in the way. The beer fills the mouth, rich and chewy. Very delicious.  This is a sipper of a beer. Sit back, relax, enjoy its deep maltiness!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,sevineyes,4.08,"Poured from a brown bottle with the classic plastic goat around the neck.  A: Black. Very black. Has a nice tan head that lingers.  S: Very sweet. Not atypical huge malt smell. Pick up some dry brown sugar and rasins.  T: Very fruity and sweet. Very malty and sugary. Rasin, can pick up some hints of black licorice and dark cherry. Complex flavor ending in a slight bitterness.  M: Dry and carbonation. Ends a bit astringent that acts as a nice compliment to the big malty flavor  D: This is one of those beers that you just can't drink too many of. Although it's got a complex flavor, the richness is a hinderance to drinking many of.  Overall: I'll be the first to admit that I don't care for doppelbocks much, but I've tried to give as impartial and unbiased a review as I can. Frankly I find the style too sweet for my tastes, but if I were to drink one this would top the list of those I have tried. Very complex flavor and unquestionably a fine brew.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Also complimented with aromas of honey and brown sugar.  T: Quite malty, but not overly sweet like some. Like other beers that share its color, it has a touch of roasted flavor, giving it an unusual character for a doppel. Strong alcohol presence in the finish.  S: Crisp mouthfeel with a medium-full body  D: This is the first doppelbock that I've had where I could drink more than one in a sitting (all the others I've had were to malty and sweet).

I ended up going to a frat house party and drinking it out of the bottle. I must say it has a potent smell and syrupy mouthfeel. I was feeling my stomach ache after the 3rd bottle (i did drink them quite fast). Tastes of dark fruits and molasses. Very sticky. I was licking it off my lips for 20 minutes. I enjoyed a Pear Cider afterwords, and the two mixing tasted like peanut butter!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BillyB,4.8,"Had on tap at Ludwigs Garten in NYC. The best place other than Germany to try it. Glass poured a dark brown with amber hues. Very thick, foamy brown head.

S - Smells like fig/raisins, malt, a little fruity, very nice.  T - Tastes malty with a hint of dark cherry then it has a dry hop bitterness to counter the sweetness from the dark malt.  M - Very light on the mouthfeel for the appearance. It seems like it would be perfect if the mouthfeel was a little thicker. Probably a little too picky.  D - Great beer, great doppleback, this one of those beers to use to judge others  Let it warm a little. It is soo much better warm.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

That's right you stop by to have a glass in the correct glassware for $3 during happy hour on your way home from work.  Looks like winter's bane robust red-brown darkness with a fluffy boiling fudge cream head. The smell is terrific damn near like boiling wort with lots of over done sweetness without being cloy. Terrific taste if only dampened by the slightly thinish body. While the body makes it more condusive to drinking more it leaves a little to be desired.

39,131,Mitchel,4.67,"Celebrator Dopplebock pours a very dark mahogany brown. The head is modest and is of a mocha color. It quickly dissipates leaving little lacing. But a beer can not be judged solely on its head. The smell is fantastic, very malty! It has tones of sweet toffee, anise, cocoa and just a hint of grape.  It tastes of toasted malts and breads. There are many layers to this beer, not just malty. There is an allusion to some hops and a bit of spiciness from the alcohol, I guess. This doesnt finish particularly clean or dry, but why would you want it to? It leaves a residual taste of dark sugars in the mouth. Very thick and chewy.  This is a fantastic beer.

Appearance: Dark brown with slight amber hues to it. Magnificent fluffy brown head and excellent lacing.  Smell: MMM Toasty dark sweet caramel malts! So malty and so sweet!! This aroma of toffee and figs is truly overwhelming  Taste: As good as the smell. Fantastic toasted malts, dark fruits, caramel, I think there may even be hints of nuts and figs. Complex, intriguing and full flavor puts it all out there on the table and holding nothing back. The aftertaste is sweet and caramely. The sugars that soaked into your gums earlier seep back into your mouth for a long time creating this very nice lingering aftertaste. It evokes in you the desire to take another sip, which makes this beer disappear very quickly.  Mouthfeel: This is the most smooth creamy chewy beer I have had the pleasure to know yet to date.  Drinkability: Extremely drinkable! This beer is so sweet its like liquid shoo-fly pie.

39,131,Ricochet,4.62,"Beads in the pour. That means good stuff to me. The reviews are great, I just reviewed JWD's Pale Bock and thought it was great, so, here we go with pretty much the standard. It smelled, like carrot sticks, heavy malt, burnt malt with a coffee note, pungent, a little raisin, lots to love in this beverage. Because I could only see a little light in this, it seemed like a porter or stout with a nice head at the start. Mouth? No way. Chewy. I have had five ""gulps"" of this and can't get an impression of the mouth, so, I gotta say, awesome. If they want to define how mouth should truly be rated, this would be it. Warming, foamy, alcohol, thick, wow. This is a 5. Period.  Tasting this beverage, well, all I can say is this is almost like drinking pure malt. It's like I'd want to pour it on pancakes. The raisin taste is strong, the dryness of the hops was really evident, and the winey notes define what a quality beer this is. Worth every penny. Drinkability is, well very good. Would I get it again, Yep, but like Gonzo Imperial, I will drink these on special occasions.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A lovely looking beer, head retains magnificently.  Smell: Deep roasted malts, touch of caramel. Bit of ground coffee, dark chocolate and toffee round it out.  Taste: Up front very mild bitterness created by some earth ridden hops. Malt backbone is littered with complex flavours of caramel, toffee, biscuit, roasted nuts, a touch of smokiness, earthy, coffee, bit of grains and oats at the end.  Mouthfeel: Tingly, good carbonation, slick and partially oily.  Drinkability: I'd drink it all night if I could.  Notes: A beauty, was a little worried because of the hype and following that this beer has that it wouldn't live up. I love being proven wrong.

Taste: Sweet milk chocolate, some rich, floury oats accented by a nice spicy hop flavor. Hints of coffee ground and cherry. Fine expressive malt backbone balanced well with the right hoppiness.

39,131,ski271,4.68,"Pours a clear, dark brown with a medium-sized, light tan, frothy, slowly diminishing head. Excellent lacing. The smell is quite sweet with big dark malts. Toffee & molasses are the dominant aromas, and are accompanied by a grainy cookie-like scent, some light yeast and some light herbal hops. The taste is oh wow this is good. Follows in line with the smell with the dark malts stealing the show. Caramel and molasses take center stage but are surrounded by a supporting cast of many different flavors, including plum, raisin, licorice, cola, alcohol and bready yeast. The finish is dry and has a very light metallic tinge late, not enough to really detract from the overall quality of the beer. The mouthfeel is wonderful for a doppelbock. Full body, and it feels thick and syrupy in the mouth but goes down very smoothly. Now granted, I am a sucker for a good doppelbock, but this is one of the best ones Ive ever had. Definitely the best bottled one for sure. Very nicely done!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The flavor is malty as hell with some caramel flavor also. A fruityness sneaks in every now and then. This is so robust and rich yet the drinkability of it leads me to conclude that this brew dominates over the optimator.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

There's a fantastic slightly-burnt quality to this beer. Rich maple syrup tones as well. Chewy and roasty and full bodied. Lovely mocha head and a deep dark body.

A huge head forms immediately. So much so, that this is a two stage pour. Light chocolate colored head forms on top of a very deep deep ruby. Almost opaque but not quite.  Aroma is a perfect caramel malt. So sweet and satisfactory. Smells smooth (say that five times fast). Breadiness to this beer also.  Taste is all malts, caramel, chewiness. Hints of chocolate as well. Alcohol is just barely barely noticeable, but noticeable. Also there is a sort of cherry coke mixed with Jim Beam taste as well. Unusual and tasty.

39,131,skillerified,4.68,"Huge, puffy tan head. Good lacing. Really, really dark red in color. It's almost black really, but there are these deep red tones the come through every so often. For some reason it reminds me of a dark red wine. Actually, if you hold it to direct light (which I know you're not really supposed to do to judge color, but sometimes it's interesting) the light turns bright red through the beer. A really intriuging looking beer.  The smell actually has a creamy texture to it. That seems really strange, but that's how it feels to me when it hits the nose. It's a sweet malt scent. Maybe a hint of caramel. Maybe a hint of pine and citrus too. Definitely a touch of chocolate. Chocolate brownies actually. Just a bit of a fruity scent too. None of this is particularly strong, but it smells good.  Tastes of smooth chocolate and a little caramel. Some malt characteristics. A little coffee or espresso. There is absolutely no trace of the alcohol, which I found a little surprising. Not that this is particularly high, but I can usually get a little of it if I try. A little of a dry rasberry flavor seems to creep in as it warms.  Extremely smooth, rich and creamy. This is a fairly heavy bodied beer. Mostly sweet, but there's a little bitter bite on the finish. Very nice really.  Had this as a dessert-like cap to the night and it worked perfectly.

Voluminous light tan head with considerable persistence and healthy lacing in the Celebrator glassware. Warm, inviting and sweet aromas spring forth with a decided mollases character predominant. Little hop assertion, and dominated by the sweet malt richness of brown sugar and mollases. A dryer finish than expected for this medium to heavy body, with little carbonation or alcohol detectable. Despite this, it's very friendly and warm beer ... evoking the desire to share it with friends (hence the name, I suppose.) Doppelbock is not my favorite style, but this is certianly a supreme exemplar of the style. Drinks easily and invites you to enjoy more ... A LOT of character and substance which almost tricks you into thinking this is a much higher ABV ale. Excellent representation of this Bavarian standard.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Optimat0r,5,"appearance - comes in a neat little brown 12oz-i mean 11.2-oz- bottle. one of my favorite bottles, im not sure why, maybe its the artwork and the little goat, or maybe its because i know whats inside. pours thick and really dark, classic dopplebock.  taste - extremely good. i find its noticeably better sipped out of a glass than from the bottle. my first try i was a bit diasappointed, but it has grown better and better with each bottle. extremely rich, complex, malty, flavorful, straightforward dopplebock with no hoppiness or fruityness, just pure malty goodness. slight presence of coffee and indeed a nutty presence as well. perfectly balanced. this is my kind of beer.  drinkability - i didnt want my last bottle to stop. i wanted to savor every last drop of it. im giving it a 5 for drinkability also, its hard to put the thing down, you could chug the whole damn bottle so easily, or just as easily sip it away. this is the best that beer gets(for me anyway). 5's across the board.

A significant, fluffy head formed with very little effort atop the dark mahogany body. This beer smells delicious.... the predominate fragrance, believe it or not!, was cherry pie, riding a wave of sweet mollasses, chocolate, and biscuit.  Flavour very nearly matched the smell, with some slight variations. Foundational was a golden syrup/treacle that bolstered fruit cake (dates esp.) and a little honey, with a continuous, but gentle reminder of an alcoholic punch through the finish.  Mouthfeel is chewy and viscous syrup, that allows a wonderful retention of the flavours well after swallowing.

The edges reveal ruby red hints. It pours with a vigourous head that slowly dissapates.  Smell: Barley flourishes in the nose. The malts make themselves known up front. I also detect some licorice notes and even a bit of apple (green not red or yellow).  Taste: While the malts are present, they are not overpowering. I'd even go so far as to call them muted. There is a small hop presence, but not enough to register.  Mouthfeel: The malts are a little abrasive and they linger long after the beer has been swallowed.  Drinkability: Drinkable enough, I guess. The abv is not overpowering and the sweetness of the malts can make for a good drink.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Oh joy unrequited this elixir pours the chocolate color of the richest molasses or sorghum with a cappucino head that is short lived and leaves scant lacing.  Aroma of carmel malt and rich cocoa waft to the olfactory glands as this beer loses its head. The decapitated brew now sports a jeweled necklace of foam, a perimeter guard in tan tightly knit and dilligently awaiting the next assault.  The taste is subtle sweetness, caramel and dark fruit balanced with coffee and cocoa. The initial sweetness dries to a sharp and dry hop finish that lingers as my tongue seeks out scatterd pockets of resistance clearing this slick medium bodied brew from the roof of my mouth.

39,131,Lnedrive14,4.79,"Well, this is the 1st beer that I have given a 5 to for taste. So, yeah, this is some kick ass shit.  A: Pours a truly dark brown, almost black, with a small pearl head. Somewhat darker than I expected.  S/T: Dark roasted malts predominate. Dried fruits, caramel, pumpernickel bread. Aftertaste is amazing! A bit of molasses and a nice, mild sweetness that states its claim on the palate and doesn't relinquish.  M/D: Silky smooth - mild carbonation. A very light body, quite a stark contrast from its appearance. Drinkability is amazing - i docked it only a little because the alcohol content is fairly low for a dopplebock, which i think adds to its drinkability.  This is an awesome brew. No doubt one of the best dopplebocks i have ever had, and one of the best in the world. Glad I have 3 more of these bad boys!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,soulgrowl,3.53,"Appearance: Nearly opaque blackish brown, with a quivering and volatile yet still creamy capuccino-colored head.  Smell: Very dark malty, some soy-like umami aromas come through along with a slight mineral tinge. Something about it reminds me of balsamic vinegar, but without the piquant acidity.  Taste: Grape juice, dark malts, soy sauce, kind of a funky sourness, possibly from the yeast. Very bittersweet, an odd melange of miscellaneous flavors. Would go great with chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and full-bodied, but just a little cloying.  Drinkability: This is not really the kind of beer I'd choose to celebrate with; it's much heavier and more aggressive than its moniker would suggest.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,petemoss14,4.59,"330 ml bottle.  Pours the deep brown of a medium roast cup of coffee. Puffy, mocha-tan head subsides after a few minutes.  Wonderfully sweet, bready aroma. Vanilla, caramel, chocolate all detectable. Prunes soaked in bourbon. Very complex malt aroma mixes with some alcohol esters and a touch of hop resin.  Tastes is fully of coffee, chocolate, toasty bread and oatmeal cookie. The high viscosity of this brew is evident on the lips and as it goes down the gullet, but a rather firm, underlying roasted-malt dryness combined with nice carbonation keep it remarkably light on the palate. This, combined with some nice hop balance in the finish makes this a very drinkable doppelbock.  This beer is just begging for some grilled sausages or venison steaks. A classic.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The head is a big creamy light tan that last for most of the beer. The carbonation is lots of tiny champagne bubbles.  S- The smell of dark roasted malt and caramel are strong even during the pour. Some dry pale malt with a hint of Munich malt comes through with the big sweeter malts aswell. There is a nice soft sulfur and green hop bitterness at the finish.  T- Notes of smooth toasted and roasted malts with some dry crisp pale malt notes are nice. The taste is smooth and crisp with no sweetness in the taste. There is a slight coffee or bitter grain note in the finish. As it warms it has a nice toffee nutty note in the finish.  M- Medium-light mouthfeel with a smooth but watery texture.  D- This beer has a very smooth soft quality to the grain bill. The finish is dry with a soft hop note.

Appearance: Deep ruby mahogany pour with a pancake batter-like head. Visible carbonation up the sides of the glass.  Smell: Wheaty and grainy with a pleasant and understated carmel background.  Taste: Raisins, slight smoke, nutty, with a brush of maple. Pretty much everything you would expect out of a classic ""malt bomb"". I love the balance here. It's definitely sweet but never approaches cloying at all.  Mouthfeel: Medium with lively carbonation.  Drinkability: The alcohol is deceptive and coats the tongue as you go.

39,131,ChuckD,4.6,"Poured into a clear chalice from a 11 oz brown bottle. No drink by or born on date.  In the glass, this has a huge, foamy head that has ample staying power, and is with you for the entire sitting. The color is a deep red, chestnut. Beautiful - as it is more colored that other dopples.  The nose is expectant of the style. Wild sweetness, with the alcohol in the background. From the nose, you seem to expect a real shit load of taste.  As you sip, the taste and feel in your mouth and throat will overwhelm you. Few brews bring the over the top malt sweetness with a delicate hoppy finish as this one. It is full and juicy. It's unbelievable. The finish let's you know that you are drinking a dopple as the sweetness and alcohol stay a long while.  Musings: This is one brew that I spluge and keep around every winter. The alcohol content is not as high as some other dopples - but the taste comes across like a monster. I reviewed this after the Sam's dopple. I do like the Sam's - however, it is not on the same planet as the Celebrator. This is one of the best beers you will ever drink. I don't know how it could be improved.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smells of mushy oil-cured black olives, prunes and tamari sauce if it weren't salty.  More dark, sweet fruit in the taste, extremely rich, somewhat cloying. Then, in the finish, a gentle alcohol bitterness.  A fascinating and extremely pleasant tickling carbonation across the whole palate.  Plump, full body.  This is an awesome beer!

39,131,jaluria,4.01,"I was highly anticipating this brew since I had ordered it several times before from my local store, but it had been out-of-stock.  Great artwork on the bottle; made it seem very special. Appeared a very dark brown color with an above normal viscosity and a tan colored head that did not stick around, but left little bits of lacing. Definitely appeared darker in color than other Doppelbocks I've had, and that made this interesting from the very start. Aromas of caramel, various types of malt (roasted and dark), and alcohol. There seemed to an astringent-like aroma as well, but that could have been the result of the different ingredients coming together, rather than an unique ingredient. Whatever it was, it was not appealing. I can best describe it as the feeling you get when you smell cheap perfume; it can begin to give you a bit of a headache. The taste was very good with a variety of sweet flavors coming through, quite complex and very malty. Rich and powerful, but perhaps, a bit too sweet especially in the aftertaste. Seemed almost like a malt beverage rather than a malty beer. The smooth character I normally associate with this style, just was not there. The drinkability is good; I could see myself having a few of these in one sitting.  I'll have to try this beer again on-tap.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The mouthfeel is very thin and the flavour is dominated by the roast character, without too much sweet malt to back it up. That isn't to say that it tastes bad, and it is worth noting that there are many other flavours dancing happily in the background . . . but they all play second fiddle to roast. It reminds me a lot of Salvator. That isn't a bad thing at all . . . but given the extremely high quality of Ayinger's other brews I expected to be blown away, rather than just be served another pretty damn good brew.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Complex flavors of malts, smoke, earth, grains, bread and some light coffee. Wow. Mouthfeel is medium to medium full bodied, with a smooth texture and a touch of creaminess. Good drinkability.

Pours a dark brown color with a full finger and a half of light tan head...disappears quite rapidly and produces very little lace. Nice aromas...rum raisins, a hint of smoke, and roasted malt. A very pleasant taste and perfectly balanced for the style...an earthy flavor and not overdone in any one category. All of the things detected in the nose make their way into the taste and the mouthfeel, while thin, is very smooth. Carbonation is perfect and this one goes down oh so easily.

I am sitting here drinking it now straight from the 330ml bottle.  The taste is strongest just after swallowing and is good malt with a taste of hops if you try to taste it. It's not nearly as strong as other doppelbocks I have enjoyed, but is by no means weak. The slightly hoppy aftertaste does dissipate very quickly though, but that's OK with me seeing how I prefer a malty taste.  Very clean and refreshing while it is in your mouth, and very thirst quenching. I almost think it might be a little too thin for a dark beer, but it doesn't seem to detract from the taste, so I guess that just means that one can drink more without getting full  A top of the line beer from a top of the line brewery.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

No head, and a dash of lace.  S - Nice and sweet with a malty body to it. Perhaps a little bit of licorice also.  T - Rich and malty up front with a bit lighter of finish. I am used to seeing (tasting rather) more body in the closing, but not so much. Not to say it's watery, but needed just a little more ""oomph"" at the end.  M - A beer with a body without being pushy. It gives you a mouthful with a sip, but still slides right down, exceptional mouthfeel.

Head stands strong lasting forever and leaving its remnants crusted onto the side of the glass. Nose was damp and heavy with malty notes including coffee, burnt toast, chocolate, and some alcohol. Taste is very big and roasty, somewhat like a light porter in a way but with a clean bright texture which sets it waaay apart from an average beer. Complex flavors unfold as the beer warms and come to include suggestions of mocha, chewy toffee, and a healthy dose of alcohol which isn't completely hidden and warms you quickly as this one goes down.

I'm usually skeptical of dopples as I've only had a few I really like - the cloying sweetness in some of them gets to me. Anyway... 330 mL slender bottle - it pours a brown/deep plum color with a fair amount of carbonation streams and a 1 finger, light brown head that is dense and sooo creamy, leaving sheets of bubbles all the way down the glass, eventually turning into lace. Beautiful to say the least. Smells of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, green hops, a grainy character, and a sweetness that comes close to candy, but nowhere near cloying. Tastes toasty with caramel, molasses, raisins, chocolate?, burnt malts?, vinous malts?, green/spicy hops, and a medium bitterness. I can't think of how a dopple could taste better than this. The body starts medium and smooth, becoming thicker and softer as I go. This beer is amazing (it just dethroned Ruination as my top-rated).

The pour leaves a brownish beer which lightens as your near the bottle, the head is a foamy white. Taste is malty but not overdown or buttery. The flavor really exploded on this one as the temp increased with no hints of the alcohol just the incredible malts. I bought this in a four pack which was four months out of suggested serving time and still loved this. I also had this on tap at redbones a few weeks back and it was wonderful as well, I didn't review it at that time as I was eating the kick ass buffalo shrimp and wasn't in the note taking mood.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,LuckySkuff,4.25,"My first impression was a sharp similarity to Spaten Optimator... this lasted about .2 seconds until the richness and sweet complexity fully sank in. Quite a superior brew indeed - it is unquestionable after the creamy mouthfeel and nice aftertaste fade away.  Looks-wise it get's an 'A' in my book; nice and dark with a decent, tan/white head that slinks to the sides of the glass after a moment. Very dark, just a slight hint of dark mahogany apparent when holding up to a strong light source.  The taste reflects the look of it, what one would be hoping for in their heart-of-hearts after the languid pour... chewy and huge mouthfeel with a barley-malt and roasted taste. A little caramelly for a moment before the malts and light hoppy bitterness wash it away.  Delicious to the last drop. One of those session-but-shouldn't-be beers. Two thumbs up.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Tastes like rum-soaked dates rolling around in molasses. Not much hop presence; just a bit of stinging florals around the tongue at the beginning. Smoked turkey aftertaste. Boozier than I expected for only 6.7%. Bit of alcohol warming in the throat and stomach. Mouthfeel is huge, creamy, and chewy. For such a big and bold beer, this is quite drinkable.

Looks like brown sugar and molasses showing ruby light under a tan finger of head. Smells strongly of German malts and a slight coffee bitterness.  Strong caramel and german malt with stinging carbonation adding to a bit of ""twang"". Hints of chocolate and molasses sneak through with a note of coffee roast bitternes.

The aromas are dominated by rich caramel and chocolate malt, although a touch of hops and some apple undertones pull through. Malts again dominate the palate with a combination of toasted caramel and chocolate. There are some tart cherry fruit and slight smoky flavors in here too. A background of hops as well. Medium in body. A lasting slight crispness in the mouth, finally breaks for a smooth finish and a dry aftertaste.  My first foray in to the world of bocks. I'm a self-profesed malt lover, however I found the body to be a bit lean and the taste sligthly acidic-- both of which detracted from my enjoyment of this brew's world-class malt profile.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

This was my second of four bottles brought back to Toronto from Texas (yes, Texas). Don't think you can find this stuff at the LCBO. Anyway, poured it (as usual) into a standard pint glass. A deep burgundy colour with a very small head.  Scents of raisins, cherries, bitter chocolate, and more alcohol than I really expected from a beer that isn't particularly strong.  Flavour is quite nice -- raisins, fruits, some hops. Not as complex as the Paulaner Salvator, although some good gruyere cheese brought out some additional nutty and butterscotch flavours (a great match!).  Mouthfeel is smooth, if a bit dry, and there's a somewhat bitter aftertaste which detracts from the overall impression.  I don't want to give the idea that I didn't like this beer -- it's quite good.

Nose is heavy on the caramel malts, go figure, with some coffee and some interesting raisin/prune/date notes. Smells like some Baltic porter found its way into my bottle. Taste is similar with dense caramel/toffee malts and some dark fruity notes with hints of coffee grounds. Mouthfeel is rich and chewy, the alcohol very subdued. Overall a very interesting dopplebock, again with surprising baltic porter qualities. It's good, I don't know about 13th best beer in the world good though. Still a unique beer worth trying.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,skynxnex,4.5,"After gentle decanting into my glass, the head continues to grow. It's tan and dense. It slowly shrinks leaving some lacing. The beer itself is a dark ruby-cola color.  The smell during the pour is chocolate, sweet malt, and alcohol. The taste bears that out. It has dried fruit (although not really fruity), prune, and other sweetness. It's balanced off by the roasty chocolate and coffee flavors. There could be a slight acidic edge. Amazing. Little hop aroma or bitterness. Some hop flavor. Bitterness arises from the roasted malt.  The mouthfeel... it's full. Almost sticky, but not. It feels your mouth but keeps you wanting more. After my first, I easily could keep drinking. It doesn't go down super fast, but it's still really, really nice. Great beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Gaben,4.5,"Ohhh man talk about a brew..! It is called the Celebrator for one reason, after you drink some of this you'll be celebrator-ing all night baby.  After a mixed 6 pack of beers I did have some nice picks and saved this one for last ... man was I in for a nice treat.  This appearance is a mildy dark german beer with a great bottle for advertisement.  Both smell and taste and amazing! After about two sips of this , the 1st word that came out of my mouth ""Umm beef stew!"" did remind me of some stew but thats not bad was an amazing tasting doppledock.  Mouthfeel and drinkability would usualy be low since I would see how some wouldnt dig the ""beef stew"" feel to it but I have to say , I myself do dig dem damn meat beers!  I am for sure buying alot more of the celebrator for tomorrow night!!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,TurdFurgison,4.23,"Latest in my quest to expand my experience of German beers. Poured from a bottle into a Watou brewery chalice. Dark chocolate brown with thick khaki head, really inviting. The aroma was enticing as well, but I think I prefer the weizenbock aroma over the doppebock. Just my preference...  Taste was good, malty and a little roasty. The main thing I will rave about was the mouthfeel. Coated everywhere, and felt so smooth. Really awesome in that aspect.  Excellent dopplebock, although Paulaner Salvator is a bit better in my opinion.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,SkeeterHawk,4.48,"Appearance: Pours a super clear deep reddish brown color with a two inch tan head of tight bubbles at first pour. The head acted like it wanted to stick around for a while. A thin foam stays on top of the beer the entire session, and it leaves an attractive tan lace around the glass after drinking.  Aroma: Lots of toasty notes along with a hint of chocolate. There are some Melanoidins here, but they aren't as assertive as they are in Optimator. A bit of caramel is more noticeable as it warms, but the alcohol is reserved.  Taste: Really rich flavor with a smooth sweet malt backbone and some toasty/earthy notes resting on top. There is a bit of a plum flavor here along with the chocolate and caramel. There really arent any hops noticeable until late in the finish. The sweetness is the dominant force in the flavor. There is a slight hint of alcoholic warming long after the finish. It is not lacking in body, but I would personally like it a lot more if it had a bit more girth to it.  Opinion: I am a BIG fan of DoppelBocks, and they probably make up a third of the beers I make. This is one fine example of the style. Most homebrewers any more think that this style should be really big, but this beer comes in at 6.7%. That isn't too big, but it doesn't lack flavor due to the alcohol content being on the low side for the style. This is a world class beer, and one to be enjoyed!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,GolgiIPAratus,3.78,"Sampled: 10.30.05  Appearance is dark with reddish hues. Looks almost like root beer. A thick head of foam upon pour, fades slowly leaving moderate lacing.  Aroma is at first a touch metallic. Not sure how long this one had been sitting in the cooler, but it may have been suspect. I was a little disappointed as I knew the potential of the brew, but further sniffs warranted slight redemption. Roasted malts and brown sugar rose up to tickle my nostrils.  Taste was better than the smell. Phew! Very roasty, with HUGE malt presence. Sweet like molasses, but an excellent bitter hop finish created a nice balance. The beer was low carbed in the mouth and while it felt lighter early in the glass (colder), it felt like it thickened and got richer as it warmed. Never too much, but a definitive difference over the time period in which I drank it.  The malts are huge here, so depending on how much you like that aspect will determine how drinkable this is. Im still new to the doppelbock realm (only my second), so Im still acquiring the taste for what Im looking for. It made it a slow goer for me, but one I enjoyed while it went.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,fromage,4.32,"Wow, what a great, complicated beer. Great with food and on its own. Took me some time to appreciate these... my girlfriend thought it just reeked of molasses.  Poured into a pilsener glass. About 50 degrees. Shows a dark, dark brown with ruby highlights. Much bubbling along the sides of the glass. It was hard to form the little tan head which soon faded, but left lacing for about half the glass.  Smells slightly of coffee and cocoa, but there's definitely a good deal of molasses, pumpernickle and cinnamon bread. Perhaps a hint of black currants, but I didn't detect a whole lot of fruits. A slight bite that's hard to characterize. I wouldn't call it citrusy or grassy or astringent, but maybe a bit of acridity.  Taste is about more of the same, but after the sweet, bready bite I detect a sweet strawberry/cherry center. The sweetness fades into a bit of dryness, but mostly an earthy aftertaste. Mushrooms or St. Nectare cheese I recently had in Paris.  Medium mouthfeel, slightly weak going down, and definitely weak if you drink it too cold. Surely has a lot more gravity than most lagers i'm familiar with! Coats the mouth... aftertaste lingers.  Worth the 15$ I paid for the 4 pack (including tax). Great with pork & an apple / cranberry sauce & buttered red potatoes.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,warchez,2.92,"aroma: slightly grapey smell, once poured there is some maltiness, however the smell os more of estery fruits and cereal like qualities. Apperance: Its a dark flat brown, there are little rudy or red tones to it to make it seem more vibrant in color. No sediment in bottle Taste: strong tastes, very complex. head itself tastes sort of copper-like, not bad. Malt flavor has a raisen/dried fruit/prune flavor to it. Pleasant mold bite on the palate. Slight alcoholic finish to it with a warming effect. Mouthfeel: this is the most striking feature to the beer. The flavors grab hold of the tongue and coat it. It has a thickness to it that doesn't quit. Continually rubbed my tongue on the roof of my mouth as iff to clear something. The wholeness of the mouth feel experience is nice. Overall: not a session beer. I don't care for the style, however the mild fruity malt character is true to the style and it is well done. The mouthfeel alone makes it worth a try. Not something I'd drink again, but had to try due to its high rating and often talked about qualities. This would maybe pair well with a strong beef stew.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,radshoesbro,4.25,"pours dark dark red with a finger and a half head that fizzles down and leaves a veil of bubbles over the top of the beer. for some reason when i smelled this all i could think of were concord grapes...even though there is absolutely nothing that has to do with concord grapes and this. very odd. anyway, there is a nice roasty malt and hop nose and it brings to mind bannana nut crunch cereal. i actually held up a box of this to my nose then smelled the celebrator and i'm quite positive thats what it smells like. there's also prevelent alcohol in the nose. alright, time to taste this!! well, well, this is not what i expected to taste! the only other doppelbock i've had is hooker's liberator and that had a tremendous chocolate taste. this on the other hand tastes of bread, crackers, cereal, etc. definately very interesting and triguing. i could drink this all the time if pressed. going to definately be picking up a four pack the next time i go to yankee.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,battlekow,3.2,"Celebrator looks awesome. It's a thick brown with a huge tan head that soon fades to a thin, even layer of bubbles. Plus--the necklace! How many beers are classy enough to have a necklace?  The primary scent is like baby food. I think it's a combination of caramel and dark fruits/anise, but to me it comes off as candied carrots. I'm not a fan of candied carrots.  The taste, fortunately, gets it better; the caramel and anise are more distinct. There's a little nuttiness, and it finishes with a very pleasant roasted flavor. I'm really not getting much chocolate.  Celebrator was okay, but honestly, this seems more like a weird nut brown ale than a doppelbock lager.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Cappuccino colored head. Very appealing.  Smell -- Very malty. It smells like bread and cookies. Can also distinguish a carmel scent. I do believe I can also pick up faint traces of hops.  Taste -- Sweet, bready, and malty. Reminds me of the taste of a bowl of cereal.  Mouthfeel -- Thick and heavy. Kind of chewy. Nice carbonation.  Drinkability -- I could drink a couple of these, but would probably end up feeling overly full. It is a nice easy fall drinking doppelbock. Very filling!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,UberWasser,4.45,"11.2 oz brown bottle, no freshness date, served in a 24 oz Pilsner  Pours a dark brown with light brown glowing through on the edges. The head is thick, foamy, cascading and has a dark tan color. As it dissipates dips and valleys spread across the top. Very attractive.  The smell is heavy on the roasted side, some slight hop earthiness comes through, and then a definite yeast smell. Also some notes of dark chocolate and maybe even what I found to be pan-roasted rasberries. Very interesting.  The taste is very good. Heavy on the roasted sweetness. A little sourness like dark chocolate. Leaves a spicy aftertaste on your tongue, which is the only time you taste the alcohol. A very heavy note of molasses jumps to the forefront as the beer warms a little. A little fruity and earthy in the background. Quite complex and good. Mouthfeel is incredibly thick, probably as close to motor oil as anything Ive drunk. I really like it.  The only tangible downside to this beer is the sheer weight of it. Its thick as hell, and quite strong. A few sips of this and my stomach is getting pretty heavyl. Yow. Not a session beer. But definitely one worth sipping and pondering.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,danielharper,3.38,"Purchased from Woody's Smokes and Brews, Franklin, TN.  Not a big fan of Dopplebocks. Take that as you will.  This beer pours dark with a thick off-white head. Very black body, but with a reddish tinge at the bottom of the glass. The head is thick and dissipates slowly.  I found it to have a roasty, matly aroma with complex flavor notes, almost licorice-like in quality. Enjoyable.  Overall taste was very similar, although I thought it was a bit more complex, with notes of coffee, chocolate, nuts, as well as the aforementioned licorice. It also had a bitter finish and aftertaste, but not unpleasantly so.  Mouthfeel was medium, with not much else to report, and drinkability was decent. Average scores on both fronts.  A note: After drinking this beer, I happened to wander past my fiancee, who got a whiff of me and was intrigued. She's not a fan of beer in the slightest, but I think the maltiness piqued her interest. She gave me a closer whiff, then started her own ""tasting"" by kissing me lightly on the lips several times, each time coming back with different flavors that she liked. (She's into wine and good food, and is probably a ""supertaster"".) She found licorice, coffee, pistachio nuts, and even bubblegum on me, and was getting more and more into it before suddenly reeling back and realizing that some unknown ""beer"" taste had just wafted into her consciousness, and now she was unable to enjoy the other flavors.  Does Ayinger make cologne or mouthwash? I can only wish.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

When held directly into the light, it almost takes on a dried blood color. But when not directly in the light, the color is a dark chololate brown. The smell is of a pleasant toffee and malt note. The beer itself is any easy swalow, which was not what i was expecting from such a dark beer. This easy drinkability allows the drinker to let it be absorbed by the palate to soak as much flavor as possible. The taste mimics the smell exactly with a clean, smooth finish. This dopplebock ent well with hamburger and a cold tomato, onion gespacho very nicely.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,waldowin,4.4,"Pours a wonderful dark, dark malt color, with ruby highlights at the edge when held up to the light. A two-finger light tan head forms immediately, and the surface boils for quite some time. Eventually it fades down to a cap.  Smells of malts, vanilla, and honey. Very rich and sweet, and pretty direct.  Taste up front is just loaded with malts. Some roasted, some not, and a small amount of completely unsweetened chocolates that show up near the end. Initial sweetness like biting into a plum, followed by a very aggressive set of hops, spiced and tangy. Finish is extremely smooth, and the slightly bitter tang of hops leaves you craving more of the malt sweetness.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly ""big"" for a beer that's only 6.7% ABV. Extremely carbonated. Leaves a sweet slickness on the lips, and a tangy layer of hop oils on the tongue. Excellent combination.  This stuff is scarily drinkable. I had to open a second and let it sit so I could try this warmer. I'd finished the first bottle without giving it any time to warm up, by accident. Definitely the best dopplebock I've had so far.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The smell s a bit airy and yeasty, with some medium maltiness underneath. It smells like the homemade crusty brown bread of my youth. That smell brings back nice memories.  The flavour has hints of slightly over-caramelized brown sugar, molasses, some subtle spicy hops, and a tanginess just at the end. Very nice.  The mouthfeel s just the thck side of medium, and is not overly assertive. Carbonation is tight and just about at a perfect level.  This is a very drinakble beer, and would make a fabulous sessioner.

When swirled around, you get a fruity smell too.  Taste: It was very malty with coffee, chocolate, and caramel in the background. A typical Dopplebock taste, but just a little better than some.  Mouthfeel: It was lightly carbonated, full-bodied, and with a malty coffee, and alcohol aftertaste. Being full-bodied it really goes down smooth. Although you can taste the alcohol, it still hides it alcohol content.  Drinkability: An excellent example of a dopplebock that you can drink all day. A 11.2 oz bottle really doesn't go that far.

Perhaps the truest double bock in terms of taste...sort of the Guinness of d-bocks. While the caramel sweetness is present, it is not the main flavoring. There are chocolate notes, sinewy alcohol touches, and (quite surprisingly) excellent hop balance which I taste on the roof of my mouth as I swallow.

Pours a dark opaque brown with a full three fingers of bubbly tan head that stays all over the glass. I actually didn't know much beer I had left in the glass because the lacing covered up where it was. Aroma is dark bready roasted malt with a hint of spicy alcohol. Taste has a hint of raisin, thick roasted maltiness and a nice supportive hop bitterness along with an alcoholic presence. The best part of this beer is the thick velvety mouthfeel which I have experienced nowhere else, even in stouts. Absolutely stunning.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,ommegangpbr,4.38,"From a 330 mL/11.2 ounce bottle poured into a chalice; no freshness date to be found. This is on par with imperial porters and stouts (double, imperial, take your pick) with regard to appearance, smell and flavor. Opaque black with a tan head... could have used a bit more head though it was served on the colder side of ideal. Smells pretty good... not as fragrant as I'd like to experience given the reviews; I caught some raisin smells and some mild roasted smells. A little bit yeasty, perhaps. Tastes... Belgian. Almost, anyway. Closer to an Imperial Porter than a stout but similar characteristics. Very deep, complex flavor. Dark fruits come to my attention again, as well as a little bit of chocolate and coffee. Coffee comes through in the mouthfeel. I've been wanting to try this for quite some time and I'm glad that I did.

39,131,andjusticeforale,3.83,"I poured a twelve oz. bottle into a rounded pint glass. It poured out like Pepsi with a scant tan head. It was dark but alive. It seemed like it was well carbonated. It was not dark and oily and big like a stout or porter from the British Isles. This was heavy and consistent in a different way  There was not much to the nose of this beer. No appreciable fruit, yeast, herbs, hops, anything. Just a beer smell. A very good beer smell, with all its goodness, but nothing really too interesting. If you read a review that says there is much more, its probably romantic glorification because I swirled and smelled and let the thing sit awhile and swirled and smelled a bit more. Maybe there was some cocoa/coffee smokiness and malt but that is all. There was no lace on the glass to speak of. Thats really not the point of this, though, is it?  On first taste, there was a distinct non-sweetened espresso/coffee flavor, and the aftertaste was as fizzy as hydrogen peroxide. This happened again, and I tasted and tasted and searched for complexity. There was a big malt flavor that pre-dominated, along with a stout-like coffee taste that was prevalent.  There was one saving grace here, a really faint hint of sweetness that added a little bit of depth. Dont get me wrong, there was no alcohol flavor, and there was absolutely no hops bite here, and the mouthfeel was huge and chewy, with a good deal of carbonation present. If this was your type of drink, the drinkability here is very good- 3 or 4 would not be out of the question, if you had the intestinal fortitude and a designated driver.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,RidiculedDisplay,4.57,"Pours an incredible combination of red and deep, deep brown, combining at places to a purplish hue. Decent head which dissipates fairly quickly, little to no lacing after the first few sips. Smell is of molasses, sugary figs, small hints of caramel, warm wheat bread crust. Tastes heavily of molasses, woody earthy notes, bread, and a slight but pleasing alcoholic flavor. If you ever had it, this beer has one of the strongest acai tastes (brazillian fruit) that I've ever tasted without acai actually being present (in my opinion, this is a good thing, as I like acai) - sort of that chocolately but fruity sweet funk. Take it for what you will but that was my impression. Wonderful mouthfeel and very drinkable despite the aforementioned alcoholic presence in the taste, which, again, is very pleasing rather than overpowering or abrasive.

Head lasts well, with average to good lacing. Aroma is incredible, sweet malts, and nuttiness like you wouldn't believe. Taste is just what the nose portended, although maybe a little less so.

There is a rich smell of fresh bread, with alcohol lurking beneath. I can imagine lots of other smells within, raisins, licorice, black pepper - but mostly bread.  The beer has a fine, heavy malt flavor. The alcohol hides here, behind rich dark malts. There is some sweetness and a little bit of bitterness. There is a little caramel, and a smoky flavor and texture - very smooth. The finish is sticky, bitter and sour - satisfying - it brings back the subtle complexities noticed in the aroma.

The smell is heavy of malts, smells like coffee and chocolate - unusual for a doppel.  The taste is perfection, strong on malt taste but not overpowering, the taste is roasty, hints of coffee/chocolate, the aftertaste is the best of any beer I've tasted. The beer is never harsh on the mouth but the head retention isn't perfect to give the beer the best of all smoothness. This is such a great beer, and I would have another, a slow session of this one is best.  Final Thought: This and Aventinus are the clear champions in the bock variety, which has quickly become my favorite style in German brews. A classic beer!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BEERchitect,4.5,"A beautiful specimen of the Dopplebock style.  The dark, dark brown beer pours with a soundful plop in the glass. Malty even to the ears. Nearly opaque with a medium, tan head that lasts the session. A good deal of lacing on the glass proves either to be too heavy or verly well malted.  Heavy toast without roasting in the nose. Rye breads, beer breads, grainy breads... the beer is all about the bready-toasty malts. Mild toffee and nuttiness come in late. Secondary scents of fruitcake and dehydrated fruits from cherries, apples, pineapples, dates, figs, and raisons swirl around a light rum-like sweetness. Promises greatness.  Outstanding flavors of the fruits, breads, and alcohols that are described in the nose transfer unadulterated to the taste but with less heaviness or boldness than expected. Still, the heavy emphasis is on the bready, melanoiden meaty flavors with a touch of soy-sauce aging. Toffee and nuttiness round on the the malts and make them identifiable.  The body can be summed up in one word: Malty. Of course the bready notes come full throddle with a creamy, robust, full texture. But all that seems to whisp away in a magical last second. Part of the beer evaporates while the otehr parts thin into a toasty-sweet beer that makes for remarkable drinkability.  Celebrator is one of the few true Dopplebocks the exemplifly the style to perfection. Could it use a bit more complexity on the fruits and a bit more balance on the lagered-oxidized front? Maybe, but no faults here.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Plums and currants are present, and the sweet after finish leaves one wanting some spice cake or mincemeat pie. Mouth feel is like drinking a malt. Not much carbonation. Compare side by side with Salvator sometime. Interesting. Love this stuff!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

CAn't taste the coffee aspect, but I have before in this brew. Less aftertaste than I have noticed before.

Raisin bread dances on the palate washed over with a generous dollop of warming alcoholl. Lots of different but subtly sweet fruits are present. Huge grain character with very malty german barley. Hop bitterness is light and hop character is just mildly spicy. Finishes a tiny bit sweet and warm. Like biting into a huge loaf of freshly baked fruit bread that gets you toasted.  Thick bodied, just as it should be, with adequate carbonation to keep the flavors moving.  A fantastic doppelbock, for sure.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Really inviting, great combination of aromas. If there is any hop aroma, it's subtle and grassy.  The first creamy sip has roasted, almost burnt malt, dark and glorious. Sweet figs and orange peel; rhubarb and bitter cocoa. The finish is mildly fruity, but dry, and leads to a satisfyingly bitter dark fruit aftertaste.

39,131,Domingo,4.9,"Quite possibly my favorite overall beer. I tried it about a year ago at Old Chicago and couldn't recall the name of it...until I saw some bottles with the trademark plastic goats hanging around the neck. Looks dark...not quite murky, but like a cola but still very clean. When you pour it, the head will stick around until it's finished. Super-malty...unmatched in this regard, actually. I've tried hundreds of beers and I still haven't found a maltier brew than this one. I'd describe it as having a chocolate flavor, but with raisin and date highlights. I can't say enough good things about this brew. If you're a fan of doppelbocks or even just darker brews in general, this is a must have.  Edit: After drinking this brew many many more times, I have to say that this brew holds up to a changing palate amazingly well. I enjoy it now as much as the time when I first tried it...perhaps even more. While I've had 15-20 other doppelbocks that are all wonderful, only the Andechs and Korbinian can keep pace with Celebrator. The chocolate/raisin profile is unique and simply amazing. I think this beer is an easy candidate for the best overall in the world.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

I really liked the way it looked int he glass with it's tall head and dark color. There's even a nice red hue when you hold it up to the light. Then I smelled it. It smells bitterish kind of like a beligum beer, but not really. I'm terrible at explaining scents, it just smelled off. Maybe I got a bad bottle?  Anyway, so I tasted the little thing :)  Little sour, little bitter. Malty, taste of oats and earth. Spicy aftertaste, warming.  I wasn't a fan, but I'm the vast majority, so who knows.

Could, with a little help, throw Doppelbocks on the top of my favorite styles list.  Appearance: Deep, deep red. Lets very little light through. Khaki-colored head (actually, the color that comes to mind is ""the insides of a Whopper"" - the malted milk ball, not the burger).  Smell: Roasted something...nuts, perhaps? Some cocoa aroma in there as well.  Taste: Chewy and nutty, heavy on the malt; slightly sweet. No hint of alcohol in this one. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: A bit thinner than I expected, but real nice nonetheless. Carbonation is perfect.  Drinkability: I can just see myself at the local pub hoisting stein after stein of this stuff.

39,131,mentor,4.41,"12 oz bottle obtained from John's Grocery (Iowa City) and consumed a couple evenings later (June 2005). Pours a two-finger light brown head over a dark brown crystal clear liquid. Smells wafting up during the pour were sugar, caramel, toffee, and alcohol. To the nose I get a dry chalky malt, caramel, alcohol, and a hint of chocolate. Ho baby this tastes incredible. Overall, it's wet sweet with distinct caramel and so malty it tastes like barley grains. It starts with a slowly rising sweetness that ushers a sudden caramel zomp (yea, I said 'zomp'). Right after the caramel hits, there's a nice dry chocolate with hints of nutty. An alcohol sting plays quietly behind these candy flavors and is tamed by a sugary sweet. Oh, what a divine combination...each flavor works well with the others and is at an appropriate level to satisfy. After the swallow, the alcohol gets a bit strong (no surprise, that's usual) and the chocolate dries out a bit. I was hoping the aftertaste would hold a final transition to new flavors, but I didn't get that experience. The bock character is present, but not as strong as I would have liked. I won't detract from my scoring of the beer, as I know I like strong bock character (which wouldn't be to style). Medium-thick (almost thick) mouthfeel with mild carbonation.

Sweet Vidalia onion-I know weird but it reminds me of it. Also the smell of nuts.  Taste: Nutty Chocolate. Reminds me of the top of a nutty buddy ice cream cone or cracker jacks. A peanut flavor, like peanut-brittle. Tastes sweet.  Mouthfeel: Medium to just a little full body. A hint of alcohol, but mostly the alcohol adds a little sweetness.  Drinkability: A good tasting and versatile brew. Not really a summer brew, but I'm not faulting it for the season. It has me looking forward to winter months.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

My thoughts on the first sip are that it is a decent Doppelbock, but not nearly as good as it is commonly bragged up to be... It has a decent sweet malty aroma and a very sweet taste, burnt caramel and a roasted malt bite. Paulaner owns me in this category.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,TPSReports,3.3,"This beer pours completely opaque -- which I expected. What I did not expect was a lack of head. I poured this baby into a chalice, and I was greated with a minimal short lived dark brown head that settled into a small island in the middle of the chalice with a ring around the edge.  The aroma of this brew is unusual to me. Granted, I am no expert of Doppelbock's, but this is definitely different. I'm not sure exactly what the smell is -- stale roasted peanut shells, maybe. But lighter. Yes, I am confused and the beer is right here in front of me.  The taste is interesting. Much lighter than a stout, which is what I was somewhat expecting to taste. Apparently, I should have less preconceived notions. In any event, the taste is not complex. It is straightfoward without much depth, to my palate.  There is little carbonation feel, and the density is light and floaty -- not milky or creamy on the tongue.  I have three more of these in the cellar. I will drink them at some point or trade them with some friends who have a higher apprectiation for this beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,neonbrown82,3.73,"I think this beer is way overrated compared to other Ayinger brews. Looks beautiful, smells good, but the taste seems a bit odd. Maybe everybody just likes the pretty little necklaces on each bottle.  Pours to a dark and hazy nut brown color with a big and fluffy tan colored head. Looks good so far.  Has a very Bavarian aroma to it, if that means anything. A bit of a spicy hop bouqet combined with a grainy malt aroma. Smells quite enticing and refreshing, but the taste seems to let down on the promises of the appearance and smell.  Tastes sweet with a bit of caramel and a slightly roasted bitterness in the finish. I was hoping for more of a yeasty profile in the flavor, but all I seemed to be able to taste were the grains and hops (and a bit of ethanol). No estery or phenolic delights in this unfiltered brew.  The beer has a good body to it, but this can only entice the taste buds so much. Drinkability is average, but can be greatly increased when paired with a meal (I used this beer to marinate my roast last night. It was an expensive choice, but the best I've made so far).",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

S: Strong maltiness through and through. Slight notes of chocolate, with just a whiff of a wine like aroma. No hop aroma.  T: Bliss. Chewy malt flavors dominate. Just a nice maltiness, malts are dark in character. There is a faint spiciness. Hop flavors are almost absent. There's a taste I can't quite place, maybe raisins or plums, not sure but it's nice.  M: Full and chewy in body. Mouthcoating without feeling syrupy. Carbonation is dead on and alcoholic warmth is wonderful.  D&N: Easily one of the finest beers I've ever had the pleasure of drinking.

It showed off a light to moderate amount of carbonation. In the nose I caught scents of dark grape, as well as sweet malts with a bit of an acidic aroma.  Tasting: Malts, malts, malts. That's what you will find in this beer. A sweet, slightly alcohol-tinged flavor hits the front of the tongue, followed by a kick of roasted malt and chocolate-infused grape. This fits the Doppelbock style perfectly, and it was quite pleasant to drink. A medium-bodied beer with relatively low carbonation, its flavors dance across the tongue nicely.  I had this after my college graduation, and its name was very appropriate for the quality of the beer.

Smells very earthy and natural.  This brew grows on you. The first taste is underwhelming. Subsequent tastes unleash a myriad of flavors which are subtle yet so complex. Biscuit like malts and mellow hops linger a bit after drinks, but definitely not an intrusive taste. Very well balanced. Not an in your face brew. Very drinkable, although the mouthfeel is a little resinous and chewy. Delicious. A good session beer in my opinion.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Self-proclaimed as the ""Finest Bavarian Double Bock Beer"" and I would have to agree.  It pours a deep reddish-brown into a pint glass with 1.5 inches of off-white head. The beer has a lovely caramel/toffee smell and just a trace of alcohol can be detected in the nose. The taste is execeptional - toasted hops help to balance out sweet caramel and a full mouthfeel. Though alcohol is present in the nose, it is very well concealed in the taste, as the 6.7% ABV is nowhere to be found.  Dangerously drinkable.

Appearance- Beautiful reddish-copper with a thick, fluffy head. But that's nothing compared to what's about to come...  Smell- This is, simply, my favorite smell in this great big world of beer we live in. Chocolate malted milk shake, molasses, big sweet caramel toffee, fudge cake, malts, malts, malts. The alcohol is masked very well until the beer approaches room temperature, at which time it befriends the malt character.  Taste/Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Liquid caramel toffee malts and molasses, as described above, flow seamlessly over the tongue and finish with an incredibly appropriate bitterness that takes nothing away from the overall sweet story.

Brown with a red tint to it. Tan head, rose about 1 1/2 inches, then settled down to a cover over the liquid. Minimal lacing.  Smell: Mostly roasted malt, burnt malt aroma with a sweetness about it, a little bready.  Taste: Malty profile, toffee and caramel flavors. A little bite at the end, either hops or the alcohol coming through.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, creamy medium to full bodied. Lightly carbonated.  Drinkability: A great beer to sip on and enjoy, savoring it as you go. Its easy enough to drink, but definintely not a session beer.

Bran raisin muffin dough wrapped in a leather case. Spiced cake with cocoa dust. Canned cherry pie topping. A husky voice. Tobacco. Some strong orange pekoe. Burnt walnuts. I could drink this from noon to passing out whenever with a pretzel and mustard.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Very smooth chocolate malt and roasted nut flavor. The smoothness is nicely balanced by a tangy alcohol bite on the tongue. One of the better German exports.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,FLAbeergutinMASS,4.06,"The most striking feature of this beer is its color. Ruby red, but at the same time corduroy brown. Poured evenly, with large bubbles that quickly dissipated. As I am drinking the head remains small and consistent.  This beer comes across as tart, burnt malt, with hints of raisins and the sweetness of grapes.  This beer is a bit of an extension for me. I am wary of beers with shelf-lives of...who knows. This is definitely a sipping beer. I can imagine this going well with a medium rare pork tenderloin. I will try again, but I am not going out of my way for it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,twelvsies,3.95,"I had heard a lot about this beer and never got around to trying it until last night at the Moan and Dove. Good, but not quite what I expected. Nice poofy head on top of a dark brown ale, with bubbles. Smell was really nice; malty and roasty and with a nice milky character. In the taste that milky creamy characteristic was really the only thing that made it stand out. Yeah, the nice roasted toasted chocolaty coffee taste was nice, but nothing I haven't come across before, in a variety of styles. It seemed like this beer didn't really know if it was a brown ale or a dopplebock or a stout. The mouthfeel didn't match up with the taste, it was a little thin and too carbonated in my opinion. This is tasty for sure, but I was expecting something more along the lines of a real dopplebock, like Aventius or something. But then again, everyone else on the site seems to think this stuff is the cream of the crop, so to each his own.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Roderick,4.32,"WOW....this was really good! It poured a VERY dark red with a little tan head and very little carbonation. The smell is what I liked best because of the caramel & chocolate, smelled like the worlds best desert. Taste was sweet (but not to sweet) and creamy with a hint of malt and I guess what would be a medium body I really like this beer and plan on buying it again.(Happy Rookie) I paid $8.99 for 4 bottles..",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,RenoZymurgist,3.73,"Poured a clear, dark red almost black brew, with a tan head that subsided quickly probably due to the alcohol content and low carbonation. The aroma was very indicative of Munich malt and had a touch of roasted grains that was very clean. The flavor is very good for a doppelbock as it begins with a touch of hops blended in with a very rich toasted malt flavor that has a touch of chocolate malt or some other dark malt in the finish. the body is very full and lends a smoothness that is also accented by the lower levels of carbonation. This is a very smooth and tasty dark lager with a nice level of alcohol so that if you only want to drink one beer you can choose one of these and get a nice buzz acompanied with a delicious flavor.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,deejaydan,4.19,"Pours a deep ruby color, with a tightly knit head. Good lacing. Aroma is outstandingly complex, dried fruits, sweet malts and caramel play in there as well. Taste is complex as well, some bitter chocolate play off the malts well to keep a roasted balance to the sweetness. I've got to knock this one on mouthfeel. Slightly thin and overcarbonated for a dopplebock in my mind. Overall, a good drinking beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,asabreed,4.4,"This beer has been hyped up so much to the point of a smile on my face when I bought a 4-pack for around $9. And how badass are those goat charms, too? Numero uno is on a tack on my bulletin board. Hopefully this will be good enough to start a collection.  Appearance: Maybe my glass wasn't cleaned properly, but what looked like a gorgeous head turned out to dissipate rather quickly. Though many have said the head sticks around for a while. Even so, it's a gorgeous color and keeps a thin line of lace around the top of the beer.  Smell: Malts galore, of course. Some burnt wood, some burnt chocolate. Smoke aromas. Faint honey and lots of caramel. Slight raisins. Some cherries. Some figs. A faint aroma of plums. Complex and fantastic.  Taste: Absolutely love the aftertaste, for one. The smokiness comes through mostly in the taste, but it's balanced quite well. Raisins and the woodiness come through well also. Aftertaste is lingering malt, yeast, and sweetness, and it's awesome.  Mouthfeel: Rich and creamy. Light carbonation, medium-bodied. Pretty great.  Drinkability: I wish I could have this with some great food, but now it's kind of a dessert treat, which is also delicious. Doppelbock's for me are a treat, especially after I learned a think or two, so the drinkability certainly shouldn't be beyond a 4 in my opinion. But goddamn, this aftertaste is amazing, and I'll keep saying that.  As I'm still drinking, I feel like I could have cases and cases of this stuff and be happy. Curious to see what a year does in the cellar; much potential is here for it age pretty well, though I imagine not beyond a year or two, but who knows? Definitely give this a shot, Doppelbock fan or not; as I stated earlier, a 4-pack won't break the wallet, and this stuff's a real treat. Thankfully I can buy 4-pack's readily available, as this will surely become a staple for me.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Dark ruby-copper in color with a gorgeous billowing beige head that stuck around for the whole show!  Scent: Fig Newtons!  Flavors of dark, caramel & roasted malts...malt for days. Perfect balance of dry, tingly hops that keeps this malt arsenal from becoming cloying. Long, lush fininsh.  One of the creamiest mouthfeels I've ever experienced of any lager (and most ales) nI've tried. Full bodied with just enough carbonation to keep things from bogging down.  Drinkability is great, given the high gravity and overall giganticness of the ale.  This is THE standard which all other dopplebocks should be judged. The world is a far better place with this beer in it. Sensational offering from a stellar brewery!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Aroma is a deceivingly light meld of subtle grain and easy malt. Taste is just uber-freakin-liceous. Chewy malt, chocolate, molassesbeautimus, just beautimus. Creamy mouthfeel and subtle smoky/roasted finish calls to megently reminding me of the beauty that is beer.

Maroon streaks when held up to the light. Nice. Huge caramel malt nose with hints of chocolate and dark fruits. I get some cherry/raspberry in there as well. A bit burnt with a nice sweetness. Good lacing on the glass to boot!  First sip is a big, thick caramel, cocoa maltiness. I get some hints of raisins, molasses and some dark fruits. A nice sweet body that only shows a hint of bitterness on the way down. Burnt, roasty, a bit nutty. Quite a tasty, malty brew.  Mouthfeel has a big, creamy body that makes its presence known. Smooth and easy to drink. I could see a four pack night of Celebrator no problem. Just a damn fine doppelbock and a testament to malt.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,SupaCelt,3.73,"This little number spreads itself into a nice cranberry jelly coloured darkness that looks almost like grape juice when held up to the desk light. The head rioted over the borders of the glass. Very good looking flow.  The smell summons up thoughts of molasses and caramels. There is certainly a sun dried fruit element to this. Like a shrivled raisin smell, or mashed prune, or something weird. Some goofy purple fruity thing, hell maybe even eggplant. There are surely some chocolate sheets in the breeze. Malty; roasty. Jeepers this thing has alot of odoriferous eminations to it. I think the smell might be taking me over as I review this one.  The taste is just as cumbersome to analyze. There are so many layers in here that it is almost confusing. You get the bitter chocolate thing at first. Then the sweetness shows itself. The weird purple fruit rind taste creeps up at the end. Other suggestions assert themselves randomly into the flavour atmosphere. Each sip poses another question. The end is a fruit juice finish minus the sugary sweetness. Unique is about how I can describe this one. Mouthfeel is fairly thick, just shy of a ""syrupy"" designation. Drinkability is a non issue. There is no way I could handle the mental aspect of more of these after this one. I really can't tell what it is trying to say.  This brew is alright. I may be persuaded to try this one again. I would prefer to have something else if I had my 'druthers though. Nice goat. Fine beer. No tremendous fuss. Tastes a bit rotten.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Molasses, sweet breads and yeast. Fruits: prunes and plums.  Very malty, roasty and smokey. Diacetyl esters (toffee and caramel). Hops are very nice. More molasses vibe.  At once creamy and smooth, dry and astringent.  This one went down terribly fast. Not intentionally--I was going to have it with sauerbrauten but it was gone before the food was ready. Lived up to the hype, worth the price. Neat little plastic goat there too.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Caramel malts and just enough subtle hop presence to provide a good balance and nice flavor, improving as it warms, and becoming much more flavorful. Moderate ABV and a flavor that is by no means overwhelming make this a pretty good session beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Tastes much the same as the smell, with a clean malty finish. This could be a good after dinner drink. Nice mouthfeel: not too heavy,but I would like just a little more hop.

There are a few other world class doppelbocks (Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel and Weihenstephaner Korbinian are two that come to mind), but Celebrator gets the nod here for its unmatched smooth finish. Exceptionally clean and smooth. Dark, roasted malt is the star of the show, but there is also a fruity aspect to it that will take you to places you previously thought only ales could go. Not to mention, each bottle comes with a billy goat ornament strung around its neck. How cool is that?  One of my favorite beers in the world.  -----  Original rating 4.48/5 on 2/1/2005.  On-tap @ Anam Cara in Brookline, MA.  Wow, what a treat to find this one on-tap! Props to AC.  Served in it's proper Celebrator glass, it was dark-brown colored. The head had great retention all the way through its short lifespan. Nothing too crazy going on with the aroma, just a nice, enjoyable nutty scent. Great nutty, roasted malt flavor as well. Nice and smooth on the palate. Exceptional drinkability. I couldn't believe how fast I was drinking it, but I couldn't stop!  What more can be said about this brew that hasn't been said already?

Taste is sweet as well, with some caramel flavors coming through, as well as a small amount of bitterness. There's also chocolate flavors, which is quite nice. Mouthfeel is very full, almost creamy. In fact, that's the best thing about this beer.  While I'm not generally a fan of doppelbocks, I really like this one. Very warming on a cold winter's night.

Smells wonderfully complex.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The focus of this beer is the malts. And that's a good thing. The hops present themselves well and round off this beer, but the malts are so complex and flavorful. Caramel, molasses, wheat bread, and so much more come time mind. The mouthfeel is thin but suprisingly creamy.  Drinkability and Overall: I've been waiting to try this for a while, finally got to, and I have to say it met and surpassed my expectations.

Aroma is roasty sweet molassas and brandied/candied cherries, rich- just begging me to drink it. There is some unidentified complexity (yeast?) that gives it a bit of added tartness (maybe weak hop notes, but not certain). Flavor is toffee & coffee that is incredibly well balanced- bready sweet with light shaprness at the end of the swallow. A great dessert, even though it's not all sweetness. Mouthfeel lush and rich.

Toasty, slightly chocolatey (or perhaps molasses-like is a better desc). A little dry raisin flavor is also present. Hops are not detectable at all. Finish is sweet, but fairly clean.

When this showed fresh at Anam Cara today, I didnt hesitate to order, and I was not disappointed. Deep brown to black color with ruby highlights and a thin tan head. Wonderful roast malt aroma with mild chocolate and caramel hints. A candy lovers dream! The light roast aroma develops into a milder roast flavor with an amazing sweetness and a mild alcohol warming.

Presentation- 11.2 oz bottle with a cool mountain goat hanging from the bottle. A notched bottled date or expiration that I don't understand. Poured into my Chouffe tulip glass.  Appearance- Pours an almost black or at least dark brown color. Nice sticky head and nice lacing.  Smell- Sweet and sugary. Maybe a brown sugar scent. Molasses and maybe even really sweet milk chocolate.  Taste- Sweet malty goodness. Definite molasses swirling around everywhere. A high amount of hop bitterness as well.  Mouthfeel- A bit too carbonated IMO, but other than that it's a nice full beer that goes down well.  Drinkability- One of my first bocks that I decided to drink at the turn of the year.

Salvator may be the original, but Celebrator exceeds it in most respects -- despite the cheesy bock trinket that comes with each 12oz bottle. Poured a clear almost ruby color into the glass, and displayed a good full head that quickly dissipated. Smelled crisp and almost molasses like. First sips had a hint of biscuit. As it warmed, I detected more honey and raisins. Conspicuously absent was the strong alcohol taste of other doppelbocks. This is Celebrator's strength.

Undistinguished 33cl brown bottle with a very busy multi-colored label featuring two goats dancing around a glass of the good stuff. Other than ABV, no relevant or useful information to be found.  Pours a dark but clear burgundy under a one finger beige head that is fairly thin and short-lived, leaving no lace. Decadently strong caramel malt nose with a bit of dark fruit - plum or red grape, perhaps. The mouth is very prickly, yet heavy - great feel. The taste is malt, malt, malt - sweet and heavy. Alcohol is also present, as is a definite plum strain. Nicely blended, smooth as silk, there is just a touch of hops adding a bit of dry bite in the finish, lingering as a bitter echo among the sweet malt aftertaste.

Damn, I have great memories of this beer from when it was available at the place a couple of miles from the house... and it is excellent in cooking, I must add. The best dark beer I have found for recipes.  The aroma was of dark malts and figs, with a light sweetness, and a hint of alcohol ALMOST out of reach. A little fruitier than I remember.  The taste was slightly sweet, with definite fruity malt character. Figs and raisins predominated. A hint of caramel was there as well, along with a touch of alcohol warmth and a bit of roastiness on the aftertaste.  I remembered it better than this...

Smell - The malt aroma is so strong that I can smell it three feet away. Unreal. When I hold the beer to my nose, the aroma is overpowering. Hop aroma absent.  Taste - The taste is very rich and malty, but very smooth. Hop flavor absent. Alcoholic warmth comes out in the aftertaste. Outstanding.  Mouthfeel - With the thick and rich taste comes a thick-feeling beer. The beer is silky smooth.  Drinkability - The relatively high percent of alcohol of this beer is not hidden, and the beer packs a bit of a wallop. I would also describe the beer as ""filling."" A couple of these and I would be done for the night. The style's nickname as ""liquid bread"" is well deserved.  Comments - I'm no beer judge, but I think this is an excellent example of the style.

39,131,sacfly,4.05,Pours a dark brown color with a frothy brown/tan head. Smell is malty and sweet with just a hint of basement smell. Smooth full body. Tastes just like it smells- only stronger. Very enjoyable. Just the right amount of ABV for this beer. Alcohol is not noticeable at 6.7%. Would defiantly enjoy having more of these!,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,newyawker,4.45,"I think this is the first German Double Bock I have ever tried, but it won't be my last now that I know what this nectar is like. Comes in a very nice bottle with a little plastic ram charm hanging around the neck. Pours very dark brown with a tan, foamy head. Smells a bit like a cappucino and a bit like a dank cellar. Interesting. The taste is really smooth. Kind of full flavored, almost creamy with a bit of roasted coffee on my tounge. Also some chocolate flavors, and a sweet molasses finish, but not overly sweet. Very easy to drink, and it is a little strong. Great beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,flaminghomer,4.3,this is the first time that i've had a real german double bock. it tastes better than other bock's i've had. it doesn't have much of a head and little lacing. it's pretty damn dark. good malt taste. not too sweet at all. and not too much alcohol taste. a very good beer. and very drinkable. highly recommended. plus the bottle is cool as hell.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,crookedhalo,4.25,"Pours a deep cola brown color with a nice, light brown colored head. Bready, grainy aromas, some dark caramel and molasses-type aromas with a light fruitiness, too. Mostly a malty assault on the palate, molasses and treacle comes through pretty nicely. There's some hops in there, too, just overpowered with the malt. A little bit vinous and lightly astringent, helping to balance the deep, dark malt assault. I haven't had a Celebrator in about 10 months, and, maybe it's the right time of year now that it's getting chilly, but it is just hitting the spot. It's a slow sipper that seems to develop finer characteristics as it warms. Nice velvety mouthfeel. Some might say this is too roasty for a traditional doppelbock. I think it is quite righteous for the style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Pours murky brown, reveals deep fire crimson when held up to the light. medium tan head reducing to nice lace. light malt in the aroma, but not much more. Perhaps I should let it warm some, but I just can't wait. Medium creamy mouthful, carbonation on the higher side. Taste is all at once sweet, chocolate, smoke, spicy. Lots going on here. Long, long lasting finish of roasted, smoked, pepper spice lip smackin' malt. Very satisfying.  Really looking forward to sipping one by the fire on a long cold winter night.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,blitheringidiot,4.35,"Label Lore: Describing this Privat Brauerei Franz Inselkammer bottle would be like describing Santa Clause to a five year old. But lets give it up to Merchant du Vin for importing this. 6,7 ABV.  Dark mahogany yet clear pour with a few errant bubbles escape with an impressive huge rock solid cake like khaki head that just wont quit.  Walnut malt scents dominate the nose with plenty of mixed spices that confound. Nutmeg, carrot cake. Becomes a bit estery when warmed up towards the end.  First Swigs: Vinous port wine hints and honey malts. Maple syrup and sweet sugary flavors swirl around. This one makes me ruminate. A bit of porter toffee and deep rich refined caramel malts. Lingering chocolate and coffee ice cream aftertaste.  Like drinking Birch Beer at a Summer picnic.  Last Swigs: Liquid chocolate and maple syrup. You could pour this on ice cream. This is the sole offering by this brewery. An example of do one thing, and do it well. Reminds me of Sam Adams Chocolate Bock except for $3 a 11.2 oz 330 mL instead of $18 for a SA bomber. Review # 397. Don't wait til Spring to enjoy this Bock.  Beer is good. Happy bock beering.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,mynie,4.53,"Pours pretty as can be. Great head, great blackness with ruby shining through. Absolutely killer bottle.  Smells spicey and sweetly of malt along with a hint of a alcohol. Molasses and bread. Complex and brilliant.  Very strong malt flavor. Bittersweet: roasted grain and almonds. More malt in the back with just a bit of alcohol in the follow through. A sweet aftertaste, very nutty. Molasses all around.  Sensational body. Goes down alright, but these taste awful rich and it would be hard to drink more than a couple in a sitting--no matter how much you might want to.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Biffster,4.35,"The beer pours with a tawny head. It is deep mahogony brown with copper and ruby highlights.  The aroma is intensely malty, with strong bready aromas. Raisin and caramel aromas follow, with a hint of cocoa behind. No hops, esters, or other off aromas present themselves, but there is the barest hint of diacetyl.  There is plenty of malty sweetness at the sip, a bit of hop flavor and a complex warming finish. As the sample warms, a complex, vinous and somewhat spicy flavor emerges, with strong hints of dark ripe fruit. Plenty of raisin and plum flavors emerge. There is caramel and chocolate in the smooth warming finish.  The mouthfeel is big. There is a medium/full body with medium carbonation and a pleasant warming with no astringency.  Overall, this is one of the most pleasant and balanced versions of a big and challenging style that I have ever tasted.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smell: Smells very rich, fruity, chocolately and malty.  Taste: Delicious & complex. Strong fruits, roasted malts, toffee, chocolate..you name it, you can probably taste it. Carbonation is perfect..not too much, not too little. Toasted malts and creamy flavor, with a long finish.  Mouthfeel: Extremely smooth & creamy mouthfeel. The alcohol kicks in right at the end and the sweet aftertaste ends perfectly.  Drinkability: Overall, a great Doppelbock. Very flavorful and relatively easy to drink. The nearly 7% ABV is also a nice touch.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Amdahl,4.6,"Beer is in a simple yet elegant bottle. Label has 2 rams on it for a classic touch. The beer pours to almost black with just a touch of red in it. There are nearly 3 fingers of head that slowly goes back to a thin layer. There is no lace left on the side of the glass. The aroma is very complex with the malt hitting the nose the hardest with a emphasis on a sweetness. This beer is one of the best tasting doppelbocks that I have ever tried. The taste is very malty and sweet, with the fruits coming though in abundance. This is a full bodied beer.

Notes: A very nice malty beer that I enjoyed a lot. A good example of the dopplebock style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,trumick,4.47,Pours a deep brown color with little head and no lacing.  Scent is of sweet dark roasted malts and spices with some dark fruit.  Taste follows the nose sweet dark malts with dried fruits nutty overtones and just enough bitterness to override the sweet.  Mouthfeel is full bodied smooth and velvety with just the right amount of carbination.  The drinkability is great I could sit with a bunch of these. What a nice beer. I am totally impressed with this one.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,TongoRad,5,"Translucent saturated brown color with a thick tan head.  Aroma is rich, malty and complex with some spicyness and some dried fruit qualities but still solidly in lager territory. The effect almost comes across like a cross between dark bread and a holiday cake.  Flavor is amazing- it follows through on the nose and adds new layers of complexity- some molasses and just the right amount of bitterness to prevent cloying.  As close to perfection as you'll find.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A sweetened, toasted malt aroma; molasses, dates, and other nut-like tones.  Toasted malts, dates, almonds; given the aroma and array of flavors for the style the sweetness is surprisingly subdued and very palatable. Well rounded and full of flavor.  Full bodied; Very smooth, coats the palate well. Unobtrusive.  Very easy drinking and a pleasure to drink. A must have in anyone's collection.

39,131,abcsofbeer,4.7,"MMM, good. Excellent double bock. Pours a very dark, brownish color with reddish amber around the edges. I poured this one pretty fast and came up with a 2 inch head that was light brown and frothy. The lace is very abundant from top to bottom.  The aroma is very malty with a nutty undertone. Also hints of toffee or sweet coffee.  The taste is excellent, also malty, nutty and sweet caramel. The aftertaste is definitely coffee tasting and slightly alcoholic and also very malty. This is the champion of double bocks in my opinion.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,rugger,4.3,"I love the bottle with the goats. I can't wait until I put up my little beer christmas tree so I can hang the goats on it. Anyway back to the beer. The color is a dark ruby color and the head came out with a nice thickness that went away and the lacing is very sparce to almost none. The smell is very malty with a hint of toffee. The taste has lots of malt with hints of toffee, figs, chocolate and probably several other things. The mouthfeel is nice as the malt seems to stick to your tounge and leaves a very pleasant aftertaste. I really enjoy this beer and I could enjoy lots of it if I had it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ybnorml,4.12,A dark brown beer with garnet highlights. Not much a light brown head is evident. There is a very inviting sweet malty and molasses aroma with a hint of alcohol.

39,131,winomark,3.9,"Dark brown wiht a reddish/maroon hue. Small, but persistant light tan head. Roasted malt, chocolate, and some sweet alchohol tones. Mild sweetness upfront, with good malty richness and an slightly dry and bitter palate. Similar to a sweet coffee. Flavorful and coating mouthfeel, but not too heavy. Overall, a delightful beer. This is one of the first beer that turned me on to ""good"" beer over a decade ago. Recommended.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ngandhi,4.15,"Luscious toffee-laden malt. Dark, extracted berry. Striking, structured acidity. Deep malt that quickly yields to a sweeping, anisette hoppiness. Herbal and noble, the hops are far more complex than in any other doppelbock. This interaction is, at times, unusual and off-putting, but always conducted into balanced by a long finish, where the malts boldly re-emerge.  Relax, relax. ng",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,canucklehead,4.37,"We use to get this beer in BC and it is a shame it no longer available as this has to be one of my top 3 German beers. The nose is huge with yeasty, malty notes dipped in treacle. What really struck me tasting this beer after a gap of 3 years is the bigness of flavours. Lots of malt with just the right amount of sweetness. A true classic.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,pootz,4.77,"Something special from Brooklynboy for my 200th reviewthanks very much Ed you are a priest of the yeast. I have anticipated savoring a Celebrator for some time. This bottled version is pasteurized I suspect but it still does not detract from this beers reputation. The pour revealed a deep mahogany- red liquid with a 2 finger rocky mocha cap that reduces in its own sweet time to a lasting sticky lacemild to medium carbonation. Wow what a bouquet of malts!! We have dried fruits, licorice, molasses, tangerines and a lovely musty, earthy over tone. The start is all big tasty malts with a dozen different malt/roast/hop/yeast departures that are so complex they escape my eloquence to enunciate thema veritable orgasm of the taste buds. Rich mouth feel without being heavy or sweet...fantastic balance for a dopple bock.finish is medium with the toffee chocolate tastes receding and the hops creating a wet lasting impression of treacle and limethen a nice warming.infinitely the best drinkable dopple bock in the world.Ed thanksand more please!!!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,oxmasterscream,4.85,"Poured a dark brown with ruby highlights - very clear but nearly opaque. Its color was beautiful. The craterous 2 finger head broke down very quickly. The aroma was nice - sweet, dark roasted malts, dark ripe fruits like raisins and cherries, cola, and the biggest aroma of all... sticky buns. I loved it. Taste was sweet and tangy with a subtle coffee-like bitterness at the finish. Beautiful raisiny and molasses flavors in there. Sweet, heavy, and bread-like. Exactly how a dopplebock should taste. Mouthfeel was great... silky smooth, velvety, with an easy-going carbonation. The quintessential dopplebock indeed.  (Note: My original review has since been edited. Something must've been up with my taste buds or bottle I had the first time around. Due to a recent tasting of a certainly fresh bottle, I've had to re-rate this beer accordingly.)",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Phyl21ca,4.08,"Bottle: Poured a dark black beer with a huge foamy off-white head with excellent retention. I think I can smell vanilla and/or banana with some roasted malts. Taste is quite sweet at first with the banana/vanilla side coming out and then ends with a more alcoholic sweetness at the end (still cannot feel the alcohol thought). Very good, probably the best example of this style that I know of.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BrewMaster,4.1,"Pours with a thin head. As it warms the aroma pours out and it is a sweet and supple aroma. The taste is clean and tangy, medium body, with hints of caramel. It is very smooth in the mouth and quite drinkable. The sweet notes make it a great doppelbock. No overbearing alcohol taste to speak of. Very well done.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Beastdog75,4.18,"Celebrator Doppelbock is truly one of the best doppelbocks available. I've been disappointed by highly touted brews before, and I thought that Celebrator was going to follow that same trend. I will admit that I was glad to be wrong, and that this brew definitely stands out amongst its doppelbock brethren.  Celebrator pours a very dark brown color with some ruby hints visible in the right lighting. A finger of tan foam forms and lasts for about 1 minute. The aroma was nice, but a bit typical of doppelbocks. Just some average ""dark malt"" scents, which included some roasted notes, caramel, and light chocolate in the nose. Nice, but not groundbreaking. The mouthfeel was something to behold. This was a rich beer, yet so easy to drink. It slides across the tongue in a velvety fashion that is so soft yet invigorating. There are a myriad of ""dark"" flavors here. The notes of caramel, chocolate, dark roasted coffee, burnt grains, ""dark fruits"" (such as plum, black cherry) make this a liquified Black Forest in a bottle. Quite sweet as well, as I didn't notice any dryness or bitterness worth mentioning here (just a tiny bit of ""roasted bitterness""). The aftertaste has a nutty flavor to it, along with some more (albeit light) burnt notes. I expected this to be an alcohol monster, but there is only some alcoholic warmth to end this one. Quite deceptive!  I usually consider myself to be a bit tough on reviewing highly recommended beers, but this one is worthy of the hype. Go buy a bottle today, drink it and save the goat figurine so that when you look at it, you can remember your first ""celebration."" In summary: top of the line doppelbock all the way.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,PorterLambic,4.4,"This wonderful beer pours out a deep ruby red with a big head that disappears almost completely in 2 minutes. Smell sweet, malty, with scents of plums and raspberry (or maybe cherry) in the background. Taste is delicious. Roasted malt, licorice, coffee, chocolate, wonderfully complex. A smooth, full-bodied brew without any cloying aftertaste or bitterness. Very drinkable, although the perceived alcohol content might slow you down more than the actual ABV. I like doppelbocks and this is a fine example.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,meathookjones,4.33,"You have to love the goat toy trinkets around the neck of the bottles. I should find some use for them, as my collection is growing quite large. This pours of a pitch-black color with a tall bubbly beige head that leaved sheets of lacing around the glass that stick for a while. Very full and complex aroma is rising from the glass with roasted malts, dark chocolate mixing around with a strong ripe dark fruit scent. The taste starts of with a roasted smoky flavor that is back by fruits, caramel and chocolate. Behind that is a touch of coffee and a slightly bittering finish that completes this wonderful flavor. Excellent mouth feel as this is full, creamy and smooth not too much more can be asked from a brew like this. Very good drinkability as its complex flavor and scent keep you coming back for more to discover new elements in it. Highly recommended to all and hey if you dont like it you get a neat goat for a parting gift.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,malthead,4.18,"Practically black beer, with a nice beige, cratering head. Smell is sweetly malty, with a little cocoa and caramel, almost like a stout. Taste is absolutely wonderful... dark, lots of malt, nothing too overpowering, but there's some caramel/toffee, a little cocoa, and a definite hop presence, just a little spiciness to lighten it up, and a little sharp astringent malt towards the finish. Great mouthfeel, smooth and creamy. This glass is empty far too quickly, but I've docked drinkability because I think one or two is the limit - even without the slightly higher ABV, it's just not something that even a lover of dark, malty beers like I am would want to drink all night.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,GnomeKing,4.92,"This brew perked to attention in my chalice glass, foaming into a large head of medium-sized bubbles. The color was deep brown with a little red when looking down into the glass, and black/brown when looking at it from the side.  The smell is strong and enchanting, a siren call to drink the beer. There were strong aromas of caramel and chocolate, among other scents, that promised a strong malt character in the beer.  The taste is rich and hearty, with caramel being most noticeable in the early swigs, then chocolate coming through strongly at the bottom of my chalice glass. By the end, there were also some hints of, could it be, grapes and strawberries? Along the way toward finishing this magnificent beer, there were also hints of coffee and devil's food cake. Yeah, and black licorice too. And maybe even nuts. All the tastes were blended perfectly.  It is a good world, that has Celebrator in it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,nogoodreason,4.67,"Man, this is one good beer.  Appearance: Deep brownish red. Very dark, beautiful. A fairly large head forms, but disapears as you drink.  Smell: Rich, creamy and malty. Maybe a little bit of cookie dough?  Taste: What can I say? It's beautiful. Sweet but not overly so. A chocolatey, creamy taste is the first thing you get. Beneath that there is a wonderful bready/doughy flavor and hints of some dark fruit. Sweeter by far than the beers I typically drink, but somehow it's balanced. Very faint hop and alcohol bite. Finish is very long, with that chocolatey creamy malty taste just resting on your tounge.  Mouthfeel: Not too thick, but pretty viscous. Good carbonation, but it maintains the creamy aspects of it's flavor.  Drinkability: Two of these were gone before I had a chance to notice it. This is one damned drinkable beer, though it's a little heavy to drink several.   Final note: I am absolutely wild about this beer.In fact, I'm so crazy about this beer that I can't tell if I'm objective in rating it. It's one of the best I've tasted, no kidding. For all the talk of creamyness and sweetness, at it's core this is a highly balanced brew. The brewers at Ayinger are true craftsmen. This is a work of art.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Drinkability is very good goes down quick and easy. A malty fine beer personaly I lean to the hoppy side of the force but this is one fine brew.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,wyllder,3.98,"Pours a clear, deep caramel with ruby hilights and a good 3/4 inch tan head. Has a nice guinness-like effect on the pour. Very pretty to look at.  Nose is roasted malts and caramel with a slightly candied, fruity edge.  Intro onto the palate is ever so slightly bitter before the malt kicks in to mellow it out. There's also a tad too much carbonation that takes a moment to back off before the malt has a chance to make itself know. Is slightly astringent on the front of the palate, leaving a tartness on the front of the tongue after it's gone. Aftertaste is smooth caramel malt with a little espresso lurking behind it.  Mouthfeel is smooth & creamy but just a wee bit too astringent & carbonated for my liking. Creates a little more tartness than I would have liked.  A solid drinker, I don't think I'll have any complaints about having to finish the 4-pack I picked up.  Overall, a good offering. In my opinion it doesn't quite measure up to the TH-Liberator, but it's not bad at all.  Wyll-",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The head is large, but quickly recedes, but a smooth lace remains. The smell is that of molasses, and a bit of malt. The roasted malt is particularly evident in the taste. I get almost a chocalate taste from the residual sugars. As great as the taste is, the mouthfeel is even more impressive. This is a very full-bodied beer, but it is so smooth that it goes down nice and easy. The creaminess is overwhelming. This is, in my book, a top ten beer, and it's reputation is completely deserved.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smell: Notes of dark malts along with an array of fruits. One can also smell slight alcohol with an almost vinous tone in the finish.  Taste: This beer hits the pallate with nice malt tones. Biscuit, caramel, and a slight chocolate flavor which compete with a large fruity balance that brings out figs and raisins. There is a winey sweet, brown sugary sweet and fruity flavor to this brew. and alcohol taste at the end. Very well rounded for an enjoyable doppelbock.  Mouthfeel: This beer is chewy and has a nice medium body. Totally a treat for the mouth.  Drinkability: A solid beer which hides its alcohol beneath great malt characteristics. Super smooth",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smell: Molasses mingled with dark malts and a rather leafy hop character. Hops provide the beer with a nice bitterness.  Taste: Exceptionally creamy and smooth. Bready malts with elements of fruit and coffee. The finish is rather sweet and lingering.  Overall: If you can find a Doppelbock that beats this one, let me know. This is a simply amazing brew to say the very least. World-class.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,watermelonman,4.55,"Deep, dark, malted, powerful, and very balanced. This is quite a beer.  It looks mostly like plain darkness. Small amounts of red and brown poke through at times. There's a small head that lasts well. It left a really nice lace web of lace.  There's a touch of carmel on top of a lot of dark and hefty malts. The mouthfeel is very solid and pleasing, and it's still easy to drink. It comes through strong and stays that way, but the strength does not detract. It's good in all ways.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,paulie,4.65,"Pours extremely dark but crystal clear -- a red so dark that it is almost purple. Big stiff dark head slowly fades to leave lace all over the glass. The nose is all caramel and malt but without any candy sweetness. Full, velvety mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to make it rich instead of heavy. The flavor is all malt: caramel notes and just a hint of roastiness and a smooth, rounded sweetness. Does not cut you in the back of the throat like some doppelbocks -- very smooth as it goes down. Perfectly balanced bitterness in the finish to cut the sweetness and prevent it from being cloying. Too filling to be a ""regular"", but very close to being heaven in a bottle.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,WetCoaster,3.78,"Appearance: Deep mahogany with a mottled tan/off-white head. The head is thick and rocky, but has only fair retention and very little lacing. The carbonation appears fine and mild.  Smell: Somewhat mild. Starts with a malty combo of dark fruit, molasses and caramel. Hints of cardboard. Some flowery/apple yeast esters.  Taste/Mouthfeel: A nice blend of sweet and smoke, with strong malt, burnt sugar, caramel and cola flavors, although it's not nearly as sweet as I might have expected. The finish is dry and bitter with hints of tobacco smoke. A sweetness lingers long into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is surprisingly macro, with sharp carbonation and a fairly light body.  Drinkability: Good; it's flavorful, pleasant and fairly light bodied, especially for a 6.7% ABV brew.  Tasty, but not exceptional or unique. I wouldn't refuse another, but I wouldn't seek one out, either.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,beerinator,3.72,"Appearance: Dark Brown, almost black. Tannish dark tan head with small bubbles assisting with the decent retention.  Aroma: Front notes of coffee. Caramel roasty almonds make their presence known as well. Very very pleasant aroma.  Taste: Heavy malt up front. The alcohol content is noted in the flavors. Mouthfeel isn't as full as I expected from the smell. Nutty. Taste is a bit mocha-ish.  Notes: Expensively enjoyable beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Soybomb,4.51,"Appearance: Looks great, a dark sort of cola brown with a long lasting head.  Smell: Has an easily detectable aroma, but it was mostly alcohol, with some spices to me.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Sweet and malty flavor with a little detectable alcohol. Doesn't finish much different than it starts. Low carbonation, but medium mouthfeel. Some spices and sweetness are there but particular flavors are difficult to pick out.  Notes: My first doppelbock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,irishmoss,4.83,"I had my very first dopplebock a couple of days ago and was impressed: I had my second one today and was completely blown away. When I first poured this into the glass it had a typical brown to dark brown body with an immensely dense light brown that sticks around to the very end. But when I held this up to the light it was actually deep rich mahogany/garnet color, beautiful. The smell was sweet dark fruits and roasted malts; molasses and brown sugar were also very prevalent. Pretty huge taste of sweet malts to start that give way to a roasted flavor, and then there's actually some bitterness from the hops. Velvety smooth mouthfeel that just rolls around my mouth with a silky creaminess that's just enticing me to take another sip. Highly drinkable, great from pour to last drop and leaves me wanting more and after that, a little more.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,andyo,4.12,"Tried this for the first time tonight after eyeing this beer for months. The store around the corner from me has this stocked all the time, and I have always been curious about this beer. After seeing it in the BA top 50, I thought it was high time to try this beer.  Poured a dark hazelnut brown with a nice two-fingered pillowed head. This head was extraordinary, but soon dissapated, leaving traces along the glass as I drank.  The smell ofthis beer is very strong to me, and the initial taste provided some fruit, licorice, and nutty flavors, with a bite, followed by a strong alcohol aftertaste. This beer got more mellow as I drank it. This is a big beer. I have only had one or two dopplebocks in the last few years, so I really don't know how to intelligently review this. Every review I have read has stated that this is a good beer, and I would agree. A great beer with lots of flavor, though I would be hard pressed to drink more than a few in a sitting.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,chugamugofsud,4.4,"This doppelbock pours darker than any of its famous counterparts (Paulaner Salvator, Bell's Consecrator, etc...). It's color is a deep tan with a slight hint of burgandy, although the deep tan obscures most of that shade until the bottom of the glass. There is little head; however, there are creamy hints at the top of the glass. The smell is sweet malt with a little bit of chocolate/fruit sugar. Upon first taste, the beer seems exceptionally smooth and consistent despite having a nice thickness and depth. The drinkability is outstanding considering the depth, actually, I had two of these without feeling cottonmouthed. This beer is an excellent doppelbock, I'm left wondering if it can be topped I also had a glass of it on tap at Tornado's in San Fran.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,DPMomutant,4.2,"Big old 3-finger tan head on this one. The body is a very dark, basically opaque brown. Maybe a touch, and I mean a touch, lighter than the darker stouts. The head is creamy and lasts a while and laces well.  The smell is not quite as strong as I was expecting. It is a nice aroma of sweet toasted malt. With another whiff I find it fruity as well.  The taste is lively, but subtle. Fruity with a roasted (almost but not quite stout) taste.  The mouthfeel is heavy, but in a good way. A very warming finish, almost not appropriate for late spring in the midwest, but good as the night is getting later. Nice balanced carbonation.  This is one that gets down pretty easy, but may be too heavy for more than, say, two of these. Very drinkable as dopplebocks go.  I think this is the top of the BA top 50 I've had. Not quite my favorite but very worthy of a good position in my top 50.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,JamesBerry,4.32,"This double bock is colored a deep cola-like brown which borders on a nearly opaque black. Its head is thin, yet consistent and with good retention. A thick malty-sweet aroma blossoms from the top, reminiscent of a porter or stout. However, unlike a porter or stout, this beer has a slimmer body, at once refreshing and filling. The taste hints at smoke and brazil nuts (or is it coffee?), and is, in a word, deep. As for its drinkability, I could see myself enjoying one or two of these, but I find it hard to picture someone putting down more than a few bottles in an evening.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,kegerator,4.8,"poured out basically black, with a decent head. smelled great, fruity, malty a slight hint of some spice but quite muted taste was just outstanding, smooth sweetness that lingered very well on the tongue with a malty backdrop and some fruit came out in the middle. mouthfeel was very nice some fizz but very smooth and somewhat creamy. very drinkable in my opinion.

Pours a nice thick looking very dark brown--reddish when held up to light, with a nice tan head. A rich aroma of fruit (plums, prunes?), and spice. Tastes a bit of coffee and again has some fruit tones (raisons, prunes??) with some bitter hops in the finsih. Sweet and malty. Not a particularly smooth beer and a bit thin in the mouth. An alright beer, although I was a bit disappointed by it--I like Salvator very much and was expecting to really enjoy this as well, and while its still pretty good, I was not blown away.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BadBadger,4.9,"An absolutely amazing doppelbock. Actually an amazing beer of any style. Pours a very deep and dark color-I guess mahogany would be the descriptor. Nearly opaque. Nice brown head stays present all the way done. Smells great. Tastes malty, sweet. Sweetness is not overwhelming. There is something dancing on the taste buds? Very pleasurable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,rdrummer,4.55,"Even though I have seen this on the shelf and knew it was highly rated on the site, I hesitated to buy the beer, because of the dumb plastic goat hung around the bottles. That was a bad decision.  The beer pours a very dark, mahogany color with a tannish head that is very long lasting. There is some substantial lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is great with a big malty smell and some hints of caramel and herbs.  The taste is the thing here, though. It is huge flavor of malt with a real sweetness hidden in it. There is also a hit of hops and yeast and an alcohol kick at the end.  This is incredible in the mouth. It is so creamy and smooth but it has a carbonated bubble to it as well. It is almost thick. I think that this may be the best German beer that I've ever had in a bottle. It is certainly the best Doppelbock.  I've actually come to like the little goat toy.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,coasterfreak75,4.4,"The pour was deep mahogany/red with a creamy beige one and one half inch head. The head quickly dissapated to a beige lace that coated the top of the beer throughout the drink.  The smell was very fruity and sweet. It had very strong raisin and fig quality.  The taste only carried the smell to the mouth, it was just the same. I really liked the fact that even though it was sweet, it didn't linger in the mouth too long.  Even with the fact that it was heavy as a ton of bricks, it was quite tasty and refreshing. I will try to find this beer again!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Trentonator,4.84,"Pours a deep chocolatey brown, almost black, wth a nice, creamy eggshell white head. Lacing is incredible. Smell is exquisite-lots of cherry, chocolate, toffee, coffee, and smoky richness. Taste is smooth, easy and surprisingly light for a doppelbock. I had this in a wide mouthed glass, I highly recommend this type of glass to fully appreciate the aroma and bouquet (can you say that about a beer?). Seriously, the smell of this beer is out of this world. Taste is top notch. I love this beer, and can't believe I haven't tried it before, I guess I was afraid of a dark German beer. Don't fear the doppelbock . . . .",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,PatandDavid,4.03,"Hmm, I don't think I was as bowled over as some by this one, but it certainly wasn't awful or anything. Had at Anam Cara, served in lovely Celebrator glass. Pour was opaque dark amber, I found the aroma to come across as slightly roasted, and slightly plumey. Taste is a bit lean and smooth, I thought, mostly of roasted malt and a bit of alcohol hinting around. I will have to try this again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,waughbrew,4.97,"Fabulous. Deep chestnut with a small creamy beige head. It is a nice combo of roastiness, smokiness, and nuttiness with low carbonation and nice lagery characteristics. Ultra-smooth yet complex. Very drinkable. Not really like any other doublebock that I have had - less body and caramel, more nutty and that little smokiness. A classic.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BrewMan82,4.1,"Pours pure black, closer inspection reveals some nice ruby tint in the light. White head settle down quickly. Smells very sweet and malty, with some nutty fruit aroma coming to the front. Malt overpowers this brew with sharp and strong coffee and fruit taste. The finish is much smoother, with some smoky toastiness I really liked. Tasted almost completely flat and on the tongue - no carbonation - but intense flavor kept thinness away and richness provided ample fullness. The smokiness melts away for a smooth aftertaste that invites more. Excellent.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Truh,3.83,"The doppelbock poured a deep ruby to brownish hue, on the darker end of the ruby scale. An initial thin caramel, head existed that floated into disorganization rather quickly, so there was little to no retention. Up front date and caramel notes existed, with a bit of licorice or treacle off to the side, along with the present tone of malt. On first taste, the malt overpowers immediately, but not negatively. This is followed by some roasted characters, not unexpected. This had a creamy mouth feel with burnt umber tinges left as echoes. There is a pleasant amount of alcohol, but an amount that would not prevent this from being a session ale.  Celebrator holds a particular fondness in my heart for two reasons-  1. Shortly after discovering home brewing in spring of 1993, I went on a beer-buying excursion in Boston and this was one of the libations that I purchased, no doubt swayed by the plastic goat.  2. On a business trip to Seattle, I discovered Celebrator on draught at the Pike Pub and Brewery. Needless to say, I stumbled home after that.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Dark brown opaque dense body with ruby red highlights when held up against the light. Nice two inch tall khaki colored head formed after pouring, but soon dissipated to a thin soapy ring of bubbles. Lacing around the glass is relatively moderate. Aroma was that of plums, raisins, and hazelnuts. Taste was vinous and fruity with notes of sweet molasses, caramel, dark fruits, roasted nuts, and spices. There were also some burnt smoky flavors evident. Creamy mouthfeel is smooth like satin. The aftertaste was dry and the only place where the hops stepped out. Nice find at Ziggys in Chattanooga, Tennessee.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smell: Malty, chocolaty nose, in the main. Hints of hop spiciness and raisins. Banana and apple esters also present.  Taste: Mild beginning, leading to strong malt presence mid-palate. Hints of coffee and caramel tease the tongue. Finish is reminiscent of chocolate bread, with a mild alcohol burn and some hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Thick-ish, but not as thick as a Baltic porter or Mackeson's stout. Large-bead carbonation aerates the palate.  Drinkability: Nice, drinkable beer. Could certainly pound a few of these back.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,DrunkenPanther,4.17,"I should start off by saying that although I had this on tap, it was not the conventional tap. While at an Ayinger brauhaus in Munich, this was available in a large wooden keg that was just tapped with a wooden faucet. Wasnt quite as carbonated as the regular tap version, but was not exactly a cask version either. It was also a tiny creamier tasting than the tap version. Other than that, it was pretty much the same. Ok, the color was a dark ruby, almost brown, with a tannish colored thick head. The smell was almost a woody malt scent which was very enjoyable. The aroma lasted well into the drink. The taste was that of malt and raisin. Maybe a little berry tasting as well. Extremely well balanced. The mouthfeel was typical of the doppelbocks but maybe a bit more mellow. Very full and inviting. It is a beer that you dont mind holding in your mouth a bit longer to get a bit more taste. This is a very drinkable beer. Being not as strong as some of the other doppels, it doesnt give you that boozy aftertaste, nor does it have you drunk insanely fast.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,brewdlyhooked13,3.92,"Appearance - following the pour, it's black if viewed straight on, but hold it in front of a good light, it's a beautiful dark ruby color. Tan head formed up to about a finger and a half, holding at a covering and heavy collar.  Aroma - has a bready malty base with hints of spice and yeast. Kind of short-lived, the scents are light but steady, even in a Belgian glass.  Taste - malt base tastes good, develops into some chocolate and coffee notes. A pleasant hop influence shows up around the swallow, the flavor turns noticeably sweeter, some dark roasted coffee as well. Didn't wow me, but I like it. Alcohol presence is a bit noticeable initially and increases with temperature. Frankly, it's better than average, but not by leaps and bounds.  Mouthfeel - sturdy feel, moderate carbonation, well done for the style.  Drinkability - very much so. Not too over the top, but does a few things well. Personally I think it's a bit overrated on the whole, but earns high marks in a few areas.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Beersignal,4.54,"Deep dark brown pour with burgundy/amber highlights through what seems to be a very limpid beer. The biege cap of foam is light but generous and is very persistent and sticky leaving behind fine lacework.  This beer is all about the aromas. Amazing, complex! Superb fruity (raisins, cherries, blackberries...) malt in tandem with burnt caramel notes up front give way to brewing floor aromas like spent grains after a mash and that time I stuck my head in Ken Wilson's mash tun at Le Chaudron. A certain barn quality buttresses the above aromas and mixes with sweet notes of candy.  A fine and stimulating effervescence greets the first sip and gives way to a medium bodied beer up front. Malt dominates the first impressions of taste and is followed by fresh brewed coffee, lightly burnt caramel and a touch of christmas fruit cake. A firm and resiny bitterness cleans out the palate leaving a complex aftertaste.  This thoroughly pleasing and complex brew necessitates several tastings to really grasp all of the nuances which it cloaks. The aromas alone seem to multiply with every smell. The next time I see this beer I will buy more than the four I bought in Lake Placid.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ColoradoBobs,4.47,"Got myself this ($2.99 for 11.2 oz.), a couple of Salvators ($1.49 for 12 oz.) and a 750 ml bottle of St. Bernardus Abt 12 ($8.99!) at Wilbur's Wine and Spirits in Ft. Collins, CO, to celebrate my birthday, and to compare with each other. Appropriately, I'm starting the celebration with Celebrator!  Opened the bottle at approximately 45 degrees F. Perhaps a bit too warm, probably not?  Pours a lovely dark, almost opaque mahogany red-brown with a smooth tan two-finger head, that turns bumpy and thick and quickly diminishes to a small ring. Minimal lacing.  First smell is of raisins, coffee, chocolate and some sugar: warm and inviting. A very rich aroma.  First taste is rich, dark malt, and very very smoooth. Not as bitey as Salvator -- smooth like St. Martin's Dunkler Doppelbock, but warmer and heavier. By mid-glass, some of the spicey underflavors have come up. The taste takes on a clove almost peppery set. Long chocolatey, peppery, clovey aftertaste. Mmmm. I'm sure there are some hops in there somewhere, but they're well in the background -- just where I like them.  So silky in the mouth -- you want to roll it around a bit.  Drinkability is hard to judge from only one bottle, but at 6.7%, this one is bit on the weak end of the D-B scale, so it's pretty sure you could handle two or three -- if you can afford them.  While this is pretty good, I don't see it as being THAT much better than the St. Martin I mentioned earlier. It IS smoother than Salvator.  I'd love to compare this with Maximator -- anybody know where I can get a couple of them in N. Colorado?",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,99bottles,4.52,"Celebrator pours a very deep red-mahogany body with a billowing tan/off white head. After popping the cap, the smell immeadiately takes over. Sweet and rich, it speaks of raisins and prunes. Fermented sugars and alcohols combine with malted notes to give this an incredibly appealing and complex nose. The taste is on quite the same level. Sweet and very smooth, not nearly as viscous as you might expect. Again, prunes, raisins, nuts, molasses, and light choco taste. There is a flavor very much like candied yams: a sort of carmelized, burnt, fermented sugar taste that makes this oh so delicious to sip. A really unique aftertaste, of earth, sugar, smoke, and nuts. Cashews or something, it's sort of tough to describe. This is really good stuff. The mouth is balanced to perfection. Light enough to be easily drank, but heavy enough to hold the intense flavors. Drinkability is also top notch, as this is good enough to warrant having another. Quite a special beer, and the pinnacle of dopplebocks IMO. Plus it comes with a fun plastic goat trinket. Whee!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,CRJMellor,4.12,"Pours with a thick dark amber with black highlights. Minor tan head forms on the pour and goes away quickly and leaves no lace on the glass. Aroma of raisins, black currant, chocolate, coffee and earthy hop aromas. Very complex and enticing. Flavor of sweet chocolate malt, raisins and sicpy, bittr medicinal alcoholic hit. Mouthfeel of sweet malt that moves to a very dry, slightly bitter and spciy middle and a finish of dry alcoholic power. Drinkability is pretty good. This beer is just served well in a bottle, it's a good beer but on darught this beer is probably as good as it gets.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,tjd25,3.9,"The beer poured an intense dark brown color. Totally opaque. The head was creamy. Clearly malt in the smell, with some sweetness.  A very thick brew, even chewy after a while. Dark malts, well balanced with some bitterness. Some caramel, and the bitterness of chocolate. The alcohol warmed my throat as I was drinking. It would be nice to enjoy this beer on a cold winter evening. Spices abound. The alcohol content seemed higher than the 6.7% he label announces.  This is not an easy beer to appreciate. My palate still needs some education for such a hardcore brew. But you can tell it's a great and complex beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,Zorro,5,"Pours a very dark clear brown brew.  Smell is malt and a fine perfume. Smell is a bit sweet with some molasses smell.  Taste is all dark malt with a mild bitterness at the end.

Overall, a pleasant aroma that has a nice malt scent to it. A second whiff reveals a scent similar to coffee.  The first sip was dominated by the delicious malt flavor. It has an almost chocolate-like taste, with a hint of caramel and molasses. With only a very moderate carbonation, it goes gown extremely smooth and has a dry creamy finish to it.

The aroma has a wonderful depth of maltiness, mixed with a background of alcohol. No hops at all in the smell, but there is a very slight roasted malt character. Also, at times the smell carries a twangy, plum-like fruitiness. The taste is full of a rich, deep malt-flavor. Its not nearly as sweet as many other doppelbocks, but instead has a full, grainy, chocolaty taste. Unquestionably, this is an oily, mouth-coating beer. Alcohol warming is pleasing. Finish is somewhat bitterprobably more so than other doppelbocks. Immeasurably enjoyablethis beer is a true classic!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,RootedFool,4.5,"11.2 ounce bottle purchased at the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California.  Had to pull back on the pour to prevent the head -- dense, frothy, tan, speckled with beehive-like clusters of tiny bubbles on the side of the glass -- from overflowing. Caught it just in time. Deflates neither quickly nor slowly, like a ripped air mattress. Ovals of lace cling to the glass. I've never seen lace so spare look so interesting.  As soon I started pouring, the smell slapped me lovingly across my face. A bloom of chocolate and sourdough bread. Avocado. Root beer.  The taste opens with a burly malt creature crouched in the background -- she waits a few seconds and then lunges with a sweet, rich open-handed shot of slow malt force, like peppery chocolates melted in velvet, across my palate. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, and the alcohol leaves my nose tickled.  Mouthfeel is, as I said, velvety. Just enough carbonation to curb flatness.  It's no wonder why this beer is so highly rated.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,CortexBomb,4.44,"Pours out deep brown, bordering on black, but the head gave way in pretty short order.  Smell is excellent and varied though, roast is there, along with an almost sugar sweetness, and a hint of fruit lurks in the background, as well as some chocolate.  Taste is wonderfully smooth and creamy with a strong sweet tinge that lingers throughout on the middle of the tongue, malt and chocolate are both present, along with a noticeable tinge of caramel and plenty of roast too.  Mouthfeel is thick and full, just like a bock should be, while maintaining smoothness and the drinkability on this is also great.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,FormatKid,4.5,"Purchased a 12oz bottle from Bacchus in Chattanooga. Out of the bottle it's a translucent, yet dark coffee brown. A HUGE head full of big bubbles literally erupts out of nowhere, 3-4 fingers high! Random small islands of lacing smatter here and there on the glass. Carbonation is middling, and seems to tone down rather quickly.  I can smell the relation between this and other lagers I've tasted. That undefinable (to me) sweet smell is present. However, it is backed by a confident roasty smelling malt that I've never encountered before in anything ""lager-ish"". This in turn mingles happily with an almost ethereal hop bitterness in the nose. It's far from one-dimensional.  This one goes down smooth and creamy, awesome mouthfeel. Taste leads off with a whispy hop-bitterness edge that transitions rapidly into those big malts. Taste is evident of mild smokiness, coffee, and flat unsweetened chocolate. Finish is ever-so-slightly dry. Alchohol taste is barely there, warming sensation is limited to a slight warmth pooling in my stomach later on in the beer. This beer is very balanced to me, and if I had another I would be hard pressed not to pour it too.  This beer takes the flavors that I really like in porters and stouts and somehow turns it into something I find highly drinkable. This would work equally as well for me sitting at a bar having a few and chatting it up, or sitting here savoring and chilling. Not to disrespect the beer but I could imagine it going great with traditional ""beer"" food (pizza, wings, appetizers, etc.) This beer and style has acquired a new fan.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,filabrazilia,4.08,An exceptionally dark crimson beer pours out of the bottle and into the glass. A full tan head head crowns this beautiful beer. The lace swirls around the glass in an almost artistic pattern.  Chocolate and roasted malts are heavy in the nose and are joind by a subtle fruitiness.  There is a sharp bitter flavor of roasted malt and chocolate and carmel that is tempered by a nice fruit sensation.  This is a full bodied beer that is wonderfully balanced and complex and bitter in the finish. This is a beer that can be savored like a winter warmer or drunk as a celebration of spring.  I enjoyed this beer and would love to try it on tap. A thoroughly enjoyable drinking experience awaits those who are willing to try it.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Foxman,4.35,"It pours a deep, dark chocolte brown with glinting ruby flashes. A prompt two fingers of light brown head disappears almost as quickly as it comes. There's shortlived dotty lacing.  First whiff gives roasted malt bearing a hint of sweetness, but rather more of the toasted grain and a note of coffee. A caramel presence makes a solid impression. The thick malt air holds sway until the finish.  Dense malt character dominates the initial flavor, but with notably subdued sweetness. A gentle berry notes slips in, then out, almost before you can identify it. Caramel greets the palate in the middle, then glides into a dark roasted coffee aura with a mild finishing bitterness. It's all malt, but it's also spirited and multi-dimensional.  Medium bodied, the generous malt presence generates a light syrupy sensation in the mouth. It slides slowly away from the palate.  This is the best of a very barleyed world, at least for me this evening; a muscular assertion of malt with blissfully understated malt sweetness. The various aspects of the malt flavors give it a full and impressive image. The mutiple levels keep it interesting. At the risk of sounding sexist, this is a manly beer, leathery and earthen, with body and confidence to spare. Just one could never be enough, and a few, or even more, could never be boring.

39,131,Dubblebock,4.46,"Celebrator Doppelbock is one of those rare standard-bearer brews, a recognized and respected classic of it's particular style. I love these big, malty, hearty, German brews. The bottle comes with this cool little plastic ram tied around the neck, a really classy touch.  Celebrator poured exceptionally well. The head was frothy and at least 3/4 of an inch thick. It took a few minutes to reside, but it never quite completely dissolved, staying around as a thin layer of foam floating on top of the liquid. This is the black hole of beers, so deep and rich that light cannot escape. Absolutely wonderful. The nose was good, too, although not as heavy as I had expected based on the raw appearance of the beer.  The taste was pure bliss. Chocolate malts hit my taste buds immediately, followed by a warm rush of alcohol. This is one rich and inviting doppelbock. Very complex, too. Hints of almonds appear in the taste, followed by a semi-sweet cocoa bitterness. Freakin' fantastic.  The Celebrator finished up smooth and warming. The aftertaste was smooth and clean. Exceptional mouthfeel. The carbonation was perfect.  The Celebrator is certainly a world-class doppelbock. I was glad that I picked this up on my weekend beer run. Although I didn't have this sample with food, I could easily recommend any type of beef dish as a food compliment. It would be a welcome addition at my table if I were serving steaks or pot roast.  Get it if you see it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Indybeer,4.73,"11.2 oz bottle. Poured a deep dark mahogany with a massive head that stuck around. Lots of lacing left behind when the head finally receded. Aroma is slightly malty and spicy but not overly so, making me think that the taste would be muted also. However the taste is exceptional. very malty, thick and chewy with a creamy smooth feeling as it goes down. I could drink these all night!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,stewart124,4.53,"This brew pours a very dark mahogany color with a huge foamy tan head taht lasts. The smell is a rich blend of roasted malts and a slight hint of chocolate. Very smooth body with with a creamy feel. There are rich flavors of sweet chocolate, carmel, and traces of molasses. Hops are slightly present and a nice medium carbonation.The aftertaste is a dry burnt flavor. This is a very nice beer and I didn't want the bottle end. Another plus to the beer is that it comes with a little plastic ram. Outstanding!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Hex92,4.07,"Big foamy head when poured, but no lacing. Very dark with maybe a hint of red if you hold it up to the light. A little flat so the mouthfeel is not as good. But it has a great flavor. For some reason it has always reminded me of those root beer candies that are shaped like a mini keg. This is a good beer. But when you break it down into these categories it seems like the ranking is lower than it should be. Maybe its a case of the whole is better than the sum of its parts.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,WesWes,4.42,"The beer pours a deep brown color with a thick tan head that eventually fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It is full of black and roasted malts; very malty. It has a creamy scent with hints of chocolate and nuts. The taste is also great. It goes down smooth with a dry, yet creamy finish. It has chocolately, roasted nut flavor that is very nice. This is the best Doppelbock I've ever had. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer drinks very well. It has tremendous flavor; simply a fine beer. This is one that I will buy again.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ViveLaChouffe,4.6,"One sentence review: Dopplebock Plus.  Pours a dark, dark ruby with a big brown head. Lacy head as it goes. Smell is extremely malty and nutty.  Taste is very malty and nutty. I mean, it's everywhere on the palate. Rich. Sticky and chewy. Big bodied beer and really, really tasty. If you have ever had another dopplebock, increase all the flavors by equal amounts 25% and this is what you will come up with. Smooth but a real sipping brew for me, not for sessions. The King of Dopplebocks.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,garymuchow,4.2,"I did make one mistake when sampling this bottle in that I probably served it a bit too warm, thereby not allowing the changes in flavor and aroma to be experieced by me (which others have noted). Having said that... Aroma is a slightly grainy sweet rich dark malt. Very nice. Boy beer upon opening. Pours with excessive head (3 to 4 inches). Dark brown, red hues. Clear. Lacing and rings after each drink. Sweet dark heavy caramel, cloy without excess and only a slight malt bite. Unbelievably smooth. Feel of alcohol warmth in stomach. Feel is so outstanding for a heavy dark lager.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Bierguy5,4.02,"From the tap this pours a very deep dark brown ruby red color. Wonderful off-white head. Great thing about it was that it is being served to me in proper glass. Smells of dark bread. Tastes like a very dark, roasted almost burnt malt, however it is so smooth. How can this be? Looking at it you would expect bitter and harsh, but this is not true. Good mouthfeel. This is a very good beer, but it really isn't my style. I can and will respect this for what it is, a great dopplebock. I couldn't drink many of these, but if it is on tap, I am compelled to have one, if nothing else, than for the glass.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,UnionMade,4.45,"OldCrustacean brought a couple bottles over. Very much appreciated! The beer pours a murky umber, almost black, topped with a thick tan foam that reaches out of the glass. A bit hazy, shining a deep mahogany through light. The head settles into a thin covering over the beer, with a healthy thicker dollop in the middle, keeping stubbornly all the way through. Not much in the way of lacing, but I'm not complaining. The aroma is powerfully malty, oddly soft and gentle for such a big beer. Very refined, with a stagnant black coffee aroma and some mocha. Rather fruity, with some raisin, red grape and fig, conveying a slightly vinous character. A bit woody and leathery, with some caramel quality coming through as it warms. Very clean, despite the fruitiness. The flavor starts with a powerful fist of chocolate laced coffee, drizzled with molten caramel. A silken smoothness carries the beer, with assertive, yet soft carbonation. Fig and raisin fruitiness peeks through the malt, providing a vinous feel, with hints of red grape, raspberry, and plum. An earthen leathery quality comes through towards the finish, probably from the hops, with slight herbal hop flavor into the finish, providing only slight bitterness. A whiff of alcohol breezes into the sinuses on the swallow, leaving you with a bit of warmth in the stomach. A raisiny mocha aftertaste lingers on the side of the tongue for quite a while, leaving you wanting more. Truly a legendary beer. This is easily one of my favorites, and it's always a treat to drink. My tastebuds scream for mercy after one, so i can't take too many, not to mention the alcohol sneaks up on you through the smoothness. I prefer the tap version a little more, but it's rather difficult to find. Definitely a winner any way you can get it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,JMH_,3.88,"pours with a simply massive foamy tan head. the head lasts and lasts (and lasts) too. a nice little bonus. body is a nice brown colour with hints of amber. smells of berries (cherry and grape, perhaps) and malt throughout. almost a bit of a sour (not bad)smell here with hints of licorice and perhaps carrots (?). whatever it is, it smells good, but a tad off. taste is a creamier version of the smell. full bodied and smooth with a touch of caramel added with malt all over the place. the problem is, while the flavour is nice, i can't escape that cooked carrot/slightly 'off' characteristic that was in the smell. it's here in the taste as well and hinders what could be an awesome brew. still very good and drinkable, but i prefer something more along the lines of the SA double bock, which, whilst not as complex or bold as the celebrator, i think it's a better balanced brew. you've got to try the celebrator at least once and it is definitely worth your while (and cash) but while this is an excellent example of the style, i've had doppelbocks i enjoy more than this one.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,PCaravan,4.48,"I finally get a shot at trying a real German Dopplebock. No head stuck around to evaluate but the wonderful chocolate color was a beautiful sight in itself and as it turned out it matched the beer as well. Aroma was light and all malt with notes of chocolate. The taste was initially a smooth nutty buscuit that finishes with strong chocolate overtones. It's the same kind of chocolaty taste you get from Anchor Porter except this one was more like having a piece of dark chocolate cake in a glass. Mouthfeel was thick and rich and in fact it was so rich and thick I would not want to have more than one of these at a time but I enjoyed this one so much I gave it good drinkability marks. I would definitely have this again if I can find it again. It is hard to find as I've been looking for this for a long time and I finally came across it about 400 miles from home. If this one is readily available to you, consider yourself lucky.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Hagbard,4.15,"Pours dark, almost black, from its bottle with the little goat figurine hanging on it. The goat is now hanging from one of my cabinets in the kitchen. A nice large white head forms after a standard pour, but fades after a minute or so. Light seeps into the bottom of the glass, making the bottom look a little lighter than the middle and upper parts. Very nice! The aroma is big malty sweetness with a bit of dark dried fruits thrown in. The taste is huge malt right out out of the gate. Yeast and bready flavors begin to hit the tongue almost immediately. As it sits on the tongue, the dried fruits from the aroma make an appearance. The aftertaste is a nice mix of malt and bread. It feels very full in your mouth, the heavy carbonation level tickles the roof of your mouth. I found it very smooth. It was nice and drinkable for the first half of the pint, but I found myself struggling to finish the final quarter of it. I found the malt flavors began to pound all the other flavors into submission and it became a little overpowering and overwhelming. It seems like I would only want one of these in a sitting, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and I will definitely explore this one further.  This was my first experience with a doppelbock and I chose a good one. It tasted like an extremely malted porter or stout. I'll be exploring this style further.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,HiroProtagonist,4.5,"Poured from a 330 ml bottle claiming it contains the ""finest Bavarian double bock beer"", and displays an illustration of two goats getting frisky with a helpless glass of beer. Upon pouring, an ample tan head formed on the blackish liquid, and soon settled into a thin blanket of foam, leaving fine lacing in its wake. When the beer was held up to a small lamp, the color is a deep and seductive ruby, like a dark red wine. This one was a sniffer, with an upfront nose of dark roasted malts, with perky and clean accents of ripe plantains and turkish coffee. Fantastic and well-defined character! The beer tasted delicioius as well. It started with a suprisingly bittersweet roasty malt wallop, and was soon joined by flavors of raisins, dark bitter chocolate, and coffee, with faint suggestions of cherry. The finish was fairly dry, with chocolate and cherry flavors lingering. I was highly impressed by the everything but the mouthfeel, which I felt could was just a little too thin. This problem is insigificant however, compared with its exceptional beauty, and the characteristics of smell/taste. After experiencing this dopplebock, I am not inclined to argue with the claim on the bottle.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Mangus,4,Pours a very dark body with a nice thick off-white head. The head slowly settles to a fine thin layer.  Smells nice and malty (I'm partial to the malty side of beers) and I can really smell that barley wort aroma. Sweet and fruity as well.  Nice sweet malt flavor with a slight drying finish. Certainly has that German beer taste. What is that? It leaves a smooth lingering smoothness that makes me reach for the next sip. High quality brew here.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,wsouloa,4.42,"Celebrator is definitely a great beer. It is a very dark, almost black color. It provides a good head and the smell of this beer is really something special. The aroma of chocolate is detectable as well as a very malty smell. This is a thick beer but not overpowering. It is not highly carbonated and goes down smooth. The flavors of chocolate and coffee are evident. Despite its thick body, it goes down smooth. I had a few of these during Christmas dinner and afterward. A few people have said it has gone well with meats but I would also suggest it with goose which is what I had for Christmas this year. It turned out to be a good combination.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,HappyHourHero,4.12,"Poured a big tan head that left a solid lacing as it faded to a thin film. The beer is black in color and had a cola colored glow when lit.

All in all a solid beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,beergeek279,4.38,"Served in a nonic pint glass, at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse. The color was black, with a wispy beige head. The smell was slightly malt sweet. The taste was a very well-balanced sweet malt, with no alcohol present in the taste. Mouthfeel was nice and thick. Drinkability-wise, I could definitely have quite a few of these.  A fantastic dopplebock, and between this and Salvator, the best examples of the style out there. I'm just sorry that I missed it this long, but now that I'm in the know, I'll certainly have this one again!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,TinusTime,4.47,Pours a dark chestnut brown with a light off white fluffy head. Smells malty with a bit of raisiny fruit. Taste is massive sweet malt and then more malt. Nice dark sweet bread flavours with just enough hops to keep this beer from slipping into the abyss. Mouthfeel is smooth and big. Drinkability is quite good too even though the beer is at 6.8 ABV. Goes great with roasted meats or some nice smoked wurst and red cabbage. One of the classic Dopplebocks.. A huge beer in a little 12 oz bottle. A staple in my beer fridge.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,counselor,4.28,"Pours a mahogany brown with a tall, tight fluff tan colored head. The beer smells of dark caramelized raisins, plums and other sweet fruits. the mouthfeel is rich, milky smooth that glides past the tongue like liquid silk. The taste is rich, sweet, malty, like a wicked cheesecake after a big meal. This is a big heavy beer that demands to be sipped and enjoyed; no guzzling this one. The finish is a dry sweet one that lingers on the edge of the tounge. Great beer",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,byrd,4.65,"Large fizzy light brown head. Very dark brown in color with garnet highlights. The head becomes frothy and recedes slowly. The lace becomes thick on the surface. Marvelous aroma of dark fruits and sweet molasses. Smooth almost silky medium to full mouthfeel with a soft carbonation. Lots of dark fruit malty flavors  plums raisins, fig. Chocolate notes and coffee notes come through in the finish with a slight hop presence at the very end. Wonderfully easy drinking brew that easily lives up to its reputation. Very enjoyable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Shaw,3.8,"I had a bottle of Celebrator several years ago, before I was versed in double bocks, and thought it was too extreme. After sampling more of the style, I felt ready to try it again, especially after reading all the raves here on BeerAdvocate.  It looks just like it should, very dark with a nice foamy head. It smells of malt, malt and malt, The taste is good, but just a little lighter than I was expecting. This is really picking nits, but I found Primator's Double Bock to be better (namely sweeter) which is why I've only given the taste a 3.5 instead of 4. But that is very subjective.  It has a good mouthfeel: super-smooth and glassy.  Celebrator is a good choice. But I feel it stands almost equally with the other double bocks I've reviewed. I'm beginning to think that double bocks are like porter: hard to mess up. The differences between them come down to personal preference. Enjoy it along with Optimator and Primator. And I look forward to trying more of this great style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,GCBrewingCo,4.42,"The beer poured dark amber brown. The head was off-white, almost tan, and lasted to lace the glass.  The aromas were chocolate, raisins, dark fruits, and sweet caramel malt. A very complex aroma profile.  The flavor was chocolate and raisin well balanced within the malt sweetness. The flavor, like the aroma, was complex.  The finish was dry chocolate. The body was medium.  11.2 ounce bottle. (Which had been in the beer fridge for quite some time stored cold but had no freshness dating information.)",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A heavy, almost oily malt body is home to many rich flavors and tastes. Strong coffee, chocolate and fresh rye bread-like tastes are upfront. Tastes of licorice, orange zest, toffee and nice alcohol finish get together very nicely. As it warms a taste of prunes develops. This is one satisfying brew!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,BeefyMee,3.81,"I was super-psyched to see this on tap when I walked into the bar. As can be expected, expectation is the mother of all disappointments. While it was still very good, I definitely liked it better out of the bottle. Drafts alway have that certain intangible that bottled beers can't replicate, but it wasn't enough in this case. It just didn't wow me like the bottled version did. The beer still had a nice malty flavor, but there was an absent nuttiness. I would get this over most of the other beers at any bar; I just wish I could go back and not expect the world from it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,RedBaron,4.43,"Outstanding doppelbock from Ayinger.  Poured nicely, viscous and with a creamy, brownish head. Body was nearly opaque. This lager smelled terrific, with a multi-grain sweet influence, as well as smokey. I detect a hop presence in the nose, but it really is overshadowed by the complexity of the malts.  Initial taste was clean, but with a darn good malty, sweet taste (but not artificially sugary). It also finished clean, as a typical Bavarian brew, but with residual sugars that like to stick to the back of the tongue, and the roof of the palate. Mmmm!  This is THE beer to drink when the weather's cold and damp, when summer looks far, far away, but there's a log on the fire, a good book in the other hand, and you're gratetful for being alive!

39,131,Ave,4.8,"330 ml bottle, 6,7 % abv let sit for 10 min to bring to around 45(ish) F. Some scoring of the bottom edge of the label. Dont know if this is some sort of coded date or what. Poured into a oversized pils bubble glass.  Ayinger has become my favorite German producer that has a wide variety of styles, that I can find in these parts. So after a year or more of loveing up the Ur-Weisse, Dunkel & Kellerbier, it seems odd that I am just now getting around to trying there number one reviewed selection & one that I seem to have known by reputation for years at that.  Shows up as a dark roasted amber color, with shades of rose & deep maple tones. Healthy pillowed foamy head settles in. Certainly strikes a serious & stately appearance.  The abv & rich malt are very apparent in the nose up front. Sweet peppery wood & beef hints develop nicely as things move along.  Malt happiness fills the pallet at once. Mega luscious autumn squash, caramelized nut, earthy warmth all over the tongue. Slides into an equally balanced & rich hop bitter further on. Ends with perhaps just a bit of a sour tang, though if someone were to call this skunky I might have to um have some words with the fellow.  Mouth feel is crisp & lively, keeping the flavor & aroma moving around on the pallet nicely. Slight hanging taste but nothing that another sip wont take care of. I could probably keep drinking this as far into the evening as I could afford.  The head dosn't stick around as long as I would like, & the abv is a lingering presence (7% me arse) but all in all, I would have to say the best double bock I have ever had. I dont know if it will consistently be worth the $15/6 reputation its got around the tragically few shops that carry this jewel of a brew, but it is truly a lovely encounter.  Ave",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Rastacouere,4.94,"In a Fin Du Monde tulip. It's very dark brown with a huge frothy tan head, slowly, but steadily diminishing though. Aroma is not as intense as I thought, but definitely complex and appealing with its chocolate and numerous fruits notes. Now that's malty. This beer is as complex as any other beer. Period. Rich roasty black chocolate, some caramel, lots of plum esters, blue grapes, cherries, pecans, coffee, yum yum, butter notes as well as robust earthiness every couple of sips (sometimes, the malt reminded me of Rogue Hazelnut Brown nectar). The palate is as good as it gets, thick, full, round, velvety. Long aftertaste once it warmed a bit that varies from a sip to the other, once it will be the dark chocolate, the other time it will be the roastiness and next time you'll remember those juicy plums, subtly bitter at times. In my eyes, it's fully worthy of these high ratings. That's precisely the type of beers I adore, a big malty phenomenon with a body to back it up. Only critic I'd adress it is the palate fatigue (or I just want the moment to last forever) I get after just one bottle, maybe the sweetness is too much although I never found it stickingly cloying, I wouldn't have two in a row, hell I'd never deserve two i a row!

39,131,BuckeyeNation,3.6,"Deep, dark brown with ruby highlights, capped by a massive, light brown, lumpy head that recedes relatively quickly to a thin, covering film. Not much in the way of lace. The aroma is predominantly of coffee and dark dried fruits (raisins, prunes and dates). It isn't as complex as expected, but is appetizing nonetheless.  The flavor is malty sweet, with molasses and coffee at the head of the line. Some alcohol is evident; surprising since the ABV is only 6.7%. I noted a slight metallic taste with the first few sips, but it faded soon thereafter.  The mouthfeel isn't bad, but isn't all that wonderful either. I was expecting more smooth creaminess, but didn't get it. Drinkability is good.  Celebrator is my first doppelbock so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Given the high ratings, I expected to like it more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a good beer, but it didn't come close to knocking my socks off. I do like the little goat charm though. Nice touch.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,RockyTopHeel,4,"Celebrator...I've waited a long time to try my first doppelbock, and I might as well start with the best...  Poured a dark, dark, DARK chestnut, with ruby tones reflecting light. A strong two-finger head quickly died down to a thin layer of foam. First deep breath revealed a touch of caramel and some spices. Taste was rich and malty, with the same caramel and a nice complexity of spices as well as a roasted edge that's so palpable its almost chewy. Definitely strong on the caramel, though.  This felt a lot lighter and easier to drink than its flavor and complexion would have you believe. I usually don't like brews this soft and malty, but this is good--no wonder it's legendary. Still, and I hate to say it, but to me this is a very good but not great beer--but that's more to do with personal preference than the quality of Celebrator, which I can definitely appreciate even if it isn't my style. My tastes wouldn't stop me from recommending this to anyone, especially if you like stuff along these lines (that means you, Joj and Erti).",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Two fingers of foam quickly dies down to a thin, dense, and tiny-beaded head of a dirty tan color that does not cling. Garnet translucence around edges of glass when held to light. Hard to smell from a distance, but when nose goes up to glass--wow... an actual tactile, mallowy sensation in the nose, like plowing nose into a thick, rising pillow of molasses, gingerbread, baking spices. Dense, complex, inviting. Flavor is equally complex: starts with rush of sweet malt; seamlessly melds into a midpalate of nutmeg, allspice, clove (?), touch of molasses... liquid gingersnaps! Develops still further into figs, golden raisins, more molasses; allusions to the darkest of Jamaican rums in a warm, soft, dry alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is outstanding, with the same mallow quality as detected in the aroma; soft, velvet smooth. You barely have to swallow. Drinkability is high, but this beer is so nuanced that having more than one would almost be overkill... Perfect beer to pass a chilly, blustery night at home, and damn near perfect in all other regards as well. Damn near perfect.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

The taste is hard to bring to words. It's a huge chewy bite of fruity fermentation goodness. You get a big rush of plum and grape with some wonderful subtle nutty and coffee undertones.

The taste reminded me a lot of a nut brown but with an even more pronounced malt character and a hint of spice in there too. As far as dopplebocks go this is the best I've ever had....and it even came with a plastic goat!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,merlin48,4.77,"How can you not love a brew that comes with a goat charm! I first tried one of these a couple weeks ago, and made a 6 hour roundtrip drive last weekend to find some more. Removed the goat charm and stored it away. My ladyfriend says she's going to make me a necklace out of these. Pours a rich dark mahogany with a beautiful thick head. OOH, that smell. Fresh English toffee, caramel, and nice malts dominate. Feels euphoric in the mouth, and so drinkable. I love this stuff. As it warms in the glass it even tastes nutritious. Aftertaste is just as pleasant as the rest of its fine qualities. Can't wait to wear the necklace. Top Three for sure!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Smell: Sweet malt, molasses, caramel. Fresh, energizing, bready nose. Taste & Mouthfeel: Thick, lush, knife-and-fork chewyness. Sweet (but not as cloying as some other doppels), creamy, followed by semi-dry finish. Alcohol hangs back in the taste/mouth, but sneaks up later in the overall ""experience."" Drinkability: A stellar brew, worthy of it's BA ranking (sets the standard for its style IMO). I find the combination of sweetness and ABV (in general) to be formidable for extended sessions.

39,131,dedalus,4,"in the low light the beer appeared straight black, with a minimal head, but good, brownish, clingy lace.  brown sugar and caramel in the nose, with some faint chocolate notes, and bafflingly, a hint of old, dusty books(!).  moderately thick mouthfeel. not too thick, not too thin. any thicker and the brew would be far less drinkable.  initial flavors of clean malt, sugary and syrupy, followed by molasses and caro syrup, and ending with a faint burnt sugar in the background. no real hop presence to speak of.  i prefer balanced beers, but doppelbocks aren't supposed to be balanced, and the heavy malt flavors were appropriate for the style. that said, i don't anticipate going back for another anytime soon. lagers can sometimes be a bit too linear for me; i prefer the layered complexity of ales. but this is not a suggestion that the celebrator is of inferior quality; it's just my subjective preferences coming through. the beer is highly drinkable ... if you're only having one. any more than that and i suspect the malt would become far too cloying.  s.d.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,fuchebu,4.28,I tend to find myself at Ludwig's Garten quite often for those German draught beers. The Celebrator is one that they rotate often. They had it last week when I made my last visit. The bartender brought me my half litre. The dark copper hue was apparent as enough daylight poured through the window of the bar.  There is a bit of butteriness in the nose. It has a sweetish caramel aroma that entices the drinker. I slowly take a few sips and notice a better than expected balance to the beer. The malts give it a sweet nuance but the hops are also noticable. The beer is full bodied but not too heavy as to discourage consumption. It would be easy to drink a few of these guys. I don't like this as much as Salvator or Maximator but it's still a treat whenever I find it on draft.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,AtLagerHeads,4.38,An awesome doppelbock that looks good and tastes good too. The body is a very deep red-hued bronze that sports an incredible head of tan foam The head is fairly retentive and is tightly built foam that laces well on the glass.  The nose is fruity and gives some plum sense along with a full complement of malt and spice. The feel is full and thick with a long lasting aftertaste. If this beer has a shortcoming it is the slight grassy flavor that comes early in the taste.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Ellbert,3.52,"Appearance: It poured a very deep Ruby Red color. Looks almost black. It had a huge beautiful head that lasted a while. it settled to a thin layer of foam with a beautiful lace.  Smell: Sweet with a little spiciness and hops. There is a musty smell to it that isn't that pleasant.  Taste: There is some prune flavor in there. A lot of malty sweetness with a little bit of a hop bite. Alcohol is present even though it is only 6.7  Mouthfeel: Very thick and meaty. Very nice carbonation. As mentioned by many, you almost need a knife and fork with this beer.  Drinkability: Very thick and full. Probably would not be able to have more than two of these per setting.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,gnaussea,4.48,"Pours just beautifully with a fully retentive tan head floating above a very dark, but fairly clear body. Smells of roasted caramel malts, a bit of banana, and subtle, fruity nuances. The taste is a bit more roasted, with the malt not quite as strong. Molasses is prominent. Bold, but not overpowering. Very complex flavor with many subtle, indistinguishable flavors that produce more a general feel than they do individual qualities. The hops are present but underlining, and I think are a unique blend that provides the fruity flavor. The mouthfeel is simply perfect. Carbonated to give a nice, happy kick, but not vigorous. The only criticism I can give this beer is that it does not provide the bocky wheat flavor. A wonderful brew. I dont generally care for Ayingers but this is definitely among my favorite beers.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,smitty1080,4.32,Pours out dark and lucious with a thick head packed tight with tiny bubbles. The aroma is dominated with fruit and chocolate. The taste is ruled by sweet and smooth malt.

Nose is filled with chocolate, molasses, & dried fruit.  Coffee, chocolate, molasses, some breadiness (kind of like brown bread), all meld together and give way to the perfect amount of bittering hops. This bitterness rushes in & deftly cuts off all the sweetness from up front. Finishes dry, with a lingering rast flavour, & a hint of fig newton cookies (wihtout all the sugar). Thick & rich, moderate carbonation.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

My friends who had this obsessed about how great it was and this site has it at something like 4 or 5 on the top beer list. But, to my dismay, this was simply a little above average. Dark with a very, very small head. Might this have been sitting on the shelves for too long? Anyways the flavor was strong and there was a very chewy thick mouthfeel to the beer that didn't completely appeal to me. A strong malt flavor came but this beer was never sweet.

Head refuses to die. It just sits there, daring you to get to the beer.  Chewy, foamy, slick and sweet in the mouth. Chocolate and cocoa and coffee and caramel, along with the aforementioned plum and raisin tastes. Low and toasty, it circles your mouth, burning slightly and making you say, Oh.... Ah...  I last had this about five years ago. Since then, I have tried dozens and dozens of different beers. I have wondered for quite a while if this beer would be truly as good as I remembered it.  It is.

Appearance: Pours a dark, dark, fudge brown; fat, cocoa-tinged brown; d-cup's worth of lacing; very good head retention.  Aroma: Somewhat mildly of molasses and carmelized brown sugar.  Taste: Thick, toasted malt profile upfront and throughout; strong notes of black bread, dark fruits, molasses and brown sugar; a subtle hop bitterness balances things out in the finish; hints of graham crackers and butter; not half as sweet as one might imagine; full bodied with a smooth, chewy mouthfeel.

Chewy malt with a sharp hop bitterness that burns a little on the way down. A little bit of fruit. The taste kind of dies right at the end and does not leave much. I was a little disappointed in this regard.  Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, and rather full-bodied.  This is a great doppelbock, but it seems rather overrated. I actually prefer the Paulaner Salvator myself, as it offers more in the way of flavor. The Celebrator had a nice start, but no real finish.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,RoyalT,4.72,"Appearance  The head came up, lasted and laced, but the body is the story here. This is that deep, dark, rich color that all good Doppelbocks possess.  Smell  The darl malt, bready yeast aroma is here in spades. Theres also a deep molasses scent that fills the room. Some loose fruits and a scent of alcohol complete the package.  Taste  This is monstrous. The molasses comes out in force, laced with brown sugar and alcohol along with deep, roasted, mature yeast flavors.  Mouthfeel  This is a bit bigger than medium-bodied and very bitter from the unsulphored molasses flavors. It has a lingering aftertaste, which seems to be a trademark of the style.  Drinkability  This is a terrific representation of the style. It is more complex than most and is a real treat.  Update  I have this occasionally and decided to review it for 2004. This really is a big, complex example of the style and I guarantee will top the list of any blind DB tasting.  Update  I cellared a 2004 vintage and popped it in the spring of 06. The body held up well but was right on the edge of being spent. The molasses matured times two and the overall mouthfeel was incredibly smooth.

The taste is all over the place-black licorice, Bittersweet chocolate, mocha, sweet malt, espresso-this is a meal. A highly satisfying drink that I can honestly say rates up there with some of the best things ever to slip across my tongue. It is good to be alive!

39,131,Mitchster,4.2,"Pours out to a clear, dark moahogany in color, forming a whipped light tan head with OK retention and lacing with a strong pour. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Aroma is redolant with dates, prunes, a hint of brown bananas and strawberries, walnuts, vanilla, and dark caramel. The aroma tends to leave me with less of an impression after the initial mouthfull. Mouthfeel is somewhat spritzy, with a thinner body than expected for a dopplebock. Taste begins with a clean, yet unmistakeable lager ferment with characteristics of Wyeast 2206 Bavarian Lager yeast, followed by dark fruits as described above, balanced by a mild, yet distinct German Noble hop flavor, a suggestion of alcohol towards the end contributing towards the lightly dry, toasty, and nutty finish. Sweet, but not overly so. Molasses comes out as it warms up, making this brew more complex and enjoyable.  An excellent German Dopplebock...one of the standards of the style along with Optimator, Bajuvator, Korbinian and Salvator. This one has a more perfumy head with darker malt accents and lower carbonation than it's colleagues.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Nice spicy and malty aroma, deep buttery toffee with a dash of nutmeg. Velvety smooth, flavor of toffee and a peanut brittle huskiness. Body thickens mid mouth and just a touch of peppery hop balances the finish. Very pleasant, not beefy like some (Sam Adams) Doppelbocks can get. Distinctive nutty yeast qualities. Lots of rewarding aftertaste. Yes, this is a very well done Doppel, but if its a little pricey, I'd recommend midwesterners lay in a stock of the somewhat similar but even silkier Capital Autumnal Fire...

Smell was fruity sweet - raisins, dates, plums - over a big malt base. Also some caramel toffee and maybe a hint of coffee. Taste was complex. Again, sweet with plums, raisins, etc and toffee notes over a malt base. Alcohol bite in the finish but not bad. Still, I was expecting something more that would really get me excited about the beer. It never happened. Feel was syrupy, slick and on the heavy side of medium-bodied. For drinkability, I can't say I'd be searching for this beer again soon. It didn't appeal to my palate.

The head was a little less then I desired. It pours close to an inch of head that goes away fast. Smells of malt and maybe a hint of coffee or smoke, I could even say maybe a little fruity. Surprisingly drinkable it does not taste like a strong dark beer. The alcohol content is not noticeable. That could just be because I usually drink Belgiums. It actually reminds me of a dark Belgium. I enjoy decorating my office at work with the little goats that come with each bottom. They have come out with a four pack for those of you who dont feel like spending $14 on a six-pack but the price is well worth the beer.

Dark molases, dark plums, wood, roasted malt, raisins, brown sugar, very faint hints of smoke. Surprisingly mellow for such a dark beer. There was deffinatly some bitterness present but it was perfectly balanced if not sitting slightly in the background. I could get a firm earthy hop flavor as well, but as with most german beers, it was very subdued and mellow.  The beer finishes with a quick bitter burst and then just fades away with almost no lingering aftertaste.  Overall a superb beer, yet unique at the same time. With it's fine body and dark sweet fruit flavors it almost gave the impression of some belgian strong ales, but at the same time never losing the classic german bock flavor.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Pours a dark caramel color with a small head that does not stick around long. The aroma is of caramel and toffee, sweet chocolate and roasted grain. Upon first sampling, I thought it a bit sweet, but soon balanced itself out wonderfully with a dry and slightly hoppy finish. Outstanding!  Mouthfeel was very much full bodied and robust, smooth and silky. And of course, the taste - well, let's just say euphoria.

39,131,marburg,4.82,"One of the greats. What other phrase can possibly describe a beer with such a lucious, deep, dark color; such a billowing, persistent, magnificent head; and such a delightfully shocking aroma and taste?  Deep, dark midnight black -- that is, just this side of jet black. The head is a silly putty gray/brown that could be described as a dark off-tan. It's bulbous presence lingers throughout the entire experience. And it gives rise to one of the finer aromas one can hope for on a lager. Sweet, smooth hints of carmelized brown sugar and burnt malts grace the nose.  The same flavors carry through to the palate where dopplebock taste is simply defined. A big, sweet malty presence begins the treat and underscores every subtle flavor throughout. Not to be outdone, the hops play perfectly here, bringing with it a roasted bitterness that plays to the finish. If there's such a thing as ""squinting"" with one's mouth, engaging in such an action reveals just the slightest bit of lingering sweetness. This silky smooth brew may be, in my opinion, simply the best lager beer there is in any style. A treat.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Morris729,4.5,"Saved for my 400th Review. Pours a very dark brown garnet color with a thick and creamy tan colored head with a nice retention that eventually gives way to a heavy lace. Nose is dark roasted malts, molasses, and smoky charcoal. Full in body and slightly syrupy in texture yet still quite smooth. Taste is rich sweet dark malts and brown sugar up front followed by some espresso-like flavors and a touch of bittersweet chocolate. Towards the end, some raisiny notes and residual sugar sweetness express themselves while a hint of hop bitterness tries to bring some balance to the finish. Make sure you give this beer some time to warm after pouring to fully enjoy all of the complex aromas/flavors. This is a superb doppelbock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,shirfan,4.3,"A deep, almost purple-toned mahogany pour, with a small tan head; this is a mission into malt.  Has a sharp, tangy molasses-spicy aroma that almost reminds me of barbeque sauce.  Taste is sweet, tangy-sour and complex. Thick and heavy mouthfeel; a shade lighter than things like corsendonk, but the most complex dopplebock I've sampled. Notes of plums, figs, sour apple, molasses and brown sugar. Somehow manages to be ""moreish"" and not quite cloying, even though it borders on syrupy.  Deserving of the praise it has earned; this is a rich, strong and complex beer to be sipped slowly.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BierReise,4.1,"This is probably the best dopplebock in my opinion. Dark brown with a slight tan head. Aroma is earthy and grainy. Almost like an oat aroma that is sweet. Great blending of malts, some obviously roasted. Very smooth and drinkable. Slightly sweet and fruity. Another great beer from a great brewer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,jcalabre,4.18,"Originally sampled on 27 July 2002. Huge tan head, dark brown color w/ a very complex, rich, roasted taste, yet a clean finish. I haven't been too impressed w/ the other doppleboack's I've tried; however, I can understand why this one is world class. The more I drank it, the more subtle flavors I tasted. Great beer! It should be on everyone's 'Must try' list",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,longpondbeerman,4.25,"This is a good brew, but it's too understated for my taste--I guess dopplebocks are not my thing, really. That said, it is definitely worth a try, even though the price is rather steep. It pours a deep resonant mahogany with a dark chocolate head that receded very quickly. There is no lace to speak of. The smell reveals a distinct maltiness with subtle undertones of spices and chocolate. The taste was more refreshing: a light, bubbly, and unassertive malt flavor (not too sweet) that retained itself for a good while even as I savored its diffident tones.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Huge caramelly malt aroma, molassas, raisins and smoke thrown in for good measure. Grab a spoon and dig in ! Chewy malt flavor in a medium to full body and a longggg malty finish. It's toasty, nutty, brown sugar sweet,ripe plums and a little roasty and chocolate in the finish. A great one from the home of doppels!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,philipt,4.3,"I unexpectedly found this beer in VA, so I stocked up. I've wanted to try Celebrator Doppelbock for some time now and definitely didn't let this chance slip by.  A very dark and rich garnet in color, with a medium sized fluffy, beige head. Smells quite malty, with subtle hints of brown sugar, nuts and brown sugar bread. Initial taste is of controlled/balanced malt. Not as cloyingly sweet as anticipated. Brown sugar and nuts are apparent in the taste as well. Hops make a gentle appearance in the mid taste, and finishes very smooth.  This is the most balanced (re: not too sweet) doppelbock tried to date. Also, easily my favorite doppelbock tried to date.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Now this has one terrific look about it it pours an opulent dark red, almost deep dark blood red..with a small off-white head that doesnt last too long. Smell as expected with this style is super sweet and malty..so sweet its almost ""winey""..but its pleasant not sickening. The taste is slightly strange it sort of comes in waves..first an almost zanyy sweetness hits , then it fades to a small bitterness, then some sweetnes returns and is finished of with a wet unsweetned chocolate bitterness..very odd...but exciting certainlly. Very very nice on the taste buds due to the 'waves"" of flavour mention above!

I think dry.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,HardTarget,4.55,"Aroma: Deep dark malt, no noticeable hops. Appearance: Black, with flashes of blood red in front of a serious light source. My bottle seemed a little flat, very light head that evaporated almost instantly, with no lacing. Maybe it was just my bottle. Flavor: Fairly straightforward dark malt, with a hint of a maple syrup (blackstrap?). The first taste is the same as the aftertaste: very good both ways. Mild alcohol warming, but not intense. Mouthfeel: I found it a little light given the rich taste, I expect to have to chew, but it's very smooth. Overall: Man this went down quick. Great, BIG taste, but none of the heaviness you might expect. Drinkability is outstanding, hard to put it down to savor the aftertaste, you just want to pick it right back up again. A lot of malt sweetness and a sneaky alcohol kick. Celebration: commence!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,IrishRedRock,4,"I've waited entirely too long to enjoy this brew, and last night I finally had my opportunity. A few things: While it has a huge following and is arguably regarded as the best doppelbock out there, I wasnt extremely impressed. It is very good, but I expected more from it. However, I attribute this to a few reasons. I had already had a few beers before this. The previous ones were also higher in alcohol, possibly killing my ability to see the complexity in this brew. The beer I had directly before this was a Heavyweight Cinderbock, and the smoky flavors may have done considerable harm to my palate. Having said that...  The beer was a very deep brown color. Smooth, oily mouthfeel. Aromas of chocolate and malts. Huge malty flavors in the middle, finishes chocolatey. I gave it all 4's, but I am definitely coming back to this beer to give a more intelligent review.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,jerseyemt,4.05,"11.2 ounce bottle, poured into a glass. Pours a deep, dark brown with a nice tan head. Smell is wonderful; pure malt.

39,131,ellman,4.45,Mmm Doppelbocky.......  The Pour: A dark black brown with an exceptably full head that slipped away leaving a beautyful lace trim.  The Smell: A rich aroma for caramelized malt and a raisin tone.  The Taste: Semi sweet chocolate and nutty flavor  This beer is quite well balanced and I could drink it quite regularly.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Scooter77,4.35,"I can see why this brew is so highly rated, its great. Pours a deep brown almost black color with a slight ruby tint. A thick tan head arose, but quickly died down leaving a thin lace. The aromas were quite complex with dark malts, caramel, chocolate, and raisins. The taste is equally complex there were hints of nuttiness mixed with raisins and caramel, I swear that I could taste some licorice, too. Alcohol taste was quite apparent, but it wasnt overpowering so it mixed well with the other flavors. A mild alcohol and malt aftertaste was left in my mouth. This is a very complex and balanced brew; its absolutely exceptional.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,Hhawk06,3.97,"I was expecting big things out of such a highly reviewed BA selection. It poured purely black with a woodsy cranberry odor. I'm tasting a roasty licorice flavor intermingling with a dry bitterness. The aftertaste feels more nutty but remains dry. It makes you thirst for more! I did enjoy this brew, it's obvious this beer is carefully taken care of.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,texascarl,4.8,"Appearance = dark mahogony, almost black. Reddish highlights, not quite opaque. Light carbonation, thick tan head that receded fairly quickly.  Nose = MALT!! If you want someone to understand what malt smells like, here's your big boy. Blackstrap molasses & some hops  Taste = Malt. Velvet sledgehammer. Big & powerful to knock down a wall, but still smooth. Some hops are in there trying to balance the malt but it really has it's work cut out for it. A flavor in the finish that reminds me of Aussie Tawny Port - caramel sweet wine & raisens. Medium to long finish, semi-creamy mouthfeel.  Lord have mercy, this is good beer. I've found another new favorite.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Winter,3.26,"Celebrator pours black in color with mahongany hues. Its creamy tan head only lingered briefly before fading. The body has a syrupy cling to the side of the glass. Aroma seems to consists of dark fruit, fig, feint chocolate malt and mineral water. Mouthfeel seems thinner than I'd expect from a doppelbock, but borders on being medium-bodied. Taste was somewhat of a disappointment and hard to pin down. Flavors of coffee, malt and alcohol are combined with a raisiny finish. Celebrator isn't as sweet, malty and flavorful as other doppelbocks I've tried in the past. A bit of a let down.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,bierman2000,4.3,"Light brown and thin compared to other dopplebocks. Smooth and very malty with a bit of hop aftertaste.

39,131,Ahhdball,4.2,"This is the second round at this one for me. The first, I drank without tasting....goofy me. It poured creamy leaving a beautiful rich head at the top.

39,131,GeoffRizzo,4.85,"Presentation. 11.5 ounce bottle with the classic goat dangling from the bottle!  Poured a very dark, slight mahogany with a thick light color head. Smells of slight malt and massive caramel/coffee. The initial taste is huge...the malt/caramel/coffee blend seems to be perfectly balanced. The mouthfeel is consistent of those same qualities, just a touch of smokiness left on the palate. Overall, an outstanding beer, very very drinkable  Notes. $2.99 for this sampling at Blue Max, this is a top-notch beer, holds up to the reputation as one of the best. I'll be in constant search for this gem.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,feloniousmonk,4.49,"A color as black as night, and a toasty tan head. Strong and seductive aromatics: sweet and candyish, with notes of toffee, anise, and cocoa, and a slightly burnt character that perhaps derives from the higher alcohol. Taste is huge with malt, highly warming (note the ABV), full, rich, and delicious. A perfect aperitif beer. Three things ring above all else: malt, coffee, and caramel. Solid, bold, and loaded with coffeeish flavor. One of the world's greatest brews.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Bruiser81,3.37,"This brew poured dark brown with a deep ruby hue around the edges when held to the light. There was a big fizzy head that disappeared quickly which both surprised and disappointed me. The aroma is sort of tannic with a hint of sweetness and alcohol. Upon first sip I immediately thought this brew was going to be too sweet, however it doesn't finish that way. The middle is of alcohol finishing up with a little bit of hops to balance all that malty sweetness. Overall I was disappointed with this brew especially after all the good reviews. I think I'm starting to notice a trend, I don't care to much for this style of brew.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,CharlesRiver,4.68,"I have been waiting to sample this beer for some time now. Everything looks grand about it. The label, the glass and of course the little plastic medallion that sits around its neck.  Pours very dark brown in color with a 3/4 inch head that seems to last. The smell is sweet, malt, chocolate and honey. One of the first things that I notice---smooth! The taste is earthy, old, metallic, plum and raisin. The aftertaste is more chocolate and it gives that warming feeling.  This might sound odd but it reminds me a lot of Rapscallion Creation.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,nomad,4.5,"So why review this well-known beer? Aw, whatever, its damn good!  Dark night color with a thick head that dissipates quickly - head takes on a tan/dirty cream color leaving some thin lines of stain off of fairly coating lace.  Smells of impressive slightly roasted wheat and malt nose that opens to hearty nuttiness. Something else in the nose that i cant describe  floral as well as pistachio nut.  Some roasted malt on the tongue but mostly a darkened wheat and malt flavor with some creamy tone. The strong point appears to me to be the (seeming) wheatiness that is roasted enough but the pure wheat flavor still exists. Truly, its nothing more than nutty, malty flavors that build on top of each other. You might call it mukry with all those roast and malt flavors, but I find it as delectable, complex, hearty, and drinkable as a doppelbock can get. Sometimes, the bottled version mildly tingles on your tongue, with a taste of a dark cheese with earthy, sour fruitiness to it (?!), but not always. Soft yet thick feel on the tongue that comes along with a sprightly hops bitterness in the high back mouth.  Easily understandable as a described ""world classic."" Drank MUCH BETTER in a small snifter glass as opposed to a stein or large tulip glass.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Quaffer,3.44,"Appearance: This was a very dark beer that showed its true colors when held up to the light: a deep ruby red. The head was rough and tan and dissipated quickly. By the time I was halfway done with the beer, there was no head and not a trace of lace left on the glass.  Smell: The odor of raisins dominated this brew. Overall, it had a heavy, sweet aroma.  Mouthfeel: This beer was full, but not as smooth as I expected or wanted it to be.  Taste: This was a sweet beer, but not overly so. There was a little bit of malt sweetness, but more of a candy sugar taste. I could not detect any hops bitterness at all. There was a mild, sour ""twang"" on the finish.  I have had this beer before and this is pretty much how I remembered it. It is not bad, but I am not overly impressed with it either. I am not a sweet beer lover, or a big doppelbock fan. However, it is probably a good representation of the style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,kunzbrew,4.5,"This beer pours a dark amber color with red hightlights and a tan creamy head that last the duration, leaving a nice creamy sexy lace behind.

The clean finish is great and this has to be one of my favorite styles.  Cheers",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,mickstepp,4.35,"Couldn't believe my good fortune at finding this on tap at a local watering hole. And my timing was fortuitous as the bartender told me it is to be replaced shortly with something more mainstream. Celebrator is a very dark and opaque beer (the lights in the bar were dim so I didn't get as good a look at it as I would have liked) with a thick tawny head. Rich caramel notes in the nose. The taste starts a little sweet but evolves to a dry, nutty, earthy finish as it passes over the tonque. Medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Very creamy and yummy. It is highly regarded by my fellow B.A.'s and deservedly so.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,GreatPondBrewer,3.78,"This was my first experience with bock beer and I cannot say that I regret it at all. It felt thick as it filled my glass and settled a dark color with a little red visible. The head was nice and tan and lasted for a considerable amount of time and then receded into a nice lace that followed the beer to the bottom of the glass. It smelled of damp, smokey wood. the taste was great with some sweet molasses flavors and also some apple flavor, and a carmel finish. It definitely seemed to get sweeter as I neared the end of the pint.  (8/3/03)re-rate after a taste with a more scruitinizing palette. After further tastes I have to say I like Aventinus a fair bit better. After finishing a 6er of it I feel like Celebrator reminds me too much of coca cola.

39,131,NeroFiddled,4.6,"Known as Fortunator (and with an alcohol content of 7.2% by volume) except in the U.S., Ayinger's Doppelbock has become known as one of the classics of the style. Interestingly, one of it's essential ingredients - a light touch of smoked malt - is much more common to the northern region of Franconia than to the area south of Munich where Aying is located. It pours a very deep mahogany with a foamy tan head that holds well. The nose displays a mild smokiness and some toasty breadiness that combines with a touch of alcohol to twist it into a more toffee-ish character. A velvety mouthfeel is derived from a medium body and a very fine carbonation. The flavor offers a luxurious maltiness that's fairly complex with notes of molasses, deeply toasted honey-glazed bread, dried dark fruit, mild leafy hop, and a very subtle smokiness. The rich, and somewhat sweet malt character is exquisitely balanced by a firm bitterness that remains in the wings as it crosses the palate, but then combines with the alcohol to dry out the finish. Some lingering malty notes of caramel and subtle bitter & smoky notes add to it's richness. Overall, a smooth, rich, deceptively strong and warming lager with a drying finish. The alcohol is well-cloaked and the smokiness is quite subtle, just adding a touch of character at the offest and then vanishing amongst the maltiness. Quite enjoyable!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Hobbz,4.95,"Beer exultation. Well, I just finished my beer card at a local institution and what beer by design did I have to save for last? Poured 1/2 bottle with some gusto into a glass to start. Head produced itself with noticeable white-brown foam with rather large bubbles in the mix. Head does not linger long in this guise. Coyly dark, almost blackish color - but held up to a strong light, a most alluring reddish hue becomes evident. Nose is also toying with me! I want so badly to taste... Hints of its alcohol level and sweet maltiness predominate the aroma, with almost a fruity, ""raisiny"" character. An absolute knock-out taste. What I particularly found was how intriguing its character remained with each and every sip! People here who wrote of its ""complexity"" are dead-on. Discerning the range of subtle flavors with its perfect balance was not an ephemeral experience, especially considering that alcohol at this level can overpower. Very exceptional & true to -- and a paragon of -- its brewing style. Like dancing with goats!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Not as overly malty and sweet as some of this style, and ultimately quite drinkable. Pours a quite impressive glass of beer. Virtually black, huge head initially (watch for the ""over-pour""!), foamy lace remains throughout. Dark, expresso-like flavor, chocolate notes, but not excessive.

The Celebrator is a truly remarkable beer that is both lively and incredibly smooth in the same offering and should easily rank amongst the highest beer offerings available.  It pours exceptionally dark, giving off a great big carmel toned head which gives way to solid surface foam coverage, a strong collar and great lacing on the glass. Its is quite oily, yet creamy and pleasing to the palette and despite usually a beer pegged for the spring, I find it makes for a suprinsingly good warming beer for these (El Nino influenced) winter months.  Hints of toffee, coffee and caramel come through in the aroma and are right there on the palette in drinking, as too are some spicey hints and a raisiny sort of texture.

I knew right away that Belgian ale would never be a favorite, so goes with this. The beer was dark and seemed to have tinges of red, kind of a medium porter look. Head went adios in seconds and absolutely no lace to be found as the glass was drained. Smell was strong and sweet with toffee overtones. Taste was very sweet yet smooth, malt dominating. Thick mouthfeel is as I assume is right for this style, drinkability is O.K., but I can't see taking this style up regularly.

Smell: Nose of sweet malt, dry fruit, molasses, caramel, raisons, and hops. A touch of alcohol too. Massive aroma here...  Taste: Where do I start? There's all of the flavors from the aroma, plus a slight bready flavor. Bitter chocolate. I notice a touch of alcohol on the end, along with a small roasted note. The smallest bit of hop flavor shows up too. Very complex...  Mouthfeel: Fairly thick with an oily mouthfeel. Finishes round and full, with lots of residual sugars adding body. Very nice.  Drinkability: Top of the class. This is an outstanding doppelbock that's worth every penny you pay for it. Sure it's fairly strong alcohol-wise, but walking's overrated anyway...

For the mouthful that each sip delivers it presents a heavy caramel, sweet plum, at the same time a pleasant driness if that makes sense. A very complex, but at the same time extraordinary offering that stands up to all standards of a great double bock. After how drinkable it was on tap, I can't wait to try it in a bottle to compare.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,jtw5877,4.5,"Pours a deep brownish red with a decent tan head. Smells like malty goodness, deep chocolate, coffee, caramel, tastes and aroma. Straight Up solid tasty one heck of a beer. At a time in my life when I feel like a slave to hops its nice to have malt sneak up and slap me across the face. A really good beer. My gratitude goes out to StevieW for turning me on to this stuff.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Realale,4.29,"Very deep reddish brown - its shading toward black (my wife asked if it was a Porter!). Big small-bubbled head settles somewhat slowly to a small ring of foam.  Nose is all about malt. A rich slightly sweet maltiness predominates, but there are supporting notes of prune, molasses, and burnt sugar. Very complex.  In the mouth, it disappoints a bit, but only when compared to the stunning nose. All of the maltiness is there, and prunes, etc. show up again, but it seems a bit hollow in the mid-palate, and could use a bit more carbonation to keep it lively. It is surprisingly light, and the malty sweetness is not over-powering at all.  The finish is nice and well integrated, with the burnt sugar note keeping the malt in check.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Lupe,4.58,"I like the goat trinket, could make a nice ornament on the tree.  Wonderful appearance. Pours almost back, some dark red hues. Huge tan head that settles into a nice sheet and sticks to the glass. Different aromas come through with no single one dominating: toffee, chocolate, toasted malt, carmel and rum scents are all present. Thick and full bodied with a silky smooth and creamy mouthfeel.  Flavor is very complex. Starts sweet with some molasses, chocolate, and toffee, then comes a bready taste. Some fruity flavors come through, kind of like green apple. A little hop presence is noted and helps it from being overly sweet. Finishes a bit dry with a slightly sugary aftertaste.  This brew is delicious. Thick and chewy, easy to drink - especially for a doppelbock. Wonderful complexity. Highly enjoyable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,DerKaiser,4.15,"Okay, finally time to review Celebrator. It pours just a shade off black with a fluffy tan head. A really dark doppelbock. The scent is really heavenly, with strong notes of toffee and burnt caramel.  The flavor profile is almost identical to the scent. Smooth toffee flavor with caramel as well. Roasted chewy malt upfront and Ripe green apples in the undertones. Ever so slight bitterness in the finish balances out the sweet toffee flavors. A superbly balanced beer, and quite complex as well.  I'm probably in the overwhelming minority on this, but if confronted with the choice, I'd take Paulaner's Salvator Doppelbock over the Celebrator. Nevertheless, Celebrator is clearly one of the finer beers made. It's wonderfully crafted and a must try for anyone that enjoys quality beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BeerManDan,4,"When poured it was a very dark brown with very little foam. The first impression I got when smelling this beer was of malts, prunes and caramel. The taste was the same and the aroma with the addition of it being sort of a sweet thick and creamy. The only set back was after a short time the flavor on the palate when north and the well balanced bitterness lingered. Still one of my favorite Doppelbocks.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Ueberales,4.9,"An outstanding beer that defines the dopplebock style. Powerful malty nose with a crystal clear deep red appearance. No hop aroma to speak of, although there is sufficient bittering hops to balance perfectly the malt bill. Feels smooth as silk, but the high alcohol and fullness definitely make this a beer for sipping and savoring instead of the centerpiece of a drinking session.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BeerGlassesCollector,4.5,"Pours deep brown colour topped by a beautiful thick head. The aroma of the beer is chocolate, coffee and caramel hints. The taste of this fine doppelbock is malty and moderate caramel flavour. Celebrator Doppelbock, in my opinion, one of the FINEST German Doppelbock Style beer",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Jason,4.53,"11.2 oz brown bottle with a plastic trinket goat tied around the neck. No freshness date, not to worry as this brew has a longer shelf life that normal beers.  Appearance: Dark and intense looking of a mahogany colour, a big frothy tan head lays on top that literally sticks around as long as the beer is there.  Smell: Whiffs of mild molasses and faint caramel entanlge with a dark bready aroma. Slight spicy alcohol, herbal hop and light toasted malt as well.  Taste: Huge chewy malt of light molasses and toasted bread with a sharp twang of an even hop bitterness and spicy alcohol. Some dried fruit comes through as well as some hop leaf flavour. Does not dry much in the end ... lots of residual sugars, lingering dark sugars and fading grain in the end.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly smooth and creamy the modest carbonation after a sturdy pouring struggles to break free from this thick bodied brew.  Drinkability & Notes: This is the mother of all Doppelbocks ... nearly perfection in a bottle. Mellow yet towering, humbly complex and just a down right beautiful brew.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,doho95fu,4.32,"The color is deep brown and the head is thick and tan. The beer smells of outmeal, brown sugar, coffee and caramel. The taste is malty with a caramel flavor. The beer is very smooth, drinkable but with a slight aftertaste of alcohol.  I do not have a tremendous amount of experience with this style of beer, but this must be a great example of one.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,maxpower,4.87,"Dark brown-black color, creamy tan head, roasty chocolate aroma, creamy silky mouthfeel, soft on the palate. Tastes of caremel, chocolate and toffe, this is the standard for great dopplebocks, none better.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Popsinc,5,"A classic of it's style. Deep and rich in colour. Hints of chocolate & roasted oates. A dry, warm finish, this beer is simply the perfect cold weather beer. I wouldn't go through a winter without it.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Kwak,4.97,"Celebrator Doppelbock The mocha head had a toffieish malt flavor, it came on strong and stayed their for a while. Nice strong body a little oily and almost thick with a bite of spices and an almost warming effect. The aftertaste was verry dry with a big malty taste",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Viking,4.51,"It's easy to understand why this is the #1 beer on BA (as of 05Nov02). This is one outstanding doppel! Pours to a deep dark reddish-brown, with a thick tan head that I've rarely seen on a lager-style beer. Excellent head retention. Aroma of rich sweet malt, with hints of raisin and toffee, with some faint chocolate notes thrown in for good measure. Rich sweet malty taste, full of toffee and hints of chocolate and raisin. Smooth, chewey, creamy mouthfeel. This beer, truly, is a meal in and of itself!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,mjohn27603,4.87,"First, I made sure I bought the single with the goat charm bracelet around the neck. This is like getting a Cracker Jack toy in a beer. Very dark brown in appearance, I couldn't see through the glass when I held it up to the light. Very sweet in aroma reminds me of molasses or brown sugar. First sip - sweet! sweet! Toffee, coffee, molasses. The mouthfeel of mercury (I'm guessing because I've never drank mercury!). I'm picking up a little bit of hops. This is good but I couldn't have more than one or two. Yummy. A bit of roasted aftertaste.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,aaronh,4.43,"Deep mahongany, almost black beer that pours with a thick head the color of wet sand. The head retention is great on this beer, and it leaves a very pleasant lace on the glass. The aroma is complex and sweet. Raisin and chocolate scents are most pronounced. The taste is also nicely complex, with malt, bittersweet chocolate and a thick, fruity sweetness predominating. There is a nice bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is very smooth, and it coats the tongue nicely. I only purchased one, but I could easily drink a couple. It tastes so good that it is tough to be patient and savor this beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Jon,4.82,"Overrated? I think not. Celebrator pours a deep, dark ruby color with a massive tan head. Leaves nice lace all the way down the glass. The nose is quite diverse with notes of raisins, chocolate, alcohol and a hint of coffee. Notes of sweet maltiness, caramel, chocolate and a nutty flavor reign in the taste department. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and creamy. Drinkability is up there with the best of them, as well. A magnificent, world-class beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,hobbes2112,4.83,"After looking at the reviews for weeks, and then the $13.99 price tag for 6 12oz. bottles....I finally tried this wonderful creation. Plain and simple, this is beer at its best. I don't know all the fancy terms...but people before me have described this beer well. Buy this beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,jackndan,3.93,"Celebrator Doppelbock: In a bottle, with a small plastic goat hanging from the neck. Deep ruby/black color, with good clarity when held up to the light. The head was thick and rich, with a deep chocolate brown color. The aroma is strong, of cocoa, and raisons. The taste is rich and very nice, and to my taste, seems like a mix of raisons and sweet chocolates. There was a spicy hop bite, which balances the strong malt tastes. There is a nice chocolate richness in the aftertaste, which makes this a great after dinner beer. Some alcohol warmth. I enjoyed this beer very much, but I am a little taken aback that this fine beer rests at number one. Quite frankly, it wasn&#8217;t the best beer I had this weekend.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,MaineBeerMan,4.82,"Super dark brown color with a big brownish head, held to light reveals ruby red color. Head settled to a ring that left surprisingly little lace. Unbelievable aroma with lots of caramel maltiness, raisins, figs and molasses smells. One of the best smelling beers I have ever tried. Big malt flavor, plenty of toasty caramel sweetness, some dark chocolate and light notes of raisins and fig, all balanced out with a nice hop bitterness. Big mouthfeel that matches the flavor, this is a very rich beer that I don't think I could drink a lot of at once. Finishes rather dry, but even at the end some of the malt sweetness comes through. A great beer, and I can see why it's currently #1 although it's not my personal ideal beer. This would be a great dessert beer, but it seemed too rich (and too expensive) for everyday drinking.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,boblinneman,4.65,"I was expecting a sweeter brew while I watched the cascade. Great head! Smell was apparent immediately, although rather one dimentional. Loved the hoppy flavor that followed the initial malty/caramelness. Silky smooth with crispy carbonation. Very drinkable O very drinkable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,hyuga,4.72,"Very dark brown with a nice tan head topping it off. The head subsides to a thin ring after a while. Huge sweet raisin and plum aroma with a hint of spiciness. Kind of bready. Fig is also present with the other fruits. A taste brings even more pleasure. Hops are noticeable, but stand back and let the malt rush in, which is, again, very sweet and spicy. Massive caramel, slightly toasted, and subtle hopping. Spicy dried fruit in the middle, reminds me a bit of a dubbel. Nice full body. Smooth yet prickly mouthfeel. A bit more than mildly acidic. A slightly metallic flavor in the background, but that fades as it warms. A grain-malty, but surprisingly dry finish. This doppelbock is spicier than its competitors, which I believe is one of the things that makes it better than a lot of them. An excellent brew, one of the kings of its style.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,mzwolinski,4.87,"What a huge beer. This is what to give your friends if they think lagers are for sissies.  The beer is black, with just a hint of ruby when backlit. Thick, tan, creamy head.  Wonderful aroma -- reminiscent of bitter dark chocolate, with hints of toffee and fruit -- prunes and fig.  This is a very full-bodied beer. Heavy, sweet malty flavor with more fruit esters and a hint of baked bread. The finish is superb -- slightly hoppy and dry, with a nice aftertaste from the residual sugars.  Really a terrific beer. Best bock I've ever had. The bottle even comes with a little goat toy for the kids. Something for everyone!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,cokes,4.53,"$16.00 per six pack. I'd buy it again tomorrow. Pours as deep a ruby-orange as possible. Basically black. Large tan head sit royally atop. Glorious. Heavy bready and dark fruit aromas. Akin to toasted raisins. Taste starts off somewhat roasted. Almost stout-like. This instantly subsides with the incoming fruity brigade. Figs, grapes, raisins, plums...it is all here. Quite complex. Turns more bready towards the middle, with fresh-baked sweet bread notes. Finish is dried out with a touch of spicy hops...extremely subtle, but very effective. Moderately thick in the mouth. Not as huge as some, but quite solid, and oh-so-smooth. Everything besides the price points to drinking this in bulk. Go ahead and treat yourself to some euphoria.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,beernut7,3.68,"I drained the local liquor store of every other brand and style of beer so I figured I'g give this brew a swing and see what the hype was all about. Pours a deep black with a foamy thick tan head. Aromas of bready and dark German malts. Light chocolate and heavy sweet malt is the initial flavor with a clean syrupy finish. I am not usually a big fan of the style and this bock doesn't really change my opinion. Not bad, but not impressive for the hefty price tag.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,TheLongBeachBum,4.97,"Saw the reviews so I had to try this. WOW!!!!. It cost me $2.20 a bottle, so I only got One to try. The Label itself is enough to justify the purchase. Poured with a huge browny-fluffy head full of large bubbles. Took a second or two to settle down, but kepts its head to the end. Huge nose, superb malty aromas that reminded me of the air outside when the local Brewery back in England were brewing their Stout. Caramel, small hint of dark chocolate, with soft smooth rounded malty flavors that are very morish. Very dark brown colour with some lucidity. Really full-bodied, with almost a rich toffee, syrupy aftertaste that lasts. This is a very good dark beer, with a deserved reputation. I am getting a 6-pack next time, blow the cost !. AWESOME !!!!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Dogbrick,5,"Somehow I managed to find this beer on draught here in Columbus (at the Refectory). There simply cannot be a beer that I will enjoy more than this.  Served at a perfect temperature. Unbelievably easy to drink, with a light smooth malty flavor that was not too sweet. Balanced perfectly by the alcohol ratio. Just a whisper of chocolate in the aroma and flavor as well. Very dark with a medium thick beige head that diminished rather quickly, but who cares, because it was between me and this amazing beer. Now I am working on getting the Celebrator glasses from the restaurant after the beer is out of rotation.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,Mick,5,"This is the Mercedes Benz of Dopplebocks. Truly an outstanding beer. An alluring brown/tan/mocha color that invites the upper lip to investigate it a little further. A noseful of the caramel/cocoa aroma that these types are lusted for. Great taste that is synonymous with the scent, only amplified. It holds a bold presence as its body commands and navigates it's way past you palate and around your tongue. Superb!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,putnam,4.5,"What an intense noseful of beer! Classic ""American"" roast coffee with great beans to start with. Some really slow-ripening, high-elevation little coffee cherries roasted to dark tan perfection...still with all of their plant flavors: fruit, tartness and caramel...and that's the nose. The flavors are very sound, if a somewhat compressed version of what the nose offers. Sweet horse manure appears on the the re-whiff. Chamise texture. Pillowy and light. The finish is medium in length and simplifies as it goes. A beer to contemplate.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,proc,4.37,"Excellent. The aroma alone with its scent of choclolate and coffee is outstanding. This beer truly has a mouthfeel to it. It not quite right to describe it as ""thick"", but it has a substantial presence. A wonderful beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

Rather powerful. Warm on the tongue with lovely intricate flavors that matches the aroma... plenty of licorice and roasted malts, the alcohol is noticeable as well. It is a very smooth drink, low carbonation, full-bodied. A hearty delight!  This is the best Doppelbock... Id highly recommend enjoying one of these... it's Fantastic!!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,ryanocerus,4.35,"I thought this was a very drinkable beer. It poured a very dark brown with very thick head, which ups the appearance. The chocolate malt aroma carried through into the flavor. An excellent doppelbock.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,jreitman,4.5,Really dark brown with a tan head. Very interesting and complex aroma profile. Malty with no significant trace of bitterness.

Truly a great beer.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,BitteBier,4.57,"Pours with uniform darkness and compact head that lingers longer than expected, though not for too long. Smell (toffee et al.) is exceptional and complex, and the taste is even more complex. Flavors are numerous but well-balanced. While this is a characteristically heavy beer, I found myself saying ""one more drink"" (over and over) just to decode what is so wonderful about it. To date, this is my single favorite beer. One more drink...",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Pegasus,4.53,"Stunning visual appearance with a sable color and a thick tan head and lots of lace. Beer roils briefly when properly poured, providing a spectacular introduction. Wonderful aromas of caramel, coffee, hops, and alcohol. Tasting yields flavors of caramel and toasted malts, hops, slight dark fruits.

39,131,aracauna,3.91,"Very dark beer. In fact if you just saw it sitting in the glass you'd probably mistake it for a porter as light only gets through around the edges (when it does, it gives a nice red wine color). The head is a thick, lumpy foam that's a medium tan color. Unfortunately, mine seemed a bit skunky, but I could pick up some good malt aromas with the slightest hint of hops. The aroma was big, but not as big as the appearance would suggest. Caramel, bitterness from the dark-colored malts and some fruitiness I can't place my finger on. This was all followed up by a bit of grassy hops. I also picked up a little black pepper, but it was faint enough, I'm not sure if I was just tasting things.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Wildman,4.25,"Okay, I am a fan of dark beers and I have to agree with alot of other people that this is the best doppelbock out there. It has a wonderful dark color and lovely aroma to it. The body is great and the taste is wonderful.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,marc77,4.52,"Deep ruby hue and very clear. The tan head is thick and well retained. The rich malt aroma is comprised of sweet buttery toffee, nutty peanut brittle, vanilla notes and mild toasty dark Munich malt. The malt profile is luscious-- heavily caramelized sugars are combined w/ roasted grain notes that are above the norm for style. It's lighter in body than Spatens or Paulaners, but the depth of malt character surpasses either of those. There's more roasted grain and chocolate flavors in this brew and less residual sweetness. The hop bitterness, although subdued, complements the light roasted grain bitterness to balance the malt sweetness. It finishes surprisingly dry and roasty for a doppelbock. Celebrator is delicious, flavorful, yet highly drinkable.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,DarthMalt,2.73,"I was not very impressed by this beer. Being a big fan of d-bocks, I was ready to be taken away, but instead, I just sort of sat there, looking at the beer, wondering what all the fuss was about. Instead of a masterpiece in comlexity and depth, this beer had the sort of 2D, flavor-by-numbers that you often get with domestic brewpub styles. It was dark and smoky like a stout, and boozy like a double bock.  There is this ""classic"" double bock flavor which I have come to expect now from any d-bock. I don't know if this quintessential flavor lies in the type of malt used, the hops, some sort of decoction mashing, or what, but the one thing I do know is that, I know it when I taste it. Sadly, Celebrator does not have it. Neither does Sam Adams, btw.  The only six I have had, so far, which exude the ""classic"" double bock flavor are:  Allgauer Cambonator Tucher Bajuvator St. Martin Dunkler Paulaner Slavator Spaten Optimator Augustiner Maximator  ----  PS - I also thought the little billy goats dangling around the bottlenecks--while cute--were a little hokey.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,inebrius,4.45,"Pours dark and vivid with a frothy liquid malt-ball head. Nose is buttered malt toast heaped with blackberry jam. Sweet malts and hops rival for your attention while a citric tang does play-by-play on the back of your tongue. Iron out the mouthfeel some and this brew would be hard to set down, ever. I'm left sucking on the plastic goat that adorned the bottle, wishing I had more Celebrator.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,StevieW,4.78,"I think this is the tops for me. Pours a deep dark brown, almost black with a picture perfect fluffy tan head. It looked just like the label. Nice rich smell, I noticed alot toffee, burnt smells, didn't notice they were fruit, like others. But the smell was very inviting. The taste lived up to everything I have read. Nice toffee, carmel like sweetness, very balanced with bitterness of roasted malt. Nice smooth feel, almost creamy, and full, everything I hoped it would be. I thought it fuller and more balanced, not as syrupy than the Salvator dopplebock. The last shot of bittnerness at the end, wanted you to have another taste to balance. Beer Perfection.

This is a pretty balanced doppelbock...it is not as super thick or super sweet as some of the others I have tried(SA, Salvator, etc)...It has some earthiness to it and a spicy, dry finish...dark cocoa on the buds with a hint of plums...very easy drinking and a medium body...  My idea of a great doppel is a super thick, super sweet, over-the-top monster of flavor...this one falls short in that regard, but it is good in its own right. It is just a little different style.  A very good beer, but overpriced. I would rather have a SA anyday particularly when considering the cost..",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Bighuge,4.34,"This beer goes ""Glug, glug, glug"" as you pour it. It lays out a hefty tannish brown head that has some staying power. Color is very dark ruby, but not black. Aroma is wonderful. Incredibly intense malt tones and a nice sweetness detected. Taste is good, but a little lighter than I expected. Note that I said, ""lighter than expected."" This beer does have some depth and complexity. But the body is not as heavy as I expected either. Don't get me wrong, this is a great brew. Great tastes of molasses and sweet malt. A nice yeasty flavor. Some breadiness. No hops detected, but there must be some to balance the malt load of this. This is in the elite class of Doppels in my opinion (along with Bell's Consecrator, Spaten Optimator, Sammy Adams and Sprecher).",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

A full, rocky, tan head that faded a bit more quickly than I would have liked (though residual foam remained throughout the glass, so I'm not complaining too much). Aroma of toffee, caramel, and burnt dark fruits (raisins, dates, prunes). First sip put me off a bit -- there was a slight metallic tang that I didn't expect, but it quickly went away as I adjusted to the beer. Complex combination of malty sweet, toffee flavors, slight hop bitterness, and burnt fruit. Medium carbonation that leaves a tingling sensation on the tongue. Spicy, dry finish. For the money, I'd rather have a Salvator or Sammy's DB, but this is a great doppel nonetheless.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

An outstanding Doppelbock! Much like Salvatore and Maximator, very similar.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Thrasher,4.6,"Superb. Hot diggity. This stormy-looking brew lurks under a healthy dark tan head. With the first sip, the malts explode across the tongue. Robust, but actually quite sweet, featuring a rich buttery toffee overcoat, with caramel and hints of anise. Despite its syrupy consistency, the mouthfeel is trademark Ayinger: soft, cushiony, and begging to be sipped. This expertly balanced beer is truly a pleasure to get lost in, although perhaps too thick and sticky for true indulgence.

Superb roasty, malty, chocolate aromas abound... Pretty full-bodied, and pleasantly smooth over the tongue. Exhibits a rich, semi-sweet, roasty, bitter chocolate flavor. Not as sweet as Salvi or Sammy... but A-1 in its own right! Verrry drinkable!!! Zum Wohl!!  overall: 4.5 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 4.5  *** ***  On-tap review of 10MAR02... This baby on draft has a nice dark brown to almost black color, with a small creamy head. I pick up notes of bitter chocolate in the nose. Real nice fullness and smoothness. Taste is super, but a bit more on the bitter side than Salvator or Sammy. Nice flavor with the roasty chocolate finish. Goes down well! (4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5 = 4.5)  Prosit!  70",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,hooligan,4.32,"Nice bottle with a little plastic ram on a string around the neck, pours to a beautiful black with a thick lacy head, smells like warm grains, almost toasty, with some alcoholic notes. The taste is very smooth, with an excellent grain character, hints of caramel, and just enough bitterness in the background to clean up the sweet malt. This is an excellent beer.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Jordan,5,"Huge efferescent whiffs of cocoa's and alchohal's and hard toffee candy. Frothy and lumpy pale tan head, deep dark brown with a tint of dark red. Full body, creamy silky smooth texture. Slight roasted caramel and brown sugars on the palate. Quiet whispers of a bitter hops presense.  Compared to Optimator and Salvator, Celerbrator Doppelbock is much more mellow. Soothing to the touch, and relaxing to drink. Truely exceptional.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,QXSTER1,4.88,"I sought this out due to it's superlative reviews on the site and wasn't disappointed. Chewy is an adjective that always escaped me but this beer brought the sensation home. Not as sweet as I imagined it would be, but perfectly balanced and full-bodied. Had this on tap and can't wait for the next one!",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,budgood1,5,"the most wonderful smelling beer i've ever had. smooth, creamy, huge malt profile with chocolate/caramel/fruity/woody undertones...tastes absolutely spectacular and warms all the way down. words can't explain what my senses are experiencing. it's fabulous.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,beerluvr,5,"Can't think of anything I don't like about this one...simply the best dopplebock I've had the pleasure to quaff! Gotta love those little plastic goat thingys...used to have a collection of them, why? I dunno. Reccomended stuff.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96

39,131,bk3nj,4.7,"An excellent beer, but a little bit overhyped, I think. I (slightly) prefer Spaten Optimator, but that's just me.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Brent,5,The classic example of the style to which all others should aspire. Robust and powerful without being overpowering.,Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
39,131,Todd,4.85,"I am not at all religious, but I think I might have found religion in this bottle of Celebrator Doppelbock that I am drinking. Complex, delicious and worthy of its following.",Ayinger Privatbrauerei,Germany,Doppelbock,96
