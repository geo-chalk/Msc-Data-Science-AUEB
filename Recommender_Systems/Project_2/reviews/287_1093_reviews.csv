287,1093,tekstr1der,4.16,"Finally found this fresh, canned only a couple of weeks ago. It's very tasty old school IPA as expected. Perhaps a bit thin and watery, which, given the ABV, should not have been an issue. I'll have to seek out the double version of this as well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Mightythor2000,4.85,"The secrets out on two hearted IPA. Living spitting distance from Bell’s brewing I never realized how amazing two hearted is. As I branched out and tried other varieties of IPAs, and really all ales, I would always say good but not as good as two hearted. Inevitably I’d come right on back.  I think where two hearted really knocks it out of the park is balance. The flavor is hoppy but incredibly smooth. You get nice citrus notes but it doesn’t taste like someone added orange. Bold and full flavor, but delightfully drinkable. Strong, but not too strong at 7% abv. Good poured into a glass or straight out of the bottle. Overall it’s my perfect beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BrewMaven,4.22,"Hazy deep gold with a whopping three finger white head that is very slow to drop and leaves good lace. Very balanced aroma and flavor for a non- double IPA . also has an exceptionally heavy mouth feel for this single IPA very enjoyable, and has been a repeat buy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,LiquidAmber,4.21,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a half finger white head that dissipates to patches with light lacing. Aroma of dry caramel malt, piney and citrus hops, pine needles, tangerine, faint mixed light stone fruit. Flavor is dry caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, pine needles, grapefruit and undifferentiable citrus. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. Like a step back in time, reminiscent of old fashioned craft IPAs with a quite West Coast hop bill. My favorite malt favor of caramel hops backed by citrus and pine from the hops. The hop herbal character is muted, but typical of the generation this came from; however the pine and citrus are great. Bitterness is moderate, but satisfactory. This is one of the classic IPAs that's been on my ""try"" list for decades and it doesn't disappoint. Now that Bell's appears to be available in the Northwest, I'll be revisiting this one again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,wanmei_xiatian,4.41,"Smell: citrus Taste: It starts off clean and crisp. It makes me wondering where is that typical fragrant and flavorful taste of the hops in the IPA. After a second or two, it follows up with slight bitterness. The bitterness balance quite well with the fruity flavor in the drink. All the flavors and bitterness keep aggregating and kind of blow up in my mouth from the third to four sip.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,NorsemanOne,4.25,"Purchased from Whole Foods in Highland Village, TX  Silky smooth, balanced clean and sharp hops and perfume floral aroma  Easy drinking and sessionable",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Tcricci220,4.77,"Outstanding balance. Pours a beautiful reddish color that has a head that's not huge but is retained well Starts off with a sweet burst of malt which quickly transitions to a clean, crisp bitterness, which then turns into a burst of grapefruit. Medium bodied and just all around perfectly balanced. Great beer! Glad it's readily available",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,KenjiN,4.02,"I loved this brew in the late 90s, when IPAs were more my thing. I'm quite burnt out on the style today. However, it's got an orange color and a large off-white head. Nose is pungent with American hops. The beer is extremely fruity on the palate and medium-bodied in mouthfeel.  Though I avoid most IPAs today, I still like this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,buzzard13,4.83,"In my opinion one of the best commercially available beers in the US. I’ve had in cans, bottles and now a 1/4 keg. Just outstanding. A delicious pale ale from start to finish. Especially good on tap at 37 degrees.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,verge,4.51,"It's rare to find an IPA that's extremely flavorful but not so much that it sacrifices drinkablity. This is that beer. Perfectly balanced. I wish I could taste this side-by-side with Pliny the Elder, because that's another perfectly balanced beer...I think this one is more sessionable though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Martin194,4.5,"Look: Cloudy gold with an off-white head.  Smell: Hops and toasty malts.  Taste: Follows smell. As others have mentioned, this one has a little more to it than some pale ales, which are so dry and heavy on the hops; it's got a nice balance of bitter hops with sweeter malts.  Feel: Medium body, normal carbonation.  Overall: Very easy drinking. It's a popular brew and for good reason!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TerryW,3.88,"Clear amber under a moderate head. Settles to a full cap, substantial lace along the way. Gentle grassy hops on the nose. Taste is of toasty malts and grassy hops. Slightly sweet, followed by just the right amount of bitterness. Overall quite drinkable without any rough edges. Compentant stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Arttooo,4.29,"This is a beer where I think the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. All the individual aspects are really good, but not amazing. When I'm drinking two hearted without thinking about these individual characteristics, I absolutely love it. Sometimes it's a little bit too much punch of flavor for what I'm looking for, but that's only occasionally.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ommegangpbr,3.68,"Canned on 9/21/2022. I've had this several times over the years and was surprised to find I never reviewed it. I'm not sure if it is this batch or an improperly stored pack but this is not drinking quite as I last remember. It is still pretty fresh at two months old so I doubt a lot could have happened to it but anyway: Amber in color and not much head formation in my goblet. Tastes lighter and more enjoyable, to me from the glass than straight from the can. I'm getting smoky and toasty notes that I don't recall from Two Hearted Ale previously. Getting more amber and red ale notes than I remember. Biscuit sweetness and black tea bitterness. Not my favorite style of IPA. I will have to see if I find another batch somewhere and compare these notes.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JayDubTrub,2.8,"A perfectly average American IPA, maybe a little subaverage...maybe I have Covid given this is supposed to be a legend. It reminds me of Dales malt/body/finish, but getting little to no aroma or taste up front. Just a bitter hop finish that smothers the malt which id like to taste.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,SWOhio-aquifer,4.25,So many good ipas now. Back in early 2000 this was one of the few greats. And I will argue it was even better then. Probably nostalgia on my part thinking so. Have revisited it lately hoping for a balanced strong malt presence as most IPA's are just to dam dry and hoppy. This is still a really good balanced ipa and I wonder with its popularity (I can get it at a no name gas station nearby and I'm not in MI) how bells still executes on a old classic,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DrOfGolf,4.5,"Poured out a golden color with a white head. The smell is of hops, hops, and hops. The flavor is very good and what you expect in a first class beer. I will be definitely drinking a few more of them in my future.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Spike,4.18,"12oz can. L: Clear amber with two fingers of off-white foam that recedes quickly to a cap, leaving a few spots of lacing. S: Light, autumnal aroma. T: A nutty, malty base with earthy but clean, citrus & pine Centennial. Bitterness is moderate F: Rich, smooth and oily mouthfeel. Carbonation is a light spritz. Dry finish. O: A classic, old skool AIPA. Still fantastic. Not particularly astringent, not overly resinous, not juicy, just very nicely balanced. Would drink loads of this… if it wasn’t so damn alcoholic.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Hobbs87,4.32,Tracked this after reading that it unseat Pliny the Elder in an overall rank. Had it after Pliny and thought it was slightly better. Readily available and not pricey. Enjoyable beer. Definitely one of the better beers that I’ve tasted though not overwhelming in any way. Solid good beer and would easily recommend.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TurboMon_911,4.56,"Pours a semi clear amber color from a 12oz. bottle into a Samuel Smith Pint glass. Two fingers high head that lingers, visible carbonation and loads of lacing. Aroma is hoppy and malty all at once. Flavor is bitter throughout with a firm malt backbone. Medium in body and just outstanding over all. A definite classic and quite happy that they are now a mainstay locally after many years of trying to get outside of the Michigan area.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,JesseJames81,4.22,"Appearance: beautiful amber color.  Aroma: caramel malts, citrus fruit and pine resin. Slightly biscuity.  Taste: Dark fruit and citrus with a malty background. Some nutty characteristics. Clean finish.  Overall. This is a crisp, clean, enjoyable IPA. Reminds me of an Amber ale with IPA qualities. Well done.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,LucidoMMA,4.04,"Porous a transparent amber color with a one finger thick retentive head. Only aroma I can really pick up is hops. Taste is..... Hops, hops, hops. Can't really pick up any malts in this just delicious hops. Medium bodied with a mild fish.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JackpineSavage,4.68,"One of our Michigan beers, this is a staple, every party store and gas station has it, I like IPAs, this is bitter, I like that, it stays on the tongue, I like that..... If you like this, try Huma Lupa Licius by Shorts.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ReverendSoup,4.54,"American IPAs are rarely my first pick, but I think it's because I find myself wishing that every other American IPA was this one. Gorgeous hazy amber color, and foams and laces beautifully- it's a very good looking beer. If it were a person I'd buy it a pint of itself. Smells piney. Actually drinking it does not disappoint. Flavor's got layers- good hops, pleasant little grapefruit and pine notes, all backed up by good malt. As for mouthfeel, it's good. I almost wish it was a little less carbonated, but would never suggest messing with the delicate balance of a beer so close to perfect. I'm a big fan.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DCH,4.17,"Look is dark orange/amber, smell is of candied orange, hop resin, slight pine. Taste is more of the candied orange and hop bitterness. Really solid IPA, definitely a unique taste on this one in regards to the soft orange taste, very west coast IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MadMadMike,4.3,"Pint can poured into a DuClaw Brewing pint glass at fridge temp. Amber/gold color, slight haze, fantastic foam. Using a distinct single hop (Centennial), Two Hearted Ale has a delicate orange blossom citrus aroma, assertive but well-balanced bitterness, and a lovely supporting crystal malt base. Great everyday beer. Goes well with anything.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,TacticalKris,5,"Age: 4 months from packaging.  Look: A Touch hazy, not crystal clear. Amber in color and beautiful head of lacey foam.  Smell: Malty hops. Pleasant.  Taste: The surprising malty background blew me away. I love a good malt but to see it shine in a IPA was kind of nuts. I enjoy the taste. The malt and hops are balanced well.  Feel: The lingering malt feel on the tongue is pleasent. There is not a bitter bite to it like you would expect, its there but not enough that you couldn't session this beauty.  Overall: I love it really. Its going in my rotation. What Ive found is that after some hazy beer, double IPA, etc, throwing this malty IPA in the mix just completes the circle. Its great. Thanks Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DarkLordScott,3.34,"Pours a hazy, deep yellow with very good carbonation and a light, airy head. Aroma is citrus and pine, with perhaps a very slight hint of grapefruit. Taste is light, largely bright, perfectly balanced between bitter and refreshing. The citrus comes through strongly, followed by pine.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,CobraChicken,3.59,"I’ll start by saying that I am NOT an IPA guy. I’ve tried a few but just cannot appreciate whatever is going on with that. However, I heard the hype on this and wanted to give it a short. My initial smell is heavy of pine and citrus with just a hint of malt. The flavor is the same. I get a pleasant pine taste and it reminds me of a chilly fall morning sitting in a tree stand waiting for a buck to walk by. The finish has a mild malt flavor and a medium dry finish. It’s not too bad and the only IPA I’ve been able to stomach. I bought a 6pack just for my own edification, in hopes of understanding the genre better.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,nizzle8287,4.9,"L: Hazy golden nectar with a small white head that dissipates into a film and a ring around the glass. S: Yeast rolls, caramel, citrus fruit, pine resin, all the hallmarks of the best American IPAs. T: Same as smell, but way more intense, as the bitterness is incredibly pronounced, as it should be with an IPA. Pine resin is popping out here. F: Carbonation on the high side, but between that and the bitterness, the alcohol is very well masked. Medium heavy body. O: Fantastic old-school IPA that isn't overly fruity or sweet. Highly recommend to everyone who wants a world-class IPA with no BS.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,LukeCov49,4.38,"Great overall IPA  L: pours golden/ light amber with a little over a finger of thick rocky foam. Hazy/cloudy  S: citrus and hoppy pine are the strongest notes some malt  T: following the smell I got a light of lemon water taste at colder temps and as it warmed up I got a nice hop bitterness and a good malt body. Overall pine and citrus are the strongest with a nice hint of spice and malt.  F: perfect carbonation, good mouth feel. Definitely not watery but feels a little lighter than other IPAs I’ve had recently",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,NeilSilber1,4.51,"Pours golden with slight amber color and white fluffy cap. Subtle back notes of spice, cinnamon, and grapefruit give this huge IPA an incredibly unique signature punch without throwing the hop forward ipa out of balance from its nicely layered malty backbone. Amazing IPA brew!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,RealAgentSRK,4.76,"Being from Michigan I always just considered Two Hearted another option besides your Buds and Millers, albeit a slightly more expensive and tasty brew. It was the beer we had our older siblings buy us when we had something to celebrate (or lament).  Now that I'm older and my pallet is more refined I find myself always returning to this old staple. For some reason I still expect to try some new (to me) IPA and be blown away by how much better it is than Two-Heart. Well, I've tried quite a few and so far nothing has surpassed or even equaled the Michigan masterpiece that is Bell's Two-Hearted.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,papposilenus,3.71,"From a 12oz bottle, dated 01/26/22. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.  Pours a crystalline honey-gold with two-plus fingers of fluffy white suds. Retention is exceptional - in fact, apparently infinite - with fat wads of foamy lacing.  Nose is malty, grainy, redolent of caramel sweetness.  Taste is thoroughly in line with the nose. Tasting grapefruit peel and orange, a little vaporous pine in the sinuses but, more than anything else, an overwhelming caramel malt sweetness. I get a little apple juice character in the finish and beyond which I’m attributing to the yeast(?)  Feel is smooth and round, medium-dense bodied with ample carbonation.  Overall, not well balanced to my palate, all malty-sweet smoothness with very little hop bite. Nothing wrong with it, per se, just not quite my cup of tea. I’ve waited a long, long time to find a (relatively) fresh bottle and I’m not going to lie, I’m a little disappointed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Eapressocycle,5,"Hardly a point to reviewing such an iconic beer. There's a zillion IPAs with colorful inscrutable labels and clever names. Some of them are great, most of them are serviceable, some are terrible. Then there's Two Hearted. Perfectly balanced, deceptively simple. Honestly I don't bother with other beers anymore unless I'm at a brewery.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JZH1000,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a standard pint.  The look is very nice, everything I look for in a beer good 2 finger head, lacing, and decently strong carbonation. Color is a bit dark, maybe a light golden amber. Some haze present. Head becomes rocky as it dissipates, bubbles not the finest. Head has stuck around at about half a finger the whole time I've been drinking.  Aroma is essentially benchmark IPA bitterness and pine at first followed by a slight mellowing into citrus/grapefruit in the hops. Some general beer smell hiding in the back, presumably malt and yeast mingling together underneath all the hops.  Taste is similar to the smell with a kick of bitterness right at the front that sticks around, but nothing too intense. Some lemon or grapefruit juice vibes in the hops but some pine resin comes along with it. Centennial seems to be a very balanced hop. In the back is some mild light malts, but with a sort of sweetness to it. Very flavorful nothing muted about it. Decently malty compared to some IPAs out there.  Feel is right where it should be for the ABV. Its a pretty heavy beer but not quite leather recliner heavy. Its a decent year round vibe with a nice weight to it. Head retention means a thicker creamier mouthfeel but also heavier in the belly.  Overall, I'll stick with what I said earlier. Its a very nice benchmark IPA. Nothing really exciting other than the pure quality and freshness. You know what you're getting with this one, and despite only one hope its got fruit and bitter pine all at the same time. I'd still call it a ""west coast"" IPA",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BigGinge,4.65,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy light copper color with a bone white head.  Smell: Little bit of pine, some grapefruit and a fair bit of fruity yeast.  Taste: Much like the aroma. Grapefruit and pine followed by some gentle hop bitterness. Malt is equal parts sweet and toasty. Maybe a hint of graham cracker towards the finish. Fruity yeast aftertaste. Very well balanced.  Feel: Medium bodied, slick, fair bit chewy but well carbonated. No complaints.  Overall: I've only had this beer once before and I pretty much shied away from it for a few years until now. I wasn't expecting much but I can now see why so many love this beer. It's one of the most balanced IPA's I've tried. It's just flat out delicious and easy to drink. Great beer.

Smell: Mild pine aromas along with some perfume like aromas.  Taste: True to the nose I get mild pine notes, mild fruit notes followed by some bitter hop notes. I'm not sure of the date (not legible) but the nose and flavor profile suggest the beer is past its prime.  Mouth-feel: The beer is fairly light-bodied with a generous level of carbonation.

I consider Two Hearted to be a classic American, West Coast, IPA. Nothing special, but a good IPA. A great beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,klarcbarr3,4.11,"A 12 oz. bottle of Bell's Two Hearted Ale pours a picture perfect, caramel amber body, with a two finger off-white head. The nose meets a bready, grainy, yeasty and hoppy brew, with grapefruit notes. The scent is somewhat restrained, compared to other IPAs' I have tried. Before I go any further, I must advise.. I do not like IPAs'. I tried this one because of consistent recommendations by friends. I was surprised by the smoothness of the taste. The hoppiness is far more refined than expected.. the grapefruit notes were subdued and balanced by a welcome, balancing honey sweetness. I do not detect overbearing pine needle or skunky overtones. Two Hearted Ale is actually an assertive yet smooth IPA, like nothing I have ever experienced. The mouthfeel is very good, the lacing lasts the entire glass, there is no offensive aftertaste! My buddies have said this is an IPA that would appeal to my sense of taste, and they were right. Maybe it's the weather, maybe I'm changing with age, but I have actually found an IPA I will repurchase. Kudos to Bell's Two Hearted IPA!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,harrypowers,4.25,"11/2/21  Pours a nearly clear mahogany with a small creamy head and a lot of lacing.  Smells of malt and slightly dank grassy ( skunky ? ) hops.  Tastes of caramelized malt and slightly bitter hops.  Medium body with light carbonation. Clean brut mouthfeel.  This is what I would call an old school West Coast IPA. Straight forward hops and malt.  This bottle was about 2 1/2 years old, a bit by its freshest date! I must get a fresh bottle and give it a second chance.  11/29/21  Got a fresh can and there is definitely an improvement.  The aroma is now a skunkless grassy hops with some malt and citrus.  The taste is light slightly sweet malt with lightly bitter hops and some slightly tart citrus.  This is a very pleasant very drinkable brew.  My original score was all 4's. I have amended the scores to what you see above",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Pivopijak,4.18,"draught Combination of medium gold and medium orange, heavy on the orange, in appearance. Restrained, spiced, medium roasted malt, with a touch of fruitiness, in the aroma.

287,1093,Shiredave,4.36,"Date on bottom of the $2.99 19oz can appears to read 072721 which I hope and assume is a package date. Beautiful pour - tall pale tan head above a deep, golden amber beer with a slight chill haze. Head has great retention and left thick lace clouds all around. The aroma is a clean and balanced blend of earthy hop and nutty malt. Notes of almond brittle and pine resin along with a hint of orange blossom honey. Not loud or assertive but certainly more aromatic and more interesting than many 1 note IPAs. Malt flavors up front - more honey and caramel candy, nutty grain flavors of pecans and almonds. Hop notes follow right behind lending balance and character with firm bitterness that compliments the malt backbone. Balance, balance balance - everything in harmony. A truly great example of how a solid beer can be made in large batches.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

As with all the other times I have drank this, it was truly a special experience. An IPA that I rank up there with Cigar City's Jai Alai, the brew is a staple now in many a bar and my go-to if I don't seen anything that I like. This has never failed, never come across a bad batch - it's simply consistent and a testament to it's long-running standing in the craft community.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,BPence99,4.68,Always a pleasant drinking experience. The malt profile is notable and stands up well to the pine zest and resiny bitterness that comes from the one-hundred percent Centennial hops use. This beer is exceptionally balanced and bold. The smooth mouthfeel finishes with a crisp dryness that keeps you wanting more.

Sticky resin feel, great carbonation, well integrated hop bitterness. Little alcohol heat. Complex but not wearying. Consistent quality in my experience, but next level when fresh.

Unless 'just ok' is what you're after, in which case I guess you'll fanatically foam at the mouth over its utter mediocrity.  There's golden grain malts. There's herbal hops. It's an IPA. Congratulations, you've met the minimum qualifications. Another unimaginative, perfectly alright IPA. Here's your crappy plastic participation trophy.  All two of its flavors are so mild you'll have to enter a state of partial sensory deprivation just to take full notice of them.  The most pleasing aspect of this ale is it's clean, clear golden hue and a white, commercial-perfect head that retains so well it's hard not to call it appealing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,dele,4.58,"Finally reviewing Two Hearted. A 16oz can about seven weeks old poured into a willi becher glass.  The beer is a deep golden orange. It’s far from clear, but it’s not hazy by any means; light comes through the sides and bottom of the glass. It produces a beautiful ivory colored head that lingers well.  This beer has a classic IPA nose of pine and citrus. There’s a touch of lemongrass and a little of the ammonia that sometimes comes with old school c hops. It smells fantastic.  The taste delivers what the aroma promises: beautiful hoppy pine, grapefruit, and a little honey sweetness. The balance between bitter and sweet is impeccable. This is simply a phenomenal beer, an absolute standard bearer for the style, and draft better than hundreds of beers that cost twice its price. An all time classic.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,luckyseven,4.42,"As a Michigan man, I must say off the bat that this is one of my go-to beers as we approach summer. I drink my beer straight out of the bottle and that beautiful trout on the label and bottle cap are perfect to me! The beer does not have the grapefruit smell that really comes through on the taste. It has a very grainy smell with a bit of I believe tree sap coming through.  As I touched on earlier, the taste is a citrus that is complimented by a strong grapefruit. This to me is the perfect beer to sit back and enjoy while out on one of our Great Lakes. The feel on this one on a summer day is as good as hopping in the water! Can't wait to continue to stock the mini-fridge with these as they are a hit all summer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

There was no aroma at all really and the subtle flavor isn't doing it for me. I look forward to getting to experience it again to see so ill be updating this.   After 3 cans in still not mindblown but its pretty solid and I do like it more than I did after one. If this is your jam go for it. Idk for me, this ain't it Chief.    ...yeah nah this just is not my jam, probably wouldn't get again. I loved Incessant and their darker stuff though. I waited a long time to try this and its one of the most forgettable ipas I've ever had in any style.   Tried again like a year later and I don't feel as harsh or rooted in my past opinion but this is still very average to me nowadays",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Hophead,3.56,"after drinking IPAs religiously for 9 years I finally gave this a try. I Didn't fall for all the hype, as I had serious doubts that it was America's #1 beer, given it was mass produced and came from a brewery which never produced a beer I liked. I have to say though I was pleasantly surprised. Not a chance it';s the #1 beer in the country but it's very drinkable for such an inexpensive IPA at that ABV.  Look- had a very nice semi coppery color with decent head and lacing. Much welcome over the over pale look.  Smell- a nice bready smell and piney resin  Taste- almost a throw back but not as bitter. Definitely one dimensional, but the only hop is centennial so that's expected, but it was not a grapefruit rind bitter as I'd thought it would be. It definitely had that sort of taste but it was much more pleasant than you typically find with a non-east coast IPA. There was enough of a piney resinous to balance that out so it was fairly balanced. Malts are pronounced as well to mute any excessive bitterness. I found this beer somewhat reminiscent of Captain Lawrence's Palate Shifter, though it was less harsh and more sessionable. Honestly for the money I was very pleasantly surprised.  Feel- nice mouthfeel. Nothing very notable, but medium bodied and decent carbonation. Again, very pleasant.  O- not very complex but very drinkable and tasty enough to keep you interested in having a second or third bottle. Overall quite nice and can't be beat at that price point. I'm getting a little tired of spending $22-25 on a four pack of 16 ounce 7% IPAs so this provided as nice alternative.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Celery like after taste. Burnt mouthfeel. Kinda reminded me of swigs of Whitewater IPA after a few dirty bong rips. Not a smoker anymore, haven't done that since 2015, but that's a flavor you just don't forget... 2nd one out of the sixer? Pure bliss like I remembered, holy-o-fuck am I going down memory lane here boys. If anybody can get a dud beer, it'd be me. Nothing against Bell's. Love it, you will too. Get ya some.

In fact my profile picture is this beer. I absolutely adore it. I think it’s fairly priced for a 6pk for 11$ here in New York. Especially for the quality.

Bell's of course is a a world class brewer and and has many outstanding beers. My wife doesn't even drink and if she wants a drink this is her go to. Take that!

Overall, this is a great beer, and I am not normally a fan of most IPAs. This one is an exception.

287,1093,barneyrubble,3.96,"Poured from a bottle into tulip glass a nice 3 finger light tan foamy head developed. Light loose lace as the head settled to a finger of soft foam. Color is a golden amber and is 90% transparent showing fine effervescence.  On the nose some dark caramel malt notes and light almost sweet fruitiness.  A nice bitter note hits the palate first and then creamy smooth sweet yet dark malt and then a smack of pine on the finish. A new note for me is extra fermented barley, which I only got as the beer warmed a bit. This note also has a bit of tang that reminds me of a caramel soft drink like birch beer. The ending hop bitterness is not too much and is slightly astringent in a citrus like way. The sweeter malt keeps the bitterness from going too far and is enjoyable.  Mouthfeel is creamy smooth and medium in fullness with light carbonation. The body of malt is kept in check by the bitterness, but a bit of a sticky finish ends the taste.  I was really excited to try another world class rated beer. I found it had a nice balance of malt and hops leaning more toward the hop side. Less citrus than Deschutes Fresh Squeezed and a bit more pine on the bitterness. I am certainly eager to try more of this 6'er.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,sethmeister,4.12,"From a 1 pint can with an illegible date code.  Pours into my tulip glass a clear orange-amber with a thick creamy off-white head. Head drops to a ring and a skim rather quickly but decorates the glass in fluffy sticky lace.  Scent is subdued at first but I get floral, citrus, soap and pine. Additional notes of treacle, spice and bread crust emerge as the beer warms.  Taste is subtle to start. Sweet caramel and a bready malt base balance the hop profile handily. Grapefruit, citrus and pine. A sort of candied orange zest note. Not tremendously bitter nor is this by any means a hop bomb. If anything it is rather conservative by today's lupulin-crazed standards. The pine resin builds gently and becomes more noticeable with successive sips and a spicy hop note emerges. Bread crusts and toasty notes. This beer seems to come into its own as it warms.  Mouth is a solid medium with a slightly syrupy texture.  Drinkability is high.  This is a classic and I've long wanted to try it. Glad to see Bell's is finally available in my state. I've gotten accustomed to the brash and aggressive hop profiles of today's IPAs and I do love them but there is still something exquisite about a well balanced IPA with a strong malt bill.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Visiting an old friend, ""really need to get together more often"". A clastic IPA, which is the bench mark for others to judge. May find some as good but few better Poured into a pint glass. Classic ipa amber color with nice white head. The lacing hangs on the glass well past finish Aroma is of hops nothing with some citrus notes but nothing specific. Some malts come through to balance it Taste is a well rounded the malts are up front and well blended. Hopes are prevalent but not overly citrus but nice dry finish.

Smells resiny, piney, earthy and just a touch of a lighter note underneath, grapefruit I think. Hint of booze too. Some earthy hops develop into a piney and resiny flavor, combined with a slight caramel malt that also has some bready elements. The hops linger pleasantly in the back end with a touch of bitterness. The carbonation is dead on. The balance of this beer is incredible and easily it's most loveable and drinkable quality. Dangerously drinkable in fact at 7%, as it drinks far easier than that.

Taste is pretty similar, with the malt backbone helping to avoid the hops from overrunning everything. A slightly piney aftertaste is present, along with a bit of caramel maltiness.

Mixes of forest pine and tart citrus exude from the head, confirmed by a supple gulp.

I live on the East Coast now and Two Hearted Ale is the best American IPA I have had since I moved here. The balance is perfect. The nose smells maltier than it is. I do *not* like malty beers, but this is balanced perfectly. The taste is perfect - biscuity, floral, just the right amount of bitter. Does not taste like 7%. The head is superb: fluffy and smooth transforming into lacy and light. Overall, a smoothness not experienced very often. I love the hazy and fruity NEIPAs, but really, Two Hearted Ale transcends the competition to a level achieved by few. Are you standing at the store right now looking it up just to be sure? Buy it, drink it, and enjoy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,UristMcBrewer,4.52,"The beer is a hazy orangish amber color with a pillow head that very slowly gives way to beautiful lacing. It smells strongly of hops. The aroma is strongly piney with citrus that is only slightly less strong. In the background of the smell, the sweet malt is present. Upon tasting the beer, the flavors really burst out. It is dank, piney, and citrusy on a good malty base. The malt offers some sweetness, which is easily overpowered by the hoppy bitterness. It is not too bitter though. It fells very full. It coats your mouth and as the fluffy carbonation comes out. Overall, this a good IPA, a go-to for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MrOH,4.78,"Slightly chill hazed orange-gold. Big white head, excellent retention and lace Grapefruit, pine, any array of floral aromas, and some hints at a malty background. Flavor pretty much follows aroma, a bit more sweet citrus and a touch of caramel malt round it out Mouthfeel and carbonation are spot on for the style. There's a reason this is a living legend of a beer still. It's even better than when I first tasted it 15 years ago.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Leaves behind small sheets and spots of lacing. Aroma of piney hops, some citrus, some honey sweetness, and a malt base. Taste of the piney hops, along with citrus. A combination of resin and grapefruit pith at the end. Front end expresses a sweet touch. Good malt base. Medium mouth feel, with some smoothness in the texture. Very good carbonation. Extremely well balanced. Pleasant transition from initial pine resin to a sweet touch and then ending with a more bitter and resin like end.

287,1093,Bsimpson91,4.89,"Fabulous IPA, loads of fresh Hop flavor and Ultra satisfying. I took me a long time to break down and purchase this beer. The Presentation is unassuming. Well, I learned that packaging doesn't mean a great deal when it comes to Craft Beer. I can't say much on the look. I drank it straight from the bottle. I did notice a tad of sediment in the bottom. Smell is wonderful bright fresh and citrus-like. Centennial Hops lend a beautiful pine resin character I just love. Taste is dang near perfect! Upfront a bold helping of bite from the hops. bright, fresh pine and citrus peel with a smooth underlying malt. finish is somewhat dry with a build-up of bitterness. exactly how I like my IPAs. The feel is slightly thin more so than I like. Light to medium. Smooth throughout the sip. I prefer a creamy mouth feel, This beer doesn't deliver that. Over all, this is a Damn good IPA.

287,1093,CraftBeerBob,4.1,"The color is an appealing amber. The nose is crisp and hoppy. The taste is traditional for an American IPA, clearly above average for that style. The mouth feel is rich and lingers nicely. There is nothing especially distinctive about this brew, but if you're looking for a fine example of a strong American IPA, this ale fits that description quite well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,scarfacecrowe,3.8,"Look; Beautiful hazy amber color with a white two fingered head that dissipates quickly but leaves nice lacing.  Smell: Fruit, Apple Jolly Rancher candy, biscuit, and hay.  Taste: Pleasant mellow hop finish when cool with a slight bitterness on the back of the tongue. The hop presence and bitterness intensify as the beer warms. I am not a huge fan of really hoppy beer so I liked the beer better when it was cool. The beer did not taste like it smelled , I am not experienced at tasting beers so I could not make out what the overall flavor was in the beer. Maybe malt and hops but I could not identify the other flavors which none the less were good.  Mouthfeel: Luxuriously coats the tongue.

287,1093,moodenba,3.52,"Draft Bell's Two Hearted Ale tasted at a BBQ restaurant in August, 2019. The beer arrived displaying a nice copper body topped with a 1/2 inch dense white head. Plenty of lacing appeared as the brew was drunk. To my mind, the mild hoppy aroma was more traditional than modern (a good thing). The flavor featured a complex hop flavor with a nice bitter edge. The malt backbone was fairly minimal, especially considering the beautiful copper body. The 7% alcohol was not evident. This is a straightforward amber ale that goes down well. The brewery's description might oversell the hop-forward aspect of this product. The ale I tasted was fine, especially accompanying a filling plate of ribs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,soulcarve,4.65,"Currently my favorite IPA, and has been for a while. Doesn't have that super thick mouth feel like some other popular IPAs. Also, doesn't overwhelm with the citrus/grapefruit taste, that I'm absolutely NOT a fan of. I get more of the pine and malt notes, versus the citrus. Honestly, I'm not a big IPA fan, but I've tried my share, appreciate them and even home brewed a few. I lean to the lighter, pale ales, session IPAs with more pine when I want that IPA kick. I wouldn't say this is a light IPA, far from it -- it's rich in body, but again -- not overwhelming. THA doesn't have that soapy taste that so many IPAs have. Color is great, not overly filtered like some. Just a great beer. Not to mention, you have to dig the simple fish water label, hope they never change it.

LOOK: Pours a most clear gold color with a solid white head that showed good retention and excellent side glass lace. AROMA: Pine, grapefruit, some hop tartness. Malts scents noted. TASTE: Smooth, drying bitter, a little caramel in the malts, citric hops, nice balance. The high 7.0% ABV is well hidden in the aroma and taste but soon noticed as the warming effect takes place quickly.

287,1093,the_awesometeer,4.22,The beer is a hazy gold with a thick whit head.

The beer is a little sticky but a great drink.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,UlySA,4.35,"A no-nonsense, straight up, hop-forward, sticky, citrusy, grapefruity, piney, perfectly balanced classic India pale ale. To my knowledge (and taste), nobody pulls off a better ode to the IPA. As simple as it is complex, as heavy hitting as it is drinkable, it really doesn't get much better. The balance and interplay between the hops and malt will blow your mind. Definitely a go-to.

287,1093,QMobs,5,"This is a delicious, complex, extremely smooth-drinking, and tasty IPA.  I heard great things about this beer and after tasting it then it did not leave me disappointed. The look is what you'd expect from your average IPA and the smell is a pleasant aroma with nice floral characteristics, but the taste is of course where it truly shines.  Where do I start; floral, citric, light-bitterness and not overpowering in the slightest. Malty with your flavorful hops. For a 7% beer it impressively hides the alcohol entirely. I should also mention that the amount of bitterness in flavor and feel is perfect, not too much and not too little. It has a very crisp and refreshing quality that I experienced throughout as well. The finish is very pleasant, not overstaying it's welcome at all; just simply leaving behind light malty and floral notes, and the finish also isn't overwhelmingly dry such as a lot of IPAs tend to be in my experience.  Overall this is definitely the best ale I've encountered thus far and probably one of my favorite drinks at this point as well, having practically everything I want out of a hoppy IPA. If it weren't for the 7% ABV and I didn't have to worry about going to work then I would find myself drinking this on a daily basis for how delectable is. Definitely check this one out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,radiation,4.36,"I'm fortunate enough to live in Michigan and get to have this fresh on tap regularly. Color is an orange-ish amber.

287,1093,DoghouseReilly3946,4.25,"Date - Canned on 04/16/19, revisited on 05/15/19.  Appearance - In the glass, Two Hearted has a very attractive and rich orange, leaning toward copper hue and it produces a a rocky two finger white colored head.  Aroma: Sweet caramel malts and heavy grapefruit pop out immediately along with other citrusy aromas and some pine. While it isn't the most complex smelling IPA on the block, it does smell pretty good in that old school way and in my opinion, Two Hearted is more aromatic than both Hopsolution and Hopslam.  Taste: The sweet caramel malts pop on the front end and meld together with a medium piney bitterness, which dries the whole beer out toward the back end. Mid palate is where the grapefruit comes in, but not as heavy as I remember. I'm also getting some note that reminds me of a German hop, regardless of what it is, I am digging it. The finish is a pleasant mixture of sweet and bitter, the can says perfectly balanced, and it's not far off. As it warms, I pick up additional notes of cooling mint, lemon, and slightly dank herbs. The mouthfeel is appropriately full bodied without feeling too heavy. Two Hearted, its not sought after or celebrated but it is one of the best go to options in terms of what you get for the money, easily besting its bigger brothers, Hopsolution and Hopslam.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Since then I'm always seeking alpha in the hop genre. I stumbled across Two Hearted in a gas station years ago during a vacation out in the Midwest. I'm also a stickler for fresh hop beers, I want them the day their bottled so I can enjoy a nice hop punch in the face, this beer delivers that. I like Centennial hops by themselves, Founders Centennial ale is another fine example but I find THA is more balanced and has more hop presence. This beer is now available all over the NE where I live, and it's cheap too. $8.99 a for pack of 16oz cans is a bargain.

Little aroma, even across temperature change; slight pine, hint of tea and lemon. The “malt backbone” they describe seems too pronounced. The flavors are muted and simple.

If you can find a 6 pack, buy it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,omahawk,4.33,"August 2019 update - After years of tasting this beer off and on, it is still as good as a classic American IPA can get. Purchased in a 4-can pack. Pours copper golden and clear. Nose is malt, grapefruit and pone. Taste is very well-balanced caramel and toasted malts with “C hop” pine and grapefruit. This style of beer is hard to perfect and most old school IPAs like this have some clashing flavors. This beer does not have that issue and makes for an extremely drinkable beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,WJL2112,4.5,"Poured into Bell's own glass, from either bottle or can; have both. Beautiful looking once poured into a nice glass. Look was a very nice orangey-amber color, with one to two fingers of head. Head dissipates, but leaves nice lacing. Smell of grapefruit, pine. Tasted awesome of course; excellent hop and malt flavors, very well balanced, decent bitterness. Feel was good, smooth, very easy drinking; again great balance between citrus hop flavors and malts. Overall, excellent IPA that will always be in my fridge. There is a reason why this is a top-rated beer year-in, year-out!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,osheamatth,4.04,Nice copper color with a frothy cappuccino like foam head poured out of a 12 ounce can. Very fruity nose with just a hint of pine hops. Reminiscent of ripe melon. The taste is also not very hop forward especially for an IPA. Maybe Centennial hops are a mild variety. A balance of malt and hops is okay but I favor the hoppy IPAs.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,StephenM,4.11,"Hazy copper-orange, thin off white head Light aroma of citrus, pine, white bread Flavor is grapefruit, orange, pine, peppery, with malty sweetness and balanced bitterness Mouthfeel medium with moderate carbonation and dry finish Overall an excellent balanced IPA",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,defunksta,4.79,"Poured from a bottle at 45 degrees,  Appearance: Pours a beautiful, deep and bright copper color with a strong, foamy, cream-colored head. SRM of 14. (4.25)  Aroma: Hop flavors of citrus, tropical and stonefruit. Pineapple, peach, & mango. Very dank. Piney, dank, and earthy w/ floral hop aromas. A definite sweet caramel and toffee malt sweetness lingers underneath, but not roasty. A little bit of smokiness. (4.50)  Flavor- A burst of balanced citrus, tropical, and stonefruit. There's orange, grapefruit, peach, lemon, pineapple, apricot, mango. But there is stonefruit present to balance out the sweet/tart citrus.There's subtle apple, peach, apricot. Peach tea too. Floral notes come with a strong dank, earthy, hop bitterness on the finish.. An absolute masterpiece of flavor blends. It has a strong bitter yet such an appropriate and balanced bready malty finish to perfectly round out the flavor. One of the most complex IPAs. It's hard to pinpoint what makes the flavor so great, but I think it is the apricot jam, peach, mango and sweet honey, caramel, and subtle toffee combination. (5.00 = Perfect)  Feel - The body is full. High carbonation allows this beer to have a strong mouthfeel that is not too thick nor thin. Not too oily, but respectively heavy enough. (4.5)  to ATB Villanous: Very similar. This one has a slightly more apple, stonefruit, and apricot flavor. Slightly heavier bodied and more creamy. More earthy and less bitter on the tongue. Less citrus, tropical flavors. The centennial hops are quite remarkable.  to Odell's IPA: It has a more pronounced hop bitterness than Odell, which is more citrusy and malty sweet. Both have such a well balanced hop and malt profile. Two-Hearted has perfected the hop-malt, bitter-sweet balance we want in an IPA.  cto Ballast Point's Sculpin: More of a tropical fruit flavor. More resiny and dank. Less citrus. Much more balanced in malt and hops. Less bitterness. More melon and honey malt sweetness. But wow, Sculpin is probably the closest competitor in terms of the best IPA. I think I actually prefer the flavor of Sculpin, but the rounded balance of Two-hearted is unmatched. 1/18/22: More caramel and orange resin. Less orange citrus, apricot, and bitterness.  Compared to Anti-Hero: Slightly darker and dank peach and black tea presence. More bitterness and less citrus. Slightly heavier bodied. As for preference, I think I have to go for the T2H due to the compound flavor profile. Similar.  Compared with Surly's Furious: Lighter orange color. It has more tropical and stonefruit for a more complex flavor profile. Similar bodied, slightly heavier and sweeter. More of a honey malt profile is showcased. More pineapple, peach, and honey. Wow, simlar.  Compared to Stone IPA 3/7/20: (An oxidized Stone): Pours a darker amber color. Stronger aromas of sweet ripened fruit. Less citrus, pine, and skunk/herbs (oxidation). Finishes less bitter, with a sweeter and more caramel malt body.  Compared w/ Jai Alai 6/30/20: . Slightly milder aromas, but maybe just more of caramel malts and less of the fruity hops. More earthy grapefruit, Christmas pine, peach, apricot, and orchard fruit. Less juicy orange and tropical melon. Similarly sweet, but this one finishes more bitter. These are both one of the best IPAs on the market, so hard to call a winner. I think the Jai Alai is more flavorful so might win today, but the Two Hearted has a classic flavor and balance that cannot be replicated. I think Two Hearted is the winner in the long haul.  Compared to Centennial IPA 5/14/20: Similar aroma. More fruit and honey and less resinous caramel malts. 8/28/20: Pours A slightly lighter color. Very similar aromas, but slightly zestier. More sweet and chocolate flavors. Less stonefruit sweetness. 1/25/21: Pours a lighter color. Similar aroma. Slightly more fruity. More grapefruit, peach, caramelized pineapple. Less earthy orange, berry, cocoa flavors.  Compared to Surly Furious 8/3/20: Pours a lighter color with a lighter head. More sweetness and stonefruit. Less pine, spice, and grapefruit. Less bitterness.  to Lagunitas IPA 10/11/21: More peach and orchardfruit. Less pear, lychee.  to Walnut River High Beam 2/23/22: More stonefruit & pine. Less tropical notes. Similar, but more flavorful.  to Earth Rider Caribou Lake 5/17/22: More candied stonefruit. Less earthy berry. More flavorful.  to Bear Republic Racer 5 5/25/22: More apricot, caramel, bitter pine. Less citrus. Sweeter and more bitter.  Overall: The Gold-Standard for American IPAs. The best of the best. I haven't found one that definitively beats it side by side. The balance of Centennial hops with sweet malts into a rounded body with the smokey component is an absolute masterpiece. The orange, pineapple, candied stonefruit, nectarine, mango trio, with caramel/toffee really distinguishes it from the rest. It's the roundness and balance that define the greatness of this beer. As of now, this is the best folks. (Final Rating 4.79)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Delectable, the quaff is about as good as it gets...I was trying to find a great IPA that wasn't juicy style. As that is what has dominated my choices for the last few months. IPA is all I drink but who cares? I just mention it because i'm pretty particular about what I look in a IPA as I feel the style has a lot of crap on the market. However, this one is great. My mother who hates most IPA can actually drink this one and that says a lot to me. Other than that, love the hops in this, love the beer in general.

Amazing retention. Sticky-icky lacing left overs.  The smell of the 100% Cenntenial hops dominates the nose. Super sweet & fruity, strawberry pie, creamy tropical pineapple and hearty, herbalized earthy tones make for a very unique and bold aroma. Pretty sure the amber-style malt brings in more honey style sweetness in a subtle way.  This comes across as a much more ""balanced"" west coast style IPA in the flavor profile overall. Earthy, citrus, some laid-back pineapple and tropical fruit flavors from the Cenntenial-only hops. Herbal and hearty effects deep down with a mild but dry hoppy finish. The malt is medium to full, Amber sweetness of honey soaked dark bread does provide a classic, strong backbone for some old-school balance.

287,1093,Luscious_Malfoy,4.34,poured from a 12oz can into a forager ridged pint glass. pours a foggy burnt orange with three fingers of dense crowning foam head. citrus initially on the nose followed by pine. taste follows with a little heavier malt presence as it warms but it really is a wonderful balance of citrusy orange and grapefruit with a piney finish. full mouthfeel; so easy drinking for a being a fairly bitter IPA. an American classic.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,CypressBeerDude,4.08,"Really mellow IPA. Clean taste not quite as good as as PA Phantasmo... but a very close challenger. A more subtle type of IPA IMO, but nice nonetheless.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Jesterr44,3.9,"Pours a uniform very slightly hazy golden orange colour with a tall fizzy head which dies down to little rather quickly. Some light lacing during drinking. Aroma is of grassy & fruity hops with some sour malt blended in. Taste is better as I was expecting too much sour malt after the aroma. An even blend of mild citrus, grassy hops, sweet caramel malts and just a touch of pine. Grapefruit lingers on the finish. Mouthfeel is full & quite smooth & is perhaps the best part of this beer. In the end, a solid IPA I've been wanting to try which doesn't strike me as something I'll need to seek out, but would gladly have again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Aichelberger,4.35,"On tap at the Maryland Mallet Smokehouse and Pub in Westminster, MD. Perfectly golden to light amber in the glass, with a nice head of foam and tiny bubbles rising inside. Piney hops in the nose, with a hint of biscuity sweetness on the tongue, follwed by a very well balanced malt body and spicy pine and citrus. A slight bitterness rounds out the flavor for one of the best IPAs out there, IMHO. It paired well with the BBQ and the seafood on the table, too. Very nice!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,digboy,4,Somewhat dark orange color that is slightly hazy with a 2 finger silky head. Fruity aroma with some malt peeking through. Taste is peppery with a citrus flavor - lemon I guess - mixed with a moderate malt as a base. Feel is crisp and a little sticky.

287,1093,Mindcrime1000,4.21,"Pours a hazy but shimmering copper gold with a fine head and excellent creamy lacing. A super start.  The aroma is inviting with the only drawback being that it is subdued. A well-balanced presentation of malts countered with ruby-red grapefruit and pine resin. Clean and the paragon of an IPA, I just wish there was more of what is a good smell.  The flavor is everything that one could want in an IPA. There is a strong malt spine that helps provide a ""base"" for a wide-ranging and balanced bitter counterpoint that is equal parts citrus (grapefruit) and evergreen. Undeniably hoppy and bitter, yet (thankfully) not trying to win an IBU prize. The word here is ""balance"" and it's spectacular.  The bitterness, carbonation, and a hint of booze all combine for a drying crisp finish that makes this very drinkable.  I can't believe that I've delayed this long in trying and reviewing this brew. The IPA style became ""worn out"" for me a couple of years ago, but I've returned to try it anew. This brew is an excellent representation of the style. Undeniably hoppy and bitter, but well balanced and restrained on that point.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Jbbdrinker,4.47,"Slightly cloudy, golden amber. With a tracery of white foam. Creamy, slightly sour aroma which is echoed in the flavor. Nice balance between the sweet malt and bitter, resinous hops, but hop notes seem to linger the most. A gentle bloom of alcohol coates the mouth. This  is a very nice brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,danch,4,A solid IPA at an affordable price point. I wouldn’t say it’s in the cream of the crop category but it’s a great readily available IPA.

287,1093,wmscottsimpsonjr,4.19,"Amber with thick head. Smells of pine, orange, grapefruit, florals. Full bready-malt-heavy flavor with pine and citrus. Moderately bitter and sweet.

287,1093,Blackrobe,4.31,"Dated 6/21/18 on the bottom of the can, packaged 2.5 weeks ago.  Pours a slighty cloudy darker orange-amber with two fingers of creamy off-white head. Nose starts off with a sweet ruby grapefruit and moves in to lemonade, a potpourri of florals (I get jasmine and lavender), pine sap, dark fruit that leans towards blackberry and sweet Portuguese bread malt. Taste brings in another dose of that dark fruit I got on the nose, balanced well with the sugary malt. Along with the notes of the nose, I also get some earthiness, slight spiciness and hop candy notes. Body is a sticky, yet smooth medium with fine streaming carbonation. Medium sweetness, low drying, medium-low bitterness. It's worth noting the head on this brew stuck around for the whole tasting and when it got a little low, a small swirl of the glass revitalized it fully. Overall, it's one of those wonderful East meets West coast brews that just hit the right spot, balancing hops and malt perfectly. I'll definitely be picking this up often now that it's here in MA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Light pine and citrus. Some bitterness. Sticky/Syrup. Malts. More hops. Light carbonation feel. Alcohol burn comes through a bit. Pretty smooth with a slight bittery finish and a little linger of alcohol. Has a distinct taste which is always a plus.  O: Great well balanced classic IPA. On the border of being a sipper.

Not very pronounced.  Light body, sticky MF ( I like this in an IPA) more malt forward than other IPAs.  Citrus, pine, not too pronounced , but good.  Overall- solid IPA. I wasn't wowed. We have a lot of excellent beers in my area. This is a classic, but the citrus is not as pronounced as other beers in the same style.

287,1093,LarryV,4.19,"New to the MA area so picked up my first sixer. Aroma is subtle, more grain than hops. Pours a golden amber color with about 1/2"" head, not a lot of lacing. This reminds me of an English style ale, very nicely balanced - solid malt backbonethat's not overly sweet with a subdued hoppiness. Carbonation is somewhat subdued as well but the end result is an easily drinkable, world class beer. Subtle bitterness lingers on the palate but never overpowers. Beer that tastes like beer should, no juicy, mango, citrus nonsense going on here. Very nice, I""d buy this again in a heartbeat.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,ExtraStout,4.18,"So in my glass is the famous Two Hearted IPA. It looks good, potent dark sun yellow, lightly hazy, with a great very foamy and rocky white head, highly carbonated in appearance. Acute citrusy C-hops nose, very flowery, sweet, sour, hints at lemon pie, lilac (orval anyone?), grapefruit, grass. Solid toasty/cookie malt attack early like a good pils, quickly complemented by the direct floral and citrusy hops. Great flavor development for an IPA, but you know where they're from, hophead's neck of the wood and always lacking a touch of ""multidimensionality"". Tremendous velvety texture, less carbonated than anticipated. Clean and long oily bitter finish. Quite good, but top 100 in the world? I think not.

L: Very slightly cloudy in a bronze, copper like color. S: Scents of nature. Like walking through a pine tree forest during the autumn season, if I had a caramel incense poking out of my pocket. T: The taste is feint of trees and caramel, maybe even slight molasses? F: It's dry at the beginning, due to the hoppiness, but smooths itself out.  Overall, the beer reminds me of what it would be like if a new partner invited you over to their house, watch a World War II documentary, and wondering why.

This citrus doesn't taste artificial whatsoever, which I've found to be unfortunately prevalent with ales of this nature. The alcohol content actually feels like a contributing ingredient rather than an obligatory addition. Not to mention, the smell is phenomenal.

The beer is a darker orange (darker than most American IPA's out there) but, not too dark. The beer had almost no head and left a nice lacing as the beer was drank further down the glass. Taste is an explosion of flavor, for me this is THE IPA. Grapefruit flavors with a notes of tropical fruit are what I taste. The feel of this beer is perfect, not too carbonated but, just carbonated enough to ""pierce your tongue"" as they say. Overall this is my favorite IPA, excellent!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Two hearted has always been close to my heart since trying it on its inaugral run. I had always thought of it as the beer that changed beers, and years ago I would have given it close to a 5/5! However, since then, IPA's have changed and yes it is still a staple of IPA's, it is not my ""go-to"". It looks gorgeous poured, and smells/feels beautiful as well.

287,1093,Irishman_Scott,5,"I’ve finally developed a taste for IPA’s over the years, but still I’m pretty selective (definitely more of a stout guy). That being said, I must rank this as about the best IPA, and for that matter, one of the best quality beers in general, that I’ve had. Poured a nice goldish and orangish, with about a finger width head, that although most was gone in 5 minuets, remained a thin layer the duration, which laced nicely. Smell was definitely citrus and taste followed. Medium carbonation mouthfeel. Hoppy enough to be an IPA, but not so overwhelming that it takes the enjoyment away.

Head retires into little clusters of foam typical of hoppy ales. Smells strongly of pine and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is great, perfectly carbonated and goes down very smooth. Malt presence is there, bready with a light touch of sweetness, but not out front, typical of style. Big hop forward taste, bitter citrus flavors dominate, but not enough to seem overwhelming or dry out the palate.

It's got a nice sweet smell on the nose, almost like a sweet citrusy smell. Also a really nice floral aroma and a touch of pine. This is a very unique IPA. If you haven't tried this yet, try it!

Smells of grass, pine and resin.  Taste is a delicious mixture of pine and resin. Strong but not overpowering bitterness.  Mouthfeel is sticky but somewhat light. Not a super-powerful aftertaste, but noticeable.

For me, it's not really memorable or something that I would go out of my to find to have again.  Look: Basic Pale Ale, nice color. The ones that were poured for me from the tap were a little hazy. Nice head in the glass. Smell: Nice and citrusy, not overwhelming. Taste: Dry, well balanced, but not as much malt in the background as I come to expect from the reputation.

This brew has the look and smell of most American IPA's on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up on the Hoppy bitterness, the a nice smoothness of earthy grains and malts. There is also a nice slight sweetness at the end note of this brew. Two hearted Ale , has a lot going on in it. The body of this American IPA is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a real nice balance to it. This is one of the more enjoyable IPA's I have had in awhile. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.00% ABV in this brew,it is just that smooth. I can't get over how smooth this brew goes down.

287,1093,HipCzech,4.22,"Serving: 12 oz bottle (""PKG 07/26/17"") poured into a shaker pint.  Appearance: Clear, pale gold with a tall, lush, frothy head of white foam and spotty lace.  Smell: Light, grainy aroma with plenty of citric hops: citrus zest, faint tropical fruit and grass.  Taste: Pale malts build a solid, lightly sweet base for waves of hops. Citrus, grapefruit rind, pineapple, and herbal pine resin. Closes with a clean, crisp bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, slightly oily feel and crisp, moderate carbonation.  Overall: Solid, classic IPA; nothing heavy handed, just well balanced and very drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ribby,4.31,"Did a head to head tasting of this with North Peak Diabolical. Overall, two hearted has a better hop flavor; more citrusy and less bitter. Diabolical is maltier, and generally a bit more bitter. Two hearted pours a cloudy light amber with a decent head. Both are well crafted brews, with the style differences the most distinguishing difference.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Labeorphile,4.65,Cloudy with a thick fluffy head that stays s while. Soapy citrus aroma. Great hoppy flavor that doesn't have the typical bitter hop after taste. Very smooth and enjoyable as a partner to my teriyaki.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,IPAExpert69,3.7,"Not trying to #trigger anybody with this review, especially with it being National Beer Day and all, but this was one of the more disappointing IPA's I've recently tried. L: Pours like a legit American IPA, amber with a moderate head S: Grapefruit and malty smell, knew immediately that this was gonna be a smooth finish. T: Real let down, doesn't pack a punch or really differentiate itself, hype definitely made it worse for me. Grapefruitty taste with a malty, almost frothy finish. Too light. F: Smooth but lacking character. As our ""president"" would say: SAD! O: 3.69, nothing great but definitely not a bad beer. Would recommend at like a relatively poor package store, otherwise there will be better beers on the shelf.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ImperialTony,4.38,Hands down my go to! It helps that I live lees than an hour from where it's brewed. I've compared it to other IPAs and it is always superior.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Kevin6234,4.24,"From the tap, golden color with white head. Smell has beautiful citrus and piney tones. The taste is the same for vitus and pine. It's not too much hops or the carbonation. This is a really good IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,moundbz,4.26,"Looks like the perfect pour of an IPA. I think the smell is pretty tame, not much there. Really smooth on the swallow. It feels like I'm inhaling a small amount of hops with a smooth swill when I take a drink. Overall, I don't think it's the standard (Sculpin) but a great beer nonetheless.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mvanaskie13,4.36,"How have i not reviewed this yet? - Poured into a custom grip shaped glass: color is straw/gold, head is off white with fine bubbles and presents at least 1 inch thick, head lingers well and leaves a solid 1/4 inch top and spotty lacing on the glass.  Smell is all centennial hops: great pleasant flavor, simple and enticing.  Taste is similarly simple, but great: malt is light, noticeable and balancing, yeast leaves a hint of fruitiness, but the centennial takes the finish with the pleasant light grapefruit and earthy hop presence, even light floral/herbal note as well.  The mouthfeel of this beer has always been a standout component: lightly sweet, but bitter - flavor lingers on the tongue and bitterness has a good presence throughout.  Overall: a style defining beer, a beer i've always gone to on tap when looking for an ipa, and one you want to emulate in your homebrewing repertoire.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,PlinyMeNow,4.04,"12 oz bottle with printed date only 2 weeks ago. Pours deep golden and looks a bit less creamy than I usually like. Foamy head without much retention. Aroma is pleasant and subdued; I get mostly stone fruit and a little orange, some pine and citrus, grass and earth. Taste is unexpectedly and jarringly unrelated to the nose. Heavily reliant on resinous piney bitterness, there is some citrus and stone fruit worked in as well as noticeable grass, earth, rocks... and the bitterness keeps going and takes on a slight metallic quality and continues through a long, bitter finish. Overall I do understand the hype and can appreciate how well crafted it is especially for hop heads. I personally found the bitterness too unbalanced. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one to shy from a DIPA with 100 IBUs, but some balance is key.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,StraightCs,4.64,"A true classic. This American IPA does just about everything right. It has a mix of hops that creates a strong citrus aroma and a bitter/sour mix flavor mix that shouts grapefruit. The haze suspends the flavors, which coat the tastebuds. A little more carbonation would add to the mix. This is my favorite American ale.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,akirakcat,4.5,"Rich, slightly cloudy amber color with white foam and good lacing. Strong citrus and floral aromas from the hops. I'd be hard pressed to say much about taste notes beyond grapefruit, orange, and pine, but the beer has a nice kick to it, and a crisp finish that dries out the mouth like a real IPA. This beer reminds me a lot of Oberon but with a hefty dose of Centennial hops in place of the wheat. It's very near perfect.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DarkStar75,4.5,"Just tried this for the first time and thankful I did. It has a very rich and smooth flavor. It smells fantastic...very aromatic floral, light pine and light citrus. 7% abv but doesn't taste boozy. Goes down easy and doesn't suffer from a bitter ending. Delicious..definitely recommend.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,willcull78,4.77,"As a true Buckeye fan I find it hard to like anything from Michigan (ha!); however, this is one superior IPA. It has a pleasing amber color as it pours out, creating a nice foamy head. The taste is quite flavorful, probably one of the best that there is in an IPA and not overly pungent as some others. The taste of the ale lingers over the palate; truly an outstanding quality. It has a very pleasing aroma, unlike some others. I have tried this beer before but it had been awhile back and I wanted to try it again; and it will be on my list of brews to get again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Traymond,4,"L: Nice IPA look, decent head  S: Not super pungent. Floral and mellow.  T: Pretty mild but crisp and super super easy to drink. Finish is quite nice and not overly bitter. Hard to believe this is 7%! Alcohol is maybe barely present. Very nice IPA even for those who are not huge fans of the type  F: Really good carbonation level. As said, easy to drink  O: Would recommend to those just looking for a solid brew. Not overpowering at all. No complaints about this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Thankin_Hank,4.09,"A soft looking beer almost like unfiltered but a nice smell of hops. Not too strong. Taste is great, again not too strong for an IPA. An easy drinker. Could be a session beer by me. Overall, everybody is right, this is a fine IPA. On draft at Ron's Corner Tavern. Update2021. 12 ounce can dated 012121. Big fluffy head. Great citrus aroma. Has a different balance of hop bitterness where it's slight more bitter over the citrus/malt taste of the beer. Which really makes it nice for the rotation when you can get it fresher. Thanks for shipping to Texas Larry Bell.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Sheppard,4.35,"Pours golden. Aroma of orangey citrus. Orange and tangerine up front that's quickly met with coniferous resiny bitterness. I remember first having this beer when I split a pitcher of it with a friend in college at the Blue Leprechaun in Ann Arbor. I was blown away by how good it was. Many, many IPAs later, this still is a great beer to me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Dionysus_Reincarnated,5,"Brewed in Michigan and named after the Two Hearted River I must recommend this beer to everyone because I consider Bells Two Hearted American IPA to be the gold standard for American IPA's. I absolutely love this beer and it seems to be one of the most popular AIPA's in my region, NYC metro area quickly gaining market share across the United States.  Look: Golden - healthy carbonation. I usually drink out of the bottle because I can't wait. Served in a visually pleasing brown bottle with gorgeous painting of a trout on the label and on the cap.  Smell: Two hearted gives off a delicious floral clean arouma of pine coupled with slightly fruity flowery accents. Envision yourself laying in a field of wild flowers surrounded on the periphery by a forrrest of pines.  Taste: Hoppy piney flavor not overly fruity - perfectly balanced with malt. Very drinkable. 7.0% ABV  Feel: Perfect Buzz. Amazing beer for those who like to have a beer on the hiking trail or outdoors in the sun - not too heavy. I never get a bloated feeling while drinking Bells two hearted and I really enjoy the AIPA light buzz. Goes down very easy. Favorite beer hands down.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Bluerabbitbell,4.25,"Have had this beer several times, but am finally reviewing it. Since our last name is Bell I've always had an affinity for Bell's Brewery. Some really good brews, and this one is REALLY good. Hits the spot just right!  7/25/22 (Walnut Grill)Update: i guess we should describe this.... Smells like walking into a brewery! Definite sweet malt backbone. Certainly a balance between the hops and make on this one!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ipeters1017,4.34,"From a 12 oz bottle dated 5/1/17. Pours a slightly hazy reddish orange with a big head, leaving a lot of lacing down the glass. The smell is packed with citrus, but that's about all I'm getting.  This is a hop bomb as soon as it hits my mouth, but it backs off quickly. Citrus-y and fruity, with an underlying sweetness to it that's especially prevalent in big gulps. There's definitely some tangerine in here. The bitterness is nice, not too harsh, and is accompanied by just a hint of pine that you don't really get in the nose, but it lingers in the aftertaste. One of the most complex IPAs I've encountered, and I'm a big fan.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, not too heavy or sticky and not too thin and carbonated either, just about the perfect feel for an IPA. This is extremely drinkable, refreshing, and great for the price.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Rufus1,4.6,"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle into a glass the same temperature as the beer. Lovely orange/amber color. Very hazy. Two finger head that settles rocky and lasts. Some sticky lacing after beer warms. The smell is clean citrus hops with an underlying fruitiness. Grapefruit and tangerine. Maybe strawberries? My wife who does not drink at all thinks the smell is terrific.  Taste is of course hops up front. The rest completely follows the nose. Both citrus and some melon. Watermelon? Malts are not outstanding but with enough backbone to carry and balance the hops but is not huge on the palate. Very juicy.  Medium body that carries the hops well. Building malts as as the beer warms leaving a bit of bread on the finish for a fuller mouthfeel. Crisp, fresh and extremely drinkable. Definitely carved out a spot in my beer cooler.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,seedyone,4.3,"From can at home. Dated 4/18/17. As the name implies this is one of the sweethearts of IPAs & deservedly so. I am not a big IPA guy, but there are afew exceptions & this may find itself on this short list.  Pours with a bright white tight suds head floating on a rich, lightly hazed honey golden hue. The head gives way to sparse lacing. The most remarkable trait is the luscious texture rife with a fruity essence. I find the flavor bordering on an apricot/peach tinge. Heresy, you say? Perhaps, but it's all a matter of taste.  As I usually avoid IPAs I'm not comfortable drawing comparisons, but I know what I like & it's easy to see why this has such a following.  Thank you Bell's for opening my eyes.

287,1093,Brianz81,4.55,"This is the standard in IPA's, in my opinion. If you haven't tried Two Hearted, do so now! The bitterness is just right. It has the classic ""grapefruit"" taste, but not as strong as something like Dogfish Head. If you like IPA's, you'll love it. If you're not familiar with IPA's, this is a good one to start with. The price is right around $10-11.00 for a 6 pack of bottles. 4 packs of cans aren't much cheaper. If you do end up with cans, remember, this isn't Busch Light.

287,1093,Lone_Freighter,4.3,"Can to becher pint glass, the appearance was a clean crisp rugged orange color with a finger's worth of white foamy head that fell off at a moderate pace. Some ringy lace, slightly sticky. The aroma had a wonderful dose of sweet fresh pine, floral bitterness and sturdy caramel malt base. The flavor was a fabulous blend of the prior aromatic qualities - sweet to bitter and back through intertwining eloquently into a clean aftertaste. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, pretty nice AIPA that brought me into the beer world when I lived in Michigan. Always a post fishing beer whenever I finished fishing the St. Mary's River in Sault Ste.

Taste: Not really one overwhelming taste. A nice blend of multiple flavors with all of them blending nicely. The one flavor you do get is the nice citrus you expect from an IPA.  Overall, this is a very good beer that is extremely smooth and easy to drink.

The head settles into a thin film that rests atop the beer, leaving a ton of lacing as it goes. Pretty much the perfect looking beer. Beer porn, if you will.  The aroma is extremely floral and dank, bringing notes of ruby red grapefruit, orange peel, and sticky pine. The back end is full of toasted malt, bringing a good amount of balance to the aroma.  The taste is more of the same. Orange and grapefruit, followed by some sweet caramel malt and finished off by a tidal wave of pine.  The feel is medium-light bodied with good carbonation. Goes down very smooth, yet has a crisp bite to it that is quite refreshing. Very dry and resinous.  Overall, an excellent IPA.

287,1093,Brutaltruth,4.1,"From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter via a friend from work---THANKS KEVIN! This fine ale pours a chill hazed golden amber color with a nice head of white foam that settles to a thick big bubbled ring, thin light pool, and features some darn nice sticky lacing. Nose of heavy pine hops, sweet malts, honey, and a touch of orange rind with other light citrus notes. Flavors lightly exceed by presentation with citrus touched hops featuring orange zest zest and subtle pineapple notes touched by light breaded malts and honey that fade into the background with a sticky pine note. Nice mouth feel; medium body, medium carbonation, and a citrus and pine laden hoppy finish.  Overall, a legend among the craft brew scene and a solid IPA.

287,1093,HotDogBikeRide,4.6,"Made my own six in a Texas HEB and for the first time I see some Bell's brewery chilling there waiting for me! I just got Two Hearted this time because there were one or two more exciting choices and a LOT of really cheap incredible beers or ones that I hadn't heard of.  Pours an orange gold with a bit of haze into a pint glass. Keeps a thin ring of foam and one-sided, spotty lacing. The smell and taste take this to a whole new level.  Smell is dank, piney, grapefruit, thing wreeks of hops. Taste follows suit with the hoppy bitter, pine, grass, grapefruit, and a floral aftertaste. This beer is pretty crazy good. I very much regret not going ahead and grabbing the full Bell's catalogue available at the store so I could give all their beers a shot.  Maybe you guys across the country are spoiled, but this is super good and deserves the ratings I am throwing at it. The freshness has to have something to do with it, being packaged on 2/21/17.

287,1093,GrumpyGas,3.83,"16oz draft pour into a pint glass shows a hazy orange ish gold body floating a fluffy white head. Some spotted lacing. Aroma is indistinct, or muted. There is some pine resin and citrus, though. Flavors include grapefruit, pineapple, grass, pine resin, and a slight bready malt. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, medium and oily, just short of chewy.

Not as strong as I would have imagined. There is a bigger piney hop to the taste. Mild citrus with a malty caramel ending. Maybe some slight honey. Mildly astringent finish. Not quite what I was expecting. More of a malty base, while I tend to venture more towards the West Coast style. This was bottled just over a month ago, so it is still fresh, but would like to try one less than a week old.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TBoneJones,4.57,"Appears golden-copper, crisp-looking with a low head, but nice threads lacing. Nose is bready, with citrus and pine. Taste is something else. As in, something unlike so many ipa's that have soaked the market.....this Juicy grapefruit, massive hop bitterness. Tasty in that another sip can't come soon enough. Peppery, with what to me has a pilsner-like malt quality, and it feels so smooth...medium-bodied. Zesty orange notes come through as I sip it longer. Impressive IPA taste. I'm equally impressed by the malt backbone. The flavor and balance with the centennial hops is superb there. The easiest benchmark IPA to compare it with, as far as centennial-hopped IPAs go, would be Founder's IPA. Only issue there, in my book, is that this Bell's IPA appears to be the new benchmark. Glad they came to Texas.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,eppCOS,4.19,"I like Two Hearted as a beer in general, but as an IPA it falls short of the other benchmarks now. It's what IPA tasted like 15 - 20 years ago. Then, it would have stood out. Now, not so much. Looks and smells ""proper,"" but it doesn't have much taste or mouthfeel impression. It is a mid-pack IPA now, especially given that it's a solid 7.0% ABV, and there are much better ones out there. Still, it is a smooth, even-handed version of the style. UPDATE: better taste and mouthfeel (9.4.2018).

Drives a red Barracuda, singin' meat packer songs, And she ain't from Kalamazoo…” if you know your Primus (as well I do) by now you’ll have that Ler electric guitar riff ringing through that grey lump between your ears and singing about a 55’ Chrysler where the trunk never ends… but what has any of that got to do with Bell’s Two Hearted Ale??? Specifically: Bell’s is based in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Whenever I hear Kalamazoo the Primus takes over, I’ve learned not to fight it all these years - just slap on Brown Album and get into a Claypool-esque bass-slapping groove and see exactly where the funk takes me [somewhere funky no doubt].  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a nonic pint.  A: Hazed amber bodied - the colour of autumn in a glass - with a decent off-white half centimetre head. There is some nice lace scrawl on the side of the glass denoting that this is perhaps a kick-ass IPA. 8/10.  S: West Coast IPA then: Piney/citrusy hops straight up on the nose, hints of biscuit and caramel malts, a light honey scent, but overall nothing spectacular - it’s a fairly standard West Coast IPA aroma, a decent one, however nonetheless a tad ordinary to this nose these days (though I do suspect considerable hop fade from the package date of 29 Sep 2016 - that’s 5 months of hop fade there!). 6/10.  T: Honey/biscuit maltiness to the fore, light piney/citrus hop presence - yep, hop fade - boy it sucks knowing how highly praised this beer is in the US and knowing now what a fresh IPA tastes and smells like. I mean it’s still a really tasty IPA, don’t get me wrong, but the hops have faded off big time. Balance is pretty spot on, I can only imagine how good a fresh Two Hearted would taste. Finish is a herbal/floral mild bitterness. 8/10.  M: Almost medium bodied with a thin but dense carbonation… spot on here. 8/10.  D: I really need to do a beer tour of the US, so many beers that are hop-heavy are getting to Australia 2-3 months (at the earliest) and it’s impossible to imagine how good this and many other American IPAs I’ve tried are… except there have been a few IPAs that have tasted really good from the US (Deschutes Fresh Squeezed, Victory DirtWolf, anything Victory really) so maybe it’s down to what the distro is doing? Who knows. Shame for Bell’s this isn’t getting to us quick enough though - they deserve better - all US craft brewers deserve better. 8/10.

287,1093,funk_master_flex,4.63,"Purchased a 16 oz can from Belmont Station in Portland, Oregon. Less than two months old, packaged on 12/21/16. Poured into a tulip glass.  Look: This beer has a beautiful semi translucent burnt orange color with a thick, creamy white head that dissipates after a minute or two. The color is reminiscent of orange marmalade. Smell: The smell is the only subtle part of this beer. Grapefruit rind with a backdrop of pine needles and subtle floral scent. Taste: A blast of grapefruit and mango to the palate with associated bitterness that is balanced out by a backbone of malt. The malt is very clearly the support player and does not add much besides a balancing sweetness for the hops. The pine taste comes near the end with the lingering but pleasant bitterness on the back and sides of my tongue. Feel: Medium body with moderate carbonation. Dry finish. Overall: This is a beautiful showcase of centennial hops and one of the best examples of an old school American IPA. At 7% alcohol it is extremely drinkable and could pass off as a 5% beer (until you get about 4 beers deep lol). This is the second Bell's beer I have ever had (being from Oregon) and the hype was well deserved. I could drink this beer all day. For being a single hopped IPA there is a great complexity of flavor that truly speaks to the allure of the Centennial hop and why it has become such a powerhouse in the American craft brewing scene.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BloodSoakedAleMug,4.5,"Sampled from a fresh can.  Look: Pours a bright, translucent orange hue with a billowing two finger eggshell colored hell.  Aroma: Lots of orange and grapefruit pith with generous amounts of malted grains and resinous, piney hops.  Taste: I'm getting sweet grapefruit, bitter orange rind and a juicy mango flavor capped off by gentle but somewhat assertive pine resin note. Over time a biscuity, malty taste becomes pronounced. It ends on peppery flavors of bitter hops and orange rind.  Feel: Even at 7% I could crush these back to back. This beer is seriously thirst quenching and smooth. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Dry and bittersweet, but refreshing.  Overall: One of my go to IPAs. It's almost flawless. You will be hard pressed to find something at $13 a sixer that tastes this good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JacobusFavier23,4.16,"L- Quarter of a finger head that dissipates quickly. Nice clear brown/amberish color. Better than average looking beer. S- Sweet and syrupy malts followed by piney, earthy grassy hops and floral hops, booziness follows. Very fragrant beer. Could be one of the most fragrant smelling beers I've had. T- Slight grapefruit-y bitterness from the hops that grows as the beer warms. Malty flavor follows this. Very pleasant, not a hop punch in the mouth. Very minimal in juxtaposition to the aroma. But a nice balance. MF- Smooth and mellow with a dry kick. O- It is earthy, it is mysterious, it is minimal, and it is a very, very good beer.

Beer is clear and not cloudy. Head is thick, and leaves a nice lacing on the glass.  Smell: Aroma filled with a strong hops aroma, and includes grapefruit, pepper, and pine smells.  Taste: There is a noticeable hops flavor, as expected from an American IPA. There is good bite from the hops along with other flavors like citrus, but the hops bitterness is not overpowering. There is a little sweetness from the malts. The aftertaste provides a variety of flavors over time. Not overly bitter or hoppy, and has a great balance.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Medium alcohol, which matches the 7.0% posted.  This is a smooth medium-bodied beer, that is easy to drink. It is one of the best IPAs I have drank, and is very well balanced.

Lacing is minimal, a light film. Quite clear with normal carbonation. Heavy aromatics and floral, piney and citrus notes on the front. Some light wheat-y sweet indicators. Citrus dominates with orange peel bitterness. Light grapefruit and rose notes. Then, orange peel and lemongrass. Overall, very nice aroma. Flavor comes in with heavier grapefruit than the aroma would indicate. NIce transition from sweet fruit to hops bittering. Flavor is quite intense. Balanced, but more sweet in front and bitter behind. BItter lasts long, and builds throughout the session, but it's not off-putting. Mouthfeeel is quite full for a beer so light and clear. Very satisfying but at the same time sessionable. Alcohol content, while high for its type, is an afterthought. Personally, this is one of the best beers of this type I have had.

I love you, Two-Hearted. I loved you always stocking yourself in the fridge of my college apartment, I loved you after long shifts of tending a bar, I loved you as a teacher- of what ""quality"" in beer means, of the conversations good beer can catalyze, of the IPA-per-day limits of a single human tongue (and body). I love you now and always.

Here's one story...  An inch or so of fine-bubbled head, off-white in color, is resting on top of an opaque, amber liquid. Retention is good, and little latticed patterns of lacing drape around the glass.  Let's take the first whiff! Grapefruit- particularly zest- combined with an additional, slightly resiny and syrupy hop character hit you first. As the beer warms just a tad, you notice the increased depth of aromas, including some bready malt, mellow caramel, and more and varied citrus, which greet the senses subtly rather than sharply. It is still the grapefruit and resin that own the hop show. By the time the beer is half gone, and perhaps 5 degrees warmer, a certain pattern emerges to this nose: Bready caramel and slight citrus --> Solid grapefruit/orange zest, perhaps a touch of nectarine --> resin and sticky hop notes (though mellow rather than cloying) and more grapefruit.  Taste is wonderful, and only gets better for a while. I'd say the beer flavor (somewhat predictably for East Coast and Midwest IPAs due to larger malt presence) holds up very well to slight warmth, even palatable as the beer's temp has increased well over 10 degrees. Still- it is in those first few minutes, when the malt character has just begun to become more pronounced and yet the grapefruit is still high-flying- where the beer is at its peak. From the first sip after the bottle cracks, bready malt and grapefruit are there. This is, for the most part, the first impression of every sip. Mid-palate the other citrus qualities- namely lemon and orange zest- are more apparent, while the finish again reiterates grapefruit with some attached resiny and floral qualia that sustains a complex and complete aftertaste buoyed by a strong and salient bitterness. To me, this exact execution of bitterness (and I admit, this may be a product of my attachment to the brew) is the gold standard by which I relate all other beers that feature hop bitterness as their essential grammar. I'll admit to other IPAs having better hop and malt profiles and more memorable flavor attributes, for sure. I'll admit that some IPAs are even much more pleasant drinking experiences as a whole. But when I think of the way bitterness is implemented the floral and grapefruit-mounted smack of a Two-Hearted is my ne plus ultra. A mellow caramel malt character increases as we go. It all works very well. A wonderful IPA in flavor.  Rounded mouthfeel and medium carbonation characterize the feel of the beer. Dry-ish, slightly under-attenuated finish is nice and prevents those latent sticky hops and caramel malts from hijacking the overall balanced impression. Slightly prickly and refreshing at every stage. Glorious. I was surprised to find that the feel may actually be my favorite aspect of the beer.  A beer that makes me happy. A beer that is tremendously executed. A fantastic beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Vetbidder,4.13,"Nice color and head to this beer. I'm getting serious sweet citrus on the nose. Very well balanced taste. Not the hops bomb I was expecting, this beer goes from hoppy to malty quickly with a dry finish. Decent amount of carbonation. This is an easy drinker in the IPA class. No real lingering bitterness. I like this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Benjolovesbeer,4.22,"This may have been my 1st IPA ever and it is delicious but with so many new hops in the market I can no longer give this beer a 5 on the rating scale. The use of citrus hops is brilliant with a strong orange taste but after consuming many other hoppy beers over the years this beer is not a beer i'd probably ever buy again. Back when this beer was $6.99 for a 6 pack it was my all time favorite but now it's $10.99 and just not worth the buy. Breweries like Stone and Founders Centennial and Green Flash West Coast just blew this beer out of the water. It was a beer that deserved a 5, 5 years ago but not now. Still delicious but too citrusy without strong notes of other hops and not as citrusy as it could be. So with that said this is a great IPA starter beer for someone not use to hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,CHCAsheville,4.36,"Bell's Two Hearted has become my favorite ""first beer"" to the point that I now always ask if it's available. Other raters have talked about its floral or citrus notes, but I don't care for either floral or citrus, and it tastes great to me, a wee-heavy ale. I say it's a first beer because it is a little heavy, and one is great, two I can't finish. Highland Gaelic, by comparison, is not bad but it's not even half the character of this beer. If you like Two-Hearted but want to go lighter for your second, Highland Gaelic or Rogue Dead Guy might be candidates.

287,1093,Oopssorryy,4.19,"Pours a murky, dark, golden color, with amber shinning through in the light. An inch of white creamy head forms leaving behind fantastic lacing. Wish the head lasted a bit longer, as it quickly fades to a white cap. Light malt can be found in the nose, along with soft citrus, all with a backbone of strong resinous pine.  The flavor starts with the malt, and if you let the beer sit on your tongue you get sharp carbonation along with some of the soft citrus the nose hinted at. Upon swallowing you are hit with a wave of grapefruit, orange, and bitterness. This all transitions to the resiny pine found while smelling, with the bitterness stays at a constant. It's not bitter by IPA standards, just enough to let you know it's there. All the flavors linger on the tongue together giving you a picture of the total drinking experience in one snapshot of flavor.  A medium bodied beer, with what feels like high carbonation, it's a good beer, but not one I'd cal especially easy drinking. A beer to have during dinner, but not one to session in my mind.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Squire,4.1,"Appearance is clear light gold with good cap and lacing.  Aroma is equally malt and hops which is a harbinger of things to come. Malt is rich and the spicy, conifer hops are in sharp focus.  Taste is hop forward on entry announcing they're there without overshadowing the malt which appears mid palate to balance the hops then both march abreast to the finish which is clean with a lingering hop bitter/sharp note which quickly fades. A subtle dry finish that invites another taste.  Medium texture with a roundness that's appealing.  Overall it's easy to see why this one is so well spoken of. Malt and hops achieve a ringing balance that belie the overall complexity one gets after studying the beer a bit. Yes, I know it's ale but I call them all beer. This is an enthusiast's brew with crossover appeal. It is a bit hoppy for those not accustomed to craft beers but it's a controlled blast strong enough to get the job done without damaging surrounding structures. It's just got that whack to it that makes you realize you are drinking a well designed, well crafted, set apart brew that emphasizes what's special about craft beer generally.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Smell-The smell is apricot dominant, no doubt from the myrcene hops. There are also aromas of mango which is followed by a very biscuit malt backbone.  Taste-The taste follows the nose, but I get the malts first which transform from biscuit into a caramel malt explosion. Then after a mild delay I get a splash of hop oils and slight bitterness to balance out everything. The whole experience is bursting with juicy fruits which are focused on tropical or citrus varieties. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and finishes with a lingering alpha acid coating on the tongue.

287,1093,Kdubzz,4.57,"Glad to find some Bell's in the South. I've heard of this beer and was eager to give it a try. It's an opaque amber-orange, with an small off white head that laces mildly. On the nose, I catch mango and pineapple, or perhaps some other tropical fruits, as well as a buttery, toasted malt character that's subtle, but balancing in it's effect. The taste follows. It's light and refreshing with some floral and tropical notes, followed by some residual piny-ness that ends in a dry, malty finish. Medium mouthfeel with medium-high carbonation. A superbly balanced and flavorful IPA. Quite possibly the best I've had so far.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Bulabeers,5,"Look: Orange Gold, white head Smell: apricot, grapefuit, oranges Taste: citrus, floral, caramel, perfectly balanced hops and malts Feel: refreshing and perfect Overall: best readily available IPA in existence",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Riff,4.27,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker glass. Color was a dark amber to almost a light brown. White foamy head, about a finger thick. Strong smell of citrus and pine followed by a little bread. Taste is citrusy, leaning towards grapefruit, following into a bit of pine, and then finishes with a bready flavor. A little bit of malt to balance out the hops. Feel is light, not quite a medium bodied beer, floats about the mouth. Finishes quickly and cleanly, a little lingering pine flavor that is kind of nice actually. While I wouldn't have this as a regular drinker for me it's certainly a pleasant beer that I wouldn't mind picking up from time to time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Brom732,3.9,"Look - 4 – A hazy light gold color with an inch of off white head. Leaving some vertical lacing on the sides of the stein it's in.  Smell – 4 - Smells of floral/citrus hops and light malt. Really crisp and clean smell to it.  Taste – 3.75 – crisp and bitter floral hop taste is nice with a light malt backbone. Getting some pine hops too. There are some great hop flavors in this beer and the hop bitterness is really sharp on the tongue when cold.  Feel- 4 – has a light crisp feel to it, a slight alcohol warmth. Crisp, clean, not too light but not heavy.  Overall- 4 – Solid IPA, lots of bitter floral hop flavor to it with some malt to hold it together. The appearance. Would buy again if given the chance but not gonna go out of my way for it.  Special Note- First beer that I've had where a piece of a hop was present in the bottle and ended up in my mouth. A nice surprise!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Cylinsier,4.61,"12 oz  Pours a mostly clear amber gold, white head retains as a film.  Smells of caramel and biscuit malt with fresh grapefruit and pine hops.  Tastes of biscuit malts, honey, grapefruit, pine resin, and fresh fruity hops.  Medium to full body with tingly carbonation on the roof of the mouth.  Been drinking this for years and only just realized I'd never reviewed it. Top notch IPA, lots of love about this. Great aroma, great flavor, great body. The balance is perfect, everything is pronounced but nothing is overwhelming. One of the best IPAs you can get.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Taste follows spot on with nose, citrus, grapefruits, pine. Not too bitter at all. F- Nice mouth feel for such a hoppy beer. It's heavy and strong but feels almost medium bodied. O- Well, this was a very nice ipa. I don't prefer this type of beer, but it was very enjoyable. A nice introduction into ipa's. If your looking for a ipa that's not too overwhelming, check this out!

287,1093,PhilsPils,4.63,"Slightly murky golden orange color. Wonderful aroma of every hop note you can think of. Perfectly balanced with just the right combination of bittering hops to malt sweetness. Very full-flavored and aromatic. I can't imagine an IPA fan not loving this beer. This was one my early IPA discoveries and back in the day, there weren't very many beers that could compare. Two Hearted is just as good today as it ever was but maybe it doesn't stand out from the crowd quite as much as it once did just because of the sheer numbers of great IPAs out there. Still a benchmark IPA as far as I am concerned.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Guppy314,4.8,"This has full, satisfying, Malty flavorfulness blended with ample Hoppy bitters and a tangy alcohol finish.

287,1093,Bruno74200,4.05,I'm really disapointed with that one. Maybe it's a bit old (it was brewed four months ago) but there are almost no hops left. Lemony and malt forward. It gets better as it warms up but nothing of the world class brew everyone talks about.

An absolute masterpiece.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,anon,4.09,"32oz cup on tap at Point Loma Seafoods. The Amber hue holds true with all other reviews, cloudy with a small head and some lace sticking to the sides throughout.  Very floral and tropical on the nose, mango, papaya, pine and candied malt. Excellent flavors following through; definite piney presence but not being overly bitter. Grass, straw and earth. Grapefruit and citrus zest. Rounds out at the end with candied malt and a slight toasty, breadiness that lingers into the finish. Nice and clean.  A great IPA. Deserving of its rating. Enjoyed with fresh shrimp tacos and a nice ocean view, a perfect pairing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,OldSwampy,3.96,"Nice amber color with very nice head, cream color and somewhat stiff and fluffy. Nose not huge but balanced hops come through clearly. Taste similar: obvious hops that wax and wane evenly. Malts are well-behaved, second to the hops in both nose and taste. Balance is what I keep getting here. Not high complexity, not huge flavor, but a pure pale ale package that's not too crazy. The citrusy (grapefruits?) flavor of the hops comes through clearly.  Brown bottle ""PKGD 03/03/16"" poured into a beer glass; I'd like to try this one from a can as well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Hallu,4.4,"This one spoke to me very clearly when I smelled it : candied tangerine, like the one you would find on a French ""baba au rhum"" or what the Americans would call a babka. It's a very very pleasant smell, so different from most IPAs. It's like 50 % grapefruit, 50 % tangerine, and it smells so fresh... Well done Bell's, this is a first for me. I've had peach, pineapple, grapefruit obviously, even ginger/galanga, but never tangerine. The taste is great as well, very balanced, very pleasant. Not as fruity, it's more bitter and you taste the malts very well.

287,1093,Knutson_16,4.22,"Appearance: Light orange, amber color with a thick white head. Somewhat cloudy with some bubbles from the carbonation.  Smell: Notes of citrus, pine, hops, and tropical fruit such as mango. There are also some floral and spruce notes (almost like sap).  Taste: Mildly bitter, which is to be expected out of an American IPA. Has obvious citrus notes from the hops, as well as a spruce/sap/pine flavor. It also has a crisp, refreshing finish which is delicious. Overall the taste follows the nose really well.  Mouthfeel: Does not taste alcoholic at all. It is slightly carbonated which gives the beer its crisp feel. This beer is also fairly smooth and well balanced. The flavors work well together and create a delicious citrus aftertaste.  Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. It isn't overly bitter like a lot of IPAs are. The flavors work really well together. I would highly recommend this beer to those who want a flavorful beer that isn't sweet or overly bitter.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,FBarber,4.02,"Pours a semi-cloudy orange color. Thick pillowy off-white head dissipates until there is just a mountain of velvety foam in the center of the glass. Really a very pretty IPA. Aroma has notes of pine, dried grass, and a strong prominent floral aroma with a touch of underlying citrusy notes. The aroma immediately sets this apart from the other beers, while still falling in line with the other ones. How is it different? Well the others all had that strong pine aroma whereas this one is far more floral. That being said, that could just be a difference in the hop bill used in this one. Where its similar to the other WCIPAs is that its very hop forward. The nose really doesn't give off much in the way of maltiness rather showcasing the hops.  Next up, the taste. The flavor has notes of pine, a distinct woodsiness, and a strong floral happiness. There is a distinct maltiness to the profile, but its deferential to the hops. In that regard, its a departure from the other WCIPAs in that its got a more prominent malt profile. The hops provide a pronounced bitterness that lingers into the finish. Feel is moderately bodied, with bright carbonation. Drier finish due to the pronounced bitterness.  Overall, its a great IPA - but in terms of whether its a WCIPA or not - I think it falls in line with the general markers of a WCIPA, and feel that it has far more in common with them than it does differences.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Enough bitterness to balance without overwhelming,  O: I've had this beer many times over the years. I know it's good but I don't typically go back and re-sample.

287,1093,Beginner2,4.05,"I had a contest between two of my favorite Midwest breweries (for which there are at least five) to see who made the best IPA (a style I shy away from, but is hard to avoid.) In this contest, my second mistake was that I tasted both while eating leftover pizza when the style should be paired with spicy food. Since I structured the contest wrong, it should be a draw. So it is.  I rate this very, very close to Lagunitas' IPA. The big difference is Bell's seems to have more control over its use of hops to blend the overall taste more distinctively.  Bell's Two Hearted Ale is listed as one of the ""1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die"" and it deserves to be there by popular acclaim.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,WindUpBird,4.48,The beer is a lovely amber/honey color with a vigorous creamy head that leaves a delicate lace on the glass as it recedes. The smell is piney citrus with and underlying sweetness. The taste is satisfyingly complex with layers of hoppy goodness supported by a perfectly subtle malty foundation underneath. The mouthfeel is clean and refreshing...a lovely ipa.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,NastyNorseman,4.3,A delicious honey-colored IPA that goes down smoothly. Very drinkable and will definitely be a repeat purchase down the road. The citrus flavors are excellent.

287,1093,rrock44,4.12,"Picked up a sixer at the Belmont station. Reading the threads, two hearted gets a lot of love. I think the best thing about two-hearted is how smooth it is. Really goes down nicely. Reminds me more of an English IPA vs American IPA. I guess I am used to IPAs with the hops in your face. Glad I got to try, but better IPAs in my neck of the woods.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MacMalt,4.29,"Poured into IPA glass. It pours a cloudy, honey-orange color with a thick, milk-white head and extensive lacing. It has all the classic IPA smells: pine needles, grapefruit, orange peel, and floral hops, and a whiff of caramel, but the smells are rather subtle and not as dramatic as with some of the West Coast IPA's I've had. While all the smells can be tasted, I especially like the orange or tangerine. There is lots of bitter hoppiness but the citrus is really refreshing. This ale is medium-bodied, moderately carbonated, and with an ABV of 7% it's really drinkable. It's refreshing and a really pleasant IPA to drink. I understand, and concur, with its excellent rating.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,ChrisCage,4.17,"A- This pours a cloudy dark gold/amber color with an initial thick fluffy foam head that is white in color itself. This settles rather quickly into a thin layer over the beer with what look like little crop circles scattered everywhere! The yeasty haze makes it too difficult to see what the carbonation appears to be and as for lacing, well, it is alright, but eventually all of the small patches of foam slide back into the liquid nectar! It looks alright overall, just nothing special I guess.  S- Well this definitely smells of an IPA style Ale! There are many aromas of heavy hop bitterness, but blended into this are hints of malt sweetness that are become quite caramel like as it warms, floral Earthy tones, yeasty creaminess and lingering citrus fruits on the finish.  T- This is a very well balanced IPA and the flavors follow the nose rather well....the caramel sweetness is much more than I would have first guessed but balances the floral hop bitterness on the finish rather nicely....the citrus character shows itself more and more as this warms up towards room temperature, and also gets creamier and more robust as time goes on....superb overall!  M/O- This is medium/full bodied in my opinion and where I thought this would be in terms of bitterness was surprisingly smooth and balanced...don't get me wrong, there is plenty of bitterness, but it is refined and doesn't overpower....this makes for a highly drinkable Ale. This is also exquisite with Lindt Dark Lime Zest chocolate as an accompaniment.....I would buy this again, but it isn't available in my area...I was lucky to get this in a trade some time ago....it holds up well against the ravages of time for your information!

287,1093,drgonzo767,4.14,"Picked up a single bottle. Pours amber with light orange. Smells less distinct than the West Coast hop bombs (love that strong smell) but is representative of a good IPA. Very good balance in taste between malt and the good hops. Light on carbonation, aftertaste and feel on the tongue is just about perfect. Hides its 7% ABV very well. Really a well-balanced IPA, would be a great introduction to the style for a beginner.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MarkQ617,4.04,"Have had this several times, finally getting around to doing a review. Had this on tap at mellow mushroom. Color is a deep golden with a slight orange hue. The flavors and aroma were nice and floral, definite british hops notes...they were just a little light, could have used more flavor. Mouthfeel was nice for an ipa, very smooth. To be honest...this is an above average IPA, but feels a bit overrated.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Stout7,4.68,"Scoring this high with a 7%ABV and $10/six, don't know of more good beer for your money. For now, my go-to beer. This is (for my palate) much closer to a British pale ale or bitter, vice the citrus and pine IPAs now ubiquitous here.  The pour looks to me again, like a British pale ale, a warm bronze-orange body with a tight, ecru head dissipating to a ring. I picture it on a worn oak bar--it's that familiar.  Smooth, rich, complex...it has it all. The finish is stunning, bursting with a crisp zing reminiscent of older, famous eastern European pilsners. How they pull that off and keep the mature bitter snap to it is beyond me, but why analyze a sunset?  95 is a very high score, but well deserved. If you factor in bang for your buck, it's way closer to 100. Next time I have it, gonna make sure I have some serious pretzels. That's the only thing this beer doesn't bring to the table.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Jdiggity,4.14,"Just had out of the pint can and into a tulip glass. It's a beer I have often and have respect for because of it's consistency. This smells of citrus and an overall floral bouquet, some lavender is there which I find unique to two hearted ale. It tends to the floral side and less to the tropical fruit and resin of a west coast style IPA, but hints of these are in the nose, however. That being said the taste is refreshingly bitter with a pleasant presence of malt, not sweet but truly balanced. It is a remarkable beer for what it is year in and year out. I can taste a slight variation in the hop profile between batches, but the floral component is always there. It's a classic ale that I will always gravitate towards when I want something familiar and simply good. It's not a flavor bomb, but subtle and floral like the difference between a French Sancerre and California Sauvignon Blanc in wine terms. It's more subtle and nuanced for an IPA and that makes it worthy of being a classic, always welcome in my fridge.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BuckyBeerBeaver,4.15,"Thanks to a couple of Bucky’s roaming minions, he was able to sample a 16 fl. oz. can of Two Hearted Ale (“THA”) from Bell’s Brewery Inc. of Comstock, MI. THA was 7.0% alcohol by volume.  THA poured a slightly hazy amber/orange colour topped by 2” of orange-tinged off-white head. The head gradually faded to a central blob of foam, leaving some sporadic lacing down the glass. Its aroma was a mix of grapefruit, lemon, orange and, caramel. The taste was a good balance between the sweetness of the caramel malts, and the combination of sweet tropic fruits (papaya, orange) and bitter citrus flavours from the hops (lemon, grapefruit). THA had a mildly bitter finish and a short-lived aftertaste that did not overstay its welcome. The beer had a soft carbonation, fell on the light side of light/medium bodied and had a creamy mouthfeel. Good work minions!

My tongue palate must have been shot.  Don't get me wrong, it is just that Founders Centennial IPA became my go to 6-pack IPA a week later. Modern Times' City of the Sun, what I am drinking now, it better.  This beer is better than average, meaning better than Sierra Nevada. It's also better than a majority of west coast IPA's.

This beer will always hold a special place in my heart.  L: Slightly hazy golden color with a dense rocky head of off-white coloration at a two and a half finger head. Incredible retention.  S: Rich citrus hop aroma consisting of grapefruit and orange, super juicy smelling. A floral grassy note and some light toasted malts in the character of doughy biscuits.  T: Just a wonderfully juicy IPA with grapefruit and orange citrusy notes to start with. Then it takes on this more floral grassy side which turns into a faint yeasty note mostly covered by doughy biscuity malts. Really a superbly complex IPA with a nice hop bite.  F: Light-Medium bodied, with a good amount of carbonation and some drying finish.  O: This is an American IPA classic brew. Hits all the marks perfectly.

Taste: Very balanced taste that starts off with the bitter bite of the citrus flavored hops followed by a nice balance of sugary sweetness from the malt. A nice representation of the American IPA style.  Feel: Light to medium mouthfeel that leaves a pleasant lingering aftertaste that diminishes slowly after every sip.  Overall: I would say I'm satisfied with this beer from Bell's Brewery. I was glad I finally was able to get some and it surely did not disappoint.

287,1093,Sabtos,3.33,"I've had this multiple times in various forms, bottle, draft, and even hand pumped cask.  Orange, amber, chill haze heaping voluminous mounds of large, dense bubbly foam leaving spongy lace.  There is a pretty definitive showcase of grapefruit on the nose, as well as pine. This is a classic, after all.  In taste, I get pine first, then grapefruit. Toasty malt come in to support the hops at a moderate level.  Finish is pretty dry and bitter. Revisiting this beer many times, I easily realize how much this would have turned me off long ago. I was not one of the many who find IPAs most approachable, then move on to darker beers. IPAs were my arch enemy, and this was one of my most hated. But not I can see how well made and consistent this brew really is.  I have also had this on cask, When on cask, I get notes of amaretto, some sort of delicate flower, and passionfruit. On cask these flavors are most prominent, with almost no bitterness to detect, and an unbelievably smooth texture to the point I wonder if it's a beer, especially IPA, at all.  The vast differences between the cask and the standard versions of this beer or so drastic it's unreal, and I'm not sure which I prefer more, because the cask is also odd in its own way, and the warmth doesn't help.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Back_in_the_Saddle,4.53,"I used to live in the upper peninsula of Michigan a long time ago. I am an avid fisherman that would love to fish the St Mary's River most of the time. After a good night of catching my limit, I'd almost always love to stop at the local corner store and buy a sixer of this. The sixer wouldn't last less two days back then. And that was for a reason. Always in a pint glass, never any other beer glass, this had the appearance of a ruddy bronzed earthy brown to orange color with a one finger level foamy white head. Strings of lacing slid down the glass enroute to the beer in a nonchalant way. The smell takes in earthy to floral to spicy hops combining over a light basic caramel malt. The taste wraps together the hops and the malts to be a purely blissful bittersweet flavor. Faint combination of flavors in the aftertaste and a charming wet finish. The mouthfeel grasped a nice sessionably sweet stickiness to slide over my tongue yet still telling me ""don't pound me treat me right, please sip."" With that in mind, carbonation rides fairly light in this beer allowing the nuances of the aromas to come together wonderfully. Overall, do you think I don't miss this beer? If I still lived in its distro, a sixer of this would always accommodate my fridge. Its the IPA that got me into IPA's and craft beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Myotus,4.11,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (packaged 02Aug15) into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Consumed on 10Nov15. LOOK: Pours with a finger and half worth of white foam that dissipates into a half finger's worth after 45 seconds. Honey orange in color. There is a large amount of both small and medium-sized rising bubbles. Lacing is high in quantity and both thick and think I'm various areas. SMELL: There are mild aromas of buttered bread that meet with mild piney hop aromas, subtle aromas of gummy fruit snacks, and hints of alcohol. TASTE: Initial taste is of strong piney hops that are immediately followed by mild buttered bread flavors. Subtle gummy fruit snack flavors enter next. Subtle bitter hop flavors enter lastly as all previous flavors persist. FEEL: Medium-bodied and subtly carbonated. Goes down smooth and creamy. Finishes with a strong dryness. NOTE: I wasn't getting any citrus or floral flavors, which surprised me. The beer wasn't that fresh, either, so that may have been a reason why. This was a pretty great IPA for being 3 months old.

287,1093,pinyin,4.1,"Tried and true 2 Hearted is a fairly unique offering from Bells in the presently saturated IPA market.  Wide distribution footprint, readily availible in the northeast, fairly priced and a high quality product.  Served 40F from the 16 ounce pounder can. Poured into 12 ounce snifter.  Really nice slightly hazy golden orange color. Lacing is perfect. Not too agressive, but hangs around for a while.  The nose is somewhat subdued when weighed against the taste. I get a very slight mosaic and caramel scent. If any dry hopping occurred here it was very minimal.  Also note that this ale was canned on August 11th and the local grocery store just got this shipment 3 days ago. Erie distribution does a horrible job getting ales fresh to the customer. This seems to have been laying in their warehouse for at least 3 months.  Taste is very solid. A little bit sugary for my liking but really well balanced. The malts and hops align well and produce a unique formula. I get notes of pear, pine and orange zest from the hops. Pilsner and crystal notes from the malts.  For a 7% abv, I taste barely any alcohol. This being the fourth time I have tried Two Hearted in the past 4 years, this canned 4 month old version seems to be the best, and the freshest.  Great ale, but nearly impossible to find fresh. I would also note that 2 Hearted is very close in taste and quality to Ballast Point Sculpin, minus the inflated price tag.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

T: Very hop forward, but with just enough carmel malts to calm the bitterness. The hops follow the nose - floral, spicy, and a little bit earthy.  F: Crisp, soft, and medium bodied.  O: Delicious.

Aroma is a nicely balanced blend of citrusy and floral hops. Notes of orange and spice.  Taste is likewise a nice citrusy floral hop combo on top of a blend of pale and caramel malts. A touch of malty sweetness tempered by alpha acid bitterness. Yeast lends it a vaguely Belgian tang.  Mouthfeel is balanced and medium bodied. Again, the yeast gives it a softness not typical of most American IPAs. Nicely satisfying.  Overall a solid, relatively complex, well crafted, balanced IPA.

Smell : Mostly tropical aromas. Freshly diced pineapple, a hint of peach, with a faint sparkle of biscuit malts. A slight sweat funk can also be smelled, but it's pretty faint here. Typical, run of the mill IPA aromas.  Taste : A nice strong fruity bite sets in, with lots of bitter rinds and pith. Mostly grapefruit, a bit of apricot, orange. Very faint pine, but subdued enough to be detected and not stealing the show. Slight dankness. The malts are both bitter biscuit and cracker-like, and the grapefruit pith carries out to the end with a slight dryness.  Feel : Substantially creamy and a total party in the mouth pumped with carbonation. I think this is what most people rave about on this beer, the feel is so smooth and it's so drinkable.  Overall : This beats most IPA's in its price range. It's flavorful enough to be enjoyed as a sipper, but quaffable enough to be a session beer.

287,1093,youcantmakeme,4.25,This is probably the ipa i like the most out of all that i have tried (not a lot) . It's easy to drink (smooth) and refreshing. The reason why I say it's been the best so far is because they don't try to spice it up much if you know what I mean. Its like they took a larger (pick your favorite one) and put in a machine where slightly amped the malt to like a 3/5 and the hops to about the same. So in other words imo it's well balanced. The only reason why I don't give this beer a five is because it's a little expensive compared to others when it seems like most ipa should be like this but somehow they go and funk it up and make something undrinkable.

287,1093,JackiO,4.85,"Aroma: Initial blast of floral hops. Toasty/bready and slightly sweet malt follow which almost gives the impression of a candied orange blossom. Very clean, no distinct esters.  Appearance: Hazy golden orange. Thick, dense lasting white head.  Flavor: Floral and lightly citrusy hops are forward. Moderate bitterness. Moderate toast and bready malt. Very balanced.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, medium carbonation.  Overall: It took a long time for me to try this beer because I thought it was overhyped. I could not have been more wrong. This is absolutely everything I want in a beer. The malt character is more distinct than most IPA's which makes it very balanced. The hops are definitely the star, but the malt gives this beer substance. The flavors are beautifully mixed. It is hard to top this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Aroma- Juicy hop aromas with sweet citrus, peach, and mango. Some malt sweetness, but the hops dominate.  Taste- Follows the nose closey with juicy hops up front that yield mild bitterness. The malt is balanced between caramel sweetness and bready malts adding dryness in the finish.  Feel- Medium bodied, medium carbonation, and a sweet/clean finish.  Overall- This would be a go-to if it were in my distro. Great balance between juicy hops and sweet/dry malts. A top tier ipa for sure that definitely competes with the best ipas.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Two finger fluffy white head.  S - Citrus/orange heavy. Biscuit and malt. Hops (pine) on the finish.  T - Similar to the nose. Based on the age, the malts are more present than the hops in relation to some previous hads.But it is still balanced and tasty.  M - Carbonation is medium low, mouthfeel is creamy.  O - One of my favorite IPAs.

287,1093,Dikfour,4.22,Look: Two fingers of creamy beautiful white head dissipates a little quicker than I expected. Pretty lacing. Fairly active carbonation. Color is a hazy amber-copperish.  Smell: Floral citrus hops. Blood or mandarin oranges. Undertones of biscuit.  Taste: Orange citrus up front. Biscuit malts on the mid palate. Piney bitter finish. Supremely well balanced. Fairly complex.  Feel: Medium body and carbonation. Slightly sticky. Delightfully crisp.  Overall: Pretty dang great. Every ingredient is in near perfect balance and has a plesant citrus hop profile. This one's a win for me.

Lots of carbonation bubbles and multiple rings of lacing down the glass.  S: Aroma is mainly floral hops and biscuity malts. Some light pine and citrus hop aromas as well.  T: Crisp, refreshing flavors of floral hops with a good amount of biscuity malts balancing it all out. Faint pine and citrus, but nowhere near as strong as the floral hop aromas.  M: Clean, crisp mouthfeel with a medium body and moderate bitterness. Medium-high amount of carbonation.  O: Overall I thought this was an excellent IPA with perfect balance that could be great to pair with a variety of different foods. It has good hop flavors that are strong but not overwhelming, and the perfect amount of malt to balance it all out.

Tastes of hops, the air in a pine forest, and more hops. Was going to rate taste 4.25 but the amazing aftertaste changed my mind, so bitter and wonderful. Tried this several months back and didnt really appreciate it until now. Fantastic ipa.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,sjdevel,4.66,"Look: There is plenty of foam when poured from a 12oz. bottle (2 - finger head). It is a nice clear yellow / gold color. It remains quite effervescent and continues to lace after the head fades out.  Smell: Very strong fruity floral hop scents and tartness. There is a slight tart aroma as well.  Taste: There is an immediate hop bitterness that bursts out at first. Soon after the initial bite, a smooth and sweet yeasty taste fades in. This is a rich malty and fruity flavor that doesn't stick around for long as there is another phase of hop tartness and a very full floral rush, followed by a dry finish.  Feel: This beer has a low-medium body that has a medium dryness on the tongue.  Overall: This is a great, and I mean great, IPA. I didn't believe the hype about this beer as it is one of the top rated IPAs around. I grew up in Michigan and never had any of Bell's beers when I lived there (very sad now) but am glad to have tasted a few on my trip to visit family. I would definitely buy this (and even order online and have it shipped) as I think this is what an IPA should taste like.

287,1093,taxandbeerguy,4.17,"473 ml can served reasonably cool into a an Amsterdam Boneshaker snifter. Purchased while in Niagara Falls, New York. Given the reputation that precedes this beer, I had to try it. Appears to have been packaged June 8, 2015 so this is nearly a couple months old.  Appearance - A medium pour yielded a cloudy coppery beer, with a plethora of sediment gently floating in space within the beer and capped by a finger and change of light white fluffy head. Modest retention but some of the lacing sticks to the glass leaving behind a cobwebbed pattern.  Smell - Very citrus pineapple and tangerine being the primary culprits. A wack ton of sugary caramel oozes in behind. a slight spicy lemony note finishes things up.  Taste - Actually starts quite earthy with some leaps and musty hops, the kind that usually pair well with grapefruit. That's followed by some increasing sweetness where the tangerines and pineapple come to play before finish with a more bitter turn. There's some caramel flavors in there which pop up as the beer flavors transition provide something smooth and quite tasty. A coarse, crackery grain flavor is the tailing flavor on a few sips as the beer warms even more.  Mouthfeel - Prickly carbonation and a drier than average finish, oilier than other IPA's but it works here, making this a smooth drinking beer.  Overall - A damn good IPA that just about lives up to its reputation as being one of the best. I'd prefer even more tropical citrus punch (which may have been eveident with a fresher can) but even still a high quality IPA, that was worth the purchase. Definitely a must try for IPA fans and hop lovers alike.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,aleigator,3.93,"Pours a froth, beautiful bubble durchzogen white head, with a sunny amber, slighty hazy color.  Smells of grass driven orange, coated up by bitter lemon zest. Citrus peel grows stronger, as the beer warms up with unripe, sour kiwi, as well as apricot skin. Still, the maltiness is very strong on the nose, adding a note of earth and rock sugar to the hops.  Has a medium carbonation, exhibiting a refreshing, hop forward beer, with lots of exotic fruits to it, as well a prominent malt backbone.  Begins with sweeter, biscuity malts, revealing toffee infused rye bread, giving the malts a pleasant depth, balancing the well pronounced hops easily. Reveals surprisingly sweet toffee malts, which get joined by far reaching lime juice, which lends the beer a profound, bitter refreshment. The hops get enhanced by dried tangerine peel and apple stones, providing an aggressive dryness, which features a worthy counterpart to the well developed malt backbone, staying on the tongue for a longer while.  Well balanced, easy drinking ipa which isn't convincing only for its hoppy part, but also for its eigenständig malty part, adding to the hops, while balancing them, without cutting them short in any way. Old school ipa, with a straight forward, long lasting hoppiness, providing a great fruiti- and dryness, successfully coated up by the malts.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Strong floral aroma, closely followed by a similar taste in the tongue with a little peach to round things out, along with perfect bitterness.

Aroma yields floral hops, big citrus, some tropical fruits, big mango/papaya sweetness, and a kiss of lemony pine.  Taste is a kick of pine bitterness up front. This is followed by the hop floralness, some citrus (mainly grapefruit rind), and a prevalent malt back bone.  The beer is overall very well rounded. However, I do prefer less pine bitterness in my beers. I like more tropical fruits. Still a very good standard. I see this pairing well with a spicy goat stew.

287,1093,Ravenfan,4.62,"Some IPA's are too bitter for my liking, they overdo the hops in an attempt to outdo each other. This one from Bell's is different it's definitely hoppy, but has enough malt to let you focus on the taste instead of the bitterness. Grapefruit and maybe just a bit of sour orange mix in together to make this a very refreshing beer. Perfect summer sipping beer. Beautiful golden/orange color, very nice head and lacing, and as I said not so bitter that it kills the flavors like some IPA's do. This is the first beer I've had from Bell's in Maryland, but will be trying more, after this was recommended by one of the bartenders at the local bar I frequent.

Those tropical, tangerine, orange, and fruit esters on the nose are remarkable even for a 3 month old bottle. I wish I had a fresher one. I'd probably be spellbound.  Good medium to full body.  The taste has the same amazing fruit characteristics but it all comes together with an almost sinus-cleaning bitterness that lingers dryly at the end. This one deserves the high ratings it gets.

S - Right off the bat you get a phenomenal aroma of fruity and floral sweetness. Yet very sweet smelling, it's the perfect blend of spice that prevents if from being overly bearing. Notes of various citron scents, pine, and faint hints of pepper and spice.  T - A perfect blend of malt and hops are present at the beginning of every sip; sweet yet well balanced with bitterness - neither overly baring. Finishes with mouthful of well blended spices and hints of pepper and pine. The most distinct flavors I can note are that of lemon, pine and malt.  M - Medium bodied beer with little carbonation present. Doesn't leave much of an aftertaste- very sharp, clean finish. Fluffy, full feeling beer overall.  O - This has now been my 2nd beer from Bell's and similar to the first, has left me wanting more. A few months back I got to try and fall in love with their Hopslam ale; quickly learning I will be having to wait until next winter before I get a chance to have that again. With Bell's recently being brought to my location, I got lucky enough to try another beer by them and was wholeheartedly impressed; again! An incredible IPA from an incredible company; I have no complaints.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

There is a great bit of clarity to it as well as a puffy, off white colored head atop of the beer, leaving behind nice and consistent rings of lace.  S — Smells of oranges, pine, sweet malts, and lemon. Nicely floral without being overly sweet.  T — Tastes of tangerine, orange, grapefruit, lemon, blood orange, little bit of pine. This is fresh and juicy without being sweet, very nice indeed.  M — Light in body, very smooth and is beyond easy drinking, refreshing.  O — Great overall, this has a wonderful juicy component without being sticky or overly sweet. Excellent.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Steve_Studnuts,4.3,"The body of this wonderful brew is a strikingly bright tangerine orange that really stands out amidst a crowded field of hazy, murky, chalky IPAs. It's got that familiar centennial hop scent that I personally love. Well-balanced with malts and grains and shit and I'll be damned if this doesn't remain one of the best on the market.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,OldManMetal,4.58,"This is a visually striking IPA. It pours to a giant white rocky head (pour carefully!) that sits astride a pale amber, sparkling beer muted by a promising chill haze. The sticky head leaves lots of beautiful lacing in its wake. The nose is a strong, sublime blend of citrus, florals and resinous pine with boozy undertones. The flavor hops carry through to the palate, over top of a malty foundation that gets washed over by a nice hoppy bitterness. This bitterness dominates the finish, clinging as it should for the style, joined by hints of bitter citrus and pine. The bitterness is very well-balanced relative to the flavor, being less heavy-handed than in a lot of IPAs. The fizzy carbonation is a nice counterpoint to the bitterness, and sets the medium body up for a slight creaminess that increases drinkability.

Smell is floral and citrusy with some bready malt. Taste is similar to the smell and very well balanced. Feel is medium, the beer is very crisp. I am a hop head by nature, so overall I would say this is a good IPA. I can see why people rate it as highly as they do, bc it is exceptionally well balanced while still showcasing the great hop aroma and taste, but personally it is not my favorite take on the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Sipped while walking around slices of Americana. Even the plastic cup couldn't detract from this beauty. The color is golden orange with a thick, solid head that stays put.

The piney and the citrus-grapefruit are blended in perfection. The body is heavy, sometimes feeling thick, and then breaks out into crispness and clarity. Foam and thick lace of about an inch remain and linger. Slightly baked bananas and brown sugar grapefruit are followed by pronounced hoppiness, in a perfect balance.

S: Piney hops & some herbal notes over caramelly malt.  T: Exceptional. Hop-bitter fruity & somewhat resinous character wrapped in toffee. Savory elements & flowery elements mingle on the mid-palate. Finishes with slightly lingering bitterness.  M: Nice carb helps to lighten up what would otherwise be a mighty malt body. Very dry.

A little too malty for me, but this is what most folks call ""balanced"". I wish more of the non-bitter hop flavors came through. Citrus rind on the finish.  Pretty highly carbonated. Not too light or too heavy.  I should have tried this sooner.

287,1093,m_hall,4.73,"Standard pour from a 12 oz bottle (dated 04/03/2015) into a tulip. Color is a faintly hazy orange-gold, topped by a two-finger rocky white head. Lacing is very good.  Aroma is hoppy, as expected, with bright citrus-grapefruit and evergreen notes, with bread-y malts hovering in the back.  Taste starts with a rich malt front- caramel and biscuit- that is followed by assertive hop bitterness. The sweetness of the malts and the citrus-rind hops compliment each other very well, with peppery notes and subtle fruity esters coming in from the background. The finish is dry and pine-y. Tremendously well-balanced throughout; even as the beer warms in the glass the hops somehow never become obnoxious.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and slightly oily, with fairly vigorous carbonation. Just substantial enough while being easy to drink.  I've been hearing for years how amazing this beer is, but until now it hadn't been available in my area. So when I happened to see it for sale (in my local Food Lion, no less) giving this one a try was an imperative. I was prepared for disappointment... but for once all the hype was totally justified. For me IPA's are are hit or miss- when they're done right they're great, but when even a little wrong they're terrible one-dimensional hop-bombs. This beer definitely gets it right: All of the strong hop notes that an IPA should have are there, but they live in perfect harmony with wonderful caramel malts and fruity yeast flavors. Even those who normally eschew IPA's should at least give this one a try- it's a remarkable beer that's the standard for what an American IPA should be.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The smell is loaded with orange, grapefruit and pine hops. There is a thick malty, bready backbone with some caramel as well.  The taste follows the nose with grapefruit, orange and pine hops dominating; it feels kind of like drinking a pine cone. Pine hop oil is left on the tongue after swallowing. The caramel malt backbone is present from start to finish and complements the hops. The feel is bready but also a little oily.

287,1093,dleigh,4.01,"Bottled 3/28, poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Pretty solid, nice hoppy, floral taste, but lacks the aromatics that would really set it apart from the crowd for me. Just my personal opinion, but I think this one was probably world class some years ago, but other easily-available beers have surpassed it. Like, a biplane is awesome and I respect it for it's role in history, but I'd still rather fly on a 777, you know?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,MakenziMantey,3.06,The color of this beer is a really dark yellow. The aroma you get is a citrus smell and is kind of strong.

287,1093,RockyM72,4.44,"Great IPA, golden color, not to much head, carbonation just right, smell to mango, citrus fruits and some floral, but I think is its weakness, I like stronger smells, taste is a little light for and IPA, I like it, not too bitter, and not too fruity, but with some character, easy drinkable, I'll have it again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Buck89,4.24,"Poured golden orange into an IPA glass. Generous off white head that stayed for a while and left nice tracks. Aroma was big citrus with an hint of malt.

Dry finish. a beautiful beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,apokatastasis,4.13,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Light, opaque amber in colour; average head with decent retention. Bubbly splotches of lacing which slowly dribbles their way down.  Aroma: Citrus and floral, definitely very hoppy, but with more delicate hops than the usual dose of bitterness (appearance reflects this).  Taste: Follows the nose to a large degree, with a lot of grapefruit character, but here we catch also a healthy hop bitterness and malt sweetness in the background. All throughout the floral quality is obvious, enhancing every aspect of the beer and giving it a very refined flavour.  Mouthfeel: Light, with moderate carbonation and a slight oiliness. Long bitter aftertaste which leaves the mouth dry.  Overall: This beer is decidedly floral, and I love that. To me, in the world of such an over-saturated market as IPA, the only ones which are worthwhile are things which bring something new to the palette, and the delicate nature of this IPA - from the appearance to the mouthfeel - certainly delivers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The first few sips didn't seem bad but i barely wanted to finish it, and i've never not finished a beer because of taste. I don't know, maybe the one i picked up was old and had gone bad, but it was absolute shit. Nothing pleasant about it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bigsteve45,4.2,"Appearance: Beautiful Golden/Orange Color with a thick creamy head. No other way to put it besides that this is how a beer should look. Head leaves heavy lacing.  Aroma: Citrus, Floral, Slighty Sweet. Not a very strong aroma overall though.  Taste: Being used to West Coast IPAs this beer didn’t have the kick that I am always ready for. Was actually a really well balanced beer though. Sweet orange and grapefruit flavor that follows the nose and you really get a floral hoppy backbone. Smooth. Not overpowering.  Feel: No doubt that this is a very smooth beer. Medium viscosity and just the right level of carbonation  Overall: Was a really great IPA that I have always wanted to try. Was disappointed with the nose but all other aspects of the beer made up for it. A great beer that I wouldn’t hesitate to buy again.  EDIT: Nose opened up ALOT as beer warmed. Still did not impress. But worth of some more points",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Lacing was steady and constant all the way to the end. Aroma of hops, pine, and a beautiful floral citrus. Taste is simple with a mix of citrus, strong pine, and hop bitterness. Easy drinking and nice bite on the palate. Bell's has concocted a real nice IPA here, well done!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,HorseheadsHophead,4.11,"Poured from a pint can into a pint glass, and just over two weeks old.  LOOK: A slightly hazy rusty gold with a huge, fluffy, white head that recedes to a thin but lasting film, and that leaves pretty lacing all the way down the glass.  SMELL: A simple but refreshing hop aroma. You can definitely tell it's all Centennial. Very floral, and a balance of citrus and pine.  TASTE: A small burst of piney hops upfront. Smooth grapefruit taste and a hint of orange peel. The hearty, sweet malt backbone comes through on the mid-palate, giving it body, and then it finishes slightly dry with a smack of juicy citrus and pine. Extremely drinkable.  FEEL: Medium-bodied, with medium carbonation. Juicy and slightly dry.  Overall: I love it! Expecting a world-class beer, I was unimpressed by this beer the first time I had it, but the beauty of this beer is its simplicity. It's no hop bomb, but it's smooth, balanced, and endlessly drinkable. This is the type of beer you could drink every day and not get sick of. Thank you so much, Bell's!

287,1093,TheElectricOne,4.1,"Poured from 12oz bottles into a tulip glass:  First impressions: cheap at only $10.99 for the sixer, pours a nice orangey-amber color with a big frothy head. Dissipates rather quickly, but the lacing was speckly throughout. Heard lots and lots about this brew, but never tried it as it isn't distributed in Rhode Island. Smells floral, with a little bit of grass, and lots of pine. Not much citrus or juicy nose, as is common in New England style IPAs, but lots of hop aroma nonetheless. Taste mimicks the scent, with lots of bitter, piny, and floral taste. Slight touch of tangerine, but almost all bitter. However, unlike some beers that are abusive in their bitterness, this one is nicely balanced with smooth malt and a medium body. Overall, an excellent brew; one I wish was available closer to home.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Appearance: Medium-light copper, 1/2"" off-white head. Very good retention and excellent lacing.  Aroma: Resiny, piny hops. Some grapefruit rind, but not really a fruity IPA. [Sweet citrus, pine sap, sweet malt. hearty.]  Taste: Dry, [recent bottle was quite sweet compared to the likes of Columbus IPA, Finestkind, and White Rajah] bitter, [just about as] malty [as] the nose, clean finish.  Mouthfeel: Thinner than I expected; [solidly mid bodied, clean finishing, not too slick,] ample carbonation.  Overall: This was probably my first IPA, and is one I return to over and over. It is reliably a quality beer, but nothing about it ever knocks my socks off. Just a good, bitter, balanced, reliable IPA.

M: More than a medium mouthfeel, heavier than any IPA I have ever tried, finishing dry.  O: Pretty good, for an IPA this is really balanced, I was expecting more hops but the hop characteristics are fleeting then you get a nice malt presence on the backend.

T: Floral again but not overly hoppy, and again some apple notes are noticed.  M: Medium body, and heavier than I would imagine from the sight and smell. No real alcohol flavor from the 7.0% ABV either.  D: No surprises here in flavor. It tastes just like it smells with no complex layers that I can discern. I don’t say that in a bad way, though.

287,1093,Colt-Seavers,4.04,"I don't care for IPA. That's what I always used to say when someone offered; I never seek out this style. I've tried several IPA style beers over the last 25 years and while some were notable, I never found anything enjoyable enough to purchase regularly. A friend poured a glass of Two Hearted Ale for me a couple weeks ago. My opinion has changed since that day and I've actually sought out other beers of this style since. My subjective opinion of Bell's Two Hearted Ale:  A: Light amber, unfiltered, beautiful in the sunlight. Produced one finger of light ivory head when poured into an American pint glass; dissipated quickly. Slight lacing that diminished with each sip.  S: Moderately pungent hops, floral, grapefruit zest, ester, sweet malt. All of these elements give a wonderful perfume like fragrance.  T: Grapefruit, citrus, mild piney-ester, slightly sweet malt, faint yeast, with a pleasant bitter-hop finish. Forward hops but not overpowering. It's not all hops; there's allot, but the subtle flavors in the background temper the hops . You're not simply punched in the face with hops. I tasted the sweet malt and faint yeast that I didn't identify (as much) in the smell.  M: Medium body, slightly oily, on the moderate side of carbonation; works well with the hop forward character, little alcohol bite  I tend to stick with what I know. I joined this site to break free from that routine, so I suppose it's fitting that my first review is the polar opposite from my usual hefeweizens, porters, lagers, Belgium style ales, comfort zone go-to beers. Perhaps in middle age my palate has changed. Regardless, this beer's a winner. Pleasantly surprised.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,samtrillo,3.96,"Finally got to try this in California. I'm a west coast punch you in the mouth hop head, but I do enjoy an everyday single IPA, as well. As far as that style goes this is a good IPA but I'm not blown away. Heavy on the grass and pine flavors with a bit more of a malt backing than say a Lagunitas single. Some grapefruit and tropical notes present on the nose and taste but not at the forefront. Definitely a beer I would go back to on draught but not on my radar anymore, living on the west coast.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BeerAdvocate,3.93,"From BeerAdvocate Magazine #74 (Mar 2013):  Still one of the most talked about beers in the US, its notoriety and cult-like following amongst hopheads attests to it greatness. And despite much change in the IPA world over the last decade, Two Hearted is still an IPA to reckon with thanks to its delicious hop-centric blend, balance and sheer drinkability.  STYLE: American IPA ABV: 7.0% AVAILABILITY: Year-round  LOOK: Hazed golden amber, epic head  SMELL: Orange zest, dried grass, crackers, passion fruit, estery, grapefruit pulp, yeast  TASTE: Deep smoothness, medium bodied, oily hoppiness, orangey, bready, nutty yeast, peppery, leafy, floral, semi-pungent bitterness, slightly dry finish",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,braican,3.87,"Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass.  A: Very clear, straw colored/orange, with a thin white head that travels with the beer. Some light lacing.  S: Smells like a meadow I guess? Slightly citrusy and definitely some malt.  T: On the malty side with some floral and orange notes. Maybe its just the description but I also get a little bit of resin. Not overly bitter, but there is a grapefruit bitterness towards the end.  F: Good carbonation, goes down very easily. Finishes very dry with a bit of hop bitterness. Tastes fade very quickly. Slightly more than medium bodied.  O: Pretty awesome. Glad I was able to trade for some of this.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,MeanMotaScootah,4,"Apperance: hazy golden/orangy with a couple fingers of white head  Smell: dank, sweet flower (I know that sounds weird but that's the best way to describe the aroma of this brew)  Taste: Lightly, hoppy, a clean bitterness, smooth and enjoyable. The 7% alcohol is very well hidden - it has an almost sessionable feel. A very nice moderately hoppy ipa. Not a Stone but not a Rebel, somewhere in between. A nice introduction to IPAs for those who are moving from Belgiums to West Coasty pale ales.  Feel: medium body and smooth  Overall: a solid IPA albeit on the smoother/softer side of the spectrum. Definitely get this again if I can find it.

Pours a cloudy orange-gold with a 1.5 finger head of white foam. Big hiss when I popped the cap; always a good sign. Consistent lacing all the way through. Smells like a bouquet of flowers. Very floral aroma, along with hops, citrus, orange, and lemon. Slightly heavier-bodied than I expected for an IPA, but nice mouthfeel. Taste is about the same as smell - strong hop presence, which surprised me. This beer is over 2 months old but is as fresh as any I've had. Strong presence of citrus, orange, lemon. I also detect some spices in there. Surprisingly sweet for an IPA. Aftertaste is hoppy with some orange peel.  As I finish this review, I'm on my third one, so it's very drinkable and very refreshing. Maybe not quite the IPA I'd hoped for, given all the hype. But a solid IPA for sure.

On the dry side, though the maltiness comes out more as it warms. Flavors blend very well.  Feel: medium body and smooth  Overall: It had been a couple years since I had a two-hearted. I remember thinking it was overly bitter. This sample did not bear that view out by any means. If anything it is a bit on the dry side, which I appreciate considering all the saccharine IPAs out there.

287,1093,Beer-Revelry,4.42,"A - Pours to a murky orange gold. Generates a nice finger of white soapy head, lots of little carbonation bubbles streaming up to the top, whispy lacing. S - Oranges, tangerine, light hops and even lighter slight caramel. Very sweet, smells like an orange soda in the glass. Very appetizing aroma. T - Not nearly as sweet as the aroma, the orange and tangerine are upfront but very mild and not very sweet, the hops come in back, not very bitter or strong, there is actually a strong ""beery"" taste to this, such as a pilsner or a light pale ale. Makes for a smooth and easy drinking, extremely sessionable beer, as well as an easy introduction to IPAs for domestic drinkers, but it isn't an over the top IPA for me. O - A good beer, not great, but good, could use a little more of everything, too light. More sweetness, more bitterness, I've had pale ales more bitter than this. But it is, to be sure, a GOOD beer. V - Good value, decent price and comes in a six pack!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,CIBoy10,4.41,Look- one of the best looking beers I have seen. Draught pours a persistent head and beautiful dark amber color.  Smell- not too much floral but citrus and malt predominate.  Taste- heavy hops but not overpowering like other IPAs.  Feel - silky smooth with a crisp finish. The hops don't linger a lot. I like that.  Overall - wonderful but a bit over-hyped. A must try. Honestly I prefer more floral smelling and tasting IPAs but I would definitely buy this again.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Lots of citrus and floral hop aroma and taste without the typical bitterness, along with a perfect balance of sweet malts and enough bitterness to balance everything out. Low on piney hops, which aren't my favorite anyway. Easy drinking, every time I put I down I went back for another sip. Definitely feels and tastes like a session ale, figured it was closer to 5%. Seems like a kicked up pale ale.  This beer is not overly complex, but everything is in perfect balance, and it's crazy tasty. Can definitely see why this gets so much love.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The odor is strong, IPA like, citrus, grapefruit, lemon, orange, pine, resin, malty, bread like, slight honey, slight floral, a little herbal farmhouse like. The taste is less citrus, some lemon and orange, more malty, honey, herbal, grassy, some spices, pine, woods, resin, some bitterness, but refreshing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Taybeh,4.1,"From a single (bottled about a month ago) into a cervoise glass  A: light golden orange, with a 2 finger puffy head that leaves great lacing S: pale bready malts, pine, melon, mellow bitterness T: exceptionally well constructed, first some biscuit, then some prickly piney and faint citrus hops, and then a really pleasant mellow bitterness on the end that sits on my tongue. Fairly delicate flavors. M: moderate carbonation, some nice hop oils that coat the tongue a bit, finishes moderately dry. Bitterness is pleasant and moderate (if you're a hophead).  Overall: classic. Still remember my introduction to this beer: 2006 and my (now) mother-in-law would buy it for trips up to the North Shore of Lake Superior. I couldn't believe how good it was. Since then a lot of great times and good beer has come into existence, but this is still a great beer, at least if you get it fairly fresh (...singles on mix six shelves that are approx 3 month old, are usually shadows of the real thing.) Quite often, anymore, i get a round melon note that really stands out to me and it is less than ideal...definitely not the kind of bitterness I love.

Honestly, the taste achieves a perfect or as close to perfect of balance between hops and malt as you can get. A hop bomb with a fine sweet malt backbone; hence the 5 for taste. The feel is so smooth. Medium bodied and highly drinkable. This is an IPA that I can drink in multiple quantities; almost a session beer. (Famous last words?) I truly love this one!

287,1093,joaopmgoncalves,4.77,"Notes: I drank this on the 23rd of October. This beer got to my hands after a transatlantic trip on the 3rd of September.  A: I poured the Two Hearted can into my Duvel tulip glass. The body is super cristaline, with a orange-y amber touch to it. 1 finger thick white head that had some nice lacing. S: It reminds me a lot of Pliny, which was the last IPA I had before this one - lots of pine and fruity aromas, more like citrus. T & M: The hops presence here is beautifully made since it is backed by the pine and citrus on the aroma. The hops are so awesome that even though this beer has only 42 IBUs, you want to play with it in your mouth, going from one side of the tongue to another, enjoying every sip of this beer. The alcohol is barely noticeable and the carbonation is awesomely done.  O: It's the first Bell's I have. I haven't had that many 'huge' IPAs but this one was a true surprise for me. Need to get some more of this.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,joe1896,4.25,"Extremely solid and drinkable IPA. The aroma suggests an almost overwhelmingly hoppy profile. However, the taste is far more balanced and smooth.

Sweet and slightly oily feel. Mild hop bite especially in the finish. (4.5) D: A superb example of style. The tremendous balance allows this to be extremely approachable.

Nice and smooth, easy to drink, no sense of it being a 7 percenter. If it wasn't so pricey (relative to Otter Creek's Overgrown) this could easily be my go-to beer (which is currently Overgrown, hence the reference). In my opinion, the best thing about this excellent beer is that I can get in half a dozen places within 5 miles of my home.

287,1093,BergBeer,4.25,"Look: A clear pale gold with a nice active white head. Good active carb keeps the head up nice and a sticky head gives this beer nice lacing  Smell: Burst of pine hops, with a nice citrus kick, and medium sticky malt makes this one great smelling beer.  Taste: Big pungent pine hops on the attack followed by a nice citrus zest and a big malt back bone really balances this beer out nicely. Blurs the line of a IPA and a hoppy pale ale (if there even is one) a it has a really nice hop presence that blends really well with the malt body. Tasty stuff.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with a that is thirst quenching and big at the same time. Surprisingly light on its feet for how much flavor it puts out. Balanced bitter and no hint of ABV. Very drinkable.  Overall: A really solid brew from bells. This beer is super drinkable and balanced making this beer an easy go to.

287,1093,scootny,4.5,"Thick head, off white from a 32 oz growler. Surprisingly clear given the huge amount of hop oil that must be in the glass. Pale cedar color, sheets of good lacing, and the beer stays covered all the way down. Slight to no carbonation visible.  Great nose. Light pale and caramel malt. Bread, citrus and grapefruit skin. Clean but lightly fruity yeast. Toasted grains and a touch of earth and big citrus hop blast.   Taste is so well balanced. Delicious broad caramel malt. Toast and bread crust. A smooth progressively building hop bomb. A mild undercurrent of pine with a heavy overlay of grapefruit. Finish is dry, short, and hop oily. A grapefruit dryness lingering.  Feel is frothy and smooth. Crisp and quenching. Weight is just right, with no watery qualities. Smooth, lightly creamy carbonation. Highly drinkable.

287,1093,BethanyB,3.91,"Look: Impeccable clarity allows one to admire the ombre effect of this beer's coloration: Light yellow deepens into a dark apricot in the glass, while a flurry of bubbles fly upwards to form a slim, white head.  Smell: The strong aroma of both floral and citrus hops pack a strong punch, while sweet apricot and peach aromas lighten the mood. Promises to be a powerful IPA.  Taste: It becomes evident that the aroma is not a complete preview of this beer--while the fruitiness is certainly there, the hop flavor is more earthy than it is citrusy, and a surprisingly large amount of malt comes through in the aftertaste. High bitterness bites hard at first, but then quickly fades away.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a good level of carbonation to complement the hops...if only they were there in the finish. Crisp and refreshing.  Overall: A deceptive beer. The aroma and mouthfeel belong to a wildly hoppy specimen with bright flavors, but the disappearing act of the bitterness hops and the overdose of malt in the finish throw things off balance. There are still many commendable elements, however, and the additional malt does add some nice complexity.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,untitledeuphoria,4.1,"Bottled 6.09.14. Drank 9.26.14. Poured into a tulip glass.  A: Pours a hazy, deep golden amber, similar to Hopslam, only a few shades darker. One finger of soapy white head from a tame pour, leaves mild lacing as it settles to a thing, pockmarked, cap. Trace amounts of visible carbonation.  S: Prominent grapefruit, with orange, lemon, and pine resin in the background. Maybe some bready malt, but it is hard to decipher. Very mild aromas for a relatively big IPA... typical Midwestern style.  T: Citrus pith, grapefruit, subdued hops (although that seems to vary tremendously with this beer), and lots of sweet malt. Once again, typical Midwestern IPA that loads up on the malt, creating a very balanced and nuanced IPA. Rewarding and flavorful, but won't wreck your palate.  M: Medium body, silky for the style. Smooth, very little carbonation bite on the tongue, goes down easy and clean, with a crisp finish. I liken the finish to biting into a ripe, tart apple. Very drinkable, hides the alcohol well, never numbs your taste buds, doesn't leave much residue  O: A balanced Midwestern IPA that is easily approachable, and highly enjoyable... a rare combination in the world of craft IPAs.

287,1093,DaveHopSculp,4.75,"This is your classic IPA, along with the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Though I love hop heavy beers, what I love about this beer is that it is very good without having to be a typical West Coast IPA. The flavors are very unique, but familiar when you open a bottle and take that first sip.  Not only that, 2 of these won't knock you out. I wouldn't say it is sessionable, but delicious. I can't contemplate how the Stone IPA can garner a higher score than this.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

For perspective, I very much enjoy Cigar City's Jai Alai and Ballast Point's Sculpin, and have recently been drinking a fair amount of Sweetwater IPA.  The nose and flavor profile are very one-dimensional and muddled, with a strange off-note that reminds me of roasted peanuts. The finish is very dry.

287,1093,MisterGone,4.25,"From a 12oz into a ""Keep Quiet and Read Joyce"" pint. Pours a nice clear apricot color with a pretty white head. The aroma was somewhat floral, light. This being an IPA, not a DIPA or IIPA, I had to remember that the aroma would be less pronounced that the hop bombs we see on the west coast. The flavor delivered the promise of the aroma with floral hops the dominant, not pine nor citrus. A light malt, what I've seen others describe as biscuit. Medium bodied and easy drinking, which could get dangerous with 7ABV.  A solid, quintessential IPA. Pairs well with fresh caught river trout roasted slow over a campfire.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Strikes the perfect balance between hops and malt, retaining characters of both in flavor (far too many IPAs are stupidly hoppy, heavy-handed). Smooth and endlessly drinkable, my ideal session brew.

Has a nice dark amber body with a slight off white 2 finger head which left nice lacing down the side of the glass.  Aroma - Lots of pine and citrus flavors coming through on the nose, some of the malt makes its presence shown.  Taste - Hops from the word go, this is a very complex brew. Lots of piney and citrus up front, and the hop bitterness combating the smooth sweet malt. Makes for a great combination of flavors.  Mouthfeel: Medium, alcohol notes are hidden well, but adds to the wonderful flavor of it. carbonation is great.  Overall - A very solid IPA at a nice ABV. What a great beer to have year around.

OCCASION: Happy 38th birthday, myself--with the fam, Jer and Matt...APPEARANCE: orange amber body; filmy and hazy; thick, white three-finger head; lacing extends upward and thickly spreads across the glass--a great start... AROMA: fruity and hoppy; apple and citrus first; some bubblegum yeasts too; lastly, some metallic suggestions... PALATE: fantastic, medium-bodied and arresting--effervescent and alive; an IPA to sip and simmer with--little suggestion of alcohol, but definitely weightier than a pint glass... TASTE: balanced caramel malts underpin a hop festival of Noble and citrus--tangy tangerine and teeth-rattling pine resin, a combo that shakes and soothes in unison--this is the IPA the beer folk warn us about...OVERALL: as IPAs go, a mecca of sorts--the hype is to be believed--and although there are many that rival Two Hearted, it is a beer I will seek out again, even if it's only found in a case at a PSU distributor, as this was; the name itself evokes that ""slow"" short story that nonetheless reveals so much of man's plight and hope, and this is a worthwhile stab at perfection....",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

This is a midwest IPA and it lies between west coast and east coast IPAs in composition as well as geographically. The biscuity malt taste come through in the nose, followed by slight grassiness and earth and finishes with the right amount of vegetal bitterness. Hides the alcohol beautifully but still hits hard. Everything a beer should be. Unpretentious yet delicious Mouthfeel- Very crisp, perfectly carbonated. The mouthfeel is simultaneously dry and resinous. Excellent.  Overall- This is probably the best IPA available in my area and it's one of my most frequent purchases.

A great beer that isn't as strong as competitors but still finishes strong.  Appearance: Most certainly strong with a look darker than most IPAs but with the sill strong finger of carbonation. Looks are still gorgeous as one could imagine from an IPA. Darker than the usual bronze.  Smell: Honestly one of the most forgettable parts of the IPA, but still excellent.  Taste: Incredibly smooth while still retaining the amazing hop flavor. Citrus, some malts, and pine are around. There are better tasting IPAs available but not many. Still a great choice.

I currently live in Louisiana and this is the first shipment we have received of Bell's, the first time I had this beer was on a trip to PA a few years ago. I was underwhelmed by Two-hearted since I think I was just trying to find the latest, hoppiest IPA I could find and this one was so well regarded. I think my tastes have matured a lot since then. I can appreciate the balance and nuance found in this single-hopped IPA. Will feature in my regular rotation of IPAs!

287,1093,allengarvin,3.85,"This pours a hazy orange-amber with a modest head. Aroma has pine-resin with a hint of citrus hop notes. Flavor offers high bitterness up front with piney, flowery hop flavor, together with some sticky sweet malt, lightly caramel, and a pleasant yeasty fruitiness. Finish is actually a little sweet while still retaining hop taste. Fairly light bodied for the strength, but also a tad watery.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Jmamay22,4.25,"Finally getting around to reviewing. The beer pours a mildly hazy copper amber with a thick head that settles to a thick collared ring. Nice lacing too.  Good scent of orange and grapefruit. Well done. A hint of caramel as well, but mostly all about the hops. Taste is similar with plenty of grapefruit. The caramel sweetness finishes with a crisp firm bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a great level of carbonation that comes off very well. Mostly dry finish, but the caramel sweetness lingers.  Great all around IPA that may not have the bells and whistles of today's over amped IBUs or latest hop cultivar, but comes together very well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

T - Citrus when it first hits the tongue transitioning to a piney flavor by the time it goes down. Slightly toasty caramel malt in the middle. Not overly bitter or hoppy.  M - Clean finish. Not chewy. Very crisp.  O - Excellent beer that is not overly hoppy but is still hoppy enough to have a nice citrus, pine, hops combination of flavors.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,silverblaze540,4.45,"A - Thick white two finger head. No lacing really. Crystal clear amber color. Light carbonation bubble. All sediment was at bottom of bottle so second pour was cloudy.  S - Sweet tropical fruits. Passion fruit, orange, grapefruit.  T - A malty front followed by a citrus orange peel taste with some sweetness. Finishes off with a hoppy bitterness.  M - Medium thickness, and some alcohol and carbonation burn.  O - Sweet smell and the slight sweet taste does not disappoint. Pretty enjoyable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Pours a nice, hazy straw color with a long-lasting one-finger head that leaves some lacy foam trailing down the glass as the beer disappears.  The aroma is mostly sweet citrus.  My tongue is hit with big citrus flavors up front - grapefruit, a little orange as well and then comes a wave of piney resins and a zingy, bubbly finish.  The mouthfeel is medium, and slightly sticky and well carbed.  Overall, just an outstanding IPA not normally available to me (darn).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JaredMarvel,4.26,"I love to try different beers, and this one looked different, the strange fish on the logo had caught my attention more than once. I finally decided to give it a shot and i was not disappointed, this cloudy american ale really lived up to its name. Two hearts, because at first you hit with a strong hoppy flavor, and just when you think you know the exact aftertaste you're going to be hit with, it throws you a great aftertaste that you did not expect. I think this beer is outstanding and can not wait to have my friends try it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JohnnyHopps,4.33,"I have had this beer many times. Went it was served at a wedding this weekend, I had a lot of it. Its about time I write a review for this well crafted IPA that is pretty accessible.  Appearance - The beer was a copper orange color with a fluffy white head.  Smell - The aroma reminded me of citrus candy, though that illusion was cancelled by malt notes.  Taste - The initial impression is grassy malt with a certain degree of citrus. The grass lead to a bitter resin, with malts holding the backbone of the beer in place. The beer is not overly bitter, and actually pleasantly diverse.  Mouthfeel - By my third or fourth one of these, I thought the beer was a little thinner than I would like. The citrus notes seem to have lost a degree of impact. Was my tongue already too traumatized?  Overall - I often forget how good this one is. Forget no more!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,neurobot01,3.98,"Bottle dated 6/16/14 into an IPA glass—thanks @PuckIt!  Look: translucent deep yellow with a huge head that decays to leave a nice film of froth.  Smell: hard to place at first, then it hits me: Starburst or Skittles.  Taste: much less sweet than the nose would have you believe. Lots of very grassy tones, along with a ton of fragrant flowers. Maybe a bit of citrus, though it really just blends in with the florals. A bit of malt evident on the back end. Honestly too floral for me.  Feel: lighter body, especially for the abv; pretty damn smooth, and not as dry as some heavily floral IPAs tend to be.  Overall: I can see why this is so well regarded. It's a good IPA; if I liked the floral IPA style more, I'd have to seek it out, but as it is, I'm fine knowing it'll likely be a while before I get to try this again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,thehyperduck,4.3,"12 oz. bottle picked up as a single at a Meijer store; bottled June 30 2014. Another one of those beers that I've been hearing great things about for years, but couldn't track down for one reason or another. Served well-chilled.  Pours a foggy golden-amber colour, topped with one finger of soapy white froth. It recedes gradually over the next period of minutes, eventually leaving behind a thin, foamy cap/collar and a loose web of lacing. Nice aroma - very big on the grapefruit, with additional hints of orange, pine and floral hops. Not much contribution from the malt bill here.  I can see why this one is so popular. There is some light pale malt sweetness, but for the most part this is just one sip of hoppy deliciousness after another. Tons of juicy grapefruit and citrus pith notes come through, with the tail end of the profile becoming increasingly piney and resinous. The bitter finish doesn't linger on the palate for long, ending dry quickly - not ideal for this style. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation that provides a crisp, smooth feel in the mouth. Not oily or slick-feeling like some IPAs, and the 7% abv is undetectable, which makes this a dangerously drinkable brew.  Final Grade: 4.3, an excellent A grade. Two Hearted Ale is a well-made IPA, though I'm still not sure if I'd consider this brew one of the best of its kind. I'm enjoying this glass and I'd certainly be willing to purchase more in the future, but this one just doesn't reel me in completely. Balanced and approachable, in the sense that it is not as absurdly bitter or heavy as this style tends to want to be. Very well-made; there is no denying that Bell's has concocted an awesome beer here that is well worth a try.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,ThePaintedGrey,4.06,"12oz. bottle poured into imperial pint glass.  A: Hazy gold with what appears to be a cloud of hop particles floating around the center of the glass. Even with only a mildly vigorous pour, the cream white towers in the glass and retains for ages before settling at a 1/2 inch, leaving an obnoxious amount of lacing down the glass. Flawless.  S: Bright and juicy grapefruit along with some pine resin and smooth caramel malts. Bell's seems to have left all trickery at the door and employed a simplistic aroma that's gorgeous and insanely fresh.  T: Very much similar to the nose, except the malts are nearly non-existent. Tons of juicy grapefruit and orange upfront with some hints of Earthy pine resin and grass. I wish there was more to explain here, but as I stated in the aroma, there's not much complexity here. Bell's went for simplicity, but the flavors are some of the freshest I've tasted.  M: The body stands at medium. A little bit of creaminess towards the middle and a reserved carbonation make this easy to drink, but doesn't impress much.  O: I know what you're thinking here... I scored this so highly in 3/4 of the categories, but the overall is under a 4... It's not that this beer isn't delicious, because it is. It's one of the freshest, no-frills IPAs that I've ever tasted, but when you consider it's popularity and sheer difficulty to acquire (it's oft-times sold out before I make it to the bottle shop), it's just not THAT good. If I stumble upon this again, I'd, without hesitation, pick up a pack of it, but it doesn't hold the ""WOW factor"" that'll put me in a craze to seek out this over some more readily-available IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DagenhamDavis,4.41,"Decided to re-review this after becoming more experienced with American IPAs AND trying it fresh. I would rate this as the finest of the style, and I am so glad I have access to this. The fruity, flavorful hop punch epitomizes IPAs, as does the dry but not too dry finish and the hazy light orange color. It's well balanced albeit on the hoppy side, and leaves nowhere for the flavor to hide. Sorry to generalize and romanticize, but it's a pretty damn fine beer.  I've now had this in bottles (lots), cans (a few) and on tap (once) and I'd really say it shines on tap and in bottles. A gem if a bit expensive for a daily drink, and one of my favorite beers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,orcrist_cleaver,4.16,"A: Superb orange gold color. Slight haziness. Excellent 2 finger white head with phenomenal retention and dreamy, dripping lacing.  S: Musty hops, strong raw grainy smell, stronger grassiness. Some light tropical notes of guava, pineapple. A very bright smelling beer, it's rather weak in presentation. You really have to dig hard for the aroma like sticking your nose deep into a bouquet of flowers. Outstanding and esoterically fitting hard-to-get as well.  M: Really nice balance with a creamy, silky, medium bodied, supported by fine carbonation that almost makes it a little too watery. Really, really, smooth; some warming alcohol sensation in the finish which remains wet throughout.  T: Light tangerine and orange citrus, citrus florals, honeycomb, bready malts, salt water taffy. Slight piney tingly feeling reserved for final few seconds. Really almost no bitterness at all. The tart/sour phenomena is derived directly from the sweet fruits hop flavors, which perhaps compliment the soft graininess too well. This beer is maybe too 'fine', too 'well-adjusted', too 'balanced' for my liking that it comes across as blase.

287,1093,BEERchitect,4.55,"Consistent, precise and most importantly- available! Bell's avoids all the trickeration or gimmicks and simply puts together a stellar hop-forward beer that gives aroma and taste every bit of attention as it does its smooth bittering.  Its confident copper pour is heady and long-lasting with its froth, delivering high hop aroma early and often. With just enough of a tepid caramel and crusted bread support to balance its hop flavor, a medley of citrus and tropical fruit waft about in a highly perfumed scent and early taste than hinges on... dare I say- bubblegum?  While the malts drop out as the beer crosses the middle, the hop character protrudes- steering from its fragrant bouquet and capturing the gleaming taste of red grapefruit, straight from the orchard. Ripe, vibrant and juicy citrus is woven together with delicate fructose candied sweetness, tangerine and tropical mango with a hint of marmalade.  Continuing its developing taste, the hops trend dry, resinous and smoothly bitter- resembling the taste of severed pine needles to and fro. With the hops outlasting the malts with ease, the finish is refreshingly dry and bitter with echoes of perfume in aftertaste.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,spoony,3.88,"From a 16 oz can into a wine glass. Indecipherable date code on bottom of can.  A-The beer is orange-tinted honey in color. My average pour produces about one and one-half fingers of off-white head. The retention is good and the beer leaves sticky curtains of lacing on the glass. Nice looking stuff.  S-The aroma is mildly citrusy with orange, some grapefruit, orange zest, and a bit of woody, oaky hop smell. The hops are balanced by a slightly sweet, bready malt that reminds me of wonderbread.  T-The taste, like the smell, is mostly hoppy with a woodsy, orange zest hop flavor competing with a semisweet malt base. I get toast and honey to go with the hops. No one flavor dominates here.  M-The feel is medium in heft with a slightly gritty, hoppy coating feeling. Carbonation is less than average in volume and strength.  O-I have tried this beer on three occasions now and finally got around to doing a proper review. It still has yet to blow me away, but I can see why people like it.

M: Moderately syrupy body for an ipa, medium to high carbonation.  O: Was expecting a lot, and like this beer. Certainly stronger on the hops than I’d expected from the review I saw. I see the balance here, and representation of east coast style of ipa it is. To me it’s a little over hopped, but balanced and unique for that.

That being said, Bell's Two Hearted Ale is one I'll never not have in my beer fridge (not for a lack of trying to drink them all). For me, its the perfect IPA, highly floral with light fruity notes and a strong hoppy attitude. The bitter bite isn't beastly like you may see with so many other IPAs (particularly those of lower quality) but rather justly emboldened. This is, to me, the pinnacle of craft IPAs with the correct addition of fruity and floral flavors (and smells), right between a boring hoppy beer or some bastardized fruit cocktail.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

As the beer warmed up in the glass, aromas of grapefruit peel and lemon oil emerged.  T: Tasty, bitter, and citrusy. Bitter citrus pith dominates upfront, then sweetness from the malt kicks in, and there's more bitter citrus fruit on the finish. Incredibly bitter and citrusy, yet neither overwhelming nor too bitter.  M: Delightful. It's very creamy with a dry, bitter finish, and it feels refreshing and substantial simultaneously.

Crisp and clean flavors with a nice malt sweetness in the background. The A bit of tartness and mild sweet lemon in the finish and the bitterness doesn't linger on the palate in a harsh way but leaves a pleasant aftertaste.  M: Medium body with a clean and slightly acidic finish. Moderate carbonation, correct for the style. Slight tingle on the tongue.  O: This is one of my favorite IPA's. It doesn't overwhelm the palate with a dank bitterness but masterfully controls the bitterness while letting other flavors in the beer 'take a bow'. It's the closest thing I've found that I could consider a session IPA. I could drink a lot of this.

Aroma is a perfect balance of malts and hops. Kind of musty, like a muskmelon rind.  There is no stone left unturned here for me. I get some dank, musty/funky flavor right away in melon and grapefruit, then some orange and floral notes follow. A slightly sweet, bready malt in the middle, then back to some orange citrus before it finishes bitter green.  Fluffly, chewy body, but not heavy. Tons of resin.

287,1093,woodychandler,5,"Ha! I got it wrong, initially. Those 5L mini-kegs actually qualify as CANs as long as they are unpressurized. It's okay, since I have had Two Hearted Ale in a number of forms, including bottle and cask, also, but now it is truly in a 16-oz. CAN. I scored it at Pinocchio's (@pinbeer) and I am excited to give it a whirl. The graphics are phenomenal and the name is an allusion to a Hemingway story, doubling my interest.  From the CAN: ""An Ameri[CAN] India Pale Ale with intense hop aroma and malt balance. Well suited for adventurous trips anywhere.""; ""Unfilterered""; ""Best Kept Refrigerated""; ""Unpasteurized"".  Man, was the Crack! loud! I immediately got an inverted Glug started, allowing the fish plenty of slack on the line to run. The pseudo-cascade quickly settled into two fingers of dense, tawny head with excellent retention in the face of tonight's humidity. Color was a hazy golden-yellow (SRM = &gt; 5, &lt; 7) and my old pals Croesus, Mammon and Midas suddenly appeared, clamoring for a taste. Forget it! This is all for me. The nose was big with hops, giving off scents of pine, grapefruit, pineapple and as a previous reviewer mentioned, lilac or lavender in a lightly perfume-y way. As I was typing, the head began to drop, leaving sticky lacing in its wake. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops were immediate and unrelenting on the tongue, but underlain with a sweet maltiness so as not to be overwhelming. Jesus, but this was tasty! The fact that it is now available in a more portable form of CAN really excites me. The finish was semi-dry, with the malt really achieving a good balance with the hops so that they do not become overwhelming. This deserves a place in anyone's cooler, no matter what their destination.  My original, on-tap, review dtd 02 June 2008 with all 5s follows:  A mini-keg counts as ""on-tap"", does it not? If not, this will either get removed or moved to a more appropriate type.  The pour produced a big, rocky, bone-white head with excellent retention. The nose had a great hoppy presence. The color was a slightly hazy golden-yellow. The mouthfeel was medium with a definite hop bite on the palate. The finish lingered with hops. There was great lacing produced throughout.

287,1093,tillmac62,4.22,"BOD 3/10/14. Slightly hazy light amber pour with a massive head. Excellent lacing and retention. Outstanding nose of citrus and dank hops - mostly tropical with grapefruit in the background. Light medium body which is modestly smooth in texture coupled with an above average carbonation level. The flavor profile is well balanced, but skewed towards citric bitterness, and complex. It begins with hop flavors, grapefruit over tropical, flows into a burst of dank hop flavor that yields itself to grapefruit rind bitterness and ends with a light biscuit sweetness. The finish has a bit of effervescence, is somewhat crisp yet also smooth. A moderate grapefruit rind bitterness lingers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,CTHomer,4.29,"A: cloudy; honey colored; 1 finger pillowy white head; nice retention; really nice lacing;  S: floral, maybe lilac? As it warmed, some pineyness and the malt began to come through;  T: hop forward, but the malt is there as well; mid-palate is grapefruit and some pine; moderately bitter finish with grapefruit;  M: refreshing; medium bodied; ample carbonation; dry finish;  O: really good; an outstanding IPA;",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MasterfulIdiot,4.31,"This was THE beer that really got me into beer. For a long time, I drank almost nothing but Two-Hearted Ale until I started trying other beers and styles. I thought the new cans would be a good occasion to revisit it and write a review.  Poured from a can into an IPA glass. The pour produces a wonderfully huge off-white head that takes several minutes to fade enough so that you can actually take a drink. When it does fade, it leaves sheets of lace on the way down. The liquid itself is a clear golden amber - a little bit on the dark side for an IPA. Clouds of bubbles can be seen rising up through the liquid, which I love. A perfect, classic appearance.  Classic aroma as well - grapefruit, flowers, maybe a little bit of soap, and just a hint of bready malt underneath.  Flavor follows the nose, but improves it. Up front is the grapefruit, and other citrus - maybe some orange and pineapple. The floral notes come out on the swallow, and then the finish is where the sugar-cookie-ish malt really makes itself known, and mingles with some lingering citrus sweetness, and maybe a hint of resin. There's plenty of bitterness on the aftertaste - nothing extreme, but nothing lightweight either. Plenty of hop bite, but perfectly balanced. Incredibly delicious.  Mouthfeel is relatively thin, with plenty of carbonation. About what I'd expect for the style.  Overall, a benchmark IPA. Nowadays there are IPAs that I prefer much more, but it's remarkable how much this one holds up year after year. Incredibly drinkable, but hoppy enough to get you off.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,sjzeeb,4.55,"Very impressed- more earth-tone bitter, should be marketed as a session beer: no real bitterness, and falls closely in a Pale Ale category with an IPA front! I would really like to find this on tap to better evaluate. This beer is more malty/sweet than citrus or hoppy, yet still floral. Drink more!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Lemke10,4.52,"On-tap at Bernie's in Waukesha, WI. This pours a hazy amber color with a foamy off-white head. The aroma is mild with hops. The taste is smooth and easy drinking.

287,1093,EveningCordial,4.66,"On tap, poured into pint glass.  A- Light orange with yellow hue. Not as dark as many IPAs. Nice one finger head, medium amount of lacing.  S- Wonderful. Many times I can tell if I'll really like an IPA by its smell and this one stood by that test. Lots of citrus and fruits on the hoppy nose this puts out. Grapefruit, mango, and orange up front with some floral and a hint of pine in the distance, just as one might expect from the strictly Centennial hops used in this one. Not much malt presence, but its there.  T- Awesome taste and smooth finish. Very juicy from the selection and amounts of hops used. Lots of citrus and pure juiciness in this fine ale. Just enough pine and bitterness in the finish to not let you get too carried away with how refreshing this tastes.  M- Light to medium bodied. Very crisp and fair amount of carbonation.  O- One of my favorite single hopped ales. Huge drinkability and very refreshing. 7% ABV is well hidden. Not much to say other than I will always get this when available in my area and its a must-try for any IPA drinker.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,EvoRich,4.16,"Look: Pours with some head. A very light orange/yellow color. Hazy, not clear. Some lacing present.  Smell: Hops, a bit or orange peel, lemon. Very citrusy.  Taste: Hops, straightaway, with a touch of lemon in the middle and finishes off with a touch more hop flavor. Pretty mild hop flavor, not too strong. Well balanced with the citrus flavors.  Feel: Very light feeling. High carbonation.  Overall: Pretty good IPA. I've met many IPA's I've disliked greatly. This isn't one of them. This has a very mild hop flavor and is pretty good overall.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S- Lots of orange, floral, and some slight tropical notes, light pine, very nice and complex for being a single hopped beer.  T- Similar to aroma, the orange is still the main thing but the floral aspect comes through more and a nice medium bitterness seems around 70 IBUS. Get some pine and a bit of tropical as well. Finish is not too dry and not too sweet.  M- Crisp and easy drinking for a really hoppy beer.  O- I waited til this came out in the cans to give it a full review. This is one of the best single IPAs and single hopped beers out there. Balanced in every way and a benchmark IPA.

287,1093,JednoPivoProsim,4.31,"Poured from a 12 FL OZ bottle into a pint glass. PKGD 04/29/14 - less than one month old!  Appearance: Pours a beautiful thick orange body with a nice thick two finger soft white head.  Smell: Very pungent but almost one dimensional. Citrus backed by a slight malt aroma.  Taste: Rich, full flavored, bitter. Spicy Centennial hops balanced by a nice fruitiness. I can taste why this is so popular.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied but smooth and not heavy at all. This is a refreshing beer that leaves a clean palate and begs for the next sip. Bitter aftertaste is low.  Overall: A delicious IPA. Very full of flavor but light and refreshing. Much less malty than Sierra Nevada Celebration, which is the IPA I think of when I think Centennial hops. Overall, I like the more tropical fruit flavored IPAs (using Citra, Nelson Sauvin, Galaxy, now even Simcoe, etc), but this is very good nonetheless. If any negative, perhaps this is too one dimensional, but I believe this is a single hop IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S-Huge citrus and pine. It has a grapefruit and almost lemon-like quality to it that is rather unique. Just a little bit of maltiness. Very floral as well. Pretty incredibly overall.  T-Not quite as citrus-forward as the head, but it is still present with a great deal more pine and earthy bitterness. Quite bitter but not a hop bomb by any means. A surprising spicy character hits you as it goes down and it is really welcome and intriguing. There is even still some malt fighting its way through the considerable complexity of the hops. Really great.  M-A fair amount of carbonation that lends a refreshing quality to this beer. Relatively thin and easy to drink. As it should be.  O-An absolutely fantastic beer. Seriously hop-forward without being a hop bomb and still leaves some room for the malt to come through. Very aromatic, with hops ranging from floral and citrus-like to earthy and pine.

287,1093,digitalflood,4.54,"Bells Two Hearted Ale (2014) - 7% ABV. When I stopped in at Casey's Beer & Soda (Pine Bush NY) the staff informed me about this bargain ($8 for a four pack) and how I possibly was missing the best beer out there if you like hops. That is a big rep to live up to... but Bells pulls it off. The moment you pop the top of the can you smell the piney goodness-- a hint of lilac and some citrus. Pours a solid amber with very active carbonation. Excellent head and lacing retention. The nose is pine nuts and coriander. A quick bite of malty barley and the sting of pine mark the mid-palate transition. Lingering malt and spice. Finishes crisp, dry, and some lemon bite. A bit of skunk lager notes but the copper ale note persists in the aftertaste. Full bodied with good crisp mouthfeel. The alcohol is subdued. This is very sessionable from a taste standpoint. Very mellow IPA flavor. Tastes like a ""baby war elephant"" or session IPA but that 7% is there-- proceed with care and respect the beer. Really good. Excellent for that matter.

287,1093,Henrich,3.87,"Appearance: Pours a light golden color. There appears to be some slight haze (like dust), which isn't uncommon in highly hopped beers. Stark white foam settles from 2 fingers to 1/2 cm around the rim. Smell: Dank with sweet citrusy notes, maybe grapefruit. The smell doesn't really blow you away, but is very pleasant. Taste: The bitterness grabs your palate right away. There is some hint of citrus, but the hops dominate. Mouth-Feel: Thick enough to keep the hops on your tongue, yet carbonated enough to spread the flavors. Great mouthfeel. Overall: Very enjoyable. This beer is a great example of an IPA. I don't really have much to say against it other than I wish it were a bit more complex (but that's if I'm looking for something to complain about).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,BeerDocT,3.98,"Appearance 4.0: Beautiful, deep golden color. Gorgeous, 1"" head faded to a respectable 1/4"" that stuck around the entire session. Excellent lacing.  Smell 4.0: Beautiful bouquet of hoppy goodness: grapefruit rind, candied orange rind, pine...I also detect the spiciness of...is that Marris Otter malt?  Taste 4.0: Front is slightly spicy and smooth. Middle is where a lovely blend of hops jumps up and hits you in the center of the palate: grapefruit, pine, piquant alkaline bitterness...so refreshing. Finish is smooth and refreshing with a nice balance of malt and dryness. Aftertaste is high in the palate and features an invigorating alkaline hoppiness.  Mouthfeel 3.75: Pleasant, smooth and a complement to the taste of the beer.  Overall 4.0: Excellent beer and an outstanding IPA. Expertly blended hops and malts make this a great session beer...just don't let that big ABV sneak up on you. This is a BIG beer, but the balance and structure make it a great beer just to have with a burger or pizza...anything really. I like to have my beer with a side of N2 O2...that's right just air. Anyway, this brew is great and definitely worth a purchase, but watch it...some stores charge up to $11+ for a six pack.

In a class interview at Michigan State University, Larry Bell told us that Two Hearted has become the new Bell's favorite.  The beer pours a a clear gold, hazy, has a 1 finger index of head. The body is thick, heavy, and powerful. It smells of honey, floral hops, citrus, and pine, a very complex beer. Has a malty finish. Tastes like it smells, with the honey and citrus hops leading the charge finishing dry and crisp.  Drinkability: Great IPA, but not one I could drink to many of before being carried home, as it is high in alcohol.

First thing I tasted was malt and honey, actually. Then grapefruit followed by lemon. Actually, it's more like lemon thyme (not lemon and thyme -Lemon thyme). The herbal and citrus notes are really well integrated together. There's also a semi-artificial quality to the lemon --like Fruit Loops almost.  M - light to medium body. Malt backbone.

287,1093,moysauce,4.18,"On tap in a pitcher poured into a regular glass of non-specified type. Cheap college bar, so pretty general glassware.  A: Deep copper in hue with a slightly hazy 1.5 finger head. The head disappeared rather quickly. I drank this at a college bar so the glass wasn't as clean as it could have been, so the lacing wasn't the greatest, though it lingered for a tiny bit. I've had better pours, but I can't complain. Even though I was a little disappointed with the lacing, this brew is everything you expect out of an IPA in appearance.  S: Floral notes hit you right away. Present, but not overpowering. Definitely pleasant.  M: This beer leaves a very clean mouthfeel as nothing really lingers much at first. You can feel the carbonation on your tongue leaving a crisp feel, but the further into the beer the more it coats the back of your tongue.  T: This beer is immediately bitter. You can taste some citrus notes, though I can't place my finger on what type of citrus it is. I'd venture to say grapefruit, but I'm not certain. For the most part it has a nice bitter hop profile with a very subtle, subdued malty underbelly that chimes in every now and then just to let you know it's present.  Overall: This is my favorite go-to brew at the moment. Lately when trying IPAs I've been comparing them to this one just because I find it to be a very true, honest representation of what I think an IPA should be. Could easily be sessionable, but it is rich enough to leave you feeling satisfied after just one. Great to share with your friends. I could see this beer being a nice segue beer for a friend exploring the craft brew scene. It may be a bit hoppy for them, but if you want to introduce someone to what an IPA should be, I view this one as a solid standard in any hop heads repertoire.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Aroma is soft citrus/floral notes, but also somehow briny and evocative to me of the seashore or (as more appropriate for Michigan) a day out on the lakes. The mouthfeel is rather full-bodied for an IPA. Carbonation is not noticeable. Very little bitterness/dryness--just a faint note from the hops. What is amazing here is the beautiful balance between the malts and hops, and the easy drinkability that somehow highly rewards every sip. And again, I find this beer highly evocative--really reminds me of laid-back days in the great, wild outdoors.

287,1093,HopHog87,3.4,"Disclaimer: I'll probably get stoned for writing this review as it wasn't 100% favorable, but I'm just reporting what I drank. I understand that an IPA should be consumed fresh and that the bottle I had was old. Almost a year old. But I'll update the review once I get a fresh bottle/draft sometime.  Serving- Bottle into pint glass.  Appearance- Hazy copper top that swirled and tornadoed down into the bottom of the glass where it blended lazily with a light gold. Visible floating hop residue floating within. Took about 5 minutes to equalize and stabilize into one color. The separation had me concerned from the beginning as to the freshness of the beer. The beer is well carbonated. There is white lace all over the glass.  Nose- Subdued, earthy hops and malt. Nothing jumped out here or was very exciting. Again, this made me wonder how fresh it was and, to my dismay, I saw I had a bottle that was 9 months old! There were possibly notes of cider which, especially as a home brewer, got me concerned. The finish on the aroma was of warm apples.  Taste- Yeah, very earthy, herbal bitterness with malt. Some toasty bread in there and was pretty yeasty. At this point I'm bummed I got an old one. Everyone swears by this.  Overall- I think I did myself a great injustice by not checking the date on the bottle in the store. Normally with all the bombers I buy this is something I check. However, this one I purchased as a single 12 oz and it, obviously, had been sitting on the shelf a while. I believe this is a bottle conditioned beer as it had the hop residue and hazy appearance. I normally love this in a beer but this is an old IPA. No glory here. Overall it wasn't a bad beer, but it wasn't living up to its potential and certainly drank/smelled more like a pale ale than an IPA. I was disappointed. If this is what it really tastes like than I would not willingly seek this out again. If I get a fresh one sometime I'll be sure to update my review to reflect my findings.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Hops, not as much as in Hopslam(my only other experience with Bell's)which was to be expected, hit the nose and the tongue in perfect balance. An incredibly drinkable and savorable IPA.

287,1093,Mikus,3.81,"Poured 12 ounces into my tulip glass, quite fresh as it was bottled on 6/10/14. 1/2 finger of creamy white head disappeared quickly. However, the golden amber hue of this beer was quite impressive. Aroma of pine and light lemon zest. Hit me with a strong piney/grassy opening note. Very clean and refreshing with a pronounced bitter finish. The light carbonation lent to a bit of a watery mouthfeel, though pretty par for the IPA course. Overall, the only thing I felt that was lacking in this well-balanced, refreshing brew was a bit more of the citrus hop flavor. This would have bumped it up even higher that my great rating. Interested to try this on tap, extremely fresh one day. Excellent IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,xungmound98,4.18,"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Hazy orange color with 1/2” of head that recedes to a soapy film on top, with some lacing on sides. Nose is orange juice, grapefruit, slight bitterness with some pine notes- mostly citrus. Little to no alcohol detected. Taste is citrus (on the mellow side, not extremely bitter) with some sugary malt backing and floral notes. Hops gradually coat the tongue, but not with as bitter a finish as other American IPAs. Medium carbonation, somewhat creamy texture. Medium-bodied with a nice balance. Overall this is a tasty IPA with understandably wide appeal.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Scent: slight floral notes, fresh grains  Taste: Floral hops, balanced nicely with malt attributes  Mouthfeel: moderate carbonation, medium bodied, not super sticky like some bigger ipas can be.  overall: every time i drink this beer I am reminded why this is one of the best examples of an IPA. Really well balanced, drinkable, and something new to enjoy each time you drink it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

T: Quite floral in the beginning and then the bitter and slightly piney hops come in. Light malts ends it with a touch of booze.  M: A little less heavy than a normal IPA - medium with a bit of carbonation.  O: Very good, and in all honesty, its one of my favorites of the style.

287,1093,W9820,4.12,"Bells Two Hearted is a beautiful bright gold. It has a sweet citrus smell I find somewhat understated, almost too subtle. The taste starts off meaty but gives way to the bitterness of the hops. It's light and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation.  I tried this beer years ago and, at the time, found it completely overpowering. As the years have passed and I've been able to sample more and more, I've come full circle.

Probably the best looking IPA iv seen  Smell: Mellow but very clean. Floral notes such as earthy hops and tropical fruits. Almost smells like a juice to me. I pick up toasted malts in the back end as well.  Taste: Matches the nose with extremely clean flavors. Candied tropical fruits and sweet toasted malts that come through as well. The flavors linger on the palate, are superbly balanced, and the burps taste phenomenonal as well!  Mouthfeel: Medium body; Moderate bitterness yet very smooth. crisp and refreshing, especially for 7% abv.  Overall: This is one of my go to IPA's. It's very clean, refreshing, and drinkable yet all the flavors and aromas are there. I put this right next to my favorites in the style, and right under my current favorite (Head Hunter). Most likely because I can regularly find both of these within a couple weeks of bottling, but fresh is key! Highly recommended!  EDIT: $7.99 16 oz can four packs.

Aroma I'd complex and enticing, a blend of sweetness, maltiness, fruitiness, and hoppiness, none of them overwhelming yet somehow each being strong and distinct. Taste does not disappoint, it is amazingly smooth throughout, making it hard to not down a whole glass quickly. Thick feel on the pallet. Hint of citrus tickles the tongue while the malt opens and promotes Itself. Good down smooth, leaving a mild hint of hops. Always makes you want more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,alaimoa,3.76,"Been waiting to try for a while and overall not disappointed but doesn't compare on same level as some of my other favorites. Golden honey pour with nice white sticky head.

Easily will drink again",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Seanem44,4.24,"A very good IPA. I find the draft version to be not quite as strong as the bottle version and the hops seem watered down.. That has been my luck with IPAs on draft, and I guess there are several things that can lead to this inconsistency. The hops weren't quite as bold. The bottled version however is quite delightful.  Honestly, though not as good as Hopslam, it is very comparable and will satisfy you. On top of the that, it's half the price and easy to find. For the price alone, I feel it is a much better value than Hopslam, as Hosplam is only marginally better than two-hearted. Two Hearted is a very enjoyable IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,glass_house,4.11,"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter  Cloudy honey-gold with one finger of creamy white head that recedes to a thin collar with patchy lacing. Smell is light lemony citrus with soft pine and floral notes. Pleasant but tame compared to some.  Initial taste is slightly sweet and tropical--faint mango and pineapple. Finishes with a relatively mild grapefruit-pine bitterness. Light biscuity malt present throughout. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, finishes crisp and clean. The medium, slightly prickly carbonation gives it a refreshing and drinkable character.  Overall I consider it solidly above average, bordering on great. Nothing extraordinary, but a perfect example of the beauty of simplicity and consistency.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Light amber... a little cloudy. the best head i've seen in a while. creamy white that last for a while.  not a whole lot on the nose. a little pinesol... but not in a bad way.  the lemon hits me on the first sip. moving more into the rind and pine on the second... i guess that's the pinesol scent i got. there's a hint of smoke or toast. it moves through the citrus range and lands a bit more on a bitter orange as you get a bit more into it. lemony orange - maybe cumquat... with a bit of and iron aftertaste. a little dusty. they yeast starts tasting a little ""rapid rise"" as it goes on. not at all in a bad way. but a bit in a buddy gave me his homemade apple cider - made with rapid rise - kind of way.  i like it. i will buy it again. it reminds me of the regular lagunitas IPA - but a little milder - again, in a good way. but i won't show it off to someone i'm trying to impress as super dooper.  reading the bottle after my review i agree that this is well suited to an adventure to the UP. it might even be my first choice if making that trek. the iron aftertaste seems to taste like the stream water from that area. not at all a bad thing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Soft pine and smells good enough to drink.  A very juicy grapefruit with subtle bitterness. Lighter sweetness.  Light bodied quenchable craft. Well balanced malt and hop.

M: Carbonated, compliments the style nicely.  O: A great IPA, I'm glad I got the chance to try this.

287,1093,ZagZagg,4.36,"Growler into Tulip  A: One finger white head that’s supported by some mild to weak carbonation. Clear, filtered brew with a dark straw-golden hue, looks pretty light - has some light retention.  S: Mellow fruity aromas, tropical esters, with notes of earth. Mango, with remote spices, and subdued florals, tails of dry crisp pine. Bit of swirling provokes more tropical esters – papaya and smooth pineapple.  T: Fruity and mellow up front with malt presence that’s crisp and constructive. Mid mouth picks up the nose with earthy, fresh grass, mango, and other tropical esters carrying suppressed flowery flavor. The finish revitalizes the mild straw malt with the flavor of fresh pine needles and bitter natural sap. The pine and malt interactions yield a dry character that helps to transition the fruit facets into the after taste.  M: Well-bodied, light carbonation, refreshing, doesn’t leave too much after taste, and doesn’t over or under dominate the palate at any point.  O: This is a solid AIPA, definitely a contender for one of my favorites. Eloquently combines all elements that compose your ideal AIPA. Juicy style that is both refreshing and enjoyable to sip.

There's something about IPAs in general and this one in particular, that reminds me of a bug repellent we used as kids at the beach in Maine (and I mean that in the best possible way).

Crisp and clean, with a light apricot finish that lingers. Slight warming ushers in the grapefruit flavors.  The medium body and dry finish accentuates a rough texture and light prickly carbonation.

Head maintained quite well and laced the glass with sheets and islands.  Nose isn't very strong, but I get a balanced spiced bread malt note with a bit of citrus bitterness.  Taste starts off a little sweeter than expected, but also with a little bite to it. An orange citrus bitterness balances it out before a more classic grapefruit citrus takes over in the end. A nice full range from malty to bitter, as the end does get decently bitter for an overall seemingly balanced IPA. There is a bit of spice that runs throughout, as well, that seems more from the ingredients than the carbonation (which is soft on this pour).  Definitely a solid, classic, little less balanced than it seems IPA. Seems a little more east coast than west, though the hop profile seems to be more of the latter.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Flopjack,4.23,"Bottle into tulip  Appearance - Pale orange and yellow haze, about 1 finger white head  Smell - Pine, resin, grapefruit, malts, slight alcohol.  Taste - Fresh juicy tart citrus, grapefruit, orange, pineapple, tangerine right at first. The middle you get pine, sticky resin, still some bitterness that is beginning to dry out then towards the end as the taste settles you get a bready roastiness that balances out the floral citrus and pine.  Mouthfeel - Medium body, medium carbonation, crisp, clean, refreshing.  Overall - Good beer. Never dissipointed other two hearted its is always so fresh. Gives you a bit of everything an IPA should and balances all the flavors well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,humuloner22,4.6,"I love this beer, I have loved this beer from the first time I tried it although it put a damper on my LSAT scores the next morning. Which therein lies the problem. Its so tasty you want to keep drinking them, and they are 7.00% which means if you drink a six pack you have really drank way more than a six pack. This was my first real introduction to Bell's and it remains a mainstay in my fridge, and I just so happened to catch this one on sale for the bargain price of $8.99 a sixer. I figured after all these years I would review this pleasuredome of a beer. I mean Coleridge would have surely written about this one had he lived long enough to try it. What doesn't it have. Its a beautiful ale.  The color: A golden ruby color.  The smell: a gorgeous piney sweet nectar, not as much floral and tropical as mountainous and northern.  The taste: Now this is where it gets real. It has a balance like no other, and for the price its a steal. Its lovely, sweet, yet piney and bitter in the perfect kind of way. Its the foundation on which the Hopslam is built upon. Not as strong, but just a great brew all the way around.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,HoppySOB,4.77,"The brew that always goes down smooth, converted my girl to an IPA fan, and never leaves me disappointed. Citrusy, perfectly carbonated, prominent but friendly bitterness derived from the centennial hops, pleasant aroma. It is really tough to come up with any negatives for this one, and tough to stop drinking it as well! Although I am a huge fan of high IBU IPAs and IIPAs now, this is the one that seeded my passion for hoppy brews to begin with. Easily one of my favorites.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JerUrbans,4.31,"Pours a dirty yellow/orange color with a 1"" head with big foamy bubbles and nice lacing. Smell of coriander and hops. Taste is well balanced with flavors of hops, malts, and spice. Mouthfeel is great, it's smooth and not a huge bitter aftertaste it's just the right amount.  Overall, I don't know why I haven't drank this before. For some reason just been avoiding this one...shame on me. This beer is easy to drink and tastes fantastic.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,LooseGasCap,4.89,"Bold hop notes meet the nose. Smooth drinking and light lacing on the glass. Clean, crisp grapefruit flavors with a slight bitterness in the finish.

287,1093,donbet69,4.11,"I was primarily a lager drinker until recently because I was introduced to some bad IPA's in the past and had predetermined they would all be bitter. Having said that I especially liked this beer for it's underwhelming Hops to malt ratio.  Great color. Very nice IPA smell, not overly citrus.  Taste is just what I want in a beer. Easy to drink, no lingering bitterness.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jbaker67,4.18,"Clear golden under a thin white cap of head. Nose is wonderful with earthy grassy hops, and a bit of floral resin, atop a nice caramel sweetness. Smooth and full balanced flavor, with gentle caramel biscuity sweetness, light bitterness, a touch of grass, a little floral resin, and a kiss of grapefruit rind. A wonderfully balanced and tasty brew that’s tantalizingly easy to drink down.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,WheelsPSU,3.93,"I gave this ""classic"" a shot at Rye House in Chelsea. Must be fresh since Bell's distributed to New York for the very first time this week. It kind of reminded me of an everyday IPA that is not too over the top with bitterness of the hop.  Poured a hazy goldish orange color with a small head. Decent not great lacing.  The smell was rather subdued. A light floral note with some citrus.  Citrus (orange) and pine but not too much of either (which is a good thing these days when IPA's seem to have hops for hops sake). The malt has a touch of sweetness. The beer had a watery taste to it though.  Medium bodies and a touch dry. The alcohol is well hidden.  Nothing from this beer stood out but it was still rather good. I guess the reputation from this beer left me expecting more. Although I do appreciate the single centennial hop not crushing my palate.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Loco_Joe,4.32,"12oz bottle &lt;packaged 1/23/14&gt; poured in to a glass beer mug.  This beer was a hazy copper color with a thin head of white foam that remained as a layer leaving more lace than a Victoria's Secret fashion show. Aroma and Taste had lots of floral and piney hops with a mid swallow citrus bite leading to a dray & bitter finish. Goes down smooth and easy for the barely noticable abv. Pretty damn close to perfect.

In terms of craftsmanship, it draws comparisons to the best of the rest.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Pahn,3.93,"Well, what do you know. It happens to be my 500th review on BA, and Larry Bell finally broke his promise to never distribute to us up here in the northeast. I've never had this purported American classic before, and it must be fresh (since Bell's appeared here in NYC in the last week or so--actually, I see it's bottled 1/23/14, drinking on 2/12/14). Poured into a red wine glass.  Appearance: Free pour yields a frothy, longlasting one inch head that leaves a solid wall of lacing. Pours a clear orange/gold.  Smell: Floral and citrusy, some hard water aroma as well. Restrained but nice. Building orange note.  Taste: Up front, nice and piny like what used to pass for a big IPA (I like). Smoothly transitions into crystal malt sweetness, lightly sugared tropical and citrus fruit flavor, with a decently crisp and dry finish. Bit of a mineral-y undercurrent to everything, also slightly watery, both elements actually serving the beer well. As in the nose, once the orange note takes root, it builds and becomes a prominent (if not the major) flavor.  Pretty straighforward, with outstanding balance and ample complexity. I'm not really blown away by any one element, but everything works great together. Deservedly considered a classic in my opinion. Also, notably well hidden alcohol. There's a bit of heat at the end, but I would believe almost 4% or at most 5%; would never guess 7%.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Smooth crystal malt fullness in the middle with a nice dry finish. A little watery as mentioned above, but it's actually a good thing.  Overall: Great beer. Not necessarily the beer I want to slam, but very very well done.  Sadly, I'm more ""understanding why people love it"" than I am ""loving it."" I think it's mainly the crystal malt with the Centennial single hop... I need some real bitter or dank punch to forgive this much noticeable crystal malt in an IPA (and it probably has to have even more alcohol bite; I want my low ABV pale ales bone dry with no crystal). The website mentions Bell's house yeast being a major contributor, and I must say that it's very nice (fruity esters and good attenuation).  All told it's a very good beer, worthy of its reputation.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Srkolodn,4.21,"This IPA I would like to place in a seperate category that will go under ""Everyday IPA's."" Its not so in your face in any aspect and therefore, I could literally drink it every day, As opposed to hopslam where I would only like to drink 1 or 2 because of the intensity. This IPA is piney and has light citrus notes, it is so easily drinkable because of the great balance. It pours an outstanding color that I would like more IPA's to look like. Great brew.  Cheers!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,youknowmyname,4.39,"One of my favorite go to beers when I can't find something new I want to try. Bell's Two Hearted ale is a wonderful, non-imperial IPA. The reason I say that is because it seems everyone wants to go imperial these days, and most of the time, I'm drinking a few beers not just one. Nothing wrong with imperials, but they should be that special occasion beer.  Great citrus and pine flavors with a big hop punch. Fairly strong but no phenol kick. A few of these will definitely have you feeling good. Easy go to beer if you like your beers hoppy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Patches0Who,4.82,"Simply one of my favorite IPA's fantastic, piney and light citrus notes excellent balance between hop bitterness and smooth crisp and clean malt finish!

Pours medium but bright gold, with clarity and 1-finger-plus near-white head, with good retention, leaving some thick splotchy lace. Huge aroma of sweet citrus off the pour, and pine and some hop spice joining as warms. Begins with moderate carbonation, then creamy semi-sweet malt, and flavors of honey and grapefruit, soon nicely balanced with piney hop bite, leading to polished creamy, bitter finish.  A classic American IPA: fruity, malty, and beyond crisp. May we never lose such beers to trends and fads.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Twisted_Halo,5,"Simply one of the best IPA's out there today. Perfectly hopped for those of us that don't particularly enjoy the IPA's on the market that are part of what I like to call the ""hops for hops sake"" fad in today's craft beer world. Bell's Two Hearted doesn't overpower your taste buds with bitterness, but that doesn't mean it is lacking in flavor. Just outstanding!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Bero,4.79,Fantastic IPA. One of the best there is. Just a wonderful wonderful beer. Jeepers is sure is great.

Is this review long enough yet?,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DannyS,4.01,"Poured from a bottle into a magic hat keg glass.  A - Hazy but bright orange amber. Not surprising. Little head but it sticks around forever and leaves a lot of lacing.  S - It's actually pretty muted on the nose. Predominantly fruity/floral hops on the nose but it's not very strong.  T - VERY low bitterness for an IPA. Surprised at how mild the bitterness is, actually. The citric and piney hops are there but not overwhelmingly so, countered deftly by the roasty malt. That is one hell of a sessionable IPA.  M - Light on the carbonation and not heavy at all on the tongue. This beer goes down so easy I'm tempted to just crack open another and keep drinking.  Overall - 7% ABV? Sure don't taste like it! This one is subtle, fresh, strikes a killer balance of hops and malt, and finishes really clean. Unlike most IPA's that send you wave upon crashing wave of hop flavor and bitterness, this one drinks so easy that its 7% ABV will sneak up on you if you're not careful. A great choice both as an introductory IPA and an everyday brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,foglemgs,4.63,"A: Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a nice, muddy yellow color with a cream-colored head that dissipates quickly.  S: I get a lot of roasted malts in the nose, with a piney twinge. There are also some citrus notes, but I can't place the scent. Overall, it's quite a pleasant smell.  T: The flavor of malt hit me right up front. A nice, dry finish polishes this beer off.  M: Very smooth in the mouth. The carbonation bubbles nicely on the tongue and the rich flavor of malt makes you crave the next sip. This is one I could have consistently throughout the evening.  O: Another superlative beer from Bell's in Kalamazoo, MI. This, along with their Kalamazoo Stout, guarantees that they will have at least one loyal customer for many years to come.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Jmayhaus,4.54,"Nice hop finish with a hint of citrus, very refreshing with lunch. I poured them into a ale glass and it has a thick head, citrus smell.

287,1093,dbl_delta,4.17,"Straight from the can at a party, so I didn't really get a visual. Initial impression is a just about perfect balance between resinous hops and malt. This IPA exercises considerable restraint in the application of hops, and it results in a more drinkable, ENJOYABLE beverage. Don't get me wrong - I enjoy some of the hop bombs that are currently available. But this is a more - uh, mature? - offering that doesn't fry your taste buds. Medium mouthfeel (just about right for an APA); medium carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. Very smooth. Nice citrus finish. Very drinkable. Very good.  Revisited 11/4/16 from growler. Turns out it's a gorgeous clear golden-amber with a persistent off-white head and plenty of lacing. I'd repeat everything I said earlier but that would be repetitive. A very good, very drinkable APA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Jay_Ulreich,4.42,"I have had this beer on tap, but right now its out of a bottle. And just as good I might add. Open the bottle and its like you stepped into a hop field. Pours nice with a decent sticky head. Nice lacing throughout the drink. Floral, citricy, piney- its got it all, but I beleive its centennial? Correct me if Im wrong. Anyway, it tastes soooo fresh, freshest beer I have had in a long time, Im loving it. I dont know about drinking this all day long as I already have a buzz after 2. This is just a fantastic hop lovers dream. I love this beer, Bells is by far one of my favorite breweries. Mouthfeel is just under perfect, as it is light. But othe than that its VERY hard to do better than this beer. Outstanding. Love it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Skullbussa,4.65,"This is the best gateway drug into the IPA world.  Mouthfeel and hoppyness are certainly well within the tolerances of the IPA-uninitiated but, even better, makes Two Hearted nicely suited for all-day drinkability, if you are so inclined.  A very mild floral fuses very well with the hop nature of this beer, masking the bite of the hops just well enough to ""get you over"" the IPA wall that stops many.  I rank this second only to O'Dell's IPA in terms of overall taste, this is ABSOLUTELY one of the very best beers you can drink of any type.  Very hard to find on tap outside of the northern midwest. I find very little difference between the bottled and draught examples I have tried, and I have tried many.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Petey_the_Quiet,4.28,"Finally found this beer locally and it was on-tap! The appearance was light, very much in the IPA wheelhouse. The aroma was of floral notes and hoppy as is indicative of IPAs. The taste was the smoothest, most well balanced IPA I've yet to enjoy. Sometimes the hoppy characteristics can overpower an IPA, but not so with this brew. The mouthfeel was perfectly enjoyable, went down smooth. Could drink multiples of this beer without issue.  This beer should be on your 'want' list if you've not yet had it. Hell, it should be on your 'want' list for whenever you want a beer period. This brew hits the spot for sure.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,FeelinitNow,3.89,"Poured from a bottle into a tall clean glass.  A: A hazy orange/burgandy color with a sudsy viscous quality head  S: The predominant smell is lovely, a mix between grapefruit and pomegranate with other citrus fruit smells present. Other smells to note are: raisins, apple and pineapple.  T: Not overly sweet and very well balanced with the hop bitterness that rolls off the back of your tongue and stays with you for 10 seconds or so.  M: Slight carbonation that really compliments the beer as a whole. Also very creamy, nice touch!  O: There are so many quality factors you can feel as you drink this beer. It just stands way above quite a few beers and I'll definitely enjoy drinking this beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MisSigsFan,3.59,"Pours a darker golden color. Darker than most IPAs. Thick off white head. Aroma is a bit light. Citrus, pine, a little tropical fruit. Tastes mostly of citrus and malt. The pine and tropical fruit doesn't come out in the taste very much. The bitterness is balanced out pretty well by the malt backbone. Mouthfeel is a bit thicker than other IPAs. Not bad though. Overall, I was expecting way more from this brew after hearing so much about it. Just your average IPA with nothing special really. I really wanted to love this beer but sadly it just didn't live up to the hype.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,James773,3.81,"A nice golden yellow color. Can't really say much about the head since I drink it out of the bottle (very drinkable). Floral and fruity nose, but not too strong. Flavors are very well balanced. You can definitely taste the hoppy backend but it's very well balanced by the sweeter/breadier hops flavors. Good for people getting into beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TheFizzinator,4.09,"Pours a light brown/murky golden color with a minimal head. Smells of peaches, nectarines, and some grapefruit notes. Not a very overpowering smell, more balanced and held in check like the beer as a whole. Sweet grapefruit comes to mind from the taste along with the peaches from the nose. So its pretty true to nose in terms of flavor profile. None of these tastes are overwhelming though. Packs a light mouthfeel with a little bit of carbonation, the muted flavor and bitterness makes this one go down very easily, so the drinkability is very high.  An enjoyable standby for most. Nothing mind blowing but it's hard to find a major fault with this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,stella77artois,3.91,"12 oz bottle poured into pilsener glass.  A - Pours a hazy orange-amber with a fair amount of carbonation rising. Took a slightly aggressive pour, but a 2 finger head formed. Head was thin and somewhat fizzy. Quickly dissipated to a slight white ring.  S - Not a whole lot as far as complexity, but fruity hops are noted, and a general flowery aroma. Perhaps dandellion and lilac, I suppose. Smooth and mild malts noted as well. Nice smelling beer.  T - It's a pretty mild tasting IPA in comparison to other's IMO, but it's a great one. Hops up front of course. Grapefruit, lime, dandellion and white flour in the hoppiness. A fairly strong malt backbone is present and can be noted early. Slightly bready, some caramel and angel food cake notes. Very nice tasting beer.  F - Hides the somewhat high ABV well. Very drinkable. Enough carbonation for a fizz fix, but burns slightly on the way down. Overall though, it has a good feel.  O - Happy to find a random single of a Top 250 beer at my favorite local store. Not as flavorful or powerful as some other IPA's, I might put it on the Pale Ale/IPA fringe. But the flavor is excellent, lot's of hops and a strong matl backbone. Highly recommended to any IPA or Pale Ale fans.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ThisLadyLovesBeer,3.88,"A = A very pretty amber IPA, long-lasting head with lacing. S = True to the label, it is heady with hops! T = For the IPA lover, this would be heaven; for me, too hoppy, but IPAs aren't a favorite. Leaves a floral, hoppy aftertaste on the tongue. M = A slight bit creamy and not overly carbonated. Quite nice!  I am not an IPA lover by any means. In fact, I am allergic to the hops as my head stuffs up almost immediately after the first few sips of drinking an IPA. But, the label didn't identify itself as an IPA, only in the verbiage on the back label did I discover its pedigree. So, in fairness, I would have to say in this review that this is one of the better IPAs I've tasted, although I would have initially skipped it if I had known it was an IPA! Very cool artwork on the label, too.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Tsar_Riga,4.39,"A - A cloudy golden-orange color, with a nice but not extraordinary off-white head. Some persistence, and definite lacing.  S - Does not come out with huge swings, but nice subtle jabs of citrus and pine. Grass and vegetative qualities underlie the stronger fruit.  T - No doubt this has citrus at the front, but perhaps most surprising for me is which - lemon notes are near the top, with tangerine and orange underlying, fading into some pine and grass, with some sweetness. Given the strength of the hop, the finish is surprising in that there's not nearly the bitter bite you might expect.  M - With moderate carbonation and only minor drying, this is a very easy beer on the tongue.  O - I really enjoy this beer, and there's no doubt for me that I will be returning to it as a regular staple. I am a huge fan of grapefruit notes and the hops that make those possible, but this makes the case for other citrus themes from the hop. Top notch.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Boozermurfin,4.49,"Always in my fridge. Always been a go to beer. Finally a review.  A - never really understood the point if this category. But what the heck, looks like a beer. Nice head amber orange color.  S - hard to beat. Beautiful aroma. Flowery, citrus, piney hop wonderfulness.  T - taste like it smells. Pich up something different everytime. Citrus orange, touch of grapefruit, sweeter tangerine maybe. Just enough malty backbone and sweetness to make you want to sip and sip again.  M - awesome everytime. Touch of creaminess before the perfect amount if carbonation hits your tongue. Goes down smooth but the hop bite is there and I find it consistent from beginning to well after swallow.  O - one of my favorites.

O: I've had this out of the bottle once and it was really good. This is my first review of it and I was very unimpressed. Its not bad, but it isn't the world class IPA I had anticipated.

The smell is moderate, but the taste takes it up a notch. No one would ever accuse this beer of being overstated, but you don't have to search around for the aroma, or the taste. Mouthfeel is good.

287,1093,shacawgo24,4.96,"A-Murky orange. Hazy. Beautiful color gradation, (a bit darker at top, lighter on bottom). Held to light the body is yolky and bright. Creamy white head. Soapy. Average size. Average lacing which is spotty. When head is gone a veneer of smoky, misty fog permeates over the body. Remains carbonated and bubbly to finish.  S-Orange. Lemon. Lime. Mandarin orange. Grass. Mellow pine. Sweet caramel malt. Peach. Cream. Wet mildew, like a pond. Seaweed maybe. Floral. Woodsy. Perfume. Versatile smelling beer.  T-Citrus floods in. You get the classic orange, lemon and lime. Sweet tangerines even. Tropical fruits come forward: papaya & pineapple. Bitter citrus, not grapefruit, but more like tasting an orange rind/skin. A perfect malt backbone arches out in the middle. A puff cloud of grain rises. The finish is unique. The citrus hops are cooling like a mint. The hops also impart the customary bitter pine finish. A pure pine taste, like rubbing actual pine on the tongue. The smoothest and yet bold IPA you can ask for. The malt backbone is the highlight of the taste. Some kind of plant is in there. Like, aloe, or cactus. Something.  M-Refreshing moderate-medium body. More on the fluid side than chewy. Medium carbonation. Will thicken with time to a more creamier velvet state. Slightly sour citrus aftertaste. Sweet as well. Bitter resins and pine contrast beautifully with the sweet & sours. A cool minty finish is perceptible too.  O-America's IPA. All the ingredients are harmonious and deliver realistic fresh flavors. I feel like I'm eating into a juicy orange soaked in malt all drizzled in pine oil. Two Hearted Ale is not only the benchmark for IPA, but the bar that is not surpassed. Less than a handful of IPA's MATCH it, (Sculpin is one). The malt backbone makes my own straighten up and take notice of it's greatness. I'm honored at the availability of this sessionable IPA. Weird, but I cheers to a beer. Thanks for being, you.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ChefHopMeister,4.44,"Bottled 12/30/2013 Served in a chilled pint sized glass  Appearance: Sunshine golden straw. Beautiful color.  Nose: Citrus rind, spice, sweet malt  Taste: Sweet spicy bitterness, fresh hoppy pop, some sticky rich malt  Mouthfeel: Creamy, perfect carbonation  Overall: Two Hearted Ale has always been a favorite of mine of the IPA style but this batch is probably the freshest BTHA that I've come across. Well balanced and enjoyable. This one is a benchmark example of the AIPA style. Simply delicious and highly recommended, especially when introducing someone to the world of IPA's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,PA-hunter,4.73,"Poured a bottle into a glass. 7% abv.  Appearance- Translucent amber with a thick bubbly head.  Smell- Highly citrus with hints of grapefruit and orange.  Taste- Highly flavorful and appealing. Starts with that piney hop like taste with citrus undertones. After the pine flavor comes the hop bitterness as well. The different part of this IPA compared to others is that it still has a ton of hop flavor, but just isn't as bitter as many.  Mouthfeel- An ideal amount of carbonation with an awesome finish. Moderate in body, just right to the style.  Overall- This is one of the smoothest IPA's I have ever tried. As stated earlier, it wasn't insanely bitter but the hop prescence was more than evident. A high quality brew for sure that is full of flavor. It was so smooth it was as if it came off a tap, however this sample was from a bottle. For an IPA fan, it would be hard topping and a must try. Besides the great taste, it is an awesome beer with a trout on the label!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,CraigS119,4.75,"Purchased at my local Publix (Tampa, FL). 6-pack for $10.99.. usually don't splurge on the non-local crafts, but I've heard good things, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  A- Pours dark golden stream. Unfiltered. Glorious. About a .25 inch of head, which is slowly dissipating into the beautiful murkiness.  A- Very hoppy and piney. Tingles the nostrils. Smells like your quintessential IPA, plus the added delicate notes of citrus.  F- Tastes very fruity/citrus-peely upfront... Then you get the carbonation and bitter tail-end. A very muli-faceted flavor profile that goes together swimmingly.  M- Mouthfeel is absolutely perfect. Just the right amount of carbonation.  O- This is a great ""My First IPA!"" beer for a budding young beer connoisseur because it's fucking delish.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Mike_Moe,3.44,"Appearance: Orange amber color with a blonde head. Aroma: Malty sweet aroma. Flavor: Full bodied roasted malt flavor. Overall: The roasted malt flavor is up front. The brew ends with a smooth semi sweet bitterness. This is not a bad beer. It has a good malt grain base, but its missing that “umph” in flavor that would make it a great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

This ale Pours a gorgeous hazy Orange color with a medium head that dissipates to a lasting lacing. The aroma is pure citrus with notes of grass and very fresh on the nose. It Sips smooth but a little chewy due to the beers unfiltered quality. The flavor is bitter on the front end and malty on the rear. It is very fresh and refreshing and balanced.

Essentially this a good gateway IPA for those looking to get into the style who aren't looking for a bitter bomb...  Has a nice cloudy straw appearance with frothy 1-finger head from a vigorous pour  Smell has more in common with a Saison than what you'd expect from an IPA these days...zesty, floral, hay, and lemon  Very floral and lemony up front to drink, leading into some pale malt, with NO lingering bitterness on the back end. Strange to drink and IPA without that all important dry bitter finish  Moderate/heavy carbo helps to coat the tongue with all the flowery lemons  Easy drinking and very summerlike brew which fills in the gap between PA and IPA.

M - Light and smooth, a little bit of bitterness, good malt presence.  O - A great IPA.

287,1093,xabyss,4.55,"It’s been too long since I’ve had a damn fine IPA. So, let’s have a damn fine IPA. Two Hearted Ale pours a hazy dull copper with half a finger or less of foamy white head that's quick to dissipate. Loads of citrus and pine hops on the nose. Herbal and earthy in the hop profile as well. Simple, clean and... whatever the smell equivalent is for ""tasty."" A very hop forward brew, no doubt, but the balancing power of its smooth malt backbone cannot be overstated. The finish has hints of citrus, lingering malt and then a swooping bitterness comes in to wipe the palate clear. Exquisite.

After the head dissipates, lacing remains clinging to the side of the glass.  Aroma - You can smell the beer as soon as you crack the bottle open. You have sweetness from the malts and hops, citrus fruits (grapefruit, orange, lemon) as well as floral hops.  Taste - The grapefruit, orange, and a hint of lemon hit your tongue at the front. You get the sweetness from the beer as well. The floral flavors come in towards the back of the mouth and leave a nice, lingering bitterness. The aftertaste is a great combination of the fruits and floral flavors.  Mouthfeel - Carbonation is minimal. Medium body. Bitter, but not overdone.  Overall - A delicious and flavorful IPA. Great stuff!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,rawfish,3.85,"Clear amber, a mild chill haze to begin with. Thin white cap of half a finger leaves rings of great lacing on the glass. Retention was average, not much of it left after a few dregs.  Balanced malt and hop aroma, starts with warm buttered croissants of all things with a bit of bakers yeast meddling with a moderate pine, orange citrus and bright herbaceous hops character, juniper and red berries come to mind.  Malt is standard two-row, solid breadiness with a bit of raw husks showing before the hops arrive with a leafy green herbaceous and pine flavor, balanced push between malts and hops. Moderate bitterness begins to cleanse the palate before alcohol and aftertaste leak in with some lemon Pledge solvent flavor that ghosts quickly in and out.  Where this beer lacks in overwhelming flavor or aroma it makes up for with a medium body and creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol pretty well hidden and easy to drink. (Can mouthfeel please be worth more on the damn BA rating scale?)  I can finally check off this beer on my IPA bucket list, a intricately crafted balanced beer but also leaves me very aware of my apparent conditioning towards the west coast varieties.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Dry tangerine finish Feel: Full mouthfeel, bright carbonation leaving a clean dry finish. Overall: One of the best beers of its style. I'm sure most of you have noticed that a lot of our perception of a beer has a lot to do with the beer you've had just before (for those of you who are in the habit of drinking more than one beer). Two Hearted Ale tastes great no matter what you drank before it. It stands by itself. So clean, so good. It's like a reset for your palette. I suppose it should be mentioned that this beer uses only centennial hops, so you can always use this to get a centennial base line. I have never drunk this beer and had it taste bad. I have only recently started noticing bottled/canned dates but I have been drinking this beer for at least 20 years and it always tastes the same.

287,1093,brewerburgundy,4.25,"12oz bottle, Boulevard tulip, bottled 7/07/17.  Deep yellow and clear beer with a tall light tan head.  Crisply hoppy. There are lively aromas of floral hops, grapefruit, and candied lemon peel. It verges on juicy, but it's single minded.  Two Hearted starts with sweet clean malt and things quickly turn Centennial. All the grapefruit, pine, citrus, and floral flavors are here. The finish is moderately bitter and mostly clean. One gets a little lingering citric bitterness.  This is on the dry side of IPAs, but only just, resulting in a clean finish and overall crispness.  I haven't had Two Hearted for a quite awhile as it isn't available in Hawaii. I happened on this very fresh bottle now that I'm back on the mainland and it is as good as ever. Along with Sierra Nevada it typifies the American IPA style, at least the West Coast type.

T: Bright tropical fruits of pineapple with fresh citrus juices and fresh cut pine. Not resiny or woody but instead reminiscent of new pine needles. Sweet pale malts wash over the tongue.

Smell: Lots of things going on here, picked out some floral scents but couldn't really make out the rest. A hole bunch of smells coming out of this one, very pleasant. Taste: Very nice bite from the hops but not overpoweringly bitter. Picked out some pine and a slight citrus taste. Very smooth and drinkable. Barely get the alcohol which could easily lead me to make this a session ale until I fall on my ass when I'm done. Mouthfeel: smooth but coats the tongue to fully let you enjoy the beautiful mix of flavors, but doesn't linger too long to beat up the palette Overall: I was very pleased to have finally tried this much hyped brew.

Bitter but not overly so.  Light-bodied, medium-high carbonation, citrusy, fruity, light bitterness.

287,1093,artoolemomo,3.96,"Appearance- Pours up a good amount of head which has pretty good retention. The head is almost pure cotton white but there are minor hints of yellow. The body is a medium amber that appears pale in the light. The lacing left is perforated sheeting.  Nose- Rather subdued but that may be in large part because this is almost 3 months old. Citrus notes that range from orange, lemon, to tangerine. Light peach. No real pine or resin but slight caramel. Swirling reveals heavy peach. Some melon.  Taste- Very representative of the nose but with more dominance from the caramel. Shows some of its age with the mellow hops but I rather like it. The caramel is quite smooth and mixes well with the round citrus notes of orange, lemon, and tangerine. The caramel interacts with a peach note and produces hints of honey. Light notes of tropical fruits. A tiny bit of matchstick. This may be a result of age but this beer has a sublimity I don't often associated with IPAs. The age does cut into some of the complexity that I'm sure fresh Two Hearted has. That's really my only complaint. Really good beer that is probably great fresh. Slight grapefruit. That and the minor matchstick are pretty much the only notes of bitterness. Hopheads will detest older Two Hearted.  Mouthfeel- Between light and medium bodied with slight syrup and juiciness to the texture. Small amount of creaminess as well. Light carbonation with a tiny zing works well with the tropical fruits and spice of the finish.  Drinkability- Very accessible for an IPA. Can't comment on price point as I got this online. Definitely not worth 7 bucks a bottle but reasonable at the 9 to 10 bucks a six pack that this goes for in its distribution area.  Overall- Really good beer. Not your typical IPA (but this may be a result of age) but quite enjoyable. Definitely worth a try- even you find a “not so fresh” bottle.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Taste: And it does taste bitter. Floral hops all the way, and not much complexity at all. There's still some of that biscuit flavor, but it's all about the hops here.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and fairly crisp.  Overall: This beer has been around awhile and was probably a favorite among hopheads before the hop craze. Now this beer tastes one-dimensional, unbalanced, and simple. In a world with more than enough IPAs, this probably isn't the accomplished beer that it once was, but it's still good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,utopiajane,4.08,"Pours slightly hazy. Golden and hued with orange. A creamy head of white foam tops this beer and it leaves sheets of lace as you drink. The nose is terrific with hops. First some ripe tropical fruit, mango, apricot and pineapple. Then a nice honey sweetness and a bit of faint spice. The drink has more bread than you expected form the nose. Faint grain and a brisk dryness. The fruity and floral hops fill up the palate with a bouquet of flavors. Tart citrus, stone fruit and tropical sweetness , honey and a light pine. The supple malt is a bready and shy but you can taste the grain on the palate and there's a bit of bitter. The mouthfeel is slick. Silky and creamy. Finishes dry and with a floral aftertaste.  This is not the usual in your face IPA. This one is subtle and gentle. It has a powerful hop character that presents big fruit but also the delicate floral aspects. In the drink the floral is powerful and reminds me of honeysuckle. It drinks softly like an english IPA. it's graceful and flowing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,AllForAugust,4.02,"To date, one of the most fantastic examples of American IPA I've had the pleasure to enjoy. Such character in this beer... The alcohol is brilliantly masked by the piney hops while the malt plays the support role fantastically, careful not to overwhelm.  A: Damn near what my perception of what an American IPA should be. Pale, yet vibrant. Hues of amber blended nicely against the original English colour. Slightly cloudy. 4.25-would bang.  S: ""Oh what a delicate floral bouquet...Nope, wait a tick, piney yum yum."" The use of American hops is clearly evident among the first whiff. My guess... Centennial Hops? Fuck if I know, I'm no pro. The balance here is fantastic, but perhaps, if my own criticisms would be permitted, could use a tad more hop character. However, the simplicity does not work against it.  T: Ya ever walk into an English pub and instantly crave a pint of English ""real ale"". This is what I imagine the american version of that to be. The idea of California Common shakes your tongues' hand (like your fucking tongue has a goddam hand), but then pulls the ole switcharoo and is like ""wait, I'm an IPA"". Malty sweetness again, plays prop to the bitterness of the hops. This beer tastes almost exactly as it smells.  M: There's that distinctive grindy feeling Coca Cola leaves on your teeth after you drink it; we must find a word for it. Subtle hints of it are present here, but only barely. The ""front nine"" presents itself smoothly, with little, but an appropriate level of carbonation, allowing you to truly taste this brew. The ""back nine"" leaves a dry finish, much akin to red wine.  O: Maybe, possibly think about getting around to trying this beer. No, wait, do it. This one's a must.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Not that hoppy to me but was a pleasant blend of malt and hops. A decent carbonated beer. I liked this but wasn't wowed... Hate to go against the mass opinion, but just a good beer",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mitch3114,3.69,"Poured bottle into pint glass  A- appearance was quite average. It's another IPA. This one was on the lighter side of the IPA color spectrum. A nice golden color.  S- A light floral note to the hops with some slight pine. The hops seem a little bitter on the nose. Some brown sugar sweetness. Some vapors that give me a hint that there is some alcohol in this one.  T- Some sweetness, some bitterness. The hops are very prominent and a little bitter but not too overpowering. Definitely getting some alcohol with this one. It tastes strong for an IPA. But, it is 7% ABV so it is strong. Any stronger and it would be a DIPA. In addition to the alcohol, some sugar on the finish. Not very complex as I am really only getting that bitter hop taste. Although it seems a bit one dimensional, it's satisfying.  M- This beer has some body to it. I wouldn't quite go as far as saying it's full bodied, but it is close. It's definitely drinkable. Carbonation is a bit low, perhaps because of the higher ABV?  O- Overall, this is a solid offering in the IPA style. It's fairly priced and it's finally available in my area in upstate New York. Before two weeks ago, I have never seen this beer before. I know this beer has been rated more times than any other IPA on this site, but honestly I don't see why. The American IPA is the top dog on the craft beer scene. Every brewery makes an IPA. Some make several. There are many many IPA's to choose from out there. Thousands. What makes this beer stand out from the others? I think it tastes pretty above average, but like I said, it's one dimensional. There's not a lot of depth. It is good. I could place it in my top ten IPA's, but it definitely wont fall in my top five. To me this doesnt live up to the hype.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,FeloniousDrunk,4.38,"A: Poured form a Boston Round growler into a pint glass. A nice, 1-finger ecru head appeared and dissipated into a thin ring around the outside of the glass. The color is golden straw in hue, and semi-hazed in texture. Really inviting.  S: Smooth and balanced, with a nice hop citrus blending evenly with an almost orang-juice sweetness. A mild malt character carries the smell through, with other notes of pine forest, wood, earth, and grass. Overall it's light on the nose.  T: Wow, this is not your standard-issue IPA, and yet follows similar flavor profiles. Some intangibles here that definitely kick it up a notch in my book. A nice, even-keeled taste in the mouth with a good hop/malt balance, followed by a slightly sharp swallow, and a bitter aftertaste. Smooth and blended the whole way, with no one flavor dominating. Tastes a lot like it smells. Flavor notes of citrus wedges dusted with sugar, flower petals, some great hop pine/floral notes right at the back of the tongue, and a light grain backbone. Superbly crafted.  M: Smooth, clean, and with just a touch of bite and bitterness on the swallow. It has all of the characteristics of a great IPA without leaning heavily on any one. Well-rounded, easy-drinking, and it feels great in the mouth.  O: This beer has all of the flavor of the IPA without some of the palate-crushing bitterness or harsh strength often seen. It's not a ""big"" IPA, but it's beauty is in its subtlety. Great flavors that are at times hard to place, but really a delight.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ChestSplitter,3.88,"Bottle poured into glass. Smells fruity; not just grapefruit, but sweeter. Tastes fruity as well. No malt to speak of, but despite this it's still tasty and interesting and doesn't just rake the palate with dish soap bitterness. The finish is certainly bitter like any good IPA, but by the end of the glass you notice the fruity hoppy flavor much more than the bite. Well done.

Great head retention, with lacing that lingers until the beer is gone...  Floral, grapefruit, piney nose, Fantastic.  Yup, that's what I'm talking about. Just the right amount of hop bitterness without being overpowering. Almost perfect.  Overall, the best beer I have ever tasted.

A - Light golden amber, one finger of white lace S - sweet citrus fruits and floral notes T - Not a malty brew at all. Centennial hops dominate with a dry citrus and pine on the finish.

Shining portrait of centennial hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,kaseydad,4.36,"Finally got my hands on this elusive brew...being from the West Coast and all. Excited.  Pours a hazy apricot colored ale with a massive head that breached the glass. Damn! Big time lacing if you like that.  Getting some nice dank hop smell from that get-go. Pineapple, orange, light pear and malt. Some floral.  I must say the best thing about this is the balance. A great blend between bitter and a touch of sweetness. Nice light hoppy finish that is pleasing to the buds and keeps the salivation right on the edge to quench with another sip...only to keep the cycle going.  Smooth mouthfeel.  Overall this lives up to the rating and the hype. Living on the West Coast I am use to the West Coast style IPA but this is a refreshing turn from the smack in your face grapefruit/hop explosion. A remarkably easy drinking IPA that is a perfect example for breaking in novice IPA drinkers....as well as veterans doing ___(insert your activity). Honored to try this gem and happy to sing it's praises.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S: Grapefruit and bitter citrus. Spicy yeast and gentle toasty malt.  T: Follows nose. Grapefruit and other bitter citrus blends into creamy dry estery/white peppery yeast. Very interesting quaff due to simplicity and good ingredients.  M: Creamy. Dry. Spicy finish. Very faint booziness at ultimate out breath. Don't burb....it ruins this pleasant finish with an astringent quality.  O: One of my favorites.

A revelation when I first tried it years ago, and still a reliable top-tier tap choice despite the massive increase in quality local competition throughout the country.

287,1093,WoodBrew,3.93,The Bell's Two Hearted IPA is a decent beer. It pours a hazy golden with thick white head that is lacing. The scent carries fresh pine with slight bitter citrus. The taste starts a very slight bitter then sweetens with the malt used. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a sessionable IPA.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

There was an abundance of bubbles swimming throughout the glass. Fair sized creamy white head that left a great deal of sticky lacing as it collapsed.  Nose Impressive hit of hops off of the first whiff. A nice combination of floral and citric notes. Pine and grapefruit really stood out. There was a faint presence of malts. Cracker and thicker notes of molasses… but let’s not kid ourselves here, this is all about the hops!  Mouth Hops up front. Herbal notes of pine, lemongrass and juniper berries. Sweeter citric notes developed towards the finish… primarily grapefruit. Sweet notes of caramel and molasses really tamed the hops, levelling this brew out nicely. Medium bodied. Moderate carbonation.  Overall Another endorsement for this legendary IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Duane_Opfer,4.5,"12 oz bottled poured into an IPA glass. Packaged by date of 8/6. Consumed on 9/27.  A - Golden amber in color. Poured no head with light carbonation. Not cloudy, yet not very translucent. Light ring of foam around edge with no lacing... more like small circles of residual foam.  S - Very fragrant. Dried apricot smell dominant, with hint of green apple, white grape, raisin, and brown sugar.  T - A very pleasant tart IPA... flavors include lemon, melon, sour apple, pineapple, melon, and honey. Light pleasant alcohol notes with some bitter hops. Well balance malt backbone with lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue.  M - Although carbonation is not readily apparent visually, yields a tingly crisp feel on the tongue. Feels very clean.  O - Can't believe I haven't had this beer in awhile... starting drinking a few years ago before I really became exposed to the world of craft beers and thought it was phenomenal then. Got wrapped up in trying different IPAs and DIPAs and lost track of this gem. This beer is always a solid win and competes well even with limited releases seasonals. Also, gets high marks for being widely available. Highly recommended and good year round.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,1sophrosyne1,4.31,"Poured into a pilsner glass and enjoyed over 30 minutes. The look is a hazy orange amber with a little visible carbonation. A sudsy head falls fairly quickly, but bubbles cling and lacing endures.  There's blood orange and peach made sweet by malt right next to the more traditional scents of an American IPA. The fir is honeyed with its own sap, and there's grassy warmth in the nose, too...especially as it warms. A real treat of a bouquet.  A smooth start is quickly cut by sharp carbonation that ushers in bitterness fairly early. Then, a somewhat nutty-sweet phase comes in with a kiss of lime. Apple-cake malt then drops into next phase is where the dank hop weight becomes apparent. Evergreen comes next, along with pepper and spice. Then a bitter and dry finish. My only complaint is that it becomes too musty, out of balance, as the temperature rises.  The mouthfeel is bright and weighty in great balance. Carbonation is just right for me. It just doesn't linger as long as I'd like...needs a little more chew.  This brew is complex and rewarding. There are a few minor areas of imbalance and imperfection, but the blend of flavors and (especially) compelling scents make this one worth many happy returns.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,EmpiricalBill,4.54,"Two Hearted is still a standard-setting IPA, even though the exclusivity factor has dropped. When Bell's was still avoiding distribution in Illinois, we would drive to Indiana to hunt this down. Now it's in my grocery store, usually on sale (Dominick's needs to seriously rethink discounting this one). Fairly light in color, it's more of a yellow than an amber or an orange. Well carbed, you can stir it up to maintain a nice, foamy white head throughout your session. Lots of orange up front and hops in the back. It's hoppy enough for a hob head like me but won't offend.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TWebb,4.45,"Nice! This is a very distinctive and different ale. Dominated by flavors and aromas of sawdust and grass, but I mean that in a totally good way. Sawdust has never tasted so good!

A: A hazy dark golden-amber, small amounts of visible carbonation in the glass. A vigorous pour yields an initial bone-white two-finger head which quickly recedes to a soapy ring. Plentiful curtains of lacing.  S: ...maybe I've just been drinking too much Ruination lately, but this is one of the strangest-smelling IPAs I've ever come across...and I love it. Sweet caramel and toffee malt notes beneath a potent bouquet of citrus and tropical fruit. Grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, some peach and even touches of raspberry and honey. Minimal piney notes, but the slightest hints are present.  T: An initial touch of piney bitterness is quickly swallowed up by a fairly seamless mingling of sweet bready malts with fruity hop notes--orange, grapefruit, lemon zest, and touches of pineapple, mango, and apple. Tropical notes are more subdued on the palate than they were in the nose. Finishes dry and bitter, with a resurgence of pine notes that almost veer into being minty.  M: Medium-bodied, crisp at the front before the carbonation drops off midway through the mouthful. Overall perhaps somewhat lightly carbonated--I'd prefer a bit more effervescence.  O: One of the more unique beers that I've had thus far in terms of smell and taste. While I would've perhaps preferred a bit more carbonation, I can't deny that this beer's reputation is well-deserved.

A- Pours a light orange but hazy body topped by a one inch soapy white head. The head recedes fairly quickly  S- Delightful citrus on the nose, mostly lemon and grapefruit. Slightly sweet smelling. There's almost a peach aroma floating around in the background  T- Hop and malt balanced all the way through. Grapefruit, orange, and lemon up front, with pine in the background, all the while mingling with just the right amount of malt. Not overly bitter, which certainly helps the drinkability.  M- Perfectly medium-bodied and middle of the road carbonation. I'm happy it doesn't lean too far one way or the other.

Up front, you're treated to a bouquet of sweet, tropical fruit and a bit of malt that concludes with the perfect amount of bitterness and some grassy hoppy goodness. Incredibly balanced. Incredibly delicious!  Mouthfeel: Despite its presentation, there is hardly any noticeable carbonation from this medium-bodied beer.

Left magnificent lacing down the edges of the glass.  Smell: Very clean floral and grapefruit hop notes in the nose.  Taste: A magnificent blend of hops and sweet malts. This is one incredibly balanced IPA- there is a strong hop presence, but a very nice malt backbone that really carries the taste of this beer. Unlike other IPAs where the maltiness seems to play a secondary role, or becomes apparent on the palate late in the tasting process, the sweeter malts are detectable throughout a sip and play well with the hoppiness.  Mouthfeel: Great carbonation for the style makes the beer appropriately full-bodied.  Overall: One of the most balanced IPAs I've had, and a very good one. I like how the hops and malt played off each other during the entire sip, rather than one heavily dominating up front/on the back end.

It smells flavorful and delicious. I am excited to taste this.  Taste: There are a lot of flavors in the taste, but they change very quickly. At the end of the sip, i can taste a citrus flavor which is sort of enlightening. I really enjoy the taste of this beer.  Mouthfeel: This beer isn't very thick and it has a middle of the ground carbonation. It makes it drinkable. But it does really say much to me. Its just sort of middle ground.  Overall: I had this beer recommended to me from a few girls from Michigan. I am not disappointed nor am i impressed.

Almost smells like cinnamon but there are spices here for sure. Some citrus from the hops and some fruit but wow. So much spice in the nose.  As the nose is different from all IPAs I've had, as is the taste. Sweet malt and spice up front with an earthy citrus finish from the hops. Perfectly balanced.  Really pricks the tongue. Partly from the carbonation. Partly from the spice. Very nice.  This is a very good beer. Would definitely drink again. Worth the try if you've never had it.

Maybe even a bit of spice, just a bit. Malt background is very present; offers some nice countering sweetness and toffee flavors. Not overly bitter at all, and extremely clean, making it quite quaffable.  M: Fluid and just the right amount of fizz, very refreshing and drinkable.  O: Not sure what the hype is about.

287,1093,KFBR392,3.43,"Appearance: Pours with a solid finger of head. A light burnt orange color to the brew. Below average carbonation active in the glass while drinking. Sticky rings of lacing left at each level of the beer.  Smell: The front is a citrus heavy aroma with main accents of oranges, tangerines, and pine. The malt adds a distinctive punch that again is heavy on the nose. The dominant tones of this beer seem to keep anything else in check from adding complexity to this brew. Very bold and straight forward.  Taste: Pretty much what I would have expected after the aroma with some added complexity. The front right away is a tasty bouquet of tropical fruits. The body is the heavy tones of bitter hops and thick malt. The finish returns with some tropical fruit tones and resin.  Mouthfeel: Pretty middle of the road. Decent floral tones with the malt and hops taking their toll on the palate.  Overall: I remember having this early in my craft career and not being impressed so I figured it was time to try it again. I'm not going to sit here and call it a shitty beer, just not an IPA made for my palate.

Smell is orange, grapefruit, passion fruit, grass ,esters and some yeast with cracker malt aromas. Taste is orange, floral, grass, spice and yeast with bread and cracker malt flavors. Feel is medium in body, somewhat bitter but smooth and little dry in the finish.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,BurgeoningBrewhead,4.5,"Finally able to try the famous Two Hearted Ale (Hopslam, you're next...) Poured into tulip; slightly hazy orange-gold with a fluffy white head, very nice lacing. Smell is muted bready malts balanced very nicely with sweet floral and fruity notes, as well as some yeast scents. Taste is incredibly well balanced; it starts out with smooth subdued malt, buttery flavors and herbal/citrus/bitter hops all blend together in a delicious orgy of flavor. 7% isn't noticeable at all, I'd be tempted to session this one all day. Overall I'm a bit underwhelmed, but such is the case with probably almost any super-hyped beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Timothy223ktktm99,4.22,"a very good beer.  the 7% abv is nice but not so dominant, neither in feel nor in taste.  the mouth feel is nice, not too much foam  drinks like a solid, classic ale, that is a good representation of its class, w/o being too different or daring.  you cant drink this beer and be dissapontined",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Maninthearena,3.87,"Appearance- Not part of the beer, but I love the trout on the bottle... Nice pale amber pour with a thick head that left some significant legs on the glass as it dropped.  Nose- Malty and some fruitiness with a little more sweetness than some pale ales, maybe some honey quality from the malt. Opened up to some pineapple with time.  Taste- Distinctively American hops with some sour grapefruit qualities. Some toastiness before a bitter finish as one would expect, a little bit of ""spruce"" flavor. Good stuff.  Mouthfeel- Fairly crisp at first before mellowing down and thinning due to the slightly lower carbonation. I prefer my pale ales to be a little bit more mouth-coating.  Overall- A well crafted, balanced beer. One for the North woods. While it has a nice blend of flavors, I feel it's maybe missing that one layer that blows you away. That being said, it went down the hatch pretty dang quick...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Siebel98,3.76,"On tap at North Banks restaurant on the Outer Banks. The aroma and flavor are all grassy hops... not my favorite.

287,1093,CoachC,4.16,"Drinking this old reliable on tap at World of Beers. This is one of the classic, all-time American IPA's. Pours a nice, golden color with a 1 inch foam head. Intense citrus hops dominate in this one, unbelievably strong grapefruit flavor. Smells of citrus hops as well. On tap or in the bottle, it's really good.

Aroma of orange and grapefruit. Some floral notes. Underlying earthiness.  Tastes of floral and earthy notes. Some hints of citrus. A bit of peppery spice on the end.  Medium body with some bitterness. Mild carbonation.  A very good, easy drinking IPA.

287,1093,Rayek,4.39,"Time for the 2,808th review of the beer voted the 2013 Number 2 Beer in America by members of the AHA. Let's see what happens.  A: Two Hearted pours with a decidedly hazy peach hue. It's topped by a dense and rocky cream cap that sticks as a thick blanket of foam all the way down the glass. A heavy sheeting of lace is left in the beer's wake.  S: My nose picks up a lot of pepper and citrus out front. A bit of nutmeg and sweetbread sit behind the heavier aromas. The overall effect is much more interesting than the grapefruit-bomb IPAs I've had from a few too many other breweries.  T: Dry sweetbread flavors start things off, but are very quickly replaced by a strong bitter bite. The bitter flavors carry a generous dose of lemon and grapefruit citrus that are buffered by pepper and anise. The bitterness lingers long after each sip is completed. A dry and slightly puckering finish rounds things out.  M: The body is both oily and sticky, with a slightly high dose of tingle.  O: Okay. I can see why so many hop lovers covet this beer. It's bitter without being pallet wreaking, while provide much more complexity than many (most?) American IPAs. It's not a Top 10 beer on my list, but it is awfully nice to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Smurf2055,4.55,"Pours golden with about three fingers of white pillowy head.  Smell is mild hoppy and almost a bit buttery.  Taste is hoppy, floral, sweet, almost tart. Earthy finish.

287,1093,SportsandJorts,4.04,"Appearance: a light orange color. pretty good clarity. a finger or so of a off white head that leaves a bit of a lacing  Smell: floral hops with a bit of citrus. lots of hops. slightest hint at some malts  Taste: again with the strong hops. floral dominates but citrus is up there. maybe a hint of spiciness  Mouthfeel: fairly resiny, but light and drinkable for the content.  Overall: a solid ipa by a solid brewery. not much else needs to be said",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JohnnyBarman,4.25,"Picked up a sixer of this at Merchant's Fine Wine in Dearborn. Been looking forward to finally trying this brew.  Poured into a Bell's nonic. Bright golden in colour, with about a half inch of sturdy head which lasts for most of the glass, and produces some nice sticky lacing.  Bready, with a strong whiff of grapefruit from the Centennial. Some additional tropical hop flavor and a mild wine character.  Tasty IPA with solid hop presence (grapefruit, mild mango, other citrus, wine), dry bready and mildly astringent finish. Very smooth, lighter bodied, great carbonation.  Very sturdy IPA, would certainly be a regular pickup if it were available for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bmwats,4.06,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint.  A: Pure golden hue. Pours a 2 finger, frothy, white head. Settles slowly, leaving a thick foam blanket, and some dry sticky residue. Plenty of sticky spider web lacing.  S: Sourdough, grapefruit, and orange. A little floral.  T: Kind of a woody, moderately piny palate, with a slight sweetness of maple syrup and a little grapefruit.  M: Light and crisp. Higher alcohol content not apparent.  D: Session, or try to savor.  Atmosphere is pretty good. Great hue, really nice thick head, and plenty of persistent lacing. Nose is bready with some pine, grapefruit, and floral notes. Woody and lightly piny with some distinct sweetness. Very pristine. Overall, this is a really good quaff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,gillagorilla,3.81,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Duvel tulip (bottled on 6/5/13)  A: A nice copper color with minimal head.  S: Nice blending of pine and citrus, like a mellow Pine-Sol. More citrus than pine here. Quite interesting and noticeably different for an IPA.  T: Balance. I always use pine as a flavor but this one is different in that it has pine/forest nuances, like you notice the needles and what not. I get almost no citrus, it is just pine and even that isn't super strong, it just is the flavor. Solid, even pine throughout, that continues into the aftertaste. The carbonation didn't help either, it gave it this weird texture with the flavor.  M: Even carbonation that isn't too noticeable, just a hint of crispness.  O: I was expecting a lot more since everybody is always comparing IPAs to this and they say it is one of the best. It is good but it almost seems too balanced, like I wish that there was something that jumped out at me flavor-wise. I don't what it is, but it just seems quite plain for an IPA. I love IPAs, but it was almost a chore to finish this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Bitter on the forefront and towards the middle very sweet tropical fruit and malty towards the back. Piney and citrusy.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a sweet citrusy dry finish.  Overall: This is a perfect session beer for a hot summer day. This is one of my favorite IPAs. It is perfectly balanced and has a very unique complex taste to it. I would definitely buy this again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TreyIsWilson,4.43,A - Pale orange color. Thin white head. Awesome lacing.  S - Very floral. Easy to smell. Very nice.  T - Great balance of bitter hops and citrus. Citrus becomes more prevelant as it warms.  M - Slight lingering bitterness. Nice creamy mouthfeel.  O - One of Bells best beers.

287,1093,Flounder57,4.27,"12 oz bottle was poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: This beer poured a one finger head that reduced to a thin layer and left some lacing on the glass. It is a pale orange color with great clarity and bubbles coming up through the glass. More lacing on the glass as the beer was drank too.  Smell: crystal, bready, and caramel malts followed by citrus and tropical characteristics.  Taste: Extremely balanced and tasty. Above aromas blended together with some lingering bitterness in the end.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, a bit dry, tingly bitterness, medium bodied, smooth, and low to medium carbonation.  Overall: Pretty solid IPA. Happy to have found this one down on my travels through VA and happy to have scored the last 3 bottles on the shelves. This review is the last of the 3 and now I am dissapointed there are no more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,yeastlovehoppiness_greg,4.17,Two hearted is pretty solid. It is a clear gold color. Smells hoppy and is pretty darn smooth for an IPA. It has a decent head and there was a lot of lacing in the glass. It has a slightly sour aftertaste. Sounds unpleasant but it is really good. this beer also made my mouth tingle all over.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Cyrion,3.69,"Twelve ounce bottle poured into a hefe glass. Sue me.  Appearance: Deep gold and clear, with an inch of off-white head. Weblike lacing rings all the way down the glass. Lovely.  Smell: Both pine and citrus hope, with neither side truly gaining the upper hand. The grapefruit is particularly good, giving me something that is more mouthwatering than pine. I'm not getting much malt, except for a vague sweetness somewhere.  Taste: A delightful citric hop that is softer than you would expect for such well-known IPA.  Mouthfeel: A dry and crisp experience, pleasant without becoming astringent.  Overall: An IPA that is very easy to like. The hops are noticeable, but not assertive, placing it in another category from the unpalatable hop bombs that are in vogue. Lacks the malt I've been searching for, but is a complex beer nonetheless. Well recommended, and possibly my new favorite IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Sarlacc83,3.57,"12oz bottle. Took over 5 years for me to actually try this.  A: Clear golden color with a dissipating white head. Slightly sticky on the glass.  N: Grapefruit and pineapple are dominant over the pine and earth. A little mango and some peach. Very pleasant.  T: Lots more of the tropical fruit flavors. Slightly bitter with more malty of base. Like froot loops. Not the most flavorful,but it’s refreshing.  M: Lighter and not resinous.  O: A classic of the style, but unlike Pliny it doesn’t still stand on its own. Still enoyable, though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,justforrazors,4.63,"2 month old bottle poured to my SN IPA glass.  A- Golden to orange color with brilliant clarity, pours with a two finger white head. Good retention and lacing, which lasts throughout the glass.  S- Smells of grapefruit and pineapple with a slight yeast character also present. A slight caramel sweetness possibly from the malt in the background.  T- Floral and grassy hop flavors along with some citrus fruit, once again the pineapple and grapefruit from the nose is apparent. A sweet note (possibly caramel malt?) is present on the back end of the sip. Moderate bitterness, but it doesn't overpower or peel your enamel like some in the style. No alcohol taste is present.  M- Medium/high carbonation, low/medium mouthfeel, and a great drying note on the end from the low finishing gravity of this beer really dries things out and makes for a refreshing beer that you want to take another sip of almost immediately.  O- Trying to be as objective as possible with this one, but in all honesty, I just love this beer! It is incredibly drinkable; I could easily drink 3-4 of these in the time it takes me to drink some other IPAs. The flavors of the centennial hops dominate, but there is enough malt to back it up. In addition, the finishing gravity of this beer makes for an easy drinking beer that doesn't fill you up.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Mardrommar,4.42,"The label on the back describes the beer as having a crisp finish and a strong floral hop aroma. On the bottom of the label, the bottling date is listed as 02/06/13  Poured into a Libbey tulip glass.  Pours a beautiful golden color with bright yellow highlights. Formed a soapy finger-width head that dissipated within the first 5 minutes. Leaves a spotty amount of lacing that has a soapy consistency. A minor cm or so head remained throughout the duration of the drinking session.  As described, the aroma is potently floral and hoppy. A sweet, bready malt pierces the hop aroma, giving way to a floral scent. Hints of pine, grass, citrus, grapefruit, and lemon are present. The aroma is very well balanced. No one scent truly dominates (not including the sharp sweetness from the malts). Mouthfeel is light and has moderate carbonation.  The initial flavor is citrus that instantly gives way to the bready, caramel sweetness from the malts, and then transitions into a bitter, floral finish with a slight astringency. The finish is crisp and moderately dry. The finish is not extensive at all. Aftertaste is bread and hops.  This beer is extremely well balanced and highly drinkable. One of the more pleasant IPAs I’ve had in recent memory.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,scotorum,3.88,Picked up two of these as part of a mixed-six in Traverse City Michigan two weeks ago.  Tulip glass fill from a 12 oz. bottle.  a. A nearly clear amber. Finger plus thick head shrank slowly to a nice white surface film with a heavier foam ring which spread evenly as lacing as it was drained.  s: Mild fruit.  t: Nice light citrus/pine hop notes with enough hop bite to let you know it's there.  m: Refreshingly light. Quite a lot of carbonation.  o: A great warm weather drink. Nicely balanced.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,PicoPapa,3.94,"12oz bottle. Pours a burnt orange color with a half inch of head. Some lacing. The aroma is piney grapefruit with some malts. Not really aromatic. Taste is a nice tingly pine hop bite followed by some juicy grapefruit. Pretty noticeable malt presence. Very well balanced. Medium bodied with a tingly amount of carnonation. Oily mouthfeel. Not an in your face hop bomb but a good marriage of hops and malts. I think its been said before but this reminds me a bit of Racer 5. Overall, solid IPA for sure.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,dmgeng,4.21,"Got this one due to the overwhelming persuasion from my brewing buddies.  A - Nice orange color with brilliant white head. Sticky lacing all the way down. Very clear for unfiltered ale.  S - Strong hop nose. Full of centennial hops with citrus, pine, and some floral. Very light alcohol fragrance.  T - Has all the hops from the smell with a plethora of pine and citrus/grapefruit on the front with a nice blend of caramel malt. Nice complimenting malt flavor but still more hops as an IPA should be. Very smooth finish with nice hop bitterness which adds crispness.  M - Moderate to moderate/full mouth-feel with the tones of sweetness. Has enough bitterness to make it not linger on the back of the tongue. Fine carbonation.  Overall, one of the best IPA's I've had. I love the centennial hops and the nice balancing act with the malt and hops. Perfect if you don't like overly bitter IPA's and would like a more citrusy example. It's from the Midwest but seems like it should be from the Pacific NW. I could drink these for quite a while.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Immortale25,4.18,Poured into a Dogfish Spiegelau glass. Back label says PKGD 04/16/13  A- Pours a medium amber color with a 3/4 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a 1/4 inch head. Non-resilient lacing leaves small clots behind on the glass.  S- Sweet-smelling hop aroma that's mildly citrusy and a bit musty.  T- Modestly bitter with a bready malt backbone. Slightly sweet with a lingering citrus flavor and very little alcohol detected. Quite similar to a standard pale ale in its overall profile. Balanced and delicate.  M- Slick and oily with medium carbonation and a standard body for the style.  O- The beauty in this beer lies in its drinkability in relation to the ABV. It's subtle in the best way and actually quite sessionable. An American classic.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DenverHopHead,3.99,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a packaged on date of 8/31/16; into a pint glass. Appearance- gold, fairly bubbly and plenty of sediment. Head is thin and white. Lacing is just okay. Smell - pine and floral notes and sweet caramel. Taste - certainly an East coast version of an IPA with a strong malt balance and more toned down hops. Feel - nicely balanced, drinkable and a strong hop bitterness! Overall - definitely a classic East Coast style IPA that is very well done; it's just I tend to gravitate to more hop forward, citrus West Coast style IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TastyAdventure,4.31,"I should start out by saying I don't like IPAs, other than DFH's.  A - not too big of a head. looking like a medium colored ale.... looking good.  S - As they claim, wonderful bouquet of floral aromas.  T - The reason I love this IPA, compared to most of the others that I do not, is that it has a flavorful and distinct hop profile that is pronounced, but not overwhelming, abrasive, puckeringly bitter, and sharply sustaining like a mouthful of fresh cut grass. This is how i perceive most IPAs, but this one is divine. Some grapefruit notes in it. Nice balance with malts.  M - I don't remember anything much about the mouthfeel, I had this several hours before writing the review. good carbonation though.  Overall, I'd take this any day that the weather is over 65. Man, I never thought I'd say that about ANY IPA. Kudos, Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Jaybirdsbeer,3.6,"While recently perusing a beer cooler only to find that the beer I had in mind was unavailable, I had to make a quick back-up choice and saw a Bell's bottle that I hadn't seen before, so I grabbed it. Normally, I wouldn't have chosen one with a close-up of some sort of trout on the label, but I'm glad I did.  The smell was sweet and floral, but the taste had some bite. What at first drink felt light and acidic, the mouthfeel soon grew to exhibit major hoppiness and lingering carbonation on the tongue. Didn't mind the strong floral notes because of the palate cleansing aftertaste. Definitely found a good summer IPA and proved to myself, with Bell's, you really can't go wrong.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Taste was way more impressive than the aroma. Big citrus and floral flavors upfront. Turns to a caramel, bready and malty backbone. Finished with a light bitterness that was floral and a touch piney.  Mouthfeel was medium body, medium carb and a crisp finish.  Overall this is a great beer.

M - You can put quite a few of these back in one sitting. Its mildly carbonated, you can't taste the alcohol and the body is not very big.

S - Abundantly floral, with pine, grass, overtone of grapefruit. ROunded out with a perfect sour-sweet malt. Same profile as plenty of IPAs, but this smells assuredly balanced.  T - Big citric bitter burst up front. Tapers off fine into a good bready-English malt palate. Vibrant and flavorful, but still completely refreshing. A nice sweet/bitter balance that yields notes of blossoms, cinnamon and orange as it warms a bit.  M - More full and sticky than I'd expect, given how drinkable it is.  O - Really blown away by this. I cannot count how many IPA's I've had in my life, but finally trying the Two-Hearted Ale I see why it's such a mainstay of the Midwest. This one is magnificent.  ***  Politics, Art, Beer.

287,1093,ShreddedThumb,4.63,"The one, the only: Bells' Two Hearted Ale.  The Dorm Room Review  Poured into a blue solo cup from a fresh, fish-adorned bottle (4/9/13). This review was written while listening to Moon Hooch.  Appearance: Cloudy complexion, amber color. Similar to many fantastic IPAs. The half-finger head dissipates quickly.  Smell: Quite amazing. It's difficult to avoid smelling the beer. Immediate hoppy aromas flourish, but immense grapefruit prevails. Perhaps some other fruit notes, but the strong, appealing grapefruit is certainly unique.  Taste: The taste mimics the smell fantastically. The usual suspects of American IPA characteristics are there: bitter, hoppy, refreshing. Furthermore, the grapefruit enhances the IPA taste and produces an easy-to-drink 7%'er. One could say Two Hearted is dangerous to drink; I finished half a cup in sublime enjoyment. As the bottle recommends, I can see myself enjoying several bottles of Two Hearted whilst camping on the sandy shoreline of frigid Lake Superior.  Mouthfeel: Lingering bitterness and astringency. Very pleasant. Citrus, grapefruit, desire to drink more.  Overall: Every time I try Two Hearted, I wonder why I don't have a constant stock in my minifridge (maybe because all my income goes to peanut butter and ramen). Arguably the best IPA in the Midwest market. I would love to compare this beast to other renowned IPAs, like Heady Topper and the pair of Plinys.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,TheBrewo,4.24,"We crack the top on a bottle packaged 4/30/13 and pour a brew of sunset goldenrod into our Great Lakes pints. It puts up a two finger head of tight and creamy eggnog colored bubbles, leaving sticky honeycomb lacing all around the glass as it disappears at a slower pace. A chill haze is noted to be without sediment, and carbonation appeared to be active. The nose gives bright and sweet nectary, citric, and earthy hop varietals sitting against a powdery base of toasty pales, yeasty metallics, buttery warmth, and bittered straw. To balance is fresh tangerine and apricot fruitiness, sidewalk chalkiness, floral honey, peppery spice, sourdough breadiness, and lightly crisp toastiness. Our first impression is that the blend of flavoring is great, with a solid blend of sweet, bitter, herbal, and sour all throughout. As we sip, the taste opened up with pale and chalky malts, lemon juiciness, orange flesh, honey sugars, mild phenolic clove, and powerfully citric and herbal hop spiciness. Peaking is the freshness of those dripping wet juicy hops, peppery spice, toasted breadiness, gritty earthiness, vegetal minerals, buttery toast, and soured yeast twang. The finish is awash with malty base, with soured doughiness, juicy bubblegum esters, dried apricots, foamy mustiness, shaved lemon rind, spicy herbal hoppiness, flashes of white sugar, cornmeal, and light herbal mintiness. The aftertaste breathes of resiny greenness, coiny metallics, chalky yeast, orange rind, lemony citric hops, fusel booziness, light plastics, clovey and black pepper spice, and white rice dryness. The body is medium and somewhat syrupy, and the carbonation is medium to high, with frothiness coating the mouth. The palate is left with lighter astringency and pucker, with resiny slowness. Each sip gives nice slurp, smack, cream, and froth, with particularly notable finishing pop. The abv is appropriate, and the beer swills easily.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its blend through the flavoring. Every mouthful showcased a beautiful collaboration of solid sweetness of fruit, brightly citric and deeply spicy herbal hoppiness, and a clean, crisp malty backbone. You would get sugars here, sours there, earths way over there, and freshness everywhere. You were given consistency of quality, but with refreshing “newness” with each gulp. The nose was pleasantly fresh as well, and its best quality was its spicy hoppiness. The mouth was soft, helping ease the drinkability in spite of the more bittered and sour grassy hits of malts every now and again. This is a quintessential “third coast” IPA, giving bitterness from the west, even malty sweetness and freshness from the east, and offering a beer that would pair with just about any occasion.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,eclipse54,4.02,"Just realized I didn't have a review for this one. Pulled a bottle from the fridge and promptly poured into a tulip.  Pours a translucent gold color with roughly two fingers of foamy, pure-white head. Medeocre retention, but phenomenal lacing. The aroma is of spicy, earthen hops, pine, orange, and grapefruit. There's some wet earth and a bit of grass, as well as some subtle floral notes. Perhaps a hint of caramel malt to round things out. It tastes of lemon, grapefruit, and orange citrus up front, with spicy, almost gritty hops following suit. Some earth, grass, and even a touch of coriander appear, and a tiny amount of sweet caramel finishes it off. The mouthfeel is light (but not watery), vibrant, and bitter. It finishes clean and doesn't linger any longer than desired. Overall, this is a great, well-rounded IPA that is easy to drink and full of flavor. It does a great job of showcasing aromatic, flavoring, and bittering hops all in one, and is one I'm happy to frequent.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,lsummers,4.18,"Pours a cloudy golden slightly amber. Two finger fluffy cream colored head. Very attractive attenuation. Sticky lacing as the head slowly recedes.  Smells of some floral slightly citric and grassy hop notes. Almost like there's a touch of lavender mixed in somewhere. Slight caramel sweetness.  Taste stands out. The hops don't blow away the sweet dulce de leche malt notes. There is more of a grapefruit hop note than floral in the taste. Back end brings some of the slight lavender like floral hops.  Moderately carbonated and feels fresh and slightly sticky on the tongue.  Overall, this is a great ipa that stands apart from the crowd. I definitely will have and keep having this again.  Edit, I might be mixing lavender notes with mango. Seems odd but that was my initial thought.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bambam2517,4.64,"Sixer of 12oz. bottles, had my fourth out of the batch and I decided I was ready to review. I pick up something new each time and I'm loving this beer! Served at 45F. Should also mention I drank my first one at about 2 weeks after ""born on"", this one is a little past 4wks.  A - Bright golden body, good lacing all the way down the glass. Leaves a firm but not overdeveloped white froth. Tight sparkling carbonation.  S - This time, what I get is biscuits and honey. Other times, it has been apricot and mango, grapefruit and a hint of caramel. Each time, it has been top notch.  T - Backs up everything in the nose, outstanding complexity and achieves a balance between the flavor, the hoppiness and the yeast I could not find any hold to pick at. Perfect in that respect.  M - Impressed by the level of sweetness in this one, begins with a rush of soft sweet flavors and builds up to an enjoyable puckering bitter on the back palate. Finishes mildy though and leaves room for more.  O - Great, more than I expected, love eating my words when they are ""lets see if this beer can really live up to the hype.""

It pours golden brown, 1/2 finger head which leaves pretty quickly. I didn't get anything immediately noticeable on the smell. A little bit of sweet, malty bread, some floral hops. I get a tiny bit of bitterness and mild carbonation. It's pretty smooth, slight graprefruit, oranges, a tiny bit of pine.  Overall it's an extremely solid IPA. Very drinkable and the 7% fly's under the radar.

287,1093,hopsputin,4.42,"a: hazy golden amber, almost yellow. 2 finger rocky white head.  s: wow - strong aroma, i'm smelling this as soon as i pour. tonsss of juicy pineapple. sweet malt and bread. aroma ends with passionfruit, grapefruit, toffee. so much sweet tropical fruit with a nice malt presence.  t: the first sip was a little bit of a let down. the second really allows for the flavors to sit in. honestly, there is very little (if any) bitterness here - which i really dig. caramel and toffee malts are the first thing you taste. you're then hit with peach, pineapple, and grapefruit. there is a large dank earthiness. ends with a faint pine/syrup flavor.  o: had been looking forward to trying this for a while (since the last time i passed it up). a little let down that the tropical fruit flavor wasn't as strong or sweet BUT this is still a really good beer. if you're like me and enjoy the maltier pale ales/IPAs then definitely give this one a try, your palate will thank you.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Bosoxfan20,4.06,"A- Pours a golden/copper with an off-white head that lingers for quite a while. Sticky lacing.  S- Normally I have a tough time picking up on the smell of my beer when I drink at a bar. The smell of smoke and food generally mask the beer's aroma. That is certainly not the case here! This beer has a huge floral hop aroma and a wonderful bready malt base.  T- Follows nose wonderfully. One of the more floral hoppy beers I can remember. Some juicy tropical flavors and citrus also comes through, all riding on a delicious bready malt backbone. Not overly bitter as I suspect this one has a lower IBU than most of the style. Powdery yeast also comes through. Well balanced.  M- Very drinkable. Mid body. No alcohol detected. Light carbonation  O- Simply delicious. A little different take on the IPA as it packs a solid hop punch, but doesn't pound you to death with nothing but hops and massive bitterness. Certainly a must try if wanting a balanced IPA",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,REVZEB,4.42,"LOVE this one on tap. Especially in the warmer midwestern months. (So spring everywhere else). From the bottle it is good, but does not seem to capture the same magic. The toffee and yeast breadiness flavors go well with the sharp hops. Add the light citrus and pine elements to just sip and enjoy. A classic that helped get me into craft beer",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,punky796,3.62,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  A - Pours a cloudy honey-yellow, with about two fingers of white head. Lacing is respectable. Looks pretty much just like Oberon, but a quarter-shade darker.  S - Smells like an IPA. Dirt, grass, pine needles, hops beyond belief. This gets old after awhile. Citrus, I guess.  T - Tastes like an IPA. Basically all that stuff mentioned above, yet this particular one seems to have a little malt presence. Lo and behold, we have a somewhat unique IPA.  M - Thanks to the malt, it's actually pretty smooth for the style. Not as much carbonation though, so it's not quite so dry on your tongue. But overall, it still is.  O - Another case where I'm just not a fan of the IPA style, but I can tell it's a good one. If you like IPAs you'll love Two-Hearted Ale.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Auraan,4.39,"Poured a nice cloudy amber color, with very little head. Standard IPA appearance but quite well done. Scents of malt, slight pine and slight citrus. Flavors are a nice balance of pine, pine resin, slight floral notes and very, very slight grapefruit and grapefruit pith. There is a strong malt backbone as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a resinous feel and moderate carbonation. It's a very good IPA, with a character different from the West Coast style I am used to, which makes it a nice change.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,magictacosinus,4.84,"At last, Bell's Two Hearted Ale! Had this on tap at Hopleaf in Chicago, where apparently the relationship between this beer and that bar is about as institutionalized as Pliny is with Toronado Pub in SF. Served in a shaker pint glass. Review is from my notes.  Pours a gold amber clear color immediately reminds me of everything I love in IPAs. Shines beautifully in the light, completed with a cascading, massive amount of carbonation that rises to the top thanks to the Hopleaf's very own pint glasses with nucleation points (which I noticed later)! A a result, there's a half finger of head that lasts on this beer the entire time, and makes this instant eye candy. Tons of lacing stick to the glass, and every swirl further reveals this beer's oily, resinous nature that I wish were more common than not in these types of hoppy beers. Excellent stuff.  The aroma is filled with all kinds of fruity varieties that I love, ranging from bittered oranges, mangos, pineapple, and grapefruit, for starters. I'm loving the particularly earthy flavor that this beer has going for it right from the start, which is presented in the malts in a slightly sweetened, caramel-toffee combo, and within the delightfully mineral-y and integrated hop oil phenols. Slight graininess, and a kiss of alcohol that adds extra balance to the beer. I think I was whiffing at this like a total dork the entire time that I was consuming this. It's so porous and dank - yet not in an exaggerated but rather soothing manner.  The flavor is fantastic. Not only does get all of the fruity flavors in various separate stages of consumption - rather than lumping them all together in one giant, dank bouquet - but it contains an earthy, nearly rustic feel that's as great as any fresh homebrew. Oranges, mangos, pineapple, lemon, a smidgen of pine, and little bit of other dried citrus rinds mixed with some faded grassy texture. Very earthy, but in a way where you get the core of the hop flavors from the vine all the way to the soil it came from. Other than Zombie Dust and occasionally with Pliny, I've never had a hoppy beer other than this one that does it this well. Everything is well integrated, and when the hops are all said and done, you're left with a clean, hearty, slightly syrupy but never too sweet finish of grains and slight breadiness that works so well. The astringency is never too grating, and, in fact, drinking this every few minutes allows the resin to settle on the palate and bring forth more of those mineral and earthy properties.  Wow! Everyone that's ever raved about this beer was right about it's greatness. I wish I could have brought six packs of this home. I really don't need to finish with a huge closing statement about this beer. As someone who's just started homebrewing and a huge fan of hops when they're pervasive in a beer but not grating, and also with beers that strive to find so much balance and use such fresh ingredients - which many brewers fail to do with IPAs - this really is one of the hop masterpieces of this country. I hate to add so much to the hype, but find fresh batches of this and drink it on tap whenever you have the chance. If always this consistent, this is probably the best IPA brewed year-round in the country. And with that, I leave myself in mountains of hops and joy. My favorite beer I had on my trip to Chicago. One of my new favorite beers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Hendry,4.53,"There is a lot of mention on the BA site about Bell's, both Hopslam and Two Hearted Ale are names that appear often. Thanks to Bunzilla, who packs a porch crushing box, hooked me up right!  Light copper color with a 1 finger head,nicely effervescent without being aggressive. Impressive lacing and a white cap that stays put.  The nose is one of subtlety: hops are apparent,sort of a lemon tinged aroma in there with some grassy pine notes along with a slight bit of malt.  Taste is also subtle, not necessarily following the nose however the lemony tones are in there and it is a crisp IPA for certain. Light to medium bodied without feeling or tasting watery, this one goes down the hatch very easily, leaving a slight bitterness that is pleasant.  Not a hop bomb, not a malt bomb: the end result is a nicely balanced IPA without any booziness. There is a subtleness to Two Hearted Ale that makes it very palatable and a smooth, easy one to drink. Definitely recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,trxxpaxxs,4.44,"A: Pours a translucent gold with one full finger of pure white head. The foam takes a bit to settle and there is a decent amount of lacing left on the glass as it drinks.  S: The nose is light malt and a good helping of pine an citrus. I get a lot of orange and lemon and a good bit of pine. Nothing too crazy in the nose, here. It smells juicy and inviting.  T: It starts out sweet and covers the palate. The hops take charge in the middle where I get pine first and then some great orange and citrus notes a bit later. As it moves to the back end, I get more grapefruit type hops and a bit of yeast.  M: Medium bodied beer. It starts out wet, tightens up in the middle, and finishes slightly drying that to the carbonation. The grapefruit really intensifies after the beer is gone. With that being said, nothing is too intense. The balance of malt is hops is great. Super drinkable.  O: Wonderful beer. It's spot on for the style, and I love drinking this beer whenever I get the chance.

The hop flavor is very prominant leaving a bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, even silky and full bodied.  Overall: I am not a huge fan of IPA's in general so I tried to be unbiased in my review.

Great finger of retention and great, thick lace rings. Beautiful.  S - Lovely grapefruit, pineapple, lime, citrus, crackery malt aroma. Not pungent, but nice.  T - Good hop again. Orange, floral. Less citrus and aggressive than aroma. Less abrasive than West Coast takes on the style. Very pleasant floral and orange flavour. Nice stuff. Balanced well and the floral hop flavour is nice.

This beer as far as taste is concerned which in my opinion is the most important propery of all beers...incredible.  Mouth: a nice bubble texture obviously consisting of an almost heavy carbonation.

A great malty front precedes a hoppy bite. The sweet, malted backbone balances well with this citrusy hops in the finish. Goes from malty sweet to bitter, citrusy hops, then back to the malted sweetness. Very well rounded brew.  MF-Damn smooth for an IPA. I'm very impressed.

287,1093,orcsinspace,3.89,"My second beer from Bell's, and this one is much better. I did like it, but whoever gave this beer a 95 rating at BA needs to stop drinking on the job. It is a good beer, but just like with the other beer I had from Bell's, there are too many on the market where I live that shame this one, and shame it hard. Beer is becoming like indie rock was 15 years ago--the more obscure, the better people will think it is.  The head was nice on this, and the color was a rich, typical IPA color. Very standard. There was some nice lacing down the glass, but nothing like you'd get from a Ranger, or a Torpedo.  The smell was very standard, and if you have ever had an IPA before, imagine that. This one is more piney than citrusy, so I do like that.  The taste was also very standard, and again, more pine. It tasted fairly fresh, and had a nice bitter bite to it.  Overall, a decent beer, but where I live this beer rings in at nearly 12 bucks for six at the grocery. This beer is overrated, and while it is good, I just can't justify spending that much on a six pack.  Bell's is middle of the pack for me, and I have to admit that I am let down.

S: Very floral, citrus peel, faint pineapple fruit.  T: An excellent blend of flavors - floral, grapefruit and orange peel, orange fruit, mellow pineapple, earthy, faint yeast. Soft bitterness and a highly balancing biscuit and dough pale malt presence.  M: Pretty light, but not watery. Being a little on the thin side makes it go down very easy, so I don't have a problem with it, I would just typically expect a bit more body from a beer of this ABV.  O: A very good IPA that I think has reigned supreme in Michigan for a long time, although I think it has been passed in recently by a number of offerings from Short's. For the price though, Two Hearted is damn tough to beat. I will also add that I think Two Hearted on-tap beats it from the bottle by a noticeable margin.

Unusually light copper color for an IPA and a bit cloudy, head a bit thin  Pleasing floral aroma  On the lower end of hoppy for an IPA, light enough to taste some complexity in the hops, leads with a flavor more like a Marzen, but finishes like an IPA  Feel is typical for IPA  Overall a nice change of pace if you get bored with the standard IPA fare.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,ThomasAWilson2,4.58,"As a word of warning, I have not always been the biggest of IPA drinkers. Over the past year or so I have gravitated towards dark beers with a lager or two sprinkled in, but with my shift further north I have decided to expand my palate a bit and give the bitter side of the family a solid few months of effort. That being said, Bell's Two Hearted Ale may be my favorite IPA of my limited experience. Its very floral hop forward with a strong citrus backbone.  One thing that seems to be common practice is the introduction of bittering agents. This one is much less bitter than something with such a strong hop infused flavor. Huge carbonation which helps to usher in that freshness factor IPA drinkers cherish so much. Nice sunflower color, poured a half finger head. Floral and grapefruit aroma. A little tropical fruit in there, maybe some mango? Smells sticky sweet and acidic. Deceptively pungent in the flavor department, almost saison-esque with the amount of flavor this little number packs in. Nice alcoholic burn in the aftertaste, wait for a second after the swallow and it creeps in.  Did I mention I love this IPA? Seriously, between this and Ten Fidy there isn't much room in my favorite unhyped not-limited beers club. Didn't have to fight to buy some and the price is right on target.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,kevanb,4.02,"12oz bottle poured into a Bells tulip.  The beer pours a very clear golden copper color, just a few bubbles rising up to the top of the glass, with a soft, cloudy white head, about 2 fingers high that has good retention and leaves behind a nice amount of spotted lace. The aroma is very pleasant, subtle piney hops, light grapefruit with touches of wildflower before pale grain and a touch of caramel malt sweetness eases out. The hops are more impactful on the tongue, lots of sweet tangerine, zesty grapefruit, smooth but bitter resinous pine, lightly floral with some smooth, sweet malt at the finish to help balance the bitter hops. The body is really nice, very smooth, almost juicy with a perfect level of lively carbonation and a lightly dry, lightly sweet finish.  Verdict: Two Hearted never fails to be an enjoyable IPA and is certainly one of the benchmarks for the style. Balanced, not overly complex yet certainly not simple, very smooth with a soft finish that doesn't push any boundaries and remains extremely quaffable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,yottachem,4.4,"Sampled in tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours gold-honey in color with orange highlights with mousse-like, eggshell white head that persists for a few minutes. Head collapses after a few mins to a light ring around edge of glass. Pour is slightly hazy.  Aroma: Light malt sweetness; reminiscent of caramel. Hop aroma is spicy/herbal, but otherwise a little light. Upon warming, grassy and alcohol notes come forward.  Flavor: Caramel sweetness in a firm malt backbone. Not overly bitter at first, but as palate develops a nice crisp bitterness develops. This fades to a lingering bitter finish. Hop profile is much more bright at first sip, and evolves to a more ""dark green"" or piney/earthy hop flavor.  Mouthfeel: Light mouthfeel. Surprisingly light for a 7% ABV. Light carbonation allows malt to come through a bit more, but leaves a light slickness on the tongue from the residual bitterness.  Overall: Smooth drinker. Light carb is refreshing. Percived bitterness develops as bottle is consumed, but still seems a little light for a IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,barczar,4.06,"Pours a clear copper with a frothy half inch cream head that slowly dissipates, leaving spotty lacing.  Resin, grapefruit, and bready caramel malt sweetness dominate the aroma initially. Hints of onion, fresh cut grass, and cattiness add complexity.  Flavor is, at first, somewhat sweet, with caramel malt serving as a nice backdrop for muted grapefruit and strong resin. The finish is moderately bitter. Notes of pine emerge as it warms, and the citrus character strengthens.  Body is moderately full and slightly creamy, with moderate carbonation, slight astringency, and notable alcohol warmth.  Certainly not the most complex hop character, but a good amount of malt to stand up to the hops without overwhelming, and not overly bitter.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Roman5150,4.95,"May be a little biased, went to school in Kalamazoo, MI for 4 years, drinking this on draft was a regular every weekend thing for me; As were six packs as fresh as you could possibly get them. Regardless, I am reviewing this currently living in Tennessee, drove to Kentucky to purchase this, 3 months old. Oh yea, out of a bottle too. But guess what, it tastes the same regardless of what you dirnk this out of. Draft, bottle, glass, this is a world class beer. I'm sure it wold taste amazing out of a can as well.  Not usually a fan of IPAs, I have been savoring this beer since before I even knew what an IPA was. My first experience was in probably 9th grade, when you don't really have a taste for what a ""beer"" should taste like. My friend took one from his dad's sixpack in the garage, cold as hell, and I remember saying the exact words ""holy shit"".  It looks like an IPA should, somewhat cloudy with an orange-ish appearance. Not much of a head, although I usually get much more when I have it on draft.  Smells very piney, citrusy, sort of a hint of a west coast IPA with that sort of clove.citrus aspect of a hefeweizen, a pretty uniqie smell for an IPA.  Tastes like no other beer out there. By far the most balanced IPA i've had. I've given this to my parents, who don't drink craft beer, and don't like those ""heavy ipa's"".... They said ""wow, i'm gonna have to start buying this"". And ever since then, i've often had to refrain from draining the Two-Hearted stash in my parents fridge whenever I'm home to Michigan to visit. So smooth, and easy drinking, for a 7% abv it tastes like 5.5-6, it just goes down smooth. The centennial hops in this beer really show through. I prefer this to Founders Centennial IPA, in contrast to a lot of my friends, as I find it a tad too malty.  Overall: This one is just perfect, everything is so well constructed that words can't really describe the craftmanship of this beer. Larry Bell did an amazing job with this one and that's why it's Bell's flagship beer. If I were to reccomend one beer from my home state to the rest of the world, this would be it (followed closely by Bells Hopslam).  Being an avid fisherman, I usually pair this with Salmon or Steelhead, and it blows me away how well they work together. I'm not sure if the fish on the bottle, or the reference to the U.P river had a subconscious bias on me, but this is my go to beer for any for of meat or fish dinner (Dogfishhead 90 min IPA also pairs very well with Salmon). Cheeses that go well with this are basically any strong cheese, Limburger if you're man enough, and i've found that any dutch Gouda cheese pairs rather well.  A cool little story: A few years ago a few buddies of mine were backpacking Isle Royale (Island in Lake Superior, Northern Michigan) and we met 2 guys from Germany who came to canoe the island. The only store on the island, which included a mini restaraunt, just happened to stock only bells beer, and a huge selection of it. We met them in a campground near the lodge and they had just bought a case of Oberon and 2 six packs of Two-Hearted. Their english wasn't very good, but they basically said that American beer is shit compared to Germany (and grudgingly Belgium), except that Two-Hearted and Oberon (probably due to Germans fondness for wheat beer) are both some of there favorite beers, ever. I thought that was pretty cool, Germans having mad respect for some local MIchigan Craft Brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,BradtheGreat7,4.34,"Review taken from notes(mid March 2013)  12 oz brown bottle with a fantastic label of a fish what I'm calling a trout with a hook close by. Makes me instantly want warm spring weather. Great label! Poured this into a nonic style pint glass.  A - Amberish orange to amberish golden. Very beautiful color. Head sits with a frothy style and subdues to a nice splotchy ring of lace providing pretty good stick.  S - Floral aroma with Flashes of citrusy and resinous hop character. Good biscuity yeast whiffs in the background while the malt steadiness does it's part in balancing the aroma.  T - A shot of oranges. Somewhat sweet and juicy with the citrus character very much present. Floral and Citrusy hops collide with a wall of biscuit malt and a slap of fantastic yeast flavors conspire before the bitterness has even a chance to hit full force. The balance is deservingly bragged upon. Finish is neat and balanced with a creamy finish.  M - balance is everything in this IPA. Medium-full bodied but thick and smooth. Creative and complex, but balanced on scales most people wouldn't dream of knowing to exsist. Its not the perfect mouthfeel, but damn is it working class and done right. A very easy drinking IPA.  O - west coast ipa's punch you in the mouth with a big hop profile and an ibu # through the roof. English styles give you a dose of malt and settle for less than what a hop head really needs. It seems to me some of these real good Midwestern/Great Lakes area breweries knock it out of the park when talking a sit down and drink, everyday IPA. This one is a prime example of what this specific region does better than anyone and it's a hallmark creation of what Bell's does best. Anyone looking for that go to IpA when say the next BIG seasonal hasnt quite hit the shelves then this is the one. Plus there is a freaking fish about to be slayed by some Midwesternman after a hard days work. No he's not shown, but you can imagine. This is one fish everyone needs to catch. It's good stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,zrbeer1579,3.33,"Just recently had this on tap. It was much better. there was a stranger taste, though. Not as bitter as it was before. It's a good IPA, but nothing incredibly significant. 02-7-2014 Score: 3.8  Below is older review: 03-26-2013  Appearance: Transparent golden orange with a one finger creamy white head  Aroma: Floral, grapefruit, tangerine, and a slight pine.  Taste: Bitter pine and grapefruit; in a bad way. Some tangerine. A very faint sweetness and breadiness. Flavors seem a little watered down. And too much bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light. Crisp. Bitterness in the finish is a little too aggressive.  Overall: I was not too impressed with this IPA. It smells good but taste didn't do it for me. It may have something to do with the bottle being two months old. When I get a much fresher bottle, I'll edit my review. That is, if it's any better.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Maxwell,4.09,"The beer pours a golden orange, with a finger width head made of small tightly packed bubbles. The beer leaves a lacing of tightly packed bubbles that form a sticky curtain on the sides of the glass. The beer’s body is a cloudy haze, and a steady stream of bubbles can be seen racing up the glass. On the nose, the beer smells pungently citrusy with nice spicy notes of pine. The malt base of the beer is light and bready with a touch of spice, but nearly nonexistent on the nose. Orange peel citrus is the big player in the nose, and is nicely inviting. On the tongue the beer tastes bitter with a touch of sweet acidity. In flavor, the beer tastes of bitter medicinal hops with touches of citrus orange peel. The finish is strong with caramel bready malts with touches of spice. The aftertaste lingers with bitter hops and light orange citrus. On the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a light velvety carbonation. The mouth is left clean with a bitter dryness lingering on the tongue. Overall this is a solid IPA with some nice orange citrus hops. It is not the best I’ve had, but it is solid and tasty.

The aroma on this beer is very citrusy with great big notes of apricot and lemon. I'm also getting a honey sweetness in there. One of the better smelling single IPA's out there.  This beer is super sweet right up front, then bitter on its way down. The citrus is really the focal point in the taste. Very refreshing. This is a beer that is good all year long. If its hot, cold, or somewhere in between I could always go for one of these. It is medium in bodied but still light enough to have a couple or more.

287,1093,LambicPentameter,4,"Been feeling inspired to get back into reviewing with the new change to how scores are calculated. What better one to kick it off with a reknowned beer from my new home state. Enjoyed out of a 12 oz bottle that was picked up at the General Store in Kalamazoo--bottling date of 6/27/15. Poured into a fancy Speigelau IPA glass for maximum IPA-ness.  Appearance (4.0) - Pours a hazy tangelo orange with the body up in the bulb of the glass being darker and more opaque than the lighter orange rind color of the smaller base. Yellowish highlights rest at the bottom where teh light passes through the glass. Atop the body sits a finger and a half of frothy, bright white foam. Retention is moderate before fading away to leave just a spot of lace here and there on the glass--not much residue at all.  Smell (4.0) - Initially I get some bright notes of stone fruit and tropical, maybe nectarine and mango, but not as sweet. On second and third times sticking my nose down in the glass, I get faint herbal notes and the grain base makes itself known, but gently. Nothing individually jumps out in this beer, with all the players melding together in a nice blend. A part of me wishes something in here was a little more aggressive, but the harmony makes for a very easy-to-drink beer.  Taste (4.0) - Much like the aroma, the flavors contained here all blend very well together, making for a slightly different impression with each swallow. The same notes of fruit are present, with an additional depth coming from some floral notes. Peach, mango, and light bready sweetness all make an appearance, and there is a slight bite from the alcohol, but nothing unpleasant or overpowering--just some minor astringency.  Mouthfeel (4.0) - Medium body with carbonation on the low side of moderate. Finish is mostly dry with just a hint of sweetness on the tongue.  Overall (4.0) a very well-done beer that has stood the test of time for good reason. Something I never find myself going out of my way to get, but always a great backup option if I can't decide on something else because I know what to expect and that I will be satisfied once the beer is gone.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Good initial mouth-feel, carbonation is just right. But then...  I am really puzzled by this tasting. With all the stellar reviews and past experience with Oberon, I was very much looking forward to this. Frankly, it makes me think of drinking Christmas tree water.

This reviews concerns Two Hearted on tap at Acme Beer and Pizza in Rochester, NY.  Pours a hazy glowing orange yellow. 1 inch head with great lacing.  A big trifecta of great hop aromas- pine, citrus, floral.  The tastes follows similarly, and successfully. Very floral up front, with some sweet citrus flavors mixed with bitter pine notes. The bitterness is lingering but not over-powering. Not much noticeable malt flavor. One of the freshest hop expressions on the market.  Light, crisp mouthfeel, light-to-medium body.

287,1093,TheQuietMan22,3.78,"Serving type: 12-ounce bottle. The bottling date, “02/06/13,” is printed on the back label.  Appearance: Straight pour into a pint glass. The color is gold that is leaning amber. A finger and a half of off-white head left a skim of foam, a ring around the edge, and trails of foam along the side.  Smell: Pretty tame, especially since “intense hop aroma” is used on the beer’s webpage. The grapefruit and pine resin are present and pretty sharp, but they are not overpowering and intense; I need to put my nose right up to the glass to sense them. Other aromas are pale malts, bready wheat, floral hops, and a little toffee.  Taste: This one is hard to pin down. The bitterness is unmistakable and dominant; the floral hops really excite the taste buds. A blend of floral hops, grapefruit, pine resin, and pale malts is noticeable, but not enough to provide balance. Hints of alcohol emerge, but they are fleeting.  Drinkability: “Enormous” and “intense” are not the right words for this beer.

287,1093,LCB_Hostage,2.6,"Bell's distribution where I live is really spotty, even for something as ubiquitous as Two Hearted, so when I saw a six at my local bottle shop, I snapped it up eager to see what all the fuss was about.  Served from a bottle into a pint glass. Per the label, it was bottled 1-28-13.  A: More golden than orange. 1-finger, fast fading head. Some lacing, but not much.  S: A bit of piney resin straight from the bottle, but once in the glass, nothing, nada, zilch. Honestly, I can't remember the last time I poured a beer with so little nose.  T: Quite a bit maltier than I expected. Smooth with little hop character. What hops there were left a slightly bitter aftertaste that faded quickly.  M: Probably the best aspect of this beer IMO. Smooth, somewhat creamy/silky with just enough of an astringent finish to wake up the tongue.  O: I know this is the quintessential go-to beer for a lot of BAs here, but I just don't get it. I think part of it is that it's classified as an IPA, but I found it much too timid to earn that title. If it were labeled as an APA, I'd probably rate it quite a bit higher. I can't say this isn't a ""good"" beer and very well made, but it didn't really impress. It did drink smoothly and if the ABV were quite a bit lower, it would make a nice session beer, but it really didn't live up to my expectations for an IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Mouthfeel: Nice and balanced but could be a bit fuller.  Overall: A classic IPA that is really unlike anything else.

287,1093,Dave_in_GR,4.63,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a yellowish-orange with minimal head.  Smell is citrus, but is very mild. Definitely not an overwhelming blast of hops.  Tastes just like it smells, mostly citrus but the flavors are much more subtle than in many IPAs. Not even a hint of the 7% alcohol, and very refreshing.  Mouthfeel is remarkably smooth for an IPA, not nearly as bitter as you might expect - a small amount of carbonation accents the medium body nicely, and without any lingering astringency.  Overall, this is one of the standout IPAs from west Michigan. To me, it seems a bit more similar to east coast IPAs like Dogfish Head's 60 and 90 minute varieties, and is a nice change from the over-the-top hop-bombs that are so common with this style. Smooth mouthfeel and subtle flavors make this an excellent IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

It has a citrus flavor overtone that comes through, however it is not too strong and nicely balanced. The has no bitterness to it and it goes down real smooth.

In conclusion Two Hearted Ale definitely warrants a 5 rating, and if you see this beer at your local beer/party store pick this up!!

287,1093,dougbassett,4.23,"One of the ""1001 Beers You Should Try Before You Die"" -- #17 of the ones I've reviewed here.  This is a wonderful beer. Pours out a very cloudy brassy yellow, with a very thin head on top that still stubbornly persists. Nose is an exceptionally pure grapefruit, paired maybe with a bit of creamy lemon, like maybe the filling of a very good lemon tart or something.  Very creamy lemon flavors, with maybe a little grapefruit riding on top of that. I would've preferred a bit more assertiveness here but that's just me. A nice, crisp, hoppy finish to the whole thing with a bit of grapefruit peel at the end here, too, but mind, nothing sharp here either. Like this through and through is an exercise in smoothness and body, more than anything else. I gave the mouthfeel the highest score here because that's where I think the focus was on. There's real body and heft here and it compliments the flavor profile wonderfully.  A remarkable beer, a way to show how to make an assertive American IPA without bombarding you with hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Groomsy,4.43,"12 oz. bottle poured into a nonic. Bottled on 12/18/12.  A thin, eggshell head sits on top of a clear, honey-orange body on the classic American IPA. I left the yeast out, so there isn't a lot of haze in this beer. Occasional carbonation bubbles go to the top of this beer, which leaves sheets and rings of lacing down the glass.  The nose contains many of the citrus characteristics central to the American IPA (grapefruit, namely), but the bitterness takes a backseat to tropical fruit sweetness and subtle floral scents. I especially thought of mango, oranges and pineapple with some candied grapefruit. There's just enough bready/biscuity malt to back up all of the hops. While not a ""typical"" American IPA, and a little mild on the nose, this has a great aroma.  There's a big, juicy bitterness on the front of the tongue - this is where the grapefruit/citrus character really comes full force. The malt comes in on the middle of the palate to cut the bitterness before being washed away by a drying, piney and fruity presence of hops on the finish. The flavors don't linger too long, and this beer has supreme refreshment factor. A beautifully balanced and harmonious IPA. It doesn't have the ""punch"" factor like most, but it is a great beer with nuance and subtlety.  The mouthfeel of this beer, thanks to bottle conditioning, is fantastic. It slides across the tongue with a silky smoothness and has no harshness. Fruity flavors linger long into the finish without overstaying their welcome. Softly carbonated, medium bodied, and refreshing, with a slightly dry finish.  While not a bitter or brash IPA as many would expect, this is a classic. Its sweetness puts it in a league of its own, I think. Absolutely worth checking out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,smcolw,4,"Modest head, but it leaves a near blanket of lace on the glass. The liquid is cloudy with an orange hued dirty copper color.  Very mild smell for the style. Pale grain nose is stronger than the floral hop. Well balanced but meek.  The hop is fresh tasting, providing a black pepper finish. Starts with a clean ""round"" pale malted barley flavor. Only a touch of sweetness. Full bodied and a below average level of carbonation.

A- Light orange color, slightly transparent with a thin, white foam head S- Strong Hoppy smell, with slight fruit accent and an undertone of malt T- Strong initial hop taste, mixed with a fruity and bitter aftertaste M- Slight carbonation, very smooth, not too overpowering  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer.

A little pine and some grains. Best part of the beer.  T: Bitter pine hops, some citrus, little malts  M: Medium bodied, low carbonation, hoppy aftertaste. Goes done nice.  O: I was expecting a bit more from Bell’s since the reviews are through the roof on this. The smell is off the hook but the taste is average.

A- Pours a clear honey body with a 2"" white head that reduces quickly to a white ring and leaves little lacing.  S- Caramel malt, honey, citrus rind, pine, kind of spicy like a rye.  T- Sugar cookies, honey, lemon zest upfront. Peppery, spicy hops on the finish. Aftertaste is bittersweet. Raw  M- Medium-low carbonation, medium body.  A decent IPA, nothing special in my opinion though. Nonetheless, an easy drinker with good balance. Sweet for an IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

M- Clean on the finish, very drinkable.  O- This is a great beer. I could imagine serving this at a bar-b-que or a party. It seems to appeal to a lot of people and its not too overwhelming of an IPA. My wife also enjoys this one. For such a drinkable beer the 7% ABV is surprising and can sneak up on you!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Mebuzzard,4.38,"This best part of this beer is its balance, followed closely by the flavors.  Grapefruit, citrus, some bubblegum, earthy spice and a solid malt backbone show why this beer is highly rated. A bit resinous for me, and for a single IPA, but I won't dock it too many points for that just b/c maybe it really is a dIPA.  With all that said, one glass is about all I can muster here. It ain't sessionable or quaffable, but it's darn fine. I'd almost like to have it with some spicy Indian food just to see how the sweetness holds up",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Very clear S: Smells like a subtle citrus bomb, if that makes any sense, first hit with citrus, left with earthy hops T: Great citrus taste, fair malt taste, to be followed up by a clean bitterness M: Acually tasted thin...which is too bad considering this is a supposed legend if IPAs. Don't get me wrong, it was quite tasty, but it left me thinking there was a bit of water in the glass before pouring. I need to try it against other IPAs side-by-side.

287,1093,kell50,4.31,"12oz bottle poured into my Southern Tier glass. Two Hearted is one of my favorites and a truly excellent example of an American IPA.  A: Pale yellow, orange hue with a slight haze. Poured vigorously which created a 2 finger head. Nice lacing here as well.  S: Floral hop aroma. Citrus juice, grassy, pine as well as biscuity malt.  T: This is an amazing IPA. Grapefruit, orange zest, slight pine. Great balance of hops and malt. Certainly a true representation of an American IPA. Hop forward, but it has such a tremendous balance.  M: Medium bodied, with tight compact carbonation that seem to explode with hop resin.  O: The alcohol at 7% abv is hardly noticeable, as it just goes down so smooth. This beer is world-class for a reason and it's a 6 pack that's enjoyable time after time.

Aroma is dominant hops, like when I open a package to add to my homebrews. Taste is a nice blend and balance of hops & citrus without either being over dominant.

S- Pungent citrus hops. Just what you look for in an IPA. It's a little earthy, a little herbal, and just faintly spicy. a malt sweetness lingers behind the hops, but it's there if you look for it.  T- The hops come up first, almost lighting your mouth on fire at first, but then give way to the malt sweetness. It's balanced, then leaning hop forward with citrus, earth, and spicy notes. It's refreshing though. It quenches your thirst and let's the wonderful combination of hops linger for a pleasant aftertaste. It's semi-dry.  M- It's easy, medium bodied, medium carbonation, and not too dry. Very pleasant drinker overall.  O- Great beer. This could be my favorite IPA. It's aggressive and hoppy, yet drinkable and balanced. This is what an American IPA should be, given the stylistic description and my personal opinion. I should keep a case of this around just to keep my taste buds used to it. Great for those days when work sucked and you need a beer to punch you in the face, yet keeps you coming back for more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Well this is one of those beers that I have had so many times that there is always at least a 6 in the fridge.  If you want a beer that showcases hop flavor over hop bitterness then go out and get this. One of the better IPAs out there that is for sure  Edit...

A really nice amber color, with a medium head, it's not over-the-top in its hop bitterness like some craft IPAs. Citrus to the nose, particularly grapefruit (and to be fair, another favorite is Ballast Point's Grapefruit Sculpin), and the taste follows the aroma.

Foamy head, short retention and some lacing.  S- Floral hops and bread like malt. Very different from a West Coast IPA. Also some fruit and funk in the background.  T- Moderate hop bitterness followed by an herbal sweetness and then malt in quick succession.  M- Moderate carbonation lends a nice fullness. For an 8% ABV beer, the alcohol is well balanced and difuse.  O- This one lives up to the reputation. Very hoppy but with an entirely different profile from the IPA's I live with in CA.

287,1093,Sethzilla,4.08,"First Review!  Poured in to a standard pint glass.  A: Proper pour produces a tight inch-thick head that sticks around for a while. The beer has a burnt orange color.  S: Notes of cotton candy, sweet fruit; tangerine and mango. Slight astringency in the nose as well.  T: Quite tasty! Pine notes and more tangerine/mango. There is a clean bitterness, bready malt profile and just the slightest bit of astringency.  M: Coats the mouth nicely, but the carbonation helps dry it up a little. Refreshing, and leaves me ready for the next sip! Has a certain 'juicy' quality.  O: I really enjoy this beer. Overall it is really well balanced -- the piney/floral/fruity character is held up by the malt.

In my opinion this is a perfectly balanced beer.  M - This is the part of there beer that I think really sets it apart. It has a nice smooth almost creamy mouthfeel. Makes me want to keep sipping it.  Overall - This beer is just a delight. There aren't many negatives for me to throw out on this one. There is a little to be desired in aroma but still on par.

287,1093,rangerred,4.24,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours an almost clear deep orange with just a little bit of sediment winding up in the glass. One finger head slowly fades into a nice fluffy cap over the beer.  Big hoppy aroma that leans more towards pine rather than fruit. There is some orange and pineapple but this one steers away from the super tropical. Real nice bready malt notes underneath giving the aroma a great balance.  Lots of pine and earth upon tasting with hardly a hint of fruit. Quite assertive maltyness too lending an really nice balance. Strong bitterness throughout but very appropriate for the style. For not being strong on fruity hops, the beer has a real ""juicy"" character that is refreshing. Mouthfeel is full but a little too sticky for my liking.  Overall, a very nicely balanced IPA and one of the better ones that is widely available. Not Earth-shattering by any means but one to definitely enjoy regularly.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

All the resinous, oily hop bitterness a hop lover desires, enough malt backbone to balance. Clean, pronounced flavors. Moderate carbonation bitterness makes refreshing.  O: Someone got their Centennial hops back! For the past year Two Hearted did not taste the same. Taste like their pale ale which is far below average. This IPA reminds me why I love the style, similar to Dogfish Head 60 Min in regard to how well it is balanced. Malt is more on the bready side than 60 min's caramel backbone.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Biffster,4.08,"The beer pours with a generous off white head that lingers. It is basically clear with a touch of haziness. It is a deep amber with golden and copper highlights.  The aroma has a nice intense hoppiness, but there is no doubt about the malt profile. It is toasty with a touch of brown sugar. It is fruity and not without a bit of peppery spice. The hops are piney and spicy, with some grapefruit notes.  The beer is sweet and caramelly at the sip but it quickly gives way to an intense hop flavor. The brown sugar note carries through from the aroma to the sip, which combines with some bubblegum esters to give a sweet fruity counterpoint to the hops. The beer is strongly bitter, and it has a nice lingering piney hoppiness toward the back of the palate. The finish is hoppy, but the malt and fruit makes a re-emergence at the swallow, to just counter the strongly bitter and clean finish.  The body is medium full and the carbonation is moderate to high, but it is of the creamy variety. The alcohol is not at all harsh, but it is noticeable, and it assists in drying the beer out and giving a lighter overall mouthfeel than the beer would otherwise merit.  Simply put, I love this beer. It is a tasty and approachable, yet substantial and complex example of IPA. The balance is to hops, as it should be. But there is balance. it is not a hop bomb by any means. A great effort overall.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Bowdoinbeerboy,3.76,"Got this one on a trip to a friends wedding out in Minnesota.  Poured with almost no head and only moderate lacing. Beer is a bright amber color with hints of red. Carbonation is strong.  I didn't have a proper glass to pour this one into, but the nose seems very subdued. This is definitely an IPA, but there is a strong malt backbone here as well, the nose is not overly pungent of hops, but almost a warm biscuity aroma.  This beer tastes good! From the aroma, I expected the hops in this to be fairly subdued, boy was I wrong! This beer is hoppy and hop forward. The initial flavor is of medium bitter hops and this quickly fades to a more lasting bitter hop flavor profile. The hop bitterness is well balanced with the sweeter, malt background, but this beer is truly hoppy.  Overall this beer is excellent; I only wish I could buy it back in Maine! I was suprised to find that this beer is 7% abv, the alcohol is well hidden, I certainly wouldn't have guessed that the % was this high.

Light amber color, with carbonation bubbles spread sporadically throughout. Pale yellow head stop just at the top of the glass, turned into a thin layer of foam after a few sips and left great lacing down my glass.  S - Floral hops and a bit of wet wood in the background. Not as in your face with the smell as most American IPAs.  T - Pine-needle hop bitterness right up front that is balanced pretty well by a sweet, malty after taste. One of the more balanced American IPAs I've had.  M - Light, moderate mouthfeel, that leaves a little bit of sticky sensation, still a refreshing IPA.  O - A great beer by all accounts. I prefer my American IPAs to be a bit hoppier, I'll get an English IPA if I want well balanced. Two Hearted kind of falls somewhere in the middle to me.

A - Nice orange color, a little on the watery pale side, compared so some IPA's and pale ales, but still a nice color. Absolutely no head on this, which may or may not have been my bad.  S - Hoppy grapefruit scent up front. Little bit of a burnt toasted nut or seed smell which is very distinct. Smells great, almost like it was made in a hay loft or something.  T - Again, very nice grapefruit and citrus notes, followed by that little splash of toasted seed or nut flavor. Definitely some distinctive birdseed kind of taste going on, which I have to say is enjoyable.  M - Nice resinous feel going on, the hops linger around for a minute, also.  Overall, this is a nice American IPA, but probably not my favorite. It is definitely enjoyable, but I think if I had to choose, I would pick Grand Teton's Sweetgrass APA over this beer.

287,1093,PsilohsaiBiN,3.7,"Bottled on 9/25, much thanks to Hopeswimmer for the bottle  Appearance: Golden/amber with a diesel, shaving cream-like two finger head that sticks around.  Smell: Hops, hops, hops! Wow! Fruity as hell!! Sweet mango and pineapple with citrus notes. Call me crazy, but I'm also picking up lemons soaked in sugar smell, like when I used to rip shots of Absolute Citron in high school and eat the lemon rolled in sugar after.  Taste: Good balance between malt and hops. The beginning is citrusy, then fades into a bitter finish with some malt to balance it out. To me, this is like a blend of West and East coast IPAs, which makes sense, since it comes from Michigan. It has the really floral bite early, then the bitter hop finish that the West coast style leans to, yet it has more malt than a beer like Pliny The Elder.  Mouthfeel: Not as much carbonation as I expected. Wouldn't say this is exactly a letdown, just think it would make this more drinkable, a la Pliny. The carbonation in that beer is just nuts.  Overall: Maybe I shouldn't have smelled or looked at this beer before I drank it, because those are the two things about this that impressed me most. This is a well balanced beer that is surely drinkable, yet I feel the end's lingering bitterness may throw off some East coast IPA guys. I was expecting the taste to match the smell and although that wasn't the case, this is still a good beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Spotty lacing with fair stick.  Smell - Citrus and tropical notes, mellowed pineapple, backed by an underlying toffee and bread sweetness, with just a hint of butter.  Taste - Upfront, the hops are sweet orange with a good chunk of bitter pith. Lying beneath, a solid bready malt backbone. Once warmed, traces of buttery toffee can be found mid-taste and toward the finish. Great balance. Aftertaste is pure fresh orange pith bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Light to medium body, with a fair amount of carbonation. Smooth, easy drinking; almost buttery on the swallow.  Overall - Certainly not the hoppiest IPA you'll come across, but it may be one of the more unique offerings out there. Beautiful flavor profile. Excellent balance.

287,1093,wyatt13,4.41,"""When in doubt, go with Two Hearted"" is not a bad way to go through life. I've had this one many times before, but never took the time to sit down with one and write a formal review. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  A - Pours a beautiful caramel-gold, with a towering two and a half finger head of thick foam. Slightly hazy, with some incredible lacing.  S - Smells like running through an orange orchard, I imagine. Fresh citrus with some herbal character like an evergreen or spruce tree. Grapefruit and some tropical nature as well.  T - Eminently drinkable. Bursting hops with a great malty finish, some bready character in the aftertaste. Completely balanced and satisfying.  M - Maybe just a little on the lighter side, but can't fault it for its ease of drinking.  O - Easy to see why why this is old reliable. I'm so happy that I have everyday access to this beer. It scratches an itch, that's for sure.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jtierney89,4,"On tap clear copper. Pure grapefruit on the nose with hop resin.  Tastes like clean crisp resinous grapefruit juice. Mildly carbonated big bitterness with a balanced finish. Slick mouthfeel that coats the tongue. Clean good flavors with intense drinkability. Nice big malty back bone that holds the beer and all it's flavors together into one great sip that leaves you looking for more. Had this out in chicago over the weekend and it was my first time out there, this along with some others i've had while i was out there made it clear that between english ipa's and west coast ipa's there is a legitimate midwest style ipa that is simple and delicious in it's own way. Super drinkable with simple but well blended flavors. Good reputation for a reason.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BobFV,4.24,"I really like this beer - served from a 12 ounce bottle into a six ounce glass. Light head, no lacing, dark amber color, a little bit cloudy. I would not really call this an American Ale, more like a hoppy amber, with a lot of the hop taste on the back of the tongue, very citrusy.  It is a refreshing and satisfying beer, highly recommended, and I am usually an IPA guy - this is a refreshing little break from hopbursted IPAs which are becoming so common.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,williamjbauer,4.3,"On tap served in a pint glass  A - Clear copper amber with 2 finger fluffy white head with great head retention and excellent sticky lacing  S - Crikey, the great white Centennial hops is a beauty in this bouquet starring that grapefruit stink, the love of many a hop head. Touch of floral and grassy hops and hint of booze.  T - Catch of the day is citrus hops with a side of sweet caramel malts which compliment this course quite well. This fish pairs well with the heavy citrus hops and almost perfect balance of malt and booze and a solid bitter finish.  M - Medium body, moderate carbonation, chewy.  O - One of the best of the popular IPAs in the country, Two Hearted is so well fashioned, crafted to suit almost any beer drinking occasion, I'll pick this one up just about anytime I can out of state. It was better on tap, after having it bottled, the floral and citrus hops on the nose as just a bit more pungent.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jibjib513,3.87,"Preface: I bought a six pack, and reserved reviewing this beer until after the whole lot was finished (over the course of a week).  Serving Type: Bottle to Pint glass.  Appearance (3.5): When pouring, the beer looks brownish, but in the glass it seems to be the orange-ish cloudy color I've seen any many American IPAs. The head is nice and stays throughout the drink, with nice lacing on the glass.  Smell (4.0): Smells great! though it's a simple smell to me it's what an IPA should be.  Taste (4.0): It is on the bitter side but man those hops taste good.. very fresh.  Mouthfeel (3.0): just about right.  Overall (4.0): As mentioned before, I drank a whole six pack, over the course of about a week before making a review. Only 1 of the six seemed to be a little off. All of the others tasted very fresh and ""nicely balanced"".",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

That's about all I'm getting.  T: Sweet citrus flavored hops balanced nicely with some malt. The aftertaste is a nice almost orange flavor.  M: Medium bodied with decent carbonation. About right for an IPA.  O: I'm actually pretty damn impressed with this beer. I could use a little more from the smell, but other than that it's a very solid IPA. I like it a lot.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,gentlystewed,4.7,"Poured this one into a snifter and let it sit there a minute or two while I gazed lovingly at the slightly hazy amber, orange sunshine body. The creamy off white head sunk some, but never to abandon. The lacing recorded every pull. The floral and citrus notes along with the caramel Tsunami surge up and into your schnoz, ping pong around a bit, tickling the pleasure centers deep inside your skull. As far as taste goes, all the bitterness and the typical citrus, piney, and caramel malty flavors are there and standing tall as they should in an IPA. I detect something else that blows me totally away, and that's the orange flavor dominating the after taste. It's almost like a orange creamsicle had melted into the beer beforehand. The mouthfeel is smoooth and the carbonation perfect. Overall, this will be the IPA that I measure all others by, and that might not be fair, or reasonable, but it can't be helped. The amplitude factor in this beer is beyond comprehension. There are of course other beers in this league, Centennial comes to mind, and SweetWater IPA, but not many more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Quackershnoc,4.2,"12-ounce bottle, served in a pint glass Appearance: a nice, cloudy, golden color; honey-like; thin white head that dissipates almost immediately Aroma: very nice; a bit of hops; nice citrus notes, good amount of grapefruit coming through; a few floral notes...maybe a little pine? Taste: a great beer; good amount of hop to start, but moves through to the malt; citrus notes start to come out, especially grapefruit; and then a dry, hoppy finish Mouthfeel: feels slick; great carbonation and it moves through fast if you're not careful! Overall Impression: I love this beer, it's a great IPA; the hops are present throughout the experience (from smell to swallow) but are balanced by some malty sweetness and grapefruit (and other citrus flavors); it's hard to say what my favorite part is, but if you were to force my hand, I would have to say the hoppy presence (I mean c'mon, it's an IPA!)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JamesMN,3.7,"Appearance: Super hazy orange hue with an off-white head.  Aroma: Orange, citrus, caramel malt.  Taste: Big malt bomb but with enough hop assertiveness to stay within the style. The hop flavor is a mix of watery orange, a hint of grapefruit, and pine. It imparts a moderate bitterness upfront that fades to a slow burn in the aftertaste. Very palatable. Dry finish. It is as robust as the 7% ABV suggests.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with above average carbonation. Easy drinkability but not quite a 'juicy' IPA.  Final Thoughts: I've had this one before and it's never blown me away like its collective rating would suggest. It's simply a good American IPA. Would I drink it again? Only if it's the only IPA option.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Jugs_McGhee,3.6,"It's my birthday! I just reviewed Expedition Stout and was really disappointed, but I'm hoping this one is as good as it's meant to be. Here you go, Bell's, this is your second chance. Bottled 08/29/12. 7.0% ABV confirmed. Expectations are through the roof; I've hearing about this one for awhile. 355ml brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a goblet in Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live.  Served straight from the refrigerator. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a two finger frothy creamy beige head of good thickness and retention. Colour is a murky copper. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Looks like any standard IPA ought to.  Sm: Floral, pine, and citrus (lemon) notes - in that order. Light soap. Even a bit of bubblegum. There's some pleasant clean malts lurking beneath the hops. The soap concerns me (I've brewed my fair share of too-long-in-primary IPAs), but I'm hoping it's good. An average strength aroma.  T: Soap, clean malts, floral hops, more soap, some light grapefruit, and lemon on the finish. Imbalanced; the salty soap dominates. What's the hype about? Very underwhelming. It's clean, though, and it does hide its ABV well. No alcohol comes through. A bit salty on the climax; almost gose-esque.  Mf: Smooth, wet, light, and not quite refreshing. Suits the flavours alright.  Dr: Man, Bell's is pissing me off a bit. I don't get the hype about this brewery at all, and I've tried two of their higher rated brews. This one is so damn soapy it's hard to enjoy. Get rid of the soap and then we'll talk, Bell's. What a disappointment. Drinkable, but pedestrian at best.  I initially gave it a C-, but it does get better as it warms.  C  *** 04/07/17: picked up a sixer in NYC to re-review out of the fear my previous bottle may have sat out at room temperature in the store too long.  Glad I did! This is surprisingly well-balanced fare that conceals its ABV very well and offers pleasant notes of floral hops, pine, and more minor fruity flavours, showcasing Centennial quite well. Pale malts keep any hop bitterness at bay.  A highly drinkable IPA I'm pleased to say I was wrong about before (or maybe I had an improperly stored bottle). At $12 per sixer in NYC it's tough to justify over better priced possibly superior offerings from Lagunitas (and I'd sooner shell out a few more bucks for Sculpin), but I could see this being a go-to if I lived in a region where it was more affordable.  Nice work from Bell's.  Low B / GOOD  *** 10/25/18 month old bottle:  Showcases Centennial terrifically. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is slightly oily, which helps coax out additional depth of flavour from the supercascade hop regimen.  Two Hearted is to Centennial what Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is to Cascade. Up there with Racer 5 and Celebration in terms of really well-brewed yet widely distributed IPAs. One of the relatively few IPAs I still pick up at least once every year.  B  *** 07/06/19 bottle:  Few IPAs showcase their hop selection(s) as well as Two Hearted Ale showcases Centennial. So often, single hop IPAs are gimmicky and incomplete, feeling more like one-off experiments that are interesting but not fully realized (I'm looking at you, Mikkeller). Two Hearted is the exception - the single hop IPA that proves the right varietal makes all the difference.  Soft pine, bitter grapefruit, superfloral hop flavours, some resin, some juiciness...this hop profile is terrific.  For my money, it's one of the best IPAs in the world, and its addictive piney taste keeps me coming back regularly.  B+ / VERY GOOD  *** 02/27/20 bottle bottled 01/22/19:  More citrusy and grapefruity than I remembered, but coupled with its prickly carbonation and coating oily mouthfeel it's effective.  Ran me $9.29 USD at a Breaux Mart grocer in Chalmette, LA.  B / GOOD  *** 09/14/20 12 fl oz can ($11.99 plus tax at an overpriced convenience store in New Orleans):  B / GOOD  *** $9.99/sixer of cans:  B- / WORTHY  *** 02/07/21 can from their holiday variety box:  Is there a better 100% Centennial hopped IPA out there? I don't think that there is.  B / GOOD  *** 04/22/21:  B- / WORTHY",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Finally I'm properly reviewing their much-famed ""Two Hearted"" IPA. I'll be honest- this has been one of my ""go-to IPAs"" for years, so this will probably get a favorable score!  A: Pouring a half-finger of off-white head which dissipated quickly. Lacing is better than average, with unremarkable retention. The beer itself is a lovely, opaque orange/amber with carbonation bubbles faintly visible.  S: In a word: KILLER. Smells like an IPA should smell...grassy, pine, floral hoppiness with a caramel candy undertone.  T: Loads of pine, citrus rind, and a touch of that caramel malt to wrap up each sip. This is definitely the easiest drinking 7.0 ABV that I'm aware of. A superbly balanced American IPA flavor.  M: Dry, crisp mouthfeel with light carbonation- a text book example of how an IPA should feel while drinking...effortless!  O: Man, I'm really going to be hurting if I ever leave Kalamazoo...I have tried IPA after IPA and I always come back to Bell's Two Hearted, like a lost cat always finds their way home.

Taste: Follows the smell. Not a lot of hops. A good amount of malt and some citrus. Enters with more hops but dies after a while and has more sweetness. A bit bland in the transit. Not very bitter of an IPA. bitterness is felt just at intake. Like the alcohol content though.  Mouth feel. Medium- to low bodied. Feels just right but nothing 'awesome' about it.  I like the beer that grows on me as i near finishing it, and this one does, may be due to alcohol content but also due to its lingering mouth effect, which is noticeable after 2/3rd of bottle.

287,1093,tectactoe,4.61,"Living in Michigan, I have access to Two Hearted almost everywhere, all the time. Which is f'n great news, because it is an excellent brew. The color is a deep amber, with some copper when the light hits it. A solid white head forms and leaves great lacing all the way down the glass. Hops up front and hops in the back with a very solid citrus and grapefruit profile that goes hand-in-hand with the its floral essence - much expected from an American IPA. The great thing about Two Hearted is that it's incredibly simple, but it's done extremely well. It doesn't have some over-the-top, drawn out, unnecessarily complex flavor profile because it doesn't need one. The bitterness from the hops is balanced nicely with the huge citrus/grapefruit flavors and light undertones of malt. Bitterness lasts the entire time without becoming too overpowering. The beer smells as simple as it tastes - like a nice field of hops and grapefruits; very perfume-like and fragrant from the start to the finish. With a medium body and a perfect amount of carbonation, this mouth is very nice, making this beer easy to drink.  Two Hearted is an extremely simple, yet masterfully executed IPA which is readily available and always delicious.

287,1093,Megahertz,4.14,"12 oz bottle dated 5/25/12 into a hoffman house chalice.  A - Very hazy medium amber with a good cream-colored head.  S - Big juicy citrus and mild pine.  T - Honey like initial sweetness is cut by brisk carbonation. Fades into a very sweet grapefruity mid with strong, clean hop bitterness. Finish is quite dry.  M - Medium body with medium-to-high carbonation.  O - An excellent American-style IPA. A classic example of the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A - Pours a copper orange color, with a foamy off white head that sticks around for a while.  S - Aromas of tropical fruits like pineapple and apricot.  T/M - Not bursting with hop juice like the smell was leaning towards, but still pleasant. Bitter on the front, with a nice malt middle, and a pleasing hop aftertaste. Medium tongue-coating mouthfeel.  O - A solid AIPA for sure.

287,1093,Bitter_Echo,4.47,"Bell's Two-Hearted Ale, fresh bottle, only two weeks old. Appearance is a deep rusty orange and some yellow, cloudy, little head and not much lacing but I slipped this one in too. Smells a very out doors like evergreens and citrus, grapefruit, resinous, fir and balsam notes, just appropriate for said-named beer. Bitter hits early, and modulates and sustains for some time. Grapefruit rind bitter and balanced malt sweet, with strong afterglow and terrific echo, staying with the palate. This one, a terrific sipper, goes camping with me. Impossible to emulate, and truly hard to beat...more please.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,thebrood1987,5,"Amazing smells of grapefruit and piney aromas mixing in with a caramel sweet bready malt. Slight citrus, blasting with a great grapefruit taste and ending with a piney flavor mixing in so well with the cake and caramel bready malts. It ends with the herbal bitterness that is very crisp and refreshing.  I never thought I'd get this beer but since my family went on vacation in Asheville, North Carolina I was able to try this beer out and wow its definitely worth all the hype. Its like Stone IPA but with a better richer malt bill and the hops mixing in with it to create that deep rich taste.  The pink grapefruit, the herbal piney flavors, the slight citrus all from the centennial hop? Very well brewed beer especially with how amazing the malt bill is with this hop strain. This IPA is one my favorites and I wish I could get this in NJ.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Darkmagus82,3.93,"Served on tap in a pint glass  Appearance – Served a light amber color with a tiny white head. The head faded quite fast to leave only a very small amount of lacing.  Smell – The smell is very light and consists of some sweet caramel, bread, lighter fruit smells and a citrus hop smell.  Taste – The taste begins on the drier side and is of a light roasted malt with a decent presence of a an citrus hop bitterness. In the middle it sweetness slightly with some flavors of caramel and light fruit coming to the tongue. These flavors are rather short lived however and fade toward the end, where a more sharp bitter earthy and citrus nature come to the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the slightly above higher than average side in terms of creaminess with a medium level of carbonation. Good for the hop flavors as well as for the more bitter and sharp hop flavors.  Overall – Not much sweetness here but very nice and dry. A flavorful and tasty drier IPA with a nice sharp hop and malty base.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Just the way an IPA should smell.  Taste is sweet bready malts and funky tangerine and pine. Really nice balance. Good bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation.  Overall this is an excellent IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Raime,4.35,"Poured from a keg into a whiskey glass.  A - Pours a deep Orangeish-Amber one finger of white head. Slight bubbles continuing to rise. Leaves trace amounts of lacing.  S - Strong grapefruit on the front of the nose, followed by moderate amounts of lemon and malt. Hops hops and more hops.  T - Tastes of strong hops upfront with some mild grapefruit in the background and a malty slightly burnt finish. All the flavors melded together perfectly and reminded me of a slightly stronger Mad Hatter. Delicious.  M - Mouthfeel remains the same as the taste, With medium carbonation and a moderate body. No complaints here at all.  O - Overall, This was a delicious, Yet quite simple IPA with great flavors. Definitely not as malt heavy as others, Which is fine by me. Would I buy it? Yes, Definitely.  UPDATE AS OF 7/20/2015. Had many times over the past few years and would like to update my rating accordingly as my palate has developed and I no longer have a bias.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,micromaniac129,4.3,"A fine looking beer. The color is bright and lively amber hue with a tad bit of haze. Carbonation also is quite lively. The head though smallish is thick and dense. It lingers on and on. Fine lacing coats the glass.  This brew is nicely aromatic. Its balanced and refreshing. The hop bouquet finds a floral citrus aroma and one could pull out tangerine a deep sniff. Malts are sweet and bready.  An outstanding IPA. An excellent balanced beer here with sweet malts and towards the end a bready graham creacker taste. Hops have a resin, minty almost medicinal taste.  Dranks and feels good on the palette. It's bitter and chewy with a dry aftertaste. I was going to give it a five but I thought the flavor was just a tad weak or watered down. That being said this really is a fantastic beer.

287,1093,RussBecker1,2.82,"Served in a pint glass.  A-Much prettier than expected. A sweet orangey/pale yellow blend with a frothy head that certainly looks very intriguing.  S-Virtually non existent. Maybe some malt maybe some yeast but overall there was hardly anything there.  M- No real different than your average ale, a waxy texture is apparent that sticks to the mouth, but is neither welcoming nor dismissible.  T-Again not nearly worth the hype. Very weak body with hardly any lasting or enjoyable flavors.  O- I have had two hearted a couple of times before and remembered it as being far better than this batch, but the inconsistency of the brew will steer me clear of purchasing this again in the near future",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S) Piney citrus, especially grapefruit. Some sweet malt.  T) Picking up mostly malt at first, less pine and citrus than I expected from smell. Somewhat balanced, but flavors muted. Hops kick in for a moderately bitter finish.  M) Medium-bodied, light to medium carbonation. A somewhat dry finish.  O) A good IPA, somewhat refreshing due to moderate ABV, hops present but not a monster. I would say it's on second-tier of IPA. Very glad I ignored the older 4-pack I tried a few months back; this was a much better and fresher example.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,longbongsilver,3.68,"Wanted to try this previously, but was scared away at the time by talk of a contaminated batch. Figured it's been long enough for that to filter out & show the true nature of the beer, so let's go...  Kinda smell orange & cinnamon before even pouring. Pours a dingy yet still surprisingly clear high orange, head is loose and doesn't last long. Scent is showing off more straight up hop sting than the pre-pour, a pine note.  Primary flavor is more towards pine-hoppy to me than citrus-hoppy, though the latter is still present to an extent. Yet it's not as prominent as I expected given the citrus on the nose practically climbing out of the bottle. Crisp and somewhat thin, though the fizz balances.  I'm probably jaded from bigger wallops in this category, so take this with a grain of salt: not bad, but could stand to do more. Surprisingly chuggeriffic for what's generally an aggressive genre, in both the positive and negative senses.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MagicJeff,4.25,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter  Appearance: Copperish/light brown. Lots of carbonation and minimal head retained throughout drinking.  Smell: Slight lemon and orange peel with toffee malt. Even some alcohol.  Taste: Pretty complex and balanced. Citrusy orange peel leads to some spice and alcohol prevalence. Sweet malty back end/with some slightly bitter apple? Given the floral and herbal scent, I thought it'd be fruitier tasting. Kind of grainy on the back end too. Interesting.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp and on the light medium side. Drinkable too.  Overall: Very enjoyable beer from Bell's and I'd say it's reasonably priced too where I buy mine. I like its drinkability and subtle complexities. Still tasting different things every time I drink it.

Big bubbles stick to the sides as the lacing is very strong. Held up to the light the body turns a golden color. Moderate carbonation, moderate transparency.  S: high amounts of orange peel citrus notes and floral hops, and quite grainy. I’m actually surprised by the lack of complexity in this one as I was expecting more fruit and tropical notes.  T: I pick up on a big biscuit character, bitter pine hops, some citrus, a very slight touch of grapefruit, lots of grain and mild touch of alcohol. Balance is slightly off in my opinion  M: crisp finish is pleasant, leaves a moderate hop aftertaste on the palate that may be too much for some, but it's enjoyable. Medium bodied, this one goes down quick.  O: Unfortunately, I’m disappointed in this one. I was expecting a bit more from Bell’s on this especially with such great reviews and it leaves me wondering if I'm missing something here. I personally think there is too much grain which throws this one off. The hops are great, but there is a lack of tropical fruits to help the balance of this brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Head is a thick finger of pillowy white foam. Light, but nice!  Smell: hugely aromatic with a very good floral, lightly earthy hop aroma, and a sweet malt backbone. I like it.  Taste: hop flavor is much earthier than the aroma. Slowly, a more citrusy hop character comes up from underneath; I like the dynamism. All of this is on top of a good malt character, which is sweet and complements the hops quite well. Quite good.  Mouthfeel: medium body with a very good level of carbonation and a good, creamy texture. Wonderful.  Overall: this beer is very tasty and seems very well-crafted.

White, frothy foam leaps up and kisses me with aromas of citrus, earthy bitter, and I think apricot. The first sip brings me grapefruit from the citrus spectrum, but it moves past the pith towards a more subtle lemon zest, powdery textured biscuit malt, and something that reminds me of an ever so light homage to wildflower honey (maybe orange blossom- we still have that in the few non-overly developed parts of SoCal). The flavor really moves elegantly from the bold pithy citrus to the subtle, understated malt backbone like a ballerina. I’m clicking my palate, enjoying the finish, and then looking forward to starting over again with another sip. Mouthfeel is sufficient for style, and slightly slick. Had this a few years ago, not very fresh, and wasn't overwhelmed. But now, I'm a HUGE fan. I now understand the immense love for this elixir. I am born again.

287,1093,WastingFreetime,4.42,"Reviewed from session notes.  Lightly hazed amber with a surprisingly well-formed head for an IPA, decent retention stability and lacing properties. Smells (and tastes) mostly of big juicy oranges and pineapples, with medium amounts of floral, lemons, and pine resin, and with small amounts of dank and gritty earthiness over a medium-high level of a caramel malt sweet enough to tie it all together. Great smooth texture and just the right amount of carbonation to keep things lively.  One of the greats for the simple reason that it takes what is normally considered a ""hop bomb"" amount of hopping and balances it in a way that keeps the palate from being wrecked as rapidly as other IPAs, as well as showcasing an appealing pallette of hopping aspects.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Aftertaste is long and balanced.  M: Velvety with the right amount of carbonation.  O: For the review, the beer has been drunk a bit older than necessary.

Batch 11295, bottled 13 July 2012. Tasted 7 August 2012, reviewed from notes.  Pours clear golden-orange, apple-juicy, with two fingers of gold-tinged head. Good retention, decent lacing.  Smell is fabulously hoppy. Big grapefruit and pine, with a very full caramel malt undercarriage. Very nice, and very inviting.  Taste shows me those sweet malts again, providing a perfect base on which the mid-level hop bitterness rises and falls. Finishes mildly bitter, as the hops gently drift away. Taste is quite a bit better than the average IPA, thanks to striking just the right balance between bitter and sweet. Yum.  Mouthfeel is on the chewy side, with a resinous sticky feel. Lingering, persistent, and moderately dry in the finish. Good stuff.  This is a top-notch IPA, and I'm impressed.

Pineapples, passion fruits, pears -- all with a bit of a tang smell. Very nice smelling hops. Super solid feature.  T: First flavor you get is the sweet malts, then an explosion of hops, followed by a semi-bitter, dry finish. The fruit flavors aren't as noticeable in the taste as they are in the smell, but the hops save the day here. Nice. Beer remains and gets tastier as it warms.  M: Creamy. Perfecto carbonation. Buttery, velvety texture. Some light chewiness that brings out the alcohol a bit. Strange. Medium body.  O: This is a solid IPA that stands apart from East Coast and West Coast offerings.

Taste: Honestly, the same as the nose, and amazing in every way. Grapefruit, followed by resinous pine bitterness. A substantial caramel malt balances.

S: Grapefruit with hints of orange and mango. Also very floral (fresh cut flower smell). Some caramel maltiness. A little bit of honey and candy sweetness. The dominant aroma is citrus with a bitterness somewhere between orange and grapefruit.  T: Bitter citrus up front. Lots of grapefruit. Through the middle you get more of those caramel malts. This is a very well-balanced IPA. Ends with the bitter grapefruit that lingers. That bitterness really sticks on the tongue. This is an IPA for the IPA enthusiast.

I got it and it had a nice, dark color to it with a beautiful three finger head on it. A thing of beauty. Better yet was the super sticky lacing -- with every sip, you could see the line of how much I drank. Fantastic.  Smell: The smell and taste and a lot of what I got from this was a very deep, pleasant earthy and spicy hoppiness. The smell is much like the taste.  Taste: But the taste is just a BIT better. As nice as it smells, it comes out in every sip. Wonderful balance with the hops... great flavor, with a perfect light bitterness on the finish. I love that I get a taste of Fruit Loops in there, as well as an earthy grit. Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Nice and smooth ... goes down dangerously easy for a 7% ABV.  Overall, a pretty magnificent beer. This has a distinct, strong, pleasant taste to it. As someone that's new to Bell's, this and Oberon have made a good first impression on me ... at least on tap.

Clearly a nice wide spectrum of hop use supported by a sweet bready malt backbone.  On the tongue it takes a firmer direction towards floral and earthy hops. Malts become a bit more bold.

That said, I almost expected to find some kind of flaw when I sat down and put 110% focus on it...but nothing really came to me.

287,1093,Converge,4.6,"355ml bottle poured into a 16oz tulip. Packaged 06/22/12. Thanks to Matt for this one!  A - Pours a deep, vibrant orange color with a thick foamy head, slightly off-white. Fantastic head retention and lacing. Looks excellent.  S - Juicy tropical hops upfront. Pineapple, mango, light grapefruit, orange, and boatloads of peach. Earthy pine notes underneath that as well. The peachy hop might be the most prominent aroma here, honestly. A thin layer of caramel malt for some sweetness and balance, but this aroma is all about the bright, fruity hops. Floral, citrusy, and everything I love in a good IPA.  T - Surprisingly big malt presence, which is the first thing that hits me. Toasty and bready caramel malt, with some biscuity notes. The hops are definitely here, but not exactly as the nose had implied. There's a fair helping of mango, pineapple, and grapefruit, but the peachy sweetness is really toned down. There's also a bigger pine character in the finish, giving it a much more robust and resinous feel. A nice blend of floral, tropical, piney hops fade into a long lasting bitter finish and aftertaste. Not a ton of balance here, but it isn't really needed; the hop profile here is awesome.  M - Low but prickly carbonation with a medium bodied weight. Lingering bitterness, with a slightly sticky feel. Fairly smooth and easy drinking all around.  D - For me, this beer didn't quite live up to the hype. However, this should really stand as a benchmark for what a good American IPA should be. This beer had everything you would expect from the style, from the light toasty and bready caramel malt backbone, to the big, assertive hop presence in the finish. A nice balance between the piney/earthy/herbal hops, and the tropical/fruity ones as well. Altogether, this makes for a delicious and drinkable brew that any true beer lover should try at least once. Remarkable, but not quite world-class.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Wonderful pine, citrus and slight tropical fruit. There’s a sweetness, but it seems to be more from the tropical hops than the malt.  T: Great mix of all the aromas and some terrific hop spice notes. There’s a slight amber toastiness that adds a nice element.  M: High drinkability. Body medium, texture on the dry side and finish is slightly astringent.  O: This is the freshest bottles of Two Hearted that I’ve consumed and it made a difference. There is some of the same tropical fruit notes that I get from Hopslam.

Like some half-eaten fish floating in an e. coli laced Michigan swamplake.  STYLE: American IPA  ABV: 7%  LOOK: Hazy, thin pennies, a wee bit watery. I’m not sure it’s strong enough to hold a meaningful head, even if it wanted to.  NOSE: Fruity sourdough and buttered popcorn. More fruit than hops, more malt than expected. Very decent.  MOUTH: Fickle beer, maybe deceptive. The start, it’s real nice. Sugared grapefruit and almond cake. But that gives way, a little too soon. Acerbic, canned paint, hand soap. Drink this one quickly.

EIther way, I despite feeling pretty neutral about this brew, I'd be willing to give it another shot in the future.  EDIT: Tried it again today, in a bottle, and had a more pleasant experience.

Bottled 06/02/12  Appearance - An absolutely vibrant and delicious looking brew. A thick, foaming, frothy head that is clings to the glass quite loosely. The beer has an orange and pink grapefruit appearance to it. Highly carbonated and very apparent that it is freshly made.  Smell - Very heavy notes of pink grapefruit and orange citrus. Tangerine splashes at the nostrils while a light hoppy pine waves in the background. A light hint of malt.  Taste - An extraordinary brew. This could possibly the freshest brew I've ever had. A very faint ethanol burn sits in the throat while orange coats the tongue. A fresh hop profile tickles the cheeks. The swallowing of the beer is accompanies by the taste of pink grapefruit and piney hops.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability - This beer is absolutely delicious on the tongue and cheeks.

287,1093,hsvhughes,5,"Bell's Two-Hearted ale is the best tasting, most complex IPA I have had. It is a little high on carbs, but wow... the flavor is unforgettable.  appearance --&gt; sticky, memorable lacing that will impress smell --&gt; the BEST fragrance of ANY IPA I have tried taste --&gt; hard to describe... complex yet hoppy... a true Bell's accomplishment mouthfeel --&gt; It feels so good, you delay the swallow, but you must. Overall --&gt; I think this is the best IPA available in the USA. Try it! Appearance --&gt; if you like clear, clean beer with lacing that sticks to the glass all the way down, then you just might like this one.  Edit --&gt; 8-1-2012  This beer changed my life. No, I am not from Michigan. I am from Alabama.  ALL THESE following BEERS ARE GOOD, but prior to trying Two-Hearted, I did not know beer could be so awesome. I have tried Terrapin's ""hopsecutioner"" from Georgia. It hits the hops button, but a little too bitter and uninteresting. I tried Stone's ""ruination"". It stomps out the hops big time, and has that distinctive American Imperial IPA taste, but lacks the complexity I seek. Then I tried Sierra Nevada's ""Torpedo"". Torpedo is very good, but it seems heavy on the stomach. The ""Sweetwater IPA"", also from Georgia, is a good IPA, but it is not in the same league as Two-Hearted Ale. ""MoJo IPA"" is what I buy when the store is out of Two-Hearted.  Two-Hearted Ale has the rare balance of complexity and hops that will deliver that IPA taste we seek.  I have noticed four types of beer drinkers:  1. The BMC Dudes--&gt; They drink Bud, Coors, or Miller Light because they have never tried a good IPA. They do not really enjoy the BMC, but that is all they know. I know this because I was once one of them.  2. Sweet Beers --&gt; Sweet beer drinkers like Porters and thick, syrupy beers that really weigh in on the malty side of beer and they go to sleep after drinking a couple of them. Since they went to sleep after two porters, they think that was good?  3. Sour beers (argh!) --&gt; There are beers from Belgium that are actually SOUR like old wine. Some people actually like this taste, but it makes me want to hurl.  4. Finally, the wonderful, bitter, HOPS laden IPAs --&gt; The American IPAs take first prize. We are so lucky to have access to so many VERY GOOD American IPAs. Belgium can have their sour beer, and England can have their ""brown Ale"" that looks like toilet water. In The USA, we have the best.  ...But I digress.  I have discovered I like beers that are:  * not too heavy on the malt * hoppy * complex * feels good in my mouth * fragrant, in a hops kind of way * Not boring  Two-Hearted Ale meets these requirements.

287,1093,leantom,4.83,"Bells is one of my favorite breweries. After trying Hopslam and enjoying it, a friend of mine recommended Two-Hearted Ale, the other popular (and non-Imperial) IPA brewed by Bells. Alright, here goes:  A: I poured the beer directly into a glass to see the type of head that would be produced. It was large and white (very large, actually). While the head dissipated quickly, it was large enough to impress me. The beer's body was a clear orange and quite pretty to look at (especially with a massive head sitting atop it). Perfect IPA-type appearance.  S: Very floral and citrusy. I love the smell of lemons, so I'm quite partial to the smell of IPA's, but what really stood out was this beer's flowery aroma. It smells similar to sunflowers.  T: Delicious. Can taste lemons, oranges, white pepper, various spices and grapefruit. The dominant flavor was lemon, though. Furthermore, for an IPA there was very little hop bitterness, and the aftertaste was barely noticeable (very different from most IPA's in which a bitter, stinging aftertaste is apparent). I was so shocked that I accidentally started gulping it down quickly before realizing how much of the beer I had actually drunk (more than 6 oz). I would almost classify this beer as dangerously drinkable.  M: Very smooth and non-bitter, which is shocking for an IPA. Like I said in the 'taste' section, this beer is dangerously drinkable.

There is a hint of biscuit like malt and alcohol sweetness  Intense hop bitterness hit the palate with the first sip. There is all the classic kinds of bitterness of an American IPA. Pine, citrus, and floral notes surround the palate. There is a bit of biscuit malt and sweetness from the alcohol. I do however, feel like there is a lack of balance between the flavors.  Medium bodied and finishes dry and bitter.  Overall, this IPA would be perfect drinking if there a little more malt added for the balance. But, if you are hophead then this a beer that you will fall in love with. I love my hops don't get me wrong. I just like some balance.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,littlelorib,3.95,"A nice honey-amber color with about a finger of slowly dissipating head. Smell is heavy with grapefruit and grass.

287,1093,grogged,3.2,"Purchased in 12 oz bottle at Trader Joe's.  Pours a pretty, slight reddish gold w/ very little head and a slightly clingy lacing. Smell was mild yet it had a medicinal overtone to it that was also present in the taste and finish. It's light and smooth on the palate. Almost reminded me of Hamm's Golden Draft without the macro carbonation. The medicinal aftertaste doesn't linger long in the finish and is replaced by a pleasant, malty flavor. Overall, it's a pleasant beer. But I was hoping for more from the reviews I've read. I may purchase it again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

So incredible for an IPA. One of the most complex and balanced and non-bitter IPAs I've every had. The flavors from the hops are so good, I can't describe but just wonderful. They come up and smack you with bold flavor then leave with a smooth finish and little bitterness in aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Perfectly fine.  Overall - I went out of state to find this beer. I was skeptical, but the flavorings in this IPA truely are spectacular. Lots of flavor but not very bitter at all.

287,1093,markmiller,4.32,"I think my tulip glass was just as excited for this beer as I was. Pours an excellent shade of dark golden orange with fluffy white head. Love it.  The smell just blows you away as it pours. Piney, resinous hops combined with citrus peels waft through the air and makes your mouth water.  Upon first sip, the hops give a Chuck Norris round-house kick in the mouth, and the malty backbone keeps you standing. What an amazing and perfect balance of bitter hops and creaminess that blows my mind.  The beer coats your tongue with that bitter-sweet hops flavor and is just incredible.  Truly a magnificent brew that I wish was available in my area. Quite possibly the top 2 IPA I've had to date.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Pure mahogany to be serious, the color is lighter than it tastes.  Smell: Hoppy, yet sweet. This double IPA's smell alone makes you forget regular IPAs.  Taste: Awesome. It goes beyond pure hops, adding some sweetness to it. The bite of IPAs is gone, too, making this an unbelievably easy drinking strong beer. If you use this as a session beer, look out.  Mouthfeel: Certainly not thin, but not overly thick either.  Overall: My favorite beer. Only a person with no heart will dislike Two Hearted.

287,1093,dhannes,3.82,"From 10-13-12--New review (forgotten I had reviewed this): Received as a gift from my sister-in-law. Tried almost two months after the date on the bottle. I recall having a sample of this back in June, but did not recall much about it.  A=Medium golden color, a bit lighter than usual for an IPA. Faint off-white foamy head of about one finger that settled down but stayed for a few minutes.  S=Smell of sweet hops...honey, with a hint of wheat. Rather strong and somewhat appealing.  T=I took a sip of this before I came to the site, and did not realize that it was an IPA. IPA's are not one of my favorite styles, but, as IPA's go, this one is rather enjoyable. I found a moderate and sweet hop presence, reminiscent of craft beers. Milder than many IPA's, this could be a session beer if consumed with a meal.  M=Nice moderate body, with average to above average carbonation. Sweetness and sourness presence make it one that you need to drink slowly.  O=As IPA's go, this one is more for the non-IPA drinker--if you are having a party with a variety of tastes and want to have an IPA available for maltheads, this one would work well.  ---  From 5-5-12: Served chilled in a bottle at a local restaurant...could not see nor smell it. Bottle had a February 14, 2012 date on it, but did not seem to be an issue with the higher ABV.  T=Tangy, with hop zestiness. I usually don't enjoy IPA's, but this one was rather drinkable. I paired with a cheeseburger, and it helped offset the onions.  M=Seemed to be a bit lacking for the style, but rather drinkable.  O=Not a bad IPA, but I didn't experience the hype that others have had for this beer. If forced to choose an IPA, this would be my choice, as it was not overly hoppy and still enjoyable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Very slight haze and a dark golden color.  S-Hops-NW US style, citrus, tropical and pine aromas are all in here. Fairly sweet smelling.  T-Yes it's definitely an IPA, hoppy for sure (same taste as smell) but also has a significant malt character as well which helps carry this beer and make it more than a 1-dimensional hop bomb.  M-Nice body for a standard IPA-this definitely has a heavy malt bill. Medium levels of carbonation that help carry the flavors leading to a bitter finish, but it doesn't linger as much as others which definitely improves the drinkability. At 7%, the alcohol is completely hidden.  O-I'm not an IPA guy, but Bell's really has it down. This and Hopslam are fantastic hoppy beers to go along with many of their other stellar brews.

S - Grapefruit, pine, and sweet hops. All the scents are soft and very nice on the nose.  T - Loaded with citrus up front, dominated by grapefruit. The beer moves into a nice fruity hop bitterness. The malt is not particularly dominant, but for the style it's damn near perfect.  M - Medium bodied brew that is rich, smooth and creamy. Carbonation is on point, complimenting the hops nicely.

287,1093,jeremy13586,4.1,"A long time favorite that I've never had the chance to review.  The beer was a golden color that wielded a two finger eggshell white head. The head disappeared pretty quickly, but settled in to a film of bubbles and left some sticky lacing.  Grapefruit, grass, and other citrus fill the nose. There is a note of some sweetness. Caramel maybe?  Again, very citrusy hops that follows in to a earthy bitterness. There is a fruit-loopy sweetness that rounds out each sip. The most that I can make out from the malt is some caramel, but there is enough of a backbone to help out all the hops. Has a mellow bitter finish.  Medium bodied with a smooth and creamy carbonation.  This is my go-to IPA. It's not the absolute best, but the drinkability is uncanny. Lots of flavor and it won't bog you down. The only thing to watch out for is that it hides the 7% very well, so the booze will catch up with you.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

M: Medium body with some carbonation and a dry finish.  T: A Grapefruit and citrus bitterness in a very big hops blast. Again there is a little pine and floral after the intitial citrus rush. And just enough malt backbone to to keep the bitterness from becoming overwhelming.  O: The upfront hops blast really gets your attention.

T: The hops come first, and the resinous & piney aspects dominate. The malt flavor shows up in the middle, and some citrus aspects near the end. Bitterness lingers just a bit and masks a mild alcohol presence.  M: Really nice. Good carbonation but smooth.

S: Initial grapefruit with a hint of grassy aroma. Very pleasing to the nostrils.  T: Once applied to mouth it kicks off a few flavors of many higher ABV brews that I enjoy. I always like to know I'm getting something for the money. Leaves a pleasant after taste on the back of tongue which lasts suprisingly long. Might be slightly bitter, but in a good way.  M: Has some bubble to it, for sure not a flat effect. Almost makes you want to chew when held in mouth for a few seconds. This is one that personally I could drink a ""few"" of on one of those nights if you know what I mean. Very hearty, no pun intended.  O: I'm glad this is a year round brew. In my book, it is one of those tasty sixers that I appriciate to have on hand at the local beer store when needed.

287,1093,fmccormi,4.38,"Straight pour from 12oz pry-off bottle to Luettich balloon glass (Bruery tulip), bottling date of March 19, 2012 printed on the bottom of the back label (“11002 PKGD 03/19/12 A”)  Appearance (4.5): Two fingers of off-white foam rise up quickly, on top of a honey-gold body that is the epitome of “hazy”: not opaque by any means, but not clear enough to make out definite shapes on the other side of the glass. Awesome. Head dies down to a rocky cap, leaving moderate lacing all around.  Smell (4.0): Very, very pungent grapefruit and fresh-cut grass notes come through first—wonderful hop aroma, really nice. Malt body is understated and dry, and that’s okay.  Taste (4.5): Well-balanced from the start. The hops feel wet and citrusy, offering a mild citrus fruit rind character that moves into a full-flavored (but not terribly bitter) piney core to the hop profile. It retains a citrus note in the background, however, and the finish is mild to moderate in intensity but offers a nice grassiness to it. Meanwhile, the malt body is bready but not particularly sweet—like fresh-baked white bread or crackers. The yeast note is subtle but in the background the whole time, a slightly chalky, earthy character.  Mouthfeel (4.5): Medium-bodied with a nice carbonation: never prickly or tingly, but full nonetheless, it foams and fills your mouth in a lush way without being syrupy or viscous. Nice, slightly oily character that finishes very dry.  Overall (4.5): This is just so well-balanced, without relying on sweetness to balance out the hops. As a result, it drinks like a session beer in spite of the 7.0% ABV, and is easy-going. A real knock-out in this style might be hoppier, might be more pungent, might be lacier, etc., but this is just so tasteful and balanced. Excellent beer, it’s like an exercise in what your standard IPA should be, nailing every aspect without screaming for attention at any point.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The beer has a finger tall beige head that reduces to a thin layer over the entire surface of the beer with some much thicker patches and a very thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant lacing is observed.  S: There is a definite dominant presence of hops in the smell - I get both citrus/grapefruit as well as some floral hops. The aroma is bright but not overly intense, making it very approachable. There is also some underlying malty sweetness (I'm thinking it is more caramel like than anything else).  T: The flavor is similar to the smell but the balance between the malty sweetness and the hoppiness is even better. There is a definitely caramel malt sweetness upfront. The hops and the bitterness follow that but the bitterness is mild and not a palate destroyer. I can taste both the citrus/grapefruit as well as the floral hops with the grapefruit flavor being just a little stronger.  M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly crisp and very refreshing.  O: Extremely easy to drink and definitely a top American IPA - this beer is just delicious and has a great flavor and aroma. The beer has a very inviting aroma and is quite approachable even to people that are not huge IPA fans (like my wife). This beer is definitely sessionable and one that I really enjoy.

The fruits are big and sweet and it’s the first time I can say I’ve described an IPA as peachy, so points for being unique. Big fresh peaches and apricots plus the a little bitter citrus, i.e., grapefruit.  Smooth and fruity, on the sweet side for an IPA but it's not saccharine; i prefer more bitterness.  On the slicker side, not too dry, and again, it's a little sweet. Lots of carbonation.  Very drinkable. While I’m used to, and I think prefer, an IPA that’s a little more bitter, clean, and crisp, it’s pretty good; they have a unique thing here.

287,1093,StoutHunter,4.45,"I picked up a six pack of Bell's Two Hearted Ale a couple days ago for $9.99 at Krogers. This was the first IPA that I drank and actually enjoyed but for some reason I have never reviewed it, since I haven't had it in a while I decided to pick up six pack, so lets see how it goes. Bottled on 2/21/2012 #10949. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a imperial pint glass.  A- I have always loved the label on this beer, it goes perfectly with the name and is classic looking. It poured a pretty clear golden amber color that took a nice bright golden color when held to the light and it had three fingers worth of bubbly white head that died down to a thin layer that stayed till the end and left some nice rings of lacing. This is a good looking beer, you can always be sure to have lots of lacing with this brew.  S- The aroma is pretty bright and vibrant. It starts off with tons of hops which impart a heavy grapefruit aroma that mixes nicely with a lot of floral hop aromas. It's got a high amount of sweetness in the aroma and in the middle I pick up some biscuity and slightly bready malts that provide a little balance. The aroma is very nice, I like the balance between citrus and floral hops.  T- The taste seems much more balanced then the aroma. It starts off with lots of good citrusy hop flavors with grapefruit sticking out the most. After that I get some biscuity and bready malts that have a much lower amount of sweetness then aroma did and are followed by lots of floral hops flavors on the finish with a lighter amount of medium bitterness and really floral and somewhat sweet aftertaste. The flavors are very good, the citrus and floral hops are balanced nicely and they proved great contrast to the biscuit like malts..  M- Smooth, refreshing, medium bodied, with a medium amount of carbonation. There nothing wrong with the mouthfeel, it's true to style and fits this beer nicely.  Overall I really like this beer and it's one of may favorite American IPA's, they don't get much more solid then this and the mixture of citrus and floral hops is just about perfect and gives this a beer a distinct aroma and taste that is unique to this beer. This beer has great drinkability, when I was younger I was known to drink a six pack in a session but after one too many rough mornings I have come to the conclusion that two or three of these is the perfect amount. What I liked most about this beer were the flavor and aroma, they are kick ass they set this beer apart from all the other IPA's on the market. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, I thought long and hard and I can't really think of a single thing wrong with this beer, I would like to see it in cans, but the fact it comes in a mini keg is pretty kick ass. I will continue to regularly buy this beer and since I live in Michigan this beer is almost always an option at any descent bar or restaurant, and it pairs well with almost any type of food, I like it the most with some hot wings. If you consider yourself an IPA aficionado and have not tried this beer, you need to seek it out ASAP, enough said. I love this beer and I think I always will, to me this is the quintessential Michigan IPA, pretty much a classic. Bell's is one of the most consistent brewerys and this beer is very solid, like most of their lineup, one of the best American IPA's from one of the best American brewerys.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,NuclearDolphin,4.55,"Poured into a pint glass  Appearance - Bright orange with a pretty hazy transparency. Head pours around a 1 finger width with excellent lacing and head retention.  Smell - Sweet Toffee, Caramel, and Floral Hops. There's also some sweet yeasty and malty notes in here too. The overall sweetness also has a bit of a fruitiness to it, which is unusual considering the overall composition of the smell.  Taste - Sweet Citrus Hops, Biscuits, Toffee and Caramel with a slight bitter floral hoppy kick. The maltiness is also very well balanced and yet you can notice it at the same time, which makes an even great tasting beer even better  Mouthfeel - Body is very light and feels very crisp and refreshing! Carbonation is well balanced enough that it helps add to the overall flavor. When it comes to IPAs, they really don't get much easier to drink than this!  Overall - The flavor is sweet, well balanced and most importantly, enjoyable! The palate is also very well balanced, crisp and refreshing. You really cannot go wrong with Two Hearted Ale, it is that good!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BeerRecruiter,5,"My everything beer from the office to sports. Very refreshing, and it always brings me back to fishing for steelhead on the Ausable River in MI where I first tasted it.  Citrus flavor coupled with a perfect amount of hops. Not bitter, and finishes smooth and dry. An excellent choice when thirsty, and the alcohol content is enough to get the job done. Initial smell let's one know that they are in for a treat if they like hops.  Tough to beat this IPA, period. I just wish I didn't have to drive an hour to PA to get it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JohnRioux,4.46,Another solid IPA and another strong brew from Bell's. Where Bell's appeared from? I don't know. How long it's been in Georgia? I have not idea. But I'm glad it is. Not much tops Hopslam. Two hearted is definitely a favorite and a sure go-to beer.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,davey101,4.42,Bottled on 03/05/2012. 12 oz bottle into an over sized pint glass. Big thanks to GRDave for sending this in a trade.  A - Light amber/golden body. Fluffy two finger head with great lacing and retention.  S - Grapefruit heavy hops with a touch of biscuity malts. Bitter yet clean.  T - Much different from the nose. A perfect balance between grapefruit citrus and bready malt. Low amount of bitterness. Finishes very clean. Medium mouth feel with a great level of carbonation. Highly drinkable.  O - This is perfection. An absolutely stellar IPA. Just really well baalnced and clean with the right amount of hops and malt.

S: Big hops, citrus, pine with bready sweet maltyness in the background.  T: Citrus / piny hops and sweet malt meld nicely to form a very well balanced flavor.  M: Balanced carbonation to match the flavor. Medium - Thin (as it warms) and a bittersweet aftertaste. Smooth and easy to drink.  O: This is a Top Notch every day, go-to easy drinking IPA. Its the type you can give to someone who is fairly new to the hap flavor thing and start to convert them to a Hop Head. Try it you'll like it.  Glass = Pint.

287,1093,ProfPayne,4.75,"One of my favorite IPAs. In fact, it's a go to IPA, and also the beer I use to convert people who don't think they like bitter. This beer is incredibly balanced and integrated. Best consumed fresh, this beer is still great in the bottle and is almost always in my house. The fact that it's named after a Hemingway location makes it all the more special in my book!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

T - A lot of hops in the beginning. It evolves to a sweet citrus flavor. The bitterness isn't overpowering & pleasant.  M - It's about what I expect for an IPA. Good mouthfeel & medium carbonation.  O - A nice, citrusy IPA. Not overly bitter & very paletteable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Blueribbon666,4.13,"Review from notes. My virgin 2 Hearted Ale, a legendary name among a style I'm still exploring from a brewery I enjoy and respect very much. Not sure what to expect from this as I either like or loathe IPA's usually never a middle ground. Pours a hazy straw color into pint glass. Smells of crisp hops and piney as expected for the american ipa style. Taste/mouthfeel, Wow as hearty as I expected but a very nice crisp back end with a spicy but clean finish. Very good body that just seems to change by the second, warm, hearty, crisp and citrusy good as a sipper or dare I say session for the hearty few. So glad this lived up to the hype, though I know from what I've read batch variation is quite common. Would seek out and recommend. Another solid brew from Bell's",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,areich6,4.61,"A: Very light copper color, poured with very little head and leaves a bit of lacing.  S: Really faint smell of pears and citrusy fruits such as lemons. Barely detectable, however.  T: I do not detect a lot of hop bitterness in this, however, the flavors are incredible. Citrusy lemons and oranges make themselves evident and the taste lingers in the mouth after swallowing. Delicious. The citrusy flavors are also probably due to the use of citric hops which would explain why I didn't get an overpowering bitter quality from the taste.  M: Extremely smooth and thirst quenching. I could easily down a 6er of these on a hot summer day.  O: Fantastic beer. It does not have the traditional hoppiness of many IPA's but it is just a great tasting brew. Sweet and delicious.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Crundy,4.27,"A: Hazy orange color, white head, soapy lacing, well carbonated  S: Big hop bitterness, citrus and piney aromas, sweet malt in the background  T: Very well balanced, the sweet malt mingles nicely with the hop bitterness, the pine flavor is slightly more prominent than the citrus flavor.  M: nice bite from the carbonation and the hop bitterness, but also very smooth and creamy. medium bodied and leaves a bittersweet aftertaste.  O: Probably one of the best IPAs i've had. It wasn't a hop bomb which is nice but it also wasn't too sweet which I appreciate. Great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,WrathsU,4.52,"A - Pale golden body with slight orange tint to it. Moderate white head on vigorous pour. Lacing looks good.  S - Very citrusy, orange and grapefruit, and moderate dank qualities. Sweet malt backbone to it as well. Get a moderate whiff of sugar.  T - Fantastic hop flavors up front. Very sublimely sweet orange. Bitterness level is a bit low but is there. Getting some caramelized sugars in the background and almost an English yeast taste.  M - Good medium bodied with a bit of nice ""chewiness"" to it. The carbonation is spot on and there is no alcohol burn.  O - A very very good IPA. A tad too sweet and missing a tad of bitterness which could really help cut through that sweetness. The hop flavor profile is amazing though and one of the better ones I've ever had.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,dorianmarley,4.58,"Appearance is hazy, golden brown. It has a massive, luscious head with very sticky lacing.  Nose is ruby red grapefruit, fresh sugar, allspice, fresh hops, and light-caramel malt.  The taste is a perfectly mild set of hops, with lemon/lime candy, tangerine, and cashew. The malt is light, and provides a steady undertone for balance.  Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp with medium carbonation; but silky like a cream soda.  Especially for Midwesterners, this is a hop-focused gem that never overpowers. It has wonderful balance. It is packed with flavor. And it is always fun to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Smells of sweet malt and a flowery and citrus aroma. Tastes light sweet malt with a little piney and citrus from the hops, which is nice balance and great taste. Carbonation is right and it is a bit light bodied, which is very good.

287,1093,snatch210,4.23,"pours alarmingly foamy, but that's just the beer's way of winking at you before the awesomeness to come.  smell is good. the typical grapefruit/piney notes are balanced out nicely by sweet maltiness. i'm probably crazy, but i get a little bit of cream soda. overall, a bit more subdued than i'd like, though.  taste: won't knock you back like its cousin hopslam, but you get a nice blast of hops up front before it fades into a nice, fruity sweetness with some bite on the end. the balance here -- hops to malts -- is what sets it apart from many American IPAs.  mouthfeel: i love how creamy this beer is. one of the best things about drinking two hearted.  overall, this is not the best ipa in the world. but it is a damn good one. only real flaw is a bit of a subdued smell, but i got over that years ago. best IPA i can get in my distro area for a reasonable price.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MichPaul,4.8,"I can almost give this beer a 5 out of 5 on the scale, and actually remains my top beer overall. I love everything about this beer, the ONLY thing I would change is maybe give it a tiny bit stronger bite. I have been a ""Hop Head"" lately, but this beer is a good one when you want to tone it down a bit. This beer is very citrus filled but has just the right amount of bite to it to not be ashamed to call it an ""American IPA"". This is the perfect Summer beer that could easily be shared around the BBQ. This is also tame enough to be a GREAT session beer, where you can enjoy quite a few. Best all around beer for me so far!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Philousa,4.39,"One finger white head sits atop a clear pale, orangish brew. Patchy head has good retention. Leaves a thin, scattered lace on the glass. Strong floral and orangey aroma, light and zesty. Sweetish malt ist here behind the hops, which stand up grassy after a while. The malt isn't afraid to showcase its semi-sweet biscuity flavor before the hops turn bitter in your mouth, flashing citrus/orange before going full on grassy bitter. Lingers a good while with green (unripe) lemon zest. Easily drinkable and balanced. Not too much body to weigh you down. Bitterness makes you want to take a second before your next drink. Dry finish.  This is one great IPA. I'm sad I don't live in Bell's' distribution area, but was very glad to grab a sixer and enjoy it in CA. Well balanced, and very different from West Coast IPAs. Not as piney or resinous, this is still a bitter brew that I enjoy. A great change of pace and a good stand by.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

T - Quite bitter with strong hops and little underlying malt. Bitterness becomes more complex and lingers. Resins are strong and dance on the edge of medicinal.  M - Slick and lively as it passes over the palate and base of tongue.  O - At first not so appealing or drinkable, but I find myself drawn to the Two Hearted sip after sip and then back to the fridge for another. It is has become a go-to bitter IPA, not as smooth and easy as some, not as punishing as the big boys.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,4DAloveofSTOUT,4,"12 oz bottle poured into tulip glass. Bottle date of 12/16/11.  Appearance: A golden straw colored beer with 3 fingers worth of thick white head. Spotty lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell: strong notes of pine and citrus. Smells really good! Not getting much from the malt profile of this beer.  Taste: moderate bitterness from the hops profile. Pine upfront with grapefruit and oranges. Its a well balanced IPA. You can just detect the malts as a biscuity flavor and you dont get much else from the malts. Aftertaste is not really all that bitter, it quite pleasant. The hop flavors just kind of fade away so that you want to take another drink right away to get more hops flavor.  Mouthfeel: high end of a low bodied beer. Moderately carbonated. The beer is crisp, clean, and easy drinking all the way.  Overall: I am a fisherman so i really love this label with a trout on it. The beer is better than your average IPA. I think this would be a good beer to take fishing to give you more luck! Also because its a tasty beer! Bells make quality beer!

287,1093,lokieman,3.61,"Thanks to coppcw08 for sending this in a trade. Been wanting to try this one for a long time...  bottle into pint glass:  A: Looks like a classic IPA golden yellow with orange hints. Nice carbonation and lacing already on my glass. Good looking IPA...  S: I'm actually a little let down by the aroma coming off the beer. Much more subdued than I was expecting. The tropical, piney, fruity smell is there but just not as pronounced as I was expecting.  T: Front of the tongue is a nice splash of hop bitterness that evolves into a sweeter, fruity flavor in the middle. Finishes dry with a nice hop bitterness with a touch of alcohol. Good but not great...  M: Typical mouthfeel for an IPA. Does finish dry and good level of carbonation that allows the flavors to come out a little more.  O: I have to say I'm a little let down by this bottle. I was expecting a big, fruity, piney IPA from the reviews I've seen and what I've heard but it just was a little too subdued for me. A very solid IPA but not better than a lot of others out there. I can see this being a great beer for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon but I'd just as soon pop a few Racer 5's or Torpedos. Very solid IPA that I would definitely drink again but probably wouldn't trade for again. Glad I got to try it...  I did check the bottle dating after I wrote this review and discovered that it was over 2 months old. Maybe the flavors faded?

Crisp finish, the bitterness dissipates a bit and some sweet malt takes over.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slick. well carbonated.

A- 1 finger of white head which left nice lacing around the glass. Color is the typical hazy golden orange seen in most Ipas. Some carbonation off the bottom of the glass but not much.  S- Orange, grapefruit, citrusy hops, with a touch of sweet bready malts. Not a big aroma, but pleasant.  T- Taste is lacking for me, was hoping for the taste to at least match the aroma. In my oppinion it lands short of the mark. Its a clean finish but there is not much there in terms of hop characters and bready malts. Which are the characters Im looking for in the taste of an Ipa. Wasnt much in the way of bitterness either.  M- Light bodied with decent carbonation  O- Had hopes for this beer but it fell flat for me. Wasnt impressed and wouldnt search this one out.

Taste is amazing. Flawless really. Hints of sweet citrus flavors such as grapefruit and candied orange. The hops don't slap your tongue silly (I usually like that) but who cares when this beer tastes so good. Really refreshing and an easy drinker even at 7%. This beer also left some gorgeous lacing.

Probably one of the most equally balanced aromas(between the malt and hop flavors), in an IPA, I've ever had. The breadiness from the malts, the piney, slightly fruity aromas from the hops blend exceptionaly well.  Flavors follow the nose to a tee, with a slight bitter grapefruit taste added to the tongue. Not overly bitter... which is the way I like my IPS's. This is an amazing beer!  Medium body... very smooth, with an appropriate amount of carbonation.

Pours a beautifully clear golden color, plenty of bubbles, with a creamy white one finger head on the top. The aroma consists of sweet pale malts, grapefruit, honey, just a hint of pine. Flavor follows as smooth as can be. Some up front bitter slowly drifts into a sweet honey grapefruit flavor and finishes with a clean crisp bite.

287,1093,spdyfire83,4.55,"176th Review Served in a half pint On-draft at the mothership itself in Kalamazoo!  From notes.  A: Hazy orange with golden tint depending on how the light hits the glass. 1.5 (white) fingernail head.  S: Pungent (earthy) hops, sweet malt backbone, citrus, pine, and caramel. Hidden fruit esters linger on nose, but this balances so nicely with the hop and malt characters you just want to dive in and find out what this beer is all about.  T: BOOM! Hops burst forth as soon as this liquid hits the palate, but its perfection does not stop there. The bitterness and malt tango is so well executed there is negligible room to find criticism. Notes of citrus, pine, grapefruit, and caramel sweetness accent the hop profile as this beer is brilliantly well-rounded.  M: Medium bodied (creamy) with moderate carbonation.  O: This beer is quite tasty all-around. Not too much to say other than that. I've had bad experiences with bottles of this, but if you can get this on-tap and fresh, it is worth seeking out.

287,1093,charliedvrs,4.44,"Pours a slightly hazy yellowish amber with one finger of thick white head. Tons of hop citrus hop aroma, just bright, sweet, juicy grapefruit. There's a touch of sweet malt in the taste, but it's more than overpowered by the sharp citric hop flavor. From beginning to end this one is just full of that classic American hop taste. Moderate carbonation and a slightly less than medium body give a very smooth mouthfeel that ends with a moderate bitterness and a nice dryness on the palate. The beer just screams classic American IPA, and does so very well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Clowerweb,4,"Served from a 12oz bottle, bottled on date: 10/06/11 (4 months old). Poured aggressively into a pint glass.  A: Looks a light golden, almost blonde ale color, very cloudy. Lots of active carbonation bubbles coming up. Finger of white head, good retention.  S: Very floral, hoppy, pine, citrus, very aromatic.  T: Whew! Definitely an IPA. This IPA style is not my cup of tea really... or glass of beer rather, but hopheads should love it. Lots and lots of pine, citrus, higher IBUs, very hop forward in the start through the mid palate. Tries to balance a tad on the finish with a bit of malts, finishes a bit sweet. Doesn't leave that bitter burning pinesol feeling in the back of my sinuses after a sip like some IPAs of this style do, so that's a plus. Also the slightly higher ABV is well masked, I don't get much booze in the flavor.  M: Medium body, slightly on the watery side, light carbonation.  D: Drinkability is hard to measure with this one because it's such a niche style. Your mileage may vary. For me, it's drinkable, but I'm not a huge fan of big IBUs and piney flavors.  O: Overall, I'm not a big fan. It's one of those styles where you either love it or hate it, and I'm rating it here for what it is, not according to my personal tastes. I know it's a good beer for those who are into the IPA style, and it deserves at least a 4/5. Love it or hate it, it is what it is, and there isn't anything ""bad"" about this beer, it just depends on the palate.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The head lingers wonderfully and gives it a classical pale ale type look with a nice white foam. Smell: gives off a very strong nice centennial hop aroma with notes of bitterness and citrus. Strong hop smells linger. Taste: Medium bodied with a decent alcohol presence up front. Finished quite smooth and also gives a citrusy and bitter feel on the pallet. Mouth: Pretty dry with a bitter feel. The carbonation definitely isnt overwhelming like in some IPA's and sits well in the pallet. Overall: Great beer. Gotta be in my top 5. All around the board you cant poke anything wrong with this beer. Very well balanced and not overwhelming for an IPA.

S- A surprisingly strong aroma when being poured and through the foam on top. centennial hops, Somewhat fruity, lemons and orange. But very skunky in a nice way. A very sweet smell coming from this one and it has a rather light characteristic. T- Some fruit skunkyness on the way in. A surprising alcohol presence but only every so often. Not very bitter for an IPA. This really has a lot of taste characteristics similar to a gold ale or lager. M- Not a lot of bitterness from the hops and a very light/easy to drink quality. Goes down smoother then smooth and rather refreshing. O- I have had this a long time ago and remember it being better then it is. Id like to think that its because I got an old bottle but its less then 2 months old. Having said that, its a good beer, more along the lines of a pale ale then an IPA in my opinion.

There is a bitterness that I will describe as ""satisfying"" that lingers with the piney taste.  M- Soft carbonation, if that makes sense. It's in there, but isn't sharp. Feels smooth in the mouth.

S - Lovely citrus hop aroma with some piney hops and sweet malts in the background.  T - Follows the nose - intense citrus flavors followed by a bready malt backbone. This beer makes me smile when I drink it, which is rare. For a more 'mass-produced' IPA, this sets a standard that is hard to beat.  M - Great carbonation. Creamy and crisp. Perfect for an IPA.  O - When I first tried this I didn't like it, but my palate was not used to good beer yet. IMO Bell's is one of the best mico-breweries in the USA, and as this is their flagship brew it is highly recommended. This is the perfect IPA - not too complex, slightly bitter, but insanely refreshing. If you like this, check out Hopslam and the Expedition Stout.

287,1093,seedsofchaos,4.17,Low carbonation. Light amber. Honey straw. Two Hearted starts with a decent head and keeps solid lacing throughout. Malt bouquet profiles bready malts. Biscuity. Tropical hop aromas. Mango. Hints of sweet melons. Flavor is hop forward but not so much as to be tipping the scales one way or the other. A decent balance for the style overall. Medium-bodied. Sweet malt accentuates citrus-centric hops. Cascade and Centennials play their hand for sure. Caramel and toffee flavors as well as a bit of nuttiness blend in well. Great all-around beer that reminds one of a lawn-mower style beer.

Tastes sweeter than I would have expected again caramel is the predominent with some citrus undertones. Slightly dry and bitter finish.  Smoth and crisp mouth feel.

M/D: Medium bodied with good carbonation. Served too cold at this place, but can’t fault the beer for that.  O: Certainly a good IPA.

Head is off-white, 1 in, puffy, dissipates to 1 cm.  S: Big hops come off the nose with citrus notes and a malt base that gives some caramel and bread notes.  T: Big hop notes of citrus(grapefruit) along with some light floral notes. A touch of honey sweetness hits before the mild malt base. Aftertaste is a mild hop bitterness and light malt.  M: Medium body. Hops hitting first opens up the palate. Honey and malt hit, adding a bit of body. Mild hop bitterness on the aftertaste adds to the complexity of the beer and hits the edges of the palate. Semi-wet finish.  O: A classic. I have had this beer hundreds of times, but never written a review until now. This beer is very flavorful, packs a big hop punch, but is still mellow enough for the average beer drinker to enjoy.

The bubbles form a nice cascade effect rising to the head, as well.  S: Aside from the usual citric/piny hops, there's some sourdough breadiness alongside it, similar to what I got from Ranger IPA, but this has better execution.  T: Again, reminds me of a better-executed Ranger IPA. Starts off with a very nice maltiness to it with just the right hint of sourdough notes, plus some citric hops; and it finishes with a restrained piny bitterness. I like my IPAs to either have excellent balance, or rape my palate to kingdom come. This is very much the former...in fact, it's one of the most nicely balanced IPAs I've had.  M: A little thick body-wise, with solid carbonation. The finish is only slightly astringent.  O: When I first came on this site, I didn't like hoppy beers.

Some center hop haze swirling around.  Flowery hop aromas and a biscuity pale malt accent in there, too. Some apple skin and cherry blossom smells, akin to a spring day. The hops are also a bit leafy/grassy. Great Centennial profile.  Great balance! Good malt profile with some lemon cake notes (crossed with the hops). Nice floral hop with a mild but lasting bitterness level (I prefer more hop attack; but, this is nice, too). A touch of pine with some woodsy characters. Still picking up lemon as the lone citrus element, but it's pretty concealed.  Mouthfeel is perfect! Slick and juicy. Nice reminder that she's carbonated well, but not overly.

That's its defining characteristic, which makes tasting other flavors somewhat difficult, but across from a bit of sweetness, some fruit I can't identify (like a hint of grapefruit), something mineral-y. Delicious. Fantastic balance, robust enough to satisfy the back of your throat yet fairly easy drinking.  Aftertaste - A little sweetness on the lips, a tickle of sweet honey/fruit in the back of the mouth that lingers. Flloral/nectar-y fumes on the exhale.  M - More viscous than water, slightly carbonate-y on the tongue. Starts dry and finishes dry, just into the earliest stage of hop abrasion.  O - Very enjoyable.

I have tried this beer twice before this, and both times I experienced a metallic aftertaste that I did not like at all, even though I liked the rest of the beer experience- appearance, smell, initial taste, etc.  Third time's a charm, I guess. This bottle is not any fresher (from the bottled on date) than the last time I had one- about 3 weeks from bottled on date, but there is definitely a difference in flavor, and a welcome one.  Pours a somewhat hazy orange hue with a 1"" foamy white head that is gorgeous. Great looking beer. Lacing sticks to the glass all the way down.  Big nose of citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, and some flowery hops. Faint pine, resin. Wonderful smell.  This is a juicy beer, and it makes you salivate. Definite citrus up front that follows the nose. More citrus and malt in the middle, bitter hop finish, neither flavor outdoing the other. Pretty well balanced, although the hop bitterness does linger on the finish.

Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance - Nice dark off gold color with a big, dominant, creamy head. The head eventually wore off about halfway through the brew, with a some lacing present.  Smell - Nice floral smell with a fruit backdrop to it, with the addition of a definite hops presence. When I smelled this beer, I began to get excited about it. It smells fantastic.  Taste - The brew really comes through in this department. Perfectly, and I mean perfectly balanced between the fruity taste at the front and the bitter hoppy kick at the back end. I seriously considered giving this beer a 5 in the taste category, but I haven't done it yet and I'd like more experience before I do. But this is as close as any has come yet.  Mouthfeel - Balanced and smooth, everything about this beer is exceptional. Good carbonation, nice aftertaste, goes down so easy.  Overall - This is one impressive beer. Now I understand why it was so highly recommended by both personal friends and other BA's.

Hundreds and hundreds of bubbles flow from the bottom of the glass and provide a very lively look through a completely transparent beer. This one is pretty.  SMELL: This is how an IPA should smell, flowers and a little pine with some citrus lurking in the background.  TASTE: The thing I have always loved about this beer is how easy and sweet it begins, but how bitter it finishes. The flowers, pine and malt up front so smoothly slide into a citrus and hops on the back end. This is an easy IPA to fall in love with.  MOUTHFEEL: Smooth a little bit oily. As long as I have known this beer it has never had any sparkle to it, although, given the sweet and malty flavor I'm OK with that. This goes down easy.  OVERALL: I truly enjoy this IPA as an everyday standard, but overall I do believe it is overrated. If I did not have regular access to Modus Hoperandi from Ska (which, by the way, is a totally different IPA) I might rank it a little higher, but given that I have an equally delicious everyday IPA out here in Colorado, I can accept not having Two Hearted on a regular basis.

Smells of grapefruit, light citrus and hops.  Initial tastes of malts leading into hops, not bitter though. Finishes dry and makes you want to go back for more. Almost a light orange aftertaste. Great lacing left on the glass.  Would definitely go back to this APA again!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BeerDawgs,4.17,"A - A clear, golden pilsnerish color. 1 finger of head, and lace all over the glass  S - Citrusy hops! Nice hoppy smell, but not overwhelming  T - Like the smell, the citrus hops dominate. I love citrus hops. Nice grapefruit, piny aftertaste. Very well balanced. The balance gives it the 4.5.  M - Full bodied, and well carbonated  O - An excellent, well balanced IPA. I don't find it amazing, but very good",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DrewZ926,4.23,"A- rusty orange, great clarity, nice lacing and about an inch of eggshell head  S- pineapple, tangerine, citrus, a hint of pine  T- starts with grapefruit and sweet citrus and caramel malt, nice floral bitterness on the finish, very robust, lingering flavors  M- nice prickly carbonation, not too thin at all  O- a superb american ipa with near perfect balance. Hop profile is basically ideal, with ample tropical fruit notes and piney bitterness. Malt backbone is substantial and a great supplement. A real treat to try this one as I can't get it in my neck of the woods.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,elNopalero,4.6,"I’m marking my 300th review on BA with this write up on Bell’s Two Hearted. It’s a special treat for me. Even though I grew up in Kalamazoo I have spent my adult (beer drinking) in Texas and California—places where Michigan beers are not distributed.  Since it is now New Year’s eve I thought I’d share a story of last year when I shared some Two Hearted with my mother. She smelled it and said it smelled wonderful, just full of light citrus and grapefruit and floral aromas. … and then she tasted it. Her face soured and she handed it back to me. Of course I gladly took it back. That was probably the first and only time she tried an IPA. I love telling this story to friends, and especially about Two Hearted.  The Two Hearted I’m enjoying over the holiday break came from a six pack bottled mid-December so I know it’s fresh. Looks great, the color of golden-honey with nice clarity and a wonderful head of foam topping it. My mother’s aroma description still holds—floral, citrus pine with some grapefruit zest and spicy hops rounding it out. Tastes piney and bold with some resin. A bit of chew gives it heft, and there’s a pleasant hop bitterness but a sweetness from the excellent malt bill balances it out. Fantastic finish. And, incidentally, wonderful art on the bottle. Feliz año Nuevo!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Pour 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  poured a reddish amber with a white head of about and inch, beer is extremely clear.  big citrus nose with an under layer of grainy bread.  hop punch of citrus, finishing dry with a pleasant floral hop after taste.

I am a hophead, so I like citrus forward beers. However I usually don't like when orange stands out as the main descriptor. Some lemon and pine comes forward, with some marmalade back as the malt.  M- Nice and dry, the hops don't burn the tongue quite like I would hope.  O- Looking for more go to regularly available IPA six packs, I think Two Hearted is a good beer but there are better ones out there.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,VaterRoss,4.5,"Served on tap at Satellite.  Appearance is a clear amber with a normal sized head. Smell is of piney citrus hops, with an emphasis on pine Taste is piney with a slight lingering bitterneess. Bitterness is big but not bad. Quite refreshing actually, but with some weight. Carbed as one would expect.  O: One of my favorite IPAs, hits the highlights of the style, very representative. A bit more bitter than the average IPA. No noticeable difference between bottled and on tap.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S - Herbal hops with an fruity sweetness of honey, honeysuckel, and strawberry jam.  T - Slowly opens with a touch of honey before the doors open on a huge herbal hop center. The finish drops off into a lingering dry, floral, bitter backend.  M - Smooth, medium-light body with nice carbonation.  O - A solid IPA with a firm bitter character.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A- unfiltered cloudy golden with thick head  S-Big citrus and hops. no malt noticed  T- Liquid grapefruit. bitter and more bitter. some lemon or orange maybe  M- sticky and floral. herb taste hangs around  O- not bad but unbalanced IPA for me.

287,1093,DrDemento456,4.65,"A - A clear amber brown with a full inch of creamy white head. Lacing is also pretty nice.  S - Pretty much a citrus bound IPA I also get some gram cracker like malt keeping the hops in check from being to pine forward.  T - Actually better than expected the bitterness seems to be more balanced giving it a juicy fresh citrus and pineapple like bitterness which finishes with the typical fresh baked sweetness of caramel and gram crackers. It's finish is just bitter enough to make you take another sip.  M - Light to medium and not cloyingly bitter.

Nice malty sweetness at first followed by a mild hop bitterness that lasts for a short period of time. As it warms the hoppy notes linger on the back of your tongue.

287,1093,martyl1000,4.39,"Note to self: you do like this significantly more than Hopalicious. Not sure how much of that is the Centennial hops. Definitely more malt complexity than Hopalicious. [Hold on, Hopalicious isn't a fair comparison since it's actually an APA and since you're palate has become so much more hops-dominated, these days.)  HOWEVER: Surprised to like Hop Whoopin' so much more than Two Hearted  Gotta lower my orig. score of Two Hearted (4.54) and raise it for Hop Whoopin' (orig. 4.37)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Smells of pine, resinous hop with some sweet, bready malt sneaking it. Big pine aroma on this with hints of citrus. Really nice.  Taste is up front sweetness with some pine hop that leads into a more solid bitterness that ends on a sweet yet dry, pine, citrusy finish. Almost fruity finish. Slightly complex and completely tasty.  Lighter to medium body with medium-high carbonation with well-hidden alcohol.  This is a great IPA that focuses on the pine flavor with hints of dankness and citrus. It gains some complexity with a slightly sweet, bready malt character. All too drinkable.

287,1093,Treebs,4.38,"Had on tap at the Yardhouse in Glenview. Served in a pint glass.  A: Pours a slight hazy amber with golden yellow edges. A very bubbly one finger white head forms on the pour and leaves some sticky, splotchy lace down the glass.  S: Subtle citrus notes with some candied fruit sweetness mixed in for good measure.  T: This just explodes in my mouth and is definitely one of the sweeter IPA's I've ever had. Sweet pears and apples are present with a nice candied fruit and honey finish. Pale malts are present throughout, but take a back seat.  M: Medium to light bodied with a sweet and semi-bitter finish. It's come in and out like a nice little combo kicking my toungue long after the beer has left.  O: Even though this was sweeter than I expected it was never overpowering. Highly drinkable and another great go to beer when fresh.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Hophead717,4.12,"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a DFH Signature Glass.  A: Golden/light amber with a light haze and .5 finger head with only a little retention. Moderate amount of lacing.  S: Tangerine peel and light grapefruit in the nose, with little hints of floral hops. It's a rather nice smell, but sweeter than I'd guess from an IPA. I'd like a touch more hops.  T: There's the bitterness from the hops! Note overwhelming, but definitely there up front along with that strong citrus present from the nose. I'm getting a good mix of orange and grapefruit, which also adds a bit to the bitterness. I'm picking out the yeast a touch more than in most IPAs, but it's a nice, fruity strand. The aftertaste is a less pleasant bitter, which I believe I've noticed comes from the Centennial hops (I picked up on this in Founder's Centennial too). Though the aftertaste isn't that great, the body is fantastic, with the malt complementing the hops well. It turns into a quick sipper, if just to avoid the aftertaste. Well done overall, though.  M: Light to medium bodied, with good carbonation. Very drinkable.  O: A very good IPA. I had Two Hearted once before and was underwhelmed, but this was a very fresh bottle. I'll grab some again as a good, casual IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Poured from 12 oz. bottle into pint glass  Appearance is a hazy golden/yellow color and poured with a fluffy 1-inch head that dissolves into a top layer of foam that lasts the whole way down, leaving faint lacing throughout. I'm getting a floral and grassy scent, with a faint citrus note. There is also a nice scent of hop resins in there. Taste-wise there is a very nice, mild hop bitterness up front. I'm also detecting peach and mango. It leaves a faint hop bitterness on the tongue. The mouthfeel is just exceptional on this one. It is very mild and smooth, and has a sparkling effervescence to it.

Taste: A mild sweetness and light bready flavor with a very complementary hop bitterness finish.  Mouthfeel: Smooth with a medium to slightly heavy body; fine carbonation on the tongue.  Overall: An exceptional IPA. Well-balanced and great hop flavors and aromas.  My first introduction to Bell's Brewery beers several years back. This is a toss-up for me as far as choosing a favorite, as I find their porter to be an excellent beer, too.

T: Orange, grapefruit, then malt; slowly rising bitterness that neutralizes the preceding flavors, then subsides.  M: Low/medium body and low carbonation; smooth & creamy; neutral finish; slight alcohol warmth.

Serves me right... after realizing this is an awesome IPA, I also realize I can't get it here (get Bell's, but no THA).  A - light copper, very clear  S - beautiful, exactly what I want - bright, citrusy  T - just like the smell, VERY clean-tasting, citrusy hops  M - light, but not thin  D - If I could get it here, I would drink these all night.  EDIT: It's been two years since I first tried this beer and I've had the chance to try it multiple times and in comparison to a variety of other IPAs. As a whole, it's still a very nice IPA, but the overwhelming Centennial nose makes the beer smell cereal-sweet (i.e. fruit loops).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ummswimmin,4.17,"I picked this up while vacationing in Florida. It is funny that you can go much farther away from a brewery to try their offering... in other words, I would really appreciate it if Bell's would get their beer to New Jersey.  Now I'm off my soapbox. This is a very good example of an American IPA. The texture is very good. There is minimal bitterness in the after-taste.  Two Hearted smells good too. You get some pine, citrus, and some earthiness. It tastes very good, as well. This is one of the most drinkable IPA's I have had. If you see a bottle, then I recommend picking it up.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Little bit of pine, little bit of grapefruit. Mostly floral over a malt sweetness.  Good crisp taste. More pine hop in the taste. Butter behind the hop. Lots of malt holding up the hop. Caramel. Very even balance of different hops and malts. Fairly complex. Different from drinking a pure hop ipa but different in a good for variety way.  Nice creaminess for a single ipa. Good lingering hop taste.

Tons of fruit and one of the best, if not the best, smelling single IPAs I've had. Very well balanced with a slight malt backbone and not too strong on the hops and bitterness, but they're there and enjoyable. Good mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  This is the IPA I go to the most. Does nothing perfect for me, but it does everything extremely well. By that I mean I prefer the smell of Flower Power, the taste of Ruination, etc but this does everything almost perfect. Not too expensive, which is always a plus in my book.

287,1093,augustgarage,3.95,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. Bottled on October 20th, 2011.  Pale, nearly clear saffron/sunglow liquid topped by a persistent soft raft of off-white merengue. Superior retention, soapy slippery lacing.  Vibrant, clean, brisk hop aromatics suggest oranges and grapefruit along with a hint of spice.  Dry moderately bitter flavor profile is clean, malty, with a big dose of pure, somewhat generic-tasting hops. Well balanced, and quite suitable with food. The ABV is just high enough to slow you down but never overwhelms the palate.  Medium-light bodied, well carbonated, and crisp.  Very well crafted, expertly executed example of the style, though decidedly unexciting.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,PerHops,4.03,"I've had an on again, off again relationship with this beer. It was the first IPA that made me fall in love with the style. I claimed it was my favorite for a few years, until I moved out west and discovered some others. I than fell back in love with it, only to write it off for other IPAs from the midwest. When it comes down to it, however, this is neither my favorite IPA or a bad one, at that. I will always be a fan of this for being one of the first american IPAs to be a solid example of this style",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,troysoy2,4.07,"Poured into a pint glass, this is a nice looking beer. Impressive inch-tall head, frothy, nearly white. Decent retention, and nice patchy lacing. The body of the beer is a little light, but not out of the ordinary for an IPA.  The smell is where Two Hearted Ale shines, in my opinion. It's very light and floating. Floral, with a decent amount of citrusy hops and a light malt background. Very enticing.  The taste, while good is just not what you come to hope for after having taken in the smell. It's a good, full flavor. Not terribly hoppy for an IPA, and in fact hop bitterness has taken on a bit of a secondary role, allowing some fruity, malt flavors to come out. The mouthfeel is nothing to get excited over. Lightly carbonated and a bit thin. Just enough to tickle the taste buds.  All in all, I really liked this IPA. It's a nice alternative to your usual hop bomb. Very drinkable. If only they could get the taste to live up to the smell... Then I'd have something to really talk about!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Very good retention, eventually leaving a thin but noticeable white film. Good lacing.  Very aromatic. Smell has lots of juicy, sticky citrus. Grapefruit, orange, more. Rather floral. Nice enjoyable smell.  Tastewise, the beer is very good but not quite up to the nose. Grapefruit, lemon and orange, lots of citrus. Malt backbone has a bit of caramel to it. Finish is bitter and dries out the mouth a bit. The bitterness is very well integrated- complements the flavours of the beer rather than overpowering them.  Moderate carbonation, very nice small bubbles. Medium bodied, sticky feeling.  Overall, a very enjoyable beer. Lived up to the hype for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,nubz77,2.98,"Golden hued with a decent head. The smell is decent with lots of citrus varieties, the hops definitely make themselves known. Carbonation is right on par.  The only problem is it tastes like I'm drinking a floral arrangement. I've heard lots of people use 'grapefruit' to define hop flavors but I've never tasted more than just hints of that until I had this beer, and my god is it pungent. There are hops all over the place, but it's just too flowery for my palate.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Guden,4.07,"A- Pours a very clear coppery gold with a nice two finger creamy white head that sticks around and leaves thick lacing.  S- Sweeter than I expected with aromas of cake, pineapple, caramel, pine, biscuits, vanilla and lemon. Wow.  T- Not nearly as complex as the nose suggests. Lightly sweet bready malt leads on the tongue but piney and grapefruit like hop flavor quickly takes over with a strong, but not over the top, bitterness in the finish.  M- Thin and a bit prickly this seems like the standard for IPA's though I wouldn't mind a little more fullness.  D- It's tasty and is definitely right on point for an IPA but I'm a little let down that the complexity in the nose is lost in the flavor and it ends up being nothing more than good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S: Some bready malts and floral hop notes. Slightly sweet as well.  T: The bready notes come out up front and then the floral hop notes take over. The finish is slightly bitter and floral.  M: Moderate body and moderate carbonation. Slight prickliness on the tongue but overall nice and smooth and slightly creamy mouthfeel.  Overall this a very nice floral IPA.

287,1093,TheBigBoy,2.6,"Out of 12oz bottle. This two hearted beer one broke my heart. I had heard much about this beer and expectations were perhaps too high. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Just too much of thick and hearty beer for my palate. I do enjoy other Bells Beers (Best Brown, Hopslam, etc.)which work really well for my tastebuds. Obviously this beer is a crowd pleaser, just not my type of brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BeerNoobNC,4.3,"This beer is probably the most widespread and available beer on the top-rated IPAs list. It is still hard to find though, with everyone scooping up bottles whenever they are available and places rarely having it on-tap when I order it. I guess it is one of the most popular craft beers in the country. I finally got my hands on a six-pack from Total Wine sitting on the shelves. The stuff moves so fast that I wasn't worried about it being spoiled.  The beer poured the same as most IPAs: a copper, transparent color with a nice whitish foam head. The smell is citrus hops. The taste is the same. There doesn't seem to be a complex mixture of hops, but it has a good amount of hops (though not that hoppy). It has a really citrusy flavor from the hops and is very easy to drink. I could easily drink these all night, and it has a pretty good ABV for how smooth it is. I definitely recommend this beer if you can get your hands on it, but it is not worth stressing about trying if you are a huge hop head that appreciates big hop flavor. It is a pretty good IPA, but still not the best that I have tried in my short time as a beer nerd.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,VncentLIFE,5,"Really my go-to beer, whether its cheap or not.  Beautiful one inch head that retains. Light golden body.  Smells of a sweet balance between a nice citric hop and honey malt. God I love Bell's malt bill. Cascade hops are everywhere.  Balance is really the key here. Those citric hops are there, but theyre kept in check by a slick, honey malt bill. The difference is that the citric hops are just another flavor in the plethora of flavors.  Sits very light with a medium body.  Fantastic. As usual.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Caterwaul,5,"L: Somewhat cloudy brass body, two-finger bone-white head. good retention.  S: Beauuuutiful. Perfumey floral and citrus hop notes. You can smell it at arm's length. Just gorgeous.  T: Perfect level of sweetness with just enough bitterness to balance it. The finish is plenty dry, but with just enough flavor remaining to invite you back in.  M: Amazingly smooth. The carbonation is present and effective, but unobtrusive.  O: This has got to be one of the best American IPAs out there today. A helluva quencher with lots of flavor. Try it with spicy foods.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,uustal,4.4,"Pours a pale orange with a slight pearl white head. Good lacing and the head sticks around as well. Sweet caramel and grapefruit aroma, a bit of pine on the back end as well. Awesomely balanced and big flavor profile. This one would be a hop bomb if not for the perfect amount of sweet malt and vice versa. Silky smooth grapefruit starts off the hop profile and leads into the tasty caramel and sweet bread malt. Perfect amount of sweetness for an IPA, sweet without being too noticeably sweet. Strong pine flavors give a quick, crisp hop finish to the beer.

The smell and taste were not as strong as my favorite pale ales but the citrus and pine notes were there that make this a very solid PA. This beer obviously has gotten very high ratings on this website and although I don't think I can give it an ""A"", it is a solid offering of this style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,brian44556,4.03,"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Southern Tier Tulip. Bottle dated 10/12/11.  Pours a hazy, dark orange with a thick, white head. The head stays afloat almost through the whole beer. As small portions of the head do fade away it leaves a thick, sporadic lace on the sides of the glass. Strong piney aroma is about all I get, but that is all I need from a good IPA. Slight bitterness from the hops with a sweet malt finish. This has a great crisp finish and carbonation is spot on. Great, readily available IPA that is definitely one of my go to beers year round.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TheMultiYeast,4.22,"Hazy golden yellow with a small white head and layers of lacing. Nice retention.  Lots of spruce in the nose with fresh herbal hop notes and some citrus. This beer has a signature cotton candy smell for me..definitely some malts to balance things out.  Earthy hops are prevalent with a nice mix of spruce and citrus notes, loads of lemon and light grapefruit flavor. Hints of tropical fruits, pineapples, pears..balanced bitterness that works well with sweetness  Smooth carbonation, very drinkable.  Always a go-to for me. Solid No-Coast IPA",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,rmcnealy,3.92,"Served chilled in a traditional pint glass.  Poured a light amber that was very transparent being totally filtered. The head was slight off white and very froathy! It faded to just a skim on the surface with a consistent, dense ring around the glass. The first smells reminded me of opening a bottle of detergent or soap. It was popping with hints of floral, slight citrus and hop! A very unique smell, for sure. It tasted crisp and fresh and finished clean with just a slight bitterness. 7% abv? I couldn't tell. Well hidden with a robust floral taste. Great beer. Highly enjoyable.  Enjoy!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,milwaukee512,5,"The reigning champ of IPAs brewed east of the Mississippi, Two Hearted never disappoints. Looks and smells as good as it tastes; full-bodied IPA but never too bitter.

287,1093,tony223366,4.24,"Thanks to jzmaxson27 for trading me this beer!  A: Wow. Props to Bells' for this beautiful single IPA. It has a hazy orange/amber color with three plus fingers of foamy, rocky white head. It's enormous and has great retention. Very dramatic lacing goes down my entire SA perfect pint glass.  S: Getting some clean piney hops. Not a whole lot else. Wish there was something more appearing in the aroma.  T: One sip and I can see why this beer has such a following! Great piney hops followed by a more floral hoppiness. Big pale malt backbone that adds a great flavor. This is followed by some decidedly yeasty flavors that I wasn't expecting at all! Great bitter finish that isn't too bitter at all.  M: Very well carbonated and creamy. Medium body.  O: This is one of the most balanced single IPAs I've ever had. I love that you can taste all of the components. Hops, malt and yeast all make an appearance. This is extremely clean and drinkable.

287,1093,nmbr0ne,4.01,"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass.  Appearance: Golden orange color with a nice white head. Diminishes into a nice amount of lacing along the glass and top of the beer.  Smell: It's disappointing to say the least because I don't get that much hops. Very faint citrusy and piney notes.  Taste: Ahhh, this is where the hops are. It has a citrusy hop taste to it, but piney hops are the dominant flavor here. Very nice balance with a slight sweetness towards the finish. There is a final touch of bitterness to it also that disappears quite quickly.  Mouthfeel: Smooth. Great carbonation. A definitely mowing-the-lawn beer.  Overall: This was my first time having this beer, and I have to admit I'm kind of disappointed. I heard great things about this IPA, but it left a little to be desired. It's still a very good beer. Very good, but maybe a bit over-hyped in my opinion.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,david18,4.35,"I was recently at a World of Beers in Orlando that boasted 100 draft beers and 300 bottles. More importantly they had numerous beers distributed to Florida that were not available in New York. Bell's Two Hearted was the first one I tried. I'd been hearing so much about it and everything was right. It was great!  Appearance was typical of an IPA. Light orange/pale. Nice carbonation, somewhat hazy. Very inviting looking.  Aroma was very hoppy with both a pine as well as citrus character. You could also get the malt afterwards. Overall a very inviting aroma.  The flavor was as good as the aroma with a great mix of hops and malt. A great combination of bitter, flowers, malt and alcohol made this one of the best balanced IPA's i've had.

287,1093,climax,4.08,"Finally getting around to review this hyped up IPA. It pours a shiny new penny copper with a solid foamy head. Clarity is excellent, lacing and head retention are equally as pleasing to the eye.  Sweet and tangy passion fruit and pineapple notes fumed from the beer as I popped the top. After the pour it seemed more balanced but never too heavy on the malt. A floral bouquet and the previously mentioned pineapple flavors comprise of the hop bill.  The taste is exceptionally smooth beginning to end. Nothing assaults the taste buds, but everything is in harmony. The flavors almost seem to jump out more in the finish; grassy floral tones, mango, and a dash of pithy grapefruit emerge after the beer has evacuated. The malt backbone has a substantial toasty presence with a surprising amount of yeast detectable, but it sits so politely in the background as not to disrupt the hop display.  Carbonation adds only a smidgen of crispness to the extremely slick feel. It's very smooth but maybe lacking just a bit of body IMO. Despite a minor dent in the mouthfeel dept, I must remember that this beer has been in my glass for 5 minutes and I only have one drink left. Needless to say it's a solid example, and it doesn't need another review to solidify it's reputation.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Pours a golden orange color with a fluffy, 1 and a half finger off-white head. Head doesn't reduce by much. Literally stays at about a finger for the duration. Nice, foamy lacing clings to the glass.  Nicely balanced nose. Some grapefruit and citrusy hops are here but neither is too strong. Maybe some slight piny hops but they are faint too. A caramel sweetness rounds it out nicely.  Taste follows extremely closely with the nose but is a bit stronger. Plenty of hops but not overdone. Great citrus and slight grapefruit notes mix nicely with some caramel malt sweetness. There is a lemon-like bite, but only at times, towards the moderately bitter finish.  Very crisp with a lighter body and higher carbonation. Leads to a lighter mouthfeel. Moderately bitter with an extremely dry finish.  Overall, a nice IPA. It's a nicely balanced with crisp, clean flavors. I'd love to get a fresher bottle to try.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Jenkster4,4.45,"A: Pours a pale golden color. Its pretty clear and has a foamy off white head of about 2 fingers. S: Floral hops, nice citrus notes, some earthiness to it as well. Mainly the citrus hops i.e. grapefruit, orange, and maybe slight lemon zest. Just a tad bit of the malts in the nose, but it's definitely hop forward, and I LIKE IT LIKE THAT!! T: Deliciousness. So much sweet citrus notes right off the bad. It's like a orange and grapefruit meddling that just tastes so damn right. There is just a right amount of malts to even it. It's not overly bitter, which makes it very east to drink. Just damn good. M: Nice carbonation. I'd say its a medium body. Leaves a sweet juicy aftertaste and then you get the dry finish. Overall: A winner in my books. One of the best American IPA's I've tasted. Just extremely balanced and drinkable.

287,1093,ThePorterSorter,4.12,"Appearance: Relatively light amber IPA with a thin white head. There is plenty of carbonation and relatively thin lacing.  Smell: Super floral, grapefruity hops! This is definitely my kind of IPA. There is a little sweetness, but mainly resiny hops.  Taste: Quite pungent hoppiness followed by a light floral sweetness. There isn't anything that specifically stands out about this IPA, but it's dangerously drinkable.  Mouthfeel: This is where this beer stands out, with its delicate and floral hops carried through a salivating and fruity bitter aftertaste. The carbonation is on point and the beer is sufficiently sweet to balance the beer's bitterness.  Overall: Delicious beer with pungent aromatic hops and sweet body. I'm definitely glad to finally try this beer, it's even better than hopslam in my opinion!

I got a very citric, grapefruit hop smell from this one, and the hoppiness is apparent in the taste as it has some bite to it. Late in drinking, once it has warmed up, its alcohol content becomes more apparent.  Almost surprisingly, the beer goes down easy because of the fairly light character it has.  This is a pretty standard beer of mine, fitting with a love of hops. It can be in your face and the taste lingers, so be prepared.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The taste was of rich malt with a heady mix of peach and floral hops. The feel was medium and wet. Having read all the devotionals to this beer on here over the years I was eager to have one. Finding myself at a bar in Dublin OH that had this, I was ready to give it a try. The aroma and taste were really much more than I had expected.

T-Very sweet, lots of citrus flavor with a bit of pine. M-Fairly light, good carbonation, not at all a heavy beer. Overall, a good IPA but very sweet. I love balance in an IPA but this is just a bit too sweet. It's a combination of the very fruity hops and the inherent sweetness of the beer.

287,1093,Pintofbrown,4.25,"I had this on tap at Blackstone.  App- A gold and amber body that is clear with some lazy bubbles. It has a half-finger of white cap.  Smell- This one has some citrus notes, mainly grapefruit and some orange or lemon. The pine is also a nice addition, maybe some biscuit malt in the nose too. It is subtle, but pretty complex.  Taste- This is definitely not the most hop forward IPA I have ever had. The hops are citrus in nature, grape and passion fruit. And again, that wonderful piney note is also very present into mid drink and the finish. What I think is well done is the well added malt character. They blend great with the hop finish.  MF- This one is really creamy and medium bodied. One of the best mouth feels you could possibly hope for in a good IPA.  Overall- In the end, this IPA sacrifices being aggressively hoppy to get the malt to smooth out the mouth feel and make this beer a really easy drinker. This is a fantastic IPA and one that should be readily available in any hop-head's fridge.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

This beer is enjoyable because it is complex, but it lacks the body I like in an IPA.

The appearance of the beer is a beautiful deep, hazy gold with a white head. The beer has some of the most beautiful lacing.  The aroma is dominated by pine resin. There is subtle grapefruit. The malts are presant in the nose, but overpowered by the hops.  I cannot express my respect for the taste of this beer. A perfect example of an American IPA. Piney, malty, creamy and smooth. Some citrus, but not alot. This baby is perfect for a summer bbq or sitting in front of the tv watching football. Full bodied and just wonderful.

Reminds me a bit of Dales Pale Ale that i've been drinking recently, but with a more subtle hop smell to it.  T: Well blended and smooth drinking beer. The hops are there, but are mild, and goes down easy. Has a good healthy bit of spice to it, but in a good way. This is the type of beer would be GREAT for a growler and drinking a lot of.  M: Medium body and mild carbonation  O: A good pickup for a growler. This would be a good pickup for a tailgate or drinking in large quantities as I did. Goes nice from a growler, but I suspect this beer is a tad more complicated than it tastes coming from a keg. Perhaps from a bottle you can pickup on some more tastes.

There's an interesting sweet/hop oil taste immediately, followed by the grapefruit/pineapple and a bit of pine needle taste on the way out. There's a nice malt base that supports the beer. This is really complex. I don't know what varieties of hops they used in this one, but they give the beer a unique, interesting taste.  M: Crisp, medium body with medium carbonation.  O: Yum.

Pours cloudy, but clarifies into a mostly translucent hard amber-- by which I mean the amber that entombs certain prehistoric insects. An ivory, two finger head is produced that leaves no sticky lacing.  Lightly carbonated.  The fruitiness and sweetness are incredibly prominent, and I really have a hard time believing this is an IPA-- but that IPA bitterness is very much there at the end, and provides an interesting and welcome contrast to the first flavors. The flavor system present in this beer is incredibly complex, and while it can easily be downed in a few gulps, it really must be savored to be truly appreciated.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

More so than many other IPAs I've tried, this one has a very clear and distinct grapefruit and pineapple dominance. The flavor was very big with Tart fruits and flower petal, along some malt present with the hop bitterness. I want to emphasize that the bitterness is really turned up on this one, especially in the finish. The mouth feel is 'sticky.'

M - Creamy and well-carbonated. Slick texture.  Overall - I'll give some bonus points here for drinkability, as it hides the alcohol very well. It's a solid IPA for sure. It's not as bitter as some, which is a bit of a change of pace. There's still a lot of flavor going on, and (IMO) the malt is balanced.

A one-finger white head lasts for some time, leaving some lacing around the glass.  Classic IPA aroma, with a very solid hop profile. Piney, floral, grassy hops combine with citrus fruits. This is a sweet-smelling IPA, but not cloyingly so and quite unlike a typical East Coast IPA.  Like the aroma, the taste is straightforward and spot-on. The hops impart a delightful sweetness, with a melange of citrus fruits in full bloom. I get a boatload of papaya from the taste, almost like eating a bag of dried fruit. Definite, pronounced bitterness, but the fruity sweetness takes center stage.  Mouthfeel is really excellent, with a medium to high level of carbonation. Eminently drinkable.  A pretty archetypal single IPA, this would be a staple in my fridge if I had ready access to it. In any case, this is fantastic on tap.

Taste: lots of Centennial hops storm the palate.. pleasantly bitter with citric undertones.. grapefruit perhaps? Malt body maintains it's accountability by keeping this one somewhat balanced.  Mouthfeel: some sharpness on the front of the tongue; nicely carbonated.. medium bodied with a dry finish.  Overall: For some reason, I didn't really care for Bell's Two Hearted Ale the first couple of times I tried it. My palate must have changed because I really enjoy it now. In fact, it's very comparable to Founders Centennial IPA (though Two Hearted would have to get the edge). I like the fish label and Hemingway reference as well.. one of the best beers to enjoy outdoors bar none!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,GRBrew,4.13,Had this with dinner tonight at the Winchester.  Came out with a big two inch head on it that lasted the entire beer.

287,1093,KomodoDragon,4.49,"A - Poured this cloudy sunset brew with a larger snowy head brew into a Bell's anniversary pint glass. Lots of sporatic lacing, carbonation bubbles, and a touch of sediment.  S - Pine, Citris, Apple. Anxious to dive in.  T - Biscuity with sweet fruits, bananna, and mild nut flavors. NW hop finish. Well balanced and extraordinarily crisp. Alcohol present but no dominant. Everything I want out of an IPA  M - Creamy, smmoth, perfectly carbonated.  Unique in a good way. As good as an IPA can get.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,HopHeadRyan,2.99,"A - hazy golden, quick to disappear head  S - Tropical fruits, pineapple juice, maybe a hint of flowers/pine, a little too much fruit-juicy sweetness for my liking  T - Astringently stinging citrus fruity bitterness, not quite balanced out by the malt character. A little less balanced than I would have thought from such a popular IPA.  M - medium to full body, syrupiness, stinging astringency, not great. A little alcohol boozy warmth noticed at the end of the finish.  Overall - A very tropical IPA. I'd like to have this one tap and fresh and see if it makes the cut. I've had it many times before but this is my first review. Definitely not a bad ipa and one I'm sure I'll have again, just not as astounding as its hype!

287,1093,hmf05,5,"Pours a clear deep gold that leaves a two finger head. The aroma is candied oranges and pineapple. Smells floral, sweet, bitter, and delicious. The taste is perfect. Starts of slightly bitter but a nice caramel sweetness comes in to balance it out. Not too sweet, yet not too bitter. Perfect balance. I get mostly citrus wrapped in caramel candy. Drinkability is extremely high. This is the best single IPA I have ever had, granted I live in Florida and do not have access to most California and other west coast IPAs. The perfect beer in every way. Great for noobs, great for hop heads, and great for those who are looking to get into IPAs.

Smells of citrus and floral hops, some carmel malts as well. Very clean and plesant smell.  Tastes of carmel sweet malts at first, some floral and citrus notes half way through and then a slight piney lingering bitterness. This is balanced for my tastes with the firm sweetness in the beginning.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fizzy prickly feel on the tongue.  Overall this is a very solid IPA, a good hop nose and taste, a touch of alcohol and a good firm sweetness keeps this in check. $10 a sixer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Goblinmunkey7,4.15,"Appearance: Deep hazy gold. Head is white, creamy, and fluffy. Solid lacing without going too crazy. Carbonation is on point.  Smell: Lovely floral hops greet the nose over a solid malt body. Sweet biscuity malts. A touch of caramel thrown in for good measure. Hops pull a little pine and grapefruit, but it's all incredibly well-balanced on the nose. A touch of something that smells like cotton candy. Nice toasted malts.  Taste: Toasted biscuits wrapped in flowers. Incredibly floral. A touch of citrus rind brings out an oily hop flavor that managed to go unnoticed on the nose. A touch sweet, but layered with hops. A nice balance plays out as the beer warms. It's always a touch sweet, and a ton floral, but nice hints of pine and grapefruit punch through on occasion and make things interesting.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, a touch dry, and carbonated perfectly. Body is moderate and carries everything well. A touch of creaminess as well.  Overall: I could drink this for days, all of them, forever. The balance and flavor profile are fantastic. It's not the best of the style by far, but damn if it's not one of the best drinking IPAs on the market.

In the back there is a bit of a sweet caramel malt thing.  T: it starts up with a nice caramel sweetness. Followed by lots of grapefruit and a little kick from pine. The finish is more citrus, and a touch of sweet malt. There is a touch of alcohol, but not much.  M: Medium in body, with plenty of carbonation. There is a bit of a drying quality to the finish of it, which contrasts a bit of an oily resin it leaves in your mouth. Certainly interesting.  O: Overall a very enjoyable beer.

S: This beer smells quite floral and citrusy. You can really smell the malt body on this one.  T: Balance is the key word here. There is a perfect amount of hop bitterness across the palate, but it is not overwhelming due to the beefy malt load. The malts taste bready, buiscuity, and almost buttery. The hops are very floral, a bit of pine, and a nice dose of citrus. A really fantastic hop blend. It finishes slightly dry and with lemon citrus left on the tongue.  M: Medium with solid carbonation. Very smooth.  This is a fantastic beer, no doubt about it. I've had it plenty of times, and I still keep coming back to it.

Amazing retention.  Flavor: This one is as bold as it smells (thankfully!). Sweet caramel and pale malts, followed by citrus hops. Grapefruit. Turns pine at the aftertaste, but some of the malt sweetness remains.  Mouthfeel: Medium body. A bit astringent due to the heavy dose of hops, but it's not unpleasant.  Overall: Impressive.

Good looking film on the sides that circled all the way down the glass.  Smelled of citrus and floral hops. Good balance.  Similar to the nose, a citrus and sweet, floral taste led the way. It wasn’t as hoppy as I thought, but did end in a lingering bitter finish.  Medium body. Average carbonation. Smooth all the way through.

Similar to the smell, but the hops are the star here. One of the most satisfying regular IPA's I've ever had. The bitterness is dominant and smooth, but this is more noticeable on the finish than the beginning. It lingers. The malts are a little bit more noticable here. I love the tropical nature of this beer.  Smooth, silky, luscious medium body. Tingling carbonation.  Reminds me of Racer 5, but more smooth and less aggressive.

287,1093,Alieniloquium,4.08,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  Appearance - Very slightly hazy deep golden body with a small head. Nice lacing, though.  Smell - Not a huge hop aroma, really. A bit of a musty smell behind some citrus hops, followed up by a slightly sweetness.  Taste - The hops are way more prevalent here. Good balance of pine and citrus that ends with a flowery sweetness. The malt backbone is just enough to balance it, without coming off as sweet. A strong bitterness finishes it off, but it isn't too much to be unpleasant.  Mouthfeel - Easy-drinking, although on the heavy side for a single IPA. This bridges the gap to DIPA, I'd say. A bit more an it would be a DIPA.  Overall - One of two go-to IPAs in my area.

Poured a deep gold with about a quarter inch fizzy head, pretty decent lacing.  Starts off light in the taste category for a brief moment, then boom. The hops have arrived. I would say this is the most bitter beer I've had. The finish is almost all cascade hops, with their usual pine taste.  Overall, not a bad one paired with food.

Some faint lacing.  Smelled of a floral- mildew, not unlike a bathroom towel. This sounds remarkably unpleasant, but I was more interested in it than I was really put off.  Floral in the mouth, richly layered and surprisingly complex given the high drinkability. Sessionable and clean.  Mouthfeel consisted primarily of a light airiness with a good degree of lightly supportive effervescence. Crafted intentionally with flavor and drinkability in mind.

Even tough I'm beginning to get a cold, I smell a slight strawberry hint that seems earthy and sugary sweet.   One of the most well balanced beers I've tasted. The taste follows the aroma.  It is slightly sweet, hoppy (not over the top), and malty.  There are tones of pine, grapefruit, and strawberry and the end is a nice hoppy bitterness.   The beer is pretty dry and crisp.

Hops come in afterwards showing through as piney and slightly earthy.  M- Balanced, slightly bitter, slightly sweet, medium mouth feel. Magnificent.  Over all, I think I’ve found my go-to, easy to find, smooth drinking, reasonably priced IPA for my new home.

There's some opacity, but genereally light passes through.  S - Lots of grapefruit zest and little pine. No yeast esters of malt.  T- LOTS of prickly grapefruit. This tastes more like thick juice with pine needles than beer. That said, this is as ideal a beer as I have come by. There's some sweetness and pine bite providing further depth to the grapefruit flavor. The beer has some oilyness to balance out the perfectly dry finish. Overall, it's the same beer from the first whiff of the aroma to the last gulp down.  M - very clean and dry enough to be sessionable.  O - This beer is the hallmark of American brewing and the answer to the question why IPA's have become the halycon of beer styles.  Overall, this beer did feel like it had lost some of its edge since I last enjoyed it. While much of that might be owed to my expanding palette and my increased familiarity with IPA's, I place most blame on bottling.

Sweet caramel flavors with a nice balance of lemon and even a hint of blueberries.  M - Sticky sweet mouthfeel with very nice carbonation. Finish is a nice balance of sweet and bitter from the hops with a piney aftertaste mixed with oranges.  O - Very good IPA. I am having this a little late I think.

One of the creamiest looking heads I've seen on an IPA.  Nose: Its for a real malty backbone, a very citrusy front, and some hops sandwiched right in the middle. Pleasantly burns the nostrils.  Taste: For a beer that is so fruity in the nose, the taste is substantially less citrusy and quite a bit more dry. However, it is still very balanced. Right in the middle is a sweet moment before the dry, bitter finish. Classic. Its all held together by its malty backbone. Two hearts indeed!  Mouth: Even carbonation. Dances on the tongue. Dry in the back on the finish. Very smooth in the mouth...dry in the throat.  Overall: Two Hearted Ale really is a classic.

287,1093,bramsdell,4.3,"Poured from a bottle to a pint glass.  A: Deep golden body with a 1.5 finger white head. The head actually never fully recedes. I'm halfway through the whole thing right now and there is still a full, white head that remains. I am extremely impressed.  S: Wonderful. I am not a huge hop-head, but I am always willing to try something new. The first smell is that of the hops. A general hops scent, maybe a little piney, but nothing specific. The reason that this beer blew me away was the fact that I could smell the malts almost immediately. The secondary rush of smell is fantastic. The malt aroma is subtle, but it is thick, mild and almost roasted. The balance of smell is probably my personal favorite of any IPA I've had.  T: Well, the smell was wonderful...and the taste follows. Just like the smell, hops hit first, a little bitter, a little citrus-y. There is also a hint of pine in those first notes. However, there is none of the super-bitter feel that so many IPA seem to have these days. Hops are great, but a balanced beer is so nice, and this is a balanced beer. The initial hoppiness is mellowed out quickly by a richer malt flavor. The final flavor left on the tongue is hoppy, reminding the drinker that this is, after all, a full IPA.  M: Again, it's great. Light and crisp, for sure, due to those hops. However, the beer is thicker than the crispness would indicate. Also a nice level of carbonation.  O: Great beer. Nothing else need be said.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,falloutsnow,4.16,"Pours a nice 1.5cm off-white head composed mostly of very fine bubbles, occasionally interrupted by those of larger size. Head retention is excellent maintaining, about 0.5cm even several minutes into the beer. Lacing is likewise quite good and decorative. Body is a fairly light orange-copper in color, hazy, with active carbonation along the sides. This hits all the right buttons, visually.  Scent features very modest caramel and bread-like malt tones fairly subsumed by a minor deluge of grapefruit, pine, and very light grassy hop scents. Actually somewhat attempting balance, and overall quite nice.  Taste opens with fairly assertive grapefruit and pine hop flavors. This transitions to a little light malt sweetness mixed with grapefruit rind and general hop bitterness. This then fades to a finishing close with some lemon-like bitterness, almost almost almost lactic(!) like sourness. Aftertaste is of a biscuits, bittering hops, and some residual citrus and even tropical notes. Nicely done.  --note: in older bottles I've tried, much of the hop complexity has faded and what lingers is a generalized hop bitterness and citrus profile. While this is generic and harsher, it's still a fairly good taste for an IPA--  The beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied, right for the style, with moderate levels of carbonation (not too high or low). Finish is dry, slightly puckering.  A very nice American IPA, true to the style and satisfying to drink. Hits all the right spots, will look forward to trying again. I've had both fresh and a few months old, and the fresher you get this beer, the more enjoyable it is.

Plenty of bubbles dance to the top quickly. Some lacing as it is drank down.  Zesty grapefruit and lemon hit your nose first, then some residual bitterness from some piney hops. A little grassy as well. Some sweet fruits like pineapple and mango too, with a touch of cane sugar and honey sweetness behind the hops and fruit. Some earthy notes throughout.  Big citrus zest on the tongue at first, then moves into the bitter piney and grassy notes. Grapefruit zest, tangerines and grass are the most dominant flavors but with a touch of other fruits like mango and pineapple too.  Medium body with moderate carbonation. It's not spritzy like it should be by the looks of it. Some tongue drying bitterness on the finish that leaves a nice dry quench, but still a little sticky on the lips.  Great citrus and sweet fruit flavors with some tongue biting bitterness. One of my favorite go to IPAs that I can get around here.

T: hoppy to start - purely floral hops, lavender comes to mind - and a touch of oak. The alcohol is pretty subdued, too.  M: good carbonation and medium body.  This is my go-to beer at one of my favorite bars in town, and it definitely stands up to scrutiny. It might just be my poor sense of smell, but I'd like a bolder aroma. Two Hearted is a perfect, if dangerous, session beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ZenAgnostic,4.11,"Appearance - Big cream colored head with good retention. Hazy orange body.  Smell - Very mild hoppiness. Not much complexity while cold. Maybe when it warms... (waits) Yep. Warming up brought it to life.  Taste - Sweet. Hoppy. Moderate to high hop body. Balanced but no where near bland. Light sweet finish and bitter hop aftertaste. Slight astringency in the finish is somewhat masked by the short, thin sweetness of the finish.  Mouthfeel - Very hoppy bite. Lingering bite. Clean. Crisp.  Overall Drinkability - Best American IPA I've had so far. No real weakness.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Demer,4,"Pours a clear golden color with a a white head. Leaves behind a nice lacing after the head dissipates. The nose on this is piney grapefruit with some biscuit. Taste is more citrus and pine, but its balanced. Niether hops or bitterness dominate, its definitely a balanced beer. This is insanely drinkable. If Bells distributed to NJ I would always have this in my fridge.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,UCLABrewN84,4.17,"Thanks to kzoobrew for sending me this one!  Pours a hazy golden yellow-orange with a 1 inch puffy white head that fades to a film. Thin broken rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of fresh floral and piney hops and citrus aromas. Taste is of very nice floral/herbal hops, citrus juice/zest, and a malt flavor on the finish. Mild hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. A good level of carbonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good IPA that is very easy to drink. I enjoyed this one very much.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,tdm168,3.45,"Pours an orangish amber with two fingers of thick, foamy head. Great retention. Citrus notes dominate the nose; orange peel, grapefruit, pineapple. Bready malt character, citrus hops, orange peel, pineapple with a nice hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected, smooth and crisp; an easily drinkable IPA.  This is a good IPA, but the fruitiness far exceeds the bitterness, and the malt character is a little thin for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Adrianized,4.21,"Poured into a snifter  Pours a transparent yellow-orange with creamy white one finger head.  Nose is pretty light.  All I'm really getting is floral, tropical, and citrus hops; mangos, tangerines, and bananas.  Much more flavor than expected from the nose.   Big on tropical fruit; mangos and papayas, and maybe some fried plantains up front.  Balanced with a milky caramel malt in the middle, but a bit subdued.  Finishes surprisingly bitter with grapefruit and piney hops.  Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied with decent carbonation.  This is a very nice IPA with tropical notes and high bitterness.

287,1093,NWer,4.38,Updating from earlier review massively to the upside (first impressions aren't always correct): Beautiful pour into my Black Raven imp. pint glass. Abundant head that overpowers the glass. Foamy top retains well leaving nice lace as well as when I draw down during the drink. Nice golden color. Somewhat cloudy but not much. Sweet for an IPA but probably not by Midwest standards. Enough hop feel to satisfy but not overwhelming. Nice balance between hop feel and flowery malt flavors that make this a very enjoyable change from West Coast hop bombs.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Satchboogie,3.91,"12oz bottle dated 7/19/11. Poured into a Pint Glass.  A: Pours golden yellow, hazy, with almost a 2-finger tight white head with fantastic retention. Leaves a ton of lacing.  S: Light citrus hops with lots of floral notes and a little bit of pine. Slightly sweet pale malts. Interestingly enough I'm also getting a smell that reminds me of chapstick. Weird.  T: Solid punch of floral hops right up front with a touch of citrus and pine. I get a bit of a lemon/grapefruit and pine presence riding over the floral notes and hitting the back/roof of the mouth with a bittering rush. That intensity fades through the middle allowing the gentle floral notes and citrus to open up nicely and lead to a fairly mellow and clean finish. There's just a touch of sweetness coming out of the toasted malt base. Alcohol is well hidden, slightly bitter finish that's very clean and crisp.  M: Medium to slightly light body, moderate carbonation. Fairly resinous and sticky with a clean taste and crisp finish.  O: A very solid IPA that is impressively clean. I do prefer more citrus/tropical fruit in hop presence, but that's just personal preference. This does have good depth of hop character that has a nice mellowing-out character as the taste progresses. If this was available locally, I'd definitely be buying more. Great stuff.  Thanks goes to Pest for the awesome extra.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,lurpy1,4.08,"On tap at the Nuthouse in Lansing.  Pours a deep amber, little bit of head. Attractive beer. Citrus and floral aroma, a little bit towards the sour and acrid though.In terms of taste, this beer sort of triangulates - malt, hop, orange. Pretty tasty, nothing spectacular. The consistency is sort of oily/resiny, but smooth and pretty appealing.  Final verdict, real good everyday beer. At the end of the day this is a somewhat conservative beer, in that Bell's is not trying to hit a home run with it, just swinging for singles. But they've done a real good job, this unofficial scorer has marked it as a base hit, and a solid one at that.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,NeutroMan,4.23,"Cloudy amber color with a sizeable rocky white head that left excellent lacing. Smells of citrus and floral hops - a nice bouquet to complement the grainy malt (though the hops clearly dominate).  Citrus fruitiness cuts through the hops, which linger in the bitter aftertaste. Doughy, biscuity malts persist throughout. Crisp and clean with a medium body. An excellent pale ale.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,matthewb9,3.85,"Had this on tap at The Winking Lizard in Cleveland last week. I can't find it in New York, so I was highly anticipating this well-hyped beer.  A - Pours a nice copper orange with decent head. Nothing exceptional, but surely inviting.  S - Strong fruit aroma, but I couldn't help but notice a bit of staleness in the smell.  T - Very drinkable beer. Good balance between hop bitterness and maltiness. I was looking for a bit more of a punch in the face, but sadly, I did not get it.  M - Oddly light. I felt it was missing a bit of the complexity that typically accompanies beers of its status. Carbonation was standard for style.  O - It's a good beer, for sure. World-class? Meh.

S-The aroma is probably the most ""tropical fruit"" smelling beers I've had. The hops lend a very mango-like hop aroma to the beer. And I guess some mild fruity esthers from the yeast. Oh yes, and pinapples too! Very tropical. Great for a summertime IPA! T-Mirrors the aroma exactly with tuns of pinapple and mango fruit with a hefty yet very clean bitterness that every American IPA ought to have.

Smells like sweet, round citrus (orange and tangerine) layered over pine. Somehow these coexist together without really integrating; it's an interesting effect. Taste is more pine and flower forward, with the citrus almost absent, both of which mingle with some biscuity malt. Mild bitter finish. Medium bodied, with carbonation medium-high and having kind of a harsh feeling. Overall, a very solid IPA, great everyday beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TLJ,4.42,"Bell's Two Hearted Ale pours a beautiful caramel amber colour, with some lacing and very little head. The aroma is of apples and pine, with a hint of honey.  The first sip is very sweet in a highly floral way. The hop character kicks in somewhat late in the flavour, with a deepening rich bitterness, characteristic again of pine sap. I detect some vanilla and butterscotch, and, as the hops fade in the mouth, melted butter and bergamot.  As someone with mixed feelings about aggressively-hopped beer, what I love about this brew is that it doesn't shy away from a powerfully hoppy, although nuanced fragrance and taste while allowing for other, more subtle flavours to come forward.  This IPA excels at being both smooth and easy drinking, as well as bright, clean and refreshing. An all-around winner for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Pours a nice golden/ caramel color with a creamy head and some nice lacing.  On first smell it gives off a nice floral and citrus hop aroma. A little bit of orange peel and grapefruit to go along with it. Has a very nice malt backbone that rounds it out quite nicely. The flavor is just like the smell: floral and citrus flavors and a bit of sweet malt in the back. Has a medium mouthfeel and a good amount of carbonation.

Smell - Floral hops, grapefruit, and malt sweetness, really nice nose.  Taste - Yellow grapefruit, citrus, floral hops, nice crispness from the carb, and a slightly dry and bitter finish - alcohol perfectly hidden. *The sweetness of the malts picks up quite a bit as this ale warms, there was a muted, but definite carmel presence toward the end of the pint, which was very nice.  Mouthfeel - Lite to medium mouthfeel, Really smooth, perfectly carbonated, nice clean dry finish.  Overall - Really an excellent IPA, and a great representative of the style. Great flavors, and perfectly balanced. If you like a good malt backbone and some slight carmel with your IPA, let this one warm up to 50 degrees or so.

Well done... wonderfully hopped from beginning to end, without overtaking any of the other portions of the brew. Nice orange peel and grapefruit essence in the citrus dept. Very quaffable, as the citrus and malt combine for a perfectly round and smooth mouthfeel. Pine resin lingers in the finish, peppering the back of the mouth with a decent IBU. Again, the drinkability is very much the biggest ""pro"" of this brew. IPA’s are my fave (as are doubles and impy’s), and this one doesn’t disappoint.

Pours golden with a very slight amount of haze but pretty clear for the most part - one finger head holds its ground for awhile but falls leaving only a thin film atop the beer and some splotchy lacing on the glass. Smells very sweet and floral with a bit of earthy hops - slight sweet caramel takes the back seat. Very drinkable and refreshing and follows the nose well only more bitter than expected, delicious nonetheless. The mouthfeel is nice with a good amount of carbonation and, once again, easy to put down. This beer is something else, not as hoppy as one would expect but it is well balanced and calm.

I was prepared for a hop soup, not necessarily in a good way.  Taste: All hop up front, slightly overwhelming. A bit heavy handed to me. Not a lot of nuance. Bitterness follows through finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, well carbonated. Fine for the style.  Overall: It's a hop bomb. If that's your thing, it's your beer. Any nuance in malt character or secondary qualities are buried in the bitterness. There are some pleasant floral and citrusy notes in there, too. I couldn't drink more than one of these.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Brenden,4.5,"I had this beer, which I already love, on tap at the Bier Stube today.  The bubbly off-white head isn't massive from the tap (though the bartender makes sure to keep it that way) but has impressive staying power, never fading. Lacing makes a sheet on the glass and carbonation is lively. The smell, as from the bottle, is foremost some nice cirtusy floral hops. Clean and raw, the flowery, earthy and herbal hops are well balanced by a very soft malt with the main purpose, it seems, of balancing. The taste is to par with the aroma; first off comes a nicely balanced citrus and floral hops bitterness. Malts are light and some yeast give it a little bit of a firmer feel and some notes of grains. A dry finish lingers nicely, leaving notes of bitterness and a grapefruit-like citrus on the tongue. Again, the fresh rawness of the earthy, citrus and floral elements are key. The mouthfeel is great, medium-bodied with some nice lively, but not overpowering, carbonation. It's crisp and even feels a little thick without being heady. There's just a great mix of chewy, smooth and crisp in here.  I was no less impressed from the tap, naturally. Still a great IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Pine and grapefruit dominate the aroma, with tangerine and caramel in the background. Quite restrained for an IPA though I must say.  C-hop flavor dominates, lots of grapefruit and pine, balanced against a nice sweet pale malt and toffee. And that's it. Lots of citrusy hops balanced against caramel malt. But expertly balanced. Simple. Uncomplicated. Satisfying. Which is just how I liked my American IPAs.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very satisfying.  Just a topnotch IPA, all the way. Not sure I get what about it is ""two hearted"" or how that ties into the piscine motif of the label though.

287,1093,matttttYCE,4.12,"Appearance - Glassware used: regular pint glass. Head that rises up is 2 fingers high, creamy/fluffy looking, and white in color. Head sticks around for a while and stays fluffy looking. Lacing is nice and sticky on the glass. Color of the beer is a slightly hazy (probably chill haze) yellow golden.  Smell - Smell is very nice. Reminds me somewhat of Odell Myrcenary. Up front are the big grapefruit and orange/citrus hop notes. There's also some sugary sweetness that's reminding me a bit of Apocalypse Cow and the lactose sugar used in that one. Behind all that there's some pine, maybe a bit of floral hops, and some lighter biscuit and malt backbone. This is a very nice smelling IPA. I think I'd forgotten how nice it smelled.  Taste - Taste doesn't quite match up to the aroma in my opinion, but it's still a very good tasting IPA. There's a bit more pine / bitterness and floral hops in the taste than the nose seems to have gave off. Still, the dominant flavors here are citrus and grapefruit, working wonderfully with the bitterness, pine and floral hops, the sweetness, and the balancing malt and biscuit notes. This beer is quite good.  Mouthfeel - Feel is generally lighter than I expect for an IPA (and than I remember this beer being). Light and smooth consistency, light/creamy carbonation, light-medium body, and a nice moderate finish that leaves you with a bit of dryness and nice bitter hops.  Overall - I think I really had forgotten how nice and enjoyable Two Hearted is. It's even one of those rare IPAs that I'd consider sessionable while still being very full flavored.

A - Relatively clear bright orange/amber with one finger of white head with sticky, delicate lacing.  T - Strong hop bitterness upfront. Piney, grassy and earthy hop characteristics dominate. As the bitterness fades, a slight malt sweetness emerges, giving way to a lingering dry bitterness. As the beer warms, more fruity notes emerge as well as some alcohol.  M - Moderate body. Appropriate carbonation. Slight alcohol warming.  O - A good IPA.

The sweet and bitter work incredibly well here.  T: Slightly creamy , toasty roasty malt with an immediate sharp bitterness that kicks in after the sweet malt. The taste is very rounded, and ridiculously refreshing. It manages to be crisp and medium bodied at the same time, which I am always impressed by. Healthy dose of pine and grapefruit and rounded sweet malt. Nice hop oil and tingly tongue after a few chugs.  M: This beer does tackles the challenge of having a moderately medium thick initial feel , while still never tasting too round or dull in the mouth. The carbonation is perfectly crisp and the beer is utterly refreshing.  O: What a treat this beer is! I wish I could get this out east, but I'll have to just wait to revel in it upon my Midwestern homecomings. This would definitely be my every day IPA if it were available in NYC.

S: Citrus dominates the nose with orange rind and grapefruit. Cane sugar and biscuit malt notes are present as well accompanied by a hint of hop bitters.  T: The taste follows the nose. Grapefruit and citrus burst onto the tongue at the outset. Some malt backbone enters in the middle followed by some floral flavors and aggressive dry hop bitterness.  M: This is a light to medium bodied beer that is well carbonated and pleasant on the tongue.  Overall, this is an excellent IPA.

A: Gorgeous 2+ finger head from a hard pour into a standard pint glass, it exhibited an orange amber appearance that continued to bubble well after the pour. On the down side it only displayed some lacing which I found surprising after that frothy head.  S: Noticed a higher level of malts in this IPA than usual accompanied with orange citrus finished up with those beautiful floral hops. Was less pungent than other similar brews.  T: As the smell indicated, malts were more identifiable than most IPA's, which allowed this beer to be more subtle at first and a bit sweeter.

287,1093,RoamingGnome,4.12,"From notes on 8/5/11  Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A) A nice hazy orange. There is a solid inch of white head. The head has good retention and there is ample lacing.  S) A very pleasing citrus aroma, with hints of pine, and pineapple. There is also a bit of grass blending with the sweetness.  T) This starts with citrus sweetness, oranges and other tropical fruit. There is a nice transition to a balanced bitter finish.  M) Seems like a medium body. It's kind of sticky, just settles in on the palate. Good carbonation.  O) You pretty much can't go wrong with Two Hearted Ale. It is one to just keep on hand, because it always goes down easy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,GeorgeAldi,4.42,"On draft. This has the appearance of a solid pale ale: sturdy hazy copper, nice lasting, dense head. I really enjoy the floral aroma. It’s very fresh and exotic with plenty of rather pleasing outdoorsy scents. Flavor is quite well balanced between the peppery hops and smooth sweet malts, though still packs a little bit of a punch with bitterness. This is an enjoyable beer for almost any occasion.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bsu2005,4.86,"Bought a six pack of this beer at a local store, and was somewhat skeptical since I'm not a huge IPA fan. Wow! What a great beer! Not too much hop flavor, but just enough to give the beer a good taste and balance. Wonderful taste, color, and drinkability. This would be a great session beer, and will definitely show up in my cooler more often. Another great brew by Bell's!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,begforme4484,4.05,"Golden/amber in color, with a slight orange hue. Poured with a really heaving looking pillowy white head. It's a very unique looking head, very alluring. About 2 fingers width with heavy lacing left on the glass. The lacing clearly showed each sip taken.  Mainly floral hops in the nose, subtle hints of citrus. Nice bready malt tones as well.  Very well blended doughy malt with an earthen hop bite. A good amount of bitterness but not overwhelming or oily at all.  The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and medium bodied. Very nice.

Appearance: Beautiful deep gold to pale amber color (about 9 SRM) with a 1/2 inch white creamy head that diminished after a few minutes but still left a thing netting of lacing through most of the glass.  Smell: Wonderful aromas of delicious citrus notes (I especially picked up grapefruit) blended with a piney scent and strong hopped smell. Delicious.  Taste: Absolutely fantastically balanced beer. There is a strong taste of citrus that is counterbalanced by the pine that lingers until the hops come into the palate and leave me craving more and more. Hops are strong but not overpowering by any means. I was taken back by how well balanced the beer was.  Mouthfeel:Medium bodied, well carbonated, perfect for this American IPA.  Overall:This is the best beer I've had. I loved it and wished I could have had more. Definitely a beer I could drink several of, although at 7% abv, this one will catch up to you quicker than you expect. A delicious IPA that sets the bar very high in my opinion.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BeTheBall,4.47,"Poured a bronze, slightly hazy color, with nice active carbonation and lacing. Smell was of piney, hoppy, citrus heaven. The taste is about the perfect combination of bitterness and cirus flavors. Nothing about either is overwhelming, but the combination is perfect together. This is an IPA lover's IPA, one that you can drink many of, and will want to drink many of. Mouthfeel is outstanding. I just wish I could buy it in MA!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

This brew has a remarkably distinct head unlike any other beer. The head is uncharacteristically frothy, soft, snowy almost. Kind of awesome, lacing chased me down the entire glass every time..  Smell is hoppy and alittle piney, but this beer offers some floral notes to it that sets it apart. Taste is of the hoppiness but more notably the floral notes.  Mouthfeel is cozy with that pillowy head and medium carbonation. Overall, this, i feel, is one of bell's best brews. I wish I was closer to try more, more frequently!

Smells of both citrusy and piney hops. Even picking up a little pineapple. First sip is bitter but finishes malty. Mostly Pine, Lemon and grapefruit flavors.

You could find a hundred reasons to enjoy it every time you take a sip, drink it every day for a year and still not be satisfied, and spend the rest of your life trying to find something that will match it.  It is the beer that will remind you why you love beer in a way that you didn't even know was possible. It is the beer that will change the way you think about all of the beers you've had prior and the beer that will affect how you judge all of the beers you have afterwards.

The lacing that sticks to the glass won't even budge so it creates a web like look.  S: As soon as I cracked the bottle cap and heard the hiss I instantly got a sweet smell like plums and I didn't have to put my nose to the bottle. It came right to me.  T: Hops, more plums so I guess the sweet taste too.  MF: Sour which is fine by me. A sour kick just means to me that it isn't a ""boring"" beer. Sweetness lingers on the tongue as does the sour. It keeps me thinking and trying to find other flavors other than plums.  O: I'm not an IPA guy and I really like this. I can now see why so many other people like it.

Zesty citrus hops similar to the aroma with a malt background that is unrecognizable. Bready malt holds the hops on the tongue. A bit of a watery finish.  M : easy going, nicely carbonated, and seems to hide the 7% very very well.

We are lucky to be well within the regular distribution of Bells but I rarely get Two Hearted just because it IS so available. I know I can get it almost anytime i want.  Bottle dated 7/2/11 and pours a slightly hazy dirty copper orange with a nice big long-lasting frothy head. Not the prettiest beer but looks mean the least to me unless its way off.  This has a great smell to it. Nice citrusy hops as well as some floral nuances. Sweet caramel undertones as well. Taste follows the nose very closely. Citrus and floral in the front, caramel maltiness in the middle as well as some bitterness on the tongue and finishes slightly bitter and warming. Very nicely balanced. It makes me want to take another drink.  Mouthfeel is above average. Nice carbonation and coating of the tongue. Light body and not very resiny, which is to be expected from an IPA.  Overall I really enjoy Two Hearted for what it is, a very well balanced IPA. 60 Minute slightly beats it out in my book when i want to buy an $11 6pack of IPA, but I could alternate and be perfectly happy.

Grapefruit and orange dominate, but they are balanced by a perfect amount of malt. The malt never comes to the forefront, but it mellows out the hop bite and makes the finish light and clean. Hoppy, for sure, but nicely balanced. I feel like I never understood what people meant when they talked about ""balanced"" IPAs until I had this on draft at Bell's.  Mouthfeel is smooth and suits the beer, with appropriate carbonation.  This bottle is not quite as fantastic and smooth as I remember it being on draft in Kalamazoo, and my memory of that is probably affecting my scores right now.

287,1093,biboergosum,3.95,"12oz bottle, procured in a trade with Roke87 - thanks!  This beer pours a slightly hazy medium golden yellow hue, with two fat fingers of tight foamy, creamy off-white head, which leaves random swaths of sticky, filmy lace around the glass as it slowly recedes. It smells of bready caramel cream, and citrus, herbal, and mild pine hops. The taste is more of the same - though the citrus hops wane, replaced by a growing herbal essence, and bitter, all, over a mildly sweet bready malt. No evidence of the 7 points of booze, which is nice. The carbonation is on the low side of average, and a wee bit airy, the body also just short of medium weight, and smooth enough against a surging bitter hop edge. It finishes clean, mostly, and hoppy - the green, grassy, herbal sort.  A pretty decent IPA - I'm suspecting one of two things: this bottle has a bit of age on it, or my palate is still wrecked from two weeks of drinking in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Tons of sticky spiderweb lacing everywhere on the glass. A thing of beauty.  Somewhat sweet aroma, but the sweetness is coming from wonderful citrus hops. I really want to describe this as a tangerine aroma--something I don't think I've found in other IPAs.  More tangerine flavor as well, along with some bitter hops, other citrus, and a nice balance of crystal and caramel malts. A very well-rounded IPA, perfectly balanced, yet still fantastically hopped and full of flavor.  Medium body. Ample carbonation.  A great citrus-forward IPA that still maintains a great balance.

M: Medium bodied and a medium high carbonation. Crisp and super dry.  O: So this is why everyone says ""gotta have 2 hearted fresh!"" So glad I got a chance to have this again.

287,1093,AdvocateFan,4.12,"Pours a well-hazed pale brassy color capped by a lace-heavy off-white head. Notes of tropical fruits on the nose, with quite a bit of soap, and flourishes of mint leaves. Bits of pine and woody spiciness as well, with a flash of brine. Malty base comes through too, with suggestions of pretzel dough. On the palate, it's very, very dry, offering chalk-like bitterness that hits early, opening up long enough to permit a dusting of green-tea and what I can only describe as powdered high-alpha-acid hops to unfurl, with a touch of woody, piney, cedary (maybe spruce-y) spiciness, before regaining control and drying out quite profoundly. There are floral notes as well, but everything is very, very dry (less bitter than just dry, though the bitterness is present in ample share.) Finishes with a rather ""rindy"" citrus bitterness.  Fresh orange wedges and kiwi-like, papaya-esque tropical fruit notes really develop as the beer warms.  Hoppy for sure--but tastes like a wet-hopped beer--very ""fresh"" hopiness, very herbal/floral, and pretty intense, without being crushingly bitter. So much hop FLAVOR, which can be tough to properly feature.  Worth the wait--been looking forward to trying this legendary beer for a good long while. Lives up to the hype--but a touch less drying bitterness would make it just about a 9 on a 10-point scale (or 4.5 of 5) for me; it just sucks the moisture from the inside of my mouth about as completely as ""Mr. Thirsty"" does at the dentist's office.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Considering I am in Southwest Florida, this is about as fresh as we we can get so I am optimistic. 12 oz bottle poured into a stemless wine glass.  Appearance- this beer is a looker with golden orange hues but interestingly hazy and not as clear as I expected. Great lacing and and off white head that has decent retention. The bubbles keep the surface a little frothy.  Smell- the smell is as expected malt and hops but to me is not the strongest feature of this beer.  Taste- well, as with most ipa beers freshness is key and I am loving the flavor of this particular bottle much more than the last few I had. Man this tastes good! Citrusy hops and enough malt to give it balance.  Mouthfeel- medium carbonation but the perfect amount for this beer. Smooth and creamy. Outstanding.  Overall- this beer is praised by most people and with this fresh version I agree. In the South Florida heat this beer is so incredibly refreshing.

Just cracking the cap releases an immense bouquet of flowery fruit scents, like banana, pineapple and apple. Pouring it into the glass allows for that pineapple note to really come into focus. I don't detect any grain, grass, oat or other typical scent.  Pours cloudy, but clarifies into a mostly translucent hard amber-- by which I mean the amber that entombs certain prehistoric insects. An ivory, two finger head is produced that leaves no sticky lacing.  Lightly carbonated.  The fruitiness and sweetness are incredibly prominent, and I really have a hard time believing this is an IPA-- but that IPA bitterness is very much there at the end, and provides an interesting and welcome contrast to the first flavors. The flavor system present in this beer is incredibly complex, and while it can easily be downed in a few gulps, it really must be savored to be truly appreciated.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

T: Mellow pine bitterness up front, softens to a bit of semi-sweet grapefruit in the middle before a long finish with more mellow pine and a little biscuit.

I try to review IPAs when they're less than a month old so next time I have this fresher I may come back and edit this review.  Pours a hazy caramel golden yellow. I don't know if this color is inherently this attractive or I've just come to find it attractive because it's what most of my favorite IPAs look like, but I get excited when I see it. Huge head to start with, which fades to a merely good sized head which sticks around forever. The head is white like compacted snow and matches the color of the beer perfectly.  Smells gooood. Orange, lemon, pine, maybe even bananas. Lots of hops, lots of citrus.  Taste follows the nose with tons of citrus and a good bit of pine as well. There's a nice sweet malt backbone which lets all the great hop flavors run wild without being abrasive or ruining the beer's drinkability.  Mouthfeel is great, very smooth and creamy but with awesome carbonation.  This beer is my go to IPA when I can get it. It's the standard by which I judge other IPAs. If it's not my very favorite, it's at least in the top few. I feel like I've enjoyed past bottles even a little more than I'm enjoying this one, but I've never been disappointed with it.

T: Hops dominate the flavor as they do the smell. They contribute pine, floral notes and grass cuttings to the flavor. There is little in the way of fruit or citrus to taste and very little sweetness. A decent dose of caramel malts helps temper the bitterness slightly, and provides a bit of balance to the drink. The aftertaste is moderate in length and intensity and seems to highlight the earthy grass flavors.  M: The mouthfeel is somewhere between light and medium bodied. Aftertaste is fairly bitter but that doesn’t affect drinkability very much.  O: When I’m looking for a cost efficient IPA, this is hard to beat. It has many of the characteristics of a strong IPA, but I could drink this all evening without any problem.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Suick,4.97,"Well, After travelling for 10 years and trying hundreds and hundreds of different beers, I have settled on this as my favorite. I have actually tried many of the top on here, but for me they don't hold a candle to Bell's Two Hearted.  I think all of the pros have covered what the overall flavor of the beer, but this beer has the best finish of any beer, period. I will also remark on a few things I have noticed after consuming this product for years.  1) There is alot of inconsistency with the brew. When its on, it can't be beat, but there are times when it is off and has some strange characteristics. I know how hard the brewing process is, but I think this inconsistency does affect the product...Could be the hops as well.  2) This is an awesome six pack for a gift. I don't know how many people that have come back to me and said they now drink it regularly...because it is addicting.  3) Two hearted goes really well with cheese and fish...At least it does for me, I am no specialist in food, but I will say that I like it alot with these.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Kromes,4.35,"A: A hazy gold with a finger's width white head that dies down to a thin line of bubbles. Good lacing.  S: Sweet malts and a strong pine hop aroma.  T: More of the same, a nice smooth and sweet malt flavor with some floral (not bitter) pine hop. Very simple and delicious beer.  M: Medium body, good carbonation. Finish is a touch bitter, but mostly sweet pine.  O: Very good beer. Definitely a go to for summer days when you don't want a heavy IPA, but still want flavor to your beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DrewV,4.42,"Poured from a bottle (6/15/11 date) out of the beer fridge at 45 degrees into a Nonic glass.  A: Pours a clear golden yellow in the glass with a 2-finger frothy white head. Absolutely gorgeous heavy lacing coats the glass as the head recedes.  S: Citrusy hops up front, mainly tangerine with some lemon peel and grapefruit. Very sweet, pleasant aroma. No alcohol detected.  T: More smooth tangerine and grapefruit. A slight malt backbone supports the hops, although the hops dominate from start to finish. Lemon peel is detected in the aftertaste. Very refreshing brew. Absolutely no alcohol detected whatsoever. Amazing.  M: Creamy, but thin, mouthfeel. More sweet than bitter, and quite dry overall. No real lingering bitterness.  O: A very high quality brew, to be sure. A shame I can't get this in my area. Definitely something I'd keep in the beer fridge rotation if I had regular access to it.  NOTE: I can see where people might be somewhat unimpressed by this brew, as it's not a ""huge"" beer. But in my opinion, its strength lies in its ability to maintain a ""low profile"" while boasting a 7% ABV and drinking incredibly smoothly with plenty of hop refreshness without being overly bitter or thick bodied. This would make a great (but dangerous) summer day kick-back-and-enjoy-the-day pale ale. A very solid ""A"" brew here.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,tobelerone,4.22,"Dark colored, spicy IPA. Great nose full of complex aromas, flavors are deep and intricate, with a good balance of hop bitterness, spice and floral notes, malt backbone and mild booziness. Packs a decent punch, drinkable but you might not want to have too many. Overall, a very good AIPA that keeps its flavors in beautiful harmony, doesn't overwhelm with excessive bitterness.

287,1093,DabblinWiscCraft,4.42,"Pours a cloudy amber wheat color with an inch of pale cream head that falls to about an eighth of an inch but has legs and leaves some nice cling. The bouquet is very inviting: citrus, pine, and herbal/grass hop notes are all there, with a healthy caramel malt presence. The taste is a hop parade from start to finish. Pronounced pine, citrus rind, and grassy flavors are balanced carefully above a slightly toasted malt undercurrent. Prominent hop bitterness--crisp and clean--closes things. The feel is on the lighter side of medium-bodied, with acidic brightness and nice effervescence.  This is a big, bold, well-put-together IPA that's loaded with hop flavor and deftly balanced. Probably the best example of an American IPA out of the Midwest that I've tried.

Sweet with hints of pine and herbs in the background.  Big assault on the palate. Dominant hops throughout with just a touch of malt backbone. Malt makes a brief cameo in the middle. Strong bitter hops off the start and resurgent again at the finish. Grapefruit peel, pine needles and noble hop combination leave a puckering feeling at the end.  A little on the watery side for an ale. Oily feeling coats the mouth. Lots of carbonation scrubbing the taste buds.  I don't know what the big deal is about this beer. It's all hops with no balance at all. You get a little malt in the aroma, but it's all but non-existant in the taste.

Really great lacing.  Amazing smells coming from this one. A full blast of citrusy hops come right at you. Light floral scents as well. The hops aren't so overpowering though as to completely mask some light bready malts.  Tastes delicious! The hops start sweet then turn slightly resinous. Not a complete tongue-scraper, which I don't mind. Find it to be really well balanced.  Light-bodied with extremely good carbonation. Very crisp, light finish.

There are strong pine notes with background citrus hint of sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Great smooth and creamy body, but on the lighter side than most IPA‘s.  Overall: An excellent IPA.

287,1093,EnemyWithin,4.33,"Bottle on May 8th, 2011 in tulip plastic glass. Then on tap in June 2011, and in bottle into Unibroue glass in June/July 2011 multiple times.  Appearance: 4.5  Clear golden orange body with dense white 1inch head that slowly dissipates to leave a near complete thin, but present covering and has great lacing.  Smell: 4  Grapefruit/citrus aroma from the hops, with less intense resin/pine notes. Having try this many times now over, I knwo that the aroma of the hops can be quite subdued if not a fresh bottle, but are bursting when fresh on tap.  Taste: 4  Strong piney notes with background citrus characteristics of the hops that fade in and out. Very prominent bitterness, but not overpowering. I find these hop characteristics to be extremely well-balance with the crisp and bready/?light caramel malt. Finishes with nice bitterness and a hint of sweetness.  Mouthfeel: 4  Great smooth and creamy body, a little on the lighter side, but very appropriate. There is a hint less astringency and dryness then I expected (and have encountered with other IPAs). This makes a very refreshing and welcoming finish that is incredibly easy-drinking.  Overall: 4.5  A very nice IPA. There is something that I can’t quite figure out with just my first and only two-hearted that makes its very smooth and easy to drink. Perhaps the excellent presence of flavours of the malt and the slight sweetness it offers. Yet, the bitter nature of the IPA is also extremely prominent. When I first had this in a bottle, via a trade, I was a little disappointed. Yet, in subsequent samplings on-tap and in a fresh bottle, the beer was notably better, with more aroma and citrus taste.

287,1093,rickyleepotts,4,"I have had this beer time and time again. It’s a good “go to” beer, especially when you find a bar that doesn’t have a wide selection of beers. I drink this one a lot over at Golf 365. All the guys there really dig this stuff. It’s a good, standard IPA.  The beer smells like… like an IPA. Again, this beer doesn’t knock my socks off, but it does have a familiar and repeatable flavor. It smells like any other IPA you have had, and drinks like one too. It has a hint of carbonation on the front of the palate, spread itself thin on the tongue, and finishes smooth and wet. (I use that word a lot… wet.)  The aftertaste does stick around for a little while. One thing I did learn about this beer, here on 1001 Bottles, is the high ABV. I didn’t realize it was 7%. I always assumed it was a 5 or 6%. The beer is also readily available at pretty much any and every liquor store and grocery store you can find. So if you want to try it, it won’t be hard to find.  The label on the bottle has a fish on it… I am sure that has something to do with the city it is brewed in. Having only been to Michigan once, I can’t speak on behalf of the patrons… but it just seems like a place that would breed a lot of fishermen. That’s not a bad thing, but the fish on the bottle makes sense.  I like the beer… a lot. Of course, I like a lot of IPAs.

Why? Because it's so damn perfect, that's why. For years I have been searching for a well-hopped, well-balanced, not over-the-top, solid IPA. This is it. This is a beer that I want in my fridge 365 days a year. My belief in this was further reinforced when I had the pleasure of acquiring a super-fresh six pack.

Dark golden orange hue with a finger or so worth of chalk white, sticky head. Decent retention with moderate lace.  Copious amounts of earthy floral hops on the nose, accompanied by very prevalent grapefruit and lemon aromas. But seriously, this thing has some hops. This is not the lightweight's IPA.  As expected, serious pine up front with a lasting dry bitterness. Malt sweetness is there for balance, but again, this is the hops' show. Orange, lemon and grapefruit citrus round out the beer perfectly, masking the alcohol presence.  Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Easy drinking IPA with a sweet dry finish. Love it.  A near flawless IPA that places the hops in the center without aggressive and harsh overkill.

287,1093,deezbrewz,4.92,"Bell's Two Hearted remains one of my favorite IPA's. It's a fruity, citrusy, hoppy delight.  Some may consider it to be unbalanced, but I like its citrus character. I find it refreshing in the summer. Don't let them serve it to you too cold either. Like any IPA, the true character comes out when its served a bit warmer (around 35-40 degrees).  Seeing as IPA's are based so much on preference, I wouldn't over look this one based on bad reviews. I honestly think it's a contender with such great IPA's as Racer 5 IPA, Founders Centennial IPA and Huma.

The citrus turns to green pine and is present but not pronounced. This dries out at the end leaving a different kind of bitterness. Bold, yet not harsh.  M - Medium firm body, good carbonation.

Citrusy orange hops to an extreme. I mean this is what a hospickle is ladies and gents.  Taste starts off rather sweet and malty until WHAM the hops rush in and nearly take over the beer.

Thick n slick with some chewyness. Love these kind of beers that have a thick mouthfeel but don't bomb your stomach like most stouts.

Smell -- the aroma is bursting with sweet juicy citrus flesh, pithy peel, wet-nap, and honey malt. Vibrant hop bomb with a soft underlay of malt.  Taste -- Massive citrus hops, akin to tangerine flesh and grapefruit zest. Hop bitterness is in good proportion: assertive, but not a trial by ordeal. Malt is drier than the nose would suggest, but still with a modicum of honey sweetness.  Mouthfeel -- Medium in body with crisp carbonation. Refreshing.  Overall -- A great easy-drinking, go-to IPA.

287,1093,TCgoalie,4.3,"After 10 years of drinking this Michigan staple, I think it's time to review it.  Poured from a mini-keg into a pint glass, I observe a pale golden yellow brew with a dense white frothy head. The lacing is very sticky and adds to the appearance.  Light malt and wheat lead the smell with citrus hops backing that.  With pale malts providing a solid backbone, the hops steal the show. The Citrusy hops provide primary flavors of orange and tangerine.  This has a solid feel in the mouth with ample drying in the end.  This is a must have Michigan based ale. Not many beers can beat this when tasted fresh from Bell's taproom.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BobZ,3.68,"Had this on tap in Virginia, chose the 20 oz. Pour.  Appearance: Amber in color, “golden orange” would best sum it up. Came with a 1” head and left decent lacing.  Smell: A nice fresh IPA with a smell as expected, Citrus & Pine.  Taste: Hoppy grapefruit with resinous pine, malt backbone barely noticeable.  Mouthfeel: The hoppy character and a solid level of carbonation make this beer crisp and clean on the palate.  Overall: Solid example of an IPA, again fresh on tap was a nice way to experience this beer. IPA’s and DIPA’s seem to be very “basic” animals, slight variations on a citrus/pine, hoppy formula.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Smells like lots of citrus and very floral with a hint of breadiness.  Tastes bitter and a little more malty than I was expecting. Not as hoppy as I anticipated but there is a light grapefruit zest.  Mouthfeel is medium with a lot of carbonation.  Overall is really good.

A good hint of what's to come.  Taste - hops followed by slight grapefruit with a very very crisp end. Malty more than hoppy and no taste of the 7% ABV  Mouthfeel - Stays on the tongue for a moment, smooth going down with a crisp end. This beer tends to go fast and before you know it you are ready for another.

287,1093,SiggyFay,4.87,"This is very hard to obtain in my area. I have to resort to smuggling this beer either south of the Mason Dixon Line or south from Virgina as it is not distributed in The Old Line State.  Fortunately after contacting Derek @ Bells he directed me to locations close to me in the states mentioned above. He also reassured me that MD was on the ""short list"" of states they want to enter once they can open a new brewhouse hopefully in 2012. Woohoo!  But it is worth the gas spent to have this tasty beverage again and again.  While I prefer to drink it from a insulated or traditional pint glass it stands up very well straight out of the bottle while camping or when glasses are not available.  A great balance of sweet and bitter.

Good head retention with a little lacing.  S - Floral and piney hops largely make up the nose. Lots of fruits - grapefruits, light peaches, and a zesty citrus. Nice pale malt backbone.  T - Soft, smooth pale malts with a caramel sweetness bring way to a well-balanced and fresh hop profile. The hops bring piney, citrusy, and light fruity flavors to your tastebuds. Extremely well balanced beer. Only a moderate bitterness with a dry finish.  M - Medium bodied with a fine carbonation.  O - This is a very drinkable beer and priced quite nicely too.

Aroma is non-descript citrus a little pine and an estery fruit aroma that I can't really identify.

S: An somewhat lacking hoppy nose--my bottle isn't old, but it doesn't smell like it's been recently dry hopped. Still a light fresh hop aroma that appetizes me.  T: Nice aggressive hop bitterness with strong piney and spicy aspect--Centennial hops. The grapefruit flavor of freshly dryhopped Centennial is missing (as expected from a beer like Hop Stoopid). A slightly sweet and bready malt flavor cowers behind the lingering hop bitterness. Familiar and similar beer--Three Floyd's PA, Alpha King, although that is a different style in which I am more ready to accept a lack of strong hop aroma and flavor.  M: Average carbonation and on the thin side that I would rate A in a sessionable PA but here it's a little lacking.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S: Excellent, super piny with some grapefruit that really stimulates the olfactory! The ABV is masked pretty well; no astringent or alcohol odor.  T: Superb. Very crisp and very hoppy but no where near overwhelming. The pine and grapefruit are also visible in the taste. This would be a great ""session"" or ""lawn mower"" beer if the ABV wasn't so high.  M: Yet again, great! Thin bodied but not watery. Its everything an IPA should be, IMO.  O: Love it and am happy to have regular/year round access to such a fantastic beer.

287,1093,Drazzamatazz,4.08,"A: A hard pour produced some great head on top of an apple juice colored liquid. Head just clings to the side of the glass. Carbonation is very present visually. Looks like a nice inviting IPA.  S: Piney hops, grassy, a slight almost earthy dirt note, a bit of grapefruit and other citrus, orange marmalade malt. There's a nice fruitiness from the yeast as well that ties everything together.  T: So much hop pine is the first thing I noticed. I get a slight biscuit malt flavor that balances out the hops during each sip, but this one is really just a pine bomb. Letting it linger in my mouth brings forward a strange very bitter almost spoiled Triple Sec flavor. Fortunately this isn't present during a regular sip.  M: Carbonation is on the high side, but it keeps the beer crisp and prevents the hops from being too overpowering. Medium body, feels just like an IPA should. 7% ABV is nearly no where to be found as long as you don't take big swigs. Definitely a dry one though.  O: This one is a great example of what Centennial hops have to offer and how they can make an IPA taste. Its pretty in your face, which might not work for all people, but I like it. If it was something I could buy in my area it would be battling away against Finestkind, and it might just win.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,smbslt,4.33,Poured form a bottle to a pint. One finger head that disappeared into a thin lay despite an ample amount of carbonation. Almost no lacing but not surprising based on the crispness of the mouthfeel. The deep golden color made up for any expectations the head did not live up to.  Hoppy nose was strong and pleasant and not overwhelming.  Not a hop bomb but forthright. Could taste the hops before it hit the tongue but no explosion. Allowed the malts in the form of brown sugars and molasses to support nicely but then giving way to the hops in the finish. The finish was long and with a prolonged sensation resisting a rinse.  Mouth was crisp with the carbonation complimenting the feel.  Overall a excellent beer.

The taste follows the aroma and doesn't really step forward in any specific aspect. It starts off with the bitterness from the hops and it pretty much never leaves. There is some light grapefruit which lingers around and just a touch more would be great. I like the way this one finishes with just a bit of mild bitter/dryness but still nice and crisp.

287,1093,BarryMFBurton,3.95,"After a rather long afternoon with the lawnmower, I’m more than ready for a cold beer. Perfect time to try out a Two Hearted Ale…then again, when isn’t it a good time to have craft classic? I decided to satiate my massive thirst with a couple glasses of cold water first, so as to not give this brew an unfair advantage in the category of refreshment. Now that I’m hydrated and out of the sun, it’s time to put this American legend to the test:  A: Pours a shining gold, with a two finger head of thick white foam. After about 5 minutes, the head fades, leaving a thin coat of lacing behind. Still bubbling from the bottom after 10 minutes. Looks like the perfect summer sipper.  S: Mellow, earthy hops that remind of a Willamette strand. A malty undertone is weak, but evident. Overall, a mild nose that still gives a good preview of the body.  T: Those hops are awesome! I just looked it up: they are the Centennial variety. It has a good, earthy blast of freshness, then an unexpected floral note jumps in. Like a freshly picked wildflower, the aromas take you to a level of satisfaction that’s hard to duplicate. Great stuff. Apart from the hops, there’s not a whole lot, though. There’s a faint wheat note every once in a while, allowing a calm melon/grapefruit to come through, but that’s it, really. Oh well, the hops are complex enough to leave any craft drinker satisfied.  M: Well, as it was with many Bell’s I’ve tried, it’s a bit runny. Just barely noticeable in this brew, though.  O: Summer beer at its best. It's not super-complex, but I don't feel that's what it was meant to be. I’ll definitely be seeking out more Centennial hops-based offerings in the future, though. To be honest, I wish it had a lower ABV. I would make this a session favorite if it were under 5%.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Bell's Two Hearted Ale made me say that today. This ranks among the best citrus IPAs I have ever tasted. I think This has found a place in my top 5 IPAs.  Two hearted is a slightly hazy copper orange color in my Sierra Nevada hop glass, there is some visible carbonation. After the pour the beer had a 3/4 inch cream head and as I drink it leaves sticky lacing. The smell of this beer is absolutely spectacular, I caught whiffs of orange before I was able to get the cap all the way off my bottle. The dominant smell is the citrus hops, but I think I am catching some floral hops as well. The taste starts with a slight sweetness, in the middle of my tongue I get a bit of pine flavor, finally as I swallow the beer I get a strong grapefruit bitterness. This grapefruit lingers into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel for this beer is just where it should be. Overall, the only negative I can see about this beer is that I can't get it at the supermarket.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,deadonhisfeet,4.24,"This baby pours a hazy light amber with a nice 2-finger head that doesn't hang around very long. I didn't detect much of an aroma (perhaps it's a little cold), just a faint floral citrus-like smell.  This beer is your typical American IPA. Fresh and zippy from the hops with a faint sweetness behind it. You get your typical IPA flavors here: grapefruit, lemon, and orange. The flavors are swept along by a nice viscous mouth feel. The bitterness is very manageable and not too overwhelming. Think of this beer as an ``introductory'' IPA.  This is not my favorite IPA, but it is darn good. Perhaps I'm imagining things, but I had a growler of this several months ago and I remember it with much more fondness than this bottle. Nevertheless, it is still a tasty and refreshing beer. Cheers!  Edit 1 - I have now had this beer numerous times and it is a go-to IPA. When it's reasonably fresh, it's about as good as an easy-to-get IPA can be. Delicious, crisp citrus-like hop notes and faint caramel sweetness with a spot-on aroma and a beautiful appearance.  Edit 2 - This is no longer a go-to IPA. I have discovered Fat Head's Head Hunter. Please forward my mail.  Edit 3 - I had a chance to try a cask-conditioned version of this beer recently. It still tasted like Bell's Two-Hearted, but the aggressive hop character was replaced by a mellow complexity and more well-rounded flavor. The sharp citrus-like notes were gone. In their place were more subtle, herbal, tea-like notes that complemented a faint, fruity flavor in the background. It was a very refreshing beer that I wish I could try again sometime.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Ziro,4.28,Had this one in a standard pint glass out of a 12 ounce.  Appearance Pours a nice two finger white head without much effort. Head sticks around for awhile with lacing going down the glass. Has a beautiful golden straw color with some carbonation. Exactly what an American IPA should look like.  Smell Hops. Plenty right off the bat. Something smoky as well. Never been good at naming wood so I won't make a guess. Also a faint fruit smell barely there but adds a nice touch.  Taste Hops come out here with the woody smell turning out to be piney. Fruity taste is hard to detect but it's there and there is also some malt here as well.  Mouthfeel Smooth but has carbonation so it's not too smooth. The malt makes it a bit thicker than medium. Not my preference for the style but it won't stop me from having another.  Overall A great American IPA that I'll gladly get again. Something to drink around the holidays thanks to that piney fragrance and taste.

Toasted grain dripping with pine resin. The sweet malt and bitter pine complement each other perfectly. Some fruity notes in the middle accented by juicy citrus. Long grassy finish leads to aftertaste of toasty grain and pine resin.  M- Medium bodied, sticky with mouth-coating hop oils, moderate carbonation, and a semidry finish.

Ever so hazy with a finger or so of slightly off-white head which produces some heavy duty lacing.  Smells of citrus hops (mainly grapefruit) with some piney hops notes as well. No noticeable malt aroma in the nose, but man those hops smell so good, I'm not really missing it.  Taste is also dominated by big, bold, assertive hops flavors. Delectable citrus hops are the star. There is some piney flavors as well as a touch of sweet caramel which provides a malt backbone to the brew.  Mouthfeel is moderately thick and a touch oily. Carbonation is ample and provides a touch of creaminess to the beer.  Overall, what a great IPA. It packs a sizable hops punch but is well balanced and very tasty.

Color is a gorgeous golden orange, with a humongous white head that lasts through the entire glass. There's still a layer of foam with my last sip. A real beauty.  Scent is a fruit cocktail - ripe pear, peach and some apple. The hops impart a grapefruit taste with a piney sharpness that is notciable but not overwhelming. A strong malt backbone is present to give a nice balance. A biscuity taste is subtly present throughout, but comes through most in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full and rich. Wonderfully balanced, complex, and very enjoyable. Sadly, I only had one on hand.

Mouthfeel-High carbonation, even too much. Medium body, not easy drinking, but not hard either.  Overall-Painfully average. I wanted to really like this beer. I got one once as an extra a few months back and didn't like it much then. Then bought a sixer of it while in Indiana for DLD and same result now.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,spinrsx,4.15,"12oz Bottle  Appearance - Slightly hazy orange colour with a fairly large size frothy beige coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation and there is some really good lacing on the sides of the glass. The head lasted for 4-5 minutes before it began to dissipate.  Smell - Malts, caramel, hops, tangerine  Taste & Mouth - There is a high amount of carbonation and most of the taste is made up of caramel and malts mixed with hops. There is also some citrus juice and zest.. grapefruits and tangerines. A little bit of pine flavour comes in during the lingering bitter aftertaste.  Overall – This is probably one of the most drinkable beers I’ve ever had.. after every sip I just wanted more and more. The flavours are perfectly balanced and it came across as very clean and crisp. I find most IPA’s a little too sugary sweet to have a few of them in during one sitting.. but this one is flavoured perfectly.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,VMWhelan,4.02,"Recently decided to retry this beer and found it MUCH more enjoyable than the first time.  Pours a golden orange with half a finger of white head.  Pretty sweet smelling with grapefruit notes, subtle pine.  Taste follows up on the nose. Bitter hoppyness balanced with a nice mellow sweetness. The hops definitely give off more grapefruit than anything else, as well as some pine again.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with little carbonation, though the bottle I had last week was better than this.  Drinkability is good. Definitely better than the first time I've had it, must've been a bad bottle. This one was a little flat but when I had it last week, it was better. Going to have to get this on tap to really judge this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,elephantrider,4,"Poured this into a Bells pint glass.  A: Bright orange in color. Creamy head with some good lacing down the glass.  S: Alot of citrus in the nose. I really like the aroma on this one but seems to be one dimensional. There is just a little bit of carmel in their too.  T: All citrusy hops. Not much in the way of bitterness, but that is not what this one is supposed to deliver. Crisp finish.  M: It is definitely thin and has a light feel in the mouth.  This is a go-to beer for me. Alot of flavor and does not try to overpower.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,RashyGrillCook,4.02,"Appearance- Pours a clear pumpkin orange with a one finger height head and plenty of small champagne like bubbles.  Smell- Distinct notes of citrus, grapefruit, pine dominate here.  Taste-Here is where this brew really opens up. Flavor by the tons! Piney bitterness that blends really well with crisp, light malty notes. Dried Apricot comes through in the finish and most of the character expresses itself in the back half of the palate. Perfect carbonation is also noteworthy here.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,azdback,3.38,"Poured into a Stone Imperial glass. Bright orange color and very clear, medium to light carbonation bubbles that give this one a bright white creamy and sticky head. Lace looks like it might stay around for the sunset.  Smell is mostly bready yeast and sweet malts. A bit of a bitter citrus smell covered in some caramel. I would say orange rind with cotton candy laced on top.  Taste is a lot like the smell. It hits the tongue with a mild biter punch and then mellows it out with a sugar sweetness. There is still quite a bit of bready yeast flavors of which I am not very fond of.  Mouth is a bit thin. I don't think this offering from Bell's stands up to other great IPA's.  Overall. I have had this many times in the past but haven't had the chance to review it. I found a sixer of batch 10337 (bottled April 20th 2011) and was so happy to have such a fresh offering, but I don't think this stands up to any high end IPA. Maybe I'm having an off night. I will save the other 5 for a later taste. If they are better then this one I edit my review accordingly.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Jdmpolk,4.5,"A- a deep tarnished gold color with hints of copper. Billowing white head explodes at first but then settles to just skim the top.  S-notes of grapefruit, Apple, pineapple, and flowers. Sweet aroma to it.  T- the malt supports the hops ad a vehicle for the hops. A dry grapefruit flavor is present, but never is overwhelming. Slight alcohol sweetness.  M- moderate staying power, it hits hard but then leaves very little trace. Persistent carbonation.  O- this is a text book American Ipa. Balance of malt and strong hop flavor. Perfect hoppy aroma, and little aftermath. Very good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

You gotta love breakfast beer.  The nose is great. Filled with floral hop aroma and a lil something that smells like cotton candy, yes cotton candy. And hint of piney hops.  Taste is great. Lots of flavor. I've had a few DIPAs that didn't have as much flavor. Starts crisp and clean. the middle is malty sweet and ends hoppy as hell.  Finish is a mostly dry but slightly sweet hop lingering there to remind you of the greatness that's in your glass ready to be sipped on again.  I've passed over this a lot in the bottle shop (simply because I didn't know who made it, etc) and now I'm kicking myself for it. I could have been drinking this a long time ago.

One of my 3-4 goto beers until the price increase and it still find itself in my fridge more often than it probably should with Columbus IPA around. Fresh on tap. Pours a golden orange body with a beautiful cream colored head. Smell is evertything you could hope for in an IPA. Just punches you in the face with piney/citursy hops. Taste is much the same, a little bit of fruit, a little bit of citrus and a lot of pine, leaving a wonderful bitterness on the palate.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Smells absolutely mouth-watering (if you're a hop-head). A small amount of grassy earthiness is also present. Some biscuity malt in the background too.  T - Sharp bitterness up front followed by a floral spiciness and some bready grains.  M - Extremely drinkable. Nice carbonation. Not too thick or sweet, but a dry finish that leaves me craving the next sip!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Mosley1212,4.7,"Poured from the bottle into my DFH Signature Glass.  A--Wonderful tangerine orange with a white fluffy head that produced a mammoth head with a hard pour. Great retention all the way down the glass.  S--Smells of hops, pine cones, citrus, and fresh cut grass. Little bit of a citrus bite up front with a heavy hop wallop at the end.  T--Follows the nose fantastically. It has an amazing grassy, piny flavor. Love the taste of citrus on this. Pineapple, grapefruit, and a hint of coriander. The grassy aftertaste is dank on the tongue.  M--Light body with medium carbonation. The tongue is left with a heavy bitter flavor that lasts a long time after the sip is finished.  O--This is one of my top 5 favorite IPAs. If it were more readily available it would be a fridge staple.

287,1093,Huhzubendah,4.03,"I have had this beer many times over the years, and am quite overdue to write a review.  The appearance is clear and light orange hued. The head stands in at around an inch thick, displays lasting retention and leaving ample lacing on the pint glass. The aroma is not particularly grand, but is pleasant nonetheless. Scents include malt, floral notes, light pine. The flavor is tasty, and though the beer is primarily hop forward, it definitely has a strong malt backbone. This is a good example of what I would consider a ""balanced"" IPA. Though I prefer beers of this ilk to be lighter on the palate and more hop forward with a pronounced citrus component, there is no denying that Bell's Two Hearted Ale is a tasty brew. Additionally, I think this beer, like many IPAs, is a notch better on draft versus the bottle.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,stageseven,4.25,"The first thing I noticed upon pouring was the pungent and sharp leafy aroma from the hops. As it sat the resin broke up a bit, making room for a sweeter grapefruit scent. While there may be some malt smell as well, I didn't really pick it up, instead the beer was drowning in intense hoppiness.  In the glass the beer takes on a golden color with a touch of reddish hue, and supports a thin white head. Being bottle conditioned, I may have poured a bit of sediment into the glass, and ended up with a bit of haziness in my otherwise clear beer.  Grapefruit assaults the tongue on the first sip, then makes way for a substantial bitterness at the back of the mouth. There's a light bread aftertaste on the sides of the tongue that lingers along with the hop bitterness for a few minutes. The beer is most assuredly balanced towards the hoppy and bitter side, which is certainly not unwelcome. It does however lack some of the intensity of Hopslam, which assaults the palate thoroughly with its hoppy nature. That isn't to say that it's lacking in flavor, but rather that it is more of an every day beer.  It certainly doesn't lack for carbonation, actually having a somewhat light body with constant tiny bubbles. The hop resins leave a stickiness in the mouth as well, quickly coating the tongue. The beer goes down easily though, with just a touch of warmth on the tongue and in the chest.  There really isn't much left to say, I love this beer. It's flavorful but not overwhelming, and has a great blend of hop flavors and aroma. The only criticism I can come up with is that there's the slightest touch of either metallic or phenolic taste, barely enough to notice. While sometimes this can be a welcome addition to the mix of flavors, in this case I didn't feel that it added anything. Still, this was a very minor issue for me, and for a standard IPA this is one of the best I've had. I imagine this beer is even better fresh, I don't know how old it is, but I know that it's at least from January. All things considered, it has held up rather well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Bendurgin,3.83,Bottle thanks to Grant. Poured into a tulip. This one pours kind of hazy burnt orange color with a giant three fingered tall head that sits white and bubbly atop. It retains nicely and leaves nice sticky lace.  Fresh cut grass in the aroma with a nice grapefruit background. Slightly bittering aroma with a noticable malt profile that hints towards notes of caramel. The taste doesn't transilate the aroma perfectly. It has a kind of toasty flavor with a more noticable caramel malt body. Hints of grapefruit with a good bitter hop finish. The aroma leads one to believe this is going to be a bit more citric on the pallet.  The feel is good. Nice light body with lively carbonation. A little drying. Overall a nice offering from Bell's. A well made IPA that delivers nicely. I'd welcome more of these in my refridgerator.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Pours a clear gold color with a persistent carbonation. Formed a thin one-finger head loosely composed of variously sized air pockets. Good retention. Floral and citrusy hops dominate the aroma with a little malt sweetness backing them up. Assertive floral hops and bitterness in front, toasty malts following up, lingering bitterness and a moderately dry finish. Slightly spritz carbonation and a medium body.  Solid example of the American IPA style with plenty of hop bitterness and a well-founded malt backbone.

287,1093,Cannoneer,4.43,"This is a great example of American IPA, which drinks easy and strikes a nice balance between flavor, hoppy bitterness and drinkability.  Pours pure amber with a solid head, which gives way to gentle lacing. Very appetizing looks and enticing smell of fruit, tree bark and clean water.  The main aspect of this beer for me was how easy it was to drink it. It practically gets inhaled, with your mouth craving for more as soon as you complete a gulp. The predominant tastes are those of apricot, pine needles and just clean water. It's rare that the water is praised as a discernible beer component (complaints of ""watery"" beers are far more often), but in this case the excellent water quality and subtle taste certainly adds much to the beer's exceptional drinkability.  Overall, an excellent session beer that goes well even on its own.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Hoppy bite in the aftertaste, then citrus again.  Mouthfeel is crisp, but not over carbonated. Hearty with a littel alcohol bite to it.  Overall, this is a satisfying beer.

Lots of pine, a bit of sweetness, a bit bitter at the end, and everything one would want out of a big IPA. Goes down maybe a bit too smooth, but overall very nice.  M - A bit thin/watery at first, but opens up a lot mid-way. Leaves a bit to linger on my palate after each sip.  O - A wonderful IPA.

There's the sweetness of honey, but not overpowering. There's a slight bitterness but not as much as you'd expect from an IPA. Some dryness in the aftertaste as well.  Not an overly complex beer but it's got to be one of the most drinkable beers ever, especially for having a 7% ABV. Really goes down easy.

Smell is of faded hops, some bready, biscuit notes, and even some subtle apple fruitiness.  Taste is smooth and delicious. The hops have faded after 3 months in the bottle, but there is a subtle creaminess, fruit notes, biscuit notes, and tasty malts. All the flavors are balanced. No bitterness or aftertaste.

Batch # 10269 Bell's Batch Finder = A bottled date of March 22nd, 2011  A-&gt; Pours a beautiful pale hazy and clear copper. Normal pour yields close to 3 fingers worth of thick, white head that has very stubborn retention and stupendous lacing. Some terrific nucleation as well.  S-&gt; Bouquet is of citrus and muted pine aromas at first. Upon further examination, some deeper malt undertones are detected, seemingly of the sweet variety. More sniffs reveal a definite honeydew melon smell with some mango/pineapple in there as well. Pine hop resins tail this one up. Really complex in the nose.  T-&gt; Not as hoppy when it first hits as I was anticipating. Not a fault however as the amazing balance of this brew begins to introduce itself.

Great representation of the style however, as with many beers, not sure I get all the hype surrounding this one. Doesn't mean I didn't like it or that it isn't a good beer, because it is.

287,1093,Jeffo,4.33,"In a recent trade with Pixieskid. Thanks man!  From a bottle into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours a 1 ½ finger, medium, fluffy, white head with good retention. Amber orange or gamboge in color, clear, with medium carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a good foam wisp and clings to the sides. A splotchy wisp remains until the end leaving lots of clingy lacing down the glass. Very nice looking.  SMELL: Nice nose on this one, and plenty bold enough. Pale and caramel malts with citrus aromas. Pineapple and honeydew melon with citrus fruits in there too. Light grapefruit aromas, but mostly melon and citrus fruits. Some mild floral hops round out a pleasant and enticing nose. Nice.  TASTE: Pale malts, caramel notes and honeydew melon. Citrus and plenty of grapefruit and bitter pine after the swallow. Much more bitter than the nose had suggested. Bold and lingering bitter hop and pine aftertaste, with just a touch of sweet melon as balance, just won’t quit. Very good stuff.  PALATE: Medium body and carbonation. Light and creamy on the palate, goes down very smooth and finishes slightly dry on the palate. Very nice, refreshing feel on this one. Perfect for summer.  OVERALL: This brew has just redeemed Bell’s in my book. Up to this point, everything I’ve had form them has been just alright, but this one, however, is world class. Easily the best Bell’s I’ve had to date, and probably one of the best IPAs in the field. Lots of flavor and aroma, and a great look and feel to support it. This is a year-round brew apparently, and I can see why. Thanks again Pixieskid. Recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,bfirkin45,3.88,"Overall I found this to be a solid beer, refreshing with decent hops notes and a good aftertaste.  Appearance: Light-honey color with a lingering head that creates rings as I drink from my pint glass.  Smell: Other types of beers have a larger smell profile and spectrum but for an IPA, this beer has a good fruit and airy smell to it. More malty than hoppy.  Taste: I like to think that Bell's named this beer two hearted for the two distinct tastes that I happen to experience when I drink it. First, I get a smooth yet bitter hops taste that brings in a zesty feel while after lingering for a moment, the second taste is the malty overtone that clears up my mouth. It is refreshing and leaves me wanting more.  Feel: It lingers but does not leave me with an overbearing taste once I swallow it. Carbonation adds to the refreshment of the beer.  Highly recommend this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,6thomas3,4.35,"Appearance - Ample head retention with pale snow white lacy suds clinging to the glass like a frozen stream of water, dirty amber hue with streams of tiny carbonation bubbles rising towards the top of my glass at moderate clip and in perfect synchronizing harmony  Smell - Fresh rain with a modest glimpse of alcohol infused with trace amounts of floral aromas and grass from Mother Earth's bosom  Taste - A smooth transition of bitter sharpness(if that's possible)  Mouthfeel - Liberal moathcoating with uniform bite race across the tip of your tongue to explode into a festive miracle of drinkable beer  Overall - Recommendation high; a columniation of wondrous flavors wrapped into an ABV of lucky number seven",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,teromous,4.12,"A: It pours a medium amber color that is slightly hazy, resting under about half a thumb of pure white head. It doesn't lace very well, more of a blotchy camouflage pattern.  S: It has a hoppy smell, but is interlaced with a slight spice and a bit of a bread scent. The scent is very mellowed out though and I nearly have to bury my nose to smell anything.  T: The hop flavor is more subdued in this AIPA. It is very well balanced. The hop flavor has a spice flavor and a little earthiness. The malt is very warm and a little bread flavor with a little caramel. I didn't realize this was 7%ABV and it does a great job of masking it. The flavor changes constantly from the point I drink it to a few seconds after I drink it, which says a lot about its complexity.  M: The mouthfeel is very nice. It isn't quite the spark I'd expect from an AIPA, but it's about average compared to the standard IPA.  O: Overall it's a nice, well balanced IPA. I would drink it again or order it on tap if I saw it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Aroma is of floral and pine hops aroma  Taste is medium body but full of zest and hops  Overall this is an outstanding IPA and the bells crew has once again not let me down.

Smells slightly of citrus hops with a light malt backbone. The smell is light and not overpowering.  Taste starts with hop bitterness followed by a clean light malt backbone with citrus notes. the cutrus is grapefruit with some orange and tropical undertones. The finish is slightly dry and bitter.  The mouthfeel is lively with moderate carbonation and a crisp and dry finish.  Overall this is a good summer beer. It is light, crisp, and dry on the finish. A good thirst quencher on a hot day. Where this beer falls a little short for me is in the hop profile. It is a little too bitter and I would like a little more citrus to come through.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Nugganooch,3.76,Review courtesy of trade with Shuggy Bottle/Batch # 10138  A: Pours a light cloudy straw pale color with some darkened hues and a nice thick 2.5 finger pure white head.  S: I get a big citrus fruit aroma up front followed quickly by sweet malts and a clean yeast note to it.  T: Spicy!!!! The hop bitterness kind of took me by surprsie on this one. It snorkled up the nose and I nearly ASNR'd everywhere...swear to god. Some biscuity malts in there. Lots of earthy floral and pine hop notes with that signature citrus pucker that zings and prickles the palate. Dry crisp finish to it. Refreshing.  M: Lightly sticky mouthfeel but overall very sleek.  D: Pretty solid once you get past that first punch of hop bitters. I am sad my one sample is now gone actually. I can easily see why this is a hopfan favorite.  If 2-Hearted was a local to me it would be in my fridge alot to say the least. Some great drinking IPA!

287,1093,MrHungryMonkey,3.68,"Pours slightly hazy copper with nice head. Looks good.  Nose is floraly hoppy, yet fairly restrained for an IPA.  Main characteristics are floral, herbal, & bitter hoppiness. Orange nib, dried herbs (almost oregano), a touch of sweet candy, and an overall tea-like bitterness also notable. Soft malt base. Hop flavor is milder than I would like to see in IPAs, yet certainly pleasant. Tastes pretty good. Feels good. Good drinkability.

287,1093,Roke87,4.15,"355 mL (12oz) bottle, chilled, and poured into a Duvel tulip. Bell’s batch #10166, Brewed on Jan.4/2011  Appearance- A bright golden colour, slightly hazy, poured with a finger and a half of nice white head that very slowly resides, good head retention and a maximum amount of lacing.  Smell- Very strong hop and pine smells coming from this one, you catch a little of the citrus fruit in there, along with some bready malt smells thrown in as well.  Taste- I get the malts right off the bat paired with a nice citrusy grapefruit taste, and in the finish the bitter hops take over and dominate.  Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied ale with average carbonation, very bitter on the palate but still very crisp and refreshing.  Overall- A hophead’s dream, lots of bitter hop flavours with a sweetness from the grapefruit in there and mild malts as well. One of Bell’s better offerings, a definite go to when shopping for beers in Michigan.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,vtblackdog,3.95,Appearance is a golden yellow and pours a decent head.  Smell is not strong more of a slightly stale hop. I expected more on the hop aroma.  Taste is a typical IPA with a bitter aftertaste. Not a lot of distinction from others.  Mouthfeel is decent carbonation level.  Overall a good brew but not a distinctive IPA for me.  The code on the bottle was 10207. Was that over a year ago?,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DelMontiac,4,"Thanks to the guys at Brown Derby International Wine Center in Springfield, MO for hooking me up with Two Hearted Ale.  Poured a crystal clear golden yellow into a pint glass with a two finger white soapy head. Head retention was good. Moderate lace noted. A little on the pale side, but still looked nice.  Aromas are straight-on grapefruit and pine sap slathered in sweet bisquity malt.  Flavors are replicated from the nose. Nicely balanced. Shades turn from citrus to sweet malt to bisquits and on to bittering hops. Not overkill, but not weak.  Feel is good, maybe thinner than most good IPAs I've encountered, but the carbonation fills the gap nicely.  This is not a knock your socks off IPA for the extreme hophead and it's not intended to be such. Overall Two Hearted Ale is higly drinkable and enjoyable. One great goto IPA if you have access in your area (which I don't). I should've bought a case...damn.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DCon,4.2,"Enjoyed on-tap @ the Hardshell Cafe in Soulard- Downtown St. Louis, MO. Received @ the bar in a Pint Glass and enjoyed the best ale they had on tap (others were Bud Light, Budweiser, Blue Moon- Spring Ale, Magic Hat #9, Miller Lite, and others not worth noting...)  Appearance- Has a Copper (light brown, dark orange), Semi-Cloudy body with 2.5 fingers of head. Head retention was good as well and has decent amount of lacing.  Smell- Huge hops & Christmas smell. Also a hint of some sort of clover. Can't put a finger on it but will be having again to rate again.  Taste- Has a huge (non-discriptive) hop taste, and a caramel flavor. The finish is without a doubt a Captain Crunch taste without the added milk. Just simply great!  Mouthfeel- Medium-Full Bodied, Good Carbonation, and Smooth! Leaves that cereal taste on the palate that is very strange for an IPA but not a bad characteristic.  Overall- Bell's has always brewed many great ones and have had this several times @ the iTap House in Chesterfield, MO. This is a well balanced and great American IPA. Will be enjoyed soon but not more than 2 in a night. This is where they fall short... with their Drinkability.

Smell: A sweet aroma of citrus hops balanced by bread and malt. Scent of grapefruit in the background.  Taste: A strong bite from the citrus and pine hops is balanced by sweet malts. Bitter but not overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Medium body and carbonation. Smooth and crisp.  Overall: A very tasty IPA that has great balance in the bitterness and sweetness.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Radome,4.12,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a British pint glass.  A - Medium straw color; just slightly hazy. The head is white and fluffy and lasts as a layer several millimeters thick until the end of the glass. There's a slight oily sheen to the tiny bubbles and the lace moves and scintillates on the glass.  S - Aroma starts as warm malt, bread and toast. Then the citrusy hops jump in, reminiscent of lemons and limes. Very nice balancing act.  T - Tastes are well-balanced between sharp, citrus hops and warm, biscuity malt. In the mid-palate the hops dominate and almost seem soapy. Then they fade again and the aftertaste is amazingly dry and clean.  M - Strong, astringent hops bitterness. Some carbonation creaminess. Body light to medium. No alcohol burn.  D - A supremely balanced beer. This is a great stand by that is good any time. I like it better as it warms because the malt becomes more evident and counteracts the hops that show better when cold.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ChugginOil,3.92,"A translucent straw colored liquid pours from the 12oz bottle into the Dogfish Head pint glass, settling a hazy light orange. There is a lot of white, large bubbled head that adds up to around 3 inches in height. Some bubbly lacing is left behind, grasping to sprawled out parts of the glass.  The scent is fruit-tootie up in here. I notice some apricots paired up with some faint citrus notes, both offered by the hop flowers used to brew this beer. Some sweet malt is picked up through the nose and leads me to believe that the hop presence will be balanced with the sweeter malts.  Sure enough! the bitterness isn't over the top whatsoever and is matched with a pleasant malt presence that creates a total package. However, the fruity hop qualities noticed in the nose aren't prominent at all in the taste. This is a bit of a letdown but I must take into consideration that this isn't a DIPA and isn't maxxed out so to speak.  The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing due to a light bitterness offered by the hops and a tight notch of carbonation that holds it together.  Overall, pretty good but not over the top as far as IPAs go. Good balance throughout for some nice tastes.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Mild cereal malt fills out the rest of the aroma, filling in the cracks left by the hops. Moderate carbonation, good mouthfeel, nice hop bitterness in the finish. Taste is hop forward, but there's a nice subtle malt sweetness that helps balance things out. The body of the beer is lightly syrupy, though the heavy carbonation helps keep it from being overpowering or cloying.

287,1093,Naples,4.32,"12 oz. brown bottle poured into a nonic, yielding a nice 2 inch off-white head which collapsed away from the sides and cosolidated at 1 inch. Maintained a nice 1 finger creamy head, with swirling in between drinks. The body was a cloudy amber.  Initially, pine dominated the nose. As the brew warmed, the pine shared the stage with grapefruit and some subtle floral notes. By the end of the brew, the floral and fruity elements moved into the front row.  Pine was the vanguard across the palate, followed by an impressive malt/grapefruit bomb, then pithy grapefruit, ending with a resiney surprise at the back of the tongue. The bitterness lingers, but not unpleasantly.  The Two Hearted was medium light in the mouth, with medium carbonation...very smooth.  Although I am not a hophead, I found this beer to be a pleasant surprise. It's not in my wheelhouse, but can see why it is a highly regarded brew. Lots to like here. I could drink a couple of these, then probably need to switch off.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,GossageBrewery,3.14,"Poured this american IPA out of a 12 oz bottle and into a pint glass. The AIPA poured a hazy golden color and produced a nice thick 2 finger width head. Head retention on this beer is excellent and the lacing is one of the best I have seen. The aroma is nice and hoppy, a little above average for an AIPA. There were some notes of citrus. The taste of the beer is a little watery- Its a little weak with the amount of malt. Light body, it makes it a very drinkable IPA but I dont really look for that in an IPA. After the thinness subsides, there is a pronounced hop bite, but it does not linger. The finish has hints of citrus and it is slightly dry. Overall there is nothing special about this beer- does not come close to my top ten list of IPAs. But hey..its not like Bells makes a Kolsh right?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jifigz,4.41,"Bottle poured into my Victory Tulip.  A: The appearance of this brew is very alluring as it shines a gorgeous orange.  S: Citrusy type smells are what dominate this beer's scent for me. Smells strongly of a grapefruit.  T: The taste mimics the smell pretty closely. First initial splash that hits your mouth floods your tongue with the citrus/grapefruit flavors. Leaves a nice lasting bitterness in your mouth.  M: A little over carbonated in my opinion. I would appreciate less bubbles, but not too bad.  O: A very good IPA. Very enjoyable to have with several types of heavier and creamier flavors such as steaks and rich alfredo sauces and such. It also packs the perfect ABV in my opinion, not too strong, but definitely high enough to help a heavy drinker catch a buzz if one is wanted. All things considered, I'd still choose a Hop Devil.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Grapefruit and floral aromas invigorate the senses. Very clean.  T - Taste of pine, grapefruit with a hoppy finish. Aftertaste stays a while, though. I've had a few IPA's, and the hops seem to be what is the ""thing."" This definitely has that thing.  M - Very crisp and refreshing. Pretty decent carbonation, but I don't really care about carbonation. Be it a low carbonated stout or this, it doesn't matter.  Overall, it is probably the tastiest beer that I have had so far that I can actually find that is less than $10 per six pack.

Two finger rocky white head with huge chunky lacing left behind.  Light tropical fruit notes of pineapple and mango with a some earthiness and a touch of bread.  Sweet malts up front that are immediately overwhelmed with earthy, dank, and pineapple hops flavors. A dank/resinous bitterness lingers.  Mouthfeel is pretty much perfect, could maybe use just a touch more carbonation.  This beer is very tasty overall. Could be amped up on the citrus/tropical fruit characteristics, but the alcohol is super well hidden, and it's very drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

It appears to have a nice amount of carbonation and good lacing.  Smell: Sweet citrus and floral scents. Smells great and is very appealing.  Taste: Nice strong flavor and slightly bitter. Well balanced with a hint of sweetness. The slight bitterness lasts well after the last drink.  Mouthfeel: Sits well in the mouth with a nice crisp feel. Carbonation is mildly high and goes smooth.

Not much malt coming through all that hop smell. Tastewise... probably the best balance I've seen in an IPA so far. Floral hop is the star feature, but the pine comes through as well & not shampooey at all as I feared it might be. It's bold, sweet and finishes w/ a pleasant dryness.

There was a great hazy golden body with a nice inch and a half head that stuck around a bit with all the carbonation. The aroma of citrus, flowers and a small hint of honey were strong. First taste hit the hops first, but not overpowering, felt balanced a noticed a bit on the sweetness / honey at the end, and made me really want more.

S: Beautiful white grapefruit all over the place. Hints of grape jelly and noticeable crystal malt scent.  T: Wonderful white grapefruit comes right out smooth. Some lemon too. The bitterness swings in afterwards all the way through the mid swig balanced by a nice malt profile represented by raw dough and light biscuits. Incredibly unique finish to this beer. Alcohol comes well after the finish for me.  M: Its very light and foamy. Keeps the drinking easy and not offensive.  O: I loved this beer. It had an incredibly unique malt and hop profile that mixed extremely well with the light body. Very drinkable.

287,1093,SWMeyer4141,4.21,"I had this beer in my hands about 6 months ago but my mother-in-law drank it, then dumped it out b/c I left if in their fridge. Finally got it again, and this beer is not leaving my fridge.  Appearance-Light orange color with alot of haze. Very large head, pretty much white which leaves a some solid lacing. After 5 minutes head is still reasting on top.  Smell-Citrus Hops, and alot of it. Can't detect anything else really, citrus aroma is still nice though.  Taste-Sometimes simple is better. I've been drinking alot of DIPAs lately so it took me a few minutes to appreciate this beer. It tastes like grapefruit, lemon, a little bit of grass. A perfect amount of sweetness. Very simple, but perfectly refreshing. Would like to try this with food, chicken or fish.  Mouthfeel-Medium bodied. Just enough carbonation. Leaves the mouth with a nice refreshed feeling.  Overall-This is what an IPA should be like. Hops and Citrus, well balanced and drinkable. Is this beer as good and complex as some DIPAs, No. But for an IPA this is perfect, little to no complaints. I could easily drink a 6 pack, and wouldn't be totally on my ass, but have to save for a side by side with Jai Alai.  (7/31/11)-Exactly 4 months later had a fresher bottle and just as good.

S- Quite a balanced aroma for an IPA, citrus hops dominate with a little pine scent as well. Malt is also present though with a nice sweet, caramel malt present.  T- Still balanced and is awesome. Grapefruit hops are the first to notice but the sweet malt is still there. Slight pine flavors as well in the middle. Finishes with a citrus-bitterness that makes me beg for another drink.  M- Medium body and carbonation. Nice alcohol warming that comes in at the finish, relatively crisp in the mouth.  O- Awesome and probably my #1 IPA, reviewed this from a bottle but have had it fresh at the brewery and its even better then, I recommend this to anyone and usually have a few in my fridge to prove it to people.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,stakem,4.1,"Review from notes taken on 3/10/11. On tap at Als of Hampden served in a nonic. This brew appears a hazed golden orange color with a thin ring of white around the edges of the glass. Bubbles constantly rise to the surface maintaining a thin lacing atop the brew.  The aroma is citrus hop goodness like orange rind, zest, flowers and grass. It is a very bright and enjoyable aroma displaying a depth of pleasant hop characteristics.  The taste is rindy and bitter with citrus hops that are backed by a bit of a toasty caramel malt sweetness that is a good contrast to the hoppiness. The hops are quite citrusy and grassy with a pleasant warming effect from the alcohol. It finishes sharp and bitey from a combination of the abv and hops.  This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is easy drinking and enjoyable. Quite crisp and refreshing this is always a standby brew that is enjoyable on nearly any occasion.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,AndyAvalanche,3.88,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada Snifter. The appearance is good. It comes out a citrus golden color, with some pretty good clarity. The white head was pretty big with an aggressive pour and it provides some very good lacing. Lots of different sized bubbles and there the head sticks around for most of the session, good looking IPA.  Smells good, like most IPA's the hops jump out at you. Citrus hops jump out at you the most. There's a slight sweetness in the smell too, almost a natural sugar to it. There really isn't much else to say here, it's pretty straight forward. I just wish it was a little stronger in the smell.  Taste is a step up from the smell. Slightly complex balance between the malts and hops. Again the hops are the stronger more dominant features in the beer. Citrus zest bitterness is the by far the strongest feature of the flavor profile. Still it's pretty well malted, there are slight features of pale roasted malts that provide a little bit of sweetness. A good tasting IPA overall.  The moutfeel is good, light bodied, and pretty refreshing. It's pretty smooth and has a slightly earthy finish, but overall clean. A pretty drinkable IPA, but gets better if you slow down and let it warm up. All in all it's a very good IPA, I've heard a lot of good things about this beer and I think it's pretty good. I'd like to have it a little more accessible to me to give it more of a chance, but I'm glad to have the opportunity to drink and review Two Hearted Ale.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,flipper2gv,4.69,"Thanks to BEERchitect for my first taste of Bell's offerings.  2 months old bottle (due to international shipping issues, it was really really fresh when he sent it the first time).  A: Quite aggressive pour gave half a finger of a pure white creamy looking head. The beer itself is definitely blonde and it is almost translucent. Retention is ok and lacing is pretty good.  S: There is a lot of juicy red grapefruit in this. Lots of pineapple, mango, apricot and orange/lime juice in this. Juicy and exotic. There is also a fair amount of piny hops and mint in the smell. Also, there is a solid malt backbone to the smell that shows in caramel and honey notes.  T: WOW, this goes straight along with the exotic fruits of the smell with the red grapefruit, pineapple, mango, apricot, orange juice. Again, solid amount of piny hops and some mint. Now, the malt backbone is very solid: you get honey, caramel, cake, biscuit. Very very good and balanced.  M: Medium to heavy body with medium carbonation. Not sticky at all.  O: This is the king of the regular IPA (IMO, didn't taste them all). This is, again IMO, better than Blind Pig. Although Blind Pig was really good, it was only hops and some sweetness that would make the overall beer taste more ""juicy"" (IOW, giving the sugar to the hops to make the beer taste more like exotic fruits). Extremely drinkable, I cannot recommend this enough. I can't imagine how good it must be when it is really fresh.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,honkey,3.77,"Here is my re-view... I am keeping my original review at the bottom, but I have realized that the first bottle I ever had of this was very old and it is not fair to the brewer to leave that review without an amendment.  Appearance: copper color, large head, slightly hazy  Smell: Citrusy hops, slight pine, little bit of sweet crystal malt  Taste: this is what I was looking for so many months ago... This is delicious. A little bitter for my taste and I wish there was a little more hop flavor, but definitely solid  Mouthfeel: Nice fairly dry with medium carbonation. Very easy to drink. Possibly the best part about this beer  Overall: A nice mild IPA. Very refreshing and while not over the top with hops, a very good representation of the style  After a few months away from beer due to a nationwide tour, I was really looking forward to trying a nice hoppy IPA.  Appearance- Good amber color with a white head that recedes to a thin layer of fizz. Slightly hazy. Assuming the haze comes from the vast amount of hops.  Smell- upon opening the bottle I got a pretty good whiff of floral citrusy hops without even meaning to. When poured, it smelled completely delicious. Centennial hops for sure! I am really looking forward to this!  Taste- What a disappointment! Blue balls at it's finest! The initial taste was citrus and floral just like the smell, but that initial bitterness faded very quickly to an unpleasant cloying sweetness. I do not know if this was what was intended by the brewer... Definitely not what I expected.  Mouthfeel- not dry like I expect my IPAs to be. The thickness combined with the sweetness are not what I expected at all.  Drinkability- I gave away half of a 6 pack because I just could not get into this one. The three that I kept I drank on different nights because I could not have more than one a night.  Should I try a fresher bottle or hunt out a place that has it on draught maybe? It was not skunked, had no freshness date so I have no way of knowing if the hop flavor just faded or what was going on, but there was no hint of hops flavor after the very initial touch of the beer on my tongue. Overall, this was a huge disappointment for me. Maybe if I find it on draught and I know it is fresh I would give it another review.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,scelesti,4.45,"Brewed in the Great Lakes state :) Pour from bottle into glass mug.  A - Tall frothy head, plenty of foam here. Medium golden blonde in color.  S - Mmmm! Smells like walking through a citrus grove. A bit a grapefruit, a bit of lemon, some pine mixing with a tad of sweet caramely maltiness.  T - Well balanced maltiness in the background, a touch of light caramel. Citrus and pine from the hops, plenty of grapefruit; assertive, but not too much. The bittering hops on the finish are not at all overwhelming.  M - Creamy and delectable.  O - A great IPA from a great brewery; a balanced counterpoint of malt and hops. Thank you sir, may I have another?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,suspect,3.8,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: Cloudy, orange in color. Relatively aggressive pour yielded a one-finger head that disappeared quickly. Slight lacing that didn't stick around long either.  S: Hop-forward, slight citrus. Not overpowering on the olfactory here.  T: Hoppy spiciness. Not a lot of anything else. Some citrus to it, malty sweetness at the back end.  M: Light, yet creamy, lots of little carbonation bubbles.  O: Overall this is a solid beer but not one that blew me away. Nice and balanced, light and delicious. I could easily put away a few of these in a sitting.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Grapefruit beer. Grapefruit beer. The malt takes a back seat to a nice, clean citrus, grapefruit hoppiness. Not overbearing, it doesn't shred the tongue but certainly bitter. This is a perfect american IPA.  M) Medium. Medium carbonation.  O) This is what I want in an American IPA. Enough malt to provide balance but it is in the background. So good. So good.

287,1093,OddNotion,3.93,"Batch 10207, February 9th, 2011 according to the Bell's site.  Poured from the bottle into my Bell's standard pint glass.  Appearance: A semi rough pour produces minimal head which recedes very quickly. It pours a transparent burnt orange color. A nice lacing remains for the remainder of the drink.  Smell: Not too much for the nose on this one. I find a little spiciness followed with some sweetness.  Taste: This is one damn tasty beer! I really like that Centennial hop flavor. From homebrewing I know the smell and taste of the Centennial hop and it is really apparent on the back end of the tongue and lingers around until the flavor leaves the mouth. The hop is really all I notice throughout the drink, when straining to taste more I do get a little of the spiciness, but that is another property of the hop. There is a nice bitterness present.  Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation. This brew has a full mouthfeel for an IPA.  Overall: If it were available to me normally I would likely make it a regular. I did try it side by side with Founders Centennial IPA a few weeks back, I liked Two Hearted better and Founders is a semi regular in my fridge. Seek it out, it did not blow me away but it certainly is a great IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Scotchboy,3.75,"Thanks schwaeh. Bottle code 10199, packaged Jan 31st. 12oz bottle poured into a nonic.  A: Very hazy golden straw, lighter than most IPAs. An aggressive pour yields a smallish head but lacing is pretty good.  S: Floral floral floral. Citrus underneath, pineapple and papaya. Sweet, spiced breadiness. As it warms I think the soft fruit and honey come front and center. Its nice, but soft and subdued.  T: There is a nice lingering bitterness. The fruitiness and sweetness are there but they are subdued. There is an earthy, piney hop flavor, and the malts and spiciness are both there but not in the foreground. Not loving it but its ok.  MF: Fuller bodied than most single IPA's that I'm used to. Creamy and drying with some crispness. Nice mouthfeel.  Overall: Under-whelmed with this beer, not sure if it has started to decline since its bottling in January. The aromas and flavors were too light for me, although the bitterness and mouthfeel were spot on IMO.  The way people rave about this beer I'd love to try it again and see if my palette was off tonight.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S: Citrus hops strong as expected, but you can also smell the biscuity malt as well.  T: Just like the smell, strong citrus hops with some well balanced malt. This is an excellent example of an American IPA, one I love. Minimal bitter notes compared to other IPAs.  M: Thicker and more syrupy than normal for the style, but enjoyable.  D: Excellent taste, smell, mouthfeel, and appearance, hard to go wrong with a Two Hearts.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,litheum94,3.39,"12 oz bottle. Thanks to LiquidBread219. No bottling dates.  A giant, rocky, off-white head explodes out of the bottle, leaving strata-like rings on the glass as it settles, which is a good amount of time. Golden amber body.  Lemon citrus hops, with some wood tones. Backbone of biscuit malts. A little touch of tropical fruit sweetness.  Sweet lemon, which reminds me of lemon Trix in a weird, but good, way. Dry, bready malts mid-palate. Sets up an earthy, woody, hop finish. Not very bitter at first, but the bitterness slowly creeps on, leaving a piney flavor in the mouth. A slight honey flavor starts to develop as the beer warms. Lots of carbonation leads to a very crisp drink.  I've been waiting a while to try this, and I have to admit, it didn't knock my socks off. That said, it is an enjoyable IPA, and I would never mind having one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,greenmonstah,4.22,"12 oz bottle into pint glass  A - Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a finger of off-white head. Retention is average, head turns slowly into a soapy lace. Excellent lacing and plenty of bubbles.  S - Such a gorgeous hop bouquet. Floral and citrus hops dominate, and it smells irresistible.  T - Plenty of bitter hops. Bitter citrus and a bit of floral/herbal hops. Follows with a toasty and caramelly sweet malt base. Finish has some kind of soapy bitterness and lasts for a while.  M - Medium to light body with a ton of carbonation. The body makes it very drinkable. It's very good.  O - Overall one of the best IPAs around. Comes close to Sculpin, but not quite. For less than 2 bucks a bottle it's fantastic. Goes down easy and is an exciting and dynamic beer to drink. A lot of flavor and a brilliant aroma make this beer a classic.

I poured this beer about 8 minutes ago and i still have a thick frothy 1 inch head. The reason i still have this head is that there are still thousands of bubble rapidly rising towards the head and adding to it. In fact, in the 2 minutes it took me to type this, the head has actually grown a few centimeters.  I think it's safe to say the greatness of this beer is directly corrolated with the craftsmanship it took to create this long lasting delcious carbonization.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,b3shine,4,"It's good, draft or bottle. I'd describe it as a beginner's ipa because the hops are masked by the honey (as they are in Hopslam, just less pronounced).

I'm getting a little taste of spicy alcohol in the middle.  M: I thought the mouthfeel was medium-light, a little sting on the tongue from the hops.

287,1093,beerdown77,4.3,"Two Hearted Ale does not disappoint. I heard a lot about this beer before I tried it. I understand why it carries such a likable reputation. To be widely accepted, I think you have to have a fairly non-offensive taste. This leaves out any wacky nuance that you might find in other beers. I think this is a crowd pleasing staple. I liked the golden orange pour and two fingers of head. The flavor was hops and citrus, but not overpowering. This could almost be described as an aggressive pale ale.

On the nose there is a huge mixture of oranges, grapefruit, fresh cut grass, and a hint of a caramel backbone. This nose is unrealIn the mouth there are grapefruits and oranges hanging out over a malt background that never gets in the way. It's balanced very much towards the citrus bomb part of the IPA spectrum, but it's still balanced. Later some spice and bitterness that hangs with a fuzzy finish. It's a medium body, thin enough to not stick at the sides of the palate, but the huge hop presence means it's a long finish. This is a truly great IPA, a desert island type beer, and it's available all year round in a large chunk of the country.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,veinless,4.27,"Huge shoutout to my main man Jesse13713 for this brew - thanks a lot Jesse!  Pours a tripel-esque yellow with a large dash of orange to let you know it's still an IPA. Head is half a finger, dissipates quickly but leaves an enormous amount of lacing - there are actually only a couple unlaced spots where the head was. If only there was more head in the first place...oh well it still looks good.  Nose is floral and tropical, with excellently balanced pineapple and grapefruit notes. A bit of pine is evident, but this is mainly a fruit and flower bouquet. Slight stickiness on the nose has a fruit juice quality, and is quite pleasant.  Taste has more grapefruit citrus than the nose, with the bitterness softly rind-like. Pineapple is also very evident and is the right level of sweet. Piney quality comes out much more after the initial fruit start, and is a bit too strong for this beer in my opinion as it was a very soothing and smooth beer before this. Nonetheless, it adds another flavor that I'm sure most people enjoy based on its rating. Malts add sticky sweetness that leads to a semi-sweet, half dry finish that is quite pleasing.  Mouthfeel is a perfect match to the taste, as it is light while offering enough fullness to back up the flavors. One of the better balanced beers I've had, and this allows it to be incredibly drinkable as well. Great beer aside from the unneeded pine.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Retention was flawless. Very good lacing.  S- Caramel, citrus, hops, and a hint of pine. Very subtle malt notes. Easily overlooked  T- Wonderful. The start is filled with sweet caramel and citrus. Aftertaste is a grassy, lemony, hoppy, grapefruit. The aftertaste lingers. One of the best IPAs I've ever come across.  M- Carbonation was perfect. Spot on.

T- Extreme bittering hops overwhelms the opening touch on the lips and tongue, but milds out to a pleasantly smooth and sweet malty tingle.  M- Medium bodied and very bitter sweet.

Offwhite 1 1/2 finger head that leaves a bit of lacing. Smell: Straight citrus and pine. Taste: Citrusy: grapefruit and a bit of orange. Hops hit right away with some malts at the back end that finishes out the beer perfectly. Incredibly balanced beer. Slight layer of hops coats the mouth, though not overpowering. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer with a bit higher level of carbonation. The higher carbonation works well in this beer. Overall: Awesome. One of my favorite beers; it's hard to find a fault in it.

My local craft beer bar is pretty good about clean glasses, so the pour is pretty consistent in that the bartenders know how to pour correctly...my early adventures into IPA's brought one noticable flavour to my mouth...grapefruit...the funny thing is, I hate grapefruit, but the flavor in a beer just works and Two Hearted nails it for me...I've grown to be a fan of Centennial Hops, and the consistency of this beer brings me joy.

287,1093,haazer,4.37,"Poured this into a pint glass. According to the batch finder on Bell's website this was bottled on February 9th, hopefully its still relatively fresh, should be.  A- Beer is a golden color with orange highlights, and a burnt lemon skin. The head forms well, thick and bubbly, about one a half fingers worth. Good amount of carbonation rising throughout the beer. Theres good amounts of lacing left on the glass where the foam subsides.  S- Great citrusy aroma upfront, blended with tingey centennial hop aroma. Good balance in aroma as pale malts are detected at the end of each whiff. Also a little bit of lemon zest and orange peel.  T- A great balanced IPA. Earthy hop flavors sting the tongue initially. Then lead into a pale/caramel malt base that keep the hoppiness in check. But at the end of the gulps I'm taking theres a pungent hoppy bitterness that comes back. The citrus is very slight in the background. Phenolic alcohol can be tasted, but is not an overbearing flavor.  M- The brew is medium bodied, and feels leafy throughout the mouth. Good tickle from the carbonation, as well as the prickling sensation from the bittering hops. They go together quite nicely.  D- This is a great drinking IPA. One of the best bittering IPA's I've had but it doesn't abandon the malt bill. I'll be looking for this one more often, would love to find this on tap somewhere.

287,1093,Kelly88,4.36,Had on tap. Served in your standard pint glass.  A- very large off white head probably about 2 inches. Color is dark gold and is non translucent. Lots of lace hugging my class. It looks like I just squeezed some soap in my glass.  S- very floral hop aroma. That is mixing with a touch of grapefruit. Pretty strong nose.  T- lots of earthy floral hops upfront then on the finish you get the citrus fruits and more floral notes. Malts are there at first but quickly swallowed by the hops. Not balanced but a great hop forward brew.  M- light medium bodied that has a little bit of prickly feel. Not anything wrong here. I like the prickly feeling with bitter brews.  D- this might be one of the most drinkable ipas out there. I could and regularly do put down 4-5 of these no problem. If you like ipas you could drink this all day and all night till you pass out.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,gdrydenc,4.13,"Thanks to a generous BA trader for this one!  A - Pours a nice golden straw color. A finger of thick white head sits atop the liquid and slowly dies down, leaving fingers lacing the side.  S - Fruity, hoppy. I can tell it's pretty balanced just by the smell, which I love. Grapefruit is the main fruit I'm getting out of it, maybe a few other citruses.  T - The grapefruit remains in the taste, but slightly more subdued than the smell. The front is fruity and slightly bitter, but the finish is clean with a good amount of malt. I love a beer that finishes strong, as I take time between my sips. I think I may have  M - Slightly creamy, the carbonation is good. I would like this to be a little bit thicker (syrupy?) which I rarely find myself saying, but it seems a bit thin to me.  D - Excellent drinkability. I like this beer a lot and I wish that it was available near me!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,haddon,4.33,"pours a golden yellow that reminds me of the bales of straw I used to load in the barn during those childhood KY Autumns. nice thick three finger head that tickled my nose on the first couple of sips.  citrus hops all over the nose. like cutting into a fresh grapefruit when the juices splash all over your face. there is a sweet and malty backbone hiding out to bring balance but mostly citrus all the way.  first sip says... nice! grapefruit and clear citrus explosion all over the place. just like on the nose, there is a sweet malty note that brings balance. the piney bite hangs around throughout the whole beer. really likes how it holds up.  medium body with nice clean and fresh finish  could drink this all day long on draft. as is case with many IPAs, much better fresh off the tap than out of the bottle. I believe it's genius is in it's subtlety... and in an over-the-top American craft beer scene, that's not easy to do.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S- Strong IPA smell but some malt and some other flavors in this smell i can put my finger on.  T- malty PA with a hint of orange, lots of pack from the booze that makes this a more flavorful sipping beer. Citrus and floral hops gives it a sort of balance.  M- Big taste for me, that leaves a sharp after taste. The carbonation is nice and the citrus balences the flavor.  D- Not a top on my list, but a good choice for somebody trying to get a good american IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,heysuz,3.37,"Intro: 12 oz. bottle served in a tulip glass  Appearance: Thin head, less than a finger's width that does not stick at all, honey colored, slightly cloudy.  Smell: Can smell the hops, but not very strong, one dimensional.  Taste: Bitter or maybe slightly stale after taste but good hoppy tone and dryness to it.  Mouthfeel: Dry feel with a strong after taste, low carbonation.  Drink: Somewhat under whelmed in general, but would be a good starter beer for introduction to APA/IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,OldEngineOil,4.45,"Very good, easily accessible and affordable beer. One of the best craft beers in Michigan and it is available everywhere around that area. Bell's Expedition Stout is also a good one to try, although slightly less common, at least on tap. Maybe Michigan should shift its manufacturing from cars to beer. They seem to do pretty well on the beer end.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Brunite,4.74,Not much really needs to be said here.  All aspects of this beer make it a top model for the style. Taste and smell are perfect. Love the grapefruity citrus notes perfectly balanced against the malt sweetness. Hopslam's little brother and one of my favorite beers.

Smell: Sweet citrus and herbal hops with some malt as well.  Taste: Citrus peel hop bitterness with a mild herbal note as well. A mildly sweet malt taste in the background. The hops stay on the tongue throughout the sip. Very crisp.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a good amount of carbonation for the style. Smooth with a very dry finish.  Drinkability: I really like this beer. I think it is very well balanced and I'll definitely come back to it.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S- Very earthy/floral hops upfront, also getting citrus notes and a nice hint of malts giving a nice balance.  T- Not as big as the smell. I feel that the hops are good and bitter, but one-dimensional.  M- Smooth, medium body, crisp.  D- This is a good easy to drink IPA and really happy that I got to try it! I would not drink this all the time if I could buy it near me, but definitely would try to work it into trades if the other person had some to trade.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,GarthDanielson,4.08,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a slightly hazy orange-gold coloring with about two fingers of big-bubbled, airy, light white head. There is a heavy, fresh green hoppy and cedar aroma to it. In mouth, the beer has a smooth, sweet citrus foundation with green, bitter hops blooming into your tastebuds. Grapefruit highlights keep everything very well balanced. There is a quick, smooth finish, with bitter hops and very slight citrus balanced aftertaste. Extremely tasty, and the beers disappeared rather quickly from my fridge.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Janderson91,4.01,"I've had this beer many times and it's one of my favorite IPAs that are readily available. Batch number 10207, packaged on 02/09/11, enjoyed on 03/02/11. Pretty fresh considering how long it usually takes stuff to reach the beer wasteland of Alabama.  A - Poured into a DFH pint glass. Good looking light gold color with just slight haze. White one finger head, leaves splotchy lacing. Good looking beer.  S - As fresh as it is, the aroma seems somewhat muted for an IPA. What I can pick up, however, is quite good. Nice piney, resin hops with a good malt backbone. Quite fruity as well.  T - Taste is nice and balanced. Good sweet, nutty malts with a big hop bitterness. Citrus, resin, pine, and some fruity hoppiness. I'd like this bitterness to linger for a little longer but other than that, a very good IPA.  M/D - Mouthfeel is just a little thin and doesn't leave the taste on the tongue for quite long enough. Not bad though. That being said, I can drink this stuff like water. Delicious and very drinkable.  Another tasty one from Bell's as always. It's very good for the price and always available. Good stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,StJamesGate,4.42,"Pours hazy lemon-orange with a stiff white head. Big, oily fresh Centennial nose with some sour branch underneath. Orange hard candy malts - marmalade on toast, others have said - with lots of floral and resin hops that sit on the tongue with a sherbet creaminess. Perfumed finish and a salty linger. Medium, chewy and incredibly round and smooth.  Lovely! After a day of tastings, even with a fatigued palate and a fuzzy head, this stood head and shoulder above everything else. A big, silky, orangey, compulsively drinkable IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bertram,3.85,"Pours to a cloudy golden amber with a nice, one-finger head. A flavorful beer that is heavy on the hops, with a nicely balanced level of carbonation.

Nose is a bit plain; not much going on. A whiff of straw?  Not as asserive with the hops as I remember. Good hop bitterness, but nothing crazy. Maybe all the other BIG IPAs have spoiled (?) me, but this one is kind of underwhelming.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Dave128,3.82,"I've had this twice from a bottle and once on tap. The first two times I had it, bottle and then on tap, I wasn't too impressed. I was ready to write a mediocre review for this one with this last bottle, but it is surprising me! Let's see...  A - Beautiful hazy golden. Head is not too impressive, but lacing is quite nice.  S - Smells wonderful. Probably one of the nicest smelling IPAs I've had. Super citrusy, floral, and piny. All hops.  T - Very sweet and nice up front. citrusy in the middle and like sucking on a pinecone in the finish. VERY bitter beer. The first two times I had it, I thought it was extremely unbalanced. This go 'round it is still a little rough on the palate, but the other flavors pull it through pretty well. As with the nose, its all hops.  M - Crisp and nice. about medium body with very nice levels of carbonation.  D - Hmm... This one is kinda hard to call for me. I'm pretty impressed by this particular tasting, but I remember barely being able to finish the other two. It seemed like they were just liquid hop oil. Not much flavor too much bitterness. By this tasting I'm intrigued to try it yet again if given the opportunity, but it is just a little too pungent and I don't think I will be actively seeking it out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,tbrown4,3.93,"12 oz -&gt; Weyerbacher tulip. Gift from my buddy Frank in Allentown, PA. Have had this several times before. Always a welcome addition to the fridge.  A - Bright gold, full two finger frothy head. Steady card bubbles. Sticky netted lacing stays through to the end.  S - Light orange and lemon, mild bready yeast, light hop pressense  T - Very hop forward. Carb helps this to feel crisp and clean. Light peppery notes. Malt is not nearly as present as in the nose. Nice bitter hoppy finish.  M - Heavy carb feel, other wise pretty light mouth feel.  D - The ABV is right about where I want most beers. After two you're feeling in just a tad but you can still fully enjoy it. I really like this beer as a solid go to IPA, an excellent representation of the style. I'd buy this as often as I could find it. I wish Bell's was in MD.

287,1093,TCHopCraver,4.62,"I can't believe I've never reviewed this. It's go time. This is Batch 10199 and the Batch Finder tells me that it was packaged on January 31, 2011. Yummy freshness to come.  Two Hearted pours a beautiful, see through, golden-amber-orange that just sparkles when held to light. Poured into a 23 oz. snifter, a one finger, eggshell white head forms. There are a fair amount of carbonation bubbles in the body and they move at medium pace. The lacing is phenomenal. Even when it is still quite cold and I haven't yet imbibed, beautiful spindly patterns blossom on the sides of the glass post-swirl.  The aroma brings pure hop goodness to my nose. Pine resin, cannabis, fresh, dewy grass, grapefruit, and earthy metals are derivative of the all-Centennial hop bath from whence Two Hearted is born. It is something else, this aroma. Deep inhales reveal just enough of a caramel and toasted malt balance to keep the runaway hop train from flying off the tracks. But, mostly, hops just assault my nose.  The taste reveals a much more appropriate balance of hops and malt; I mean, good Lord, my tongue would suffer from hop shock (ooh, that's a good name for a hoppy beer), wither, and fall out of my mouth if the taste was as hop-alicious (another one! Bam!) as the smell. That said, the bitter, resiny hops still rip at the sides of my palate as the sweet malt flavors blanket my tongue. So citrusy, so bitter, and so delicious is Two Hearted. I should note this: when I was not as much a beer geek as I am now, whenever I drank Two Hearted, it made me think of eating carrots. I'm not sure why, although I am guessing the earthiness of the hops made me taste earthy carrots. Actually, the last sip I took was quite carrot-y.  Two Hearted's mouthfeel is abusive and is really just what I seek from an American IPA. The hops just bombard my bitter receptors as the malt sweetness tries to coat my tongue and make me feel a little better. In the end, they don't and I couldn't be happier. This is a saliva-sucking IPA and makes my mouth feel quite hoppy in love (damn, breweries should be reading this for hop-named beer ideas).  Well, you can probably guess after this gushing review that I think Two Hearted is drinkable. And you're right. My only critique would be that T.H. that is this fresh would just wreck my palate and leave it in a sloppy mess after two or three of them. That's just the price one has to pay for fresh, hoppy beer, though. One of my all-time favorites and an IPA that I will be enjoying until I die.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jessycho,3.97,"A - Looks great, perfect golden honey brown. In fact, looks purer than honey.  S - Great smell! When first opened reminded me of an old breakfast cereal, can't put my finger on which one. Almost smells like a Froot Loops or Apple Jacks. Definitely traditional piney scents, with great citrus notes. You almost wish Pinesol w/ Lemon, smelled like Two Hearted.  T - Great, crisp taste. With a perfect bite, like stepping on perfectly crunchy leaves right at the break of fall. If, like me, IPAs aren't your favorite, try to hold it in your mouth and tip your head back a little forcing it to hit the back part of your tongue. You should get less pine, and much more citrus. And if you really like the pine taste, this trick might help you appreciate almost an entirely different beer.  M - Feels fine. Take smaller sips, savor it, enjoy it, embrace it. Take note of where it hits you on your hard palate (roof of your mouth) and where it naturally lands on your tongue. Not too much carbonation, which results in an overall pleasant feel, (I prefer more carbonation though).  D - Definitely one of the better drinkable IPAs. And coming from someone who's not the biggest IPA fan, that should mean a lot. If you have a friend who prefers wheat ales or lagers and you're trying to broaden their horizons. Two-hearted is a great way to get their foot in the door.  Cheers",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,richkrull,4.74,Got this one from Trader Joe's in Madison last weekend. This will definitely not be the last time I have this beer. Fantastic IPA in my opinion. Poured a slightly cloudy light copper color with very little head. Great hop aroma. Taste is fantastic. Plenty of hops but very well balanced and easy to drink. Very smooth. I will be looking for this one again very soon.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,nosurrender23,4,"Grade from the group = B+.  ""Nice fishing IPA - too much of a boy beer.""  First, the beer pours clear yellowish with a brown tint in color with about 1 finger of head.  Once the beer is poured, the fumes exhibited a hoppy bitterness and sweet smell with a slight pine smell like an x-mas tree. While someone else stated, ""the smell jumps on you like an Haitian at a Union soccer game.""  The beer had little to no carbonation but had a complex, sharp taste to it. As far as drinking is concerned, the beer had a smooth but not too bitter taste and a strong after taste.  Many felt the beer is more of a casual session beer like the art depicts one may grab a few of these for a day of fishing.  Finally, the beer had a smooth yet slightly bitter taste to it with a fruity after taste and long hop finish.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,RonnieBear,4.15,"Was excited to see this in my kitchen as a surprise recently, my roommate's favorite beer.  Appearance is amber, with a light orange. Not much of a head on mine, but lacing sticks around after each sip.  A fairly standard IPA aroma, with maybe a bit more floral than the typical one. Very inviting.  First sip is bitter as expected but quite enjoyable. Orange up front, dry hops, and some pine. My favorite part of this is the aftertaste. Crisp, clean, and pleasant, a beer that I find truly refreshing. Would love to have this on a patio in July with steak and not in my living room after a foot and a half of snow and no food in the apartment.  Mouthfeel is great. Excellent balance of carbonation and hops.  Drinkability is good as well, tried to savor this one, but still finished pretty quickly and felt the need to have another one.  Overall, a very solid IPA. Haven't had enough kinds to determine if it is one of my favorites or not. Still very enjoyable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Schracky,4.82,I love this beer. It is one of my favorite IPA's. It pours a golden color with moderate head. The citrus hop aroma is extremely pleasant. The initial taste is nice and bitter and then the citrusy hops take over. The aftertaste is also very pleasant. I love the hop character of this beer. It is not an overwhelmingly hoppy IPA. It is one of the easier drinking IPA's on the market and I hope the distribution reaches New Hampshire soon.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S: Lots of floral and grapefruit smells. More floral than I've smelled in a while.  T: Lots of floral taste up front that gives way to subtle grapefruit. Nice malt backbone.  M: Lots of carbonation which seems to keep this from getting to syrupy for me. Just on the brink of syrupy.  D: Enjoyed this one from beginning to end.

S- Smells of dry hops and citrus. Notes of lemon and orange come through. Reminiscent of some west coast IPAs.  T- a crisp malty taste with hints of pineapple and orange. It then transitions to a flavor of dry hops and pine. Aftertaste is malty and dry with a nice hoppy touch.  M- Like most bells beers, pretty much perfect. Excellent balance of malt/hoppiness/carbonation. Good body for the style.  D- Very nice and drinkable. With a little less alcohol this would be a great ipa session beer.

Taste is really nice. A fine hoppy base with a nicely blended bit of piney grapefruit and just a touch of malt. Just a barely detectable sweetness and perfect bitterness rounds out the flavors nicely. A great IPA.  Feel is smooth, rich, finely yet amply carbonated, and medium bodied. Very good. Kind of like a more mellow version of hopslam.  A bit more balanced and drinkable than hopslam, although that comparison would be per the brewery and not per style, since hopslam is a double.

287,1093,Gmann,3.9,"Pours a hazy golden color with a big pillowy egg shell colored head that slowly settled into a nice cap leaving some chunk lacing.  The aroma is of grapefruit and tropical fruit hops. Quite a sweet profile. Notes of caramel, honey and pepper come through as well.  The taste is of mellow tropical fruit hop flavors, with some strong pepper notes. A very sweet, bready malt brings some caramel and honey flavors. Kind of a strange AIPA as the malt is quite big. I feel that this beer actually tastes better when it is colder, seems to subdue the malt and lets the hops stick out more.  The feel is moderate to full, again quite big for an AIPA. Fairly soft carbonation leads to a smooth feel; very good balance between sweet and bitter.  A very good AIPA but something irks me about it a bit. The malt seems to be a bit too big and can be overpowering as the beer warms, giving the beer a slightly odd taste.

Very smooth tasting. Nice balance between hops and malts, that really goes down way too easily. Finally getting the bitterness half way through the glass.  M: Medium body, with slight carbonation. Creamy.  D: Definite!  I think that this beer is the best balance that I have seen between a traditional ipa and heavy hopped West Coast ipa.

Has a strong fruity citrus smell, I don't really smell hops...maybe slightly...but not as much as other people say.  As it hits my mouth and tongue I notice the carbonation and hops instantly and a strong citrus taste that fades quickly to a really nice bitterness and hoppy aftertaste I really enjoy. It has a slight fizz on the back of my throat as it fades.  Mouthfeel is a full body fizz with a slight thick feel at the end.

287,1093,Jazz1,3.91,"Well my local craft beer store wasn't really too high on this beer. But, I've learned I've got to filter what they say by understanding they are a bunch of hop heads that really like the slam of a high hopped beer. Try getting them to drink a Belgium ;)  Don't get me wrong I like incredibly hoppy beer, but you know I've forgotten how nice a well balanced IPA can be. I don't drink fast but I looked down and glass was empty.  Like I said very well balanced. Not much head. Smell was perhaps a little lacking. But a very pleasing beer. I'm glad I bought a six pack. For my hophead friends I'll do penance later with a Double Dog.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,websherpa,4.41,"Appearance: Golden hue. The first half of this beer poured very clear with almost perfect transperancy, while the second half poured with lots of clouding. This beer was shipped in very cold weather and I hope it didn't ruin the beer. The head is nearly non-existent on an aggressive pour and this is very disappointing to me. I can agitate a very small amount of inconsistent sized bubbles which quickly disappear. I'm getting carbonation bubbles throughout the session so the beer is not flat. The head just leaves something to be desired.  Smell: Teasing at what some DIPA's can do. It's floral and has a bit of non-specific citric zest to it. Pineapple but not as much grapefruit as some of the other similarly hopped beers. Probably the best IPA smell I've experienced. I can tell this is a special beer. Just a bit of sweetness from the malts. They are definitely playing second fiddle, as to be expected. On the second half of the beer (I pour in 2 halves) the beer turned noticeably sweet with a honey or caramel flavor. This started to approach the ""balanced"" point, with the finish still remaining bitter.  Taste: Right in the front there is a bit of sweetness to this beer that is nice. Let it sit and you get the hop notes from above, floral, citric zest, and pineapple. On the end there is definitely a bitterness but not overwhelming or aggressive. I wouldn't call it balanced, the hops are dominating for sure. Being a DIPA fan and tasting how good this is, I just wish it had bit more. Still this beer is well made, delicious and it doesn't kick you in the face with hops and bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Perfect. Refreshing, effervesant. Appropriately shy of medium bodied with just enough stickiness to know it has substance.  Drinkability: At 7% I wouldn't exactly say this is full on session material, but I wish I had these local to put 2 or 3 back on a weeknight. I believe the shipping may have caused some issues. It sure seemed like the beer ""settled"" like a bottle conditioned beer, although there is no mention on the bottle of this. The next time I'm in the mid-west I'll make a point of grabbing another bottle from a fresh source.  Thanks",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S - Nice nose. Citrus/floral hop smell. Sweet, fruity ike sugary mlat as well, the citrus balances nicely with it making the beer smell somewhat like pineapple and very inviting.  T - A nice dry IPA. Lets the hops shine through. Bitter taste with some citrus fruits.  M - A nice medium body. Fairly well carbonated bottle conditioned IPA.

A - Pours clear golden orange with a small half finger tall white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving thin sheets of lacing down the glass.  S - Plenty of piney hops up front mix well with a bit of sweet caramel malt and some fresh tropical fruits. Good overall balance of hops and other flavors. A classic and still one of the best.  T - A nice mix of piney and citric hops up front that last thruout the finish. Sweet caramel malt, grapefruit and other citric fruits, and a touch of bready yeast. Finish is quite bitter, lingering for some time. Good overall balance yet still plenty hoppy. Easily one of the best widely available beers out there, regardless of style.  M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Nice light feel, a bit dry, with lots of lingering bitterness in the finish.  D - I could drink this every day.

I have a couple others I love just as much, but technically this is just about perfect. Pours a beautiful hazy golden, nice bright white head and good lacing. Smells great, lots of citrus and tropical fruits up front. The flavors are immaculate and subtle. The bitterness from the hops is great, but nowhere over the top. The keyword is balance. Mouthfeel is great, perfect carbonation. It's very smooth, feels medium-bodied, maybe pushing full. Drinkability is off the charts! Alcohol is unnoticeable and the flavors are outstanding, making it very drinkable. All around enjoyable beer, even if IPAs aren't your thing.  I tend to take this beer for granted. I don't drink it nearly as much as I should. What sets this one apart from other IPAs is the flavors and balance.

T: Taste follow the smell. The grapefruit and tropical fruits are strong, but a soft sweetness is ever present.  D: Easy to down these, the 7% is completely hidden.

As the beer warms, the pine gives way to the malt sweetness. T - (Cold) - Hop and malt are in great balance, with hops dominating in the end. Aftertaste is bitter and dry. It's very nice. (Warm) - This beer appears to be more malt forward as it warms, but the hop aftertaste is still there and bold as ever. M - High carbonation, medium body. D - This tastes great, but it's a sipping IPA. I couldn't put away more than two of these in a night.  A great IPA that doesn't slap you in the face with hops. It's very well balanced, and at a ABV that should have it in the imperial IPA range.

T: very balanced bittering hop profile with light citrus and pepper notes. A strong piney taste as well. A simple yet very nice malt backbone which really makes the flavor stand out to me. A perfect amount of residual sweetness.  M: A great medium bodied mouthfeel. However, I personally thought the carbonation was a bit strong.  D: I am not in love with this beer.

287,1093,IceTrey9785,4.32,"Finally a review on old-reliable....  A: Poured the beer into a nice sized English pub glass. The color is honey gold, and a bit hazy, with a nice off-white spider webbed lacing that slowly seems to creep up the rim of the glass.  S: Pine resin, citrus, and an overwhelming notion of plastic model glue (lemony, and oily). Hints of malt character, and salted thyme and rosemary. Fresh buttered bread, and a slight note of maple syrup.  T&M: A nice dry, crisp, floral and juicy mouthfeel. A bit creamy, but packed with hoppy bitterness and sweet citrus fruit, maybe some candied ginger on the finish. Tastes of violets and zucchini blossoms dominate the floral aspect, with tangerine being the predominate citrus flavor.  How can you not like this beer? Seriously -- it has good fruit, nice acidity, a lovely perfumed aroma, and a crisp, clean, long-lasting finish! This is the craft-beer generations go-to brew.

287,1093,Hellabeerguzzler,4.62,"My opinion on this is that If a beer is ever made with a better mouth and drinkability, they'll have to add a 5.5 and 6 to the scale. Good as it gets. Appearance is good but nothing remarkable It's typical of the class in color and top which doesn't warrant a 5. Smell is tangy and citrusy. Hops are prominent and there is some backbone with a decent malt-sweetness there. Taste is very good. Easy on the tongue, while finishing with a very light sweet creaminess. Alcohol is not apparent which added to just the right amount of carbonation, makes the mouthfeel just incredible. So smooth, so drinkable. And not just for a draft or bottle but all night long, all week long, all month long, and any time of year.  Another success for Bells. Their lineup isn't perfect but still stands out as one of the top breweries in my opinion. I hate it when they place sixers of TH in the case beside sixers of DFH 60-min because it forces me to buy both.

287,1093,caskstrength,4.55,"Batch 10197, 12 days old according to the batch finder on Bells' website. Fresy fresh, so no excuses. This is an old standby, so time for a review.  Pours a gourgeous golden yellow with just the right amount of little white bubbles (carbonation) that hang on for a while. Nice looking IPA, minimal haze.  Sweet flowers with some tropically influenced (mango?) citrus on the nose. I usually shy away from floral IPAs, but this works really well. The sweetness is stronger than usual. The pine isn't strong.  Tastes are consistent with the nose. Floral sugars (what I imagine nectar from a flower to taste like), wrapped with some mango citrus, with just a bit of pine. Not much resin. Bitterness in check. The sweetness is light, it's not syrupy or thick. Clean and crisp, 12 days old helping that. No buttery notes.  Mouthfeel is perfect for the style. ABV in my IPA sweet spot.  Quite a well crafted IPA. I generally prefer more enamel peeling pine and resin, but that's personal preference. I have always enjoyed drinking this beer.

287,1093,coachdonovan,3.82,"Back when I was just getting into craft beer, I remember seeking out this beer because it was so highly rated. I probably didn't know much about beer styles then, and I scoffed at the label description, ""incredibly floral hop aroma,"" because who the hell wants his beer to smell like flowers? But at the first sniff (and sip) I was sold. Now let's see how this holds up seven or eight years later.  Pours a light gold that brings fruit to mind- apricot, peach. Pretty close to clear as the tiny bubbles float up. Head settles quickly and is the color of not-quite-fresh snow. Of course now I understand that hops don't smell like flowers, but this beer smells like hops, although it's not as pungent as others I've come across. The hops aren't scathing on the tongue, and the finish is fairly clean, and I get some late malt sweetness.  I'd like to try a fresher version of the beer - this one was bottled about nine months ago. At the end of the day it's still good and will always have a special place in my heart, but it makes me sad that it doesn't stack up with IPAs I've had since then.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S: This beer has more of a citrus scent to it than a hop scent, unlike Hopslam, but it has a slight floral hop scent to it.  T: The taste is like the nose, there are some citrus notes up front, which are followed by the sweet malts. The hops show up in the finish and leave bitters long after, the finish is also slightly dry.  M: Medium bodied with average carbonation. Has a smooth and crisp feel throughout.  D: This is a nicely balanced beer, not a trace of alcohol. Starts off sweet and finishes bitter and drinks really smooth and crisp.

Poured into my dfh snifter, pours an opaque orange-ish hue, with about 2 fingers of frothy head that subsides after about a minute. Limited lacing left on the glass. Smell- pineapple, orange peel, tropical fruit. Taste- hops are present but not bitter, and the taste is sweet and floral-like.

287,1093,paulginva,4.3,"APPEARANCE: This beer poured into a pint glass with a small 1/4"" off-white head that dissipated quickly with good lacing that stuck to the sides of the glass. Carbonation appeared to be moderate in this hazy golden brew -- just about what I expected from this appealing-looking IPA.  AROMA: The first whiff of this brew produced a very enjoyable spicy citrus scent with a floral overlay and pleasing hints of herbs and lemon. There was also a light scent of toasted malt and just a hint of yeast.  TASTE: A light toasted malt taste supported a moderately heavy hit of mildly spicy citrus with lime and floral overlays. The hops taste arrived a bit late and lingered for an agreeably long time.  MOUTHFEEL: This beer had a moderately full, creamy body with a lively amount of carbonation and finished with pleasingly dry bitter taste for a medium amount of time. The tongue hit was predominantly in the back of the mouth with some tasty tingling mid-mouth. Body lacing was good.  DRINKABILITY: This brew exceeded my expectations. I definitely would seek it out for a later treat.

287,1093,RossCain,4,"Poured from a bottle dated December, 2010 into a tulip:  A: Pours a honey/apricot hue with a fluffy off-white head that settles down to a thin ring within some time. Grips to the sides of the glass in a bubbly, splotchy pattern.  S: The sweet smell of lemon grass upfront meshed with more floral hoppy aromas. A faint, sweet caramel malt note brushes up in the finish. Overall an inviting aroma that tows the line of the standard, quality India Pale Ale nose with ease.  T: Graces the palate upon each sip with an inviting juicy and citric hop essence weaved with dominant tones of floral lemon grass propped up by a very mild earthy, resin character. Finishes with a bitter-sweet caramel malt profile in a moderately bitter manner that lingers for just a few seconds. Well balanced and flavorful, however not something that stands head an heels above all the other India Pale Ale variations out there.  M: Medium bodied and slightly sticky in the mouth with well done carbonation. Coats the palate with a lingering bitter after the swallow but it is note overbearing. Finishes with a dry and refreshing character.  D: Well balanced, affordable, and very easy to drink, Bell's Two Hearted Ale goes down as a quality example of the India Pale Ale style in my books. However, it strength is also a bit of its weakness in my opinion as it really doesn't deviate much from the norm. Nevertheless, it is more drinkable than your standard India Pale Ale due to its more pleasant (less acerbic) finish than you will find in some.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Quite a floral nose, with some honeyish sweetness and citric notes. Tastes a little sweeter than advertised, with hints of vanilla custard at times. More non-citrus fruitiness- apples and white grapes- than I recall noticing before. Of course, there's a fair amount of juicy citrus as well. Not as much pine flavor or bitterness as I recall (probably need to retry the bottled version). A touch boozy. Moderate bitterness.  Overall impression: Perhaps there's batch variation, but this didn't seem to have the same ""pop"" I remember from having it on tap.

S: A good mix of citrus and pine on the nose. Some sweet orange at first followed by grapefruit rind and pine aromas.  T: Grapefruit rind up front followed by some nice pine flavors and a decent amount of bitterness in the aftertaste. There's definitely a decent malt backbone here to balance out the bitterness, as the bitterness does not overstay its welcome and coat your tongue like in other really bitter IPAs.  M: Medium body with light-medium carbonation. The carbonation is not as heavy as it may seem at first, but still manages to accentuate the pine flavors nicely.  D: A pretty drinkable IPA. There's a nice amount of pine and bitter citrus flavor in there, but the bitterness doesn't overwhelm the palate, making it easy to drink several in a sitting.

Smell- Smells very floral with light citrus. The malts are very faint as well.  Taste- This was crisp and faint citrus. Had the IPA flavors across the board. Very much a tangerine flavor to it.  Mouth- Bottle says it. More crisp than smooth than I would have thought before hand. A little bit medium bodied with a nice high carb level.  Drink- A pretty good IPA.

Not much malt presence.  Taste - Similar to the aroma, starts with a more resin/pine flavor, then moves to a really nice citrus hops flavor. Surprisingly sweet hops finish out without an aftertaste.  Feel: Nice medium body for the style, not quite chewy, but enough to be smooth.

Nose is sweet orange and tangerine, orange peel, wet pine needles, and biscuit sweetness. Pleasant smell, but it doesn't fill the air with aroma like other IPA's.  Taste follows the nose, tangerine and orange sweetness mixed with citrus peel hop bitterness. Malt sweetness is just enough to keep the hops at bay in the finish, leaving a faint hint of citrus hops in the back of the throat.  Light bodied and well carbonated beer, sweeps the tongue clean after every swallow. No hint of alcohol, and very easy to drink.  Having had Hopslam and Two Hearted Ale on back to back nights, I think I prefer the balance of Two Hearted Ale.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,joelshults,4.34,"Appearance is a hazy, golden color with a small, white head. You can see the hop haze in this one.  The smell is fantastic. You can already smell the hops when you start pouring into the glass. The hop aroma is more earthy and piney than the bright citrus of a lot of IPA's I've tried.  The taste is a lot of hop bitterness with an earthy and sort of astringent note. The malt flavor is there, but it is definitely playing second fiddle. A good tasting IPA that is a change of pace from the citrus and grapefruit flavors that dominate a lot of IPA's.  Mouthfeel is fine. Not too thin to feel watered down, not too thick to not want to drink a couple.  Overall, the drinkability is very nice. It isn't my favorite IPA, but it is a good one. I would have no problem having 2 of these just about any time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Here's my first  Appearance: Poured a slightly opaque amber color with a good one inch white head. Slow to recede. Leaves strong lacing. Smell: Very sweet! Definitely pine and orange citrus, but the fruity sweetness reminds me of ripe strawberries. Taste: Toasted, caramel sweetness to the malt, followed by the orange and pine hop flavor. Definitely not as bold as some IPAs I've had. Aftertaste is a little off. Mouthfeel: Medium body, lightly carbonated. Pretty smooth Drinkability: Hmm...I wonder if this is perfectly fresh. I can't get past the strange taste that climbs into the nose as I swallow.

S-i can smell sweet, slightly citrusy, hops. but more than anything i smell burnt buttered corn. it smells like a tasty snack! its a very strong aroma.  T-comes in with a seemingly watered down taste of hops, this doesn't last long then there's a good after-taste of the buttered corn along with some bitterness that lasts. its not a terrible beer but a top 100 beer?? absolutely not.  M-very light bodied but with a really good creamy carbonation with a slightly dry finish.  D-its not the best tasting IPA, but its one of the better drinking IPAs i've had. what decent tastes it does possess, it keeps through out the bottle. the ABV is between lower and higher, but it drinks like a lower ABV brew.

287,1093,Vdubb86,4.15,"Served in a SA Perfect Pint glass  This beer pours a hazy light golden orange color with a half finger of white foam on the surface. The aroma is mainly earthy hop notes leaning more towards the piny spectrum than the citrus. The flavor however deviates into having much more of the citrus hop flavor. I'm fairly certain this hop character is on it's way down from ones I've had in the past, but the hops are still quite there. The mouthfeel on this is rather smooth for an IPA and there is hardly any bitterness to be found. I must say this is rather enjoyable to drink, I would like sitting outside and relaxing with one of these, except it's winter in Chicago and it's cold as hell.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,SenorHops,3.84,"This was a bottle of Two-Hearted's freshest batch. Pours a nice medium burnt orange with significant haze.  Nose was by far the best thing about this beer. Tremendous Floral and citrus aromas.  Taste is earthy floral hops with a little citrus, but the floral notes dominate with a twinge of spiciness. Citrus peaks out in the finish. Pretty complex flavors up front. Unfortunately the flavors are very subdued and I like the flavors in my IPA's to ""pop"" more. Mild bitterness in the finish along with a slightly funky taste that I can't put my finger on. Seems to sour slightly as it warms up. Mouthfeel is a little flat and thin. Alcohol taste comes through as it warms and is a bit unpleasant for a 7% abv beer.  A little disappointing considering all the hype. Though I don't think this is a bad IPA, by any means, I feel it is just good, but not great and with so many stellar IPA's available, I would not go out of my way to drink this again.

Extremely hazy, to the point that it looks like there is smoke suspended in the beer. As I turn the glass from side to side, the ""smoke"" moves as a unit. The orange color gets significantly darker as the glass widens toward the top. As I continue to drink the ""smoke"" dissipated, but man is this hazy. Lacing recedes quickly.  S: Lots or orange peel primarily, fresh citrus, with some floral and grassy notes in the background, along with a slight marl presence. The smell isn't overpowering at all, and rather pleasant.  T: Mostly citrusy hops, very close to the nose. Not too bitter but with a nice hop presence.  M: Nice and creamy. Pretty light, slightly chewy at the end.  D: Great drinkability, this is really just a very well made beer. The taste follows the nose perfectly, everything is well balanced and subtle, and nothing sticks out too much.

This is all evened out by a nice lightly roasted malt character.  T- The taste is almost right along with the smell. Alot of floraly type of hops that are combined with lemon and grapefruit citrus notes. I dont get a whole lot of malt but i do get some that helps even out the overall brew.  M&D- This is an nicely put together brew.

Nice, fine creamy head dissipates quickly leaving a quilt of bubbles which are patiently assisted with a low carbonation visibly rising to the surface.  S: cotton candy, sweet peach, pine and hemp are the highlights. Not a citrus bomb like many IPA's these days. Smells fresh, nice and unique among the genre. Quite enjoyable.  T: Again, cotton candy, bubble gum. Not particularly bitter. I'm a bit baffled, and intrigued by this beer. Bell's seems to have a different take on IPA's than I'm used to. Not bad, but different. I am obliged to say I like this.  M: Medium body with higher carbonation that spices the tongue. Leave mouth well moisturized and compels me to take another sip. Fun.  D: This beer is for the faint of heart. If I were having a tasting with a bunch of hopheads that just wanted a slam of hops to the face, I would not bring this.

Smell...oooo, fruit city, this is not your ordinary IPA...cherry, pear, pineapple, malt, and more malt. Taste leaves my mouth wanting more. Flavors of roasted wheat, peach, cherry, pineapple, pine, lemon, sweet malt barley, and piney hops. Mouthfeel was like drinking heavy cream.

Very nice  Smells amazing. Never is there an IPA that captures such an awesome bouquet of floral and fruity hops without being annoying in any way, in fact its down right mouthwatering. Pineapple, cherry and straight hop with malt undertone.  Taste is huge also. Flowers bloom into a fruit candy mix with great hop bitters and sturdy malts. Alcohol smothered in hard candy.

A slightly hazed golden peach color with monstrous ecru cap w/ light beige accent. The head measures over an inch high and haze is not too much that you can't see some carbonation in the liquid. The bead is average sized and head looks 'whipped' up. The lace sticks like glue and retention is very good. I really like the mild citrus and herbal aroma w/ mild grassiness. There is some lemony/orange aspects w/ lots of yeast esters and some floral hop notes. The feel is moderately bitter up front w/ mild astringency and mellow acidity for the style which is nice w/ moderate carbonation level and semi spicy, semi-dry overall feel with a subtle sweetness and light chalky vegetal tinge in the finish-could be from bottle conditioning.  The taste has lots of hop flavor w/out pushing the bitterness too far forward. The taste has nice herbal hops and mild citrus and spice. There is a light tropical element and mild toasted malt in the flavor w/ hints of pear and light lime accent into to the finish.

Color is a clear gold with a streak of orange. Aroma is full of fresh floral hops, lemon zest, slightest hit of pine, followed by slightly sour pineapple flavor (which is actually great!). Flavor of hops begins a little bitter, and ends sweet and sticky, with similar flavors in the aroma. Like mentioned, very sweet and sticky on the mouth.  As the beer gets lower, the aroma and taste of malts come out. There is no alcohol hotness for a 7% beer, and this is a good beer compromise between a single and double IPA.

287,1093,Chadpaq,4.52,"I'm mystified that I've never reviewed this beer. This baby is my go-to brew, the six-pack I always reach for at my local grocery store when the only thing ahead of me for the next twelve hours is a good movie and a (relatively) solid night of sleep. But it's more than that. When I travel to some of my favorite local restaurants that really don't have awesome beer selections, this is always the best thing on the menu. That isn't to say that Two Hearted is some default that one decides on when no other craft beer is available. No, sir. This ain't your daddy's...um...Sammy Adams Boston Lager. This is a true-blue, purebred IPA, so if you haven't had it, you better be prepared for sheer happiness...hop bliss...hoppyness.  The beer pours out a sort of golden-orange, much like those moons that you'll only catch when you're out in the park doing god-knows-what with your latest lover...huh? Hey, there was that one time... Okay, there's no point for personal anecdotes in beer reviews. At any rate, the beer pours a golden-orange, and it's quite attractive if I do say so myself. The liquid, though quite permeable by light, does hinder said permeation, if only slightly, through a sort of miniscule graininess within the beer. Yeast, perhaps? We'll say ""Yes"" for the time being, unless anyone calls fault toward that. Moral of this slight nonsequitur: Dis beer luk dern nice!  The smell...ah, the smell. Initially, inhalation would leave me chomping at the bit. Pure hoppy bliss! Jesus, how trite. I wonder how many times that sentence has been used. I'm probably guilty for some 40% of all-time usage. Whatever. It's so true! People say cliches become just that because they are extremely, and sometimes dangerously, accurate. Anyway, this so-called ""hoppy bliss"" transcends into a sort of fruity medley that makes me think of pure Floridian citrus: Grapefruit. Orange. Some lemon? (It should be noted that my dad drinks this stuff with a lemon. I'm of the ""No fruit in your beer"" school. Obviously, I wasn't educated by my father.) Yummy. Hoppy. Fruity. Can I drink it already? (I actually took a sip quite some time ago; I'm just too verbose to mention it.)  This beer is one of the most familiar, and most comfortable, to ever grace my palate. All of the fruity notes remain, and I also get the SLIGHTEST bit of sweet, sweet malt at the end of each sip. The alcohol, fairly high at over seven percent, is completely hidden. This beer is the quintessential American IPA in all aspects, and I think it really takes the cake in the taste department. I'm so hesitant to give out perfect scores here, and don't think I ever have, because I simply have not consumed enough IPAs to TRULY know what perfection is. Put as far as I'm concerned, the 4.5 score here might as well be a five, and I could definitely see myself editing that bad boy in the near future.  ""Mouthfeel"" is always trivial to me. It's an IPA. All IPAs feel the same to me. I'm sure that's going to run a true beer connoisseur the wrong way, but I really mean it. Hoppy beers feel the same in my mouth. This one certainly doesn't commit any injustices between my pearly whites as it absorbs into my tastebuds, but it doesn't warrant anything above a ""good"" score; it didn't speak to me and say ""Chad, I'd really like it if you bumped my Mouthfeel rating here."" Therefore, that's why it received the score it did.  I'll throw another cliche in here: If I were stranded on a desert island, and could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, it would be this guy. This is the ONLY department that I'm comfortable awarding perfect scores to, and it definitely goes to Two Hearted. No beer is more drinkable than this. It can be sipped and appreciated; it can be consumed with a good meal, perhaps some grilled chicken or seared tuna; shit, it can be swigged from the bottle on a late-summer eve just as the sun is dipping below the surf on a South Carolina beach (Yes, personal, experience.) Most of all, I could drink this stuff all night...every night...and never, ever get tired of the taste. Mondays, give me Russian Imperials...Wednesday, I'll take a Belgian Strong, if you please...But Two Hearted? Give me that fucker any day of the week.  My favorite beer to-date. Don't know if my ratings reflect it...don't care. This stuff has, literally, gotten me arrested and gotten me laid. At its core, this is all that is great about beer. (Cliche? Fuck it.)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Great carbonation  D--Great beer to get your daily dose of hops with out 'ruining' your taste buds. the 7.1% is surprising as it s as easy drinking as any sessionable IPA",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,unclejimbay,5,"1/4/2011 edit A few years later with a bit more educated palate and 6+ clone recipe homebrew attempts later. Still one of my favorite IPAs. Impressive clarity compared to most other IPAs. Impressive floral and citrus aromas and taste. So good I used it as a reference for my house homebrew recipe of an all Centennial IPA.  *** 2008 FYI, this is one of my early BA reviews, so forgive my limited knowledge and review skills to date. I may choose to re-review this one later w/ a more educated beer style knowledge, palate and vocabulary....  I will re-review this one when I can, I now know how to describe it more appropriattely as of 3/6/2009....  This review was based off a tulip style glass pour. ABV = 7.0, calories = 202 ps  APP-5.0 Dark golden orange cloudy color. Large head with impressive retention. It's great to whiff that hoppy aroma for the entire beer. I have drank many a sixers of this stuff and te head is so ready for action it froths out the top once you pop the cap. Quite fun I must say, a sort of volcano style IPA.  SMELL-4.0 Floral hopiness. HOPS HOPS HOPS, minor hints of citrus...  TASTE-4.0 Less bitterness for IPA in my experience so far. Bells did a nice job on this brew. Floral/citrus type of hoppiness, not overly bitter like some...  DRINKABILITY-4.0 A Hophead delight!. More on the floral side of hoppiness, not bitter - right on in my book.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,drewba,4.53,"A - Translucent golden yellowy orange. Pours a white three finger head and some pretty serious lacing. Looks clean and inviting, makes me thirsty.  S - Grass, lemon, a little grapefruit, some cracker, and a slight windex-alcohol smell going on.  T - Awesome malt + hop balance, both are well represented and neither overtake the other. Ok, the hops are in charge here, but the malt is great too. Loads of grass and citrus - lemon, mango, mandarin orange, a tiny bit of pepper spicyness and pine bitterness in the end of the hop profile. The malt profile is fairly pale, but definitely notes of cracker, white bread and almond.  M - Smooth, creamy, medium body with perfect carbonation. The mouthfeel + taste it so good, this isn't really a beer I put down or even consider just sipping.  D - I'm somewhat biased, because this is my go-to ipa, so I consider it a pleasure to fly through a 6 pack. I guess that in itself is a pretty high recommendation for its drinkability. I'm a huge fan of citrus forward, less bitter ipas, and this is it for me. Give me Two Hearted & Dreadnaught and that's all I'll ever need.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Cheesemoose,4.08,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Golden straw with great clarity on the pour. 2 Fingers of puffy white head. A nice film forms on top, giving a nice level of lacing.  Citrus hop aromas dominate with a crisp clean zing. Orange zest and nice toffee-esque malt base that is rather hidden, but tries to come out.  A lot of balance is achieved, but the main hop profile is rather foreboding. Orange zest with a bread/caramel malt backing. Something similar to a soapy finish. A bit sweet, and with the orange, it comes off like watered down orange soda.  Carbonation is a bit high, giving a bubbly mouthfeel at first, followed by a mild syrup finish. Very clean finish, kind of brisque, with no real depth. Yearning for more, but it is a bit lacking. The hop strength overpowers any length of flavors.  For 7.1% ABV, it is a rather drinkable IPA. I could see knocking a few of these down in a night. Might also serve as a good intro into the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ujsplace,4.23,"Poured into a nonic glass.  Pours a hazy, orange-copper colored brew that initially boasts a solid two-finger thick white head that leaves a nice chunked island floater on top.  Smells of citrus, grapefruit, piney and resinous.  Tastes of citrus - grapefruit, bright fruits - maybe mango - oily, piney resinous hops and a quick dry finish.  Medium mouthfeel, welll carbonated, refreshing and crisp - an anytime brew.  I enjoy hoppy brews. This is not over the top at all, but it has plenty of hop presence to be very satisfying. May be a bit much for those who aren't overly fond of hops, but then they probably need not apply.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Brew smells of oily resin hops. Good fruit hop nose. Floral hops as well. Very good mix of hops in the nose - great smell.  Brew is fresh crisp and tasty; bready, grainy, great fruit hops, grapefruit, pineapple maybe, oily hop resin as well. Very good IPA flavors here. Tremendously good flavors here.  This is a top tier IPA, one of the best drinking IPA's I have had. Awesome stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TheKtulu7,4.42,"A: Cloudy dark yellow with a dense, creamy head.  S: Citrusy and a bit piney.  T: Very balanced for an IPA. Very similar for the scents too. This is definitely the best IPA I have had, although it is a style I usually only like moderately.  M: Slightly prickly and crisp.  D: Very inviting. Yes.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mechamifune,4.55,"This has become my go-to IPA over the past couple years and I figure its time I got around to reviewing it.  Appearance is healthy looking golden/straw hue with a slight white head. Lacing and carbonation evident.  Smell is wonderful, lots of citrus/fruit/pine. Nothing subtle about the smell and thats fine by me. Taste goes pretty hand in hand with the smell.... finishes pretty dry, no sense of alcohol to be had. If I were to make a point of differentiation between this and my other favorite IPA's, I'd say that while a lot of my favorite west coast IPA's are hoppy with a fruity undercurrent, this is fruity with a hoppy undercurrent. Just a very unique and pleasant tasting IPA.  Moutfeel is creamy as opposed to crisp, a little syrupy in the aftertaste. Very drinkable though. Doesn't feel heavy and just tastes so freakin good that you don't want to stop drinking it. If you like IPA's you must drink this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,tgorgz,4.56,"A: I poured it into a pint glass, and the head just billowed up- a good, thick two-finger head. It stayed for quite some time. Not super-hazy, but enough to qualify it as ""opaque"".  S: About what you'd expect from an IPA- flowery, with lots of citrus. I'm detecting lemon, melon, and other tropical fruits. I'm used to lemony scents from IPAs, but this one has something different- it's the distinct melon I'm getting from the nose.  T:Very ""clean"" tasting, lots of citrus at the beginning. As it moves back through your mouth, the lemon becomes more pronounced. It's not as strong in the melon as I was expecting based upon the smell, however. The ending is quite bitter, but not a much as some IPA's I've tried. I think it's a good thing, as the bitterness doesn't dilute the other flavours.  M: Not as thick as other IPA's, but very clean and refreshing. The lingering, subtle bitterness is quite welcome.  D: Very, very smooth- excellent drinkability.  Overall, fabulous IPA- what else would you expect from Bell's?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,rrski198,4.45,"Done from some brief notes  A: Huge meraine billowing head. Sticks around. hazy with tons of bubbles.  S: Big time floral, pineapple, lemon, and citrus smell. This beer smells incredibly fresh.  T: fresh hops again with an amsome floral flavor. The citrus from the hops is great, the bitterness is intense, however, it is balanced quite nicely with the malty sweetness.  M: very dry and bitter. makes my mouth pucker. Great carbonation that makes the hops pop.  O: This is an IPA, so not much to lose your mind over. However, the freshness of the hop flavor make this beer soemthing to write home about.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,SkunkWorks,4.32,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Thanks jenray for the trade and the opportunity to try this!  Look: hazy gold colored body with a two finger white head. The head doesn't retain for very long and quickly becomes a thin layer of foam sitting atop the beer until I finish the glass. Moderate lacing is left along the glass.  Smell: citrus hops dominate with some floral characters as well. Smells quite like a West Coast IPA. There's also some resin and a bit of pale malt.  Taste: follows the nose. Bitter, citrusy hops dominate along with some mild, bready malt. Hop profile tastes closer to a DIPA than a normal IPA.  Feel: medium light, moderate carbonation.  Drink: quite drinkable and I could have a few of these in a sitting if I wanted.  Overall, a very nice beer. This is my first beer from Bells so I'm starting to see what the hype is about. It'd be nice if they could start distributing to New York! Hear me Bells? Get on that! Pick this one up and enjoy it.

287,1093,mellowmark,4.63,"Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle to an Imperial Pint glass. Batch number 10076, according to Bell's Batch Finder it was packaged on 11-8-10. $10.49 for a 6-pack.  Appearance: Golden burnt orange color. Almost completely transparent, just a slight cloudiness. Huge rocky white head with good retention and large fluffy clumpy lacing all down the glass.  Smell: Great hop aroma. Strong citrus hops just permeate the senses. I wish I could smell this all day long.  Taste: Citrus and bitter hops up front. Citrus lingers long after and massages the palate. Hop bitterness is strong at the beginning but takes second stage to the citrus towards the end.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is medium with a strong carbonation that keeps things light and lively in midst of everything else that's going on.  Drinkability: Very High  This is a great IPA. Probably the most citrus driven I've ever had.

S- Hops are a floral & grapefruit aroma that really hits you up front. Present is pine. Malt aromas are pale and restrained.  T- Hop aroma does not dissatisfy. Malt is light and bread-like. Bitterness is controlled.  M- Smooth, easy, fine carbonation. Hops resins are coating my tongue and producing a dry astringency.  D- This is a fine, everyday drinking beer. I would keep this around just because it is so clean and never really lets me down!  EDIT: Drank an (older) bottle today and it superb. A little muted, but the extra carb is fantastic!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A fluffy, pale-white head of tiny bubbles floats atop the beer and slowly fades as it clings to the glass.  S. It smells sweet and bready but that quickly disappears as it is overcome by a sharp citrus and pine hop aroma.  T. The taste is exceedingly sharp hops fighting to overwhelm the sweet, biscuitty malt character. The overriding quality of this beer is the sharpness of the hop bite.  M. Light mouthfeel with good carbonation, it is neither chewy, or smooth as it is amazingly dry.  D. A decent beer, but not an everyday go-to. it is interesting, but not compelling.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Shrews629,4.42,"Appearance - Cloudy orange/yellow color with brighter yellow highlights around the bottom. The head is very full and soapy looking. It's off white with slight orange tinges. Well endowed with tremendous retention and adequate lacing.  Smell - Strong citrus aroma of orange and grapefruit. The hops also smell a bit floral. Smells like an orange juice cake. Lovely. Even orange juice punch or something.  Taste - The taste if very similar to the smell with a plentiful amount of orange and grapefruit bitterness. The orange seems to pull through a bit more. Only a smidge of alcohol is detected. Again, an orange juice punch type of flavor. Very good.  Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel. Crisp and smooth. Mostly dry with a nice warming alcohol bite. As the beer warms, it becomes more watery. Does go down easy however.  Drinkability - This is another beer I understand why people enjoy so much. It's very good and very easily drinkable. I wish I had another one. I like how the orange is a bit more dominant over the grapefruit. Changes things up a bit. Most definitely worth a try if you haven't sampled it yet.

The batch code is ""9977"", which seems to have been bottled in early September, so a little old but not too far past its prime. Poured into goblet, as I do with most IPA.  Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy light golden color, with a white rocky head that settled after a short time. Thin lacing sticks nicely to the glass.  Smell: A light yeasty character to this beer. Non specific floral character and a slight pine are also present. I might have poured it too cold.  Taste: A tasty but standard IPA. The bitter hops make for an assertive beer. The malt backbone balances out the bitterness. The ""pine and floral"" drifts over from the smell.  Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation and body. Maybe slightly thin for the style.  Drinkability: This is a good IPA. I would drink this if I could get it more often, but they do not distribute to Utah. This is a beer that is assertive, but not overpowering. Nicely balanced.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Samashley,3.58,"This was a popular beer at the bar I worked for in Ohio. We carried many beers by Bells and I liked most of them. After the popularity of the Two-Hearted Ale in our bar, I had to try it. Now, I'm not the biggest fan of American IPA's so I'm trying my best to adjust my palate for this style of beer, but I just couldn't find my chi with this one. I liked that it tried to balance itself out with subtle citrus hues, but I just found the hops to be way too overpowering. I felt that it became slightly easier to drink about halfway through the pint, but overall the excessive hoppiness does not seem properly balanced with the rest of the beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,airheadmtrcycle,4.73,"What's up with these Michigan brewers? It seems most of the really good American beers available in Georgia are from Michigan, Pennsylvania, Colorado and California. Perhaps they've had supportive legislation longer than other states; I don't know. We don't get a lot of the great California beers, but it's hard to complain overall. But Michigan? Michigan brewers are something special, in my opinion. I don't mean to slight our Georgia breweries like Terrapin, Sweetwater, ABC etc. They make great beer too.  Another great Michigan beer: Two Hearted Ale. I've pondered the fish on the bottle only to infer a reference to the fish's two-chambered heart.  After an aggressive pour into a Sierra Nevada Becker there's 3 fingers of foamy, off-white head. Beneath is a beautiful copper/orange slightly hazy brew. The head fades slowly leaving plenty of lacing. A superior pour.  The aroma is an immediate rush of citrus hops. I pick up plenty of grapefruit and oranges followed by a sweet candy-like smell that really is tantalizing. The taste is similar. I also taste tangerines or clementines that add a complementary sweetness. My first few samples of Two Hearted Ale seemed slightly unbalanced toward the bitter side. As my newbie palate has developed or my addiction to hoppy beers has increased, this seems almost a perfectly balanced American version of an IPA. Considering the style, I don't know how this beer could taste any better.  Its slightly tingly mouth feel is quite refreshing. The body is medium, again perfect for the style. Perhaps it's more carbonated than I prefer, but that may be due to all the stouts and porters I've been drinking lately. Perhaps I'm just trying to find something that's not perfect with this IPA. It's unquestionably drinkable. I could drink a few of these easily.  Perhaps the best IPA I've had, right up there with, or probably even better than Smuttynose IPA, another favorite. The hop aroma and taste are different than any other IPA I've tried. They give Two Hearted Ale its unique and delicious flavor.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,epicness,4.44,"A: A hazy golden, bordering on amber color. Fluffly off-white head and a decent amount of bubbles. A quick swirl reveals that the beer leaves a large amount of lacing on the sides of the glass.  S: Right off the bat a huge amount of floral hops blended with citrus hops are present in the scent. Smells like a pot of fresh cut flowers. As far as the citrus goes, definitely weighs high on the side of grapefruit with some slight lemon zest and mango. There's also some faint malt scent that can be picked up. The scent pretty much dares you to drink the beer. Definitely one of the most intoxicating scents I've ever experienced in a beer. I really can't get enough of the way this beer smells.  T: Very well balanced for an IPA. I hate the IPAs that are just overwhelming with a pine taste. The best way to describe the hoppy presence is, aggressive but not overpowering. Citrus hops dominate the front of this beer. A sweet soft grapefruit and mango taste is heavily present which gives away to a lemon/pine/malt finish. Very tasty, yet not a beer I want to pound. It's so tasty, I just want to enjoy it.

287,1093,Jadjunk,4.18,"#5. First on tap review courtesy of Summit's Wayside Tavern in Lilburn. Reviews on Bells are pleasing in general and I have had their famous Hopslam Ale before (Delicious). I ordered a pint, price is decent ($5.99).  (Appearance) Beer arrives cold and has a shallow, yet fluffy off-white head, and a fair amount of lacing drapes the edges of the glass. Beer is semi-cloudy and an appealing golden amber color. Carbonation is lively. It is aesthetically pleasing. 4.5  (Smell) Quite hoppy and a good deal of authentic citrus, perhaps grapefruit scents. I sense piney, floral scents that come from some pretty fresh hops. The beer smells to have a good balance of bitterness & sweetness, although more bitter is the initial impression I get here, I can smell some faint sweet malty scents hidden within. 4  (Taste) As anticipated, the beer is somewhat bitter and has a dominating kick of hops and citrus, mostly lemony and grapefruit. It tastes like a good deal of spices have been added to intensify the taste of this beer. The malt is just subtle enough to round out the taste. It's good. 4  (Mouthfeel) Crisp from the lively carbonation, slightly on the dry side, but not overwhelmingly so. This makes this beer a pretty exciting one to consume. 4.5  (Drinkability) This is a very crisp and refreshing beer. On a night where I feel like going for an IPA, this would make an fulfilling candidate. It manages to maintain the characteristics of a typical IPA without overwhelming the drinker with overly bitter hops and an excessively dry mouthfeel. The only reason I didn't get another of these was due to my limited spending money. 4.5  Verdict: This beer boasts a lot of unique characteristics and has an impressive, well balanced body and nose that combines bitter and sweet scents into a satisfying IPA. A great starter choice for those who are wary of dry hops or hop-heavy beer. This should be tried at least once by any so-called beer enthusiast.

287,1093,StormKing47,4.32,"Been drinking this one regularly for a few years and finally a proper review. Enjoyed at my local establishment and reviewed from notes jotted on a napkin, so here it is...  A- A very enticing hazy golden color with a terrific amber/orange hue. Has a nice amount of carb that bubbles up and leads to a nice and fluffy pearl white head. Definitely very appealing and ready for further inspection.  S- Right away a great bouquet of floral hops blended with citrus hops. This one if definitely packed with grapefruit and mango aromas and as further warming reveals a nice pine with a very faint and subtle lemony effervescence. The aroma hops are definitely well blended with the bittering hops and then right before a sip I can pick up a little malty sweetness, dare I say a very, very faint caramel sweetness. Very intoxicating aroma, so glad it's fresh as hell.  T- Whoa, a rush of succulent and juicy citrus hops explode with grapefruit and mango dancing all over the place and then finish with a great lemony pine twist. I am also able to taste the very faint caramel drizzle that leaves it's footprint on the very end of the taste. It's actually unbelievable that this is a year round beer. When this beer is fresh I would dare to say it's better than the oracle. Very tasty and quite refreshing.  M- The carb is perfect for the style and it allows every drop of the juicy hops to escape for taste. Really refreshing and a crisp and sharp finish. The slight tingle from the carb is amazing and leaves you wanting more and more.  D- Absolutely a must try when fresh. It's a tremendous crafting of hops and malt to make everything balance perfectly. It's moderate abv is no problem and can definitely be tolerated.  Nice job Larry, would love to try a dry hopped version!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,OhYesILoveBeer,4.37,"Ah yes, the infamous Bell's Two Hearted Ale! Finally getting around to reviewing this beer seeing as Ive been drinking it religiously for a few years. 12oz bottle # 9953 with no freshness date poured into my Weyerbacher tulip.  Pours a cloudy orangish golden with a good looking 2"" off white head that stays around for about 5 then dissipate's into a thin film across the brew.  Smell is dominated by the Citra hops used here, and I'm more than certain this beer is %100 Citra, even in the dry hopping. This brew has a nice floral, fruity, resinous hop character and a subtle sweet pale crystal malt background. Not too much yeast character to be noticed here, most like a SafAle breed or Nottingham.  This wicked brew tastes like an awesome homebrew! Full of citrus like resinous hop flavor from the Citra's, a subtle yeasty touch, and a sweet pale malt character to back it up. Very nicely balanced in my opinion.  The mouthfeel is pretty standard for the style, even though I view this brew as a APA, not an IPA. A crisp drink with a somewhat oily characteristic to it.  Overall I have always been a fan of Bells. Yes I know some of their brews are extremely overpriced, but I seem to always go back for more. Even @ $11.99 for a 6pk at various places here in Atlanta, this brew is always a must if you see a few on the shelves.

A-Pours slightly hazy golden amber with almost a two finger, off-white head with good retention and abundant lacing. Very fine appearance.  S-Pronounced juicy citrus hops. Grapefruit is most prominent and then lemon. There is also some sweetness from the malts, and pine. I love Centennial hops.  T-Well balanced. Hops are aggressive without being overpowering. Malt backbone in finish is slightly too sweet. Juicy citrus hops are again the most prominent taste profile, especially grapefruit.  M-Very smooth with good carbonation.  D-This is a very good IPA and the best I have enjoyed brewed east of the Rocky Mountains. I have never seen this available in the PNW and probably won't have again anytime soon.

T: Awesome toasted malt sweetness up front with a little buttery, grainy flavor also. Almost immediately, a very clean, citrus and grassy hop flavor rolls over the palate, cascading into a dry, sticky, herbal hop finish. Clean brew with great flavor, nice balance and a good hop finish.  M: Medium bodied, clean and smooth, with a little alcoholic and hop bitter sting in there.  D: A very nice American IPA with some extra oomph at 7.1% ABV. The smooth blend of grassy, herbal hops and light malt sweetness make this a great all-night IPA.

Multitudes of citrus hops mingling with a fair amount of pine, a plethora of floral notes are present. Top notch stuff.  Taste: The smell I think is making me a little overly critical here but oh well. the taste is a little thin for my liking it didn't seem to pack as much of a taste punch as I was expecting initially that is. The back side of the taste is a different story altogether, a lot of tangy grapefruit counterbalanced with sweet oranges. very pleasing altogether.  Mouthfeel: Perfectly carbonated. crisp and refreshing considering the ABV, doesn't get all heavy like some other IPA's I have had  Drinkability: Man, deceptive. On a hot day or balmy summer night I feel one could go through a six pack with relative ease atleast I could.

The taste explodes with strong crisp malt flavors and a nice hop finish at the end... not too bitter. The malt balances very well with the hop notes culminating in well rounded taste. Rich citrus notes do make a light appearance and make this a flavorful and well balanced beer.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mountsnow1010,3.83,"A - nice golden color with a whiite head. Nice lacing. S - smells pretty good, a bit of grapefruit, not as strong smelling as I would have expected.

Grapefruit, orange and some floral spices.  Taste - Rather bold and thick hop flavor. Not overly bitter, nor sweet. Sort of like a fresh hop beer flavor, with extra hops. Its mildly malted, and has some spices and sugars mixed in.  Mouthfeel - Its medium thickness and the alcohol is masked very well. Will bitter tounge some but certainly not a crusher. Aftertaste is sweet and hoppy.  Overall - Its pretty smooth and easy to drink. Freshness really made this beer enjoyable. Has a nice combination or hops and malts. This is totally a go to good ipa for when you want a soild beer. At 7%, you can enjoy a few without getting messed up. Soild and very good beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Rifugium,4.1,"First had: on tap at Eulogy, Philly, PA  Pours a hazy, light, golden color, with a nice white head that leaves ample lacing. Strong nose of citrusy hops and a touch of pine. Taste is citrus, pineapple, tones of earth and grassiness. Hoppy bite, but crisp and smooth. Light-medium body, crisp and perfectly carbonated. Extremely drinkable, and I'd recommend even to people that don't care for IPAs.

S: Citrusy hops dominate the nose. Some sweet malt and yeast present too.  T: Lots of citrus from the hops. Balanced, not overly bitter. Finish is dry with some residual bitterness lingering from the hops.  M: Medium bodied with a great carbonation level giving a creaminess to the mouthfeel.  D: A great beer to sip on and enjoy.

287,1093,jchow79,4.62,Thanks to psukinger for the bottle acquired in a trade.  I have to admit that I sometimes judge a beer by the label. This label is not the coolest looking label. Last thing I want is for my beer to taste like trout. But I'm blown away by how good this beer is.  A: Poured into a snifter with a huge head. I think this attests to how fresh this bottle is. The color of orange rust - what a beautiful color.  S: Scents of pine and huge grapefruit. Brings me to a forest on an crisp autumn day stepping over pinecones while cutting into a grapefruit.  T: Delicious - the hope quality is apparent. Its not too strong like many IPAs can be. I'm a hope head and love bitter but this is nicely balanced and really a fantastic effort from Bells.  M: The beer is not thick and has a silky feel while rolling over the tongue  D: I feel like if I could get this on a regular basis - it would be my staple IPA. Unfortunately Bell's is not available in NY.  I think I love this beer!,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mattgreger,4.37,"Beer of the Night - Bells Brewery, Inc. - Two Hearted Ale - American IPA - 7.10% ABV  The pour on this brew was great from the start. It poured a nice, hazy, golden yellow color. It has a wondefully thick/fluffy white head. As it fades during the drink, a great webbing of thick lacing followed.  This brew had a great Hop heavy aroma. It hits the nose at even at the pop of the cap. It has a nice floral hop aroma at the front of the brew, then it follows wtih a great citrus hops aroma. I can almost smell apricots. This brew has a nice, slightly grassy aroma to it.  This brew tastes very much like the aroma. It has a nice floral hops flavor at the front, then a nice zesty citrus hop kick. Its got the great hop bitter, and touch of sweetness that gives it a wondeful flavor.  This brew is very refreshing. It goes down very smooth and it super crisp. It has a great aftertaste, that leaves you lingering for more. Its carbonated just right, that gives this brew even more greatness in texture.  Though this brew has a 7.10%, its not very heavy and can make a great session beer for an IPA.

Whenever I go searcing for this brew it's typically sold off of all the shelves.

287,1093,innersanctum,4.38,"Beer envy. I'll explain shortly.  Two Hearted is top of the Bell's class, and a clear stand out in its product line. If you're fond of the Midwest APA's then you will have a heart for this brew. 2H is caries an IPA designation but its character is more APA, and here's why:  The appearance is a golden coper ale, with small carbonation bubbles, a generous foamy head which leaves a creamy top.  A distinct but not overpowering citrus and floral smell.  Distinct lemony finish with citrus, and it has a crisp dry finish to the palette. Easy to drink a couple of these.  Now, back to beer envy. This is the first pack of 2H that I've had yet its been stocked on the shelves at some local stores for some time.

T: Orange and apricot citrus on the initial taste with grassy notes hitting at the finish. Less bitter than I expected.  M: Mild bitterness, smooth down the pipe, and a light dryness on the tongue at the end.  D: Smooth, easy-drinking IPA that provides a nice, refreshing feel.

Thin white head, hangs around for pretty much whole drink. Decent lacing. Fantastic aroma. Bursting citrus aroma, very sweet hoppy aroma, very bright. Good balance of sweetness. Light beginning, slight light maltness. Nice citrusy hoppy middle with Grapefruity peel aftertaste. Growler flavor was slightly darker in the sugary sweetness but still with same bright hoppiness. Overall very light, especially for having so much flavor. Everything seems very balance. Very drinkable.

287,1093,aficionado224,5,"I agree with so many of the other reviewers of this ale that it is one of the best examples of an IPA around. It may have its equals, but there are none better among the ones I've tried. It starts out smooth, then a hoppy bitterness appears, and finally a slightly sour taste emerges, emphasis on ""slight."" If you tasted some that was more than that, maybe it was too old, stored wrong, etc. There are so many I rank at the top of the scale because they are everything anyone could want from the highest quality brews but considering all the variables which so many of them hit so well only a few are in that rare stratum of perfect in every respect. This isn't the only one because there are several I could easily call best, but right now I will call this one my favorite.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S: Floral hops and light citrus hops; some lightly toasted grains and bread crust; great hop nose on this one, though.  T: Citrus rind and a little fruity; nice breadiness provides some light malt backbone; good and hoppy, yet not too crazy.

287,1093,WAN2RIDE,4.62,"12 oz. pour from batch 10064, checked Bell's site and they did not have this batch in the system so no idea as to the bottling date.  Pours a beautiful honey amber with a one finger frothy head that leaves a nice lacing around the rim. A little less than clear, but not enough to say hazy.  Smells of citrus hops and tropical fruit. Not a grapefruity aroma more a sweet tangerine mixed with pineapple and mango. A bit of sweet light malts, but the hops are, as they should be, the star of the show.  Taste is excellent! While I like other IPA's equally as much this beer rates the full A+ cannot be improved rating for flavor. Crisp and sweet with the flavors following the nose letter for letter, and with a nice hop bite on the follow through. I can't think of a better example of a sweet fruity hopped IPA, equals yes, but differently not better.  Mouthfeel is crisp and light, more of a pale than an IPA. I really like it and it enhances the drinkability, but most beers in this style have a little more body at this abv.  Drinkability is excellent I've definitely had more than two of these in a sitting, but the hops and alcohol sneak up on you. I have to have a water and some food to get a good taste of the third or more beer. The hops may be sweet, but they are potent and you stop getting the full flavor after number two thanks to their tongue lashing (pun intended) and the numbing of the alcohol.  All in all one of my favorites. I recommend it to all my friends if they ask about a good IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,sisterray,4.35,"Delicious beer.  One of the beer bros had a negative critique of the beer and questioned whether or not his experience was due to a bad batch. I'm fairly certain this was the case.  I've purchased the beer multiple times, and it's one of my favorite IPA's - let alone readily available IPA's - and I've had the same, amazing, experience every time except one.  The last time I purchased the beer, it was sour - not in an interesting, cute, fun, etc. way.

Smell is citrus and piny hops, little malt backbone as I can tell.  Taste is bready up front with a citrus hop in the middle and bitterness on the end. A good IPA.  Mouthfeel is good, nicely carbonated, should have poured it harder but a small amount of agitation fixed that nicely.  Drinkability is good, very inviting.

287,1093,BuxMontBeerLover,4.15,"Picked up at the Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, VA on recent beer run. Paid around $2 for the bottle.  Enjoyed in a DFH Signature Glass.  A-Slightly hazy, orange color. Big, 2-3 finger frothy head that disapates ever so slightly within a few minutes. Even after 5 minutes, about a 1 finger head remains. Good lacing on the glass throughout the entire session.  S-Familar IPA aromas of citrus and hops. Slight fruity smell as well.  T-Good combination of citrus (grapefruit) and a really nice malt backbone. Pine and hops are there but not a hop-bomb by any means. Nice combination of fruit, pine and hop flavors dominate this IPA.  M-Lots of carbonation. Even after enjoying this for 10-15 minutes, still getting a decent amount of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass.  D-A very nice, very drinkable IPA. Even though the ABV is around 7%, this could be a session beer, in my opinion.  Overall-A highly enjoyable beer. Being a fan of IPA's, I can really appreciate the subtle flavors that every brewery tries to impart into their beer. Bell's has done a fine job with this IPA. I'd gladly purchase again.

287,1093,aval89,4.07,"A: pours a typical orange for an IPA. Little bit of hop haze with a fingers worth of white head..  S: centennial hops!! Ripe fruits. Mainly grapefruit, but nothing too intense. Maybe even some citrus like orange & lemon.. Sweet malts pull through to add a nice touch..  T: lots of ripe fruits in the mouth. Again the predominant flavor is grapefruit.. Its not extremely strong & bitter but enough to let you know its there.. Finishes with citrus peel like bitterness but not as strong as other IPAs. Only a small hint of booze detection. The sweet malts are also noticeable.  MF: medium bodied with carbonation just a tad bit high for me, but still very acceptable.. Clean finish leaves u wanting more.  D: a very easy drinker especially @7%  Overall a very solid IPA.. Nicely balanced IMO",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Boitnott,4.37,"A: The beer looks is a dark orange, brown color. You cannot see through the beer. The head is a finger high and a creamy color. The head keeps good retention throughout the drink.  S: This smell has strong citrus notes an hops. The smell is very defined and makes you want to immediately sip the beer. The smell has an underlying sweetness to it which sets it aside from other IPAs. I would say this puts the smell in the higher range for me. The sweetness adds to the bitter citrus notes of the hop.  T: The nose of this beer has a subtle sweetness with dominating tart citrus notes like grapefruit. If you hold it in your mouth then it the hops start to become apparent but not dominating over the tart citrus and sweet notes. The finish has a lighter than usual hop taste to it. After the hoppiness goes down, a new sweet taste becomes the dominating flavor. It literally tastes like an orange. I have never tasted such a flavor in a beer before, and this aspect is what pushed the taste into the higher ratings for me. The beer becomes more tasteful after the temperature decreases.  M: The IPA is surprisingly full bodied for an IPA. The carbonation is pretty high but it balances well with the beers taste.  D: I could drink only a few of these because of the high ABV. I would recommend drinking it in Summer and not the Winter like I did. Overall a quality IPA but not if you like higher IBU beers. I highly suggest buying this beer whenever you can.

The typical hoppy, citrus smells, but also some floral and other smells happening too.  Taste is great. Bursting with hops but so many more layers to it.

287,1093,krausenman,4.02,"A-The beer poured a hazy dark golden color. The thick, pillow-like head that capped the beer was an off white and lasted for almost the enitre duration of the drinking session.  S-For a supposed IPA I would have expected more hops in the aroma. My bottle might have been dated but it still smelled pretty good. There was a faint fruitiness (like marmalade or jelly) that was mixed with a more pronounced citrus/pine-like aroma. This ended with a hint of herbs or grassiness.  T-Initially, there was some fruit flavor and sweetness that transitioned into a more malty flavor but this changed over to the bitterness from the hops. While the IBU's in the beer weren't over the top, they did seem to balance the beer out well. There was a slight astringent flavor left after you swallowed along with a grassy herbal flavor from the hops.  M-My bottle had a low carbonation level and a light to medium body.  D-This was a good, balanced beer that lived up to some of the hype that has been put out about it. It is very drinkable due to it's lower body and low level of carbonation.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,IronLover,4.45,"Poured bright copper in color with a slight haze and a strong, rocky white head. Excellent head retention that reduces to a thick white cap. Floral and citrus hop aromas including grapefruit, orange and lemon. A nice sweet malty undertone is able to sneak through to the intense hop flavor. Medium bodied with nice carbonation and a resiny feel. Very complex hop flavors, floral, orange, lemon, and grapefruit with a sweet maltiness beneath. Citrus flavors taper to allow the malty sweetness to intensify and then a light pine hoppy finish . Many flavors and aromas in this IPA. Pretty fantastic stuff.

287,1093,tewaris,4.36,"7.0% ABV (a relatively new thing from the old 7.1) OG: 1.064 Batch # 10064 poured into a Bell's tulip on 11/18/2010.  This review is special because this beer is special. This is one of the few top-notch beers that are never hard to find and never fail to delight. Strangely Bell's batch finder is returning an error for the batch number entered but I am positive that it was bottled within a month, because the previous batch of this ale is about that old.  Appearance 5/5 Slightly hazy, amber orange colored with a moderate dull white head with medium retention and excellent lacing.  Aroma 4/5 Smells of tropical fruit, specifically mango, along with massive citrus and some dry hopping induced grassy notes. Perhaps some malty sweetness is present too. A very good aroma but not strong enough.  Taste 4.5/5 Bitter, and flavorfully so, with some sweetness that combined with hops gives an impression of tropical fruit and lemon peel. Nothing too complex, but very good! The finish is not bone dry, but is still very clean with some residual bitterness and citrus flavor. Slightly warming.  Mouthfeel 5/5 Medium body because of a good malt backbone, with perfect carbonation and crispness.  Drinkability 4/5 Alcohol is a little on the high side; otherwise I could keep drinking this without getting bored.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S: Goodness. Citrus and flowers. Caramel malt. A little pine. Did I mention it smells like hops in a glass? Love this aroma.  T: Wow. I have had this beer several times now, and this is the freshest I have had yet, and holy crap is it good. Citrus fruit, floral hop and a slight sweetness from the malt. Somewhat bitter, but the citrus and malt squash the bitterness from taking over. Only thing I could ask for is a little more hop flavor.  M: Well carbonated, slick, and finishes with a clean bitterness. Nothing super, but still good.  D: Oh yes please, two please. I could drink these all night. Alcohol is hidden, the hops are nice and the malt keeps up just enough.  One of my favorites so far. Such a fantastic beer, whether on tap or in bottle.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Bonis,3.33,"A - Hazy golden orange, half inch of white foamy head, sticky lace coats the glass.  S - Hops come mainly in citrus form with some floral hints. A nice sweet malt sneaks in as well.  T - Very fruity to start out with the citrus hops carrying over to the taste. The malt comes through big in the middle, and a touch of bitterness rounds things out, but doesn't linger. Pretty well balanced overall, but not as hoppy as I would have expected/wanted. I prefer to leave the malts hiding in my IPAs. No alcohol is really apparent in the taste, but does warm a little in the stomach.  M - Pretty low bodied for an IPA. Not overly bitter, just right. Carbonation seems minimal.  O - Not quite what I want in an IPA, not nearly enough hop flavor. Will try this again in a couple years to once again see if I can like this beer as much as others do. I just don't see why all the fuss.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Lots of Grapefruit up front followed by an extreme orange juice flavor. Almost reminds me of a mixed drink combined with ""Tang"" orange drink. There is a nice light hop finish. No sort of dry puckering at the end which is prevalent in a lot of IPA's.  M - Relatively light for an IPA. It is definitely easy drinking for the style.  D - I could easily drink a few of these at ease. I remember my first time trying this beer-- I had a mini-keg of it during the first democratic primaries when Obama won Iowa. That was a great night. Either way, this beer is a favorite when I'm looking for an IPA that isn't to hoppy (which isn't often because I love tons of IBU's)  Highly recommend.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

It is a bit cloudy from the yeast in the bottle. The smell is very fruity and floral, along with some pine and citrus hop smells.  The taste of this beer is a beautiful contrast between sweet, fruity malts and spicy, piny and citrus hops. It is so smooth and flavourful. Something about the bottle conditioning makes it silky smooth, like no other IPA. It is really great.  Something about this beer (yeast perhaps) makes it much easier to drink than others. It has tuns of flavour but is not harsh or overpowering in the slightest.

Smell: Freshly mowed grass and lemony hops. Also some citrus peel as well. A good and fresh scent.  Taste/Mouthfeel: More grass, lemon, and peel. An excellent fresh taste. Mouthfeel is not the smoothest in the world, but is pretty enjoyable. Leaves a thick, bitter feel/taste at the end.  Drinkability: A decent beer to drink with food. Bitterness could be a bit too overpowering for this though.  Overall: A good beer with some unique flavor qualities.

The sip yields a fine and smooth drinking IPA, bitter at first which quickly fades and leaves a creamy citrus pine taste finishing crisp. This beer is delicious. Medium bodied mouthfeel, I feel like this beer hits all the right notes. High drinkability and really it's a shame I wont be able to make this brew a habit since distribution in NY isnt happening.

Sweet juicy hops with boatloads of citrus in the nose and a touch of fruit sweetness.  Plenty of bitterness up front with piny floral hops. Juicy citrus and zest with rind is prominent. Some lighter malt base and caramel holds flavor together but allows hops to shine. Finishes crisp and refreshing with some lingering bitterness.  Lighter medium body, dry and sticky feel. Excellent drinkability and flavor, and the alcohol is totally masked.

287,1093,mweso2000,4.45,"Two Hearted pours a hazy copper with a rich one finger white head that clings to the glass. The aroma is a floral, citrusy and rich hoppy that is pleasant to smell. This is an excellent example of an IPA. The taste is outstanding with a nice balance of hops that is not overly bitter and a slightly sweet finish. There is a perfect amount of carbonation and drinks very smooth. This is a very drinkable IPA and I would highly recommend this beer to someone who is ready to try an IPA for the first time since this is not overly bitter, yet it has a nice hoppy flavor.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MLucky,4.75,"A terrific American IPA.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle to a tumbler. (Hey, what am I gonna do? I'm reviewing this beer from a motel room on visit to the midwest.) Pleasing amber color with light persistent foam. Cloudier than most APAs.  Sweet citrus hop aroma predominates, though closer inspection reveals a hint of biscuity malt.  Taste... well, this is how it's done, people. Strong citrusy hop flavors are nicely balanced against a surprisingly light but sweet malt backbone.  Surprisingly light body.  Ridiculously drinkable. I could pour these down (if you'd give half a chance, I will).  I've seen polls that placed this beer second only to PtE in popularity, and I can see why. I can't imagine anyone (except perhaps the most pucker lipped hopheads) not enjoying this, and I would certainly rate it among the best American IPAs. I would give Pliny a solid edge by virtue of its fuller body, and its yeasty subtleties. Forced to choose at gunpoint, I might also take a Ruination, for sheer hoppy indulgence. But make no mistake: this is an outstanding beer, fully deserving of its great reputation, and competitive with the very best in its style. I'm jealous of you guys who get to drink it all the time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

More grapefruit than orange but both there.  Taste matches the smell of fresh hops which mute out some of the fruit.  This beer is well carbonated. Has typical ipa aftertaste.

S - greeted with the scent of hops and some citrus, more hops than citrus  T - a strong hops flavor with the hints of citrus that I could smell, a bit of a background flavor of grapefruit and grain  M - an easy to drink beer with a thin mouthfeel  D - very easy to drink, I think I've found an IPA that I'll drink again and again",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,knephews,4.71,"When I first tasted this beer (I purchased a six pack) at Capone's Bottle Shop in Norristown, PA), I believed it was the best IPA that I've ever tasted...Citrus, Hops, etc... Everything that you would expect from a good IPA. Then I purchased a case of it. It was a different story! The citrus bite was replaced by a hint of sourness. Bottle after bottle I tried with the same result. Who knows, maybe I got a bad case. But I'm not willing to shell out another 30 plus dollars to give it a second try.  The question remains: What does the real ""Two Hearted Ale"" taste like? My first experience or my second?  I even emailed the President of Bell's with no response. Maybe they don't want my expendable beer dollars.  Edited review 2020: I have tried this beer multiple times after this review and I stand corrected ... I must have purchased old bottles of Two-Hearted ale. It is an excellent beer and a good representation of the style. In fact, I was conducting a beer tasting for about 60 to 70 people and this beer was the one I chose to represent IPAs.

The head is solid white with a silky sheen and slowly recedes in the pint glass with a few lingering legs. A very light haze permeates the golden honey-colored brew.  Grapefruit dominates the flavor profile, with some spruce notes and a hint of sweetness cut by the alcohol content. On tap, it has plenty of carbonation to excite the taste buds and smooth out the bitterness from the hops, which leaves a post-it note on the back of the palate as a reminder.

S: Smells of citrus and hops, very 'clean'.  T: Short duration and light alcohol. Initially sweet, but it fades to a light bitter finish. Very refreshing.  M: Light body, slick texture, lively carbonation with slightly astringent finish.  D: My words don't do this beer justice. In the warmer months, this beer could be my everyday drinker.

Awesome citrusy aroma, I just can't wait to take a sip.  Huge hop explosion from the get-go. Tons of fresh, citrusy hops with an orange and grapefruit bite. Malt provides a smooth backbone with bready, grain-like flavors. Hops and malt play a careful balancing act with the hops taking the edge while still allowing the malt enough spot-light to keep it interesting. The result is an exceptional balance and a perfect combination of flavors.  Solid medium-body and perfect level of carbonation. Dry and satisfying finish.  I love this beer!

The head starts at about 1/4"", and dies down to leave only a light white lacing.  Sweetly hopped, with floral, citrus, and a hint of honey.  So wonderfully hopped - absolutely well-balanced and lovely - it's not a word I use often, but appropriate here. Reflective of the nose, with a touch of spice to close. Not heavy for an IPA though - just on the big side of a PA.  Great in the mouth - perfect subtle carbonation for this beer.  One of my favorite IPAs.

We can't even buy popular year-rounds like this.  There's a ton of head, and the light amber hue sits nicely underneath it. The smell is flowery, and the hops and hop citrus are fully present, but if you're an IPA fan, the hops in here might not impress. The taste has a bit of nutty/burnt sweetness to go along with the hops and citrus, making for a nice balance. It's crisp, light to medium bodied, well-carbonated, and at 7.1ABV, this is one of those that'll creep up on you at happy hour.

The head on this beer is amazingly pillowy and porous, with amazing retention and lacing present. There's little visible carbonation to speak of.  Smell: Amazing floral hop aroma! Citrus fruits, pineapple, pear, and grapefruit are all present. There's also some nice malty, grainy sweetness offset by a bitter grassy character.  Taste: Creamy texture with just the right amount of hop bitterness. Decent malt profile and citrus add depth and complexity. There is just a touch of alcohol and the end to add a comforting warmth.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, smooth, with great hop bitterness. There's a pretty long finish, but the entire tasting experience is smooth and subtle.  Drinkability: Excellent example of the variety.

Half an inch of pure white soap foamy head remains for a long time, finally subsiding as a soapy resin ring that laces the glass.  Smell is all citrus hops with just an afterthought of malt sweetness. Taste is grapefruit, with lemon and orange hints peeking through. Toasted malts make a fleeting appearance before the long growing bitterness takes over, rolling over and staying with the tongue and cheeks and palate for a long, lingering, drying, antiseptic finish.  Highly, perhaps even deceptively, drinkable at 7%, and I know Bells has been getting slammed for poor QC lately, but the last few sixers I've had from them have been flawless.

287,1093,axeman9182,4.07,"12oz bottle (props to the generous BA StormKing47) of batch 9990 which was bottled on September 15th and tonight is poured into my Duvel tulip.  Two Hearted Ale pours a nice dark tangerine/orange color; not 100% translucent as it has a little bit of haze to it. A nice three finger head of creamy bone colored foam rises up. Retention is very good, but lacing is a bit spotty for an American IPA. Nose is pretty good, a citrus and pine bomb, but I'm not finding any hint of malt balance. The malt definitely shows up in the taste though, equal parts caramel and bready and very good. A wave of bitterness (just a bit much for a beer of this size) washes over my palate next. I really like that this isn't just straight up citrus on the back end, a healthy dose of pine works really well. Body is a little bit light for this beer, but I think carbonation is especially key for a beer like this as it can help elevate (or dull) the hops and Bell's really nailed it for Two Hearted. It's carbed a little bit on the high end, but not anywhere close to becoming obnoxious. The only real chink in Two Hearted's armor is a level of bitterness that I think is *just* overstepping its bounds. It really is a minor quibble in the face of a great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,weizenbob,4.1,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. The bottom of the bottle is lined with a healthy amount of unfiltered yeast that I decide not to pour into the glass for this sample. An aggressive head forms immediately, settling down to two-fingers and refusing to go away. The brew is a beautiful golden tint. We're off to a good start.  As I bring the glass closer to my nose I'm treated to a very fragrant ale. Not surprisingly, hops is the alpha scent here, but there is more than a subtle hint of sweet citrus odors behind all of that humulus. Upon further whiffs the citrus really comes out; it's almost orange-like.  The taste is amazing! Following the scent closely, the primary flavors are hops and citrus. The hops are appropriately strong without slapping you in the face. Alcohol is noticeable, but not out of place. There's a little spruce tingle in there as well, and overall, this is an unusually balanced IPA. I am noticing a slightly bitter aftertaste, but nothing unusual for the style. The more subtle characters of the brew are a welcome addition to a style that often seems to be more about how much hops can be crammed into a bottle instead of attempting to create well rounded ale.  On the mouth, this is pretty easy-going. There is not a lot of active carbonation and the ale rolls around nicely in your mouth. The lingering aftertaste could be a bit of a turnoff to those unaccustomed to an IPA. That and the 7.1% ABV bring the drinkability down a couple of notches, but it shouldn't be a deterrent to anyone looking to try an IPA at the top of its game. I wouldn't hesitate to offer this to an IPA newbie or a veteran hophead.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Yesterday's taste teste was Founder's Double Trouble,also a cloudy yellow but no head,giving it the unfortunate look of a urine sample. The frothy,durable head here is a big + for this type. I like unfiltered as it tends to add complexity.  aroma Nice. A multi hop thing and some caramel-toffee. Hops come up in the scent About what I'd hope for in this type and it's a picture pretty glass too.  Taste While the malt bill is not dominant,it's definitely involved. The balance of hops-malt may lean to the hop end but does not exclude or mask the malt side. I already knew I liked Two hearted,but it does hold up well to more detailed analysis. This is the sort of target you aim for if making an IPA/DIPA beyond the mainstream grade.  It also has a trout on the label !  Mouthfeel Carries some heft,a lot of ""hoppys"" are light/wet without much texture. Bell's got a great blend of texture,wetness,zing and substance. The aftertaste is your classic woodsy hop bitter,but nicely refined. The overall impression of Two Hearted is that it's a brew that had the right goal and was tweaked until it hit the target.  drinkability Very. Two Hearted takes the normally refreshing IPA a bit past the norm. One eventually can't drive or play with power tools but up to that point this goes down very very well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,hopsolutely,4.42,"Could simply be the Pale Ale against which all others should be judged. A hop lover's dream, for all the senses.  Taste has both clarity and complexity, with an exceptional finish. Thank-you Bell's. Brilliance in liquid form.  Unfortunately the higher alcohol content means I will probably never be able to enjoy as much of it as I would like!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,KYFriedChildren,3.35,"From a six pack that a friend and co-worker picked up from me as a gift.  Appearance- Pours a nice light orange color that is topped off with a white fluffy head on top. Not a bad looking beer, not at all.  Smell- Smells of citrus and fresh hops. Rivals many an IPA for pure citric hoppiness. Very nice.  Taste- Wow, kind of a bring down from the smell and the appearance. The hops and citrus are there in full force but there is also a biscuitty kind of buttery aftertaste. It doesn't seem all that balanced. A full on hop assault followed by what seems like a kind of half-assed butteriness.  Mouthfeel- Citric burn and hop oil along with the tingliness of the carbonation. Nothing special but not bad either.  Drinkability- I'm not as in love with the beer as a lot of people seem to be. I've also had it on tap and liked it a bit more but I don't have notes on it so these are my bottle notes instead. I probably wouldn't drink more than one or two on preference but those who like it would obviously have more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,beagle75,3.75,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  A: Clear, light amber color with one finger of persistent white foam head. Light lacing remains on the glass.  S: Abundant bright fruit--particularly guava and orange--are featured most prominently in this beer's smell. It is otherwise characterized by some fresh floral notes, faint toast, and by a potent alkaline mineral quality.  T: Begins off-dry with assertive toasted pale malt that soon turns vinous. Flavors dry out in the middle, floral aromatic hops emerge, and weak astringency heralds the approaching finish. Bitterness is restrained, and remains decidedly floral, in the relatively short and unremarkable finish. A phantom of pithy grapefruit is detected late.  M: Thin viscosity, demonstrating agility by being both wet and slightly sticky on the palate, with light carbonation.  D: A beer that is greater than the sum of its parts--an unusual sensory profile comes together remarkably well and makes for a subtle yet interesting experience. Two-Hearted does not immediately lend itself to direct comparisons with beers of the west coast IPA archetype, but does remind of Ninkasi's Total Domination IPA. The flavors featured here do not assault the palate, and would humbly vanish in the presence of most savory food flavors.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Also, some nice apricot-like fruitiness from the hops.  T- Fruitiness comes through really nicely, with citrus and apricot notes. A little floral character and pine as well, with not very much bitterness. Sufficiently malty as well, but pretty hop-forward.  M/D- Fairly thin mouthfeel with prickly carbonation.

A nice frothy and foamy white head fit beautifully in the glass' protuberance. Great head retention with even better amounts of webby lacing on the glass. The aromas were very low in many of the aspects. Not much of a hop presence: minute amounts of pine and citrus. There was some malty breadiness in the background. The three months on the shelf really become evident.  Taste was alike to the smell. Very malt-forward in sweetness and breadiness with the hops being more of a complement, rather than a component. The bitterness lingered for a few seconds before disappearing. To me, it was just a basic IPA but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt; I would definitely like to revisit with a fresher bottle.  Light bodied and carbonated, Two Hearted is very clean and crisp and incredibly easy drinking. Could definitely have a couple bottles of these, especially when fresher.

287,1093,r0nyn,4.17,"Poured from a bottle into my trusty Troegs pint glass.  Pours a hazy golden yellow hue, the color of light dried apricots. Big fluffy inch-thick head that takes its sweet time dissipating, leaving substantial amounts of sticky lacing. Smell is full of floral hop essence, along with citrus rind and just the slightest hint of malt. It actually smells quite sweet and reminds me of Troegs Nugget Nectar, which I absolutely adore.  There's a malty kick to start off, which is surprising, but quite welcome. It transitions into the floral hop bitterness, but it's a bit more subdued than I was expecting. The bitterness is definitely there and it rides long into the aftertaste, but it is well-balanced with the surprising breadiness that shows up mid-swallow. Definitely wasn't expecting that from an IPA, but it's really quite nice. Other flavors include a bit of the citrus rind from the nose and a distinct grapefruit nuance. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, with a chewiness that pairs well with the bready flavor. Carbonation is just right as well.  Drinkability is quite good, even for a non-IPA fan such as myself. The taste was quite a pleasant surprise for me, as it was very well-balanced. I used to shy away from beers like this, but Bell's Two Hearted Ale has shown me that IPAs can be more than just bitter bombs. Maybe this is my gateway IPA? Only time will tell.

287,1093,StephenRich,4.55,"The American India Pale Ale, or American-Style India Pale Ale has become one of the most popular, widespread, and brewed beers in North America. The rich pale malt backbone found in the depths of an aromatically bitter and hop-crisp beer has enchanted people all across the continent. There is only one problem with this - there are probably close to 1,800 breweries in NA, and there are probably about 2,000 different Pale Ales! The Pale Ale craze is becoming a bit overwhelming; whether it is an IPA, Pale Ale, American version or a hybrid, there are just too many pale ales out there.  So what's a beer lover to do!? Well, obviously taste them all and find your favorites. Because that may take to long, I'm going to start you off in the right direction with one of the most well rounded and best constructed American IPA's on the planet. The Bell's Two Hearted Ale. Too many pales are either one sided, to aggressively hopped, not hopped enough, or are poorly built. The Two Hearted Ale is at the top of my list because it hits all the right notes in perfect harmony. It doesn't get carried away with this or that, it is just plain good.  Don't let the fish on the label or the awkward name sway you away from this beer. The Bell's Brewery in Kalamazoo MI has been brewing some of America's best craft beer for 25 years. They are one of the staples of Craft Beer in the North East United States, and produce masterfully crafted beers all year round. Just this year they began a $52 million expansion plan on the brewery!  The Two Hearted Ale comes in a 355ml bottle at 7% abv. I opened it cool around 8C (45F) and poured it into a stemmed beer glass. The pour was gentle and smooth showing only hints of life as the beer crashed into itself. Quickly though a rumbling of white foam began to collide with the glowing amber golden beer and a lush and pillowy ivory white head was build close to 2 inches above the beer. It showed a smattering of tight and loose carbonation with sturdy bubbles and great retention. The beer was a beautiful sight, glowing a golden orange hue with copper and straw colors beaming through it. Bright shades of orange and apricot peer from every angle of the beer. Lightly opaque, but perfectly clean it was a masterful creation.  This beer has been build exclusively with Centennial hops from the Pacific Northwest, and if you take a deep breath of this beer you will understand exactly what this hop variety stands for. Big floral aromas of spice, pine and citrus perfume out of the beer cleanly and effortlessly. Smooth pale malts show creamy and soft malt character, hints of caramel sweetness and gentle warmth. The hops are the big winner here though with bright earth, grapefruit, lemon zest and fresh aromas. It is hugely aromatic and perfectly clean.  Thankfully, and without disappointment the mouthfeel and flavor reflect the nose perfectly! The first smooth and creamy rush of Two Hearted glides over your tongue and cheeks enlightening your senses with the fresh and lively flavors of centennial hops. Zesty fresh grapefruit, lemons, pine needles and earthy fields bring a quenching and massively refreshing crisp spice to your palate. It is perfect.  Pale mats are gentle but deep enough to provide the perfect backbone to this beer. Sweet candied caramel and zesty candy fruits are packed in the center of this beer allowing the fresh bitterness to play without being overwhelming. The sweet and crisp sensations of freshly squeezed grapefruits power into your palate with a tight and floral flavor that force your palate into refreshing submission. Again, pine and earth balance off the citrus and herbal flowers make a triumphant finish.  The smooth and lightly carbonated mouthfeel balances off the beer rightly, and shows soft creaminess and a touch of crackle. The end of this beer is again, a masterpiece. It is quick and agile, finishing with fresh quenches and sweet spicy notes of citrus and earth. Pale malts again sweeten out the end and round off a beer that is maybe perfectly built. That is the real power of the Two Hearted - it is one of the most balanced, best constructed, and most easily consumable Pale Ales on the planet. And it is available in 6-packs year round.

Wonderful appearance, poured aggressively into a Duvel tulip. Smell is what you'd expect from an IPA, but the taste is out of this world. There is some age on this beer, bottled on Aug. 4, 2010. For me, freshness is the utmost importance with IPAs, but this beer at two months old is still excellent. Paired with some spicy Mexican food, this IPA has the right intensity to bite through the spiciness for a nice complimenting beer. Drinkability, even with a 7 percent ABV, is excellent, too. I highly recommend you seek this one out if you haven't tried it.

Mouthfeel: Feels a little light for the style, actually. It feels good, but from the way it tastes and smells, I expected it to sit a little heavier in the mouth.

S: Wow. At first, I got a big whiff of extremely fresh floral hop aroma, followed by a potent mix of sweet melon and grapefruit. The smell is both powerful and well balanced.

The malt backbone ties the floral, bitter, sweet, and sour notes together nicely.  M: Almost oily, with a medium body and aggressive carbonation.  D: I don't have much to put this up against, but this is by far my favorite IPA.

This beer definitely gets better as it warms towards room temperature during drinking.  2. It reminds me of a beer brewed by the Main Street Brewery in Richmond, VA called Amelia Ale. That brewery is out of business (maybe because their brewpub sold pints for $1), so it's been years since I had an Amelia. Anyone out there remember it?

287,1093,StarshipPoopers,4.12,"A - Pours with about a finger of a bubbly white head. The beer is a hazy orange. Lots of sticky lacing around the glass.  S - Definite hops. A strong pine resin aroma with hints of earthy floral and grapefruit. Smells great, the smells are pronounced well.  T - There are subtle biscuity malts in the background, however the two distinct tastes are hops and citrus. The citrus is quite strong in this beer, as many other reviewers have pointed out. The citrus is so pronounced that it seems to fill in the void between the hops and malts and subdues the malts. It isn't a bad taste by any means, it is still very good, it's just not your typical composition.  M - I like the level of carbonation, sits in the mouth smoothly but doesn't feel sticky. Good mouthfeel.  D - I don't find the citrus in this to really be offputting or cause the drinkability to suffer.

287,1093,zhanson88,3.86,"Batch # on this beer was 9803, which translates to a bottling date of June 14, 2010.  Appearance: This beer looks incredibly promising when it is poured. It is a hazy golden orange color with a little more than 3 fingers of white head. Lacing looks great when it reduces; clumpy, fluffy, open and abundant that clings all over the glass.  Smell: Grapefruit, citrus, pine, and floral hops are all interwoven together nicely in this beer.  Taste: I get pale biscuity malts and some citrus up front, with both pine and floral hops on the back end for nice bitterness. However, overlaying all of this and in some cases completely overpowering it is grapefruit. Honestly it almost tastes like grapefruit juice was poured into this beer as it was being bottled. I was initially intrigued by it because it ends up making this an incredibly bitter IPA. However, I ended up deciding that I wasn't a big fan.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Smooth and creamy with great fine carbonation. A really nice overall mouthfeel. Due to the excessive grapefruit taste I couldn't rate the drinkability higher that a 4, however. I can appreciate the bitterness of the beer, but I don't feel like it's bitterness from the hops as is the case with most IPAs.

287,1093,bbkd3b,4.55,"Pre-drink confession: This is probably the eight or ninth time I've tried this. I've just always forgotten to review because I was too busy being happy. Anyways, poured into a pint glass:  A - Pours a nice, shiny gold with a 1-finger head, white and sustaining. I might need a crystal ball to see through the haze, but there's nice carbonation and sticky, sticky lacing on the way down. Good look about it.  S - Fruity and floral hops with a nice, sweet malt. All of the grounds are covered. Even a pleasant bread scent to go along with it. Really... I want to say balanced nose on this one.  T - Really complex brew, I have to say. Kind of follows the nose, with the citrus flavors showing up first. It's almost tart, but before it becomes too much, the taste melts into a pinier stage than before. They didn't bother trying to cover up the alcohol, which normally would bother me, but it somehow cancels out any sharpness from the other flavors. Gosh... this is just excellent.  M - Smooth, medium body that just flows right down the throat. Carbonation is spot-on. What I'd expect from an IPA!  D - Sometimes I have to remind myself that I can only spend so much on beer at a time. This is yet another beer that forces me to hesitate. High marks.  Overall/notes - I can't say too much here. I've had this on-tap and in the bottle, and both are extremely delicious. Much better than their Pale Ale. Certainly ranks among the best IPAs I've had so far.

Unbelievable head retention too.  Smells of citrus fruits and sticky hop juice. What's not to like? And it's bold and in your face too!  Taste is citrusy and bitter with just the right amount of malty sweetness in the background. Nice lingering hop finish that lets you know that you're sippin' on an Ipa, but not super overpowering either.  Medium mouthfeel with a nice hop bite.  I could (and have) easily drink a sixer.  Morey's Bottom Line: This used to always be my favorite beer, and I'm finding out (after not having it for quite some time) that it still is. Hop Wallop, Nugget Nectar, and Hoppe are all great beers, but I'd have to say that Two Hearted is my favorite Ipa of all time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,HalfFull,3.97,"Bottle into a pint glass. This Bell's offering pours a lightly hazed golden straw in color with a pourous half inch cap which offers a brief retention yet better than anticipated lacing.  Nice citric and pine hop nose with a balancing malt backbone expands a bit with warming to become dominated by apricot and orange. Nice aromas that require a bit too much digging however.  Flavor follows and the orange notes yield a slightly watery taste yet they linger fairly well and are accompanied by some spice notes. Yet citrus notes dominate the flavor unlike any centennial IPA I've encountered. That's not a bad thing, just different and without the depth expected, and apparently a yeast character.  Easy drinking IPA yet one that doesn't cause me to linger.  Note: A revisit with perhaps a fresher brew yields a slightly better flavor and feel and adds a a nice hop spice to it all. Review adjusted appropriately.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,rand,2.93,"This was a surprise in a nice trade I did with joel6615. Thanks Joel!  From bottle to pint glass  A: Pours an opaque yellow-orange that forms tendrils of suspended yeast and carbonation. A frothy 2-inch head forms that leaves layers of lacing. This really has a sea-foam consistency.  S: Light citrus and pine with plenty of honey malts in the back. The citrus profile suggests notes of apple, along with the standard grapefruit-y scent.  T: Light, fruity, floral tones meet you at the front of the sip, combined with bitter grapefruit. Pine is almost non-existent. There's plenty of malt support, and the beer quickly takes on a bready quality, but the malts have a sugary sweetness that doesn't compliment the bitter tones. The lack of hop bite leaves the brew with a relatively stale quality. Although not cloying, the finish is strangely sweet for an IPA.  M: Rich, hearty and viscous, espeicially for a single IPA. Carbonation is spot on and helps wash away some of the residual sweetness.  Drinkability and notes: If I had this beer by itself, I probably wouldn't complain, but there are far better IPA's out there. It wasn't hard to drink , and, by itself, is somewhat refreshing, but the hop/malt balance is off. Given the BA popularity and rave reviews I was expecting more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,brewdub17,4.32,"Appearance: A very pale bronze color that has implements of brass coloring in some areas. A very nice lacing is left, hanging over the beer.  Smell: A sweet malty smell is the base of the smell. A citrus, spicyness follows very nicely. A pleasant blend of malts and select hops.  Taste: The spicy notes from the hops that are noticed in the smell are first noticeable and the sweet malts are found after. Yet again, the balance is very pleasant and satisfying.  Mouthfeel: The spicy and citrus tones pierce the tongue well, while the malty flavor covers the back of the mouth.  Drinkability: Though you may not be able to polish a couple too many off, you'll want to. The balance of the hops and malts make the want for more unwavering.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Jeriba,4.19,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, batch number 9846 (that makes it about 2 1/2 months old, for those keeping score). Enjoyed from my Lost Coast pint glass.  A: Fairly clear yellowy orange in color, with about 1 1/2 inch head. Left a bit of lacing along the top edge of the glass.  S: Plenty of grapefruit and lemon, with a hit of pine and dry hop. Very little malt aroma.  T: Light, fruity and floral with lots of pungent grapefruit. There is a touch of sweet malt, but it is well balanced and not overpowering.  M: Thin with medium-low carbonation relative to other IPAs I have reviewed recently. It is also lacking that dry, astringent feel of a very hoppy IPA.  D: This one is a little too drinkable. If the ABV and price were a bit lower, I would call this a ""session IPA.""  Two Hearted is by no means a hop bomb IPA, but a perfect choice if you're in the mood for something mellow. I would recommend this one as a ""starter"" IPA for people who want to experiment with the style but haven't yet succumbed to hop addiction.  Having said that, I would like to try a fresher batch of this beer. I spent 5 minutes digging around for the pack with the highest batch number and still came home with one over 2 months old.

287,1093,321jeff,4.37,"12oz bottle, batch 9905  Pours a light amber with a fluffy white head that recedes to a thin layer, leaving some nice lacing behind.  Aroma is of citrus and bubblegum with an underlying malt backbone that is also present.  Tastes just like it smells, lots of citrus hops with a strong malt sweetness to even things out.  This one goes down smooth with the help of a full body (for an IPA) and just the right amount of carbonation.  Although my experience with single IPA's is somewhat limited, Two Hearted is by far my favorite of the style and I grab it whenever I come across a fresh sixer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Appearance: Lots of carbonation with a thick and long lasting (slightly off-white) head and a chilled yellow golden body.  Smell: Tangerine and peaches, all sweet with maybe a hint of grapefruit though minus the bitterness.  Taste: Good bitterness upfront though the fruit being more grapefruit than anything. Still a touch of sweetness though definitely won over by the bitter edge.  Mouthfeel: Quite low carbonation with a medium body and a pretty good balance overall.  Drinkability: Super well and i could certainly see myself getting this again.  Overall: A slightly bitter IPA that remains balanced.

I get a big whiff of piney hops. a nice fruity hops presence in there as well. smell of citrus, but also some other fruit in there that I can't quite point out. A very beautiful smelling beer.  T.  a nice hoppy presence initially..gives you that little burn on the tongue, then really smooths out at the end with the malt flavor. my first true IPA I'm reviewing and surprisingly I like it.  M.  about medium bodied. a good amount of carbonation. Anice little tingle on the tongue.  D.

287,1093,BigBlacke,4.97,"I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted this beer. I thought the label looked sketchy, but the beer inside was unbelievable.  Appearance was a nice light amber cloudiness with an excellent sticky head.  Smell is a rude awakening of floral hops. Immediately gets the taste buds going.  Taste is impeccable. Without a doubt one of if not the best IPA Ive ever had the luxury of consuming. Perfect carbonation with a nice heavy bite of floral hops.  Mouthfeel is nice and smooth as it lingers. Crisp and refreshing.  Drinkability is exceptional. If you are an IPA fan and have not tried this, you are wrong. Exceptional IPA with the perfect combination of hops, carbonation and scent.

T: a blast of hops that is certainly not unpleasing to the palate. the hops are very balanced so the beer is not overly bitter. an exceptionally smooth swallow.  MF/D: a faint hint of carbonation sizzles the tongue, but there is a dry, smooth swallow that makes this a very sessionable summer afternoon IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,NODAK,4.14,"Nose is pretty heavy on the grapefruit hops, which I've read is from the hopping of Centennial hops. That is definitely the aroma here. This is not a West Coast IPA right here, folks.  Taste has a nice grapefruit component to it, but I do get an aside of floral character there as well. I'd still say it's more on the citrus side than floral, however.  Towards the finish, a nice fruity, honey sweetness comes through just enough to give a decent bit of balance to the beer before giving way to a somewhat resinous finish.  As far as bitterness goes, it's probably on the medium to somewhat higher end for IPAs. Maltiness is somewhat low. Drinkability is quite high, but then again I like the hop qualities this IPA uses.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Lauthaha,4.2,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a beer mug.  Appearance: Pours a cloudy, golden color. Lots of tiny bubbles bubbling their way to the top of the glass. Thick, nearly two-finger head poured just about perfectly. As the head recedes, some moderate-to-heavy lacing is evident. Dimples in the head, along with those bubbles I was talking about. Very nice!  Smell: At first, all I can sense are some very fragrant floral hops. After a moment, grapefruit and/or coriander come into play. These are supplemented by a nutmeg-like undertone, and a mild ethyl afterthought.  Taste: Amazing blend of flavors! Everything I mentioned before melds into one very enjoyable conglomeration. The only point I would bring up is that the alcohol isn't very well hidden...you can definitely tell this is a 7% ABV beverage.  Mouthfeel: When you first begin your drink, the beer seems electric as it hits your tongue. A nice bite up front. As the carbonation does its magic, things mellow out just a tad allowing you to savor the taste. Rinses fairly cleanly, with just a touch of hop and grapefruit aftertaste.  Drinkability: It would be perfect, were it not for the noticeably higher alcohol content. I could drink this every night, but I couldn't drink more than two or three, even on a long night.

287,1093,milkbaby9,4.66,"12oz bottle into Samuel Adams sensory glass. Sparkling clear gold with 3 finger white foamy head that stays around a while. Recedes to a 1 finger head leaving great lacing.  Aroma is all hops: grapefruit, fresh green vines, green pine needles, a touch of grass. Taste starts sweetly malty and builds up a spicy hoppy crescendo similar to the aromas, lotsa pine and bitter grapefruit. The grapefruit bitterness hangs on the roof of my mouth as the sweet malt lasts on and on with a touch of honey lemon.  Medium carbonation seems to increase the spicyness on the tongue. Relatively light bodied. Very drinkable as the sweet malt is strong enough to hold its own against the hops and bitterness.  2015 edit: Had fresher bottles of Two Hearted and it is a much better beer fresh than a couple months old! Had to update my ratings. Totally delish!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BBP,4.15,"A- Yellowish orange; more gold and less orange than a typical IPA. Semi-translucent with medium carbonation and an average head. Considerably nice lacing.  S- Pine and grapefruit lead with a hop background. Very much floral hops. Would give it a higher rating if it were more detectable though.  T- Citrus kick right away before dropping a hint of roasted/bready malts, and then a bitter smooth hop finish. Leaves a fairly crisp finish, and the hops seem to stick around well long after your sip is done. It isn't abrasively bitter, but it maintains a somewhat elegant taste profile with the clean hops, and the crisp malt character.  M- Medium full body feel in your mouth. Very creamy and smooth. The alcohol gives a nice tingle on your tongue as well. Has a nice clean feel which I quite enjoy too.  D- A solid all around beer. Almost like a half-way to a double IPA based on the flavor, but closer to a normal IPA. It's good easy drinking, and a solid example of the style. Sadly, I don't think it lives up to the hype, but I can't deny that it's still a great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Taste was strong and deliciously hoppy with a nice malt backbone. I got the weird fruity flavor some have described as well.

T - Great balance between the malt and hops. A tad sweet, but over all a good backbone of pale malt with a slight caramel, sweetness. Has a nice bitterness that lingers a bit, but its well balanced.  M - Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Smooth and creamy feel.  D - Wish i had more. This is the last bottle from an east coast trade. Very easy to drink and tasty beer.

287,1093,jewel942,4.92,"Had the opportunity to sample several out of the firkin at Ashley's in Ann Arbor - came for the Hopslam which was out, but boy was this a great surprise.  Firstly, the ABV was quite a bit higher than the 'regular' Two Hearted... was stated as over 10%, although I don't recall exactly. Regardless, there was no strong alcohol overtone; definitely there but not objectionable in any way.  Head was nominal, typical for a firkin pour, excellent lacing and retained the foam layer pretty well. Color was a nice hazy golden hue, made better by the dim lighting at the Ashley's bar.  The aroma was Two Hearted, but better - more hops, more citrus, more everything. Best brewed aroma ever for me, save for a chocolate porter but that was something entirely different.  Same thing with the flavor, it was like Two Hearted with several highly enjoyable added layers of initial flavors and aftertastes. This was absolutely one of the top 5 brew experiences of my 30+ (won't say what the + represents) years of beer enjoyment.  Mouthfeel was better than usual for this level of IPA, seems the firkin processing smoothed things out a bit, less astringency and aftertaste.

Hazy but see through pale orange. Crazy good white head, bubbly and creamy. Retains well and leaves good lacing.  Smell has good scents of very light fruits, but hops are noticeably missing. Lemon, tart apple, citrus and floral notes. 2nd bottle didn't smell much like anything.  Lemon citrus and floral notes in the taste, some warm biscuit malt, once again not much hops. 2nd bottle tasted very strange, metallic and slightly sour, possibly infected.

Beer is a beautiful amber color with a thin foamy head on top that remains throughout much of my drinking of the beer. Foam has nice retention as the beer is swirled.  Has a fruity, citrusy smell, some slight pine notes.  Presents with a nice bitter hop taste up front, plenty of evergreen, with a sweet malt taste hitting mid-mouth before ending bitter. The hop taste ""echoes"" away as you consume this one. Some spiciness keeps the mouth tingling.  Thin to medium mouthfeel, with the hops nicely keeping the taste buds active.

Aroma: The hops hit you right away, along with citrus (mainly grapefruit), but it's not overpowering - clean and crisp.  Taste: This is an outstanding IPA - my favorite brew right now. The hops are very prevalent, but blend smoothly with the citrus to create a great overall taste that is full bodied with the right amount of bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, dry like most IPAs.  Drinkability: For a strong IPA, this is a very drinkable beer; you have to watch yourself at 7.0% ABV.

A very hop forward IPA, yet not overly aggressive. Good balance here.  T: Big, bitter grapefruit and resiny hops that linger for quite some time. Figured the malt backbone on the nose would come through a bit more here, nevertheless it remains a very solid IPA. Good citrus notes upfront, met with grapefruit and bitter hops. Slightly dry with some white grape flavors as well.  M: Bitter and drying. Astringency is my only qualm with this one. Higher carbonation level than I am used to in an IPA as well with a mouth drying quality.

A: Pours a slightly cloudy citrus-amber color with an amply large off-white head that slowly reduced into a thick oily film that left great chunks of sticky lace down the glass. Great head retention. S: Great notes of both fruity and floral hop fill my nose. There is also a touch of bready malt and perhaps salty brine peeking through hoppy notes of apricot, grapefruit, peach and pineapple. Very sweet smelling that is almost perfumey. T: Follows the nose with a big fresh hop punch. A bit more grassy than the nose with a peppery hop finish. Still very sweet and fruity though. Notes of malt are caramely sweet and pleasant. Aftertaste is full of exotic fruits. M: Tingly carbonation nips at the tongue over the medium greasy body. Aftertaste has a fresh bitter taste but isn't too dry. D: Very impressive for an IPA. Borders perhaps on a double? It's no Sculpin, but it has a place in my top 5.

No haze or sediment from the pour. Nice three finger white pillowy head. Very inviting and impressive.  Aroma: Pine, grapefruit and some lighter citrus. Not overpowering or particularly aromatic for an IPA but an impressive nose none the less.  Taste: Smooth grapefruit and mild citrus. Some pine notes in the background. Nice balance of sweet and bitter hops. Not much malt as the hops are definitely the draw here.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied and moderate carbonation. Smooth and relatively crisp.  Drinkability: Definitely an IPA I could have a couple of. The ABV is well hidden underneath the hops and each sip leaves me wanting more. Certainly not sessionable at this ABV though.  Overall, one of the best IPAs I have ever had. In fact, I rate this second to Sculpin on that list for single IPAs. Perfectly smooth and balanced.

287,1093,Mosstrooper,4.84,"Poured from 12oz bottle into 16oz Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a respectably-sized white head that dissipates somewhat slowly and leaves behind a thick ring of lace.  Smell: So much lovely hop aroma is in this brew, it's hard to describe. Tropical aromas (mainly passion fruit, but also with mango and maybe even pineapple) dominate, but there's also a note of earthy hop behind it. This also has slight sweet buttery notes. Flowery and grapefruit notes come through a bit as the beer warms. If I could give the aroma of this one a six, I would.  Taste: Begins bitter with a slight mango taste, finishing sweet and buttery but also with a note of earthy hops and a slight nut flavor. This beer is citrusy, bitter, tropical, and sweet; yet somehow all of these seemingly contrasting flavors meld so well together, with none outshining the other, and even complementing each other.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with sharp carbonation and a dry finish that is not overwhelmingly dry. If the carbonation were just a bit less, this would feel perfect.  Drinkability: A fantastic IPA and probably the best available. I have not had an IPA with so much hop character that also was not oppressive on the palate. Very drinkable (though not quite sessionable) and this is something I wish I could regularly find in NYC.

The smell is of fresh grapefruit and it is intense. There is also a nice little sweet malt in the aroma as it warms and it is very clean and crisp smelling.  The flavor is good and clean. Flowery hop bitterness with a clean malt backbone balanced out so that it keep you wanting more. There is a little vegitable hop flavor but it is very small and easily overlooked.

Lemons, grapefruit, and a little watermelon are the dominant smells. The aroma is not overwhelming but is quite pleasant and balanced.  T: I feel like this has all the characteristics of a top tier beer, just that the flavor and smell are not quite as intense as the top level beers of this class. The flavor, while not quite as intense as say a pliny or sculpin is still spot on. Two Hearted has a wonderful balance of slightly sweeter citrusy hops at the start and a bitter kick at the finish. Somewhat like abrasive.  M: Perfect level of carbonation. Nice viscosity and a great aftertaste.  D: I think I could drink this all day. It is a crisp, balanced, tasty beer.

It's beautiful to look at, the carbonation which gives it an amazing lacing and solid head then goes on to give it a wonderful carbonated mouth feel. The aroma is powerful and quit nice. Lots of citrus grape fruit. The taste is up there with the best, I could go for a bit more hops and a touch less malt but more of preference than a flaw.

287,1093,jampics2,4.62,"On tap at Melt.  As of today, I'm sure I have been drinking a Bells Two Hearted every month for at least the last ten years. Each time I have it, I'm blown away like for the first time. I finally got around to rating this - it's about time.  Looks wonderful in the glass. Orange/copper color with a large head that sticks around and leaves great lace. The only thing that would make this better is juts a slightly more bright color.  Smell is hop heaven. Centennial makes it's appearance and gives huge citrus notes. The orange and grapefruit notes are powerful and perfume for my soul. Just fantastic, a touch of sweet malt, but over-the-top hoppiness that showcases my favorite hop.  Taste is paradise. The hops and sweet kiss of malt make this just a pleasure to drink. Lots of hops citrus notes - orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and just perfect depth. Malt is sweet and clean with just a touch of caramel. Perfect in just about every way, in fact, perfect period. This has been masterfully hopped.  Two Hearted Ale has a nice mouthfeel. Great viscosity and carbonation, just shy of perfection as it just doesn't sparkle like the best of the field. It's damn close, though. The finish is mildly bitter but pleasant. Overall, I love this beer. I think I'll drink it for the next 10 years as well. Thanks, Bells!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,atsprings,4.35,"Had this one on cask tonight at Landmark Tavern during opening day of Raleigh Beer Week. Served in a standard pint glass a crisp orange with a nice lasting off white head that lasted and left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma was crisp citrus hops just in front of sweet malts. The taste was a nice balance with the complex hop profile just in front of a firm sweet caramel malt backbone. The beer is on the light side of medium and is quite smooth and refreshing. This is truly the kind of beer that casks were made for, truly outstanding, no wonder this cask kicked in less than 40 minutes.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,KickbacksSteve,4.92,"On tap at the Melting Point in Athens, Ga. Poured into a pint glass. Oily resinsy hoppiness lines the glass. Aroma is a beautiful grapefruit and orange citrussy juiciness. Taste has a nice malty sweetness in the background but the hops are the story. It's a beautiful blend of different hop bitterness. Deserving of all the praise it's ever gotten, this is one of the best ipa's...ever.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,magnj,4.07,"From my mental notes...  A - Light amber body, some carbonation, produces a large head.  S - Earthy hops are big in the nose but there is some vague sugary sweetness going on as well. Not a lot of caramel or anything, seems like a hop showcase.  T - Similar to the nose the malt profile is clean and just sweet enough to balance out the large hop additions which remind me of pine. Finishes bready and kind of thin.  M/D - Full body is light in flavor but there is sugar at the end. Easy to drink, not insanely bitter, probably a great beer locally depending on the price. I'd drink it again but only if it was easy to acquire.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,damndirtyape,4.23,"Single bottle (batch ID 9877) brewed in Comstock MI poured into a shaker pint glass.  Appearance: Slightly hazy Gold-orange color with a persistent dense 1/4"" off-white head. I poured slowly so left most of the yeast in the bottle. Lacing (strands and thick walls of it) all over the glass and plenty of bubbles moving up slowly through the beer. Nice looking beer.  Smell: Floral hops with some hints of grapefruit/citrus, mangos, and a malty finish. This beer does have to warm up for all the smells to come out. Cold and everything is muted.  Taste: Very hoppy flavors up front with malt in the middle with a bitter finish and a caramel/sweet aftertaste. Strong hop flavors, but the sweetness of the malts cuts through it and blends in nicely. I know this says American IPA...but I feel like I'm drinking a DIPA. It's a very rich brew.  Mouthfeel: Spicy carbonation on the tongue, but thick and smooth as well. It sticks to the teeth a bit, but I'm not minding.  Drinkability: At this high of an ABV, this is a one beer a night beer for me, as it's so tasty I'm drinking it quick and noticing the alcohol fairly quickly. Although I drank it rather quick, I could see this as a sit and savor beer. I had it with a grilled chicken salad but I found it clashed a bit so I polished off the meal quickly so I could savor the beer alone. It's a good beer that I'll have to have again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,SFLpunk,4.24,"Thanks to chubbyswans for hooking me up with this one!  12oz brown glass pry-top bottle. Back label dated ""9862"" which translates to Bottled 7/14/2010.  Appearance: Pours a orange gold with creamy white head that leaves lots of spotting.  Nose: Got that Midwest IPA nose (reminds me vaguely of Dreadnaught/Alpha King). Some pale caramel malt intermingles with Nugget-like hops (sharp and almost minty or eucalyptal). Some candied lemon peel too. Great nose.  Palate: Crisp but has some sweetness in the middle. Medium-light-bodied with creamy, light carbonation. Pale caramel again, and sticky hops with lots of pine and herbal notes. Finish is really well balanced between bitterness and sweetness.  Notes: First off, I'd NEVER buy this based on the package if I hadn't heard of it - it looks cheap and designed for tourists. HOWEVER - this beer fucking rocks! In fact all of my housemates agree that this is the balls. Well done and I'm super jealous of people who get to drink this all the time!

T- Taste of strong bold hops and citrus taste as well.  M- It's very dry and crisp. Bold with citrus flavors  D- Now this beer beside the label not being a typical Bell's label not sure what the fish theme is about but it's inside the bottle that matters. A nice bold IPA with flavor. With the bold strong hop present and citrusy flavor coming out this beer is worth drinking again and again.

287,1093,FreshHawk,4.72,"A - Hazy, light golden tangelo color. Fairly full, fluffy, creamy, cloud-like head. Great retention that leaves a full and creamy lace.  S - Great, juicy, strong hop flavor with plenty of grapefruit, orange, apricot and tropical fruits along with a nice touch of floral hops. Somewhat sweet and a great balance of bitterness too. Wonderful smelling beer.  T - Nice balance between the malt and hops. A good backbone of pale malt with a slight caramel, sweetness. On top of that is a good mix of citrus and some tropical fruit hops along with floral and slightly herbal hops. The fruitiness (in particular the tropical fruit) aren't quite as strong as the aroma, but are definitely present. Has a nice bitterness that lingers a bit, but it is well balanced with the slightly sweet malt taste. On the finish some more sweet orange hop flavor comes out. Well balanced with all the flavors.  M - Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Smooth and creamy feel. A little thin but not bad.  D - Very easy to drink and tasty beer. Extremely balanced beer with lots of flavor.  Notes: Batch 9892. Very good and easy to drink beer. Extremely balanced between hops and malt and between hop flavors. Very good, and enjoyable IPA, especially for one that is easy to get (in the Midwest at least). Not the best beer in the world, but a very tasty one that I would keep stocked.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,kiddynamite920,3.95,"A: A brownish-yellow-copper with two fingers worth of tight laced, just a smidge off white head.  S: Full nose of piney and resiny hops with a slight malt character underneath. A very hop forward IPA, yet not overly aggressive. Good balance here.  T: Big, bitter grapefruit and resiny hops that linger for quite some time. Figured the malt backbone on the nose would come through a bit more here, nevertheless it remains a very solid IPA. Good citrus notes upfront, met with grapefruit and bitter hops. Slightly dry with some white grape flavors as well.  M: Bitter and drying. Astringency is my only qualm with this one. Higher carbonation level than I am used to in an IPA as well with a mouth drying quality.  D: This beer is certainly crisp and refreshing and boasts many qualities that hop heads would love, but it just remains a bit on the bitter side for me.

287,1093,BarrytheBear,4.47,"I guess you just take some beers for granted. Quite surprised I've not yet waxed poetic on Two Hearted.  12 oz bottle semi-split with the wife while creating culinary masterpieces. Clear pale orange pour frolics in my Thirsty Troll Brewfest taster glass, residing underneath a thin fizzy white shield.  Aromas of orange marmalade, slight malt, and heavy freshly cut grapefruit.  Some grassyness upfront, followed by a bit of pine, and a long slow finish of grapefruit juiciness. A slender malt backbone provides enough support to keep this in some balance and the end is just mildly bitter.  Mouthfeel is light and creamy with moderate carbonation. Not as dense as might be expected from a 7% beer.  Perhaps familiarity breeds content. Two Hearted is enjoyable and I could drink this til the vacas came home. Not the top shelf of IPA's, but hovering around the top of the second tier. A Tony Romo selection...discuss.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

T - The soapy hops come through off the top, citrus and honey come on the finish, with the slightest bitterness lingering.

287,1093,Soonami,4,"Bell's Two Hearted Ale is a very good American IPA, that is just short of the great beers that are now being produced. This is a beer that's been a standard for so long that perhaps it's being usurped by newer offerings. However, it is still a very good beer that does not disappoint the hophead. I've had this beer on draft and in the bottle several times, and have always enjoyed it, but today, I will review it.  The beer pours a light amber that looks green when held up to the light. A soft head clings to the top of the beer and sticks lightly to the sides of the glass. The beer smells of fresh pine, just peeled orange rind, and flowery honey. The beer tastes very crisp with bitterness up front that marries with the taste of ripe peaches and malted barley. The beer is refreshing and with tannins providing good mouth feel and a dry finish. Very drinkable and deceiving for the the 7+% ABV, but definitely not sustainable for a session.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,bosox941827,4.24,"12 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass; poured cold and tasted as it warmed. A - Deep orange, with a nice head which dissipated fairly quickly to lacing, which clings down the glass. Looks clear (no yeast, etc.), but a bit of chill haze at beginning. S - In a word - awesome. One of the best noses ever; let's see we've got mango, apricot, orange rind, pineapple and candy. Usually am not good at getting aroma off beer, but this one is an exception. T - As advertised by the nose; lots of piney hops throughout the palate, backed by an (almost) sweet background of malt. The palate is very consistent; no real changes in taste through the palate, but the hop flavor does linger for a bit. A *bit* on the sweet side for me, but that's a minor complaint. M - Smooth, almost creamy with ""tiny"" bubbles feel and feels a bit heavy/syrupy, which goes along with the sweet flavor. D - Above average but the heaviness may wear a bit; could wreck a few of these for sure, though.  Impressed with this one, more so than with other Bell's offerings I've had.

Bright floral hops in the nose. Lemon and coriander permeate as well. Pungent budding hops with earwaxlike bitterness.

Big grassy hops explosion. Lots of floral characteristics. A nice bit of maltiness brings out some almost honey-like sweetness. Good hints of pine and citrus fruits. Grapefruit comes through nicely.

The nose is dominated by the hops (mostly citrus with some pine thrown in for variety's sake), though a current of sweet caramel jets through like the EAC. The taste is very similar, though the balance is much better. Both camps respect each other for their ferocity and professionalism. Damn, does it make for one tasty battle.

Appearance- A modest amber color common amongst beers of this style.  Smell- A very fruity bouquet of fruits ranging from melon to citrus, and passion fruit. I was thinking a hopslam lil brother!  Taste- To me it seemed diluted in the flavor category until the bitterness kicked in. A lot of you Left coasters will love this IPA.  Mouthfeel- VERY thin to me, until once again the resinous bitter residue anchors itself to the back of your tongue.  Drinkability- Drinkable in the sense that it's not heavy, but NOT in the sense that I want any more.  Overall- I am glad I tried it, but for my tastes it is a bit too ""one note"".

The hops hit your face upon opening the bottle, but fades away quickly. It still deleivers some results; tangerines, oranges, and burnt sugars. This could be a sign of a bottle with a little age on it.  There's still a ""sweet"" hoppiness found in this beer, with a mild toasted/burnt grain background. Tangerine and orange once again come to mind. It's a little oily and smooth in the feel, though the finish hits a small bump with a somewhat rough resiny aftertaste.

287,1093,STEG,4.73,"Courtesy of coreyfmcdonald, pours an amber orange hue with a wonderful fluffy head. Smell is a bit lighter than most DIPA's but grapefruit, pine resin, and brown sugar/caramel are present. Taste is exceptional, ginger grapefuit and pine are all dominant with some dark brown sugar in the back with a spice ridden aftertaste. Probably my favorite DIPA even moreso than PTE. Mouthfeel is viscous and slightly chewy. Alcohol is well hidden.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,psiweaver,4.35,"Poured this beer out of a 12oz bottle into a Reidel stemless wine glass.  It pours a nice brownish golden color which a nice off white head.  smells very hoppy, but with a decent amount of malt to it too.  This beer is very tasty. I found it to be pretty balanced though not quite on the Pliny level. I really enjoyed it though and found it to be a beer that I would enjoy a lot more often if I could get it locally. Very tasty with a nice hoppy start and a malty finish to it.  Very nice mouth feel very smooth without the overwhelming bitterness that a lot of hoppy beers have.  amazing drink ability very easy to drink and enjoy would be the perfect camping, bbqing type beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jsdunlop,3.86,"This one poured out golden and super frothy into a standard pint glass, nice thick head to start which left remnants after each sip on the side of the glass. Aromas of pure citrus, limes, orange peel, some cloves with a taste to match. Nice hoppy balance, but not overwhelming like other IPA's I have tasted in the past. Perfect balance between citrusy hops and malts, medium bodied beer with a lighter mouthfeel and extremely easy drinkability. Hard to believe this is a 7% ABV brew, nicely covered up which makes this an excellent overall beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Lemon meringue pie fits it to T. Fun beer to smell.  T: Some pine, sweet grapefruit, lemon. Light biscuity malt character. Lemon is big in the finish.  M: Soft carbonation, crisp, fairly clean finish for the style.  D: A good beer, I can see why it's well regarded. It doesn't stand out next to better CA IPAs but well above average in the style. Had to go to AZ to do it, but I'm glad I finally got to try this classic.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,sonata2008,4.62,"This beer was poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a mug. It had a hazy honey gold color, a bit cloudy. The initial 1.5 inches of foam decreased somewhat but didn't disappear entirely. The carbonation was very nice. I could see lots of tiny bubbles. The aroma was one of the great features of this beer. It had a strong hops aroma with citrus notes. With respect to taste, the bitterness of the hops hit me right away and stayed until the finish. It's nicely balanced, however, with a little bit of sweetness. It was definitely not overly hoppy for my taste. Bell's Two Hearted Ale was a pleasure to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Lacing is sticking very well. S: Hops! Lots of floral, sweet orange, some tropical fruits. T: Nice crisp bitterness yet well balanced. Taste is similar to smell, citrus(orange and grapefruit), floral. Nice lingering bitterness. Sweetness from the malt. M: Medium mouth feel not to heavy not to light. Crisp and smooth, dangerously drinkable O: World class IPA.  This is a mainstay in my fridge. I usually buy by the case outstanding easy drinking IPA. I'm a sucker for lots of citrus in my IPAs and the Centennial Hops do the trick.  Outstanding!!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S - incredibly floral but the real emphasis is candied citrus, grapefruits, pineapple, and oranges.  T - starts off a little sweet with candied oranges, turning more and more bitter...ripe cantaloupe, melon, and grapefruit. caramel malt provides a base underneath for balance - but this is a showcase of Centennial hops.  M - medium bodied with nice tight and bright carbonation which cuts through both the sweetness and bitterness. oily going down but finishes sticky.  D - one of the best single-hop IPA's out there, great balance of bitter and sweet. not much to really complain about, always a good go-to.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JoshBeer86,4.19,"I enjoyed this Two Hearted Ale at about 45 degrees. The average score for appearance was due to a somewhat light color. The color was decieving, though, since the the taste was excellent. I'm not usually a fan of Pale Ales, but this one had great balance and was somewhat easy to enjoy for a non-hop-head.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Moderate off-white foam that doesn't stick around for long. Aroma is POW in your face. Big tropical fruits, big pineapple, big in every way. The taste follows, a big hop kick. A long lasting bitterness. Resin, stick to your teeth feel.  2-hearted, hyped. Yup. Worth it, definitely.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,wedgie9,4.06,"Tasted from 12oz bottle, batch number 9637, purchased from the W Grocer. Pours a clear, bright burnt orange with a thick frothy white head that takes a long time to recede, but never truly disappears. The nose is beautiful blend of citrus/pine/resin hops and some caramel malt. On the palate this beer is extremely balanced showcasing the grapefruit hops and bread malts perfectly. The alcohol is also very well integrated. The body is medium with average carbonation and a nice long finish that is both citrus and bitter. It is easy to see why this is regarded as one of the best IPAs in America.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mralphabet,3.92,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Golden yellow with a little haze. Less than a fingers worth of head that settles to a nice ring with good lacing. Like looking little brew.  S: I'm getting a couple things here.... Some floral hops with a strong grapefruit scent.  T: Citrus hops from the get go, but not very bitter, there is some malt here but just enough to balance everything out. There is an underlying grapefruit note throughout. The aftertaste is a little on the hoppy side and a little dry.  M: Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, yet smooth. I'd have to call it light to mid bodied.  D: Very nice AIPA, everything you want and balanced nicely to boot. The ABV is right on, but at 7.10% one or 2 will do you. Worth a shoot.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DefenCorps,4.63,"On cask at Paradiso yesterday. I finally managed to track this down.  Pouring light orange with a mild haze, there's a dense, reverse-cascading head that forms a dense collar, leaving sheets of lace. Perfect. The nose is too, redolent, bright and yet suffuse with beautiful citrus and floral hops. Truly a centennial showcase, the palate replicates the flavor. Opening with a bright citrus and floral hop character, this is really smooth. A touch sweeter than it is on tap, there's a little cotton candy sweetness. Still, this dry, with mild bitterness and an explosion of hop flavor. I drank two pints and would have had a third and a fourth if it didn't kick.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,kjyost,4.22,"Purchased a pair of pints in sleeves at Psycho Suzie's in Minneapolis. Both came with a decently yellow to light orange clear body with light lacing. The aromas are dominated by US C-hops, with citrus atop a barely perceptible malt body. Enjoyable thus far. The beer is bitter with a good balancing level of hop flavours with a bit of pine and grapefruit coming through. Very drinkable, especially in the situation I was in.

S: Smells of citrusy pine and grapefruit, with a hint of bitterness and pineapple.  T: Citrus zest up front, nice and bright and a little floral sweetness, morphing smoothly into fresh pine, mildly bitter grapefruit and lemon, with a smooth and pleasantly bitter finish.  M: A little thin, oily, with a good amount of carbonation. Won't raise any eyebrows, but is certainly appropriate for the style. Refreshing with a noticeable bitterness.  D: Maybe not the most drinkable IPA thanks to its lingering bitterness, but definitely a very solid IPA that stands up there with the best. One of my favorites, and I'm definitely spoiled to have access to this beer almost anywhere, living in central Michigan - I am definitely blessed to be surrounded by so much fantastic beer!!

I like this beer but lately I have wanted a more balanced Ipa so the smell is very pine but for some reason I can't taste or smell the grapefuit as much as I used too still smells nice. the sweet melts are okay but taste is more bitter than what I remember the beer tasting like lately I have been overwhelmed by hops in beers I think my tongue is burned out a bit by hops. Anyway the flavor is still on my tongue 10 minutes between sips so it strong long lasting pine resin compelling almost gin like. the mouthfeel is perfect, creamy and slick bodied IPA.

287,1093,regspeir,4.32,"I have had this several times but this was exceptionally fresh for around here (PA) - 2 weeks after bottling according to the batch number. Why can't every brewery do something like this? It REALLY matters! Beer pours a golden amber with a large head which settles to a coating only at the last couple of sips. Lacing is thin but lasting. A whiff of this beer is a pretty perfect IPA-lover's dream - citrus (esp. grapefruit orange), pine and flowery. Not the strongest nose but pleasant. Taste is grapefruit, lemon, pine resin but pretty nicely balanced with tastes of orange and sweet malts. The finish moves toward bitter but without assault - just notes that put a nice end on a good performance. Bravo. Mouthfeel is creamy, a little slick and medium-bodied. Great beer, and one even those who would not describe themselves as hopheads would enjoy.

T: pine, citrus, sweet orange muffin, the grass/pine hops make a grand entrance in the middle, and the long finish brings lingering medicinal hops and crackers.  M: Somewhat oily, medium weight, and palate-cleansing.

A strong head on first pour, but settles down to less than half a finger.  The aroma is very fruity...some wheat notes, bubblegum, vibrant citrus, melon, earthy yeast, and pond water (the kind of good smell you get after swimming in a clear pond).  Up front in the taste is lemon, grapefruit, pine nuts, and a very bitter bite. There are also notes of wheat, pepper, pine, and some floral qualities, as well.  The flavor here is very herbal...and quite lemony, as well. It's got a serious citrus quality to it...giving it a nice bitter bite and a sweet drinkablility. The components to this beer all come together to create an outstanding ale, one that sits well on the palate, and one that is drinkable the whole night through.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,trevorjn06,4.06,"This IPA pours a light golden/straw color with one finger of head that recedes slowly, leaving some lacing on the glass.  Aroma (while still cold) is sweet honey-like malt, some floral, grass and citrus notes. As the beer warms notes of lemon emerge.  Taste is light yet sweet malt with some graininess and moderate hop bitterness (for an IPA). Starts with sweet and fruity malt flavors that transition into a mild bready taste with increasing hop bitterness and a hint of honey. The finish is juicy hop flavors, a nice balanced hop bitterness and a lingering citrus and sweet malt flavor.  Mouthfeel is light with above average carbonation, not very coating.  Overall this is a fairly light tasting IPA that is well balanced between light malt, citrus and grassy hop flavors and a smooth hop bitterness.

Pungent grapefruit and pine mix with a nice tropical fruitiness and sweet malt aromas. NICE!  T- A little sweet in the beginning, but quickly changes to a great citrus/pine bitterness. Finishes long and bitter with just enough malt to keep things in balance.  M- Medium and smooth feel with adequate carbonation.  D/O- A dame good American IPA that is perfectly balanced.

A bit of a earthy aroma, most that of hops.  T: A perfect hoppy brew, that has a bit of malt in the backbone. A bold, yet drinkable IPA. From start to finish, this IPA does justice to the style. A bold, robust hop kick is finished off by a dry malt lingering taste.  M: I find most of the Bell's brew to have this same creamy mouthfeel, even more so on tap.

Big thanks are due to Shawn for bringing a bottle along to our farewell Derek tasting (which seems premature as he's still around for another 6 weeks).  Pours a hazy orange with a finger of off-white head, which collapses to a skiff and leaves some nice sheets of lacing. the odd bit of chunky sediment leads me to believe this beauty is bottle conditioned. Great citrus nose mixing in with fresh pine resin and a firm caramel background. Its the standard combo for the style, but it smells incredibly fresh and vibrant.  Great balance in the flavour between super-fresh grapefruit/pine notes from the hops, and a big caramel backing. Likewise, sweetness and bitterness are perfectly weighted for an IPA. Its actually a stunningly simple beer, but its executed so flawlessly that there's no hesitation in giving it top marks. Its quality even extends to the mouthfeel, which is medium-weighted with a drying finish that accentuates the bitterness nicely.  Very, very well done, and a deserved bright light in the beer sky. Its got a somewhat high ABV that precludes sessioning, and even starts pitching towards an imperial version, but man oh man, do Bell's know how to do hops!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Middletaste is smooth, slightly scintillating, and full of grapefruit. Aftertaste is lightly hoppy, a little dry, and pleasantly lingering.

Hazy pastel-amber in colour with a good cover of off-white head. Decent retention and lacing. Bits of dark brown sediment at the bottom.  The nose consists of lots of citrus rind and pine with a nice candy malt backing. Smells fresh and hoppy.  Now this is an IPA. Super well-balanced and just about perfectly hopped for my taste. Lots of pine and grapefruit rind with some white pepper over perfectly balanced sweet malt. No obvious alcohol and a nice dry, grapefruit rindy finish.  Medium body and carbonation. Not bad at all.

287,1093,wedge421,4.62,A - This is a sexy IPA. Golden honey notes with a soapy white head. While not exactly clear there is some hop haze in this one. A great example of how an IPA should look.  S - Wow this one reminds me a lot of it's bigger brother Hopslam. While not nearly as intense there is a definite resemblance. Sweet floral hops fly out of the glass. There is also a very generous sweet malt back bone that you can detect as the beer warms a bit. This beer just smells so fresh and inviting.  T - If the aroma isn't enough to win you over the taste will. A huge shot of bitterness right at the front which is quickly blended together with the sweet fruit flavors of the hops. By the back of the tongue you are reminded or the sweet malts you detected in the nose&gt; A perfectly balanced beer.  D - YES please!

I get delicious, real fruit juice, fruit snacks. Not the cheap ones either, the ones made with real fruit, that are impossible to stop eating. Never gotten this scent from an IPA before. I love it! Initially, I get that amazing fruit snack taste. Not the typical citrus tastes you get from an IPA...I'm getting the citrus along with berry flavor. I'm picking up boysenberries and raspberries too. Very interesting and delicious. I can't get over this flavor. A little melon lingers in the aftertaste. The hop flavorings and bitterness are not much different than HopSlam (HopSlam is just this on Steroids with honey). This mouthfeel is nothing less than perfect. Great drinkability...I hate (ABSOLUTELY HATE!!!) that I can't get this here in California!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The nose is huge and complex with loads of citrus and pine, nicely balanced with sweet malt. The taste is huge as well, just bursting with flavor. The tons of citrus and pine are the stars here, but it's perfectly balanced with nice sweet maltiness. The mouthfeel is awesome as well with a bit of oily, resin to it with a nice fresh, crisp finish. This is a hugely drinkable and enjoyable beer.

Smell - Some citrus, hint of the IPA quality, but before reviewing what type it was supposed to be, I thought it was a normal ale, not an IPA.  Taste - Hoppy, but with a good balance. Still some citrus taste. Subtle taste of an IPA. Good beer for those who don't usually like IPA's.  Mouthfeel - slightly creamy.  Drinkability - Because of the well-balanced taste and aftertaste, I'd give this a ranking as a good beer in general, as well as being worthy of a six pack.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Lacing evaporate quickly which was a bit of a let down on what is otherwise a fantastic beer.  Smell - is to die for. Tons of piney hops smothered in mango and citrus.  Taste - extremely well balance as far as well hopped America IPAs go. Alcohol is definitely present. Bitterness and oiliness of the hops are offset beautifully by creamy head and sweet malt. Fantastic IPA!  Mouthfeel - is oily and think coats the roof of your mouth and the back of your tongue. Feels almost like a double strangely.  Drinkability - Very drinkable beer. Balance and refreshing, and not at all abusive. A little on the higher side of American IPAs as far as ABV goes but not at all a drawback.

A bright and lively hop nose: just what I want in an IPA.  Flavor is similar to aroma. Lots of hop flavor, and pretty dry as well. Although the malt profile is dry, there is a huge juiciness from the hops in Two-Hearted: lots of peach and apricot, to me at least. This is a West-coast IPA for sure, but with a different flair than some of the old standbys. Unique. Malt backbone is medium. A much lighter-bodied IPA than I was expecting, but still solid. Extremely refreshing and drinkable, even at 7 percent.  This is already a well-recognized IPA, and I'm just confirming its greatness. Delicious.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ILikeGoodCider,4.42,"Batch #9725, enjoyed on 06.23.2010 poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle into a 14oz. American pint glass.  Two Hearted has now reached the acclaim of #2 on my Favorite IPA list. I reviewed 2heart back in '09 from the tap at Shakespeare's in Kzoo - this is a new review.  A: Pours a hazy, dirty orange, bordering on rust. I poured directly into the bottom of the glass and it produced a gorgeous, bright white head. One thing I enjoy about the appearance of this beer is how I can always see bubbles rising from the bottom. The head died a bit, but left good lacing down the glass.  S: Smells like a citrus hops variety with some spice & grass in it. The hops aren't overpowering. Get your nose up in this one. PS - My favorite IPA in Pliny The Elder (Russian River)  T& M: Mostly bitter-free. But is more sweet, a faint hint of alcohol can be found in the after tastes - but for a 7%-er, it's as mild as they come. Light carbs, not too dry, it kinda leaves a film actually. This beer is very refreshing.  D: For me this is one of the most drinkable 7% beers ever.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TheSarge,3.68,"Two Hearted looks great. It produces mounds of clumpy off white head, and has strong retention. The body is orange gold in color, and is mildly hazy  The aroma is a bit perfume like, that being the vivid floral character. There is also a citrus tinge as well as pine.  Hops shine through heavily in this beer. I would say it is close to a hop bomb, but not quite; however, much more hops than I was expecting. I'd say there is a bitter grape fruit taste, but I can't really detect much of the malt's character.  This beer feels about full in body, with a bit of prickly carbonation. There is a smooth slickness and a mild warm finish.  This is a different IPA for me, and seems to stand on it's own as possibly a strong hoppy English style IPA. Not really comparable to any others that I've had.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Hoppensniffer,5,"This was my first really great ""hoppy"" beer, and I love it above all others. This beer has the best first taste of hops that I have ever tasted. Unlike other hoppy beers, this hoppy taste does not sour, or linger too much with time, it just gives you a great crisp taste, and then you are ready for another mouthful. This beer inspired me to coin my handle ""Hoppensniffer"", and I love it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DuffManOhYeah,4.1,"Bell's Two Hearted is one of my favorite IPAs. It's a beer I commonly bring to parties and a great one to pair with food.  A- A stunning gold, with some cloudiness. The rocky head is a thing of beauty with a lace that clings to the sides throughout.  S- A siren to anyone who loves hops. Very crisp and and pleasantly floral nose. My favorite aspect of the beer.  T- Goes hand-in-hand with the smell. Very floral but not overtly bitter. A very strong and citric IPA.  M- Sometimes can have a bit of a metallic aftertaste, but it really depends on the bottle. Some can be extremely good, but I've had I think 2 instances where the beer wasn't up to par,  D- A pleasant and enjoyable IPA to drink. Like I already said, the smell is what makes me keep drinking it. The bitterness also keeps bringing you back for more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,oregonskibum,4.08,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Batch 9499, bottled December 2009.  A: Color is a bright gold, very clear. Pours with a one-inch+ white, creamy head. Dissipates slowly, leaving some nice lacing on the glass.  S: First aroma is tropical hops, mainly pineapple. Also getting some piney and citrus hops. Some faint honey notes along with a touch of sweetness.  T: Taste continues where aroma left off with a nice blend of piney and citrus hops. Getting fewer tropical notes on the taste. The sweetness, faintly noticable on the smell, plays a stronger role in the taste. Malts are slightly bready and seem to overpower the hops mid-taste. But generally, everything is very well balanced. Finish is a touch on the bitter side.  M: Medium body, with moderate carbonation. My only complaint is that the beer comes across a little on the sticky side, a touch more than desired for a regular IPA.  D: Very drinkable, especially considering this is a six month old beer by the time I reviewed it. Fresh, I think this would be pushing into A+ territory.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,harperman69,4.57,"Had this from a 12 oz bottle into a pilsner style glass from Paoli Peaks lodge in Indiana. Don't hate on my limited skiing abilities.  Pours a hazy very light orange with half a finger head, my color may differ from other reviews, I suspect from dimmer lighting. Leaves very light lacing.  Smells very citric and piney with grapefruit smell being predominant.  Mouthfeel was very light, a very easy drinker.  Taste is exceptional. A very well balanced IPA utilizing the malts and hops on a near perfect level. My first Bell's product and won't be my last, if it were only distributed somewhere in west or middle TN. Until then, I must prepare more trips to Bowling Green.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ballz50401,4.25,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle (batch 9637) into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Color is a nice clear lightly tinted gold with a very nice head and lots of carbonation bubbles. Lots of floral hops in the aroma with a touch of light crystal malts. Taste is the same as smell, a very well balanced IPA. A medium bodied mouthfeel with a good hop bite. A very well done IPA that is easy to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,zhooker,4.05,"Poured from a 12oz bottle to a large snifter, over some cribbage with Dad. Pours nice and hazy, honey or light amber in color. Nice airy head with great retention and light lacing.  The nose is very piney and green -- this will be a pretty loaded IPA, I'm assuming. In fact, I am little surprised it's not an Imperial/Double. Later, a citrus-like smell emerges... oranges. After a few sips, I am also sensing a bready sweetness in the aroma.  That malt sweetness hits you up front when sipping, but from there on, the hops dominate. The sweet flavors return a bit in the finish. While the hops really establish a presence, it is not overly bitter; this is a fairly smooth ride. There is some residual chalkiness from the massive hopping, but other than that the mouthfeel is pleasant.  I've loved this beer ever since Lisa C. brought it to a party of mine in Chicago about 5 years ago. So nice to revisit this time. It seemed much smoother than I remember, but I am guessing my hop-sensitivity has been dulled since then by infinite craft brew tasting sessions. So perhaps I should I add that this is indeed a hoppy beer -- buyer beware. Anyways, I hope my next pint of this isn't too far away. Here's to you, Lisa!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Beervis,4.89,"Pours a hazy gold with a nice white foam head.  Smell is absolutely incredible, with beautiful bright citrus and floral notes, making it extremely appetizing.  Taste has a nice, almost creamy sweetness up front, with a medium body and a pleasingly bitter follow through. Finish is nice and bitter and begs for another sip.  For me, this is the perfect IPA. It has major drinkability, and showcases the hops in the smell, as well as the taste.  I can't possibly say enough about this beer, it is my ""desert island"" beer, and my favorite of the style hands down.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,carolinabeerguy,4.12,Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a light golden caramel with a 1-2 finger frothy white head. Minimal lacing.  Smell: Hoppy citrus and pine mixed with sweet hints of caramel.  Taste: Grapefruit-like hops flavor blended nicely with just a hint of malt. Nice bitter finish which gives way to a sweetness in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. Quite smooth.  Drinkability: Very good drinkability. The 7.1% ABV is masked nicely so this one could end up sneaking up on you if you drink a few.  Overall: Very solid IPA. I would definitely recommend this one.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mdaschaf,4.35,"Poured from a bottle into a DFH snifter glass  A: Pours a slightly hazy gold color. Small head with patchy lacing down the sides.  S: Lots of citrus and pine with some grapefruit and other fruits in the background. Also a little bit of grass in there as well.  T: Matches pretty well to the nose. The hop/citrus flavor hits you upfront and a really nice malt finish. The hop flavor is really nice with the grapefruit and grass coming through, but it isn't overpowering and is balanced well with the malt leaving a slightly dry, but not overly bitter finish.  M/D: Medium bodied, but very smooth and creamy at the back end. The 7.1% is nonexistent and this beer goes down nice and easy. I only wish I could get more of it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Darien,3.92,"Poured into my pint glass and quickly built up a massive white head that disappeared after a minute or so. Not crystal clear but damn close. Very hoppy in the nose, very citrusy and piney smelling with an underlying sweet malty smell. Tastes pretty delicious. Tastes very hoppy but not overpowering, citrusy, piney and sort of grassy hop taste with the malts hardly noticed in the background. Nice medium bodied and prickly mouthfeel. A nice beer that's easy to drink",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Walken,4.25,"Bell's Brewery: Two Hearted Ale (Bottled: 05/11/10) (Tasted 06/09/10) 12 oz. bottle, poured into a cervoise goblet.  Appearance: Mildly hazy sun-kissed gold with a big frothy eggshell white head that fades down into a nice looking cap, lots of sticky patches of lace. Odor: Big C-hop aroma, floral, spice and grapefruit, in that order, with a soft blanket of malt richness in the background. Consistency: Full end of medium bodied with a dry, cracker-like malty feel. Thin but creamy, thanks to the mellow, low-riding carbonation. Taste: Even multi-grain cracker malt character, complimented by a solid showing from the hops, juicy bitter orange and sweet grapefruit, slightly grassy flavor in the background. Dry finish, long and hoppy with nothing but grapefruit and pine needles on the tongue.  Good IPA, this brewery was old school before I was in elementary school. Sure, it is not nearly as intense as many more recent examples, but it is a great example of the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,wolfinthemirror,3.72,"pours a cloudy apricot color, an inch worth of froth which seems to sick around more or less.  massive citrus qualities in the smell, quite floral and fragrant.  citrusy in the taste as in the smell, more hops than malt, but some of the flavors seem a bit restrained.  medium bodied and smooth, high carbonation.

S: A light aroma of citrusy and piney hops along with some hints of caramel malts is present in the nose. T: There is an excellent balance between the malt and hops, with lots of citrusy flavors similar to the smell. M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate.

287,1093,thagr81us,4.36,Served from tap into a SweetWater standard pint. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a one-finger white head with rainbow effects when held in the light. Lacing was excellent throughout. The aroma was comprised of hops and mild malt. The flavor was a smooth hoppy note with nice mellow malt notes. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. It has been quite awhile since I have had this brew and I had forgotten how good it was. Nothing short of excellent for sure. Believe the hype on this one... I will definitely be picking up more at the store next time I'm there.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,F2brewers,4.15,"12 oz. bottle poured into my Chimay goblet. Thanks to doctor15 for this beer. Interestingly enough given the recent questions surrounding some bad batches, the area on the bottle for marking the batch is blank.  A: One and a half finger high thick white head that persists for 3-4 minutes before starting to fall and settling about 1/4 inch high. Lots of small bubbles refresh the head. The body of the beer is a light orange/slightly copper color and translucent without any hint of cloudy nature.  S: Cirtus and piney hops dominate...malt is present in the background but muted as compared to the hops. I can't pick out any specific malt flavors, but there is a sweet floral underbody that reminds me of honey.  T: Centrennial hops al lthe way...different than, say, Founders Centennial IPA, but rich in hops nonetheless. THe hops dominate but do not overwhlem. Malt is only slightly present in the background. The finish is clean with a lingering sweetness.  M: Medium to light-bodied. Poperly carbonated for the style to give a hint of creaminess in the mouth. Despite the hoppy nose and taste, there are no residual oils on my tongue.  D: No real hints of the 7% ABV in this beer. The taste is light and clean and the finish is nice. I would gladly have another (or two).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Kylito87,3.55,I have heard nothing but good about this beer but never really got up the courage or will power to drop the hefty price tag to try it until now. I saw it at Arista foods and I couldn't pass it up this time. Heres we goes.  Appearance- That typical of the style burnt orangey yellow color. Pours a prominant head that falls down into a foamy white cap which is also normal. Spotty lacing through out my Boulevard pint glass.  Smell- Hop heaven! I have never smelled a IPA quite like this. You immediately get those centenials right in your face along with this wonderful citrusy floral character which is an like sex for your sense of smell. It does also have a nice sweet malty character in behind the wall of hops!  Taste- It is quite unique you get that Nice sharp hop snap but in the finish is this nice sweet malt. This beer is a nicely crafted offering of the IPA style. It has a great Hop bite without killing your taste buds due to the fact that it has that caramelly sweetness to reset your pallete in between sips (sips not gulps!!!)  Mouthfeel- Perfect balance of carbonation and body. You get that nice slick IPA feel which is always good. This beer is probably in my top five IPA list. The carbonation is spot on for the style. I have a problem with certain IPAs that are far to carbonated which take away from the enjoyability of the brew.  Drinkability- Well I couldn't drink more than a few before needing a break from the hoppiness but I am sure I could toss back a sixer within a day. This is a great IPA that should be drank accordingly. Pour it and sip it taking in all the wonderful complexities of it and allow it to warm up as you drink it to see how it unravels this tapestry of flavor on your pallete. Bottom line are there better IPAs yeah but this one rises to the occasion. I am kicking myself for not trying it sooner.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

T: Drying grapefruit flavors with a sweet floral flavor. Sweet grains on the finish.  M: On the heavier end of a light body but not quit medium. Drying finish and very refreshing.  D: Great beer, have had one in the past that was an extra in a trade and had to get more. Have a sixer...had a sixer. And this is a great IPA.

287,1093,AJacob81,4.36,"Not sure why I waited so long to try this. Poured into a pint glass.  A - Beautiful rusty umber, clear and effervescent. A billowing white foamy head of over 4 fingers quickly forms and halts the initial pour. The head recedes very slowly, leaving a remarkable layer of lacing on the glass.  S - Fresh-cut flowers, grapefruit, and orange dreamsicle.  T - Hello, citrus cocktail. Sweet, floral notes also quick to assert themselves. Centennial hops make the finish tangy and crisp.  M - Creamy, light-medium body, with adequate carbonation.  D - This was gone in no time. The flowery, fruity start and just-hoppy-enough finish make this beaut drink like a soda pop. Very enjoyable, and this will be a go-to IPA this summer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,zoso493,4.75,"Two Hearted Ale is a beer which will always have a place in my fridge. I lucked out with this sixer, as it's only two weeks old. This particular review comes from a 12 oz. bottle poured into a Guiness tulip-shaped pint glass.  Appearance: In terms of color, Two Hearted Ale is almost the picture-perfect American IPA. It pours a vibrant copper-apricot color with tinges of amber found where the glass gets fat. It's not as hazy as a lot of other IPA's but it's by no means transparent. The beer also has a real glow to it, I think because it was brewed, in part, by Jesus Christ. Atop the beer is a foamy two-finger head that subsides fairly rapidly to form a thin cover over the top of the liquid. There's not a whole lot in the way of lacing, but a few streaks find their way to the sides of my glass. I don't know if this should be considered when awarding scores for appearance, but I don't know if there's another beer that looks as appetizing to me than Bell's Two Hearted Ale.  Smell: The scent of Two Hearted Ale is perfection achieved for an IPA. What a glorious floral, citric and juicy aroma this beer produces. This is a beer that makes absolutely zero qualms about being hop-centric and I am cherishing every whiff I get out of the glass. Though this is obviously a hopped up brew, the caramel malts also manage to sneak through and add a wonderful sugar-coated sensation to the already delectable hops.  Taste: Ah, so this is what Centennial hops taste like. They're in no short supply in Two Hearted Ale and they taste delicious. The hops floral and citric hops are again the most dominant characters in the taste, with a good deal of grapefruit and pine coming through as well. The malts are present but certainly to a lesser extent (as they damn well should be). Two Hearted is without a shadow of a doubt a great beer, but it's just a tad too subduedbecause it is just a tad subdued for my taste. Still, this is an outstanding hoppy beverage and one that I will imbibe in earnest.  Mouthfeel: This is a nicely carbonated beer and as such is very refreshing and somewhat crisp. The body, however, is lacking just a bit, in my opinion. It's just a little thinner than I would expect a great IPA to be, but it's by no means a turn-off to the beer. It is still extremely smooth and strikes just the right balance between being sticky and dry.  Drinkability: Well, I've finished the bottle before I could comment on the drinkability and I think that will suffice as an explanation as to why this is a fantastically drinkable beer. It's exceptionally smooth and just has an inexplicable refreshing quality to it. The alcohol, though not being excessive at 7% is totally masked and plays no part in the taste. I could drink this beer all day and then some.  All said, Bell's Two Hearted Ale is a masterpiece of a beer. I've never been disappointed in the slightest margin by Larry Bell, and this beer is no exception. I can comfortably call this a world class IPA and a brew that I am eternally grateful is easily accessible to me. Two Hearted is my go-to beer if I'm need of a flavorful yet still drinkable beer and will continue to buy this beer until it is no longer made.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Taste has some citrus hop bitterness with lots of malt, with some floral hops on the after taste. I wondered if the bottle I got may have been old and missing some of the hop flavours that I expected, but I checked on Bell's website and it says it was bottled on May 4th.

287,1093,hayesez,4.48,"I was about to comment on how underrated Bell's Two Hearted is. But then I hopped in here to post my review and see that it actually scores quite well. While not talked about that often, it is certainly an outstanding year-round India Pale Ale. Two-hearted is readily available here in Terre Haute, and I commonly order it when no other beers pique my interest. Certainly a top notch IPA.  Reviewing this one from the tap as that is generally how I drink them. Consumed in a standard pint glass at TGIFriday's late late last night. A darker clear golden-amber color with an impressive amount of soft loosely packed nearly white head. Had several pints of the two-hearted and noted distinct rings of lace left after every drink. Even though the head had receded to about one finger before I took my first swig, there was plenty to stick to the side of the glass.  A very nice combination of sweet grapefruit and other citrusy scents. A touch of flower and pine add to a very well-balanced nose.  Bell's Two Hearted starts out with a crisp bitter taste that is extremely creamy, rich, and full-bodied. It transitions to an excellent citrusy fruit (apricots, grapefruits, etc.) before coming full circle to a hopped, slightly bitter finish. However, there is very little lingering bitterness that I think often detracts from some IPAs.  This one has to be near the top for drinkability. I order it over just about anything that isn't new or different. Along with Hopslam and the Expedition Stout, Bell's shows that they can brew some outstanding beer. I still think that their beer in general is undervalued - I guess that leaves more for the rest of us.

Citrusy hops throughout but not so much so that it's overpowering other than the constant citrus, a normal american IPA  M- Nice full bodied ale with a crisp dry aftertaste but it's not too dry  D- The not too dryness of the aftertaste makes you want more and it's probably the best american IPA I've had",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,khiasmus,4.92,"At first I thought it was overrated. Then my buddy invited me over for a bachelor party... what could be more sensible than a five liter? Now here I sit with likely my 50th glass and I couldn't be happier with this, my all time favorite American IPA.  We were jovial, you know, of course we were. The sunset a clear orange as we stoked up a flame on the yet-to-be-finished back porch, and dreaded, all but one of us, the weekend as we were going to lose our friend to that ever-deepening pit of commitment. We toasted to the times gone by, and we toasted to the times ahead, as few and far between as we knew they would likely become. Dropping like flies, we were, all of us. I had gotten down on one knee but days before and pledged my own life away, and from that point we all know that things change. There's a priority shift, where you go from being your own center of the universe to having to care about someone else first. So here we were with glasses in our hands, celebrating the passage of yet another into this murky and unknown territory... territory from which we expected him seldom to emerge. So we sat and enjoyed this nectar. Little else to say other than nearly perfect, we all esteemed it to be. Glass after delicious glass, this one particularly, over all the others, seems to be as perfect as we could muster. The perfect golden clarity, lacing mousse atop, an aroma both delicate and assertive at once, the flavour the same... perfect. Just the right amount of bitterness, just the right amount of complexity, just the right amount of balance, slightly dry in the finish, just enough body to give the mouth something to hold on to, but light enough to throw back pint after pint... light enough that we got rather sloppy rather quickly, as we sat around the fire and enjoyed one last bout of freedom... Here's to what we're losing, boys, and here's to what each of us will gain. There's something to be said for someone to live life with, to always be there regardless of where there is. Yes, of course, we'll lose the togetherness that we have. But we'll change, we'll mature, and we'll always be friends. Here's to the best times, with the best friends, and the best IPA in the world.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,RDAdams,4.25,"One of the benefits of trekking north into the land of William Penn is that beer stores only sell beer by the case. We stopped at the Beer Mill in West Chester where a case of four six packs cost less than $2 a bottle.  AROMA: Using its intense floral hops supported by a firm, complex malt background, it yells at your senses ""I am American IPA"".  APPEARANCE: It pours an almost solid gold color and is clear as a Bell (pun intended). The head was softly off-white and 1.5"" thick. The head dissolved slowly, and lingered throughout the drink.  FLAVOR: It has the intense citrus floral hop complexity (orange, lemon, and definitely grapefruit) on a malt platform of barley, biscuit, and possibility wheat. What it lacks is the malt backbone found in a Dogfish 60 Minute IPA and in most English IPA's. Thus, as good as thus beer is and as good as the hops are, more malt would make this a better beer.  MOUTHFEEL: This is a full bodied beer made to have a medium bodied mouthfeel by the carbonation. It is creamy on the palate with a crisp, dry finish. The aftertaste is hops with a burning sensation on my tongue. The balance would br significantly improved with a malt backbone  DRINKABILITY: This is definitely not a session beer. Since it is not pasteurized, its shelf life is questionable. But I plan to keep a six pack in my refrigerator for at least a year to see if bottle aging decreases the hops flavor compared with the malt flavor.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,olegv40,3.98,"Pours a rich murky golden color with huge bubbles clinging to the glass. A thick soapy head formed and quickly evaporated.  Bitter orange is the predominant flavor. Very hoppy and bitter and exceptionally dry. The taste of alcohol comes in during the middle and it finishes dry and astringent in the mouth.

287,1093,velmalikevelvet,4.31,"Poured a 12-oz bottle into chilled mug.  Cloudy butterscotch color with a smallish head that dissipated almost immediately; good lacing.  The aroma - mango, pineapple, & exotic flowers - is delightful. Smells like Hawaii in a bottle!  Good carbonation, slightly tangy, very crisp. Not as grapefruity as I usually like, but I didn't mind the lack at all; a very pleasant surprise. Nice, light tart aftertaste.  If it was available in California (it's not), I'd definitely drink this beer again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mgbickel,4.52,"On tap at the Eccentric Cafe, reviewed from notes.  Poured into a pint glass (I think...forgot to write down the vessel...jeeze). A thick white head sits on top of a hazy, orang-ish body. The head stuck around almost through the entire drink, leaving bits of lace behind.  The nose has refreshing hops, citrus in nature, grapefruit, orange zest, and roasted malts in the background.  Flavors stick tightly to the nose...add in a little earthy, floral hop pinch toward the finish. Extremely well balanced.  Medium to light mouth feel, well carbonated and slightly oily.  Super drinkable brew...right up there with the best of them.

287,1093,fuzzycasserole,4.45,"Long time BA lurker, first time reviewer; figured I'd start with something I know well and love; Bell's Two Hearted Ale. One of the first beers to get me hooked on craft, I can't say I'm not prejudging the drink I'm about to have. That said, I'll try to make this a genuine review and not a rehash of my previous experiences.  A: Pours golden yellow, slightly cloudy. 1/2 finger head which mostly dissipates quickly.  S: Citrus and pine, a Hopslam-lite aroma with less grapefruit emphasis. Inherently appealing to my nose, but with a hint of bitterness in the background.  T: The main event; the aroma is translated mostly directly to the taste, with most of the same elements dominating my palate. Two Hearted leans towards the citrus-y end of the hop spectrum and this bottle is no exception. As in the nose, a healthy but very balanced bitterness brings up the rear, more pronounced here than in the smell.  M: There is a slight thickness to this beer, but it is countered by the moderate carbonation; I've had some Two Hearted which I thought was under-carbonated, but this one is spot on.  D: I could, and have, drank more than my share of these.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,livewire78,4.24,Nice golden yellow color. Head was average maybe a bit nicer.  Smelled of floral citrusy hops with a touch of I think malt somewhere in there.  Tasted really nice. Floral and citrusy. Alcohol was almost invisible. Very nice crispness and the carbonation level was almost perfect. This went down smoooth!  Super nice IPA. Could drink this forever. A lttle embarassed to have not had it sooner. I think if the fish wasn't on the label I wouldn't have had so much bias against it going in. Embarassing for me? Yes. Good beer? Absolutely.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,d0ggnate,4.27,"I've always wanted, but never tried hard, to try this beer and stumble upon the opportunity a night ago. This is a beer that I would love to have readily available to me, but don't.  My pour appeared a cloudy, dulled yellow color with a single finger head. Great citrus nose! I picked up strong citrus hops with pineapple and fresh cut/squeezed oranges. The taste continues with the orange notes, but less hops that I get on the nose. A very full mouthfeel and the body is spot on. I really enjoyed this beer and could do damage to a 6 pack on a hot summer day.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,RodneyX,4.55,"This looks like a golden hazy beer with a nice billowy head on it that leaves some great lace on the sides of the glass at the beginning and throughout the drink in the entirety. It smells like hops and malts, very sweet, but a definite hoppy odor. It tastes hoppy but very sweet as well, just a touch bitter. I think this would be the perfect thirst quencher after doing something like mowing the lawn on a hot day. Can drink this all day.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,honestdave,4,Poured a 12oz ale into one of my favorite pint ale glasses.  A: Pours a hazy golden color with a very thick creamy white head. Head holds up well for several minutes.  S: Nice floral scent with citrus notes as well. Good overall nose.  T: Good balance between the citrus hop bite and a malty backbone. Did I say balanced? Refreshing too. Good summer beer. I like the slightly dry aftertaste.  M: Slightly syrupy but enough carbonation to keep it keep it an easy drinker.  D: Good drinkable beer with an alcohol content that isn't overpowering. This is one that you can enjoy several without overdoing it. I like that it isn't too sweet and has a dry finish too.  Summary: Good solid IPA. One that I will buy again. Would also satisfy those that don't like really bitter ales. Easy to like!,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,cbutova,4.55,"A- Pours out a hazy orange-brown with a two finger head. The head is white and very foamy and sits with good retention. The whipped cream foam dies down slowly and allows me to sip. It simultaneously leaves a thick coat of lacing behind on the walls of the glass. Bell's makes some good looking beer.  S- From what I have found, Bell's has a lot of caramel malt in the aroma of their beer, not in a bad way of course. Some good hop scents come through with the malt and I get notes of fruit (light), grass, earthy and more fruit. The fruit is like a mix of orange, mango, apricot and pineapple, nice. The smell seems to grow on me as I drink more, rather than fade away.  T- Follows suit of the smell. The malt has a nice backbone to the hops. It is lighter malt with some caramel added in. The hops are once again fruity, grassy and earthy with some citrus peel notes in there as well. This beer has a great malt and hop profile and it deserves attention. The hops remind me of some of the best IPAs I have had but are a bit more subtle and allow the malt to come through, this is really cool. It allows the beer to be more refreshing in a way. The bitterness level is pretty low and caps off a great tasting ale.  MF- Mouthfeel is good. The body is on the light end but is creamy rather than watery. The carbonation is at a medium level and just stings the tongue enough like it should. A coat of hops and light malt sticks around on the tongue for quite some time, as well as the bitters. The 7.10% ABV does not make any appearance in this one.  DB- Could be one of the better session beers I have tried. The price was great, the flavor was great and the ABV doesn't rear its head. The semi-subtle flavors allow the beer to take on a more refreshing feel. I gotta get a case of this stuff some time, great session beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Augustiner719,4.48,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a duvel tulip  Appearance: Pours a beautiful orange hazzy sunset color with a big beautiful pillow honey comb colored head. Great lacing down the glass. This is perfection.  Smell: Smells bitter and hoppy. Grapefruit rind, lemon bitterness. Smells almost like honey nut cheerios but with an extreme grapefruity lemony bitterness.  Taste: Tastes very hop forward yet has a nice subtle malt backbone that saves the palate. Solid acidity with a sticky sweet hoppy bite, almost like sap covered pinecones on the finish. This makes a lot of DIPA's put to shame in its hoppiness and malty backbone.  Mouthfeel: Great carbonation, solid dryness on the back end. Overall an easy drinking, flavorful IPA that over delivers. This is boderline DIPA.  Drinkability: Regardless of ABv, this is one of a kind. This truly stands out in its class for IPAs. Distribution is limited on this one but if you can get your hands on it, get it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Mr3dPHD,4.17,"Served in a tulip pint glass from the bottle.  A - Nice deep copper color with a pretty thick and slightly tan head. The head dissolved slowly to a thick creamy layer leaving a little lacing behind.  S - I'm getting all sorts off stuff from the smell. At first sniff I can smell caramel and apple, and the definite scent of floral hops. After really concentrating I can actually smell the tangy scent of red wine and vinegar. The smell definitely makes my mouth water.  F - Very different from your average IPA. There's a nice hoppy kick the second it hits your tongue, but the flavor sort of drops out leaving a nice dry aftertaste where the alcohol lingers a bit. It's not as sweet as it smells by any means, but that's pretty common with IPAs in my experience. Even so, I can still get that faint hint of caramel in the middle. Very tasty.  M/D - Nice medium carbonation with a sort of oily texture. Very, very drinkable for an IPA. I could definitely pound a few of these with dinner.  All in all, this was a great beer. I remember trying this brew years ago when I first started introducing myself to beers that didn't have the word ""Light"" in the front and I remember hating it.

287,1093,SmasNadroj,3.98,"At first sip, this seems like a great session beer. The heads a little lacking but it leaves ok bubbly curtain lacing. Pours a nice glowing copper-gold color, very inviting. I like the obscure fish label with the almost hunter orange on it, quite rustic. It just looks like it belongs on a camping or hunting trip  Smells a little weaker than it tastes, honestly. Some citrus from the hops and a bit of orange zest is mostly what I get from the nose. Faint smell of alcohol too  Crisp, clean, refreshing and understated. An exemplary american ipa with a little bit of caramel sweetness to it, good silky slick mouthfeel too.  Overall, its a damn good beer- I can't pick out many things I dislike per se, but somehow it leaves me wanting more (besides a 2nd glass) pick one up for yourself and decide, its definitely worth a go",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BigDoug,4.8,"Two 12 oz bottles poured into my 22 oz glass mug.  This is my favorite session IPA. I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet.  Pours a very nice deep copper gold color. Very dense creamy slight off white head. The head stays there forever. Falls to a thick creamy cap on top of the beer. Leaves above average lacing.  The smell is fantastic. Almost smells like a Hopslam but a little more citrusy. Light malt in the backround. Faint aroma of alcohol. Very floral hops. Centennial if I'm not mistaken.  The taste is where it's at! Very very lovely hop flavor with a pinch of pale malt. Perfect bitterness. It's bitter but the flavor really makes the bitterness seem very faint. It's a hopheads session beer for sure. I could drink a sixer of this without any problem.  Mouthfeel is just about perfect. Very creamy. A little thin but not watery by any means. Medium carbonation. A swirl around the glass makes it even more creamy and build the head right back up. Just fantastic feel to this beer.  The drinkability is right where the taste is, which is perfect. I could drink this everyday for the rest of my life and would not complain. The only thing that stops me from drinking a case of this beer in a couple days is the 7% ABV which will make it's appearance after drinking 2 or 3 of them. A sixer is plenty and boy is it just a great beer! Bell's nailed this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Quick transition to bitter grapefruit hops at the finish.  Light to medium body and well carbonated.  Easy to drink, but a bit heavy on the malt side and lacks the bitter hop punch I was expecting.

287,1093,BeanBone,4.55,"Appearance: A hazy golden-orange body capped by about two fingers of densely-packed off-white head that fades slowly and leaves brilliant lacing.  Aroma: Lots of juicy, citrusy, and slightly leafy hops over a caramel malt body. It sounds strange, but I get shades or fresh orange juice from time to time.  Flavor: Up front, the mildly bitter hops lead the charge and are again juicy, citrusy, and a little leafy. Underneath, there's a solid biscuity malt body keeping everything grounded. It's balanced rather nicely, though the focus is (rightly) on the hops. That moderately-high alcohol content is totally masked. Biscuity malt and juicy in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with medium carbonation and a drying finish.  Drinkability: This goes back without any issue whatsoever, and would probably make a great session choice if it wasn't for the slightly beefy alcohol content.  Verdict: It's clear why Two Hearted has built such a great reputation; this is just a straightforward, well-crafted, and satisfying American IPA.

The batch info area on the rear label is empty, so no freshness info, but I'll know soon enough once we open the bottle.  I've been enjoying this beer for years, time to review it and make it official.  Eyes: Pours a hazy darkish amber with a nice finger and a half of fluffy white head. Lacing is pretty and heavy.  Nose: A very potent and delicious hop profile. Many DIPAs have a less impressive nose. A nice citrus/grapefruit profile dominates. Few IPAs supply such an inviting nose.  Tongue: The nose doesn't deceive. A strong fresh sweet citrus assault on the tongue. Much less grassy and piney than the tasty citrus grapefruit flavors, but everything comes together nicely. The balance is spot on.  Mouth: Good carbonation, generally smooth aftertaste, even with that hop punch. This goes down extremely easy. The 7% ABV is undetectable.  Libation: What a great beer! Solid throughout, and truly delicious. I feel fortunate that this beer is so freely available in this market.

Taste: More mild hops flavors than in the nose and well balanced with a malt body. Sweet grapefruit and pine hops in the beginning, with a good malt middle, finally ending with lingering pine.

287,1093,DerekP,3.3,"This beer tends to receive a lot of general compliments online, so I decided to finally give it a try.  Poured a 12 oz bottle into a nonic pint glass.  It shows a pretty amber glow, with a solid white top.  Smells of sweet citrus fruits on ice (frozen pineapple & grapefruit), floral hops, a hint of bready character, possibly a pound cake in the far distance.  Taste is very astringent, with the hops pushing the max on bitterness. The taste is extraneous and surprisingly unrelated to the expectations derived from the welcoming smell. Warming notes from the alcohol, and a teasing amount of the citrus flavors from the smell that I expected to find more pronounced in the taste.  The mouthfeel offers a silky tingle, and the finish concludes with a lingering grainy aftertaste.  Not at all what I was expecting. I was hoping the citrus and/or floral character from hops traditionally tossed in an American IPA would show in this brew. The bittering character was, in my opinion, too dry and lacked a friendlier complement. But, if you are into American IPA's that pack a bitter punch and leave the flower giving for anniversary celebrations, this one just might be what you are looking for.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Liverpool08,3.75,"This is a good IPA. I guess the best way to descibe this one is balance. The hops don't overpower and blend smoothly with the malts. It has a nice simple citrus/hoppy aroma, but nothing earth shattering. This is definately the IPA to session with if you are careful of the ABV. The balance makes this one very easy to drink and doesn't kill your tastebuds after a couple.

Nice, offwhite head which lasted through about half the glass.  Aroma- Can you say hops? Intense, floral, citrus, somewhat piney. Maybe centennial hops?  Taste- Intense hop bitterness in the front, balanced nicely as the beer moves over your tongue by nice malty sweetness. Hoppy? Yes... but balanced. No alcohol burn, which I expected a little bit of... I mean it is 7.1%  Mouthfeel- Almost creamy. Contrasted well with the hop bitterness. Smooth... nice  Drinkability- Well, I only knock it because I wouldn't enjoy drinking like a 6 pack of these in one session. The hops might overwork the tongue over such an extended session.  Conclusion- A very nice American Pale Ale. Another stellar offering from Bell's. A little pricy, but you pay for quality... which is what I've always gotten from Bells.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Just copy and paste the address below into your browser.  http://mikesbrewreview.com/review-of-bells-two-hearted-ale/  Packaging  The dead looking fish on the front can somewhat turn me off from wanting to pick this beer up off the shelf. However, the colors are nice and classic with a nice looking design. The text is informative and attempts to be inspiring, but feels a bit to classic for me. Finding the ABV and that its an American IPA before picking it up helps me to decide that I'd like to try this beer.  Appearance  A deep golden hue with lots of carbonation comes off this beer instantly. The head is fluffy like a cloud and laces the glass for pretty much the length of the drinking session.  Smell  It starts hoppy, but slowly becomes a sweeter as time passes. Upon smelling it a few times I can really start to smell a yeasty fruitiness in my nose.  Taste  The first drink attacks my tongue with an intense army of little acids that are digging out my taste buds and kicking them around my mouth. After that initial drink, things calm down and balance out a little more. However, I am surprised by the amount of sweetness that carries throughout this beer. I can't pin point if its all malt of divided in half with the hops.  Mouthfeel  A medium bodied mouth feel. It definitely has some body and carbonation. It doesn't stick to the inside of my mouth, teeth or ribs at all. Very smooth.  Drinkability  Some people think I shouldn't ""down"" my beers and just enjoy them. I agree somewhat, but I feel being able to finish off a beer quickly is a good test of drinkability. That being said, I think this beer definitely can be finished off quickly if you need to leave or something, but I don't think its a beer I would drink all night long. It just has a bit to much apparent sweetness for my preference.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A - It has a very nice color. I'm colorblind, so don't expect me to describe, but it looked good to me.  S - The smell was slightly sweet, but not very strong.  T - At first, it tasted kind of weak. This is generally my impression of IPAs. After a few sips, though, the pungency of the hops really started to come through. By the time I finished the glass, I was enjoying it, but I didn't feel like there was a lot of complexity to the flavor, it just seemed to have one strong note.  M - No complaints here.  D - This was very drinkable, although it didn't leave me anxiously craving for more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The smell of this bear makes me eager to drink it. It's a combination of peach, apricot, and orange. The taste is a pretty well balanced. There is just enough malt sweetness to carry the hops that are pronounced but not too too bitter. This is a nice light (in color and mouthfeel) beer that will be great going into Spring.

Pours like hazy amber and honey (and at a temperature that was only slightly below ambient!). Smallish but retentive head, good lacing, blah blah you know what a cask IPA looks like.  Smells capital-S Smooth. Two Hearted is normally well balanced but this is just boffo: giant west coats hops were almost, like, fluffed up by a malt so smooth it was like bready whipped cream.  Tastes even better than it smells, since smoothness is one of those things that ain't conveyed too well through the olfactory sense. Hops are like flowers and grapefruit juice, the malt is like poundcake, together they combine into a well-balanced slurry of perfection.  I've said in the past that casks don't really impress me unless they're of thick stouts, but I think I'm going to have to amend that for exceptionally balanced IPAs.

T- Nice grapefruit with a slight malty finish, only to be followed up by a firm crisp bitterness.  M- Medium mouthfeel with appropriate amounts of carbonation.  D- Excellent drinkability. One that you could have a few of and not have your tastebuds numb from the amount of hops.  Overall- Very well-done IPA. Something that has great drinkability and is a nice IPA. Lacks the dank, earthy flavors that some enjoy; however, this one is a great example of the style and for an IPA is perfectly balanced with the malt coming through in the finish and working well with the overall bitterness.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S - Smell is of sweet malts and some light tropical fruits...maybe some papaya. Nice, but not overbearing.  T - Nice mix of malts and hops. The hop flavor is very piney. The malts of a nice sweetness on the mid-palate while the pine taste lingers for a bit at the end. Good, not great. Alcohol flavor is hidden pretty dang well.

287,1093,tnlandsailor,4.97,"I was given this beer initially in a blind taste test of several commercial IPA's. This was head and shoulders above the rest. The beer pours fairly cloudy, but this hardly ever bothers me unless I'm pouring a pils or a Köslch or something similar.  The aroma was heaven. Expertly done, Centennial hops wafted up and had wonderful hints of citrus and only a slightly resiny American hop character. The aroma was not brash or crude, but artful and almost perfumey. Amongst the wonderful citrus were hints of malt that balanced very well.  The taste was very clean bitterness up front with a burst of that same citrusey hop character in the nose. Definitely balanced toward hops (and what self respecting American IPA isn't?), there was still enough subtle malt flavor to balance. Infinitely drinkable, I polished off my glass and looked up like Oliver Twist and whimpered, ""please sir, can I have some more?"". The hop flavor was amazing, not a ""bash-you-over-the-head"" type flavor, but a more like a 1960's Raquell Welch whispering in your ear ""come here big boy and I'll show what hop character is all about..."". Yes, it was that good.  I cannot say enough good things about this beer. It's spectacular out of the bottle and even better on tap. If you happen to buy it in the bottle, don't sit on it, drink it promptly, it won't age well - really hoppy beers rarely do.

287,1093,hopsbreath,4.65,"Bottle poured into a pint glass batch #9555. According to their website Bells has this listed as being bottled on January 25, 2010. That's just a day shy of two months but I didn't look it up until after I drank it so it did not influence how I felt. The appearance is great! Good golden clarity with a nice 3 finger cap of fluffy off white head. Lacing was apparent the whole way down the glass.  I love this smell. Lots of tropical fruity aromas are apparent. I prefer the tropical smells/flavors in IPA's/DIPA's compared to overall dankness, so this is an area where my personal opinion takes over.  Taste echoes the aroma. Sweet tropical flavors with good bitterness dominate the palate.  Mouthfeel borders perfection. The only reason I'm not giving it a five is...ah hell! It is perfect! Five it is.  This drinks WAY too easy. I try to savor beers but this one went down in less than ten minutes while I grilled my steak. Unfortunately I had only bought a single to try out or I would have popped another right away. I have to go with a five here because I honestly can't think of how this could be any easier to drink.  I tried Hopslam when it first came to my beer store this year without ever trying Two Hearted. I kept passing over Two Hearted with the idea that since I had tried the Hopslam I would only be disappointed with its little brother. Boy was I wrong. I put this up there with Torpedo from SN and Sweetwater's IPA as some of my favorite IPA's readily available in my area. I've had both of them less than ten days old and can't wait to try a fresher batch of Two Hearted. I'm going to have to do a taste test with all three at the same time to see which of them my overall favorite is but I think that Two Hearted may be an early favorite.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,jjshowal,4.64,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this beer over the past few years (since I have turned 21) and am proud to say that Two Hearted is my go-to beer.  I live in Bloomington, IN and am lucky enough to have this beer available at many local bars on tap. Now lets get down to it.  APPEARANCE- Beautiful golden/amber pour with an excellent 1""-1.5"" head of foam. The color and carbonation stays consistent throughout the experience followed by excellent lacing left behind on the pint glass.  SMELL- While the smell maybe intimidating for amateur IPA drinkers, it is filled with a wonderfully citrus aroma with hints of honey and apple. This is one of my favorite aspects of this beer.  TASTE- Bell's makes their IPAs in a way that you won't forget. The two hearted tastes a little mild compared to the very full aroma. However, it is exceptionally smooth and continues to be the most drinkable IPA I have tasted. On tap it is truly a treat and has a bit sweeter taste to it compared to the bottle. I strongly recommend getting it on tap if available. Plus the label on the bottle is not the most appealing.  MOUTHFEEL- Wonderfully light bitterness with a sweet and citrusy sensation on the tongue. It finishes with a slight hoppy bite, but remains very enjoyable.  DRINKABILITY AND OVERALL THOUGHTS- I remain somewhat biased towards this beer, but because a combination of its somewhat mild flavor and wonderful aroma with a medium ABV,I consider this THE perfect session IPA. If you enjoy Bell's style and IPAs I would also recommend their seasonal Hopslam IPA which I would consider a more extreme Two Hearted.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,boatshoes,3.92,"Previously had this for a review on tap, but I thought I'd give it another go out of the bottle.  Appearance- Pours a very nice bright golden out of the bottle with about two fingers of white head sitting on top. Head dies back fairly quickly, but leaves a substantial coating across the top of the beer that remains throughout. Not a whole lot of lacing left however.  Smell- Nose is even better than I remember. Very fruity hops with lots of pineapple and grapefruit. Smells very juicy and not nearly as resiny as I remembered.  Taste- Palate is very solid as well though slightly misleading from the nose I thought. Still a solid punch of fruity hops to start with, again I get mostly pineapple and grapefruit rind with just a touch of piney resin here however. Flavors are a lot more mellow than the nose indicated though with a lot of sweeter/bready malts showing through towards the finish.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel is spot on and nice and creamy for the style. Drinkability is also great and the beer went down very easily.  Overall, very similar to my on tap review. A very good IPA and the only differences it seems were that I found the nose to be much better out of the bottle though the flavor slightly less interesting.

Moderate pour pour generates a big one inch fluffy eggshell colored head, which lingers around for a good bit, leaving some nice sticking on the way down. Nice medium orange with good clarity. Pure classic IPA.  Aroma is gigantic, perfumy floral hops and juicy grapefruit. Aroma is so intense and inviting. Some faint caramel maltiness, but it is way overpowered. Prickly hop leaf in there. A little touch of alcohol too.  Taste is juicy grapefruit, not intensely bitter, but very much hop forward. A bit resiny, and hop oily as well. The perfume in the nose also lingers on the finish of this beer, and the maltyness is in there without providing anything more than a little balance. A faint toasty flavor as well.  Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but that's fine, as IPAs that are too heavy strike me as kind of odd. The resin like quality of the hops as a nice touch to the body. The finish is actually a bit watery, but this beer is more refreshing than overwhelming. It's actually really easy to drink, and the 7% abv can sneak up with the quickness.

287,1093,Sweetmambyjamby,4.13,Had on tap at Dicky's Wild Hare. Came with slight lacing to it. Good golden brown color. Smelled of grapefruit and citrus. For a 7% abv man alive could I put this one down alot. The hop flavor is awesome. There is a slight biscuit smell and flavor as well. As it warms the bitterness fades slightly. All in all a very great beer. One of my favorites.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DmanGTR,4.23,"Review from notes on 12/5/09. Thanks to RocPorterFanatic (Chad) for this awesomeness!  A - Golden honey, very clear, well formed and retained white bubbly head. Lots of spiderweb lacing. 4.5  S - Lots of pine and citrus in awesome balance. Touch of grapefruit but I get some juicy pineapple in there too. Just enough malt to keep a nice balance. 4.0  T - Touch of biscuit and grains, but well hopped. Pine resin, honey, red grapefruit, and much less pineapple than the aroma. Very slight warmth of alcohol in the finish. 4.5  M - Crisp, refreshing, and light body complements the huge flavor of the beer. Well carbonated. 4.0  D - Extremely drinkable for a 7% beer. This may get dangerous... 4.0",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,backfat,4.44,"this beer is very iconic to me. it was basically my transition beer into the crazy world of craft and it holds a special place in my heart. it was my introduction to the hop and all it's glory. at bars around the midwest, it is not uncommon to find this beer on draft at even some of the crappiest of watering holes, and that makes me happy. pours a slightly hazed golden yellow/amber with a one finger off white that dissipates in about a minute. the aroma is outstanding, hoppy and citrus. simple and yet brilliant. green apples, tropical fruits, and flora. the taste is grapefruit, pine hops, biscuity bread, slight caramel malt, and bitters. completely masked alcohol. the drinkability is a 5 out of 5 no question. i could drink 32 of these. always a winner. a true benchmark IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ChadQuest,4.13,"BIG head with a LOT of lacing on top of a clear golden body.  Citrus. all you need to know is citrus in the form of Oranges, and even more specific the bitter peels, with a bit of juicy in there. Orange Orange Orange. Cleans your mouth and gets outa there, leaves a dry finish, which makes you want to sip again instantly.  Great IPA. I personally prefer a bit more Tropical flavors for perfection, but this one is very solid and def top 10 for the style, maybe higher.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,AleWatcher,4.4,"Pours a hazy golden with slight orangey hues. 3 fingers of head rise up over the top of my pint glass in a thick foamy head... Leaves some very heavy lace.  Smells very piney and floral. Earthy notes and citrus/grapefruit as well.  Holy tasty hoppiness! Maybe just a tad bit of roasted malt... then it's hop central! The hops are crisp, clean, and citrusy. But they remain oily enough to coat your mouth and teeth in a wonderfulness that is hard to describe.  If I'm in the mood for a hoppy beer, this one is always a good standby, I've had this many times on tap, and even more in bottles... But is a fantastic beer that I would rank up there with many of the best IPAs and DIPAs I've had -- at least in terms of drinkability!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,lookitsfelias,4.45,"A - pours beautiful cloudy gold with nice prominent foamy head, lots of lacing  S - first impression was distinctly of apricots, faint pine smell  T - surprisingly bready/biscuity malty flavor for an IPA, flowery hops are actually a little mild, but definitely there, absolutely no alcohol flavor  M - thin bodied, with mild carbonation  D - i could see myself housing a bunch of these.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,soco7tyx7,5,"This bottle has been hanging around for a bit but I decided that I didn't want the great flavor to spoil so I'm drinking it now!  A - Golden copper with a thick frothy soapy head. Thin head remains throughout with some thick heady lacing that hangs around till the finish  S - Awesome! sweet pinous resin with sweet caramelized sugary malts. Some citrus notes  T - Piney resin up front with some solid sweet malty backbone and a hint of citrus in the body. Finishes with a mildly bitter resin flavor that hangs around on the back of the tongue...sooo tasty!  M - Smooth, medium body, wet but a little sticky at the same time. Feels thick towards the finish  D - What an amazing IPA! This has got to be my favorite. It is so well balanced and has everything I would want in an IPA. For the ABV it is super drinkable and so enjoyable to drink. If I could only drink one IPA for the rest of my life this might just be it!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,HURTemHIZZY,4.45,"Pours an orangeish yellow, not as dark as the almost amber color of many american ipas. Pour provides a one nad a half finger off white head that sticks around until the beer is finished. Lacing is there, but not as sticky as the head suggested it would be.  The beer is very hoppy, with a slight malty sweetness that helps keep it balanced enough for someone who loves hops as much as i do. Grapefruit and pine are the strongest notes up front, with some nice traces of citrus showing up towards the end of the flavor.  Medium bodied, with a nice coaty mouthfeel. Carbonation keeps the beer very alive and enjoyable, but never becomes so noticeable it takes away from the tasting notes.  Awesome brew for hopheads. absolutely delicious.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Kitt,4.14,"From bottle, a nice golden color. White colored head a bit weak but persistent and frothy. Decent lacing.  Aroma rich, strong, malty, with hops and a hint of citrus. Can't wait to dive in!  Initial taste very pleasing and strong. Rich hops but not overly bitter. Leaves a somewhat unique aftertaste of rich sweet malt rather than strong bitter hops like I'm used to in an AIPA --somewhat of a surprise, yet still very refreshing. A lingering citrus background as well. Overall, an eclectic and well balanced flavor!  Mouthfeel very good. Crisp yet very light carbonation. Actually, about right to balance the rich malt flavor.  Drinkability very good. Goes down easy and smooth with good viscosity for this style.  Overall, this AIPA is a bit off-flavor as the style goes. Hops don't linger long and they are not particularly bitter. I prefer a much stronger bitter-tone in an AIPA. Still, this beer is rich and full of flavor.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,willPS21,4.49,"Masterful. More than I expected. I want to taste this side by side with Hopslam, of which I have some. In my head, I like Two Hearted better! I never even liked an IPA much until this, and it's the first time I've liked a beer with this degree of hoppiness. In fact, it addicted me to it. I love that faintly floral hoppy nasal aftertaste that creeps up on you five minutes later, reminding you you want another. All crisp, no muddle about it. The composition of this beer seemed so aligned. This isn't just an awesome pale ale?? It's so different than any other IPA I've had that I hope I can find more like it. I appreciate the very subtle use of spices, and the peppery spice of the hops. Some darker IPA's overdo the additive spices IMO.  To put it in context, normally I prefer to drink strictly either dark malty faintly bitter chocolate-cappucino-spice flavored RIS or Allagash, but this is a beautiful middle which I now like very very much. It has basically enlightened me.  The mouthfeel was also memorable. It wasn't thick or syrupy, wasn't too bitter and dry after swallowing, just crisp enough and clean enough, and for the ABV, I feel it was perfect.  This is one of two beers that has impressed me more than any other beyond my original expectations (mad elf the other). Bravo!!  UPDATE: This is the most consistent elite beer I've found. Even on the West Coast my brother tells me the Pliny has been slowly degrading. I also find variation between some of the IRS's I like, except Rasputin.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,sitarist,4.5,"Served in a pint glass at the Buckeye Beer Engine.  Poured a cloudy honey yellow with an orange hue. The head was perfect, two fingers of thick white beauty that stuck around throughout most of the glass. Lots of heavy lacing. The aroma was just as beautiful as the appearance. Lots of sweet tropical fruits, pine, slight hint of citrus, dough, and a wood pulp scent. Very complex and balanced. The flavors follow suit with the nose. Very pleasant and great balance of the flavors. Lots of hop flavors mixed well with the malty sweetness. It has a medium body, it feels creamy almost; must be the cask. It has a nice bitter finish. Each sip begs you to take another. So many subtle flavors, each on teasing you to figure them out. Nice body, not to heavy. Goes very well with pup grub.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TheFightfan1,4.07,"Poured a hazy golden color with an intense, thick,soapy white heading. Lacing is just a mess all over the glass and leaves ringlets all the way to the last drop.  Smell is extremely hoppy with a quick follow up of sweet almost sugary maltiness.Fruity aroma's in there,as well as some bubblegum aroma before immediately being caught by the heavy bitter hoppiness.  Taste is a bit off. A very smooth but yet flat taste. Kind of one dimensional. IT is very hoppy and bitter but there is almost no malty backbone that can balance out this amazing hoppiness.  Mouth I would say is lighter bodied with intense carbonation. Slight oiliness that coats the palate and keep it green.  Drink is good. This is easily a session beer and can be enjoyed at anytime but can be a little sneaky.  To me if you can get this on tap it is much better.Something a tad off when bottled.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,laintringulis,4.45,"Served in an imperial pint glass  A: Pour a golden yellow/light orange color with 1.5-2 inches of white foam. Long lasting fine lacing on glass during drinking.  S: Strong grapefruit and citrus, light pine and floral hop aroma. Overall, somewhat delicate smelling.  T: Brief malt flavor on the front,almost biscuit-like, pleasant pine and citrus hops. Very well balanced.  M/D: light bodied without being thin. Pleasant bitterness left in the back of your throat. Very smooth, easy to drink. Refreshing. Almost, too easy. I could drink this all day long.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JoEBoBpr,4.51,Poured into the Sam Adams pint glass.  A - Pours a clear strong golden color with some orange hues. A nice white head of about 1 inch is presented with some chunky bubbles. The head is nice and sticky.  S - Some nice grainy hints are intermingled with the citric and grapefruit hints form the hops. There are some pine notes as the nose finishes off. Some flowery hints as well with the rest of the mellow nose.  T - The taste is very similar to the nose expect for that the taste is a little more vivid. Begins with some nice grain like malt character that is matched with some citric and mild grapefruit rind hints. Pretty simple IPA but still good. Although I like Bells HopSlam I feel like their year-round IPA is Amazing.  M & D - Light body with nice CO2 and a light and subdued feel. Refreshing with a slightly higher ABV.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bartle,4.33,"Bottle batch #9345 Thanks Mike!!!  This pours a beautiful rustic amber - orange witch a very dense white head with great retention and beautiful lacing. Very clear.  The aroma is citrus of grapefruit, tangerines, navel oranges, hints of mangoes and a very pleasant bouquet of pine finish. There is a very faint sense of vanilla that wafts in and out of the nose with the light malt background. I love centennial hops!  This is bitter on the front on the tongue. The pine and florals strike first, the middle is the orange, grapefruit rind, and tangerines, a great balance of caramel sweetness from the malt. That touch of vanilla from the nose. Very balanced, but hop forward. This is juicy and on the sweet side, not astringent or dry.  This is full bodied, moderately creamy and some sugar left on the palate. No hot sensations from the alcohol.  This is my favourite ""go to"" beer. For a 7%ABV it does not taste like that. It really is juicy and bitter, with a superb malt backing. Balanced! Delicious.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mjaskula,4.51,"Served in a pint glass. Pours golden with an off-white head that thins and leaves some nice lacing. I would have liked it to be a little darker, as it is a bit pale.  The hop aroma in this beer is just amazing. Floral, citrusy and fruity sweet and strong. The flavor has plenty of bitterness, but it's not over the top, it's nice and balanced with malt. Mouthfeel is dry, leaving you wanting more. It's not overly bitter, so it's very drinkable. One of my new favorites.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,rawthar,4.56,"Poured from a bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery tulip.  A- Nice amber, sandy color, transluscent, yet clear. The one-finger head doesn't last long, but the bubbly collar clings.  S- Killer hop aroma, equal parts dry pellets and juicy citrus. Reminds me of what a tangerine orchard would smell like at the first blossom of the year, with a bit of piney, grassy bite. Hints of sugary malts run right to the top of the nasal cavity. This is one of the best there is.  T- Definitely driven by the hops, but these hops create some complex flavors. The hints of citrus are still there, but the flavor doesn't exhibit quite the sweetness of the aroma. There's a bit of a cough syrup flavor hidden in there. If you like your hops bitter, you can find it here, but the balance here ensures you don't leave with a bitter look on your face.  M- A nice, smooth, creamy carbonation (almost like a Boddington's or Guinness) without that sharp edge that some of the more bubbly beers display.  D- Awesome at home for a single during the week, even better out at McShea's on draft for an extended drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The smell is amazing, a floral, citrusy aroma - that smells like hops... if you've ever had a handful of hop pellets - that's what it smells like.

Smell is strong, floral hops with a good amount of malts accompanying. Notes of pineapple, pine come in with the hops as well. Taste is assertive hops with a strong malt profile. Acidic citrus notes, with pineapple and some lemon peel, perhaps a bit of orange peel as well. Good malt backbone. Touch of alcohol in the taste. Mouthfeel is crisp, with some good bite midway through. Slightly sticky on the finish. Medium-light body. Drinkability is very good. Very well-balanced, and easy to drink for a fairly high ABV IPA.

287,1093,greengorilla,4.79,I had this beer at a restaurant bar while waiting on my table. It was poured from a bottle into a pilesner glass.  It is a golden amber color with a nice thick head.  The smell is awesome. The combination of citrisy grapefruit and bitter hops is great.  I love the taste. It is one of the best tasting beers that I have ever had.  The mouthfeel was great and it went down way too easy to have such a high alcohol content.  This is a great beer.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,cratez,4.41,"12oz bottle purchased by my girlfriend at Beer World in Largo, FL.  Pours a hazy golden yellow with a thick ring of foamy white head and threads of lacing on the pint glass. Head and lace retain for the duration of the beer.  Smell and taste are floral hops, pineapple, mango, fresh oranges, tangelo, sweet pale malts, and a mildly bitter, white grapefruit finish.  Juicy, crisp mouthfeel has a massively citric hop bite. Lots of fruity hop flavours, with less dryness than your typical IPA. Very refreshing too.  Overall, I can see why Bell's Two Hearted is ranked as a Top 100 U.S. beer, and the low bitterness makes this a crowd pleaser. A flavourful and unique IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,CarolinaCardinals,4.47,Picked up a sixer from BevMo in early January for $10.49. Part of Batch 9463 born on 11-23-09.  Beer poured a golden orange with a two finger head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is a wonderful mix of floral hops and malts - still quite pungent even towards the end of the bottle! Taste is very well balanced. Cereal malts blend wonderfully with piney and citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and very smooth. Drinkability is very good. This is one of the best balanced IPAs I have ever had. At 7.0 abv it is definitely not sessionable but dangerously drinkable - found that out while drinking it on tap at Old Chicago a few weeks back!

A single layer of tiny bubbles covers the top of this deep warm yellow slightly opaque brew.  S= Nice tangerine-citrus aroma with a light malt aroma. Very nice and fresh smelling.  T= Hop Dominate the profile! Citrus-grapefruit, with a good piney finish. Fantastic hop flavor and a very quiet malt flavor.  MF= Good tingle on the tongue. Delicious lasting bitterness.

Taste was full of sharp and crisp grapefruit, orange, and floral tones with the occasional tinge of grassiness (from too much dry-hopping?). Bitterness lingers a bit on the finish and mouthfeel runs a little light, but it works. Reminds me of a nicely dry-hopped homebrewed IPA.

287,1093,Phelps,3.97,"Enjoyed at Taste of Tops with fellow BA tlay88.  The beer pours a mostly clear pale straw yellow, with no bubbles and a white head that seems to linger a long time, but has little stickiness and lacing.  Wow, the hops! Pine, lemons, and a candy sweetness caress the nose, and I can get the aroma from inches away.  In the taste, hops again lead the way with a muted citrus bitterness reminiscent of lemon pith. There's also an interesting sweet coconut flavor and a certain earthiness, like potatoes. This beer has the complexity of a good vodka.  THe body is somewhat light, but active carbonation wakes you up and leads you into the bright, clean finish.  This is one easy-drinking IPA.

Smells like a hoppy blast of goodness. Hops galore, pine, maybe some of that tangerine, a sweet candied smell develops as the beer warms slightly.  Taste is wonderful. I'd had this bottled once before and didn't think it could be appreciated more. All the afore-mentioned items from the smell, but it has a great backup dancer to keep the whole show alive: malted barley. Mmm, just the right amount of balance to prevent this from becoming too polarzingly hoppy. For an IPA (i.e. not a DIPA) this is incredible. Tastes better than most doubles, but I enjoy wet-hopping more so I may be biased against the extra bitterness of a Double IPA.  Mouthfeel is creamy and full without being thick.  2 words describe this beer: 'fan', and 'tastic'.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Not sure if the type of glass was the reason for this or not. Smells floral and fresh like the first day of spring. The palate on this beer is quite pleasing. Citric and piney with soft bitterness. Malt and hop selection mesh well making for a balanced IPA with loads of flavor without being too aggressive like many highly hopped beers. Moderate in body and very dry with a crisp feel on the tongue. One of the most drinkable IPA's that I've had, thanks to the softness of the bitterness. We shall meet again.

This is a very good tasting ale. I would say it is just right. Not to over powering with hops.  It goes down smooth with a light carbonation.  Good drinkability! I could see my self drinking a couple of these.  Overall I think this is a very good beer! I have had other beers from Bell's and have always been happy. I also notictied at the liqour store that you know can get a 5 liter (1.32) gal. mini keg of Two hearted ale for your fridge!

Pours a hazy golden color. I had to pour it pretty hard just to get a head to form and then it went away. No lacing.  Smells of some almost noble hops. A little citrus. And some malt. Not alot of aroma going on and this is a pretty fresh bottle.  Taste is good, but I feel I could name off a whole bunch more IPA's that are better tasting to get the top 100 spot. American hop taste and some decent malt. The thing I think is the reason why it should get a little higher rating is you can't taste the 7% ABV at all. It tastes like a session IPA. But still green flash, stone, 60min, all better than this.  Mouthfeel is good. No complaints  overall it's a good beer so try it if you can but I just dont think it's as good as some others that are not in the top 100.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Great retention.  s - Smells of hops and sweet malts. A tiny bit of citrus as well. I was actually surprised by the balance; I was expecting a lot more hops and a lot less sweetness.  t - Again, tastes strongly of hops with a little bit of bitterness, followed by sweet malts. I was again surprised how balanced it was and how much the sweet malts stood out.  m -Medium body with moderate carbonation, it has both a bit of a bitterness to it, followed by smoothness from the malts. Very nice.  d - Very nice and balanced. The hops didn't stand out as much as I thought they would, but the balance and smoothness from the malts was a pleasant surprise.

287,1093,twoheartedheel,5,This beer is the reason I love beer. It's my gold standard which I compare all other hoppy beers to.  The most perfect combination of hops I have yet to come across. beautiful balance of floral and citrus notes. beautiful amber/apricot pour. smooth and perfect finish.  I cannot recommend this beer enough.  Those Bells boys in Kalamazoo know what they're doing.

Out of the bottle the color is a light orange head lasted for a couple minutes. The smell of this one does not pop out at you as some IPA's do, but the taste is a reminder of what a good IPA should be.

287,1093,tjinohio,4.05,"The appearance of the beer is a wonderful orange-amber in keeping with an American IPA.  The color also prepares you for the bouquet which is sweet with an orange citrus scent with a hint of coriander.  That coriander and citrus also comes out in the taste. There is a good hops bite, but it is well balanced with the other flavors.  The mouthfeel is good. Nice level of carbonation.  This is very drinkable beer. It goes down smoothly. The balance of the bitterness of the hops with the sweet of the citrus makes it a comfortable beer to drink, unlike some IPA's which are more of an assault (as wonderful as that assault might be) on the pallet.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ktrillionaire,4.58,"This is one of my favorite beers. It is always better than solid; every time I drink it I am pleasantly surprised.  I haven't had it on tap since last year, in Chicago. I was understandably stoked when I saw this shiny new handle at my favorite Mexican restaurant.  A &#8211; Wow. Impressive. Hazy copper-orange hue, with one finger of white foam and huge chiffon-esque sheets of lacing. Amazing.  S &#8211; Floral and dank; this is a very aromatic brew. And so pleasantly exotic.  T &#8211; Dank, resiny, and piney; multifaceted hop flavor. This beer is so herbal, citric, and evergreen; the richness of flavor is also quite complex despite relying solely on hops. The malt backbone is an interesting rich bitter base, not caramel-y at all. Very enjoyable, and just about the top of the style.  M &#8211; IPA. Good. I hate describing a good IPAs feel. Not too thick or thin, syrupy or watery, prickly or flat.  D &#8211; Hell yeah. Probably best on-tap, too.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,goldbot,4.12,"12 oz. bottle, listed as batch 9547. According to the website this was bottled on 1/19/2010. Tasted on 1/30/2010.  Pours golden orange in color with good medium thick, foamy white head. Decent carbonation in the beer with a slight chill haze. The head stays solid almost indefinitely with a lot of lacing, as expected.  Good citrus hops aroma here, lots of grapefruit and orange, and there is also a strong herbal/grassy hops smell. A touch of pine as well mixed with the grassy aroma. Taste is again a planty hop flavor with citrus and a bit of pine as well, but it is not quite ""sticky"" with pine and hops like some stronger IPAs. No particular malt flavor but rather the hops are balanced with a nice sweetness and body which mixes well with a light bitterness. No alcohol heat, aftertaste is somewhat bitter and leaves a planty feel in the mouth and throat.  A light to medium body and it clings to the tongue a bit. This beer seemed like Hopslam light to me, but definitely in a good way. While not having the heavier bitterness and hoppiness of its DIPA counterpart, this beer still offers a tasty, balanced beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A Translucent orange yellow body under a very creamy head that lingered for at least 5 minutes. Good lacing left on the inside of the glass as well. 4.0  S Floral and very fragrant hops with a background of sweet malt that presents as a butterscotch sweetness. Hops predominate here, though. 4.0  T The big, bitter hops with the medium butterscotch like malt presence predominate in that classic 2 Hearted taste. I do not notice a difference in the cask with the smell or taste. 3.5  M This is where the cask presentation really changes things. First, the beer is near room temperature and it has a kind of ""classic"" beer feel as in this is the way that the brewer's intended to present it. I really like the feel of this cask version. 4.5  D Fair to good. The hop levels are too high for me but there is enough balance to make this a really interesting beer, one that I would certainly look for again. 3.5",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

I went as far as having a friend drive a case from Michigan to WA so I could relive memories.  Prem showed up at 5 with a keg of Two Hearted. Three of us sat around, drinking mason jars off the beast and laughing about school and life and girls and money and beer. With prodding the house turned to anarchy, many showing up to sip the magic brew and tastes the goddesses toes. Woke at 4 am, walked to work at 5. I sobered up around 9.

This is a very tasty beer, nice and refreshing.  M: Medium bodied with a nice medium carbonation. Nice and clean finish.  D: Drinkability is great!

Two inches of big frothy head that laces very, very well. Good looker.  Smell- Very nice citrus and fruit punch from the hops. Mango, tangerine, some grapefruit. Very tropical. Quite nice. Tinniest hint of sweet caramel. Very nice, but not a punch in the face.  Taste- Starts off with that nice tropical fruit. Lots of sweet mango hoppiness. Very nice. Very light pale malt. Plenty of grapefruit. Disappears for a moment and then a nice bitterness on the finish. Not too dry at the end. Makes you want more.  Mouthfeel- The tiniest bit thin, but very nice.  Drinkability- Smooth and easy. Could put down a sixer of these no problem. Doesn't seem like even a 7%.  This is an excellent IPA. One of the best out there.

287,1093,sisuspeed,4.18,"Thanks go out to abuliarose for splitting this with me and to adamharbaugh for shipping it out to her. Awesomeness all around. Poured into a pint glass, Bell's Two Hearted Ale produces a slightly hazy, golden-orange body with a thick, sticky, white head on top. Patches of lacing slide along the glass.  The aroma carries a nice helping of citrus laden hops and a sweet malt backbone. Hops move from grassy citrus to floral like quality. Nice blend.  Tipping back the glass sends a wave of bitter, spicy hops across the tongue, followed by sweet, caramel malts. A nicely balanced flavor profile that still puts the hops front and center like it should.  Mouthfeel has a bitter edge to it that is actually refreshing. Malts are chewy and robust. Sticky hops, always a good sign for a quality IPA.  Drinkability is great. This IPA has plenty of hoppiness to keep pulling you back and an ABV that almost pulls it into the sessionable range. After having one, you'll be looking for another.  Overall, what can I really add that hasn't already been said? This is an excellent IPA and deserves the rating it gets. Maybe even a better one. If I had access to this all the time, I'm sure there would always be one in the fridge. Nice work Bell's!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,abuliarose,4.36,"A special thanks goes to adamharbaugh for this beer trade. We get no Bell's around here, and from what I've heard this is the Bell's brew to get.  Pours a pleasingly hazy deep golden amber with a thick creamy head. Pretty lacing. Nice bubbling. Smells fresh and hoppy with good light cirtus presence. All things I like to see and smell in an IPA.  Tastes really well-balanced. Well-arranged malt profile on first sip, betraying just the right amount of sweetness (less than Hopslam) and bitterness. Nice citrus rind character throughout, kind of orange-grapefruit tasting. Solid bitterness to round it out at the end, really bringing out the hops. Carbonation is rounded and tingly, complimenting the citrus flavor nicely, but dies down to reveal smooth liquid, soft maltiness that's almost silky. On the heavier end of light-bodied. Very, very drinkable. This is one I would go to again and again for all those traditional foods one drinks beer with. As it is, this glass is being drained entirely too quickly!

287,1093,weatherdog,4.17,12 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip  Batch 9480  It pours with a nice two finger head protecting a crystal clear amber body. The head quickly disappears to a fine layer of bubbles provided by the bottom etching in the glass.  The aroma is huge in orange hops with just a little bit of grassy types. Not really any malt balance in the nose.  The taste has a medium citrus orange bitterness up front. It is fairly bright and fresh. The malt backbone is much more represented in the taste than the nose. It is very balanced which is what i like in a regular IPA.  This beer is probably the most easy drinking IPA or beer at an ABV of 7% I've encountered. The carbonation seems to be at a perfect level in order to take that bitterness away so the palette doesn't become fatigued after several. I could drink a 6-pack of this no problem and I see why they sell 5-liter mini-kegs.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,devilben02,4.1,"Poured from my home tap, this one has a golden orange color with a billowy, off-white head. The color is deceptively light compared to the flavors packed inside. Very fragrant, with the aroma having a complex hop character that is both citrusy and earthy. The flavor amplifies these characteristics, with notes of grapefruit, pine, and grass. This is not just another hop-bomb, though, as there is also at least a bit of balance from an underlying caramel malt sweetness (but the malt aspect is certainly subtle compared to the hops). The mouthfeel is both crisp and resinous somehow, with a refreshing, hoppy bite that morphs into a sticky, lingering bitterness. Overall, it's wonderfully bitter, yet quite drinkable, especially considering the 7% alcohol. I've had Dogfish 60-minute and Foothills Hoppyum on my tap before this one, and Two-Hearted is as good if not better in some aspects. It is certainly a go-to beer for the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,afausser,4.32,"A little surprised that I haven't reviewed this one yet...reviewed on tap (though I will note that I have consistently liked this one better from the bottle, FYI).  A: Pours a light, wheaty amber with a near finger of head in the pint class in which it is poured. The retention isn't too great, but the lacing is huge--a sticky, persistent sheet. There's also a good deal of carbonation bubbles.  S: Plenty of floral notes as well as heavy hops. It's a sweet one--and I've not yet come across anything that quite approximates it. There's definitely pine and citrus accompanying the hops, but it's not overwhelming by any means.  T: I think this is the only Bell's I've had to date that I haven't gotten a cherry note from--and it really stands apart from their other beers stylisticly to me. There's the requisite amount of hops, pine, and grapefruit, but what makes this stand apart is the honey and floral notes. Don't get me wrong--it certainly isn't like Hopslam, etc.--many of the same tastes are there but are blended quite differently. Just a touch of bread and malts, but definitely largely dominated by floral hops, juicy oranges, and lemon/grapefruit zest.  M: Quite crisp and bubbly, and pops in the mouth quite a bit, which is great considering the brew isn't particularly hot or spicy. The carbonation is quite dense, and quite persistent, but this works very very well with Two Hearted. Little to no aftertaste--just a bit of a kick from the bubbles and from the hops.  D: Easily drinkable--though it's in the mid-range as far as ABVs are concerned, it still drinks pretty well. Definitely a unique brew and very interestingly blended. It's a great session beer, and while I've had it enough times for it to lose a bit of its novelty, I'm still coming back to it. I'll have to do a review out of the bottle at some point--I swear it's better (though maybe the kegs I've had it from weren't the best?) and might bump the rating up a bit.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The body is smooth and slightly oily on the tongue. Crisp carbonation backs it up well. Nice sharp bitter hops right away, but nothing that is too harsh or scalding.

Great active carbonation.  S: Fresh piney-citrus hops, a perfect blend at a perfect strength, with just the perfect little touch of sweetness.

The most brilliant orange image resonates all over the glass. A not quite astringent aroma wafts up ya, getting your expectations up. And then taste hits, the mildest alcohol warming sensation, the orange taste, the great hop citrus. This is like Bert Grant's coming back from the grave, but from the midwest this time. A tiny bit of sweetness, like they threw a shot or two of Gran Marinier in a batch.  Mouthfeel is so rewarding. One of the first beers I recall using the new hops. Very drinkable.

287,1093,feelmefoam,4.65,"Poured from a 12 ouncer into my Dogfish Head specialty glass.  Heard a lot about this beer, figured I'd give it a shot and save it for my 100th review. Right out of the bottle this thing looks great. Pours a murky yet glowing honey wheat color with light peach-colored highlights and lots of effervescent carbonation running up the side of the glass and into two fingers of fluffy, bubbly off-white head. The head has amazing retention and leaves dripping rings of sticky lacing hanging from the side of the glass.  The nose is probably one of the best I've smelled on any beer to date. As soon as I popped the bottle, I could smell a cornucopia of scents, and that beautiful head on the beer really helped release them once it hit the glass. Candied lemon peel, grapefruit, and any other kind of citrus you can think of leap out of the glass in volumes. This thing smells delicious.  Two Hearted doesn't disappoint on the palate, either. I was geared up for a punishing bout with the citrusy hops I smelled in the nose, and although they were there in full flavor, a sweet, buttery maltiness hung around to counteract some bitterness and make for an interesting combination of bitterness, sweetness, and sticky hop flavor in my mouth. I could ask for maybe a bit more bitterness, but who am I to complain? Very well done.  The mouthfeel is good as well. Medium bodied with a creaminess that works well with the oily nature of the hops, as well as a restrained amount of carbonation that doesn't overpower but lets you know it's there with a tickle on the tongue. Two Hearted starts wet and creamy and finishes dry.  Bell's really knocked this one out of the park. I could drink a six pack of this in one night and not regret it at all, no matter what the next morning held for me. Just a very well put-together American IPA that doesn't disappoint in any of the categories and excels in most. A very solid choice for my 100th review. Here's to you, Two Hearted.

287,1093,Patrick999,4.06,"I've had this more than a few times...why have I not reviewed it? This is a slightly older bottle....it has to be about 6-7 months.  A - Quite good. Cloudy gold due to its unfiltered nature. Lot of foam, a lot of lacing. American IPAs don't get much better looking.  S - Even slightly older, this still takes on a really nice hop aroma. This is different than it was fresh, mind you. Now I'm getting an interesting aged hop aroma....flowery, with candied pineapple and mango? Almost smells like a Belgian IPA of some sort, or some odd Belgo-German hybrid. As I said, very different from really fresh examples, Quite flowery and tropical fruit-y, still very good. It's still all about the hops, they just smell different.  T - Similar to the aroma, it isn't what it was fresh - but that doesn't mean it's bad. It has a flowery, spicy taste to it, almost as if this was spiked with Saaz and Hallertau rather than American hops. Slight nuttiness comes out as it warms further. Not overtly malty, even with some age. I think this allows the interesting aged hop flavors to come through.  F - Still great body on this one. Almost creamy.  D - This review is intended to approximate what my review of a fresher bottle would have been. Still, with some age on it, it's not a waste of time. In fact, I like it about as much as the fresh Two-Hearted, so don't give me crap about reviewing an aged beer.

Nice hazy orange color with a large-bubbled white head. Smell had all the tropical hop characters and bready malt this beer is remarkable for. Flavor was also enjoyably sweet with fantastic mango/citrus/pineapple flavors over biscuity caramel malt. Mouthfeel was smooth, not dull like some cask beers and the lack of carbonation really seemed to prolong the bitter finish.  Two Hearted is a very good IPA that is even better as a cask ale.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,squaremile,3.63,"Pours a gold/light orange color, aroma is hops and some sweetness, nothing too special there. The taste is very interesting with a solid balance of piney hop bitterness and sugar cookie sweetness. I notice how sweet this beer is more than anything, which I enjoy, but it does fatigue me after about 20oz. I think this is one of the top 5 east coast style IPAs out there, but compared to the hop blast of the west coast versions, it doesn't hold up. But I do order it every time I am in the midwest.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Poser,4.35,"Pours a solid copper hue with a frothy top. Decent lacing. Aroma is strong on the citrus hops but with some florals there to help balance things. Flavor and mouthfeel are very heavy on the bitter. If you're not into IPAs, it might be a bit too much like drinking pinesol but if you're into the style it's a great hop-heavy-but-not-ridiculous IPA. This has earned a place in my top 5 or so IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,eternaljester81,4.44,"I have to start by saying that Two Hearted is one of, if not my favorite, IPAs. With biases known, on we go.  A - This may be the one place where this beer lacks. There's nothing wrong with the appearance, it's just not overly striking. It pours a translucent gold with a relatively thin, white head. Lacing is decent, but I've certainly seen better.  S - Earthy hops up front, citrus in the middle (maybe mixed with cotton candy?), a some faint alcohol in the back. The scent is pleasant and inviting, and not overly aggressive. Unlike some IPAs, the scent is akin to ""hop perfume"" (not that there's anything wrong with that).  T - Obviously as it should, this is where Two Hearted shines. The taste is balanced, but leaning toward a bittersweet hop bite. There's still plenty of malty sweetness to counteract with the hops, with a definite hint of cotton candy coming through in the middle. A thorough ""swish"" through the mouth reveals the alcohol, which is otherwise well hidden. The finish is dry, with a mildly bitter aftertaste.  M - Not thick, but also not watery, the mouthfeel is spot-on for the style. The oily-ness of the hops balances well with the thiner, more refreshing nature of the brew, for something that is nicely pleasing.  D - While the hops provide a strong kick, there's nothing about this beer that's overpowering, making for a very drinkable brew. The 7.1% alcohol is deceptive in that it's not really noticeable unless the drinker is searching for it.  Overall, Two Hearted Ale is classic standby in the style, and an absolute go-to beer for myself. The price-tag is a bit hefty, but I'm of the mind that if a beer is worth it, price isn't of matter. Although, the price would almost certainly exclude this from being an everyday drinker. Regardless, Two Hearted is highly recommended for anyone calling his/herself an IPA fan.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A- pours a hazy light orange color. a vigorous pour produced a massive amount of head with tons of lacing. a very inviting IPA.  S- the aroma is fantastic. bursting with citrus notes. orange, lemon, and bitter grapefruit. almost stings the nostrils with the acidity. I love it.  T- surprisingly this beer is not overly bitter. it has an awesome malt backbone. a little sweetness plays into the orange/lemon citrus flavors and a load of bitterness finishes strong with biscuit flavors in the backround. it's without a doubt a hop forward beer but the more subtle malt profile makes it something special  M/D- ample carbonation gives the beer great crispness and adds to the drinkability. nothing standout about the feel besides that. clocking in a 7.0% this beer really drinks too easily, but there are lighter easier drinking IPAs out there. still a flavorful & refreshing beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,minnunderground,4.05,"Damn it. I was waiting in hopes of getting a fresh one. Well mine was bottled on oct 28 or something. About 2 1/2 months old I really wanted a fresher one. Well the taste is good. I am not a huge hop head and only drink IPA's every couple of weeks and not many doubles for that matter. And really this tastes good but Not as much hop as I was expecting. Anyways had a kinda dry mouthfeel and adequate carbonation decent head retention, Piney then citrus hops. Very drinkable stuff and not too overpowering could get you in some trouble with the 7% and tasting like this. A good IPA, Even though Michigan is close unless I can get it fresher I will stick with the Wisconsin IPA's",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,icetraxx,4.62,"A: Poured a little too slowly into my regular pint glass and produced a one finger head which dissipated into a half-finger head rather quickly. The head sits as a cap for the rest of the beer, producing a little lacing. The beer is a golden amber in color with some orange haziness. I think an IPA could look much better. After have this one multiple times, on-tap and from the bottle, I feel that two hearted is too hazy for the style and overall lacks head retention compared to similar IPAs.  S: Hops and Sourdough bread-like malt. The hops produce a fruity sensation that reminds me of banana, flowers, a tinge of orange, and finally some maple syrup sap/resin like aroma. The malt reminds me of sourdough bread and popcorn, but not adjunct-like, more so the buttery aspect of popcorn. Not hugely aromatic, but not muted.  T: Buttery, sweet malt with a balanced upfront bitterness, then a crisp finish. A fruity yet floral flavor that is similar to the aroma I described above is definitely noticeable. As a new IPA drinker, the bitterness does not hang on the tongue like I thought it would; there is very little aftertaste which is nice. The hops seem to be balanced with the malt, I really like that. EDIT: After considerable IPA tasting, I can see that Two Hearted is truly a world-class IPA with a world class flavor profile. Taste score raised to 5.  M: Creamy and viscous for being a light colored beer. Perfectly, if slightly, over-carbonated.  D: I am surprised how refreshing, yet warming this beer is. The crisp yet malty finish begs me to take another sip over and over again. I am now convinced that this is the World's best session IPA (though with 7.1% alcohol one should be careful).  O: The first IPA that I have loved. Delicious and ""moreish"", a 12oz bottle is never quite enough. Thanks, Bell's, for enticing me to try more beers of the IPA style. Bell's Two Hearted is one of the few beers that really is more than the sum of it's parts.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S- Pale malt, mild pine and floral hops (simcoe?). Not terribly hoppy, but what's there is nice.  T- Significantly hoppy, my fears are unwarranted. Pine, resin, tree sap, bitter grapefruit rind, little to no malt. Sugary sweetness comes through, along with a bit of floral sweetness (like hibiscus)at times. Hmm. Interesting hop profile. Perhaps a bit too sweet for my tastes.  M- Good carbonation, hops are a bit acidic but that's OK, pretty good all the way around.  D- Fairly high, I enjoyed it. If it was in my distribution circle I'd get a 6er every once in a while.

Bitter oh yes! Looks good and feels good in your mouth. (make sure to decant this one though!) Amazing frothy head with fairly nice sticky lacing for this style. Smooth and drinkable for its style, not over carbonated. Lacking a bit on depth of taste but I believe it fits its style nicely. 2 or 3 will go down great on a hot day but the high alcohol content will knock you down fairly quickly! Not sessionable for me but a good start to a tasty evening of drinks. Yum.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,dstc,4.5,Pours a beautiful slightly cloudy amber color with a big frothy head. Head falls slow but remains. Nice sticky lace.  Beautiful hop nose with a nice herbal character.

Well done Bell's (again).,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Kendo,4.6,"A: Poured into a pint glass. Body is golden honey-amber with a half-finger fluffy ivory head that sits well. Nice splotches of lace left behind.  S: Wow. This is what I want an IPA to smell like. Fresh C-hops are there in force. Grapefruity, lemony and juicy hops. Very, very pleasant nose.  T: Foundation of lighter malt is then subsumed by hops. Think juicy, sugar-coated grapefruit and a touch of resiny pine, though with the grapefruit the more dominant flavor. Finishes with a slightly grassy lemony taste to it as well.  M: Lighter than medium in heft, with carbonation perhaps a bit more active than I'd like. But all in all it's real smooth in the mouth, so maybe that carbonation isn't too much after all (&lt;bumps score to 4.5&gt;).  D: If this isn't a 5 then I want to meet the beer that is. Immensely drinkable. I had one with dinner (some sort of Moroccan-type chicken dish with cilantro) and had been planning to save the last of the sixer for some other special occasion but couldn't resist. Inasmuch as I cannot get this beer in NY, I am uncertain when I will get to sample this one again. For that I am sad.  Notes: My wife was drinking a Stone IPA while I was drinking this, so I did the Pepsi challenge. We both liked the Two Hearted better. It's lighter and a bit finer, but went down more easily. If I had access to this in NY, I would buy it by the case.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Unbelievable tropical fruit and citrus aroma. Tons of pineapple, papaya, mango, orange, tangerine, grapefruit. An absolute treat to inhale.  Citrus and floral hops dominate the flavor, however they aren't as comlex or strong as in the nose. Some malt sweetness for balance, some caramel some bread. Solid bitterness, but not a tongue-scraper. Quite smooth. Finishes rather dry.  Medium carbonation, smooth mouthfeel, relatively light-bodied.

The smell is almost my favorite part - it screams of a solid IPA but yet it's completely unique. So floral it's surprising, and it makes you want to taste it even more.  The taste is, in my opinion, what beats you into submission. It's obviously a top-notch IPA, but yet it's different in so many ways. Maybe a little sweeter than the classic hop bomb, but absolutely crisp with the kind of aftertaste that keeps my attention.  The mouthfeel is smooth; the alcohol is well hidden for a higher gravity IPA.  Drinkability? Give me a case and lock me in a closet for a week.

287,1093,RppIII,4.47,"Poured from a 12ounce bottle into a Pint Glass  Pours an amber with hints of mahogany, the head is a phenomenal three fingers and amber white. The lacing of this beer almost outdoes the massive fluffy head and the retention never leaves the top of the beer uncovered. Once settled into the glass the beer takes on a beautiful haze letting you know that this beer is packed with flavour!  Hop citrus, grapefruit, grapefruit and some more grapefruit waft from my glass. I love the smell of the Centennial hops absolutely fantastic.  The smell is a perfect preview to the deliciousness that awaits in each mouthful of hop infused goodness. A sweet, citrusy, hop flavour of grapefruit balances well against the bittering hop characteristics of this beer. Seems to sweeten as it warms, a very bold candied sugar flavour is present for the majority of the taste, a slight bitterness presents itself almost as an afterthought and soon fades back to a light candy and citrus flavour.  Carbonation and viscosity make this beer pleasing to the palate.  A very drinkable and well-crafted beer, it has everything if not more than I would expect from an American IPA. Extremely flavourful and well balanced this beer plays on itself first by captivating you with it's deep amber and frothing white head. It takes hold with it's magnificent aroma of grapefruit, citrusy hops, and a hint of sweet fruit. The flavour drags you in with a ridiculously large grapefruit and citrus flavour congruous to the bittering subtleties of the hops. The feel of this beer in your mouth and it's sheer need to be consumed get you hooked. I set this beer as the standard to which all others in this style strive to reach.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

T: Grapefruit and flowers hit the palate with a nice degree of bitterness along with a bread-like character. The finish is rather dry and slightly bitter.  M: Light to medium-bodied with a refreshing carbonation and a slight lingering bitterness.  D: Great drinkabilty as the 7.1% abv. is nowhere to be found.

I have experienced a bad batch of this brew, which was cloudy, and ""off"" in flavor.  However, I am glad that I have given Bells a second chance. Multiple good experiences since.  Not quite translucent, which is not a negative, IMHO. Nice white head.  Smells and tastes strongly of grapefruit/citrus.  Crisp mouthfeel, with good carbonation.  Very drinkable.

287,1093,Philabeerphia,3.76,"12oz bottle poured at home into a snifter on a relaxed afternoon dated 1/1/10. Relatively huge bubbling in the head... sudsy. One of the telltale signs of a good IPA, IMO. Just enough haze to shroud the light of the room from shining clearly through. The nucleation from the bottom of the glass is also barely visible through this cloud. Sweet honey colored beer. Lots of sticky icky lacing deposits on the glass. THE! look of an IPA...  The smell starts with a cooling medicinal, herbal kick. Slightly soapy and flowery. Grandma's washroom after a nice lavender soap session kinda thing. I like that kind of homey hoppiness. A tinge of citric punch as well, but it is awash in soothing sweet malts... it warms into a toasted malt and earthy hop combo yielding a sharp finish on the nose. Largely appealing, if not astounding. Sharp as well on the tongue with plenty of carbonation biting on the front. Burnt toast, bitter pine hop Dominate the middle of the body. Caramel with the tart bite - like a candy apple. A buttery, soapy finish. A last slap to the mouth is the highlight of this beer - plenty of floral hop that still makes you pucker... coats and lingers. I feel like I've fallen out of love with this beer just a bit. Plenty of great aspects, but it somehow isn't coming together quite as impressively as I remember. OK, I really love the carbonation on this beer... accentuates the hop bite, keeps the show moving, and doesn't allow the membranal finish to become cloying.

287,1093,CaptMurdock,3.76,Poured from a tap into a Nonic Pint.  Appearance: Poured slightly lighter than most IPA's that I've tried leaning more toward amber than orange. The head was beautifully thick and stuck around for the whole pint.  Smell: The aroma was a bit muted to me. I could certainly pull out the citrus and hops but it was not as prevalent as I would have liked.  Taste: All of the usual suspects were there. I got the huge hop explosion up front followed by some citrus and sweetness but it kind of fizzled away. It was really similar to the smell. Everything was present but it was just slightly muted. This isn't to say that there was anything wrong with the taste because it was thoroughly enjoyable. I just wanted more of it. I would also like to say that the aftertaste was superb and very inviting.  Feel: The feel was everything I want from an IPA. Medium body with bitter hops and alcohol warming the tongue allowing everything to flow easily. Very well done.  Drinkability: I could drink several of these back-to-back with no palate fatigue. If this were slightly more affordable and readily available in case form in my area I could easily make this a session brew.  I think I may have been looking forward to this one too much.

The smell was floral and I could smell the bitterness  The taste is smooth and bitter at the end of each sip on the tip of the tongue. delicious in gulps.  The mouthfeel isn't too astringent, great IPA  I could drink four of them easily, while being entertained of course.  Its a good session IPA",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,champ103,3.46,"A: Pours a clear copper/orange color. An egg white head forms and rises to over two fingers, and has great retention. There are rings of sticky lace. S: Grassy, floral, citrus, and grapefruit aromas. The aroma is also of perfume. Soapy and oily. T: Again, a huge hop flavor that follows the nose. Citrus and floral. Substantial bitter grapefruit. Soapy and oily again. A light sugary malty flavor lingers. M/D: A medium body that is crisp and dry. However this is really oily and soapy Fusel alcohol shows. The high ABV and the bitterness makes this a one and done.  Not bad at all. A pretty standard American IPA with a bit more alcohol. If you are a hop head this will be a treat.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,llllDrGONZOllll,4.82,"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass  A: Golden ale with a slight haze from the bottle conditioning, this ale will if poured careful to a brilliant orange and gold. I like the yeast, so I give it a swirl to get all the goodies sometimes. A thin white cap of head has settled quickly from the thick two fingers that once was. a medium amount of co2 bubbles arise from the laser etched glass bottom bringing a depth to the color.  S: A strong blast of sweet citric hops fill the nose and linger enough you can almost taste them. A slight amount of floral hop aroma comes through faintly... almost undetected. The smell of oranges, grapefruits and some girlie candle my wife would burn come to mind.  T: Anyone who ever wants to know what an American IPA should taste like should be pointed at this brew directly. Sweet and sour citrus balanced by subtle grain and a faint nip of alcohol at the finish. Ale has never tasted so good. Two Hearted is brewed with only one hop variety... Centennial. The amounts and the times of the hop additions must have been handed down from God herself. Dont think this IPA is a one trick pony, trust me the grain bill has its strong points too. A complex taste of caramel and slightly roasted barley peek in and fill the mouth. The barely detectable appearance of heat comes through at the finish, but before you know it your not sure if it was even there.  M: Not too thick.... not too thin... not too carbonated... not under carbonated. I have to hand it to Bell's this beer must be quaffed. Full mouthfuls are the only way to get all this complexity in one swallow. This beer does not coat your mouth with sticky grain. This beer is not too thin and dry like most west coast IPAs.  D: The 7% + ABV saddens me because it feels like heaven in my mouth. I would love to drink this all night... and I have tried, but to enjoy it down one and casually drink the rest. In PA its a $40 case so I can't have it all the time. When I can buy it I do Two Hearted has made it harder for me to try new brews I just cant get enough.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BillyBoysPie,4.25,"From a bottle into a pint glass.  Deep golden yellow. A touch of straw in it, but still a great clear gold. Nice bone-white head, about 3/4 of an inch. It settles down into a layer and leaves enough sticky foam to coat the entire side of the glass.  Florals - rose, lilac, and a touch of lavender; Bitter hop; Tangy citrus - mostly lemon with a hint of lime and orange. Almost sweet smelling - I had fears of an overly sweet hoppy beer. These were proven wrong.  Really fantastic beer with a great deal of depth. Begins with bitter hops and citrus. That flows nicely into the uncomplicated barley malt that gives this beer it's body. Finishes with florals, a touch of sweet honey, and a reprise of lemon zest. Really, really well done.  Well carbonated - nice, light mouthfeel with plenty of bitter to give a touch of pucker. Well balanced, and the 7.0% alcohol is nowhere to be noticed.  A great brew, and I'm very glad I've got 5 more to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BeerPhan86,4.32,"I have been waiting to try this one for a very long time. My friend from Minnesota brought me some of this along with some Surly Furious in exchange for Pumking bombers. Yum!  A - Pours a hazy golden amber with a one finger sticky white head. The head dissipated quickly but the lacing was good. There appears to be some sediment floating around.  S - Very floral with tons of citrus hops. Lots of tropical fruit here other than citrus though, including pineapple, pear, and apple. There is also a nice spicy aspect to the nose, and I pick up on some vanilla and cinnamon which I have never smelled in an IPA before. Very sweet smelling.  T - Initially you get hit with the citrus hops, much like the aroma. Very floral with a slightly dry and bitter finish where I taste more piney hops. Sweet malty backbone makes this IPA very well balanced. Reminds me very much of the Ithaca Flower Power IPA but in my opinion is even better.  M - Lighter bodied than most IPAs but very smooth, and has just the right amount of carbonation I am looking for in the style.  D - Very tasty, the alcohol is well hidden. I could drink this all night.  Overall, this one lived up to it's reputation. Definitely one of the best IPAs I've had, and that says a lot as I tend to gravitate towards this style and its imperial older brother.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Can smell hints of lemon and pear.  T/M: Smooth initially then hits back of tongue with a powerful citrus taste. Lingers with fruity taste briefly. Does not have a bitter after taste at all. Phenomenal IPA.  D: Extremely drinkable. Very smooth and easy on the stomach.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Kinda cloudy, with an off white foamy head that seems to last forever. Lots of lacing, sticky, resiny, hoppy lacing.  Huge hoppy aroma. There is alot going on here, almost overwhelming at first. Citrus is dominant, but there are a whole host of other smells fighting to be noticed. Lots of fruity aroma, very sweet, a hint of strawberries, maybe even a little pineapple...  The taste blows me away. I expected a mouth puckering amount of raw hops, but to my surprise ths beer is quite balanced. The hops are definately at the forefront, but a malty sweetness is definately present as well.  very sticky mouthfeel, stickiness increases as the beer warms.  Surprisingly easy to drink, I could get used to this. Just dry enough to keep me coming back for more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A: Amber-orange with a golden hue around the top edge of the glass. Lots of foamy head that does not want to say goodbye.  S: Flowers, hops, grapefruit zest and the slightest hint of vanilla.  T: Awesome IPA. First wave is a citrusy with mostly grapefuit on the front. What follows is a hoppy greatness with notes of some sort of floral taste. Slightly dry on the finish, which I like.  Drinkability: I'm getting a six pack next time. I wanted another after I had the first one.  Value: I've seen this for up to $14.00 per six pack. That's awful pricey for my blood.

Smells of very sweet citrusy hops. Two Hearted's scent and flavor match perfectly as sweet citrus hops dominate the flavor with a touch of grass in the aftertaste. Although the beer smells and tastes sweet it is not cloying. This ale has a very slick mouthfeel with good carbonation. An excellent beer that is sweet and hoppy which is easy to drink.

Quite drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bigbelcher,4.2,Color is a golden yellow with a two finger fluffy off white head that has good head retention. Decent belgian lacing. Aroma was a good amount of hops with no real malt aroma. There is citrus and some earthy hop notes. Flavor is also more hop based than malty. I thought the alcohol was a little light and I thought this would be a better West Coast Pale Ale than an IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation.

S: Smells like a standard IPA, nothing special  T: Not a fan of IPA's, but this one tastes decent. Has the IPA taste, but more of a watered down taste so it's not so hoppy.  M: Ok amount of carbonation. Good, but not amazing.  D: Again, good, but not super special. Decent.  All in all, this is a good IPA to try at least once no matter what style you like.

Taste: This beer has a VERY floral taste, almost like the Bergamot of Earl Grey tea. It borders on pushing it too far, but it just stays within the drinkability boundaries. If you don't like hops, stay away from this beer.  Mouthfeel: Pleasantly bubbly, light, refreshing.  While this beer is pleasant for one pint, I don't know that I could handle another. The flavors are very strong, and as I said, bordering on pushing it too far. It may be too much for someone who is not a hops-lover.

Aroma is dominated by citrus (lemon and orange notes) as well as pine, with a slight caramel aroma underneath it. Taste features a prominent hop bitterness to begin, but is balanced a slight caramel sweetness and a short finish.

Very floral and  Mouthfeel: Carbonation peters out quickly (but might be a result of the minikeg incident) otherwise, its crisp, clean, and a solid mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Not very drinkable.

Hoppy smell is present, and the citrus is very nice. As the beer warms the citrus becomes more and more prevalent, nudging the score up a slight bit. The taste is something to behold. I gave this the full 5 and i don't question that rating one bit. Grapefruit is noticeable right off the bat, and while many times you hear the term ""hop bomb"" used to describe the strong taste that we come to associate with a good IPA, this is more of a ""hop delivery"". Every sip brings more wonderful hops taste without ever being overly strong or too bitter. A perfect taste every time, that feels just right. Great feeling, not too carbonated, and the aftertaste is almost as delicious as the taste. If i could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, this would be a serious contender. If i could only drink one IPA for the rest of my life, this would be the frontrunner by a large margin, like a Barack Obama to Al Sharpton margin",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,CMiller683,4.7,"First off, I have to say, Bell's makes some great stuff. And I don't say that just because I'm a Michigan native. I dig the label, especially the Hemingway bit on the back. Nice touch. Would be nice if a freshness date was listed, however.  A - Pours a nice, golden hue with a thick, frothy white head. Has excellent cling, with literal sheets of foam the length of the glass. You can see the carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass, and the only downside is this beer is just as carbonated as it looks. Not nearly enough to discourage me, but you notice its there.  S - Extremely aromatic, and I love it. Absolutely fruity, filled with citrus. Grapefruit for sure. Just as much hoppiness to it as well. An excellent balance and an extremely exciting IPA. As you drink it down, you get a little more spice and herbal that really comes though. Great complexity.  T - Does not disappoint. Very slightly overcarbonated, but not bad at all. Grapefruit and citrus, as well as the hoppy bitterness. Hints of pine in the aftertaste. After having a few sips, you begin to get some biscuity undertones, especially in the aftertaste.  M - A bit chewy aftertaste, as with any IPA. Definite tastes of pine, malt, biscuit. The bitterness hangs around, but is pleasant. An amazing balance. It's beyond me how Todd can give this beer a mere 'C'! Bah!  D - VERY drinkable. A good ABV that lets you drink all night long. Not harsh, but the carbonation sure gives you a belch or two. A very complex and self-complimenting beer. Hands down a favorite, whatever the style of beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Mouthfeel: Quite a full-bodied IPA, at least from what I've tasted...full and smooth...a little more carbonated than I would prefer, but the carbonation tapers off considerably by the end of a glass  Drinkability: A pretty good IPA. Balance seemed to be more well maintained when it was colder-hops sort of fall flat as it warms up and its overall a bit less interesting.

Taste- In the interest of full disclosure I feel obligated to reveal that I'm not a huge IPA drinker. However this is clearly geared towards that audience. It's got a strong citrus-pine hop flavor throughout with an overpowering bitterness. This beer grew on me and I liked it much better the second night I had one. Not a bad beer but I wouldn't give it to my girlfriend to try.  Mouthfeel- Medium bodied and decent carbonation although the finish is a bit sticky and lingers longer than I'd like it to.

Lots of grapefruit, citrus hops, with a decent addition of malt. At the end of the drink their is some bitterness. Mouthfeel is slick and oily. Carbonation is perfect. Goes down well.

Mouthfeel: It's a bit sticky with a medium body. Great crisp finish.  Drinkability: Like I just mentioned the crisp finish and lingering bitterness just has me wanting more. I'm shocked at how fast I just finished my glass. ABV is low enough for this to be very session able.  Overall this seems to be a very nicely balanced IPA.

Beautiful ecru head lasts forever and produces thick, intricate lacing patterns down the entire length of the glass. The aroma is very distinctive and consists of citric C-hops, strawberry jam, and a honey-like sweetness.  The flavor is amazing. Orange and strawberry initially with a light toasty malt backing and bittersweet grapefruit finish. Lingering astringent bitterness keeps you coming back.

287,1093,taylorhamrick,3.97,"My first review in a while. Here goes.  Pours a kind of pale color, still nice looking, crystal clear, until the last little bit of sediment falls in, then falls back out quickly. The head is massive, almost too big, but fits perfectly in my glass, almost an inch, maybe more, white and sticky, leaves lacing as it starts to collapse, lasts for a while. I can forgive the light color for the other nice aspects. The smell is very nice, just all centennial as far as I can smell. Flowers, resins, pollen, and a nice kick of lemon and tangerine. The malt provides a slight bready sweetness, but not sticky and bready like some. Great smell, though I might like a little more toasty malt. The taste is good, but it seems flatter on the hop front that the smell would suggest. I primarily get a light-bodies sweetness, with a strong bitterness with some slight floral, almost piney, leafiness. The fruit comes through a bit in the end, mangoes, oranges, a tiny bit of grapefruit, then it finishes with a very light, kind of sugary, though still containing some bitterness, malt body. The mouthfeel is just a bit thin. Not much breadiness, mostly some slightly sugar syrup kind of flavors. I would like a bit more. The carbonation is right on, a slight bite as it goes down. The ABV is a little higher than I'd like, though it's less apparent in the taste than I expected. Still, very enjoyable, one of the better IPAs out there, but there seems to be a bit of room for improvement.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A bold citrus flavor lingers but not in a undersireable way  M/D: Great carbonation with a sturdy body neither syrupy nor thin. Fantastic with a home made mozzarella and basil pizza.  An all around great beer. I drank this 1.23 gallon ""party keg"" of beer over five days and it never lost its carbonation.

287,1093,tegelaar,4.49,Picked it up on a beer run while in PA. I loved it when I visited Chicago.  Pours a nice golden amber color. Not much head due to my gentle pour but plenty of lacing.  Smellls hoppy and citrusy! Yumm! Tiny bit of malt smell and it just reeks of freshness.  Tastes super hoppy but you can still make out the malt backbone. Incredibly well balanced and delicious. Has almost a creamy taste to it.  Mouthfeel is light and enjoyable. Not overly carbed or syrupy.  Drinkability is dangerous as it goes down quite easy. The ABV will prevent you from over indulging too much.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Shumista,3.8,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a clear plastic cup because I am too lazy to do my dishes.  A- Pours a dark gold copper with a huge fluffy white head. S- Floral, grassy hops with a biscuity malt background. T- Very sharp grassy and floral hops, almost a bit over the top and harsh. Biscuity maltiness at the end, followed by a lingering bitterness. M- Very good, medium carbonation, coats the inside of the mouth very pleasantly. Little bit of alchohol warmth maybe? D- An extremely drinkable IPA, you could drink this all night.  While not my first choice for an IPA due to the fact that I always find the hoppiness a little harsh, this is no doubt a solid IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A-Golden copper with an absolutely lovely, thick, meringue-like, off-white head that reduced a touch and left thick, ringing lace.  S-Mangoes and tangerine with a subtle hint of sweet caramel! Whoa! This is nice!  T-Ahhh---WOW! All the hops, Oh my! The malt--mmmm! Damn, so nice. Honey covered tropical fruit compote on a fresh baked biscuit--Gees Louise this is good.  M-Medium bodied yet soft and light feeling. So smooth and creamy. LONG lingering bitterness--absolutely delicious!  D-Crazy good! This, already very good beer, is off the hizey served on cask!

287,1093,SpdKilz,4.33,"First off, thanks to kzoobrew for this great extra. Cheers!  Appearance - Poured into my SA Perfect Pint with a brilliant amber/golden hazy color. Two full fingers of incredibly fluffy, white head. It is slowly receding and leaving, honestly, some damn chunky lacing. This beer looks freaking fantastic.  Smell - A pleasant hop/citrus aroma that is not overly potent but just right. Allowing the smells to differentiate themselves I can smell a bit more floral hops, sour grapefruit citrus, pine needles, and then a hint of malt that brings it together.  Taste - Honestly, not as hoppy as I expected, which is not a bad thing. It is much more balanced. Of course up front you get the hoppy/piney taste followed immediately by a wave of citrus/floral and it finishes up strong with a bit of malty sweetness. To be perfectly honest, this is not as balanced as The Oracle. I felt that had a much more pronounced citrus and malt characteristic that made it even more balanced than this beer (though don't get me wrong - compared to many a IPA/DIPA out here in CA, there is often the very unbalanced, bitter/hoppy type beer. I have found myself gravitating toward more balanced D/IPA's as of late and this would definitely be one of them). But overall, wow. A very good beer. Midwest represent!  Mouthfeel - A medium, almost syrupy mouthfeel with light-medium carbonation. Finishes with a nice spicy, crisp finish.  Drinkability - More than I'd like to admit. I'm not sure the price for a six pack of these since I am out in California, but I could easily see me using this as a session beer...a very potent 7% session beer. A very enjoyable, balanced beer that I will be sure to pick up next time I am visiting the Midwest.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,glid02,4.45,"Cask version at Aroma's in Athens, GA.  Pours a hazy yet bright copper color with a one-finger off-white head. The head recedes into a patchy layer on top leaving thick lacing.  Smells of citrus, spruce, and pale malts, in that order. Loads of hop aroma come out and there is less of an influence from the malts than tap versions.  Tastes very good. Pale malt flavors are a bit more pronounced than the smell would intimate but soon give way to massive amounts of grapefruit and spruce hop flavors that manage to not be over the top. The ending is solidly bitter.  Mouthfeel is good. It's slick with soft carbonation.  Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more.  Overall this solidifies the fact that there is no bad way to have this beer. The cask lets the hops shine a bit more but any way you can get it this is worth a shot.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Thur123,4.12,"This beer pours a bright, somewhat pale, and hazy orange color with a nice foamy white head that sticks around a little bit, but without ever having gotten too big. The lacing appears too good so far. The smell is bittersweet and effervescent hops with a definite balance that's skews to the hop side of things. Citrus, grapefruit and herbs accounted for.  Glug glug glug  First thing that hits the tongue is just all the hops, which soon leave a very sweet and sour flavor in the aftertaste. Pineapples, all kinds of citrus and a bit of the grapefruit attack the taste buds but lay off quickly, while still leaving a hop edge. The mouth feel is a little watery but over all very carbonated and creamy. Overall a very choice and exact IPA with very little to complain about.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ChuggyMcBeer,4.33,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Batch 9304, bottled 8/17.  A: Very hazy orange with a two finger head. A tremendous amount of lacing.  S: Hop forward, but I can tell that three months of sitting on the shelf has done this some injustice. The hops give way to the malt a bit in the nose.  T: As the smell indicates, the hops have faded a little but not too much. The finish is remarkable. I usually prefer IPA's with little to no malt backbone, but the malt character here balances the hop flavor quite nicely.  M: Well carbonated and refreshing.  D: A very well balanced IPA, I can easily see myself having way too many of these in a sitting",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,SpeedwayJim,4.36,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery pint glass.  A: Pours a semi-vigorous 2.5 finger creamy, fluffy, fine white head with great retention. Brew itself is a crystal clear golden bronze, showcasing ample carbonation. Lacing is unbelievable, like a ruler on the glass.  S: Nose is strong fresh grapefruit and citrus hops. Also sweet floral esters can be faintly detected. Smell here is very pure, simple, and strong.  T: Opens bittering and citrus hops with a presence of brown sugar. These fade into a deep subdued maltiness with the hop backbone still present. Flavors fade simply and without fanfare, leaving a bitter, hoppy aftertaste.  M: Light bodied, coarse and carbonated. Mouthfeel is very clean. Finish is wet and messy and lingers a bit.  D: The perfect IPA. This one gives Sculpin a run for its money. I could and will have this again and again. One of my stand-by brews when I want something lighter and more refreshing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,hophead247,4.15,"12oz bottle courtesy of Harpreet from Perry's...  Pours a nice slightly hazy medium gold color with minimal head. The smell is what I expected from an east coast IPA...sweet grapefruity scent with a faint hop presence. A very nicely balanced IPA, but as stated above, more on the sweet malty side then a hoppier IPA. Seeing a minimal head on the beer when pored, I thought it may be under carbonated, but it was actually near perfect. A very nice job to Bell's for making this well balanced IPA that is very drinkable indeed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,superdedooperboy,4,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Goblet.  Pours a slightly hazy orangey-golden color with a thick two-and-a-half fingers of off-white froth that settles lazily, grasping at the walls of the glass as it fades, leaving behind a thick, broken blanket of lace.  Lots of bright, citrusy hop notes in the nose: grapefruit and orange in the foreground, some floral notes with some bubblegum peaking through, along with some faint fruity esters filling in the rear.  A light-to-moderate carbonation combines with a medium body to give an impression of fullness. The malt backbone is more bready than sweet, but a touch of sweetness does show through; hops fill out the palate, with sharp grapefruit and lemon zest, a bit of citrus pith. Quite bitter and dry, with some slick hop resin; things fall away into a bitter finish with some light toast, very dry and with a lingering grapefruit note.  Despite the heavy-handed hop impression, Two Hearted comes across mostly balanced, though perhaps with the scales leaning slightly toward the bitter end of the spectrum. Overall very pleasant and a well-crafted and drinkable IPA, and while the alcohol content doesn't soar, it's high enough to make itself known. Two of these would provide enough mind-numbingness and palatial devastation to hinder further quaffing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

T - Earthy hop notes dominate up front with citrus hop flavors and a caramel-like sweetness coming through in the finish. The hops are dominant, yet this is a very well-balanced beer. Absolutely delicious!!  M - Medium-bodied with a slightly wet finish. Goes down smooth and easy.  D - Very enjoyable and incredibly easy to drink!

Has excellent head retention that leaves some impressive lacing on the sides of the glass. Definitely gives off an awesome citrus hop aroma. The taste follows up with that same citrus hop punch. Nice hop flavor that is balanced very well. Has a slightly oily mouthfeel, but this doesn't take anything away from the beer. This is one of the easiest drinking IPAs that I have ever had.

287,1093,John_M,4.5,"Was very pleasantly surprised to see this on cask today at Pizza Paradiso at the Dupont Circle location.  The beer pours the expected peachy orange color with good head retention and exceptional lacing. The nose has the prototypical perfumy citrus, white pepper and spice I've come to expect with two hearted. Flavors on the palate replicate the nose, except the cask conditioning has given this beer a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. The beer has lost some of the hoppy bite you get on C02, but the creamy mouthfeel makes up for it in my opinion. Drinkability is very, very good, with the alcohol very well disguised.  Obviously, this beer is a masterpiece, but is an absolute joy to try on cask. Yumm....",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Pine and citrusy mango are foremost int the taste. Also present is a pleasant caramel maltiness.  4.5 M: Medium body. Very creamy with good carbonation.

287,1093,Hullabaloo2,4.32,"Aroma - Wonderful citrus hop nose. Fruity esters and a mild malt sweetness. Notes of honey.  Appearance - Gold color with a nice hop haze. The head poured one fingerwidth and dissipated to 1/2 fingerwidth. The head is frothy and white with good lacing. Some visible carbonation.  Taste - The taste fully supports the aroma. Inital hop bitterness and citrus flavor. The malt comes in to support the bitterness and is followed by some esters. The bitterness is present the whole way through, but is not overwhelming. There is a mild lingering bitterness. Very nice flavors.  Mouth Feel - Medium body with medium carbonation. There is a bit of a carbonic acid bite. Bitterness, but smooth.  Overall Impression - This is one of the best IPAs that I've had the pleasure of drinking. It is nicely balanced torward the hops, but does not leave behind the malt backbone like many other IPAs do.

T- This one heck of a balanced IPA. The hops blends well with the malt and the little citrus underlying. The may even be a little orange which seems to help with the citrus. M- The feel of this beer is pretty darn good. Nice and smooth, medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation. D- This may be the best IPA in the Midwest.

Tastes sweet and hoppy with floral hops, pine, malt, light spices, grass and citrus. Could be some other flavors like nutmeg mixed in, but the floral hops dominate in a nice balanced way. Very light and crisp with an overall floral hoppy taste that finishes dry and leaves a very nice hop taste.  Brew has good sticky lacing as it goes down and overall is a very good beer!

T: Big and fresh complex hop taste, well calculated malt presence with semi dry and bitter finish. Well balanced.  M: Wonderfully effervescent, yet smooth and not over-done.  D: Good choice to start the night with, great choice to have another. 7.1 % ABV is well-hidden but certainly re-introduced itself towards the end of the growler.

287,1093,JohnL9013,4.64,"I was very disappointed to see that my review had disappeared for this beer. Let me re-share:  A: Pale, hazy yellow-orange with a big, sticky head and lots of lacing.  S: For an IPA, this is an close to heaven as it gets for me. A big hop nose showing great complexity. Not a single person I've held my mug up to hasn't said, ""Whoa"" or ""Wow, that's strong.""  T: Bell's hasn't just made a strong IPA here, it's a complex IPA. The malt is laid perfectly into the background, and the hops are just full, front, and center. The complexity of hop smells leads me to believe they're using more than one species of noble hops or did something to generate such complexity in the hopiness. This is a hop-lover's dream. Just perfectly balanced, with that juicy, citrustly hop flavor and some malt to balance (this is perfect...about halfway between some of the drier and maltier IPA's I've had).  M: Superb mouthfeel that is slightly dry, not overcarbonated in the least, and smooth.  D: Very drinkable. Get me another!  As mentioned when I previously reviewed this beer, I'd say it's more of a ""1.5"" IPA... that is, somewhere between a regular IPA in strength and a DIPA. I realize ""IPA"" is a relative term with broad definitions, but on average, most IPA's I've had have had a particular smell and taste strength where this beer is far above average.  What's most above average about this beer is its taste and smell. I've had stronger, but not anything that is as full and well-rounded as this IPA. This is my standard beer right now and the only beer I've ever bought more than a six-pack of. As soon as I tasted it, I just locked right on to it and realized this was something special. You owe it to yourself to verify this! Note: You must have a fresh batch.

287,1093,apbarwood,4.38,"A bright, golden IPA with a rather large head of white foam. A good amount of head lasting throughout and eventually developing into a smattering of lace. An inviting aroma of fresh hops, particularly a bitter orange peel and grapefruit flavor. Those aromas carry through on the flavor with the addition of a nice malt body to counterbalance. There's a sugar cookie sweetness derived from the malt that's very pleasant and does wonders to soften the hops. The mouthfeel is light and bubbly with a highly refreshing finish that's dry but not abrasively. A great IPA for hopheads and novices alike. There's an unmistakable fresh hoppy quality that makes this a nearly flawless representation of an American IPA and yet I found it had a great malt balance, more so than many others of equal repute. A must try, for sure.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A fairly aggressive pour yielded a creamy, fluffy off-white two finger head that retained beautifully leaving a very nice lacing down the inside of the glass. The ale itself is a cloudy orange/amber color.  S - Mmmm, this smells like a good IPA. Grapefruit esters seem to abound with a bit of orange peel as well. Smells like this one is gonna be hoppy as hell!  T - Not as hoppy as I would have expected from the nose. It seems like this is a very citrus based beer...don't get me wrong, the hops are there and they are phenomenal, but this is certainly not ""knock your taste buds out"" hoppy. This is more of a citric hop that seems to be smoother than your average IPA. I'm really enjoying how smooth this beer is!  M & D - Smooth and creamy. Medium bodied.

287,1093,jamescain,4.2,"I've had it on tap and from a bottle. It will pour with a nice finger width of white head. The beer itself is lighter than most IPA, in color, it is a slightly hazy golden hew. It's fairly bubbly with small bubbles of carbonation attempting to escape. The head remains throughout most of the beer and leaves a small ring around the glass at the end.  One quick smell reveals a fresh floral hoppy aroma. A hint of fruitiness covered by a nice earthy piney smell.  It's not as hoppy as some IPA's I've had. There is more of a spicy character to it. There is a nice bitter dry finish thanks to the citrus hops.  It has a nice amount of carbonation that pokes the tongue while you taste. Its almost refreshing and a nice compliment to the dry bitter finish.

The taste follows as you would expect: floral hoppy goodness with some citrus notes and an excellent malt backbone with just a touch of sweetness on the back end. The hops still linger long after I've swallowed. It has a solid medium body with good carbonation.  This beer defines ""crisp and refreshing.""

287,1093,steveh,4.33,"Felt hoppy today. Considered an American IPA, goes down like an American PA. Bottled on July 20, 2009.  A -- A little hazy in its golden color with a frothy white head.  S -- Fresh piny hops balanced well with citrus and earthy characters, mild biscuit malts with warmth.  T -- Smooth biscuit malt character up front that is at once overtaken by crisp, fruity hop esters. Finishes slightly bitter, but in that way you'd expect of the style. Aftertaste of citrus fruit. Very refreshing.  M -- Mouthfeel is on the verge of syrupy, but comes across crisp, the body is light medium.  D -- Dangerously good -- takes care of the hop craving when it sneaks up.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,scottbrew4u,4.59,"A: After a hard pour, Clear amber/orange color with a pillowy off-white head. Lacing is great as this beer goes down.  S: Floral hops are abundant and fresh. Pine, citrus and some peppery notes to follow. Toasted and bready malts are in the background. The hops certainly stand out and are winning my olfactory senses over.  T: Spicy and crisp hop bite up front but not too bitter. Floral hop freshness is incredible. Almost a jasmine floral taste that blends in very well with this beer. A peppery finish to the hops. Malt is lightly toasted and semi-sweet with some honey notes.  M: Medium body, crisp carbonation and a spicy, dry finish.  D: Super drinkable IPA, so much freshness and great flavor without becoming bitter and off balanced. One of my favorite IPA's of all time! It is so refreshing and easy going and I am not a hophead either.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Genghis22,4.42,"A - Nice pale starw color. Perfectly clear, with a lucious white foamy head. Gentle lacing.  S - Concentrated notes of ripe, sweet citrus. Grapefruit and clementine, with floral, hoppy aftertones. Smells hoppy, but not bitter, very inviting.  T - Beautiful hop medley! Grassy, piney, sweet citrusy goodness all at once. Very nice. The citrus leads off, and gives way quickly to the grassy hop notes, the aftertaste is slightly bitter, but not overly so.  M - Very crisp. Medium body, with moderate to high carbonation. The carbonation is very tight, nice little bubbles. Finishes dry and leaves the tongue a bit prickled.  D - Very nice IPA. Not over the top, but complex enough to satisfy any Hop Head. This is a very well put together beer, I wish it was available in CA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,KrisPaulk77,3.27,"Poured into a Lazy Magnolia pint glass.  The beer poured a coppery orange with an eggshell colored head. There was a substantial amount of foam, and it hung around for a while. It gradually faded down to a nice sized cap of foam. Lacing is evident. The aroma is hop forward, with grapefruit and pine leading the charge. There's also a sweet, almost honey bun aroma lurking in there as well. The taste is straight up hops. I'm finding it hard to get any malt off of the taste. There is a very sharp bitterness towards the middle. The finish bites and scrapes across my tongue. The smell misleads you. I was anticipating a better display of malts, and they just aren't showing up. (There is a more noticable malt taste as the beer warms) I'm actually kind of disappointed with this beer. I was expecting more out of it. I believe I'd rather have a Torpedo or a Racer 5.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,natelocc787,4.85,"Fantastic example of the style and one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Nice big three finger head, just enough to build a modest, yet picturesque crown atop the pint glass. Nice alabaster foam to a golden orange body. Nose is very aromatic and inviting offering vanilla cake batter and fresh pineapple. The lace is thin in some spots and chunky in others, overall it is prominent and appreciated as it clings in irregular sheets to every surface it contacts. The taste is all ripe pineapple on top of vanilla ice cream, freshly ground tangerine peel and bitter, pithy, pink grapefruit. Hop presence is big, only slightly bitter and very mellow in general while still at the forefront of the beer. Citrus is well balanced with the pine and spruce notes leaving many flavor combinations up to individual interpretation. The mouthfeel is spectacular. Medium-heavy, rolls nicely on the tongue with small bubbles, a crisp carbonation and it manages to be lively on the palate while being smooth as silk concurrently. The most sessionable IPA I can remember drinking, so hoppy, smooth and flavorful-I really wish it was available in Texas.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,HitokiriNate85,4.57,"Poured from a bottle from batch 9346, bottled on Sept. 8.  A - Pours a medium orange-yellow. Pretty ample carbonation forms a thick, creamy off-white head. Leaves some streaks of lacing behind.  S - Ah, such a great aroma. Flowery, grassy, with citrus undertones. It's very perfume-y. No detectable malt, honestly.  T - The floral/grassy notes come through enormously in the taste. Finishes slightly dry with a grassy bitterness that just goes and goes. There are some really slight pale malts noticeable in the finish, but not much. The only reason not to give this a 5 is because this is basically a month old, and while still within the realm of fresh, I know it can be a bit better.  MF - The carbonation works great here. Liveliness the washes into a pretty oily feel.  D - Just great. As my hop tolerance has really grown over the last year, so has my considerations for drinkability of IPAs. There's enough dryness to keep you coming back. Also, price wise, this is the best IPA I've had for the money, though it's in a pretty small range of my other favorite IPAs. Regardless, it's in my top three IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,blackearth,4.42,"Pours a light amber body with a big, fluffy white head. Aroma is dominated by citrus and slightly piney hops scents. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Great hop presence that is on the higher side of medium intensity. Just the right amount for an American Pale. Hop flavors come through from start to finish, but the malt backbone is present. Overall great drinkability.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

On tap, at Crunchys Bar in East Lansing, as I type this.  A- Ruby-hazed amber color, with a thin white head which leaves a nice lacing.  S- A nice, hoppy sting on the nose, accented with a pine aroma.  T- Once again, I'm tasting hops and pine, with a splash of citrus...subtle touch of malts in the mist.  Mouthfeel- Goes right down, with no hesitation. Light-medium bodied. My favorite aspect of this beer.  Drinkability- I could easily drink a six pack in an evening.

287,1093,drabmuh,4.49,"Draft at RFD, 16 ounces served in 16 ounce glass. Yellow, slightly couldy, minimal white head, low carbonation. Amazing aroma. Citrus / pine, not overly piney. Cascade / amarillo aroma, very inviting. The beer screams, drink me! This is the type of beer that reminds me I'm a hop head. Sweet full bodied nice bitterness. Not overwhelming, but characteristics of great hop flavor. Drinkability high, A truly well formed beer. A slight aftertaste, some bitterness on the back end hold son. not strong. A reasonable amount of lingering flavor. This is one of my favorite IPAs in the country.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,cudmud,4.5,"This is just a pretty beer. Almost perfect. This beer has a nice golden color, with a wonderful stream of bubbles. It has a nice bright,white head and good lacing.  The smell is out of this world. It has a ton of aromatic hops. Behind the hops, there is a moderate hint of malt.  The taste is mostly hops, which I like. However, I don't detect much more than hops.  The brew feels good in my mouth. However, the drinkability is just short of good. I love this beer; however, I don't think I can drink more than one a night.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,drewd,4.4,"Pint on-tap at new venue ""The Bishop"" in Bloomington (used to be the Cinemat; now live music w/ reasonably priced pints & nice booths to boot).  Pour is a nice copper/orange, as usual, with a bit of head...half-finger or so. Nose is mostly pine, but with a definite citrus in there as well. Pine is the first thing you get upon tasting, strong enough to separate the men from the boys. Gradually the citrus aftertaste hits, so that what at first seems hoppy & biting loses some of its edge, in a good way. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated, tart but smooth. Improves even as it warms, mellows out a bit. I like this in pairs, though I wouldn't readily choose this as a session beer. Still, for the ABV, pretty drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,erz316,4.6,"12 floz bottle with 9279 on the back into old speckeld pint glass  A - good light amber colour, maybe like light tangerine or clementine. big three finger head, solid, made of medium large bubbles, with a slightly orange colour. the head retains pretty well.  S - exceptionally good nose, great citrusy hops. the nose is so incredibly bursting with the scent of the hops. the nose exudes lemon juice, pine needles, and grapefruit pith. there is not much more, but the sheer intensity and deliciousness of the nose earns it a high marking  T - a real great beer, this one earns the kudos it gets. the initial is a tamed bitterness with a big malt backing, keeping the full bitterness at bay. the hops are more piney than grapefruity, but the overall taste is of the classic hop taste, with maybe a bit of astringent bitterness at the back of the palate. the finish is really where this beer takes off: the grapefruit taste rockets up and combines with the alcohol to make a lightly burning, bitter, and dry taste that finishes a bit on the herbal side of things; the malt, however, manages to get one last kick in and takes the very end of the finish. the aftertaste is light bitterness of hops and an overall malty feeling.  MF&D - the beer perfectly drinkable, compeltely and utterly. in fact the beer is soo good that even claire, who doesnt like hops, really likes this brew. I dont know what a perfect Am. IPA should taste like, so I will curb the rating a bit.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,mklinger,4.39,"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Two fingers of head. Slightly hazy deep, deep gold. Effervescent carbonation. Looks very inviting. Leaves nice lacing behind, too.  Smell is all bright citrus, grapefruit & oranges. Slight hint of malt, too. Great, great IPA aroma!  Taste is similar to the aroma with a bit more malt and a bit less assertive hop flavor than was present in the aroma.  The lively carbonation and the hint of malt richness make for a very nice mouthfeel and an easy to drink, very inviting beer. I just don't taste the 7.1% abv in here at all.

M- Very smooth, light carbonation, flavor doesn't linger or repeat- keeps your pallet clean, would be a great IPA for heavier flavored food.

All around I would have to say that this is a pretty killer brew. I am all about the hops and the Two Hearted ale does not disappoint. Though I have had some very good IPAs in my life, this beer definitely sets the bar for beers that are widely available.

Head dissipated relatively quickly.  S- Lots of citrus and floral hops  T- Up front, flavor is dominated by grapefruit with sharp, but delicious bitterness. I wouldn't quite classify the finish as a balanced malt backbone, but it definitely smoothes out towards the back of the palate. Grapefruit flavor lingers until end. As it warms, what would be called ""maltiness"" (though not very pronounced) becomes more apparent.  M- Great effervescence that beautifully compliments the citrusy, floral hop profile of the beer.  D- One of the easiest drinking IPAs out there (deceptively so).  One of my go-to IPAs and definitely worth the praise it has received. Randomly chosen out of the fridge for my first review after years of drinking craft beers.

A glowing ever so slightly hazy orange with a huge foamy white head that leaves thick layers of sticky, crusty lacing down the sides of the glass.  The nose is full of candied orange, sweet malt, tropical fruits and some hop spice.  The first gulp gives me orange candy, sweet doughy malt, slight hoppy bitterness, more tropical fruits. There's some slight oxidization and it's just slightly warm. Just what I like in a casked IPA!  Mouthfeel is slick and fast with very low carbonation(duh!).  Two Hearted is a damn fine IPA and I love casked beers so this is a match made in heaven for me.

Very nice hazy golden body with a big, fluffy white head that laces incredibly. Smells hugely of citrus. Grapefruit galore and pine, with a tiny bit of pot thrown in for good measure. Slightly sweet, biscuity malt, which detracts from it a bit. Initial malty-sweet taste, though with a general citric hoppiness. Grapefruit and orange juice with some pine resin. Bitter, but not overly so. This seemed too malty up-front, but the dry finish keeps it pleasant and refreshing, in the end. Medium-full body with plenty of carbonation. A nice ale, but not the magnificent creation it's cracked up to be. Ironically, the Hemingway story wasn't great either; guess I'm a bit picky as a Hem fan though.

Very citrusy followed by a definite piney lingering hop presence, some malty sweetness definitely there but in the back seat. Very close to what i was expecting after smelling the brew. Mouthfeel was fantastic between the hoppiness and the carbonation that followed the initial taste of the brew. Not too thick or oily at all. ABV was very will hidden in this.

Loads of citrus hop aroma, sweet tropical fruits, and not much malt--very nice.  T: The taste is very similar to the aroma. A great grapefruit and orange flavor, along with sweet pineapple. The finish is nice and piney, giving a bitterness to balance out the fruit.  M: The beer is medium bodied and has moderate carbonation.  D: I can see why people go nuts over this beer.

A few lethargic bubbles are at work beneath the large dingy white cap. Lacing is monumental with sheets coating the upper rim and thinning out as the sips continue. A soft white film resides on top as the head melted away somewhat quickly  S: smells boast centennial hops with a big flowery presence, maybe a shot of cascade smells? Smells of grapefruits and lemons come to my mind. What is most flattering is the presence and impact of the hops, so bright and crisp in the nose. This category is getting a sure-fire 5!  T: superb hops. What is even more impressive is the soft buttery pale malt character that augments the bright, flowery, candied fruit notes (grapefruits and oranges). Another notable hop flavor is the piney blue spruce notes. Otherwise, this is a harmonized hop brew with magnificent balance. As it warms it gains a soft spiced character that is to die for. The interplay between the hops and pale malt is banging with the hops having the edge and yet under control...the best beers are the hardest to describe sometimes...  M: I must say, the body is on the lighter side, which is okay. It is very nice for the style and has reasonable carbonation. The body is smooth and very agreeable.

It does go up a few notches in feel, drinkability and freshness, most all else remains the same.)  Presentation: Draft serving at a regular pit-stop somewhere in Washington DC. Bells Two Hearted tap marker presentation. The menu offers a short but fairly accurate and attractive description of the brew. Served in a bells tulip pint glass.  A - Nice amber color. Starts with a large head that dissipates leaving a sturdy ring on the beer and some traces on the surface. Great showy lacing as it goes down.  S - Very nice and recognizable hoppy and floral bouquet. A presence felt with emphasis early on but that remains strongly present throughout. Resin/pine accompany to built up the smell.  T - Distinctive and well balanced hop flavors. The bitterness ends on a rather smooth note.  M - Quite carbonated, but feeling about right for an IPA.  D - Very drinkable. Complex and with enough personality. Good to sustain a nice meal, or informal drinking session.  Notes: Still a favorite standard from Bells. But, this sure is an improvement in fresh tap form? Appearance and freshness enhance its drinkability quite a big deal. Still a reference standard when I recommend an IPA that without being overtly strong is one level above a regular version of the IPA, and it is great to initiate friends into other double, imperial, triple or hybrid IPAs, and particularly enticing on tap.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

(S)- Massive pineapple and grapefruit citrus fruits up front followed by a rather dry pine sol aroma.  (T)- Very dry up front with pineapple and grapefruit citrus. Slightly creamy in the middle with a dry biscuity finish.  (M)- Rather smooth and dry; this has tons of hop characters, but its implemented well creating mouthwatering citrus notes.

D- really good for the 7%abv. i love how after a couple the bitterness disappears completely.  Overall- this beer is one of my favorite ipa's from michigan. well this one and dark horse's crooked tree. dark horse has a nice lil malt mixture tho. i put light to medium bodied for the mouthfeel and right carbonation cuz i've noticed a nice difference between tap and bottle. the bottle i feel is alil more carbonated than i would like it to have. pretty much if you can get this on tap and you're a fan of ipa's this is a must try!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

There is some mild malt to balance, but the hop presence is somewhat out of balance and unpleasant.  M - Well carbonated medium bodied.

(bottled feb 3, 2009) tasted in late may 2009.  deep golden straw color, w tints of orangey honey. hazy (despite decanting). massive off-white head, recedes to rocky, fluffy multiple mini-meringues, and never really fades. good lacing, sometimes splotchy, and also with clumps of foam left on the side from the meringues.  aroma: citrusy and piney even on pouring. lots of fresh grapefruit zest and rind, plust actual citrus flesh fruitiness, blending w apple esters plus a mild caramelized maltiness underneath.  taste: bright fruity grapefruit and pine upfront, getting resinous towards the finish, w bold, snappy bitterness. malt is a bit thin in comparison, though still pleasant in its own right, just not exactly enough to balance fully.  medium body, with just quick moments of watery thinness. astringent resins, made more prominent with mild to moderate, tingly carbonation.  looks like this one held up okay.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,fropones,4.69,"A golden orange-ish yellow pale (duh) pour with a finger and a half of white head that went down with a lot of lacing to a thin layer on top. The smell was absolutely delicious. The best smelling beer I think I've come across. Pine and sweetness, some grapefruit, a bushel of hops. Taste was overpowering at first, but after a few sips I've come to quite enjoy it. Same tastes as the smell would suggest, with a fair amount of bitterness. Finishes dry, with a delicious taste on my tongue. Silky light-medium body that allows the beer to be drank very easily. Extremely drinkable, especially for over 7% abv.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,hardy008,4.2,"Pours a hazy gold color with a white, foamy, two finger head with a nice sticky lace. Smell is grapefruit and floral hops. Taste is much like the aroma, but some sweet malt comes through, and also some orange flavor. Medium bodied, nice carbonation, and very good drinkability. This is equally good in the bottle or on tap.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,tomspalla,4.25,A wonderful IPA. Very representative of the American style. Hoppy but not overly bitter with a nice floral aroma. It opens up with warmth and pairs well with spicy dishes. I highly recommend picking this beer up if you can. The hops will keep it fresh for a long time but this beer sure goes down well on a hot day.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,ThatWineGuy,4.37,"Batch 9110, packaged April 27, 2009 (about four months ago) and purchased at Merchants in Dearborn MI in early July. Pours slightly murky honey-gold with a two finger dense and foamy beige head, sheet lace and good retention. Not much visible carbonation. Nose is very impressive with floral notes and a strong candy floss sweet aroma that's really quite delightful.  First taste impression was of alcohol with a barley-wine style caramel sweetness, layered and smooth with nice balance and low acidity. Very, very smooth texture and tasty. Dry aftertaste with slight astringency in the finish suggestive of brazil nut. If the alcohol had not been so much in evidence, I'd have scored it higher on drinkability. Overall, a very nice IPA that drinks more like a DIPA or a barley wine IMHO; I'd like to try this a bit fresher next time around. Certainly worth the accolades it has garnered on this site.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BBThunderbolt,3.5,"Received after a friends visit home. Thank you, Mara.  Poured into straight pint glass. Poured a hazy, cloudy orangeish-yellow with just over an inch of white head that dissipated quickly, leaving a medium amount of lacing.  A very nice piney hop aroma greets the nose, with a hint of citrus mixed in. The flavors are very similar to the aromas, lots of pine and citrus, little malt, just amplified.  The body was typical for the style, not light or full. Drinkability was a little better than average since this is not a tastebud burner of an IPA. As with the other 2 Bells brews I received, if this were locally available to me I would drink it in my regular rotation.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jdklks,4.49,"appearance is nothing special. looks more like a pils, lager, or a golden ale than an ipa. light gold/yellow all the way through with a puffy white head that has good retention and laces the glass nicely. smells of citrusy hops, lots of hops. fruity sweet.  a great mixture of sweet fruitiness and bitter hops. both the sweet and the bitter complement the other throughout. strawberry and apricot up front, with a nice orange flavor through the middle that gives way to a hoppy, grapefruit bitterness. this is the way ipas are supposed to taste. absolutely delicious.  mouthfeel is good. medium-bodied, and carbonated well. drinkability is through the roof, of course, especially at this time in the summer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,beerorRIP,4.42,"i'd had it before, but here we are again for a review- poured from a bottle to a clear pint glass: yields a finger and a half of fluffy white head. the body is a slightly hazy light orange - yellow. leaves a nice layer of lace on the backside of the glass.  smells really nice and hoppy. big blast of citrus dry hops! i can catch some sweetness in there as well from the malt but not too much.  obviously there's a nice nice hop flavor in there. like the aroma - big and citrusy. the hop bitterness is not nearly as big as the flavor. there's a malt backbone to keep it together, and it is fairly dry. but the focus is the hops.  the carbonation is good, feels like a medium body. slight creamy texture, not prickling on the tongue.  the abv is nicely hidden. goes down easy and i'd like to get more of it when possible.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jlindros,4.5,"Thanks again to portia99 for this tasty beverage. Poured from bottle to Corsendonk tulip glass.  A: Golden yellow orange color with a little clarity, huuuuge head and shows no signs of fading as lots of carbonation is shooting up the edges of the glass  N: Some light malts, touch of vanilla, a floral hop aroma with light citrus and candy hops, but not a huge hop nose bite, slight brown sugar  T: Starts with a nice malty bread like base, creamy and rich, light toastiness, more floral hops shine through in the middle, light but still bitter, a touch of vanilla and sweet candy like taste round it off very well (I think this comes right from the malts), a slight juicy hop center adds a touch of pine and citrus, touch of spicy hop flavor, slight alcohol but barely, very slight fruit as well. It finishes semi dry with a great hop kick, the bitter hops hit pretty well at the end. The hops fade over time but have a great long lasting kick. A touch more sweet malts and floral hops also.  M: Semi creamy and lots of carbonation, semi think as well  Overall: This is almost perfect for an IPA. It starts with light hops and great malt backbone, finishes with a great bitter hop bite, a touch of pine and citrus as well as alcohol, some sweet candy malts and vanilla taste round it off well. Reminds me a lot of Burton Baton with a touch less malt, oak, alcohol, and bitter hops making it more drinkable but less oak and vanilla to round it off.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MrIncognito,3.95,"A - Pours a slightly hazy orangy-yellow with a fluffy white head.  S - Nice citrus hops with a whiff of sweet alcohol. Orange dominates the nose but not in an overpowering way.  T&M - Hops right up front that smack the tongue with a citrusy bitterness. Not overly orange-flavored like some IPA's, a nice balance of bitterness and sweetness. Livelier carbonation than expected that keeps the mouthfeel lighter but doesn't dry it out. Hoppy aftertaste that lingers with orange zest.  D - I could drink many, but the ABV prevents it. Sips nicely and I think I drank this way too fast. Crips and refreshing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,photomike,4.28,"Pours a lightly-hazed golden yellow with a big, thick, billowy white head. Above average retention and stellar thick lacing all the way down the glass. About as good looking as an IPA gets.  Smell is nice as well--really nice floral hops and pine needles and not much else.  Flavor continues to impress. Floral and citrus rind hop flavors with some mild honey-orange sweetness and big time biscuity malts. Lingering bitterness and a dry finish.  Medium-bodied and lightly carbonated with a crisp, dry, very bitter finish. Really refreshing.  Were it available in my area, I'd love to kick back a couple of these in the sun. Worthy of its strong reputation.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mdmako,4.5,"A - An amber color with a light cream color head of about two inches that retains nicely. A great amount of lacing. Looks like a perfect ale.  S - Vibrant floral hops and fruity flavors are very strong but they are backed up slightly by the sweet malty aroma. Definately an excellent blend of hops that is not too overpowering.  T - Slightly sweet initially but a bitter mid and smooth creamy finish. There is a very slight grainy taste present initally along with the sweetness but the hops takes control very quickly.  M - A medium bodied feel but a very smooth creamy finish. Not too bubbly, not too flat. What I would consider an excellent mouthfeel that makes you feel like your drinking a very good beer.  D - One of my favorite IPAs that I could drink over and over again. Not too overpowering but still has as much flavor as my heart desires.

287,1093,drtth,4.38,"Chilled and poured into a Duvel glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: The beer pours out a dark golden/orange color with a 2"" frothy white head that recedes slowly leaving lacing on the sides of the glass. It eventually settles into a nice ring of foam with a thick patch of foam in the middle. Initially sipping leave sheets and leggy lacing patterns of lacing on both sides of the glass. Towards the end of the beer the lacing is more speckled but it persists to the end.  Smell: The aroma has a nice floral citrus character with a hint of pine mixed in and backed up by a sweet malt background.  Taste: The flavor is definitely that of floral citrus hops (primarily grapefruit) with some fruity bitterness popping in and out as it rides on the back of the almost fruity sweet malt background that keeps everything organized and integrated.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium-bodied, smooth and creamy, with moderate but continuous carbonation. The finish is long and smooth with citrus and pine bitterness fading to dryness and taking its own good time to do so and leaving one wanting more.  Drinkability: This is definitely a top notch IPA. It is very nice to drink and one of my favorites. It shows an excellent balance between hops with malt backbone keeping things smooth and easily sippable. This is clearly a beer to seek out again and again and again....",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,washburnkid,4.63,"I am quite literally addicted to this beer.  A: Three fingers barely off-white head over a somewhat hazed golden. Fluffy retention and sticky lacing all over the glass. S: Aromas are citrusy goodness. Mandarins and grapefruits, with caramel malt all the way in the back and barely discernible. I know I am going to love the taste of this beer. T: Great citrus hops up front, and lingering in the back. There's a dark fruitiness that is also pleasant. There is a faint bready malt, which only tones the hops down in a minor way. They're really there to balance. Tons of florals. I just might die...this is exactly what I crave in an IPA! M and D: Crisp carbonation and a smooth, medium body make this such a drinkable IPA, especially for this Ohio humidity that I am having to get used to. I can drink this stuff all day, and I just might go do that now...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,AgentZero,4.25,"A - Nice, cloudy, golden-orange color with a two finger foamy head. SLowy dissipating, decent lacing. Pretty attractive beer.  S - Three feet away from the pour and this one hits my nose. First thing I smell is sweet, then a nice citrisy hops. Flowers, orange, and caramel make for a nice mix.  T - I am surprised at how much I like this. I definately taste orange, but it's orange flavor, not orange citris. The citris is there though, nice hoppy taste, and I catch the sweet, subtle carmel coming over the orange taste. Unbelievable distinction in this. Stays for a long second, than the bitter aftertaste comes in briefly as the beer leaves your mouth. Very impressed.  M - A little watery, light bodied, carbination helps to give it enough kick to balance out how light this is.  D - Easily drinkable, even for a something that has some bitter in it. Would love to have more of these.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,woosterbill,4.45,"My first review, so here goes nothing.  12 oz bottle poured into a tulip. A: A moderately vigorous pour produces a white one-inch head atop an orange-gold body. Solid retention and lots of fine lace. Halfway through, a swirl of the tulip brings back a 3/4 inch head that never fully goes away. Fairly light for an IPA, but definitely not outside of style. Good-looking beer. S: Hops predominate, with the major notes being citric (especially orange) and floral. A little grassy. A surprisingly sweet, caramel malt undertone backs up the hops. T: Largely an extension of the nose, the orange hops take center stage. Surprisingly enough the caramel malts are nowhere to be found, drowned out by the bitterness of the hops - the hops are delicious, though, so I'm not complaining. The hops carry through to the bone dry finish, and are joined by just a hint of alcohol. M: Medium-bodied and quite smooth for the generous amount of carbonation - just what I want from an IPA. D: The clean, bitter finish leaves me itching for another sip, and I could happily drink several of these in a row. Almost scarily drinkable for an IPA over 7%. Notes: This bottle was the next to last one from a case I bought when I visited the brewery back in June. While still delicious, I definitely would have rated the beer slightly higher for both smell and taste back when it was fresh. The first few I cracked were unbelievably alive with citrus, and were simply unforgettable. A great IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S- not all that aromatic like an AIPA should be, but who cares. T- this is the part that keeps you coming back! Great balance between the malts and the hops. Not a super sweet flavor or super hoppy flavor. M- As mentioned, there is not an over malty or over hoppiness. Meaning, very smooth in my book.

It poured with a finger head which didn't last too long.  S - The floral hop smell that this beer emits is phenomenal. I clearly pick up some citrus as well as a little pine. No malt or yeast characteristic smells can be detected.  T - WOW. The hops hit out front. They taste very much as they smell. I receive the hop bitterness on the mid palette. It finished very smoothly for a big beer.  M - Just right for this particular style of beer.  D - This is a big beer. I probably couldn't drink too many of these but it's hard to tell that it is 7.1%  Overall, this is a very outstanding beer and is one of my favorite IPAs thus far.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Nice floral aroma of grapefruit, pineapple and some lighter notes of pine in the back.  Lots of hops evident in the taste but not completely overdone. Grapefruit, pineapple and some lemon all come out along with a piney finish. There is a little malt evident as well making this IPA a little more balanced. Overall very much on the hoppy side but not so much that it is a complete hop bomb.  Medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation.

A 6pack of 12oz bottles from Discount Liquor in Milwaukee, WI set me back $9.49 this time. I pour into a standard pint glass to review.  Massive head that is slightly off white, very light and pillowey. Slightly cloudy golden yellow color with many rising carbonation bubbles.  Such a pleasant floral hop bouquet on this single IPA. There is the grapefruit and pine in the background, which comes more to the forefront as it warms.  Taste is also quite floral with citrus grapefruit tones showing face as well.  Medium body. Perfectly carbonated. A touch of oil from the hops. Lasting finish of pleasant floral hops. Superb drinkability.

287,1093,rpstevens,3.87,"Big thanks to both d0b and beerlovingrl for multiple bottles of this fine IPA from two different trades.  The beer pours a hazy amber/orange with a thin soapy white head that leaves minimal lacing.  The smell is all grapefruit, orange and zesty lemon peel (even for a bottle that was kind of forgotten in the back of the fridge). There is a slight malty sweetness in the background, but you get mostly hops.  The taste is slightly more fresh cut grass than the citrus and lemon of the smell, but definitely all bitter hops with very little malt to balance it out.  The beer is superdrinkable. The alcohol is barely present, the carbonation is spot on for the style and the hops aren't overpowering but they are the dominant feature.

One finger of foamy white head that dissipates to a thin layer. Good lacing down the glass  The nose consists of a huge citrus hop aroma. Strong grapefruit and lemon peel. There's a slight malt in the undertone, but it's really tough to get a hold of with the hops kicking ass all over the place.  Taste falls right in line with the nose. It didn't let me down at all. Strong grapefruit hop flavor. Slight malt backbone. This beer is right up my alley with the hops.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and nicely carbonated.  This is right in line with most other IPA's. Maybe a little bit less so on the drinkabilty side, because the hop flavor is so strong that it will ruin your pallet for the rest of the night.

287,1093,claykeller,4.92,"Appearance: Nice clear dark-ish golden color. Dense half inch head with lacing all the way down.  Smell: The first thing my friends notice about this beer is the floral aroma. Someone said the other day that it smells like flowers! The floral aroma is the best I've personally ever experienced from a beer.  Taste: Good balance between the bitterness and malt with a great example the biscuit-y flavor that I love. Doesn't get much better for me. Even the flavor of the burp is good, not harsh or burning.  Mouthfeel: Fairly smooth and clear, not thick, but a solid mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Great drinkability, not so strong that you have to drink it slowly, but complex enough that you want to savor it. Pretty strong ABV, as is typical with a strong IPA, but a couple of these go down great with friends and meal.  Notes: This is currently my favorite beer. Looking to find some like it that have the floral aroma and balance that this beer has. So far I haven't found any.

The flavor is a nice biscuity yeasty malt backbone bathed in a big citrusy dose of hops. Fairly long and bitter finish. Unique flavor profile amongst IPA's. Definately satisfies the craving for a hoppy beer. I will say that this beer can be inconsisten. For every perfect fresh bottle I have had, there has been another that lost a lot of flavor, or a cask conditioned pint that was past it's prime.

There's also a lovely floral boquet that wafts up to my nose. The first sip is a punch inthe mouth. It tastes like the most floral christmas tree I've ever smelled. In a good way. So tart and bitter it makes me pucker. I love it. The feel seems very sticky and dry. It just sort of sets up shop in my mouth and stays there. I am really starting to appreciate hops.

Citrus, some orange possibly blood orange along with grapefruit. Orange, and grapefruit with a malt finish with a taste that I cant identify yet but is also present in Alpha King. Full body very nice for an IPA. Great beer I would love to have more often, unfortunately I had to go to florida to get it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Lolli1315,4.27,"A- A hazy orange color. Unfortunately, it was poured for me at a bar and there was not much of a head. I have had one of these before so I am guessing it was the pour.  S- The most abundant smell is citric. Hop aroma also comes through much more than any malt.  T- The citric flavor comes through just like in the aroma. There is a finish of bitterness that is evident, but certainly not overly bitter. Finishes dry and refreshing.  M- Medium or moderate body.  D- Very easy to drink these and with a 7.10% ABV, one could find his or herself in trouble.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BuffaloTapHugger,4.22,"A: Hazy dark orange in appearance with a nice noticeable white head and great lacing.  S: Florals are top notch, star of the show they are. Piney hops and fruity aromatics of grapefruit and tangerine zest.  T: Bitter hop action in the front of pine resin that washes out clean.  M: Fuller in body, very sticky, nicely carbonated.  D: All day along if it were available near me. Great beer to session for all the hop lovers out there, and for that comes recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ocelot2500,3.85,"Pours a cloudy amber orange color with a thick white head. Plenty of lacing on the glass.  Smell is of floral hops mostly with a little citrus.  Taste is of the floral hops on a bready malt backbone. This is not particularly balanced well, but I still find it enjoyable.  Mouthfeel is smooth and fairly crisp. It ends very dry though.  This is fairly drinkable, but the dryness does seem to be getting to me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jdflyer06,4.1,"Had on tap at One Eyed Jack's in Beavercreek, Ohio. A little known Gem.  A - light golden in color. A solid head that is fluffy and light. Fairly clear with a few floaties.  S - Very floral. The smell of hops is evident off the bat. There's another aroma that is so hard to place. At the risk of sounding like its a negative, it's almost like new car smell. But I like it!  M - Light and crisp. Very dry for the style with a refreshing finish. This one is neither dense nor sticky but retains some great flavor.  T - Not as complex as I would have imagined. Definitely some oily hop character and light citrus. Good malt body although I really wouldn't want to let this one warm up.  D - I could definitely drink a few of these. A pretty good session beer. A bit lighter than I'm used to for the style, but a solid offering overall.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bgreg3,4.05,"heard about this from a forum post someone was comparing it to my drink of choice alpha king , so I had to see what the hype was about.  app.- beautiful looking murky orange , with foam that sticks high for ages , just like an IPA should.  smell- Strong spices come through my nostrils and then after a big whiff I smell small citrus and of course lovely floral hops.  Taste- There is some malty sweetness to the beginning of it then I taste some odd ass spice or something that I can't quite figure out what it is. The finish is a floral hop taste not overwhelming though , my issue from giving this higher than 4 is it never balances, but still tastes amazing.  MF- About medium but it has a very wet finish even more so then alpha king and A-king is wet like pussy.  Drinkability- despite the wet finish , this is a very very drinkable IPA especially considering it's 7% ABV , wow , give me 3 more.  I still prefer my alpha king, but it's a damn close fight.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,kegger22,4.12,"Poured cloudy amber with a two finger head that stayed throughout. Aroma was orange and very nice. The taste was grapefruit without the hoppy bitterness, milder hop taste Stone's Ruination IPA. this one a definate winner, but AleSmith IPA still the gold standard in my unworthy opinion.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,alleykatking,4.52,Finally decided to review this one..  A- Poured out a semi-hazy golden copper color. This beer is a lot lighter than most IPA's I drink. Nice 2 finger off white head stays for a short bit before leaving tons of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass.  S- The nose to start off with is floral hops coming through. Almost right away though you get a strong aroma of citrus hops knocked in with some bitter piney hops as well. Light tones of bready malts with this to finish it up with the aroma.  T- I got a nice bitter hop taste right off the get go forming into a citrus taste. The bready malts were a little sweet but balanced out the bitterness which if not for the sweetness would have ruined this beer. Nice crisp semi-bitter hop finish on the tail end of this beer.  M- Light mouthfeel. This beer as always has perfect carbonation. The beer itself comes and goes in a heartbeat across the palate but leaves a nice hoppy taste in your mouth. Oily resin from the hops is left on the tounge.  D- This beer you can not just have one of. Everytime I go out and see it on tap I smile and order one. Then it usually turns into a couple more. Great IPA and great company.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ericbeer,4.35,"I agree with VikeMan fully. I also am NO expert on IPA's, but I will tell you that I can appreciate a great one. I bought a bottle of this, and poured it into a 22 oz. glass. Slightly foggy, golden yellow in color. Very drinkable, but like any IPA, there is limit. I would definitely buy this again. I paid $5 for the bottle; well worth it!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,biegaman,4.57,"Aztec gold with an almost polka dot pattern imprinted by super-fine remnants of suspended yeast. It is brimming, the kind of glimmering brightness that causes me to look up, half expecting to see someone casting a spotlight on it from above. Its head defects in some places but is, generally speaking, thorough and full-bodied. Also, it leaves charming blood splatter like patterns of spotty lacing.  Never mind following the heart - follow your nose! You want super-citrusy fruity hoppiness? We got it. You want sticky, sappy, resiny hoppiness? We got it. The ulta-toasty, caramel-doused malt base - nice as it is - can hardly even be detected under all this hoppiness. It is an intoxicating acidic array, a tropical jungle full of citrus fruits, a rainbow of bright and vibrant colours. It will induce the hop-head into a zen-like state of nirvana.  Hop heads eat (literally, drink) your heart out! This tastes a-m-a-z-i-n-g. Zesty orange peel, candied grapefruit, grilled mango squirted in lemon juice, caramelized coconut, spiked pineapple puree - it is all and every ounce of flavour you can hope to find in an American IPA. The malt provides just enough biscuity caramel to keep the acidity afloat and the pungency at bay; with that help, the hops can really go to town - and they do.  Two-Hearted gets right at the heart of the matter - hops. It is the nectar of the hoppy beer gods. Hop farmers should devote a ritual involving this beer to appease the gods. Sacrifice it, sacrifice something to it, do some kind of dance, make a donation to charity in its name, pour it all over the seeds and soil - do whatever it must take to make the hop gods happy so that we can continue to rejoice in the sappy, citrusy goodness of lupullin.  This is easily one of the best IPA's - and I refuse to disclaim that as merely my own opinion. Survey 100 BA's and ask them to describe the perfect IPA. It is likely that all 100 accounts, however different in their respective portrayals, will each and every one depict, in one facet or another, the Bell's Two Hearted Ale. It is simultaneously one of the most flavourful, most aromatic, most sessionable and satisfying beers out there.  They say absence makes the heart grow fonder. That must be true; the occasions I get to have this beer are few and far between but each time I come back to it, I seem to love it more than the time before. Its quaffability, its quality of ingredients, the vibrant and satiating presence of so many Centennial hops - this may honestly be the best IPA in an American market that knows no shortage of great IPA's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,watkins,4.57,"poured into a pint glass  A: Pours a hazy yellow, with a slight orange tint. Rather unassuming and unintimidating.  S: Lemons, a little grass. Nice sweet hoppiness here. Good malt.  T: Citrus in the front with a great bitter in the mid-palate, finishing refreshingly and invitingly dry. Great stuff.  M: Rather light mouthfeel for the punch this beer packs, as well as the abv.  D: Yes, please. Anytime. This is definitely one of my favorite all-around beers. Reasonably priced (though still unavailable here in SC), drinkable as hell, and just damn thirst-quenching despite the strength.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,goblue3509,3.2,"Pours a golden color with a white head. The smell is of hops with some citrus maybe orange and grapefruit. The hop smell is more earthy piney hops. The taste is of piney hops but not over powering it is balanced out with some citrus notes. The mouthfeel is good, there is a good amount of carbonation to this beer. Overall the drinkability on this beer is good. It is a little weaker in the hop taste than some other IPA's this would be a good starter ipa.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MbpBugeye,4.23,"A- Dense two finger head colored perfectly white that never goes away. Exceptional head retention. Two Hearted is a clear goldenrod hue. A few notches deeper than some of the macros. Lacing hangs out for a while.  S- Spicy and bitter. Smell is pretty refreshing. Lots of oranges, grapefruit and some pineapple. A very nice take on the citrusy hops. Pretty sweet and juicy.  T- Biscuity malts lay a base underneath some crisp hops. The malts give it a smooth creamy feel/taste, then the hops interrupt with a sharp bite. Lots more of that orange, grapefruit and pineapple. This beer is really loaded with oranges. Bitterness is moderate. The finish is slightly resinous and dry.  M- Carbonation is on the low side for an IPA, thin body. Somewhat watery at times. Still quite refreshing. Alcohol is not noticeable despite this being at the high end of the ABV% spectrum for this style.  D- This is quite highly sessionable. The bitterness wont strip your enamel off and its pretty thirst quenching and crisp.  I am not a fan of IPAs but I have been picking some up, trying to get used to them.

The classic Bell's yeast flavor is in there also.  M: Excellent carbonation, medium body, very well done.  D: A pint of this goes really quick.

287,1093,cvaypai,4.59,"Poured from bottle to tumbler.  Appearance - Lighter than most IPA's more golden-orange than dark amber. Nice big frothy 2 finger head that laces very nicely.  Smell - This beer smells phenomenal, there is not a much better smelling beer in my opinion. Flowery hops abundent along with nice citrus and pine notes. A bit of sweet detected and maybe a whiff of the malts. A tiny bit of alcohol makes it just right.  Taste- Tastes like it smells, and it smells wonderful. Very floral, earthy taste, nice citrus hops. Alcohol is apparent but it fits in nicely. The malts are sitting behind here, but can be tasted and balance this beer very well. Not overly bitter, bits of honey and sweet caught.  Mouthfeel - Perfect carbonation here, just the right bite on the tongue, not overpowering here. Feels like silk.  Drinkability - Awesome drinkability, this is my go to beer. I buy it when fishing, working in the yard, etc etc. I could drink a 6-pack so easily.  One of my absolute favorite beers, there are few that top this IPA in my opinion.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Little sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Pouring it in gives the color an amber opaqueness.  Smells hoppy like an American IPA. The hop taste is not overpowering at all. Some grains also come through. A good balance here. But don't expect a lot of hops in this one. Even the bitter bite of the hops is subdued quickly in favor of malts' sweet feel. Overall a good beer, very drinkable, but like I said don't expect a lot of hops in this one.  Cheers",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

WOW  pours a slightly hazy golden glow, with a thick, billowy head. i poured the 2nd 1/2 vigorously, and it left a thick, 2"" head that was amazing. it was thick and structured, almost like light Styrofoam. It was amazing, with spotted, but thick lacing all the way through.  the aroma was a little less amazing then the taste and look, but it was still great. fruit and floral hops dominate the aroma, which is a great mix.  the taste is a great mix of floral hops, malts, and fruits. amazingly flavor, simply awesome. light feel with perfect carbonation simply amazing blend that flowed smooth and refreshing.  i cant wait until they ship this to georgia",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Leaves some lacing down the glass.  The nose on this beer is phenomenal, one that you want to sit and smell all night. Heavy floral hops mix with tangerine, oranges, some pineapple, slight pine hint - so light and breezy. All pretty sweet.  Compared to the nose the flavor is a slight let down - the hops are subdued with only a slight bitter finish - and then it hits you that this beer is ridiculously balanced. The hops are all there in abundance but the caramel and pale malt act as an equal foil. So drinkable, so balanced.

Definately heavy on the pine in terms of taste. There is a very nice hint of sweetness in the end. The taste doesnt linger too long which is good but the mouthfeel is a little light.

The gorgeous smell was probably the Two Hearted's highest high: peachy and apricot-y floral hops that are downright memorable. Tastewise, less bitter than many in the style, slightly fruity, with enough flavor on both the hop and malt ends to go around. My otherwise bitter- and IPA-hating friends enjoyed this a lot, actually, but don't take that to mean that it's not definitely an IPA - it's just that well balanced. It was a bit heavier-bodied and creamy than I'd expected I suppose but that was, again, definitely working in the beer's favor, and I can say the drinkability should at this point be a foregone positive. A really excellent IPA.

287,1093,thirdeye11,4.08,"Presentation: Poured from 12oz brown bottle, labeled batch 8888 (brewed December 11, 2008) and sampled on June 9, 2009. Probably past its prime for sure.  A: Pours a beautiful slightly opaque rusty orange color, nice 1 finger head that sticks around a decent while, lacing on the glass is about as good as they come.  S: Smells like caramel malt fading on the back side, some floral hops that have most definitely faded over time. Pretty simple here, nothing too complex but nice.  T: Taste follows the smell, but more hoppy than I expected after 6 months of time on it. It still has a decent amount of bitter that doesn't linger which for me personally is nice. Reminiscent of an American Barleywine, sweet and malty, bitter hops, and some citrus qualities too. Some bitter tangerine peel or oils.  M: Really quite awesome. Creamy, perfectly carbonated, body is just right, but could use just a touch more oiliness and it would be absolutely perfect.  D: I really like this one. I don't think I would rate it as high if it didn't have the age on it (due to potentially having a lot more bitter qualities) but I'm rating the sample I have.  Highly recommended for someone trying to get into hops, or if you like barleywines then an aged sample of this (meaning more than 3-4 months) and you'll absolutely love it. I certainly do!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mwa423,4.6,"A - Pours a dead on golden color (what I imagine stacks of gold bullion look like in the right light)  S - Very citrusy and hoppy smell with a hit of fruit or spice.  T - Plenty of hops and a different type of hop on the beginning and end of the tongue. Fantastic taste and bit.  M - Lightly bites the tongue making the mouth want more.  D - The taste is fantastic, the aroma is wonderful, the alcohol isn't noticeable.

T: ""Wow, what an IPA"" was my first thought. Hoppy, floral, citrus, grapefruit, orange, pine, not too bitter. A very well rounded beer. M: Smooth, kind of thick. D: Such a good IPA, and it's so well rounded. I could drink this all night.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Smell: A little fruity smell with a hoppy background.  Taste: Has a very nice sweet start with a good bitter aftertaste. I could taste a little fruit at the beginning but I couldn't place it. Maybe blueberry?  Mouthfeel: Pretty thin with a little bit of carbonated character.  Drinkability: Very good ale that I will definately be drinking again.  This is a really good beer that has a lot of flavor. Personally, I would prefer this in the fall than in the summer, but that's just me.

Luckily for me I ended up in Minneapolis to go to a few Six games and my buddy had some Two Hearted in his fridge. Not a bad way to start the day at 11am.  This is a solid IPA, perhaps one of the most distinct, without venturing into imperial territory. It was crisp and had a malty bite.  The nice thing about Minneapolis was I was able to try a number of Bell's beers (among others), the bad thing was I couldn't figure out how to smuggle some into my luggage for the trip home.

287,1093,wnh,4.92,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. I had a sixer of this about a year ago and am just now revisiting it.  Pours a clear, orange-tinted copper with two fingers of sticky, creamy, long-living head. When the head finally diminishes it leaves in its wake a thick, creamy layer across the surface.  The nose is, in a word, delicious. There's a fantastic interplay of freshly zested orange and floral hops that just invites me to keep sniffing, almost to the exclusion of consumption. Sweet on the whole, but tempered by the slight earthiness of the floral aromas.  The flavor follows the nose, almost exactly. Floral hops smack my tongue, fading into something reminiscent of fresh-squeezed orange juice. A subtle biscuit-like maltiness underneath provides a strong canvas for the hops to do their thing; malt holds the hops up rather than getting in their way. The fresh-squeezed orange juice notes trick my brain into thinking that the bitterness could be a product of the hops or the result of the orange pulp in the glass. Mild bitterness on the tail end, with a short, quick finish.  Medium bodied, with a good bit of stickiness that manages to come across as refreshing rather than thick. Easy drinking; I'm sorry the beer is gone already.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,grayburn,4.23,"Ahhhh, the long-awaited Two Hearted....she pours a light copper color with an overly aggressive head that I fell in love with.  The smell and taste are both full of hoppiness, very well rounded between bittering, flavor, and aroma. I am very impressed with the blend of hops on the tongue. Strong citrus with a light mint. Perfect malt back.  The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with just enough carbonation to carry things down. Excellent lingering hoppiness all around. Nice and enjoyable to drink. I like it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,drums4matt,4.62,"I was so happy to start seeing some Bell's start to show up on shelves around the Raleigh area. Of Bell's offerings this is perhaps my favorite. I picked up a sixer from a well-supplied convenience store; it was on the shelf under some (what I consider to be) strong competition but the Two-Hearted's price point and cravings for this particular mess of hops lead me to Bell's. I do not regret my choice.  As this ale poured from the bottle the smell of citrusy hop oil poured out with it. Immediately alive in the Scaldis tulip, a nice, white, part creamy part bubbly, two finger cap formed on top of golden beer with straw-yellow highlights. I had to stop the pour to allow room for the last few ounces which added some swirly yeast sediments to color the body of this brew - just beautiful! As the initial head receded, copious stickage ensued leaving a wide, thick ring of dense lace.  Wow. Where some brewers strike a note with the noses of their beers Bell's struck a chord with this one. It's citrus-like grapefruit and floral (think spring bouquet not rose or honeysuckle) with hints of maybe some berries? Blueberry is the one that comes to mind. This all blends so perfectly with the subtle malt tones that are just grainy enough to add to the spring-like quality as well. There is just a spice of phenol.  The taste, in fact, comes off grainier than expected. Now, let us not confuse such a statement with the simple fact that this beer is hoppy. Period. But there is almost a sense of surprise at how a balance has been struck between hop and grain after experiencing such a significant aroma (Note well: The balance is tipped WAY in favor of hops but there is balance nonetheless). There is an immediate astringency followed by the opening of the hop profile; pine resinous with sweet and sour citrus flavor. The grain tones sneak in as the initial acidity fades a bit and allows for some combination of flavor - this is perhaps when the berry-like fruit qualities of hop, grain, and alcohol tend to complement and play off of one another. It's the embodied flavor of the American IPA; hop palate destruction with just enough balance to make one go ""Oooo"" in some silly fashion - well done!  Mouthfeel is astringent. NO way around it - this is not for the faint of hops! Beyond the acidity it is quite bubbly and not syrupy like some really heavy IPA's but rather alive on the palate in its medium body...matty likey!  I feel as though I could drink this beer all day and not get sick of it. In spite of (and in some sense BECAUSE of) some palate-drying hoppiness and a non-sessionable ABV this beer is just so damn DRINKABLE. Cheers, Bell's - this should have us on our collective ass soon enough.  An interesting point of note; the burp is quite pleasant and tastes like what I'd expect the hop profile alone to taste like separate from the other beer characteristics. Floral and vegetal!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,sopernicus,4.37,"Oh, this one has been reviewed so many times. As such and even so, this is my contribution to the Two Hearted Ale experience. I'm enjoying this one now...late on a Sunday night, after a great Chicago weekend (even if I went to the Cubs game tonight and they lost). I won't pretend I'm breaking new ground. And with that said, here's the review:  A: gorgeous golden straw color. Finger's worth of bubbly white head. Look at the lacing! Very pretty beer.  S: and oh what a smell. Some citrus on the nose...but more, pineapple (which is very nice).  T: there isn't much new to say here. This is a tasty beer. The bitter and citrus are present, but most intriguing is the yeasty and almost wheat component on the back end of this brew. Bitter, yes. But that alone does not describe the nuances at work here.  M: this is a substantial brew sure to leave your tongue aware of its bitters. I'll call it medium bodied.  D: this beer registers a significant 7% abv; do not chug it! You'll be tempted to, but don't! This is a balanced and nuanced brew. Enjoy it as such.  I'm hoping to catch this one on tap really soon. (Though even without tasting it on tap I'm still claiming this as one of my favorite beers).  And, if you've not read it, give Hemingway's ""Big Two-Hearted River"" a read...it'll only enhance your love for this beer.

287,1093,JoshuaJ,4.47,"Had on tap at the Northside Tavern, Cincinnati, OH.  Poured a hazy golden color with a decent head and good retention. Lacing was also good all the way down.  Smelled fantastic. The grapefruit hops dominated, with a bit of piney hop aroma peaking through. Definitiely one sided on the nose, but I liked it like that.  Tasted almost exactly like it smelled. The grapefruity hops dominate, but unlike the nose, the clean biscuity hops peak through. It's not enough that I'd call it a well balanced beer, but the hops flavor is just so damn good here. So fresh and so fruity, citrusy. The mouthfeel is good. It's fairly full bodied and warms the belly on the way down.  Drinkibility is high. This is a ridiculously refreshing beer. Perfect for a beautiful spring night like tonight, on an outdoor patio at my favorite bar in town, with my favorite person in the world.

287,1093,marvin213,4.28,"It's like a Halle Berry brown, and it looks similarly delicious. Nice foamy top with staying power. Its light and translucent with a refreshing appeal. In contrast to the big ol' bubbles I've found in some feeble attempts at hop bombs, these little bubblies just sit there beckoning. If I were to pour a beer over my head after a marathon, this would be it. Though I'm a little skewed in regards to beer (I am reviewing one), this beverage looks like a real thirst quencher.  Smell bolsters the look. It's a hop flower worthy of botanical gardens. I figure Cascade, but I admit I'm an amateur. It's got an alluring citrusy component as well. It's like Pine-Sol without the chemical aspect. The beer smells real clean and pure. It's a well-crafted production.  I get the American malts more in the taste than the smell, and I reckon they provide the aformentioned tone. As I actually try to find fault with the beverage, I'd say it's a tad on the sweet side. I know it's not fair, but I compare every IPA I encounter to HopSlam. Since I'll reserve exceptional status for a beer like that, I have to decide if this is good or very good. If this were in a thread, I'd be bombarded by people telling me it's not trying to be HopSlam, and I realize that. In fact, I think it accomplishes precisely its aim: it's a citrusy sweet, well-balanced malt beverage with ample IPA hop to it. It's a very good beer.  The malts are present enough in the mouthfeel to counter any enamel pull. I don't know if I need a beer to rip my teeth from my gums or what, but I still want more dadgum hops! Great beer, great production--carbonation's right on--but I'd say the mouthfeel is only good. That's right--ONLY good.  It's really drinkable. Somewhere in this review, however, I want to fuss about the label. I'm sure it'd help to know the story of its origin, but I hate the fish and I don't really like the name. If Bud Light get drinkability credit for its marketing (and it should), then Two-Hearted gets a demerit for its. Despite the -0.5, it's a good beer to always have around, particularly right now as the summer approaches.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A-Pours a hazy yellow amber with a 1 1/4 finger off white head that reduces in half before resting. Leaves a lot of nice sticky lace.  S-Lots of citrus hits first, including grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. Sweet malt comes through as it warms, but it is by no means overly sweet. Pine aromas really come out as it sits in the glass.  T-Like the smell, the citrus notes hit upfront. There is some honey sweetness in the middle. On the finish it is a tad bit grainy and it has a nice level of bitterness that is not overpowering.  M-Medium bodied and crisp. It leaves the mouth with a nice oily coating.  D-The 7% is very well hidden and I could easily down a few of these. It is a nice change from the usual bitter WC IPAs I am used to drinking.  I found this to be another great beer from Bell's.

The smell is a very fresh balance of all kinds of wonderful hops.  It tastes just like it smells, delicious. The bitter finish is well done and leaves a near perfect aftertaste that is typical of a quality IPA.  Mouthfeel is clean, fresh, and crisp. The body is actually light, which...  Makes this an extremely drinkable IPA. In fact, one of the most drinkable I've had. The 7% abv is flat out shocking to me and can't be detected at all.

Taste: I was expecting a stronger hop presence but found the brew to have more of a balance between the malty sweetness and the bitter hops. Hops absolutely prevails with a bitter, pine flavor, but the hops are complimented very nicely with a bit of malty sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation along with the hops leaves a nice tingle on the tongue. As it sits, the carbonation lessens and becomes smoother to drink, but still keeps the hoppiness. Delicious.

T - Good bitterness on the sides and back of the mouth, malty sweetness on the middle of the tongue. Very nicely balanced - well rounded.  M - Medium body, good strong carbonation levels. Has a slippery feeling on the tongue.  D - Very well balanced beer - nothing out of place. This is a beer that I could stay with all night without changing up.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Ell,4,"Very tasty, nicely hoppy beer.  It has an exceptionally floral aftertaste. Very nice and easy to drink. The mouthfeel is light, but not too light. Good nose - again, floral and very hoppy with a bit of grapefruit.  This is a very nice and drinkable pale ale.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,sls0210,4,Served on tap in a pint glass. Light orange with inch white head that dissolves only slightly. Nice citrus tones upfront. Very creamy mouthfeel with almost a biscuit-y aftertaste. Good body. I could definitely buy a 6 pack for the house of this brew. My first try from Bells and am very pleased.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,0110x011,4,"Thanks to Younger35, as usual.  A - Pours a hazy gold. Dense, one finger head fades mildly fast, and leaves a thick sheet of lacing behind.  S - Nice piney hop character to start. Some herb and grassy notes as well. A bit of caramel and biscuity malt, but mostly hop forward. Not particularly pungent, but nice all around. They must save the million pounds of aroma hops for Hopslam.  T - Hop juice up front, with the pine and herb in the aroma, but an added tangerine sort of citrus. Added fruityness comes from the hop/malt interplay, adding a tropical flair. Some sweet tropcal floral notes come through in the middle, finishing with a solid hop bitterness.  M - Medium-light body, with nicely tight carbonation. Medium finish length, off-dry.  D - I could see polishing off a few pints of this without a problem.  It's understandable why this is so popular where it's available. It's a flavorful, hoppy, easy drinking IPA. I have my SoCal IPAs that I'll always love, so I won't be seeking this out any time soon, but this was a nice treat none the less.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ThaBobfather,4.3,Pours a mildly hazy golden/amber color with about an inch of off-white head. Smells softly of flowery hops and bitter hop with a bit of rind underneath. Taste has a fantastic hoppy bitter taste which is regulated well with citrus rind. The finish is crisp with a well bittered hop taste that lingers well. Very drinkable with the managed bitter taste.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,COBeerBuff,3.63,"Batch #9046 was packaged on March 24, 2009, and was reviewed and imbibed on May 13, 2009...  Appearance: Pours a very pretty yellowish-orange with waves of I don't know what. Gorgeous white two finger head that gives the appearance of never going down. Lots and lots of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell: Very floral hop aroma. Some notes of citrus though not quite as much as one would think with a Bells IPA. Some astringent alcohol smells as well, but otherwise, pretty darn good.  Taste: Very hoppy. Based on taste alone, I would place this in the range of DIPAs. It is a great hop taste, but it's more overpowering than many American IPAs that I've sampled. The hops strike first, followed by a very sweet lemony zest tinge, and then rounded out more hops and pine flavors.  Mouthfeel: This one feels very heavy. It's crisp and well-carbonated, but it's very sticky as the lacing suggests, and it lingers on your tongue long after your last sip.  Drinkability: This is definitely a sipping American IPA. I can't imagine having more than one or two of these in a sitting. It definitely lives up to some of its hype, but I don't think this is necessarily worth the drive to Missouri and the higher prices for 6-packs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,chaz410,4.48,"Got this from one of the best places to get a beer in charlotte nc, Duckworths on Park Rd.  Pours a golden hued light orange body. A thin sparse withe head tops it off then quickly dissappears.  Smell is great! Lots of great floral hop notes. Little bits of orange, slight honey malt as well. Hints of bitter hops and piney notes. Little caramel malt smells underneath.  Taste is exremely well balanced with floral hops with a slighly dry citris hop essecnce all over a semi-sweet caramel and slightly wheaty malt background. Extemely refreshing finish and not nearly as bitter as it could finish with the hop pressence it has.  Mouthfell is very smooth and easy to drink.  Drinkability is very accessible to anyone not completely oppossed to hops. One of the best non-Imperial IPAs on the market!!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,PhillyStyle,4.8,"Poured a deep orange that was not clear, but there was visible carbonation flowing to the top. The beer had a thick, dense big white head that was well retained. Also there were noticeable particles floating in the beer. A portion of the head was retained throughout the beer.  The aroma is a nice strong hoppy aroma with a nice floral background.  The taste is very good. Hoppy with floral and citrus notes and just the right touch of malt. Well balanced with a nice bitter aftertaste.  The beer has a medium body to it; it is smooth, rich and very drinkable. Overall, to date this is the best American IPA I have had and I am pretty sure that it will be tough to top. Exceptional beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,therivler1,3.87,"Hazy golden color, with a large and foamy head. Some of the head stayed around for the rest of the beer with moderate lacing.  Very fragrant, and I noticed the smell as soon as I started pouring.  Underwhelmed with my first sip. Can definitely taste the hops, but not overpowering. I need to remember that this is not an Imperial IPA, so for a regular IPA it is quite good. I could have a few.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bulletrain76,4,"12oz bottle. Bright orange with an oily head that leaves some nice lace. Big citrus candy aroma: grapefruit, orange peel, and some slight mango for good measure. Pure hops, with a good supporting malt sweetness that doesn't provide assertive character. Very citrusy flavor with lots of orange, light grapefruit, and a soft bitterness. Good balance, with a bitter, yet soft finish. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Very well done, though the hops are quite one-dimensional.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,KBomb,4.34,"Stopped into ""Pyscho Suzies"" last weekend in MSP to have some beers and sandwiches after some frisbee golf.  Pretty dainty head on Two-Hearted, but what's there leaves some lacing. Pale amber color. Smell is full of bright grapefruit hops balanced with doughy bread. Taste is a pleasant blend of citrus hops that dance on the tongue, pale malt for background, and a chaser of peppery hop bitterness. Very tasty stuff. Its my style; pepper and citrus without being overly bitter. Hops are balanced excellently with malt. Sharp and dry finish begs for another, but moderate weight and moderately high ABV makes me put on the breaks after a second pint.  Two-Hearted is a solid IPA. If Bell's pricetag wasn't what it is here in Chicago, this would be my go-to IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BDLbrewster,4.01,"Pours a nice pale amber with a decent, light bubbly head. Dissipates quickly leaving thin lacing, a ton of sediment prancing around inside the glass. Smell leans heavily toward citrus, with a touch of bitter earth in there. Tastes of piney hops on the back of your tongue with a little tart bite on the sides. Bitter grapefruit pith and piney hops with a shade of sweet malt to balance it out. No real alcohol burn, at 7% it's covered up well. Carbonation is on the money, and it feels refreshing in the mouth. Not a chore to suck down a sixer on a Friday night.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S: sweet & sour bitter, unique smell  T: heavenly bitter perfection. well balanced  M: good carbonation and medium body  D: a bit pricey for me. can't buy this beer all the time. However, when I do have some extra change this will be the beer im buying. SOOO GOOD!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MetalHopHead6,4,"12oz bottle poured into a shaped pint glass.  Two Hearted Ale poured a cloudy, slightly too pale amber with a creamy two-finger head that left sporadic sticky lace.  The smell and taste are also too pale; undistinguished yet easy to drink, with a touch of lemon/grapefruit that lingers a bit acidy, like the rind.  Two Hearted Ale is a good, but not great, IPA that leaves a less than pleasant after-smell and after-taste, similar to what smacks the palate after biting into an orange peel to get it started.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,dismal,4.08,Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is a hazy honey color and the pour produced a nice white frothy head which leaves plenty of lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is slightly of pine and more citrus hops. The taste is hoppy and bitter at first but goes down really nice and almost a little sweet. Really easy beer to drink and taste pretty good as well.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Jettanbass9,3.8,"had this a while back when i was first starting to get into craft... wasn't a big fan but decided it was definitely worth another shot.  A - thick, persistent head, bottle conditioned haziness, clover honey color.  S - fresh citrus zest, big floral aroma follows. light caramel, almost honey like aroma (possibly slightly oxidized?)  T - very balanced, medium bitternes - low for an AIPA. Plenty of hop flavor, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon and clementine. Slight caramel note. Very simple flavors, very one dimensional, clean but not much substance.  M - pretty straightforward, medium body, medium to low carbonation, slight but acceptable astringency. Right on for an IPA.  D - for what was said about this beer's taste, this is a very simple easy drinking IPA. from my prespective, nothing stands out about this beer, its simple and easy to kick back... there is nothing about it that would make me want to consider it a world class brew.  Good beer without a doubt, just a very simple, one dimensional brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,LauraAlberts,4.49,"Appearance: Cloudy orange with a nice frothy head.  Smell: Tangerine, lime, lemon, margherita mix - citrus notes.  Taste: Tangerine! - Almost like they picked that over grapefruit - hint of plastic, hint of grapefruit but tons of tangerine. Hint of Broccoli/Cabbage. Moreso Cabbage because broccoli can stink and it doesn't stink.  Mouthfeel: A brilliant array of flavors makes the mouthfeel a nice light to medium bodied.  Drinkability: Sipper. This double IPA is refreshing and great - but rich. Great with chocolate. I'm looking forward to getting this beer in Charleston. I've been driving outside of state lines to get it for way too long. I hear they sell it at Target in Pennsylvania. Great beer though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,SwiftyMcBeer,4.22,"Have had this treat many times, finally getting around to reviewing it. Appearance wise it looks a bit thin almost macroish. Good thing this is the low point at least for me. As soon as you smell it, you know you are in for a delicous hop-flavored treat. The taste is grapefruit predominant but not overpowering by any means. This isn't a beer that wrecks your palate, and I mean that in a good way. Not every IPA style beer needs to be a total hop bomb. This has such a clean and refreshing flavor and mouthfeel, it is probably the most drinkable IPA I've had. I could spend many an hour on a summer day with a few of these, and will.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,bsp77,4.67,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into water glass at work. Two Fridays in a row that someone brought beer in, and this time we got Bell's!  Appearance: Semi-hazy amber orange, with small head retention.  Smell: Grapefruit and pine, with some mild malt undercurrents.  Taste: Ah, the centennial hop! Mostly grapefruit bitterness, but the bitterness is not overpowering in any way. Maybe some slight lemon or orange flavors to round out the overall citrus taste. The malts are there and provide backbone, but really are not sweet at all, maybe almost slightly sour.  Feel: Medium bodied but fairly light for the style. Medium carbonation, with a bone dry finish.  Drinkability: As far as I am concerned, this is the most drinkable IPA ever brewed. It is neither too bitter as some IPAs are, nor too light so I get bored of the flavor.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,kshankar,4.4,"Appearance is orange with a thick white head. Lacing is great, retention is good.  Aroma: Floral hops, citrus hops, malt  Taste: Follows the smell. The floral and citrus come through well, but its not an excessive hop blast. There is some pine as well that comes through, and this has a good malt backing as well.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, carbonation is pretty good  Drinkability: Probably one of the best the style has to offer. Tastes great, mouthfeel is amazing..highly recommended",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Ragingbull,3.36,"Cloudy and light orange in color in a pint glass. Mild motionless prickle. The head is lightly foamy and wispy with a light lacing. Raspberry and blackberry hints in the nose. Mild hops in the nose as well. Sweet and hoppy attack which is an interesting combination and I would dare say is nicely balanced. Tartness to the flavor due to the hops character. The finish is clean but with a sour aftertaste as the mouth dries. The components of this beer are very interesting and it comes across as complex and interesting. All of those factors aside I still think it is an average beer. Fun to drink and review, but not something I will keep stocked in the basement.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Wheelinb,3.98,Had this on tap at The Stable in ST Louis.  I have had this many times both on tap in a bottle. It was one of my favorite beers. Nicely balanced and crisp.

T: Again, bright citrus and floral hops with a pretty good malt backbone.  M: Light-to-medium mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation.  D: A great night-long IPA.

287,1093,Pmazz19,4.45,"On business in WI and was very excited to try some regional brews, this did not disappoint. had this beer in a Himalayan-Indian restaurant in Madison.  A - Perfect amount of head and lacing. Nice light copper color  S - Beautiful floral aroma, nice hop scent with a mild malt backbone.  T - the hops are present and upfront but not overwhelming. My colleague who is a wine person described it as follows ""it tastes like what I should be smelling, when I close my eyes I feel as though I'm standing in a field of lavender"" A little dramatic but I think it speaks to the quality of the beer that it evoke such description from a wine snob.  M - Perfectly carbonated, a little bit of residual thickness but real nice and right in line for an IPA  D - An outstanding IPA. The alcohol was really well hidden, 7% is not crazy but I would expect it to be much more present, I'm glad it wasn't.

Nose: A very nice floral, pine and citrus aroma. Malt is there with a touch of sweetness.  Taste: A very nice citrus, floral, and pine.

287,1093,alkemy,4.5,"Pours a golden amber with a big, fluffy head. You get the pine smell up front, which is then followed by a hint of citrus. The taste is also quite similar. A taste of pine from the generous amounts of hops gives way to a slightly grapefruit aftertaste. After sampling Bell's Amber Ale, I was beginning to wonder what the fuss was about this brewery. This brew quelled those concerns. A very hoppy yet well balanced beer. ***10-01-09*** After an extended period of drinking this, I'd note that the orange has really come on in the taste. I really notice that over the grapefruit flavor lately.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Floral hop nose with notable malt presence, but not too sweet. Slightly grassy and piny hop presence with a faint grapefruit aftertaste on the taste buds with a biscuit malt mouth feel, but a very nice balance between hops and malt. While I was disappointed I wasn't able to try the much ballyhooed Hop Slam, I thought this was an extremely drinkable, nicely balanced IPA, more akin to the NW style than the in yo face hopability of SoCal IPAs. I really enjoyed this, and hope the six pack stashed in my suitcase makes it back to Oregon. My first Bell's brew, and I am very impressed. Very Highly Recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,beerman207,4.36,I've had this before but decided to finally review this amazing beer  A - The3 head of this thing is enormous - I'd say 4 fingers of head. The head also stays around a while leading to some nice lacing in the glass. The look of the beer is a cloudy amber.  S - Spice and fruit coming through in the nose  T- Spice and hops as well as some malt presence here in the taste - nice.  M- Has a bite to it but nothing too overpowering. Very nice  D - This is high. I could have a few of these,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Taste: hoppy, but reasonably balanced...spicy, sweet orange citrus, pineapple aftertaste (is a flavor here), sugary pale backdrop. Medium bodied with a soft, creamy feel. It's right on par for a good IPA, nothing more or less. Bottled 6/30/2011, drank 7/28/2011.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,cdViking,4.52,"Received in BIF from Alan (thanks man), consumed on 4/18.  Pours a wonderful amber with lovely white head that mostly evaporates after awhile. Smell is the most amazing thing, with wonderful pine hitting the front end. This is a hoppy beast, and its apparent from the first sip. Pine dominates the initial tasting but the citrus comes through a few short sips in. Wonderfully nice feeling, and while fantastic tasting, a little bitter to consume frequently.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,br3wmeister,4.5,"A- Huge bubbly white head with larger bubble around the edges that pop more quickly leaving a mound in the middle of the glass. The beer is a clear pail copper color.  S- Piny and citrus hops come through the strongest. There is a nice sweet malt backbone that brings out caramel honey and white cake aromas.  T- Nice spicy, herbal and citrusy hops make a good presence in this beer. The hops are balanced by sweet almost honey like flavors. It ends with a nice dose of hops and drys bitter aftertaste.  M- Has a nice crisp bite as it enters your mouth then a nice juicy sweetness and drys out in the end with a little bite. Very refreshing.  Overall I would have to say this is one of the most well done IPA's I have ever had. It is very drinkable yet displays the hops beautifully.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JAA,4.5,"Pours relatively light in color compared to many IPAs. Almost a true gold. Two finger head is soft as a pillow and just freely floats on top of the beer.  Smells of candied citrus, floral hops and very faintly of grass clippings.  Tastes exceptional. One of my favorite IPAs. Very prominent and clean hops. Not extremely well balanced, but good enough. A little citrus, perhaps grapefruit and lemon. Laces with the best of 'em, thats for sure.  Easy to drink. A bit tangy from the hops, but that only leaves you wanting more. Great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

At first the pine was apparent but after several drinks the citrus came out. I am not an IPA lover. I like RIS, porters, and stouts, so I am using this as an example of an excellent IPA.

287,1093,Larrytown,4.03,"Pours a murky orange with plenty of lacing. Really nice looking beer. Grapefruit hits me first in the nose along with the hops, but a little tamer than I was expecting.  Balance is the key word with this one. Oh yeah, the hops are there, but this is a well-rounded beer; a tiny bit of breadiness and a quick punch of sweetness at the end give this is nice rounded taste.

So we drank this next to a Flying Dog Doggie Style APA. This beer blew it out of the water, even though my brother liked the APA more, cause this one was ""too hoppy"" for him.  Everything was great about this beer. Taste was perfect. I am glad my brother didnt like it, so I could have it all.

The taste is really complex however. Hops do shine through, but it is balanced by malt and fruit. I get tastes of honey, honeydew melon, sweet fruit like orange and pineapple..Just a wonderful taste.  Mouthfeel: very smooth, sweet with a small bitter hoppy aftertaste  Drinkability: This is a very balanced beer and firmly has me as a Bells convert.

Also a nice floral hop presence with pine and slight hints of bubblegum. Mouth-feel is rather thin, but has some hop oiliness that coats the palate. Tastes are grapefruit, pine, and also has some floral notes from the hops. Hop bitterness is present, but well balanced by the fruity sweetness.

Let me smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood  Tastes beautifully hoppy, sweet, grapefruity, just a perfect for an IPA, it carries on it's shoulder a siamese cat, but I discovered this beer is really, where it's at.

The taste is sweet hops upfront...nothing bitter until the end...grapefruit dominates with a hint of pine and a balanced malt sweetness. Typical IPA pucker hits the end and from what ive seen my bottle might be a bit older to have lost the real hop pucker but IMO this is very good and drinkable where some say its to much.

This beer poured a perfect half inch head in my pint glass, and has a very pale orange tint. Lacing is pretty.  S - very light, faint piney smell. The weakest aspect of this beer, not much going on in the nose.  T - Starts off bitter and piney sharp, then gets citrusy, and ends with a smooth sweetness. Great flavor in this brew.  M - this beer is smooth, crisp, dry, and perfectly carbonated for an IPA. This is the beers strongest aspect by far.  D - you cannot notice the 7% of this brew. There is nothing overpowering about this near perfect IPA.  Wow, I have heard good things about this beer, but damn am I over whelmed by how the hype for this beer delivered. Excellent brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,greenjeff4141,4.13,"A: Pours a clear, light golden color with a nice four-finger head which has decent retention and lacing.  S: The smell is of spicy hops, not too heavy but apparent and the focus. The beer has a light grapey scent too along with some bread characteristics. It smells like an IPA but isn't in your face like some.  T: Taste is citrusy and winey, and a bit spicy like pepper. The alcohol is present in the mix but not strong, the hop bitterness comes into play late and lingers on the tongue. A good mild balance of all the flavors.  M: Mouthfeel is light, a tad oily but not heavy. Lots of carbonation, which gives a nice feel. The carbonation is heavier than other IPAs but gives a nice contrast to the smooth flavors.  D: Drinkability is good. I could drink a few of these, for the style of beer and the alcohol content the mix is nice and easy to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,alcstradamus,4.35,"A--Murky golden yellow, poured a little too hard but pulled back and still got 3 fingers of fluffy white head. Decent lacing and very good head retention.  S--Sweet and malty with a big blast of citrus hops. Lemon, orange, and pear.  T--Very well balanced IPA that hits most of the right notes. Enough bready maltiness to give it a small sweet kick and then good hop bitterness to wash it down. Lots of flowery notes in the hops. This might be the best American IPA I've had yet. I jumped into DIPA's first so when going back I tend to find a lack of flavor in many IPA's, but this is definitely an exception.  M--Slightly too watery, doesn't really coat the mouth like I would hope but it washes down clean with no bad lingering tastes  D--This is it here, I think this is the beer I would use to introduce someone new to IPA's. Wish this wasn't 7% because it has the flavor profile for a great session beer but with catch up quick with you if you drink it too fast.  Two Hearted Ale is definitely a world class beer. Give it a shot.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,wesbrownyeah,3.42,"Bell's Two Hearted Ale  Appearance is a funky orange fluid with a heavy carbonated head of one inch that slowly falls leaving plenty of lacing.  Smell is fresh cut hops that are also followed by a malty goodness. Alittle oil scent as well.  Taste is off balance. I taste metals, sulfer, hops and malt.. in that order... wierd. Try again... this time left alittle foam on my upper lip but still has the same taste with lingering after taste.  M-D- When it comes down to mouthfeel and drinkability i love all ipas and will forever. But for this one it leaves me wandering what went wrong. M- Not the smoothest beer and leaves mouth feeling dry and unsatisfied. D- Will have again not sure when.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,sarahspat,3.5,"Monstrous, space-hogging head. I mean, I poured firmly, but this is a little ridiculous. It looks very soft and fluffy and is off-white with an orangish tint to it. Very little lacing. The liquid is cloudy; golden, yellowy hues.  The nose contains tropical fruits and floral notes, and a little piney, peaty mustiness. I hate to say it, but there's also, a weird kind of plastic-like smell. It tastes much like it smells. There's some great hops notes going on here: pineapple, apricot, grapefruit, cotton candy. All the bitterness you would expect for an American IPA. An unwelcome metallic taste appears as it warms. Not cute. Light mouthfeel, and probably over-carbonated.  This used to be one of my favorite IPAs. However, for some reason this bottle featured a weird plastic-ness to it. I don't know if it's because my palate has changed or some other reason, but this beer is a but a shadow of my memory of it. The bad flavors are not overpowering, but enough for me to dock the taste and smell for it. Having said that, I won't dock them as much as I would if I were basing the scores on this bottle alone. Two Hearted Ale no longer deserves the position of a ""fall back"" beer. I will drink it in situations where nothing else of quality is available, but I will not seek it out on its own right anymore.  Edit: I drank two bottles (from the same batch) and they both had the weird plastic flavor. I will not raise my score on this review, even though I have had better TH's in the past. I don't know what's up with Bell's' quality control, but I think TH deserves lower scores if they are going to sell beers with a flaw this noticeable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,KickInTheChalice,4.53,"On tap in a pint glass.  Appearance: A bit lighter than an amber, the two hearted ale pours a full orange color with a rich, creamy head. Leaves slight, but noticeable lacing down the side of the glass in rings at the level of rest.  Smell: A strong caramel malt aroma with citrus hints, along with a strong hop character.  Taste: A strong malt flavor greets the palette, with the orange and apricot citrus flavors creeping in. The hops bring in the more detailed grapefruit and peach flavors. A nice bitter pinch at the end of the sip is nicely offset by a caramelized sweetness, leaving my mouth with a wonderful taste.  Mouthfeel: A full, somewhat grainy feel. More creamy than carbonated.  Drinkability: A good beer with a strong, balanced flavor. Definitely a nice beer to enjoy with a flavorful sandwich. This beer has enough flavor to keep me interested and is balanced enough for me to really savor it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,youngblood,4.27,"This is one of my stand by IPA's. Very nice looking beer here. Pours semi-gold and amber with a very fluffy pure white head.Sticks around for a bit and then laces the glass as the brew disappears. This smells very piney and floral, with some underlying citrus (although quite faint). The hops are obviously the focus of this IPA and oils taste wonderful. Strong pine dryness coming through with a sweet malt backbone. Bit of raison underneath? Quite complex for an IPA. Very nice mouthfeel, smooth and slightly sticky. Very drinkable and refreshing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BacklitAvenger,4.35,"Presentation - Poured the fishy bottle into a tulip as it was the only clean glass. Paired with a porter-laced irish chedder. Mmmmm!  Appearance - A pretty golden color all the way through. Held to the light it is luminously yellow, straw-colored but more vibrant in hue than your average straw colored beer. Ivory head caps a bubbly body, leaving lacings all up and down the inside of the tulip.  Smell - Citric, piney hops. The malt doesn't come through very well in the aroma, perhaps a bready note here or there?  Taste - Here's where the beer really shines. It is definitely hops forward, but there's a very substantial maltiness as well if one pays attention to the overall flavor. It's a biscuity, grain flavor, like baked bread. The hops are citric, but also floral and piney, a characteristic I prefer because too many IPAs I have tasted are grapefruit or tangerine bombs with nary a note of malt, or even a non citric hop to be found. This is a more balanced brew with a solid malt backbone and a more complex hop bouquet. Luckily this brew also escapes one of the worse pitfalls that IPAs can fall into: extreme bitterness. This has a bitter taste about mid swallow, and a dry finish, but the aftertaste is all hops. Despite this, there's no lingering bitterness, and the bitter tastes in the drink are balanced by the malt.  Mouthfeel - Light, yet substantial. The carbonation is moderate, not too much or too little.  Drinkability - A bit higher ABV than my usual brews, but definitely refreshing and thirst quenching in any situation. I have drank myself stupid on my friend's two hearted (wouldnt waste mine that way) and I can assure you it's just as tasty and drinkable after ten than after one.  A Note - This will start to lose hop flavor after a month or so in the fridge, and less in the cellar. Some people might not like this, but I say it is about equally good after losing some hops than before. It allows the tasty malts to really shine, and two hearted has a delicious grain bill, so maybe take a bottle when you grab a sixer and stick it somewhere for a month or two. Try it then if you're open minded enough.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BoitSansSoif,4.18,"A-Nearly clear golden-amber w/frothy white head. Decent lacing and retention.  S-Fresh floral and herbal hops, pale malt, light citrus, light biscuity notes, faint honey, grapefruit.  T-Even floral hops and pale malt, biscuity midpalate w/herbal character, and finish brings nice bitter hops w/aftertaste of light grapefruit rind.  M-Moderate-bodied w/even, prickly carbonation. The balance favors hop bitterness, but features a greater share of floral and herbal varieties, and less citrus hops than a lot of the American IPAs that are popular. This results in a reduction of the grapefruit/tangerine rind that sometimes dominates the finish and tips the balance overwhelmingly in favor of citrus hops.  D-One of my all-time favorite go-to beers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Taste: A less bitter IPA, taste mostly follows the nose, definitely refreshing, the alcohol is not noticeable  Mouth feel: If beer were soda.... light and fizzy  Easy drinkability, this is a light floral IPA which doesn't exactly fit the IPA mold, not intensely hoppy but tasty and refreshing, I could drink a large quantity of this. This is a good beer to give someone who has only ever had beer with LITE in the name, to break them of their foolishness.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,nms1987,4.12,"I'm doing head to head of Two Hearted and Founder's Centennial IPA since they are both IPAs from Michigan and both are hopped with exclusively (i think) Centennial hops.  Both are dark, hazy gold/tawny. Two hearted is maybe a little ligher in color. Both pour nicely.  Both have nice IPA noses. Founder's nose might be a little more spicy and pungent but not necessarily better smelling. Two Hearted's nose might be called ""floral"".  Two Hearted is a lovely beer. Sharp piney hops up front but with a lovely body. The Founder's is very nice as well but it is somewhat marred by an odd aftertaste. Again, it might slightly hoppier but that doesn't mean it is as good. Despite the same hops, and the beers do taste very similar, the two beers have their differences.

Nice body, sticky mouthfeel. Moderately bitter, hoppy finish.  Great balance, great beer.

287,1093,brow1901,4.35,"Two Hearted has been a favorite of mine for awhile, I would call it my go-to beer. I finally decided to review it.  A- Pours a cloudy dirty orange, bordering on a rust color. I went a little violent on the pour whoops, but it produced a huge bright white head. One thing I enjoy about the appearance of this beer is how I can always see bubbles rising from the bottom. The head died a bit, but left good lacing down the glass.  S- Smells like a citrus hops variety with some spice in it. The citrus reminds me of peaches. This beer smells as good as it looks. The hops arn't overpowering. I like how when I really stick my nose in there I can pick out other scents, with hopslam I can't do that.  T- The taste is much less bitter than some IPA's. But is more sweet, a faint hint of alcohol can be found in the after tastes.  M- The mouth feel is great, very light. The carbonation bubbles explode as they hit your tounge leaving this excelent feeling. The beer doesn't dry the mouth at all, it kinda leaves a film actually. This beer is very refreshing by the way.  D- For me this is one of the most drinkable beers. They go down so smoothe, and quick! The alcohol is a bit high at 7% but not overwhelming after two or three. So not a session beer but if it had a lower abv it certainly would be.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Dulliwhig,4.45,"I poured this into a pint glass. It had a thick fluffy head that took a long time to settle. What it left in it's wake was sticky globs of head around the top of the glass and a finger and a half thick creamy ivory colored head. It was a hazy golden orange color with a maelstrom of tiny yeast bits dancing around and swirling.  The aroma is dominated by juicy sweet grapefruit/peach flavor and a mild and subdued pine.  The taste mirrors the smell. The grapefruit and peaches mesh together, but the grapefruit wins because of the citrus hop bitterness in the end with a drying effect.  Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, a bit chewy, between medium and full bodied, good carbonation.

Great retention, loads of lacing.  Aroma is big time citrus and pine. Grapefruit is the dominant citrus smell. Malt sweetness behind the hops.  Taste is all hops. Pretty good hop balance between the citrus and the pine. Excellent pale malt backbone.  Smooth drinker. Fairly light body, but still has a nice creaminess. Appropriately carbonated and highly drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S: The nose is a big blast of grapefruit and pine. A bit of pineapple. Very nice blend of hops. Some orange marmalade from the sweet malts.  T: Wow, there's no doubt that the hops are the star of the show here. Some citrus/grapefruit bitterness followed by some resiny, piney hops and some pineapple. The malt backbone is there just enough to keep it balanced. A slight spicy bite in the back is pretty nice as well.  M: Mouthfeel is very good. Just the right level of thickness. Carbonation may be just a touch higher than I would like, but it's close.  D: This does pack a punch at 7%, but I could put 3-4 of these away in a session, easily.

The head subsided slowly, leaving a thin layer of foam for most of the glass. Good bit of lacing  Smell: Pine, grass, slightly citrusy hops. Hints of a bready and honey sweetness behind the hops, but the hops dominate.  Taste: Bitterness of piney hops, with a surprisingly malty, bready finish. There is a hint of the hops in the aftertaste, but the aftertaste is much more balanced. Alcohol is well hidden.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated, but a little too thin. The lack of body makes all of the flavors seem a little bit muted.  Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable. If it weren't for the relatively high ABV, this would make a great session beer.

Floral and citrusy first (lemon zest, grapefruit), with some piney hops following. A little malt, but the hops are all over the aroma.  T- This is a great beer, in my opinion. Again, hoppy--the piney-ness takes a backseat to the citrus, especially the grapefruit. Pleasant bitterness, little bite at first, but as the bottle goes on it mellows out a little. Nice malt backbone as one gets into it too. Well balanced.  M- Creamy with good body. Nicely carbonated. More body than most IPAs I've had.

Finally gave it a try and glad I did. A strong offering from Bell's.  Pours a golden brown with an two finger off-white head into a Sam Adams sensory glass. Great lacing that sticks to the glass from a head that is retained till the end.  Smell is fresh pine hops and citrus. Nothing overpowering, but pleasant nonetheless.  Fresh taste at the start with a mildly bitter finish. Quite a bit of carbonation - somewhat more than I prefer. To me, this is a toned down version of Hopslam which is definitely not a criticism. Not my favorite IPA, but another solid effort from Bell's that is worth seeking out.

One of the best pine and grapefruit hop flavors that I have ever had. Only the slightest bit of malt sweetness is present just long enough to give your palate a break from the delicious hoppy bitterness.  M- Good carbonation and medium bodied. Long hoppy finish.

This has the most crisp, citrusy, delicious aroma. Perhaps the best smelling IPA in my opinion. I detect a grapefruit like aroma with a sweetness on the tail end.  T: The hop aroma delivers. Not as well balanced as Hopslam, but never the less delicious. The flavor is pretty much all hops, not a whole lot else going on.  M: Very thin and light body with a bit of a sticky mouthfeel.

287,1093,BigMike,4.82,"After giving this beer an unfavorable review the first time around. I decided to get a fresh sixer and try it again. I'm not sure if my first sixer was old or what was wrong but i wasn't really a fan of it. Maybe my pallet has developed more in the past year. Who knows?  Batch #9499 which according to Bell's website says this was bottled on Dec. 14, 2009. Making this less then 4 weeks old. So this is a super fresh sample.  Pours a golden yellow with some orange mixed in. About a finger and half head thats white in color and somewhat soapy in appearance.  Smell is awesome. Fresh candied hop aroma. Citrus and some floral notes.  This is sweeter then i would have thought. Tastes like candied white grapefruit. A quick shot of bitterness gives way to a candied sweetness that finishes clean and crisp.  Mouthfeel is light and fluffy and smooth. Goes down with no trouble. Medium bodied and medium carbonation.  The first time i tried this i said i wouldn't seek it out again. After this six pack i can say that this is a delicious beer. Maybe the fact that it is less then 4 weeks old has something to do with it. I'm not sure. I am sure that this sixer stands no chance of surviving the night.

287,1093,Arbitrator,4.11,"Chilled bottle into a glass, courtesy of Uwftke26.  A: Pours a hazy copper color with gold highlights when held to a lamp. A two-finger off-white head recedes into a filmy collar on top of the brew, leaving thick lacing down the glass in its wake. A beautiful appearance.  S: Grapefruit hops front and center, with a lesser floral hop presence and an undercurrent of pine. Hard to detect the malts against the powerful hop bouquet, but there is a nice [small] caramel and biscuit malt nose to it.  T: Following the nose, the primary flavor is the sweet and slightly acidic flavor of grapefruit hops. A slight pine hop flavor with grassy and earthy hints. It's vaguely balanced by a biscuit malt presence with caramel decoration, but this is clearly dedicated to the hops, and it's hard to miss. The finish is a grassy and floral hop bitterness that lingers well into a sticky aftertaste.  M: Medium bodied with a slightly chewy texture. Medium carbonation that results in a slightly foamy finish. I'd prefer lower carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden, and there is no unpleasant oily or slick feeling with this beer. Good presence and body.  D: Quite high. I liked Bell's HopSlam, and I enjoy this one, as well.

Drinkablilty is great; I could (and have) had just one or MANY of these beers in one sitting. Very versatile in that regard.  I love that this beer is available year-round at just about every store near me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,popery,4.25,"Excellent IPA with a huge hop profile. This beer has a ton of hops, even for an IPA. It really borders on a DIPA, like Russian River's Blind Pig. It's a slightly hazy golden liquid with a stiff, foamy head. The aroma is full of citric hops. The flavor has an excellent malt backbone that lies beneath a bouquet of hop notes that tend toward the bitter citric end of the spectrum. The smell is a bit more floral than the flavor. The beer is well-balanced and the alcohol is nicely hidden. It tastes very American but still quite different than an aggressive San Diego style. I enjoyed this beer very much.

287,1093,farrago,4.69,"Simple off-white colored head, gets close to one finger and runs off into a thin coating across the surface, the lacing shows more tenacity and stickiness. Red to brunt orange in color, takes on a more metallic yellow or rust cast around the rims, clear enough to watch the fat bubbles swim upwards. The nose offers up sweet pink grapefruit and tangerine citrus in spades, wheat, rye and soda bread notes, brawny apricot, peach, pineapple fruit scents, warm spring day explosion of fresh flowers, digs in without bruising. Medium-bodied, lively and energetic from the first sip to last, the carbonation dances a tango across the tongue. The pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime citrus slightly more bitter here, just as much as an overpowering presence. Pretty peach, apricot, pear fruit, swells until pine sap, rye and granola in addition to a malt smoothness brings things closer to earth and elongates the experience into more than a series of punctuation marks. With each bottle it's drained before you think it's even half done.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TooleBurger,3.9,"I had this on draft at Philly Beer Week at the Meet the Brewers event last night. I was very impressed.  It had a nice red ale look to it with minimal head. It had a nice hoppy smell and a great taste. You can really taste the hops and a little citrus twang. It is a nice American ale, almost a red ale.  It also has about the right alcohol content, so you can enjoy a few of them.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Reaper16,4.62,"I was surprised when, by some stroke of happenstance, I realized that I had not reviewed my favorite beer: Bell's Two Hearted Ale. I also hadn't had one in a couple of months (!), so I was eager to review it. From the looks of it, this bottle might have been on the shelf for a while. Served from a 12oz. bottle into the only glass I had available, a Chimay goblet.  Poured a murky, sickly shade of pale-orange. Not as yellow as I remember it usually being, but that may be due to the lighting. The 1.5-finger, rocky, off-white head dissipates at a normal rate. Lacing seems pretty good.  I love the nose on this beer. Its just so impeccably floral; its as if you were directly in a garden. Petal and plant stalk mix with loads of assertive lemony/citrus notes. This stuff smells like a hoppy brew; very appetizing.  Oh, yeah. That hits the spot. What can I say about Two Hearted that hasn' already been confirmed by legion? It hits all of the right pine and citrus hop flavors... only it hits them better than any other single IPA (in my un-exhaustive opinion anyway). Such a pleasant bitterness lingers on the tongue, compelling you to drink more.  Which you can, by the way, because even at 7% ABV, this is imminently drinkable. I always want to have more bottles. Nice, lightish mouthfeel with carbonation levels that don't lend a sharp prickly character. Just a smooth drinker all the way. I must also mention the awesome ""hop-burps"" that this beer delivers on.  I first drank this beer before signing up for Beer Advocate. The label, with its odd painting of a fish, forced me to purchase what I, then and now, refer to as ""Fish Beer."" I didn't know much about they style then, but I knew that I liked it. Nostalgia is not clouding my judgment. Two Hearted Ale remains a bright light in the beer world. Simply excellent.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Docer,4.03,"Thanks again to JoBoTo for adding this great IPA into the shipment for trade. A very good Ale indeed.  - Love the look of these Bells I have tried... like an unfiltered Hefe.. light amber orange with a cloudy haze of goodness. Huge creamy head on this one. Batch 8752. The bottle sat, and still flowed out the bottle when opened. Great lacing, and left a nice soft later of creamy head.  - Smell is quite floral indeed.. little bit of rye, bread.. and sweet success.  - Taste is of rye, bread, and floral hop. Creamy and light. (7%? wow). Some lemon and citrus zest in there too.. almost like adding peel zest to the mix instead of Honey to the ""strong ale Hopslam"".  - Leaves my mouth about the same as a Widmer Hefe. Bready chewy rye aftertaste w/ light carb.  - So easy to drink... and would be so easy to slam 6 pints from tap w/out notice.  A great drinker... I am impressed by Bells. Wish they shipped to Portland Oregon on a regular bases. I wouldn't mind paying more than the usual every once in awhile.  I have noticed that their beers seem to be in the wrong classifications. I just ask myself if they use rye. Hopslam should be considered an American Strong Ale... as it doesn't state it is an IIPA I believe.  To me this is a Pale though :-/",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,csmiley,4.25,Batch 8984  A - Color is medium gold and hints around at light orange in the right light. The off white head tops out at just over half inch before settling to a paper thin cap. Retention is average while light lacing is able to stick around afterwards.  S - Aroma is loaded with citrusy goodness. Lots of orange gets backed up by a lighter mango smell. Gets sugary about midway. More fruit finishes it up. Could be some grapefruit that pop in for a visit.  T - Sweet citrus flavors dominate this brew. Loads of orange with some bitter grapefruit that come together to make a very juicy beverage. The malt base really just supports the fruity hops. Some hard candy comes through at the end. Light bread flavors come through in a very distant aftertaste.  M - On the lighter side of medium bodied with a slightly active carbonation that tickles the palate. Finish start out sweet and fruity finishing off with a mild dry bitterness.  D - Drinkability is good. This is a juicy well balanced brew. Alcohol is hard to pick out in the flavor and aroma. The bitterness level works very well with the other flavors. The malt stays out of the way (for the most part). Bells has a good thing going with the Two Hearted. This one is easily reocommended.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,johnnybgood1999,3.81,"A: A beautiful beer. It is an unusual light honey brown.  S: Hoppy, with more citrus than I think I've ever smelled in an IPA. A hint of alcohol is apparent as well. The citrus seems to be orange versus the typical grapefuit.  T: Really mild in the front of the mouth, then citrus takes over. The hops were not nearly as present as expected. Orange is the most prevalant flavor to me with hops coming in a fairly distant second.  M: Nothing out of the ordinary either good or bad.  D: Kinda so so here as well. I couldn't get through many of these.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S: Smells of strong pine and hops with some maltiness.  T: Strong pine and citrus/floral hops with a nice caramel backbone. Nothing amazing, just a great simple IPA taste.  Overall: One of may favorites, Great oily and well carbonated mouthfeel. The best thing about this beer is the drinkability, I could easily drink this from sun-up to sun-down. Wonderful.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TheDoorman,3.6,"Cloudy golden color with tons of lively carbonation, white head dissipates quickly. Aroma is a bouqet of lovely citric hops. Grapefruit comes through upfront. Some grass and pine notes as well. Taste is pleasant though short of great. There's a touch of sweetness in the palate, but the hops are not as prevalent until the finish. They lack the symphonic multi-layered hop flavors that the aroma suggested. A nice dry finish. Light on the palate. Mouthefeel has some problems though. This beer is so overcarbonated that it affects the taste and entire experience. This style tends to have a good amount of carbonation, but this beer needs to tone it down a bit.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Sweet caramel maltiness followed by a delicious array of bitter hoppiness, grapefruit, pine, lemon/lime zest, mango, superbly balanced flavors here.  Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, crisp, clean, nice.  Drinks great. I could session these frequently, daily, hourly, all the time.  Wish this was available to me on a regular basis. Great flavors.

287,1093,ABOWMan,4.33,"I love this beer. Poured from the bottle an easy three fingers of creamy off white, long lasting head. Lacing is apparent in between each sip taken. The color is honey maple and the beer is slightly cloudy from yeast sediment.  The aroma is of fresh citrus, like the whole tree! Mostly grapefruit I would think.  The flavor leads with a sweet malt note followed closely by cirtusy hops with only slight bitterness and then roasted orange zest. I think it is the balance of hops and sweet malt that I find so appealing with this fine ale. I love big IPA's but they can get overpowering if consumed one after another. This Two Hearted Ale has such an nice combination of malt and hops with background citrus flavor, that I could easily drink glass after glass.  If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, I would give this ale serious consideration.

M = Very crisp and dry with just enough substance to support the slight warmth of the alcohol content.  D = For being a 7% beer this is incredibly drinkable.

This is a lot more balanced than I anticipated for an IPA.  M- Smooth without being overly creamy. Seems like a good compromise for being an IPA.  D - Hey! Its already half gone! I'd say very good!  This really earns its reputation as one of the best straight up American IPA's. I appreciate hops, but wouldn't call myself a hophead, and I find this very easy to love.

The aroma is hop-focused: delicious orange-blossom citrus and resiny hops. There's also a bit of a raw sugar undercurrent.  There's a toasty malt backbone with a light, raw sweetness. There's a nice citric hop flavor with a light herbal, resiny kick. Well balanced, there's a focus on the hop flavors rather than the hop bitterness.

S-Bright piney hops, a bit of citrus in the background. Fresh and smooth aroma.  T-Magnificent. Thick with resiny hops, piney, and then a citrus smack gets me with a right hook. Bitterness is strong and does a good job of balancing the bready malts, and then some (that is, when I can find the malts among the flood of hops). Citrus fruitiness comes through some, estery. Finishes with residual bitter and hoppiness, semi-dry.  M-Hoppy-grainy feel, moderate body. It just feels bitter. Carbontion is low enough to allow all the rediculous hoppy goodness to be fully appreciated. Finishes without a hint of the lip smack taste/feel that some American IPAs have.  D-Great.

287,1093,LiamMcFee,4.57,"I've been on another IPA journey, lately, and it's been great. In order, I have visited Bell's HopSlam, Stone Ruination, and Bell's Two Hearted Ale. I'm delighted with all three, and in love with HopSlam, but the surprise of them was Two Hearted Ale. I've long been a fan of Dogfish's 60- and 90-minute IPAs, and the Hercules Double IPA has been the king of that style for me for a while. You'll have to read other reviews to see if it has retained its crown . . .  Two Hearted definitely beats it in one category: drinkability. It's a big-hopper, for sure, but it has a better balance and doesn't assault your taste buds like Hercules or Ruination. Citrus and pineapple are refreshingly pleasant, and the malt is right where it needs to be. To echo another review, it's so enjoyable that the glass is empty before you're ready, and you definitely want another. I need to test it against a few more, but for drinkability and price (compared to the very pricey competition), this may be my new favorite IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

There is nary a carbonation bubble to be seen; however, the glass retains a modicum of clingage, consisting of small glistening slabs of floral-scented lace.  The nose is overwhelmed by intnese notes of apple and lemon, a wonderfully enticing bouquet that welcomes many senses. Additionally, there is a sweet taste of citrus that is carefully balanced with lemony hops to make for a smooth mouthfeel.

A place called the Online Cafe, just in case you happen to be passing through the airport and want a quality brew.  Hazy, almost golden, fluffy white head stays a while, leaves thick patches of lacing.  Initially strong grapefruity and floral hop aroma. Mellows and blends well later. Sufficient malty base is evident.  Strong and sweet malty base provides backdrop for a deep hoppy bitterness and flavor. Grapefruity and floral flavor, with moderate bitterness. Smooth and balanced.  Plenty of carbonated, fiz fades and a rich, fullish texture emerges, some mild bitterness in and after the finish, but quite crisp and clean overall.

287,1093,timmay41,3.8,"I was in northern VA for the Inauguration--Great Falls, to be exact--on a sleepy Sunday morning and went into a quaint international cafe and market. They had a small but quality selection of six packs, with the most pleasant surprise being a lone sixer of this beer, which I've only had before at Monk's Cafe. I was psyched.  Batch 8526, which I now realize means it's not at the peak of freshness. Hopefully I'll find an opportunity to review from a fresher batch, but here it goes...  A: Pours a cloudy marigold with considerable carbonation. Settles quickly and produces a thin peal white head that dissolves quickly. Not much lacing, which again may be the product of age...  S: Big citrus and some floral scents, along with malt sweetness on the back of the nose. Not the big or sharp hop bitterness I sort of expected.  T: Bland for the first few sips, but after warming up a little there's more distinctive taste--biting, dry hop notes, with hints of grapefruit and pine. The beer makes a move toward balance with some mellowing malt character. Crisp overall.  M: Carbonation kind of dominates, and the tingle lingering, clinging to the bottom sides of the tongue.

The beer looks pretty clear, but i left about 3 ounces in the bottle that is full of the sediment  Smell. Very floral and piney with a bit of citrus.  Taste. I think the citrus comes out more in the flavor, and has a stronger greatfruit character to it. I still get some of the pine, but it has died down to me from the smell. Certainly a hoppy beer, but there are some good malts that come out with a touch of a caramel flavor. It has just a great flavor, but the taste also has a bit of an unfiltered characteristic to it that, honestly, i am not too big on...but other than that it is great. I get more pine in the aftertaste, but with a nice sweet caramel touch.  Mouthfeel. The beer is crisp and lively with a good amount of carbonation, and the body is a bit filling to the palate.  Overall, a very nice ipa. The first time i had it, i thought it was one of the best things that has happened to me, beer wise. But later, getting a 6-pack of it on vacation, I seemed to have lost the initial love i had for it. I still think its a great beer, but i cannot get over the unfiltered flavor that i keep getting from it...so though i really like it, it is not one of my favorite ipas, but i can certainly see why others would say it is.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BARFLYB,4.17,"12oz bottle into a Flyers pint glass. Batch # is in the 8900's so this is pretty fresh I assume.  A- Two hearted has a golden to pale yellow color to itself. This is bottle conditioned so i took my time pouring and got a 1/2 inch white head. Once that died it left a strong ring around the glass with a skim of foam in the middle. Upon a closer look up to light some visible dust like particles are seen floating all around.  S- This american IPA has scents of ripe fruits such as grapefruit, oranges & other citrus flavors. Atouch of piney resin comes out also. A big dose of floral hops in here. Some sweet malts to balance it all out. No alcohol in smell with some breadyness, great smells all around.  T- The hops rush up front giving off citrus flavors galore as mentioned above. Grapefruit goodness is leading the pack with orange sweetness trailing. Much more of a bready aspect then expected based upon the nose on this. Also getting some piney resin flavors from a different hop variety. I wonder if this is due to the bottle conditioning. The malts used in this bring everything into perspective. This is one finely balanced IPA and not to bitter.  M- This one is perfect with the hops and malts working seemlessly with one another. Once some bitterness coats the tounge the malts come through and then.. nothing. This one comes and goes very quickly leaving no trace of alcohol and only a mild hop presence. Light to medium bodied with solid carbonation.  D- This is a solid IPA that is just above sessionable but oh well i'm going to drink a few of these and love it. Great price for such a gem and has good availability in my area.This will be in my sights in the future trust me. A great American IPA that isn't over the top and expertly balanced.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,madtowndmb1,4.35,"This beer pours a cloudy orange with a big yellowish/white head. The smell is mostly piney/floral hops, with a hint of acidity to it. With the smell I always expect a bitter hop bomb, but it's not. It's hoppy without being overbearing and has a nice floral finish. It's very smooth and extremely drinkable.

Smell consists mostly of piney and floral hops. A bit of a tart edge to it. Taste is very hoppy, but not overly bitter, a bit of a citrusy bite to finish. Overall, pretty good I'd say. I'm not normally a huge fan of IPA's or any beer that's hop dominated, but this beer's pretty smooth and easy drinking. A definite recommendation, and I would for sure drink this beer again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The smell is almost exclusively floral to me. Not piney, not citrus, not grassy but floral like flowers.  Taste is awesome. Medium body, tiny but appropriate carbonation. Well represented hops in the middle but it finishes relatively clean.  On a drum kit the taste of this beer would be the snare not the kick or the cymbal. Middle of the palate, complex and resonate but it does not linger not punch you in the palate.

T - Again hop bitterness is instant but the aftertaste is quite interesting. The bitterness fades and there's a nice woody/floral/slight citrus flavor....quite complex.

It's rich slightly crepuscular singed orange color is luring me in. (as you can tell I've already fallen in love with this beer).  My nose is overwhelmed with rushes of floral and coniferous hops. Behind the tastefully put up hop wall you can smell high quality malts. Malts that you might smell in the best beers. The expensive kind.  Hints of orange, grapefruit and wildflowers dominate the tongue. Quite refreshing. Only slightly bitter. Has a nice little tingle in the aftertaste. Would probably go well with grilled fish or chicken.  I would suggest that maybe the yeast is the secret signature of this beer.  This is such a great everyday beer. It's my ""session"" of choice. It holds its own yet pairs well with most foods.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,n811,4.4,"Poured into a pint glass revealing a beautiful light copper color and a great head with nice small bubbles. The head collapsed in that great clumpy effect that always heightens my anticipation.  Smell is a terrific light citrus with just a touch of piney-ness. I just had a Hopslam last week and the Two-Hearted has much of the same aroma, just less intense.  Taste was fantastic - a nice bitter-sweet citrusy flavor that finishes nice and dry. The hops really come through in a bold but refined fashion. Not over the top at all. I love this beer, plain and simple.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ItMakesMeHappy,4.32,"Pours a light golden color with a small fluffy white head consisting of the tiny bubbles produced by bottle conditioning. It smells wonderful, tangerine and citrus notes dominate. Unlike many things in life this beer tastes as good as it smells. Those tangerine, fruity notes being giving off by the hops hit you up front with a mild malt sweetness present in the middle to the end. It wasn't very bitter for an IPA but the aroma hops were very evident. This beer contains a light to medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation. This beer hides its 7.0% abv very well and is dangerously drinkable. This beer is unlike any other IPA I have personally have had before because it seems to focus on aroma hops and really backs off on the bittering. Its a great beer and worth a try.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,SteveO1231,4.85,"Received a six-pack of Two Hearted Ale in a trade with HopHobo. 12oz. long neck bottle, with an orange outlined label that features an illustration of a lake trout. Batch 8918 i think?  Pours a brilliant golden yellow. Tons of carbonation, resulting in a super-thick head of white foam that settles into frothy clouds. Some excellent lacing clinging to the top ring of my Allagash glass. Two Hearted Ale has a nose is a perfect balance of malt sweet character and a bouquet of hops. I understand that this beer is brewed using only Centennial hops. They are showcased well in the aroma, floral, citrus, and a hint of pungent, blue cheesiness. Mouthfeel is absolutely outstanding, velvety smooth with a slickness probably from the abundance of hop oils saturated within the liquid. I would have to say that this IPA has got to be the most perfectly balanced IPAs that I have ever tasted. The malt sweetness balances the citrus, grapefruit juice flavor perfectly. The brew finishes with a pleasant, piney-grapefruit dryness that is both delicious and refreshing. My review might be a little biased since centennial hops are my absolute favorite but if I had access to this beer, it would constantly be found in my fridge.  Cheers!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jamesdantes13,4.1,Pours a pale amber brew with a decent head that dissipates quickly.  Smell is dominated by hops--piney and citrus with some fruit in the background.  Hop flavor upfront; slightly floral with a lot of citrus. This is followed by a bready flavor from the malt and finishes dry. Has a light body and a crisp mouthfeel throughout.  Very easy to drink for a 7% beer due to the exceptional mouthfeel. Enough hops to quench any hophead's cravings.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,mooseisloose,4.51,"have seen this brew as a preferred purchase in the forums, so when I spotted one at ABC, I snagged it up to give it a whirl. Hop smell is a delicious dry hopped woodsy, piney smell. Pours to orange-yellow with a foamy two finger head that laces as it recedes. Taste is a very different hop taste than I have ever tasted before. Initial, but not for long, taste is malty, then the hops kick in. Again almost pine like hop that builds and builds in flavor, but not really bitter. It lingers in the finish but it still lets a slight bit of malts through. Silky mouthfeel but still a slight carbonation zest. This is a very different ale. Unique. The AC is not evident at all. I like it and will definitely be purchasing more of this brew. Drinkability suffers a tad for the AC but hey, if you wanna play you gotta pay. Oops it's gone! I now see on the bottle it's a Yooper style beer, that's why it's so good! Brings me back to ""the woods"".",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,skillerified,3.87,"This bottle has been in cold storage for about two years.  The pour is nice, but pretty standard for the style. Rich gold color. Has an appearance similar to honey. White cream colored head. Short head, but I guess I'd expect that due to the age of the brew.  The scent is really pretty amazing. The words for it that immediately come to mind are citrus flowers. I've never smelled a real citrus flower, to the best of my knowledge, but the floral and citrus scents are so well intertwined that they seem like one. And it smells delicious to me. To be a little more specific, I get a lemony citrus scent. I'm no good at placing specific floral scents, so I won't even try. There are also hints of apple and grape. Could stand to have a little more complexity and/or added scents, but overall this is pretty phenomenal.  Taste is actually turning out to be a little disappointing. Still tasty, but it definitely lacks the firepower that the younger ones had. Fruity, but sort of indescriminately so. Apple again, I suppose. Not nearly as citric as it smells. A little white grape maybe. There are hints of clove and other spices every now and then. Still pretty good, but doesn't seem to compare favorably to fresher versions.  The mouthfeel has definitely smoothed out between this bottle and the last one I had before it (about a year and a half, I'd guess). There isn't that sharp, bitter bite that was there before. Still a good amount of carbonation buzz on the tongue. Nothing too outstanding here.  Even after two years, this brew is pretty drinkable. Unfortunately, I don't think it's really any better than the younger bottles they. The flavor is definitely subtler this time around, and that can be a good thing, but I'm just not sure it suits this beer. Definitely a brew worth purchasing though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,droomyster,4.42,"Dark a slightly hazy dark gold with a medium white head. Nice hoppy aromas with multiple layers, ranging from evergreen needles to the citrus spectrum, but not in an overwhelming, steroid hopped way. No alcohol detectable. Sweet malts also insert themselves into the aroma equation. A resinous, medium full body with a lot of malt/hop tug of war on the palate, finishing dry, with an orange zest that hangs on for a bit. Drinks very beautifully. Stands up to hearty, flavorful foods but also has the balance and finesse to be enjoyed on its own.

They have an oily quality that slides down your throat. Earthy malts that add a bit of balance. Finishes with a bit of bitterness.  M - Has a creamy feel, more than I expected, very nice.

287,1093,witster18,3.02,Interesting beer. This smells of IPA and initially it tastes of IPA with strong pink grapefruit and copper malt backbone... but then there's a little bite of fake-fruity-artificialsweetness... reminds me of Leiny's sunset wheat... almost like somebody dropped a shot of that in here... WHICH IS NOT a good thing... it really hits in the aftertaste and really turns me in the wrong direction on this beer... I give it props for the taste up front... and for the fact that it completely hides it's alcohol content... in that aspect I'm not sure if I've ever had a 7%'er that didn't have some alcohol bite... but that off-put-taste of fake sweetener is just turning me off of this one and it will be my last. traded a 6 pack of Dortmunder Gold for two bottles(one of these) and a grolwer of Highlands organic... great quantity trade but terrible 'taste' trade...

Smell: Sweet orange and grapefruit right away. Slight pine but mostly fruity and sweet malts, plenty of hoppy goodness.  Taste: More than just grapefruit this beer tastes like grapefruit juice with a grassy background. Somewhere in there is some malt but there's so much hop flavor and bitterness it gets lost.  Mouthfeel: Lightly creamy, with a very crisp semi-dry finish.  Drinkability: I've had nights where I've had waaay too much of this one, but it's easy to do. I like and dislike the fact that it's 7%ABV. I guess it just depends on my mood.  Overall: This is the beer that introduced me to craft beer and delicious IPAs, it will always have a special place in my heart and when I'm at work (where we have it on tap) it's my go to beer.

For a midwest IPA style this is on the map with a very grapefruity citrus flavor with a clean orange peel finish. Keeping it on the coolder side helps the drinkibility.

Smell: Somewhat like if you mowed your lawn around your garden in which you were growing citrus fruits and hops. Refreshing, and very natural.  Taste: Upfront you have citrus fruits (mostly grapefruit or pomelos), grass clippings of freshly-cut tall grass, and some faint flowery aromas. Hops creep up midway and then finish with a slightly artificial bitterness which seems a little inconsistent with the subtle balance of the rest of the flavors.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Somewhat creamy and very refreshing; the sensation of drinking bottled water out of the fridge on a hot day. Active carbonation keeps things perky.

The head stands tall and proud at 2 fingers high with a dull weathered white color, some porous content and a great standing time.  S: Freshly squeezed lemons and oranges, floral scents and some pale grains.  T: The flavor is flowery citrus, slightly drying speak first, crisp pale malting that should not be forgotten. Most ipas tend to kill the palate with an abundance of speciality malts, thus forgetting what the P in IPA stands for. The malting is perfectly balanced with the hops, the sweetness is limited to a brief appearence upfront, no dry toasted caramel, here the pale malts show thier due respect, being crisp, bready, and let the hops come through in the finish.  M: Crisp, light bodied, sparkling and refreshing with a spicy bite of fresh citrus. Tingles off the tongue with a dry hop notice.  O: Overall had this several years ago before i started an appreciation, vocabulary and taste to define such remarkable greatness.

On-tap at the Eccentric Cafe is close to a religious experience.  A - Aggressive pour produces a frothy, off-white head of about one inch with pretty good retention. Some sticky lacing down the glass. Light burnt orange color and decent clarity.  S - Incredibly floral. Some citrus and sweet biscuity malt. I love the smell of this beer.  T - More floral and citrusy hops. The malt profile is light and never really stands out though I would say this beer is well-balanced.  M - Medium to full-bodied and a good amount of carbonation.  D - Very high. I love IPAs and a nice one like this that is packed with Centennial hops is right up my alley. Alcohol is 7% but that wouldn't (and hasn't) deterred me from drinking a sixer.

287,1093,MarzenMan,4.02,"A - Huge foamy head that had good retention and lots of lacing. Rocky appearance. Golden amber color.  S - Vey floral. Sweet and citrusy.  T - Good. A pretty tame IPA but good for what it is. Fairly sweet and floral. Not very bitter. Slightly thicker mouthfeel than expected. Lots of floral flavors that remind me of scented soap (Dawn). Bad comparison but thats what I'm thinking  D - Very high. Toes the line between Pale Ale and IPA. A very quaffable IPA.

Pretty sticky with nice lacing draping the side of my glass.  S. Very light, white grapes, a little bit of peach, grainy, dry hops, and some slight caramel. Too light in the nose. I wish there was more here, because the scents that come up and out are pretty good.  T. Tons of grain and malt tastes. Fairly dry hopped. Light caramel accents, and really sticky on the tongue.

287,1093,JerzDevl2000,4.31,"Picked this up in Ohio on my way back from the HoF run. I had no idea that this was in the BA Top 100 for beers brewed in the United States but after having half of this, it's pretty obvious why. Not only is this one tasty and well-crafted beer, but it was good enough to both ""sneak up on me"", but also to make me wish that I had picked up another bottle or two. I haven't had an IPA in quite a long time since most of them tend to be hop bombs or caught up in an arms race for the taste buds. This is totally different than those, as it may be the mnost subtle and balanced IPA that I've ever had. Yes, you heard me right!  The pour for this was truly amazing - even better than SNPA, which has been my benchmark as long as I can remember. I've never (and I mean, never!) seen a beer whose head lasted as long as this. It filled up my pint glass about 90% of this was poured out and part of it remained in my glass more than 2/3 of my way through this. Needless to say, the accompanying lacing was long-lasting as well, and the beautifully luminescent goldenrod hue only added to this beer's allure. This had an opaque radiance to it and the bubbles were also a sight to behold - once again, as numerous and distinctive as those in SNPA, but even longer-lasting. The taste was the shocker...yes, there's floral hops here but there's an incredible balance with the busuity maltness that is almost too good to be true. This doesn't have a dry-hopped aftertaste to it like so many other IPA's tend to have. This is a bit more on the resin side of things - no citru or metallic notes here. Just a bit of lemon and waxy resin to back things up. Nothing overpowering!  7.00% ABV? Can this be? I'm not even feeling any alcohol as I drink this. It's there, but you'll have to look and sip hard to find it. This is perfect for the state in which it was brewed, since the summers there are a bit less harsh than those in most of the rest of the United States. I'm not sure where the two hearted reference ties in but it if it has anythign to do with the malt and hops, than this beer is more than worthy of it's moniker. Arguably the best IPA I've ever had!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,jamie2dope,4,"A six pack of this beer was bought for me by a buddy during their stay in Michigan (big thanks Randy). Poured in to my new Cisco Brewery tulip glass a radiant gold, with about two fingers worth of white heading. Lots of small sediment can be seen floating around this beer if you look closely enough. Aroma is very floral, with hints of honeysuckle, a bit of garlic, and some citrus fruit thrown in the the mix. The floral part of it comes full swing in the flavor, with lots of lemon grass, earthy hops, bright citrus and oily resins. Body is about medium for an American IPA, just about right. The 7.00% ABV does not make itself known at all in the flavor. I am glad I finally got to try this one from Bells. It has a really spot on hop profile that you do not see in many IPAs on the East Coast. If I see this one at Extreme Beer Fest, I will be rushing over to grab some straight away.

287,1093,ljbrisson,4.33,"Pours a yellow-orange into my Sierra Nevada hop tulip, with tons of carbonation action and a finger-wide off-white head that has great retention throughout the tasting and leaves sheets of lacing on the glass. Aroma is strongly of piney hops, resembles the white pine Christmas tree I have yet to take down, with some breadiness and even a little bit of smoke. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, a little slippery and syrupy with well-balanced medium carbonation. Taste is like the nose, with piney hops, a lot of bready maltiness, nuts, and wood, finishes dry with good hop bitterness. Overall I this is a great brew and exactly what I expected for the style. Good balance in the taste, with hops that are not overly bitter. Drinkability is very good due to the good balance, and improves as it warms a bit and the flavors develop. Overall this is a great brew, very smooth, and I could definitely see myself picking up a sixer if the mood struck.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Brew is a translucent light amber/amber brew with bubbles floating to top.  Hops and hop oils are the first thing that hit the nose. Nice herbal and earthy notes with slight hint of citrus/pineapple. Taste is not as hoppy as the smell, but very nice with tones of slight sweetness/malts. Finish is nice. Bubbles attack, but not in a harsh way. Very drinkable.

Could drink several in a sitting.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,yeastsipper,3.7,"Reviewed from notes from 12/30/08:  Beer poured into a pint glass. As I am used to West Coast IPA's, I immediately notice the color. It is much more orange than copper. It is much lighter than a Racer 5 or certainly Green Flash. It just doesn't look as full bodied as some of the other IPA's I have tried.  I find nothing noteworthy in the nose. A slight piney bitterness from the hops and the alcohol, but nothing much else going on here.  Taste is good. There is good balance between the malt and the hops. However, I prefer my IPAs a bit more hoppy. Conversely, the lack of overpowering hop bitterness makes this a VERY drinkable beer. It is crisp and refreshing and I could down numerous in a sitting.  In summary, this would be a solid session beer, but not a beer I would consider memorable in any way. I am sure I am biased, but I believe the CA IPA's (Racer, Green Flash and certainly Pliny) compare very favorably to the Two Hearted.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,katan,3.73,"12 oz bottle into a pint, batch 8153 - this was a gusher  A - Pours a light golden color with a strong 1/4"" head. Little hazing - well filtered. Head is very well retained.  S - Noticeable hop character - very potent. Piney and sweet - almost grapefruit. As if I rubbed a nice fresh packet of cascade together. There is one tone in here I'm not sure of - it almost seems like bleach. Yeah I know, scary.  T - All bitter up front - just in your face. Mid-stream develops some of the good hop flavors. Finishes with a much more sweet malt profile that balances out that bitter assault. The aftertaste has an interesting nutty quality to it. There are some phenolic tones to it that I would normally associate with a DIPA.  M - Thick and creamy. Full bodied. Carbonation is noticeable on the profile as well. Get a little bit of oily hop residue in the aftertaste.  D - Amazingly easy to drink. Very drinkable for the style - I find the ABV is almost invisible (dangerous) and the carbonation doesn't bother my stomach.  At the end of the day, I have to call this one an also-ran. Nothing here really distinguishes it from some of the other offerings out there. Not to rag on this beer - as I would love to have it in my regular rotation. Iowa is a beer wasteland as it relates to Bell's high point beer. I find it very similar to a DFH 60 minute, something I can get - good news I guess.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Mistofminn,4.54,"Rereviewed 3/15/10  Was shocked to find that my local pub had this on tap. Until recently, this place didn't even have the proper liquor license and served near-beer. Their taps have gotten significantly better in the past month and they had an extremely fresh keg of this on tap so out of other options I thought I would revisit this bad boy. It's been a while since I've had this, and while not fully appreciating it the first time around, I gave it a B+, 3.95.  Served in a pint glass, I was kind of shocked at how light this is. Clear and golden, with only a slight copper tint to it. A juicy off-white head sits on top with excellent retention and leaves some awesome lacing.  Any doubts I had about this actually being Two Hearted were laid to rest as soon as I took a whiff. Orange and grapefruit, tons and tons of citrus notes in this one. Wet and juicy hops are overflowing in this. I can't beleive I haven't had this in so long, this is amazing!  The taste is floral and citrus as well, but does manage to kick a piney bitter punch. Pale malts are subtle at best, in the background.  Mouthfeel is about medium body with a crisp carbonation and a lingering bitter bite. Drinkability is amazing.  Last time I had this was in bottles, but I have to say the fresh keg makes this thing expontially better on tap.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

I could smell this beer as I was pouring it, with my head a good 2 feet from the glass.  T: I'm not a huge IPA fan or a ""Hop Head"" so I'm trying to review the taste based on the style and I'd say its a good outing here in terms of taste. Very floral and citrusy from beginning to end. Nice dry finish  M: Quite thick feel but not overly sticky. good carbonation  D: As I mentioned, I'm not a hop head so its hard to declare this one very drinkable,.. but I think I could probably have another one and not get too tired of it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

M - Medium bodied. Smooth but there's a nice prickly carbonation to it. Somewhat of a dry finish is present.  D - For 7% this is ridiculously drinkable. Overall this beer doesn't blow me away like I was hoping it would because it is highly regarded here on BA but it is still a good IPA. I think its strength is its drinkability.

It has a hazy copper-orange color with an inch of white head. It fades quickly but leaves a perfect sheet of lacing behind.  Aroma is great with a great amount of hops. Very pleasant.  Flavor is excellent and probably one of the best IPAs I can remember. Good balance but obviously weighted towards the hops. Great floral quality to hops.

287,1093,IBUnit63,4.4,"At the suggestion of everetends I did a side-by-side with Two Hearted and Sweetwater IPA. After enjoying Two Hearted immensely during a few days back in Richmond (most notably on tap at the Commercial Tap House) I figured it was time to give this another look. So let's have at it... Batch 8813 into Duvel tulip...  Bountiful 2-finger dulce de leche head with big bready qualities, a few muffin tunnels and exquisite lacing. Color is natural honey with slight white grapefruit (power of suggestion...imagine that!) tones. Some haze and steady carbonation; solid head retention. Barring a body that's a tinge on the light-colored side, almost looks like the best practice American IPA.  Mild citrus grapefruit tones gather strength with warmth. Some rind, more developing pulp and actually quite a bit of floral hop tones. The hop bitterness also adds a light pine texture towards what seems like a lighter malt profile than usual...maybe not the overly-viscous caramel tones we experience in some IPAs. Yet, the oiliness of the hops balances nicely.  So very light and clean, yet packed with flavor...bountiful yet soft citrus grapefruit hops with a touch of flora and hint of pine. Dry, lightly roasted pale/crystal-ish malt provides austere balance. Alcohol is buried in the woodshed out back. Surprisingly enough, gets more subtle with warmth...either than or the hop acidity has burned my taste buds.  Mouthfeel is solid and balanced - citrus tones actually tighten this one up a little bit. Finish is clean with no aftertaste...actually a little cleaner than expected.  As mentioned, I tried this one earlier this year and enjoyed it. Back in a sphere of availability in Virginia I tried it again...and loved it. Oh yeah...on tap it's virtually dangerous. Great just-shy-of-sessionable American IPA. Could drink this stuff all night long. ---  Original review 2/29/2008... A 4, S 4, T 4, M 4, D 4.5  Nice, extra-light bubble bath head with good lacing. Very light, honey-colored body - quite clear.  Nice floral and grassy hop qualities with a little ""mash tun"" scent to it. The raw power of the malt is very enjoyable.  Taste as advertised - well-balanced but powerful, tangy bitterness with ""stewed"" malt overtones. Alcohol is in the background.  Very good balance on the mouthfeel - not too light, not syrupy by any means.  This stuff is a pleasure to drink - maybe not quite a session effort but very close.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Aroma: It has a pleasant aroma, typically hoppy for an IPA. Citrus is most dominant.  Mouthfeel: Thin- to medium-bodied. Some oiliness on the lips and moderate carbonation.  Taste: Bitter but not particularly well-balanced. The taste is not particularly interesting nor nuanced. The aftertaste is one of the worst I've had in a ""craft beer,"" leaving my mouth feeling pasty and my tongue feeling like it does when I have just woken up in the morning.

287,1093,sgoodship,4.38,"Picked this up at the Liquor Stop in Highland, Indiana after a visit to 3F. Batch 8796 told me that this was packaged on October 22.  A: Very yellow hazy amber. Big two finger fluffy yellowy white head. Instant lacing as the head recedes which gets even more impressive as the drink progresses - intricate at the top and big topographical throughout.  S: Nice fresh grassy hops. Slight grapefruit but not too pronounced. Floral but not as much as I was expecting from the description. Smell has a nice dryness to it. Very solid and comforting.  T: First experience was a nice aggressiveness to the hops up front that leads to a nice maltiness and a hoppy aftertaste. As the drink progressed, I got a bite, a slight citrus fruitiness up front, the malt took on a more dry breadiness in the middle and the finish was a lip smacking hop bitterness that also hits your palette.  M: Very light, fresh, clean and refreshing mouthfeel.  D: I have yet to have a Bells that I didn't like. I do like an IPA that isn't scared to have hops completely dominate malt. Balance is not required for my enjoyment. I found this brew to be extremely enjoyable and although it is not the top of my list, it is certainly up there with my favorite IPA's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A richer smell than some hoppy beers. Still floral and a little citrus, but there's sweetness in this one as well.  It has a decent balance of hops and malt. Plenty of bright citrus and bitter grapefruit peel, not spicy, but bitter. And there's malt sweetness on the front end, but it doesn't stand up to the hops. The hop character isn't quite special enough to get excited.  Mouthfeel is a bit thicker than most, but still pretty typical IPA.

This beer leaves a pretty decent lace as it recedes down the glass.  Aroma is predominately grapefruit hops and a sort of floral spice, some fruitiness detected as well (in addition to the citrus).  The flavor starts out with a nice citrus hop zestiness, and ends with a delightful touch of bitterness with a nice malt background. Very well balanced.  This beer has a moderate body with some nice carbonation. Feels quite creamy on the tongue but has an overall dry finish. A very refreshing beer, that leaves a nice little grapefruit note on the palate.

I've been assured this is the most recent batch and that it's as fresh as the night is young.  Poured into a snifter the beer is a medium gold with a two finger head. I watch it recede after 3 minutes to yield perfect, thick lacing in a consistent pattern all over the glass. This is a great looking IPA.  The aroma is of ripe apricots, citrus, and passion fruit. Pine resin is also present in the nose, but to a lesser extent. Taste is bitter up front. There is a small malt backbone underneath the hops, but not too much to make this an sweet IPA. This is definitely west coast style but there is a some balance in Two Hearted. The bitterness is medium-medium high. The hop flavor is very nice and has notes of bitter grapefruit, apricot, and lemon.  The finish is clean, dry, and low on bitterness ; it leaves my mouth and lips sticky and a faint citrus aftertaste lingers. Two Hearted is light-medium bodied.

287,1093,koopa,4.05,Bottle received in a trade with JohnTravolta21 thanks for the hopportunity!  Appearance: A touch on the yellow side for an IPA but nice oily foam head that retains well and exhibits nice lacing.  Smell: Some centennial hops but a touch faded. I'm starting to think that this bottle is a bit dated.  Taste: A bit bitter which is what holds me back from giving it a 4.5 in the taste category. Sweet pale malt works with the carbonation to create a buttery element.  Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation makes this one nice and creamy. Medium body.  Drinkability: Carbonation and a medium body make this fairly easy to drink for an IPA. The hops being a touch bitter works against the drinkability.  Again I don't think I got the freshest bottle so I will sample another bottle in the future and review it again. I know that JohnTravolta21 sent me the bottle straight off of the shelf but perhaps the retail store had it sitting around for a while or perhaps Bells skimped a bit on this batch due to a hop shortage....,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Settles to a hazy orange color with a fluffy white head.  S - I could smell this beer even before getting close to the pint. Big citrus aroma up front - more grapefruit than anything else. Maybe a little biscuty as well. I picked up on some grassy scents as the beer warmed.  T - The first flavor that I notice is orange. It has a hop bite that that sticks around long after the beer is swallowed. I'm not getting much a malt presence.  M - Much smoother than other IPAs that I have had. Finishes very crisp and dry.  D - Very easy to drink. Alcohol is masked well. I could sit down with this beer for a nice long session.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,semihobo,3.41,"12 oz, batch 8752 bottled 9/16/08, let it warm for a while out of the fridge.  Pours with a huge head, looks like whipped egg whites, settles slowly into a perfect formed head. Quite concave, like a satellite dish. Good lacing. Nice cloudy dark peach color, brew appears totally still, otherwise would be a 5... lacing on the sides of the glass is out of control.  Smell is a mix of pine resin and citrus. A varied hop profile. Malts are light and sweet, a bile note sneaks in from somewhere though as it warms...  Taste is tough to pin down. Definitely bitter but not abrasive, the hops are not as nuanced as in the smell, just straight centennial. Much drier than expected. Straight pale malts don't make the best complement to the hops. Lots of pine resin.  Finish is dry. Sticky and full-bodied, perhaps a little too much so.  I was still finding new tastes when I finished the glass and the alcohol is well-hidden, will happily continue drinking this when I can get it. Above average.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,avalon07,4,"A: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had an amber color and a slightly cloudy consistency. There was a decent amount of head and good lacing.  S: A sweet smell of hops and citrus, more than anything else.  T: Not a strong, overpowering taste, but well done. Hops, grapefruit and mild malt.  M: A fairly high rate of carbonation and a dry finish. Medium-bodied.  D: Overall, this is a likable, drinkable beer. Not the most stunning of IPAs, but tasty nonetheless.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,yemenmocha,4.92,"Pours slightly hazy off-gold color with contrasting white head that retains fairly well.  Nose is predominately grapefruit, maybe with some apricot. Very FOCUSED and clean.  Palate is pleasantly sharp with the hops up front, just like a real grapefruit is in sharpness. This is a very assertive beer. The malt is doughy-bready, with a good amount of salt & consequent mouth puckering sensation. Finish leans more towards the dry side of things, with the dry grapefruit bitterness having the final say.  Some may say this beer is one dimensional and lacks complexity, but like fine single malts the nice focus & concentration of this beer on the Centennial hops is a pure delight.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,LilBeerDoctor,4.44,"Reviewed on 5/10/08. Bottle. Pours a light orange/amber with a thick white head. Aroma of floral, citrus hops (orange, grapefruit, lemon), and a slight hint of pine. Awesome, awesome aroma...it just beckons to you! Flavor of hops upfront, followed by sweet malt with some wheat notes at the finish. Also got some lemon zest. Perfectly balanced- the hops do not overdominate as they do in other IPAs. Mellow, super-drinkable, well-crafted. No bitter finish. Simply superb. 10/4/9/4/16 (4.3/5)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,tadowdaddy,4.48,"A- Light orange colored with 2 fingers of head with excellent retention. Lacing is tremendous.  S- Fruity (citrus) and flowery.  T- My go to beer. Is a very well balanced, frity and flowery ale. The hops are not overly strong, yet they do stick out. I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. Very well balanced with a bit of a malty backend. One of my favorite beers to drink due to the outstanding balance.  M- Is more thick than you would imagine, and leaves a wonderful aftertaste in your mouth.  D- Six.. easily. No problem at all. My favorite session beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,imagineiii,3.88,"A: poored into an imperial pint glass. solid 3 finger head, maintains very well leaving a fluffy white swiss cheese lace. carbonation is very consistent, nice amber color.  S: hop acidity, citrus, lightly sweet.  T: sweet for a non-imperial IPA. citrus to the point of being tart and very well balanced but simple.  M: Light carbonation, thin for an ipa. hops dont dominate the palate but they stick around for the aftertaste.  D: as session-able as an ipa can be.  if this beer was as ubiquitous as SNPA, Id order this when Im at bars that dont have much better. But its not, and if Im stuck in a bar like this, Ill continue ordering my SNPAs. glad I tried this beer, but Im not too upset that I dont know when Ill have my next one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MasterSki,4.37,"Batch 8636 from July 24th, 2008. Poured into a mug.  A - This is the second bottle of Two-Hearted that has bubbled over as soon as I opened it. Not sure why this keeps happening, as they both sat relatively undisturbed for quite a while. Apricot color with bright white head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving a creamy big-bubbled lace.  S - Sweet citrus, hops, some malt, a little bit floral with a hint of pine. Good balance of bitter and sweet elements.  T - Heavy hop bitterness at the front, then melts into a mix of sweet fruits like peach and citrus (grapefruit, orange, etc.). There's a slight malt character that I get mid-palate that doesn't linger very long. Very good, but not sublime.  M - Has the thickness that I demand out of my beer. No reason that IPAs shouldn't be viscous or creamy too. Not overly carbonated (perhaps because it all came out when I opened the brew?), and very smooth.  D - Bell's - please bring these back to Illinois! This is much more sessionable than Hopsolution. Second only to Masala Mama in this regard. You can't taste the 7% at all, and it's super refreshing to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,hoppheadIPA,4.55,"Poured out deep golden orange. It developed a moderate head that settled back down to soapy bubbles that stuck to the side of the glass nicely..  Flowery citrus hops with a slight malt.  Tasted like fresh cut grapefruit, flowers, and a hint of malt in the backround.  Mouthfeel is great with good carbonation. Has a grapefruity aftertaste that I love.  It's an excellent example of the IPA...This is a ""go to"" beer in my fridge. I love it!!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,swizzlenuts,4.35,"With a nice inch head and tan/golden coloured beer, Bell's Two Hearted looks like a stunning IPA. The head has great retention and lacing. IPAs should have a nice big hoppy nose in my opinion, and this one doesn't go away from it, but what is different about this beer is the type of hops that come out; it's a fruity mixture with the malts, which I like quite a bit. The taste of two hearted isn't exactly what one would expect from an IPA, but that doesn't mean it's not great. The bitterness comes through at the end but the flavour is kind of like the nose, meaning that the hops and the malts play off of each other in a way that neither of them are in control of the beer; however, it's still quite obvious the beer is an IPA though. It also has a nice sweetness that comes through, which is kind of unexpected, but ace nonetheless! The mouthfeel is what an IPA should be! Very fucking drinkable!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,corby112,4.85,"Served cask-conditioned at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia, PA.  One of the best examples of a well balanced IPA. Pours a hazy golden orange with a foamy white head.

S: Strong, flowery and citrusy. It definitely gives the impression of being an IPA  T: Citrusy and hoppy. Smelling it, I was expecting a strong IPA but found it fairly mild by the genre's standards.  M: Fairly thick and smooth with a slight fizz. I think the feel is probably the strongest point of this brew.  D: It finishes nice, but is a fairly heavy beer. I think it'd be hard to put back more than two of these. In small doses, it's very nice.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bamadog,4.69,"I have had this on tap previously, and I wish that I would have reviewed it then, but alas, I didn't have anything to write with at the time -- however, it is still exceptional in the bottle as well.  Appearance: Light amber in color, a very little bit of cloudiness to it, and a strong head from the pour -- I would say a little over two fingers. The head lingered for a while and shrunk to a solid lacing that lasted the entire glass.  Smell: Nice hops, and fruity -- I would say apple - so much so in fact that I would say it smelled just a little bit like a cider.  Taste: I'm a big fan -- a nice hearty ale that is wonderfully bitter. When I had it on tap, I would say it tasted a little like a Ruination, but in the bottle it doesn't come across as closely or as strong.  Mouthfeel: Exactly what I would expect from the smell -- at first it makes you salivate, then it dries relatively quickly. It doesn't feel heavy at all, which leads me too...  Drinkability: An outstanding brew -- I became a fan when I had it on tap and I will always feel good about buying this when I come across it. It doesn't feel too heavy at all, so I could easily use this as a session beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MTNboy,4.06,When I first poured this beer it I took a shot of the beer right a way and it hit me like a bitter bullet. I then finished pouring the rest of it into my glass. It was a little lighter than a lot of IPA's. It had a dark bras colored body not as bronze as I would have thought. There was a lot of tan head and lace. This is a very frothy beer. It has a great floral and citrus hop aroma. It smells almost like a roadside fruit stand when the fruit is fresh. The taste is bitter but not as wild as the beer sits. The flavor is a lot like the smell. I'll be honest I am not always an IPA guy but this is one I enjoyed.

It smells quite hoppy. I also picked on a slight citrus aroma. The hops are very present. I taste almost no malty characters at all. Just a lot of hops. This beer is carbonated quite nicely.

Noticeable hops on the tongue, along with sizzling citrus notes, and a lingering, phenolic, bite of plastic.  It, starts out brightly on the palette, but the phenols deaden the tongue on the finish, as it grows a bit soapy.

Smells of a little nuttiness and a hint of citrus. You get some hops smell but not overpowering for this IPA.  Tastes great - you get the nut flavor and the hop finish. The hops don't bite at you but are quite smooth which is a little different for an IPA. I like the Bell's beers because they are deep with complexity. Great smells and many, many tastes.

287,1093,Bounty628,4.42,"Two Hearted Ale is brewed in the American IPA style and comes in with an ABV of 7.0%. Brewed in Michigan, the beer is quite difficult to find in the Boston area, but if you can find yourself a six pack of the Two Hearted Ale do not let this one pass you by.  The beer pours a very robust amber color with hues of orange mixed in. When poured into a standard pint glass, a remarkable almost creamy off white foam was produced that left a light wispy lacing along the pint glass throughout the offering. There is a very light level of carbonation to Two Hearted Ale which lends to the smooth consistency of the pour.  The aroma upon being poured is immediately noticed. There is a rich floral scent that is appreciated along with a hunt of grapefruit and pine. One can tell that there is going to be a pleasant hop nature to this beer just upon the pouring of it.  As with any good beer, one can only hope that it is the taste that will truly shine with the beer. And you can rest assured that the taste of the Two Hearted Ale is a true bright shining beacon in the beer world. A complex taste hides the fact that this is an IPA at first because there is an initial smooth taste to the beer that again is noted with the grapefruit undertones. However, give the beer a second to work and the next taste is a very deep and rich hop taste that is what scores this beer so well. The hop nature of the beer brings out a nice bitterness to it but there is still that simple and smooth backing to the beer that is highlighted as well.  The drinkability of this beer is quite high and certainly could be used as a nice session beer even though it comes in with an ABV of 7.0%. There is not an offensive or overly alcohol strong nature to the taste of the beer and the smoothness that holds together the offering adds to the drinkability of the beer. With the pleasant taste and pairing of the sweetness aspects to the hoppy aspects, the beer could be deceiving, though, as it does pack a nice little punch.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

It's just a nice American style IPA.

287,1093,chiefydawg,4.47,"Light gold body with micro particles dancing around busily, giving it a haze. Very well carbonated, as I got to preview the taste from the head running over. Soon recedes to a thin white head with some life to it.  Biscuity grapefruit smell. Very intertwined marriage of the two, where there is a sweet grainy hoppiness that keeps the scent from getting rindy (yes, I'm aware some of these words are not in Websters). Fresh smelling with some delicate apricot.  Same grapefruit, same sweet grain per the smell. Just a little different than many IPAs in that the balance is supreme. Another fine example of a highly-hopped beer that never gets extremely bitter just for the sake of it (not that there is anything wrong with that). Halfway down, the alcohol joins the taste party and fits right in.  This one is deceptive. For starters, it is lighter in color, has a soft mouthfeel, and is carried by a less than than medium body. Then there is the fresh sweetness like somebody added an oz of Centennial to grandma's freshly baked white bread. Oh, and it is twice as strong as your garden-variety light macros. More than one friend of mine has fallen prey to the Two Hearted. Watch out for it on tap because it could become the Two Livered.

Citrus hops hits the palate, but then subsides and allows the malt to introduce itself briefly. Consumption is ended with a nice taste of bitterness.

I traded for two 6'er's of this (from pwoods, thank you sir) and have held off reviewing it because I didn't want to jump headlong into reviewing this beer. The truth remains though, this beer has a perfect hop/malt balance.  Maybe my palate is shellshocked from all the hoppy brews available out here, but I don't taste overpowering hops here as others have. There are hops, to be sure, but what this beer embodies more than any I've tried before is that elusive balance between bright hoppiness and sweet biscuity maltiness.

287,1093,nc41,4.5,"Re Edited - A lot has changed in the NC beer scene since I rated this brew. But the goodness of Two Hearted has not.  Great pour great color nice long lasting head. This one gets me from the 1st sip, hints of orange, maybe tangerine on the citrus side, Nicely bitter and very well balanced without being sweet. Definitely a top tier IPA, that is amazingly stable and consistent. On tap it's pure dynamite, and IMO the best IPA out there in a sea of average. The tap version get's a bump in smell , and taste, vs the bottle which is what I originally rated. IMO damn near perfection on tap..",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BigJim5021,4.48,"This is my be-all, end-all brew; my go-to beer in times of indecision. To put it bluntly, this is my favorite beer on the planet. I've felt this way for years, and my opinion is unlikely to change any time soon. On to the review!  It pours a lovely, hazy copper with a pearl-white head. The lacing is very much abundant.  The aroma is huge citrusy, flowery hops. Hops dominate the smell to the nth degree.  The flavor matches the smell. This stuff is ridiculously hoppy. We're talking massively Godzilla-sized hoppy. It's unbalanced, and I fucking love it for that. The thing is, it's so damned crisp and so damned refreshing that I don't care that the malt footprint is so tiny. There's enough malt in there to leave some smoothness, but I want this to be the treehouse for the hops kids. They can put up their ""No Malts Allowed"" sign. I'm down for one dash of malts in my hop-tastic beer.  The mouthfeel is creamy and medium-bodied. Heavenly, if you will.  I could drink a case of this every day for the rest of my life. Granted, at a deceptive 7% abv, my liver would begin to look like Hans Moleman (look, we've worked two Simpsons references into one review) and I would be smashed off my ass for all of time, but it would be worth it.  To the folks at Bell's Brewery, consider this my love note; my heart poured onto e-paper in ode to your beautiful, perfect libation. I am forever in your debt.  - Hugs n' kisses, Jim.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jraycee,4.12,"Pours a barely hazy dark golden with a thick white head that show some retention and nice lacing. Smell is big sweet citrusy hops, hint of pine and honey. Taste is big flowery citrus hops up front but not completely overtaken by the sweet malty base. Piney bite in the end . Mouthfeel is a little sticky on the end. Drinkability is good, and deceiving for the 7.0% abv.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,yesferro,4.45,"Serving type: Bottle.  You get what you smell, hops and citrus, I loved it. There is nothing bad about this beer, other then it not being available where I live. Slightly bitter taste but the bitterness does not linger at all. I had no clue what I was getting into when I opened this bottle but I truly loved it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,LoRezDave,4.73,"A fantastic IPA. Bell's nailed it.  Two Hearted pours a brilliant clear golden-tan. A big head subsides but hangs around - literaly. The sticky lacing lay's tracks the whole pint through. Thanks to the hops....  The aroma is an immediate waft of hops followed by a slight malt and slight breadiness.  As expected upon tasting - the hops is what hits ya first. Immediately the hops slugged every available taste bud. Not a sharp smack but a dull heavy slug. The amber malt backbone the comes through but relents to the persistent, but very enjoyable, hop flavor.  Mouthfeel is big, full. Slightly slick(?) nah maybe not - whoa more hops! Nice well-rounded mouthfeel. Finish is a lingering and very enjoyable hop taste.  Not a hop-bomb but you'll get a mouthful and won't be disappoined.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,gcarl,3.98,"Pours a nice transparent amber. Hop smell is not in your face but rather faint. a nice white head holds for a moment before falling and leaving some attractive lacing.  Taste is all there. Hop bitterness upfront with a creamy malty follow through, exactly what I look for in a good American IPA.  Drinkability is unbelievable, if this was available in MA it would replace Blue Point's Hoptical Illusion as my go to IPA.  Has everything it needs....nothing it doesn't. A no frills IPA for even the most discerning palate.  GC",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Seanibus,4.42,"This is a really wonderful beer, though I find it is better on tap than in bottles. It is a good example of a West Coast style IPA, with mounts of citrusy and floral hops.  Pours a vivid golden with a big white head and lots of carbonation. The aroma will envelop you - hugely citrusy, mostly grapefruit. The flavor follows right along, intensely grapefruity. The mouthfeel is clingy,leaving a lovely hop bitterness on the finish. Despite it's relatively strong ABV, it is a wildly drinkable beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BamaBeerBuff,4.57,"A: It's a very cloudy peach-amber with a rather sizable ivory colored head that remains rather foamy throughout. Some sticky patches of lace remain behind on the glass.  S: Wow. Incredibly rich grapefruit and tropical fruit aromas unlike almost any other IPA I've had. There's a delicate, sweet, and fresh smell on this unlike most other IPAs. If I could get this as an air freshener, I would.  T&M: Taste is of grapefruit and citrus, with a hint of pine/herbal flavor. A sweet malt base helps to balance the rather intense hop bitterness in an interesting way by making the fruity/citrus hop flavors taste sweeter. Two Hearted Ale is a damn tasty IPA. The body is on the lighter side for an IPA, though I don't feel like it detracts in any way from the flavor (this isn't a DIPA, after all). Still, a fuller body would help one to savor the beer just a bit longer before swallowing.  D: This is an IPA that goes down rather quickly because of its lighter body and nice flavor. Two Hearted Ale is in the top echelon of American IPAs and is a must have for any hop head.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,peck95,4.32,a really good beer and nice representation of a very hoppy non west coast ipa.  a) a little bit pale but nice head retention and awesome lacing s) a good grapefruit hop smell and also a nice biscuit malt aroma t) might be the one of the best combination's of malt and hops found in an ipa not overly hopped like but hoppy and a good sweetness to the malt m) good carbonation and really smooth d) very drinkable except i dont have any more and cant get any more but if i could this would definitly be in the rotation right behind racer 5 and even with a couple of others.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,petebritton2003,4.39,"Orange beer with white head that is gone quickly. Sweet floral aroma with a hoppy freshness. I love centennials. The flavor has nice malt balance with slight toastiness, dominant finish of oranges, grapefruits, and flowers. Almost like PEZ candy. Very refreshing and drinkable. Yum.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,PatronWizard,4.08,Thanks tedstertm!  Well we have an opaque apricot shade of gold. Really nice frothy head. I like when you can't see individual bubbles.  Smells like a good IPA. Some floral hops.  Nice bite with a unique bitterness to it. A certain flavor I don't remember being in other beers of this type. Which probably explains this one's current spot on the BA Top 100.  Overall: good stuff,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Goliath,4.03,Pours a vibrant amber color with decent clarity. A large inch and a half slightly yellowed head sits on top and lingers with great retention leaving some lacing behind.  The aroma is nice. A good bit of hops giving some citrus and pine in the nose. Some caramel as well.  The taste is nice. A nice hop presence giving a bit of a piney taste with a mild bitterness. The malt presence is quite obvious giving a bit of caramel and bread to balance it out.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and adequately carbonated.  Drinkability is moderate to high. Easy to drink and enjoy.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ruckzuck,4.5,"A friend from DC brought me this, and I'm totally amped on trying it!  A - pours a nice hazy dark gold body with a thick and pillowy head. Makes me want to drive right in!  S - floral and piney hops really dominate. Definitely some citrus and grapefruit aroma in there as well. Smells great!  T - wow! A bit more bitter citrus in the taste than in the nose, but the pine really stands out. Utterly delicious. There's a light maltiness holding everything together, but hops are the star here and man oh man are they doing an excellent job. Aftertaste is nice and bitter, but not overly so. Well done, Bell's  M - medium bodied, but not as heavy as other American IPA's. Plenty of carbonation. Goes down quite well, and the aftertaste really is good  D - incredible! I now see why my DC friend buys this stuff all the time. Bell's: COME TO GEORGIA! Can't recommend this enough if you're a fan of American IPA's. Delicious, balanced, and completely drinkable.

287,1093,jtothamo,4.65,"I enjoyed this at The Heorot last Tuesday. This is a beer I tend to come back to more often than not. I enjoy the ""back to nature"" taste of this beer.  Appearance- A light caramel color, with a light, white foamy head.  Smell/Taste- I sometimes get floral overtones in both the smell and taste of this beer. This particular tasting was a little soapy (which had more to do with the glass than anything). However, it was still incredible as the flavorful beer over-powered the dish soap. Slightly bitter.  Mouthfeel- Light carbonation, playful!  Drinkability- I enjoy this beer. It's definitely not a beverage for lite beer drinkers. I think it is an exceptional beer that should definitely be consumed...great around a campfire!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,kels,4.39,"Had this on-tap at Mulligan's in Rookwood last night. Poured into a hot, straight-from-the-dishwasher pint glass:( Don't think it messed with the beer too much, though, as it was still pretty damn good.  Appearance: Bright golden yellow with carbonation bubbles running throughout. Very thin white frothy head that held the entire time I drank it. Enormous sticky lacing all over the glass.  Smell: Very bright and citrusy with hints of pine, just as I'd expect for an IPA. The citrus smells grapefruity.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The mouth is light to medium with loads of carbonation. Very grassy/piney tastes with loads of citrus. Tastes less like grapefruit than it smelled - more like orange and tangerine, maybe even lime. Bitter, but not nearly as much as other IPAs I've tried. Actually pretty nicely balanced.  Drinkability: Pretty high for an IPA - goes down very smoothly and the carbonation makes it really fresh and light-tasting.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,SmithwicksNut,4.42,Appearance: A very nice white thick foamy head which lingered throughout the beer. The lacing was a beautiful sight on the side of the glass. The color was gold and cloudy (similar to an unfiltered wheat).  Smell: A sweet floral high hop aroma with a hint of citrus. The hop aroma never realy faded and stayed all through drinking the beer.  Taste; The taste was a great hop taste. It was clean and enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: Was rich and full not overly carbonated.  Drinkability: This a very good beer. It was one of the best I have had recently.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,luciusgilmer,4.75,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.  A: Pours with rich golden cloudy color and a fizzy seeming head. The head lasts a short time. A nice opaque color.  S: Strong, hoppy smell. If you like this sort of really hoppy beer, and I do, this is a very strong beer to consider. Lovely, floral, fresh. A bit citrusy, but not so much as Bell's Oberon.  T: In the last year, this has become my favorite beer, though I have had other IPA's without considering it one of my favorite styles. It's got a surplus of taste, if anything. Crisp.  M: This beer fills the mouth; no awful cloyingness. Just the right carbonation.  D: Its smooth, balanced flavor makes it very drinkable, though it's more of a half session beer for me due to its 7.0 ABV.  Not sure if this is the best IPA out there, but that's what these reviews are for, and it's certainly a contender.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Greggy,4.7,"A- Pours a nice 2 finger head that leaves some nice sticky lace as it recedes. Although the lacing recedes, it has a nice fluffy cap throughout. The body is a shade above golden with some minimal sediment.  S- Nice pine, grapefruit aroma with a great malty bready backbone.  T- Starts thick and creamy with notes of light pine and citrus hops then moves into a nice light caramel-breadiness and finishes dry. This is the definition of balance.  M- Great thick feel and carb spot on.  D- The 7% is very well hidden in this brew, and although it's not sessionable, it's damn drinkable. It's odd it took me so long to review this as I have had it quite a few times. I will be enjoying again in the future.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,brantadid,4.21,"Poured a cloudy amber/orange color with a huge 3 finger white fluffy head. Lacing coated the entire inside of the glass.  Nose is completely dominated by citrus aromas. Not the most pungent of beers. The nose is actually a little disappointing.  The taste is ridiculous. Tons of hop flavors. Citrus rind and grapefruit dominate the taste. Pine presents around the mid palate. Nice slightly sweet maltiness hides underneath the hop profile. Remarkably well balanced.  Mouthfeel is rich and full. not overly carbonated which lends to the rich, but not viscous mouthfeel.  Overall, a very drinkable beer. In fact, one of the most drinkable IPAs I have ever tasted.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,NittanyBeerFan,3.48,"A: pours an almost standard lightish tone of what you would expect from an IPA. when poured down the middle of the glass it gives a 2 finger head that lingers and laces down the side of the glass.  S: underwhelming smell of hops with undertones of fruit, but predominantly hops.  T: The taste hits you harder with hops that the smell would lead on. Tastes of both piney and citrusy hops that as the beer warms, become more evident.  M: smooth feel with a little bit of carbonation. subsides as the beer gets lower in the glass  D: although I rarely consider IPAs session beers, I could see myself sitting down and drinking a bunch of these. The beer is light enough in texture that you can sit down and really feel this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,dancinwillie,3.82,"yellow pour, with a big rocky beige head. Aroma is citrus hops. Flavor is dominated by hops, citrusy, piney, big hop bite. Minimal malt profile, not enough to detract, but enough to be known. Full mouthfeel, just short of chewy.  I've had this on tap before, and IMO, it's a better beer than bottled. I'll surely drink this again, as it's still a fine beer, but given the choice, I'd take it on tap over bottled.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Reagan1984,3.91,"Beautiful looking beer. I picked up a six pack on a recent trip to Madison, WI.  After hearing about this so much, I was quite excited to give it a try.  I poured this into one of my Smuttynose tulip glasses to be sure to enjoy the aromas etc. The beer poured with a beautiful creamy head that rose about a ½ inch above the rim of the glass. It had pretty nice retention before settling back into the beer. An 1/8 inch skim of foam remained for the balance of the beer's life. You can tell this is a lacing monster. Color was a slightly cloudy honey amber color with orange highlights. Could not see any carbonation.  Aroma was very nice and really had a lot of grapefruit and citrus notes. You could also detect some of the grains in the aroma which over all was very fresh in nature.  This is indeed a nice beer. Nicely balanced with a citrus flavor that reminds me of peaches, oranges or nectarines.... Something like that. There is graininess to the taste that is interesting. The hop notes at the end are very interesting and the finish is quite dry.  Mouth feel is medium/Light in body and it's quite drinkable.  I've heard some insane comments about this beer like it was one of the best in the country. I'm sorry it's not. It's good. Very good. But there is a long lost of IPA's that I would run to before this one.  That being said, I'll enjoy the balance of the six pack.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The beer presents with a 1/2 inch off-white head that is quite long lasting, as it has been present for over 5 minutes now. The beer has a cloudy appearance and copper in color. A strong hoppy aroma with floral and citrus scents. A strong hop flavor presents as a clean drinking beer with a quite dry finish. Although dry and bitter, it is very smooth. Overall, a great tasting IPA with good balance and likely to make most beer and IPA lovers happy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Also smell some bubblegum, watermelon, grass and lime zest. Smells fresh, sharp and clean.  Taste is of mega-citrusy hops. Also some underlying eath tones. A rather easy drinking IPA. Has a clean, dry finish that doesnt leave that resinous stickiness on the tongue. Carbonation is high.  A very nice IPA, quite drinkable and is not over the tops with hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Has a magnificent thick 2 inch head (off white) that is rocky with good retention. Hazy and effervescent.  S: Very strong floral hop aroma. Caramel like malt aroma that is sweet is noticeable in the background. There is some grapefruit character here but it takes a back seat to the floral elements in the nose.  T: Floral and grapefruit hop character. Medium high bitterness is fantastically smooth. Malt flavor is clearly present with a caramel character.  MF: Moderate light body with a dry mouthfeel. No astringency. Moderate carbonation.

Copious strands of sticky lacing with strong legs. Scent is floral hops and citrus. Primary flavors consist of hops, citrus and a piney essesnce. Also picked up a feint sweetness as well a biscuity quality and some residual spice that is difficult to place. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a pronounced carbonation burn.

Brilliant piney hops shooting through with grapefruit citrus tones at their side. Very floral, probably the most floral single IPA I've ever had. A very crisp and well-balanced nose. The hops seem to be as well used in bell ipas if not better than any I've tasted. They just strike the perfect note here for me; piney, farmhouselike, and faintly smoky at the end. Citrus is still present, grapefruit in this case. A mild nuttyness. This is one distinct ipa and really something special. Mouthfeel is a very crisp and deliberate light-medium body.

Upon opening the bottle delicious aromas filled the air, this is a great beer that you can just enjoy from aroma.  T- Much like the aroma hoppy goodness takes control, citrus fruits. Definitely a slight malty sweetness.  M- Medium-light body with moderately high carbonation. This may mask the sweetness giving more of a dry finish. Slight citrusy aftertaste.  D- Yes.

287,1093,soulgrowl,4.7,"Appearance: Tall, strong, meringuey ivory-yellow head that lasts quite a long time, and appears quite Belgian in structure. Body is orange and finely clouded.  Smell: Very yummy hops giving off a wide range of flavors - orange zest, lemon, mint, lavender, and a distinct, zesty note of ginger (very nice). Floral, citric, spicy - a bright and winsome hop bouquet backed by honey, gingerbread, and deliciously juicy caramel apple notes.  Taste: All those bright, tasty hop flavors from the nose are here, with an emphasis on orange. Despite hop dominance throughout, the sweetness adequately balances but never cloys, while providing a fruity, juicy sweet flavor. A hint of cinnamon and clove adds to the complexity and lush sweet-and-spicy character.  Mouthfeel: Very dry and medium bodied; well-tuned to the flavor.

287,1093,PerzentRizen,4.15,"This was the first and only so far beer I have had from Bell's. I have to say I am very impressed. A great buddy and fellow BA recommended this one since he knows I love IPA's and that Dogfish Head 90 minute is my favorite. He said this was better than DFH-90, but I have to say it does fall a little short of that mark for me. Don't get me wrong I loved the beer, but it did not have that fruity lick your lips dimension.  This beer was poured into a Duvel glass and had a nice 1 inch head that dissapated into a thin lacing that never left. So far, so good! The smell was good with a clean hoppy, but not overbearing aroma. This calls to you and says - ""don't be scared, I won't bite."" This is definately a cross-over beer for anyone afraid of IPA's.  The mouthfeel is a little watery for my liking. I think it is refreshing - but you have to understand that my ideal beer is DOUBLE IPA so anything short of a 9% ABV hopped to absolute perfection is going to feel a little watery to me. At least I am honest.  Ok, so back to Bell's 2 Hearted Ale. I think the finish ends a little too abruptly for me. I would like this beer a bit better if it had a little more depth of flavor. But if you are looking for a beer you can basically drink all day and tastes amazing this is it.  I would recommend it to anyone and I would definately buy more than a sixer.

Aroma is mild but fragrant hops, more floral and grassy that citrusy. There's also a lot of malt there, honey, fresh bread, and a hint of lemon juice. Taste is soft, mild, but dominant bitterness, backed by some very flavorful malt that tastes almost like pancakes or waffles. Nice tea-like flavor around the edges.

287,1093,brewmudgeon,4.2,"two-hearted  1/27/11; just picked up some 8 day old 2 hearted. as with the hopslam this year, the nose is a little muted despite the freshness. not as bad as batch, 9725 was it? but it's not the floral punch i was expecting. still a very good and friendly ipa. looking forward to getting some fresh lakefront and letting these 2 go head to head--over the course of several batches.  4.5 orangy amber, great lacing 4.5-5 pine, mixed citrus, abundance, some nougetiness (like smuttynose ipa), something a little puckering in the smell. [of late, though, a bit too much pale sweetness] [then sometimes very little nose at all] 4-4.5 recall thinking this beer seemed a little powdery and challenging, but not this time. there is only the slightest hint of that quality--perhaps a fresher bottle? wonderful flowery citrusy finish. maybe a touch on the sweet side? the batches also vary considerably one to another. not exactly a reliable beer. 4.5 medium body with some hoppy slickness, near perfect carbonation. 4 (from 4.5) yeah, this is a good one for sure. shouldn't have stayed away so long. the first 6-pack was likely old, particularly given the source (b it only). [as of 2010, less impressed despite trying several different batches. never know what you're going to get.]  earlier review:  i don't really care too much what the beer looks like, unless it has the look of infection or total flatness. this one looked fine, though the head was gone pretty quick. earthiness in the smell complementing the cascade aromas calibrated more to the bitterness and earthiness than sweetness, which i often appreciate in an ipa. there may be something of a powdery quality, or does it just get so dry it seems that way? either way, i find it pleasant. the carbonation is lively but not overdone, and the body is about medium. the firm bitterness and drying finish generally help drinkability, but this one can be puckering and demanding on the palate.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,wheatyweiss,4,"Poured into a standard pint.  Pours a medium straw, with a nice pillowy head that recedes slowly.  Aroma is of hops up front and caramel malt. Sweet clover honey and yeast.  Taste is astringent hops FOLLOWED by malt. Piney, citrus hops with a grassy fresh bite. Caramel malt with a biscuit flavor that rides in the background. Hops are a little overpowering here. The hops make the beer a little soapy, almost acidic.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, good and clean.  A good ale. Not great, good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,RedChrome,4.03,"A cloudy orange colored body. White thick head was and inch and a half and faded slowly. A few streams of average sized carbonation. Sticky clumps of lace.  A very nice hops oil aroma was strong up front. Pine needle scents blended very nice with a light citrus blend. A very minor sweet biscuit presence in the very end.  A super hop explosion. Citric flavors are mainly grapefruit. Pine resin taste is a bit subdued from the aroma. A minor bread taste, but slightly underpowered.  A sticky thick fluid on the surfaces. Carbonation has a hard time holding against the thickness.  A very good brew. Great with a plate of mild buffalo wings. A nice offering from Bell's. A bit unbalanced, but some good flavors nonetheless.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mashedpotatoes,2.7,"Appearance is orange-ish haze. Head wells up to a solid 3 finger pillow on a regular pour. Smell is incredibly citrusy. Taste is even more citrusy, like a mixture of lemon and orange rinds. Lots of complicated floral notes but most notably are the hops, just exploding all over the place. Mouthfeel is not bad, average thickness with actually quite a pleasant aftertaste. Drinkability is just average I would say due to the complicated flavor and high Abv%.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Biggness,4.45,"This beer pours a semi cloudy amber with a 2 fingered head with tons of lacing. The smell is very nice, hints of vanilla and citrusy hops. The flavor as well is very nice, I only get a hint of the vanilla which I got from the nose, a wonderful level of citrusy hops mixed in with a solid malt backbone. The mouthfeel is nice, I did a heavy pour and it still seems a little overcarbonated. A highly drinkable beer and I wish it was available on Long Island!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,changeup45,4.35,"Pours a cloudy, orange color with a moderate sized off-white head. Aroma is very floral hoppy with citrus fruits.

I'd definitely get it again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ClassicBrad,4.32,"One of my favorite IPAs and a great brewery. The beer is a hazy, burnt orange with a healthy head that simmers down to a sticky lacing, smells primarily of citrusy, tart hop presence, and drinks like a beautifully balanced IPA.

287,1093,SilentSabre,3.72,"Part of a haul the the guy across the road from me brought back from a trip he took. Many thanks to him (Bill) for sharing a few bottles with me. This looked okay, but honestly, I expected a little bit darker colour. Head was very nice, though, being a white, pillowy, froth that stuck around for a good 4 minutes. Perhaps longer. It could be a shade or two darker, but head retention was unmatched! Smell was freshly sawn pine timber. Period. Lots of hops in the nose. Maybe a modest measure of grapefruit rind, but I got mostly pine resin. Nice, if it is a hop explosion that you seek. Hop flavour is actually much more modest than I was anticipating up front, then becoming a bit more assertive in the middle, with a nice, even if a little muted, malt character showing itself a few seconds after you swallow. Somewhat balanced, I suppose. A good beer that I am very glad I finally got the opportunity to try.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Taste - A full on bright, citrus hoppiness up front. Highly carbonated with a nice smooth bubblebath mouthfeel. Lingering earthy bitterness in the aftertaste. As the beer warms more sweet, nutty grains come out, but the hops are the star of this show.  Picked this one up on a vacation to Michigan. This is a great hoppy ale. I was expecting something milder and was pleasantly surprised. Thank you Michigan & Bells.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,CrellMoset,4.08,"On tap at Beer Run in Charlottesville, VA. Served in a traditional American pint glass.  Appearance: A heavily-hazed gorgeous sunset orange beer. A dollop of barely offwhite head lays on top of this one and fades at an average pace, huge sheets of sticky white lacing left in its wake. Truly an attractive and inviting beer.  Aroma: Sweet, crisp but smooth malts, strawberries, orange and lemon notes, faint tropical fruits, floral aromatics,  Taste: Pale, creamy, sweet malts, a steady and solid but not overwhelming level of bitterness, and an array of floral, leafy, and citrusy notes that change as the beer warms. There's plenty of tart citrus and orange zest, a strong herbal note that stays with you throughout the sip, and plenty of lighter estery notes. A pretty complete hop profile, and an impressive array flavors.  Mouthfeel: Very milky and creamy, and therefore necessarily smooth. Not as oily or slick as you'd imagine it probably should be with this level of hops. A pleasant-feeling beer.  Drinkability: I've reviewed this one out of the bottle before - how does it compare on tap? It looks a lot nicer - the colors and head are both superior. Everything else seems to be pretty much the same, however. Guess this is one that holds up well, either way. Not my favorite IPA, but definitely a solid example of the style, and one of the better Bell's brews. Still recommended!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,RustyDiamond,4.65,"Batch 8619 (packaged on 7.10.08) purchased on 08.02.08 from Steve's Licker in Madison, WI. Cloudy orange with a teriffic glowing 2 fingers of near-white head. Smell of citrus, apricots and freshly baked pretzels. A faint touch of wheat on the tip of my tongue, followed by a lovely array of chalky, citrus and pine hop flavor. The flavor is very apparent, yet somehow restrained by the malt that is there. Very long lasting on the palate too, and finishes very hoppy. Touch of soft pretzel malt taste in the mouthfeel, somehow in the middle of the hop beauty. Spotty lacing in the glass. Extremely drinkable for a 7% IPA with this much flavor.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The finish is of a piney hop taste that leaves a dryness feeling  Overall a great IPA",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,GatorBeerNerd,4.72,"A: Pours a beautiful clear copper gold color with a thick frothy white head. It looks like a marketing photo of a beer in the glass. If it had some more lacing, I would give it a 5.  S: An abundance of citrus and piney hop aromas dominate the nose. Orange is the most noticeable of the citrus aromas to me. It has just the right amount of grainy malt aroma to mix with the hops. One of the more pleasantly smelling beers I can recall.  T: This is a very good beer. The hops and malts are extremely balanced. In fact, possibly the most balanced IPA I can recall tasting. The only reason I didn't give this one a 5 is because I was hoping for more of the citrus flavor from the hops instead of the pine flavor. That might be a bit picky, but I would still drink this one as often as possible if I didn't have to get it from another state.  M: Medium body beer with just the right amount of carbonation. It is enjoyable to roll around in the mouth.  D: IPAs may not generally be the most drinkable style with the amount of hops they have. This one is so balanced that the drinkability is outstanding. The alcohol is well hidden in this one as well. I could easily knock back 6 of these (if I could actually buy them here).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,johnd513,4.67,I am reviewing this beer from the bottle but I am also a big fan of the mini kegs which my family traditionally gets around Christmas time. This beer pours an amber color with a huge thick creamy white head. Smells and tastes citrusy (and of course hops!). Orange flavors are present as well as a wonderful chewy hop flavor. The drinkability is high on this one. I could easily drink three of these but the abv is too high for it to be a session beer for me. This beer is very well balanced and has a clean taste to it. This is a beer that I go back to more than others. By far one of my favorite IPA's. Highly recommended.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Lots of citrus hops, also some pine hops mixed with a clear malt backbone. Extremely well balanced and inviting.  And so is the taste. Exceptionally well balanced all the way through. The citrus hops dominate the front with the piney bite in the back, and a crisp sweet maltiness throughout. Outstanding.  Mouthfeel is clean with a light lingering hoppiness. A great sessionable beer, well almost as it's a bit high in ABV but it does not wear out the palate even after a few.  Great beer.

Pours a cloudy dark shade of gold with a thick, creamy, frothy two-finger off-white head that fades very slowly leaving lots of lacing.  There's a lot of floral hops in the aroma, as well as grapefruit, orange zest, mango, and some sweet caramel in the background.  Taste begins with some sweet but bitter grapefruit before some caramel malts balances things out. Lots of grassy, floral hops and citrus flavors, with a bit of toasted bread, before a long, dry, bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and slightly oily.  Just about perfect drinkability.

Great golden color with a good amount of intial fluffy head with quickly disapated.  I was a bit disappointed with the aroma. Not bad but it did not have floral hoppy smell that I was expecting from this style.  Despite the lack of floral hops. This brew did not disappoint with the hoppy flavor. Very well balanced hoppiness. Just bitter enough. Grassy piney and delicious.  Extremely drinkable. I could drink this all night long.  My first Bell's beer. Hopefully it will not be my last.

287,1093,kinger,4.47,"Utterly awesome, this is another great example of what an IPA should be. Aroma is floral, citrusy, piney and hoppy, sweet and malty I could sniff this for a long time. Pour is a nice golden copper with a creamy thick white head and nice lacing. Mouthfeel is medium thick and really smooth with a creamy finish. Flavor is an intense mixture of malts and hops, truly remarkable. The drinkability of this is good the strong hop presence doesn't become overly bitter. Fantastic!

287,1093,usmittymc,5,"Picked this up at a little beer/ liqour store in Perdido Key, FL.  Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass.  A: Deep amber/ orange color with a chunky white head that would probably linger for days on end.  S: Floral, fruity hops. A little grainy malt is present as well.  T: Wow. This is the most balanced IPA that I have tried. The fruity, juicy hop taste can immediately tackle any thirst and it is supported well by a blanced malt back. I would argue, perfectly balanced.  M: Moderate mouthfeel, not slick, not chewy. Perfect, I would say.  D: I really wish that I didn't have to travel to get this beer. It has easily become one of my top five favorites. There is nothing cloying about this one. It is perfection in a bottle. The 7% ABV makes it a little less sessionable, but it was quite nice kicking back 6 of these while sitting on the balcony of the condo each night.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

With a pillow of off white, kaki head. Good lacing.  Aroma was to be expected for an IPA. Pine and citrus dominated.  Taste was like chewing hops! LOVED IT! Had a slight grapefruit note, and with a well balanced malt flavor. Finished dry, with some bread/yeast notes.  A great everyday IPA. I love IPA's and this is one of my favorites so far!!!!

It smelled like lots of floral and grassy hops, with a bit of caramel malt. It tasted like floral and grassy hops with sweet peach and a bit of malt. It was oily with no carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this was much better than my first sampling. It was delicious and clean and makes me want to drink more and more of it.

287,1093,Zadok,3.95,"Couldn't get in a build a sixer so purchased a six pack in hopes that it was as good as the reviews.  Poured a nice deep orange amber with a monstrous semi off-white head and mild lacing.  Hop explosion at first whiff with a mild citrus fragrance.  A nice quantity of hop flavor with a tinge of bitter aftertaste rounds out this brew.  The palate feel is also quite nice, mild carbonation and smooth aftertaste makes for a refreshing brew.  Defiantly has a nice summer ale quality, can picture sitting on some coastal waters while sucking these down.

287,1093,gonzo46and2,3.21,Second time I've tried this one.  Golden copper color with a big fluffy head.  Smell is grapefruit and pineapple from the centennial hops. (PS NOT MY FAVORITE HOPS)  Taste is very bitter and unbalanced. You could say it's great for hop heads but that would only be for cent hop heads. I tend to like the IPAs that use more than one hop variety aside from the double simcoe from weyerbacher. Still a decent IPA but I doubt I'll buy a third bottle for a long time.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Durge,4,"A cloudy straw-amber color with a frothy good head of white and excellent lacing. The aroma is a polite touch of lemony/grapefruit hops with a malty caramel underlayer and a hint nutmeg. The taste is quite bitter with a more floral/lemony hops and plenty of it. There's a candy malt touch but it's very light. This is a bright bitterness with fine carbonation, easy drinking if you're fond of hops. I get a slight popcorn sense under the bitterness. The feel is fairly medium body for a brew that is so sharp. This didn't strike me as being quite so good as it is on tap. I think it was a little mellower on tap, but this is definitely still very good stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Much more malty than I expected but still excellent.  Pairs well with BBQ, got me some gates BBQ and its a great accompanist.  Smell feel and mouth feel are all above average for this beer.  Somewhat similar to Odell's IPA but with more of a fuller feeling. I don't know what it is but it more ""thick"".  Awesome beer, glad I picked up a 12 pack so I have a few to share and enjoy over the weekend!  Pick this up if you can!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Bubba83,4.06,"Thanks for the bottle Kegatron!  Poured this batch #8444 (bottled in april) into a Deschutes Tulip glass. The pour was essentially perfect. The right amount of head for the speed of the pour. Bright white foamy head with tiny smooth bubbles rising from the bottom of the hazy orange peach color that eminates through with some haze. Lacing is semi-spider web but doesn't stick all that crazy. Nice that a thin line of head will stick around until we finish the glass.  Smells quite malty for an IPA with a spicy kind of hop presence. It doesn't make you work for the smell, as it is in your face, but I just prefer my IPAs to smell a little more floral than this one did. Still, the smell is good.  Tastes like a big malt backbone as was implied by the smell. Think Dogfish Head 90 Minute or Great Divide Hercules, it's a very similar tasting malt backbone. Definitely done in the east coast style but I do adore these IPAs almost as much as the west. Flavor fades into a little bit of floral/citrus, but doesn't hang there for long as an earthy/spicy kick dominates through to the finish.  I was in between 4.0 and 4.5 on the mouthfeel. I feel like it seems a tad thin at times for the flavor it packs, and there could be a tad more carbonation as well. It loses 0.5 for each.  Good drinkability because it's so smooth, yet I was actually a little surprised it was 7% because I thought it was a little higher by the way it went down. Overall I'd rather have Hopslam because of the endless complexities in comparison, but still a damn fine example of an American IPA bordering on Double IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,maltusaurelius,4.62,"I've been drinking this beer since the early 90s (I grew up in Grand Rapids MI) and it was my first IPA experience. My review may be biased by the fact that this beer is my reference point for the style. I'm glad it's become available here in DC.  I drank this one poured from a bottle into a tall, somewhat narrow beer mug.  Appearance: Starts with the label on the bottle, which depicts a trout over a background of flowing a flowing stream - very cool. I don't know who designs Bell's bottle labels but they deserve some sort of award (the snowy owl on the best brown ale is one of the ""best"" labels in beerdom). The beer pours a hazy deep golden color with a huge rocky head that dissapates slowly and leaves lacing down the glass.  Aroma is of piney, floral, citrus hops. The piney scent is fitting for a brew from Michigan.  Taste is dry with an immediate, evergreen, prickly hop presence. If you look for it you will detect doughy malts behind the hops. Definitely a beer that hopheads will like - it's on the dry side but they've piled on just enough malt.  Mouthfeel is lively, almost prickly, due to the high hop content, but with a smooth finish. I could (and have) drink these all night long but they do pack a bit of a punch, so I wouldn't go overboard with them. All in all an excellent IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mothman,4.3,"Poured into Sam Adams Sensory Glass.  As I started to open the bottle I could already smell a big amount of hops that this beer had to offer! I was so excited to get that first taste! It poured a nice layer of head that was a little off white and as I drank it, it laced a little bit. The color was a orange bronze.  The aroma was of floral earthy hops. Taste was a massive amount of hops, just like the smell.  Mouth feel was bitter but left a crisp taste in the mouth. Very dry aftertaste as well.  Overall, this is one staple of an IPA. I really enjoy the style and Bell's has a very nice version of it. I highly recommend!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Unbelievable hop flavor/aroma and perfect bitterness to back it up. Hazy super dark golden color and big patchy lacing mesmerize me as I hold my pint up to the window. A couple more savory sips and it's gone already. The hoppiness overpowers the malt but who cares it is so incredibly full of yummy citrusy/floral/zesty hop flavor.

287,1093,jdg204,4.52,"Definetly one of the most hyped IPA's around, I finally ran into a 6'er of Two Hearted and had to give it a try. Been a while since I did a review, but it feels good to be back in the game.  Appearance - Nice medium orange color with a plump white head that stays creamy the entire drink.  Smell - Nice hop/ citrus mix, with a hint of pine underneath.  Taste - Very bold hop character tends to overwhelm the flavor and the pine flavor tends to drown out what should be a good citrus burst.  Mouthfeel - Hops are heavy again, not bad, but you need to be careful what you pair this with. Indian or other spicey foods would be a perfect fit.  Drinkability - Not sure if this review is a bit jaded by my sky high expectations, but this was just a decent brew. Now I don't mean to say it's crappy, but in the wide world of great micro-IPA's, this just doesn't rank up there with Stone, 60 minute, and HopDevil.

The aroma is comprised of a fresh, floral hop character with even a hint of mint in the nose, accompanied by a bready malt character. The aroma of hops is nearly intoxicating to this hophead.  The taste is very smooth and the breadiness of the malt peeks out from the strong, floral hop bitterness. Only a hint of citrus/grapefruit due to the hops.  Mouthfeel is comprised of a smooth hop bitterness and very mild sweetness and breadiness of the malt. Dry, but not overwhelming.  A very drinkable example of the style at only 7%. I can think of only one area where it may fall flat and that's the mouthfeel, which feels somewhat too dry and citrusy. Other than that, this beer is definitely a winner in my eyes.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,smanders,4.08,"Bell's Two Hearted Ale 7.0%ABV  Appearance - cloudy, honey-colored ale. Firm head with nice lacing.  Smell - Sweet, fruity aroma, with a touch of pine.  Taste - smooth texture, hints of spice, and a medley of fruit (apricot, peach) notes.  Mouthfeel - creamy without being sticky.  Drinkability - High. The bottle gets you into a good mood thinking about catching the trout on the bottle and the mood continues throughout the drinking process.

287,1093,otakuden,4.77,"i can sum up Bells Two Hearted Ale in three words: soft. floral. smooth.  bright orange and amber, citrus herbal hop perfume caresses my nose. a very powerful oily hop presence makes itself known before taking even one sip. and then the surprise. bright crisp citrus and flowery hops fill my taste buds, but softly and with a very smooth body (creamy). the oils coat my mouth, rounding out into a bitter burst on the very center of my tongue. amazing. such a strong head, and yet such a delicate balance of hoppy IPA character - flowers, citrus, and pepper. it's like Two Hearted is trying to say to me ""hey. i'm here. i'm hoppy. i'm delicious and complex, more than just a hop bomb being dropped blindly on your senses. take note of the subtle characters and flavors that make me such a delicious IPA. one sip, and i know you will understand.""  and so i say to Two Hearted, i do understand. fish theme included, i would love to be out on the dad's boat, pole in hand, waiting for that adrenaline charging strike and slaking my thirst in the meantime. a great summer refresher ^_^",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,IronCitySteve,4.2,"A: A decent golden color with some amber hints to it. Pretty consistent with other IPA's.  S: Lots of floral hops, citrus and some pine. Also has some malt hints, but nothing too distinguishable.  T: A decent mixture of citrus and pine. The pine seems a tad overwhelming, more so than I thought would occur.  M: A medium bodied beer, with a dry finish. Left pine taste on the palate.  D: I believe many who really enjoy hops, more than I do, would really appreciate the pine hop flavoring. It is too much for me, but it is a decent IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,sorryaboutbrooks,4.68,"This is a great IPA. In my opinion the best way to describe this beer is very well balanced. The hop presence is strong, but the body of the beer is a perfect match to create a fusion between hop and sugars for a homogeneous beer. Does that even make sense? I dunno, but this is a great IPA I would recommend it to anyone!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DrunkenMaster,3.68,"On tap at Coles. Clear golden amber with a quickly diminishing, nicely laced head. Aroma is floral hops with grapefruit. Moderately bitter with more grapefruit and a nice malt backbone. Good beer to drink while you sit around and play darts all night. Its also a good beer to drink with chicken wings.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TheMistler,4.09,"A deep golden color, with some hazy brown. A little bit of puffy white head clings to the glass...  Wow. Hops on the nose. Lots of them. A pleasant, fruity-pine smell.  A surprisingly creamy mouthfeel up front, maybe abetted by it being on cask. Highly drinkable, with some nice malt characteristics moderating the floral and grapefruit hop taste. The Two Hearted also did not leave behind a parched feeling accompany the hops on the palate, as some stronger IPAs do (at least with my taste buds). Instead it was rather refreshing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

T: Sweet and spicy upfront with some orange flavor before giving way to a floral flavor and some grapefruit-like bitterness. Also a little kick there at the end.

Taste: Pine hits you on the tongue immediately along with a hint of lemon. Balanced out very well with a nice malty background. The hops really come on at the back of the mouth. Beautifully bitter.  Mouthfeel: Smooooth. Crisp in the mouth with a dry finish. Great carbonation.  Drinkability: Just a great IPA. Tons of flavor, great balance.

287,1093,mgp80,4.34,"Served in a pint glass from a bottle.  A - Cloudy orange-ish straw color, nice cream-colored suds that stick around. Plenty of lacing.  S - Worth the price of admission alone. Like a freshly opened bag of hop pellets, just not quite as intense. Little bit bready.  T - Citrus/grapefruit very prominent, some tartness, with a little bit of dough-like malt and a crisp bitter finish. The bitterness in the finish is even kinda fresh and hoppy.  M - Just a tad on the smooth side.  D - Crisp and refreshing, perfect after a long hot run or whenever else.  Bell's seems to do a lot of straightforward, easy-drinking beers. This doesn't blast you, really, it's just very fresh-hoppy and not all that bitter. Just an all-around really nice IPA. This is going to be one of my staples.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,iuhophead87,4.83,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle. Before I review this beer I want to note that it is one of my favorite ""go to"" beers of all time. I have consumed more of this beer than I want to even think about. I have never actually sat down to review it. Here goes:  A- A hazy golden beer with a frothy white head. When I think of beer, this is exactly what I think of, maybe because I've had too many of these in the past. S-MMM! Grapefruity hops and apricot with a little woody pine. T- This is not an over the top beer so the taste is exactly what I want from an American IPA. The perfect blend of sweetness, pine, and strong citrusy hop flavor with a slight bite at the end. MF- Surprisingly the beer feels a little creamy in the mouth. Does leave the mouth with a slightly dry finish. D- Give me an IV. I could drink this all day everyday, other than the 7.0%ABV that will catch up if not careful. This is the perfect session beer!

Taste- WOW. Great balance of malt and hops. I expected a huge hop bomb that would turn me off but it is surprisingly not. it has some malty sweetness which balances nicely with the hoppiness. The citrus flavors come through in the taste as well. Nice orange peel and a sour grapefruit as well.  Mouthfeel- Medium body with medium carbonation.

287,1093,maximum12,3.75,"Two-Hearted. How did I manage to avoid this beer for so long, being both a big Bell's & big IPA fan? We'll never know.  Pours a classic yellow with a small head. Smells of verdant hops & a field full of flowers in bloom. I don't even know what verdant means.  Dispenses a mild hop bite on the tongue, along with some honest citrusy pine tar. Easy drinking, this is a very good summer beer, sessionable if you have a high tolerance. IMHO this would be an ideal beer to introduce those who haven't yet made the move over to 'craft' beers; good enough to be worthy, but familiar enough to most beer drinkers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Nothing overly fruity except for the grapefruit.Citrusy/grassy undertones with a bitter hoppy crisp clean finish.  M- Medium-bodied IPA, sticky finish, coating the tongue and lips.

287,1093,MDekker,4.5,"Ah, Bell's Two Hearted Ale - often consumed, but never reviewed, so here goes:  It pours out an opaque light rust color with a nice white head. Pretty good lacing too, as the glass empties, with a consistent head. The aroma is all hops, nice and floral, with hints of faintly sweet fruit, like banana. The flavor is consistently hoppy (notes of evergreens), with more fruit flavors making an appearance (I thought of apricot) and some citrus flavors too. The hoppiness wins, of course, but it's an IPA and well-balanced for the style. There are lots of dense, tiny bubbles making for a wonderful, smooth mouthfeel. Overall, it's a great brew and I'm always happy to have another.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Smell is sweet and citrusy definitely hoppy with light malts in the background.  Medium bodied beer, not to thick not to thin. The taste is sweet and malty but with a unquestionable hop profile. The hops are big but not over the top, moderately citrusy and tastes slightly of resins.  Pleasant bitterness and lovely carbonation make a superb offering. I think I can drink this beer for the rest of my days. If I were stranded on a desert island this is one shipment of beer I would wish washed up on the shore.

As a hophead I expected a little more when I lifted it to my nose. There was some faint floral and maybe pine in there, but nothing too strong.  Drinking it was a different story however. My tongue found the hops. The Two-hearted made me pucker like a bear in the woods in winter. and that's a good thing. There was grapefruit in there and Christmas trees.

The nose is clear and clean with lots of choice fresh hops, some peppery spice and a citrus note. Much is the same in the way the beer tastes, lots of wet tasting fresh hops, tons of lemon/grapefruit character and toasty malts. The weakest part of this beer has to be its mouthfeel, way too much carbonation.

287,1093,Domingo,3.73,"One of those IPA's that always comes up in discussions, but I've only recently been able to buy some. This IPA falls into the reddish amber category. It's actually one of the darkest ones I've encountered to date. The head forms, and it's not too heavy or thick, but the lacing is top notch. Smells piney, floral, and grapefruity. Interesting. Usually the darker IPA's tend to fall into the pineapple territory, but I'm not getting that. WOW - this stuff is bitter. Probably one of the most bitter beers I've ever had. Because it doesn't have that booze or malt to keep the hops in check, this one hits you right in the mouth. It needs something else. Very dry finish, but there's a cracker-like flavor that I've picked up in other Bell's beers. That actually keeps this from being an unbalanced bitter mess. At first I didn't like it, but it grew on me a bit By the end of my glass, I could handle a second one. It's not everyday that a beer changes my mind in the middle of drinking it. That cracker finish really saves this one, but it's still a little flawed. I like this, but it can be a little much if you're not wanting a bitterness assault. However if you are - this one takes the cake. I plan on revisiting this with a meal to see how it comes into play with different flavors.

T: A fantastic blend of strong pale and caramel malts with hefty floral, evergreen, and citric Centennial and Cascade hops notes that dominate without overdoing it. The finish is bitter but pleasantly so.  M: Medium-to-full bodied with fairly dry finish and pleasant citrus aftertaste. Very smooth with a unique feel more akin to lighter ale.  D: One of my favorite IPAs -- distinctive and delicious.

M - very crisp with a medium to light body. nice carbonation carries some flavors across the tongue, but everything seems a bit too reserved .

S- very fruity pineapple, pine resin, and grapefruit, in that order. very impressive, very herbal-fruity aroma maybe centennial and amarillo hops? or something similar. shit. an absolute perfect amount of sweet toasted caramel malt in the background to accentuate the hop aroma. light toffee sweet smells and burnt marshmallow and tangerine & clementine notes as it warms. a beautiful bouquet gives the chicken foot to my precious goose island.  T- taste is a bit more harshly bitter than the fruity aroma with a briney pickle taste throughout. still very grapefruit though, it's mostly herbal and resinous hops and a medicinal bitterness. toasted cereal character comes on as it warms and the astringency kinda moves to the back allowing a stronger pine taste to pull through. inhaling while i take a sip brings out a fresh pineapple flavor to the herbal hoppy fruity finish.  MF- resinous and nearly full, carbonation is on the high end and seems to add to is viscosity rather than break it up and let it flow. nice dry finish but still with that sticky-cheeck feeling.  D- nicely drinkable, but a little to far toward the chemical end for me. though i'm technically a hop head, in a regular IPA i'd like to taste a little more malt present, a little more than just dry toast.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

There are also floral and piney hop aromas detected. All this over a nice biscuity malt backbone.  Taste is screaming juicy hops. Citrus flavors of grapefruit and lemon with a slight spiciness. After the hop explosion it finishes nice and dry with a sweet biscuity malt flavor that blends exquisitely with the lingering taste of hops on the tongue.  Mouthfeel is medium and very crisp.  A fantastic IPA. The hop flavor here is just bursting with juiciness. Some might call it a hop bomb, but I find it to be quite balanced. I can put down a sixer of these no problem.

T: Very citrusy and hoppy. Some slight malt in the middle but mostly the floral and citrus like hops. This is extremely well balanced. Hoppy like the Hopslam but less citrus and more balance.

Very flavorful and just all around delicious. Thanks again to kadonny for the great trade.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ryrust5301,4.28,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a unibroue tulip glass.  Appearance - Pours a murky dark gold color with a creamy, pillowy white head of a finger length  Smell - Oh so citrusy with a nice blend of sweet malts and floral hops.  Taste & Mouthfeel - This beer has great balance! At first there's a crisp carbonation bite with a taste of sweet malts. Stays active all the way to the back of the tounge, where a nice splash of floral bitter hops shakes the mouth to life. Wonderful grapefruit taste to acconut for the citrus.  Drinkability - This beer is balanced to perfection. Not too sweet and not too malty makes for a hell of a fantastic session beer. Incredibly tastey and easy to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,everetends,4.33,"12oz bottle obtained at Four Winds in Pensacola. Poured into a nonic.  A: A nice light amber color. with a nice full head. Head recedes to nice ring that leaves big, sticky lacing.  S: Nice bready malt, with big floral and citrus hops. Smells very inviting.  T: Grapefruit hits first, then a nice light biscuity malt. Citrus and floral hops are very present in this brew but it is incredibly balanced. Very impressive.  M: A nice medium carbonation. The beer has a coating ability that really lets the malt shine. Still very clean and crisp with a light bitter aftertaste.  D: This beer is very accessible for an IPA. Very smooth and easy drinking. Now I know why everyone speaks so highly of this brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,slatetupelo,4.4,"A - Pours a nice hazy copper/golden color with a white two inch head that remains and leaves great lacing throughout. Lots of carbonation.  S - Mostly earthy hops with some floral and citrus hints  T - Good hoppy bitterness that isn't overpowering and actually kind of mild. There are some hints of citrus fruits but not much. Overall it's really balanced. Light to medium bodied. Love the grapefruit taste here.  D - I really, really enjoy this but I am biased towards IPAs. I could pound a few of these any day of the year, they go down incredibly smooth.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,spointon,4.52,"I poured this one from a 12oz brown bottle into a pint glass.  A= This beer poured a very clear deep golden color with very fine particulates noticable in bright light. The initial 2"" foamy white head eventually sank to a thin skim, but left impressive sticky lacing down the glass.  S= I detected alot of flowery and citric hop notes in this one. Along side the fruitiness though was a delicious biscuity malt aroma as well. I also got a bit of alcohol in the nose if the beer was swirled.  T= The fantastic balance of the pale malt and yeast gave this brew biscuity flavors weighing against the big juicy, citrusy hop explosion. I would characterize the hop flavors as strong with serious bitterness and a long dry finish.  MF= This had a truly medium body with a crisp feel on the tongue. Cabonation level was superb throughout.  D= Larry Bell has done it again! This is a fantastically drinkable ale, and quite deceptive. The 7% abv is not readily apparent and will sneak up on unsuspecting drinkers... I would make this one of my number one session beers, but alas I live in Illinois and the a**hole distributors have caused this fine ale to disappear from my state.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Drewcifer,4.15,"Nice golden color with a finger-plus of rocky, foamy off-white head.  A very pleasant, slightly subdued scent of fresh floral and citric hops, with a very slight malt sweetness detectable.  Well balanced taste - Grapefruit hops are foremost, but evened up by slightly sweet, biscuity malts and floral hops.  Medium bodied, well-coating if not a bit sticky, lighter carbonation than I was expecting.  Overall, pretty drinkable. Not the most impressive IPA I've ever had, but well-balanced, very much on top of the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,robbyc1,4.18,"12 oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams glass. Love the fact that they put a batch # on the back that you can put into their website and get info on it. This one was bottled 11/20/07.  Nice lacing head, light cloudy deep yellow.  Fresh hops and a hint of malt on the nose.  Very balanced, my favorite view of tastes, hoppy and dry on the finish, in the middle just enough malt to balance. Would like a bit more malt but very refreshing.  Frothy and bubbly mouthfeel, just right for an IPA.  Best attribute is that it is very easy to drink this, could have several, not a session though at 7%, but very nice, hides the abv very well. I prefer New Glarus' IPA, and Goose Island's is a match for this, but worth looking for.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Kadonny,4.47,"Poured from a tap at TJ Everydays into a slim nonic pint glass.  A: A nice light amber orange color with a nice off white minimal head. Nice glass lacing.  S: Different than from a bottle, this nose was a bit more subdued with citrus hops and a slight malt sweetness. Far from overwhelming.  T: A totally different experience than from a bottle. The draft was so much hoppier and ""lighter"" feeling than from bottle, it's all in the lack of the deep strong malt gotten from bottle. The tap version had very crisp and refreshing huge citrus hop flavors, specifically orange, grapefruit and tangerine coupled with some slight pine and grass. The lingering bitterness was very crisp and enjoyable. The malt was much more subdued in the tap and I would say it is not as balanced from tap as bottle. Still, this is one kick ass beer.  M: As I said, very crisp hops coats the mouth and makes it tingle seemingly forever. No trace at all of alcohol and carbonation was just about perfect, maybe even a tad low.  D: Uber high. Very, very drinkable, this beer is sooo good it's scary.  Overall a totally different experience than from boottle. Fresh from tap no doubt the hops come through way more and the malt sits more subdued. More balanced in the bottle, but both are super great. Still one of my favorite IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,hwwty4,5,"This is my go to beer when I don't know what I want. Every time I pop a new one it reminds me of what beer can be. Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. This beer pours a hazy, raw honey orange with a billowing 2 finger head that left sticky lacing down the chalice. The aroma is a explosion of citrus. Grapefruit is predominant with bits of orange and lemon. Also sweet grassy notes come through on the finish. The taste is what hops done correctly taste like. Grapefruit and lemon balance with just a bit of spicy/grassy notes. All the hops are balanced extremely well with a malty sweetness that comes out on the finish. The mouthfeel is full and leaves a wonderful coating of hoppy bitterness all around your mouth. This beer isn't a hop monster, its well balanced and goes down smoothly. The only knock is it comes in a little high on the alcohol content to be a session beer.

A: Tarnished gold with a fluffy white head, not much retention, but some nice lace.  S: Wonderful hoppy nose, with grass, pine & tangerine. Some underlying biscuity malt.  T: Assertive bitterness, but smooth. Plenty of hop flavour (grass, nectarine, tangerine, pine, slightly steelie). Light toffee & biscuity malt with hints of fruity ale esters.

Has a very floral scent with notes of citrus and plenty of hops. Has a very hoppy first impression and fades very well to a great bitterness, grapefruit flavor comes through in the finish. Goes down suprisingly smooth for as hoppy as it is.

287,1093,daythree16,4.55,"Shared with some friends while homebrewing. Pours a very light and clean orange color with a nearly white head.  Sweetness dominates the nose. Pineapple and grapefruit take center stage, with a good floral aroma in place in the back. The taste is refreshing citrus. There is also a floral hop character and only mild bitterness to finish it. This is an awesomely mild IPA.  The mouthfeel is fairly light, if not a little oily. However, I think I could drink these all night. A fantastic brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Beer pours a cloudy, honey/orange color, nice fluffy white head, some pretty good lacing. Smell is grapefruit, hoppy madness!! Taste is a spicy, citric explosion, with some faint grassy notes, and a sweet malty finish. Bitterness lingers....excellent aftertaste.

Bready malts melding with the very potent hops of citrus notes. An assault of hops is my initial note. Oranges, grapefruits are dominant. Has a decent malt backbone but the hops rule in this one.

M: Nothing overpowering until the swallow where there was a distinct grapefruit like burn and a bitter wash with bitter aftertaste.  T: Tart and bitter from strong grapefruit, a strong cherry accent and raisins. It was candy like and dry. Cherry tastes are unusual, but mixed well and alcohol was strong.  D: As IPAs go, this one was different. Not really my taste, and I don't think I'd reach for it because the cherry tastes I picked up just didn't sit well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Citrus grapefruit hops and floral grassy hops mix to create an awesome aroma. i could smell this all day long.  Taste is amazing. Dry and spicy hops up front. Citrus tones reveal as it goes down. There is a hoppy bitterness to the brew but it is remarkable balanced. Slight sweetness to the brew.  Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. The carbonation matches perfectly.

287,1093,Flyer,3.63,"Lately I've gotten away from these more everyday-type craft beers, but after a day of yardwork, this tasted great. Pours the color of a well-polished dooknob with some grapefruity hoppiness. Pillowy head. The flavor is clean, mildly bitter hops over a faint but unmistakable backtatse of Bazooka bubble gum and some lingering grapefruit. Sweet finish, but still clean. A very good example of the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,PatrickJR,3.38,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into nonic pint glass.  A - Huge, nearly 4 finger head. Creamy and pillowy. Hangs around for a very long time, receding to quarter inch thick cap, and lots of sticky lacing. VERY nice. The only thing keeping this from a 5.0 was the haziness...why hazy?  S - Typical IPA. Full range of floral/spicy/earthy/citrus hops with focus on the citrus aspects, mostly lemon and orange. Vague malt pulls through as well.  T - Quite dry without the early to mid-palate sweetness of most IPAs. The hops are there, but only play a small role. Some floral aspects are present, but it quickly moves into citrus peel and intense bitterness with uninteresting malts. For such an otherwise impressive beer, the taste is quite bland and off balance. The taste that is there isn't focused on enough, and it's also a poor example of a ""well-hopped beer."" It's just sort of weird with the citric bitterness playing the main role.  M - A little thicker and less carbonated than I'd prefer, especially with this brew's focus on citric elements.  D - It's not all that interesting of a beer, and to boot, it's unbalanced and all over the place. Probably a great IPA for some, but not me.

Tons of lacing as well. The beer was a cloudy copper color.  S: Sweetness is the first thing that hits you. The hops are definitely there as well. The balance was really enjoyable. Hints of citrus throughout.  T: The nice citrus hops hit you first. Then comes the bitterness. A quick flush of malt balances things out before finishing bitter. Fairly well balanced.

The aroma is very hop heavy, my nose actually got a little frightened over the expected bitterness.  The taste revealed a much more balanced hop-malt tasste, and a pleasant underlying floral influence. Much better than I expected from the scent (not that the scent was bad, mind you; I was just expecting something far more bitter)  Great mouthfeel, well carbonated but not overdone.

Taste is bit hoppy, but with a unique spice that goes away quickly on the palate. Visually carbonated, but there isn't a strong carbonated taste. The 7% is very well covered. Great balance over all.

Great retention and plenty of lace leftover on the glass. Couldn't be better than this.  Smell: A sweet lemon/lime aroma mixes with the bold grapefruit nose. Lingering pine and freshly cut grass. Honeysuckle and cherry blossom aromas make this beer quite floral.  Taste: A bitter sensation explodes on the taste buds and hangs on throughout the gulp. Extremely fresh white grapefruit, not the sugary pink ones. Hence, this isn't a sweet beer, but one with complexity. Lavender, basil and pine round out the flavor with a nice malt balance.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and ample bodied with lots of liveliness and plenty of hop bitterness. Alcohol is apparent because this isn't a sugary IPA.  Drinkability: Probably as good as it gets. This is a very well rounded beer with plenty of quenchability, flavor, and ample alcohol. It would pair well with spicy foods and would cut through charred meat as well.

Nose is of good citrus hop flavor and a little bit of spice. Taste is very very refreshing. A good display of grapefruity citrus hops, some good hop flavor throughout, but a nice malt backbone. This one leans on the hops side (duh) but they are not overpowering. A little extra carbonation helps this beer seem more crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is as good as I have ever found in an IPA.

Notes and ratings are unchanged from 2008 for an historical perspective on one of my earliest reviews. This beer was such a surprise and treat when I first had it in Sauk Centre near my hotel.  A - The beer pours a brownish-gold color with a pale-white head.  S - The aroma is floral and fruity.  T - The flavors include tart orange candy, grapefruit bitterness and mild grain. It dries quickly but leaves a pleasant bitter aftertaste. The 7% ABV warms the throat and belly. The malt is muted to let the hops shine. Well done.  M - The light-medium body and medium-high carbonation.  D - Very refreshing with a great flavor. Easy to have more than one.  The blend of flavors is very nice.

Slight caramel/apple/toast malt, and no off scents or yeasty characters.  Tongue numbing hoppiness upfront, completely encapsulating my taste buds. Chewy malt flavors are also quite prominent, but dry (dry light toast?). Beer finishes with a dry citris rind flavor (grapefruit, predominantly) that leaves a slight hop burn on the tongue.

287,1093,ASymon13,4.97,"This is an excellent IPA from the Bell's brewery. It pours a solid amber color, a little on the light side for an IPA, with a nice fluffy off-white head which leaves some fantastic lacing on the glass. Floral aromas dominate the nose, with some hints of citrus and a sweet-bready malt taking a backseat.  The Centennial hops really come through beautifully in the flavor. It's like a field of flowers in your mouth, but it has enough malt there to balance it out and the hops never become overwhelming. The medium body and ample carbonation give it an excellent mouthfeel, and having a couple of these can be a real treat.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bluemoonswoon,3.97,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass, picked up on my trip to dark lord day  A: Pours a super intense fluffy and rocky yellowish white head, very very bubbly and one to one and a half inches thick. the beer itself is a cloudy banana peel and orange and looks a lot like a hefeweizen in color and clarity, and i like hefes so this one looks damn inviting but the head fades to a cap in about five minutes or so but leaving some lacing down the sides of the glass.  S: Huge medicinal hop quality, like, way beyond super pine oilyness though a second pass yields mellower, fruitier characteristics like orange juice and mango and pineapple, not so much grapefruit which is a nice change of pace, but maybe too a medicinal opening for my taste.  T/MF: Hop heavy tongue ripper, that is how I would describe the mouthfeel on this baby, the taste is a bit different from other IPAs in recent memory, this one is very earthy, heavy on the pine and medicinal qualities and a bit lighter on the fruit flavors with a too bitter orange being the main citrus taste here, letting this beer warm a bit unlocks a bit more sweetness in the citrus aspect of the beer, has a bitter but sort of odd buttery finish, not sure how to explain that one.  D: To be honest I was expecting more out of this beer with all I've heard about it, not bad, pretty good, but not mind blowing and a little out of balance",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,OldYoda,3.94,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my trusted Troeg's pint glass - a hazy orange with a modest head and excellent lacing.  Smell is hops and some citrus with a whiff of malt. The odor is smooth and invites you to dive in.  Taste is outstanding - hops dominate but well balanced by a bready malt backbone. Finishes clean and smooth.  Drinkability is outstanding - I could session this with no problem at all. Another great offering from Bell's. Bravo!!!  10/4/08 Revisiting this is a real treat. Just as good as I remembered. If anything, I enjoy this more today than I did 6 months ago. Just an outstanding American IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,naterock,4.25,"I was actually surprised to see this in a little bar in Columbia Mo. A: very nice orangish color, with very good retention of lacing. S: very good floral hops aroma, with a hint of citrus. T: very nice hop flavor, citrus comes very nicely behind the bitterness. switches places after the bitterness subsides.

287,1093,Oxymoron,4.22,"That would be cool to enjoy Two Hearted on the Two Hearted, but I'll settle for my home. Pours a semi-hazy golden yellow color with a good head. Great retention and good lacing, but doesn't last through the full tasting.  The nose emphasizes hops but with some balance (along the lines of a east coast IPA). Mostly citrus and grassy hops, but some light piney on the back end. Some sweeter malty notes as well with a touch of biscuit/bready notes. Some lighter solvent alcohol notes but not overly powering. Clean yeast though.  The taste is a bit more in balance than what the nose would indicate. The hops are the stronger of the two with a nice balance between bitterness and hop finish. Citrus and orange mostly but a bit of piney and a spiciness on the back end. The spicy hop flavor seems to come out more as it warms. The malt is limited in flavor but still represented well. Some mild bready notes with a touch of yeasty undertones.  The body has a moderate level with a light carbonation. Pretty smooth considering the ABV. Very clean with the minimal yeast characteristics. Overall very enjoyable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,birchstick,4.17,"Poured orange with a a nice, frothy white head. Smelled the hops immediately, hints of citrus were detected as well. It tastes different than I was expecting from the smell. Hops are there, but not as much as the smell would make you believe. There is a grapefruit/citrusy aftertaste. It is also pretty bitter. Two Hearted goes down very slickly without a whole lot of carbonation getting in the way. Overall, this was a good IPA.

287,1093,HugoGrim,3.63,"Golden orange body with a thin bubbly, creamy white head. Excellent lace.  Aroma of hops is very floral and very sharp, however it weakens quite quickly. Some citrus.  Hop flavor is wet, fresh, piney, resiny. Very bitter, to the point that the bitterness masks the flavor of the hops. Hints of orange pulp. Peppery. As it warms it mellows a bit, of course this could just be my taste buds adapting and being overwhelmed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,drumrboy22,4.22,"Thanks to paulthebeerguru for this one. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Kronenbourg 1664 glass. Beer was a slightly hazy orange color with a two finger, rocky, off-white head. Moderate carbonation and heavy lacing.  Aroma was bold hops along with sweet, caramel malt. Just a touch of citrus and some woody notes present.  Taste was surprisingly smooth and refreshing. I was anticipating a hop bomb, but this is very well balanced and not nearly as hoppy or bitter as I expected. Some grapefruit citrus taste.  Long, moderately bitter finish. Another winner from Bell's. This one goes done very easily and would make for a great summer time brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

(fish beer? yuck!)...poured into a seidel yields a faintly hazy orange-golden body with two fingers of tightly-bubbled head atop. The foam slowly recedes to a rocky half-finger and leaves dense lacing hash-marking the sip lines.  The smell is piney, herbal, and citrusy. Pungent orange-infused caramel emerges as the beer warms.  The taste is smooth and semisweet with a tangy citrus pine punch. The citrusiness is complemented by a thin cookielike malt backbone and a snip of pine oil.  The drink is medium-bodied with a wee sizzle of fine carbonation, and otherwise highly consumable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Grassy, citrusy hop aromas are certainly present followed by some malt. The taste of citrus, grapefruity hops dominate followed by a somewhat sweet malt backbone. Not much else here. Good, but not as good as out of the bottle. Has a crisp and smooth, full bodied mouthfeel with light to medium carbonation. Easy to drink. If I am correct in my belief that beers in the cask are still maturing and the yeast is still active than this is one beer that I believe is best enjoyed once it has reached its full maturation.

287,1093,Shawn1974,4.8,"Not the HopSlam, but a top-notch drinkable beer for those who value a heavy floral hops aroma and taste. Sufficient as a second beer for those hop heads who try the heavy stuff first while the palate is fresh. It cuts through those lingering tastes, which accounts for my high-ranking of this beer. So often an IPA becomes bland after a DIPA, but this one stands the test and affirms an identity all its own. Truly then, for the Two-Hearted!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,HardcoreKeith,3.87,"Somehow I forgot to review this!  12 ounce bottle ... with a fish on it. I never bought this beer because the fish was unappealing to me. Then one day I saw the review and decided I had to try it. My palate has come quite a long way for me to now enjoy such bitter beers as this.  Anyway, A: Hazy gold, super lacey, like a cobweb of stickiness on the glass. S: Floral hops. Super strong hops. A symphony of hoppiness. Like sticking your face in a bag of hops. T: Like the smell. Pretty much a hoptastic hopstravaganza. There's some malt sweetness to balance it, and it tastes more balanced as it warms up. IMO this is comparable to most double IPAs in terms of hoppiness. It's not all just bitterness though, the taste and aroma are both also really strong, and it's certainly enjoyable. M: Dry and bitter on the aftertaste. D: Although it's really good, I couldn't drink too much of this at once.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,SortaAmbivalent,4.68,"This is my 1st review, be kind. ;-)  A bottle poured into a pint glass.  A- The beers appearance is a nice cloudy golden orange with an almost 1 inch head. Lacing left all around the glass.  S- Smell is of light citrus hops with maybe a bit of pine.  T- Incredible hop bite that holds on and doesn't let go. I certainly can understand that if someone didn't like really heavy hops why this wouldn't work for them. But for me this is really a great IPA  M- What can I say? A lovely bite at the front of the tongue. Very refreshing.  D- This beer goes down way to easy, the taste is so good to me I can't hardly wait for the next sip.  Overall I am very impressed with the effort the brewery put in.  The only downfall. It wouldn't make a great session beer due to its 7% alcohol level. I can live with that.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,cthulu81,4.45,"I have been drinking way too much of this lovely, lovely stuff to not have posted a review about it yet. Gathering from that opening statement, yup, this is going to be a very positive light shone on the beer that is Two Hearted. Spicy Orange Marmalade. 'Nuff said. Really. That was and still is the first thing that hits me when I drink this exquisite IPA. The honeyed citrus stampedes out of the glass on an aromatic mission to assault your olafactory glands. Luck for me I am a beer masochist. Then you drink it and the barrage of zest simply continues. But all of this hop juice is held in check by an assertive, smooth and full-bodied malt backbone. The finish is crisp, fragrant and your brain's que to hurry up and raise the glass to your mouth again. So drinkable, and even better when you can get it in the 5 ltr. party kegs. Whaaa? Yup, this purty little thang is now available in a jolly little aluminum barrel of joy. Well, not specifically RIGHT now, as Bells puts Two Hearted keg production on temporary hiatus while they crank out the Oberon mini-kegs, but come Fall they will be back.

287,1093,Dukeofearl,3.85,"$1.89 for a 12 ounce bottle from Merchants Fine Wine in Dearborn Heights, MI, in March, 2008. Brought home to California for subsequent tasting.  Pours a somewhat cloudy light orange with a big foamy rocky white head.  Aroma of sharp hops but strongly offset by a sweeter citrus profile, oranges and grapefruits. Quite nice.  Flavor is very tasty, the citrus coming through, but also a maltiness that is much more evident than the Ballast Point IPA earlier in the day. A sharper, more bitter ending finishes with the swallow.  A tasty brew, quite enjoyable, but not as classic as some I have tried.

Suds cling to the sides of the glass with each tilt of the vessel.  Aroma is grassy, citrus hops.  The beer is smooth and even a little creamy.  The flavor: this is a hop head's beer. The initial flavor is slight caramel malt and hoppy pine and grapefruit. I would call it ""balanced"". Finish is quite clean except for the lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue.

Malts are there but understated, and purely there for balance. This beer is all about hops, and it works so good.  M - Creamy, light, sparkly but not over-carbonated.  D - ABV is the only limiter... the taste is outstanding, and this is almost sessionable.  Notes: I've been drinking this for ages now but finally sat down to review it. This should be a staple in any Michiganders fridge, as it's a truly wonderful example of what the Great Lakes states can do.

The smell was flawless, with fruit peels and juices, and some warm, almost sugary aromas.  The taste starts with a soft left hook of citrus flavors followed by a knockout uppercut from the hops. I don't consider myself much of a hop-head, but it was so smooth and well balanced that I think anyone could enjoy it.

Very well balanced, obviously it leans more to the hop side but the hops arent overly dominant. They are there and present, but there is a malty sweetness to it as well.

This might be the gateway beer I have been looking for in hopes of gaining an appreciation for highly hopped beers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Neehan,4.95,"After having at least 50 of these over the course of a few years (as it is one I can't stay away from for long) I figure it is time to sit down and give it a review. This pours a light body that is slightly orange, slightly gold with a nice head that has a good deal of substance and fantastic lacing. The smell is of hops, mainly citrusy but also with floral and a bit of pine. Fantastic. This is repeated in the taste. Light bodied enough to be very drinkable, and the drinkability is only enhanced exponentially by the delicious taste. Good enough to serve as a thirst quencher. I can't think of a scenario that this beer wouldn't compliment whether it be a sunny day outside or a lazy day on the couch watching ball games. IMO, it doesn't get much better than this. This beer is the essence of what quality, crafted brewing is all about. Exceptional, all the way around.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TheIPAHunter,4.72,"12 oz. bottle purchased at 1 Stop Beverage in Wyomissing, PA. The majority of craft beer at this location has to be purchased in a case.  Crimson gold w/ 1"" foam to boot. Decent retention with an abundance of lacing clinging fiercely to the inner walls of my pint glass.  The smell is excellent. A wonderful blend of citrus and floral notes; this is damn near perfect for an IPA. Also detected some bready, caramel malt undertones.  Fiyah!!! Here's a situation where the taste lives up to the smell, then exceeds it. Much of the same floral and citrus action, but balanced equally by the malt characteristic. Bell's captured an ideal taste for an American IPA.  Mouthfeel is light with a crisp finish. Bitter hop aftertaste - very nice.  Although I waited awhile to drink and review this beer, both experiences were worth it. An extreme pleasure to drink, I could easily spend an outing or relaxed evening consuming nothing but this. A stand-out IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Tumpster,4.62,"This beer felt very hoppy through and through with no over powering bitterness with it. Seems like Bell got the right mix here of it all, very drinkable and most importantly DELICIOUS! Try it cold or warm it's great either way.

287,1093,AgingWarrior,4.18,"Poured a dark golden color into my Sam Adams glass providing a perfect two finger off white head. The head lasted approximately two minutes before dissipating to a thin off white head that lasted the entire drink. Plenty of lacing.  The smell is citrus and hops. The aroma gets stronger and hoppy as the beer warms in the glass.  Taste is hopped up but not over done. Light and crisp on the palate. Not bitter like many other IPA's.  Mouth feel is very good. Nice body, moderately carbonated.  Very good drinkability.

287,1093,flannelman808,4.64,"2011 update; on about month and a half old bottle.  A: This one pours an ever so hazy amber orange color and is topped with a frothy stark white head which has decent retention and lacing.  S: Grapefruit zest and pine. Gotta love it.  T: Taste follows up with what the nose suggests. Grapefruit rind and pine delightfully tingle the palate. This has a dry feeling about it with just a slight suggestion of toasted grains. Truly a fantastic beer to which all other IPA's should be judged.  M: Prickly  O: A real classic, this beer always impresses me every time I try it.  '08 review  What a great IPA this beer is...  Its not overwhelming, but is powerful enough to captivate. The factor that keeps me coming back is the fruity bouquet on the nose and backup with the flavor. It's so full of citrus and grapefruit, but in a purely essence of and bitter way.

Smells of citrusy hops, light at first, but stronger as the beer warms and with each sip. Perfect flavor for an IPA. Good hop bite, but not overdone. I am a hophead, so I like it if it is overdone, but this one is what I would call perfectly balanced! The malts smooth out the flavor as the beer sits on my mouth. Great medium bodied beer, extremely drinkable! What I would call a perfect session beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jettjon,3.97,"From a 12 oz bottle stamped ""8319"", into a pint glass. This one's a hazed orange color with a bit of residual yeast at the bottom. Small wispy head of white suds sticks around for a while, clinging a bit to the sides of the glass on the way down. Floral and citrus hops are clearly in evidence on the nose with some hints of malt in the background. Tastes of firm floral-citrus hops right out front, with some pink grapefruit sweetness evening things out so that it's not all bitter hops. Semi-dry finish with hints of grapefruit. In the mouth, it's crisp and sharp, the carbonation nicely accenting the crisp hops character. It's nicely tingly yet smooth and wet going down. Drinkability is very good; it's crisp yet smooth and balanced. The 7% alcohol needs to be watched however for sessions.  Overall: A solid American-style IPA that's tasty and drinkable. I'd definitely look for this one again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,timbro81,4.17,"Thanks to deepsouth in the Brews 'N' Tunes 3 BIF for the chance to try this great beer.  Pours a light orange/straw color with a good sized fluffy head. Smell is amazingly floral with a titch of maltiness. Taste is most exceptional, big floral hops with some citrus oil (think orange peel). Malts don't make their presence till its time to swallow and its only a flash. Even though it is unbalanced it pulls it off really well. I wish there was a little more body to it but then again the lightness keeps it sessionable. Very good beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jbm5,4.42,"A: Deep pale color. Seems an oxymoron perhaps. But has a very thick hazy color that implies depth. Thick head which leaves a hearty lace and dissipates slowly. S: Rich piney smell with heavy floral overtones. T: Follows with the smell. A rich deep piney flavor up front that carries through with a bitter, mildly spicy back. M: Smooth. Coats the mouth evenly throughout and washes around the whole palate well. Very robust. D: Fantastic. My favorite american IPA. All around a great beer. Has a heavy piney, floral taste that is smooth and not too bitter for the amount of hops. A beer you can sip on all night (the ABV sneaks up on you). One of my overall favorite beers. Very well-balanced for an IPA with this much hop character.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,buckobrock,5,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a 16 oz. pint glass  Bottled on ?  Consumed on 8 March 2008  A - Pours a brilliant golden color with a hint of orange. A thick, white, soapy head forms and peaks just at the top of the pint glass. A marvelous pour indeed. Three sips later, a thick lacing has formed on the sides of the glass reminding me of the foam sticking on the sand at the beach.  S - Grapefruit is the very first thing to hit my nostrils. Strong hops in this brew for sure; just what I expect in an IPA. Digging a little deeper, I sense some piney notes and barely catching my attention is a slight bready smell.  T - Hopheads beware, you may leave your significant other for this one. A very crisp beer with Cascade hops seemingly sliding down my tongue. As I swallow a nice bitter taste remains on the back of my tongue. A very enjoyable sip.  M - Light on the tongue, yet the flavor seems complex. As I swish it around my mouth, it seems that every particle on my tongue is being pleasured. Piney is the word that I think describes the mouthfeel best. There's also a slight bready taste which I think helps to balance the bitterness of the hops.  D - A very drinkable beer no doubt. An afternoon with a 6-pack of Two Hearted and a nice big pizza could be heavenly. It's a good thing that they sell this by the case!  To date, this is the best representation of an American IPA that I've tasted.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,StrangeBrew1,5,"I bought this in a mini-party keg and boy was it good. I went out and bought 2 more after that.The smell is of apricot and citrusy flavors. Probably made with cascade hops and a strong hop flavor. Perfect for hop heads like me. I love the packaging too,I think bell's should make this their flagship beer and change their other ones to follow the lead.If you like this beer a close second is Great Lakes Commodore Perry IPA",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,OStrungT,5,"This beer pours a clear golden yellow. It boasts a thick, fluffy, off white head with a slight yellow tint to it. It fades slowly, leaving a thick lacing.  This beer has a very pleasent floral hop aroma. I smell some citrusy hops as well. It smells slightly grassy.  This beer tastes much like it smells. Floral, with some citrusy zest. It has a very subtle sweet caramel flavor as well.  This beer is crisp and refreshing. It goes down very smooth, leaving a floral aftertaste. It is carbonated to perfection.  This beer would probably make a great session beer. The flavor is great, and not aggressive, and it is not too high in alcohol.  Overall: Thanks to Markgugs for generously hooking me up. The last time I had this beer, it was the first IPA that I enjoyed. I can see how it would have started me down the hop road. I love hops now. I rated this beer lower than I know it deserves because of my inexperience. Now I simply love it.

Tastes of herbs and malt up front and is quickly met with lots of spicy floral hops. It's robust and complex. With every drink you get that great aroma and a surpisingly different taste that both contrasts and compliments each other.  Nice mouthfeel almost creamy and very smooth.  Lots of hops, but very smooth and fun to drink and enjoy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Hojaminbag,4.3,"Light amber with about two fingers of foamy off-white head that sticks around for awhile and leaves some lacing.  Strong hop smells. Lots of floral notes and citrus.  Up front is a big grapefruit taste, it's almost sour. Followed by a little bit of the floral/piney taste that the nose picks up. Finishes with a little bit of balancing malt.  Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated.  The malt that balances out the hops in the back makes this beer nicely drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Natural510,4.42,"7/9/2010-  Have to amend my original review and up the ratings a bit from when I tasted the brew for the first time. Two-Hearted continues to be an amazing ale as my palate expands. The aroma is a beautiful perfume of tropical fruit and hop oils. The flavor is heavily floral, fruity (again, tropical), with bitterness from fresh hops. This is likely the best IPA Mid-America has to offer, and one of the best American IPAs being brewed today.  ---  Pours a golden, lager-like color from 12oz bottle.Nice head, which leaves a lasting lacing in the glass. Smells very hoppy, with aromas of lemon & flowers. Hops are the first thing which come through when tasting, leaving a distinct bite. Lavender & grapefruit come through in the finish as well. Malts are not very discernible, yet this comes across as a well-balanced brew nonetheless. Stays well in the mouth and is very drinkable, given one's tolerance for hoppiness. The crisp finish allows for smoother drinkability and the bitterness does not overpower the palate.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jeonseh,4.15,"Had this on tap as the Bell's seasonal at BW3 in Mishawaka IN on 3/1/08.  A - A dark golden color with hints of orange coming through to lighten up the darker aspects of the beer. There were some light streams of carbonation floating up through the bottle as well. On the top say a thin, white head which did not last at all and then just left the beer with a slight amount of white just barely sitting on top. After having this from a bottle and seeing a nice head, I almost have to think this is a result of the way it was poured than the beer itself but nevertheless it detracted from the beauty of this one.  S - could glean a slight citrus hoppiness emanating from this brew which was also mixed in with sweeter citrus such as mango. Didn't really get much of the piney aspects of this brew as I did when I had it from a bottle.  T - Ahh, now here is where th e on tap version shines as the hops just taste so much fresher and seem to have a bit more of a pop and life to them. The first taste that hit the tongue was a hit of orange citrus hops which were actually a bit sweet. After that, it seemed to become even a bit sweeter as mango rolled in over my taste buds as well. There was also some of the sweeter malt backbone of this beer which was definitely needed to keep it balanced the strong pine hops aspect which was the last prominent flavor to move in on me. This pine aspect is what remained in the mouth also in the aftertaste and it served as a good reminder of the hops dominance of this brew.  MF - actually felt like this is a rather full bodied beer especially for the style. At first, sip you definitely get some hefitness in your mouth and it reminded of taking a bit of bread or even gettin a mouth full of thick foam. There was also a nice amount of carbonation in the beer that really helped to bring out the hops in this one.  D - overall, two hearted ale on tap has some aspects better than the bottle and some worse. Thought the taste was mildly better as the hops seemed to pop a bit more. However, I didn't get the smell or the look of the beer that I got in the bottle. Couldn't get the hops smell to be as strong even after letting it warm up to room temperature. Overall, though this was a very good beer and one of the hits from Bell's which to me always seems like a hit or miss brewery. I would definitely get this again if it were on tap and would always pick up some bottles as a beer to just relax and drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,toolbrew,4.48,"Poured with a nice white head that disappeared quickly. Clear golden-brown color.  Not an overly floral hoppy aroma but nice.

Overall Pretty solid minus the weak front palate. It's a great IPA, though I'm not sure it deserves to be on the pedestal people lift it up to. I just don't taste what makes it better than say Titan, Celebration Ale, or Avery IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DukeofAle,3.5,"Another very well made AIPA that for me just is not a standout in anyway. Lacks the strong citrus aroma and taste of some others, such as Racer 5, Bridgeport, Mojo. This beer has no major faults - I just think ther are some better choices in this category.  The color is a light, sienna-orange than most. Decent head and retention. Taste is good but the hops do not come across as well as some. Drinkabilty is good. To me, an AIPA should pack some punch, bring out the citrus- grapefruit charactor of the hops, and be a bit ""bigger"".",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JDV,3.72,"Rich golden amber pour with a big sudsy white head in a tulip. Smell is sweet caramel like with a soapy floral hop aroma.

S- Smelled of citrus, pine and sweet flowers. T- Tasted exactly as it smelled. Strong pine flavor and citrusy hops. Like flowers. M- Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was just about right. Felt light in the mouth. D- I could drink these all the time. The taste was unique in its own way. The higher alcohol content might slow you down a little bit.

Maybe b/c I had this after the Hopslam it seems quite tame for a IPA. I like the sweet malt and the citrus hop flavors. I really like this beer.  M- This is a pretty thin beer. Nice and carbonated!

Taste is, well, like i am chewing on some hop flowers. Not alot of malt to balance it out. It is almost ""west coast"" hop heavy.  It seems carbonated enough to drink if you drink it fast.. not a sipper, the hops are too bitter to sip it.  i think it needs more malt to help with the balance and improve drinkability.

287,1093,Gehrig,5,"Along with HopSlam, I had the rare foresight to pick up a sixer of Two Hearted Ale today, and this is equally remarkable. This makes me all the angrier that I cannot get Bell's in Illinois, with their stupid, corrupt distributor's dispute. What a disgrace, being deprived of beer this outstanding.  Two Hearted Ale has the presentation that HopSlam lacks (the ONLY thing it lacks)--two full fingers of sticky white head capping a fairly clear, light orange body--positively picturesque. The nose is ridiculously good--citrus abounds, as does delicious malt and a whiff of pine. It tastes at least as good as it smells--the citrus, malt, and pine comingle like old friends. The mouthfeel is quite good but, without as much of a hop residue as I would (selfishly) like, this tastes almost like a sturdy amber ale, which isn't an enormous problem by any means. My point is just that it loses a little of the standard IPA, well-hopped mouthfeel that I like and, after HopSlam, expected. Then again, how can I possibly expect something close to the mouthfeel of HopSlam? Clearly I'm splitting hairs.  This is one remarkable, smooth, flavorful beer. At $7.99 a sixer, this is highway robbery, yet another tremendous offering from Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Kegatron,4.54,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a hazy gold with 2 finger widths of off-white head that shrinks down into a nice foamy retention that leaves huge sticky hop lacing all over the place. The aroma is very lush with some piney floral hops intermingled with an assortment of pleasing fruity citrus notes and caramel sweetness.  The taste is a smooth blend of a dry feeling caramel and citrus backbone that gives way to a subtle tingle of resinous hops that linger for only a little bit before it melts into a final wash of fruity sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a pleasant slick creamy feel.  One of, not only my favorites from Bell's, but also the IPA style as a whole. Just a really great blend of refreshing citrus and piney hops that never becomes overbearing with either, while remaining hugely quaffable with an easy going body and finish. Just a pleasure to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,illidurit,4.13,"Poured into a pint glass. Hazy apple juice color with a big eggshell head that leaves a ton of lacing, all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Aroma is very tropical, with orange and pineapple hoppiness.  Flavors echo the fruity hops of the aroma, with fresh pineapple followed by a decent dose of bitterness. Not too much malt, maybe a bit of yeasty dough.  Medium-light body, a little undercarbonated, dry, not particularly clean finish.

287,1093,largadeer,4.47,"Appearance - Pale, hazy gold with 2 1/2 inches of froth upon first pour. The head retains well and never completely disappears.  Smell - Fruity and floral; aromas of lemon, grapefruit and orange with subtle notes of pine. The nose is all hops with very little presence from the malt, which is exactly how I like my IPAs.  Taste & mouthfeel - More of a pine flavor than the aroma suggests. Fruity notes are present but subdued. The malt backbone is dry and light; it's little more than a foundation for the hops. Light on the palate and very crisp, this is highly drinkable stuff. Unfortunately for me I only have one bottle. The finish is oily and resiny but easy on the palate, leaving a pleasant hoppy bitterness with very little bite.  Notes - Easily one of the better IPAs I've had.

287,1093,deapokid,3.41,"Opening with a sweet apricot aroma and a orange presence accompanied with chalky foam, this IPA matches a hefeweizen's sweetness with a big blast of hops, which works considerably well... most of the time. This floral little beer invigorates the tastebuds with scintillating hop undertones and the bitterness of orange peel and lemon, which is an intriguing combination but not a completely satisfying one. It'll make a hop addict yearn for the close, but a wheat beer aficionado will be confused by the bitter aftertaste. I, myself, wanted something more along the lines of an Arrogant Bastard or Nugget Nectar, while this strange little brew left me confused and distracted.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Orange rind, melon, floral, herbal tea, sweat cream and molasses. Spices can be detected as well.  T: Actually pretty tasty. Not a dominating IPA, but certainly not lacking either. Carbonated up front, and has a nice spicy taste that lingers long after you're done with your drink. Very tart finish. Crisp.  M: As mentioned before, very carbonated but oddly it has a creamy feel going down.

Loads of citrus in the nose with a little bit of grain. Very sharp bitter hop bite jumps out first, but surprisingly not much malt balance comes through. All bitter grapefruit citrus flavor, but almost seems metallic without a sweeter foundation. This beer comes off a little astringent. Medium-bodied, good carbonation. Definitely good to get your hop craving out of this beer, but a little too harsh to go for more than one or two. I know this beer gets outstanding reviews, but I can't put it at the top of my IPA lists.

S: Nice floral hoppy smell, but on the lighter side.  T: A good long pull spreads a decent bit of pale malt over the tongue that rather quickly gives way to the sharpness of the hops. There is some bittering but more flavor in the hops. There is a pretty good hop bitterness left behind in the finish.  M&D: Medium weight in the mouth but generally light taste. Abundant carbonation but not overly so. Smooth going down.  This is a good strong IPA. I was a little thrown by the fish on the bottle, but hey, I haven't been disappointed with any of the Bell's brews to date. This was no exception.

287,1093,dsigmon,4,A: came to me in a bells glass with a beautiful copper orange color and thin foamy head that left quickly leaving some nice lacing on the glass  S: smell of grapefruit and citrus with some grassiness and touch of malt  T: i agree that this has a very clean and tart taste. the citrus hits you first coming next with the hop bitterness and pine that tingles the tongue and then the bread and malt like tones finish off the taste.  M: lighter than many IPA's at this alcohol level. crisp and clean with a good amount of carbonation  D: very good IPA but not on the top of my list. I could definitely drink this one again to re-rate since I didn't feel it lived up to its hype.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ajr24,4.1,"On tap at Jose Pistolas, poured hazy copper, amber, orange... Smells of citrusy and floral hops, caramel presence, too. The head was frothy and off white, it dissipated a bit and left alright lacing. Tasted of hops balanced with some sweetness of citrus and caramel. Great mouthfeel and highly drinkable. After having this, I need to find some Hopslam.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,cbleary,4.38,"Enjoyed on tap at the Old Town Draught House.  This is a delicious and interesting IPA. It poured very nicely with a generous but not overdone head and a mild copper color. The taste was an explosion of citrus hops and grapefruit. It didn't have a strong malt backbone to provide balance, but the choice to keep out some of the more piney flavors makes this beer a very drinkable, warming, and refreshing IPA. I'd definitely drink it again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BradLikesBrew,4.42,"a: A yellow gold body, off-white head and good lacing.  s: mmm...that smells good. The smell of fresh grapefruit oozes from the hops of two hearted ale.  t: Pale malt makes a brief cameo, but this beer is all about the hops. Great fresh hop flavor. Grapefruit dominates, but pine is in there too. Terrific flavor, good stuff.  m: Medium body, carbonation is just right.  d: This is what American IPAs are all about. I could drink this all night (and have). I am so glad we can get Bell's in Columbia.

287,1093,deltatauhobbit,4.15,"Another awesome IPA extra from autumnaldave!  Pours a hazy golden/amber color, good size head with some lacing.  Smell has a strong floral hop aroma, pretty much all I can make out, there is a slight citrus aroma accompanied by a fruity ester, but it is pretty subtle.  Taste is initially hoppy but slowly mellows out in taste while in the mouth, might have to do with the creaminess of the beer, goes down smooth and crisp, leaves a nice bitter linger long after drinking. I have a hard time believing this is 7.0% as the alcohol content is very well hidden.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a fluffy white head that leaves lots of lacing as it drinks. Aroma is all hops. Spicey, piney, grapefruity hops in all their glory.

Lacing like crazy here. Smell is of fresh, crisp hops. Very complex. A vast array of fruits meet the nose, though mostly citrus. One of the most fragrant beers I've had (though HopSlam takes the grand prize there). Taste is loaded with bitter hops, though remains well balanced considering how hoppy it is.

287,1093,Homerbag,4,"Pours a light copper orange with thins foamy head that beautifully laces down the glass.  Smells of citrus hops with some light malt. Suprisingly clean aroma for an IPA. Tastes almost sweet, not tart like some IPAs. The citrusy hops bring out a more orange like flavor than the common grapefruit/piney flavor. Sweet malt compliments and makes this beer almost sessionable. Feels good, slightly thick. I only call this slightly thick because as easy as it is to drink I would excpect an almost watery lager like beer instead of an IPA at 7%.  I would get this beer again. Not the greatest IPA, but if I saw it on a menu or in the cooler I would put it in my choices.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,dkeramaty,4.54,"Recently scored this from a friend returning from MN. This one took me by surprise, as one new to Bell's I was not sure what to expect.  The appearance was slightly hazy with a light amber hue. The thing that really surprised me about this beer was the smell. It reminded me of the sweet piney aroma of a DIPA but in a very drinkable single IPA. The taste was unfortunately not as nice as the aroma suggested, it felt a little unbalanced to me possibly in the malt department. This is my ideal summer beer  UPDATE: After having this beer a few more times from my initial tasting almost a year ago, I have a completely different view of it. I realize now I was being overly critical of this beer especially when it came to the malts used. I think I was looking at Two Hearted Ale as a DIPA when I should have been looking at it as it truly is; a beautifully clean and satisfying IPA with an excellent balance of bitterness and floralness. I have to say this is one of my favorite beers now and most certainly my favorite IPA. Too bad for me I can only get it when my roommate goes home.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Squatchito,4.33,"This is my first review, so bear with me.  12 oz bottle into a snifter  A: Pours a hazy, ruddy orange color, almost amber with a 1/2 inch head that dissipates after a few moments. Minor amount of lacing.  S: Lots o' citrus. kind of reminds me of the smell of orange juice that has been reduced, with a healthy amount of floral hops tossed in.  T: Much like the smell, some very nice hoppiness accented by the citrus sweetness and balanced out nicely with some earthy malt. Aftertaste is fantastic. Not too bitter, but defiantly a noticeable floral hops flavor that lingers for quite a while.  M: Pretty light in body, same with carbonation. I don't think this diminishes the beers quality though. Not as overwhelming as many of the IPAs I have had are. Has a nice crispness to it.  D: I could drink these just about anywhere at anytime, but particularly when I am eating something spicy.  I was never much of an IPA guy until I had this, and it is still my favorite. I would recommend it to anyone.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,elmore,3.85,"Poured into a snifter from a single 12 oz bottle bought at a local Whole Foods about 1 week ago. I have also had this on tap several times. Small head with minimal lacing. Not a lot of active carbonation. Turbid golden color that glows orange when held up to the light.  Smells of sweet citrus fruit - more of an orange rind than the more common grapefruit I pick up from IPAs. Some earthy, grainy malts. I'm picking up something a little of offputting that I can't quite describe(maybe oxidation).  Hops dominate the palate. Malts not very apparent. Dry finish. Hops don't linger.  Somewhat watery mouthfeel. Carbonation a little low from the bottle, but was more effervescent when I had it on tap.  I think overall an average IPA. This bottle may have been a little ""off"" judging by the low, inactive carbonation. I'm a fan of Bells (especially their Expedition Stout), but I was not very impressed with this beer even the several times I had it on tap. I'm surprised it ranks in the top 100. I have had many better IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

There was a very thick head and plenty of lacing.  S - Lots of citrus smell and very sweet also. Almost smelled like a hoppy pine car air freshener if that makes sense.  T - Same as the smell. Citrusy hops and sweet malt taste. Great aftertaste.  M - Nicely carbonated. Pretty dry.  D - I was sad to drink my last one because it will be a long time before I get any more. I wish I could drink this every day. I guess with my local selection I really can't complain though.  Overall a solid beer.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

It's not a thick beer, but has a great texture.  Smells like citrus and floral hops. Less pine than most ""hoppy"" beers I try. Taste is truly outstanding. This is probably my new favorite IPA. The beer I think it probably reminds me the most of is 3Floyds Dreadnaught (my favorite DIPA). It's sweet, but has tons of hoppy bitterness to offset the malt and tropical fruits.  Very good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Mdog,3.9,"Appearance: Slightly hazy gold, decent head.  Smell: Citrus, lots of it.  Taste: Leans towards the hoppy side, but relatively balanced between a bready sweetness and citrus bitterness. Can get some astringency in the aftertaste.  Drinkability: Pretty good, but for some reason I usually only drink one of these in a sitting.  Some people swear by Two Hearted, for some reason it doesn't always sit with me very well. I like hoppy beers and this fits the bill, plus brings along some sweetness, but just isn't one of my favorites.

287,1093,bboven,4.44,"On the lighter side of the IPA spectrum, but that's okay. Clear golden body with a thin head and decent amounts of lacing.  All Centennial hops here. That's alright because they are great for aroma and flavor as well as bittering.  The hops hit you first and foremost. They don't scream at you like some IPA's can, but the malt is just a a tad too muted for the style. It's there, though, if only faintly.  Mouthfeel is carbonated very well, but seems a touch thin. Real snappy, almost peppery finish. It seems like this beer is meant to be had a bit colder than most in the style as it's lightness in body is rather refreshing.  This is my favorite beer. I won't be one of those guys that give it all fives, because I know stylistically it's a bit light on the malt side of things, but if you're a hophead go out and get some.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Definitely some grapefruit. Bit of a nice hop juiciness, with nice balance from a touch of caramel and toffee.  M: Just the right fullness with a good crisp finish and a nice lingering bitterness.

It developed a moderate head that settled back down quickly.  S - Bright flowery hops and some malty sweetness.  T - Balanced bitterness and a malty sweetness  M - the hops are strong and upfront, but the malts provide a decent balance. Its almost as good an IPA as Stone's. The controlled carbonation and moderate body make this very approachable. Excellent with spicy food.  D - Very solid IPA.

Excellent hop balance -- enough bitterness and hop presence to make it phenomenal, without overdoing it and sending it to the second-tier West Coast variety.

287,1093,Floydster,4.39,"12 ounce bottle acquired in a trade with pimpp, thanks for giving me the chance to try this very popular IPA from Bell's  Poured into my enormous Bell's one liter mug with a deep orange color that had a golden tint when held up to the light, soapy 1/2 white head that stuck around for about three minutes, decent retention, and some small amounts of lacing at the beginning  Smell was great, tons of different hop aromas, strong resin and floral scents, some sweet citrus as well, good amount of malt on the nose, large amounts of nice smelling hoppiness overall  Taste was nice with a dry hoppy flavor right off the bat that led to some pineapple and orange, followed by some more bitterness in the finish, this one got sweeter as it warmed and the citrus really started to overshadow some of the dryer hop variations, liked the way this tasted better colder, charcoal-like taste at first was good and small amount of malt complemented the hoppiness well, very nice india pale ale overall  Perfect amount of carbonation, the body seemed a little too thick for an IPA and could have probably passed for a DIPA, taste did not last very long either, pretty good mouthfeel overall  Could probably drink a six pack of this because it is very light on the stomach and it goes down easy, although the seven percent alcohol could really catch up to me, making me unsure about how good this could be as a session beer  This beer definitely deserves to be in the top one hundred, it is one of the better regularly available india pale ales out there, could definitely drink more of this in the future, the people that have access to the mini kegs of this are lucky, highly recommended",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ewright,3.69,"Moderate pour into a goblet produces a finger's width of coarse white head which fades to a thin collar and small island of foam within a minute or two. The beer is clear, slightly effervescent and a golden color tinged with orange.  Picking through the hoppy aroma, I find hints of lemon and orange, a bit of unidentified evergreen (pine, spruce?). There are no hints of malty counterbalance.  Hops... and not much else. As the beer hits the front of the tongue, there is no residual sweetness to balance the hops. This is a rather dry offering. As the beer moves toward the back of the tongue and throat, the bitterness shows up as a pleasant tingling. Aftertaste is dominated by floral hoppy notes.  The elevated hoppyness of this beer leads to a clean mouthfeel. This beer leaves less of a ""hoppy scuz"" on the tongue than some IPAs I've tried. I feel like I could still taste nuances in another non-IPA after this beer.  This is a smooth drinking beer, too high in alcohol to be a session beer, but not remarkable enough to spend an entire evening investigating its nuances.  Above average, a solid IPA, but not the earth-shattering experience some make it out to be.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,association330,4.28,"A - No date on the bottle, but I purchased the six-pack from my local store this morning, so it should still be fresh. Pours a very nice looking amber, with a pale golden two-finger head that slowly dissipates to a 3/4 finger cap which has excellent retention and leaves impressive lacing. I pulled this bottle from the fridge about 5 minutes before I poured it, to ensure it wasn't refrigerator-cold.  S - Mostly floral hops, with some citrus notes. A little pine? The scents were rather subtle overall, but I can tell this is going to be a hop-head's brew before I even taste it.  T - Distinctly hoppy, with a very crisp, bitter finish. Some citrus and pine notes, just like the nose promised. Perhaps the slightest hint of alcohol after the beer has warmed a bit more. Hoppy bitterness is offset by some caramel malts, and it's well-balanced. Long hoppy aftertaste - I drank one of these earlier this evening and I was still tasting a little hops a half-hour after the last sip.  M - Just the right amount of carbonation - doesn't feel forced at all. Moderate viscosity, but certainly not watery. Very smooth.  D - Quite bitter, which for an IPA is to be expected I suppose. I enjoy the bitterness, but my palate is usually ready for something else by the end of the bottle. That combined with 7.0% ABV ensures I usually only drink one of these in a sitting, and never more than two, so I feel that have to knock a point off here.  Overall - For hop-heads, this is a downright delicious, well-balanced beer. For people who aren't crazy about hops, you might want to steer in another direction.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MiguelMandingo,4.6,"This brew was recommended to me by HardTarget. He said ""this is your new 'White Whale'"". This was quite an awesome brew - I wish it was available in this area, it would easily make its way into my beer rotation and become a stand-by in my fridge. Thank you, HardTarget, it was an excellent recommendation, and a very unique IPA.  Poured a 12oz. bottle into a DFH shaped pint glass.  Appearance - It pours a hazy translucent golden orange. It created a 2 finger frothy white head that slowly dissipates. It never fully disappears and leaves a decent bit of lacing behind. The head retention is pretty amazing on this one.  Smell - The smell is pretty awesome. I get the standard IPA scents, but this one has a bit more as well. I can smell notes of grapefruit, lemon, slight pine, but overall it is very floral. There are also notes of mikans and tangerine which is tied closely with a sweetness that is fairly dominant in the scent.  Taste - The flavor is fantastic. I taste the same thing that I can smell in the scent. It is flowery, with notes of grapefruit, a hint of pine, and a decent bit of tangerine What I like about this beer is that is pretty balanced with the malt. There is a caramel sweetness that doesn't compete with or get overpowered by the hops - very balanced.  Mouthfeel - When I taste it, I can tell that this is an American IPA but it doesn't have that astringent, mouth tearing, palate destroying hop-slap-in-the-mouth feeling to it. It is velvety smooth with a light/medium body. The carbonation is fairly light, but it doesn't detract from the overall feel.  Drinkability - Very synergistic. Beer doesn't get more drinkable than this. If I could get this on a regular basis, I could easily drink a sixer to myself. This is an IPA I can could a ton of and still feel like my palate could handle another style of beer with no problem.  This brew was great. Go get some.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,xare,2.04,"Poured as a straw-gold color with a good sized head. Unfortunately, the head didn't have much retainment and only laced a few lines before completely disappearing. If it had maintained the lacing throughout the drink, I would have awarded it a perfect score.  Smell was very hoppy with hints of pine, citrus, grapefruit, and mainly had a bitter aroma to it.  Taste was very very hoppy. There were a lot of flavors hidden in there but I wish that they would have toned down the hops a lot more as all I was able to taste were hops. If the hops had been toned down just a notch, this would be an outstanding beer.  There was almost no carbonation but the overwhelming hops makes up for the lack of carbonation. It was a prickly mouthful that left an aftertaste of pine and hops.  Drinkability suffered from the prickliness of the beer and due to the pine aftertaste lingering well past its welcome. Overall, this is a decent beer but not one that I'd enjoy again unless I got a glass from a bad batch. Some reviewers have mentioned that they like the bottled version better, so I'll give the bottled version a try sometime.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

I have to go back across the border to get more next weekend.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,RblWthACoz,4.42,Pours a pretty foggy amber with a decent off white head. I could get a good whiff of this one even before I had poured it out of the bottle. Nose is perfumed pine hops. Flavor is a mouthful of hops that stays consistent. Thick hop flavors just stay with you. Feel has a good carbonation to it and a the liquid is pretty good as well. Overall this is a very good IPA. Definitely one for the hop heads.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Tilley4,4.73,"Unbelievable IPA here.  Nice hazy orange, nice foamy head. Looks really good.  Smells delicious as well. Very citrusy and hoppy, lots of grapefruit here. Very sharp and crisp smelling.  Extremely juicy citrusy hops on this with a small malt to back it up but this is mostly hops. Nice, crisp, sharp, clean citrusy hops....very nice.  The only thing that keeps this from being a true session beer is the 7%. Any more than 3-4 of these and I'd be fading out.  An excellent brew, excellent...This is one of my all time favorite brews....",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,brewdoc75,4.77,"Lovely clear orange color w/ a fantastic head. The head dwindles to a sticky lace throughout the life of the beer. Outstanding aroma w/ tangerine, lemon-lime, and grapefruit notes. It smells like a west-coast IPA, but better. The taste is phenomenal. The hops hit you over the head like an anvil from 12 stories. Great bitterness, but not too much. This beer showcases the flavors that the Centennial hop can provide. Citrus is an understatement. I like the type of citrus flavors w/ tangerine/orange flavors combined w/ a nice sharp grapefruit bite. A little piney at times too. The hops just dominate this brew. The malts are present, but not the star of the show. The mouthfeel is pretty solid for an IPA. Not too heavy, not too light.  Drinkable doesn't describe this beer. It is a staple. I wish I had this in my fridge all the time. It has incredible complexity and outstanding balance for an IPA. A must have for any beer drinker.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,lowbrau,4.34,"A wonderful beer, I feel obligated to buy one whenever I come across it. Pours a somewhat hazy, copper orange, with a strong, citrusy, hoppy aroma. A modest head leaves a thin, clingy lace. Very intense hop flavor. A bit of a palate buster due to the high hoppiness, but expected from the style, and drinkability doesnt suffer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,stemcell001,4.22,"Very nice color and clear with a good head. First whiff tells me there are plenty of hops - some pine and slight citrus notes. The first taste is pleasing bitter hops that are like the smell, pine and slight citrus. Very light malt body with a slight hint of roasted caramel malt. Very satisfying and easy to drink. This is a definitely a session beer and an excellent IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Tolann,4.6,"Just pouring this beer made me think to myself 'damn, why didn't I drink more of this when it was more readily available?!'  A - Golden hazy in color with a creamy head that teases the top of the glass. Foam hangs around for a while and leaves almost chunks behind and an unevenly laced glass.  S - Yum! A bunch of sweet, a bit citrus, and hops! Wrap that up with a bit of malty caramel. Such a lovely beer  T - Sweet hops and caramelly malts. This beer tugs at your heart strings in both directions.... hmm Two Hearted Ale. Now I get it!  M - Smooth with some carbonation. Not dry. Not a huge aftertaste, but you won't forget it. Really great beer.  D - Drink ability? YES! Bring me another case and another for tomorrow. I don't wanna share! Now leave me alone so I can enjoy my beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jkrich,4.5,"This was from a 1.3 gallon ""mini-keg"" purchased from a liquor store.  The ale poured a golden, clear orange color with a sustained white head with ample lacing on the conic pint glass.  As I released the vent on the top of the keg the surge of air brought a intoxicating grapefruity hop aroma. This aroma remained evident in the glass as well.  With all of the strong northwest, domestic hop aroma, one would expect a strongly hoppy flavor with a slight malt background. This ale is beautifully balanced between the hop and malt. The gentle hop flavor lingers on the tongue after an initial soft maltiness.  Very good carbonation and a slick mouthfeel from the keg.  This is truly a beautifully balanced beer. It is difficult to believe this ale is 7.0 % ABV. If it were not for the high ABV, this would be a perfect 5.0 for a session ale. Seek out this one. In the Louisville, KY area, you can find it at the Liquor Barns. In southern Indiana, ""The Keg"" liquor store in Clarkesville stocks this as well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Definately stands up to others I have had.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S: Bright grapefruit pith, green grass and slightly sweet.  T: Burst of crisp grapefruit pith, not too bitter, that explodes in the mouth that has a nice malt body. The aftertaste is amazing!  M: A joy for the mouth as the grapefruit pith is not an overkill the malts hold up the hops and the tongue is left a with a nice dry taste on the tongue and a great aftertaste on the tongue.  D: This is a great IPA session beer that I only wish my brother-in-law, who lives in MI, would drink instead of can after can of the Bud! I have a mission before me when I visit this spring!

287,1093,TheodorHerzl,4.82,"Pours a beautiful amber/orange hue with a good sized pearl white head. The head collapses fairly quickly, but this beer leaves some of the best lacing on the sides of the pint glass that I've seen. The nose makes itself known while pouring the beer into the pint glass. Heavy scents of pine, ripe grapefruit, and orange rind. The floral nose is well done and matches perfectly with the taste. The flavor profile is the winner for me here. Starts out with bitter hops but the delicate pale malt comes into play to round out the bitterness. Fresh citrus fruit flavor, pine, and the sweet malt just work so well. Medium body and medium carbination leaves a slight dry sensation after the drink. The mouthfeel is actually a little creamy as well. I could drink this pretty much anytime of the year. Great offering from Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BlackBearForge,4.59,"The aroma of this beer hits you the moment you begin to pour it. It pours a lovely somewhat hazy peach-tinged pale orange gold. Paler than I expected, with a nice creamy white two finger head which faded quickly to a thin covering that actually rebuilds when the glass is agitated. Lacing was minimal but present.  The aroma as I said hits you right away, big, citrusy, floral and even hoppily bitter. It's the stongest aroma from any beer I've tried yet. I smelled oranges, grapefruit, tangerines and even peach all in a big floral hoppy breath.  As it warms the taste takes off. There is a big bitter hoppy presence on the finish but the strong malt backbone balances it perfectly. The flavor of grapefruit and citrus dominates but not in a bad way, all the flavors blend in a wonderful balance, from the strong pale malt backbone (perhaps a bit biscuity) to the big citrusy hoppy bitterness.  Mouthfeel is also the creamiest of any beer I've had yet. It's medium bodied with a fine carbonation. Smooth and perhaps slick as well.  This beer grows on me the more I drink it. It's very different from other IPAs I've had, and that's a good thing. Variety and quality is what good beer is all about. This beer is also strong but the alcohol is completely invisible, which is a nod to the the craft that went into brewing this beer. Highly recomended!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Strix,4.37,"Yummy. I was expecting more of a hop-overloaded blast of this after hearing about it. Hops obviously dominate, however I was impressed with the balance in this. Smells of grapefruit and hops. Taste is grapefruity, gets a little more grassy as it warms, but supported by a nice malt backbone. The sensations of freshly baked bread and oranges, and a sort of nice woody flavor are also apparent. This has none of the off-flavors that I've come across in some heavily-hopped pale ales. Very nice substantial mouthfeel, and the 7% abv is completely hidden. This beer is solidly well-done and really grows on you.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,malcontent,4.15,Clear (is this Bell's?!?) copper colored body sports a thin layer of foamy head aided by generous lacing.  Brown sugar-laced grapefruit comprises the hop profile here. A flowery bouquet fames a sweet malt body.  An even-keeled approach to a highly-hopped style. The restraint is impressive and sophisticated. Sweet and spicy hops mingle with an orange flesh/caramel malt body. Finishing bitterness is tempered by a sweetness that must be a byproduct of an enhanced grain bill. The sweetness eventually builds to become a touch cloying.  A bit slick although that's not entirely unexpected given the hop content. Perhaps overly thick as well.  I enjoy this a good deal although I sincerely question whether or not I could drink more than two in a sitting without getting tired of,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,lackenhauser,4,"Very nice, pale copper color with a decent head. Nice grassy and citrusy aroma. Blast of bitterness though not overwhelming. Moderate amount of grapefruit flavor.

It is quite coudy which argues in favor of cask conditioning.nice orange color.  iT has a bright fruit hop aroma. with a pleasing hop bite at first sip and a good chew to it's mouthfeel. nice piney and graprfruit finish.  a great beer made better by being ""REAL"" I enjoyed the cask over 4 days with pleasing results each day. the carbonation is lighter each day, but the flavors grew in complexity.  nice beer to study, I even tried a bottled one next to this and was surprsied by the vast differences.

Poured vigorously and the head was a good 2 fingers. Nice lacing here as well.  S: Floral hop aroma with plenty of citrus burn on the back of the nose. Great.  T: This is one tremendous IPA. Hops are powerful and hit right to the taste without messing around. The balance was there and the citrus bitterness was tight.  M: Absolutely great coating from the oily hops that has such good texture.  D: The alcohol is hardly noticeable and it just goes down so smooth, I could drink these all night- wish I was able to get more out East. I put this one right on part with the 90 minute.

287,1093,NCBeernut,4.88,"Poured from a 1.32 Gallon MINI KEG of Two Hearted! I had no idea they sold these and I had to buy it.  Bubbley off-white 2 finger head that leaves lacing all over the place. Hazy straw colored yellow, but with strong orange hues; a golden orange galaxy. Delicious citrusy aromas, where grapefruit seems to dominate the aroma hops. The hoppiness does not overpower some sweet maltiness that pulls through, even in the aroma. Same hop presence in the taste, but with a nice orange zest, balanced by the same sweet caramel, slightly bready maltiness that reminds me a little of the german malt profile common in oktoberfests. Hop oils leave a little bit of tanin feeling on your tounge. Yummy beer, very well carbonated. I have this 1.32 gallon keg between two of us for tonight...so pretty drinkable. I finish one and really want another.

287,1093,Lothore,4.17,"A- Pours a golden yellow hue with a 1.5 finger eggshell head which leaves a good amount of lacing when it fades. Not to much carbonation is visible.  S- Smells is prodomenately grapefruit and citrus hops, also there is a bready, malty backbone  T- Much more tame than I was expecting but in a good way. Exquisitely balanced grapefruit hops that end sweet and malty. I like this one because even though it has a defined hop presence, it really doesn't overpower anything.  M- Medium bodied, with carbonation a little on the low side for my tastes but this doesn't detract from the brew overall.  D- This is a hugely drinkable IPA. I love IPAs and DIPAs with the grapefruit/citrus hops and this one has that in spades. It's well balanced but my only beef with it is theres nothing that really jumps out and grabs me about it. Would be great (and deadly) to session.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,cracgor,4.54,Amber colored beer with thin white head. Has a nice fruity aroma I can smell a mile away with a good oily hop coming out closer to the beer. Pretty amazing taste.

Drinks pretty well...a good beer to enjoy most of the night.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Sweet, malty citrus: orange peel and grapefruit. Slightly spicy, but mostly lots of pungent floral/bitter hops. Exactly what I look for in this style.  Even more hops, bitter and mouthwatering. Some toasty malt and citrus. Subtle notes of pine and spice. Really well balanced and complex in flavor. Not a jumble of flavors; everything is well pronounced and organized. The flavors blend beauitfully.  Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Crisp and bitter but with a good lingering hoppiness. Not too dry. One of my favorite everyday IPAs.

Beautiful orange... very pretty color... like a translucent orange poppy... a little hop haze is expected.. pillowy 1-finger head.  You know this is going to be good... huge citrus aroma with a little pine needles. I've always thought Two Hearted is one of the best smelling IPA's ever.. that being said, this one may be a little aged... but still it blows most others out of the water... some nice caramel malts are apparent but are whispy.. overpowered easily by the hops.  Tastes very much like a West Coast IPA.. great balance... perfect balance for an IPA... not overly bitter... mmm. Grapefruit and lime leaves... malts are very prescent, but hard to pick apart. Toast and biscuits. Perfect mouthfeel and carbonation despite the rough luggage ride. Yummy.  Two Hearted and I go back a couple of years, and this time is not my favorite... maybe not the freshest bottle... but, I hate saying this (living in the West), a never ending keg of brewery fresh Two Hearted is my desert island beer ... as long as I have a nice malty German keg too. :)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,cjveitch,4.23,"I have long been a fan of Bell's, but somehow never tried the two hearts. After hearing all the hype surrounding this beer, I finally decided to try it with a friend. The results are as follows:  Poured into a pint glass from a bottle and immediately noticed the amazingly rich golden color that is very hazy...similar to a hefeweisen. I would say this beer must be unfiltered. On top lay a frothy white head that worked its way down to a thin layer of lacing from edge to edge of the glass. I honestly don't know how this could be improved, so I gave it a perfect 5.0 on the appearance.  The aroma of this beer is nothing short of enticing. I smell some hops but mostly fruit...probably dried apricots or something similar.  Finally, the taste. A little hard to describe. It's a simple beer that just tastes good. Not incredibly hoppy, and definitely not malty while it rests in the mouth. Well balanced, but with no distinguishing (i.e. overbearing) flavors sticking out. The beer does seem to be dry hopped as it goes down the throat (in no way is this unpleasant!).  I want to keep drinking this beer just to figure out what that taste is. That means I ranked the drinkability high.  My review of the taste may seem harsh, but in reality it's just because I'm having trouble describing it. An amazing beer overall...definitely living up to the hype.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

S = A very strong hops bouquet. Can also detect the sweetness of the malt though, this is not simply a hopheads delight. Good floral highlights but more complex than simply hops.  T = Hops are immediately apparent in the taste, but there is also a sweet malt flavor, slight caramel taste, some fresh cut lemons, fresh cut flowers. More complex than most IPAs I've had recently. A very good flavor, very well balanced.  M = Light to medium body, good carbonation, good mouthcoating. It makes my mouth happy.

Head fades slowly to one finger and has great retention. Plenty of lacing is left behind in the glass.  S- Quite promising. A beautiful bouquet of hops with a citrus aroma upfront and pine, floral, and grassy mixing well in the background.  T- Initial flavor is mild and highlights a balance of citrus and grassy hop flavor. Floral and pine hop flavor seem to mix well for the finish-with the floral hop flavor being semi-dominant. A blast of hop bitterness also enters for the finish. All that lingers is a medium strength resonance of hop bitterness. All the beautiful hop flavors are gone.  M- Medium to high carbonation and mildly oily body.  D- After having great IPAs like Alesmith, Racer 5, Centennial, and SN Anniversary this one doesn't even compare to me. Its not bad-and I can certainly drink it but is only an average IPA to me.

If you feel strongly that I should classify the serving type as something else, drop me a beermail.  A: The ale has a hazy orange color, like a tea or apple juice. The keg pours with a thick 3 plus finger head that requires two pours to fill my glass. Light hints of dried lace evidence that head.  S: The nose is hoppy delicious, thick with orange peel and citrus notes. Solid but subtle caramel malts support the hop nose.  T: Does life get any better than sittin' and sippin' on an IPA like this? The hop profile in this beer is damn near perfect, an excellent blend of citrusy tangerine and sweet but bitter orange peel. Caramel graininess mid-sip seems to rejuvenate the mouth, resetting it for the blast of hops at the end of the sip. The hop profile, either warm or cold, is a real treat, bitter without scalding the tastebuds. This is, by far, one of my all-time favorites.  M: Sweet pungent hops dominate the ale, creating an incredible hop profile that almost defies words. This is easily one of the best IPAs that you'll ever encounter.  D: With proper focus and devotion, I think that i could finish the mini keg in one day. As it is, it'll probably only last two days (this is a good one for the Ravens MNF game).

287,1093,MMAJYK,4.37,"A- Orange/brown with yellow highlights. This beer is non transparent. After a semi agressive pour, it leaves a bright white head of only one finger. After drinking this one down, it leaves a little sticky lace on the glass and the 1/8"" of bright white film still covers the top of the surface.  S- Man, where to begin. This to me is one of the greatest aspects of this beer. The first smell to me is pineapple. Next, I pick up oranges (citrus) and alot of hop smell. I also can pick up bananas on the end of the nose.  T- The tastes follow closely with the nose: very hoppy, fruity and sweet. I can detect that this is a moderately high ABV beer since I can taste the alcohol, but very well hidden. It also leaves a bitter after taste.  M- Mouthfeel is damn near perfect. Middle thickness, carbonation is just right and the malt applied makes this beer smooth as silk.  D- Very drinkable beer. Easy going down, easy on the nose. I love seeing this one in my glass knowing it is mine.  I really like this beer! For what it is worth, this is one of my new favorite beers.

Unfortunately, the aromatics aren't as pronounced as the flavor, but it'll suffice. Two Hearted has more of a vegetable hop rather than citric, and I wouldn't isolate pine as noteworthy. Refreshing with a focused delivery, as an upfront juicyfruit dominates hop bitterness and ends up ""wet"", but with a mild soap finish.

The first sip of Bell's Two Hearted Ale nearly tricks you into thinking it's a sweeter beer, but the bitter hoppiness on the backside reminds you that you're drinking a nice, hearty Pale.

287,1093,lightindarkness,4.07,"I like this beer, a lot.  A - Golden-orange color, poured a bubbly 1"" head that sat down to a nice creamy 1/2""  S - Initial pine scent, a lot of hops, with an uncommon lingering sweetness, almost like sugar, sort of like standing next to one of those stands at the fair that makes the candied almonds, mmm.  T - A lot of hoppy bitterness, balanced well with a malty richness. Finishes with a lot of hops. Bitterness hangs on the tongue and mouth indefinitely. If you're familiar with rating wine, the taste of this beer definitely has a long decay, lingering well after the sip is gone - that's a good thing.  M - Smooth and light at first, pretty good with a decently balanced ABV for this American IPA. Stays smooth, and becomes a little heavier when it unavoidably mixes with your saliva as your mouth waters from the bitterness and deliciousness.  D - As the taste fades from each sip, I want to go back for more. A very drinkable beer, not to heavy (though the alcohol content should be noted), a very satisfying blend of hop and malt for an American IPA.

A nice fluffy chunky head leaves thick sticky lace about the glass. Powerful floral and fruity hops nose. Some piney grass elements. Taste is a full on hoppy affair. Seems some what tempered by sweet malt elements. The sweetness also hints at grapefruit and green apples. Mouthfeel is fairly full for such a hop centered brew. Finishes a bit tart. I found this to be a drinkable beer, not something you want to session, but a good dinner or conversation beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Lambstrong,4.47,"The appearance is golden, somewhat cloudy with a rich creame head. It has a great flora aroma which lets you know immediatly what you're about to experience.

287,1093,jasonjlewis,4.1,Thanks to NCSUdo for the sample.  Nice 3 finger head with great head retention. Cloudy orange color.  Smell is of faint pale malts and of strong cascades (I think).  Taste is nicely balanced between pale malts and cascade hops. Very nice flavor.  Mouthfeel: Tastes like it was injected with carbonation. That's my only problem with this beer.  Such a nice and balanced beer. I could make a session out of this.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,thisisbigrob,3.82,"12 oz. bottle poured into a standard pint glass.  A: Poured a hazy orange-gold with a golden-white head of decent size and density.  S: Very fragrant hops with a slight malt underbelly.  T: Hoppy but not very complex. Slight alcohol flavor coming through.  M: A little weak tasting; not very full. Carbonation is a good level.  D: Going down nice and smooth, and the buzz is hitting me pretty good.

T- Well balanced, soft malty flavor up front with a nice dry finish.  M- Very smooth, a nice velvety texture, good body.

287,1093,LeftonJackman,3.45,"Was poured for me at Bricco in Akron  A: A cloudy apricot color with almost no head to speak of. The lace was reluctant at times, but left it's mark.  S: Conifer, hoppy and a hint of sweet pineapple. Faint, but present.  T: Citrusy with a touch of spice. Strong hops out weigh the citrus a little, leaving me wondering what more of a balance would be like. Good IPA.  M: Nice medium-ish body but a little too bitter on the finish.  D: Good for one beer. I am glad I tried it, but might not be my first choice in ordering again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mpyle,4.3,"Fairly pale golden color for an IPA. Reasonably clear, but not brilliant. Pours a thick head with good retention. Some residual lacing.  A slightly piney hop aroma, noticeable but not overpowering.  Initial flavor has a wonderful balance. Enough bittering to prevent even a hint of sweetness, but without so much bitterness that it is an IBU machine. Malt has a secondary voice, but it is there. A very gentle transition, with no distinct hop bite in the finish - just a lingering, pleasant bitterness. The hop flavor/bitterness balance really seems to be perfect for what I feel an American IPA should be.  Medium body and carbonation. No astringency. A hint of alcohol warming, which isn't totally out of place here, but slightly surprising for a 7% ABV beer.  A very drinkable IPA. Not harshly bitter while being a decidedly hoppy beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BucBasil,4.21,"Appearance: Poured from the bottle into an imperial pint. Brew is a orangish gold with a two fingers thick, fluffy, slightly off-white head.  Smell: Incredible hop aroma starts floral with hints of citrus. A hint of sweetness comes through at the end. If I could make my house smell like this I would.  Taste: Hop flavors are (gasp!) actually pretty balanced for an American IPA. Same hop profile as on the nose but with a bit of a breadysort of a midpalate. Then the hops come back in for a refreshing finish.  Notes: A fantastic beer that I will definitely drink again. I'm not usually a fan of American IPAs because they're so unbalanced, but this was nice. Good job Bell's...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Not much malt.  Taste: Sweet & fruity carries through to the finish, followed by a medium bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium to light bodied, creamy.  Final Statement: A very drinkable IPA but the strange tropical fruit flavours make me think it was a pretty citrus hoppy IPA that is a little passed its prime. Would like to try again some day. Not a bad beer as it was though, just not an outstanding one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The smell featured a strong piney and citrusy hop with touches of white pepper. Some lightly sweet malts detected as well.  The taste consisted of an upfront resiny hop with some touched of spicy pepper and sweet orange. Some lightly sweet malts picked up as well.  The mouthfeel was of average fullness with a dry finish.

More piney than anything.  Prickly piney hops in the taste. This is a fairly big bitterness, and a big hop taste. The beer gets slightly earthy to go along with a nice caramel flavor. A great IPA.  This beer is exceptional. To date is this best IPA I have had. Possibly lacking in balance, but that is how I like my IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

My friends who think Miller Lite is really good, like it. My friends who adore Bud, like it. My friends who lust for the most extreme beers to be found, enjoy it. At my parties I always buy lots of Two Hearted, and it is always the first beer gone (a sad moment).  I tend to dislike what everyone likes, but, in the case of this beer, I celebrate that pure goodness appeals to all.

287,1093,FuzzyGuy84,4.01,"12oz bottle poured into the SA Glass  A - Light amber in color, extremely high level of carbonation. Thin, tall bright white head with tremendous retention. Opaque but not cloudy.  S - Sweet, citrusy hop smell. Notes of grapefruit and pineapple.  T - Surprisingly bitter, particularly at the back of the mouth. Very mellow front where the hops detected in the nose really come through. Complex but a bit overpowering.  MF - Definitely a 'chewy' beer, with a mild bite due to carbonation. Very nice.  D - Not a beer to be chugged - each taste packs a bitter hop burst to the back of the mouth, rendering a taste taken in quick succession rather dull. Best enjoyed slowly on its own, or with food that can hold up to its bite.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Nice and intense  Taste features the grapefruit and bitter hops with some malt background which gives this beer a decent balance. Good carbonation and pretty smooth mouthfeel. Overall a very enjoyable IPA. Especially since this was 7% abv. I had no idea. I figured it was a little under 6% (that may seem like a small difference,but a difference nonetheless).

Taste was good: dominated by hops with some citrus overtones. It had a light sweetness to the taste. It felt a little gummy in my mouth, the resin seemed to let the hoppiness linger in my mouth long after quaffing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BeerSox,4.92,"12oz bottle into nonic.  Accidentally started off by absent mindedly pouring into a regular drinking glass I had for my water. Slightly hazy hue that perfectly matches honey. The head is about one finger thick and slowly settles to a thin cap leaving a solid wall of lacing in its place. The color of the head is khaki. Rings of lacing show up down the glass from each sip.  The aroma is sharp and grassy, almost completely overtaking the biscuity malts. The hop aroma has a flowery quality to it. It's actually very enjoyable. Maybe a touch of diacetyl (yeast byproduct) is in there, but nothing that would discourage anyone from drinking it. The high amount of alochol is well hidden, even when the beer is closer to room temperature.  This one exhibits a great balance of hops and malts. Usually in an American IPA the hops sometimes make it impossible to taste the malts, but not in this one. Although the sharp citrusy hops show up first, they eventually give way for some light toasty grain. Though, the hops eventually end up taking over again in the end, and linger for a while after each sip. The feel is smooth without too much carbonation.  This one lived up to the hype. I only wish I didn't accidentally waste some of it by pouring it in the wrong glass. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,objectivemonkey,4.6,"Into a pint glass, pours a soft, clear amber, a big ass frothy off-white head with loads of lacing. The aroma is powerful, resinous, piney hops exploding from the bottle, retching the air with citrus and fruit, fantastic. And if my olfactories weren't sent into overdrive, my taste buds sure were. The bitterness is jarring, the hops biting, the mouth delighting, the malts enlivening (and balancing, for sure). Its a sensory cornucopia, but not quite perfect. One could ask for a little more malt to balance, a little more body to hold, but thats cents on the dollar on this fine, bad ass beer. There isn't much to say about this beer that hasn't already been said, so I'll conclude; highly drinkable, highly recommended, yum yum",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Unfortunately, I can't get it anymore because of the crazy distribution laws in Illinois.  It pours a hazy orange with beautiful floral aromatics shooting out of the bottle. It has nice frothy white head that sticks to the glass. The nose is all hops, very floral and colorful. the taste is like heaven. perfect hop blend that jolt the taste buds. and a great bitter finish that isn't overwhelming.

287,1093,Procrastinator,4.21,"12 oz. brown bottle stamped 7877 on rear label, which equates to being packaged on Mar 26, 07 according to their website. Poured into a tall slender mug.  Appearance: cloudy orange and gold body with off-white head which recedes to leave sticky lacing. Looks more of a hefeweizen than an IPA. Residual hops has got something to do this.  Smell: resinous, grassy hops with an earthy fresh smell. Sweet caramel and grains. I can't believe this smells this good at seven months old.  Taste: first and foremost are the hops. Piney fresh with bits of sweetened grapefruit rinds. A caramel sweetness wanes in and out to keep the hops from becoming overpowering.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied and chewy with the fresh taste and feel of hops. The carbonation is spot on for me and was almost unnoticeable trying to see it through a haze. This is creamy good.  Drinkability: I really enjoyed this beer after being let down a bit by Oberon. It's fresh tasting qualities and hidden alcohol along with it's creaminess and balance made for one easy drinking beer. I will seek this one out on draft.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A - Dark golden hue, quarter inch head that didn't hang out for too long, laces well.  S - Definitely more potent than bottled versions. The citrus cuts through the hop smell and is quite pungent. Almost like fresh oranges.  T - It differs considerably, this has less of a dry finish and is much creamier. Still tastes great, but it seems like some of the bite is gone.  M - Feels medium bodied, very smooth.  D - Still high, I could put these back all night. It was thicker and less bitter than it's bottled counterpart.

I don't know if it was just the shock of finding Bell's stuff in Ontario but, man, what a fantastic beer. The aroma was shockingly hoppy, with those great American pine-and-grapefruit hop flavours shining through but not overpowering. Expertly balanced flavour, with those same hop flavours supported by a great malt backbone. Restrained carbonation, and zero off-flavours all the way through. I love this beer. I want more.

T: Some citrus and grapefruit hit you up front, yet this beer possesses a nice hit of malty sweetness that provides balance. A bit of alcohol warmth creeps in, but overall this is very nicely balanced. It's got a strong hops bitterness to it, but it's not overpowering. Well done.  M: Smooth with a crisp finish.  D: I wish this was sold in the Boston area! I would add this to my rotation. It's a great IPA that's probably not too far off from being a DIPA.

It finally goes downn to a ridge rimmed cap that does the beer justice.  S-A very clean smelling grapefruit tangerine odour. Not too strong yet not weak.  T-Avery pleasing bitterness, grapefruit and other citrus. The bitterness remains throughout. The malt is slightly sweet, mostly dry and bread like. The aftertaste is very bitter and leaves a great impression.  M-A twinge above medium bodied. the carbonation is there to cut through the oiliness of the hops.  D-This is a very good IPA. A very good hop combo produces a very good punch for the hophead in me. Overall the only negative is there could be a bit more of a malt presence.

Floral undertones folowed by light malt whispering ""I'm here too""  T- Bitter citrus with floral coming through in the taste more than the smell would suggest. Light malt flavor wraps it all up without detracting from the hops.  M- Rather effervescent, very refreshing.  D- The only thing getting in the way here is the 7.0abv. Very drinkable for a non-session beer.  In my opinion easily among the best IPA's out there.

The hops have a big grapefruit and orange punch right up front. Sweet malt and caramel attempt to make their way through and almost succeed.  The hops hit you hard again upon tasting. Citrus and floral notes that give way to such a pleasantly bitter finish. All the while a mingling of sweet maltiness with floral hoppiness just light up your senses with pleasure.  This American IPA is medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Good body and quite hearty.

I seem never to be in a place or time to review it properly, but I finally find myself alone with a bottle with everyone else in bed and decided to have at it. Pours a beautiful slightly hazy golden with a very healthy head that sticks around and leaves some very nice lacing. The smellis wonderful. Deep and bright aromas of citrusy hops, some slight grassiness, and a slight hint of malt in the back to balance. Perfect ipa aromas in my book. The taste is also wonderful. The same wonderful citrus flavors and bitterness, a slight sense of graininess, and the hops turn earthy and spicy as the flavor goes on. Not the most bitter beer I've had, or the one with the longest finish, or the most perfectly balanced, but the overall package is nice- quite hoppy while retaining a certain subtlety. Very nice. The mouthfeelis full and slightly grainy. I like it, but I'd be happy if it were slightly less grainy.

The lacing is strong and forms solid walls on the sides of the glass.  S- Some light husky maltiness on the nose, but dominated by earthy slightly citrusy hops notes.  T- The husky straw greets my mouth first. This is quickly taken over by a dominating bitter flavor. Some citrus flavors- very pithy grapefruit and lime zest. Also some grassy tones. There is a decent complexity to the taste, but overall I found it to be weaker than expected.  M- The bitterness of the beer grabs my tongue and refuses to let go- the aftertaste only streathens its hold. There is a decent creaminess along with this.

A: A slightly hazy/murky deep orange with barely any head from the cask conditioning.  S: Very mellow hop profile, much less than out of the bottle. Appears rather thin, but still a hearty color and enticing bouquet.  T: Hops are out the frame on this one. Cask definitely imparts a different flavor profile for this one, as it tastes more bitter than out of the bottle, but you can definitely taste the freshness as well.  M: Rather thin, but tasty nevertheless. The carbonation is lower of course because of the natural fermentation inside the firkin, but hop residuals are all over the palate still.  D: To be honest, not as drinkable as the bottled version. Nevertheless, it was definitely worth it to taste it out of the firkin in order to see how the beer I know and love changes with its fermentation process.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,LeftyBWS,4.5,"Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle into a Sam Adams pint glass. A: Amber-orange color, rather cloudy. 1.5 to 2 inches of foamy white head that leaves a layer atop the beer. A little amount of slowly-rising carbonation is visible. Lovely, thick and sticky rings of lacing all the way down the glass. S: Warm and nippy floral hops are right in your face. There's a hint of honey/caramel sweetness behind the hops, with some spicy citrus scents, as well. Perhaps a whiff of sweet melon? T: Well-balanced and pleasant throughout. Floral hops lead the way, followed by a taste of citrus which blends into a caramel malt flavor. All three of these tastes follow through to the finish and fade out in unison. Hard to say which one is more prevalent in the end; it really depends on what you try to notice, since the balance between them is amazing. M: Bitterness up front with the hop tastes, but a smoother feel is brought in by the malts. Finish is creamy and satisfying. D: Very drinkable. Never noticed the 7% ABV. Overall, a fantastic IPA. The malt character is more noticeable than in other hoppier IPAs that I like, but that just makes this one stand out in my mind for accomplishing this with such a perfect hop/malt balance for this style.

Smell- Malt upfront with much floral hop background. Not a lot outside of that, some river soft water scents.  Taste- Creamy and hoppy, I could drink this for quite a bit and will. Hops open up the flavor and the malt comes in and balances it well. This beer, as most real ales have a lot of complexity within.  Mouthfeel- Much like I just ate ice cream. The cream lingers and the abv doesn't hurt things either.  Drinkability- This is so much more drinkable. I could drink this all night if there weren't so many other unsampled taps in this location.

287,1093,ianrca19,4.8,"I have to be honest, I've been skeptical of Bell's. They're still fairly new to the Twin Cities, and I've felt as though they're just another passing beer fad.  Well, they've just earned another Minnesota beer fan.  I love everything about this beer, right down to the six-pack packaging. The natural, washed-out looking greens and the northwoodsy fish... I have a very big soft spot for lakes and pines, and this beer hits home right off the bat. Pop the top off the bottle, and you're immediately hit with this intense, fruity/floral hoppy blast. This beer smells amazing. It pours a bright and opaque golden orange, with a thin bubbly head. Upon the first sip, your mouth is met with an intense but pleasant hop burn. I've had some IPAs that hurt to drink, but this one is definitely much more friendly. As the hops disappear, they are replaced by a sweet grapefruit flavor, just about the most perfect fruity flavor in a beer that's not put there on purpose. The finish is thick and rich, with a sweet and spicy malt finish. You do this over and over and before you know it, your beer is gone and you are sad, because this one of the best-tasting beers that I (and apparently a lot of other people!) have ever had.

287,1093,Lnedrive14,4.49,"On tap at Capital Ale House as part of their Beer Geek Week:  A: Nothing special here. Crisp, if hazy orange color. Looks semi-dense, definitely not a thin brew. Very little head, but i think that was because it took a while to get the beer to me.  S/T: Grapefruit and orange peel, good dose of piny hops. Taste has a bit of sugary sweetness to balance out the citrus. Amount of hops is almost perfect - present and powerful, but not dominating.  M/D: To me, it is the mouthfeel that really distinguishes the good IPAs from the great. This is incredibly full-bodied, which really allows the flavors to linger for a while and penetrate to every corner of your mouth. Despite the great list of beers, i almost ordered another one - could have drank this all night.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,scottakelly,4.85,"A  Golden orange color. Slightly hazy. Big, fluffy white head with lots of lacing.  S  Lots of hops. Spicy, citrusy, piney.  T  Lots of flavor hops in this one. Lots of bitter hops and aroma too, but the flavor hops stand out. Sweet, earthy, citrusy, bitter. The malt backbone is perfect: providing just enough support for the big hop profile.  M  Refreshingly crisp.  D  Immensely high.  This is my favorite beer. I crave Two-Hearteds hoppy goodness often.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,NatetheGreat,4.25,"A - orange-brown color with a large, thick, dense head and solid lacing throughout drink.  S - aroma was very good, heavy floral notes, somewhat perfumy and honey-like sweetness. Probably the best smelling APA I've had.  T - sweet honey like malt up front and strong floral and earthy hop finish. Nice balance, leaning toward hops, like a solid APA. Some citus (grapefruit), but not much on my palate. Bitterness is present in finish, but not overpowering IMO.  M - thicker than I anticipated for the style, but not unpleasant. Definately not a watered down feel.  D - Very good. While the alcohol is on the higher end (7%) the strong hop/malt presence masks it. Very refreshing and a great expression of the APA style. In some ways, much like Sierra Nevada, but I think the quality may be better.  Overall, this is a great pale ale, and highly recommended. More expensive than some other similar offerings, but it's worth trying.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,hellcatsjg,4.02,"Appearance: Slightly hazy orange color. Thick two fingered head that settles and leaves a good amount of lacing as you go.  Smell: Piney hops dominate. Grapefruit and citrus in the background. Pleasant aroma.  Taste: Citrus takes the front in the taste. Each swallow turns into a piney hoppy taste with a bit of floral hops in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and easy to drink. The hoppy aftertaste will be a bit much for those who do not consider themselves hopheads.  Drinkability: Good tasting brew with mabey a bit too hoppy of an aftertaste to appeal to non hop fans. Would not have more than one of these at a time. Not that it is bad, but leans a bit too much on the hops. I still believe that the 90 Minute is the ultimate beer when it comes to this style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Atron67,4.32,"This came in the pitcher as a foggy amber with a solid whiteish frothy head that stuck around forever. could smell the piney hops a mile away.

287,1093,srrn,4.4,"This beer pours a hazy amber with white head that quickly reduces. Some lacing on the glass. Smell of piney hops. Taste of same with a good malt backbone. Well balanced. The mouthfeel is perfect for the style, right carbonation, oilyness and a dry finish. I only bought one, I'll need to pick this up again. Paired well the very hot Thai curry. I do not detect the citrus most others seem to, I get pine and bitterness.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,irishtimepiece,4.06,"Picked up on a recent trip to Florida along with Kalamazoo Stout and Oberon.  Pours a slighty hazy pale orange with an inch and a half of off white head. Lacing...? Lacing...? More like sheeting. The entire glass is covered with lace. Ridiculous retention as well... when I finished 20 minutes later, there was still a half inch of head sitting in the bottom of the glass. Smell is very floral, reminds me of my local Elissa IPA. Taste is a mix of piney and floral hops. Very subtle malt, almost masked entirely by hops. Mouthfeel is nice. Chewy and on the lower end for carbonation. Strength aside, highly drinkable. A very, very nice IPA. I wish I could get it in my area.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,saintwarrick,4.88,"This brew pours and orangey, amber. Big head with sticky lacing all around the glass. Aroma is distinctively citrusy and piney with some caramel while the taste reflects a lot of citrus. Big hops explode in this beer but do not overwhelm the smooth taste of this brew. Very clean and smooth despite being hopped up. Big bitter aftertaste lets you know what beer you just drank. Very dry finish. A damn good IPA not to be passed up.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mmmbeer,4.37,"12 oz. bottle, batch 7796 - packaged 1/16/07. It pours a hazed, unfiltered amber/gold, with low carbonation, and a big, three-finger head that leaves large clumps of foam on the glass. The aroma consists of floral, perfumy, and piney hops, white grapefruit, pineapple?, mango?, and a touch of biscuity malts. About the same in taste, with floral, citric, and piney hops leading the way, bringing with them a hefty bitterness that is only lightly balanced by the malts. Medium in body and carbonation, it has a long, dry, and refreshing finish - overall a pretty drinkable IPA, and a good go-to beer, but at 7%, it can sneak up on you rather easily.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bosco7,4.59,"Pours a slight hazy orange color with a rocky white head that doesn't give up.  Pungent grapefruit, bready, perfumey floral, and caramel like aromas. Smells fresh and in your face. Beautiful.  Starts off with a hint of caramel that moves into huge perfumey floral flavor components (reminiscent of Stone's IPA) and ruby red grapefruit pulp. Some mild bubblegum. Plenty of dry bitterness in the finish.  This is an IPA man. I thought I would never say this but, this is an East Coast IPA that contends with the best from California. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,cjgator3,4.62,12oz bottle poured into pint glass. Pours a pale golden amber color with a nice creamy off-white head with good retention and lacing. The aroma is probably the best aroma of any IPA I have ever smelled. Fresh citrusy hops immediately fill the air and just dares you to take a sip. The taste much like the aroma is a hop heads paradise. The hops seemingly explode in your mouth making you die to take the next sip. Wow! This is one hell of a brew that will certainly become a staple in my fridge. Highly Recommended!,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Drew966,4.3,"Two Hearted Ale pours a light copper color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a piney, resinous hop aroma. The flavor is also dominated by resinous and piney hops. There is a strong malt backbone in there somewhere, but that's exactly where it needs to be, in the background. The mouthfeel seems a bit on the thin side perhaps, but that hardly bears mentioning.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,abcsofbeer,4.35,"The pour results in a pale amber color that is very clear with a decent amount of rising bubbles. Since the pour was generous, I was given a three finger head, off-white in color. The lingering head allows for specks of sticky lace.  The aroma is a sweet flowery smell with a nice balance of hop oils and scents of pine. The taste is excellent with a strong hop bitterness and a nice balancing maltiness. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with that IPA spiciness. A very good example of the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,genog,4.17,"Had this on tap the other night at Gallos Tap Room. 44oz of this beer and thats a great night. Pours an orange hazy color from the cold tap. Smell is like a huge floral garden. Massive hops make this beer smell amazing. Taste is citrus, hoppy, with an absolutely awesome balance. High carbonation on this one and slight warming alcohol presence make this an all around good presentation. Over 2 1/2 years ago, long before I was ever a BeerAdvocate, we used to go to Gallos and order this beer to try something different. Two of this would really rock our socks, and make for a nice evening. Little did I know how awesome this beer really is.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,franksnbeans,4.65,"My first beer from cask and love it. Cloudy burned orange with a nice off-white head and full lacing down the glass until I finished it. Looks unbelievable. Powerful scents of floral and citrus, strong hops, the nose is much better this time then out of the bottle. Tastes of strong citrus and powerful dry and bitter hops immediately followed by delicious malts. The carbonation is very low which allows more flavors to present themselves. Dry finish is perfect, no bitterness at all. An impeccable brew with an improved twist from the cask. MMM",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,KingG,4.35,"Received from jimbowood in a trade, thanks again.  Served chilled and poured into my Padres pint glass.  Appearance is good. Hazy light-bronze colored brew with a very nice clumpy head that leaves a lot of lacing as it dies down.  Smell is good. Grapefruit and bittering hops and sweet malts. Very citrusy smell. I like.  Taste is very good. Pink grapefruit, tangarine with a nice fat, oily, hoppy bitterness. Nothing too bitter though; extremely balanced and crafted almost perfectly. Awesome blend of bitterness and sweetness. Reminds me of another favorite; Alesmith IPA.  Mouthfeel is very good. Thick and chewy (for the style) on the palet with fantastic texture. Love bottle conditioned beers.  Drinkability is very good. I can kill a sixer of this stuff quite easily me thinks.  Overall: An awesome IPA that deserves all the hype.

Nice breadyness, with a hint of brown, sugar, booze & loads of citrussy & piney/resiny hops, yummy!!  MF: Rich, chewy medium-bodied with perfrect balance  Super AIPA, too drinkable, this is one that lives up to the hype IMO.

Beautifully balanced combination of sweet malt with an understated hop bitterness in the flavor. Silky smooth mouthfeel. A wonderful example of a session IPA with very high marks for drinkability. My first Bell's beer, but it certainly won't be my last. On tap at Howard's Pub 11/27/09 Simply outstanding. The most citrus in an IPA I've ever encountered.

Pours a deep golden color, thick cap of foam that has very good retention and thin lacey streams. Lots of hop aromas, this is an IPA (sorry Alexander Keith). Fresh grapefruit and pine and spiciness. A solid tasting beer, sweet pale malt under a great hop punch. It tastes perfectly balanced, full bodied, hoppy, has everything going for it. The mouthfeel is smooth with a good amount of carbonation to keep it slightly dry and refreshing. Great flavor, not so much hops that you can't taste anything else. Very nice example of the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,rborthwick,4.77,"This beer is amazing. Pours a burnt orange yellow color with half an inch of head, which dissipates quickly. The smell is hoppy with a touch of floral, spice and orange. Very gentle nose. Starts a little sweeter than your standard IPA which I like. It transitions slowly to a medium hop bitterness in the end. Very nice balance and more drinkable than most other IPAs. In fact, I think this IPA has better drinkability than Dogfishhead 60min. That says a lot being that Dogfish IPA is one of my absolute favorite beers period.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,enfield249,4,"A - Light golden orange color. One finger of head when poured that dissipates quickly.  S - Spicy hop aroma, slight citrus behind that.  T - Almost the same as the smell. Some IPAs go for the big citrus hop flavor, but this one really seems to lean on the spicier side of hops, and it works out really well. There is some citrus in there, more orange the grapefruit, but it's on the smaller side.  M - Medium thickness, slight tingle from the CO2. It only leaves you with a little of the hop bitterness, and for an IPA I'll call it ""clean"" in that sense.  D - What a great beer all around. I've had IPA's at twice the price that were not this good. A great IPA to knock a few back in. Makes me think of warm weather. Well done Bells.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,surlyseth,4.5,"Wow! Poured hazy orange-yellow with a smooth ivory head. As floral as it is tropical. Taste is distinctive and delicious. Unmistakably unique to Bell's. Really nice and hoppy but balanced by sweet malts. Feels like an IPA, through and through. Medium to full with low carbonation. Drinkability is top-notch and potentially dangerous. That distinctive taste really doesn't get old. It gets better and better. Why try any other IPAs when this one is likely to be better?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,barefootbrewer,4.24,"This beer poured a cloudy yellow/orange color with a huge head. Wow! The aroma is robust  first of hops then citrus and malt noticeable.

287,1093,maltysfalcon,4.65,"Pours a medium amber color with average size head. This beer has a great depth of flavor, because the hops are backed up by enough malt to balance it out.

The nose had a strong pine scent with apricots and sweetgrass. The carbonation was high and the beer tasted fresh. The first sip is a onslaught of prickly hops and fresh apricots then a soft caramel malt slides in to rescue your palate. The finish is dry with a hint of peacans and fig.

287,1093,younger35,4.48,"Big thanks to tdp975 for this bad boy! Ive been wanting to try this beer for quite a while. Poured the 12oz bottle into a nonic pint glass. Drank on 7/28/2007.  Appearance- Pours an effervescent honey orange with a big creamy off-white head. The fluffy goodness stays almost the entire beer leaving thick lacing down the glass. A very very attractive beer. Smell- Very Citrusy. Lots of earthy grapefruit and lemongrass really shine here. The fruit almost seems to burst out of my glass. Taste- Much like the nose, there is a big citrus kick of hops. A nice grapefruit bitterness that leaves an almost floral sensation on the palette. There is a hint of malty sweetness that helps balance the beer but still allows the big hop punch to come through. Slight alcohol warming from the 7% but like everything else in this beer, fits nicely. Mouthfeel- Lots of fine carbonation that gently tickles the tongue. Medium to heavy body that adds a nice slick creamyness to the feel. Drinkability- Excellent! This is an absolutely delicious brew that I wish I had access to. As a session beer, the ABV and slight heaviness to it may hinder it slightly but thats the only negative. This is one of the tastiest IPA Ive had in a long time and would highly recommend it. Thanks again tdp975!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jasrbrd,4.65,"As a beer lover I wish I had the writing ability to creatively rate and review a beer like a lot of critics do (just not that fluent of a writer) This beer is deserving of that praise.  This was one of those beers you'd never seen in the Tampa, Florida market without trying to look for it, except in speciality stores. After trying it, what a great beer! I am colored blind, so that hurts me when I rate appearance! My sister and I were playing a game of pool (the exceptional beer tasting environment) when we tried this. It's got a nice ""kick"" from the 7% ABV, but not where it overpowers the flavor. Great ""drinkablility"", that's to say it tastes great. No bad after taste and it leaves you wanting to order another one, and probably another ater that. This is one beer you really have to try.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MiScusi,4.47,"A special thanks to markgugs for throwing this in as an extra.  Now I know why everyone raves about this beer. The previous time I tried it the bottles must have been old because this one tasted so much fresher and hoppy than before. The hops taste to me is very similar to Stone IPA but with a bit of added citrus character. There is a mildly juicy feel to it, making it very tasty. This definitely has a hop explosion. I must have been very generous last time to even give it a 4.0 for taste.  Ratings upgraded to 4/4.5/4.5/4/4  ___ Many thanks to umustdrink for this beer.  Pours a rich golden color with a pretty nice white fluffy and bubbly head. The smell is actually quite hard to detect. You can get some hops, but not the pungent type of hop aroma I'm use to here in Southern California. The taste is nice for an IPA- sweet malts and citrus mix at the beginning and give way to a refreshing bitterness that you want from an IPA. This is a pretty easy drinker. I like IPA's hoppy so this doesn't fully meet my demands but it was a nice beer anyway. 4/3.5/4/4/4",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TheBierBand,4.23,"Poured into my pint glass from the brown bottle (there was a code....but I could not decipher it: ""7992""). I could not tell anything about the freshness of this beer.  The pour produced an immedeate 2"" loose head that settled down to about 1/2"" prior to consuming. The liquid is a hazy honey color... interesting....hazy.  The smell.... hoppy....a citric hoppiness with some pine sap mixed in.  The taste: NOW.... THAT's what I'm talking about! Great citrusy/hoppy flavor with a hint of a sour fruity complexity and a touch of an alcohol warmth (makes sense for 7% abv).  Mouthfeel: This is my American IPA of reference.... more robust and hoppy than, say, Harpoon IPA.... I like this beer. Carbonation on the light side.... good... VERY Robust!  Drinkability: Good beer for you hop heads (and you know who you are!). Not for the faint of heart.... but a great American IPA.

Head quickly fades with some sticky lacing on the glass.  Aroma: My favorite part of this beer. Aromas of fresh herbal hops some citrus, some pine. A balance of several hop varieties. Each playing off each other to give a depth of aroma that keeps you guessing.  Taste: This is an American IPA. Rich full malt with powerful hops. Grapefruit citrus. Cascades hops.By style guidelines its probably on the edge of double IPA with the amount of hop bitterness and flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation. Full bodied but not thick. Smooth and balanced although very bitter.  Drinkability: If I lived closer to MI or even in a state that sold this, I would drink this every day.

287,1093,nickfl,4.42,"A - Copper colored with a lot of pure white head. Good clarity, though one has to be careful not to disturb the sediment on the bottom of the bottle.  S - Citrusy, fresh hop aroma. A bit of spicy, meaty smell as well, maby a small degree of autolysis. Took me a long time to identify the last aroma note, it reminded me of Thai food... I finally decided that I can smell a little bit of basil (that is so unusual it is worth another .5 points).  T - Spicy malty and very hoppy. More spicy, phenolic character than citrus elements.  M - Pretty mouthcoating but the hopping rate makes it finish fairly dry and astringent.  D - Very good drinkable IPA. Fairly high bitterness, but I still wish I had another one of these. The only flaw is the hazey, chunky appearance, but I can live with that. Easily one of the best IPAs I have had in a bottle.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Taste is an almost perfect equilibrium, earning a 5.0 for drinkability. Hops run to delicate lemon like sugar-coated christmas gelatin candies, heady phantom floral notes, touches of pine and grapefruit. A light, moussey candy sweetness and mouthfeel offsets the hops with a bit of herbal, earthy flavor.  Not the boldest IPA, nor the most bitter, nor the hoppiest. But it is superbly balanced within the style.... perhaps the best balance of any American IPA I've sampled.

Hazy orange-amber color illuminates, thick three finger head, with moderate lacing.  Pungent floral-citrus aroma - orange, grapefuit with some lemon with a gritty malt finish.  The key word with this AIPA is balance. With it comes the firm hop kick, the resin and malt follow through, and rounded out with a mild bitterness. A hop head's paradise with the dry and puckery feel.  A great AIPA that you could drink for hours. The biggest problem I am having is pacing myself since this beer tastes so good. The 7% keeps you on your toes. It also goes well with my Mexican style food and wonderful summer weather.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Taste is nice bready slightly nutty body with some serious citrus notes. Grapefruit, orange with slightly sweet malty base. Hops are well balanced and coat the palate for a great lingering aftertaste. This is my favorite IPA. The carbonation, hop balance, slight sweetness are really in perfect harmony.

287,1093,BretSikkink,4.65,"Golden amber color, mostly clear (draft versions show brilliant clarity). Sticky foam puts up a valiant effort to stay afloat and subsequently leaves a thick blanket of stratified lacing.  Aroma is powerful, attractive, and balanced. The hops are prominent, citric (grapefruit), light in tone but strong of volume. Touch of sweet malt; a little stronger in that department this could be a five for smell. But the hops are so nice...  Before waxing poetic about the hops, the malt profile is light and slightly sweet, with a nod toward a buttery diacetyl (this flavor becomes a little more pronounced with the draft versions I've had, probably as the keg was winding down). The malt is pale, but sugary enough to counteract the intense hopping, which is grapefruit and flowers all the way. Hop oils are very present but I find them pleasing, a tongue-caressing smack of bitterness. I think this is the best tasting IPA I've ever had.  Feeling strange about near perfect scores on everything, I was unduly harsh on the mouthfeel for being just a hair thin. I have encountered examples of the style that have a little more presence, to the point of being almost chewy. Which I love. But the Two Hearted more than makes up for that by being so incredibly drinkable, absolutely a joy to partake of, and sessionably smooth - perfect carbonation keeps everything in check and whisks the oils away leaving a floral aftertaste. Finish is crisp and clean, and not at all bitter or unpleasant afterwards. The hops are present without overpowering anything about the brew. Watch out for the 7%, cause I could drink a case of this stuff.  I've enjoyed this ale on tap many the time, absolutely superlative. So smooth and full of flavor...I've made friends at the bar by picking out pint glasses of Two Hearted by appearance and starting a conversation by talking about the superior quality and eminent drinkability of this beer. The bottled version is by no means a letdown, spot-on style perfection, and a personal favorite IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,tempest,4.01,"Batch #7877, bottled March 27, 2007.  Ok, this might be the best looking IPA I've ever had, but not the best. The appearance has a short creamy head with thick lacing. The aroma is just a general citrus punch, a little weak. The flavor picks things up a bit, but it's not as bitter as I expected. It's a smooth bitter that puts it on par with a hearty pale ale. Still, the taste is of wonderfully fruity hop juice. Not overly powerful, but nice. I'd like a little more kick, but it's still a great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,marksto,4.32,"Picked up a 6 at Publix this evening. Bell's is new to FL, and since it just arrived about 3 weeks ago I'm sure this is a fresh sample.  Pours golden amber with hint of orange. Medium head retention, very clear. Aroma offers an interesting interplay of biscuity malt sweetness and citrusy hops. This interplay carries well into the flavor - malt with a biscuity tone, fruit, and citrus. Noticible hop flavor, not just aroma and bitterness - undoubtedly dry hopped, very nice.  Overall, an excellent example of an American IPA from a well respected American craft brewery. This beer and Bell's in general are welcome additions to the FL beer scene.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,tpd975,4.4,"Bell's has recently come to Florida and Exhibit A is why I am glad they have done so.  A: Beautiful straw yellow/orange in color with a head that settles down nicely to one finger. This one is very effervescent with bubbles chasing each other to the top and it has nice lacing for an IPA.  S: The wonderful aroma of hops. Earthy with a beautiful smell of citrus and pine.  T: I really like this one. I have probably drank over a case of it in the past month or so and I have finally gotten around to reviewing it. This one has the taste of wonderful pink grapefruit. The taste is long lasting and finishes with a sting on the tongue from the bitterness of the hops. Nice!  M: Very effervescent, and refreshing  D: This is one of the most sessionable around. I session with Alpha king until I run out and then switch over to Two Hearted for the hot Florida summers.  Overall: This is one of my favorite everyday beers. It refreshing and thirst quenching on a hot day. One of these after mowing the lawn puts me right where I want to be actually lets me honest 2 or 3 puts me right where I want to be. Thanks Bell's for coming to Florida.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,timtim,4.63,"this is a super popular one... i've had it in the bottle as well, but on tap, it was really something else... golden orange (if there is such a thing) with a nice little head and just the right ammount of carbonation... the nose is floral... so nice i almost enjoy sniffing this beer as much as i do schwilling it... i could go on and on... pleasant piney, floral, unoffensive, grown up taste... goes down like it was meant to... bliss for the mouth, throat, belly and body...  12/14/07 - update... just had to come back and add a bit to one of my first reviews... since the time of my first review, i've had two hearted on cask, on tap, in the bottle, and last night - in the new 5L mini keg. sheer heaven. hazy amberish with lighter feet that seemed to give the beer a glowing appearance. the girl i drank it with commented right away about how she was astounded by the appearance. she's not a beer geek, but appreciates good schwill. said it looked like an airbrushed picture of the perfect beer in a magazine. georgeous off white head that had supernatural retention and lace. this was so good last night out of the mini keg, i want to give it 5's across the board... malt character was caramelly and sweet. a perfect vessel to carry the fruity, floral hops. almost full bodied, silky, smooth mouthfeel. it left me wanting more and more and paired perfectly with the gruyere mac and cheese that we made. hands down, one of the best beers i've ever had. thanks larry bell. if any of you hop lovin' ba's haven't gotten a chance to try this beer out of the 5l can, run to the store now and pick one or two or three up. don't sleep!!! highly highly recommended!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,canucklehead,3.8,Thanks Rudge for this one. This beer was dark gold with a real pleasant hop nose to start. The mouthfeel was very smooth with the hops coming into play but an almost English flavour came to mind in the rounded complexity of the finish. This is a very individual IPA that is very drinkable but not a over the top west coast hop monster.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jwc215,4.37,"Pours hazed amber/yellow with a one-finger, creamy white head that slowly descends to a lasting thin cover. Broken rings of lacing stick to glass.  The smell is floral, piney, citric/tropical fruity. Robust aroma.  The taste is floral, piney, citric bitterness upfront. Malty sweetness in the back holds the hops together. As it warms, it becomes more resiny. Slight touch of peppery alcohol in the long finish.  Chewy, creamy, rich body. Hoppiness lingers.  A hop-head delight here! Wish it were available in my area.

287,1093,robocrouch,4.24,A: Poured from the bottle into a pint glass with a very good looking orange/golden color. Very nice looking brew.  S: Outrageously tasty smell. Smells of fresh hops just picked from the vine. Couldn't wait to try this beer;  T: Good lord. This is an IPA for hop heads. Very balanced with a great hop presence. The taste is so flavorful and smooth and the alcohol is hidden better then Waldo. One of the best IPAs I have had.  D: Overall an outstanding beer and one of the best IPAs I have had.

287,1093,OWSLEY069,4.42,"Poured a nice orange-ish color with a white head that disapates nicely. It just smells of grapefruity hops, sweet and tangy. It has a nice smooth bite, and a sweet malt that is phenominal. The alcohol is hidden quite well in this one, as well as a little sticky, but that what makes a good beer, right?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BattleRoadBrewer,3.77,"Packaged in a 12 oz amber crown cap bottle Served at fridge temp about 35F Big, pungent hop aroma at the bottle neck Pours with a thick body, producing a full off white head. Appearance: Amber-orange, very slightly hazy, leaves an excellent lace. Taste: Assertive citrusy bitterness dominates. Not as malty as expected. Drinkability: Big hop load makes a good example of an American style IPA. Hop flavor apparent and balanced with the hop aroma, containing earthy and citrus components. Could use a little more malt flavor to enrichen it. Highly recommended for hop heads.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,CWiggins,4.42,"I picked this up at Earth Fare Raleigh (Brier Creek) for $8.99 (six-pack). I keep hearing good thing's about Bell's brews, and I've tried their stout, porter, and Oberon. These have all been solid beers, so I thought their IPA would be worth trying. That is an understatement!  This beer pours a dark straw yellow in my pint glass. A one-finger head of ecru foam persisted for some time before dissolving into a thin lacing that continued to cover the surface. The aroma is mainly of hops and citrus, with some pine and floral notes. It's a fresh-smelling beer, to say the least.  The flavor is bright citrus with a big, but smooth, hoppy finish. Very little detection of malts. Smooth, refreshing, and really hits the spot. I found the carbonation to be a bit much, but that's hardly an objective criticism. This is a well-made brew that stands out in the dense forest of American craft IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ChrisA,4.67,Thanks to the Mellow Mushroom in Indy for staying late and pouring me an extra pint of Two Hearted. I could still taste it in the morning. I have heard fabled stories of this fine ale and may now report back that they are legitimate. One of the best IPA's I have ever had. It made the Alpha King that I tried after it pale in comparison. Wish I could get this out in Colorado. This is a definite hophead's favorite!!!,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,GRPunk,4.92,"Bottle from batch number 7895 poured into a tulip glass  A- This beer poured a golden orange with a medium (1"") off-white head. I would say it had medium carbonation and a decent amount of lacing that stuck around.  S- The nose came through with hoppy, grassy, pine tones. I felt that I picked up some citrus too. I seemed quite complex in scent.  T- Traditional grapefruit taste of a hoppy American IPA. The hop flavor is readily apparent, but stays in balance. Anybody can add tons of hops to a homebrew and end up with a very bitter taste. Two Hearted seems to push the hop flavor to the edge without going over.  M- Medium carbonation, with a somewhat thicker mouthfeel than expected. However, it stays quite smooth.  D- I can't say I'm really new to Bell's in general or even Two Hearted specifically. This will continue to be a ""go-to"" beer for me, especially in the warmer months. As I don't consider myself a true ""hop head"", this is the hoppiest (yet drinkable) I've enjoyed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,markaberrant,4.2,"A - Clear light orange, small off-white head. Ok lacing.  S - clean hop nose  T - Very smooth hops from start to finish, including the bitterness. Malt is barely noticable, but it works.  M - You get a bit of a carbonation zing at the start of each sip. More crisp and refreshing than other IPAs I've had recently.  D - I've been drinking this pretty fast, and I haven't picked up on any alcohol tones.  An excellent, hop-forward IPA. From what I know of this beer, it is a very basic recipe, but is executed flawlessly.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jp62099,4.59,"This beer really impressed me. I am not a hop-head and it's a style that up to recently I did'nt spend much time on, but I am exploring more now. I enter each one with caution. Pour is cloudy rosy orange, rocky head. Smell is great, floral and fruity, hops right. Taste and mouthfeel is smooth, light, nice hop presence with just the right amount of bitterness, fruity but not overly so. Overall this beer does'nt make my mouth pucker, and I would love to have had lots more, but only bought a single, will be looking forward to it coming to my state, I hope.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,number1bum,4.7,"Thanks to BeerTruth for this one.  Pours a beautiful honeysuckle amber with nice clarity and a pillowy finger and a half of off-white head. Lots of bubbles and the head has good retention, leaving a film across the top and some stick on the sides.  Smell is very fragrant with flowery aromas as well as grapefruit and some honey-like sweetness. The smell is really turning me on to this beer.  Taste starts off with a citrusy sweet splash of hops, grapefruit and honey, followed by more floral and citrusy hops. There is a little bit of bitterness toward the end but this is superbly balanced and has very little lingering bitterness for an IPA. Mouthfeel is nearly full-bodied and the carbonation is just right. It's very smooth and creamy on the tongue.  I can see why this is consistently rated so highly. Awesome IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BitterLover,4.54,"This afternoon, my two sons and I dropped into Tyler's Taprooom in Durham, NC to have a pint before a Bulls baseball game (it doesn't get much better than this). My sons ordered their pints (root beers), and I ordered a Rogue Imperial IPA. The bartender pulled the tap, but it just spat some foam. She suggested that I try a Bell's Two Hearted Ale instead. I'd never had one, so I agreed. To be honest, I was expecting to be a little disappointed (it's hard to compete against a Rogue I2PA). Man, was I wrong!  Appearance: Poured a nice polished copper color, with a one finger, off-white colored head. The head diminished quickly, but didn't disappear altogether. It left some nice lacing at the top of the pint glass. Slight carbonation.  Smell: This was one of the most fragrant beers that I've ever experienced. It smelled like walking through a field of wild flowers, with citrus fruits and orange peel thrown in. Absolutely wonderful - this is how an IPA should smell.  Taste: No disappointment here either! Fresh grapefruit up front followed by an intense hoppy bitterness. The hoppy finish just went on and on. The only reason I didn't give it a five was because it lacked just a little malty sweetness to balance the bitterness. Awesome!  Mouthfeel: The slight carbonation made it very smooth.  Drinkability: Yes. May I have another please? Unfortunately, I only had time to have one, but I'll be back. Now I just have to find this in bottles. Fantastic stuff, excellent IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,shertz,4.3,"Poured from 12oz bottle into Pint glass.  A- Wow, real nice head on this guy(or shall I say fish?). Golden in color, lots of bubble in this one.  S- Nice fruity smell, like apples, plums, and oranges. Nice floral hops smell also.  T- Floral tastes come out in beginning with lots of hops. I sense a nice orange taste with a dry finish. Delicious.  M- Pretty thick for a IPA with some carbonation. Nice dry finish.  D- I could drink a sixer of these easily with the low ABV and awesome taste. This is one of the best IPA's I've had and quite frankly need many more.  Cheers, Scott",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,k3n,4.3,"12oz bottle courtesy of Tangfoot. Thanks! I've been looking forward to this one...  A: Hazy amber, poured a gigantic rocky, off-white head that receded to a film of bubbles, and patchy lacing. A fairly steady stream of tiny bubbles streams from the bottom of my pint glass.  S: Clean, hoppy.  T: Really well-balanced! It seems like the flavors alternate from malt to hop and back again, with neither flavor trying to out-do the other. The finish is pleasant with a drying bitterness.  M: Smooth and creamy, with a light prickle from the carbonation.  D: Excellent. Two Hearted has lived up to my expectations. Too bad I don't live in MI.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MCDuhamel,4.74,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into an American pub glass, at fridge temperature.  A: Poured a rather hazy copper into the glass, even though I was careful not to disturb the yeast layer at the bottom of the bottle. Some chill haze, I suspect, is evident. The head was a nice dense foam, just a little off-white, that stayed with the beer. Some lacing.  S: Has a nice floral aroma, almost like lavender, rather than the grapefruit nose often present in American IPAs. Some spiciness, perhaps a little pine, as well, and some malt notes. Very nicely hop forward yet still balanced.  T: Noticeable hop flavor is the first impression, followed by nicely balanced malt sweetness. A subtle spiciness is present throughout. The malt yields to a lingering, dry and bitter finish, that manages not to overwhelm. This is an exceptional American IPA; probably the best I've had. The hops are well featured, but the beer maintains balance and does not take on any of the astringent character so common to the style.  M: Light to medium bodied, with pleasant carbonation.  D: This is a dangerously easy beer to drink. Despite its fairly high alcohol content (this site says 6% but the bottle says 7%) and the aggressive use of hops, the beer's perfect balance makes it a real joy to drink.  Overall: Perhaps my favorite thing about this beer, aside from its wonderful taste, is that it is bottle conditioned. Surprisingly few American craft brews are. This living beer is an outstanding examplar of the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Sephiroth,4.97,"Packaged on 4/9/07. I have a firkin pour in front of me, let's begin. Obviously, no head, rather a couple of layers of bubbles form on top of my glass. We tapped this thing at 4PM, it is now 3AM. Smells like dank, buttery hops. The usual Two-Hearted profile, more fruity esters, but slightly muted otherwise. No lacing, and slightly cloudy.  The first time I tasted this beer from a firkin, I preferred bottle or tap. Now, I am in love with the different flavors that the cask brings to the table. Buttery smooth hops, slight grassiness. I think what I love about this beer from a firkin is the smooth yeastiness in addition to the smooth hops. Of course, mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated, but slick and very smooth. Drinkability, oh jhee, let me think, ..it's perfect!  I must add that when drinking this beer from the firkin, I prefer it with a month at least of cask age before drinking. I have drank this less than a two weeks after it was casked, and about a month after it was casked. This has definitely been my most favorable experience with Two-Hearted from the firkin.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,kingjames1,4.44,"Pours a hazy orange-yellow - not as dark as expected for a rich IPA. But the head is thick and frothy - quality! And it sticks around...  Sticky indeed...but let's not get ahead of ourselves.  Smell is pure apricot, with the added, fresh aromas of a floral boquet. Powerful olfactory attack. Awesome.  Taste is intense apricot, tart finish with a thick sugary sweetness (a good measure of malts) - almost like a liquid candy. I detect grass, flowers, pine resin and lemon. Great IPA!  Mouthfeel is sticky, but the sharp finish cleans it up. Nice.  Very drinkable...but as I said, it is thick for an IPA. The thick sweetness (though nicely balanced by the tartness) makes one enough for me...for now. Yummy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Pours a hazy orange, golden color with 1/2"" sticky off-white head that holds awhile. Man this is one of, if not the most, aromatic beer I've had yet. It smells like I'm walking in a rose garden in full bloom. Tons of hop flavor but not palate ruining. Lot's of tropical flavors with mango being the most prominate. Medium mouthfeel with excellent drinkability. Simply one of my favorite beers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,kenito799,4.94,"12 oz bottle poured into a chalice.  Golden amber with some cloudiness from the bottom of the bottle. Sticky lacing.  Intensely aromatic and deliciously complex: pink grapefruit, tangerine, pine, roses...fruity and floral and everything lovable about fresh aromatic hops. The flavor delivers on the high expectations raised by the intoxicating aroma...fruity sweetness up front and then deliciously tangy and complex floral (roses, violets) and then pine in the finish, bitterness evenly balanced with malt. A highly aromatic expression of the IPA form and I think it may be my favorite.  As I drink this sixpack over a week or two I fall in love with this beer more and more. Utterly blissful beer experience. This beer just sings on the palate--smooth creaminess, fantastic aromatics and bitterness, balanced touch of sweetness in the malt--perfect harmony, you can't stop sipping, before you know it the glass is empty...and you are SAD--genuinely dejected that the pleasure pouring from this bottle will live on only in your vivid, tantalizing memories.

287,1093,JayQue,4.25,"A great IPA, in the same class as Celebration Ale. Pours a hazy straw gold color with a nice size white head that hangs in there. Sheets of lacing on the glass. Good strong IPA smell, hops and citrus.  Fantastic taste!!! Hops bitterness and pine and citrus. Rich and varied taste, I could sip this one all day. Mouthfeel is crisp and rich. Certainly would not enjoy a lesser tasting beer after one of these. Drinkability is good, this would be a three-and-out session beer, but it would be a good session. I can't get Bells products here (This one came from D's 6 packs and dawgs near Pittsburg). If I could buy them here or if I could find this beer on tap in Tidewater VA...life would be good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,wedge,4.5,"Orange, lightly hazed. A whipped-looking white head rises a good three fingers high and leaves behind patchy lacing. Bright sugary citrus aroma, like a handful of centennial hops. The flavor is certainly not a letdown if you're looking for hops. But its not an in-your-face tongue massacre, its loads of fresh, oily hop flower power. Like candied grapefruit, but never heavy and cloying, the filling mouthfeel is surprisingly easy to handle . Naturally bitter, though not overly so. This is an IPA all about that sticky hop cone FLAVOR, not just IBUs. Really delicious stuff...I've found its already become one of my favorites.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,NCSUdo,4.44,"Served from a 12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Poured with a huge creamy had. Golden appearence with a little haziness. Head leaves some lacing and sticks around on top of the beer.  S: Big floral citrusy nose, lemons is the first fruit that hit me with some grapefruit later on. A great hop smell. Some hints of pine and grass. Great nose. Strong but not overpowering.  T: Fruity/citrusy, lemons up front, hints of grapefruit. Finishes with a mild bitterness. Some piney flavor. Very well balanced, 7% is nowhere to be found in the tastes. Ultimately finishes with a certain dryness which contributes to drinkability.  M/D: Nice mouthfeel, slightly heavy on the carbonation. Light to a slightly medium body. Above average drinkability considering the 7% mark.  This beer would be a nice sipper on a late summer afternoon. Dry quality pushes it towards a session beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,prototypic,4.15,"Appearance: It's transparent and golden in color. Foamy one and a half finger head. Retention was decent and a nice coat of lace remained after the head subsided.  Smell: Very citrusy. It smells of grapefruit, mango, and lemon (perhaps a little pineapple). Great hoppy aroma. A light scent of caramel malt also comes through.  Taste: Citrusy sweet. Very good grapefruit taste. A bit of lemon and orange flavors are also there. But, grapefruit is the main feature. Hops are fantastic and provide just the right amount of bitterness. It's somewhat balanced by the malts, but leans in the hoppy direction.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Very smooth and drinkable. Carbonation and abv are perfect. I could easily session this beer. Overall, this is an excellent IPA. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,pootz,4.2,"Bottle dated 4 weeks old.  Poured a delicious looking hazed orange-gold ale in the glass with a puffy 3 finger white cap that lasts and laces the glass well.  Aromas are delightful: sweet malts under grape fruit tones and floral aromas...a light earthy mustiness...very much like Anchor Liberty but more pronounced.  Flavor and Mouth -Feel Profile:  The delivery: ....up front thick caramelized malts to chew on which are almost instantly balanced off with a ceadr-citrus bittering. Silken mouth feel.  Mid palate: ....you get some complexity of tastes as the hop alphas and yeast by-products produce some interesting succulent fruits-pine-citrus peel tones that blend with the sweet rich breadiness of the malts, much like a tart-floral marmalade on toast...perfect balance in this ""big"" rich full bodied ale.  The finish: ...malt-hop balance slowly dissipates as the long finish becomes slowly more bitter an floral with a final light citrus peel after taste and a light warming from the 7%ABV.  A very well put together American styled IPA...not exactly in the Pacific NW style but it bears many characteristcs. tThe nose and flavor are infused with a wonderful hop mixture that indicates both hopback infusion and dry hopping. Smooth, Big flavor, well balanced, drinkable and satifying. This ale has all you ask for in a daily beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,SaCkErZ9,4.92,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Golden in color with a very nice, tight, white head. Very rocky and thick. Tons of lacing. Is this a Belgian? Would be all five except for the haziness involved. Could be chill haze but who knows? Teensy tiny bubbles fight there way to the top to make their presence known in the dense white head.  Aroma is beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Full of citrus delights like lemons, tons of grapefruit, orange, even some light berries, grass. You name it, its there. Perfect.  While there is a ton of hop flavor, there is hardly any bitterness. That is beautiful balance. Very citrusy and orangey.  This is a damn near perfect beer. I have had this on draft at some less than reputable establishments and it never tasted half as good as this. This is great. Maybe a touch too much carbonation but this still seems to be a benchmark for me.

287,1093,daliandragon,4.1,"Enjoyed this one on tap at Tyler's Taproom in Durham on Saturday while waiting for the rain to clear up so we could watch the Bulls game across the street. Review conducted from notes. I only ordered it after I was informed that they were out of Hopslam but it turned out to be a good call.  This IPA featured a bright rust color with a solid, entrenched one finger display of off-white head. The nose featured tangy piney hops and a late cut of lemon zest and other citrus, maybe even orange. Attractive rings of lace appear after the first sip.  Taste is very refreshing despite the bitterness with fruit and spice notes. A late blast of pine reminds you that this is still an IPA. Mouthfeel is broad and consistent with a creamy texture and a longlasting aftetastte that kept bitter in your mouth almost ad infinitum.  This is very enjoyable and goes down like water. Quite the sessionable IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Smell is very hoppy, what else would you expect it is an ipa, and a damn fine one at that. Taste is very good a bit bitter but not as bitter as others a little bit more carbonation than others as well, making this beer highly drinkable and such a good find having it on draft.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Juicy and Fruity M - Hops hit the back of the throat for a good touch, very well carbonated.

Two Hearted has a burnt straw color to it with a nice two finger bright white head that slowly dies down throughout tasting. Lacing is very sticky, holds on the the glass with all it's got. Unique fruit aroma, mostly grapefruit but it also has a hint of sweet apple underneath as well. Taste is very similar to smell, but that isn't a bad thing. Very enjoyable to the taste buds. Some floral notes seem to arise as well on the tounge. I would say this is a pretty light bodied IPA with a fair amount of carbonation, quite balanced if I do say so myself.

287,1093,ncvbc,4.72,"I've had it on-tap and I've had it from the bottle. This just seems to be near perfect in every aspect. Pour is light golden with a fluffy off white head. Pretty good carbonation and lacing. Smell is of fresh grapefruit hops with an excellent floral aroma. Definitely one of the best smelling IPA's to me. The hops seem more inviting rather than aggressive although they are there throughout. Taste is exceptional. Grapefruit citrus hops with a sweet floral aroma. Great hop bite that is lightly malted as well but the hops surely dominate. Mouthfeel is tingly from the hops, yet smooth as they come. Nice crisp finish that stays on the tongue forever it seems. Drinkability is through the roof as well. As I said above the hops are there and definitely dominate but they are balanced in such a way that makes this the most refreshing and drinkable IPA out there. This is one of my favorite styles and Two Hearted seems to set the bar pretty high. It doesn't look much better than your average, though you can't judge a book by its cover. Highly recommended. Thanks to Scoobydank and Nathan15 for the bottles.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Luchman,3.55,"A: Pours out very thin with a very light and clear amber/orange color with just a hint of yellow at the bottom of the glass. Atop sits a huge, fluffy/foamy, white head.  S: A nice mixture of hop smells. Grapefruit rinds, orange, pine, and some floral notes all mix together. Sweet malts are there that blend actually pretty well with the hops. Not too bad!  T: Pine and floral hops lead the taste with the grapefruit rinds taking the back. Those sweet malts are definitely there and not too hard find in end. Half way through the beer and it becomes a little on the sweet side to me. Hops are oily and juicy and the malt presence is there to add to the sweetness. Ends bitter and dry.  M: A little on the light/medium body side with a medium/low carbonation.  D: I dont know, call me a hater but I was not too fond of this beer. Overall I did not think the hop/malt mix was all to great and the sweet and bitter taste got a little annoying for me towards the end. Its not hard to finish but I dont think Ill be revisiting this again..",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mjgardner,4.54,"Bottle from batch 7895  Appearance - Pours a hazy copper color with a nice white head that disspates a bit with time.  Aroma - A big grapefruit citrus aroma. I do pick up some pineapple and pine as well. Detected a bit of a malt backbone as well.  Taste - Again, a big burst of grapefruit hops right away. This one amazingly good tasting beer. It is very well balanced with a biscuity, malt backbone.  Mouth - Medium body with medium to high carbonation.  Drinkability - This is an extremely drinkable beer. You do have to be a bit careful at 7%, cause it could sneak up on you if you turn it into your session beer.  What a fantastic IPA. There is a reason it has a 91 rating here. Get if you can; if you can't, trade for it!!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ChazMania,3.8,Bottled from batch 7770. Pours with a small head that faded quickly and aroma of pine and hop. Flavor is nice with the good crisp clean and refreshing flavor all the way down.

287,1093,kkipple,3.74,"Served on-tap at the Mellow Mushroom in Charlotte.  There's no two ways around it, Bell's Two Hearted is a beautiful lookin' beer. A sea-foam white head hugs the stop of a clear bubbly gold beer. Lace everywhere, and leaves big rings as I down the pint. Head has great retention, too. No complaints.  This is a fruity smelling IPA, with peaches, bubblegum, and fresh citrus hops shining through. Sweet light malt and mandarin oranges, which is interesting... a bit more hop presence in the smell would bring this close to perfection.  A few sips produce tons of fruit notes and sweet malt balanced with a crisp, fresh piney hop flavor. The mouthfeel is super creamy; you could drink this IPA quickly in a pinch. Aftertaste is bitter grapefruit seeds with a hint of earth. This is a good tasting beer, more drinkable than Stone IPA, but not quite as flavorful. Perhaps a bit watered down. Finishes dry.  Two-Hearted is a fine beer, not the best IPA I've had but certainly in the top 10. More aggressive hopping would get this higher marks from me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BlindPig,4,"A- Really thick white head on a clear orange body. S- Really big pine and grapefruit hops, sweet malt background, and hints of lemon. T- Grapefruit juice and other fruit juice hops with hints of pine in there to help balance it out. Sweeter caramel malt body to help balance the hops. Nothing that is hugely bitter but leaves a nice medium bitterness on the mid -tongue. M- Medium body with medium carbonation.

287,1093,slyke,4.2,"Two Hearted Ale pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a finger of white head that fades to a cap after about 5 minutes. Nice lacing as the beer is drunk.  Smell is dominated by citrusy hop notes. Very inviting. The taste is citrusy as well, with a nice malt background.  Mouthfeel is good too. Just what I expects from an American IPA.  Drinkability is solid. The only hit it gets comes from the 6% abv. I wouldn't want to make plans for after sessioning this beer, but a couple would be great.

287,1093,Shaw,4.08,"Bell's is a new arrival in Florida. If I remember right, they have introduced four of their brews here. I haven't had their beers since my former co-worker Adam's girlfriend brought some down here years ago.  This is a lovely light amber in color with a very large off-white foamy head. It has a nice aroma of citrus-like hops.  The flavor is good and hoppy but not overwhelmingly so. It is bitter, but there is balance from the biscuity malts. There is quite the layer of hops in this beer. It's been seriously hopped.  The body is very nice and chewy. It's far from watery.  Overall this is a fine American IPA and well worth seeking out, especially for hop fans.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Toddv29424,4.82,"This beer pours a hazy golden color, with a wavy head that's characteristically smooth for a heavy-loaded IPA. Smell is perfect: many layers, but mostly floral hops of the cascade and fuggles variety, but also a certain sweetness that's hard to put your finger on. The taste is big and chewy, with the same hop character as in the smell. Terrifically balanced though, many times beers have a one-dimentional hop taste and this seems to totally buck that trend. As the glass empties the taste seems a little less spectacular but just as dense, a feat of a great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,trevorwideman,4.52,"12oz bottle given to me by rudge75. Thanks Dave! Poured into a pint glass.  Pours a murky straw colour, lighter than some IPA's, less coppery but tons of unfiltered goodness. 1 inch of head from a vigorous pour, medium-high carbonation. The head recedes to about 1/8th of an inch and sticks around, leaves a bit of sticky lace. Aroma is outstanding, Tropical fruit, pineapple, mandarin orange, grapefruit, pine, and a lovely floral sweetness as well. Malt shines through with a little caramel in the back and some fresh baking as well. Delicious!  Taste does not dissapoint in the least. Herbal hops dominate, aniseed, pine, citrus in smaller doses. The lovely part about all this is that this beer is extremely well-balanced. Lots of bready/biscuity malt that is almost cookie like at times, other typical baking flavours come through, a little vanilla, caramel, and even a bit of banana surprisingly. Grainy in the finish with lots of hop bitterness. Well-balanced which I appreciate so much in an IPA. Not as dry as a lot of IPA's I've had but I don't mind that, although the carbonation could be toned down a little. This is probably the most drinkable IPA I've had the pleasure of trying, the balance and the flavour is just outstanding, and I could session this all night long to be sure.

287,1093,SkinnyElvis,4.85,"Poured in a pint glass at cellar temperature. Nice head which clings to the glass. Amber in color. Hoppy smell which is mostly floral. The taste is a perfect match of pine & citrus hops with a great malt base. Mouthfeel is very smooth & this beer is one of the most drinkable IPA's out there. At $35-40 a case, this is a bargain. One of my favorite beers.  Cheers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,drseamus,4.35,"The body on this beer is amber with a one finger white head. The aroma has a ton of grapefruit in it. That grapefruit is present in the flavor as well along with a bunch of hop bitterness in the flavor but it is balanced with the malt. As it warms up, the sweetness become more up front and brings the balance more toward the center. This beer has a medium body and it fits the beer perfectly.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

It settles to a small head over the top leaving a heavy lace around the sides of the glass as it dissipates. The floral hop aroma is exceptional! This is one of the best smelling beers I've found. It makes you want to keep going back for another whiff. A full, chewy mouth feel. Very well balanced. Full bodied malt to go with the citrus, grapefruit bitterness of the hops. This beer is hard to beat. The only thing better would be more of the same. The name ""HopSlam"" comes to mind!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Lots of belgian lace was left on the glass.  The aroma is fantastic! A wonderful grapefruit and lemon scent. There are definitely Amarillo hops involved.  The taste is very hoppy, yet balanced. There is a biscuity malt sweetness with a very complex citrus fruit hop bitterness (including grapefruit and lemons).  The mouthfeel is medium, and the drinkability is great. I could drink these all day. The bitterness is not overpowering.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jsbrendle,4.39,"Served on tap into a standard shaker pint glass. Appearance isn't thrilling... rather unremarkable golden color with some white head that disappeared quickly & left no lace. Smell is good ... full of citrusy/piney hop notes and a bit of the malt sweetness. Flavor likewise shows some of the malt notes (cereal/biscuit) & plenty of the floral/spicy/citrusy hops. Finish is dry and very hoppy. Very much balanced toward the hop-head's taste preferences (very unbalanced toward hop aroma, flavor and bitterness). Mouthfeel is smooth, body pretty much ""medium"" weight. One of my favorites in the style (along with Stone IPA, DFH 60 Minute). A decent choice for a session ale if you are a hop-head & also a good choice to recommend to people who appreciate hoppy beers or are willing to at least try to push their envelope further.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,cameraman,3.77,"A golden/amber color with an off whitw colored head. The aroma very complex, with citrus, pine, and earthy scents. The taste starts with a strong malt flavor, and it dominates the palate till the very end, when that expected bitterness caomes in at the end. A thin watery feel, very surprising, folowed by the strong presence of carbonation at the back of the throat. An incredible aroma, is let down by a mediocre taste and less than appealing feel, was very disappointed, but I will probably give this beer another try.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,asabreed,4.38,"12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: A hazy golden yellow body with some copper in there for good measure. Lots of bubbles initially floating to the top, and rings of lacing are left above in massive clumps, with the head never really dissipating below the top of the brew--you're always seeing white.  Smell: A wonderful meld of grassy and citrus hops with a nice malt backbone of more fruity sweetness. I get some sour cherries in the mix too, along with some lemon zest, grapefruit rind, and earthy characteristics. Still, with the malt backbone and fruit elements, it helps the balance rather than everything being completely controlled by the hops (which would certainly still be fine with me).  Taste: One of the best attributes of the brew is the finish, which never seems to die, especially if you're constantly sipping. The hop oils and fruit from the malt meld harmoniously enough to keep smacking your lips, and there are tons of flavors from sour fruit to oily citrus, with everything always being in balance.  Mouthfeel: Throughout the entire process the mouthfeel remains creamy, which astounds me in some sense, as the body seems medium to full, though the carbonation levels are certainly spot on.  Drinkability: This is a brew where the year round hype is a valid one. Bells outdid themselves with HopSlam, but this stuff is beyond damn good for the sessionable brew. It has the flavor, the balance, the alcohol at 7% (via the Bells website as I write this), and the quality for one of the best IPAs available, especially, as I said, year round. It took me a long time to try this, and I suggest you don't make the same mistake I did.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Dark gold, big bubbles in the head, retained some, but not great lace. Smell was much better, citrus and hops, some nice tang in there to boot. Taste was the best aspect, one of the best IPA's out there. Similar to but not as sweet as 90 min, very dry citrus flavor, like a less sweet orange, but not as bitter as grapefruit. A medium does of earthy malts keep it from being over the top. Crisp, medium, lots of carbonation, very nice.

The aroma was fantastic...uber-foresty hops mixed with citrus, mango, bubble gum, and a hint of the sticky icky.  Taste spikes a balance of fruit and hops. Orange, plum, peach, mango, and apple cidar. The carbonation levels were great, and the mouthfeel was juicy & crisp: flat out amazing. A nice hoppy aftertaste lingered, but not so long that is frazzled the tastebuds. Drinkability is top notch; goes down smooth and has plenty of taste and complexity.

Huge pillowy three finger head that leaves a mess of sticky lace all over the glass. Active carbonation.  S: Big whack of citrus hops! Upon further sniffing I detected aromas of peach, apple, and alcohol.  T: See above with the addition of an excellent dry malt backbone. Incredible hoppiness! Finish starts dry and hoppy, turns dry and malty, then becomes tart and fruity.  M: Very hoppy and very dry. The excellent balance from the malt keep this from becoming too dry. Dry and oily at the same time.  D: It's been a few years since I've had one of these and I'm kicking myself for passing over this at the beer store for many other less worthy IPA's.

287,1093,jmalex,4.39,"I've had this on tap at a bar but thought to give it its real fair shot, I needed to sit down with one at home in a bottle.  APPEARANCE: A pale straw color with a hint of orange. A small head shrinks quickly to small patches.  SMELL: Incredibly citrusy and a tad bit sweet. Smells very much of resinous grapefruit.  TASTE: Much more complex than I remember it on tap. The hops are so incredibly grapefruity, but they morph a bit on the finish to something more floral and piny. It also has a bit of a sweetness to it initially, but the hops really shine the whole way through.  MOUTHFEEL: Crisp and a bit syrupy. Carbonation is just right.  DRINKABILITY: Two Hearted does not suffer from being over-the-top like some IPAs do. The hops are packed in, but the flavors are carefully selected to give the beer a really nice mesh of flavors rather than an amalgam of bitterness. A very drinkable IPA.  I'm glad I had another chance at this. It's a different experience when I'm away from the bar. I'm able to pick up many more flavors this way, and for the most part, they aided in my experience of this beer.

Oranges initially appear in the flavor, with bitterness appearing mid-palate and persisting to the end.  The mouthfeel is light, fluffy, and refreshing, with just the right amount of carbonation. The drinkability increases, as the late-palate bitterness diminishes a bit (or maybe I'm just getting used to it), giving way to some nondescript hop oil flavors. I believe I could put a few of these away.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Im not sure what it was. wasnt skunk or sulphur or any of the usual suspects...maybe im just crazy. Regardless this is what i percieved sooo...  T: The taste is relatively nice. That smell that was stated earlier that seemed like a taste, is the first senstation in tasting too. This time it almost seemed hoppy, maybe some trait im not used to.It was not as bad as a tasteand goes away immediatly leaving a somewhat watery ale flavor. This is not all bad as the brew is easy to ejoy. The flavor is good, just seems weak. This caused a slightly unbalanced feel to this beer.

Wonderful fruity American hop aroma with a sweet malt undertone. Taste is perfectly integrated, and the star here - mostly tangerine, some faint pine. Certainly a hop showcase, but not the monster some other reviewers portray (did my bottle mellow?). Malt is not the star, but isn't absent, either - no bread or dough, just a silky firm texture that screams out for another drink. A tad bit more body might be welcome.  A great IPA. Its own beast - not quite like the NorCal standard I'm used to (the puckery bitterness isn't here), but it's no English-style wallflower.

287,1093,adams82,4.79,"Pours a slightly burnt orange with a huge, billowy, white head. Hops dominate the nose, slightly citric and mostly floral with some sweetness in the background. The flavor is unmistakably hoppy, more tart and citric than the aroma indicated and the hops really shine throughout each sip and don't let up. While there are all sorts of hop flavors in this, it is certainly not one dimensional as the citric hop profile is rounded out by a nice floral flavor and and some slightly sweet, lightly toasted malt character. This is a medium bodied beer with great character! The mouthfeel is slightly fluffy and this brew is highly drinkable especially on a hot and lazy summer afternoon.  This is certainly a wonderful IPA, almost a quintessential example of the style. It's complex and the hop profile is inviting rather than overpowering.

Golden brew with a foamy white head, a heavy hoppy smell that although pleasant, is somewhat unidimensional, I could not really smell anything else. Light body, the taste has more balancing malts than one would expect from the smell. Dry, pleasant finish. A good hoppy brew, although not very complex.

Smell is very hoppy and fragrant. There's also some pine and citrus going on as well, however the hops dominates the nose.  Taste is surprisingly sweet at first, lots of citrus flavor, predominately oranges with malt sweetness and a touch of caramel. Hops take over as you finish the sip, but not overly bitter.

Appears a hazy, golden amber color with at least two fingers of dense, fluffy off-white head. Decent lacing is left on the glass with each sip. Smells of flowery hops very similar to fruity pebbles cereal (of which I'm a fan) and sweet malt. Taste is the same as the smell and very well balanced. Medium to full bodied with decent carbonation.

Like juicy fruit gum dropped into grapefruit juice.  Taste: Juicy hops. Nice malt character, but the hops dominate for sure. Just the way an IPA should taste.  Mouthfeel: Light-medium body, good carbonation.  Drinkability: Probably my favorite beer I tried during my Philadelphia trip.

Thats the smell and that's all it needs.  Taste is slightly sweet malt and then an avalanche of floral, citrusy hops. Grapefruit, lemon, sweet orange and slight pine and grassiness make this beer a hops opera.  Mouthfeel is great, resiny hops from beginning to end.  Drinkability is phenomenal, the taste is so good you could easily put away a sixer.  Overall, this might be my favorite beer of all time. It's not the most extreme, and thats why I like it. It takes the concept of a hoppy beer to the next level by having as much flavor as bitterness. Fantastic all around and highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Excellent balance of citrus and hops flavor. Just bitter enough, but not enough to pucker your mouth. Predominantly orange flavors with some grapefruit in the mix. Finish is dry and clean. Exceptional drinkability. My favorite 60 minute IPA so far.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Absumaster,4.35,"An orange, light amber beer with a small head.  Smell is hoppy, resinous and piney. There is also some fruitiness with peaches, honey and some hard candy.  Taste is bitter, but not extremely mouth puckering. The hops are citric and piney, with no grapefruit to be tasted. Malt is just faintly present and plays hardly any role. Yeast profile is fruity with some peach and hard candy. Balance is pretty much absent, but for hopheads this beer is great, it all revolves around the hops, rest is just supporting.  For me it is not clear why this is ranked so much higher than other IPAs, it is very good, but there is not earth shakeing difference. It is probably all these hopheads ;-)).

287,1093,rowew,3.95,"Presentation: 12 oz longneck. Short description of the style, indecipherable bottling code.  Appearance: Bright orange with a medium sized head, decent retention.  Smell: Immediate whiff of citrusy hops when I opened the bottle. Citrusy hops and just a bit of grassiness. Only the slightest hint of malt sweetness in the background.  Taste: This one is definitely not going for balance - its strongly hop dominated. Tart citrus flavors in the beginning with just a bit of resiny pine as well. Finishes dry and bitter.  Overall impression: Definitely for hop heads only - this is a quality IPA if you appreciate the over the top hop character.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The hops linger around for a good amount of time but not until unwelcome. Not sticky or high in alcohol in taste at all.  Overall a good contender for the 60 min IPA. Tastes a little fresher but I will have to drink a few more before I consider making a switch.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,RBorsato,4.67,"Hazy golden color with lots of tiny suspended particles, a nice off-white head, nice active carbonation, and good lace. Intense citrusy hop-pellet like aroma -- fresh !! Nice hoppy flavors; not really bitter; nice resiny character. Light-medium bodied with a light dry hoppy finish.  Awesome fresh hop monster ! Pricey but worth it. My favorite Bell's brew so far and the best IPA I've had in a long time.  Per BB website: OG 1.058 & 7% ABV.

287,1093,Matteox3,4.37,"Purchased at Shangy's in Emmaus, PA. Variety Case.  This orange colored brew was very aromatic. I keep hearing this called an IPA, and I guess that would suit it best, but I found this beer to be very very similar but more original than the typical American IPA. Most of the originality stems from the aroma, very very fruity. I loved Bell's take on the IPA.  However, I found this to be harder to drink than most IPA's. But please dont let that keep your from trying this beer, its excellent in my opinion.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DogFood11,4.87,"A dear friend brought this back from Minnesota on recent business trip. 12oz brown bottle with a salmon on the label. Poured into a mini tulip it forms a sticky white head that leaves chunky lace. Orange body.  Speaking of oranges this is full if bitter orange zest. I thought I found the greatest IPA in the land when I tried green flash but this is as good if not better. ""Lively"" would be a good term to describe this brew. ""Fresh"" would be another. Its just got that freshly picked from the garden type feel to it. Carbonation is super fine and gives it a cascading drop after each pull. Sweetness is more evident as it warms a bit but it is still acting as support and balance.  Notes: One of the best....If not the best Ipa's I've had to date.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Monkeyknife,4.35,"Poured from the bottle cloudy orange-gold. Came with a healthy head and left with nice lacing.  Floral hops and grapefruit greet the nose.  Hops, hops, and hops with the grapefruit make it something special.  Mid-bodied with light carbonation.  This is a great IPA. Very drinkable and one I'll always have in the fridge.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jockstrappy,4,"Pours a pale copper color with a small white head. Aroma is a balanced combination of floral hop notes and mild pear. Taste begins with a generous floral hop punch as soon as it hits the mouth. A slight bread-like malt backbone can be noticed in the roof of the mouth right before a dry, hoppy finish that leaves you no choice but to take another sip. Being fairly light in both body and carbonation make this one easy on the palate, and quite easy to throw back several in a sitting. Very nice year-round beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MrMcGibblets,4.5,"i first had this beer at a bar across the street from wrigley before an afternoon game to which i had rooftop tickets. bright sunny day, bar was packed w/usual cubbie crowd of khaki-wearing, lite-swilling yuppies, but i was encouraged to see a nice tap selection (don't remember which bar at this point). this was last summer and i was still somewhat of a beer neophyte, my experience was limited to various imports, a few micros, and the beers at the local brewpub. i don't know why i picked this beer, i guess i had heard from a friend that bell's was good but thank f*cking allah that i did. this beer, although served in a 16oz plastic cup (stupid drunk cub fans-thanks), absolutely kicked my ass. this was the first beer of this quality that i had ever enjoyed up to this point. it was a nice hazy orange in color, and had an unbelievably powerful and wonderful fragrant aroma, dominated by pleasing, complex citrus (orange) notes with some floral and pine in the nose as well. that first sip was incredible, just beautifully balanced between the sweet caramel/bready malts and the delirious hops. the finish was awesome, again wonderful interplay between the malts and hops-perfect. how they made a beer taste this big and balanced at 6?% i have no idea. i only had time for two of these before we had to go the game, but the whole time i was mesmerized by this beer, despite being amidst the chaotic pre-game summer scene. i was considering ditching my party and staying at this bar for the game (the cubs suck anyways) so i could stay and have more of these. update: have had too many times to count, perfect every time. i like that this is unique in it's light color and honeyed, floral characterisitics. also that it's always well-carbonated, moreso than most bottled ipa's, but not in a seemingly artificial manner.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,udubdawg,4.47,"12 oz bottle, batch #7818. According to the website, this was bottled on Feb 5, '07 - nice and fresh.  pours a pretty peachy gold color with a very slight haze, with a nearly white pillowy head of 2 fingers thickness. Average retention. No rings of lacing, but rather a thin sheet that nearly covers one side of the glass.  This definately smells fresh. Big hop aroma, very floral and quite a bit of earthiness. The aroma suggests more bittering than citrus though, which did not come through in the flavor. Very pleasant.  The aroma had me momentarily thinking ESB, but the flavor is all nice hoppy/sweet/citrusy IPA. Definately sweeter than I expected from the nose, and not what I'd call balanced - who cares - I'll call it delicious! A medium bitter bite that doesn't detract from drinkability in the least. Lighter than I expected and the hop attack never numbs the tastebuds. A surprisingly clean finish with just a bit of bittering. Carbonation is appropriate and despite the light mouthfeel this brew is very satisfying - well done!  Not available where I live...story of my life. Not the best IPA I've ever had, but definately top 20. This beer is devoid of any true flaws and has some great strengths. This goes down absurdly easy and I'd love to have a few more tonite but I must ration my supply.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,meatyard,4.13,"Pours a bright, clear amber with an orange hue, The head is a good 2-3 fingers of ivory color that drops slowly leaving a good amount of lacing. The smell is a very fresh, pungent pine & citrus. It has a sharp hops and resin taste with a bitter bite and a lot of complexity in between. A nice medium mouthfeel. A very tasty, easy to drink, gone before you know it beer. Anyone liking an Am. IPA will probably appreciate another high quality Bell's beer. I'd love to be able to have a fresh one of these anytime I felt like it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Byeast,4.3,"Appearance: golden orange , mostly clear , with a large , foamy offwhite head. Walls of lacing left on my pint.  Smell: Hops abound , lots of different hop scents , citrusy , some fruit cup , grapefruit, peach , floral , mango , quite complex.  Taste: A very interesting and intricate, hoppy ride. Lots of hops that are floral , semi-pungent , slightly citrusy , grapefruit, some more fruity tastes in there , nice mild underlying bisquity malt throughout. The hop flavors take their turns on the tongue , pleasantly complex. The aftertaste is citrusy/bit fruity , slighty dry , and very lasting.  Mouthfeel: smooth and medium bodied.  Drinkability: A damn drinkable and fresh IPA. Great hop profile that shows lots of complexity , with a nice restraint for the amount of hops there is. Really tasty a balanced , nicely crafted brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mjc410,4.31,"The pour into my Sam Smith glass raises a wild inch-and-a-half head after a not-so-hard pour (I like hyphens). It falls, of course; but ever so slowly, leaving thick bubbles and lace stuck to the sides of the glass. It's only slightly off-white. The body is a bright, translucent gold with a honey coloration. When the glass is tilted, the lacing is patchy and slick. The nose is bitter and filled with citrus notes, and perhaps slight hints of white raisins. The taste is just on the bitter side of balanced, and reminds me of a rich white bread with marmalade. There's also a bit of pepper. Very nice. The mouth is quite thin, with perfect carbonation. Paired exceptionally with some sharp cheddar. I usually don't overly enjoy IPAs, and this bottle of the six pack, the very last, tasted much better than the others. Maybe I'm just in the mood, but this is a great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Poured a hazy copper orange color, with about two fingers of thick, frothy white head that hung around almost to the end. Left sticky , thick gobs of lace on the side of the glass. Had a rather mild nose to it. Hops , grass, bread, and some sweet fruity tones. Taste was of mild bittering hops, sweet malt that balances the beer out nicely. Some citrus notes in the background as well. A pretty mild brew. Pretty well balanced in the mouth, moderately carbonated with a nice full refreshing feel to it. Drinkability is great. I have to get more of this brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BillyB,3.85,"First tried this at a Michael Jackson beer dinner and then got a bottle in a trade.  Pours a dark amber to light copper color. Thick 2 fingered head lasted pretty long.  Piney hop aromatics dominate but there are some complex fruity esters in there to. Berries, Pear, and citrus notes.  Bitterness is up front . Slightly sweet maltiness with just a hint of caramel.  Medium bodied and very smooth drinking. A great session beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,quikfish13,4.52,"Upon the finish of pouring this beer, looking at the light copper tone of the body brings a warm inviting apearence. A thick foamy 2 finger head shows a light tan shade. This is all complimented upon the sweet aroma eminating from the glass. A burst of hops with a citrus (orange and lemon flavors come to mind) undertone come out full force from this beverage.  With tasting this fine Bell's beer my mouth is overwhelmed with the sweet flavor of hops. Coming out strong on the begining this is definetly a style of beer for people that want hoppiness in there beer. The malty taste comes out in the middle and at the end the bitterness hits, but does not leave a unpleasent after taste.  Leaving a pleasent feel in my mouth, with a tangy feeling brought on from the constant citrus flavors this is a beer that goes down so smooth but allows you to realize that you are drinking a beer, and not water. I personally am the biggest fan of the smell and taste but this is probably the standard that all IPAs should try and live up too.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,eberkman,4.7,"Poured a hazy, honeylike orange-amber with a full, rocky white head that retained very well. Presented an inviting aroma of floral hops with some piney and citrus notes.  The taste was about the most perfect example of an American IPA I can think of. Strong floral hops up front, balanced out by a smooth, delicate maltiness toward the middle, transforming into a hoppy, bitter, dry finish that didn't linger too much in an unpleasant way.  Very crisp, refreshing mouthfeel with outstanding drinkability. This is one I'd desperately like to be able to have around, but Bell's doesn't distribute in Massachusetts so I'm limited to my yearly trip home to Michigan. Too bad. This would probably be my go-to, 6-pack-in-the-fridge-at-all-times beer.  I also had one last night on tap at All-Season Grill in East Lansing -- very nice as well, but I preferred it out of the bottle.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,DGryger,4.28,"Appearance: Rusty tan color body, fairly cloudy with moderate amounts of bubbles streaming up through the glass. Nice off white head rises to around 1.25-1.5 and settles down to some coarse bubbles and a good lace.  Smell: Upon opening the bottles I am greeted with a sweet malty odor. There is a little biscuity-citrusness to the smell as well. Floral notes appear as beer warms. I think aroma is the weak spot of this particular brew.  Taste: I can taste some biscuity malt notes up front with a hop bite in the middle to finish. Floral hop taste in the middle with a bitter/tangy finish. Well balanced and not a bottle full of bitter. Biscuity-bready notes become more apparent as the beer warms along with a bit of sweet alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Thin to medium bodied brew, good carbonation and goes down pretty smooth for an IPA. Little nip on the tip of my tongue as I swallow it down. Overall it has a very nice feel.  Drinkability: Quite tasty and easy drinking for an IPA, mostly due to the good balance between the hops and the malt. The relatively low ABV (for an IPA) make this a decently sessionable beer that I would have no problem packing away three or four. Definitely will add this to my would buy a case of it list.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,CaptCleveland,4.28,"One bottle from a six-pack purchased from local Wild Oats on the east side of Cleveland. When the Batch ID from the back label is entered at the brewery website it is noted that this six-pack was packaged on January 16, 2007.  Great 2-finger head, residual foam and plenty of Belgian lace throughout the tasting. Strong piney-hops predominate with citrus and a behind-the-scenes malt aroma that conjures memories of DFH's 60- and 90-minute IPAs.  Wonderful hop flavor with subtle malt balance but disappears as the hops predominate and linger on the palate. Mouthfeel is a bit oily and thin.  From the aroma I expected a full throttle hop explosion but discovered an overall well balanced IPA that allows the starring hops to be well supported by a nice malt flavor. I have not been disappointed by Bell's and plan to make a pilgrimage this summer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Anyway, it pours a big beautiful head without even trying, I poured a little rough and had to stop the ensueing head from overflowing the glass. Looks great!! The smell is very nice grassy hops that are smooth and not harsh at all. The taste is a bit reminiscent of the Bohemoth this year from FFF, so if you've had it this is very similar. The mouthfeel is very nice, only a little bit of harsh carbonation comes through. Overall I am very glad to get this fine drink in IOWA!!!! I will have many more to come. Thank you so much Bell's!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,oakbluff,4.45,"A classic American IPA. It pours the color would expect, has a perfect head, and then the nose- wow! Great hop aromatics. The taste is just perfect- fruity, perfume hops, without any astringent bitterness. Just amazing. Malts are then as a great backbone, but this beer is about the hops as it should be. The approachableness of the hops is what really sets this apart from the crowd. Any average non hop head can have a sip of this and say- this is a really tasty beer. That is an accomplishment that can't be understated- for the masses and for the hop head. Between Two Hearted and Stone IPA for the best all round IPA in the US, in my limited experience.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bluejacket74,4.45,"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a golden/orange color with a white head that lingers around a while. Lacing is good. It smells mostly like floral and citrusy hops, very nice. The taste is obviously hoppy, with just a bit of malty sweetness, it has good balance to it. The mouthfeel is thin, but it's very smooth and crisp. Drinkability is very good too, I think it's a good sessionable beer.

287,1093,shadow1961,4.18,"When I got sick the week before last, I didn't smoke. Only stupid people smoke when they are sick. But when I was not sick anymore, I decided to carry on not smoking and see what happened.  What happened was I coughed up a bunch of squishy brown stuff, and day by day, I started noticing things.  The first thing that really struck me was beer. Last friday, I went down to the E' for a steak, beer, and some music, what was happening was so vivid I took some notes.  I got a Bell's Two Hearted Ale from Amanda (along with a glass- you can't really see and smell your brew when you suck it out of a bottle), and started scribbling.  Two Hearted Ale pours out a fluffy head with some nice lacing over a golden brew. The lot number on the bottle (#7591), looked up later at Bell's website, indicated the beer was bottled back on August 16, 2006. The nose was this remarkable blend of strawberry marmelade, pine, and herb- which I completely missed the first time I had some about a year ago. I thought at the time that it was it was hoppy, but well made- I missed all the subtleties because at the time I was sucking on a pipe a few times a day. The flavor was malt with a more herbal hoppyness, and the aftertaste was also herbal. A lot of brewers settle for lots of bitterness when they cook up a batch of India Pale Ale- the fact that Bell's has the skill and insight to get as much as they can out of their choice of ingredients is what makes their reputation. Two Hearted Ale is what I measure all IPA's against- so far, it's the best in my book.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,arguemaniac,4.15,"Ive heard a lot about this beer in the short time its been here in the NoVa area and I must say it manages to live up to the hype. Aromatic floral hops in the enticing nose. Rich, but not overly bitter hops blend well with a delicious grain palate that features great caramel malt flavors as well. My only complaint is the slightly watery mouthfeel, but even that has an upside; it adds the beers already excellent drinkability.  Highly recommended",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Carbonation appears medium and persistant.  Piney hop nose, with hints of apricots and oranges. The pineapple is all over the place.  Taste: The fruity hop nose is mimicked in the initial flavor. Not much of a malt backbone here, instead the fruity hops melt into the bitter finish with only a peak of pale sweet malty goodness. The bittering hops leave the mouth dry and the hand reaching for the h20.  Mouthfeel is crisp, mostly full and drying.  A really drinkable light ipa, with alot of hop character but seems a tad unbalanced. i think a little more malt character would make this brew even better than its reputation. Still easily drinkable and sessionable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

I love the dry fruitiness of these aromas intermingled with citrusy hops. Very complex aromas for an american pale ale. Just begs to be sipped!  Taste is everything one would expect from the aromas and appearance. This one does not disappoint. Complex and fruity up front, followed by a battle between hops and malt. Finishes clean and dry. The perfect balance. This beer is not overly malty and cloying like many pale ales that try to balance a gargantuan hop schedule.  Light and fluffy on the tongue. Bottle conditioning is well worth it. This beer would be disapointing if force carbonated. Finishes hoppy, but not to the point of oily and bitter on the tongue.  A very enjoyable IPA. This one is on the top of my all time favorite domestic IPA's. The dry finish keeps my palate alive and awake, waiting for that next incredible quaff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

T- Very very balanced but hops are dominant. No ""caramel"" sneaking up on you, or any vegetable-y hops there either. Pure floral Centennial hops. I have often wished they made an air freshener out of this brew.  M- Very clean. The carbonation is very well done, not too much or little.

I am definitely getting some slight citrus and/or coriander scents as well. Very appealing.  T: A gorgeous wallop of hops smacks your tongue right off the bat, then the malts slip in to balance the overall flavor, and everything finishes at once, like a perfectly timed meal. Hop lovers will definitely want to grab this beer.  M: Not a ton of body, a tiny bit thin, but overall very nice.  D: Now here is where this beer truly shines.

M: Lighter and thinner than I would expect, probably due to the increased alcohol and overall paleness of the malt. Pleasant.

Pours a cloudy, swirling orange. Big foamy head, spots of lacing ring the glass. Looks like a fresh and lively ale, which it delivers in it's other aspects as well.  Sharp fruity hops in the aroma, abundant but not overboard. Taste follows the hoppy nose, distinctly grapefruit and pale malt. Slight dryness increases it's drinkability quite a bit.  This is great for a session...i'm going to miss this on tap around Chicago, especially the Empty Bottle (this was their best beer option). Come back Bell's!  Notes 11-2007: Sampled an ""aged cask"" of this recently, after a year it is way mellow, and strongly similar to hop tea. Uncarbonated, watery, with an earthy suggestion of hops, but nowhere near as balanced as it is fresh. A novelty (not altering any scores here).

Great hop flavor to pair with the great hop aroma.  Mouthfeel - light/medium in body. Nice and crisp.  Drinkability - Sessionable, in fact if I could get this easier it would be my new go to IPA.

287,1093,Damian,3.75,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle (Thanks to my girlfriend Nari for bringing this one back from Ohio.)  Poured a hazy, straw yellow with a fizzy, white, one-finger head. A touch of floating sediment was noticeable. Some drippy, short-lived streaks of lacing trickled down the glass.  Aroma was quite subdued at first. Mildly hoppy with a bit of sweet malts. As the beer warmed, the hops became somewhat more pronounced and took on citrusy characteristics. Some sweet, bready malts came out as well.  The taste was much more pronounced than the aroma. Intense hops assaulted the palate from start to finish. Aggressively hoppy up front with piney, resiny, grapefruit-like cascade hops and a touch of sweet malts. The hoppiness seemed to settle mid-palate and some bready notes were apparent. Crisp on the swallow with a bitter, biting, lingering, hoppy finish. Alcohol taste was hardly perceivable, but you could feel it effects toward the end of the drink.  Medium bodied with a lush and creamy mouthfeel.  This is a hop bomb, pure and simple. It has enough hops for a DIPA but lacks the malt and alcohol presence.

Appearance: gold-orange color with a nice 3/4"" white head from the tap; looks pretty good Smell: hops dominate Taste: ehhh, decent, but nothing too impressive; there's a hoppiness, but a mustiness also; im not sure where the mustiness comes from, but it didnt please me too much; slight sweet malt presence Mouthfeel: medium bodied, good carbonation Drinkability: decent, didn't have another one on the night",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,blackie,4.5,"cask at Maduro Madison with dirtylou and golden2wenty1  appearance: The fluffy, off-white head recedes only partially, exhibiting great retention and nice lacing. The beer is a pretty clear golden-amber in color.  smell: The aroma is full of leafy green C hops and pale, grainy husk aromas. The usual tropical fruits, though slightly muddied in the cask.  mouthfeel: The carbonation is low, and the body a full, smooth medium.  taste: At first I notice an unexpected oak flavor. Flavors of crisp hops and subdued caramel malts. Light to moderate bitterness in the finish.  drinkability: easy...There was more of a difference between this and a standard Two Hearted than I expected.  bottle dated 11.12.13 consumed 12.06.13 - just as lovely as always, floral and bright citrus rind of lemon/lime/tangerine, so fresh, exceedingly cleanly malted with a perfect bitterness, a personal favorite and key to my intro into the scene - scores left intact. going back to my roots tonight with two hearted, double cream, cherry, java, expedition, and third coast on deck.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,kboett77,3.32,"I was always put off this beer by the freaky looking fish on the label. However, having recieved some as a gift, I thought I would give it a try. It is drinkable, with a strong grapefruit tone and a nice fullness to it. But I was no super impressed, to me it lacked some of the complexity and over tones of other IPAs. If I try it again I'll give an update as I am suprised that this well liked beer from a well respected brewery isn't doin' it for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Bighuge,4.65,"Hazy dim copper. Thin beige head. Lace is more than adequate. Spotty, droopy lace all the way down. Aroma is a lot of hops and a little toffee malts. Not quite as ""bright"" of hop tones, but they make themselves known nonetheless. The flavor is great. Again, the hops aren't as ""bright"" as the pushed or bottled version of this, but they are very enjoyable in their citric and piney characteristics. The malts are toffeeish in nature and provide the perfect balance to the hops. The bitterness is very clean. The mouthfeel is perfect. Creamy and velvety and very little carbonation. Room temperature and perfect. This was the first time I had this on cask and it was so damn drinkable. This one is drinkable by the gallon in this form.

Fluffy head dissolves into thin layer that covers the top layer of the beer. Patchy, sticky lacing stays throughout the sample.  S: Floral. Pungent citrus smells abound. Dough or butter also prominent.  T: Nice citric hop bite bite on the front end. Grapefruit, lemon and even oranges saturate the tongue. Caramel malts slip in to balance the brew. A clean butter like flavor in the aftertaste.  M: Ample carbination for the style. Smooth and crisp upfront and creamy thick on the back end.  D: Drinkability is sky high. A true hop head's session beer. Extremely clean and refreshing. An easy drinker for every occasion.

287,1093,geexploitation,4.42,"Reviewing this for a second time... possibly a bad bottle the first time around. Pours cloudy and golden with a touch of amber -- looks like a cloudy Normandy cider -- with little head (this bottle is getting a little old -- or should I say, aged). The aroma is bright and gorgeous -- fruity (pears, apples, classic English stuff), hoppy, and spicy (that's baked spices, not hot spices). This being Bell's, there's an appropriately huge malt backing to all this, which provides stunning caramel malt background.  On the palate, fresh bitterness first off, then the fruits come out. At the mid-palate, the beer shifts back toward bitter, but this time the bitterness has an earthy quality lacking from the first go-round. The finish is rich and buttery, with some hop oils that stick around for a good while after swallowing. Mouthfeel features vigorous carbonation and smooth malts roughened up with hop oils.  Overall, this is outstanding. I'm sorry that I waited this long to re-try this beer after getting an obviously bad bottle. I need to try this fresh or, even better, cask conditioned. All the flavor components exist in harmony here, and all the components individually possess a high quality.

Had a good head that settles down to a constant foamy top. Considerable lacing throughout the drink. The mouthfeel was awesome - nice and creamy. The aroma is most definitely IPA with dominance of hops and what another reviewer called piney resin. There is also something sweet in there but I can't identify it. The taste is also awesome with a smooth start then a big bit of hops then settles down before becoming to bitter. Very well balanced.

287,1093,sullysbeer,4.52,"Aroma: Huge Floral Hop aroma. Caramel malt sweetness and some alcohol.  Appearance: Clear golden with a creamy head retention that lasts till the last drop.  Flavor: Huge floral hop flavor and finishes with a spicy hop bitterness that lingers a bit but delicious, all balanced with a base and caramel malt sweetness. Has a touch of alcohol flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, creamy and perfect carbonation.  Overall Impression: This beer RULES on the beer engine or hand pull.  A beer engine or hand pump is used to siphon the beer, using air. The beer engine is a half-pint (sometimes a 1/4 pint), airtight piston chamber - pulling down on the handle raises the piston which drags up a half pint of beer. When a cask is first tapped into the beer engine, or after the lines have been washed through, the pump needs to be pulled several times to clear the lines of air or water. The line will continue to hold beer, which will tend to go stale overnight, so the first beer pulled through will be bad beer, and this will be simply thrown away. Most pubs will pull through at least a pint of beer on each beer engine before they open, while others will wait for the first order of beer on that pump before pulling through. Experienced bar staff will serve a pint with two long, smooth, slow pulls of the pump handle, plus a short third just to make sure the glass is full.  Hangin' at Bell's in 1999, every Sunday was Two Hearted Ale on the hand pull afternoons. We would go up there after a heavy night of college drinking and would cure our hangovers. If you ever catch this beer at the Brewery on the hand pull, it will probably be the only beer you drink that day.

Poured a clear amber with an average white frothy somewhat lasting head with layered rings of lacing denoting my sip timeline.  Smelt of strong oily pine resin, grapefruit rinds, fish, light peaches, strawberries, and sweet bread.  Taste was upfront medium strong bittersweet spruce and moderate bitter and sour grapefruit followed by a moderate bitter and skunky and fishy resin taste on a long peach and spruce finish. Palate was medium bodied, creamy, softly carbonated, and lightly astringent.  Overall, a very satisfying soft yet hearty IPA. Excellent flavors, and well balanced in its flavor profile.

S - Moderate hoppy nose with a well-balanced malty aroma as well. Lots of citrus/grapefruit hops... it even smelled a bit sticky!  T - Moderately bitter initial flavor followed by a surprisingly bitter sweet finish with an average duration.  M - The hops feel like they stick to the sides of your tongue, giving way to an almost numbing sensation. This was quite a little lively beer, with lots of carbonation and a slightly sticky mouthfeel.  D - Overall, this is a very well-rounded IPA that was surprisingly a bit sweeter than I had anticipated. Lots of nice, sticky hops. I would pick up a case of this sometime.

The flavor of the beer was very citrusy with lots of grapefruit. The maltiness of the beer was relatively prominent for an American IPA. Rich caramel and biscuit malt flavors.

More of the piney hop smell than anything else came through. This beer on cask is really interesting. You lose a lot of the hop bite, but this beer is so smooth and creamy that it makes up for it. Instead of getting the hop bite as soon as you drink it, it really comes through about midway through each drink. A little more subtle, but it's there. This is very drinkable. This is so smooth that it's dangerous.

Definitely a lot of hops which made the mouth water in anticipation of what was ahead.  Crisp and clean with all the anticipated hops coming through. It was difficult to make this last 30 minutes.  Probably did not give enough thought to how it felt. Too excited to drink and then provide a proper evaluation. Nothing off here.

287,1093,yelterdow,4.52,"Batch 7703, packaged on October 23, 2006. Big thanks go to Ego for the big score and letting some NJ BAs sample some of Bell's finest works.  Served in an imperial pint glass at just over fridge temperature.  Appearance- Pours a beautiful radiant gold... it doesn't quite know whether to go more towards yellow or red. There is a slight haze, and the head swells to three fingers of thickness. The crown settles to a fat cap of foam, leaving both sheets and spots of lacing behind.  Smell- Sweet, floral notes showcasing honey and ruby red grapefruit... the nose alone is thirst quenching, mingling with the cool air above the beer and waking the taste buds.  Taste- The success of this beer is its balance. The citrusy hop character surrounds the tongue and grips the mouth, while the malts set up their bready, clean finish. The ensuing burps are wonderfully fragrant, at least from my perspective. I get to smell them instantly!  Mouthfeel- I had to bump this number up to 5. While some IPAs begin their descent after decanting in a glass for a half-hour, this only gets smoother and more enjoyable. Slick and absolutely amazing... the carbonation *swooshes* in the mouth with grace and perfection.  Drinkability- With so many IPAs available in NJ (and more are coming), this would be a real gift to hopheads in our region. This beer has it all... and it makes me want to savor each sip.

Pours a cloudy gold/amber with a white head that lasts forever. Aroma of bready malt, rindy citric hops, and a fish fry.  HELlo!!! Big IPA blast right off the rip - citrusy hops all over the place along with a honey/caramel biscuity, bready malt, with the hop rindiness grabbing the tongue while the rest of the balanced honey and hops glide over the taste buds. There's some solid, highly drinkable beer in this bottle - the kind that says ""yeah, it's a session, but you're gonna be calling a cab.""

287,1093,foureyedgeek,4.3,"After the recent discussion in the forums about favorite IPAs and then Bell's Two Hearted specifically, I decided it was time to revisit it.  This is from a 12 oz bottle, Batch 7720  Pours a bright golden straw color, quite clear but not completely. Nice fluffy inch or so of head, that stands up out of glass, above the rim before receding to a light bubbly foam. Laces nicely down the glass.  Smell bursts of hops, not overpowering though. Floral and citrus here. Slightly sweet. I've heard this described as beer Froot Loops (like the cereal) and that fits it well  And the taste, wow. This is such a great IPA, the balance is perfect. There a nice malt presence that, while less prominent than the hops, allows this to be a very quaffable beer. The hops make this one quite juicy and I get a little pine as well. The finish is crisp, drying and bitter.  Mouthfeel is drying and the carbonation on this one makes it quite crisp, as I said above.  This beer really excels in drinkability, its such a tasty beer and would make for an excellent session beer when your taste buds are in a bitter mood.

M- Nice medium body, perhaps on the light side of medium, with a good amount of carbonation.  D- Excellent drinkability. I could definitely put down a few of these with ease.

287,1093,SwillBilly,4.5,"Served from 12 oz bottle  Appearance: Pours honey gold in color with a thick, foamy 2 finger white head that just sticks to the glass. Streams of carbonated bubbles flow to the surface. The head last forever as is ever so slowly fades.  Smell: Big wafts of lovely Centennial hops explode from the glass with aromas of grapefruit rind and pine with just a mild hint of sweet amber fruits trying to breakthrough the Centennials.  Taste: Start with a bang with those Centennial hops really shining through. Big juicy grapefruit flavor with a hint of pine thrown in for good measure. The middle is where the malts make an appearance with a pleasant honey like sweetness that tries to balance out the hops, however the hops prevail but the malts do make a nice showing. The finish is all Centennials as a grapefruity bitterness lingers long on the tongue after the swallow leaving the mouth dry and begging for more. Alcohol extremely well hidden. Outstanding !  Mouthfeel: Somewhat creamy and dry to the finish. Definitely makes you take another sip. Carbonation spot on with a lively mouthfeel.  Drinkability/Notes: After much anticipation, Bell's Two Hearted made it to the DC area and the wait was well worth it. A fantastic IPA made with all Centennial hops makes for a hop heads delight. Big grapefruity hops with just a touch of honey like sweetness to balance makes for a delicious IPA. Alcohol is well hidden. Visually this is one great beer as the clarity of the beer, the long lasting head and huge amounts of sticky lacing make it visually appealing. Two Hearted lives up to its billing as one of the best IPA's and one that has found a permanent home in my DBF. Drinkability factor is through the roof as I could drink these all day.

The smell and taste however, are wonderful. I just kept smelling it over and over until one of fiends told me to finally taste it. The smell was compromised mostly of sweet spices, orange peel, coriander, and hints of hops. The taste was spicy, a good blend of hops and fruity tones. A perfect amount of carbonation and alcohol (which isnt very noticeable) make this brew easily drinkable. Wish I had more and will definitely purchase more in the future.

Hop smell is fantastic, not sure of hops used but the aroma is something you want to suck across your olfactory over and over.  Taste is nice - a fair amount of malt provides the balance I feel is needed for highly hopped beers.  Mouthfeel is good but is a little too thin. Carbonation feels nice on the tongue.

287,1093,Darkale,4.57,"I've been waiting to try this beer for a long while, but it has only recently become available in Virginia. To celebrate its arrival in the Old Dominion, I have poured it into my etched Monticello stein, in honor of one of the commonwealth's most famous sons.  It's a slightly cloudy beer, brassy in color, with a thin and resilient head and thin trails of lace. Its aroma is similar to DFH 60 minute, but finer, more delicate, and eminently floral. Marvelous in the mouth -- chewy, with slightly burning grapefruit and pine nicely offset by malt... my word, my word, was this worth the wait.  After you swallow, your mouth tingles slightly, and it seems that the beer is now coming out of your salivary glands! Which is far more pleasant an effect than it probably sounds.  I keep coming back to the word ""delicate."" That's a strange word, considering that this is such a hoppy brew. But it is, it is delicate. Perhaps balanced is a better word. This is very nice. As it warms, it becomes even more complicated.  This is far too drinkable. I don't usually find beers that make that characteristic so easy to score. I love a moderately-alcoholic IPA that still manages to slap you around a bit.

Appearance: This one poured a burnt ornage hue but bright orange when held to the light. The frothy white head stood up to be recognized and maintained its standing power for quite some time, leaveing behind a thick trail of bubbles. Also you can find lots of beading floating vigoriously to the top.  Smell: The aromas are strong, sweet, and piney hops. Mild roasted maltiness. Has just hint of alcohol in the nose. Mostly im detecting some fresh greens and pines. Not bad by any means.  Taste: The flavors are much like the nose, prodominately piney hops and fresh greens straight from the garden. Has just subtle sweetness from the malts. The alcohol is definitely there but not enough to steal from this bittersweet blend.  Mouthfeel: This beer has a medium body and high levels of carbonation. Smooth and easy going down. Has a bubblely finish and leaves a slight bittering in the aftertaste.  Drinkability: I would love to sit back and throw a few of these away.

287,1093,andrewmartin,3.78,"A: Pours in hues ranging from burnt gold to amber with a pillowy head  S: Pretty straightforward piney hops aroma dominate, some malt  T: The inital hop bitterness was balanced out by creamy malt undertones, hop bitterness lingers one. As it warms a bit of grass becomes evidence, as does grapefruit, both on the palate and the mouthfeel (biting, acidic).  M: Starts off pretty creamy, but as it warms, becomes increasingly acidic.  D: A very nice example of the IPA style, if not mind blowing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,hckyfn9999,4.65,Pours a hazy golden orange color with a nice two finger head with good retention and lacing.  Aroma is citrus and floral hops primarily and a faint caramel smell in the background.  Taste is more of the same. Citrusy hops. A little grapefruit and a little orange peel. Also a little pale malt present as well. A bread/dough like pressence towards the end.  Mouthfeel is smooth and is very pleasant.  This is definitely an easy drinking beer that I will pick up again.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jcdiflorio,5,"Served on tap from my draft system into a 16oz pub glass  Light copper,reddish hue,almost clear slight hazieness,very livey looking beer. A very dense,rocky looking head,Sticking to the sides of the glass,looking like chunks of cottage cheese,very retentative,equally as inviting. The breathtaking aroma super clean,a intense grapefruit aroma,like having a fresh grapefruit ripped apart in frount of your face,also piney and caramelly sweet. Tasted like a sugar coated grapefruit,crisp and clean,tangy.Carmelly and piney,a perfectly balanced taste. It was so hard to rate the taste,I didn't want to put the glass long enough to jot down the notes A medium mouthfeel,the perfect cloyingness,a nice inviting prickley feeling on the palate. An unforgetable tongue swelling juicyness making me crave more,more,more. The more you drink the more you want,the most drinkable IPA I've ever had.The standard of IPA's to me. The draft version of this one seems better than the bottled version. This beer will spend a lot of time on my draft system. A must try IPA!  Try not to give out all 5""s,but I couldn't do it any other way!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,terrabyte,4.13,"Pours a cloudy, light-copper beer with a tall frothy white head.  Aroma is strong with sweet wheat and grapefruit.  Flavor is typical with citrus, grapefruit, and bitter pine hops. Has a nice, bready body that isn't very sweet. That is a huge plus for me. Even the citrus flavor isn't very strong compared to what I was expecting from the aroma. I suppose it depends on the mood, but I found the piney, bitter, dry aftertaste to be a bit strong, throwing off whack an otherwise perfectly balanced beer.  Drinkability is quite high. A bottle will disappear before you know it.  Very pleasing beer. I found the flavor much more appealing than the aroma.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,unclecrappy,3.88,"On tap at the Sharp Edge in East Liberty. Poured in a pint glass.  A: Interesting ... dark amber, almost orange. Head holds on forever.  S: It's a pale ale, so you get some of the things you expect, like pine and citrus. But there's also something sweet ... and that's a tease for ...  T/M: Here's where Two-Hearted Ale steps away from the norm. The pines and citrus from the hops are heavy, but they mix with a honey-sweetness you don't expect at all. Wow, it's good. And even with the sweet tones, the beer has a nice, slightly bitter finish. Very smooth.  D: Um, I'll have another, please.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Melchizedek,4.12,"Pours goldish amber with a towering foamy head.  I poured this into a snifter and I'm glad I did. Wonderful aromatics, floral, citrusy (lots of grapefruit and tangy lemon peel), a touch of pine resin, with a whiff of yeasty character. All that hop gets matched by a very nice bready malt in the mouth, medium body, with a light, smooth carbonation. Not unlike drinking some tropical flower. Surprisingly light on bitterness, if a bit on the tart side; hops ease back into a mineral bite.  Deceptively easy drinking; nice to have a good old-fashioned single IPA without too much alcohol showing through. Very pleasing all around, especially on the nose.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A: Hazy golden color, very warm with some shades of amber and a huge frothy off-white head, at least 2 fingers. Dissolves v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y... Busy streams of carbonation and nice lacing.  S: Wow, they weren't kidding about ""enormous hops"" on the label...big fruity, resinous and floral hops explode out of the glass. Sweet malts are present, too. Nose is predominantly tangerine/citrus and sourdough bread. Smells wonderful.  T: Hoppy and juicy sweet. Great full flavors of citrus and loads of grainy/sugary malt. A nearly perfect IPA, holds it's own with any of the best that my area (Pacific NW) can offer...great balance.  M: Crisp and clean, with a medium body and full mouthfeel. MY tongue curled at the sides, salivating from the copious juicy hops. Surprisingly sweet thoughout, but with a nice lingering bitterness and smooth citrus-hopped backbone.  D: Simply a wonderful IPA! No doubt I'd have another of these - fortunately I received two in the trade.

287,1093,grego,4.67,"I poured this from a 12oz bottle I got from Westy's outside of Harrisburg PA. It's sort of a golden amber with a smallish head that lingered for a while. Nice lacing throughout. The smell is great with lots of pine, citrus, and a little honey. Very balanced. The taste is much like the smell lots of citrus, pine, and some clove as well. Not too bitter but not sweet at all. The mouthfeel is smooth and dry at the end. This is a very drinkable beer. The kind of AIPA that you can have many of. Definitely one of the best AIPA's I have ever had. Really perfect for the style. Very hoppy but not stringently bitter - nicely balanced. Great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,redmash,4.6,"Poured a great amber/orange color. Awesome hop aroma. Citrus/piney notes very apparent. Solid, long lasting white head with good lace throughout the beer.

I can smell the tangy citrus and evergreen/grassy hops from 5 feet away. Tons of hop aroma ride quite nicely atop a solid bed of citrus sweet candy.  Hello American IPA! This fantastic beer is packed with taste without succumbing to overdone bitterness levels or off-balanced maltiness.  This beer is extremely smooth and drinkable. Lots of nice crisp citrus hop aroma and flavor mixed with lightly toasty malt and a nice clean lemon finish.  I just realized that my case of this is almost empty and I had yet to review it. So I quickly banged out this review. I hope I did this beer some justice.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BeerBelcher,4.37,"Id heard a lot of positive buzz about this beer before trying it for the first time. Now, in my part of the world at least, it seems like it occupies sort of a gold standard of craft beer (IPAs at least). Appearance is amber and cloudy. Gead sticks around, and around. This particular example was still sitting around even after the glass was empty. Aroma is definitely hoppy, and a bit sweet. Flavor is hops plus citrus and very pleasant. And after, you get those great hop-flavored burps! Ive had it before, and Ill be having it again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Metalmonk,4.45,"My first-ever beer from the legendary Bell's comes courtesy of super-trader melbatoast93. Thanks Hart!  The color and cap alone indicate this is going to be a kickass beer. Vibrant dirty orange color with a foamy, fluffy head that sticks around long enough to appreciate it. Stayed for the whole drink, and even left thick strands of lace.  Smell is a big robust hoppiness, pine and grapefruit both coming to mind, with a juicy sour grape essence providing the kicker.  The flavors deliver on the promise of the aroma: Bitter/sour grapefruit provides a prickly bite, with a juicy, piney, resin-like goodness following. The malt is but a faint lick in the background, but it's there and at least tries to make itself known through the hop haze. Nice mellow honey sweetness shows up in the finish.  Ok, so I'd probably have the mouthfeel be just a little chewier, and definitely creamier. It's just a little too carbonated, and on the thinner side. But still, that's a minor criticism. This beer delivers. It's utterly satisfying, while at the same time leaving you wanting more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,cafemondegar,4.41,"By the time the beer was brought to my table, it had lost all head, if it had any to begin with. Golden-orange in color. Has a rich, hoppy aroma. Very tempting. The taste is equally great. Plenty of hops, well balanced. Mouthfeel is a great mix of sweet & bitterness and the aftertaste lingers on, playing on your taste buds. I tend to be stricter in my assessment of American IPAs, those being my favorite and I recognize my tendency to get carried away while having one - but this is indeed a great beer and I'll definitely recommend to all beer enthusiasts.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,doubleipa,4.47,Stumbled on this at a good restaurant in Akron. This is one great IPA. Great hop aroma and a nice crisp taste. Not over the top and not too pine resin-like. A little different that some of my other favorite IPAs. A little smoother to drink. They went down really quick.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jackorain,4.5,"Thanks to Ron as this is his selection in our beer club.  A-Amber/copper, cloudy from bottle conditioning. Holding the glass up, I see a swirl of ""stuff"" in the glass. Crowned 1-1/2 inch head of an off white color, head also very thick and creamy.  S-Pine hops, Pine Hops, Pine hops, then a little green hops come though. Very very strong aroma, I can smell it while pouring long before I ever brought to my nose. A great smell maybe a little one-dimensional but non-the-less great.  T-strong piney hops throughout with some green herbaceous hops thrown in for good measure. there is a good malt backbone with a little sweetness in the middle. But this beer is by no means balanced as the pine hops beats the malt into submission with a 16 lb sledge. That is not necessarily a bad thing though as this is one good beer.  M-perfect carbonation for the style IMO, not fizzy but present. Medium body with a oily characteristic that coats the mouth. Residual sugars leave a stickiness on the lips.  D-I could have a couple, but after that I might have to break into a rendition of O' Tannenbaum.  Overall-A fine well crafted beer with over the top pine hops that I could certainly appreciate on a frequent basis.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,phisig137,4.15,"Thanks to TheManiacalOne for sending this to me in a trade.  Pours a hazy 24 karat gold color, and a two finger head. Good retention gives way to a ring of bubbles around the glass, and gorgeous lacing.  Aroma is hoppy and smooth. Mostly citric hops show through here, and is well rounded and smooth. You can tell from the first sip that you're going to like this one.  The flavor here is quite nice. Very smooth and balanced, with great citric hop flavor, and a bit of caramel maltiness. Everything is well integrated and smooth from start to finish. While it is nicely hopped, it is not strongly bitter. No alcohol present anywhere. Mouthfeel is very creamy and moderately full. Drinkability is excellent.  If this were available in my area, it would without a doubt be my new ""everyday"" beer. Fantastic flavors all around, that you can really sit and enjoy, but not so outrageous that you have to pay full attention to each sip. Also, (despite the fact that I live imperial and double everything) this is a really nice change of pace. Anymore, it's almost hard to find a hoppy beer that is well balanced. This one does it perfectly. Great beer, and definitely worth seeking out. Now I'll just have to hope that Bell's starts to distribute in VA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Creamy foam head that fades quickly, but does not leave a murky looking film.  Sweet, floral smell, with a strong hop profile in the aroma. Grapefruit, honey, and some delicious smelling malts. Fruit esters. Very pleasant aroma.  One sip is all I need to know that this one is truly deserving of its praise. Strong hop taste on the palette, but biterness is surprisingly well contained/blended. Floral qualities translate well on the tongue, also a little grass/straw taste. Some lingering grapefruit from the bitterness, and a superb, crisp finish without tasting like straight, clean filtered water.  Nice, medium body, with a creamy mouthfeel. Mouthfeel does not give way to water, which I can truly appreciate. A treat to drink, drinkability is somewhere in between a session brew and a sipping brew.  Someone trade me more of this!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A good looking 1+finger white micro bubble head. Swirling carbonation rising from a few different points in my pint glass.  All I smell coming from this beer is hops, which is a very good thing. I smell a forest of pine trees and grapefruit. Makes my mouth water.  There is a small malt backbone coming through but it's mostly a hop attack. My kind of IPA. Citrus(grapefruit) hops followed by a mouthful of oily pine needles. A nice bitterness follows that gets me ready for the next drink.  Mouthfeel is a little on the lighter side but still good. Its funny but even though it's lighter it still coats my mouth. Nice amount of carbonation.  Drinkability is good. I could and have drank quite a few of these in a sitting.  Overall Two Hearted is one of the IPAs I keep in my fridge pretty often. It's refreshing and full of delicious hops. If you ask me this is a classic. Probably my favorite offering from Bell's.

287,1093,sloejams,4.75,"If I were to make a list, 4 out of the 5 best IPAs Ive ever had would be from California. This would be the one thats not.  No doubt about it, this is a fan-fucking-tastic beer. Ive waited a long time to try and when I finally got my hands on it  I got as much as I could. In Chicago, I had this on-tap every place I crossed that had it. I even had it on engine which was delicious but not quite as tasty as the regular draft.  This is a bold IPA for sure. It manages to walk the line between an IPA and a DIPA keeping the best aspects of each. The aroma is a gorgeous bouquet of pine and citrus hop flavors. The hop flavors are held in check by a sweet doughy malt character. Its a very well made beer.  I could and did drink a bunch of these. I could drink it all day honestly.

Poured into a nonic, Two Hearted Ale is undoubtedly hazy, golden amber with a dense and rocky small white head and sticky lacing. Sparse carbonation. Profoundly zesty citric hop aromas, with grapefruit and pine notes abiding. A substantial caramel malt scent is also detectable. Sharp grapefruit bitterness leads the hop profile here, with young spruce cone and apricot flavors arriving late in the sip. Some mineral notes ride along with a rather understated caramel malt bill that is all but obliterated by the brash (but not overwhelming) hops. Bready aftertaste. Peppery mouthfeel, juicy too. Pretty dry finish -- actually, pretty dry overall. Very nice mouthfeel on this just about medium-bodied ale. This is a ridiculously flavorful IPA which makes it incredibly drinkable. Easily one of the best of its style in the world.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,dblinkhorn,4.15,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Stone IPA glass.  Appearance - Pours a beautiful dark honey color with a very slight haziness. The head is thick and creamy, about two fingers tall at first. It holds well, but eventually settles thin cap of creamy head. Leaves good lacing on the way down.  Smell - A mix of sweetness with a hint of fresh, sharp/dry bitter hops. Some caramel and molasses in the middle, along with a moderate spice character. The malt aroma is rich and sweet. Moderate spicy alcohol.  Taste - Caramel sweetness up front, with a mix of crisp/bitter hops. This initial taste is well-balanced for an IPA, but the hops ultimately prevail. Peppery spiciness and some sweet fruitiness (peach?) come through after the initial flavors. The finish has rising hints of spicy alcohol with the rich, bready, and slightly sweet malts coming through. The aftertaste reveals again the crisp bitterness of the hops mixed with a mellow sweetness again.  Mouthfeel - Lots of carbonation bite off the bat, but thankfully this calms down after a second or two. Light-bodied with okay smoothness.  Drinkability - A bitter beer with an interesting rich sweetness present. Decent drinkability, as the flavors are strong.  A very good IPA, I really like the buttery/caramel sweetness it has to it. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,warmstorage,4.42,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer. Not that I didn't expect it to be good, but all I've previously had from Bell's is Expedition Stout and Batch *000 (I forget which, sadly.) I loved them both, but didn't expect their basic IPA to stand up to them. While it's obviously a different style, I love this one too.  Pours from a 12 ounce bottle a medium bright hazy orange. Retains a light white head, medium dense.  Aroma is of good things to come: citrus hops, and little else. (Just what I want in my IPA!) Maybe a tiny bit of sweet fruit -- peaches?  Tingly mouth, despite apparently only average carbonation, lingers a while, and the hop presence makes for a nice little feeling of spice.  From the first taste through the finish, this is chock full o' hops: citrus, pine, resin, grapefruit goodness. Love it. Just love it. No real alcohol presence (it's only 6%), limited sweet malt presence. In other words, nothing to get between my and my hops.  See, I'm not of the idea that an American IPA, especially one brewed as a west coast style, should be balanced: I love them totally imbalanced. This one fits the bill. It reminds me a LOT of Stone IPA, which I love.  Love it, and will happily buy it again. It's just a shame that I have to come all the way to North Dakota to get it!

Lovely scent of pine and grapefruit w/ a hint of malt and florals in the back ground. The brew is well balanced, w/ a bold and dry flavor that begins lightly sweet and ending like a IPA should ""bitter"".

This beautiful long-lasting head reduced around the edges while leaving a mesa of foam in the center of the glass, buttloads of candy lace are left in it's wake. It looks like the mashed potatoes from close encounter of the third kind. ""This means something.""  I smelled a big wallop of hop grapefruitiness as soon as I poured this one! Thats great! I'm also picking up some lemon, biscuity malt, and some sweet floral notes.  This one is heaven for a hop lover like me! Highly hopped, but not puckering by any means. The sweet biscuit malt from the smell pulls through in the taste also. I'm reminded of tart lemon-flavored cookies. This is bright and hoppy but pleasantly warm and richly malted at the same time. I really like this.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation that makes for a highly drinkable and thirst quenching brew. This one is smooth going down with an extremely dry and bitter finish.  Overall, this is a great IPA for hop-heads, and might also appeal to those who are looking to try something hoppy without getting their tongue seared. I really like the fact that a beer that is so hoppy can be so warm and inviting, not to mention EXTREMELY drinkable, at the same time. This beer has great balance of character, and I will definitely pick this up whenever I see it!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mjd83goblue,4.82,"12 oz bottle, Batch 7508 (we're halfway to Batch 8000!)  A: Orangish, somewhat cloudy, with shades of red. 1 1/2"" of foamy head drops to a thin cover that stays.  S: The predominant smell is citrusy piney good old Centennials. However, you can tell by the smell that this has the malt to stand up to them. There is also something else that I can't put my finger on that sets it apart from other IPAs, maybe some darker fruits?  T: The epitome of a balanced IPA. A huge bitter hopbomb that is set off perfectly by the maltly sweetness. Maybe a touch bitter in the finish, but thats the way I like it.  M: Medium body, a little oily  D: 6% is a little high if you want it to be a big session, but I drink this by the 6 pack.  This is currently my go-to beer when I'm just looking to have a couple (or few...), replacing SNPA and SABL. A great beer in every aspect, and I can usually get it for around $9/6er.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,supercolter,4.5,"This beer was almost a straight 4.5 across the bar. I have had a better in each category, but not by much. Appearance is golden with a two finger head and lots of lacing Smell was like a pine tree in the fall. Fantastic. Taste and mouthfeel consisted of a medium body of malt that was a bit overwhelmed by the hops, but the best floral hops I have ever tasted. Drinkability was very good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,afinepilsner,4.5,"12oz brown bottle  Two Hearted Ale was golden amber in color with a large white head. The head had good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was mostly hops (grapefruit) with a little malt in the backround. The taste was very good, cirus hops with a malt backround and a bitter finish. It is medium bodied and medium in carbonation. While the beer is bitter, it is not overly so, making it a very drinkable beer.

The head is outstanding, Big Bubbles cling to the side of the glass as I drink, three fingers thick head white color and a rocky crust on top. I have no Idea why I am so stingy with the 5's, but no here.  The Smell is Big beer hops, Grapefruit IPA.  The taste is not quite the same. Yes big delicious hopy but not like your typical DIPA, More like stone's IPA, Excellent balance of Big hops and rich malt.  Mouthfeel is great but not best.  Drinkability in tops I would buy this two, What a great brewer. This beer is big on taste, smooth, thick, just a perfect combination to make the beer work right. Prost und Zoom Wahl!

287,1093,burnstar,4.57,"Pours slightly cloudy and golden with a big rocky white head that persists for quite some time. Aroma is citrusy hops, lemons, there is definitely some noticable sweetness present as well, a bit of sweet oranges, very enticing. Taste is sweet malt combined with citrusy and herbal hops- nicely balanced and similar to the smell. It finishes with a pleasing lingering hop bitterness and a distinct biscuity flavor. Mouthfeel medium and moderately carbonated- just about right for this. This stuff is very drinkable. Tastey and so nicely balanced (for an IPA) there's nothing to get tired of. In fact, I'm going to get another right now.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Blakaeris,4.12,"Pours cloudy deep orange in color. Head is quite boistrous initially, but tames down to become a thin sheen with sheets of intricate lacing.  Smell is juicy hop fruitiness. Excellent caramel malt backbone. Mildly piney.  Taste is similiar to the nose with sweet fruitness up front. Strong malt and massive hop attack perform a delicate balancing act. Definite piney character. Finish is quite bitter with lingering floral hop notes.  Mouthfeel is medium-full with generous hop oiliness.  A very tasty treat for a hophead. Flavor is aggressive but balanced. Initially very fruity, but becomes more piney as it warms. Recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Mechphisto,3.35,"A: A bright golden color. See through, rich amber. The head was surprisingly thick and solid. Biteable even. Leaves a very nice lacing.  S: Slightly fruity smell, but just slightly. Nice.  T: When cold, it has that crisp bitterness that masks any subtlety. It has an odd, fishy aftertaste that reminds me of lake water... but that's probably because of the bottle label. Unfortunately as it warms up it gets noticeably sour. Like warm, old orange juice. (personal experience. Don't ask.)  M: Crisp, significant carbonation. A slight greasy feel that goes away quickly.  Not bad. No danger of it becoming my favorite beer, but certainly wouldn't turn one down if offered. I like it better cold, unlike most darker beers, and ales in general for that matter. Cold and out of the bottle instead of in a glass, it's actually very good. And for that I bump drinkability from 3.5 to 4.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A: The beer is a light gold with a foamy, off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: Heavy aroma of hops & citrus (orange, grapefruit & tangerine mostly), very pleasant.  T: Excellently balanced combination of hops bitterness and sweet citrus malt flavors. The two flavors dont battle each other as they do in some beers; rather they blend together even into the after taste.  M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation and a very clean finish.  D: This beer is very tasty, goes down very easily, doesnt fill you much and is one of those beers where each sip makes you crave the next more and more.

287,1093,Generik420,4.43,"Tried this for the first time on tap this weekend. Wow! Very good beer for the hophead. Pours a very clear yellow with a nice white head. Very strong hop aroma is one of the first things noticeable. The flavor is full of hops as can be expected, and I found citrusy overtones in the hop flavor, a nice blend of bitterness to round out the flavor. The beer has a medium body, so you could definitely drink a few of these without feeling ""full"". If you like a high hopped ale, this is very drinkable. I had two, and found by the end of the second one, I was starting to reach my limit on that particular hop flavor. So, it seems to me that it would be great in moderation, but not something I could drink all night long.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Naerhu,4.77,"Thanks to Panichi for bringing this beer all the way to Japan.  A - Hazy light yellow body with extremely thick creamy head and thck lacying. S - Extra fruit aroma of sweet apricot, pineapple and of course oranges. T - fine balance of bitterness, fine lightly sweet malt, the flavors really go on rampage on the back of my palate. M - Very light carbonation. Stunningly vibrant. D - If they had this on tap in prison, I would say please lock me up!

Good head retension, the head stays for a bit before it departs. Then the beer looks flat. Good color and a little hazy.  The smell is delicious! Like taking a walk down hop street. Good garden fresh floral hop smell.  Taste is great! Tons of flavor. Hops, citrus, good good stuff. A tad too sweet for me. I might suspect after a few this might sit heavy in the stomach, needs to be more dry.  My new favorite IPA? A IPA that relies on taste, not bitterness, that will always empty my wallet if I see it on the shelves.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,scoobybrew,4.87,"This beer was poured into a standard pint glass. The color is dark golden with a thick head that has excellent retention. It has a wonderful hop aroma with malt in the background. Upon tasting, it has a nice full hop flavor with traces of pale malt. There is some hint of subdued fruitiness from the yeast (almost imperceptible). The hop finish is very tasty. It has a medium body with moderate carbonation.  What can I say? I had this from the cask at Bell's recently and thought having it from the bottle for the first time in a long time was going to be a let down...it wasn't. This is probably one of my favorite commercial beers and probably will remain so for some time. This one is a must for hop lovers. The full hop flavor is just right in my opinion, nice and strong without being over-the-top.  9/3/07 - I revisited my original scoring almost a year later while enjoying yet another. After numerous American IPA tastings, this beer remains one of my top 3 for the style, if not my personal favorite - such a great beer.

The beer itself is a murky burnt orange...which shows streams of carbonation rising to the top.  Smell: One thing I look for in an IPA is a ""fresh"" scent and this beer nails it. The scent is citrusy...leaning towards oranges. In addition, american hops which smell a bit resiny are present. The hops clearly are American. This is an invigorating scent.  Tastes: The upfront malts are gentle, sweet, and meld right into the zesty floral hop finish. The finish is raw....like right from the garden. it hits with a damn good punch and it lingers.

It has a nice bronze color with a lot of carbonation that continues to bubble throughout your consumption.  S- Quite a beautiful scent. Lots of hops and hints of Citrus.  T- This IPA tastes great. You get all the hops and citrus flavors without much of the bitterness that seems to be associated with a lot of other IPA's I've tried.  M- Two Hearted Ale is really smooth on the palete. It lacks the acidic aftertaste that I have associated with other IPA's that I have recently tried.

287,1093,diamondc,4.15,"I'm going to be honest. All I drank before discovering this beaut was the standard mass market brews, with an occasional bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale. Nothing prepared me for my first IPA. On a recent trip to Chicago with a beer loving buddy, he recommended this to me to go along with deep dish pizza we were clamoring for.  Appearance = nice amber color, nothing out of the ordinary.  Smell = Mmm citrusy! Grapefruit and oranges.  Taste = A knockout! The malt and hops were in perfect combination, with the hops of course being a bit of an edge. Grapefuit and pine come to mind.  Mouthfeel = Being a newbie to IPA's, I was a big overwhelmed. And only had two bottles for the night..  Drinkability = Excellent!

Complimented with citrus flavors, the taste is suberbly balanced.  M: Full-bodied for the style with crisp, moderate carbonation. Finishes very dry.  D: Definitely one of the best in the style.

The smell is hoppy and nutty but the floral hops didn't hit me like I was expecting. There is a spicy hoppy taste that leaves a clove and burnt coffee flavor with a lemony aftertaste.

Have also had this ale on tap at their brew pub, and it was equally good.  I was surprised to pay $2/case more at the company store than at Russo's, an aggressive beer/wine retailer in Grand Rapids.

287,1093,nicksta,3.82,"If I drink this beer cold, straight out of the fridge, I enjoy it a lot more.  A: The beer pours a really nice cloudy orange. It has some really nice lacing and the thick head dies after an average lifespan.  S: When the beer is cold enough I can pick up on big citrus notes and even some banana. And, as the back label said, there is a really big floral hop aroma, I mean huge. It still very pleasent.  T: It is very spicy and oily. I can also taste some pair towards the end of a sip. The only other AIPA was really bitter throughout an entire drink. It was too much for me. This one finishes with a taste that is really dry hopppy, and bitter. It is almost like hard liquor. When the beer is really cold, this finishing taste is more of a background taste, not only tolerable, but good. When the beer warms up, it is too upfront and just too much for me.  M: It is smooth and a little thick, very nice.  D: If cold, the beer is an excellent session beer, but if warm, the spicy bittnerness will lower the drinkability.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,xtremejammn,3.26,"This is some good stuff, I think Bell's did well on this one.  A: Beautiful pure copper color with a remarkably long lasting head.  S: Has a strong hop pressence, and smells of an orange peel.  T: As I have made mention before, I'm not a big fan of pale ales, but this is one hell of a pale ale, very strong hop pressence, slight spicy-ness to it, tastes of an orange peel and has a weak graniness to it, with a pleasent bitterness to it to finish it off.  M: On the downside it's very bubbly, but it's not quite TOO bubbly.  D: Goes down smooth, and leaves a pleasenet aftertaste after a drink. And although it's a little acidy it's drinkable.

Had a very hoppy smell to it.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Had an average body with a creaminess to it. You can taste the hops in there for sure. I'm not sure of what it tasted like but it had a weird aftertaste to me. Not bad just weird. Dry bitter finish.  In my small town in northern lower MI I had few choices.

287,1093,demcorhip,3.99,"Much thanks to Raider for this one.  Appearance Orange-amber, with almost hidden hints of green in colour. Thin white head formed during the pour, and faded away during inspection. Scant lacings remained. Slight cloudiness was increased due to condensation on the glass.   Aroma Sweet floral citrus and honey notes, accentuated with pine. Reminescent of orange marmalade, fresh flowers, and the boreal forest. Impressive.   Taste Not as hoppy as other IPAs tasted. Initial clean malt flavours of sweet buttery toffee shifted to the more bitter piney notes from the hops. Almost too well balanced(?) for an IPA. Hoppiness quickly tamed by the sweetness of the malt, and other more aggressive (hoppy) versions of the style leave me wanting more. The finish returns to where it all started, back to the sweetness of the malt, only slightly dimished by the hops.   Drinkability Almost syrupy in substance, as i was emptying my glass i felt like a kid drinking soda pop. The fine carbonation, along with the sweet and syrupy malts contributing to this near flashback. The hops almost manage to cut through the malts, but dont quite succeed. Would be difficult to drink more than two in one sitting because of its cloying mouthfeel.  Overall As stated earlier the balance favours the malts too much for my liking and personal interpretation of this style. The promises of the aroma were not realized upon drinking this beer. This would be an excellent IPA to try while working on one's tolerance for bolder and hoppier beers, of which there are plenty. Definately worth a try, i was impressed by its aroma, and it may suit your fancy more than mine. Really makes me want their double IPA though, can see how it may more fully realize my ideal, only needing more ETOH and hops to round out the malt.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Phyl21ca,3.95,Bottle courtesy of Daalamar: Poured a light orangey color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention. Aroma of floral hops is quiet enticing with a great semi-sweet malt base. Taste of crisp and citrus hops are well mixed with a nice solid sweet malt based. Carbonation is lively and body is about average.

287,1093,thelagerheads,2.46,"Henceforth I'm going to call this beer Fishbine. Not because it tastes like fish but because even the fish on the label ain't biii-ne into the hype of the Two Hearted Ale by Bell's. Bell's makes great beer but they also make craft beers and in doing so there are always extremes. Much more brusk than the aftertaste of Oberon, this beer has a citrus bite that rivals the pungent meat of the rind. It literally is rind beer. I know that it is lauded as a summertime delicacy but it is more like drinking the broth of a lemorange peel that sat out in the sun too long and then was chilled.

287,1093,expatsteve,4.47,"On cask at Wonder's Pub. I first had this on tap at the Arbor Brewing Company in Ann Arbor and was blown away by the hops and the depth of flavor. The tap carbonation definitely made for a more assertive ale, which I nonetheless enjoyed immensely. That said, I enjoy this on cask a lot more.  Appearance: Amber with copper hints. 1/2 inch head lingers for several minutes. Medium visibility, with medium/low viscosity. Thick stick lacing on the sides of glass.  Aroma: Grapefruit, heavy honey and orange notes. Refreshing and balanced.  Taste: Despite the hops, this is well balanced. Nice bold grapefruit and anise up front, with a caramel malt and sweet citrus back palate. Yeasty finish, with gradually developing bitter aftertaste that nonehtless remains refreshing.  Mouthfeel: Cask conditioning definitely helps bring out the flavors and renders a smooth mouthfeel. Allows room for both mellow malts and floral hops.  Drinkability: Truly sessionable despite bold flavor.

Malt aromas are present but quickly fade due to the hop aromas. Something seems off in the flavor. I think it is too unbalanced. Yes, it is supposed to heavy on the hop side but its kind of harsh. I think it just needs a bigger malt presence. The hop amounts are fine, as is their flavor, its just a weak malt presence. It is still a good and quality made beer just unbalanced IMHO.

Nose is ...oh man ... hops are superbly aggressive here. Citrus, piney, and ever so slightly sweet. Can they bottle this aroma and sell it in a spray like Febreze? One of the best smelling beers I've enjoyed in a long while. Palate is a hop paradise ... pine and citrus combine with an incredible sweetness and texture that almost brings a tear to the eye. This may well be the best balanced AIPA I've ever had ... could the hop/malt ratio be better? Doubt it. Mouthfeel is soft, thick, and luxurious. Medium bodied. Lingering sweetness and absolutely amazing hop tastes linger in the mouth long after each sip. Where do I begin with one ... you simply must have Bell's Two Hearted. I don't know why it's called Two Hearted and I don't know why there is a fish on the label, but I do know it's the best AIPA I've ever had the pleasure of consuming ... and one of the overall best beers made in the USA.

Palate is a pleasing blend of light, slightly sweet malt and assertive, floral hops. Notes of light citrus, grass, and a fleeting hint of smoke are detectable.

Delicious and malty, the hops creep up and add a significant amount of bitterness to this brew, without disturbing the balance. I could even detect some fruit flavoring...peaches and grapefruit.

The bitterness hits up front and rides a wave out as hits of orange and lemon with just a hint of malt... the hops seem citrusy with just a hint of flower in the nose. It finishes clean and dry, with a touch of sweetness that's canceled out. It's remarkably refreshing, and easy drinking.  No west coast hop bomb here, the body is light, and while there's some crisp carbonation the mouth is mainly smooth as silk.  I could, and feel the desire to, drink this all night long. There's not much more to an IPA I would want than this. Stone IPA has always been my stand-out favorite, even with such luminary brews as HopDevil and 60 Min. readily available... it's got competition now.  A pantheon level brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Phatz,4.69,"This beer is beautifully crafted to be one of the most tasty easy drinking IPAs I have had to date. Thanks to 'YBSober' for this beer.  Appearance: Pours a magnificent orange peach color with a huge head that lasts and lasts. Then heavy sheets of lacing decorate the glass.  Smell: Tons of fresh orange rinds. I cracked open the bottle and even before I poured the beer my wife asked (from across the room) ""Is that an orange beer?"" It is that bold in the initial orange citrus aroma. It settles to a perfect level of citric orange rind and sweet toasted malt.  Taste: If you have ever juiced your own oranges in a juicer you can peel off the top orange layer and leave the white rinds on the orange that you juice. It makes a more bold tart tasty fresh orange juice. This beer reminded me of that juice I used to make. My juicer is still in the attic from when we moved. I think it will stay there and I will get more of this Two Hearted Ale. Wow!  Mouthfeel: So remarkably smooth. A bit juicy with just a bit of a hop nibble keeping the medium/light body interesting.  Drinkability: Now that I have met this beer, buy stock in Bell's Brewery because I am on a quest for cases. I could drink this all day everyday. It really hits the spot and is remarkably easy to drink!  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jlannon,4.8,"Damn the three-tiered distribution system! Years spent on the East Coast comparing West Coast v. East Coast IPAs can leave one oblivious to the delicious IPA offerings of the Midwest. While not as over-the-top as Three Floyd's Dreadnaught, Bell's Two Hearted Ale may just represent the perfectly balanced IPA. Pours a lovely, light copper-orange with a substantial and unyielding head. The aroma offers the first hints of conversion. Sublime intimations of citrus, from sweet orange to grapefruit to kaffir lime. A succulent, fruit sweetness lurks beneath the citrus. A hint of pininess, but not too much. All of this underscored by a delicate floral quality. Beautifully balanced. The palate is more of the same. Good carbonation. Pleasant, floral, citrusy bitterness all the way through. Although the malt takes a backseat here, the beer has a very pleasant pale maltiness. A slightly bitter, floral finish. The overall effect is borderline narcotic. This is the perfect midwestern IPA. An excellent choice for anytime and/or occasion.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

To my suprise, when they arived back in town they had a 6 pack of this and a 6 pack of Lake Superior Special Ale... Go mom!  This one pours a clear golden orange. A small white head gives off some decent lacing. Smells citrussy orange and a bit hoppy. Tastes of good toasted malt and citrussy orange hops. I like the orange flavor so much more than some of the IPA's with a strong grapefruit taste. Good flavor. This one is a good, malty, medium bodied brew. A nice ammount of carbonation. Bitterness on the back of the tounge. The flavor dristributes well throughout the palate. This is a good drinkable beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,AltBock,4.35,"12oz. bottle with a label with a close up picture of a trout or some other trout like looking fish swimming up stream. The label looks like something that should have or was appeared on the cover of the fishing magazine Field and Stream. The back label has some information about the beer on the top, the Govt. warning in the middle, and a bin number at the bottom. Mine being 7252. I've had this beer a while in my possession and I finally get to drink it. It's a good thing that the beer itself is nothing like the label!  Appearance: When poured into a mug, the beer was a nice IPA color of copper/orange with a nice 1 inch head of white sticky foam. It had good retention leaving behind very a small amount of white rings and just a little sticky white lace around the mug.  Smell: They said on the back of the bottle was that it had ""an incredibly floral hop aroma."" Where I ask? It doesn't matter, but what I got instead was a nice aroma of piny hops, just a hint of citrus fruits, and a something else in the background that I just put my finger on. I know it's not the floral hops.  Taste: The best way I can describe the taste is that every flavor doesn't come separately, it came to me in one big flavor. What was in this jumble was the flavors of piny hops, citrus fruits, a trace of juicy fruits, and even some toasted malt was in here. Great Taste! Never had an IPA where all the flavors came to me all at once.  Mouthfeel: It was medium bodied, carbonated, very crisp, and with a nice piny hops aftertaste.  Drinkability: Although I only got a single of this, I wish I have gotten a six pack of this. An excellent beer that I'm glad I tried and will try again! A must IPA beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Pine and citrus are dominant. The taste follows in the same direction. Very earthy with pine, citrus and some light, biscuity malts in there as well.

Smell is of, no surprise, hops but with a nice biscuit-like malt balancing it out a bit. Lots of citrus and floral scents. Taste follows suit with the wonderful flavors and bitterness that are bold but do not overpower and shut out the moderate-light bready malt. It has a medium-long finish that is fairly sweet with a lingering dryness. It has a medium body, lightly oily texture, and moderate carbonation.

Pours with a beautiful creamy golden tinged white head. Lacing is excellent, head retention is also superb. One great looking beer.  The nose of this beer is quite appetizing. Big floral and citrus aroma. Hops dominate the aroma of this beer as is appropriate for this style.  Hop influence is apparent in this beer. Quite a bitter brew, very appropriate stylistically. Floral (and some citrus) characteristics are the backbone of this beer's flavor profile. The hop character is pronounced, don't get me wrong, but I would like to see a bit more hop flavor, I think that some stronger hop flavor might just add to this brew, or maybe my palate is off today. Aftertaste is dry, floral hops that linger in the mouth  Mouthfeel of this beer is also great, medium bodied with a dry finish that leaves you begging for more. Low carbonation, just enough to playfully dance the tongue and give rise to the realization that this is a carbonated beverage. This beer is a sipper, don't try to drain this quickly, what would be the good in that? As with all great beers it needs to be appreciated. Don't gulp this one down, sit, realx and enjoy the flavor of this great IPA. Definitely worth the money, will be buying this one again.

Upon first smelling it, your nose is overwhelmed with the scent of fresh, crisp hops. And that is pretty much how it tastes, very clean and jumping with fresh hop flavor. It is not one of the strongest IPA's when it comes to hops, and that's a good thing. There is a nice balance between the malts and the bittering and finishing hops.

The flavor is all hops, kind of one-dimensional. I didn't find this near as good as Stone or Dogfishhead. It seems over-hyped on BA to me... I had it a few times last year and never rated it. I remembered not being overly impressed, but decided to try it one more time when I saw it was ranked #35 on BA.

If your wife wants flowers get her a dozen of these. She won't be disappointed, unless she's a an incurable sentimentalist.  It has the full hop profile of something with a constant hop addition but it is still pretty clean. Sweet, fruity, floral nose. Great citrus, malt, floral and bitter note interplay in the flavor. A very interesting and satisfying beer.  Personally, I have never thought that an IPA could or should be balanced, but if any IPA is balanced then this is it. It has great full-spectrum bitterness akin to Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, but the way everything comes together here is just a bit more drinkable.

The hop aroma was very fruity with only a hint of pine. Two Hearted's taste is a burst of citrus hops that left me with a strange hint of pineapple. The mouthfeel was medium in body, and I swore I could almost feel the hops swishing between my teeth (not literally).

T: Well done hop flavors, slightly bitter. Tart citrus and floral notes that are offset by biscuity, sweet bread malts. The fresh hop flavors really win out here; however, the brew is balanced nicely. Some slight grass and herbal notes also. MF: Slightly chewy and medium-light that finishes dry.

I am not an avid IPA drinker but this one is tops in my book. A full body of flavors and characters revisiting the smells. I didn't like the overpowering carbonated feel, taking away from the mouthfeel and overall drinkability. I would recommend this brew to all IPA fans, this brew is better than most IPAs.

Small hint of bready, caramelly malt.  Taste - exactly like the smell. Pine, resin, wood, earth, citrus, grapefruit, lemons, counterbalanced with bread and caramel. Then lemony, citrusy, with tea-like and bready caramel finish and aftertaste of the same. Hops are aggressively dominant here, and malt barely hangs in there, but bravely so. This is deliciously bitter, done in AIPA mode.  Mouthfeel -full, smooth, a little chewy, some good hop oil slickness. Pleasantly drying, pleasantly bitter.

A tonne of carbonation is visible in the ber and the head stays around as long as the beer does. The smell is extremely hoppy and floral with a noticeable pine dominance.  The taste on this is a textbook American style IPA, it's all about the hops, which sets up shop on the back of the tongue and relents for a moment only to show up at the front of the tongue and on the top of the mouth. Floral is dominant, but some citrus is also present. A good malty aspect to it as well, with solid hop bittering sensations and overall very drinkable beer.

287,1093,sinistrsam,4.59,"This has been on my must-review list for some time. I finally picked up a bottle at Fathead's in the southside of Pittsburgh. It poured a pale gold, somewhere between hazy and clear. Not mirky but not transparent. Interesting. It had a foamy white head and left some of the most impressive lacing about the glass I've seen in an American micro. It lasted 'til the beer was gone. Lovely aroma; hoppy but it wasn't that kick-in-the-face bitter hoppiness. More of a pleasant bouquet. You could almost taste a sweetness to the beer just by smelling it. Also a dry or wheaty smell comes through. Not much malt presence. There is a complexity to this beer I rarely find. It was hoppy, yes, but damn it was so much more. Look past the hops (if you can) and you discovera world of subtelty; vanilla, sweet fruits, possible roasted malts? Theres more here than meets the eye. The feel was much of the same; exquisite. A smoothness rarely found with an IPA. It wasn't harsh at all, but not weak. It was semi-full-bodied, but more smooth and creamy. The bittersweet hoppiness fades into a smooth creaminess then into an almost buttery aftertaste that lingers the whole sitting. I'm going out on a limb and saying this might be the top two or three most drinkable IPAs I've ever had. And this is definitely an IPA for people who can't tolerate the bitter hop assault of ""normal"" IPAs or doubles IPAs. Hats off, Bell's. This is truly a wonderfully crafted, nearly perfectly balanced beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jokelahoma,4.55,"Lovely burnished bronze color in the glass. Just a hint of chill haze, but perfectly acceptable. Head fell quickly, but enough stuck around for the trip through the beer to let me know it was there.  The aroma... wow! Face full o' hops. Very, very nice dry hop aroma. One has to assume they dry hop this ale. That's too much grassy, citrusy goodness to get just from late addition aroma hopping. And what an aroma it is. As the beer warms, a trace of malt comes through. Or maybe it's just that your nose is so hopped out by that point, it's dying to smell anything except the hops. Whatever it is, it's good. Really good.  Oh, the sweet bitterness. The hops attack you right up front. But wait.. what's this? There's a big amount of sweetness here too. This isn't just hop juice. This is a truly well crafted IPA. Big hop nose, bitterness right in your face, yet a big enough malt flavor to counter all of that. And it's a clean malt flavor, to boot. A touch of caramel, but mostly just plain old pale malt. Very smooth, and considering the aroma, extremely well balanced. Just a slight hint of warmth at the end of the sip, which I would think would be from something other than the alcohol, since 6.0% ABV isn't that high. This is very, very well made.  The mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy, almost stout-like. Not heavy, not chewy... full, without really being a full-bodied beer. Quite interesting. Almost the beer version of a David Blaine illusion. Is it, or isn't it? In the end, it's just about what it ought to be, but it takes a rather raoundabout way to get you there.  This is quite the drinkable IPA, to say the least. Balanced, in spite of the aroma, hearty without being overwhelming, creamy without being chewy... I imagine a beer could be better put together than this, but it would take a damn good effort. Extremely well done.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,PeatReek,4.37,"This bottle came to me via parental roadtrip; I gotta admit it's an old favorite, but I'll try to review objectively. Ish. The pour is a crystal clear straw color, yellow with just a tinge of orange. Head is thick and a bit yellowish with thick lacing on the glass. Huge centennial aroma! By which I mean, hints of lemon and deep, dark pine. Taste is a centennial assault; big and orangey, lemony, again with a huge pine backup. The hop flavor tastes thick though the body is clean and crisp. Just a tinge of sweetness in the aftertaste, matched by a stiff bitterness that contributes to the ""clean"" feeling. Carbonation is actually a little low if anything - I could use a bit more fizz on the tongue to complement the stiff hop punch, but it's oh so drinkable as is. Glad I have 5 more of these.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Retreats to a ring as the drink goes down, leaves just a little lacing.  S - great aroma on this one. Soft, floral. Really, like sticking your nose into a magnolia flower or something, sweet. Not getting much citrus, but all sorts of fresh, sweet fruit.  T - unique, tasty beer. Floral hop flavor equisitely balanced against toasty, caramel fresh, soft malt flavor. Can't say enough good things about how well this beer is crafted and balanced. Sweet, tangy hop flavor, assertive, but not over-the-top bitterness set up against a soft, toasty bread backbone.

Too bad I only bought one bottle",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Ego,3.48,"many thanks to my ba bud epseja for hookin a brotha up!  eyes... 3 fingers of large bubble head, billowing up and receding at a decent pace, golden amber in hue, lots of small bubble carbonation replenishes the head really well.. actually transforming the initial big bubble mattress with a more packed fine layer of small bubbles. good cling for a straight up AIPA. the head has been sticking around one full finger for 5 minutes now... damn.  nose... earthy citric (orange) twang with a hint of lemon bite, hop freshness is nice, clean like spiced bath water, slight toasted caramel is lurking beneath the immediate hop hit.  taste etc... interestingly enough the carbonation is very underwhelming... to a detriment imo, this makes this a little too syrupy carrying those hop oils across the mouth, a nice bitterness is balanced by orange sweetness which really balances out the flavor here, the flavor is nice, but something about it is bothering me... on some sips I am getting an almost too sweet sensation. maybe it is the type of hop that isn't working for me... it isn't bad perse but not for me personally.  verdict? definitely different than a lot of american IPAs... great looking brew and nice smelling as well.. but it didn't work for me personally. I wouldn't turn it down but I won't go crazy looking for it in the future. The ABV does give a slight warming sensation as well...even though it is only 6%.  bottle code: 7245",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,nickg902,4.94,"A: Pours a hazy amber/orange color, small white head, small amounts of lacing  S: Aroma is of floral hops and a bit citrusy, perhaps a hint of alcohol  T: Exceptional. The first taste is of citrus fruits (hint of grapefruit and orange), mild yet recognizable, perfectly balanced with the hops that follow. The beer is balanced by the hoppy aftertaste, and is not overpowering.  M: Smooth, med-low carbonation  D: Easily one of the most drinkable IPAs I've had. Would definitely be able to have more than one in a sitting.  This IPA jumped high up my list and is a definite buy for anyone, not just IPA fans. I plan on getting a case soon.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,grub,4.82,"pours a pale yellow colour with about a half inch of white head. this slowly dissipates into a ring of lace around the glass.  aroma is all hops. fresh floral scent, with a hint of grapefruit.  taste is a blast of hops, followed by a punch of bitterness. much like the aroma it's fresh and floral, with just a hint of grapefruit. alcohol isn't noticeable at all, and the malt is hidden under the hops. hops are strong, but not over-the-top either.  mouthfeel is good. it's not heavy at all and if i had easy access it could certainly be a daily drinker.  overall it's a great beer, and another winner from bell's. definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys a nice hoppy american ipa.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Cresant,4.72,"Poured this 12 oz. into a Stone IPA flute/pils glass. No freshness date, but an inkjet #7327. The body was a cloudy amber/orange and the head rose to about two inches but dwindled to slight lacing. (I'm still perfecting a vigorous pour).  Smelled of apple candy and bread. A sour dish-cloth wiff appeared and faded quickly.  The taste was magnificent. Complex, first tart, then sweet, then bitter, then balanced. Cascades of different tastes kept this one very interesting. Grapefruits and creamy butterscotch alternated back and forth. The flavors seemed to meld and mellow as it warmed. A fine interplay of bitter hops and sweet malts.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied with low carbonation--pleasantly moderate.  I will definitely return to this AIPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,evanackerman,4.9,"can't beleive i haven't reviewed this one yet, it has been a favorite for a long time now.  This beer pours a beautiful gold with a tinge of orange and a huge pillowy head that lasts all throughout consumption and leaves wispy lacing on the glass.  The aroma of this beer is incredible. Fresh baked bread and herbal hops to the extreme, i almost like the aroma of this more than the taste, except that the taste is also awesome.  taste is a lovely balance of bready malt and floral hops with a touch of fruity hoppiness but not the grapefruit bomb that dominates many American IPAs, the finish is long and pleasant dominated by bittering hops.  mouthfeel is also excellent in this brew, very creamy with just the right carbonation.  this beer is also very drinkable, if i had to drink one beer all day this would be close to the top of my list. Also great for cooking!  Overall, this is a fantastic beer, by far my favorite IPA and, in my opinion, Bell's finest and most consistent beer. a true winner here, please try this if possible.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,dfried,5,"I am sorry about my rating, but I just had to. This is one of my favorite beers of all time. We are starting to see this on tap at more and more places in Minneapolis, and not just dank beer bars anymore, so I have been drinking more and more of it, and boy, it just keeps getting better. The way Guiness defines stout, and Sierra Nevada defines pale ale, I feel that two hearted ale defines IPA. It pours the same amber color of most PA's, with a slight head that has great retention and provides lacing to the last sip. The aroma is where you find out it is IPA, not a PA, with a complex, hoppy smell. The taste follows up on the smell, an array of hops from piney to fruity to citrusy, that all blend together, with the dry-apple flavor following shortly. This is at the top of my deserted island beers. Good for one or two, or great for the whole evening.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Pine and citrus up front with a caramel and fair amount of biscuit in the background. Citrus, pine, and a lemony finish with a nice balance of biscuity flavors noticed with each sip. Higher on the carbonation scale and a medium body makes the one pretty nice to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,SethB2,4.3,"Pours a golden yellow, non transparent color with a fluffy white head that leave quite a bit of lacing. This doesn't look like your typical IPA. It is a little lighter. The smell, however, smells like an IPA. Sweet grapefruit hoppiness dominates the smell. Taste is also great. The hops hit up front, but are followed by a toasted malt quality and a slight amount of sweetness. Finish is bitter and refreshing. Mouthfeel is medum and a bit dry. Drinkablity is very good. I would love to have access to this beer in the west coast. Easily competes with most IPAs I have sampled to date. Very well done.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,trep,4.72,"The revered Two-Hearted ale, mm, finally. High expectations coming into this, I hope it lives up to the hype.  Pours from the 12 oz bottle a cloudy, translucent orange. Frothy white head adorns the top like a crown.  Smells of citrus and flowery hops, piney, smells juicy. Me likey.  The thing I like about this beer is the way the hops and malt and body seem to be one and all. A perfectly balanced beer to me. Hops aren't too dominant, although they are very present. Malt is there, again, not too sweet. I love this stuff.  I could easily put down a 6 pack of this stuff. Truely magnificent drinkability for an IPA, and incredibly balanced. One of my new favorite beers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,belgaridub,3.95,"Beer pours a light golden color with a pale off-white head. Head has good retention and leaves some lacing.  Smells does not jump out at me, but with my nose up close the main thing I smell are hops. Possibly also a resiny character in the nose as well.  Taste definitely showcases the dominant hops in this beer. And what hops they are! The resiny taste also is in the background along with a light citrus that does a good job of working with the hops. The taste in this beer is just a great mouthfull of hoppiness yet still manages to not be overwhelming thanks to the citrus flavors and simply being a well made beer.  Very little carbonation in this beer. The mouthfeel seems pretty unexceptional it's pretty smooth with a medium body.  Overall, this beer showcases the powerful hops of an American IPA well. Great example of the style and a wonderful beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,shbobdb,4.08,"I am conviced that, had the oils from my moustache not come in contact with this beer's fluffy head it would have lasted forever. In fact, despite the best efforts of my anachronistic fashion-statement, the head persisted for quite some time.  As for the beer itself? To be, Bell's Two-Hearted Ale is the archetypical IPA. It is everything an American IPA should be, and nothing that they oughn't be.  Here is a story: After I came back from living in Germany, I set out to convert my mother from her BMC-ways. At first, I tried the classic Weizen approach. It worked all right, I mean, she thought they were better than BMC and would even buy 12ers of Hacker-Pshorr (one step at a time people, OK?). But, she still wasn't what I would call a 'craft beer lover'. Then, one day, at a restaraunt, she tried my Bell's Two Hearted -- instantly she was hooked. The HOPS! That is what she was missing, what she was needing in her beer! It was a glorious moment!  But, like most archetypical beers, ya can't really say there is anything too special about this beer. To me, it is the benchmark of the IPA style, the beer by which all other IPAS shall be measured. It's good. But let's not get carried away singing its praises. Oh, wait, let's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Sweet but balanced by lemon, grapefruit and herbal notes that linger long on the palate. Tastes like orange candy with a finishing hop bite!

287,1093,hoffman,4.19,Supplied to me by Fugazme. Poured from bottle into pint glass. Vigor is needed to induce head. White froth does stick around a while with some spotty lacing down the glass. The color is a thin hazy gold. The smell is robust predominately citrus and hop. A very pleasant boquet. The taste is quite nice as well. A smooth tangy citrus in front balanced by a nice tart malt in the middle and some dry hop bitterness in the finish. Pretty pleasing actually. This beer screams SESSIONABLE when you sip it. I wish I could get my hands on it more easily I would make this one a mainstay in my cooler. The mouthfeel is a bit weak and somewhat overcarbonated. But oh so drinkable...almost too easy.

287,1093,biergeniesser,3.9,"This 12 oz brown bottle of Bells Two Hearted Ale poured a rich gold to light orange in color. It had a slight haze, likely due to the sediment from bottle conditioning and/or the incredible amount of hops that must have been used to brew this fine ale. Tiny bubbles evolve rapidly from the bottom of the glass, continuously replenishing the thin white persistent head.  The Aroma of Two Hearted Ale is definitely dominated by the hops, so much so that upon pouring it in the glass, hop aroma is evident from about 3 feet away! Resiny, floral and citrusy with hints of pineapple, the hop bouquet is pleasing.  Two Hearted Ale has a complex flavor as well. As with the aroma, the flavor is dominated by the hops. Hop bitterness was assertive, but pleasant. Hop flavor was citrusy and crisp with hints of grapefruit. Malt flavors were difficult to pick out through the hops, but a slight sweet malt and caramel malt character were in the background.  Two Hearted is medium bodied and has a strong carbon dioxide bite, it has a nice mouth coat and finishes sweet.  All in all Two Hearted is a great beer, especially if you love hops!

The folks with glasses held a trablucent amber (not red) brew with a nice white head. Some metallic taste/smell overtones fade after a couple swallows. Maybe because I drank from the bottles? This is a fine hoppy beer, with a pleasant, lightly sweet, malt backbone. Did I mention hoppy? These would be those citrusy American hops.

The head is a tight egg white foam peppered with larger bubbles. it stands about a finger and quickly comes down to a solid lace. The beer is a hazy honey color.  S- Honey sweet with some notes of citrus hops underneath. The combo comes off as a bit strawberry.  T- This is what an IPA is all about! Sweet bitter hops kick with a grapefruit finish. mixes in those honey notes, Malt comes through a bit as it warms in your mouth. Everything is well balanced  M- Very smooth start and the bitter creeps its way down your throat. Perfect carbonation, it tickles, there is some substance to it, it wants to linger but doesn't over stay it's welcome. The after taste floats in the mouth instead of laying down on the tongue.  D- Very drinkable. One makes me want another. This will be great for out on the deck on a hot summer night.

The smell is hoppy and spicy with big notes of citrus fruit..grapefruit.  The initial taste is just like the smell(:^) ...a very nice grapefruit bitter bite but there's enough of a fairly sweet malt character there as well to balance things out. Yum. And, at only 6%abv, I just want to drink another and another....  Bottom line: Super good American IPA that I find to be one of the most drinkable in its style. Highly recommended!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,EPseja,4.87,"Thanks to my dad for calling in from his business trip in Illinois to see if there was any beer I would like him to bring home for me. How great is that?  Served from a 12 oz. bottle in a pint glass at just below cellar temperature.  A - Pours with a glowing light gold color and a very slight haze. An off-white one inch head adorns the surface of the beer; creamy and marshmallowy with the tiniest of bubbles. Lacing begins the moment the head touches the glass, creating snowdrift-like curves as the head slowly recedes to a thin wisp on the surface. As the glass is drained intricate, lacy, peekaboo-sheers appear all the way down the glass. If only the head would have held, it would have been perfection. Very very nice.  S - Loud and fragrant with citrus and and floral flourishes. Light and sweet, with touches of honey and lavender. Some spicy notes as the beer warms. Alcohol is apparent, but way in the background, underneath the mild maltiness. Upon warming, an intriguing scent of latex paint esthers becomes noticeable, but somehow it compliments the rest of the nose.  T - Sweet with the taste of light malts and Bazooka bubblegum up front. In the middle comes more florals and honey, along with more toasted malts. The end lets both the floral and bitter hops shine through, each in a quantity that allows neither quality to be overshadowed. The aftertaste is crisp, bitter and refreshing.  M - Excellent progression of texture as it goes from smooth and slick to tingly and creamy. Washes down the throat in a way that lets every cell get a little hit of the hops.  D - As with all highly rated beers I taste, I do my best *not* to get caught up in the hoopla and be extremely objective. However, no amount of skew on objectivity can deny a beer its kudos when it is so obviously well deserving. Two Hearted Ale is a joy to look at, to smell, to drink and to savor.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,PorterLambic,3.87,"Let's start with the fact that this brew is an IPA in everything except labeling. Going from that starting point, I'm rating this ale as the IPA it so definitely is. Of course, I'm not a real hop lover and have been off IPA's for most of a year now.  Pours a orange/golden amber with a 1"" off-white head that drops to 1/2"" firm layer then slowly fades to a thick film. Good lace. Smell is oh so hoppy, floral, hint of malt with an almost piney scent like the northern Michigan woods you're supposed to be thinking of while drinking it. Taste is hops, hops, floral & malt. Crisp effervescence, medium body leaning towards the fuller side, warming. Curious as to how many IBU's this ""ale"" has.

287,1093,gmcfarre,4.18,"12 oz bottled poured into Sammy Smith oversized pint glass. Have had this one numerous times, but decided to finally review it tonight (in a face-off with Alpha King).  A - Cloudy golden orange when held up to the light. Lasting off-white head with thick lacing.  S- Hops (yes, hops) with floral touch and also a bit of citrusy fruits  T - Obviously hops are the overload here, and there is an almost banana-like fruity taste on the way down. Slight biscuity taste as well. No signs of alcohol.  M - Dry bitterness is balanced by a creamy weight and feel.  D - A very palatable ale for sessioning or single enjoyment. Do with it what you will, but you must enjoy!  Overall, doesn't have the malt balance of Alpha King and the hops aren't as intense, but Two Hearted does its own thing very well. Wouldn't so no to either of these fine ales.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TheBungyo,4.17,"Pretty good pour, it golden orange. The head is about a fingers width. Smell is curious, a dash of pine followed up with orange juice. Taste is lemony, orange followed by a dash of bitter pine. The bitter is almost meek, as if trying to be inoffensive. This one manages to be very citrusy, without incorporating any grapefruit. It almost seems naked without the grapefruit. After those initial tastes, the back tastes like seltzer water. The malt doesn't really show other than to provide a bit of sweetness. In spite of that minor gripe, this is still a very enjoyable brew. Mouthfeel is near perfect, lush and creamy. If this were a local brew, I fear that it would be overshadowed by many of the premiere IPA's. Of the top of my head I can think of a couple that taste almost just like it.

Some mild grapefruit rind, orange juice, coriander and cola taste in the mix as well.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, firm carbonation, mild oil.  Overall Impression: Hits all the notes I like in an IPA.

Deep yellow color with red overtones and a bit of chill haze.  Aroma: Huge hop hit upfront, punches you right in the nose with citrus and pine. Slight sweetness also present behind the hoppiness.  Taste: Crisp maltiness with some biscuit comes through behind the citrus hoppiness. Balance obviously leans towards hops, but there is just enough body to give this brew some character.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, however little sweetness. Beer dries out well toward the end, and the bitterness from the hops helps pronounce this.

Appeared an orange-yellow color with an off-white colored head that was relatively thick and left behind spots of lacing. Nice white bubbles covered the surface. Aromas of hops, alcohol, and ripe fruits. Citrus and grapefruit flavors along with the hops dominated the taste with a strong bitterness that lingers the whole time. Much more like hop juice than an IPA. Thin and dry in my mouth with a citrus-dervied finish. My biggest problem with this beer was it's lack of complexity.

287,1093,PatandDavid,4.79,"David and I both really enjoyed this one. Had on tap a few times at the Fox and Hound in Beavercreek. Not quite crystal clear, pale gold in color. I think what makes this one stand out is you get two different hop impressions. Initially, the aroma brings it with strong flowery hops, with a second layer of grassy notes too, let's call it the meadow. This carries into the taste, which backs those impressions up with enough malt, and just a touch of sweetness. The finish is more of a citrusy hop taste. A strong medium body, enough carbonation, you have a very drinkable brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

This is the most I've noticed floral in a beer that i can remember. Taste is initially bitter up front and then becomes somewhat earthy. I want to say hay or that first cutting of wet springtime grass. Very interesting beer. I don't know that i've tasted an IPA like this before. There is enough of the hop note that it fits the category but there is definately something unique about this beer. As the beer warms a bitter aftertaste becomes more noticable. Is that now a piney note coming through in the finish. What an interesting beer.

First taste is a juicy citrus explosion. Very crisp and bitter, with a nice grassiness. Tasty. Finish is hoppy, bitter, and perhaps a bit green, which is nice. Mouthfeel is creamy, and viscous, like someone squeezed the juice out of some fresh hops as they bottled it. Im a fan.  Malt really doesnt show itself too much with this one....Its pretty much a hop bomb, which surprised me after reading many reviews on this beer. I like a good hop bomb though, so no complaints.  Easy drinker and thirst quenching. I like it. I like it alot. High drinkability. My first Bell's beer, but certainly not my last. Ill be sampling many more of their beers when I visit family in Michigan in June.  A rock-solid IPA offering from what I can tell is a great brewery. Keep it up Larry!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,johnyeast,3.85,"Burnt orange in color with a half inch head. Fruity and hoppy in smell. Many tastes flow through this beer. Obiviously the hops fly through first with a bit of citrus, a dash of malt and grains, make for a balanced recipe and a smooth and drinkable India Pale Ale.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,dreadnatty08,3.64,"Pours a very pale piss yellow, surprised for an IPA. Head sticks very little, very airy, not dense, but hold's its own. Aromas are lemony spruce, with a grapefruit backbone. Where's the hops???? This one is very dissapointing in that area, was hoping it could be a substitute for HopDevil or Stone, but alas, it is not. Very balanced though, malts come through in a particularly sweet way, hmm. This would go nicely with most cuisine, I'll give it that, just dissapointed in the lack of hops ugh.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,rhoadsrage,4.47,"(Served in an American pint glass)  A- This beer had a thick creamy white head with a second head of big rocky bubbles. The body was a deep orange with no carbonation noticed. There was a very faint haze but not much.  S- The smell of fresh green hops with a faint wriggly spearmint gum note that was nice. There was some soft slightly sweet toasted malt notes tucked in behind the hops.  T- The pale malt with some toasted malt flavor had a nice depth and good character like floor dried malt. The hops were strong but the aroma , taste and bitter hops were all balanced nicely. The faint note of mint bubblegum was in the background but gave a nice twist to the hops.  M- This beer had a medium mouthfeel with a nice creamy texture.  D- This beer had good quality grain and great hops that really taste like a simple top notch IPA until you start to notice nuances in flavor and aroma that are very nice.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,thebarnesbomb,3.48,"Poured from 12oz. bottle to pint glass with one inch head.  A- Color of honey, I was expecting a darker amber hue, but this looks pretty good too.  S- The hops are exceptionally apparent, with very little else pulling through. Almost musty smelling. But again, very hoppy.  T- As is expected from an IPA, and at $9 a six-pack, the crisp quality resounds. The bitterness of a mulitude of hops lingers in the long aftertaste. Some faint taste of orange rind is also present with the aftertaste. Some creaminess as well as it goes down. It almost tastes like a wheat ale?  M- Some body to it, just right, what I expected in this brew. No watery presence at all, but a little body for you to work with.  D- Fair, I think the problem was my expectations were a bit high upon receiving this brew. Unfortunately for me, there is a bit of a wheat ale taste to it, which for me is a huge turn off. This is mostly taken over by the hops, which are abounding in this drink. Would come highly suggested for hop loving drinkers that don't mind a little hint of wheat.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,japetus,4.77,"As this is my first review, I decided to review my all time favorite beer...Bells Two Hearted Ale.  Pouring it into a glass reveals a late sunset orange hue. Decent amount of frothy head.  Much has been said about the citrusy character of the hops and that is why I love this beer. If I could pick one word to truly describe this brew, it would be ""fresh"". Fresh popping out grapefruit/lemony/piney hops. So smooth, yet full of MANY flavors.  Drinkability....off the charts. I could sip this fine brew all day long. If you are looking to try an IPA or just looking to drink a good beer anytime..you won't be dissapointed with Two Hearted.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,amstelcat,5,"I...love...this...beer. Pours a beautiful bright amber into the glass with a good rack of foam and substantial subsequent lacing. To me, the aroma is one of mellow pine and sweet grapefruit. Taste is also of sweet grapefruit, bitter but sweet at the same time. I know this is a well hopped beer but you don't get that acrid bite that you get with some super hoppy beers. This one is very mellow, but with lot's of character.  At 6% abv, $8.99 a six, and with this flavor, you just have to love this beer as the ultimate session beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,montageman,4.57,"This is my old stand-by. No matter what kind of mood I'm in, Two Hearted does the trick. Pours an amber, orangish color. The smell is flowers, pine, and citrus. The taste is incredibly complex and wonderful - bitter, sweet at times, piney (?), and more. Easily one of my personal favorites.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,PBRstreetgang,4.18,"Pours a light shade of copper, with a dull haze. Dense head of one and a half fingers, stubborn lacing and great retention. The smell of whole hop cones are very apprent in the nose, fruity and herbal, with a hint of pine. Toasted amber malt and a slight ester begin the flavor, and a citrus/pine alpha-oil hop aftertaste balances the taste without drying it out. Light carbonation and medium body allow an uncommonly smooth mouthfeel for a I.P.A.; bitter without becoming harsh. Finishes with residual light caramel and a pleasent hop bite, an excellent drinkability.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,tgbljb,4.47,"Partaken of at Union Jack's in Boyertown. Presented as an apricot colored beverage with moderate puffy head. The smell can only be described as a superb mixture of hops and fruit. Scents of peaches, apricots, and tangerines dominate, carressed by a subtle hoppiness. Taste is extraordinary, with the fruitiness in the foreground, but mellowed by a distinct hop essence. What an absolutely magnificient combination. Drinkability is absolutely perfect. My first beer from Bell's, and if this is an example of their brewing ability, I will definitely search more out. Excellent",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Bierschenker,3.84,"Gift from Silenius, thanks for that!! Especially because it was handed over during your honeymoon.  Strong hop and orange marmalade smell when I opened the bottle. Slightly foggy golden / rusty colour. Dots of yeast floating around. Small head with big bubbles; fading very quickly. Nice thin white layer remains. Odour is very persistent, Oranges, hop. I can feel the bitterness on my tongue just by smelling the beer. A very dry taste. Bitter, like licking orange peels. Again oranges of course with malt and rich hops. Pine tree. Some carbonation The aftertaste is sharp, malt, orange candy; kind of slimy. Keeps on lingering in my mouth, quality doesnt fade.  Even after two bottles of Stone IPA, this type of beer still is kind of unearthly for me. But Im working on it. This one is more my kind of taste in comparison to Stone. Its fresh, not overwhelming and tasty. A job well done!  Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ghostwalker,4.6,"12 oz bottle. Label code 7150.  Sunny orange, slightly hazy body with a huge, frothy white head. A thing of beauty among IPAs. Mega-lacing left behind, too.  Nose is fresh-cut citrus with a noticeable malt component. The smell alone gets my mouth watering.  Flavor is huge with a piney citrus blast.Plenty of malt backbone there, to hold things together, but never overdone. There is just exactly as much sweetness as is required to offset that hop blast, not one iota more. This is one of the most well balanced IPAs I have ever had, up there with Goose Island (probably better). If I lived within range of either of these, they would be staples in my beer fridge.  Mouthfeel is that wonderfully tart and tangy, nearly astringent, highly carbonated zing of a top-notch IPA.  Drinkability is insane. It's hard to make this last, it just keeps going down, heavenly sip after sip. Again, I wish I lived within distro range of this one so I could get my hands on it regularly. Next summer, I'm bringing back a case!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,hanco005,4.45,"12oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass. This bottle is labeled 7139 and has one fish on the labelmuch different than the label on the BA website  Ahazy, cloudy, orange color with 1 inch head that quickly drops to ½ inch, then leaves just a little island blob of foam floating on the top, bubble like lacing on the glass  Sstrong hops and malt scent, pine, floral, pepper, orange  TPine dominates at the beginning, giving way to mild orange and grapefruit flavor, well balanced hop and malt taste, superb!  Msharp and a little slimy, but very nice  DI tried this based on the recommendations of other BAs and it did not disappoint. This is a great IPA. Could drink several without any problem. Believe the hype!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Viggo,4.47,"Pours a slightly hazy amber orange, thick off white heads forms, nice lacing and amazing retention. Smell is piney, with citrus, and caramel/toffee. Taste is superbly balanced, tons of piney and citrus hops up front, then into a caramel/toffee, toasty middle, piney bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, super smooth. At first I thought this was overrated but I've had it a few times it isn't at all, world class IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,brewdlyhooked13,4.97,"Original sample date 5/27/03  Ah, a Memorial Day beer tasting which will include only selections made in the U.S. of A. As it should be...  Orange, cloudy appearance, about one finger of head. The aroma is one of the best I've ever smelled. Crashing waves of floral and pine, I am thinking this is going to be one bitter-assed beer based on what I'm sniffing.  Instead, what I got was one of the most incredibly well-balanced malt/carbonation/hop combos I've ever tasted. Not near as bitter as I thought it would, making it extremely drinkable, even at 7% abv. The orangey, lemony, piney hop makes it difficult for me to remember and define the malt presence very well. When the bitter time finally arrives, it does so in complete step with the rest of the beer, not over the top at all, just solid and lingering. An awesome IPA. A friend of my brother tried it after qualifying that he doesn't like beers besides Bud. We turned him around in about 90 minutes after warming him up with some Holy Moses, Vertical 03 and then this one. He took a drink of his Bud and told me he was ruined for Budweiser beer now. A verklempt moment in the house, I was so proud of him. That's what it's all about... :-) We relegated the Bud for cleansing the palate between samplings...  *** This one is an experiment - what happens to Two-hearted after two years in lock-up???  Appearance - pours with a glowing tangerine color. Quite a frothy head, about 2 fingers, enough to make me halt the pour momentarily. I didn't pour much sediment in. The head is this crusty, almost shellac-ed looking thing and leaves large bubbles of lace in rings on the glass. 5.0  Aroma - mostly all florals, even a little soapy. It's lost some of its complexity but still smells good. 4.0  Taste - a calmer, tamer beer. A fairly chewy malt start, diminished pine and orange flavors working at the palate almost immediately. Not bad but it has a kind of soda water flavor to it, that salty kind of taste, as if to say, 'there used to be flavor in this spot but time has taken some of it away'. Ends with a flat grapefruit bitterness, present but not real biting. Past its prime but it'll drink. 3.5  Mouthfeel - slightly heavy, carbonation has held well. 4.0  Drinkability - I'd call this experiment a success. I let this warm up to maybe 55 degrees before tasting, I wonder if this is one to have a little colder and maybe bottle up some of that soda water taste. It doesn't age all that well but it keeps great. 4.0",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,danielocean03,4.6,"Poured from a 12oz bottle marked batch 7168 into a pint glass. Pours a hazy golden hued orange color with a half finger white foamy head that diminished slowly to light white sticky lacing. Aroma is rich of floral hops, nicely accented by sweet malt pairings. Taste is absolutely incredible, excellent balance between hops and malt, yet far more complex, it's like nothing I've tasted before. At first taste, this IPA tarts off with a quick hoppy bite that is rich in citrus and floral notes, before giving way to a softer, caramelly sweet maltiness that leaves you wanting more. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, slick on the tongue, coats the mouth with a nice light oily feeling. Very, very drinkable, I think I may have a new favorite session beer, I will seek out more of this beer very soon.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bearrunner44,4.82,"Appearance- Cloudy, dull orange-gold color. Frothy, clingy off-white head. As the head recedes, the side of the glass stays covered by a thin blanket of lace.  Aroma- Herbal hops up front. Buttery, malty backbone. The hop aromas are strong, but the rich malt presence takes some of the edge off. Nice.  Taste- The body is substantial; it feels fairly oily in the mouth. The acidic, biting flavor of the hops is the first thing to hit the taste buds. Big malt flavors gradually work their way into the mix; the malt is sweet and biscuity. The hops hide in the background before popping up again in the finish, leaving a lingering herbal taste on the tongue.  Verdict- Without a doubt, this is the best IPA I've had. Spicy, full, complex and delicious.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,maddamish,4.92,"Wow!  WOW!  Sorry. I had to quote myself.  Cloudy golden in color. Medium head with lacing throughout the beer.  What a beaut this was. This beer is an original.  Taste: A smooth hoppy taste is present with a sugary grapefruit type of thing going on in the background. A very complex and fun beer to drink.  Smell: Hoppy Grapefruit, flowers, cotton candy notes  Notes: This was just a great beer night with Orval proceeded with the Two Hearted Ale. I think I have found a new regular beer and I don't think I will be going back to anything else.  WOW!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,PintPiner,4.42,"Poured out of a bottle at about 50 oF into a clear pint glass. Nice orange-honey color. 1"" white head that doesn't go away, medium-thick lacing.  Big and wonderful aroma of pine & citrus -- lemon & grapefruit.  Lots of carbonation, slightly malty up front with a wonderful bitter hoppy finish.  I like this beer a lot, it's one of my favorite IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,hgrong,4.82,"Batch 7196, 2005  Pours bright orange with a huge rocky head and loads of carbonation. Visually it reminds me of Saison Dupont, but that is where the comparisons stop. The nose is absolutely gorgeous. It smells of grapefruit and spice with a slight nod towards marijauna and pine. It smells like fresh hops, perfect for an IPA. The palate is slightly more balanced. The initial palate is some sweet pale and caramel malts which are quickly washed away by a tidal wave of hops. Again, citrus and pine flavor are predominant with a deep, powerful bitterness. The mouthfeel is is crisp and refreshing due to the high carbonation and light malts.  This beer is fantastic. It is my personal benchmark for what an IPA should taste like. My only complaint is that it is significantly better when fresh which takes out any chance of aging this beer. Overall this beer is outstanding.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ahking,4.04,"Let me say first that I love this beer. It is floral and spicy and very aromatic. But as other reviewers may have pointed out, it is rather unbalanced. Some may call this ""hop juice"" for its aggressive hop flavor and aroma. Pours a rich golden color, brighter than most amber colored ales. Nice frothy head that turns quickly into a white ring leaving lacing down the glass. Aroma is rough hewn and woody. Flavor is hoppy,less malty, with hints of citrus and apple. Mouthfeel is only average since the ultra high hop flavor makes this dry and rough at times.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Enola,3.77,This is my first Bell's beer. The number on the bottle is 7139. The beer is a cloudy amber color. The head was minimal. The smell is sweet. The taste is verry hoppy. Sweet notes linger for a while. Bitter at first with a sweet aftertaste. The beer leaves a refreshing coolness in the mouthfeel. The drinkability is high but deffinatly not a session beer. I would drink it again if it were available in my area. I would love to have a cask version of this sometime.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,swid,4.4,"Beer #10 (of 13) from my beer purchase in Indiana.  Bell's Two Hearted Ale pours a dark golden color into my pint glass. Atop the hazy, bottle-conditioned liquid sits a 1/2"", off-white head that collapses onto itself after a few minutes. Hight levels of carbonation create a smooth, bubbly head. Lots of delicate lacing. The aroma is dominated by the citric smell of the hops, but not overwhelmingly so; unlike many other IPAs, it's also evident that there's some maltiness present as well.  The flavors present in this beer come together almost flawlessly. The hop bitterness is wonderfully complex; after every sip, a different fruit seems to come through: grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, etc. These citrus flavors do not overwhelm the overall flavor profile, though, and after a little bit, the sweet toasted flavors of the malt pop up as well. Mouthfeel is wet and moderately full, the finish is quite hoppy and not as balanced as the taste is.  Overall, Two Hearted Ale is an outstanding IPA; it's insanely redrinkable. I'd drink this beer all the time if it was available anywhere near me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BuckeyeNation,4.92,"I've been meaning to re-review Bell's Two Hearted Ale ever since I had the bottle that led to my first review because I was convinced that it had seen better days. I bought an uber fresh sixer on my recent trip to Ohio and have worked my way through it over the past few weeks. Since I've been more impressed with each passing bottle, this last one should be otherworldly. Damn, I knew I should have bought more than six.  Ripe apricot-amber with an all-encompassing cloud of fine particulates. The ivory colored cap contains the barest blush of pale orange and is a thing of beauty. Milkshake creamythick and hop resin sticky, it leaves buttery thick sheets of minutely pocked lace on the glass that will, no doubt, have to be removed with gallons of scalding water.  Ah... the intoxicating aroma of fresh Centennial hops! As I drank the other bottles, I debated the gloriousness of Two Hearted's nose. At this moment in time, however, I can't imagine a better smelling IPA. The insanely bright, incandescent, pungent, grapefruit juicy hops cement the notion in my mind that every member of the 4-Cs, whether used alone or in combination, and if used skillfully, are the best beer hops in the world, hands down.  I know what this beer tastes like with some age on it and now I know what it tastes like fresh. It has barely passed the 4-week mark from the time of bottling to my mouth... and it tastes like it. A more than solid backbone of buttery soft, teasingly sweet pale malt greets my every sip and is still very nearly annihilated by a hop explosion that is so fresh and so immediate that it makes me want to weep.  This is one of the best examples of a 'candied white grapefruit sections' IPA that I can think of. Spruce makes a welcome contribution, but nothing else gets in the way of the grapefruit love. If I had to think of one word to describe this beer, that word would be 'beautiful'. I'm not talking about the appearance, although it looks great, but about the entire experience. Two Hearted tastes so perfectly balanced, so deliciously hoppy, so... sublime, that beautiful is the only word that truly fits.  The mouthfeel is a smidgen lighter than I'd like, but that's such obvious nitpicking that I'm embarrassed to type it. It's supremely smooth and silky, making the drinking as natural as breathing. An absolutely perfect amount of carbonation doesn't hurt what is, quite simply, mouth candy.  Bell's Two Hearted Ale is a world-class IPA, period. In fact, I'm considering an e-mail assault on the talented Mr. Bell until he decides to extend his distribution area this far west. If I had this fine ale within easy reach, it would have a permanent place in my beer fridge. With regular consumption, say a sixer every week, I'd probably begin to tire of it in... oh, about 2035.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A very decent IPA as expected from Bells.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,whartontallboy,4.33,"Slightly-cloudy gold pour with a big white head that fades slowly and leaves sheets of lace. Good-looking carbonation. Smell is citric and grapefruit-laden, but with a slight malt backing and some little pine notes. Flavor is equally hoppy, with the grapefruit and orange coming through just as clear, but the malt is doughy and ample. Finishes with a lingering, fruity bitterness that can't be beaten.  Overall: A great IPA that's in the top handful of American examples. Always a treat.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Zorro,4.32,"12 Oz bottle Sampled through the efforts of Boxing Day BIF and Pentathlete.  Pours a hazy golden colored ale with a good white head.  Smell is lots of very aromatic and fresh hops. Good mix of hops not just limited to the usual North Western USA pine and grapefruit varieties. Aromas of spices and mint with a touch of citrus and pineapple. There is a nice malt backbone here to, sweet fruit juice.  Taste is mildly sweet and candy like with a good hop hit at first. The malt is a bit honey like but there is ample bitterness to hide it here. Good floral hop flavors here along with some pine and citrus that it seems every IPA has. Spicy and woody flavors are the last level of hop flavors to emerge. An extremely full flavored IPA.  Mouthfeel is good.  A super solid IPA experience here. Very tasty but after one your taste buds are a bit hop saturated so that it would be a waste of good beer to drink this just to get drunk.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,pentathlete,4.17,"Foggy gold with a large white head that falls to a sturdy table. Nose is all pine sap and lemon rind. Taste is all perfumey hops with some raw bitter oils and a lemony after taste. There is no balance here, this is a hop heads brew all the way. Mouthfeel is medium to full, outstanding finish. Decent drinakbility for such a hoppy beer. A fine IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Aroma of citrusy grapefruit with a hint of caramel maltiness that peeks through now and then. It smells ""tangy"".  Has a very smooth combo of citrusy hops and a caramel malty sweetness upfront. This is washed away by a gentle wave of hops and finishes quite cleanly. Actually quite balanced and very delicious.  Nice full, smooth body.  This is a great version of an American IPA.

287,1093,nlmartin,4.37,"The beer was poured into a pub glass.  Appearance: The beer is a very pretty amber to peach coloration. The head is a massive off white fluffy mountain. The beer has a few floaty particles but they are of no matter.  Smell: The beer smells a marvellous sweet malty citrusy grapefruit treat. By all the beer Gods this is a treat. There is the smell of piney spicy funkyness.  Taste: The beer is a hop punch to the mouth. Small amounts of syrupy sweetness attempt to make themselves known; however, expect no mercy as the hoppyness continues. There is a mouthfull of grapefruit present in the beer.  Mouthfeel: This is a very crisp and dry finishing beer. The beer is medium bodied and very tasty.  Drinkability: This is practically everything I want in an IPA. I am not 100% sure but I think Two Hearted Ale was the first craft brewed beer I ever drank.

287,1093,ihscout426,4.54,Poured into a pint glass with a nice head and immediate aroma of hops. A good beer to just stick your nose i an close your eyes. Hints of pine and hay in the smell. Good flavors on the front end and a blast of hop bitterness on the back of the tongue. I really enjoy the finish on this beer.  A good beer to finish off a session of Wheat beers because of the contrast.

287,1093,indy169,4.5,"Bell's can do little wrong these days & as evidenced by this exceptional IPA. The Two Hearted Ale is one I enjoy on tap and in bottles with little variation between the two. This is a classic IPA with more malty mid-tones than the ever-popular Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and not quite the high end of the Dogfish Head offerings. To me this is the ideal IPA. Drinkable, interesting and satisfying. Balanced, rich and simply wonderful.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,twelvsies,4.55,"This is an excellent beer. Definitely the first to disappear from the mixed case I picked up the other day. Beautiful orange tone to this one, and a huge, solid, rocky head that maintains it's shape for a while and then fades to a still substantial foam that lasts til the final sip. Mmmm. In terms of smell and taste, this is a perfectly balanced beer, yet robust in both the malt and hop areas. I generally don't draw comparisons between beers, but I like this just about as much as the Alesmith Yulesmith, which I couldn't help but be reminded of while drinking this beer. They both have that great almost vanilla ice cream sweet malt character backing up a load of hops. Very resinous and oily hops in the nose, and also on the palate, but moving towards a more citrusy orange peel and spice bouquet. Also, I could be imagining this but I'm detecting either some light spicing, or just little complexities such as clove and nutmeg. Really nice. This is pretty much a medium bodied beer but it has a great slightly thick and sticky mouthfeel, super creamy and smooth. I know this is tough or nearly impossible to find on the east coast, but if you find some on your travels definitely pick it up, it's one of the best IPAs I've had.

It poured a hazy, golden-to-straw color with a big beaded bleach white head that is quite substantial and leaves a good, clinging lace. The floral hop bouquet is...lovely! Its almost like potpourri, quite an accomplishment. The body is best described as medium with a mouthfeel that's full of a good juicy malt character. The hop character in the beer itself is a pleasant combo of citrus and floral notes, really the perfect marriage. Also adding to the intrigue is the complex sugary balance, which is outstanding. It finishes with a little lemony pucker but still clings to the rose-like passiveness. An outstanding IPA, best I've had in a while!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DarkerTheBetter,4.65,"This beer pours a dark honey brown that is slightly cloudy. The head is fluffy and a dirty brown. It fell quickly to a fluffy film. Great lacing!  The smell is incredibly aromatic that playfully stings my nose with huge pineapple and nectarine hops. No malt detected.  Tastes of strong pine and citrus hops with a fantastic understated foundation of oat and caramel malts. Well paired flavors! The finish is a nice sour dryness that makes me want another sip in a bad way.  Mouth feel is full and creamy with a medium body and a little carbonation.  Nice beer, Bells! Its not too heavy, but delicious and easy to drink!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,isubsmith,3.77,"Appearance: Golden orange. Slightly hazy. Lots of lacing. White foamy head.  Nose: Hoppy and grassy. Some fruity notes.  Taste: Malty upfront, bitter hoppy finish.

287,1093,kohoutek,4.55,"It is odd to sit down and write a review for my favorite session beer. It is almost as if I was forced to tell my best friend what I loved about them, but only got one chance to do it. My subconscious says, ""Don't screw up, this is a special one. The two of you have been together for a while. Through thick and thin - times good and bad - celebration and dissapointment.""  Well, here goes. . .  A beautiful amber orange sunset display. Ah yes! A bit cloudy from its natural, unfiltered state. Floral, citrus and perfumed oils percolate through the air. Wonderful white, bubbling foam fills my pint. Lacing continues to the last drop. Hop oils do wonders for lace and bubbles. Are there hops in here? :)  The nose releases bisquit malt, honey and just a whisper of vanilla. These qualities are barely discernable due to the hop overload. Lemon, grapefuit, grapes, herbal-freshly cut grass. . . .ohm . . .

What a shame!  Warning: this delicious ale (about $9 a six pack in Ohio) will ruin your drinking-out experience unless you are in a fine establishment with its own quality cask ale. I can't wait to get home in the evening to see those bottom-feeders (trout hardly) on the label.  Strong taste, but dry and clean. Fruity but not sweet. Better than the other Bells.

287,1093,NJbeerman,4.02,I was able to finally try this beer thanks to a friend bringing it back for me. I was very happy with it. It did surprise me that it was cloudy but the floral aroma of the hops was fantastic. It appears to have multiple types of hops in it which adds to the complexity of the beer. Surprisingly it did not hold its head well but the little head it did keep clung to the glass. The beer felt almost creamy with a nice hop bite. It does have a bit too much stickyness to it but that is just getting picky. I noticed a slight residual sweetness in the finish but very little malt character.  Overall - I am very happy with this well balance yet still hoppy ipa.  Enjoy.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,benito,4.85,"It's been nearly a year since I last had a Two Hearted, which I've already reviewed here, but which, upon tasting it again, compelled me to sit down and right a review.  I should reveal my bias before going any further: I believe that this is one of the single best beers brewed in America today.  It pours a transparent copper and tangerine with appropriate head and good carbonation. The bouquet is dominated by hops, a floral sniff that is both straitforward and defined, though not overwhelming. As with the appearance, the beauty of this beer lies in its measure, its balance, its restraint.  As for taste, Two Hearted is the standard by which all other IPAs should be measured: a clean, hop bitterness that occasionally surprises me, perhaps as a reminder to say, 'don't forget what's driving this beer.' And yet, it's balanced by a crisp sweetness that imparts a refreshing quality to the beer that is quite remarkable. Beyond this, it's the simplicity here is what strikes me again and again: this brew perfectly captures its style with a striking simplicity, and I can't imagine how it could be improved upon. Whereas many other IPAs or Double IPAs (and very good ones at that), strive for shocking levels of hops or a more complex palate, Two Hearted seems content to reveal itself quickly and cleanly and perfectly, again and again.  Exemplary in every way.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Thankfully, this time it did not taste like oxidized vegetable oil.  A nice copper-orange color with a wispy white head. The smell is enormously hoppy. Loads of citrus (zest), rose petals, pine, and floral flavor with a hoppy dry finish. Nice full mouthfeel and very drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BitterBrian,4.45,"The label had a fish on the front, didn't look as pictured. I'm not one to be able to guess fish by looks, but I would guess it's a trout?  This poured a hazy amber into a nonick pint glass. The inch head was a creamy white (almost caramel colored) and it lasted a few minutes it is leaving heavy lacing.  The smell was of oats and yeast with a hint of apple.  The taste was a lively blend of hops and malt. a real heart warmer. Compared to the other IPAs I have had, the hops are more subdued. It was very enjoyable - I feel like I drank a good bitter. I would drink this again - in a heartbeat. - no pun intended",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,nvsblman,3.65,"Hazy light copper color with a thick fizy head. The aroma is mostly hops, some piney, some citrusy, with a hint of biscuit. The taste doesn't reveal as much hoppiness as expected from the smell, but it does linger into the aftertaste. Nice malt structure, but a little more balanced that I would have guessed. It's well carbonated, with a slightly dry finish.

287,1093,jakester,4.57,"I got this as a single at UJ's on the Manatawny. I drank it in a goblet. Date stamped on the label.  Pours a hazy gold with a slight orange tint. A big two fingered head of off-white foam forms on top, falling to a nice coating and a ring, with great lacing.  Aroma is grassy/citrusy hops, some pine needles, and clean, freshly baked biscuits, and caramel. This beer smells wonderful!  The first flavor is strong citrus/grassy hops, with notes of lemon and mowed lawn. There is a really good biscuity malt base to back up the hops, and a pretty big hop bitterness. Now I know why so many people like this beer! Aftertaste is floral and grassy, with a lingering bitterness and a little sweetness.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, a very nice texture for an IPA. Carbonation is soft, and the finish is long and bitter at your throat.  This has to be one of the top five IPA's in the country. Smooth, delicious, very well balanced, with a great hop character.

287,1093,Winter,4.3,"Pours aa hazy orange in color with a nice white foamy head. Citrusy aroma of grapefruit and pine. Full-bodied mouthfeel. First taste matches what was alluded to in the nose. Juicy hop bitterness strikes the tongue. Flavors of grapefruit, apricot and citrus explode on the palate. Malt backbone layers the hop bitterness to near perfection. The bitterness of the hops and the supporting malt flavor merge just before the long lingering piney finish. The finish is a tad dry and begs you to take another sip. Amazing IPA.

Somewhat unique to this particular IPA is an earthy, ""leaf like"" smell that I can't quite put my finger on. Really intruiging..  Appearance: Cloudy light tangerine colored beer with an ample head, somewhat rocky in texture. Very good lacing with this one. You know, I can't stop smelling this one..  Taste: Excellent. Very well presented hoppy citrus with that same earthy smell present in the taste. A real mellow sweetness chops some of the inital hop blast and balances quite well. Leaves just a bit of spiciness on the palate along with a cleansing bitternes. Hey, I just burped up a flower. Cool.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with crisp carbonation intensifies the hops. Somewhat creamy feel to it blends really well with that spiciness I mentioned. Interesting..  Drinkability: A superb IPA in my opinion.

Head is ultra-frothy and leaves trails of lacing behind it. This being my 4th Two-Hearted this week, it's damn hard to find any flaws in this outstanding beer.. The aroma is nothing short of heavenly. I'm not sure what's more potent..the floral or citrus hops..but one thing's for sure..they're both out in full force. What's so amazing is that as highly-hopped as this beer is, it's actually smooth, drinkable..and even..dare i say...balanced! With 6% abv and the full-flavor it has, you'd think it'd be much less palatable...but it's as easy to drink as any IPA. It's certainly a beer that is deservedly at the top of it's class. A masterpiece painted with hops...and maybe the help of a fish.  One of the best beers I've ever tried, no doubt about it.

Mouthfeel: Very light and carbonated, but not in an offensive way. Leaves a nice, piney bitter aftertaste.  Drinkability: Not too heavy or palate-ruining but still has the nice IPA bitterness. I could definitely have another one, or three...  Wow, this is one great brew. I think even people who aren't into IPAs would probably find this one very palatable.

Poured a deep golden color with a thick foamy head. It appears to be alive with carbonation bubbles rushing towards the top of the glass.  It smells like the model IPA should, all hops with hints of citrus.  I was in love from the second this beer reached the inside of my mouth. The hoppy flavor gave me a real kick without being overpowering. Afer swallowing a gulp the carbonation stays a while to dance on my tongue. This beer was refreshing and full-bodied at the same time. Drinkability is dangerousely high for a beer of this strength. A great offering from Bell's and one of my favorite two beers that they make.

(three floyds, etc.) yes it is a hop monster. yes it is good, but so are so many others and they taste alot alike. so it is good, but it has some stiff competition so in the end my overall review will show it. what the hell? it's an awsome beer and you should try it and judge it yourself. cheers!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Head holds on fairly well, but does leave some decent lace behind.  The smell is all about the hops, with ovetones of fresh orange and roses. There's a bit of spice underneath.  The flavour has hops all over it up front, with just a bit of fresh orange coming out of it, and a bit of cereal grain on the end. theres' a nice spiciness throughout.  The mouthfeel is not exciting, but is solid. Medium liquid is topped by a tight to medium carbonation that swells just past the halfway point.  I find it very drinkable but not perfect.

287,1093,Golden2wenty1,4.57,"Picked up a single at Riley's here in Madison. Trying to ween myself into more hoppy beers, let's see how it goes.  Pours a pretty goldenrod yellow with a finger of white frothy head and excellent lacing. Smell is extremely floral/herbal hops, some light tropical fruits and a faint hint of malt. Taste is more of the same, this is certainly the hoppiest beer I've ever tried, which isn't saying much, but it hit my tongue pretty hard. As it warmed it became significantly more balanced, however, with the malt bill balancing out the extreme hops. I can see why hopheads would worship this beer, it has a lot going for it, but I don't think I'm quite there yet, still glad I tried this, I will certainly revisit it when I think my palate is a little more mature.  Update: So young, so naive...This has become my hop-craving stand-by. So expertly crafted and so good at what it does and just sublime on cask.

I could (and have) drink these all night.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,PatYoda,4.65,"Pours a cloudy peach with a disintegrating head. Seems like I usually get more head out of this one, but this pour was very disappointing. Will rerate if necessary. Smell hits you right after you pour before you can even get your nose in there. An earthy, floral hop character dominates with some extra sweet pineapple in the background. Not much malt in there. Taste is delicious. No attempt at balance whatsoever is made, but that's ok in my book. The only time it hurts this beer is in the finish, which ends up very grainy and not quite as smooth as it could be. Other than that, this is just a full on hop attack, and it is done very well. Never before have I had an IPA that succeeds at balancing floral and citrusy hops so well. A fresh sample of this stuff is amazingly potent in taste, always blending the two main hop flavors together well. And there's no hop bite to speak of. It's hardly bitter at all and the mouthfeel is velvety. If there's not at least one of these in my beer fridge, then I'm either drinking my last one at the moment or I'm dead.

Its incredibly sharp.  The color is a light orange and hazey with a nice white head.  I used to consider this a very drinkable beer but now if I have more than one in a sitting, I get all crazy like and start freaking out and then after about an hour I get really, really hung over.

287,1093,waldowin,4.12,"I was expecting a strong ale, possibly a bit smokey, when I opened this bottle. Man was I wrong.  Appearance - Pours a golden amber, fading to yellow at the edges, with a thin almost pure-white head that stays as a ring all the way down.  Smell - As soon as I opened the bottle, large buds of hops leaped out of the bottle, up my nostrils and one-two punched my brain. That's how strong the hops smell is in this bottle, a wonderfully floral bouquet of hops that reminds me of home-brewing, followed by a small hint of honey and vanilla to smooth things out. I could smell this brew all day.  Taste - You'll like hops if you're drinking this beer. I generally don't care for most hops, and this one actually converted me. This beer doesn't exactly scream ""HOPS!"" at you quite the way an Arrogant Bastard Ale might, but the strength is the same. ""Floral"" is definitely the word here. Almost no malt taste up front, and a wisp of malts and something smooth at the end.  Mouthfeel - You can almost feel the leaves of the hop buds sliding across your tongue on this one. The alcohol is mildly astringent, and creates that effect with the flavor that is so dominant in this ale. It's a bit of a gassy beer, and every burp you have is going to slam your nose with hops again.  Drinkability - As great as both the flavor and aroma of this beer is, after a while it's like sticking your head in a bouquet of flowers, eventually you'll want some fresh air. Until then though, this beer is just amazing. *Many* thanks to Lrrr for opening my eyes to the world of good hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The look of the beer is great and I could detect the aroma before I held it up to my nose... always a good sign in my book.  On the first whiff it was hops and grapefruit. Second was big grapefruit, some berry and a nice flowery sweetness. Third was a powerful hops with hints of chocolate and mint.  Taste is exceptional. Slightly bubbly in the mouth and quite nice. Citrus and hops on the palate. Extremely clean. Easily a beer I'd buy a lot of if it were available in Nebraska.

Flavor left so much to be desired... Poured out to a nice light orange / yellow color that was slightly cloudy. Nice head that was off white and cloud-like. Strong aroma of hops and pine, with citrus odors. This far, seems very nice. Taste was bland, very boring. Quite dry notes of hops and light spice, with minimal bitterness. Some aftertaste that was almost like having soap in my mouth. Yuck. Mouthfeel was nothing special, and the overall drinkability is nothing out of the ordinary, as this brew just wasn't a great American IPA, with only traces of malt and bitterness. If the sweetness factor and malt was upped, along with more citrus zing, this would be a killer brew. But there not, so it isn't.  UPDATED REVIEW 11/05/06  A: Murky orange color with a dense head of frothy off white foam. Lots of lace. Medium to medium low carbonation.  S: Wow. Lots of citrus, pine and zesty hops. A real treat. Straightforward presentation.  T: Quite possibly the perfect AIPA. Fresh hops, citrus, and pine notes are heavy, yet not overpowering or annoying. A noteable malt backbone is present, with herbal notes toward the finish.  M: Dense, yet not thick. Feels nice on the palate, and easy going down.  D: I've come full circle. I didn't like this beer back in the day, and it is now my go-to brew for my mounting hop addiction. I have at least one bottle of this on hand in the fridge at all times, no matter what. It is my drug of choice. I love hops. Praise to Larry Bell, this is his most wonderful creation.  Notes: This is my beer. I love it. A world-class American Classic.

287,1093,Bumpon10s,3.95,"A - Pours a thin (for an IPA), slightly cloudy, orangey amber. A huge head on this thing that just kept on growing.  S - Hoppy, with a big pine note. It's as if I opened a bottle of Pine*Sol.  T - I am enjoying thwe hops in this, but it is perhaps a bit more floral and less citrusy than other IPAs I have enjoyed.  M - Very thin, I understand this isn't an Imperial, but it too thin for an IPA. Something leads me to beileve they watered this down a bit.  D - It goes down well, keeps clean and has a considerably low ABV. A very easy drinker.  This is a good IPA, but not a great IPA. Perhaps I was expecting a bit more from this, but it seems that Bell's weakened it up to get it selling a bit better. I liked it, but I don't think I'll be getting it again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Px2GrafX,4.66,"presentation: 12oz. bottle with 4 color logo of an illustration of a fish with a red and white border. ""two hearted ale"" in a red cheesy cooper-like font with white shrink and swell. an explanation of their ipa is printed on the back. no abv or freshness date displayed. there is the number 6957 printed in a white box on the bottom of the label- maybe a batch code?  appearance: pours a super hazy dark caramel and orange with yellow-orange highlights in a tulip glass. nice two finger fluffy white head with a slight yellow cast. i mean, this beer is crazy cloudy with the top being much darker than the bottom. small trails are dropping through the beer to the bottom of the glass that looks like the last seconds of a firework. i don't know how else to describe it. a little odd.  smell: lotsa citrusy hops. lemons and grapefruits and a nice pineapple aroma. a light piney aroma as well. some alcohol in the late nose.  taste: first sip is citrus with an almost electric hop bitterness. lots of grapefruit and lemons. piney hop burps. there's a yeasty bready flavor at the end of the sip. there's very little malt flavors but maybe a little caramel as the brew warms. not very balanced at all. this is an ipa, though. finishes a little dry with a bitter aftertaste.  mouthfeel: smooth light medium body but crisp. nice carbonation and a very good swallow.  drinkability: one of those beers where i'm almost done drinking before i can rate the drinkability. therefore, dangerously drinkable! very tasty and smells dreamy. the aftertaste also keeps you yearning for another sip...or another bottle.  overall: very nice ipa. i hate when the only thing that really hurts a beer is it's appearance. the aroma makes up for it however. highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Backer2004,3.93,"I'm just enjoying IPAs more and more these days. Two Hearted Ale is another fine example of Bell's offerings. Rich and complex, with enough alcohol strength that this cannot be session beer. Great foam head and carbonation, nice hop character. Not my favorite IPA, but will definitely purchase this one if I'm back in the Midwest.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,numenor1,4.57,"Friend brought this back from Wisconsin for me, first Bells offering i've tried.  Pours hazy light orange with a very fluffy, rocky head which never completely goes away and clumps down the glass. Smells of piny, floral, citrusy hops with a very slight funkiness to it. I like it. First up there's very soft bready malt then an incredibly full, round, lush(but not at all aggressive) orangy pine hop flavor takes over my mouth. Bready malts and a nice medium creamy mouthfeel support it throughout. An interplay of spicy hops and pale toasted malts linger on in the finish. This is really terrific. Such a round, full, yet subtle flavor. Drinkable to the end. Best IPA i've had yet; what it lacks in aggression is made up with its cunning subtlety. Sadly I only have one more bottle.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,tjthresh,3.82,"Two Hearted Ale has fine balance all the way through. In the aroma, the Centennial hops and sweet malt intertwine great. The bitterness is kept in check with a good malt back bone. It poured a hazy yellow-orange and a small off white head. The medium body makes this beer a staple beer in most households.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,beveragecaptain,4.32,"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a hazy golden color with a large off-white head. Piney hop aroma. Juicy hop flavor. The hops are very strong and give this beer flavors of grapefruit, pine, and flowers. The finish is very spicy and bitter. Malt flavor comes through a bit, but is really dominated by the hops. Any hop fan will love this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,sopor,4.85,"Every bit as good as everybody says it is, if not better! I'm a hophead, and this rocks!  Pale amber with a haze from slight amount of sediment I allowed to pour, not all of it or I wouldn't have been able to see through at all! Large frothy head filles the remainder of my pint glass then slowly dies to a creamy fil that sticks around and laces like none other. Lace is still there on the glass when I washed it about 14 hours later. Smell is hugely herbal and floral, reminfs me of my mother's gardens.  WOW, this tastes like I am drinking the air from a dead-cedar bog somewhere in the vicinity of Seney. Anybody know about ""The Seney Stretch?"" Open the windows next time you drive this 45 mile long dead-straight and flat peice of road, and you'll know the smell I mean! Herbal, floral, and a little piney, the hops overlay a slightly caramel and toasted malt. Leaves an aftertaste of herbal crisp hoppiness.  Moderate body definitely lets you know it's there without being too thick. Carbonation is light and dances on the tongue.  Spectacular brew! Makes me happy to live in Michigan!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,malty,4.63,"This beer has a resident spot in my beer fridge as well being a top pick while being bellied-up at the pub. I can't believe it's taken me this long to formally rate it.  Clear (if you don't swirl & pour in the sediment) golden amber color with a sticky booming light beige head. Globular lacing for days.  Resinous fresh hops and pineapple galore. Let's break it down; pine sap dipped in powdered sugar, dripping citrus twang and steaming sourdough bread scents.  Flavors are beyond fresh citrus, apricot, peaches & pineapple all entwined in a floral hop bouquet to die for. The malt backdrop is graceful and rounded - no sharp edges here.  Mouthfeel is prickly velvet. Nice bite served on a plush velour medium-full body. Fine carbonation at a moderate level. The finish is dry, sweet and goes on for days.  The drinkability? Are you kidding me? Definitely a beer to have ""If I were stranded on a desert island"".  This IPA is perfect. The most citrusy and well-placed malt profile I've ever had the pleasure to experience in an IPA. The hops are oily, fresh and uplifting - not at all husky or raw. Very smooth and graceful, but can throw the gloves off if needed. A soon-to-be Michigan legend. I vote this to be our state beer. A must try.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,bahumutx,4.3,Appearance: Pours a golden color with a nice size foamy head.   Smell: Has a very fruity smell. You can defiantly smell the hops.   Taste: At first a sweet malt taste graces the tongue and then the bitterness of the hops sets in. During all of this a slight citrus taste is also present on the tongue.   Mouthfeel: A very smooth beer with the right amount of carbonation.   Drinkability: A very drinkable beer. Could be a session beer if you like this style of beer.  Once again a great job by the folks at Kalamazoo brewing. Keep up the great work!!!,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MuddyFeet,4.05,"Big foamy head! No!!! Don't overflow. No, no, no, no. Phew, the pour was fine. Brownish orange in color, like clay-dirtied water. Some sediment floating around in there. Nose is full of light hops, but... Wow! Are they ever hidden once I tasted. Last time I homebrewed I had some extra whole hops and threw some in my mouth. Taste just like that. Very green and rich and vibrant and earthy. Feels like I am hiking in oregon again. Great balance with the malts too. Just enough sweetness to not allow the bitters to be overpowering. Just little bits of citrus rinds too. Do they also cask condition this ale? I wish, I surely wish... Mouthfeel is full bodied with a nice and dry finish. Actually drank it just slightly chilled and it tasted absolutely awesome.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,therica,4.02,"We happened to be in Kalamazoo for a few days, and Bell's was recommended, so we tracked down the brew-pup and brewery-store - WHAT A HASSLE! After an hour of driving in circles, stopping and asking people on the streets (EVERYONE seemed to know where it was but were useless in giving helpful directions), we finally succeeded. It's near the downtown section, and none of the other places outside the city as shown on some maps etc. As a result, there wasn't enough time to stay for the pub, but we hit the store and bought a few cases-- including a case of Two-Hearted Ale.  It's rather hop-ish, typical of an IPA. If you're an IPA fan then you'll probably enjoy it quite a bit.  The basic consensus of our little group was mixed-- I thought it was pretty decent, but nothing I would seek out, again. Most of the others thought it was far too bitter. Of course they aren't much in the way of APA or IPA fans.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,GnomeKing,4.75,"This is a model for the style. I usually look for a nice balance between hops and malts. This beer goes beyond striking a nice balance, instead blending the two flavors into a seamless, perfect marriage. Sweetness and bitterness, the perfect pair, with a tinge of citrus to mix things up.  The head is foamy and the mouthfeel soft and full, yet there's not a creaminess, which is a quality I often find distasteful in IPAs. The beer's ample lacing looks nice as it sticks to the glass after every lovely sip.  At 6%, this makes for a nice session beer. Its flavors will provide endless delights, yet will never overwhelm you as you drink glass after glass. Two hearts aren't enough to contain the love I feel for this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,SCW,4.62,"This beer might be one of the greatest American IPAs ever created. Period. Midwest represent!  My beer poured a hazy amber color with a massive, pillow-like head. The beer left an amazing head and lacing all the way down the glass. What a beautiful sight.  The aroma? Fuggedaboutit. Smell wafted as soon as the cap was lifted off the bottle. Sort of a skunky grapefruit aroma... very funky and nice. I love it.  The taste was perfectly balanced, especially for the hophead. A little caramel, a little sugar sugar, and lots of hoppy ironfist punch to the palate thickness. I love it.  What a drinkable brew. You could go so far to call it slammable.  Without question, an American Classic. Nuff said.  Booya!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,battlekow,3.66,"Pale golden yellow, nice, long-lasting eggshell head, very good lacing. Smell and taste are very hoppy: cirtusy, zesty, perfumey, herbally. Mouthfeel is amazingly creamy. I ate this with some spicy dirty rice and it complemented it great. Hops still aren't really my thing, but even so, this is a pretty tasty beer; I can only imagine that if you like hops as much as some people here, this beer could be your constant companion.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,marcobrau,4.57,"My Bell's Two Hearted Ale was bottled on July 21, 2005 .. and it shows! As I pour this golden brew into a straight-sided pint glass, I can't help but notice the massive hop aroma; a pine forest full of aroma, accented by a little citrus. the carbonation seems good and the beer displays a good head of foam that settles to thin layer, leaving lacing down the sides of my glass. Love that hop aroma! As a homebrewer, I'm guessing that Bell's added a lot of Centennial hops late or after the boil. After smelling hops, I get to taste 'em and the resiny hop flavor nearly overcomes the presence of some good honey-ish malt and slightly toasted malt flavors. All of this leads to a big bitter finish. Perhaps not the most complex IPA, but when consumed this fresh this beer is a joyous hop explosion!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,RockyTopHeel,4.35,"Yellow-amber in color with a thin, dense foam of white bubbles. Aroma of citrus, piney hops, and something indeterminably sweet.

I think I'm going to get used to having this readily available to me now that I'm in Chicago...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,blitz134,4.42,"After a weekend of smallmouth fishing in Virginia I thought this beer would be appropriate with its river themed name. A thanks to felonious for this brew in BIF 19.  Poured with a huge white head that slowly worked its way down into mounds of pillowy foam. Body is apricot colored with quite a bit of haze...  Aroma is almost pure hops. Citrus mainly with a good bit of pine and some straw and caramel malt sweetness. Leads to an overall sweet floral aroma. I dont pick up much citrus in the taste however. Mainly an earthy, herbal hoppiness with pine and resin. Maybe a bit of citrus grapefruit toward the middle. A good malt character blends well to balance this brew.  Mouthfeel is relatively full with a good bit of carbonation. Drinkability is a highlight of this brew. Could easily be a fishin' beer any time of year, during hot weather to keep you cool or during the winter to liven the tastebuds while trying not to freeze.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Orange colored with a fluffy white head that disappates fairly quickly. Average lacing on the glass. Great floral hop aroma with some spruce mixed in. Yup, you guessed it, it's got the taste to back it up too. Some citrus fruit can be tasted as well. Slightly oily mouthfeel. A very drinkable and extremely enjoyable IPA.  This is one of the best in the country folks. Awesome representation of the style. A very solid IPA. And the best part? I still have another bottle left!  Thanks to Dertbert for the bottle(s).

287,1093,neonbrown82,4.62,"Had to re-review this beer, as the first time I had it, it was of questionable age after having sat in the Iowa Beer Cache for quite some time -- original score: 3.8. Now that this beer is available in the state of Iowa, I have gone through several cases of fresh Two Hearted. It has actually supplanted Alpha King as my go-to beer, at least for the time being.  The beer pours to a light golden color with a slight peachy haze. Nice white head, though it doesn't last or lace all that well. Decent carbonation. Doesn't look all too impressive, but rest assured, there is liquid gold in that glass.  The smell is great. Has a nice lemony zest on top of the grapefruity centennial hop aroma. Slight malty sweetness below.  The taste is great. Very well balanced for an IPA. Great hops flavor without too much bitterness. Very refreshing. Very drinkable. Not too sweet, not too bitter or dry.  The body is medium to full with a crisp carbonation. Another great beer from Bell's. Make sure to check the freshness of your sample via Bell's Batch # lookup on their website, lest ye be disappointed in your old beer such as I was the first time I tried it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,thechaacster,4.57,"Pours a cloudy orange with a tasty looking foamy peach-colored head, lots of suspended yeast, and some cool looking cascading carbonation. Super sweet and fruity hop aroma, can't wait. Damn, this doesn't disappoint, either. A tasty, sweet, doughy maltiness is present but is beaten severely by the copious hops. Highly herbal and lemony, the bitterness is matched by a good measure of sweetness. As the glass empties, a serious coating of lace is left cemented to the inside. The finish is dry and bitter, but not at all unpleasant. I've not usually been much of a hop head, but this was delicious and amazingly drinkable. None of the wack aftertaste and mouthfeel I've experienced with some APAs and IPAs. Easily my favorite IPA yet.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,twilight,4.72,"This sample thanks to TastyTaste.  Pours a hazy, lazy orange with a thick head that dissipates and leaves lacing on the glass. Lacing and I haven't even taken a sip. Awesome. Aroma is overly citrusy with a noseful of hops. A soft aroma much like sticking your nose into a bag of Centennials.Yummy and floral Taste is softly citrus with a pine/wood finish that leaves that distinct hop bitterness on the palate. Lingers Lingers. Excellent full carbonation. I really could make this a session ale. Drinkability is hight. I've gotten these on trades and via friends, so I have a high reviewing expectation and it doesn't disappoint.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,macpapi,4.47,"Let me begin by saying that this beer has moved into my top three I.P.A.'s of all time. From first to last sip, it is phenominal. Starts off pouring a hazy-orange nectar, with a full-sized head. Bubbles lace the concoction from bottom to top, actively flowing through the glass. The smell is dominated by citrus aromas, along with a slight floral hint. Citrus again is most prominent in the overall taste, along with a notable malty kick. This is not the world's hoppiest I.P.A., but does have a bit of a bite to it. The best way to describe it is smooth to the extreme. In mouthfeel, it is full, but not overly heavy. Its carbonation remains throughout and the citrus flavors that come along with initial sips hold well throughout. There is a slight bitterness at the end of each quaff, adding to its appeal. Overall, I would say that this is an excellent beer, whose complexity and smoothness make it one to experience regularly.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,KarlHungus,4.57,"Pours a dark orange color with amber hues, and a large off-white head. Smells of pineapples and floral hops. The taste is very fruity and lively with nice hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Overall, this is a great brew. Its taste doesn't get old, and its aroma is wonderful.  --- Edit 2/22/09: Over the years I have come to love the the taste and aroma of this beer, but hate the after effects. This beer more than any other I have ever drank leads to a very bad hangover. I mean I can't drink more than one without having a terrible headache all day long the day after.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ViveLaChouffe,4.22,Picked up this bottle on a recent trip to Cleveland.  Pours a hazy copper with a creamy ivory head. Lots of draping lace down the side of the glass. Smells of cirtusy hops and light fruity malt.  Taste is dominated by intense floral and citrusy hops. There's some light pale malt crispness in there but this brew is all about the hops. And while the beer may be unbalanced the hops flavors are nicely balanced with each other. Bitter and sweet citrus intertwined. Long lingering bitter aftertaste and crisp. Taste leaves you craving more. Good stuff.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,RedwoodGeorge,4.53,"My god - I'm so impressed I almost don't know where to begin...  The pour is very good - a bright golden color with a large, sticky off-white head. The head dies down to a small cap which leaves lots of lacing as you go through the glass...  The smell is quite hoppy - plenty of new mown grass and citrus in this one. A bit of toasted grain as well so it's not that one sided but it's primarily hops, hops and hops.  The taste is exquisite... I keep going back and forth between rating it 4.5 or 5.0 Since it's not completely perfect I'll give it a less than perfect score - but just barely (I wish there was a 4.75!) There's a pretty simple but honest malt base here - grain/fresh bread with a bit of sweetness. The hops are ever present and they are -huge- but more importantly they're not overpowering and it's incredibly smooth. When I'm disappointed by an IPA it's usually because the brewer seems to have thought ""if I throw in too many hops, people will be impressed"" leaving a very unbalanced brew. This, on the other hand, is an incredibly balanced brew - plenty of subtle, complex hops notes of citrus, herb and pine with a taste I don't quite recognize but there's no doubt it's a hop.  As if the taste wasn't good enough, the mouthfeel is complete perfection. Even with the billowy head there's still plenty of fine carbonation in the beer and it couldn't go down any smoother. The feel is somewhere between velvet and silk and it's all good. No oily residue. No bitter aftertaste. Very light feel. Amazing that it isn't on tap - I've never experienced a bottled brew that has this feel.  Drinkability is off the scale. I'm already checking Mapquest to find out how far to Kalamazoo Brewing (2288 miles) This is one outstanding beer.

Fruity with some pine sap.  The taste is a hop head's dream. Powerful, juicy hops dominate from start to lingering bitter finish. The malts are way in the back, but make a contribution to the mouthfeel which is full for the style.  Lots of hops, but not too much to keep me from ordering more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Aroma is grapefruit, lemon, floral and grassy hops smells, with a light, bready malt background...quite appealing. The taste is equally impressive, a moderate hop bomb thats as balanced as can be expected. Flavors of grapefruit, pine oil, lemon rind and freshly cut grass makeup the hops side, with a nice, dry bread malt flavor that balances the brew very well. The mouhfeel is lusciously creamy with a crisp carbonated bite, the finish is dry, bitter and extremely refreshing. The drinkability is quite high, and i wish i had a few more.

287,1093,Bang34,4.59,"Pours a nice golden yellow/amber color with a thick white head that sticks around and leaves a nice lace on the glass. You can count how many sips you have taken by the number of rings on the glass.  The aroma is very nice and complex, floral is the first thing that comes to mind, with a little citrus and pine. Even a little fruity, there is a lot going on here, it is best enjoyed in a glass such as a tulip that concentrates the aroma as you drink.  The taste is what all IPA's should taste like in my opinion. Crisp and lite but still complex, dry and hoppy on the finish. Smooth for an IPA. A beginner might shy away at first but a developed palate will really appreciate the complexity.  Very drinkable, smooth and goes down easy, high carbonation but it allows the flavor to come out.  One of my favorite beers from one of the mid-west's best breweries.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Higravity,4,A solid beer that should be a main-stay of any MI local drinkers rotation. It pours an apricot color with a white head that leaves me some lacing. The smell is of strong hops with high AA and enough flavor to back them up. It has a nice malty base with sweet caramel flavors to build upon all the different hop flavor that come through. A deep bittering that yeilds to soft floral and citrus tones. The finish is a little over sweet.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,fingolfin72,4.54,"Hazy blonde color with a white, short-lived head.  I love the nose of this beer- Pine, butter, herbs, perhaps a faint hint of maple wood. The palate is bracingly bitter, with enough dryness to make this a food-friendly, session-friendly and non-cloying beer. The bitterness is faintly reminiscent of Campari, and the body is present but lean.

287,1093,DrJay,3.85,"Murky golden amber colour, topped by a half-inch slightly rocky, white head that shows good retention and some lacing. Definitely unfiltered, with small particulates in suspension, but clears up considerably as it warms. Hop aroma was evident as soon as I opened the bottle, a nice mix of citrus and spice. Mild malty nose as well, but this is only evident after it's been in the glass for a while. Malt sweetness to start, quickly followed by piney bitterness. Hop flavours (citrus and spice) show up part way through. The finish is quite long, dry and bitter, with more of a sharp orange peel flavour. High carbonation with a medium body and a bit of creaminess.

Tiny bits of hops can be seen in this one. Smell is of sweet malt, citrus, and pine. Taste is easily one of the smoothest, most balanced and tolerable IPA's out there. Citrus and piney hops mixed with a fine balance of sweet malt. Mouthfeel is smooth and mildly carbonated with a feel that starts at the front of the tongue and works it's way to the back of the tongue. Drinkability is great for IPA. No sting, all bling.

This is a cloudy beer between amber and gold in color. A very nice, sticky, resilient white meringue type head reminiscent of a good homebrew.  Wonderful citrusy hops in the nose upon smell and after the sip. Nice maltiness in the finish. Slight chewiness in the body but crisp enough in the finish to prepare me for the next sip.

287,1093,jp32,4.42,"Fun beer here. Pours a nice bronze color with a wonderfully distinct almost yellow colored head. The foamy layer suddenly dissipates, leaving strong lacings throughout. The nose is strong of hops paired with the fruity scents of oranges and mangoes. The taste is excellent. The flowery and orange tastes go quite well with what must be nearly the perfect amount of bitter hops. There is an aftertaste that reminds me of orange peels that almost lasts forever. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth. I really enjoyed this beer, although it seemed to taste quite different than IPA's I've had in the past. This one is interesting and definitly worth a try.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,karst,4.7,"Although I usually overrate beer, am sure that I have underrated this superb beer (maybe even its taste).  From the well cared for stock of 33 Wine shop and Tasting Bar - Thanks Jake for a great pour on this one as well as the Weizen Eisbock - great to see how well you take care of beer and all your customers (beer or wine).  White head. Light clear amber. Aroma ""is nothing less than a hoppy fruit explosion! A cornucopia of flavors bounce inside your nose and all along the tongue...grapefruit, strawberries,peach,apricot, melons, citrus, bananas,even. Delicate malt, providing ample balance.""  Extremely smooth with enought hops to please the hop head in me and not too much to offend those wanting to taste the malt and yeast flavors.

Vernon to scenic (sarcasm) Bedford Heights, a cask of this lovely nectar was ours for the taking.  The color is a dulled creamy orange with a miniscule head. Noticeable, but not uber-thick lacing of the glass. Toned down in the smell department from the bottle. Hoppy? Heck yeah. But not in the way I remember my bottled version. Citrus and floral hops are noted. Sugary sweetness in there as well. Fantastic flavor. The cask-conditioning makes for a silky smooth taste profile. Grapefruit detected, along with ripe fruit notes. Smooth finish. Not as pronounced hop bite as other versions. Here's a beer I could be happy with every day.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,swamiswamu,4.4,"Sure, it's a dry hopped Oberon, but it tastes amazing. This is one of the best non-West Coast hoppy beers out there. It pours a orangish hue with lots of head and plenty of lacing. The aroma lets you know what you are getting into. The hops dominate with a wheaty base. My only complaint is that this hop profile is awfully straight forward. Two hearted has always seemed like a homebrew gone terribly well. For a hop fix you can drink all night, this can't be beat.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,axisjones,4.27,"Pours a dusty amber, slightly hazy with a rocky slightly off-white head. The lacings got Jackson Pollack all over it, gorgeous all the way down. Decent head retention as well. Decept hop aroma, citrus and passionfruit. Its strong, but not overpowering. The first thing that hit me when tasting was the bready malt character, but then the hops slammed in. The hops are not overkill at all, and the malt balances nicely. After drinking a lot of west coast hop bombs, this brew is more restrained in the hop department, but it is no slouch either. The bready character is balanced with a citrusy grapefruit hop flavor with a clean bitterness in the end. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and lively throughout. Fluffy and clean all the way through. I could drink these one after the other, its well balanced and not tastebud suicide like so many other IPAs. Strong flavor but definitely not too strong. This was a damn good IPA, with a strong enough malt presence to keep the hops in check. Exceptionally crafted and highly drinkable. Toss me another feloniousmonk, thanks for the bottle!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Star80,4.57,"The beer is a cloudy yellow probably due to the fine layer of yeast at the bottom of the bottle, and moreover due to Bell's unfiltered nature. The head has an initial whipped cream-like appearance on first pour, then forms an everlasting wispy cloud-like patch on the top of the beer with lacing on the sides of my imperial pint glass. Even more noticeable is this beer's candy-like smell with some sort of strange interplay between the malts and the wonderfully smelling floral hops. Smells more like a gumball to me than Gumballhead! Taste is where it comes together in an interesting almost butterscotch candy sweetness (diacetyl alchohol) washed back with those bitter hops! I'm not sure if this is one of the great before or after dinner beers. Despite it's paler appearance this is one rich and filling beer at 6.0% abv. Mouthfeel is about where a beer like this should be, perhaps a tad thin.

Taste is along the same lines. Starts with a definite bready, biscuity malt but then taken over by some of the best hop flavors to be found, definite citrusy grapefruit, herbal, piney, etc., aggressive but very crisp, fresh and pleasant.

A slightly hazy orange body, fine carbonation streams, topped by three plus fingers of tight just off white foam, which ""rocky""-ed up above the rim.  Nose has a nice mix of floral and citric notes.  Nice assertive malty start, says ""this is beer, not just hop juice"". Of course, a beat later the hops crash the party like a swat team bursting through every door and window, pushing the malt away down the throat and taking over the room. Intersting hops too, not a grove of grapefruit, but an intriguing blend. The hops give a light sandpaper rub over the entire mouth and slowly almost fade away. Two hours later, there's still a bit of hoppiness tickling my tongue. Not overpowering, just enjoyable.  Nice mouthfeel, and damn great drinkability.

The smell is wonderful- powerful, floral, citrusy and a hint of pine resin. The taste gives more wonderful grapefruit along with the pine and flowery tastes, and just a hint of grass and spice. I've never tasted a hoppy ale that balances the different hop flavors so well; the bitterness is actually a little less than expected, but perfectly restrained. Oh, and don't forget the toasty, biscuity flavors that are underneath all those hops- yum. Feels full, coating the whole mouth. A few little hop burps follow after awhile (completely pleasant). Has a sticky feel as well that's very nice. I could drink these and drink these and drink these...  Overall, really incredible. The best of the American style IPA's that I've had.

Poured into my Powerhouse Brewery pint glass.  Appearance- Nice semi-cloudy orange pour with a very smmoth and creamy looking head that still has some remaining at the end of the glass. Above average lacing.  Smell- Definitely one of the best smelling IPA's I have put my nose too. Nice strong hoopy scent with a good amount of pine and a really sweet candied smell as well.  Taste- Hmmmm, was expecting much more hops. Nice malt and hops, but not huge. Very well balanced though. Good amount of pine and a bit of grapefruit. Not the huge amount I was predicting though.  Mouthfeel- Above average carbonation for an IPA.  Drinkability- This along with Stone IPA, are among the best balanced IPA's I have had.

The flavor is bursting with bitter hops and strong, tangy citrus notes. A crisp mouthfeel is followed by lingering bitterness as this one goes down.  This beer, while interesting, is one-dimensional, with overpowering hop bitterness from beginning to end. Ultimately, I think that it lacks the balance of some of other highly rated American IPAs like Masala Mama or HopDevil.

287,1093,nogoodreason,5,"Well, I kept resisting the urge to do so, but damn... here it is. I have to give this beer the big 5. There's simply not anything wrong with it. It's the perfect American IPA. Untouchable.  It pours out clean and clear (if poured carefully) with an agressive and sticky bone head. Color is reminiscent of a sunset or the flesh of a peach. The lacing sticks all the way down.  Oh, the nose on this beer. Oh my golly. Oh my gollly. It's like home-made shortcake, glazed with citrusey pulp, vanilla and orchid petals. Hoppy to the extreme but showing a wonderful sweet malt base.  It's full, but not fat or bloated in the mouth. Perfectly carbonated, keeping it light, but not thin... just right.  When it hits your tounge, it's citrus bitter, rolling directly into sweet shortbread and vanilla malts. Plenty of fruit character shows, with some apricot and other fleshy stone fruits. The hop flavor doesn't back off though, it's there, and very strong, a lucious mix of citrus fruits, grapefruit, satsumas (mmmm) and the lovely spring like flavor of flower petals. All of this is rolled up into an ellegant dance of malt and hops... perfection. Seriously.  This is a beer to cherish and savor slowly. Every sip is an excuse to inhale the insanely wonderful aroma and to roll this heavenly ale around your tongue. I can't see how this beer could get better.

287,1093,foXXtail,3.91,"This is a beautiful looking beer. It pours pale amber with just a touch of cloudiness and a medium-thick but very dense head. The lacing on this beer is something impressive  it practically leaves a sheet of foam all around the glass on the way down. Light estery aromas rise off the beer  honey and cherry are heaviest with a spice sting in the back ground.  The spicy hop and bright effervescence hit hard and heavy at the front, then gives way to honey and cherry sweetness with a touch of vanilla. The sweetness fades as the hops come back, this time piney, and linger on the palate as long as I would let them. I paired this with some strongly spicy jambalaya, and it held its own. Its quite a strongly hopped beer, but has a terrific hop/malt balance.

But there was this suspended cloud of yeast (?) floating around in the glass  nasty looking ! Aroma was OK, the citrus was nice, but the flora was too much for me. Flora also came across to strong in the flavor  citrus and hops were powerful and expected. Dont really like fruit in my beer, not that flower power.

287,1093,Gaisgeil,4.1,"My palate sure has come a long way in a mere 10 months. I definatly appreciate this beer a lot more than I did on my first review. Though, even then I could tell it was something special. It is certainly hoppy, but it is fairly balanced with a nice malt foundation, and that distinctive Bell's ale yeast lends something special to this refreshing thirst quencher. Grapefruity hops abound, very nice. Everything in my earlier review still applies, but I definatly underrated this beer before at a 3.6 overall.   == Original Review 2/28/05: This is easily one of the more drinkable IPA's I've ever had. Not sure that's saying much though....  Pours a medium toned gold in color with a two-fingered white head to compliment. Nose was piney, quite hoppy but with notes of citrus, almost lemony in a way. Taste was actually quite nice, and actually leaning toward the well-balanced side if you taken into consideration that it's an American IPA which tend to lean toward the mega overly hopped side in my honest opinion. Fairly enjoyable though and quite drinkable, and I don't really even enjoy IPA's that much.  Slàinte!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,oxmasterscream,4.5,"Yow. This one caught me off-guard with its uniqueness. Pours a slightly cloudy golden with a steady stream of tiny bubbles journeying upward toward a creamy, small but mighty head. Smells like a barrel of fresh hop flowers - seriously. It's maybe the most floral smelling beer I've ever had. The smell was so floral, it actually caused a sensory flashback to my days of homebrewing. Wicked. While still mostly floral, as it sat for a bit, a sweet apricot smell also began to emerge as well. Phew. Taste was as expected but somehow less severe than its aroma forecast: Way spicy up front, coupled with some sweet flavors that sit back and let the hops take charge but still keep them in some sort of balance. Can't put my finger on the sweet flavors but thankfully they're there. Maybe it's a kiss of honeysuckle. Finish is of sour lemon and then a puckering, bitter finish that forces another sip almost immediately after swallowing. If you let the bitterness sit in your mouth, it overtakes it and lasts and lasts and lasts, revealing some piney flavors late in the taste. For the first time in my life, I can't honestly say the hop burps sent a rush of tears into my eyes. Mouth is a creamy medium-bodied and chock full o' tightly knit, miniscule bubbles... a blanket of effervescence. This stuff is obviously one for the hop heads yet still completely embracable by someone like myself that requires some sort of balance. Why did I only buy one?!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,SupaCelt,4.12,This brew pours an orange color with a sparse mingling of chunky unfiltered goodness. A decent head forms and slowly recedes until it reaches a sustained level on the edge of the glass. Nicely carbonated. There is a requisite amount of lacing left around the circumference of the glass throughout sampling.  The smell is definitely dominated by hops. Huge orange juice aroma flies off the top of this beer. Grainy malt tones lie underneath. I actually sniffed down too deep and drew some right up into the old snot locker. That really revealed an interesting perspective. Smells good.  The first sip caused a smile to stretch across my face. Very nicely flavored. This one is not too over the top and could easily find acceptance with those who are not huge fans of the super bitter IPA styles. This is more of a fruity citrus hop showcase than an exercise in alpha acid. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. A nice wet start with a pleasant dry finish that is so crisp. Very enjoyable stuff. I will definitely add this to the repertoire. Drinkability is good as I can see myself putting a goodly number of these away with ease. Nice beer.

287,1093,Quaffer,4.12,"Picked this up in KC, MO. Not available here in Wichita.  Appearance: This beer poured a clear, golden amber color. Very tiny particles could be seen floating throughout the brew. After the whole bottle had been added to the glass, the sheer number of particles made the beer appear hazy, even though a chill haze was not present. The stark white head rose up easily to about two fingers and settled slowly, becoming fluffy as it did so. A thin skin of bubbles remained until the beer was gone. Tons of lace was left behind on the side of the glass  Smell: A great balance of juicy, citric hops and strong roasted malt. Just like a fresh hop cone balanced on a cracker and wrapped in a piece of bread. Lemon, vanilla, and hints of spice floated underneath. Very nice, overall.  Mouthfeel: Light- to medium-bodied. Its downfall was that it seemed a little watery at times. However, the smoothness and chewy maltiness gave it a nice presence anyway.  Taste: A mixture of sweet and astringent malt upfront. The hops kicked in with a vengence in the middle. They provided big citrus and floral flavors, as well as a nice dose of bitterness. The hops continued well into the aftertaste. Roasted malt arose on the finish to linger with the hops. Hints of spicy alcohol poked through in the aftertaste as well. A light acidity lingered underneath everything and gained strength in the finish.  Not a lot of complexity, but nevertheless very enjoyable. A good, solid IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BeerFink,4.5,"Pours a really nice amber color with some slight hazy, and a big frothy white head. The smell is a grand bouquet of hops, lots of clean juicy citrous, a little pine, and some wonderful floral qualities. Taste is crisp citrous hops that move towards a bit of spiciness towards the end. Subtle creamy malts attempt to back up the hops, but to no avail. Finish is dry and clean with citrous and spice. I am thoroughly enjoying this IPA! One for the hopheads from the boys in K-zoo.  After seeing them take their stouts to the next level (with Expedition), I would absolutely love to see a double IPA from Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Pours a beautiful, golden orange w/ a full finger of creamy, tan head after a subtle poor....impressive lace. Smells a bit sweet w/ hints of orange, grapefruit and vanilla. I can actually smell more malt than hops, which is reminding me of a Victory Hop Devil. Taste is bitter hops in a good way....not the sweet IPA I was expecting. Again, tasting grapefruit...very refreshing and well balanced.

287,1093,trumick,2.7,"This is a re-review. And, after opening and pouring I can already tell I am going to have to change it, somewhat.  Pours a pale, orange, cloudy color, nice 1/2 inch head with lacing all around.  Scent is of, sweet malt, knock me over citrusy hops and yeast.  Taste follows the nose with a very sweet, sugary malt flavor, supercharged citrus hops, and finishes dry. The last time I had this beer, the taste reminded me of Oberon. This bottle is not nearly as bad as Oberon. It's an ok flavor, but still unbalanced, and I would put Arcadia's and New Holland's IPAs (two more locals) above this one. If anything this is, at best, a below average, unbalanced, over-hopped, american ale.  Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, creamy, smooth but the carbination seems a bit on the low side for the style.  Drinkability is still on the negative side of the scale. I wouldn't go out of my way to seek this beer out. Hell, I wouldn't even buy it again if it were right in front of me, but if somebody handed me one at a party I wouldn't turn it down. That's not saying much, cause I wouldn't turn down a High Life either. The only way I would give this beer another chance is on tap or cask.  I still wouldn't put this beer on the Best of BA. There are at least a dozen others that should be rated above this average, boring pale ale. I like IPA's, NO, I really like IPAs and have sampled enough to know that TH would rank at the very bottom of that list. It's not terrible but it's not good either.

Taste and Mouthfeel: A smooth, bitter hop flavor mixes with a bit of a ""watered down"" malt flavor. The malts are too weak, but the hops are dead on. Spicy, floral, herbal, piney, the works. They all taste great and mix well. The mouthy feel is fizzy and fun.  Drinkability and Overall: I'm glad I picked up a 6'er of this stuff. Could kill it tonight without a problem.

The finish is almost abrupt but it is quite drinkable for the style.  Bonus- I called the brewery to ask about date codes. They do not date code just using sequential batch numbers.

Smell consisted a lot of herbal hops with an underlying of sweet malts to give a good balance. Some fruit can also be detected. Grapefruit and peaches are the big fruit aromas in this one.  Taste was good as well. A good amount of hops in this one, with a nice underlying malt to really balance this IPA out. You can tell that there's some piney hops, juicy and citrusy hops. But one doesn't override the other, which is very nice to see.  Mouthfeel had a creamy body to it. Mediumish body. Finished on the bitter side, but in a good way.  Truly a great IPA.

287,1093,mentor,4.74,"Goodness gracious! From a bottle, this is a fantastic beer. Fresh and on tap, this is truly incredible. Got to the brewery at last call in the middle of an 8 hour trip home for Thanksgiving, 2004.  A tiny head, poured by the friendly bartender made me wonder if there was a problem with their tap lines. It has a nice citrusy smell, but that is not the only smell. Some carmel and malt sweet comes with it.  Absolutely astounding to taste. Mouthfeel is medium with middle-of-the-road carbonation. The sting of tiny bubbles jumping off my tongue was a nice play with the hop bitter. While many IPAs hit with bitter and finish with a citrus and faint malt, this beer is incredibly well blended. As the hop bitter strikes, it is accompanied by grapefruit and smooth enticing barley sweet. I taste lighter fruits in the background. Apricot? Certainly some pear. As a homebrewer, I know the difference between fresh and aged beers. This beer was fresh and delicious. A+. I'll be stopping in every trip home for another. If you are anywhere near Bell's brewery, you have *got* to stop in for pint (or three).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,kmpitz2,4.75,"This beer pours a hazy orange color with 3 fingers of head that don't seem to want to fall. The nose is a nice grapefruit with a bit of caramel sweetness to balance the hops. Smells really good to me. The flavor is actually a bit peppery and citriusy. I think the peppery is from the hop as well as is the citrus. The malt is in there, but the hop dominates so that the caramel just seems to fade into the back. Damn I do like this beer. One of the better IPA's I've had in a while. The feel is just a shade below moderate, a touch thin for my liking, but its not thin. Overall this beer is easy drinking and much better than I remember from when I was not a seasoned beer drinker. Damn I like it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,rlcoffey,4.75,"Served on tap. Orange/copper color with a half finger of head. Hard head, it laced the glass as it went down. The smell is wonderful. All centenial hops wafting a wonderful aroma. I struggle with aromas, but this is just wonderful. The taste is immediately hoppy bitter, with just a touch of citrus, blending to a smooth finish. The citrus bite hangs around with a wonderful flavor. The malt/hop balance is perfect, while obviously leaning towards the hops. The only possible weakness may be a little hop film left on the mouth. The mouthfeel isnt quite up to the rest of the beer. Very drinkable, I can never have just one.  This may be the perfect beer. Okay, maybe not, but it may be the perfect AIPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,AlexJ,4.72,"Burnt amber pour with a mountanous peak of light beige head that retains like a champ and leaves cluttered clumps of lace.  Aroma is toffee malts, wildflower honey, and intense floral and citrus hops. Smell like I'm walking through a garden here! Sweet hop perfume, mmm.  Flavor is soft, caramel and scorched creme brule malt notes with a vigorous floral and citrus hop profile. Very well balanced, very hoppy, and oh so drinkable.  Body is between medium and large with a juicey, slick mouthfeel and soft, creamy texture. Very good all the way around!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,silenius,4.18,"Pours an amber haze with a massive creamy thick-n-rocky head that laces the bejeezus out of the glass. Particulate suspension is either yeast or some kind of chill haze.  Smell is classic Fruit Brute cereal. It is amazing that I remember that smell all these years after it was discontinuted. Damn you General Mills! In addition to the Fruit Brute, I get pine and orange peel and maybe a little Cointreau liquer. Nice.  Taste is a a light concoction of sweet malt and bitter hops. Nothing overpowering here but a decent balance. Perhaps the hop bitterness wins out.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Wonderfully light mouthfeel that makes it feel like whipped cream  These don't last long in my fridge!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,orbitalr0x,4.52,Pours out of the fishy bottle a nice golden amber with a fluffly head. The color is vibrant with a bit of haze as well. The smell is upfront with a bouqet of light floral hops mingling with lemon and grapefruit tones. A treat for my nose.  First sip is a tidal wave of wonderful hoppiness. The citrus/floral mix rushes over my palate and intertwines with a nice caramel malt background. Biterness is good and this is just a tasty IPA all around. Quite unique.  Mouthfeel is a good...nice and creamy body with plenty of carbonation..maybe even a little too much. Drinkability is very good here as well. An easy drinking IPA that would be great for session. Hoppy burps are good :-). If you love hops and you've yet to try this one....what are you waiting for??,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Beaver13,4.41,"The Two Hearted poured a hazy golden color. It had a thick fluffy white head that had great retention and lacing.  The aroma was grapefruity, apricoty, piney hops. A little on the subdued side, but nice.  The flavor was grapefruity malts with a hoppy, bitter finish that dominated more as it sat and warmed. Just the right balance of hops, fruitiness and malts. It had a smooth and velvety mouthfeel.  Overall, an excellent IPA. A little more subdued than I expected, but very drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,longarm,4.11,"Pours a somewhat cloudy and dingy yellow with great lacing and carbonation.  The aroma is top notch and what hop lovers crave. Lots of citrus, leaning more towards tangerine and orange doses rather than grapefruit.  Hops seems to dominate the flavor, but doesn't detract. Light malt flavors give it a touch of sweetness but this doesn't overbear either, since some hop bitterness keeps it in check. Two words...terrifically balanced.  The body is relatively thin given the amount of flavor. Citrus flavors oddly seem to give it a little more body (is that possible???). Maybe it's the tangy aftertaste. I haven't heard of mouthfeel changing from hop flavors, but it seems to be having an effect on body and finish.  Confession that this is one of my favorite beers at the moment. It's very easy to drink and a standby when I get a craving for hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,feloniousmonk,4.35,"Two firkins of the cask-conditioned stuff found their way to the bar at Bryant-Lake Bowl, and the beer cognoscenti of Minneapolis flocked to fill their mugs. I had a pint of the regular tap first, and some still rested in the glass when the ""real arrived"", giving me the chance to sample them side by side. Appearance is darker, a heavier orange/amber, and the head to slim for a freshly tapped Two-Hearted. I've poured some of those with gorgeous froth that sat on the glass like soft-serve ice cream, proud as pudding. So, I missed that... Aroma is nice, but not as pungent as the tap. Taste is the difference. Where the tap gives you the hops on the palate in a brisk spike, a frisky tingle, then mellows and moves out, leaving nothing bu clean, smooth drinkability, this cask version keeps the hops at play throughout the duration. The body is the main thing affected, and it's creamy, but not too much, for this is Two-Hearted. (I drink the stuff almost every single day, I should know!) Drinkablity is big, too, and the character is really key. This was an excellent pint, a big difference, though, blast me down if you must, if prefer the CO2 version. I like that hop attack...but there's something to be said for both...hope to have it again at some other occasion in my lifetime!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Dithyramb,4.4,"This 12 oz brown bottle arrived on my doorstep via BIF XV. There is no freshness date to be found. A very artful fish (trout?) is on the label. Apparently, the beer is named after a river in Michigan, which was in a short story by Hemmingway&#8212;he&#8217;s referenced on the upper label, but I thought he was a liquor man? The label on their website has two fish, so I&#8217;m not sure if what I have is old or new.  I decided to try this beer as I sat down to watch game 7 of the ALCS. Like the crowd of navy hats in the Bronx stands, the off-white head was densely packed. It very quickly dissipated to a patchy lace. It was difficult to tease a head from subsequent pours, but that might have been because of my glass instead of the beer. Rings of carbonation lined the brew and a thin lacing traced down the glass. The body of the beer is a hazy golden color. I might be crazy, but I thought I saw a few errant chunks of yeast swirling around in my last pour from the bottle.  Giant floral and citric hop aroma.  First of all, I drank at least half the pint before paying any attention. Was it the crisp, clean, IPA goodness, or was it the excitement of the Sox defeating the Evil Empire? The hops bum rush your taste buds and quickly leave a sharp citrus acidity. Once you slow down, and allow it to smother your taste buds before swallowing, you really enjoy the moderate body of the brew. Although predominantly green hops in flavor, there is a mild bready maltiness in the flavor that is evident in the middle. Substantial, diaphragm-shaking hop belches on the back end.  This is an excellent IPA and it is clear why it is a favorite of the hopheads out there. It is now my third Bells beer and I haven&#8217;t been disappointed with any. It actually caused me to go on their website to see where they are found. Now that I know they are available in PA, my work trips there next month will have new meaning. This is a devilishly good session beer, of which I need more&#8230;",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,oracle,3.59,"I got there the day after this cask was tapped. I believe this was a hand pumped cask as well.  It seemed to have lost something. Normally this is one of my absolute favorite beers, but this one left me a little unfullfilled.  Beer was a medium cloudy yellow, almost the color of a hefe-wiezen. Small head the disappated rather quickly.  Smell was weaker than expected as well. The strong hops presesence was still there, but I detect little else.  The taste seemed a little down as well. Hops and carmelized malt, but little of the mild fruity sweetness I've grown used to in a Bell's Two Hearted.  Very low carbonation (most likely due to the hand pumped cask).  Next time I'll just go for the regular bell's two hearted and skip the cask-conditioned stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Brian700,3.85,"This beer pours a nice pale color and has about a quarter inch head that slowly fades into a ring around the glass. Minimal lacing this time but I remember it lacing more when I had it on tap. The smell, Wow. As soon as you pop the top on this beer you are hit by a tremendous hop smell. Smells like Northern Brewers hops if my nose serves me correct. Probably a Northern/Cascade mix. I don't know for sure but thats what it smells like. The taste definately follows the nose. It drastically goes from sweet to bitter. The bitter plays its part as soon as it gets to the back of the tounge. You can pick up on the oilyness probably because this is such a heavily hopped beer. Just above average mouthfeel. Good carbonation and its flavor coats your mouth and lingers quite a bit. Its a pretty powerful beer so I usually don't try to drink to many of them in a sitting without changing it up. It's definately a treat of a beer none the less. A good beer from a good Brewing Co. Very popular in my neck of the woods.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,GuinnessSmurf,4.37,"Golden yellow color in the glass with a nice big ol' layer of medium bubbles on top. Hops smell takes over the immediate area as soon as its poured. The flavor is a real hop mix. It starts off with a bit of mild/sweet hops and malts then quickly turns to a sharp bitter in the same taste. I'd guess that is why its a Two Hearted Ale. It sweet-talks you, then stabs you with hops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,brewnut11,4.08,"I love IPA and have heard a good deal about this brew. It appeared lighter in color than I imagined, but a nice hazy dull organge color. I've had IPA's that have much more aroma than 2 Hearted Ale. I was a little disappointed with the aroma. There is aroma but my expectations were much higher. (I'm a hop head) After being a little disappointed with the aroma, the taste made up for my disappointment. A very good hop bitterness, more than most IPA's. The hop bitterness jumps out at you, making this a hop lovers delight. It tastes a little thicker (more mouthfeel) than alot of the other IPA's. A good class beer, have two before you drink something of lesser value.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,rdrummer,3.75,"I waited a long time to get my hands on a bottle so I'm trying to be fair. The beer probably could never live up to my expectations. It was a good example of an American IPA but I did not find it to be as exceptional as I hoped. It poured a light amber color with a huge head that ebbed quickly. There was almost no lacing. The aroma was hoppy, but not like I expected it to be. It was highly carbonated with hints of malty sweetness and some fruitness.  The taste was more hoppy than the aroma. It had a nice bitter appeal with balance added by a sweet maltiness and some citrus undertones. The beer was medium bodied, bubbly in the mouth. I had no real desire to have a second one, which is rare for most beers that I drink, and extremely rare for an IPA.  cotton candy, orange, peach, and light hops to it.  The flavor is roasty and malty. Some sweetness but very little hoppy bitterness. The floral accents and tanginess of the hops come through beautifully, but this is not an over-hopped beer that kicks you in the mouth with bitterness. Very subtle and sweet.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,meathookjones,4.6,"After a bad experience with their Cherry Stout I had to try something else a little more redeeming. This poured out a slightly murky golden orange with a tall white rocky head. As the head shrank into the body scattered lacing was left to coat the glass. Very hoppy aroma with citric and floral hops coming out in abundance. There was a slight hint of malt to it at times. Taste was very similar very hoppy all the way through this one with citric and earthy flavors coming together for a great taste. A bitter hoppy aftertaste is how this ended. Mouthfeel was creamy with about a medium body. I could drink this all day, great flavor and aroma too bad I only picked up 2 bottles. Highly recommend to all hop heads and anyone that likes a good brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ncbrewerbun,4.3,"This is the lowest I've graded a Two-hearted IPA. It's been one of my top 5 beers for the last many years.  The beer poured a very clear straw-to-golden color. Watch out as you pour, though, it's bottle conditioned. Inhale deeply over the glass and you get the clean hop grapefruity aroma wafting up.  I remember more hop flavor in previous samples of this beer. So, the hop intensity isn't there in this sample,but it's nicely balanced. I hope Bells didn't mess with the recipe when they changed the label on the beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,rugger,4.57,"I love a good IPA. This is a no-brainer as I love it too. Pours a nice hazy copper with a nice lacy head. Has the aroma of nice citrusy hops which makes me smile every time. The taste isn't as hoppy as I thought it would be but it is nice and crisp with a nice citursy hop flovor, almost a lime taste to it. Anyway this beer is what people claim that it is, but I am happy that there are others out there that are easier to find. I love hops therefore I am biased to any hoppy beer. Respect HOPs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Gavage,4.92,"Finally I was able to find this brew and boy am I glad I did. The brew pours a slightly hazy orange color with a thick 2+"" head. Nice lacing develops through the drink. Carbonation levels seemed just right. The aroma was huge as floral hops, malt, and orange zest leaped out of the glass. The flavor followed the nose, as the thick sweet malt was perfectly balanced with floral bitterness and oranges.  The mouthfeel was mildly crisp at the start and finished with a smooth bitter citrus tone that lasted shortly on the tongue. Medium in body. This is a beer that could be quaffed all day long. Super brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Sort of pine-y. Taste: Hoppy, citrusy start..hoppy, drier finish. Nice maltiness, too, mainly noticed in the finish. Mouthfeel: Much better than average, though I was expecting, perhaps, a bit more body than this. Maybe it's just been so long since I've had one of these. Drinkability: Very high.

The aroma has cotton candy, orange, peach, and light hops to it.  The flavor is roasty and malty. Some sweetness but very little hoppy bitterness. The floral accents and tanginess of the hops come through beautifully, but this is not an over-hopped beer that kicks you in the mouth with bitterness.

287,1093,Rio,3.92,"Pours a hazy, cloudy color of gold, maybe leaning a bit towards a wet straw color. Decent head formed, a bit of an off-white color, which thinned out to a nice layer across the top that looks like it's gonna hang around a while.  Smell is heavy in the hops, bit of a hint of spice hidden behind there. Moderate thickness to it, smooth and crisp, leading off with a bit of a malt taste, and giving way to the hops. The end is a bit too bitter and dry for my taste.  I think this is a very drinkable beer. Not too heavy, feels pretty good in the mouth, though that dry bitterness at the end may be a bit of a turn-off.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Sweet and resiny. Floral and citrus notes. Very slight alcohol nose.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Slightly sweet at start to a huge hop presence. Awesome resiny, citrusy complex hop profile. Fades quite fast with a clean finish. Medium body.  Drinkability: Top 3 on my list of IPAs, and definitely the most drinkable. Was surprised to find it was only 6% ABV, felt stronger than that.

When I describe this beer as a hidden treasure I am referring to the fact that I kept reaching for other beers for the last few weeks before I decided to try this beer. To me this beer embodies the characteristics of a wonderful IPA, I would rank this as an all time favorite IPA.  Appearance: The beer poured into the pint glass with a meringue head. The original inch of head diffused until there was a quarter of inch leaving artistic lacing patterns around my glass. The color of the beer seems to be a straw with a beech tone.  Smell: The floral spiciness that is followed by the rich grapefruit hops aroma is captivating.  Taste: Very enjoyable as you roll the beer over the tongue dispersing the spicy tanginess.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation seems to spread the beer throughout the crevices of my mouth as the hops revitalize the taste buds. You must be prepared for this beer, some might find this as unpleasant.  Drinkability: This is one drinkable beer. I would gladly buy more of this beer and enjoy it when I am looking for a really solid IPA to sooth my hoppy cravings.

The head dissipated rather quickly, leaving an appealing lace down the side of the glass. This beer had a wonderful hop aroma; slightly bitter, but not at all obnoxious. I also noticed subtle citrus and wheat components.  The first taste was quite good. It had a somewhat sweet initial flavor with a rather tame hop bite going down. This beer had a pleasant and surprisingly complex set of flavors for an IPA. Usually, I've tasted hops, more hops, or 'I can't choke this down anymore' hops, and nothing else. But this one was definitely the exception.  This was a good American IPA and for those who like the style will find this one extremely drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

There's some tea-like sweetness from the malt and followed with a big smackdown of hops that somehow taste sweet, almost like pineapple. Very floral and citrus-like while maintaining a good balance. Its only flaw is a metallic twang; like having a penny in your mouth as you drink it. This could come from oxidation of the hop portion of the beer. Its very enjoyable and well carbonated. I liked it better on-draught.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

It is full of floral hops and earthy malts. The taste is good. It has a very bitter hop flavor followed up with some pale malts and a dry finish. The mouthfeel is fine.

Not bitter, but full of hops flavors. They dance around in your mouth and interact. Citrus, pine, etc. I'm not sure what kind of hops they are using but it seems fresh and wonderful.

The aroma was citric and sweet, a great hop aroma that really made me excited to get my lips on the glass. The taste was rewarding, a nice balance and not overly bitter. It had some sweet cirtic bites that went well with the hops. An overall great IPA. I wish I was back in Michigan and could find it on tap.

Aromas of piney, resiney, and citrus hops along with light malt dominate. Initially this beer hits up front with sweet citrusy hops and a caramel toffee malt body. Following, more hops just come into play leaving a zesty piney flavor that just lingers on the tongue. This beer finishes hoppy and sweet, with some more zest and yet a final lingering bitterness that just makes it perfection.

Nose is a wonderful candied smell, combining apricot and rose in what is the best smelling IPA to date for me.  First hit on the palate is hoppy and perfumed, with an almost rosebud taste to it. Midsip balances out with a sweet, candied malt flavor. Perfume flavors are almost too much here, but luckily they don't linger in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is good, with medium carbonation. Slightly resinous from the sugars but this doesn't detract at all.  Rather easy to drink. Might have scored higher here if not for the rather perfumed feel of it.  Overall, I can certainly see why this is so highly rated. Just a bit too much perfume for me to place it on the throne, but I would certainly have this again if given the chance.

Fresh citrus nose - tangerine and lemon juice with a musty hop aroma. I'm surprised at the maltiness of this beer, actually; I thought I'd be in for more hops than anything else. Don't get me wrong, this beer brings the hops, but a caramel malty presence makes itself known. Citrus fruit abounds in the flavor as well, and this seems to be slightly fuller and creamier than many of its other American counterparts. Very very well balanced, though being the hop addict I am I could ask for a bit more in the bitterness department. But now I'm being a pain in the ass...this is a great beer, and extremely drinkable at that.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

In the background was a slight malt presence.  The flavor was muted with the same citrusy/coriander flavor, but malt and hops are in well achieved balance with just a slight nudge toward hops which makes the beer extremely drinkable. The complexity of the flavor increases as the beer warms.  The finish was dry and citrusy well into the aftertaste.

This baby looks thick, and sports a very nice pillowy, creamy head that features tons of stick and gobs of splotchy lace. Aromas are at once citrusy, orange and lemon dominate. The mouthfeel is medium to full with ample crispness and a nice bitter tang. Flavors favor the citric end of the hop spectrum, though ample malt nuances serve to balance this fine beverage.

Smell was very citrusy, like grapefruit, or tangy oranges. Maybe a little peach as well. Taste corresponded with smell. There is definite bitterness as well that is quite delightful, also a bread-like characteristic. Nice carbonation that sparks the flavor. Mouthfeel is light to medium, more towards creamy than watery, but neither of two extremes. The finish is dry and bitter . oddly, this could be a rather refreshing brew despite the dryness. Mmm. good beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mattcrill,4.22,"Pours a cloudy yellow/amber color with a billowy white head. Beautiful lacings all the way down the glass. Smells floral and hoppy. The aroma definitely tells me this is going to be a punch-in-the-face IPA. Taste is wonderfully dry, hoppy, and bitter. A little floral, bready, citrus after-taste. Goes down great on a hot day. I know people are very critical of over-hopped IPA's and I could see why people would put this two-hearted in that category but I found this to be quite enjoyable. I would recommend this one to all.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,deejaydan,3.81,"The IPA from Bells. Well, if you like hop squeezins, this should be your cup of tea. I love the look of this in the glass, nice pale yellow color, frothy white head. It looks like it was dry hopped to me. Smell and aroma are, well, hops.... very close to over the top for me, I could barely pick up any malt at all. A solid beer, but a bit too much hop juice for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mobyfann,3.6,"Paid $1.79 for a 12 oz. bottle...  The appearence is very nice, a hazy-like lager colored base with a beautiful lumpy ultra-thick head that retains very well and a few signs of lacing is there too. The aroma seems very nice but all I got out of it was sweetness and fruitness, still good, but I found it more undefined than most brews.  The taste is pretty good, a little heavy on the carbonation and a bit heavy of the alcholic taste as well, pretty hoppy but still fairly refreshing. The mouthfeel is ok where 'all the above' in the taste comment applies here... but it still doesn't go down too smooth. The drinkability is pretty good for an IPA, nothing more.  Final Thought: I was a bit disappointed by this, I was assuming a competator brew with Stone IPA but it didn't even compare. Still a pretty quality brew from a top notch brewery!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ken3c,4.4,Golden color with a good head. Bubbles are varied in size and creates a very unique lacing with every beer. Head lasts throughout.  Smell is incredibly floral and pleasant.  Taste is very well rounded. Not too bitter but very tasty.  Very nice carbonation from the bottle conditioning produces a very nice bubbly mouthfeel.  The bottle warns that it needs to be decanted and you should heed that advice. The last sip is quite bitter and not as pleasant as the rest of this beer. Leave it in the bottle.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,egajdzis,3.78,"This bottle poured a hazy gold color with a white head and nice lacing on the glass. Mild citrus hop aroma. Sharp, tart, and bitter citrus hop taste. Very West Coast like IPA. It is possible that this bottle may have aged some. I wonder if a fresh one would bring out more in the aroma and flavor department?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Lupe,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy golden peach topped with a frothy white head thay leaves nice lace behind. Bold aroma that combines citrus and floral hops, herbal notes, and fruit. Bitterness greets your palate along with grapefruit and other citrus flavors. As the hop assault back away, a bready-biscuity maltiness shows up along with some fruity sweetness. Floral hops come in next to tie things up. Finishes with a puckering dryness. Well balanced for an American IPA, bitterness is assertive, but does not overpower. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, medium-full in body. Highly drinkable, goes down with surprising ease. A damn good IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,DPMomutant,3.68,"A fairly aggressive pour does produce a big head on this one, but it normally gets a decent-sized head anyway. It sits on top of a cloudy golden colored brew. This is healthy in both head retention and lacing.  The smell is very hoppy and citrusy. Not a big surprise for an IPA. Does smell stronger than the ABV suggests.  The taste is pretty true to the smell. Citrus in front and hoppiness in the end. The taste is good but I can't find more characteristics to it.  A very good mouthfeel to this beer. Carbonation is lively but not excessive. The body is smooth and full. Finish is fairly dry.  Although the taste is not spectacular, the beer is good enough for a session and is, fortunately, not too big so you can enjoy a few.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BobLuvBeer,4.62,"Straw to Orange in color. Has the cloudy appearance of a weiss. Pours with a thick, foamy head, which settles into a nice layer of suds. Noticeable lace throughout. Strong citrus hops on the nose. Initially a nice balance of hop with malt on the tongue. Hops remains dominant however, and overtakes the palate. The hops do a dance in the mouth which goes as: First to play is flavorful, floral to citrusy hop then blends nicely into a tangy bitterness, which melts and coats the mouth. The bitter flavor lingers and slowly fades away, leaving just a trace of its original flavor on the back of the mouth and edges of the cheeks.

287,1093,Sammy,4.3,"Excellent world class IPA. Very crisp and lemony citrus. Grapefruit Bitter sipping with fruity salt, and bitter aftertaste with high but effective complementary hops.

287,1093,shapudding,3.6,"Gave a nice strong pour and got a ton of beaten eggwhite head, from the sides though, you could see the bubbles getting larger . Head settled down fairly quick to a reasonable quantity and seemed to have a little density to it. Scented of grapefruit and slight pineyness. Medium golden, good amount of carbination. There is alot going on in that pint glass, tons of sediment all over. Whispy to no lacing.  Nice little bite of hops, grapefruit rind, some spiceyness. Bit of fruit flavor playing around in the background, but not so that it stands out much. Nice malt flavor. Good light body with great drinkability, nice session beer, goes down very easy!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,UnionMade,4.25,"The beer pours a hazy, burnished gold, a thick, nearly white froth blooming with a vigorous pour. The yeast is well integrated, creating an even haze. The head settles into a large bubbled, splotchy mist, keeping all the way through. Large clumps of sticky lace cling to the glass. The aroma is dominated by a greasy, oily hopping. Huge amounts of pine and grapefruit, similar to a double IPA in it's strength. Some floral and herbal notes, the hops almost sweetish in their juiciness. Plenty of toasty, sweetish malt bolster the hops, with a soft touch of floral and pear esters. A good deal of apricot, along with a touch of orange. The flavor blooms with fruit and malt immediately, tons of peach and apricot sailing atop a base of toasty sweetness. A bit of cereal graininess right up front, along with powdery yeast, adding a slightly unrefined touch to the mouthfeel. The fruity sweetness continues into the middle, meeting the first traces of hop flavor, mostly a soft floral tone. Gobs of white grape and pear, sliding into an oily, rather piney hop finish. Grapefruity citrus, with a touch of orange juice sweetness, adding a moderate amount of bitterness. Certainly balanced. The swallow reveals a bit of alcoholic warmth, rather fruity in nature, completing the beer with a last bit of sweetness. A soft residue of sugar cookie dough-like yeast. A lingering apricot flavor, with piney hops clinging to the tongue for ages. Medium bodied, with a gentle, easy-going carbonation, just enough to move the brew across the palate. The mouthfeel starts out grainy, changing to an oily, soapy slickness, and dries out a bit in the end with a powdery yeast texture. A splendid IPA, unlike any other I've tried, with it's fruity character. The balance is perfect, and the slightly unrefined feel adds to the beer's charm. Bell's makes some awesome beers, and this is one of their best. Do not go to Michigan without bringing home a sixer of this.

287,1093,Gritsak,4,"medium hazy orange with a fluffy white head  smells is strong of hops and spices  taste is wow with hops..very strong up front and never lets down.  good amount of carbonation with a faily thin mouthfeel  pretty easy to drink one or two at a time...but anymore would sacrafice the unique taste for me.  pretty damn good, and definitely different. it takes similar to other IPA's that ive had, but stronger and more crisp.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TheOtherMike,4.72,"Be careful pouring this one and many (most/all?) of the Bell's. There's about 1/8 inch of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. I always pour very slowly and stop when the sediment is about to leave the bottle - it definitley spoils the appearance and (IMO) the taste as well.  Other than that - I love this beer! The smell is very much IPA, but it has a very unusual taste. Almost too strong - right on the border between great and bizarre, which makes it interesting.  The mouthfeel is a bit harsh - acidic? I don't know - but that's why I reduced the drinkability too. Smell & taste keep me coming back. Sediment and mouthfeel give me pause.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,rajendra82,4.4,"Very cloudy golden color with a tall foamy heady that would do a Duvel proud. The underlying natural carbonation is steady and delicate. The aroma is fresh hops with pine resin and hay. The taste is that of pine resin and pepper like hop heat tempered with the flavors of mandarin orange, caramel malt, and the gritty, earthy yeast. The beer is creamy smooth like a stick of butter melting on your tongue. This is a very good and well balanced IPA that lacks a lot of complexity, but turns that into a strength rather than a weakness.  Thanks Foxman for making this one a part of the BIF 7.0 package. I owe you one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,aracauna,4.12,"Hazy amber with tiny suspended particles. A good sandy head. The aroma starts off a ragged tangle of citric centennials.

287,1093,studentofbeer,4.43,"Today I pulled out a Bell's Two Hearted Ale, which is labeled an ""India Pale Ale style well suited for Hemingway-esque trips to the Upper Peninsula"" in the description on the back of the label. The beer is apparently a reference to Hemingway's ""Big Two-Hearted River""a story I've never read.  Still, I had the beer, and that might be enough.  The pour produced a giant foamy white head, flat and dense, that made its way most of the way to the top of the imperial pint glass. The nose is all Centennial (I orginially thought Cascade) and has grapefruity, citrus scents. You get a hint of bready malt, but whew, those hops knock you out.  As for color, it's a hazy, dirty yellow when you look straight through the glass, and a light, nice burnished brass color when you look down through more liquid.  A sip reveals a substantial but relatively relaxed bitterness, with some lemon, fruit and bread providing a backbone. Nonetheless, the hops are the star of the show, and leave a lasting hop-flavor bitterness in the aftertaste that doesn't go away. The beer laces beautifully.  The beer weighs in at 6 percent, but the body feels rather light. The beer seems to just slide happily down my throat, a tribute to its superb balance of hop flavor, bitterness and malt, as well as a soft carbonation and lasting creamy head that keep the beer very smooth.  The body of the beer and the seductive creaminess are what set this beer apart. The flavors and aromas are rather straightforwardstrong hop flavor and bitterness with a bready malt background and a burst of fruit sweetness. That direct appeal and the subtle, creamy texture make this a great choice for a warm day.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,nortmand,4.37,"Fluffy, ""marshmallow"" head on top of a cloudy yellow-orange body. The scent is dominated by grapefruit hoppiness, but a hint of malt is there too. Very hoppy in the start of the drink, but a malt presence becomes more pronounced on the back of the tongue. Definitely very smooth and drinkable, one of the gems in the Bell's line of beers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ngandhi,4.31,"Pretty much exactly what a pale ale should look like. Like holding a glass of solid amber covered in snow. Great lacing.  The smell is hoppy and tropical. Hints of mango, cotton candy, and a lot of pine.  Obviously hoppy and remarkably comlex with a wonderfully rich malt profile to back it up while never taking the focus away from the hops. It seems that only one hop was used, but its use, in different stages of brewing, is first-rate and really shows how far you can push the most basic of things. The bittering is perfect, just barely smoky at the end, and quite calm on the back of the tongue for an IPA. The flavors are endlessly developing, Cascadey, but far, far more refined. Sugary, floral, and delicious. There's faint rose in the background on the tongue and palette. I really love the rose finish. Candied lemon. If you compare it to something like HopDevil, this is in a league of its own. HD has similar qualities, but nothing in terms of balance. Here, the multitude of hop and yeast fruitiness combine to make a new flavor unto itself.  I appreciate the maltiness of this brew. It mellows out the flavors and gives us all the bitterness and aromatics an IPA should have, without the pain. Two Hearted goes down the way really fresh apple juice does and has, indeed, many juice-like qualities including its body.  Relax, relax. ng",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Soybomb,4.43,"appearance: Pours a nice gold color with a 1.5"" fluffy head that drop but sticks around for a while and leaves a nice lacing. I did expect it to be a bit darker given its an IPA.  smell: Hops, hops, and hops. I kinda wish other aroma's jumped out at me here.  taste and mouthfeel: Delicious. Starts out with a bit of sweetness then you're hit with hops and citrus flavors. Medium-high carbonation makes a nice crisp finish with lingering cirtusey after taste. Probably just getting into the medium bodied catagory.  notes: My first IPA was Samuel Smiths and I thought I liked it. Since then I've tried others but the blend of flavors in this just really won me over. I love it and so far its my first choice in IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,blitheringidiot,4.45,"Dang near a perfect pour into my English Beamish pint glass. A hazy golden orange pour with a perfect 3 inch head that is so high and tight that it made a cone shape when I poured the beer through it to fill the glass. This deserves a 5/5 pour, leaving a total lattice head coating.  Smells of a grand IPA. Lush floral bouquet erupts to my nose delivering various juicy fruits and spicy cloves interspersed. You could even say that there is a strong lemon in the nose.  Flavor flows quite freely with fruity hoppiness and spices. Rich mature full spices and zesty acidic feel. This has a top quality IPA candy like aftertaste similar to a nice Sweet Tart (in a good way) The finish is dry, tart and lasting, reminding me to have some more. A great tasting IPA, retaining a solid foamy coating that looks good enough to eat with a spoon. This offering lasts in the glass with zip and zest to the hoppy bitter end.  Last swigs: Reminds me of STONE Ruination IPA most of all. Orangey hoppy zest and looks tastey too. Built like a champ.I finally snagged a mixed case of BELLS thanks to Beeryard, for a reasonable $58. The mixed case had 4 x 6 different strong BELLS beers. Awesome deal. Two Hearted ranks up there with VICTORY Hop Devil and 3FLOYDS Alpha King. Nice!  Wow! this is tasty! And a well hidden ABV ta boot.  *** UPDATE *** Thanks to SkinnyElvis for the offering. Second pour in a pilsner is just as good. I mean Goood! Standing by my prior review.  Beer is good. Happy & hoppy beering.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,soilguy,4.92,"WOW. This beer pours a beautiful cyrstal clear orange hue. Immediately one is struck by the strong, floral hop aroma. It is but a sweet segue into the awesome taste experience. Initial hop bite, followed by a citrusy hop flavor, backed up with just enough malty sweetness to be noticed but not enough to intrude on your hop experience. I could drink way too many of these at one sitting. This ale has displaced the Hopdevil as my new favorite IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Trentonator,4.06,"Pours a deep amber/orange with a nice white head, and a long lasting lacing that coats the glass nicely. I give a perfect 5 for the appearance of this unique brew. It's fascinating, it has hues of gold, orange, copper and white, it's almost like looking at a sunrise-beautiful! Smell is very fruity, lots of hops, maybe some floral undertones. Taste has a definite IPA bite to it, coppery, bitter, but yet still a nice mouthfeel. I could knock back a few of these, I think this is my new fave IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ppoitras,4.4,"12oz bottle obtained via trade with CRJMellor. Thanks for the opportunity...  Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" bright white head above a slightly (but only slightly) copperish golden brew. Head had reasonable staying power, and laced excellently. Aroma is about spicy hops, and there's probably some malt in there, but that's not the point. Smells like what I would imagine something out of the DFH Randall would. The taste is as well all about the hops, but there is enough pale malts to round the corners and keep the taste buds alive. Also slight citrus notes are present. It impresses me that such a hop monster remains quite smooth and imminently drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Redrover,4,"I had this beer at the Matchbox in Chicago. This has got to be one of the smallest bars I have ever seen. Im guessing the official capacity must be about 20 people.  Beer poured a lighter than expected gold with a thick head and great lacing. I was expecting a slightly darker beer given that it is an IPA.  Nice pine & citrus aroma. Clear use of quality ingredients.  The taste was fine, but seemed a little on the light side for an IPA. Still it is a very tasty beer with a bracing hop bite and nice puckering citrus taste. The beer also seems to posses a nice malt backbone to keep things balanced.  Mouthfeel and drinkability are both fine. I was expecting something different, but was not disappointed by this one. It is a keeper and one I would love to try on tap.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,koolkat,3.78,"It pours a nice blonde with a minimal head. The Hops are rather noticible, but it isnt all that aromatic more of a nice bitter twinge at the end of the gulp.  here is a very slight DMS smell present but it isnt tastable possibly due to the hops. The hops are very well pronounced, but mostly in the bittering department.  As far as drinkability goes if you're a hophead this would be excellent as it has a nice bitter twinge and isnt heavy but if youre not a hophead I think that the hops might become overpowering after a bunch.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Rastacouere,3.64,"So in my glass is the famous Two Hearted IPA. It looks good, potent dark sun yellow, lightly hazy, with a great very foamy and rocky white head, highly carbonated in appearance. Acute citrusy C-hops nose, very flowery, sweet, sour, hints at lemon pie, lilac (orval anyone?), grapefruit, grass. Solid toasty/cookie malt attack early like a good pils, quickly complemented by the direct floral and citrusy hops. Great flavor development for an IPA, but you know where they're from, hophead's neck of the wood and always lacking a touch of ""multidimensionality"". Tremendous velvety texture, less carbonated than anticipated. Clean and long oily bitter finish. Quite good, but top 100 in the world? I think not. Maybe a top 10 IPA though. Thanks Jeff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Crosling,4.77,"Clear Light peach. The head is dense, creamy and rocky but subsides to a thin layer of cream floating on the top.  Huge vibrant and bursting aroma of candy sweetness, kettle popcorn, cotton candy, wet oak, bright fruitiness, vacumm cleaner mustyness, pine oil, grapefruit, caramel and tangerine. Quite simply, an astonishing aroma.  After an aroma like this I am a little skeptical when I first sip the beer. ""How could the flavor outdue the aroma, it's impossible,"" I say to myself while putting the glass up to my mouth. I taste it. Then a look of complete shock consumes my facial muscles and I look straight down in awe at the beer sitting in my Duvel tulip. I stare at the beer, not momentarily, but attentively, like a pre-teen boy examining his first vision of female breasts. Wow, I whisper to myself.  The hops are sharp, pungent, bitter and very powerful. Sweet fruitiness first, slighty tart with lemons, grapefruit and other citrus notes. Caramel corn, tangerine and a hint of the alcohol come through on the finish.  What makes this beer even more appealing is the fact that they mention Hemingway on the label. He is one of my authors and was a brilliant brilliant man.  Did you know that Hemingway killed himself with the same shotgun that his father killed himself with and guess who has the shotgun now? Hemingway's son. Weird huh?  This beer blew me away.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,garymuchow,4.5,"New bottle as compared to the picture. Current one has a fish on it. Looks like a lake trout maybe. A really nice mix of malt and hops with a pleasing sweetness of fruity peach combined with a flowery grassy hops. Orangish amber slightly cloudy. Head settles to a white layer that leaves plenty of lacing. Starts with a bitingly strong hop bitterness, but moves very quickly to a softer bitterness with more citrus and just before finish a very light sweetness appears that lasts just for a moment before finishing with a long somewhat sour and slightly citrus conclusion. Feel is nice and soft throughout. Masala Mama has strong similarities to this. The hops here are more grassy and a little more biting, and the malt isn't as prominent and not quite as tasty. However, this is a beer deserving of its ranking.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,soper2000,4.3,"Notes from my Bell's tasting: Poured a nice golden orange with a medium sized white head. Aroma is very interesting. Hops are abundant, plus there is a hint of some spice maybe. Taste is very well balanced. I half expected a massive hop hit, but the hops were well constrained by a nice malty base. The finish shows off the IBU's of this baby. It's a very well crafted brew and super drinkable as well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,cerevisiaephilus,3.97,"This is certainly an interesting beer. I liked it a lot better on draught, here I'm having it from the bottle. Maybe its an older bottle?? I have no idea. I'm not getting any of the centennial hops that people claim are in here.  Anyway, little disapointed with the appearance of this beer. Its bottle conditioned and the yeast isn't very flocculant...pretty powedery actually. There was definately a ton of very fine particles in the beer even after careful transportation and pouring. The nose is nice...quite spicy, can't put my finger on the type of hops used, but nice and spicy. Taste is nice as well. A little something weird going on, not quite sure what it is. The hops are quite spicy and bitterness seems quite high, but there might be something else in there as well...can't put my finger on it...wheat maybe?? I doubt it.  Pretty drinkable beer all in all.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,RedDiamond,4.42,"This is a fantastic beer, a creation of unique balances and style. The only unanswered question this beer suggests is whether or not it should be defined as an IPA. Some of its properties are inconsistent with a strict interpretation of the style. While I have a lot of respect for defined beer styles, I also just like a well proportioned beer of any design. I drank this beer on tap and never saw a bottle, so I can't say whether or not this beer chooses to define itself as an IPA. Regardless, this review will emphasize content over category.  Bell's Two Hearted is pale and clear, almost lager-like with its sunny gold color and nice thready lace. The pint I drank had a thin head with sustained carbonation and good head retention. But the standout feature is a creaminess, not so much to the mouthfeel, but to the taste. This, combined with a fruity malt profile, creates an ale with an abundance of character. There is a tremendous amount of flavor here, an unusual measure for a brew this pale.  This is a highly drinkable beer with a soft mouthfeel and a bright citrus-hop aroma. I'd call it a pale ale and not an IPA, but no matter. I'm told the creaminess is derived from a unique strain of yeast.  Special thanks to Felonius for pouring me this one when I visited Minneapolis.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,LuckySevens82,4.52,"First, thanks to Feloniusmonk for hooking me up with this among several other Kalamazoo brews. 12 oz bottle with a fish on the label. Pours a fairly clear (I've seen much clearer IPAs), light golden orange. At first glance I thought this was an odd color for an IPA, but the more I think about it the better it looks. THe head was nice and thick, leaving good lacing along the glass. The smell is just fantastic. Piney, citrusy, and floral. The smell just screams IPA--Drink me! The taste is mellow, very smooth, but you can certainly tell that this is no ordinary brew. Huge hops from beginning to end, there is some residual bitterness, but the sweetness from the malt undercuts it nicely without overpowering it. There isn't much carbonation in this one, there is some but not enough to make it really pop for me. I could see myself having more than one of these in a night and probably would if it were available around where I live. THis is a great IPA. I would very much like to have another...and another...and....",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

You know what is about to happen. On the taste, you get a quick sweetness and then you are bombarded by bitter flowery goodness. Somehow this is a crisp and refreshing beer. Medium body, but this bottle had too much carbonation, as it felt a bit prickly. Very drinkable, I would certainly enjoy this again.

Poured from a 12oz bottle, yielding a gorgeously clear straw colored ale with active carbonation and a wonderful crown of pristine white foam.  The aroma is a pleasing mix of grass fields and flowers, and does not overpower in any sense. In fact, its a bit of a job just getting a full whiff.  The taste is crisp with bitterness and carbonation, sweet with maltiness, and satisfying in its balanced delivery. The bitterness accumulates on the palate, demanding your mouth have more.

One note here - this bottle is covered in dust, and I have no idea how long it was sitting on the shelf. Really, start a petition out there or something to get Bell's to start labeling dates. If it's of any relevance, it has what looks like the first half of a brook trout on the label; it's not the same one on the website.  This thing essentially exploded out of the bottle. Its a very pretty orange gold hue with HUGE white head that rises quicker than anything I've ever seen. Oh wow. I can smell it already.  This is the best smelling nose I've ever had. I don't even want to drink it. I just wanna sit here and sniff. When you say floral hops, this is what you should compare it to. Really though. If this were a perfume, I'd make my girl wear it everyday for ever.  Taste. Oh wow. That's awesome. It's so smooth and approachable. This is why I think it might be aged. It's not the hop monster I expected. Or if it is, the hops are so sweet and delicate that I am going insane. This is good because it lacks the heavy maltfeel every other IPA has. It's not an amber bombed with hops, its lighter in color and lighter in mouthfeel. I can't believe the balance. There's great carbonation, but it's so smooth I would have missed it if I didn't hold it up to the light. Erotic magazines....erotic tangerines.... (sorry but I just watched the funniest movie ever--Run Ronnie Run-- go rent it and pop a sixer--hilarious) Holy crap. Strange and delicious fruit. This beer is AWESOME ! It's like drinking your prom date's floral arrangement.  Mouthfeel: heaven.  What is it with new strange beers from across the country usurping my hometown hero, Victory? This is better than Hop Devil. Different for sure. My new favorite IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,RoyalT,4.45,"Appearance  Light orange in color and hazy with a big, beautiful head that showed excellent retention and left tons of lacing alongside my Ruination glass. The frothing foam just oozed along the glass like The Blob chasing turtles over an ice rink.  Smell  This one has a very balanced nose. The complex hops (predominantly floral, I think) are soft yet clearly steer this conga line. The malt base is just right and complimented with some light, grainy sugars. The lovely fruiting is here as well. I especially enjoyed the tangerine/grapefruit combination.  Taste  Dont rate this one too quickly or youll miss it. In taking my time with this (it is my first rating of the night) and I find the balance to be almost seamless.  The citrus hops lead things off and, again, steer more than dominate. Theres a slight bitter pine note at the very end, like the final strike of a piano key at the end of a well-played symphony. In the middle are the time-keeping malty drums, ensuring that the flavors come out in the right sequence and the proper strength. The fruity chorus pleases the pallet, bringing purpose to the other flavors.  Mouthfeel  Bells could have chosen to make this a bit heavier, but they opted for session over sensationalism. I like the heavy-hitters just as much as the next hophead, but the body here was right on target. Its medium at best with a very slight bittering at the end.  Drinkability  Not only was this a pleasure to consume but, believe it or not, it was quite the educational experience. They took a very interesting angle in putting this one together and, like TheBum alluded to, it must have been like constructing the Eiffel Tower. Great job  a true work of art!

287,1093,Tballz420,4.45,"Looks like i got a new version of the bottle, mine has a fish on it.  This one poured out a cloudy orange body, with lots of little bubbles. Big bubbly white head topping it off. The scent is sticky hop sap and some citrus notes as well. The taste is a big whack of oily hop blast. Good aftertaste. A pretty good beer, a hopheads delight.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BeerResearcher,4.35,"12oz brown bottle. No freshness date. It pours a wonderful honey amber color with a medium-sized white head and a fair amount of trailing and sticky lace. A big blast of floral hops is noticed upon opening the bottle and increases in intensity during the pour. Citrusy hops and a faint malt smell emerge briefly, then fade. The floral hop aroma remains. A lightly sweet biscuity malt flavor meekly sets the table for the abundance of hop flavors. Grapefruit, lemons, orange zest and limes make up a jowl clinching citrusy hit. A mild metallic bite and some peppery spices act as seasonings for this potently charged IPA. Had the Brits invented this stuff during their colonization of India, they'd be flying the Union Jack in Bombay today.

287,1093,elmocoso,4.65,"This one is a cloudy gold drink with a very pale head that soon subsides to a thin lacy blanket on the top.  The interesting think about this one, to me, is the smell. At first whiff i got a floral hop aroma but upon closer examination I am getting a really strong movie popcorn butter smell. This is very interesting and i don't know if this is supposed to be present. I will now drink, minding the unpoped kernels.  Yeah, its there. There is the usual malt taste and the bitterness of the hops, but in the for-ground is a taste of movie popcorn butter. It is not exactly unpleasant, but it is very present and kind of grabs all the tasters attention. I am not sure i appreciate it in there.  I will have to give this one another try. Although it is a decent beer, I wonder how the butter taste works into it. I think the drinkability suffers from it.  UPDATE.  Having acquired a new bottle of this from the famous FM, I am re-reviewing it with more positive results.  A bloomy could of bulbous head on a Dusty gold liquid. Head recedes leaving a moon like surface. Hops are very apparent and makes the mouth water.  There is an odd background smell that reminds me of drywall mud. The head is clinging and very attractive.  Mouth is amazingly smooth. Perfect balance. Sweet and tangy and reminds me a lot of Arrogant Bastard. Mouth waters after first drink and mouth-feel is great. Drinkability is A-one!  el",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Billolick,4.15,"12 oz bottle, pours light orange and very clear. White head which quickly went to a tiny bubble film and left nice linear lacing. Nose is piney hops. Taste is also dominated by strong, piney, grainy, resiny hop flavors. Grapefuit, lemon, pine, melon and honey on the tongue. Enough of a malt center to add balance. Medium bodied, fairly thin mouthfeel. A well crafted and enjoyable American style IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jimdkc,3.83,"Poured a hazy golden amber with a respectable off-white head. Head initially appeared creamy, but soon the bubbles grew larger...almost spongey looking. Head eventually fell back to about a quarter inch which stayed around quite a while, leaving a good bit of lace down the glass.  Smell was at first fruity. I thought I smelled apples in the first whiff, but then couldn't find them on the second sniff. Next I got a nosefull of heavily floral, citrusy hops... almost too flowery!  Flavor was sweet malt at first, then the HOPS kick in! Again, floral flavor first, then spicy, grapefruity bitterness. Aftertaste had a definite orange-peel character that lingered a good, long while.  Mouthfeel was creamy and carbonation was just right. However, I couldn't imagine drinking a lot of these in a row!  I imagine that 2 months ago I wouldn't have liked this much. But, over the last 2 months, I've sampled a lot of different brews and I can tell that my tastes are maturing. I think I'd like to re-review this about a year from now and see what I think of it then!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,abents,4.62,"Apperance: Pours a golden hue with yeast clouding the glass. A thick stiff white head appears and falls within a minute or two leaving white lace around the rim.  Smell: Aroma of citrusy hops that lingers in the nose. This thing smells delicious.  Taste: Storng malt flavor followed by a very citrus/grapefuit hoppy flavor. A little bitter at the end kind of sharp but the aftertaste lingers of hops and dries out the mouth nicely.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation. This beer floats down your throat and leaves you wanting more.  Drinkability: A very drinkable brew that goes down very easily, you could drink this beer all year long.  Apparently two hearted is now a yearlong brew. If this is true expect some quality drinking all year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Bruiser81,4.35,This brew poured a very murky orange color with a white foamy head that settled down to a thick sheet. Lacing was all over the place. The aroma had a lot going on. Lots of citrus coming through along with a strong floral hop aroma. While hops mostly dominated the nose their was a very powerful sweet malt backbone. A strong alcohol spice was also present. The taste was great. A beautifully balanced beer. The first sip hits with a big bready malt flavor. Lots of pale malt and an overall biscuity flavor. This is followed by huge hop kick with lots of grapefruit leading to a slightly bitter finish. A little bit of alcohol spiciness lingers into the aftertaste. This beer has sort of a creamy mouthfeel and goes down real smooth. Very drinkable. Its a shame I can't get this here.  Big thanks to feloniousmonk for sending this my way.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Gasp100,3.97,"Poured a orange/amber with a frothy white head and considerable lacing. The smell was pine and citrus bigtime. The taste was piney, acidic, citrusy but just too astringent for my taste. The first couple of sips were a little jarring, but once my taste buds got comfortable I started to feel the overall balance and crispness of the brew. Still, a little too heavy on the citrus aspect and after about 2 I was done. This is a great IPA but I did not find this to be my favorite style of IPA overall -- there is something different between the East Coast brewer's IPA's (Sly Fox, Victory) and the West Coast (other area's) which I can't put my finger on but I know I like the East Coast's IPA brews better (more balance, malt, not as much citrus/acidic taste?).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Foxman,4.45,"It pours a hazy honey orange, an almost vibrant hue. A puffy off-white head swells then settles gradually to a bubble-specked pond of uneven froth. There's considerable amorphous lacing.  The aroma brings a dense fragrance of pine, along with sweet berry notes skittering about the edges. Dry citrus flits between the more dominant elements, along with a decided but slinky malt sweetness.  On first sip the malt sweetness asserts itself immediately on the tongue, only to be swept aside by an astringent and spicy grapfruit assault. Pine and floral tones intermingle through the middle, as well as a gentle baked-dough warmth. Hops dominate toward the end, with a genuine deciduous bitterness along the back ridge of the tongue. The hops are more poignant, but the malt character evens the scales impressively.  Medium bodied, the flavor is distributed with a buttery feel, pillowing on the palate, then leaving a healthy and pleasant hops tingle on the tongue.  My eternal appreciation to kwalters for getting this one to me! There's malt to spare, but the hops are the headliner here. Everything about this splendid brew draws attention to the piney hops presence and results in a simple and balanced treat. Calling it drinkable would be a considerable understatement, as the crisp flavors dare you to stop at just one. And as with potato chips, you just can't. But then, why would you want to when you know how good the next one will be? The reputation is well earned, delivering in grand style across the board. Certainly, in this case, Two Hearts are better than one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Nose is floral hops and fruity esters (grapefruit, tangerine, and peach) along with a bit of fresh grain. Medium in body with a good deal of active carbonation, though the initial zestiness becomes more creamy towards the finish. Taste begins with some sweet malt quickly followed by a doughy and biscuity flavor. A lot of fruit bitterness is present towards the end with notes of grapefruit and a bit of lemon rind.

287,1093,kwalters,4.79,"This is an exceptional brew, to be sure. Before ever having taken a sip I was already enamoured by the great label, the local brewery (I'm in Michigan), and the fantastic name. The Two Hearted is a great trout stream in Michigan's upper pennisula. It also happens to be one of Hemmingway's favorites. Very cool!  Two Hearted pours like liquid gold with slight hints of orange and copper color. The wonderful flowery aroma is instantly noticeable. Drink this stuff out of a brandy snifter because you'll most definately want to stick your nose inside to soak up the scents. If you could bottle spring air, this is what it would smell like.  Now for the taste. The first sensation your tongue gets is the same as the one picked up by your olfactory nerves. Flowery, hoppy, delicious. There's also plenty of citrus flavors to enjoy as well. In fact, if Two Hearted smells like spring air, it surely tastes the way I imagine fresh orange blossoms would.  Try a bottle (or six!). You'll be belching pleasant flower burps for the rest of the evening!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,barleysangel,3.37,"First of all, I'm not a big fan of IPAs, but being a sport, I try everything. The appearance of this beer was a cloudy light brown with an orange tinge. The head was white and foamy with lacing to the end of the beer. I like the smell, it's flowery. The taste was bitter I definitely didn't like the aftertaste. It was a little less bitter when it was warmer. The mouthfeel was good, it went down easily, normal carbonation and relatively light. Again, I'm not a fan of IPAs, and I most likely won't have another one of these.  5/24/04: Wrong, I had another.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,budsboy,3.94,"Pours a cloudy light orange with a quickly disappearing white bubbly head and some pretty sticky lacing.  Fragrant this is. Smells wonderful. Floral hops indeed. There's a spiceness in there too that I can't quite figure out.  Taste is sharp, floral and hopped up. Bitter bitter dry finish. I'm usually not much for the hopsters, but the floral essence of this one is pleasing. Bold, foreward beer.  Medium bodied, heavier than I expected from the looks of it. It isn't the kind of beer I could double up on, but one here and there would be a pleasure.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

A fairly substantial bright white head follows closely behind the pour, then fades to a thin layer around the edge of the glass. Aroma is hoppy! Floral characteristics and some sour grapefruit scents too.  The first sip reveals a fairly mild flavor, I get a short trace of malt sweetness which is followed and overwhelmed by hops, mostly citrus through to a crisp, sour grapefruity finish. The brew has an average body and medium carbonation. This would be a nice brew on a hot day or with a plate of cheese and crackers.

Taste up front is very smooth- bready with sweet fruit flavors. develops into a soft fatness in the middle before being cut by a medium-heavy rush of hops that is just perfect. aftertaste is typical IPA medium/heavy bitterness... not overdone. The ideal IPA.  I think this is my new favorite beer.  note: Even in the same 6 pack I've noticed differences bottle to bottle. Some bottles seem to be more heavy on hops than others.

287,1093,stewart124,4.5,A golden yellow brew with a thick white head and an aroma that I could smell as soon as I opened the bottle. My mouth was watering while I poured this beauty. Strong floral hop smell as well as notes of citrus and maybe a pear. The taste is of a hop spice that does well to blend with the tastes of fruit. Very well balanced beer. There is a sweetness to this beer that lets the hops tickle your tastebuds without causing too much damage.

287,1093,Gueuzedude,4.17,"Pours a lightly hazy golden-copper color, and is topped by a offwhite creamy head. The aroma is of hops; grapefruit, apricot, citrus, and perhaps some pine, which adds an astringent note. The taste of the beer is quite good, to be to the point. But let me pontificate a bit more. There is a light sweetness which contributes to the citrusy hop flavor quite a bit. It is pretty bitter in the finish as well. The hops are not totally dominated by citrus though, there is some herbal notes, some hop spicines, and some notes of pine here as well. In the end a fairly dry beer, but made so because of the generous hopping. There is some malt sweetness here which helps to hold up the hop onslaught. The hops set a tingling sensation to my tongue, that screams pay attention to my hoppiness. This is a great everday beer, though perhaps it is just missing some slight amount of hop flavor & malt backbone to push it over the edge.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

This has just an amazing citrus taste to it! Finish is long, acidic and bitter.

Smell - Strong hop smell with hints of citrus really make this one great smelling brew.  Taste - Strong hop kick that leaves a very nice sweet citrus taste left in your mouth.  Mouthfeel - Thicker feeling beer but doesn't feel to heavy in your mouth. Very nice carbonation that helps make this heavier beer smoother and crisper than expected.  Drinkability - The hops really had a nice balance in this beer. They were strong, you did take notice of them upon the first sip, but they weren't to overpowering. It was actually a very easy to drink beer.  Comments - Thanks to chilidog and the '03 holiday beer exchange I was able to get my hands on this great representation of an IPA.

Yeast and citrus hiding in the background.  Taste is bright, fresh and aggressive. Tons of yeasty, bready textures with a large hop profile and subtle malt. Dry, bitter, crisp, light on the palate and leaves the mouth clean with little aftertaste.  Even though bottled, this tastes like fresh-brewed. One of the better IPAs I've found.

Lace is plenty but in spots. The aroma is bursting with floral and citric hops. That hop is carried over to the taste with a more citric favor. Taste of grapefruit with a not overdone lingering bitter is left on the mouth.

So, too, was the taste; there's a lot going on here: a good blend of soaring hops upon a foundation of subtle malts. And right at the end, a bready yeastiness lingers.

Floral aromas are extremly pungent and predominate but Two Hearted offers a string and complex grapefruit-citrus scent to compliment. Taste is incredible. Very bitter but in a delicate way. Im sure the IBUs for this is through the roof but its not a biting bitterness like Ruination, Stone reg or any other top shelf IPA. Malt profile does much to broaden flavors and taste.

Taste & Mouthfeel: Moderate body, smooth crispness and a touch of creaminess in the back. Light pale malt and yeast give a doughy biscuity flavour throughout. The hop character is strong with a semi-sharp bitterness and a long lingering citric toned flavour. Bitter dry finish.

The hand pull yeilded a beer with no bubbles, yet a firm mouthfeel. The IPA hops were actually subdued, nicely balanced between floral and bitter. Somehow I picked up a note of cherries, too.

Alot of hop flavor, and the hops taste like they smell, oranges (to my palate, anyway). Mouthfeel is more on the light side compared to some other ipa's i've had, but there's good body backing this one up. Drinkability is high on this one. It's one of those beers where i always wish there was more when i'm done. Two-Hearted has been one of my favorite american ipa's for a long time.

The manager mentioned that it was a seasonal fall/winter beer :( Fortunately the delivery guy made a mistake and they had a six pack in stock in July!   Pours cloudy with an amber color. They say this is an IPA, but it's not intensely bitter. The unique fragrance is apparent from the first pour. Just how do they manage to get all that pale grapefruit aroma into one little bottle? And it tastes as good as it smells! Smooth, and little aftertaste. -edit- Pine! That's it. After consulting the other reviews (which I don't do until after I have presented my own) I concur. Pine, as well as grapefruit, are the two main characteristics of this beer. --further edit-- This beer is much better on tap, full of flavor, and fresher.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,benmiliron,4,"My first Bell's pale ale. I never tried their regular pale ale just because I couldn't get past the stouts and porters, they were just too good to pass up! I'm glad I tried the two-hearted though. A good pouring beer, decent head that disappears in about a minute, leaving a nicely scented lace. The smell is fantastic, just like opening up that bag of whole leaf for the brewpot. The hops are the showcase here, and they tend to dominate the malt with little interplay between the two.  I like my IPA drinkable, more of a spring/summer drink than a cold winter night drink. (Except of course for Dogfish 90-minute!) This beer would be perfect for mowing the lawn or doing yard work. Nice and light (for Bell's anyway.) It's worth buying a six-pack if you're a hophead, because if you're like me, you would easily drink a lot of this beer. Have fun!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,GreenWBush,4.13,"Mmm, i've been eagerly awaiting my chance to try Bell's seasonal Two-hearted, and I was afforded that opportunity when my favorite pub finally got it on tap.  This Kalamazoo brew pours out to a cloudy bronze with the trademark Bell's yeast haze. This beer only had a tiny head, but I've noticed that a few of the bartenders can't pour properly so i'll attribute to that instead of blaming the beer.  A nice lacing appeared about 1/4 of the way down on the glass and decorated the pint 'til the bottom.  I was sort of expecting some ridiculously hopped entry, but this is something almost anyone would love. The initial taste is light and almost grainy, with a distinct resemblance to a lower-class wit beer. This sounds like a negative comment, but for some reason it works perfectly in this beer.  The malt balance is especially nice when you are used to drinking hop-monsters, but there are those hops in the background, rising like the sun to remind you that this is Bells. A great hop burp follows!  Larry Bell has crafted yet another winner in the Two-Hearted, a beer so aptly named its frightening. A perfect competition for hops and malt in the nose, and a beer that can be loved by both spectrums of beer drinkers. Hopefully next year's will be a bit stronger so it can be cellared, but overall a VERY enjoyable and equal-opportunity ale!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,merlin48,4.1,"Had a few of these in my cellar, so after reading all the hype I just had to sample one. Pours a murky honey gold colour with an off-white head that wants to hang around for awhile. Laces all over the pint tumbler. Aroma is overpowering(I'm getting used to this), lavender, pine, and citrus. Mouthfeel is a good balance of carbonation, hops, and a malt background. This is good stuff working together here. Kinda burp producing after a couple of sips. As it warms up, several dark fruit flavours are catching my attention. This one reminds me of some of Dogfish Head's better offerings. I'm still getting used to the hop assault of some of the better USA brews, so I'm sure I'll update this review in a few weeks. This ale has a bitter finish that is very crisp and clean.  The hoppy American IPAs like this are certainly grabbing my attention, and this one is one of the best.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Dantes,4.35,"Package: 12 oz. longneck, crowned bottle. Bottle-conditioned. Space for date/lot was blank. New color label, depicting two leaping (tiger?) trout. 6.0% ABV.  Cost: $30 case at Shangy&#8217;s  Presentation: Imperial pint glass at ~45º  Appearance: As noted by so many others, this is a lovely IPA, with a burnished amber body and a voluminous (2-3 finger), dry, white head which reached a self-sustaining ¾&#8221; layer. The body approaches the ruddiness of Celebration, but wasn&#8217;t as cloudy as I expected from previous descriptions. Perhaps the 7% version was cloudier. Active, fine bubbles.  Smell: Florally hoppy, with a cushion of rich malt. I find that most IPA&#8217;s fall into two categories: the harsh, medicinal ones, and the floral, fruity ones. Thankfully, this is one of the latter. I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s the Centennial that really marks this beer&#8217;s fresh aroma. Well, whatever it is, the hops palette plays beautifully off the malts.  Taste: One of the rare beers that lives up to its hype. The initial sensation is crisply hoppy, but as it rolls around your tongue, the more complex hop notes and malts make an appearance. I would characterize this as more herbaceously hoppy than citrusy hoppy. I always seem to fall back on this characteristic, but this beer is well-balanced. It is both refreshing and satisfying. The medium finish is very crisp and clean.  Mouthfeel: Almost achieves the fine texture of cask-conditioned ale in a bottle, with more vigor. Carbonation is excellent, while the body is a touch on the watery side. I would guess the &#8220;old&#8221; 7% version was probably a bit better in this regard. I do find that many &#8220;regular&#8221; IPA&#8217;s (sub-Imperial level) tend to be brittle.  Drinkability: Comes close to defining drinkability. Only the best cask ales, Celebration, and Brutal Bitter top this for quaffability IMO.  Backwash: Probably my favorite &#8220;pure&#8221; American IPA. Excluding &#8220;Imperial IPA&#8217;s&#8221; and beers like Brutal Bitter and Celebration (once categorized as a Winter Seasonal) which are maltier and bit heartier, this really hits the bullseye. Definitely surpasses peers like HopDevil and 60 Minute IPA. All things great beer should be: complex, refreshing, satisfying and endlessly quaffable. Must be killer on draught.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,leeenglewood,3.73,Pours golden with a slight yeast haze and the head is thick and stick around till you finish your glass. Smells like fresh hops with a citrus overtone. Initial taste of hop bitterness that is very perfumey followed along by a slight malt flavor although not sweet more grainy. Aftertaste is all hops very citrusy. Very perfumery hops flavor. Mouthful is rich and oily is rather drinkable. This beer has more dry hopped flavor then any beer ive ever had before.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,CRJMellor,4.3,"Too me this epitomizes the US trend of going for the hop heads. I've had debates with a few over whether this one belongs in the so-called Imperial IPA class with Arrogant Bastard, Dogfish Head, etc. That being said, this beer is great. Aroma is overpoweringly hoppy/floral. I need to ask Larry Bell how many different types of hops he uses. Definite grapefruit in the nose and maybe even some melon ? Has almost and orange tint to the golden hue as it pours. Taste is a real surprise given the aroma, very chewy malty taste that is then devoured by the hop backnote. For the me the balance works but both the front and the back are very aggressive and I can see how some don't like it. If you like this in bottles, seek it out on draught and you'll like it even more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,beernbbq,4.5,Very similar to Sierra Nevada Celebration and Dogfish Head 90 minute. Biscuity malt with a strong and perfectly balanced tang of Cascades and I assume Chinooks or Centennials. Goes down easy with a good dry finish. Mine was a little warm as it had just been transported from PA to CT but at 45-50 degrees I am sure this is perfection. A great American-style IPA.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ithacabaron,3.6,"Pours lighter than most IPAs, with an off-white head.  Very clear, especially for a bottle conditioned ale. Aroma is muted grapefruit and pine, with some orange zest thrown in.  Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would have liked, more ""hop-water"" than balanced. Similar to other hop heavy ales (in particular, HopDevil), but the hops here seem ""greener.""  Finish is much drier than many IPAs, with a definate oak taste and maple wood after-smell in the nose.  Drinkable, but misses the pure juicyness of I've found in offerings from Southern Tier, Lagunitas, and Victory, for starters, and which I prefer in my IPAs. I'm sure for some, though, this is perfect.  This is worth purchasing a sixer here and there, but all in all, not something I'd leap at when I saw it in the future.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ALESwhatCURESya,4.25,"This beer poured beautifully although I had quite a bit of sediment come from the bottle. Beautiful head that lasted for a while with lots of bottle bubbles.

287,1093,tar,4.3,"Pours a cloudy, light golden/orange color. The head is good sized (1+ fingers thick), white, somewhat foamy, and very persistent. The glass becomes nicely laced throughout drinking from the sticky head. A very good hoppy aroma. Tastes of fruity/citrus hops with some good bitterness, which leaves a very nice tingle on the tongue. Nice tasting malt flavors are present as well, but are dominated by the hops. One of my favorite beers and one which I look forward to reappearing each year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Realale,4.85,"Crystal clear pale gold. Seems fractionally lighter than the bottled. Very fine white head stays at a robust 1"" from a swan neck with no sparkler.  Nose is fresh Centennial in all of its grapefruity/piney glory. Its beautiful, but the malt is completely over-whelmed.  A bit thinner than the bottled on the palate, but incredibly well balanced. The malt really shines in the mouth combining elegently with the hop flavor. Definitely more bitter than the bottled, particularly on the long finish, but its really well put together. I prefer the taste of this one to the bottle.  Mouthfeel is excellent soft carbonation that only cask-conditioning gives to a beer. The bartender thought this cask might have been broached a bit too early, but the carbonation was just right for me. Way too easy to drink a lot of this one. Simply outstanding stuff!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mikeys01,4.47,"Bell's Two Hearted Ale is probably just about my favorite IPA in terms of most drinkable, most character, and just great taste. I just reacquainted myself with this beer when I picked up a 6 pack on a business trip this week. The Two Hearted pour into the glass a radiant honey gold color topped by a generous and fairly dense white head, that sticks around for most of the drinking. Aroma is mouthwatering floral hops and just a little bit of yeast. Taste is intitially agressively grapefruit/citrus hoppy but somehow soft at the same time, giving amazing hop flavor without being overly bitter. Flavor develops a little more malt character towards the end but finishes very crisp. This is a very easy drinking beer, surprisingly smooth and absolutely delicious.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Boilermaker88,4.58,"First beer I had after making my first shopping stop in Indianapolis. Two Hearted was very near the top of my have to find list. Presented in a 12oz brown bottle, Two Hearted Ale had a hazy dark golden color and a firm, foamy off-white head that never really died down and generated a nice patchwork of lace. The aromas of grapefruit, soft pine and floral hops along with a faintly yeasty smell came wafting from the glass. The taste had a lightly bready malt note initially which was promptly pushed aside by a strong grapefruit and lighter pine flavor that built through the finish and left a long bitter taste residing on the palate. The feel was medium-bodied and very smooth. This offering from Kalamazoo Brewing is one of the best American IPAs out there. Assertive in its hoppiness but not off-the-chart, Two Hearted Ale is one of the most well-crafted IPAs Ive had. Im real glad I saved a couple to bring home to savor later.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,nomad,4.72,"Poured a beautiful straw gold with a slight haze. Had a pocky head settling to frothy clumps, other times to a smooth sheen. Also had bulbous but inconsistent staining, and slick but nice lacing. Plenty of good miniscule carbonation rising quite quickly underneath helped support the efforts.  Smelled of grapefruit that tranquilize my nose with citric juice headiness, then tickled me with a textured pine scent, and occasionally threw me some hop leaf scents, too. All of these together tended to create a husky and peculiarly expressive combination. It opened to a depth of sweet apricot scents like putting your nose in grandmas best marmalade. Settles into a glorious ambrosia of delights that is sometimes gilded by floral edges. Not bad, I guess, eh?  Taste was of a quite true grapefruit flavor followed by big floral hops. Had high-alpha bitterness but was soft and blended in impact, and supported by an easy pale sort of malt backbone. Unbelievably easy on the palette considering the complexity of hops. The finish was so tender, leaving some tart hop flavors and an ounce or two of dryness, but overall an easy load on the tongue. Burps up tasty grapefruit juice with spiky pine, for me a sign of a well-hopped beer. Highly drinkable, this beers session-like mouthfeel could use a touch more body and less carbonation.  Large enough to show its bold stripes, subtle enough to blend them together, this is a highly complex (in a quiet way) yet highly drinkable beer. Surprising power and complexity for a low abv IPA, yet delicately so. The best of the pale sort of American IPAs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Taste: Fruity sweetness at first, giving way to a nice modest malt presence. Hoppy bitterness on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, nice and bubbly.  Drinkability: Give me more of this, please.

287,1093,WVbeergeek,4.7,"Appearance: Is simply amazing glowing orange amber tone with an off white massive off white tinted orange cream color head that rises well above the rim of the glass holding together very nicely lacing is thick evenly spread wow what a great appearance, just absolutely perfect. Aroma: Piney with an edge of sweet peach juice malted like an extract form the hops hold dominance on all other competitive components, but citrus orange peel and flower cascades all come to play at this hop gathering. Even after getting the bottle as empty as I could, I smelled inside the bottle to be greated with a robust rush of hops, now that's what I call hop aroma. Flavor: Simply crisp bitterness blended with a malt backbone not as syrupy sweet compared to the likes of a barley wine esque Double IPA but this one holds it's ground as being one of the best IPAs I have ever tasted. Such a good IPA wish I had this one at my disposal, because this is a buy by the case beer all the way. The layers of different hops that harmonize here is uncanny I can literally pick out seperate hop components earthy tones, pine cone like, flowery, citrus zest it's all here this beer is amazing. Mouthfeel: Carbonation solid all the way through body is medium to light I wish there was just a tad more texture my only complaint. Drinkability: Dead on as can be yearning for a bigger supply than just one bottle I am really enjoying this beer it is christening the gameday as my first beer for the final meeting of the West Virginia Mountaineers and the Virginia Tech Hokies, go 'eers!!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

It is a nice creamy head that was huge and stucke to my glass like nothing else.  The smell was hops all the way, nothing but hops. Very floral.  The taste was very disappointing. It had hops but it was very thin and almost watery. There is very little malt in this beer and it makes it lose it's body. Could be a lot better.  Not a bad beer but not what I expected it to be.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,TheLongBeachBum,4.45,"Presentation: Another 12 ounce long neck brown bottle. The front label has a different design to some of the other Bells labels. The one on the Two Hearted Ale I had was even different to the one shown in the BA Database. A large cross profile of a fish head in black & white is set inside an orange border. No freshness date or strength listed.  Appearance: It has been in the fridge for 3 days and pours with an almost clear, but ever so slightly hazy looking golden body. Tangerine orange hints when back-lit. Nice off-white head sits atop the beer, but slowly rescinds to a thin collar  good carbonation & a swirl repair the head back to a smart looking smooth ¼ pillow look, which then had little problem maintaining its staying power. It looks exceptionally good to the eye.  Nose: Volatile floral hops, pine oils and fresh fleshy grapefruits. A veritable, Eau de Hummulus Luppulus.  Taste: Wow, even the frothy head has a crisp bitterness when sucked off of the top of the beer. It has a very perfume feel right from the off. The bitterness is offset by the strong Malts though, well at least at the start anyways. These eventually make way for a more pronounced fruity bitterness, with a sharp grapefruit feel that has hints of lemons at times. The malts always support the extreme bitterness though, lending a good balance to the overall beers taste profile. Finishes with a fantastic fresh floral hop-bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Solid bitterness abounds in the mouth, positively reminding every part of the tongue, regardless of its taste receptiveness  that this is a very hoppy & bitter India Pale Ale. Good carbonation lends vitality to beer in the mouth  almost feels creamy at times.  Drinkability: I enjoy IPAs, which is a bonus, but I enjoyed this even more so. The floral perfume aspects and the malts as strong as they are, all balance out in the end to make for an excellent quaffable IPA.

The aroma was pretty hoppy with citrus and other fruits and spices there as well. The taste was odd because it tasted like it was laden with alcohol, but acutally only has around 5%. Sweet malts were present, but the main part of the flavor had a spicy, orange peel taste with some hints of honey. Very weird. Took a few drinks to get used to it, but turned out to be a very drinkable beer.

While in Western Michigan, I found some bottled Two Hearted Ale in Grand Rapids. The taste was like nothing I've ever experienced, especially for a guy accustomed to the rich, cascade-hopped west coast IPA's. Is there molasses in this brew? It definitely has a distinct and complex recipe of hops and malt working here. It was a very good ale, but I can't understand all the hype and why so many BA's rank this as high as they do. Mad Hatter is my favorite Michigan IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Bierman9,4.13,"Poured a lovely golden color, with a slight hint of haziness within (the bottle had some sediment, which I swirled in at the very end, giving the bier a definite opaque quality). The head was whipped up into a froth without much effort. Took its time to recede, and stuck well on the sides. Nose had a verrry nice hop aroma, leaning a bit towards the grapefruit, but not overwhelmingly so. Some toastiness also makes some headway here. Body hits medium on the scale, and the carbonation level is fairly low, resulting in a pleasing smoothness across the tongue.  I find a more than abundant level of malty sweetness, with a honey-like aspect present. Hoppiness is a big player on the stage as well, with a citrussy lean, but also with (to me anyway) some slight hints of tropical fruit. A palate-pleaser, to be sure!

Said that, after drinking the cask (adn eventually trying a bottle), I can say that the cask version does not disappoint! The color was a cloudy deep yellow/orange with a typical cask head that lasts throughout. The smell was a slap of citrus and hops on the nose. Very refreshing. Since this was on cask, I was expecting more of a low scent. The taste was remarkable. Creamy big mouthfeel that sits there and hop flavor busting through. Definitely a well balanced cask version of a wonderful ale. Drink one and burp that hop taste all night.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

I'm going to have to go against the grain here and say that Bell's Two Hearted Ale is just another horribly over hopped American ale. I know it's an IPA and hoppiness is a characteristic of the style, but I just don't think there is enough maltiness and body in this brew to support all the hops. All I can taste is a sickening amount of floral and citrus hops. To me it seems very unbalanced and astringent.

(in a clean 10oz Sample Glass)  Aroma is spicy hops with a light phenol. A soft malic tinged fruitiness wraps around a gentle malt nose.  The beer itself pours hazy orange with a fluffy white head on that holds through the glass.  The flavor is briefly sweet with malt sugars that are surplannted by a growing piney resin bitterness.

The body is medium, it is crisp, creamy and fresh all packaged up together. Slight warming effect, absolutely delicious. Everything you'd expect and more from an IPA, hop heads will be at the pearly gates, non-hop heads will be right behind, this is an anytime, anyplace, session, etc. beer.

287,1093,BierReise,4.42,"One of the best IPA's I've had in recent memory. Cloudy copper ale with nice fluffy head, which is the sign of great quality ales. Aroma is superb, piney and citrusy. Has it's own uniqueness to it and different from other great IPA's. I smell a little cedar as another reviewer points out. Nice lacing. Very crisp and carbonation is solid. I only wish I could buy these locally. Would be a regular for me. Thanks JohnnyDuvel!!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,dwarbi,4.68,"Whoa! What an amazing looking beer. Foamy white head that leaves large patches on the sides of the glass as I drain it. Hippity hoppity hop-hops! Helluvan aroma. Bursting in my nasal cavity. Creamy and smooth IPA?! Don't get me wrong, it's crisp and pops on your tongue, but very clean. Fantastic IPA. Supremely drinkable. I am not a hophead, but this is a great IPA choice.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,rastaman,3.18,"Strong cedary, piney, grapefruity, citrusy nose, no doubt due to the hops. Smooth sweetish maltyness. Sharp bitterness at the end, with some saltyness and some alcohol noticed, lingering bitterness. Grapefruity and a bit woody?. I don't know, to me this wasn't very exciting, a bit one dimensional, It had a lot of flavour, but maybe it was a bit too sharp for me?. Still, quite alright. Another gift from feloniousmonk.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,frank4sail,5,"Flower hop/orange rind beautiful fresh nose. Rose colored with lots of little bubbles and a thick sturdy 2 inch creamy pale head. Sticky white peaks settle to a rich sticky lace on the glass. I love the fragrant smell of this brew. Bitter hop citrus grapefruit taste with a sturdy pale malt backbone. Medium mouth thet coats the tongue and throat with a wonderful hop flower film. The bitterness mellows and leaves the back of the tongue dry. The front of the tongue is left with jellybean sweetness. WOW balenced even on both ends of your tongue. I love this brew... and I think it also loves me... This brew is so rounded it is the only IPA that I have tasted that has truly measured up to the Hopdevil. The citrus flavors evolve in your mouth into a ""big daddy"" of hop satisfaction.

287,1093,SheepNutz,4.18,"I had this beer in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. The pour yielded 2 good fingers of foam above a cloudy deep orange yeasty liquid. One thing I really love about this brew is the head. It really stays around, leaving a good bit of lacing on the glass. A little bit of citrus in the smell, very pleasant. The taste is a good bite of hops with a bit of frutiness in the front of the tongue. Almost a flavor of clover and pine really. The mouthfeel is pretty heavy and smooth. The drinkability is average for an IPA. One thing I really love about this brew is the head.

287,1093,Loki,4.95,"Sampled in a 12oz bottle with a very unique label with an almost homemade look that left me truly wondering what the bottle contained and what was in store for me with this tasting.  This fine Kalamazoo product poured a slightly hazy amber color with a ¼ - ½ inch thick ivory head that faded fairly quickly. Yet while most of the head faded quickly, the beer maintained a 1/8 inch head nearly through out my sampling. This beer also produced beautiful lacing during the entire drinking experience.  The nose on the Two-Hearted Ale was both prominent and pleasant. A very floral and fruity nose revealed scents of wild flowers, peaches, grapefruit, and malt. Beautiful, yet delicate scents and a promise great of taste flowed from the glass.  The taste did not disappoint me. With a sweet start of fruit and fine malt that lead into bevy of hop flavor. This beer possessed a medium body and a clean, crisp smoothness that went down incredibly easy and very fast. The flavors were smooth and even through out and transitioned without any jump, wholes, or gaps between them.  I am very impressed by this Kalamazoo product; it certainly lived up hype that I had read about all of the Kalamazoo beers. Thank you taverjeff for sending me the so I have at least two more. Yet I know two will not be enough.  Note: Upon searching for the Two-Hearted Ale to review I can to the astonishing revelation that it is an IPA! What? But I hate IPA?s. In fact I?ve only had one before that I even really liked. Are my taste buds changing, or is this beer just that damn good?  I think it is just that damn good, and I also think I?ll have another.

287,1093,blkknight02,4.17,"My first chance to sample this highly rated brew since Bell's has just begun to be distributed in our area. The beer poured a light copper to dark amber hue with an adequate amount of head. The lacework stayed on the glass the entire pint. Aroma of piney/citrusy hops (chinook and cascades?) with a hint of sweetness in the background. Somewhat fruity as well. Hops overwhelm the malt but there is a finish of sweetness followed by a lingering bitterness. Very biting mouthfeel due top the carbonation level and the IBU's involved. Overall, it a good beer but too much pine for my tastes.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,AtLagerHeads,4.08,"Not a bad choice for numero 300. The cask pour came up quite nicely with a thick pillowy white head that dissipated rather slowly to a thin lace blanket that coated the sides of the glass thoroughly. The body was dark gold to light amber and somewhat hazy. Nose was full and gave off piney, herbal hop aromas that carried through to the taste. A flowery sense was included in both nose and taste. This is a hophead ale to be sure, but creamy and full bodied to boot. Very little malt sense, but, of course, that is what carries the hops forward. Not overly bitter at any point, the brew finishes with a hint of lip-licking sweetness that balances the overall experience. This would not be the top IPA on my list, and I've probably rated it higher than I'd otherwise rate it because of the cask influence. IMNSHO, it is very good beer, but a bit too highly rated.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,daledeee,4.7,"If you want hoppy, this is it! The finest pale ale I have had.  When I first drink it, it seems strong. But as the glass goes down the enjoyment goes up.  Pours a beautiful head. Golden colored. Floral or piny aroma.  Hops all over the place. Some malt creeps through. Well balanced. What a joy to drink!  Why do I live in Iowa? I have to drive to Wisconsin to get this. But that makes it a special treat. This is a top beer. Possibly the best American beer. Two in the top 10 not bad for an American brewery!  Edit: Since this review, I have tried many other beers. This is still a great beer but there is strong competition from American Brewers that I found as I traveled around the country.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

The nose has a big, vegetal hop aroma, smelling strongly of coriander, though I&#8217;d be beyond beside myself to learn that any adjuncts or spices were used in this beer. The very slight haziness lends credibility to an over-crystal malted style. The just-less-than-white head is pretty fluffy after the yeast has been added from the bottle, but is mediocre otherwise.  The flavor is odd, to say the least. Sweet, pineapples mix with cooked vegetables to leave a very unusual sensation in the mouth. Then there&#8217;s that damned coriander flavor! Is this an Imperian Wit or an IPA??? OK, we&#8217;re gonna stop right here and assume the worst&#8212;I got a funky bottle. I stopped and read about 30-40 reviews of this stuff and everyone loved it. There were several telling mentions of an &#8220;odd sweetness&#8221; or a &#8220;pleasant funkiness from the Bell&#8217;s yeast&#8221; that&#8217;s just killing me here! The ambient flavors created by the fermentation with the &#8220;famous&#8221; Bell&#8217;s yeast is wreaking havoc on my buds. In my doubt, I had my wife taste it and she thought it tasted and smelled like ash (not ass, ash). This stuff is as close to horrid as a beer can get without being dumped. Let&#8217;s hops for a bad bottle and a shot at redemption in the future. I&#8217;m rating what I taste based on the fact that with something like 60+ IBU&#8217;s and 7$ ABV, this stuff oughtta be impervious to bugs.  Updated early April 2003: I retasted and although this second bottle was MUCH better than the first, it still had subtle hints of that vegetal, coriander flavor. I'm upping my score, but not by much.

287,1093,StevieW,4.8,"12 oz bottle. What the hell are those things on the label. They don't look like hearts to me. I'll call MikeyW, he'll know. This Bell's beer opened with more of ""pffft"" than the other ones I 've had. That's a good sign I think. Poured a more golden yellow color than a rich copper that I expected. I guess I expected a darker color, but that's ok. Rich bubbly, creamy, biege head. Full and strong, laced the glass on the way down. Aromas spot on of striking Cascade hop goodness. Full on, very good. Full flowery hop aromas. First taste is equally striking, stand up and take notice hop bitterness. Combined with the tangy, bitter citrus taste. Subtle malt body. Balanced. Sticky, whole hop flowers, much like a Celebration Ale. Leaves a hole in your mouth, with bitterness lingering on your tongue. Medium bodied, perfectly charged. This one is the ultimate summer thirst quencher or bbq beer. And 7% abv is not felt. A beer I could drink again and again and not tire of it. I had this with grilled bbq chicken and corn on the cob. Perfect !",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

Aroma is very grapefruit/orangey/lemony peel-like with lots of fresh floral hops and a bit of spice and slight dry malt. Straight up taste is very fresh hops, citrusy with some spice notes and grain, nothing overbearing, very mellow, its perfectly balanced and is very crisp and clean with a great, light dry finish lingering with dry malts and left over hop bits. Hard and very bold, medium body feel, somewhat creamy with lots of fruity sweetness and a nice, light dry finish. This is some fantastic stuff.

I am truly torn between this brew, Dogfish Head 90 Minute, and Lost Coast Indica Pale Ale as my favorite IPAs I have tried thusfar. This is a great brew. It gets a ""5"" in appearance based in no small part on the cloudy golden-amber color. A beautiful thing. The aroma is good and hoppy with some spice, but hardly overbearing.

The taste matches the nose note for note...superbly tasty hoppiness without being a tongue scorcher, flowery hops give way to fruity and malty flavors that come full circle back to the excellent hoppiness.

The head slowly dies down, leaving a moderate lace on the glass. Aromas are rich with hoppy goodness and sweet citrus. All I can say about the taste is, WOW! Amazing! Fantastic! The hops seem to attack the mouth like a rabid dog on a pork chop. The hops are incredibly well balanced with some mild citrus and malt undertones. This is by far the best IPA that Ive ever had the pleasure to taste.

Aroma: This is a unique aroma. I feel the description of citrus doesnt do this ale justice. Spices come to mind when I breathe in this ale. Yes, maybe a hint of citrus but spice is the best way to describe the aroma. I wish I could narrow it down to be more specific. Best way to say it.  It is simply wonderful!   Taste: I thought it is nicely balanced. A soft malt start and the flavor of the hops at the end. I wish I could find the words to describe the hops.  A very VERY nice ale. It ranks high on my own excel beer list. No wonder it ranks so high at BA!

287,1093,JohnnyDuvel,4.32,"I'm not usually as knocked out as a lot of others are by hopped up, over-the-top micros, but this is one unique, terrific beer! Kind of like a fruit smoothie or creamsicle with lots of hops thrown in. The citrus smell leaps out when you open the bottle (and I can really appreciate it. I have grapefruit, orange, mango, and lemon trees in my back yard!). The hops certainly are present, but unlike a beer like Rogue IPA, the hops don't push the flavor to the background. Pours a nice, foamy head - with good retention. Cloudy, orange hue. Both refreshing and substantial. It was great to have a highly rated micro brew that lives up to it's reputation. (thanks, Al - I'll need more!!) - (note: the above review was for the 2002 version. The 2003 version isn't quite as good IMO, not as smooth.

The nose is dominated by the hop floral crispness; sweet malt underlies this olfactory delight. Start is sweet and malt laden, top is middling in feel, finish is moderately carbonated the hops puissant, aftertaste hop spicy and dry, quite long lasting, another beer meant for the Hop Heads amongst this most august group of beer lovers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,brakspear,3.34,"03-02-2003  This is a very nice looking American India pale ale, but the rest of the beer seems rather average, particularly when compared to some of the outstanding West Coast IPAs.  A beautiful and billlowing soft white head forms quickly and then produced perfect lacing on the glass. The body of the beer is a clear light amber with generous carbonation bubbles rising from its depths.  The aroma presents as a rather tame but citrusy hop nose, nothing outstanding, but a crisp and bracing hop snap.  The taste is very subdued. I was expecting more given other reviewers impressions of this beer. But what I tasted was a nicely balanced pale ale, with an almost chalky malt taste followed by a slight hop bitterness, citrusy but mellow. The body also seems a bit watery for an IPA.  This is a decent and average India pale ale that I would buy again, but I do not understand the accolades this beer has received. Perhaps compared to other IPAs brewed in the Middle West it stands out?  4-29-2003  Sampled again to see if I judged too harshly the first time. Nope, the taste has a weird yeast or off character I do not find pleasant at all. If this is the distinctive Kalamazoo yeast flavor, I must just not like what it does to the beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BeerBuilder,3.98,"Hazy, orangish-copper color with a thick, chunky, off-white head. Leaves an excellent amount of lacing. The aroma is all citric, flowery hops.

287,1093,Mitchster,4.8,"OG=1.058, 6.0% ABV. Hopped exculsively with Centennial, or so I hear.  Ah, what better beer to celebrate my 100th review with than Bell's Two-Hearted Ale, an amazing IPA and truly a wondrous beer. This brew is absolutely gorgeous...brilliantly clear if decanted carefully, a perfect shade of light-amber to golden with orange accents, forming a thick, billowy, peaking, yellowish-white head atop medium sized bubbles, leaving gobs of head (I hesitate to call it lace) that stay until the end of the beer. The carbonation is medium-strong with lots of pretty streamers spiraling towards the obstinate head. Aroma is hops, hops and more hops (more-so than Celebration or any other exemplary IPA), as if sticking your head into a bag of fresh leafy cones, full of citrusy grapefruit, subtle pineapple, vanilla sugar cookies, and perhaps a little pink-bubblegum. The harsh, piney, resinous hops that you might expect from Westcoast offerings are absent...this aroma is full, but smooth. It reminds me of the time I was at Bell's and walked into the hops cooler...yum! Despite the carbonation and bright hops, the mouthfeel is extremely soft with a medium-light body, lighter than one would expect based upon aroma. Taste starts out with a ton of flavor hops followed by a creamy-smooth pale malt body, some notable alcohol punch, and ending in a pleasantly mild and extraordinarily well-balanced bitterness complementing the lingering bready malts. This is a beer perfectly served by a pink-bubblegum character...as it warms, it adds to the enjoyability. This beer is not bitter despite it's high hopping. Having had this on tap, I would add .5 points for taste, making it a perfect 5.0. The bottled version tends to have a more noticeable alcohol presence which knocks it down ever so slightly. One of my top 5 beers of all time. Fellow BA's take heed and rush to find this at any expense!  A world-class brew and simply the best IPA I've ever had. To read about this brew does it no justice. Go drink it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,francisweizen,4.53,"Awesome! This beer reminded me of Rogues 12PA and that is a good thing, as I love that particular beer from Rogue. This beer poured a very clear dark golden colour with a nice foamy head to it. This smelled of Grapefruit, Metal and Various Hops with some Tiny Malts in the background as well. This tasted very hoppy and rustic. The aftertaste was quite metallic as well as very fruity and grapefruit like. This beer had a very crisp, classic mouthfeel and a great drinkability as well. My first beer from Bells and I am very impressed. Many thanks to Sakaroo for the fresh sample! Cheers!, F.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,purplehops,4.12,"Two Hearted poured a cloudy amber/orange with yeast particles (would be clear if decanted) and a very frothy white head that leaves pleanty of lacing. The aroma is HOPS. Floral hops, citrus hops, and a good dose of earthy hops. The taste starts with an attempt by the malt to come to the fore front but is instantly beaten down by the hop bitterness. This bitterness progresses into citrus flavors and a hint of a malt come back. The finish finds the malt taking advantage of a hop lull and bringing worth some flavors of caramel and pale malts. The aftertaste is a steady battle for about fifteen seconds before the malt surrenders to the almighty dry hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is very creamy with just a hint of carbonation tickle on the front of the tongue. Overall a very nice IPA that I wouldn't have expected from a Mid-West brewer (bold and bitter I don't associate with the mid-continent). I do so enjoy being surprised and proved wrong when it comes to beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,UncleJimbo,4.42,"This ale poured a nice golden amber with creamy white foam that left good lace. The ale was slightly hazy with lively carbonation. The smell was rich, floral hops, with some malt flavors coming through. The taste was full: malty and biscuity. The malt gave way to hops (bitter and then floral). There was a bit of dryness to the finish. The malt almost balanced the huge hop character. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with a slight chalkiness to the finish. This was a very enjoyable IPA with a long lasting hop flavor. A huge IPA.  Thanks to feloniousmonk for this bottle.

Lovely soft pineapple initiates the nose, mellow, light citrus warm and welcoming. Pineapple and light grapefruit construct the palate, not overly bitter, mild pine with a hint of honey and a kiss of malt adds tremendous subtle complexity to this brew. Pleasing mouthfeel, soft, ideal, hearty without overpowering. Slightly dry finish, hoppy-pineapple aftertaste. Wonderfully drinkable, not as hoppy as I would have thought (not a negative), a very pleasant quaff this is a must try and I highly recommend it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

287,1093,Sudmissle,4.95,"Pours with a milky white creamy head. Initial flavor has powerful hops that remains on palate and does not fade away as with most other IPA beers. Has strong citrus flavor and is incredibly smooth in spite of its rather high alcohol content. The bite of the hops is very potent and even after making great efforts to sample other IPAs, this one stands alone and the novelty of the wonderful blend of powerful citrus taste and hops has not worn off after over a year of sampling other hops-laden brews. By a wide margin, my favorite IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,BitteBier,4.43,"A gorgeous pour--hazy apricot color that lightens to a lemonade hue at the edges. Large frothy head that reduces to a cream-colored cake with decent lacing as well. Crisp, hoppy aroma complemented nicely by grapefruit/pineapple notes. Grapefruit is even more noticeable in the taste, which has a malty foundation that could be stronger to balance the hoppy, citrus flavors. This balance actually seems to improve as the beer warms. Bitter IPA finish is actually a bit sour; this is truly an IPA with a twist. Excellent mouthfeel in this nicely drinkable beer. A unique take on the American-style IPA, but a good one even in a toe-to-toe.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95

It pours with a nice, lasting, white head and a cloudy golden hue. The lace is amazing and makes this beer almost as good to watch as to taste (well, not quite but you get the idea). Citrus dominates the aroma and it has a crisp taste of huge hops. I could hardly tell that this is 7.0% abv by the taste. It is difficult to have only one glass of this great tasting brew.

287,1093,aaronh,4.95,"Pours with a voluminous cream colored head atop a hazy orange beer with amber highlights. The head slowly recedes while it leaves a thick, sticky lace on the glass. The aroma is very sweet bubble gum with a strong lemon-pine hop presence. The sweetness is evident on the pour, and as you carry the glass to your seat. I wanted to take a drink immediately! Who needs notes anyway, right? The first drink is truly heavenly, with a great malt sweetness sparked by a terrific hop bite. What a dichotomy of tastes that somehow blend together perfectly! Very strong citrus notes are prevalent in subsequent quaffs, but the malt is never forgotten. The finish is exceptionally smooth and clean for such a flavorful beer. All that is left is a hint of fruitiness and a hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel is very rich and supple, while not becoming too heavy as the beer is finished. Drinakbility is terrific, but I only had one! So I made it last as long as possible. I'm not sure if the ""two hearted"" refers to the strong prescence of both the malt and the hops. All I know is that the name had no meaning to me until know. My heart was swept away by this beer. By both the malt and the hops. Thank you, oh thank you cretemixer for this absolutely fantastic beer. My advice to all BA's: Sacrifice anything necessary to obtain this beer.

I've had some IPA's where I just can't stand the very high bitterness level. But it's very enjoyable here and not overpowering by any means. The higher ABV is not noticeable at all. This is one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. I wish I could buy this often, but at $9.25 for a six pack (spoiled rich neighborhood), it's a wonderful occasional treat.

287,1093,Sixpack595,4.51,"This a good IPA. Huge hops with enough malt to back it up. A bit citrucy in flavor and aroma.Thick creamy head leaves nice lacing and lasts. Amber color slightly cloudy due to bottle conditioning.

287,1093,NeroFiddled,4.62,"A bottle that's allowed to sit for some time and then carefully poured delivers just a slightly hazy (almost clear) peachy-gold body that's topped by a frothy white head which holds fairly well. It eventually drops but keeps a really nice creamy collar, and a simple swirl of the glass brings it right back up! Additionally, it leaves some nice lace - although it's fleeting. The aroma, however, is even more astonishing than the appearance with a bright, bold combination of soft ripe fruit, tangy grapefruit and resiny pine. Intense! But it goes even one step further as the flavor is even bolder than the aroma with a searing bitterness right-up front, and from start to finish! If it weren't for the rich (almost sugary) and fruity (apricot, tangerine, mild pineapple) malt underneath this beer would be way too much! Surprisingly, and thankfully, the hop flavors are limited to the fruity side of things and the interplay between the crushing bitterness and the sweet malt is really interesting. It's kind of like a ""tug of war"" in the mouth. The firm maltiness is enlivened by a very fine and gently effervescent carbonation that helps this to happen. It's surprisingly smooth and creamy. This is one hell of a ""take no prisoners"" IPA that should clearly be sought out and destroyed - one bottle at a time! Most highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Brent,4.62,"Quite a surprising beer - mega-hoppy aroma of grapefruit rind makes you brace both feet for the hops onslaught. Hops are there, big and bold, no question, but - in something of a contradition in terms - quite mellow. Usually this much grapefruity hops stomps on your tongue with hobnail boots, but this beer manages to finesse the hops and go heavier on flavor than bitterness. A great beer - ranks in my top five of the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,inebrius,4.57,"Thap...thap, thap. The sound of whole hop laden vines descending on your buds in a blitzkrieg of bitterness. If not for a decent dose of malt your mouth might be puckered into 2004. Bouquet of hard lemon candy and catnip. A hop assault on the senses. Aggressively carbonated and wild. Is there some airborne yeast in Kalamazoo Larry Bell has decided to culture?  This will be my last review until I can get some taste buds surgically implanted on my tongue. Yikes!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,WilliamPhilaPa,4.72,"Pours a nice light copper-amberish color with orange highlights. The head is a off-white color, and leaves good lace. On the nose the aroma is of pine, grapefruit, hoppy and fruity. On the palate more pine, grapefruit flavor, citrus, hints of orange peels, delicate malt backbone bringing in some balance, and a little spiciness. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth and the finish is some-what dry. Overall a great american styled IPA...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,MJR,5,"Bottle  Warm, glowing, light peach with perfect clarity. Huge, puffy off-white head that fades here and there, leaving huge, cloud-like pillows of foam. Tons of sticky lace. Enormously aromatic nose with a huge blast of floral Centennial hops, with soft pink grapefruit, and hints of orange, peach, and mango. Underneath is a thin foundation of toasted malt and slightly chalky yeast. Flavor is an eruption of hop flavor and velvet hammer-like bitterness. Flowers, pink grapefruit, peaches, oranges, mangosits all there in an incredibly soft and sticky delivery. The malt and yeast manage to stay afloat enough to provide a solid base for the hop explosion happening above. Medium in body, with a soft and round mouthfeel that only gets better with the yeast pour towards the bottom. Finishes dry, firm, and bitter, with a splash of citrus and black pepper. Through my many years of better beer, this is still my favorite expression of the IPA style, and one of only a few beers that I cannot drink only one of. My opening of a bottle of this guarantees a second and third. Its worth noting that since the new brewery opened in Comstock, this beers flavor profile has been much cleaner, with much less sediment.  Absolutely untouchable American IPA. Just perfect.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,cretemixer,4.35,"One hoppy IPA. As with most Bells products, I love the slightly cloudy look..light golden color. Nice white head. Hops, hops and more hops dominate the aroma but somehow they squeezed a little citrus in there too. The taste mirrors the smell. I was not dissapointed, left a nice tangy aftertaste. Pretty drinkable for the abv Way to go Larry!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,yen157,4.05,"Hazy and light amber with a large, stiff, white head. Smelled like a good AIPA should, big citrus. Also, notes of yeast, grains, and some malt. Extremely well balanced beer (for an AIPA) with some toasty malt providing sontrast to the raw hop and alcohol flavors. Fairly light body and carbonation which I liked very much.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,JoeyHotrod,4.97,"Simply put one of the best beers of any type I've ever had. Had a nice creamy head sitting on top of a brilliant cloudy beer. The taste and smell both yelled out hops! One of those beers a hophead would be more than happy to get ahold of, yet also has enough balance to even things out abit for something who is not a huge fan of hops. Bell's has done is again!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,pheurton,4.7,"pours a cloudy yellowish-orange. the aroma of this beer is the first thing you notice...powerful citrusy hops. a nice, slightly off white head. taste is all hops....grapefruit, floral, a bit spicy...without any astrigent bitterness at all. the malt is there to offer a nice balance. this beer is very impressive...extremely balanced, with tons of hop flavor that is not harshly bitter at all. one of, if not the best american ipa i've had the pleasure to have, when it's ""on"". i've had a few samples in which the sweet fruitiness is muted and the bitterness more pronounced, which would knock it down some for me. when it's on target though, it is hard to beat.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ZAP,4.97,"This may be my favorite IPA of all-time....Incredible nose...I get the huge citrus aroma with pineaples the predominant fruit...looks a little cloudy but a big rocky white head tops this bad boy....the nose invites you in, and then the taste takes over...no disappointment here....great hops flavor...all citrus...grapefruit the big one...also some pear core on the finish....malt doesn't assert itself but this is very balanced in the mouth...highly drinkable, particulary if you like hopped up beers....Next to some of their stouts this is without question their best beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,maxpower,4.6,"Pours cloudy copper color, citrus hoppy aroma, nice hop profile, crazy ass foamy clingy head.

287,1093,cokes,4.68,"I haven't reviewed this one yet??? Let's change that... Heavily clouded peach-orange body. Alpine-esque head never recedes past the 3/4"" mark. Massive, thick, sculptable. Grapefruit hoppy resinous nose. Not quite eye-watering, but fairly intense. Bitter as hell. Searing concentrated grapefruit, sprinkled with alum and pine needles. Metallic notes as well. The hops have come to play. The big malt body helps balance. It mostly just adds heft, but brings with it some faint toasted toffee notes. Tangerine is thrown in here as well, adding some fruity sweetness. Almost sugary at times. Yeast is a major player here too, as with most of Kzoo's stuff. There is plenty of weird shit going on in the background. Veggies? Gravel? Dandelions? Socks? Cardboard? These could almost qualify as off-flavors, but they are only ephemeral, quickly crushed under the hop tidal wave. They do, however, keep this from scoring a perfect 5 taste-wise. Hefty bodied, with tons of amphetamine-riddled tiny bubbles. Absolutely perfect for a big IPA. Has been, and will continue to be right near the top of my list.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jtw5877,4.47,"Pours a nice amber orange with a massive white head, Nice hoppy aroma, and a killer taste excellent hopiness, and a hint of Maudite?, I could be crazy, but one of the flavors I associate with Maudite is in there. Great hoppy beer to add to my arsenal.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,marc77,4.55,"Light golden hue w/ slight haze, topped by a creamy, cappachino like, sticky ivory white head. Trails of Belgian lace. Delectable combination of assertively citrusy hops, light caramel and mild tart fruity esters in aroma lend a vibrant, but rounded tangerine overtone. Crisp, sharp, hop bitterness hits the palate initially, then yields to citrus rind hop flavor w/ a distinct grapefruit note. Malt and yeast derived character is overshadowed by the strong hop profile, but notes of dextrinous light caramel and pearish tartness from Bell's yeast strain can be discerned. Well attenuated, dryish body. Finishes a lingering impression of lightly sugared pink grapefruit. Two Hearted is a delicious vehicle for Centennials. Malt is not showcased at all in this brew, yet manages to adequately support the assertive hopping. Superbly drinkable-- not unlike spiked carbonated grapefruit juice... but in a great way. Very unique. Would be an American classic if distributed more widely.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,zerk,4.25,"Clear orange-yellow with a thin white head. Aroma was abounding with hops (citrus and floral). When I first tasted the beer, all I tasted was grapefruit... I could almost detect some malt trying to sneak through and balace things out, but it couldn't quite surface. As the beer warmed a bit, the malt became more pronounced, and balanced things out quite nicely, making this a very drinkable brew. It has a medium body, and medium carbonation, with a slightly oily mouthfeel. Another fine beer from Kalamazoo!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,mjohn27603,4.79,"Pours with a great big head - three fingers. You can smell the hops just filling the air, also smell of grapefruit. Gold in color. First sip reveals a taste that delivers what the aroma promises. A nicely hopped beer but not overly so. The hops balances well with the citrus taste. Tastes of grapefruit rinds. This is one fresh bottle - thanks, Cloverleaf.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,AaronRed,4.37,"I just love this beer. Right off the bat, I could smell the hops. I did not even know what this beer was before I ordered it, but when it was placed in front of me, I could smell the hops- they screamed at me- wonderful smell of citrus. I knew this was an IPA. Taste was fabulous as well, of course, hops and more hops. Orange and slight grapefruit flavors balance this beer out- of course that it if you like the bitterness of an insanly hopped brew. For hop heads only.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,beernut7,4.52,"After sucking down a few malty bocks, I figure a touch of hops would do my buds some good. Decided on the Two Hearted and its light copper color and lacy whitish head. The aroma told me I has chosen wisely. The fresh burst of spicy hop punched me right in the nose and my mouth started watering. The huge hoppy spicy hoppy flavor is sharp and exactly the right contrast to any malty brew. The medium body helps take a bit of the edge off and brings out some of the malt to make this an extremely satisfying beer. The knife-edge sharp bitterness finishes the experience off with a great bite.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,jackndan,4.1,"Thick, rocky off-white head, with some lace. Copper colored beer, with haze and noticeable suspended particles. Very noticeable fruit sweetness in the aroma, with a hint of hops. The taste is all hops, from the start to the finish, very pleasant but without much malt.

287,1093,Wildman,4.97,"@ Bell's Eccentric Cafe  This beer was a cloudy orange color with some carbonation present. It formed a sudsy white head that left some nice lace(but could have been better if they had poured it right). The aroma was huge hops with malt and the usual citrus present in many Bell's beer. The flavor was of hops, malt and citrus and the finish was slightly bitter. On tap at the bar(or maybe it's this year's version)seemed a bit more citrusy than from the bottle.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,putnam,4.4,Fresh released 2002. Tasted with AVBC Hop Ottin. Nose of deeper citrus; more like tangerine and grapefruit. Overripe fruit. Lemongrass. Twigs. Pure and bright honey malt flavors with some exotic Asian spices. Commanding hop presence through to the long finish.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,proc,5,"The setting...a local bar near my home. Its the Opening Day of the Major League Baseball season. I have been ultra stressed out at work and at home and am looking for a hour or two of quiet, reflective, solitude. I leave an off-site work assignment and head to the bar to catch some of the Opening Day games. I sit by myself and stare at the 5 large TV screens. The first Two-Hearted arrives. It is a picture of perfection. Slightly cloudy, with a beautiful, whipped cream head. It begs for a sip. The bitterness takes over and the hop dance does its thing on the tongue. My stress starts to slip away. A couple of hours and a few pints later, I am completely relaxed and have reached a place we rarely get to go to. I am chillin' bigtime. It has been the perfect session beer. I have yet to have a ""beer moment"" quite like this one.  The actual review from 2002: This is one incredible IPA. The nose is that of grapefruit with a deliciously bitter hop taste. Pours out to a golden color, all its own. Its almost pastel in color. The head is large and reminds me of whipped cream. The taste excels. Yes the hops are huge, but their is malt here too. Enought to keep the big boys (the hops) from being overwhelming and giving this beer its wonderful character. The hop taste lives on long after the beer has been swallowed. The hops grab you and nearly make you beg for another sip. Once you find your palate likes hops, beers like this will hook you and your journey to all that is hop goodness will be well on its way.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Jon,4.92,"2003 (Tasted side-by-side with 2002 bottling 10/2/03):  Hazy golden with fluffy white head. Excellent retention and great lacing. Floral, resinous hop aroma. Grapefruit, grass, and additional herbal and hoppy notes on the palate. Deeply complex, yet structured. Medium-bodied, mildly carbonated and irrestible, an IPA for all seasons. I wish Kalamazoo bottled this year-round, not just as a fall seasonal. One of my personal favorites.  2002 (Tasted side-by-side with 2003 bottling 10/2/03):  Murky caramel color with a thick white head. Sturdy retention, excellent lace. Nose is more subdued than its fresher brethren's, however the floral hops still loom underneath a seemingly smoky aroma. Less floral, earthy hops on the palate but more yeasty, toasted quality than noted in other bottles from 2002. The bottle conditioning imparts deeper, more complex flavors that hit the palate a bit differently than the younger, more assertive, and hoppier 2003 version. Of course, this stuff tasted the same as the new stuff a year ago. Pleasant, smooth mouthfeel with some subtle carbonation. Great for a year-old bottle conditioned IPA.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Murph,4.5,"Pours a bright clear golden with a huge rocky head and a nice sticky lace. Smell is all hops, huge fruity/floral aromas, enough to singe the nose hairs. Balance is the first word that comes to mind for the flavor. Although it is not quite as evident when the brew is colder, as it warms it shows a very nice, very smooth malt character. Just enough not to let the insane hopping drive you insane. Piney, flowery, and citrusy hops abound and hold a party on the tongue. Fairly dry and nicely crisp and refreshing, this is one drinkable IPA with its great balance and completely undetected alcohol content. I was very impressed with this brew as I seem to have been with everything from this excellent brewery so far. A hopheads dream brew. Thanks to Deuce for the sample.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,packetknife,4.35,"Best IPA I've had, if it's really an IPA (people here make me doubt). I think it might be the first or close to perfect 'taste' I'd rated. I was floored, it might make me a long-term fan of IPA.  Bronzish-copper and cloudy look with a solid head that holds. Spicy and citrusy, hoppy as sin, strong. Lovely. Bloody sin lovely. Must try IMO.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,Viking,4.82,"[tried on draught]  O! This is some good stuff! Two Hearted is a seriously hopped brew. Herbal and citrusy, with a bit of a yeasty tang.

If I do, this will become a standard in my beer fridge.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,pbrian,4.82,"There's nothing tame about this beer. It jumps into your glass with a head that rivals most Belgians. The dregs of the bottle swirl around the light amber liquid like the milky way through space. You're hit with the most incredible barrage of aromas including apricots, orange rind and yeast undertones. In you mouth, it's pretty much all about citrusy hops. Malts? Who needs 'em? Finishes lemony with a spicy yeast profile establishing itself as the beer warms. Great beer, but what's up with that label? Thanks, proc, for the experience.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
287,1093,ADR,4.5,"Does taste like an IPA but is very hearty...  Medium head, long lasting. Hazy amber color, upcharge of streams of medium bubbles. Straw aroma with definite marmalade smells. Hoppy, bitey flavor, more like orange rind than grapefruit. Malts slightly cut the hops, preventing a ""back swallow"" burn and giving a lightly syrupy, medium body. Impressive fullness. Solid beer, definitely as interesting as Kalamazoo's fleet of Stouts. A mouth ""wrangler"" to some degree, but not catoonish. Its rare that I get particularly excited by an American IPA but the hops on this one are outstanding without being overwhelming, juicy and straddling the line between citric and minty but retaining a fresh sense.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",American IPA,95
