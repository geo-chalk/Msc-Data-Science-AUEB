113,571,Somnifex,4.86,"Oh! Hello there, you handsome gentleman...  First encounter with a stout, and it did not disappoint. Picked up a 550 mL bottle at my neighborhood boozitarium. Poured into a clean glass.  Looks perfectly black on pour, with a thick head, the color of fresh cream. Head dissipated fairly quickly, leaving a milky halo, and delicate eggshell lacing. Only at the barest edges, when drinking, could enough light pass to show a trace of mahogany.  Smell was coffee and dark chocolate. Taste followed suit–strong coffee and bitter chocolate, with just a hint of brown bread, lurking in the wings. Feel was silky-smooth.  I'm a fan.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,El-Heffe,5,The best in the world hands down. If only U.S. craft brews could lay off the hops long enough to make something other than a skunky IPA!,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,keithmurray,4.04,"Appearance - dark mahogany body with tan head  Smell - cola, dark chocolate  Taste - dark chocolate, cola, cocoa, roasted malts  Mouthfeel - medium bodied, medium carbonation, dark chocolate, decent lingering of flavor  Overall - good oatmeal stout, good flavors for the ABV and a smooth mouthfeel  Price Point - $10.99/4 pk",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Weisenbeer,4.3,Not a style I would typically seek out .... But this Brew is silky smooth and quite delicious ... Found at my local bottle shop in the refrigerated section .... It's a nippy winter's day and this is hitting the spot,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Wattie83,4.25,"Poured from bottle into a nonic pint. Let it warm for a few minutes. Looks pitch black with some ruby highlights near the bottom of the glass. A khaki head which fell to a cap. Smell is rather subdued chocolate, roast malt, coffee. Taste is cocoa, roast malt, black coffee, a bit of earthy hops and bitterness in the middle. Finish is pretty clean. Feel is light bodied, low carbonation, rather dry in the finish. Feel is pretty smooth too. Overall, this is a classic for a reason. It drinks very easily yet isn't sitting heavy. Aroma doesn't do justice to the flavor. I'd like a bit more body, but like the drier finish.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,TerryMills,4.1,Good flavor but seems a bit thin body for a stout .. Great beer either way.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,SlowPourInSlough,3.63,"L: almost black/very dark brown, small head  S: malty, treacly  T: Malty, dark chocolate, a little treacle, maybe digestive biscuit but very little sweetness  F: smooth, gentle bubbles, not as creamy as it could be  O: I'm a bit underwhelmed. It's fine - a perfectly decent pint. But it doesn't have as much body or cream as I like in a stout, and it didn't leave me feeling satisfied.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BubbleBobble,3.89,"Pours a near black with 1.5"" tan head that slowly recedes with light lacing. Nose is roasted barley, cocoa powder, and baking soda. Taste is subtle, dry roasted malt, barley, and baking chocolate; very little sweetness or residual sugar. The flavor is light on the palate and easily drinkable. Mouthfeel is soft and moderately full with gentle carbonation. Overall, it's a light, easy to drink stout that doesn't punish after a pint.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Broman,3.93,"Poured from a bottle.  Appearance - Very dark brown body with a modest head with the slightest tint of brown to it. Nice lacing throughout  Aroma - Dark chocolate, some roasted malts, hint of wheat  Taste - Roasted malts, mostly neutral on the palate,  Mouthfeel - Smooth, minimal carbonation, slightly heavy body which is great for this beer  Overall -Smooth drinker, great looker. Not pretentious but a very nice stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BitteNochEinWeissbier,4.26,"Look: Black that may show brown highlights when held to a light. 2+ finger light brown head dissipates to a thin but consistent and complete creamy cover. Lacing is very good.  Smell: Dark, roasted malt with sweet undertones. Light licorice and a touch or 2 of caramel.  Taste: Roasted malt starts things off and are quickly joined by those light licorice and caramel notes. There are some notes that are reminiscent of good coffee and cream as well as some hints of bittersweet/unsweetened chocolate. A very light roasty bitterness shows up at the end.  Feel: Smooth, soft, and silky. The body is medium-full.  Overall: A great oatmeal stout and the benchmark for the style. It definitely lives up to that reputation.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,KS_Augsburg,4.35,"A true classic and for good reason. This is an absolute delight, rich but without any heavy sweetness. Strong malt and rosted grain, wonderful body, silky finish. A very fine layer of phenols and alcohol. A real delight, and easy to drink, too.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,jonphisher,4.15,"This is one of those beers that brings a smile to my face as I pour it, the pour is see through and then its black in the glass. The head that forms is very pretty to look at, light brown, dense with very good staying power; full sheets of lace. This beer is a looker...  Nose is a chalky, cocoa powder, some light roasted malts; reminds me of tootsie roll in dry wafer form.  The taste is much of the same dry cocoa, oats, little bit of roast; actually more prominent in the finish, light tootsie roll; much like Tadcaster I get an almost sort of twang on the finish.  Light body, smooth, very drying on the tongue, carb is tongue coating but smooth and soft, some moderate bitter roast/char on the finish.  This beer is very good, it is smooth to the point of almost being creamy but it has roast and bitter chocolate to back it up; it goes down very easy and is a pleasure to look at. I love a good looking beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,hbeimers,4.09,"Great all around, especially the carbonation which lends itself to the aroma. Bitter yet smooth like a nice dark chocolate. Lingers on the palate, but not in an unpleasant way.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,nizzle8287,5,"Absolutely superb. Poured into a pint glass at 52F. Pours the deepest dark cherry; almost black with a finger of khaki head which dissipates down to a ring with an island that sticks around. Smell is rich caramel and chocolate. Taste is caramel, chocolate, plum, with delicious creaminess. Somewhat dry and bitter finish that gives off coffee and toffee. This beer has some complex character with a low ABV. Great carbonation and perfectly balanced. Not too sweet, not too bitter, and the taste morphs and develops with each sip; the changes with temperature are epic and delightful! Couldn't ask for a better oatmeal stout! Highly recommend!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Khocolate,4.35,"Pretty good Stout from Samuel Smith just wished the ABV % was higher, but very drinkable beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,JZH1000,4.25,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.  The look it almost black when held up to light, only letting a little through and revealing its true dark brown nature. A one finger head forms, but it fades to a fine cap pretty quick. Lacing forms right off the bat however.  The smell is quite rich with a dark chocolate/coffee note, with some yeasty dried fruit notes as well. Sort of like Guinness but sweeter and more pungent. Has the signature ""sam Smith smell"" as well. Not sure what makes their beers so unique but all their dark Ales have that characteristic, but.its hard to decribe.  Taste follows the smell with malts being the main event here. Not very fruity in flavor until the aftertaste. Lots of coffee undertones as well. Beers flavor is not as sweet, but still has that sam Smith signature sweetness with it. One of my favorite stouts out there.  Feel is rich and creamy with just enough carbonation bite to keep it balanced. Each sip is very smooth and almost velvety. Not super heavy though although it can seem that way at first.  Overall a delicious traditional oatmeal stout. Not americanized and really not hoppy at all, going more into roasty sweetness and focusing on mouthfeel and drinkability. Very good rich and malty.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Gary47,5,Very delicious.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,AlexandraDen,3.94,"Pours a deep and ruddy brown out of the bottle, resulting in an opaque body that borders on black when poured into a typical pint glass. A tight and creamy one finger thick head appears — over the next little while it collapses into a thick off-white cap that persists throughout. Thick lines of lace dot the glass throughout.  Wow, such delightful aromas of chocolate! For a stout that is not advertised as such, nor has any additives in that way, nor any ‘chocolate’ malts, it has a deep and rich cacao note on the nose. Caramel, toffee, moist cake aromas here as well, along with some toasted wheat. Very sweet character  Surprisingly silky smooth sip, the flavours following the nose but bringing out more of the oat character, which gives the beer a thicker body and a twang of bitterness. Though it is not as bitter as you might expect, not from any hop bitterness or any burnt/roasted malt bitterness. There is just a touch to balance out the sweetness. It is lighter than expected as well, which allows the sweetness to mix without being too cloying. Chocolate, roasted caramel malt flavours dominate here. There is a gentle dark fruit flavour such as dark cherries you may notice on some sips. Some coffee on the front of the tongue but it fades quickly.  Silky smooth body, the carbonation is lower and only gently pricks at your tongue, giving this a supremely smooth and creamy taste. It is medium bodied, lighter than you’d expect, and the finish is not as dry as advertised. A very gentle, subtle finish that leaves only a hint of chocolate, malt, and cacao beans in your mouth.  Surprised by this beer, I would say it’s more subtle than you’d think. For an oatmeal stout, it definitely goes for balance compared to many others. With all that said, if you expect a typical strong roasted/almost burnt malt taste with strong oatmeal character and an oily body with unique bitterness, you will be disappointed here. If you’re looking for an easy drinking stout, this is great. If you’re looking for a stout with chocolate flavours that isn’t overwhelming like some chocolate stouts or a chocolate stout without lactose, this is an excellent choice.  Overall it’s quite an excellent beer and absolutely has its place. I am glad I got two, as this is definitely an enjoyable beer you could knock more than a few back through the night.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,WoodBrew,4.04,"I got a bottle of this beer from the Woodman's in Onalaska, Wisconsin just outside of La Crosse. It poured an opaque dark with no head and no lace. The scent had roast malt notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with roast and coffee presence. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Joshhardigan,5,"As the label clearly states ""The Celebrated Oatmeal Stout""...  Poured a full four finger tan head right up to the rim of the pilsner glass. Very sweet malt notes on the nose, almost like a fresh bran muffin. Not quite as opaque and dark as the Samuel Smith Taddy Porter in the glass.  Just enough malt sweetness on the palate, like a really rich barley soup, full flavored without being overwhelming. Retains a little sweetness, whatever hops used are also light and sweet on the aftertaste. Perfect balanced flavor.  Body exactly right, slightly oily weight, not too thin not too heavy.  As close to a perfect Stout as I have ever had. Been revisiting old favorites and finding myself pleasantly surprised how well many have held up over the years. There's only a tiny handful of beers I give a perfect score to, and this is one of them. In fact, if I was forced to only have one brand and type of beer the rest of my life, I would choose this one. Richer and sweeter than Guinness, this one stout ticks all the boxes for me. No negatives, all positives, right down to the ABV... It lingers on the palate, with the complexity of a good single malt scotch. If I haven't been clear I really really like this beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Irish_Lush,3.89,"Quality beer that pours a dark brown with a thick head. After trying the Samuel Smith Chocolate Stout, this one was a disappointment. A bitter hop flavor, it's not nearly as refreshing as the chocolate counterpart. I've had better Oatmeal Stouts, but you could do much worse. I'd probably never get it again at the price point",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BGDrock,3.6,"Deep dark brown body, rapidly forming a solid, thick, mocha head, fine and with great retention. Fruity chocolate aroma - cassis, blackberry, black cherry - not so much roasty or rich, and even lightly floral. The taste follows suit, with fruity cocoa notes of dark fruit, acidic, with a bittersweet tang of espresso; medium light body and carbonation, verging on watery, although the oats, a bit of residual sugars, and a powdery feel help give it some substance; the semi-dry finish is long, with more roasty chocolate coming through, but still accompanied by distinct fruitiness.  Not what I expected, one of the fruitier stouts I've tried, nevermind one that isn't deliberately incorporating fruit flavours, and lacking body. In the end, it's enjoyable, and probably more so if you know what to expect. Edit - what I tasted is so far off other reviews, my batch is potentially off",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Tony787,3.88,I bought a bottle at the LCBO in Ontario 550ml at 5%. Poured a 2finger creamy head into pint glass. The smell was very nice coffee and chocolate malts . Taste was very smooth and creamy oatmeal with a hint of toffee and coffee just sipping on it Overall this oatmeal stout is very enjoyable to drink leaving a lace all the way down but it feels stronger then 5% Good beer Cheers,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

S: Roasted caramelized malts, earthy, oxidized minerals, a hint of chocolate. T: Chocolate, dark roasted malts, char, a light mineral taste, a sensation of yeast, it has a gorgeous short sharpness at the top and it stays atop the tongue. F: Smooth, heavy bodied, lightly dry mouthfeel and a bittersweet finish. Good carbo throughout. O: One of my favorite stouts! It is excellent tasting and works well with many foods. A very easy drinking and approachable Oatmeal Stout that is rich and complex. It is outstanding in it's style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,lagrluvr,4.52,"Looks like a stout should, and pours a nice thick tan head into a pint glass. Aromas are not as pronounced as some others maybe, but what is there very nice. The taste is excellent, with expected roasted malts beng the star. Nearly perfect balance and feel. One of the best stouts IMO, when you don't want any added fruits, coffee, etc. Perfect brew for a cool damp November evening. Every stout lover should know this world-class beer as a reference for the benchmark.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,KafkaAndBeer,5,"It's an absolute classic. Bubbling, thick and rocky tan head. Coffee and toffee on the nose. The palate carries strong notes of coffee and malted barley with grassy hop-bitterness in the background. Moreover, one can tell this stout was brewed with good water, and the result is incredibly drinkable. In my opinion this is a perfect beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

The is slightly sweet with a hint of bitter coffee to counterbalance it along with a slight hop tingle. Aftertaste is like roasted is like smores as the cocoa notes blend with the cracker malts.

113,571,JudasShuttlesworth,4.82,"Personally not a big drinker. When I do drink beer I prefer a darker, heavier beer. So it’s not often I’ll grab a pack at the package store and drink 6-10 in a night. But a few years ago a hole in the wall package store was selling these in single bottles. The price was abnormally high so I figured to try it. Since that day if I see this beer anywhere I make sure to buy it. Literally everything about it is what I look for in a brew. Full flavor, thick head, EXTREMELY smooth. Perfect.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Alieniloquium,3.58,"355 mL bottle. Black with a little transparency. Smells of roasted malt with a light creamy aroma. A touch metallic. Tastes of roasted malt with accompanying bitterness.

113,571,GoodTweetman,5,"I admit tremendous bias, for objectively, there may be better beers, but, for me, this is the definition of “beer”. This is my favorite beer. It is smooth, flavorful, malty, and perfectly balanced. You cannot go wrong with this beer. The only downside is it is probably not the best beer for refreshment in the heat of summer, but it can’t be blamed for that. My kudos to the brewers on what is a treasure.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Mrseanworldwide,4.26,"In recent years I’ve consumed far too many disappointing oatmeal stouts. It got to the point where I wasn’t sure I liked the style. So, of course I was relieved to love everything about this classic from Samuel Smith. Beautiful color and tan foam. The smell is roasted but not overly so. The taste is sweet and complex, yet so easy to sip, sip, away until soon enough all the beer is gone. Credit the healthy amount of carbonation, but also there truly must be something in the water.  When I want a lower ABV dark beer that doesn’t try to be anything overly fancy, THIS is a beer I can’t go wrong with choosing.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,LeBron_James,4.46,Pours black with nice slightly tan head. Asymmetrical and left some lacing on my glass. I swear this brewery scents their beer or something every Sam Smith stout has this super unique smell that I can't quite recognize or identify. It's very very nice though. I love the smell of this beer. Beautiful chocolate/caramel malt with some roast. Tastes of roasted malt and some faint chocolate notes up front. Some coffee on the back and this tastes like their imperial stout but a little bit sweeter. Some nice hoppy character here too that balances out the mild sweetness I'm picking up. Super nice taste I'm quite impressed with this one. The mouthfeel is a nice medium body but quite full for a 5% beer I'm impressed on this front again as well. It's not as pleasant as some of the 9%+ stouts out there but I do enjoy it. Medium carbonation that works very well with this beer.  Overall I like this one a lot. It's constantly sold out at my main bottle shop but when I find it it's a good day. World class oatmeal stout.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,cjgiant,4.13,"Near black in a full glass, some dark brown/walnut hues as the beer thins out. Near white head forms nicely on a pour and drops quickly to a collar with some lacing.  Expected coffee and dark chocolate seem to hide a bit behind a more cola nose. Note sure if the oatmeal is affecting this, especially at the edges, which have a root to nutty note. Weak coffee opening on a cold brew, but its a fleeting impression. Light with moderate leaning light carbonation, it cleans up fairly dry with a little roasted malt linger. Flavors of roasted malt, medium rich coffee, and a little cola in the back give an overall nice stout profile. There's a little brown sugar sweetness up front as it warms, but it doesn't permeate the rest of the profile.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Rug,4.16,"Bottled  I always love a good oatmeal stout, and this seems to be one of the classics of the style. I’m surprised that I’ve never had it, so I grabbed it along with some of their other stouts and porters to see what all the rage is about  Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of fluffy tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves spotty lacing  The aroma here is quite sweet, but refreshing in a way for a stout in the sense that it’s not weighed down by any bullshit. I’m getting aromas of dark roasted malt, light roast coffee, a pear-like fruitiness, and a touch of bittering hops  The taste loses a bit in translation from the aroma, but it’s still great. Up front I’m tasting milk chocolate, dark malt, caramel, and a touch of coffee. The swallow brings more of the fruity sweetness with notes of pear, nutty milk chocolate, smooth oatmeal, and light grassy hops  A medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation to create a very smooth and silky beer. Finishes mostly dry but coats the mouth  A delicious beer, super flavorful without being heavy and refreshing for a stout. I’ll definitely be getting this again",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,simonrgilbert57,4.3,"Looks like a fairly standard stout. Head is big initially but goes away after a few minutes. Smell is fairly malty but one note. The taste is sweet but complex. The oatmeal comes out in the back, preceded by more maltiness and a slight bit of cherry. Barely carbonated and feels fairly light. A stout one could drink a few of in one sitting. Overall I'd recommend. Look forward to getting it in an English pub one day.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,DaBeerNerd,4.6,"Nice head upon pouring the beer, slightly brown in color. Very dark beer (as expected of a stout). Upon first tasting the stout, I am greeted with a velvety medium full body and a strange flavour that could be the water they use for brewing, but other than that, notes of chocolate, oats, and perhaps a roasted coffee flavour.  Overall- A very nice brew that is certainly worthy of it's reputation. A bit pricey where I am, but well worth it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Truegent2004,4.09,"Nice foamy head, lots of lacing. Complex flavors of coffee, and chocolate. A little bitterness in the after taste. A solid Oatmeal Stout!

113,571,MNAle,4.14,"Deep and dark body, revealed to be a clear brown with a back-light, below a tall tan head, thick and creamy, from a vigorous pour into an Imperial tulip pint glass. The head develops a pitted and rocky surface as it recedes, leaving some strings of lacing behind. As the beer is consumed, the glass has sheets and strings of tan lacing from the top to the surface of the beer.  Aroma is roasted chocolate and figs. Some hints of coffee, but that is just the familiarity of the roasted smells.  The taste starts with the welcome flavors of English brewing, the minerals from the water and the flavor of the English hops and roasted malts, giving flavors of chocolate and dark fruits (figs and raisins). Smooth flavor and smooth body, with just a bit of bitterness, as from roasted coffee. The finish is sweetish, and yet dry.  The body is moderate to thin, as befits the English stout tradition.  Overall, excellent to sip by the fire on a near-winter evening here in the upper Midwest.

Lots of sticky lacing as the head receded. Now, it may be the power of suggestion, but I'd almost swear I can taste and smell the mineral notes imparted by the Yorkshire squares. Beyond that, this is a nicely-balanced and extremely satisfying pint. There's nothing here to slap you in the face. Pleasant mouthfeel, just the right amount of bitterness, clean finish. I could drink this all day long, and that is a compliment.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,bbrandow,3.7,"Look: Very dark brown, nearly black. Half-finger tan head that dissipates after just a couple of minutes.  Aroma: Smooth and sweet. Raisins, dates, prunes, chocolate, and carmel.  Taste: Oat, chocolate, and malt. Smooth with a mild bitterness on the back of the tongue and into the aftertaste. This is one brew that I like more going down but then don't love the aftertaste of. But soft and easy-drinking with a subtle warmth.  Feel: Light- to medium-bodied and not overly sweet or syrupy, which is nice. Relatively light in body for a stout thanks to the oatmeal.  Overall: Silky smooth and moderately malty, so it's an enjoyable drink in that respect. The aroma is very nice and the mouthfeel strikes a good balance -- it's neither too light nor overly heavy. But I think the overwhelmingly positive perception of this beer is boosted a bit more by the goodwill and nostalgia of the brand and labeling than what's warranted by the flavor and overall experience of drinking it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

I was pleased to see it's dark mocha color topped with a creamy head that slowly dissipates as it sits. The stout produces slight chocolatey and oat-like aromas.

Taste is roasted pecans, a touch of semi-sweet chocolate, the earthiness of root vegetables (minus any specific vegetable) , and a bit of wood. Light pleasant bitterness.  Feel : I've had this numerous times, though not recently, so had to double-check to remind myself of what the abv is. ( :O- 5%!)

113,571,Hooded,4.2,"Notes from 4/4/2020. poured from a 18.7oz bottle and split between a Rastal nucleated Teku glass and a pint glass. The body is black with 1.5 fingers of dark tan head in the Teku and 2 fingers of head in the pint glass. Head retention is normal. There's a .5in cap in the pint glass and a thin cap in the Teku. 4.25 The aroma is a little below medium in strength and of milk chocolate with a little dark chocolate, and sweet malt. The Teku gave much more chocolate aroma with nuance and the pint glass gave a light chocolate aroma. 4.25 The taste is medium in strength and of complex sweet malt, and very light chocolate with a light bitter finish. The flavor is stronger in the Teku. In the pint glass the flavor strength is between medium and medium-low. I just poured what was left in the pint glass into the Teku. 4.25 The feel is medium in thickness, creamy, smooth, and has a light level of astringency. 4.25 Overall, it's a solid beer. I don't get excited about it but it's outstanding. 4.00 More importantly, I proved to myself that this beer is better in a Teku glass, as most beer is. The only beer i prefer in another glass is Live Oak's HefeWeizen. It's my absolute favorite beer and I had it many times before owning a Teku. The damn Teku changes the aroma and flavor so much that it cancels the feeling of reliable comfort I get from HefeWeizen.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Has an earthy and roasted nuts kinda smell too.  Taste a lot of coffee, along with the smoke, roasted barley, and different nuts. Rest of the notes altogether have both a sweet presence in counterbalance to the earthy, bitter hops this beer has. But I also tasted some unexpected peppers, figs, and dates too.

T: Not as complex as expected for me, sweet and malty with notes of chocolate and caramel bitter finish (the taste also becomes noticeably more complex as the beer approaches room temperature). F: Very smooth, spreads over the tongue in waves rather than a mosaic O: Very tasty beer, would suggest getting this guy out of the cold zone if you want it to show it's true colors.

113,571,MaltsOfGlory,4.26,"550ml bottle  Pours a wonderful finger and a half of light brown head into my Samuel Smith nitro (British pint) glass. Looks very creamy and pillowy. Body is completely black, even when held up to the light, only small hues of mahogany appear. Head retention was maybe a touch better than average. A sturdy film, along with good initial lacing is left behind. Overall it looks quite nice so far.  Up front the nose has the sweet british malt aroma, almost molasses esque. A little bitterness/sour aroma. Notes of velvet chocolate. Not getting much of the traditional roasty or oatmeal notes, but I'm not used to drinking british beers. Overall very sweet, almost desert like, with a little bitterness at well. Smells pretty good.  It's pretty well balanced on the flavor. Not nearly as sweet as the nose would indicate, which is totally fine. Somewhat surprising hop presence, not terribly high, but again, way more than the nose suggested. Not really much oatmeal, that aspect stays true. Maybe just a hair of roasted malt, along with a nice malty backbone. Light caramel notes, though not biscuity. Very nice flavor.  Mouthfeel is interesting. Pretty light bodied, almost crisp. Carbonation is about medium. The beer is malty on the flavor, but there aren't any invasive sugars, it drinks relatively dry - pretty sure I like that aspect a fair amount. Yeah, it rounds out to be a super crushable stout, and doesn't assault my mouth with sticky sugars.  The drinkability is very high overall. It's tasty, light, dry, and goes down easy.  The appearance turned out decent. Lacing was present throughout most of the glass, but was certainly a little patchy. Tough one to grade here because it started out pretty strong. I think it's still a pretty good looking beer overall.  Overall this is a really pleasant beer to drink.

The pour produces 2+ fingers of variously bubbled frothy, somewhat lasting, mocha head that a moderate coating of lace. Aroma is dark malt notes of chocolate, fig, prune with hints of coffee and anise. Faint hops in the background. Taste is roasted malt notes of Tootsie Roll chocolate, toasted dark bread, molasses, prune, faint smoke with a light bitter character initiating at mid-sip, intensifying in the finish and rapidly diminishing in the aftertaste.

T: Almost no carbonation. Starts off with a slight bitter chocolate, then mellows and sweetens. Finishes dry. Don't really taste the oatmeal. Maybe it contributes to that creaminess.

One finger head that slowly dissipates into a thin tan film and ring. Nice look.  Nose: slight roasted malt, chocolate, burnt toast. But very slight. Maybe impacted by pint glass and currently stuffed nose!  Taste: roasted sweet malt, mild dark chocolate, bitter hops on the finish. Nothing over powering in thevtaste but quietly pleasant.  Mouthfeel: this is where SSOS stands out. Creamy, silky, smooth in the mouth. Medium carbonation is just right and tingles in your mouth. Really delightful and easy to drink but substantial enough.

113,571,DragonXero,4.66,"This is one of my two favorite beers. It is what you might call a chewy stout. It's extremely thick, yet fizzy, and filled with flavor. From the first whiff to the aftermath, it screams grains and a hint of brown sugar. The bottle is a presentation on its own, and it pours smooth and silky as any good stout should. It's far from the cheapest beer out there, but it's not among the most expensive either, and it sticks to you like a good meal. Others fight for a title, but this just delivers with a smooth, filling drink. This is definitely a winter beer, and it has all the right notes for winter. Nothing about it is truly overt, flavor-wise, even if the beer itself demands your attention.  You tend to forget it has alcohol, but you don't forget that it's a beer. The solid malty notes come from its flavoring, which omits hops entirely in favor of flaked oats and the brewing crystal and chocolate malts as well as roasted barley which all come through masterfully in the final product. If you want to get into beer tasting, this is a great way to start, unless you hate being disappointed after your initial trials! Go ahead and swig some overly-priced microbrew IPAs and Hefeweizens if you'd like to start out with painful starts, but this is the way to go if you want to start out with something delicious.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

S: sweet dark fruit, raspberries? Chocolate covered strawberries? Like 80% dark cocoa.  T: arrives mildly sweet, with some dark fruit, slightly sour (again, raspberry?), followed by malty sweetness and dark unsweetened cocoa. Had this at dinner so couldn't plumb the depths, but I am not doing this justice. Layers of fruity, cocoa, and roast complexity with some esters and hops.  M: Mid-weight and well-carbonated. Cleaner finish than expected.  O: this was an outstanding stout. Fruity, chocolatey, complex, and lightly bitter. Supremely drinkable at 5% ABV, and clean finishing but not thin.

I repeat: on draft!!! In Ohio!!! How cool is it that we get to experience this for the first time ever in the United States?  Appearance is classic black with a coffee brown sheen and a thick, creamy tan blanket that persists for a good while and clings in sheets.  Smell is toasty malt with nutty accents, cola, and a slightly pungent note of what might be pine, but is otherwise escaping me.  Taste is mixed nuts, light cocoa and tobacco in front of hints of smoke, black cherry, and a faint touch of Tootsie Roll deep in middle, with a slightly bitter but tangy finish.  Body is smooth, light to medium with a slick, round, semi-wet swallow.

S: Roasty and sweet, hinting in the direction of a wine smell! Malt and toasted oats give way to barley and water. A little bit of chocolate.  T: Predicted very well by the smell. Add to that, it's bubbly and refreshing. Slightly sweet and boozy, which is surprising given the light ABV.  F: Bubbly and light in the mouth, just a little nod in the direction of thick syrup without going in that direction much at all.  O: A well-balanced classic that one could drink quite a few of! In fact, I'm afraid I've never housed a sixer of these... What a dark smooth trip that would have been. Knock it back, y'all, this one is a stone house fixture on the battlefield of the beer landscape.

Notes of milk chocolate, toffee and caramel come through. Touch of bittering hops on the finish with a second wave of chocolate.

A beautiful spider web lacing clung to the sides of the glass. The body was too dark for any carbonation to be seen rising. The smell had some chocolate up front and very strong. Once it warmed a bit some caramels and nuts came out. The taste brought back the chocolate but it seemed it was more combined with the other flavors of caramel, nuts and some light toffee as well. On the palate, it sat at/about a heavy with a dry finish and left nothing harsh on my tongue. This is not a sessionable beer despite the low ABV.

Hit every pub ( they serve you if you can see over the bar) in each small village to try their local brews...we like what were called bitters. ...low carbonated, hand pump- pulled from the cellar.

Leads into chocolate malt, lots of graham with some light roasted coffee or milky coffee. Maybe s'mores with some blackberry jam.  Mouthfeel: Medium+ body with a bit of sweetness.

Lots of fruity aromas coming from this beer and not a ton of coffee or roasted malts that I enjoy in my darker beers. The beer taste is similar. It has the oat flavor but nothing super strong or take home about it. The beer sorta felt a little over processed to me, a little to balanced. The mouthfeel is nice and it is very drinkable.

113,571,Guppy314,3.56,"From a bottle, pours as a clear dark brown with a beige head. The surprisingly scant aroma of perhaps malt belies the seeming richness of the deep color. Flavors are moderated by oats, but not in a good way. Rather than a smoothed blend of malts and hops, instead they are a muddled mishmash. To the upside there are slight chocolate, roast coffee, caramel, and molasses. But overall, disappointing.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,1000lbgrizzly,3.97,"Black body, light cream-colored head, webs of lace. Looks thick, despite being 5%. Chocolate, oats and bread, toasty malt, and a bit of stone and minerality display themselves on the nose. Toasted malt, wet bread, stone, and plenty of sweeter milk chocolate comprise the flavor. Medium weight, smooth, calm carbonation. Much thicker, stickier, and more viscous than the alcohol or even the powerful flavors hint it would be- nice. The stone and soggy bread notes would have been good as nuances, but they came off a bit strong, especially in taste. Apart from that, this was a great beer.

The taste is about the same with maybe a very subtle roastiness to it in the after taste. Slight fruitiness. The mouthfeel is very creamy which is what I would expect from a oatmeal stout. Overall I wish this beer had a little bit more roastiness and milk choclate taste than the predominant caramel.

Aroma has mostly roast, but a smoothness tempered with oats and mild sweetness from just ripe dark fruit notes.  Taste is so good, smooth, roasted malt but not bitter or acrid, the oats in there do their magic, low abv helps the mouthfeel come of silkier. Not overly thick, one of the thinner stouts. Underpinnings of toffee. Earthy creaminess to it.

113,571,ThemThangs,3.72,"Smells like sweet dark fruit. Taste is a little sweeter, balanced, and less harsh than the American stouts/porters I've been drinking a lot of lately. The taste reminds me of chocolate, with some faint dark roasted coffee and caramel-esque notes. There is also something else in the background that tastes a little metallic or minerally to me perhaps? Just a little bit of bitterness. I only really detect oatmeal character when I slurp up the head. As with other British beers, this seems to get even better to me as it warms up a bit.

113,571,JonCorbett,4.24,"Appearance: A mix of really dark cola brown mixed with a hint of black cherry. A creamy tan head is moderate with medium sized bubbles and a moderate-fast attenuation leaving little to no lacing.  Aromatics: Sweet and fruity with a light scent of the oat, and subtle toasty caramel notes.  Taste: The aroma before the sip really helps accentuate the oat flavour profile, this is followed by a strong coffee/dark chocolate bitter. The finish is a relatively mild bitter, slightly dry and doesn't linger too long.  Feel: The carbonation reminds me of a slightly subdued soda, and the liquid itself is smooth and creamy - almost like lightly carbonated chocolate milk.  Overall: Stouts are probably my favorite style, and this being my first oatmeal stout it was a nice change from the coffee stouts and I usually pick up. I liked its stout creaminess and the sweet oaty nose, not sure about the finish - a little too abrupt for me, I like a mouthfeel that carries on a bit.

I can’t recall too many stouts or porters in general that I’ve liked more. It is a dark brown almost black with a nice, tan head. It is exceedingly creamy with a bold oatmeal flavor that really takes over immediately. Molasses and a very slight chocolate flavor are also present. This is sweeter than most oatmeal stouts I’ve tried, but not as sweet as many of the chocolate stouts. It has a very nice balance. Like most good stouts it is a meal in a glass. There is nothing revolutionary here, but just what you would expect from an expertly made oatmeal stout.

Finish is mildly bitter with a slight alcohol bite.  Feel: Slightly milky and creamy. Medium carbonation, although pretty high for a stout in my opinion.  Overall: Nice and balanced beer.

Taste of dark roasted malt without any harsh roast bitterness. The dark malt also has touches of cocoa as well as coffee but the overall flavors are malt.

113,571,Beginner2,4.35,"Another ""classic is as classic does"" from Samuel Smith. I know I'm drinking a classic because it seems so different from the seemingly extreme demands made by today's market. Yet Oatmeal Stout (and many of Smith's offerings) are classics because today's ""extremes"" would not have gotten good unless they had been built on the traditions of those such as Smith.  For example, who makes a stout whose foam sticks around like Smith's? Or for Smells, who makes a stout whose blended malts don't try to overpower... or who tries to distract from their lack of malt knowledge by using additives ? Certainly not Smith's. And for Tastes, who makes a stout whose water actually makes as big a difference as it does for Smith's. And don't forget the gentleness of those Yorkshire Squares.... particularly when it comes for this Oatmeal to sit softly in my mouth.  MJ's 1999 ""Guide"" gave Smith's Oatmeal 4 of 4 stars, very rare. Reviewed in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic ""300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"", he explains at length how today's brewers of stouts stand on the shoulders of Samuel Smith. I agree.  1/2/21 Just the 3rd of 3 in Samuel Smith's sampler pack. Always good to revisit the classics.

113,571,Stephenhaze,4.74,"I am a beer vendor and the receiving woman at one of my old stores and her husband adore this beer. She asked me if I could bring it into her store but we were out of stock at our warehouse. So I found a 4pk at another account and brought it to her, she was over the moon about this beer. Normally I would not drink many stouts. I ended up finding another 4pk and had to buy it to try it and give her and her husband each a beer out of the pack. I've never open a beer in my car but I had to see what the fuss was all about so the second I got out of the store I popped one open. In the bottle it seemed a little to carbonated but it tasted really really... Normal not like a coffee or chocolate stout, this shocked me. So I get home and pour it into a pint glass and was absolutely shocked at how dark the beer was because having first tried it in the bottle it didn't taste burnt or really stout like other very dark beers. After pouring it into the pint glass the over carbonation went away and the beautiful tan head laced the glass ever so slightly. It is a wonderful dark beer that will surprise you. This is my first ever beer review. In conclusion this is a dark oatmeal stout that has a balance between flavors that is unprecedented",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Knutson_16,3.75,"Appearance: This stout pours surprisingly dark which makes it seem like a really thick beer. It does have a fairly thick and foamy tan/cream colored head which makes the beer more appealing.  Smell: This beer has very distinct nutty aromas. The nutty aroma is intimidating at first but does become more appetizing after you start to smell the coffee and chocolate notes. Overall, this stout has some distinct roasty, malty notes throughout.  Taste: Although sweeter than expected, it does have some bitter chocolate notes. The taste is fairly nutty with some hints of toffee and oats. I would describe this beer to be very roasty with burnt malts, chocolate, and some less distinct notes of licorice. In comparison to other dark beers like Guinness, it is sweeter and has a more ""chocolate nutty"" taste.  Mouthfeel: Has a very smooth, silky feel when you drink it and is a fairly easy-to-drink beer. It does not seem to have as much carbonation in comparison to most other beers (in my opinion), so in that sense it adds to the silkiness of the beer. Contrary to its appearance, the beer feels fairly thin.  Overall, it is a decent beer that I would recommend to others. I appreciate that an oatmeal stout stays true to its name and does in fact taste oaty and nutty. However, it is a hard beer to get used to because of its sheer complexity. It does however have a perfect balance of sweet and bitter and isn't too overwhelming for first time oatmeal stout drinkers.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

As the head recedes there is some beautiful lacing. It really clings.  S: First sign I might not be a fan of this one. Malt of course but also light scents of leather, oatmeal and bread.  T: Drinkable but not what I thought it would be. Almost a generic taste. Very smooth but hmmm.... just nothing special about it. What am I missing? This is a 94 on BA? Taste matches smell almost to a T. A touch of rubber bike tire inner tube air. A touch of carbon paper, maybe Moxie. Damn I want to like this.. :(  F: Feel is typical Samuel Smith. Smooth drinking with a slight bit of overcarb which gives it a zing on the tongue. Not as good as their other beers I have tasted though. Probably because there is little sweetness to push back on the zing.  Overall I am not a hater but wouldn't buy this again. I was sure it was going to be special.

There is moderate bitterness. The flavors of oats is a secondary flavor that comes forward as the beer warms.  Feel: It has a medium creamy texture with moderate bitterness on the palate.

My first sip seemed to have a bit of a unique flavor on the front. I wasn't sure at first if it was supposed to be like that, and to me, it seemed very familiar. The back had a lot of chocolate, coffee, a little almond, and than it hit me. The unique flavor (which is subtle) was similar to well water. I read the bottle and found that its brewed with...you guessed it; well water. Keep in mind, its not overpowering, and in fact, my wife couldn't taste it. But growing up drinking well water, the taste is unmistakable; not in a bad way. In fact, I think it enhances all the flavors naturally. Very, very, tasty, and would say this was a great way to end an evening.  It feels very milky and smooth.  Overall I certainly enjoyed this one. I look forward to many more in the near future!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,PhillyB,4.25,"This was the last of 3 Samuel Smith beers I tried, and probably my favorite of the bunch.  Look: If you've ever seen a Guinness, you've seen this beer. Dark with a dense head that doesn't fade quickly.  Smell: Malt, coffee, and cream.  Taste: Exactly the same as the smell. I found it alarmingly similar to Guinness, only slightly better. Can't put my finger on it, but there's also something in the background mainly serving to enhance the main flavors.  Feel: Creamy goodness. Not a lot else to say about it, even the head was creamy. It felt like the beer had been topped with whipped cream.  Overall: I was very impressed by this beer. It ticks every box for an enjoyable stout, but lacks the ""wow"" factor to put it over the top. I would definitely return to it again though.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Smells only minimally roasty, with molasses, dark berry and bready notes. Much more roasty on the palate. Notes of dark chocolate, even the tartness to it reminds me more of cocoa or coffee than fruit. More molasses and berries can be teased out as beer is sloshed around the mouth. Finish is smoky, roasty, somewhat bitter, influenced by whatever small amount of classic English hops were put in this. Neither dry nor cloying, and not overly astringent, in spite of smoke, tart, and bitterness. Body is medium, perhaps a bit thin. In any case, it's an easy drinker.

The smell contains not as bold of characteristics with most other stouts. I think I can even pick up on the oatmeal.  This taste is again, very mild for a stout. It's certainly not light...at all. I still taste caramelized malts. Perhaps the normally noticeable coffee and chocolate notes are being tamed by the oatmeal.  The mouthfeel I'm getting here is smooth and crisp.

113,571,hopphead31415,4.35,"My brother strongly recommended this brew and he said it was legit and was the originator of all the beers of this style and sets the standard. Let’s be honest here: beer brewing goes way back to Britain centuries ago so they know what they are doing.  Look-It pours a deep black tuxedo of desire and beauty. The head comes in full and remains thick and creamy all the way down encrusting the glass in a sticky layer of dark colored lacing.  Smell-It smells of coffee beans and chocolate chips as well as a bready malt backbone that mixes together to serve up a strong aroma of desserts. Well, desserts for adults, because this brew has a solid 5.0% ABV.  Taste-It tastes like how the nose indicated HOWEVER it has a severely pleasant smoky taste on top of those notes.  Mouthfeel-It feels rich, creamy, and full. It is as silky smooth as the inner thighs of a freshly deflowered virgin. It is a full-bodied stout that is as rich as melted butter mixed with unicorn’s saliva.  Overall-This brew was as good as my brother said it was. Additionally, the ancient recipe of this variety and the high standards by which it is made makes it that much more delicious and admirable. I should say that this beer is better than Guinness.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Pours a jet black color with a nice 1-fingered tan head.  Smells of a malty, caramel, chocolate-coffee aroma.  The taste I was a bit disappointed with. As with most dark beers, it gets better as it warms up but never really knocked my socks off.

Taste isn't my style. Very light and heavily carbonated. I like big rich stouts,but for such a low abv, the beer isn't bad. This beer is big on heavily roasted malts and oatmeal. The light carbonation and slight hop flavor leaves an almost citrusy flavor that doesn't meld quite right with the other flavors.  Overall, good beer for the low abv, but not my style. Also maybe a tad bit too carbonated for me, especially for the style. I see it pairing well with a couple of chocolate chip cookies or oatmeal raisin cookies.

113,571,911CROFT,3.85,"550ml bottle into a Tulip. Paid £2.90 for a single bottle.  Pours an opaque, dark, inky black body with a slight ruby tinge that remains unchanged when held to the light. A two-finger in height, frothy, mocha coloured head reduces quickly to a thin cap, leaving behind small amounts of thick, sticky lacing.  The nose is light overall. Mild roasted malts, light brown sugar and earthy yeast are the most noticeable aromas with a touch of coffee and dark stone fruit in the background. The taste leads with lightly roasted malts and brown sugar sweetness before giving way to ripe, fleshy, dark stone fruit. A gentle roasted bitterness gradually builds from the mid-palate onwards and is joined towards the end with dark chocolate, sharp coffee bean, earthy yeast, as well as hard water and stone minerals to give a slightly dry, bittersweet finish. In the mouth, superbly fine carbonation and the noticeable addition of oatmeal give a silky smooth and creamy texture, but the medium body is a little lacking in weight and heft for the style.  Overall this is a very good beer, the mineral qualities from the stone fermentation process add a genuinely unique and interesting character but ultimately, the smell, taste and feel are all a little too light and delicate for my tastes. The relatively low ABV% and huge drinkability however make it an excellent choice as a session beer or a great accompaniment to a hearty meal, for these purposes I would certainly recommend it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,StartedwithSAM,3.93,"At 50°F poured into a clean Nonic Pint glass, palate and nose cleansed.  Appearance: This pours Black but when held eye level there is natural light penetration presenting a Darker Browner tint. There is an index finger of “glittering”, foamy head which dissipates quickly leaving no lacing.  Smell: Initially the nose presents, to me, the usual ancient well water smell followed by roasty, bready malt and as it warms the other usual characteristics of a stout present itself, mainly the cocoa.  Taste: The taste is concurrent with the smell, that of bread, oats and a nice cocoa finish.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with a slight crisp, drier feel to it at the back of the throat.  Overall: The balance of the stout flavors and oats are excellent. As a novice I have grown to really appreciate the basic styles brewed right. Samuel Smith’s, as a brewery, is one of my anchors when I become fatigued with the complex experimentations of others. While my only critique is the lack of viscous mouthfeel of their stouts I have learned how to appreciate it. This is another great offering from Sam Smith which I will keep in my regular rotation throughout the year.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,Mike_Honcho1,4.57,"Look: Poured black with a nice and creamy tan head, leaving behind good lacing in the glass.  Smell: At first I picked out roasted malt, a bit of coffee and cocoa with oatmeal. On second sniff I picked out dark cherries and other dark fruits with a very faint hint of the alcohol.  Taste: Coffee, Bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts on the taste. Slight hint of the dark fruit to back it up. I also can pick out the oatmeal in the taste.  Feel: Nice and creamy but a little bit watery for my liking. I wish it had a bit of a thicker mouth feel for an oatmeal stout but I have to remember it is only 5% ABV and not a RIS. The wateriness does not take away from the experience of the beer.  Overall: I like this oatmeal stout very much. It is a sessionable brew with nice flavors to match the nose.

113,571,doktorhops,4.4,"Not only am I about to consume an Oatmeal Stout for your reading (and my tasting) pleasure but this is none other than Samuel Smith's much celebrated and widely known in all the counties of England and further ashore including Ireland, the Isle of Man and Jersey Islands invigorating, energising and revitalising Oatmeal Stout†. Or something along those lines - the label did look like it had been designed in the 1850’s. And you know what? Frugality like that (i.e. not paying for rebranding in over a hundred years) is rare these days and Samuel Smith has it in spades, cheers Mr. Smith!  Poured from a 550ml bottle into a nonic pint.  A: Well I accidentally hard poured a khaki head of 2 inches... looks good though with its deep dark cola body. Can’t wait to dive in... yep *taps fingers*. 8/10.  S: Espresso coffee notes mingle with hints of dark fruit and a melange of roasted barley and rolled oats... possibly the most porridge-like beer my nose has inhaled. I like it when my Oatmeal Stouts have oat aromas, like a big glass of breakfast! 8/10.  T: Damn tasty. More on the dark fruit side than coffee/chocolate with those oats really coming in to play with flavour and body. They (the oats) take on dry/tannic qualities towards the finish and there is an amalgamation of bitter/dry/sour/sweet characters that really make this fine Stout shine. Did I mention this is ‘damn tasty’? Oh... right... well this is Stouts finest hour. 9/10.  M: Medium bodied with a fairly lively carbonation. Oats = Chewy. 8/10.  D: Again I’m a big fan of the Samuel Smith’s ales, they’ve all so far been like getting inside a time machine and going back to the 19th century where men were men and women were men too (everyone was a bit hardier back then overall). If you want a real damn tasty and luxurious Stout then look no further. 10/10.  Food match: Back in 1852 when you had to work 16 hrs a day you would generally eat gruel and drink 18 pints of Stout, people wore hats that contained small anvils to help strengthen their neck muscles. Today however beef stew is a better option.  †Thesaurus Nazis will have noted that the three words ‘invigorating’, ‘energising’ and ‘revitalising’ all mean the same thing, congratulations‡. *slow clap*  ‡Syntax Nazis will have noted that I used the ‘dagger’ character BEFORE and instead of the ‘asterisk’ character for my footnote, congratulations. *slow clap*",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Albianfire,2.37,"Look: pours like a standard stout. Dark almost opaque with about a finger of head (gentle pour) that dissipates quickly.  Aroma: Not much there. Some roasted notes from the dark malts and dark chocolate. Not much fruit for me. Alcohol is present.  Taste: Again, not much there. Little hops (appropriate to style). Mild burnt coffee, a hint of chocolate. I find myself searching for more but unable to find the depth of a great stout. Some alcohol on the finish but not in a pleasant way.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and pretty full. The best point in my opinion. I enjoyed the body.  Overall: Disappointed twice now on this stuff. I know it is rated high and everyone has different taste buds.

113,571,JohnnyI,4,"Samuel Smith has a nice package deal out right now that includes their IPA, Organic Chocolate Stout, Oatmeal Stout, and a branded Irish-style imperial pint glass. Today I chose to give the old Oatmeal Stout a proper review. The beer pours with a giant, frothy cappuccino colored head, a full 2 fingers over the top of the glass. Picturesque! Like a root beer float. The awesome staying power of the head lingers over a deep black liquid with slight transparency and cherry accents. A distinct but mellow browned butter aroma greets the nose. Along with hints of raisin, smoke and minerals. The flavor is of mildly sweet butterscotch with subtle sour bitterness. Lime-like spiciness meets a roasted character with an herbal tobacco taste in the finish. It's a nice marriage of flavors, but the bitterness, though not excessive, still manages to overpower the malts a little. The brew is medium-bodied with adequate carbonation. Unremarkable, but suitable for the style I suppose. Overall, this is a staple for a reason. There's quite a bit of character packed in to this tame ABV offering from the English legend.

After having Founder's Breakfast Stout, I've been on the lookout for this brew and was fortunate that my local craft beer store had it in stock.  Pours a dark brown body with a huge, fluffy tan head. Great lacing! Lots of oats and nuts in the nose, with cleaner in the background. Upon first taste, nothing other is oatmeal is present, but quickly the dark and roasted malts assert themselves. Sweet milk chocolate shows up towards then end to round out the flavor profile. Nice touch. Feels smooth, carbonated and very, very drinkable. Definitely lighter than I expected with almost zero bite. Overall, this oatmeal stout is much simpler than other American stouts (lower ABV, no syrupy qualities, or caramel notes), and therefore, can be critiqued for being a bit two-dimensional, but maybe I'm biased.

S – Roasted black malt, light aroma of cold pressed coffee. Bitter chocolate hides a bit in the background. Hop aroma is difficult to find, perhaps slightly earthy.  T – Leans a bit more towards the chocolate malts, roasted coffee is much lighter. I do get where some people compare it to “soy sauce” flavor, but I think it’s just the bittering black malt combined with background notes of earthy hops.  M – Moderate carbonation, enough to give a bit of a scrub for the bitter malts. Moderately heavy body, somewhat silky from the oats. Mild sweetness to match with the mild bitterness.  O – A solid oatmeal stout, very straightforward, no flash because none is required. Just enough bitterness to be well-balanced.

Back label gives a nice description of the beer, a nice back story on the beer, web info, and a bit of brewery info. Gold foil wrapped neck. Has “Samuel Smith” and “Bottled at Yorkshire's oldest brewery est. 1758” embossed on the bottle.  Appearance: An aggressive pour from its 550mL brown bottle into a 16oz English pint led to a 3 finger light but slightly creamy tan head atop a deep cola brown colored beer that lets almost no light filter in. Head retention was great at 6min flat before fading to a thick rocky coating and ring with excellent lacing.  Smell/Aroma: Smell is slightly nutty with a bit of grain and a nice oat aroma along with a milk chocolate, roast coffee, and slight molasses aroma.  Flavor/Taste: Tastes is of roasted oats and grainy nutty malt on the front end along with a nice toasted chocolate malt sweetness. Midpoint has a very nice molasses sweetness that comes through along with more cooked roasted oats and a deep roasted coffee malt flavor. Back end is very heavy on roasted chocolate and coffee malts that leads to a roasty finish.  MouthFeel/Drinkability: On the full side of medium bodied that leads to a thick, creamy, and smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable and not very filling for a thicker full bodied beer.  Overall/Comments: Wow! This is one tasty stout that is extremely well done. This has a very good flavor profile and nose along with a nice body and drinkability. This is a must try stout.

Flavors follow the nose with rich chocolate and some molasses followed by a light bitterness to the rear with a hair of coffee.

Smooth and sweet, in addition to a taste that has been very well refined, this is one of the easiest drinking beers I've ever had.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,TheStoutScout,5,"My favorite beer. It reminds me of simpler times. It's simple. So simple, it's perfect. I can drink this every day, at any temperature, with any meal. This is the definition of a beer. No bells, no whistles, nothing pretty. This is BEER.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ZebraCakez,4.16,"It pours a nice deep black color with a caramel colored one finger head that dissipates slowly. The aroma is that of chocolate and fresh bread. Taste is that of chocolate and malt, a nice spicy note comes in strong. Not terribly complex, but a great example of a nicely rounded stout. Feel is thick and creamy, sticks to the mouth and leaves a pleasant chocolate note that lingers. This is a great beer, one that I will be coming back to in the future.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,WhiteHillsStore,4.11,"Really enjoyed this one. Pours a thick black with a khaki colored head. The smell was full of oatmeal and malt, with some sweet cream and milk chocolate in there too. The taste was heavy and a bit decadent with a milkshake like consistency. Lots of sweet chocolate and coffee flavors through out. Overall was very nice and very rich. Loved it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Tsar_Riga,4.52,"A - Pitch black, opaque, with a light tan head that slowly reduces to a thin tan film. Lacing is big on this one, leaving elaborate patterns down the side of the glass.  S - Particularly as this one warms, this hits the nose with chocolate, fire-roasted marshmallows, and toasted bread and grain notes. It is one of the most pleasant bouquets I've ever enjoyed from a beer, squarely what I hope for when I pick up a stout.  T - The start is full of sweet bread, caramel and chocolate notes, moving to toasted elements mid-point, fading to a more bitter close, with just a dash of metallic notes that detract.  M - Full and slick, with none of the sliminess that sometimes plague oatmeal stouts. Drying in the close keeps the heaviness of the opening from becoming cloying or weighty.  O - A fine stout. A very fine stout. Ultra-orthodox, and proud of the tradition it springs from, it offers a far better option at the price point than many a flashier stout from brewers on this side of the pond. What I will grab when a pure stout experience is what I'm after.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Gajo74,4.5,"Pours a viscous, thick, syrupy dark brown, almost black, opaque color. A tan head gives way to a sticky lace that retains throughout. Aroma is intoxicating. An earthy, roasted malt, bread and hint of burnt sugar. Taste is grainy, malty sweet, creamy, with a slight hops finish. Taste gets even better as the drink warms. I drank it without food, but would love to try again with chocolate. Feel is robust and full bodied; a meal in and of itself. Active carbonation that settles as the drink warms. I loved this beer and consider it an excellent example of stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,S_Weinstein95,4.75,"Appearance: Almost completely black with a nice, mild carbonation and a lovely tan head that dissolves into a beautiful lacing.  Smell: Strong malts upfront with a much more reserved earthy, biscuity smell on the tale end. A touch of coffee his the nose as well.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly smooth and creamy. Very light on the tongue and goes down incredibly easy.  Taste: A great, roast flavor from the get-go. A nice, roasty taste comes next with caramel and some coffee notes. A great, mild hop flavor on the tail end with a clean finish provided by the oatmeal.  Overall: An excellent offering of this particular style, one of my favorite oatmeal stows out there and one of the best overall dark beers I've yet to taste. Far better than other offerings such as Guinness.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,interzen,4.7,"550ml bottle poured into a nonic pint glass  Look: Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a couple of fingers of tan head and some lacing. It looks ... like a stout. No real surprises.  Smell: Quite earthy with some faint metallic notes. Unsurprisingly, there's a strong maltiness too.  Taste: Roasted oats and malt with a hint of coffee and chocolate/cocoa. The cocoa isn't nearly as pronounced as it is in the chocolate stout but it's definitely there. Quite a 'full' flavour with a fairly clean finish. Not much hop in evidence, as this is very much a malt-forward brew.  Feel: Smooth, with a fairly dry finish - there are some nice smoky flavours peeking through at the end. Not nearly as heavy as some stouts can be, and eminently drinkable as a result.  Overall: Taken in isolation, this is an absolute belter of an oatmeal stout and worthy of anyone's time and attention. That said, it's probably the weakest of the Sam Smiths stout lineup (the Imperial is my favourite) but then it's up against some pretty stiff competition. Best enjoyed at your leisure - this really is too good to just chuck down your neck with wild abandon.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Strong roasted malt up front, followed by nutty, coffee notes and caramel sweetness. Earthy without being pungent, very mild hops at the end followed by a clean palate. Overall: A thoroughly enjoyable stout, much more complex than Guinness in its array of flavors, a very enjoyable beer. I would definitely put this as a tasty, go to oatmeal stout.

113,571,utopiajane,4.14,"Pours not completely black. It has darker brown hues and from the very middle of the glass emanating softly is a shy ruby blush. Fat mousse like head of mocha colored foam that lasts, falls to a ring and leaves lace. Nose is deep with roasted malt scents. There's a sweet lush caramel , a bit of weak coffee, bitter chocolate and some scent from oats in the background as well. This beer has an earthy woody scent too that is hard to pin down. Taste is luscious. Smooth, creamy and full. The sweet caramel is first to grace the palate and then a big roasty taste follows. It has a bit of bitterness to it and it dries on the tongue leaving the coffee a bit stronger than on the nose and the bitter chocolate to come to finish. At the last moments there is that woody and earthy taste again with that sweet and very soft caramel to linger alongside all those big roasty flavors of bitter malt. I detected no hops on the nose and I can find none on the palate save for that bit of woodiness and to say this beer is well balanced and a delight to the disposition if you ask me. I like it precisely because it's not too sweet although it has an ample sweetness.

113,571,Vogie,4.5,"Served in a Samuel Smith pint glass.  Pours a silky blackish brown with a nice 1 inch of cinnamon colored head that breaks down slightly to a pancake batter like cap. Aromas are subtle with hints of roasted malts, dark fruit sweetness, and maybe a touch of coffee. Taste is awesome upfront with sweet sugary notes of dried plums, raisin skin, cream, and ends with a nice but not overpowering roasted malt finish and slight earthy hops. Perhaps a lingering of cocoa powder as it warms. Mouthfeel is creamy and delicious. Medium-dry with a higher than average amount of carbonation for a stout.  It isn't earth shadering and it doesn't scream buy me at the beer store when there are a hundred other oatmeal stouts to chose from, but man is this good. A truly world class beer that has been around for ages and is easy to forget about amongst the chaos that is craft beer.

Subtle slightly toasty with a bit of red wine aroma.  Very dry with some bittersweet chocolate notes. Very rich and earthy. Picking up some cola and caramel notes.

Interesting, inviting and formidable nose.  Taste - chocolate and some sugary sweetness come to the forefront, before receding into a smoky bliss mixed with oatmeal. Very tasty and full flavoured and quite different from other oatmeal stouts I've had.  Mouthfeel - smooth, velvety and creamy, light bodied yet full flavoured and packs a nice punch.

Light bodied with little texture. Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is laid back. It consists of a blend of light roast and chocolate with a distinct mineral note. If you look for it, you can find the oat character. The finish has a slight metallic twang to it.

Taste: Malt, coffee, and some chocolate.  I love this beer. Big malt with coffee and chocolate greeting you with each smell and gulp. The taste has a little bit of a tang to it; kind of like coffee that you've brewed but let it sit in the pot until it cooled (it works for the good in this case).

This one comes in a large 550ml (18.7 ounce) bottle but have seen in in smaller bottle in a 4-pack for around $10. Bottle chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured in to a handled glass stein.  Pours a almost black in color with a good 3-finger thick creamy tan head that left lots of lacing when sipped. The aroma is of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and some oats. The taste is fantastic with lots of good favor from the above said items. Very smooth with no bitter finish. I can drink this one when it is 0 degrees or 90 degrees outside. Nice smooth finish with no bitterness or harsh aftertaste at all. Medium bodied with perfect carbonation.

Pours black enough, with a 1/2-finger light-tan head, that sticks around enough to leave a little etched lace. Aroma nicely interesting, initially of fruit and sweet chocolate, then caramel and hop spices as warms. Begins with a little hop bite, then smooth caramel, and mild roast malts lead into hoppy finish.

O- This is maybe the best sessionable stout I have come across and I'm glad I can easily find it at my local grocery store, it's even on sale from time to time. I do wish I could find it on tap more though. All of Samuel Smith's dark beers are impressive and I suggest everyone try them at least once.

A moderately frothy beige head starts at two fingers but eventually simmers down to a khaki film on top of the beer. Not overly impressive, but great color for a stout sitting at only 5% ABV.  S: Nose is definitely a little more subdued and cleaner than most stouts, but some oatmeal, mild roast coffee, and milk chocolate can be detected.  T: Unlike the nose, the flavor is quite substantial. Loads of sweet malts up front. Oatmeal, chocolate, toffee, light hints of brown sugar. The middle gives way to some roastiness. Mild morning coffee.  M: Feels bigger than it actually is. Hefty medium with a ton of creaminess. Truly superb for a brew with an ABV as low as this. The carbonation is a bit too crisp and demanding for my liking, but that's but a small complaint.  O: I'm enjoying this quite a bit. I usually like my stouts a little bigger than this, but I have to say that the drinkability of this is without a doubt unmatched, and given how popular/available this is, it'll find its way back into my fridge for sure.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Very slight roasted malt presence  Mouthfeel: Medium body; Smooth as silk with a dry finish  Overall: I had the Taddy Porter and this back to back and find the two very similar, with this having a oat character of course, less dark fruit, and a more pronounced chocolate and toffee character. Both are solid offerings if a little light. However, SS do make some of the smoothest beers I've had. I prefer this over the porter, but ill stick with the imperial stout over both of these for now.

113,571,arc3636,4.86,"Pitch black in color with tan head. Coffee and chocolate aroma. Taste has many layers, coffee, chocolate, toffee, cream, soy sauce. Nicely carbonated.

I'll definitely pick up a few of these next time i see it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ArchaeoFiero_TheDelorean,5,"This is the perfect oatmeal stout, and one of my favorites of all stouts more generally. I grab one or two of the large bottles whenever I happen across a Trader Joes. I've noticed that TJs stocks this (and Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale) in the US from sea to shining sea.  SS's Oatmeal Stout excels in all categories, but to me, its greatest accomplishment is its mouthfeel. This is one of the smoothest beers that I've had the pleasure of imbibing. It literally feels like liquid silk, and if you want a great representation of a silky beer, this is the one that I would prescribe. It's perfectly carbonated for the style as well, and never seems to go flat, no matter how long it sits in a glass.  The taste is of espresso and strong, complex dark malts, with a wonderful bitterness that is balanced by its dry but sweet finish. Hints of chocolate and honey are there too, which really compliment the porridge backdrop.  The smell too is rich, with hints of caramel and sweet grainy malt.  All in all, it's a nearly perfect beer, and its great availability makes SS's Oatmeal Stout a must try in my opinion.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ramonjkk,4.73,"The best oatmeal stout I've ever had and the standard which other oatmeal stouts are measured by.

Hints of chocolate, coffee and heaven.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,sulldaddy,4.31,"Sampling a cellar temp bottle poured into a snifter. The beer is a rich chocolate brown hue with little light passing through the glass. I get a bit of creamy beige head of maybe 1 cm that fades quickly to a clingy edge layer. Tight lattice develops after each sip. Aroma is toffee and chocolate malt, a little graininess too, maybe oats? First sip reveals a velvety smooth body and very gentle rolling carbonation. The bubbles are fine and a little spacious, adding to the smoothness of the beer. Flavor is malt through and through, with chocolate and some brown sugar dominant up front. I dont get any real hop presence on the flavor piece of this beer and there is no alcohol either. Generally sweet and malty from start to finish with this one. A solid oatmeal stout that feels great and tastes good. Definitely worth buying if you are a malty.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Auraan,4.44,"Poured a rich, deep opaque black, with dark brown highlights around the edges when held to light and three fingers of thick tan head that receded slowly and left abundant lacing down the glass. An excellent stout appearance, exactly what you look for in the style. Scents of soy sauce, roast malt, notes of dark chocolate, hard Yorkshire water and Samuel Smith's yeast. As it sits chocolate aromas become more prominent, alongside some faint hints of coffee and roast malt. There is also a low level of floral hop aromas. A very good, balanced, wonderfully presented oatmeal stout aroma. Flavor begins with a semi-sweet flavor profile reminiscent of dark chocolate with roasted malt undertones and notes of coffee with cream. Moves into a more bitter flavor, though still with an underlying slight sweetness and a greater flavor of roast malt. Finishes semi-dry with a roast malt presence and notes of coffee with cream. Aftertaste is roasted malt bitterness and hint of nuttiness from the oats. There are slight earthy notes throughout, mingling with the roasted malt flavors. A very nice overall flavor profile that is complex and deep, yet approachable and rustic. Very true to style. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with medium carbonation and a smooth, creamy, slick feel. Very true to form for the style and quite the wonderful beer to drink as a result. Overall this is an excellent, classic example of an oatmeal stout. It hits the style perfectly from aroma, to flavor, to mouthfeel and is simply a joy to drink. A wonderful beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

I didn't realize it was the same maker of Nut Brown Ale and I wasn't disappointed since that beer is fantastic and drinking this, it proved the same.  Appearance - A very dark amber with a thick head and lacing.  Smell - Sweeter smell than a usual stout. Probably owing to the fact that oatmeal stouts are sweater. The bitterness comes as an after taste but it's a good bitter.  Taste - Tastes like a quality stout that's less bitter and a sweet.  Overall - A great stout for someone who is new to stouts like me. Not really bitter and more sweat but it still retains its stout characteristics.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Perfectly balanced.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Lordhelmit,3.05,"A - A good appearance for an oatmeal stout - the best out of all outmeal stouts I've tried recently. Dark of course, with a nice decently thick head upon pouring, and a persistent, though small, head throughout. Color is dark with some ruby undertones. Plenty of lacing.  S - Honestly I don't really smell much. Smells kind of sweet, kind of oaty and kind of coffee-y. Not bad I guess, but a bit disappointing.  T - Okay. A bit hoppier than I was expecting, but still has a definite roasted nutty/chocolatey flavor with a hint of caramel toffee.  M - Thin bodied. Not what I was expecting for such a dark beer. Tastes almost watery. Little carbonation though, goes down easily.  O - Overall I must admit I am slightly disappointed after reading the reviews on here. It is not bad, but it is also not the best oatmeal stout I've had. I might purchase again, hard to say. Probably not, since the store I buy it from sells it for $3.50 a bottle and I can get a better tasting oatmeal stout with more abv at the same price.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

(I've tried only one better but can't for the life of me remember the name. Very homey. Oak and coffee with nut flavours. Goes down smooth with a slight bit of a bitter aftertaste. Nothing harsh or undesirable. Overall a strong , sweet, delicious stout. Looking to try more from this brewery and expand my options. My only complaint is how rapidly the head broke down.

113,571,John656,3.88,"A - Dark, dark, and more dark with a brownish hue if held up to the light. Beige coloured head exhibits solid retention.  S - Could use a stronger nose, but there are hints of oats and roasted coffee.  T - The flavour primarily consists of oats and roasted malts and is not overpowering. Excellent semi-dry finish which has a touch of sweet dark chocolate and bitter cacao.  M - Silky smooth like an Oatmeal stout should be. Medium-bodied with a low carbonation makes this an easy drinking stout.  O - Delicious. Love the finish and consistent flavours that don't try too hard too impress, they just do. This was surprisingly thinner than I expected but it somehow just works for this beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Foyle,4.11,"Appearance: 2"" dark cream colored head recedes slowly. Moderate lacing. Color is dark brown with no carbonation visible due to the opacity. Aroma: strong aroma of coffee, chocolate, licorice, cocoa. Mouthfeel: lighter than I would expect but still medium bodied with a dry finish finish. The oats add a silkiness to the mouthfeel. Flavor: pick up the oats, chocolate, cocoa, some licorice, not as much coffee as the aroma, but there is an astrigent dryness in the finish.

Smell: Smells sweeter than I'd expect for an oatmeal stout, with some milk chocolate and slightly roasted notes.  Taste: A great improvement from the nose- this one is no milk stout though it almost smelled that way. Nice complex overlays of roasted coffee and dark chocolate flavors (despite neither of these being actually present in the beer). Somewhat smoky at times, but with a nice soft edge from the oatmeal.  Mouthfeel: The oat really adds some nice, soft smoothness. Good carbonation for the style too.  Overall: Another good beer by Samuel Smith's and one I would definitely recommend trying. I love the low ABV in this one- it's a tastefull, delicious beer and at 5% won't leave you crawling after such a big bottle.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Sour on warming akin to prunes. Not too much here, just a standard stand-out stout.  T-Sweet, sugary. Bitter dark roast coffee. Bitter cocoa. Cereal. Obvious oats. Lactose notes. Slight dark fruit sour ending. Pinnacle of a stout in taste.  M-Great medium body sips thick and smooth. Low-high to Medium-low carbonation. Feel is grainy, dusty and powdery thanks to the flaked oats. Body could use more fizz, but this stout sips well regardless with an inky cool feel. Bitters, sours and sweets keep the tongue interested as well.  O-A classic for a reason. Not just a great oatmeal stout but a great stout period. A great beer. Plays it safe in a few categories but that's just this stouts' style. Good as is.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Aroma is noticeably sweet with caramel malts and hints of chocolate.  The sweetness doesn't translate into the taste. The hops cancel it out, but not in an overly bitter way. It comes off as very clean and crisp with a heavy carbonation.  I definitely agree with the a previous review of letting it warm up a bit. It gets much smoother as it warms...very drinkable.  Did I mention it was vegan?? :)",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,DarthPaul,4.28,"From 18.7 oz bottle poured into pint glass.  Appearance: Pours dark as hell, as to be expected. Some light barely gets in on the edges. About 2 fingers worth of a head, maybe more. Head is tan/light brown and sticks around for a little, with a lot of lacing.  Aroma: The Aroma is pretty straight forward, kinda boozy. Nutty, malty doesnt smell as sweet as I thought it would.  Taste: Smooth as hell even with a slight hop bite. Not that malty but its there. slight bitterness at the end. Again not as sweet as I expected, though that isnt a bad thing. As for mouth feel, I think it's pretty thin for a stout.  Overall: I'm surprised this beer is so low on abv, it smells and taste like maybe a 7.0 abv, but moving right along. This beer is damned drinkable. No harshness, no incredible bitter or dry finish. The finish is just right, actually, a little dry, a little hoppy. It's actually hard for me to express how easy it is to drink this beer. I'll probably fall back to this stout when I want to drink a good beer and a lot of it. Well done.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,CalgaryFMC,3.91,"Enjoyed from 550 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. A dark coffee brown brew with reddish tinting and a decent-sized brown head. Aroma is rich and malt-forward, with cocoa powder, fruity yeast like apples and pears, medium-roast coffee, and a faint caramel sweetness putting in appearances. A well-rounded, sophisticated, and multifaceted brew as one would expect from such a classic, featuring chocolate milk, almond, caramel, vanilla, and coffee flavors, with the caramel gaining traction later as the dark malts lose some steam. Sourish and tangy from acidic dark malts and fruity yeast esters, yet smooth and creamy. The body is lighter than expected. Finishes long, smooth, and earthy, with a little butterscotch and a cereal grain type of sweetness. I get little in the way of harsh burnt or charred notes. Depending on the source one consults, oats either fail to add much flavor while contributing body, or they do add an astringent flavor note ... I certainly get the latter here although the source is difficult to pinpoint. In my mind (and to my palate), this is considered the prototype of the style for a reason. Less sweet than a milk stout but has some of the same desirable mouthfeel characteristics.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Pitch black with creamy tan head, great retention and lacing. Nose was nice and roasty with cocoa and vanilla. Taste followed - delicious cocoa, coffee, and a bit of caramel. I'm sure this would be great over ice cream. Not as heavy as I was expecting. Don't have much experience with oatmeal stouts, but if I tasted this blind I would swear it was a milk stout.

A classic that I should probably have tried ages ago - for some reason I always pass over the Sam Smith brews....  Poured into a tulip pint glass. A dark reddish-brown hue that appears pitch black in the glass. Yields a large head of creamy beige foam with decent retention; this slowly reduces to a thick surface layer. Nice lacing. Aroma of sweet roasted malt with hints of molasses, dried fruit, vanilla, liquorice, mild chocolate, grain, faint coffee and ale yeast. Subtle but complex.  Tastes of subdued roasted malt with a mild, dry finish. Notes of dried fruit, molasses, vanilla, mild chocolate hints, liquorice, grain, faint coffee and fruity ale yeast. Little hop character to speak of. Slightly sweet, followed by a delicate, malty bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with effervescent carbonation and decent body. Could be a shade thicker. A gentle astringency, accompanied by an aftertaste of mild roasted malt, fruity yeast and a touch of chocolate.  A decent brew, though I can't say it blew me away. Looks spot on, while the aroma and flavour possess a blend of dark malt, grain and understated fruity notes. Body is OK yet could stand to be more creamy. Goes down easily enough, however the distinctive roastiness that I'd expect from a stout is lacking - the overall character is too muted. Worth sampling if you come across it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

T: Bitter chocolate and coffee with nutty malt flavors and a quick semi-bitter almost-medicinal finish with very strong oatmeal flavors.  M: Bubbly and smooth with a medium body and a quick dry finish.  O: Very good oatmeal stout. This is a round and almost bare-bones oatmeal stout. It is definitely one of the better ones I have had and IS the style as far as I am concerned. It is neither the best looking beer nor does it have the best feel, but it is a quite delicious and interesting beer both in the nose and the flavors. Lots of soft, yet harsh roasted malt flavors.

I won't say it's a bad beer, but why it gets such high ratings on here, I cannot understand why. It has high carbonation which is ok, but it lacks kick or punch that good oatmeal stouts have. The head was not very dark, so it just seemed weird to have such a dark beer with a light head. Some people might enjoy this beer and I think those that do do not like strong tasting beers.

S- One of the nicer, more prominent smelling stouts that I've encountered. I mostly detect the sweet smelling dark malts. Try as I may, I cannot make out any coffee, as indicated by other reviewers. Nevertheless, this beer is a pleasure to sniff. T- Comparing to other generic stouts, I'd described this taste as being ""toastier"" - in the best way. Other flavors in the mix include vanilla and light chocolate. M- Medium and smooth, leaves a dry aftertaste O- My first oatmeal stout, so I figured I'd start with one of the best.

S: Smells like latte, vanilla cappuccino, roasted barley, and it gives me the scent of a chocolate/coffee cake. You can't ask for a better smelling stout.  T: Caramel, latte, vanilla coffee, some hop kick to the back of the palate, sweetness and some breadiness mid palate, it's is perfectly balanced and the experience of drinking something like this is wonderful.  MF: Heavy MF, creamy, well carbonated to keep you burping and not feel so full.  O: Amazing. Simply stunning. Looks great, smells great, tastes great, it's perfectly balanced with hops and malts and none overpower each other.

Deep, dark brown body, leaning towards black unless held to a light source: on top a large tanned blanket of foam.  Lots going on in the aroma (and taste): dark chocolate bar with fruit and nuts, coffee, liquorice and caramel notes appeared in the nose and mouth.

The taste follows, very roasted malts, sweet also, with big dark chocolate notes, big coffee and some mild caramel. There is also a stronger grainy note. Dark fruit follows, with sweet dark fruit (raisin, dried fig, dates) and some mild acidity (red apple). Big dark spices, like cocoa, cinnamon, with vanilla, but also a faint anise and piney note. Probable because of the hops, with some green herb coming through, and creating a great bitterness, a bit dry in the aftertaste. The beer is creamy, but does have a bit of carbonation, just enough for the alcoholic content to pinch, not just warm up.

The beer is dark black and produces a massive head that surged out of the glass. Once under control, the head formed into a sort of peak well above the lip of the glass and rested there for nearly 5 minutes. Such a splendid sight and really it was impressive to see such persistence in a head before.  As for the smell, the beer is sweet, molasses-like and has roasted malt, coffee and chocolate notes to it.  The taste is again sweeter than I expected, but it's a good sweet, much like a milk stout. Add to this the incredibly smooth and creamy mouthfeel and this beer starts to resemble a dessert. Yet, the booze does show up and, alongside the darker roasted malt notes, rein in this beer before it becomes too much like drinking a milkshake. It's a great balancing act that the beer achieves and on smoothness and creaminess, I don't think I've ever had a beer anything quite like this.

I am not detecting any hop character.  The taste is quite sweet with roasted notes and a little bit of the yeast flavors. There is a nice little bitterness, mainly in the after taste.

Taste: Full-bodied with great balance of malt and hops. There is a hint of sweetness that may be due to the oats, but it has an excellent taste. The combination of strong hops and roasted malts and strong alcohol give this drink powerful flavors.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, but very smooth. Not as creamy or thick as some stouts.

Aromas include chocolate, licorice, and light roasted malt.  The tastes are pretty similar- lots of chocolate with some subtle but tasty licorice flavors. Roasted malt is present but not overpowering. Slightly sour twang at the end of each sip, much like other Sam Smith offerings (Taddy Porter).  Thick creamy mouthfeel, very smooth, very drinkable. Low carbonation.  One of the classic oatmeal stouts, still amazing even today.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Glennam,4.75,"One of my favorite all time beers. Had it on tap in Boston several years ago and never looked back. Undeniably one of the best stouts you will ever drink. Smooth, creamy and so good it can be dangerous. Bottles not quite as good as on tap so if you can find it in a bar do not pass it up!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,archyquaffer,3.83,"Poured from the pint-plus bottle into an ""AC/DC"" Shaker pint. A moderate pour produces about an inch of brown, sticky head. This settles down but continues to coat the top as I sip, quickly covering over any open leads...The beer is a very dark brown that admits very little light.  The aroma is rich, with a promise of sweetness. The flavor is quite complex, with both earthy-bitter and sweet, ripe fruit accents. I detect chocolate, mildly burnt coffee and a bit of caramel, with maybe some mead-like flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but still rather light for an oatmeal stout.  I've been drinking this beer off and on for 25 years or more. Sam Smith's beer is a brand that got me hooked on English-style ales. It can be hard to find in my area, and seems less available now than it was 20 years ago.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,AmishLightning,4.7,"I had this after cellaring for around a month. I really just wanted to wait for a nice occasion to break into it. poured to a widening glass without a meal to go with it.  A-Frothy foamy head jumps up as soon as the beer is poured. After the full pour it has about a four finger head that dissipates to a nice lacing after several minutes. Wonderful black color which the light hardly penetrates and only on the side. Elegant looking beer, strong and independent.  S-lighter aromas hit the nose. Malted barely and tracing of hops appear at first. Undertones of an earthy soil also are present in each sniff. I expected a more pronounced smell, but this was pleasant and went along with how the beer came together as a whole.  T-Mmmmm, this is sweet. The malted and roasted barely add the firm sweetness while the oatmeal pumps up the sugars even more. It is a fantastic rich flavor which is well balanced with the hops that add a bittersweet finish at the end of the drink.  M-This is the highlight of the beer. It was incredible to taste a beer that was so smooth. I didn't even think is possible to make a beverage so easy to drink, so easy to go down. This blew me out of the water. The medium body and light carbonation complimented the overall character of the beer. However, let me say once more that this beer takes the cake as far as going for the ""smooth"" crown.  O-I definitely recommend for all stout drinkers and new drinkers. I love this beer and am sure to have more. Congrats Samuel Smith! you continue to amaze me.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,SerialTicker,3.72,"Appearance: Pours a crystal clear ruby black color with a finger or two of a pretty dark, tan head. Quite a bit of carbonation as well, which I wasn't really expecting.  Smell: A lot of roastiness, with a pretty significant caramel note. There's some coffee, but I'm not really getting any sorts of chocolate aromas. This beer has a very good nose on it.  Taste: For being supposedly the best oatmeal stout in the world, I'm pretty largely let down for a few reasons. I'll assume this is due to my ignorance, but anyway... first of all, the mouthfeel isn't at all what I thought it would be. Rather than a smooth feel, it's pretty light with a surprising amount of prickly carbonation. Second, the flavor is just lacking. It isn't bad, but it sort of tastes like watered down coffee. As it warms up a bit, I also get a minor dark fruit flavor that I find odd, but it does add a bit more depth and intrigue to the beer. I've been under the impression that (of ones I've had) oatmeal stouts have a relatively thick, creamy mouthfeel with fairly mild carbonation, and have a nice, bold flavor. I don't get it with this.  My dad claims that this is the best beer that he's ever had, but I've had better oatmeal stouts that were made right here in Michigan. I know my opinion is an unpopular one, but it is what it is. S.S.O.S. is a drinkable, easy-to-session sort of beer, but it's not how I like my stouts.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Followed by coffee and some mild hops  Taste - Oatmeal up front, followed by alcohol (not too strong but very present), coffee and very mild hops. Creamy milk and Oatmeal again. Wonderful aftertaste of Oatmeal and chocolate  Mouthfeel - Great mouthfeel. Not too creamy, yet not too carbonated. I really cant say anything else but excellent. Just perfect on the palate  Overall - This beer is amazing. I bought it after I seeing it on the shelf and reading the reviews and I was definitely not disappointed. I bought it in a 1 pt, 2.7 fluid oz bottle and wish I had gotten at least 2 of them. Wonderful taste and mouthfeel. I was sad to see the last sip in the glass.

113,571,schnauzeborne,4.63,"This is so far my favorite beer. It has been three weeks since I drank it; so bear with me, I am only here to rave about how good this junk was. If I remember correctly:  The mouthfeel was ecstatic, and one can really taste the oatmeal. Moreso, the aftertaste is like coffee- like, real coffee. Not like Kona Brewery's attempt at ""coffee beer"", but good coffee- and without even trying. If you have ever drank malta or any other high-quality, non-alcoholic malt beverage, you probably know what I'm talking about. This beer is dark, smooth, and just unforgettable. The head has more staying power than Guinness Extra Stout, and the head alone is more flavorful than the body of most beers.

It was truly like Oatmeal in a bottle...with beer. Highly recommend this beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,pjkelley82,4.58,"Wow..  The best oatmeal stout I have personally tasted. I got high regards from people who drank this and from this site.  Poured from the bottle into a Guinness pint glass.  Very dark, almost black, could not see house lighting thru it but when I went outside the dark chestnut color came thru and you could see the bubbles dancing around. Almost like a super dark red at the bottom and got darker towards the head...  Nice 1 finger super thick brown cream colored head. A little lumpy in the beginning but the head stayed thruout me drinking the beer but wittled down to an 8th of an inch. Lumpyness in the head was not a problem for me, it actually attracted me to the beer..  Now, im not the best smeller.... lol... I don't have the best taste and sense... but I can pick out certain things in beers.... usually I'll pick up on 2-4 of the strongest scent/taste of the beer...  Smell was minimal at start a dot of chocolate and oats but I really had to try. As I sat outside...it's 90°.. it warmed a Tad... I could smell chocolate, oats, the mild hops and a great malt smell.  The taste was just fucking perfect.... I'm sorry, but I have to let you know that even tho at first the smell wasn't wazooo.... after tasting it I just stopped what I was doing and marvelled in it. For me it tasted way better cold.... when it warmed up just a little I could taste alot more hops and the bare bones of the beer.... still was excellent a little warmer than frig temperature but I'd say drink it cold cold... lots of chocolate and oats with a nice malt taste to it... chocolate lingers in aftertaste..  Smooth as silk... excellent mouthfeel, nicely balanced, not too heavy or light.... more towards the heavy.  Overall this is the best oatmeal stout I have personally had. It is one of the bbeers that I would recommend to people who like dark malty beers. It's the beer I tell people to drink...

113,571,Samuel906,3.43,"Hmm... Up until now, Samuel Smith's dark beers have been spot on for me across the board. Not to say the Oatmeal isn't good, but it was just very mild and underwhelming compared to their others. Reserved nose, some chocolate and oats. There's a lot of people claiming tons of smokiness in this and I really don't get it. Mild chocolate and toasted oats. I would like to taste more oats to be honest. Body is smooth and silky.

S - Strong malty smell with a roasted, grainy, oatmeal smell.  T - Great flavor having a robust character with a malty, roasty, chocolaty, and some like toffee/caramel taste. There is some faint bitterness from the black malt and hops but is very malt heavy and sweet.  M - Robust mouth-feel with low carbonation. Silky feel and a lingering sweetness that makes it a great winter beer.  Overall, this oatmeal stout is the gold standard in this style. It isn't as heavy as a RIS but it is a tasty brew. It has everything for the dark beer drinker. It's also a nice change of pace if you are used to drinking dry stouts like Guinness. I would strongly recommend this to anyone that likes darker beer.

Perhaps it's my affinity for stouts but I can never get enough of this beer. It's a constant struggle each trip to the store not to go back to this and force myself to try something new on the shelf.

S - Very smooth chocolate smell that also provides some vanilla and caramel to the nose.  T - Milk chocolate hits initially and then is backed up by the malt that gives way to a mild coffee bitterness but then reverts back to the initial sweetness. Very complex and delicious!  M - Nice and creamy, but maybe not as creamy as I like in an oatmeal stout. I may just be nitpicking here, but it seemed maybe a bit over-carbonated.  O - This is quite easily the best easy to find oatmeal stout out there, and my favorite offering from Samuel Smith!

Lacing does make an effort to hang on with everything its got.  S- Roasted aroma. Not huge, but very appetizing. Malted barley and oats. Hop notes on the back end, but still lets the malt control the aroma. Smells like an English breakfast.  T- Just like the label says- smooth malt up front with a delightful bitter-sweet finish. Very delightful. Not overly complex, but the flavors are robust- oats, toffee, chocolate, wood, vanilla. Flows well together. Woodsy hops finishes it off until the next sip. Just a big time effort here.  M- Thought it looked a little thin in the poor, but deceivingly viscous. Creamy full body. Smooth upfront with delightful attenuation in the finish.  O- My fav from this brewery. So well done. Found this in my sis-in-law's fridge and I couldn't be any more happy to take it off her hands since she had never heard of Samuel Smith.

Good amount of molasses. Slight roasted coffee to balance the sweetness. A tad grainy. Overall very nice. I really like it  Taste: The oats do their job here. Very sweet but nowhere near cloying. Very smooth, well-rounded flavor. Big chocolate - more sweet than bitter - with creamy bittering coffee. Never gets more of one than the other. Very consistent. slight earthy hop finish. Bittersweet chocolate coats the pallate for a pleasant aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, big flavor but very fefreshing. Not drying as some oatmeal stouts can be. Not that the abv is high but I was honestly expeccting lower than 5% with how smooth it is. A tad watery which isn't necessarily bad just a little offputting for a stout  Overall: Probably one of the smoothest stouts I've had. Very well balanced. Really nice flavor. Would recommend.

It is like a sweet piece of velvety chocolate cake with coffee icing resurrected as a beer.

The foam takes a bit to settles, leaving a nice rocky layer across the top of the beer and on the edges of the glass. There is a decent amount of lacing as it drinks.  S: The nose is chocolate, soaked bread, and bit of caramel, and a touch of vanilla. It's smells alright. The bready nature of this beer is the dominate scent. The rest are just underlying players in the game.  T: It starts out sweet with bread notes and chocolate in the mix. I get that caramel and vanilla in the middle. As it moves the back end it gets sweeter, but it's still very bready.  M: Medium bodied beer. It's sweet and silky. It's a bit thin, but spot on for an oatmeal stout. The flavors coat the palate and slide off nicely. Nothing lingering for too long after the beer is gone.  O: This is an alright beer. It's not exactly my favorite style, but it's ok.

The tiniest bit of light comes through so you can see it's not just an opaque syrup.  Very nice aroma. Caramel, roasted malt, dark fruits, bittersweet chocolate. Smells slightly Belgian.  Roasty caramel/chocolate sweetness up front, followed by a nice hop bittering, with a slightly long grainy/doughy finish with a hint of oats. I keep going back for the finish, it's my favorite part.  Mouthfeel is rich and creamy without being thick. Carbonation is perfect. So sessionable. Goes down so smooth it's almost scary.  I've tended to avoid Samuel Smith's for a long time due to a number of bad experiences with lightstruck beers from the clear glass bottles.

Poured into a Stone Brewing pint glass. This beer is dark with a thick frothy head that dissipates slowly and clings to the side. It smells great, like most stouts but I am not detecting any oatmeal in the scent... maybe my nose isn't that fine tuned.  It is heavy stuff, but goes down very smooth, and I think I tasted the oatmeal underneath all of the coffee, chocolate and other sweets in this brew. Finished the whole bottle in thirty minutes and thoroughly enjoyed it. This is definitely my go-to stout from now on... it blows Guinness out of the water.

113,571,JerzDevl2000,4.2,"Picked this up last week at Top Hops, having never had this classic before. Even though I couldn't taste the oatmeal in this, this was a great beer and a much more easygoing Stout than I was accustomed to. The flavors and mouthfeel almost made me think that this was a Belgian-style beer but alas, there was just enough of a roasted taste and texture to remind me that this indeed, was an Oatmeal Stout.  The pour to this was a dark brown with just a hint of garnet around the edges. Not a lot of head to this and even less lacing, but that probably had to do with the carbonation. Although it was present, it wasn't overpowering and the mouthfeel of this beer almost felt like a relatively light soda. There was some oat to be felt, but it was overpowered by roasted malt, bitter chocolate, licorice, vanilla extract, and dark fruits including currant, plum, and cherry. There even seemed to be a hint of yeast in here, helping this feel like a Belgian rather than a British beer. Because the bubbles weren't that present, only a bit of scrubbing could be felt after every sip and the dark fruits faded into an espresso-like bitterness in the aftertaste.  Not many Stouts can be considered session beers but this fit that bill. Although I only bought one bottle, I could have had another during my sitting since this went down pretty easily and smoothly. I expected this to be a bit more filling and strong but even though it wasn't, I enjoyed it a lot and can see why it's rated so highly. There's a lot to like here and something in it to appeal to everyone. Nearly every aspect of this beer lends to it's status as a classic.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with some light fruitiness. Taste of caramel, molasses, cocoa, oatmeal, toast, roasted malt, dark bread, floral, and roasted earthiness. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, oatmeal, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, dark bread, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit.

Nutty, toasted malt, oats, light roast character, and dark fruits form the initial aroma. Dark fruit becomes more prominent as it warms, along with light caramel sweetness and subtle floral hop character.  Chocolate dominates the flavor profile throughout the initial sip, with roast malt accompanying it in the slightly dry finish. Becomes roast dominant in subsequent tastings. Underpinnings of bruised cherries and dark berries add complexity. There's a nutty tone in the aftertaste. Tobacco emerges as it warms.  Body is fairly full, chewy, and smooth, with carbonation on the low side.  More dark fruit than expected. Chocolate is a lot more evident in flavor than in the nose. Today character is not overpowering. Very solid beer. Would've rather the fruitiness not be present.

The mineral flavors from the English hard water are there, too, but it just adds to the character. Quick hit of hops at the end, but the roasted and smokey flavors take over in the finish.

Earthy flavors finish with slight roasted bitterness and a slight acidity.  M: Smooth as silk and not at all heavy in the mouth. Low carbonation.  O: One killer stout.

Barely able to discern any prominent notes of anything so rather than guess, I will simply say the bouquet is basically nonexistent.  T: Definitely the strong suit. Impressively complex with a highly complimentary blend of mocha, chocolate and oats. The finish is mild, sweet and extremely pleasant.  M: Superb feel. The oats are deliciously chewy and the carbonation is spot on.  O: What this beer lacks in head retention and aroma it makes up for with superior taste and mouthfeel.

Still looking at a solid two and a half inches on top of an inky cola black. Makes me want to slam it back.  Oaty and roasty. Rich, dry, and malty. Picking up nuances of ground coffee, molasses, and cocoa powder. Massive roast offers up some great char aroma, without the smoke. Not so high in intensity, because there's a slight creamy nose that marries all of the stout-y notes in with each other.  Clean and creamy smooth. The roast is very dark, but never biting. No astringencies to note. Subtle hints of cocoa, coffee, moist devil's food cake, and dark honey. More of that molasses in the maltiness. Brittle toffee and burnt sugars comprise the rest. Lightly spicy sizzle, accented by the carbonation, gives evidence to some Noble hopping. The oats do contribute to the bitterness, which is still pretty low. The mouthfeel is amazing, however. Creamy and mouthfilling. Elegant and welcoming. This beer is going 'gone' and pretty damn fast, too.  A celebratedly awesome English stout. The claim-to-fame for versions using a lot of oatmeal. The revivalist. The one, the only; Samuel Smith.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,CASK1,4.67,"Bottle poured to a tulip glass on St. Patrick's Day.  A - Beautiful beer! Nearly black with ruby highlights. Thick light tan head that stays to the bottom of the glass.  S - Rich and complex. Dark roast malt, bittersweet chocolate, hints of coffee. Light grainy undertones. Low earthy hops, but the roast malt is the star.  T - Similar to aroma. Rich, dark roasty malt. Prominent chocolate, burnt toast. Oats come through as a light grainy complement to the roast malt. Moderate hop bitterness balances the malt perfectly.  M - Medium to medium-full body but remaining highly quaffable. Medium carbonation helps balance the malt richness.  O - Really sorry I waited so long to try this one! One of the best stouts I've had. This is sure to become a regular beer for me.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Ilafan,4.71,"As anyone can tell by my high rating numbers for this beer, I really am a fan of Smith's Oatmeal Stout. The number one seller for me is the richness of its taste. I really enjoy its full mouthful, and that coupled with a caramel, chocolate, and coffee-like flavor, makes me happy when I pour a glass of this into my favorite mug. The head is full, and the latticework is enticing. Darn good beer!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

S: Tons of molasses, dark chocolate mixed with a dark fruit aroma that's a mix of fig and raisin, cola, earth, chocolate covered banana and rich dark bread.  T: A rich, roasted grain and bread flavor throughout, faint roasted malt, cola, chocolate malt and some molasses. Just a hint of dark fruit as well. The mouthfeel is velvety as hell and makes this feel way bigger than it is. A fantastic stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,ChugMan,4.3,"Food Pairing - Fresh banana turned out to be a bad choice, just amped up the bitterness and muted nearly everything else. Don't do it!  A - Dark but not quite opaque brown. Large pillowy head with excellent lacing S - Soft, sweet, bready, inviting T - Smooth and not nearly as complex as many American contemporary stouts, but what it does it does right. Some fig, faint chocolate and molasses. The aftertaste of oats is especially soft and pleasant. M - Refreshing, but a bit on the thin side for my taste. A little soapy but not bad. Fairly creamy finish. O - Very drinkable and a good choice for beginners. Years ago, this beer was my introduction to beer made by people who care, and I'm glad to see that it holds to this day.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,SmashPants,4.26,"Bottle: very solid 550mL embossed brown bottle. An old-school medicinal-style label - a quirky and, to be honest, awesome package.  Appearance: deep jet black with hints of ruby-brown highlights against the light. A perfect one-and-a-half finger tan head sits on top. Good retention and fantastically heavy lacing top the appearance off.  Aroma: one of my least favoured aspects of any stout. Always very demure, and this one is no different. Has a good combination of malts, however, no matter how light. Coffee, chocolate, caramels and some light spices to back up. Quite nice.  Taste: good quality malts again, a bit sweeter than the nose. It still has a bite, but has a creamy smoothness as well.  Aftertaste: lingers for a good long while, but a touch of bitterness hanging on. Also some of those heavier malts at the back of the mouth, which is a rare thing.  Mouth feel: the mouth feel is spot on. Medium-to-heavy, thick and creamy body. A low carbonation helps it glide down, and the creamy head offers just enough bitterness. Perfect.  Overall: sure, it's expensive, but it's a bloody good beer. You get what you pay for in this instance. It'd be nice if Australians didn't get quite so bent over when it came to beer, imported beer and, really, commodities in general, but hey. This one is worth the extra.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Modest to light carbonation and mouthfeel. Flavors of light chocolate, minerals, dark roasted malts...rust. OK...I've had this brew for perhaps 30 years...always a modest body and flavorful beer.

Once long ago, subjected to a sheltered life of Guinness stouts, oblivious of what the real world had to offer, I now know the true meaning of beer excellence and the cost it takes to be enlightened yet again and again. The questions in my mind spinning around like a hamster wheel on steroids.

Yes!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

We have a very brown black beer with a nice light contrasting creamy head with good sustenance and lacing.  i gave high marks on the aroma. I get a strong malt roast and chocolate note coming up.  This is a simple yet satisfying brew. What I love here is the classic oatmeal stout with a strong malty roast flavor and a chocolate. The flavor is strong and well-balanced.  The carbonation is mild. The beer is more creamy than thicker. This is a smooth drink but filling.  I think this stout goes with some London avant-garde very well. I suggest Derek Bailey's duo cd cd with Evan Parker.

It has a slightly fruity smell, that is low on malt and hop profiles, but has a nice oatmeal scent. There is a hint of coffee and bitter chocolate as well.  The taste follows more into the coffee and chocolate, bitter at first, sweet like butterscotch, and than bitter from the oatmeal at the end. The finish is dry and chalky, but in the best sense of the word. It is hardy and satisfying, with no watery feeling to it at all.

I get intensely sweet caramel, honey and a splash of espresso on the nose. But the flavor is watery on the start and the finish. The little hops character which is there is well balanced against the unique sweetness the oats add. So I do get why it is a widely enjoyed stout, but I prefer something more flavorful.

113,571,RalphSMouse,3.96,"Appearance: Poured into a beer mug, this stout’s head is thick, foamy, and of an inviting, sandy beige color. The body is dark brown, bordering on black. This is a beautiful beer.  Smell: The smell is metallic, but not unpleasant; reminiscent of petrichor (I imagine this is due to the hard water used to brew this beer). There are hints of caramel and roasty malts. There is also a slightly sour “sting” that I am not too pleased with, but overall, the brew smells fine.  Taste: Begins with a slight saltiness that slowly transitions into pleasantly bitter coffee and slightly sweet caramel. Alas--strangely, there is a prominent ""mushroom""-like note. I don’t like that very much, but it isn’t a big enough deal to ruin the beer as a whole for me.  Mouthfeel: Rich, silky, and effervescent.  Overall: This is a solid stout. I find that the “mushroom” taste takes away from the enjoyability of the coffee/malt combination, and for me, this is the beer’s weak point. Aside from that, there is nothing much to complain about.

As far as looks go, this is just about perfect for a stout. Less of a treat for the nose than the eye. Malty and earthy, a bit of cocoa. The aroma is altogether somewhat weak and pedestrian.  Malty and dry in flavor, finishing with a hoppy bitterness. The silky smooth mouthfeel expected of an oatmeal stout is there. Chewy enough for a stout in the 5% range.

113,571,Uncle_Jimmy,3.74,"POured from a bottle into a glass.  Aroma- Light Coffee and smokiness. faint cocoa and a slight yeasty sourness.  Appearance- Nearly opaque, a slight ruby tint is revealed when help up to the light. a thin tan head that lingers but provides little if any lacing.  Flavor- Cocoa and oats with a slight smokiness that gives way to a sweet almost coffee finish. As it warms you can perceive an earthy-ness as well (a'la unwashed potato'.  Mouthfeel- There is an ever present slickness/viscosity from the oats (I would assume). It has a slight astringency, which I hear could come from the fermentation process in the open vats. both of these characteristics add to the beer as opposed to detract from it. It is slightly over carbed for a stout, but I should have let it rest a little more.

I've had bottles that have picked up the scent better, this was from a gift set so it could be a bit older. Taste is fine though. Rating is for serving, but let it be noted that I've had a better smell pickup.  Taste: This is almost perfect. Roast malts, oats and ever such a touch of hops. Generally sweet, but will leave a nice bitter-sweet taste on the mouth. Excellent.  Mouthfeel: An easy drinking creamy stout with a nice steady but not overbearing level of carbonation.

113,571,magictacosinus,4.53,"About time I review this thing. It's one of the most delightful takes I've ever had on the style, and end up woofing it down before I have a chance to review it. Poured out of a 550ml bottle into the brewery's trademark pub pint glass.  Pours a deep, darkened color with reddish tones when placed against any light. Like all of Sam Smith's beers, this one has an enormous head due to the prevalence of the fresh yeast. Carbonation never seems to die down on this thing, and there was always a half-finger of foam at the top the whole time. Looks robust, thick, and inviting overall.  The aroma consists of an immediate overpowering aroma of freshly baked oatmeal, but there are also strong nutty flavors, some chocolate goodness, and yeasty phenols resembling dark fruits such as figs. What strikes me is simply how FRESH all of this smells, and indeed, the darkened malty aromas combined with the yeastiness, as well as the oats, remind me very much of freshly baked, hearty bread of sorts. There's a little bit of hoppiness going on, but not nearly as predominant as the yeast and oat richness this offers.  The flavor continues where the aroma was left off, but further accentuates and develops the flavor to greater heights. The oats are massive here at every sip, often mixing with the strong malty backbone and sticky yeast to resemble a true meal-like experience. Even after each gulp, the yeasty notes and oats remain on the tongue in a thoroughly satisfying way, and the alcohol produces a warming effect of pure bliss and comfort. Beyond the flavors, the beer is also extremely easy to drink, and provides a thickened experience as hearty and full-bodied as its flavor. The carbonation isn't too excessive, but not once does this beer let down and thin itself out, no matter how affected by room temperature.  By far one of my favorite to-go oatmeal stouts, or hell, favorite to-go stouts ever! I've had this tons of times by now, and whether or not it may not be the most accurate take on the style, it's still extremely yummy and true meal in its own right. I could have something like this for breakfast if I wanted and not feel guilty about it.

Cocoa brown and creamy, really long lasting. The body is dark brown and opaque until held right up to the light, and then appears rich burgundy.  S - Very malty and roasted grain. Maybe just a trace of sweet alcohol.  T - The malt is most present, some smokiness and a touch of the oatmeal at the finish. To be totally honest its bland for me, in comparison to all of the other Oatmeal Stouts I've tried this year (and that is nearing a dozen as of this writing).  M - Nice and creamy when quaffed right away, as it appears. It is a little bitter and it finishes very clear, pretty nicely done.  O - Theres nothing wrong with it but I am not wowed.

S - Roasted barley and molasses, slight coffee notes. sweet and malty nose overpowers the hops but they are present, I would say grassy piney trying to get through.  T - taste is pretty balanced for the style. Semi sweet with Roasted Malts and slight caramel, adequate hop bitterness to balance the sweet malt and finishes well. Lingering nut character. Slight metallic off taste.  M - mouthfeel is a little thin for an oatmeal stout, the low carb is great though and it is certainly creamy.

T - Definitely a strong chocolate coffee presence, pretty thick & heavy, which isn't my favorite feeling; this beer sits kind of heavy in the stomach. Slight hint of raisins and dark fruit as the beer warms up a bit.  M - Bitter, buttery, sticky mouthfeel, probably my favorite part of this beer.  Overall, not my favorite, but by no means is it a bad beer. I was reminded a lot of the Founders Porter, which is also not a favorite of mine.

113,571,axeman9182,4.35,"oz bottle. Allowed to warm a little before being poured into my Duvel tulip.  Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout pours jet black, with a billowing three plus fingers of mocha foam crowning the beer and filling the glass. Head retention is just alright, and lacing, while left in a solid ring near the top of the glass, is fairly spotty underneath. The nose is highlighted by a soft coffee aroma, met by a light touch of fruity esters. The flavor adds a mild chocolate flavor, which plays well against the subtle, coffee with cream roast. Those classic English esters help close things out. The body is wonderful, subtly full and featuring that great silky character that one finds in a well executed oatmeal stout. The carbonation is on the low end of the spectrum, just as it should be.

113,571,Jugs_McGhee,3.68,"Acquired at Trader Joe's as part of their 3 beer/1 glass for $9.99 pack. 550 ml brown glass bottle with foiled-over pressure cap served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are through the roof given its current ratings and reputation as the best oatmeal stout in existence.  Served nearly straight from the refrigerator and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a two finger light tan colour head of good cream and thickness, and good retention. Body colour is a solid nontransparent opaque black. Not quite jet black, but it's very dark. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Looks as it should for the style.  Sm: Roasted barley, chocolate malt, dark malts, and caramel. The roast is particularly attractive. Very evocative and inviting. I don't detect alcohol or yeast. I'm looking forward to this one.  T: Roasted barley, chocolate malt, dark malts, fired kiln malt, caramel, chocolate, milk, and cream. Some cream. A balanced, enjoyable flavour all around. Well layered. No yeast or alcohol comes through. Any hopping is floral and backgrounded at best. Tasty. Oats come through as it warms; I didn't detect any in my initial pass. Some cola notes throughout, even some herbal character as it warms. Oddly enough, I get some pear fruit. Some earthiness at the base, but subtly executed. Some vanilla/creme brulee hits in the late second act - a highlight of the beer, but one that directly challenges style conventions; it's ballsy, but I like it.  Mf: The coarseness of the roast duels with the rolling smoothness of the oats; the only winner is the consumer. Ideal thickness and carbonation. Wet enough to keep it drinkable but dry enough to satisfy the needs of the style and to complement the flavours. Above all, it's balanced and tailored with/to the flavour profile. A bit heavy on the palate for the modest ABV, but it suits the flavour. It could use more cream.  Dr: Quite drinkable considering its heavy bold flavours and assertive mouthfeel. I rather fancy it. A solid oatmeal stout, and one I'd love to try on nitro/draught. Tasty and enjoyable. A satisfying brew from Samuel Smith's. Is it their best beer? Possibly. I look forward to finding out.  I'd like to try this side by side with the Stockyard Oatmeal Stout also available at Trader Joe's. I worry that I'm rating this a bit high based on outside influences, but it's so yummy.

113,571,Darkmagus82,4.23,"Poured from bottle into pint glass  Appearance – Pours a deep brown color with a big and thick tan colored head. The head has a nice level of retention, fading over ~ 5 min to give a decent level of lacing.  Smell- The aroma is big of oats and chocolate. Mixed with these are some sweeter caramel and a light vanilla aroma. A light roasted malt and coffee aroma round out the remainder of the nose creating a sweet and roasty smell overall.  Taste – The taste starts out with a smooth but dry oatmeal and roasty malt taste. A bitter chocolate flavor, that comes quickly after the initial taste, begins to get sweetened as the taste advances further. Flavors of caramel and some vanilla sweeten the brew quite a bit. The brew remains relatively sweet to the end where a light earthy hop joins the flavor. In the end a pleasant sweet oaty and lightly hopped chocolate flavor are left on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the creamier side for an only 5 % abv with a carbonation level that is just below average. Very nice for the stout style and letting all those great dark and malty flavors to be truly sensed by the tongue.  Overall – A delicious stout that isn’t overwhelming with alcohol.

Moderately to undercarbonated, which contributed to the initial sweetness. 4/5 O: Just a great beer, with many classic stout flavors blended well, but overly thick or overly sweet. Just the look of the poured beer is frankly my favorite look in a beer, what gets me the most excited visually: that dark bottom and nice strong stiff head.

Of course one finds a big malty brew but like in the nose molasses and anise are big players almost too big. I detect very faint hints of smoked peat.

While these aromas come through distinctly, they are not overly bold. There are also notes of roasted malt and ripe cherry. Mouthfeel is smooth, and not too viscous. The mild hop on the finish accentuates the light carbonation scrubbing. Flavors come through almost as distinctly as the aromas. However, everything is mild.

A vein of dark licorice coincides with a quick punch of cocoa toward the end. Weighs unexpectedly light to medium, and one could argue there's a wateriness, although the argument would be short lived as inconsequential.

Appearance: Very dark brown and pretty much opaque. Tan soapy head.  Aroma: Usual oatmeal stout malt forward nose. Molasses and slightly roasted malt.  Taste: Wow, this one has some character to it given it's low 5% ABV. You taste roasted caramel and just a hint of chocolate. Interesting how much flavor you get from a pretty one dimensional beer. There is one off-flavor though, a metallic taste in the finish. Not sure what caused that. If it wasn't for the off-taste, then this would be really great.  Mouthfeel: The oatmeal makes itself known here. Super smooth and just above medium bodied. Above average drinkability. Just a tad over carbonated.  Final Thoughts: The first sip was great, but after that the metallic after-taste starting to become more apparent. That's too bad because this was a very promising beer. Would I drink it again?

113,571,beergoot,4.25,"Dark brown, nearly black body with an exceptionally smooth, creamy light tan head. Slightly nutty smell with a strong roasted malt, brown sugar, and molasses component. Smooth, medium-full body. Excellent light, bittersweet chocolate taste; good bitterness throughout.  Overall an exceptional beer. Very well balanced, nuanced, and complex. The relatively mild ABV is a big plus here, meaning knocking back several beers at a sitting is quite doable. A true classic.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,KarlosT,4.47,"Had this beer in the basement. Don't remember having bought it. Perhaps it had a high BA score at the store.  Poured myself a glass (tulip). And I spurted out ""Wow"" as my wife was talking to me. Had to apologize ... was referring to the beer, and was not necessarily agreeing with her topic (which I now forget). But she forgave me when she tried this beer as well. Excellent!!  Appearance: nice strong stout w/ some viscosity. The way a stout should be  Smell: very refined caramel, chocolate, and coffee notes,  Taste: very smooth and refined. Blends the complex notes of a stout together quite harmoniously.  MF: perfect. very nice after taste.  Highly recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,JamesHenjum,3.08,"A: This beer poured nearly black with a nice creamy head with big bubbles and good lacing.  S: The beer Has a strong roasted malt smell with a drop of alcohol.  T: I was expecting a creamier malted beer. This beer is creamy and malty, but there is a decent roasted bitterness too. Overall ok tasting, but I wanted more cream and less bitter.  M: Not a big aftertaste. Went down smooth. Was reasonably creamy. Think this beer might be better off with nitrogen than being carbonated.  O: This beer was good. Not quite for me though. Cost a lot for a beer too. Oatmeal stouts are meant to be creamy and I don't get that. If they would have just called it a stout then I might have liked it more. Good beer overall.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,DaftCaskBC,4.3,"A: Black/cola coloured liquid with tan head that dissipated quickly but left a nice lacing.  S: Roasted malt, chocolate and coffee.  T: Roasted malt, oats, quite grainy, with yeast and some grassy and citrusy hops in the finish.  M: Medium to thick viscosity and a medium level of carbonation.  O: The grandaddy of all oatmeal stouts, it makes sense why this one is more dry than sweet. Even though I prefer sweet to dry, I have to give this beer props for history's sake.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,smalenberg,4.38,"Surprised how long it took me to get around to trying this based on its reputation.  Appearance - dark and beautiful with smooth thin head.  Smell - surprised in the amount of bourbon-like alcohol in the nose, which is stronger than the malt. It isn't particularly alcoholic in taste though.  Taste - everything comes together amazingly well. The alcohol evident in the nose isn't as noticeable in the taste. The carbonation that seems a bit too much in mouthfeel is right with the blending of flavors. The bitterness from the hops comes in to balance the malt very well.  Mouthfeel - a little more carbonation than I expected or look for in this style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Mojo,4.34,"This a world class offering. It pours a nearly opaque onyx color with a beautiful one finger caramel colored head. Retention is good and the lacing is elaborate. The smell is pine, soy sauce, and just a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is just perfect. I really don't know any other way to describe it.The taste is sweet with a gentle finish that is hops, chocolate, coffee, and toffee. I know this is a well regarded beer, and its reputation is well deserved.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,RussBecker1,4.55,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A-Pours a thick inky black with an ever so slight lacing of deep chocolatey brown. The beer is a beauty to behold as its personality is abundant. It cries for any sort of frothy head however that would have been the cherry on top, but the most it could conjure up was about a quarter finger that faded immediately.  S-Deep roasted malts shine through, smelling far more like a porter than a stout, but the harshness of the malts are cut nicely by the sweetness oatmeal and every so often a whiff of coffee.  M-Lovely feel. Much smoother than I would have anticipated. Not as thick as it appears which makes each and every flavor of this brew stick to the mouth and ride straight through to the next sip.  T- This is a GREAT stout. As described by the nose, the smoked malts are the first flavor to greet the drinker, and they are huge. The initial taste does hint more towards a porter than a classic stout, but before too long the undertones of the beer swoop in and cut the sharp malts evening them out to perfection. Finally the flavors melt into a perfectly subtle sweetness that leaves the most incredible aftertaste in ones mouth. Truly fantastic balance and taste.  O-One of the very best stouts I have had, this was fantastic.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,mscudder,4.33,"Finally getting around to reviewing this fine brew. Poured into a pint.  A - A deep, milky brown hue with a big finger tan head. Nice retention and frothy consistency.  S - Oatmeal mixed with the dark malts, complimenting a touch of espresso.  T - Flavors of warm molasses and coffee blended with chocolate, absolutely excellent. Some oatmeal becomes noticeable when the beer begins to warm. A pleasure to enjoy.  M - A lighter-medium body with a bit too much carbonation if I may say so. However, it is rich and smooth, bringing high drinkability.  O - I really can say this is one of my favorite brews from this historic brewery. Perhaps the porter outranks it, but that should not take away from how great this beer is.

113,571,TheRealBigC,3.93,"Surprisingly enough, I prefer this one to their Imperial Stout. This one is a much better version of the style they went for. I found the Imperial to be much less strong in flavor than it should have been, but this one was appropriately sweet and smooth. Nice creamy mouthfeel too. Still not my favorite oatmeal stout (that distinction goes to Velvet Merlin), but it's still a good beer.  I do wonder, though, if Samuel Smith's reviews are higher because of their classic status. Not sure if they compete with the great modern beers, even if they were great for their time.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

The smell was of dark fruits, yeast, malts. The taste was very creamy, dark chocolate, malts, dark fruits. Very yummy. The mouthfeel was moderate to thick. Overall a great beer.

113,571,PorterLambic,3.82,"Pours a deep, dark brown with red hanging around the edges. A two-fingered, fluffy medium tan head develops from the pour into a slightly tilted pint glass. Head dissipates to less than a single finger width in under 60 seconds but leaves some decent lace behind. Head is but a thick film after a few more minutes. Smell is malty with notes of peat, cardboard, sourness, smoke and coffee with a whiff of white grape. Decently balanced and complexity as expected of such a highly rated beer, though the grape and sour notes are unexpected. Taste is malt, dark chocolate, coffee, smoke and maybe some caramel(?) with a medicinal note in the aftertaste. Well balanced. Less body than I anticipated, not really much more than medium, effervescence is appropriate, just under middle-of-the-road with a sharpness on the tip of the tongue. A beer you could easily drink several of over the evening due to the low ABV but I just don't get the appeal of this brew. I'm sure its better on tap (what isn't) but this is just not grabbing me. Though it is better than standard Guinness, it's less than Guinness Foreign Extra and many others.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Since our craft program is just now getting underway, and I had been talking up sweet stouts to many of my regular customers, I was able to convince the boss to let me go ahead and tag and sell the Samuel Smith.  I think we are more inclined to keep this beer now as well, due to speed at which went through it and both mine and the boss's findings of it.

It's also very earthy. I don't really taste the oatmeal. Coffee and molasses throughout, with a bittersweet finish.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with a creamy texture. Pretty light on the carbonation.

For a dark beer this is a treasure to the taste buds, not too bitter, not too sweet.

Some grassy hops, chocolatey malts, grain, and the usual vinous qualities from the hard English water.  T: Mmmm. Silky smooth. Delicious chocolate and lightly roasted coffee. Really subtle. I get some grape from the hard water.  M: Drinkability is very high for a stout. Low bitterness and virtually no astringency. Body is light to medium, texture is smooth and dry, carbonation is lively and the finish is somewhat metallic and a touch chalky. Exactly what I want from an English stout.

Almost opaque but in right light see that this is very clear.  Aroma: Coffee and milk sweet- almost cookie like. A hint of diacetyl in first wiff - appropriate for style. Also some caramel. No hops or roastiness detected. Some light fruity esters.  Flavor: Oatmeal sweetness and milky coffee flavor. Very light roastiness upon swallowing. A very slight taste of butter from the diacetyl which is appropriate for the style. No hop flavor but a low hop bitterness to counteract the sweetness although balance still towards sweet side. Roast malt provides some dryness with the sweet resulting in a sweet but not cloying finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full body with smooth, creamy texture. Carbonation medium with very slight bright tingle left on the tongue. Finishes sweet with residual oily coating on tongue- appropriate for style.  Overall: A very drinkable and flavorful beer.

A: Hazy deep dark brown, just barely translucent, with a big rich light-brown head on top that dissipated slowly. These irish tulips always do such a nice job with presenting a dark stout with good head retention.  S: Roasty notes, chocolate, maybe just a hint of something *cherry* back there? Perhaps my nose is deceiving me...  T: Nope. There's something *funky* and sour on this, not sure if it's intentional or not, but I'm really digging it. It pairs nicely with the chocolate presence. Roasted malt is always present, but never *loud*. There's even a *creaminess* characteristic that I think might be brought on by tthe Oatmeal, but oatmeal done in an understated manner (unlike Southern Tier Oat, for example).  M: Light and creamy, carbonation is low but appropriate given the other characteristics of the beer. I think a highly carbonated beer would be distracting. The finish is rather wet and semi-sweet.

Look: Was a very dark brew with deep red highlights around the edges. A 1-finger of sticky tan foam made up the head.  Smell: Rich dark fruits, semi-sweet dark chocolate notes, a hint of toffee or some caramelized brown sugar. Aroma was similar to the Sam Smith's Imperial Stout.  Taste: First off was the caramelized brown sugar. Then hit a wave of toasted malts. The backend was a nice semisweet chocolate with some creamy espresso notes leading into the finish. A subtle bitterness appeared in the aftertaste.  Overall this was a fantastic Oatmeal Stout. This was also my first experience with the style, so I really don’t have a good frame of reference.

Thick, creamy, inviting head that subsides fairly quickly, but laces well.  S: Oatmeal smell is strong up front. Malty-ness is very apparent. Smells a bit like my mom's no bake cookies (oatmeal and cocoa).  T: Tastes sweeter than anticipated based on the smell. Pleasant surprise. Tastes fruit without tasting fruity. Cocoa and oatmeal are subtle. After-taste is divine. Flavor lingers like a good piece of chocolate. The finish of this beer bumped the taste to a 5. The aftertaste is the best part of this beer.  M: More carbonated than anticipated. Another pleasant surprise. Dances in your mouth, and stings a bit going down. The sting is mellowed by the malts. Not the mouthful many stouts are.  O: As a whole, an absolutely outstanding oatmeal stout. Unlike any other than I've ever had.

S: Mostly a mixture of molasses, dark chocolate and coffee. There is some malt grain in there as well.  T: This is where the beer falls off in my opinion. Certainly not a popular opinion, but I think this beer just crosses the cloying threshold. The flavors are more like a molasses, sweet chocolate milkshake rather than the roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, rich malt that I'm more of a fan of. That's not saying there's not a place for this beer on my table but it's just not my favorite.  M: Love the mouthfeel... rich and creamy with a delicate lightness. The mouth totally embodies the flavor profile which I love.  O: Not a bad beer by any means, just not the oatmeal stout I would reach for. I would however, like this for dessert.

A lot more fruity esters than I was expecting. A bit metallic in the finish, with some lingering sweetness.  M: Soft, a little light.  O: Definitely up there for sweet oatmeal stouts.

Pouring it the beer looks brown but in the glass it’s more black than anything. The lightbulb looked ruby through the beer. Nice lace and head retention.  Roasted malts and some sweetness on the nose.  Roasty malts, slight coffee and chocolate, earthy and hoppy. Some sort of sour/metallic thing going on. Idunno. Otherwise it would be much better.

T: Surprisingly mild compared to a Guinness, or Samuel Smith’s Imperial Stout. Slightly sour taste. Full body mouth feel.  M: Fair carbonation which makes it smooth.

A little smokiness. Hearty and inviting, though a tad sweet.  Equal parts dark chocolately sweet and smokey roasty malts. I was actually surprised at how smokey it was, but that part made it that much better. Not super complex, but what it has is super well balanced and authentic tasting. Three parts of perfection, love it.  Pretty heavy, moderate carbonation, everything I've come to expect and enjoy in a hearty stout. Oh, and it's SUPER smooth and creamy.

113,571,BrownNut,4.04,"I've always loved Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout and Oatmeal Stout and decided to do a side-by-side taste test. Here it is.  Oatmeal  A - black, deep ruby next to a lightbulb, the famous Samuel Smith's thick, tan, textured head  S - steely caramel, wet grain, malt, faint mulled winey note  T - mild mocha, brown sugar, hint of a tart-metal-caramel triangle, pastry note  M - silky, buttery ends slightly dry  O - A solid oatmeal stout, very well balanced, delicious and palatable, perfect for drawing newbies into the stout fold. Its American cousins take the ball from there and elevate the robustness and complexity, but this is still a nice one to drink. I'm a little sad that it doesn't deliver as well now that I've expanded my stout palate, but I'll keep my nostalgic soft spot for it.  Imperial  A - black, deep ruby next to a lightbulb, thick off-white head, though not as thick or as textured as the Oatmeal Stout.  S - steely caramel, mocha, malt, mild coffee, almost a mulled winey/port note - more pronounced than in the oatmeal stout. Towards the end something plum-like came out, and finally something apple-y.  T - malt, cocoa and dark chocolate, hint of tart  M - smooth but less silky than the oatmeal stout and finishes slightly dry and slightly tart  O - I really like the Oatmeal Stout and this one cranks up the robustness a notch or two in my opinion.

While hard to tell it's clear, without any haze.  S: Deep malt and molasses with a distinctive scent of over ripe bananas. With a few swirls waffes of liquorice come along with sweetened coffee.  T: High notes of molasses with acrid coffee and deeply caramelized sugar, along with sweet dark toffee. Like an oaked wine it's smooth and velvety, chased by a pleasant, yet mild bitter after taste. The richness of the flavour is enhanced as it warms up to room temperature.  M: Smooth, medium bodied that leaves a light oily coating in the mouth.  O: Very satisfying and rich similar to a good coffee or port that can stand alone without food. This is the best oatmeal stout that I have had so far.

113,571,falloutsnow,4.11,"Bottle from Whole Foods in Omaha, NE No bottled on date visible Poured into a standard US pint glass  Samuel Smith's oatmeal stout is an exceptionally balanced blend of malted and roasted barley giving a number of expected flavors. The body is notably smooth, from the use of oats in the mash. While I might prefer more aggressive-tasting oatmeal stouts, one has to acknowledge the fairly masterful recipe that blends all the components together in this.  Able to pour a rather tall head, comprised of medium and large size bubbles, tan in color, leading to a somewhat sponge-like head. Descends over a minute or two to a thin cap atop the beer. Leaves some very nice lacing. Body is dark brown to black, with lighter brown highlights emerging when held to light. Opaque, but some carbonation is still visible along the sides of the glass.  Aroma of toasted malt, caramel, dark chocolate cake, a bit of molasses, and faint roasted malt. Subtle, enjoyable, good.  Taste features lightly roasted malts with mild chocolate, licorice, and molasses. Has a slight mineral quality underlying all this, no doubt from the well water. Aftertaste of slight char and dark chocolate.  Medium-bodied with an exceptionally smooth quality to it. Carbonation is present, but it just slightly lifts the beer on the palate, making the smoothness all the more noticeable. Finish is pleasantly dry.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,scratch69,4.08,I poured a bottle into a mug.  Appearance- Black with a two finger head and a lot of lacing.  Smell- Roasted malt and oats with chocolate and raisin notes.  Taste- Very similar as the smell with the chocolate and raisin notes more pronounced. Slight bitter finish.  Mouthfeel- Medium bodied and silky smooth. Nice amount of carbonation.  Overall- Very nice example of the style. I tried it because I enjoyed the imperial stout from this brewery and i am glad I did.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,jsanford,4.05,"Appearance - Pours dark black with a creamy mocha head that settles to a nice cap, leaving behind some soapy haze. Smell - Dark malt, chocolate, toasted oats, and a touch of grassy hops. Taste - Similar to the nose, roasted dark malt, chocolate, oatmeal, and a bit of coffee beans. So smooth and drinkable. Mouthfeel - Smooth and incredible creamy, with a medium-full body and good carbonation. Overall - Such a classic, amazing Oatmeal Stout.

113,571,zeledonia,4.28,"Bottled 6 Aug 2010. Don't think I've had this bottle around for anywhere near that long. Hmm.  Pours very dark brown, with a fluffy, foamy, frothy 2-finger medium-tan head. Gobs of lacing, great retention. Pretty much perfect.  Smell is warm, sweet, full, and delightful. The oats are quite prominent, bringing that sweetness and light fluffy body. Roasted barley brings a bit of coffee.  Taste is quite good as well. Again, it's got that smooth combination of dark roasted malts and barley with oaty goodness. The flavor kinda flutters around its center, bringing hits of bitter coffee, grassy hops, and oats.  Mouthfeel is good, with some of the buoyancy that oats bring. But it's thinner and lighter than I'd like it to be.  There's a reason this continues to be the standard for oatmeal stouts. It's really freaking good, and all those characteristics I associate with the style shine through clearly. The oats are ever-present, bringing light sugary sweetness and mouth-filling fluffiness. An incredibly drinkable, sessionable stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

I get notes of chocolate, dark fruit and oatmeal. It smells fantastic. I taste oatmeal along with a slight bitterness. Also taste raisins and a hint of sweet chocolate. This is a very smooth beer and coats the mouth. Smooth from start to finish where I get a bittersweet aftertaste. It's light bodied and leaves somewhat of a raisin/dark bitter chocolate aftertaste. SS Oatmeal Stout is a good smelling and tasting beer with a fantastic mouthfeel. I picked this up as a gift pack with two other offerings and a glass for 10 bucks.

Taste: I have to be honest for me to give this a five wasn't hard...incredibly full of flavor. Complex and robust, yeast in full effect...hints of chocolate and a notch bittersweet.  Mouth: Medium to heavy, and just that smooth.  Overall: What have I been missing, this beer is already a favorite. I have seen it at the beer spot by my house handful of times and finally gave it a shot.

I am happy to have paired this with a prime NY strip steak. Big shock that a stout goes well with red meat.  I poured the 550ml bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a perfect black with a lighter tan head. The body is nicely thin as expected for an oatmeal stout.  The smell is spot on. You get a bunch of malt, some coffee, and a little sweetness.  The flavor is perfectly subdued. You get roasty notes and more malt. The coffee is there, but it is not overwhelming. I like the way it balances out.  The aftertaste eases off really well. I like the way that the feel of this beer makes this very easy to drink.  Samuel Smith has a very good history for making quality beers.

Sweet malts start up front and blends with a dry roatsed malt flavor at the back. Bittersweet chocolate comes to mind. M: silky smooth, full bodied. Dry finish with a sticky hang.

The color is a deep-dark coffee with a two-finger head. The smell is bright lemon with hints of oatmeal. The oatmeal becomes slightly more prominent after the beer warms further.  The mouthfeel is zesty, tangy, with a pleasant tartness.  The finish is extraordinary: lemony, with slight coffee undertones.

The head leaves traces along the glass, but just a little.  S - Mostly vanilla and just a hint of red fruits of sort.  T - Reminds me of the Stone Imperial Russian Stout... but more drinkable. Kind of the same flavor I gathered from that beer: licorice, anise, roasted malts and a coffee and semisweet chocolate aftertaste. Hints of vanilla and alcohol. Hops present but not overwhelming.  M - As the label says, ""wonderfully silky and smooth textured"". They're completely right, it feels like velvet going down your throat leaving small hints of carbonation (almost indiscernible).  Overall, an exceptionally good stout. As I said, it's kind of like the Stone Imperial Russian Stout, but this one doesn't burn your throat as it goes down.

The beer hints at some brown notes when tilted and even allows a little light in. Some carbonation lacing when the beer is swirled. Aroma: Roasted barley hits first followed by other malt aromas of toast, bread crust and some chocolate. A touch of souring gives it a dark fruits/licorice flavor. Taste: Flavors are at least twice the potency of the aromas. The roasted barley was bordering on cappuccino coffee and soured milk. The fruits and licorice become more plumb and prune like. Mouthfeel: This is an oatmeal stout and as such it is very smooth, despite the aroma telling me about the impending coffee flavors. Medium bodied, light medium carbonation. The carbonation really doesn't seem to play much of a role in moving the flavors around. A touch of dryness from the souring.

I was still in my ""more is better for cheaper"" phase, so I did not appreciate Smauel Smith's like is necessary. That being said, I happened upon a pint in the gorcery store picking up some sour cream for my semi-world famous black bean soup recipe, and snagged it up.  Appearance - Ultra black, no way to see through it even holding it up to the light. Big rich tan three finger head on it. No sign of lacing. Looks excellent.  Smell - Powerful aroma of toffee, caramel, roasted malts, even a tinge of milkiness. The brew smells fantastic, much in the manner of Founders Breakfast Stout, which is an impressive beer.  Taste - Perfectly balanced. Malts, oatmeal, toffee, chocolate. Everything the Creator imagined when he passed the Oatmeal Stout to us mere mortals. Awesome.  Mouthfeel - Wonderfully done. Almost a milky sensation, leaves an incredible toffee aftertaste.  Overall - I don't know which is better, this or Founders. I think I have to give Samuel Smith's the nod, although Founders is much cheaper. This beer actually gets better the closer it gets to room temperature. Although I served it warmer than most beers, it continued to advance in flavor and aroma complexity as it warmed.

Roasted chocolate malts, a hint of anise, a touch and alcohol and just a whiff of bittering hops.  T- I love its flavor.

So naturally, whenever I see an oatmeal stout (even one as highly praised as this), I have a sort of color-me-skeptical moment. After months of avoiding it, I've decided to give it a whirl:  A great, dark-brown body falls into the glass. Slight red hue breaks through where there's a light behind it. Frothy, half-inch head bubbles to life as I pour, a great tan color. I'm pretty sure I can already smell the oatmeal - a good sign! Leaves a great, caked layer of lace.  Leaning in closer, the aroma is fantastic. A sweet-smelling combination of dark chocolate, roasted malts, a hint of a sort of milky character. The aforementioned oatmeal is also fairly bold. Very lively and potent. I like it!  A milky body slips a really good flavor on to the tongue. Bittersweet in character, the oatmeal shines the whole way through. Along the way, various characters join in on the fun: roasted malts, a light touch of raisins. Finishes on the familiar oat taste and a surprising dash of alcohol. Just well-executed.  All in all, I can finally say, ""At last, an oatmeal stout!"" This is exactly what the style should be, and I couldn't have been happier to taste it.

This is a very enjoyable beer and considering it's imported from England it's a reasonable price as well.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,hopfacebrew,4.15,"Note: This review was a re-post from my former account, jmkratt, which was hacked and I lost all my reviews...sorry for the redundancy.  Poured from bottle to pint glass.  A - The beer pours a nice solid black with a light khaki head and nice lacing throughout.  S - Smells a little sweeter than I expected with a nice malt aroma. Can detect some coffee and roasted chocolate malt notes.  T/M - Just like the aroma the beer tastes sweeter than expected though is extremely smooth and creamy with coffee and roasted malts flavors. Terrific mouthfeel with mild bitterness that lingers lightly.  D - Great drinkability.  Overall, this is a great beer. I was told it was the definitive Oatmeal Stout.

The pour was good, the head was stable. The aroma was sound, the taste was big and smooth, the finish was fine. But there was just something missing for me. It wasn't exciting!

113,571,davewlfpckfan29,4.58,"Poured the bomber into a 23 oz. glass Served at about 40 degrees.  Notice right from the pour that this is a nice beer. Carbonation filled the glass and created a great light brown head. The color of the beer was a dark brown, but when I held it up to light there was a dark redish brown that was apparent.  The smell gave off a very breadish, and sweet yeast smell. Nearly perfect for what I would expect from an Oatmeal Stout.  I think this is honestly a great beer. As Beer Advocate says ""5's should be rare"". Well this is a rare exception  I wish I could get this in six packs",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,JacStance,4.76,"My wife picked me up a Samuel Smith Gift Pack this past Christmas. All three were delicious, though the Oatmeal Stout, in my opinion, was the superior brew.  The color is a very deep, dark brown with ruby undertones that certainly looks black. In fact, only holding it up to a light will reveal that it’s not. The head is a light brown, which itself is darker than most beers on the market, and is intensely creamy with incredible lacing.  The smell is less intense than a lot of stouts, and may fool you into thinking this beer will lack complexity or flavor. Thankfully, that is not the case. You can pick up the usual stout aromas of chocolate and coffee, as well as molasses and oatmeal, though less pronounced.  The taste is outstanding. I fell in love with this beer after one sip and now just need to solve the problem of finding a steady supply near my hometown. You can taste the oatmeal right away, and the chocolates and coffees and brown sugars melt away to a nice toffee finish.  It may be a little heavy for someone unaccustomed to the style, but it is much lighter on the palate than many other stouts out there, and incredibly drinkable.  Overall, I can’t recommend this beer highly enough. If you are a fan of the style, you owe it to yourself to give this one a try. Best of all, it’s pretty widely available and inexpensive.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,meeekyh,4.48,"I will start by saying that this is one of my favorite beers of all-time, so I will have to suspend that judgement in order to make an objective review. Here's to trying.  The first thing I notice upon pouring the beer into a mug is that the head is mighty and dark and fluffy.  Smells are bitter chocolate and coffee with not a screaming lot of other stuff going on, but this is a good thing as what is there is appealing. I am actually smelling a distinct roasted-barley smell, slightly grainy and a bit burnt. I don't believe I can distinguish anything resembling hops but that is to be expected for this style, as I understand it.  Mouthfeel is full but not particularly lingering. There is something to roll around on my tongue, but the sensations are wrapped so heavily in the tastes of sweet coffee and dark chocolate that the considerable carbonation and velvety texture are encompassed.  The 'overall' quaffability of this beer is stellar.  This is a beer for anybody who wants to taste their beer without being overwhelmed by toffee, or bubblegum or citrus or pine or anything else. It is sweet enough to be inviting, bitter enough to be interesting, tart enough to pique the interest of the lazy taste buds, and well balanced enough as to not leave a single one wanting.

113,571,Clowerweb,4.56,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle aggressively into a pint glass. No freshness date on the bottle, the closest thing I could find to a possible date was a ""7/10"" printed on the inside of the box (Freshness date? Production date? July 2010? October 7th (2011?)? Is it even a date?)  A: Very dark brown, almost black with dark amber highlights around the bottom of the glass. Beautiful. Poured with an amazing 4.5 fingers of darkish tan head, nice and sticky micro bubble creamy foam, so far great retention and nice sticky lace around the inside of the glass.  S: Not a lot going on here. I wish there was a little more nose, what I do detect almost smells like alcohol/malts, a bit bready, smells almost a bit like black licorice. Doesn't have the most impressive nose, but what's there isn't offensive, it's rather pleasant, just lacking.  T: Amazing. It manages to pull off an excellent full flavor despite the lack of nose. Roasted malts, bready grains, very earthy and roasty, light bitter hops halfway down, finishes back into a wonderful earthy grain, leaves a yummy roasted coffee malty aftertaste. Amazing depth and balance. Very hearty and delicious.  M: Nice full body, nice chewy feel, moderate carbonation, sticks perfectly to the tongue and walls of your mouth. Smooth and creamy going down. Delectable.  O: Excellent, excellent beer. Couldn't ask for much more. It's a tad light on the nose, but this is a very solid and nearly perfect stout in every other aspect, especially in taste and feel, where it counts most IMO.

When the head starts to die down it goes to about a half finger and just sits there- lovely.  Deep roasted malt, a grainy smell that I take for oatmeal and sweet maple syrup greet the nose upon the first whiff. Strong caramelization comes through afterward, and a whiff of alcohol, which is surprising on a beer with ABV this low. A subtle hint of baker's chocolate tops it off.  Caramel and roasted malt make up the bulk of the body of flavor. The malt flavor really explodes in the middle, with a little hint of floral flavor to balance it off. Ending is baker's chocolate.  Medium bodied, the carbonation helps push it over the tongue but makes it almost watery at times.

113,571,weizenbob,4.08,"This 550 ml bottle was taken from a Samuel Smith gift pack, which is really the best value for acquiring Sam Smith. You get three bottles of beer and a tulip-shaped brewery logo pint glass for less than the cost of buying the three bottles individually. This stout was bottled September 16, 2011 (oddly, this was much fresher than the India Ale from the same gift pack). It was served around 55 degrees Fahrenheit and poured into the accompanying glassware.  A standard pour (horizontal bottle, 45-degree glass) yielded a nice big three fingers of fluffy, khaki-colored head. Retention is very good. Delicate lacing glides down the glass as the head recedes. The brew is very dark with just a hint of translucence noted at the thinnest point of the glass. It is very nice looking, near perfect in fact.  It gives off a pleasant aroma as well. Impressions of chocolate are strong. Roasted malts are subtly noted. It smells slightly watery. Though the alcohol is well hidden, its scent is detectable enough to add some nice spicy character to the roasty chocolaty proceedings.  This flavor is very good. Hershey syrup sweetness crashes into a mildly warming alcohol leaving a pleasant impression on the tongue. Malts are roasty without screaming, ""Hey, I'm burnt!"" There is little to no hop bitterness. It is full flavored while maintaining restraint and tasteful balance. You don't find them like this in America.  The feel of this beer is absolutely heavenly. It is very creamy and goes down smoothly despite having a viscosity that much thinner than my American palate has come to expect. The carbonation level is low, but perfect. It is very easy drinking.  All things considered, this is my favorite oatmeal stout. I wish that I could find a domestic example that was this good, as $4-$5 a bottle for Sam Smith makes it unrealistic as a daily driver. Though it is generally excellent, nothing about this beer stands out in a way that justifies the inflated import pricing. That is really the Achilles heel and great tragedy of the whole experience. I'll drink a few of these every year; but as is, I'm still on the lookout for the perfect, reasonably priced, oatmeal stout.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (reference my profile for an explanation) I enthusiastically give two Schlitz for Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

T - Lots of flavors including dark chocolate, light coffee, molasses (but not sweet), roasted chestnuts, anise, light tannin, mild bittering hops.

113,571,IPA35,3.93,"My first oatmeal Stout.  A very dark brown, nearly black beer with a slightly tan, rocky head. Amazing retention. Truely beautiful.  Smells slightly roasted, quite hoppy; typical British hop aroma's, some of the typical stout stuff in the background; milk chocolate mainly.  A surprising flavour, much less full flavoured as I expected but that must be because most stouts I have had were Imperial Stouts.  It has a rather mild taste of roasted malts, not much sweetness; it is quite bitter because of the British hops used (even though they used cane sugar in the brewing process) as well, so it has a what I call a rather 'agressive', metallic, earthy hop profile. I could also be because of the oatmeal though. A well balanced, easy to drink beer.  The body is rather creamy, medium full with medium carbonation.  As with most typical British beers (like bitters) this beer lacks sweetness. If you like sweet beers you might not really like this. But it is a well balanced, easy drinking oatmeal stout. I don't really know what the oatmeal actually does with the flavour but it has made it nice and creamy. A nice beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Quite complex, and quite delicious!  M: Medium carbonation, and I have to say, a little thin textured. Not watery by any stretch, though. The oats give it an excellent creaminess - though perhaps not quite as silky as I would have liked, and the finish is just dry enough to satisfy immensely. The drinkability factor is disturbing...I'm having to refrain from guzzling this down in one sip.  O: Once again, Sam Smith nails it.

Mouthfeel: It has a low carbonation with a rich and sweet balance and feel.  Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,jifigz,3.91,A bottle poured into a pint glass.  This beer was pulled from the fridge about an hour before being drank so it could warm a bit. The beer appears an almost jet black when poured with red highlights when held up to some sunlight through a window. The head was a rich and creamy tan that refused to disappear. It lingered for quite a while and left good lacing as it receded. The aroma is grainy and almost spiced smelling as if there was a little bit of cinnamon added or something but I believe that is just the oatmeal smell coming through. Overall the scent isn't very strong.  The flavor is a roasted richness in the beginning that then blends into that same spice-like smell I picked up in the aroma. The beer finishes slightly bitter. Other flavor notes in its profile are smoke and chocolate. But all of these are in check and subtle.  The MF is good and creamy and rich. A good medium body for a such a tenebrous looking brew. This is a quality stout and a good beer from England.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Jerone,3.83,"A - Very dark brown with light penetrating the edges, a tan creamy head that leaves tiny ice bergs, not too much in the say of lacing.  S - Not a lot of smell, but there is some roasted malt, a bit of chocolate and a slight hint of oats and cream.  T - Starts out with dark roasted malt, oats and a touch of milk, slightly sweet, and goes to some chocolate then finishes dry and with a lingering taste of cream and oats.  M - Smooth and creamy, very low carbonation, the body is medium due to the oats. Mouthfeel is definitely the best part of this beer and is fun to swish around your mouth.  O - An enjoyable beer that has a very nice texture and enjoyable flavors but nothing that knocks my socks off. It is a bit pricey, I could have gotten a better beer for the same price.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,WMEugene,4.2,"A - Pours black (brown-base) with a tan/beige head that quickly dissipates to a thin layer, but with good lacing  S - Sweet malts, toffee, coffee, chocolate, a little milk or cream. Very sweet.  T - A nice blend of chocolate and cream flavors. Some other malt flavors are present; well-balanced. The bread and oatmeal flavors come through in the finish.  M - Medium bodied, light carbonation. A little thinner than I was expecting, but very smooth with a nice finish. Very drinkable.  O - I found Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout to be an enjoyable and very drinkable take on the style. It's definitely on the lighter side of stouts, but it still has lots of flavor.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Dubber55,4.2,"Dark brown with a 1/2 finger of soapy beige bubbles  Smells like roasted cereal grains, hops, bittersweet chocolate, and some coffee.  Taste starts of with some light roastiness and bitterness. This is followed by bittersweet and milk chocolate, and some coffee. This finish has more roasted malts and bitterness from hops. Nicely balanced and easy drinking.  Mouthfeel is light to medium- a little creamy from the oats. Low carbonation which works well. The mouthfeel is a little lighter than I like for a stout but this is only 5% abv so it makes sense that it's not thick and chewy.  Overall this is a very easy drinking, nicely balanced oatmeal stout- I could drink a lot of these in one night. This is a classic- would definitely buy again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,AnavelGato,3.78,"In a Brooklyn Brewery Snifter poured out of the Bottle, purchased at Total Wine.  Appearance: Dark, Like I’m talking pitch-black Dark, almost no light penetration. The head poured a good inch, which slowly dissipated to a constant covering of the top of the brew. Head is a light Tan, closer to khaki beige than it is to café con leche. The head leaves very nice thin lacing without having it “crust up” on the side after a while.  Aroma: Light Chocolate scent, very dry aroma. Lots of fruity notes again very dry. Trace notes of nuts and roasty scents.  Taste: very well balanced stout, every flavor has it’s counter part. The mild roasty flavor at the beginning is counter balanced by a good deal of bitterness. Chocolate and oatmeal along with a mild sweetness connect both extremes with subtlety as an underlying flavor throughout the brew.  Mouthfeel: Not as creamy as I like my stouts to be; however and excellent level of effervescent constant carbonation which keeps a thin head present all the time. Very smooth mouthfeel, which doesn’t dry out your palate or overwhelm it.  Overall: A very VERY well balanced beer. It manages to keep it’s maltic sweetness in check against the bitterness of the hops. And at a modest 5.00% ABV it doesn’t overwhelm the drinker, that’s not to say it’s sessionable but it’s definitely light by stout standards.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

T/M: The taste mirrors the smell, with fruits and sweetness dominating. The mouthfeel is thin for a stout, very prickly from the carbonation rather than smooth or creamy.  O: This is a very good beer that has a sweet but rather complex flavor profile, and a very fruity, almost wine-like taste and feel for a stout.

113,571,FosterJM,3.97,"973rd Review on BA Bottle to Pint 12 oz/ 550 Ml  Purchased a single bottle from Total Wine, Brea, CA  App- Nearly dark brown with some lighter brown on the bottom of the glass with some crimson edges. A good mocha one finger head with very little retention but falls to a pond layer.  Smell- A good bit of dark chocolate, roasted nuts, whipping cream and malts, coffee, and a little bit of smoke.  Taste- A good oatmeal stout that I remember tasting just a tad better. This had a nice dark chocolate with a little bit of whipping cream mixed in. Mix in some more oats and voila you have this one. The flavors blend well and are balanced on the palate. One of the classics, nice smooth and simple. I think this is where I find my wanting to rate higher but cant.  Mouth- A good light medium body with a creamy smoothness on the finish. A little bit of a medium low carbonation level. Good, simple and clean residual flavors of chocolate and grain.  Drink- Ah, Samuel Smith you do some great classic beers. Simple, smooth and well balanced. A very easy drinking small stout with a good blend of layered flavors.

The smell is very simple, smooth, and straight-forward. Don't expect a ton of complexity here.  T: Gentle notes of roasted grain, coffee, dark chocolate, oatmeal, and heavy cream dance across the palate. The finish is delicate and smooth with cream, oatmeal, and chocolate notes. The little bit of sweetness present on the palate makes this ale very appealing.  M: Medium-to-full bodied, creamy, rich, and smooth. Carbonation is present, but not particularly fizzy or distracting. This beer is almost too easy to drink.  O: As far as stouts go, this one is ridiculously smooth and drinkable. This isn't the most complex stout in the world; in fact, it's very simple and straight-forward. That, however, is far from a knock. Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout is utterly delightful in its smoothness.

113,571,StoutHunter,2.55,"This bottle of Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout came in their holiday pack for $11.99 at Meijers. So far I haven't been impressed with the other two beers from the holiday pack so I don't know what to expect from this Oatmeal Stout, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date. Poured from a brown 550ml foiled bottle into a Samuel Smith pint glass.  A- The label is pretty plain and almost exactly the same as their Nut Brown Ale, it's very plain looking. It poured a nice black color that has a little ruby red tint to it when held to the light and it had four fingers worth of fluffy light brown head that died down to a thick layer that left some nice lacing. This is a pretty good looking Oatmeal Stout.  S- Unfortunately this beer has a similar aroma to the other two beer. It starts off with that supper sweet malt aroma that smells like a mixture of sweet sherry and apple juice, I do not like this aroma at all. I can pick up a slight amount of roast in the aroma but other than that it is pretty identical to other beers, what a disappointment.  T- The taste is somewhat similar to the aroma with that high amount of sweet malts being the most dominating flavor in the taste. It has a high amount of medium sweetness along with a noticeable metallic taste. I do pick up some roasty flavors and a little bit of dark chocolate, but they are pretty light and are overpowered by the sweet malts. The finish has a low amount of bitterness and a sweet and roasty after taste, the roast shows up more in the aftertaste then it does in the initial flavor. I'm not impressed by the flavor of this beer.  M- Slightly smooth and cream with a medium body and a high amount of medium carbonation. The body could be thicker, it feels a little watery.  Overall I was unimpressed with this beer and I thought it was a bellow average Oatmeal Stout. What really hurt this beer was the fact that it kept that same super sweet malt profile that the other two beers had and just as it did in those beers it overpowers the flavors that define the style, in this case it overpowered the nice roasty and chocolate flavors that should be shining through. This one is a little easier to drink than the other two but it still doesn't have good drinkability, I wouldn't want more then one glass of this, the malt profile is a turn off and it doesn't hold my attention. What I liked most about this beer was the look, it looked pretty spot on for an Oatmeal Stout and it had very good head retention. What I liked least about this beer was the nasty overly sweet malt profile that all the beers in the holiday pack had, it overpowered the nice flavors that should be the highlight of this beer, it made for a pretty disappointing aroma and taste. I won't be buying this beer again or their Holiday pack, all the beers had the same bad malt profile. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who likes oatmeal stouts, it is pretty easy to find one that it much better then this beer. This beer was a let down and doesn't compare to the American Oatmeal Stouts I have tried, they are on an entirely different level. I was pretty let down with this beer and their holiday pack, after looking at the ratings I figured these would all be solid beers, but they weren't so either I hate the malt profile that they use in their beers, or I got some of last years holiday pack but with no dating I can't be sure and I hold that against them. The best thing from this holiday pack was the glass. This is the worst Oatmeal Stout I have had to date and so far I am not a fan of this brewery, I will be very reluctant to buy another beer from them, so far one of my least favorite brewerys.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,thehyperduck,4.41,"550 mL bottle. A classic that I have intended to review for a while.  Pours pitch black with some reddish tinges under the light, topped with a puffy, beige-coloured head of truly prodigious size; over three fingers thick. Good retention, with a silky-smooth cap remaining on the surface for much of the drink, and tons of lacing on the sides. Decent aroma, but nothing all that special contained within - lots of roasted doughy malts, mixed with honey-oatmeal mush.  To be honest, much like the aroma the taste is pretty straightforward but still satisfying. More dark roasted, doughy or biscuity malts and lots of oats, alongside faint notes of coffee and milk chocolate. Hazelnuts come to mind as well. Bittersweet finish with lingering roasted maltiness. Solid mouthfeel, pushing full-bodied for sure, with mild carbonation and typically minerally English well water. Thick, chewy, and very creamy on the palate. Unbelievably smooth.  The original oatmeal stout, this makes for a wonderful pint all around - easy to casually enjoy but there is enough going on to satisfy even the most anal of beer geeks. This stuff is my first choice when I'm in the mood for a sessionable stout and I will always recommend it for that niche. There are better stouts, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one that is more easy-drinking. Give this a try, you won't be disappointed.  [Updated Nov. 11 2013]  I've had at least 10 bottles of this since I first reviewed it, and I am always completely satisfied.

Stand was truly amazing! Clarity was good, but only seen when held to direct light.  smell (4/5) - really great smell, although it was a bit more mild than I would have expected. Flavors were of roasted grains with a bit of burnt malt in there. Sweetness was medium, which gave a coffee-and-cream or mocha aroma. I bit of a hint of melanoidin fruitiness, but nothing too strong.  taste (4/5) - similar to the smell, fairly sweet with a hint of fruitiness. The oat flavor (a nit nutty with a slight bitter richness) plays well with the roasty and burnt malt notes. The finish is molasses with a bit of dark fruit. Balanced well and mild.  feel (3.5/5) - medium-full body; a little light for the style. Lighter carbonation and the oats give a very silky, creamy feel. Decent for the style, but a tad light.

113,571,greenborn,4.75,"This is, in my opinion, one of Samuel Smith’s best offerings. The smell is this wonderful roasted barley smell which carries over very well into its flavor as does its silky smooth feel in the mouth.

Maybe a hint of coffee as an afterthought.  M: Good carbonation and moist up front, but with a lingering dryness that makes the mouth long for the next sip.  O: Top of the class! Really, this has me wanting to go back and mark down prior stout reviews (i.e. Guinness Foreign Extra Stout), but instead I'll give this one top marks.

113,571,MONKandTUCK,3.71,"From a bottle. I've learned that smaller Stouts really ought to be enjoyed on Nitro, conventional Draught, or widget can; not from the bottle.  A - Pours a luscious black with a dense head. It looks exactly the way a Stout should.  A - some roasted notes, nothing overly pronounced.  T - When cold it's very boring. Once it warms it gets some decent depth to it. The finish is roundly chocolate. It's not especially roasty, more dark and sweet. It really tastes like chocolate. The malty bridge is full of Sam Smith yeast flavors - my favorite part of the experience. A decent amount of crystal malt was used, but it doesn't do the beer great favors. At least it's more tame than Milk Stouts.  M - It's very wet. On the one hand, it's drinkable. People who hate the heaviness and burnt flavor in Guinness will see Stouts redeemed in their eyes after trying this. However, those of use looking for a substantial Oatmeal Stout won't find it here. There isn't the velvety character I was expecting.  O - It's sure drinkable, but it's not the stuff of legends. Really, it bridges more on what I think a Brown Ale should be than an Oatmeal Stout.

Appearance: Deep dark opaque brown (looks nearly black) with a two finger tan creamy foam head that receded slowly and left good sticky lacing behind. Receded to a frothy cap that lasted throughout.

The sweet dark roasted malts are right up front with that coffee and molasses flavor, with hints of spice. Then a little hops bitterness followed by a creamy sweet and smooth finish from the oats.  Mouth feel: Medium to full body with a creamy light carbonation that works well for the style.  Overall: I've had this Stout many times throughout my life and it's always a pleasure. A simple, yet complex, recipe that has been around for ages. It's easily one of my favorite Stouts out there, and quite possibly my favorite overall.

O: A solid beer, I don't love it, and I am not sure I would get it again, but it has its place.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,gregb13,4.01,"Pours near black with a small, frothy dark beige head with decent retention. Subtle aroma, what is there is nice; roasty, malty, sweet. Taste is very good; sweet molasses, malted chocolate, bitter chocolate, a little hops, finishes bitter-sweet. Delectable. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy.  Overall this is an excellent beer. Easy drinking, very sessionable. Pick it up if you can find it.  *Addendum 11/3/11: Drinking the other bottle I bought tonight, and pairing it with some buttery crackers and it is really bringing out a smokiness that I'd almost associate with a rauchbier. It is very pleasant to say the least!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,tobelerone,4.03,"A classic for sure, amazed I'm just getting around to reviewing this now...many bottles of this have been enjoyed over the years. One of the best stouts available in the US for years before the current craft boom. A great looking beer that's totally black and opaque; nice cap of tan foam with decent retention and attractive but not particularly sticky lace. Aroma is full of roasted malt, with an undercurrent of sweetness and dark fruity flavors. Taste is very roasty, moderately bitter, with a restrained hop character. Some chocolate, caramel, coffee and molasses also make an appearance. Nicely creamy and almost milky but with good carbonation. Modest finish that's a bit bitter but not overly long. Slightly sweet and sticky.  Everyone should have this at least once if they're serious about beers. Certainly not the biggest stout in today's landscape but I feel like this is one of those that set the standard for a lot of what is being brewed today. It's also easy to drink, sessionable, and damned tasty.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

I had the barkeep warm this a bit before serving it to me so I'm sure that helped immensely. Aromas of oats, roasted malt, a slight of coffee (?) and some sweetness. Taste was great: roasted malt, oats (like oatmeal that I could chew), a slight bit of coffee, some chocolate, and no hop bitterness to finish.

Lots of oatmeal, roasted malts, and just general sweetness. Finishes with a good amount of alcohol bite and some earthy hops. It isn't severe but adds a slight tart finish. Not overly complex, but enjoyable.  Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied, with above average carbonation but is still fairly smooth. Goes down easily. Overall a good stout to start a Saturday morning.

Smell: The smell is pure alcohol not much else happening, none of the flavors you would associate with a stout. It is disappointing the lack of aroma and only a alcohol smell from such a low ABV beer.  Taste: I can taste the carbonation and maybe a little hint of malts, but overall not much flavor. I would expect some of the creaminess from an oatmeal stout and it’s not there, in fact there is nothing in this beer except the taste of alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Medium thickness but not really oily, other than that the mouthfeel is really about average.  Overall: Not much flavor or anything to make this beer stand out. It is rated fairly high on the Top 100 Beers of Fame, but this beer did not impress me at all.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,Brenden,4.5,"The color is a rich dark brown with slightly reddish hues in the light. The tan head sits thick, creamy and dense over a finger tall and sits around, dropping sticky lacing in sizable chunks and clumps down the glass. This is a very pretty brew. Rich roasted malts with caramel and toffee sweetness greet me on the nose, with hints of chocolate and vanilla not far behind. Breads, barley and a touch of char even out the sweetness. The flavor follows suit; the oatmeal is very well-attuned in this beer and the yeast used complements nicely. Chocolate, vanilla, toffee and caramel all offer a bit of sweetness without being overdone, a touch of earthiness comes out, and just enough roast sits in the foreground all the way. Having had a few oatmeal stouts, this isn't as big a body as some. It is, however, thick, rich and full with a delicate silky smoothness underlying the robustness of the body. This has to be one of the best out there. It's simply a delicious, creamy, fantastic brew that I can get any time.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

S - Caramel, malts, chocolate, and oatmeal are the main aromas that push through. Seems like there is a little of the slate from the Yorkshire Squares that it's fermented in.  T - Starts with a dark caramel from the malts. Then the oatmeal begins to show through. Ends with a delicious match of chocolate and cream, but only lightly sweet.  M - Smooth, slides down real easy while still having the right body for a stout. Light carbonation that doesn't detract from the rest of it.  O - This is my go to stout, it is the perfect blend of deep flavors, aromas, and silky body.

113,571,LordOdin,4.88,"In short, this is an exceptional beer that is not all too difficult to find in a store nearby. If you have never tried this beer before, then I urge you go ahead and do so, even if a stout is not your preferred style.  More in depth, I consider this to be a well balanced beer in terms of smell, taste, and texture. In terms of smell, this beer shows hints of oatmeal, which is not a big surprise, and caramel, perhaps some brown sugar or molasses?  This sweet smelling aroma is a great indication of the upcoming taste. Overall, this beer has a balanced palate that is neither overtly sweet nor bitter. This sweetness makes it great to enjoy on its own, or paired with a full-flavored meal. While the taste does tilt slightly towards the sweeter side, it is not by much.  As far as I am concerned, the texture itself is probably the best part of this beer. As with many oatmeal stouts, the texture is both rich and creamy. It really does fill your mouth. Interestingly enough, this beer retains its head all the way through.  While I mentioned that the smell, taste, and texture of this beer were well-balanced, I should probably comment on the color itself too. As is expected, In its simplest form, this is a very dark beer. Other than that, however, I cannot say much else.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,TheAlamoWrocker,3.8,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, bottled on January 17 of 2011, into a Blue Star Brewery Pint Glass.  Appearance  This pours a coffee like color and damn does it look enticing. The head was barely there and I really don't really expect it to stay long with as fast as it's leaving. The color of it in the glass it just black. If the color ever enveloped me in a sudden moment I would only assume that I died.  Smell  On small breath-ins it smells like coffee, but if you take it in deep then the chocolate is nice and strong. The smell just feels dark and damn do I want to take this in.  Taste  This taste like a damn strong delicious coffee. The taste oddly does not stay strong as it's first taste. The aftertaste is not completely bitter, but it does leave a slight sweet chocolate feel. It's almost a dark chocolate. It leaves a Italian roast taste rather than a French toast taste. This is not my favorite style of coffee, but at least it leaves a desired taste.  Mouthfeel  The mouthfeel is slightly smooth, but with a mild carbonation feel. This drink coats the entire mouth that is just a magical feeling knowing that this drink could last that much longer in my mouth.  Overall  This drink does hit some nice points, but it's not all there. The coffee is all there, but I do like a bit more chocolate to my mouthfuls. As a stout it's all there, but there are other stouts that are so much more. I know that this ranks well as an oatmeal stout, but it doesn't beat out a top notch Imperial Russian Stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

S: the biggest scent I got was caramel with a background of coffee and yeast/malt.  T: Yummy! it had a slight coffee and cocoa flavor, slightly sweet but had nice hop bitterness at the finish. as the beer warmed more cocoa flavor came forward.  M: not a thick beer but substantial on the tongue, crisp with that bit of hop bitterness.  I cannot believe I have not tried this beer sooner, someone brought a 4-pack to a beer party I hosted, I did not get around to trying it that night, but there was one bottle left and it took me a month to try this, so glad I did.

You'll get a very, very dark brown, but this a dark beer. Not as dark as some of the super rich stouts out there, but it's darker than the average oatmeal stout, for sure. Head is big but recedes down to a line, and the lacing is excellent.  S: A surprisingly fruity aroma from this drink. It is not the breadiness that most oatmeal stouts have, but instead a sweeter and fruitiness overall scent. It's very pleasant and not too sweet.  T: This is the beer that got me into craft beer. Even a year or so later, I still hold this as one of the pinnacles of a beer style. There is a deep, dark, burnt malty flavor at first. This is really all one tastes at first. However, a sweetness very quickly balances out the roasty flavor, leaving a perfect balance in the mouth. Whether you are a dark, roasted person or a sweet and smooth person, this should satisfy you.  M: I don't think there's much left to say about this beer. It's the perfect mix of everything. The mouthfeel is thick, but it's not motor oil. There's very little carbonation, but the bubbles are somewhat detectable, so whichever your preference, you win.

113,571,Groomsy,4.11,"Thanks to my buddy Thomas for giving me a bottle of this. Euro-sized bottle poured into a pint glass. No clue how fresh or old this bottle may be. Review taken from notes, consumed on 09/09/2011.  Appearance: Pours a very dark brown, almost pitch black. The body barely allows any light to shine through, but contains highlights of dark crimson red. Topped by a thick and frothy tan head of two fingers, the beers leaves chunks and walls of lacing as it's consumed. An excellent looking stout.  Aroma: I get the feeling that this is not a fresh bottle, but what's in the nose is still very nice. The roasted malt is definitely there, and there are hints of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. There's also just a kiss of some floral/earthy hops and a vague sweetness from the oatmeal. A little more mild on the nose than I was expecting; smells like a toned-down stout with a smack of oatmeal.  Taste: Good stuff, which follows the nose in a fairly linear way, but much bolder in flavor than it is in the nose. Hearty roasted malt leads to a mix of coffee and chocolate notes on the middle of the palate, which transitions to a barely-there kiss of earthy and slightly bitter hop presence. The beer goes down with a smooth sweetness from the oatmeal. An excellent brew and very well balanced.  Mouthfeel: Fantastically smooth body that isn't too heavy for a stout. Low carbonation kick with some lingering and residual sweetness from the oatmeal. Best thing about the beer.  Overall: Great beer, but I would love to try this fresh to see how much bolder some of the flavors may be.

113,571,mayorwalda,4.5,"Oh boy, I’ve been waiting to try this one for a while.  Samuel Smith’s Oatmeal Stout.  From the pour, this is a stout drinker’s stout. The brew is truly black and quite thick, allowing almost no light through, and collecting a thick even head that is a pale brown in color. After watching the head for a bit, the lace starts to form. And while the lace is not entirely consistent, not woven or too evenly distributed, where it is found it is thick. If I am to be completely honest I was a little disheartened with my experience of the beer’s aroma before tasting. One of the big things I was anticipating was a distinct smell from this beer; something mild, sweet and, well, oatmeal-y. Sniffing around the glass before tasting the beer, I got none of this.   But then I took my first, long, savory swig and everything changed in an instant. With a sip in mouth you can really, really dissect what makes this beer special and untangle the different, very subtle aromas in this beer; most notably the mild sweetness it has. The taste, while in mouth, is smooth with your typical dark malts, but also—of course—a lighter, mellower sweet taste, which no doubt can be attributed to the oatmeal and some caramel malts. The sweetness, in both taste and aroma, provided by the oatmeal is very well complimented by the spot-on carbonation and creamy mouthfeel of this beer and those characteristics, together, make this a brew that you don’t want to put down. I should say that when you do put it down, is when you experience some of the toffee, coffee tastes which sit in mouth pleasantly.  The skinny is like this.  A: This is your Ur-stout, the perfect stout as far as appearance. Very dark, lets no light through, has a great, thick head, and lays down some strong, though sporadic, lacing.  S: Well, just smell alone doesn’t do this brew—or the aroma itself—justice, but while drinking, the sweet, mild aroma of oatmeal is what makes this stout what it is.  T: While described on the bottle as “bittersweet” this beer is something more like ""sweetbitter"" providing a sip that is mild and sweet, followed by the typical stout flavors of toffee, coffee and dark malts.  M: The mouthfeel of this stout is creamy, excellently carbonated, even and fulfilling without being filling or too heavy.  O: I think I’ve said more than enough, but, to contrast I’ll sum it up as concisely as I can: sweet, mild, creamy, aromatic all while being expertly subtle in its crafting.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Taste is roasty and chocolatey, caramel, light metallic notes. Slightly drying and mildly bitter finish. Full and creamy feel, succeeds at coating the mouth. Great balance between the sweeter caramel notes and bitter roastiness. Great beer and the quintessential oatmeal stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Pintofbrown,4.17,"Appearance: A completely black body with no highlights noticeable. Also very little head. It fizzed a bit and thought it might make a cap for a second, but then thought better of it and only created a slight film.  Smell: The nose is great. The classic, sweet Samuel Smith bread malts combine with a little bit of a warm alcohol scent. Then there is more sweet that comes from the oatmeal and caramel malts. Extremely appetizing.  Taste: The sticky - slick malts have a toffee and roasted coffee flavor to them. The little bit of alcohol warmth of the stout comes through about mid drink. Then when it almost starts to lose control, the oatmeal rescues it all and provides a mealy and sweet flavor that balances out the roasted stout qualities.  Mouth feel: It is really slick and sticky thanks to the addition of the oatmeal. The stout is a little on the medium side despite this, and for the style, it could probably be more chewy. Still, the coffee bitter finish keeps things interesting.  Overall: Samuel Smith beers really win in the flavors and the mouth feel, and this Oatmeal stout does very good in both categories. Another great beer that I will definitely put a star next to. Very good.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BradtheGreat7,4.21,"1 pint size brown Samuel Smith's bottle that has a classic English style label. A worthy and notable trademark that comes on all Samuel Smith's brews. Poured into a English style mug.  A - opaque black. Maybe some brown? Not sure, I had this experience where the lights were dim. Pitch black Is a good way of describing this brew with a fluffy tan had that was creamy and long lasting. Nice light tan lace as well.  S - Nuts and molasses with some earthy and roasted malt notes as well. Sweet smelling brew.  T - Great samuel Smith's style taste that I get with most of their dark brews. The Smith's style molasses throughout was lovely. Oats was well incorporated. Woodsy notes but also enough sweetness to make it a solid tasting brew. The dark earthy notes were my favorite part. Also some sort of bitter coffee taste.  M - smooth mouthfeel. Thick and creamy body which makes it easy to drink.  O - overall a classic English stout, and basically the staple of what an Oatmeal Stout should be. Just an anytime beer for me. Easy going and lots of good English oatmeal flavor. I'd drink this any time anywhere.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Taste upfront is sweet and roasted malts that delivers a bitter and milk chocolate tour-de-force. Milky, earthy, richness transitions to a bitter finish. Magnificent balance.

It's a little thinner than I remember, but the body works well enough. There is a slight oily slickness that reminds me of cola. The nose and flavor both hold notes of roasty malts and sweet oats. Rich and delicious with a good bitter and drying bite on the back end.  Overall, this beer was, is, and remains, an absolute classic. This could very well be the benchmark of the style, the oatmeal stout by which all others are judged. This DESERVES an A, and any beer better than this is truly a masterpiece.

113,571,Roke87,4.03,"550mL bottle, slightly chilled and poured into a Duvel tulip.  Appearance- Pours like a black hole, no light penetrating this one from any angle. Average pours yields two fingers of soapy, bubbly tan head that somewhat quickly dissipates to a bubbly top and a nice thick ring around the glass, leaving lots of nice spider lacing throughout till finish.  Smell- Not a whole lot going on in the nose, the only things I can really pick out are mild roasted malt and alcohol, and maybe a bit of a sweet toffee aroma coming through as well.  Taste- Very sweet right off the bat with a toffee taste to it, again I can really taste the alcohol which is weird for such a low ABV stout. Roasted malts and oatmeal are next to make an appearance on the scene, with an ever so mild chocolate and coffee taste in there as well.  Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied, with average carbonation, this stout is very smooth going down.  Overall- I don’t think I should have reviewed this one after drinking such an amazing beer before because this one is definitely a lot more average than I expected for “the celebrated oatmeal stout” Very much a british style stout, and very basic in both the tastes and smells unlike its north american counterpart. It is a nice stout don’t get me wrong but nothing amazing to be honest.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

MF: heavy body, crisp flavor, good moderate carbonation.  O: when I thought life couldn't get any better than Guinness (20-21 years old) some one bought a bottle of this for me.

It has a big, thick, mocha colored head that retains an 1/8 inch puck throughout. It leaves full rings of lacing, pretty nice.  S: Up front mostly roasted malts come through. As you drink you start to notice more subtleties in the smell which include coffee, sweetness of chocolate, oats, and a bit of a hop finish.  T: Once again, the malts come through strongly. There is also a pronounced nuttiness and oatmeal taste. It has a nice amount of sweetness and a little sting from the hops at the end.  M: It is very, very smooth. It's like drinking silk. The amount of carbonation is flawless and its body is on the lighter side. There is a slight crisp finish from the hops that acts as a good palate cleanser for your next tasting.

S - Smooth, roasty character that does not overpower.  T - Bold, rich flavor of coffee, toasted almonds and (gasp!) oatmeal. Blends nicely.  M - It's pleasant to say the least. No interfering carbonation, but not as creamy a character as the Imperial Stout. I really just think it's my expectations.  O - At long last, I've found an Oatmeal Stout I like.

I also somewhat surprisingly get some cinnamon notes which go very well with the other flavors. Medium to thick mouthfeel and low carbonation.

113,571,DabblinWiscCraft,4.24,"Pours a deep coffee or cola color: deepest brown--almost black--with red showing through at the furthest edges. It has a very nice espresso crema head, about an inch and a half tall that falls down to about a quarter inch that really sticks and leaves some cling. The bouquet has big roasted malt right up front--extremely rich and somewhat smokey. Coffee, licorice, and dark chocolate are all well-represented, as well. There's also a more subtle butterscotch scent in the mix. The nose on this beer is really something special. Perhaps it's owing to this amazing smell that the taste is something of a letdown. There are muted roasted malt flavors at the front. Just a suggestion of the coffee and chocolate notes from the nose in the flavor. There's much more pronounced nuttiness than the nose suggests. Very smooth and balanced flavors throughout, ending on a more clear alcohol taste and a bit of hop bitterness. A bit of metallic flavor in there, as well. The feel is medium-bodied and actually much more viscous than I expected. Smooth and creamy, with very little sense of syrup. Some bright acidity and nice crispness at the close.  This beer has quite a reputation, and justifiably so. It is a very well-crafted stout that hits all the right notes. Having such high expectations, however, I was a bit underwhelmed by the flavor. This tasted to me like all the rich and powerful notes in the nose were turned down about three notches on the palate. However, this is still among the best stouts I've had, and it's certainly a beer I will return to.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

The other beers out there, in my opinion and mostly, yield solidity on the palate, this beer just slides right down, perfectly carbonated, awesome this one is. I enjoy one of these often and will probably continue to do so for some time.  If this is one of those beers that you've seen on the shelf and just have never flocked to it, run up on it.

Smell is creamy and is indeed reminiscent of oatmeal. Chocolate and coffee are present as well.  Taste is great. The oat-based, roasted malt comes through clearly, with some chocolate surrounding. Moderately bitter finish, but there is a sweetness present as well. The finish contains more chocolate than the rest of the taste.  Mouthfeel is nice and robust, though not super heavy. Carbonation is fairly low, which is also nice. Feels very good.  Overall- a really great beer. In a way, it is a simple beer, but is extremely good at what it is.

113,571,fountainofyouth,4.05,"Purchased at the Bier Baron in Washington, DC. Poured into a standard pint glass.  Appearance: Pours dark brown with streaks of ruby red. Nearly opaque. There's a two-finger khaki head that looks wonderfully foamy; it leaves a great deal of lacing. (If I didn't have the bottle in front of me, I could have guessed it came from a nitro-tap!)  Smell: Very hearty malt aroma, imparting a sweet bread and oats scent. In the background are hops and alcohol.  Taste: The sweet oaty malt is the first thing I get. There's also a pleasant charred-meat flavor to add a bit of darkness to what is otherwise a lighter flavor balance. I also detect a little bit of sweet chocolate. The finish is long and drier due to a helping of floral and grassy hops. The hops give necessary balance, but the finish still has some malt sweetness. My only complaint is a mild lingering acidity.  Mouthfeel: Very unusual for a bottled stout with no added nitrogen. The feel is light, almost fluffy, and fairly watery. The carbonation is pretty mild and doesn't overpower the flavors at all. The most ""drinkable"" stout I've ever had.  Overall: If every aspect of this beer was just 10% bolder, this would be an unbeatable beer for its style, in my opinion. But if you prefer the restrained English style, you probably won't find any fault here.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,hoptualBrew,3.95,"550ml bottle with classic label work, gotta love Samuel Smith's artwork. Served around 50 degrees.  Poured aggressively into big snifter with a wollop of head - a big viscious pillowy coffee khaki head that sticks to the glass. Color on this is dark brownish black but can see amber hues on the edges when held to light.  Smells milk cream sweet with alot of roasted oats and molasses in the nose. Muted chocolate malts blend with pale malts & oat.  Creamy mouthfeel is immediate & just really sets the tone for the taste. Oat & nutty chocolate milk sweet. Up front is that sweet and smoothe oat presence with chocolate malt hints throughout. The back of this is a nice drying bitterness I am guessing from some hopping & those dark chocolate components leaving a little bittering bite at the end.  The body is just too light for me. I think a thicker body on this stout would greatly enhance it. Well carbonated & works perfectly with the as-is thinner body style.

113,571,JohnnyBarman,4.47,"Great find at the LCBO - Samuel Smiths brews are always welcome on liquor store shelves! Though perhaps not the best brew to enjoy in the midst of a July heatwave, I'll take it!  Poured into my trusty Duvel chalice. Dark, nearly black, with some sharp caramel hues around the rim. Leaves a frothy inch-high off-white head that survives fairly well, and leaves some flecks of lacing and a solid ring towards the end of the pint.  Nose is lovely coffee, chocolate, caramel, roasted marshmallow, toasty malts and other fantastic examples of deliciousness.  Rich, hearty, full of flavor, its no wonder Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout has developed such a great reputation. No chance of any flavor retreat here - the coffee, chocolate, toasted malts and caramel notes are amped up as high has they deserve to be, making each sip a joy.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly light, silky, and coats the palate wonderfully. I opened the first bottle too early out of the fridge and it was very 'hot' and over-carbonated. A night in the cold, then a few minutes to warm a little made all the difference for this beer.  Great stuff, easily in my top five oatmeal stouts.

S: Chocolate and roasted malts with black coffee and buttery undertones, and hints of molasses, yeast, nuts, and charcoal - slightly smokey.  T: Sweet brown malts, powdered hot chocolate, and slight oatmeal flavours taper off into robust roasted malts, bittersweet dark chocolate, molasses, and nuts. Some earthy (leafy and a bit woodsy), black coffee, and cocoa bitterness mingles with butter, yeast, and sweet caramel malt towards the finish.  M: Full-bodied and filling with fairly crisp carbonation complementing the creamy, slightly sticky mouthfeel. The lingering, bittersweet finish balances the richly sweet flavour profile seamlessly to prevent it from ever feeling cloying.

Celebrated Oatmeal Stout is a style benchmark revived by Samuel Smith's and the inspiration for hundreds of commercial oatmeal stouts.""; Captioning a picture: ""Knocking down the lively head of yeast formed during fermentation in 'stone Yorkshire squares'.""  My pour created two foamy fingers of deep-tan head with great retention. It looked like the top of a root beer float. Color was a deep, dark brown with cola highlights at the edges. Nose had a roasty, chocolaty sweetness, not really dark chocolate, but more like chocolate and smoke or chocolate and charcoal. Mouthfeel was more active with carbonation than I would prefer from a beer whose brewers are calling ""silky"". Taste was rich, chocolate and a light smokiness, to me more of a dessert beer than an everyday beer. I have to agree with them about the ""bittersweet finish"", but it was more sweet than bitter. I tend to think of bittersweet in terms of chocolate and this was somewhat sweeter than that, but there was also a modicum of bitterness.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,GavDomDadGH,4.75,"A - poured a light black, very little light getting through. Nice 1.5-2 finger head. Retention down the glass well after the beer is gone.  S - A nice roasted malt smell. Hints of molasses and chocolate.  T - Amazing. One of the best oatmeal stouts I have ever tasted. Starts strong and finishes smooth  M - Thick like any great stout should be.  Overall - I would recommend this beer to any stout lover! I am more of a Russian Stout man myself but I am in love with this beer. I wish I could find something wrong with it, but I just can't!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BeerFiend2002,4.45,"From a pint bottle poured into tumbler. Poured a dark mahogany to black color with a khaki-colored, frothy, 2-finger head. Decent amount of carbonation with small bubbles. I enjoyed the remainder of my beer with some chocolate and they complimented each other perfectly.  The nose consisted of roasted and smoked malts. I also picked up some sweet black licorice notes along with a little coffee.  The taste consisted of roasted and smoked malts with an only slightly bitter coffee and oat taste. Not as much oat notes as I expected and it was a little less creamy than I had hoped for, but those are the only two knocks on it. This is a very drinkable, medium-bodied stout.  Overall this is a fine stout and I would suggest this to anyone who fancies the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,jkrich,4.3,"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date, only a code stamped on the bottle. The stout poured a deep, brown with a foamy, sustained tan-head. Intricate lacing formed on the glass as the head slowly subsided.  The aroma was slightly spicy and sweet like molassas and licorice.  The intial flavor is soft and chocolately sweet with a bit of hoppy tanginess in the background. There is a slight roastiness, but largely sweet, yet always refreshing. In fact, this stout is extremely balanced and never becomes cloying even as it warms in the glass.  The mouthfeel is smooth with surprisingly spritzy carbonation that only adds to the refreshing flavors on the palatte.  This is truly a quaffable stout that one could easily enjoy any time of the year.

S: Aromas of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and cocoa powders fill the nose. Pleasant aroma – not overwhelming – but refreshing.  T: Dark rich ale with nice roasted malt sweetness. Nice chocolate and coffee overtones compliment this nice malt background. Only slightly hoppy and smoooth. Alcohol is present but in the right amount.

A - I got too much of a head, because I had this bottle in my cabinet and not the fridge, and I forgot that a warmer beer might have more head. Yikes. Once it died down, it stayed about half a centimeter of consistent light brown foam. The body was dark brown, almost like a cola.  S - Toasted malts mostly. Caramelly and bready,  T - Very good. Again caramel and bread/biscuit type flavor, but also light bitter chocolate or coffee too. Not as much oatmeal as in other versions.  M - Really nice in the mouth. Very smooth, but with lingering bubbles that help with any lasting bitter roast flavors.  D - Just an excellent beer.

A frothy half-finger head the color of light cocoa powder sits atop for a minute before crackling away to a thin top layer.  Brilliant nose. Smoky pork, milk chocolate, sweet oatmeal, vanilla, coffee with heavy cream and even some toasted wheat. Perfect.  The flavor doesn’t quite live up to the nose, but exhibits many of the same characteristics. I get oatmeal, vanilla, slightly tangy chocolate, hints of smoky pork. It leans slightly to the sweet side, but has just the right amount of earthy hops that emerge before the smooth, bready, medium-dry oatmeal finish.  The body is a bit of a letdown, as I expect creamy fullness in my oatmeal stouts. This one displays moderate carbonation and soft fizziness inside a body that’s just a bit too thin. Clean finish for what it is.  I’m flabbergasted it took me this long into my beer drinking career to try Samuel Smith’s Oatmeal Stout. I understand its popularity — it’s got great flavor, it’s easy to drink, and I would smell it all night if I could.

Appears black as hell like an Imperial Russian Stout and quite thick, though not as thick as one, which is good as a pint of Imperial Stout would be nigh on impossible to drink easily.  Smells malty and sweet, lip-smackingly appetising. I'm looking forward to this.  Upon tasting I get malt, chocolate, a general sweetness though this is not overpowering or indeed very pronounced at all.

Wonderful variety of flavors come across and is accompanied well by a creamy silky smooth texture. Sweet and malty upfront with hints of toffee and brown sugar before a roasty coffee note comes in. Chocolate notes can also be detected more as the beer warms. Sweetness also has a fruitiness that I don't normally see in stouts but I'm definitely enjoying it.

Yes, the world would enter a new phase of consciousness. This company also makes the best pint glass on earth.  It's black earth, it's powdered bark, it's topped with raisins.

Carrying through the flavor is a refinement and clean flavor - and the beer finishes very clean. The oatmeal creaminess and roasted malt flavor shines in its subtlety and combines with a slightly sweet dark fruit flavor. The body is a little thinner than desired normally, but with good carbonation. I wish there was a touch more assertiveness in the flavor - a bit more roast or chocolatiness, but more importantly, there is a slight flavor in there that I do not like. I want to say it is a touch of sweet smokiness? Don't hold me to that, but there is something in there that brings it down a notch for me.

A: A moderate pour produces a 2-finger bubbly tan head that recedes rather quickly, leaving a fairly dense lacing. Color is reddish-chocolate brown during the pour and resides jet black in the glass.  S: Dark fruit, some sweet oatmealy grains, light molasses. Something else that smells tasty, but I can't quite put my finger on it (toffee maybe?).  T: Rich chocolate, bittersweet cocoa, mocha coffee. Very sweet and relatively mild. Lacing clings to the glass after sipping and does not want to let go. Sweet roasty malt remnants remain in the cheeks to be sucked out at a later time.  M: Creamy for sure, very fine carbonation aids in the creamy feel, slightly oily finish. Neutral dryness.  O: Great stout, almost porter-like in its presentation, but not quite as bitter or flat. A change-up from the Russian Imperials and a welcome dessert treat for me. No alcohol to be found anywhere, this could be a session beer no doubt.

This beer is so silky, and creamy and smooth its hard to describe until you try it for yourself. Its also slightly chewy. Doesn't get much better than this.

113,571,BarryMFBurton,3.65,"Never had anything from Samuel Smith, but this particular brew has been on my list for quite a while. The name “Oatmeal Stout” is different, yes, and it definitely used to turn me off (I’m not a fan of oatmeal in the slightest). Now, however, I find it nothing less than intriguing.  A: This one pours a thick, syrupy black. There’s only the tiniest bit of light that’s getting through the body. The head is big and dark brown. Intimidating.  S: There’s a ton of sugar in the nose. Brown sugar and cinnamon – not surprising for oatmeal. Chocolate and the bitter hints of yeast.  T: There’s a nice dry breadiness that comes across the entire palate. Not as sweet as the nose, but I like that; it allows more of the mellow barley flavors to come out. The sweet is in the form of milky chocolate and wheaty banana. It’s a good blend of simple flavors, but it’s a bit bland at times. It’s smooth and balanced in a way that doesn’t let a whole lot of flavors emerge. Still, a nice sipper.  M: The flavors almost beg for this to be a thick drinker. Its syrupy look is quite contrary to the in-mouth texture. Just because it’s surprising, though, doesn’t mean it’s bad. In this case, it doesn’t serve the palate in the best way.  O: I really wanted to love this beer. Unfortunately, it had the elements I don’t like about oatmeal – improper texture and taste that, at times, is pretty bland. It’s not a bad beer, but it’s definitely not in my hall of fame.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

I never knew I could be that wrong before (I really should've learned from Young's Double Chocolate that cheaper beer can be good beer)  Appearance:  Pitch black, thick, similar in color to tar. Just like a stout should be! The only reason it missed a perfect 5/5 is because it could be a shade lighter and it wouldn't hurt anything. 4.5/5  Smell:  I'm getting a nose full of... hmmm... prunes... and a hint of grape. Maybe a little bit of plum. Smell is incredibly inviting. 5/5  Taste:  Smooth, delicious, dry. That plum comes back strong and segues into a dry oatmeal style flavor. It cuts off the sweetness at just the right time to keep it from ruining the flavor. 4.5/5  Mouthfeel:  Thicker than average, but I would've liked it to be just a little tiny bit thicker. It needs to be almost chewy to make it perfect. 4/5  Overall:  WOW. For the price, I can only say that this beer is one of the better choices on the market.

The beer gives a bountiful light tan head standing firmly over a deep, dark mahogany liquid. Nice gentle woodsy aroma. A little cocoa. Something else I can't quite put my finger on. Oats? Very subtle.  The taste is very smooth and creamy. Very rich and velvety mouthfeel. I taste nuts, raisins, toffee, sarsaparilla, cola, and a hint of vanilla. It's got a fair amount of sweetness to it, but there's enough bitterness to balance it out and remind you of what you're enjoying. This baby is smoooth. It doesn't bite at all. Unfortunately, the finish doesn't last all that long and you quickly want another sip.  I haven't had this beer since college, but it's just as I remembered it - very easy to drink. When I'm in the mood for stout, I usually go for something more substantial, but this is still one delicious brew. It's very satisfying without being heavy or overwhelming.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,SpdKilz,4.1,"This is one of the first craft beers I ever bought. I have been sitting on this for over two years.  Appearance – Pours into my glass with a dark chocolate, semi see-through color. About a finger and a half of dark tan head is achieved that dissipates at a moderate pace leaving nice lacing.  Smell – Lots of chocolate, oats, barley slight vanilla, maple/caramel, and dark fruits such as raisin.  Taste – I was expecting the flavor to be a hint more sweet from the aroma. Bittersweet cocoa, rich roasted malts, slight licorice and dark fruits.  Mouthfeel – Medium to a hint lighter bodied. Slightly creamy yet still, as stated, a bit lighter mouthfeel.  Overall – A good rendition of the style, though honestly I probably wouldn’t get it again. Crazy I have held on to this as long as I have.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Faints hints of chocolate and mocha.  T - No taste is too strong. Nice notes of bitter chocolate, dark fruits, oatmeal, toffee, and even a hint of vanilla, quite nice.  M - Almost silky. It's got some body, but it's quite smooth. Leaves the throat a bit dry.  Overall - I thought it was a pretty good beer. It was unoffensive, so it was good, but at the same time, it left me wanting a bit. But it was very solid.

113,571,Flounder57,4.67,"Just stopped by East Milton Liquors to try something different and grabbed this and West Coast's Imperial Stout. Going to be smooth and chill night.  Appearance: The beer poured a one finger off yellow head and the color is pitch black. Leaves lacing on the glass as the beer was drank.  Smell: I can smell some chocolate and the roasted aromas produced from the malt.  Taste: Delicious. This beer has a nice blend to it. It is smooth and silky. You got hints of chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, a little oatmeal, and a little vanilla. It all mixes well with each other and make me want to take another sip.  Mouthfeel: The beer has a little bit of carbonation. It went down smooth and finished dry. So good, I took many more sips to let it wander.  Overall: I have had this beer before and would purchase it again. Very easy to drink and would buy another bottle or order it on draft if it were ever available.

I know I'm getting ahead of myself, but this beer is silky smooth yet thick and creamy. Very nice.  Smell: Molasses and faint chocolate. Not too strong.  I'm having a tough time pinning down the taste. Good roasted malt flavor, some dark chocolate and molasses. There's some bitter herbal quality.  Quite complex.

I noticed at the end of the bottle, a little more character came out (malty scent and a little bit of vanilla).  T: It tastes like a mellow stout, light on bitterness and slightly roasted. There's a slight vanilla flavor.  M: It's dry and has a little sting to it. I was surprised it's not as smooth as it looks in the glass.  O: Overall it wasn't bad, it's a very non-distinct stout which is pleasant. I wish it had better character in the scent because it really detracts from the overall appeal getting a nose full of metal when drinking. At the end of the bottle the scent got much better.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,zoso1967,4.03,"Oatmeal Stout pours a dense looking dark walnut brown color that only lets light penetrate through when I tip the snifter and hold it up to a light. The head is a thing of beauty with its latte’ color, creamy texture and excellent retention. Lacing is also quite good, leaving plenty of foam art on the sides of my glass.  The aroma is strikingly fruity with a nice raisin character that hits the nose first before the more stout like chocolaty and slightly roasty notes come through. Oats also play a pretty major role in the nose with their hearty aroma showing much more than in most oatmeal stouts I have had.  The flavor is still quite fruity with a definite sweet character to it and some raisin notes, but it has a bit more of a roasty bite to it. Bitter cocoa and some coffee notes blend well with the fruity character, some toffee and a nice molasses sweetness. This stout is far from in your face and all the flavors meld together well, offering up a very enjoyable drinking experience.  The mouthfeel is lighter than I had expected after seeing how thick the beer looked. It is squarely medium but has an amazingly silky texture that makes this a joy to imbibe. The finish is slightly fruity and chocolaty with a definite sweetness lingering.  I had this beer once a long time ago and remembered being a bit disappointed. While not as roasty as I tend to like my stouts, this is a very tasty beer that was super drinkable and had some great flavors to it. It is a must try, as well as a beer that I will most certainly revisit in the future.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Great lacing.  S: Undeniably English. Roasted oats, raisins, molasses, and an earthy, herbal, almost floral sweetness.  T: Dark roasted malt, molasses, some chocolate, and a big helping of sweet, fruity, estery English yeasty goodness and a slight earthiness. Finishes a little tart with a full, round sweetness balanced lightly by a weak bitterness.  M: ""Light"" for its jet-black color and oh-so-smooth. Light carbonation keeps it slick and velvety. Lovely.  O: Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is a classic and is definitely like tasting a little bit of history (especially considering this beer was reintroduced nearly a decade before I was born!) I personally prefer the American Oatmeal stouts (there's something about genuine English beers that are cloying to me - their unmistakable flavor profile gets old quickly to me for some reason) - maybe American beers are just a bit ""crisper"" or ""cleaner."" Whatever it may be, I'm happy to try the Oatmeal Stout By Which All Others Are Measured, and I'm sure I'll revisit it someday, but for now I think I'll stick to the American versions.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

T- Roasted malt at first with a lot of earthy undertones that carry on throughout until the finish, which is dry and biting with a slightly acidic quality. As it warms the oats becomes more of a standout on the palate and a smoky peat moss and tobacco quality becomes more noticeable in the undertones.  M- Creamy and silky, very smooth and full bodied, the carbonation is low as expected.  D- Very drinkable and at 5% ABV you could try to session this one, it is a meal in itself though.

Mid had a black berry like taste to me, finish had a nice sweet then hoppy finish.  Final Thoughts: Good Stuff. It's suppose to be pretty much baseline oatmeal stout, and I can see why.

So soft and smooth in the middle and finish, just amazing mouthfeel. Thick and creamy and delicious. Velvety on the tongue from the oats.

The oatmeal isn't big and chewy but leads the mothfeel instead. The finish is sweet and pops a bit from the carbonation. There is a very small hint of smokey vanilla towards the very end.

T- The taste isn't nearly as sweet as the aroma. There's some raisin, wood smoke, rye bread. Much more of a char character like an astringent Baltic porter compared to the sweet smell which resembled more of an Impy stout.  M- Good carbonation level. It's a scoatch syrupy but not very much.

Incredibly balanced flavor with the sweetness of the malt and the chocolate being countered by the roast of the coffee and the very mild bitterness that disappears as soon as this is swallowed. Completely clean finish.  M: I'm being a stickler by only giving it a 4.0. The mouthfeel is pretty standard for an oatmeal stout--thicker than a lager but it's not milk. I just want the creaminess of a Belhaven Scottish Ale mixed with the flavor of this beer. It'd be like a milkshake.  O: Everyone in my family likes this beer, and NO ONE else in my family likes beer.

113,571,Ommy,3.85,"The Oatmeal Stout is poured dark and frothy. The head seems to dissipate in a minute or two until it reaches a thin top layer, leaving behind a beautiful lacing. It is fairly opaque and appetizing.  On the nose I get a mocha-chocolate mix, with some cream aspects at the end. The hops are very much in the background, accentuating the darker flavors nicely. The whipped cream from a pie comes to mind.  The taste is quite different that I had expected. I seems partly subdued in the beginning, a fair strength taste of roasted barley in the midtaste, with a decent bite on the finish. The aftertaste is not bad, it reminds me of the feeling and taste you get after eating a banana.  The mouthfeel is very interesting. It is sort of a mix between smooth, and stingy. The brew washes over the taste buds like silk, but then attacks them with the bitterness of the hops. I like it a lot!  Overall I would say this beer is very nice. The taste on the beginning is a little lackluster, but not underwhelming in the least.

The aftertaste is round with some residual chalkiness and burnt toast.  I was expecting a much drier stout, mainly due to my lack of experience with anything but Irish stouts.

Not too sweet and not too roasty. Notes of chocolate, coffee and vanilla. So very tasty in an almost simplistic and straightforward way.  Creamy smoothness due in large part to the oatmeal. The body feels somewhere between medium and heavy. Quite impressive for a five percent beer.  An all around solid brew. Funny and somewhat sad that it has taken me this long to discover this gem.

Mouthfeel - Creamy, medium bodied. Slightly metallic aftertaste, but barely noticable.

S: A nice molasses aroma with chocolate and a hint of oatmeal. Also a nice coffee aroma. Overall a pleasant smell.  T: Wow, what can I say? I was a little hesitant about an oatmeal stout but damn was it worth it! It has a slight oatmeal taste with your usual flavors, coffee, chocolate, molasses. It also has an earthy tone throughout it that really brings it all together.  M: Very creamy, but not so milky if that makes sense. It has a great body to it, very rich.  D: I could definitely sit down and savor the four-pack I bought it in. It is rich but not so overwhelming that you can only drink one.  Notes: I was really impressed with this Beer.

None of that is infused into the flavor though.  The first thing that comes to mind after a small sip is walnut. That flavor is followed by chocolate and of course oatmeal. Those flavors cover well the bitterness that is found in stouts.  Samuel Smith stouts have always been great and this beer is nothing less than excellent.

The taste on this is a bit sweeter than I would have gathered from the nose, with some dark fruits and molasses that I didn't gather in the nose coming through. The oatmeal aspect is also a lot bigger here and helps alongside with the coffee to make this less sweet. It's a solidly tasty brew for sure, just a bit too sweet for my liking.  The mouthfeel is thick and very smooth, and the drinkability is quite good. It goes down easily, but I have to wait a bit before going back for more because of all the sweetness.

Taste makes up for the lack of smell. First thing I notice is that it is not a heavy stout, but a rather thin one. Molasses taste is up front, roasted malts are present, not overly bitter, some acidity may linger on the palate.

There is also some roasty and cookie notes.  For a single stout, this is a solid offering. Plenty of chocolate malts, oatmeal, roasty notes. A mild coffee like bitterness comes in at the end for a good balance.  Medium-full in the mouth with medium carbonation. Some stickiness in the end.

Buckwheat noodle smell and body with some dry qualities. What is this soba beer? Good thing I like Soba noodles! Tasting of the beer brings out more of its fruit upon smell.  Upon taste is a wash of sweet cherry fruit with just the right body. Malty borderline sweet caramel and a faint dense roast feel. How can roast be dense? But this is. Really interesting composition with this beer, not what I expected from the nose. This almost feels like out of the bottle like it comes from the cask.

The taste is fairly in line with the smell though thankfully the earthiness is a little less prominent and allows a bit more of the pleasant cocoa and roast notes.  The mouthfeel is lightly creamy, medium bodied with nice prickly carbonation.  This was a pleasant beer that I enjoyed drinking, though I doubt that I will purchase it again.

113,571,eat,3.68,"The last bottle from a Samuel Smith gift box, poured into it's branded pint glass. The pour looks thinner than I was expecting for an oatmeal stout. An opaque, black body retains a thin cover of mocha coloured head.  Tons of dust/must (box of old clothes from the attic) up front on the nose while it's cold straight out of the fridge. A little cheese, some dark malt, apple juice, light caramel. As it warms, milk chocolate emerges along with more of a roasty character. I don't know what to make of this one. As odd as that combination may sound, it doesn't smell at all bad; though it's definitely unexpected.  This is nothing like what I was expecting. I like it but it's completely different from any other oatmeal stout I've tried. I actually did a double take looking over at the bottle to make sure I was drinking what I thought I was drinking. Lots of apple cider-like sweetness, light flavours of roasted malt, Samuel Smith well-water minerals (I love the character of their water; very distinctive), dark earthy hops. Subtle on the oat presence. Most of the stout character to be found here is on the finish with lots of dusty cocoa to dry your mouth. Actually as I drink this beer I'm enjoying the cocoa finish more and more; the cocoa really intensifies as it warms.  For an oatmeal stout I find this to be too thin-bodied. A decent medium body nonetheless with very light carbonation.  I'd have to say this beer is drinkable more than anything else. Not really what I'm looking for in an oatmeal stout but it is fairly tasty and would totally be sessionable. I had been wanting to try this beer for a while and was hoping to be blown away; I'm a big fan of their imperial stout and brown ale. Sadly I'm only left thinking it was all right.

There's light chocolate, light dark fruits, and light roasted malty sweetness. The flavors are just meh. The mouthfeel is perfect though. This beer is exceptionally smooth.

113,571,bamadog,4.04,"Review is from notes taken on 2/5/2011 and poured from the bottle to a snifter.  Appearance: When it comes out of the bottle, the pour looks a little thin and watery; color is a dark coffee brown and it starts with a creamy tan head that fades very quickly to nothing other than a thin skim and an uneven, but full, ring around the surface; body is dark and nearly entirely opaque; leaves one big wash of lacing along the sides of the glass that eventually drips down into spots.  Smell: Smell is quite good, and I'm saying that when I'm sampling this with a pretty bad head cold -- nice roasty and slightly burnt coffee-like smells; definite presence of chocolates, some slightly bittersweet and some kind of milky sweet; slight cherry-esque presence as well and much like the SS Imperial Stout, I'm reminded of chocolate covered cherries.  Taste: Pretty good, but I don't think it's quite the same caliber as the SS Imperial Stout -- nice burnt and roasty coffee-like malts that have just a touch of bitterness to them; bit of an earthy nuttiness to it as well as some oat; slight chocolate that has more of the bittersweet or bakers' chocolate flavor; I feel the cherry aspect that is present in the nose is there in the mouth, but that it's rather muted. Overall, very solid, but if I had to choose, the IS would take it.  Mouthfeel: My assumptions based upon the look of the pour prove correct -- the body does come across a little thin and watery; carbonation is prickly and lively; a moderately thick sticky and semi-dry coating is left all over the roof of the mouth; slight grittiness is left on the teeth.  Drinkability: Certainly solid enough -- a great set of scents and pretty decent flavors to follow; body isn't as thick and smooth as I would like, but it also doesn't come across heavy at all and with the moderate ABV of 5%, I would say it would be easy enough to get through a couple of these in a night with little to no problem.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

D - This beer is very similar in all respects to their Imperial Stout, but I think it is more drinkable because the sourness seems to have been cut by the dryness of this beer.

I held it up to my lamp and it totally blocked out the light, just incredible looking with a thick creamy khaki head that had incredible retention and left excellent lacing. One of the best looking beers I've ever seen.  S-Roasted malt, chocolate, slight dark fruit hints.  T-Wow, this is an amazing tasting beer. The malt hits with an added oatmeal punch, it's like breakfast in a glass. Coffee, caramel, slight vanilla and chocolate, dark fruits once again. This is sheer bliss for my taste buds.  M-Thick and creamy, low carbonation just the way a fantastic stout should feel.  D-This very quickly became one of my favorite beers of all time.

It adds a lot to the overall flavour as you are taking a sip as well.  Taste: Full bodied chocolate with the oats really coming through on the finish. It starts with a molasses tinted sweetness but dries off towards the finish with some light hops poking through.  Mouthfeel: Rich and smooth but not too heavy.

113,571,CuriousMonk,4,"Bottle poured into dimple glass. Pours black with a medium quickly fading head and great lacing. Aroma of roasted dark malts, chocolate, oats and the signature Sammy rusty water aroma I get from all their beers. Flavor matches aroma with the oatmeal and chocolate standing out. With a little cocoa powder for good measure. Palate is creamy, then dry and ashy. A classic and tasty stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,humbleevenstone,4.83,"So I like meals in a glass you can't see through. I wanted to see how a stout from the British Isles measured up. This one is awesome.  The texture of the off white head reminded me of the frothed milk you get on a really good latte. It was smooth and thick and unfortunately didn't last all that long. The dark almost black brew looked great.  There wasn't a powerful aroma but a gentle touch is sometimes all you need.  After the first drink it felt like sweet and acidic notes were messing around just waiting so that the second drink would melt around those flavors. The nutty, roasty flavor works its shift and leaves the sweetness and that little tang so it can start the process all over again.  The liquid feels substantial in your mouth, just a slight effervescence to stimulate the taste buds. Its rich without feeling too heavy.  Delicious drink. Always a good idea to try an old master that has been around awhile.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,PeprSprYoFace,4.41,"I think this is one of the best, if not THE best, examples of a properly brewed Oatmeal Stout.  Pours a deep black. Extreemly nice creamy looking head. Looks very sticky like an oatmeal stout should.  Nice stout, roasty aroma but I think the aroma could use a little more kick.  Taste is creamy and smooth. Nice roast with a good caramel sweetness. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel is awesome. Nice and creamy and perfect carbonation. I just wish this was sold in some sort of nitro container.

113,571,TheQuietMan22,4.43,"Appearance: Straight pour into a pint glass. The color is a deep, deep brown that is heading toward black. Though the back label says it is opaque, a lot of light passed through when I held it to my lamp. Three fingers of tanned head developed and dissipated to leave a lacing of thick spots and a ring around the edge. It looks very creamy.  Smell: A nice blend of sweet caramel, slightly roasted dark chocolate, oatmeal, brown sugar, black licorice, and butterscotch. Though this is obviously much darker, the sweet caramel reminds me of Fuller's London Pride.  Taste: Wow. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy; it seemed like my first sip slowly and hesitantly rolled off the edge of the glass. The taste is a heavenly blend of elements from the smell; the roasted dark chocolate is most prominent, and it leaves a nice bitterness, but added to that backbone are flavors of oatmeal, brown sugar, and butterscotch. The sweet caramel is there as well, likely keeping the roasted bitterness in check, but it does not announce itself for me as much as it did in the smell.  Drinkability: Damn good stuff. It is certainly worthy of celebration.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Aromas of toffee and roasted malts. Some butterscotch and an earthy scent. Light hop florals. Taste follows nose with a lovely dry finish that showcases the blend of malted barley and oats. A bit of chocolate blended in. Feel is silky smooth and light on the tongue. Carbonation is light and delightful.

Just hoppy enough to balance things. Very earthy and rich. Sweet up front and sorta dry at the end.  M- Surprisingly light for a beer as chewy as this one. Slight tingle from the carbonation.

It looked great, a great visual representation of what a stout should look like. the head was about half an inch thick, with a nice cream color. There was a great lacing in the glass as I enjoyed, a beautiful ripple going down the glass. The beer was black, no light coming through this sucker!  The scent was a little chocolatey, with a gentle citrusy crispness. If you really get a good, big whiff of it, you can smell a little bit of a coffee smell as well. Not bad!  The taste was very complex! hints of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and a very very slight grapefruit-ish taste as well. I really enjoyed the taste and wanted to really explore the complexity of this brew, but it just tasted so damn good!  It actually felt very light for a stout, which is nice considering that the beer comes in a 550ml bottle. It tastes wonderful and is light enough that you can enjoy the whole bottle without feeling like you ate a steak dinner!

A nice chalky head forms that dissipates to a thin sheen of froth with some thicker patches of foam. Lacing is subdued but present nonetheless.  S: Roasted malt, Chocolate malt, a hint of brown sugar and maybe a little bit of caramel there as well. Nice sweet grain smell.  T: Incredible! Tasted sweet, but not syrupy sweet nor light fruit sweet. It was something akin to dark chocolate with a touch of caramel and brown sugar. Hop bitterness is just barely detectable. It stays around just long enough to cleanse the pallate and leave you wanting another sip.  M:Not heavy, which is kind of what I was initially expecting. It is nice and crisp which complimented the body perfectly. A quenching dark beer. Not so much of a warmer which I didn't altogether mind considering how wonderful it was otherwise.

T.- Tad bitter at first(although not overly so), rapidly sweetening to that perfect balance tastes of oatmeal up front, followed closely by chocolate covered rasinettes and a hint of espresso.

The body is as black as black gets and completely opaque, all the way to the edge of the glass. Spare lacing.  S: The aroma is completely malt driven with almost no detectable hops. Malts include roasted notes of chocolate, coffee, oats and grain. The yeast profile adds scents of earth and well-conditioned leather.  T: Fruit expressions of plum and fig are included on the palate, layered in between the roasty notes that the nose suggested. The flavors last fairly long on the tongue with a touch of sweetness and finishing with an acrid bitterness followed by off-putting metallic notes. Sammy's oatmeal stout is respectably flavorful for 5% ABV.  M: Medium-full body and creamy texture. The carbonation is fizzy, perhaps providing a bigger tingling sensation than I prefer.

Body is thin not to thick wich I feel compliments this brew greatly. Aroma is of a roasty oats/malt with the slight hint of a dark chocolate background. These two aromas compliment each other greatly with providing the desired smell/taste up front with the undertone armoa/taste he;ping to stand these main charectors threw.

Obviously Guiness gave me a one sided example of the style. Quite drinkable!  I still would not call myself a stout guy, but this definitely improves my opinion of the style.

The head is pretty thick and impressive....seriously this thing will not go away!  S: The nose is excellent on this brew. Oatmeal is strait up front, with subtle notes of chocolate. This brew smells like a fresh baked oatmeal cookie.  T: The flavor is heavy in the oatmeal, which smooths out the English malt bill which tends to be a little rough. This is a full flavored stout. When they say oatmeal, they mean it!. Pleasant notes of chocolate with a little bitterness on the finish round off this brew.  MF: The mouthfeel complements this brew well. Creamy, but can be a little fuller.  D: At 5%, you're dam right this stout is drinkable.  Overall, Samuel Smith's own a special place in my heart.

Smell: Alcohol, cherry and raisin. As the beer warms the raisin smell becomes richer, almost chocolately like a Raisinette.  Taste: Raisin character remains in the taste, along with a roasted flavor that I did not pick up in the smell. Interesting and complex.  Mouthfeel: Again the raisin taste is left lingering, along with some hoppy bitterness.  Drinkability: Definitely a different tasting beer. Complex, sweet, and surprisingly low in ABV unlike most ""unique"" beers brewed today. A little pricey in my opinion, but it does have a nice presentation which makes me feel somewhat stately just for buying it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Smell: I pick up oatmeal, a nice slightly roasted malt, some chocolate and nice earthy notes in the nose.  Taste: Sweet oat, chocolate, roasted malt that gives a slight subtle smokiness as well.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied and very smooth and creamy.  Drinkability: An old favorite that often gets overlooked by me for other beers.

Special thanks goes out to Spinrsx for his knowledge sharing and willingness to take on an understudy!  550 ml served in a chilled glass  Apperance - beer pours a nice brown, fairly dark. The head is a gorgeous 3-4 fingers on the pour and is fairly light in appearance. It is hard to tell carbonation, although light does pass through the beer.  Smell - I can smell some coffee/expresso, toffee and hints of chocolate. A very well balanced smell that is not overpowering yet distinct in each of its scents.  Taste - very smooth on the tip of the tongue, almost sweet followed by a good kick of bitterness. The deep undertones come through here, chocolate and that expresso flavour. The toffee is present right at the start. The back end features the bitterness that is lasting.  Mouthfeel - very complex with the added carbonation, the beer is offering a deep velvet feel with a full bodied taste.  Drinkability - One of those beer that u must try and is good for those cold nights.

113,571,Bouleboubier,4.75,"Why don't I drink this more often? Well, I will now. Anyway, unlike my experience with the benchmark Tripel, by Westmalle, this benchmark Oatmeal Stout is full of wonder (not that Westmalle wasn't good...)  Poured from the large bottle (22.7oz) into a Sam Smith's pint glass, the fallow-hued head shot up tall and fierce and the definition of 'cottony', with overzealous stickiness (as in, lacing). Below, 91 1/2% pitch black, though if you want, hold it up to the light to reveal its prismic highlights of deep burgundy. Or don't.  My, what rich, soft, brown sugary, dark roast coffee, round smooth supple malt aromas! Kind of sporting a fresh-baked muffin quality. Effortless to take in such bold bouquet. Not much in the way of hoppy or roasty bitterness. Quite inviting.  The first thing I noticed when I took a sip is how wonderfully the malty sweet liquid encompasses the palate and rolls thickish yet clean and smooth across the tongue. The flavor is none too shabby, either. Homemade, densely hearty-grained, oatmeal-cookie-flavored coffee comes to mind. A little toffee, a good bit more coffee and molasses. Hardly cloying in its (exactly as the label mentions) bittersweet follow-through and finish.  Kept me feverishly wanting more after every sip, but presented or balanced in such a way that I was helpless in my desire to savor each sip. Excellent, and perhaps the Old Brewery's best offering.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

T: Very dark roasted malt coming through as almost burnt coffee (Starbucks anyone?), some chocolate, prune, slight caramel-like sweetness, smooth oats in the background. Has a slight metallic aftertaste. Very little hop character, fairly rich and creamy. Reminds me of a Guinness, but far more complex, balanced, and heavier body.  M: Very smooth and creamy, medium body, fairly light carbonation, a little chewy. Has a light, dry finish; bittersweet.  D: This is a very easily consumed stout. It isn't heavy like big stouts can be, yet is very flavorful and balanced.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,chumba526,4,"Pitch Black it appears with a large creamy light brown head.  It smells of slightly smoky malts, chocolate, and oats.  It tastes of caramel, coffee, mild chocolate, smoky malts. The taste ends with a bit of bitterness.  The carbonation is moderate low and it has a smooth present mouth feel.  The drinkability is very good because it has a nice smooth mouth feel and the flavors of the beer blend together very nicely.  This is not a fancy Oatmeal stout but it is a damn good one and one of the best classical examples of the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,bfflo,4.1,"Pour: Pitch black with fluffy cream-white head. Decent retention and smooth lacing. Smell: Bready, sourdough almost; yeasty and grainy, with a soft, sweet, sugary toffee caramel note; molasses, maybe? A bit of a metallic edge, though. Taste: Smooth, sweet-ish, medium body, but with some character. A bit watery entering the mouth before a creamy, toffee-sweet character usurps the palate. Fairly clean and very smooth; silky and buttery; and just a pinch of hops and grassiness, as well as a pinch of gassy metallic sourness, in the finish. This is pretty nice, a winning, easy drinker. Pretty mellow, but still complex. There is a bready sweetness that sticks out, and gives it an almost candy-tinged character. I am on the fence as to whether this is a positive or negative. Like their Imperial, this Samuel Smith leans a tad sweet for my liking, though not to the point of ruining anything; and like their Taddy Porter, there is a slight, weird pungency in the background, which I'm not sure how to feel about exactly. Still, there's no question this is a quality brew that makes for some good, pleasant sipping.

113,571,alcstradamus,4.26,"This was one of the beers that got me addicted to craft beer. I've never bothered to purchase a bottle for reviewing though, so thanks to Jim for swinging one my way.  Pours a deep brown with two fingers of bubbly mocha head and spider web lacing.  The aroma is of lightly toasted bread, cocoa powder, faint floral hoppiness, and peanuts.  The flavor follows suit quite nicely. Not a huge flavor profile, but a very well rounded one with toasted malts, nuttiness, and cocoa powder.  The body is medium and carbonation is appropriate.  Overall this is a fantastic session beer and one of the best session stouts on the market. Nothing here will knock your socks off, but it is not designed to. I have had a couple bottles in the past with a metallic flavor which were drainpours, but I'm sure they were handled poorly. Far more often then not they survive the trip to America perfectly fine.

113,571,afksports,4.45,"I bought a bottle of Sammy Smith's Oatmeal for a recent class I had where I presented on some integration of RFID and beer. Needless to say, presentation went well. Especially because no one popped this bottle and I get to drink it now.  I'm tired of all these highly rated stouts being big. It was about time someone came around and did a nice one at 5%. Thank you, Samuel Smith (who apparently has done this for some time...).  It pours a rich malty dark brown with a sweet tan head of about a finger's depth. That head remains on top of the beer throughout with a tasty ring. The aroma is malty, chocolate, and oats fully in there. Taste has a nice bite of hops that keep it from being too sweet, and that's complemented nicely by chocolatey bitterness. It feels like a stout should, but it's not too thick that you don't feel like you could have more than one. Best part, you can have it after a workout and not feel terrible. I bet it's low-cal too.  Ok... maybe that last one is stretching it too far.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,TheBrewo,4.4,"The pour delivers a beer of the deepest brown, which holds a two and a half finger mocha colored head. When held to the light there is visible translucency towards the edges and bottom of the glass, but it is otherwise dark. The head is light and foamy, slowly receding to leave a thick, batter-like lacing down the glass. The aroma is composed heavily of malts, with oats clearly peaking through. There is also a sweetness of dark fruits, such as figs, and a faint twinge of metallic fragrance. The taste begins with grains. The frontrunner here is malty, but there is a soothing swirl of oat and lighter grain which calm the malts down. As the sip progresses through to the middle, there is an enormous sweetness, coupled with a nice roasty flavor. The sip concludes on the anticipatory notes of dark chocolate and bitter coffee. The mouth is left semi-dry, gently coated, and cooled. The liquid itself has medium to high carbonation and a thicker body, but goes down with an unexpectedly slick smoothness. Because of these characteristics and the standard abv, the drinkability is quite good.  Overall, the absolute best thing about this beer is the mouthfeel. It is silky smooth, and curiously curbs some of the admittedly robust flavors into easier drinking components. This brew exhibits the full gamut of aromas and flavors, and then some, expected of a stout, helping propel it as an exceptional beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Not overly flavorful (maybe somewhat under-flavored). Bit of a metallic flavor present, too, though. Not a fan of that, but it isn't too bad.

The taste is oh so smooth-- sweet and creamy upfront with a pronounced roasty/chocolate maltiness. Toffee and nuts start to show up as it warms. Light bitterness (and a touch sour?) in the middle keeps the rich malt in check perfectly, leading to a finish that is neither sweet nor bitter, but begs for another sip.  Silky, luxurious body with a nice a creamy mouthfeel. I remembered loving this when it came available last year around the holidays, and I wasn't let down this time around.

Mild sweetness and earthy tones.  Roasted malt goodness delivers with a smoothness that can't be beat. Oatmeal does justice here, as the roasted malts are smoothed over, providing a very refreshing stout. Sweetness is there, but is suppressed by a mild hop profile.

There is a nice aroma of coffe and roasted barley. That follows with a nice deep aroma of heavy grains. This beer isn't complex, but given the style, its a great respresentation thus far with a brew that seems to have a great focus on the great and malt profiles. I am not really detecting any presence of hops.  As stated above, this brew is not complex, but for the representation of this brew, its probably one of the best I have seen. Its balanced perfectly and goes down smooth. The flavor that his you first are the grains and the coffee. Once you get that nice roasted coffee flavor, it follows up with the barley and oatmeals flavors that just give this brew a wonderful flavor. At the close of the brew this is a bit of a bitter, alcohol taste, but its very light, and goes well with the brew.  The mouthful is amazing. There rich, darkness of the beer covers the carbonation. The carbonation though, makes everything just blend well. Its a little heavy, but the ABV is relatively low. Its a nice smooth brew, and a great finish.  As I stated a few times above, this brew is a fantastic representation of the style. Its a great creamy beer, that is just smooth and comes together and has a nice finish.

113,571,katybee,3.95,"Hmmm. Well, I can say I preferred this over the slightly bitter-sour taste of Guinness stout...but for a ""celebrated oatmeal stout"" by an English brewery, it wasn't quite as expected.  Poured the classic dark coke brown, with not excessive 1/2"" tan head...minimal lacing...standard.  Only trace hint of malt smell as the beer warmed...barely anything at all.  Having recently tasted Guiness, I was expecting this oatmeal stout to be much sweeter and medium bodied in comparison. Instead, it had barely a flavor at all, even on outbreath. Not malty at all. Perhaps slightly ""bready"", like a dinner roll, with honey....No toasty carmels, although some malted flavor did come forward with warming to room temp. Exceptionally ""plain"" --no untoward aftertastes of either malt or hops towards sourness or bitterness or any flavors at all...which would make it a good session beer or combined with any food, even finer pastas.  Nice thick carbonation foaming inside the mouth, but still not the slippery creaminess or thickness of some; I'd say this had a thin-medium body comparable to Guinness.  Very drinkable; almost ""dry"", a little sweet; good in combination with any food.

Perfect pour (if I don't say so myself) into my american pint glass. Full figued mocha colored head that was slightly bubbling out over the top. Head has taken it's sweet time to recede, and so far great lacing.  Very nice roasted malts and dark chocolate on the nose.  Taste is ultra smooth. A hint of roasted malts, but a lot of sweetness. Haven't had many oatmeal stouts, but I don't remember them being this sweet. Not a bad thing at all. Quite pleasant actually.  Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but what do you expect from a 5% beer? Mild carbonation as well. These guys know what they are doing.  Super drinkable. It was really nice to find a beer under 6% that tastes as good as this one does.

I was interesting in trying the Oatmeal Stout again, and this deal was too good to pass up at $10.99. Each bottle separately is around $5 so you pretty much get a free beer and glass this way. Nice!  A - Pours a silky smooth, oil black with only a smidge of dark brown highlight at the bottom of the glass. Builds about a 1-fingered head that surprisingly disappears within minutes. Low to moderate lace trails. Can see traces of carbonation rushing up the sides of the glass.  S - Smell is relatively mild. Getting bits of coffee and roasted barley and deep, heavy grains. Not complex but enjoyable given the low ABV. All around really centered on the grain and malt profiles almost no appearance of hops.  T - Taste is again, not incredibly complex or robust but it's insanely balanced and goes down so easily. As in the nose, the flavors are predominantly coffee and earthy grains. Really get the barley and oatmeal flavors behind the coffee. Touches of bitter and alcohol at the end but only very faintly.  M - Mouthfeel is fantastic. The blackness of this beer really conceals the carbonation, which is active in the mouth to make everything blend that much better. Coffee flavor sticks around and it's relatively heavy bodied considering it's not a 'giant' beer. Coats the mouth with its long finish.  D - Drinkability is amazing as well. The adjective I can best describe this beer is 'creamy' and 'velvety smooth'. Everything about it comes together quite well and as I finish this review I am almost done with all 18.7oz.

113,571,EwaldEichstaett,4.51,"Everything about this beer is creamy and smooth. It pours a dark brown color with a brown head. Hardly any light passes through. It retains a bit of a head throughout and laces decently.  The smell is dominated by roasted oatmeal, sweetness, some refreshing hops, a hint of chocolate and a hint of nut. The taste is a thick creamy oatmeal flavor, with hints of sweet chocolate and smooth roasted malts. Perfect for the style.  The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy with a slight hint of spicyness/carbonation and a nice hop offset. Mild, but complex and wonderful flavor. This beer is highly drinkable :) Cheers!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,mariposafan,3.13,"First the good. It pours deep, dark brown with a very nice tall tan head. Some head and lacing persists. It smells sweet and rural - I don't know how to describe it beyond that. For me the smell evokes hay and corn fields just before harvest. The mouthfeel is lighter than I expected it to be but not light, and the creamy carbonation makes it seem thicker than it is. Mostly the flavor and drinkability are very good as well. The taste is mostly grainy with some semi-sweet chocolate and malt. Just a little bitterness shows up to balance the scales while drinking it. Maybe there's some oats there as well but I'm not sure I'd know what they taste like in this setting.  Then the not so good. The aftertaste when the drink is done is horribly, nastily bitter and it lasts and lasts and lasts. I eventually had to use mouthwash to strip the bitterness from my tongue. Even that was only partly successful. I suppose that would be a reason to keep on drinking them but I can't say I'll seek it out again unless I know I'm going to be having something really searing afterward. Damned shame, too - otherwise this was a definite keeper.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,nataku00,4.27,"Poured from a bottle into a 16 oz straight sided bar glass. Pours a very dark brown bordering on black with an initial finger or so of light brown foamy head. Head dissipates quickly with just a little light lacing.  Nose is roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate. Some caramel sweetness as well. A good smelling stout that is a nice change from the coffee and dark roasted malts of some RIS's I've been having.  Taking a sip, not too bitter. Good sweetness from the oats balancing the roastiness in the malt and chocolate flavors. Very creamy mouth feel, full bodied beer from oats combined with the perfect amount of carbonation to make the beer seem like it was on nitro. Easy to drink and a nice standby to have for times where I would like a regular stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Chizoad,4.3,"One of my favorites although I haven't had it in a while.  Pours a dark , but not opaque, molasses and supports a very nice tan head that eventually faded but left a cap for many minutes. Little lacing but that can be forgiven.  Roasted malt and molasses aromas, classic stout nose.  Brilliant flavor balance, with an up front sweetness from the malts offset ideally with excellent flat bitterness. Warms you up for the next sip.  Shockingly not that think. In fact I would go so far to say they could increase the weight of the body on this beer and I would like it more.  If they increased the weight though the beer wouldn't be nearly as drinkable as it is. At only 5% ABV, this is relatively light and highly consumable stout. A classic.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Mild smell of oats as the bottle cracked open, tan head with very good retention. Oats, a hint of coffee and chocolate somewhere in the back make this stout downright delicious. Smooth as silk, each sip leaves you wanting more, every sip is a revelation. It is the most well balanced oatmeal stout, period. Drinkability is exceptional, I can never get enough of the Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout.

Aroma: Medium high in strength. Aroma is reminiscent of oatmeal, cookie doe and toffee on the front with some roasty charcoal on the back.  Taste: Medium high in strength. Roasty, toffeish, caramelly, coffee, cookie doe. Complex enough, although i do find the roasty character a bit too prominent.  Palate: Medium to medium high bitterness. Somewhat acrid. Medium low carbonation. Medium to medium full body. Bittersweet finish with lingering doughie taste. Coating and smooth on the tongue.  Drinkability: Great example of the style: Complex, intriguing, great balance. Excellent on a purely technical level.

Taste: Sweet, malty, creamy, slight bitter roastiness.  Mouthfeel: Not much else like it, smooth and creamy.  Drinkability: High for a stout. Drank it with pizza and hot wings, passed the test.

113,571,Hopfenpeter,4.7,"served in a crystal mug the beer is very dark in color with little light shining trough. The off white to beige head is building nice, but does not stick around to long. Nice lacing. The smell hints the sweetness the label on the bottle predicts. Now the taste of this beer surprises with a perfect balance and smoothness of barley and hops.The oatmeal is certainly recognizable and adds to the smoothness of the beer. Sweet aromas like caramel chocolate , and I swear I taste some apple, dominate in the beginning, until the bitterness of the hops balances the sweetness into a bittersweet beautiful aftertaste, which is just asking for more beer. It is very drinkable and I must say that this beer is one of the best beers I have tasted. Great job!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

I was a little disappointed, as it poured not even a one finger head, but there was good lacing throughout.  The smell of oatmeal is definitely noticeable at first. Other aromas are dark fruit, and a little of the roasted malt.  The taste is excellent. The oatmeal taste isn't very predominant, and instead, I taste a lot of the dark fruit and roasted malt, somewhat reminiscent of a Belgian quad. There is very little bitterness, though it still is pretty well balanced and isn't overly sweet. Its very smooth and velvety, very nice.

The aroma was a combination of sweet malts, molasses, and choclate, and was somewhat subdued. The taste was a complicated mixture of a Belgium Brown, Engligh Mid, and a milk stout. Sweet malts, black strap molasses, plumbs, and a hint of dark roasted coffee made up this complicated brew. Not much esthers, but plenty of character nonetheless. The body was smooth, full, and the finish was a bit dry and satisfying.  A very nice ale, but it does miss the stout category, as the typical roasted malts were very much in the background. If one added some Fuggles and dry hopped Goldings this would make an outstanding Porter. In any event, this is one of finest Dark English Ales one can find no matter what one calls it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Some coffee bean as well. A little mellow.  Taste- Follows the nose, pleasantly. Starts off with a chocolate covered coffee bean. It has a nice sweetness from the oatmeal. Sort of like a coffee ice cream. Has an almost cola finish. It's really pleasant.  Mouthfeel- Nice and rich. Very creamy.  Drinkability- Very easy.  This really is a classic.

Has a definite malty aroma, smell and taste is sweetish fruit, chocolate. Oat flavor is also noticeable and adds a nice dimension to the taste. This is surprisingly refreshing and for a stout I find it less bitter than expected. Would be highly drinkable, has a lower ABV than most stouts at 5%. A bit ""tamer"" than I expected, but still a damn delicious stout, looks pretty too. I would love to try this on tap in England someday.

Tastes sweet and slightly bitter, dark cherry and malty and a little bread, also samuel smith glass, for some reason I taste it in their brews.  Mouthfeel is a minute sticky, complementary low carbonation and a medium small body.  Average drinability, I would recommend a pint to someone who has never had one, drink it warmer it is substantially more complex that way.

Bottle poured into a imperial pint glass gave me a perfect two finger tan colored head that sticks around for a long time. Then it just leaves this sticky lace clinging to the glass. The body of the brew is black as one expects from a stout.  The nose on this brew is good you get some nice roasted coffee and chocolate to it. The flavor is roasted but with a nice sweet molasses note as well. The mouthfeel is thick and full so your mouth feels like you should be chewing this brew. This brew got me into Oatmeal stouts and it sets the standard for me.  I can do two bottle of this at a time but you just get to full from it to do any more.

T: Sweet grains and oats balanced perfectly by roasted malt bitterness and creamy coffee goodness.

It's not the most complex aroma, but it's very pleasing and well done. The taste is sweet through and through. It's not bad but the flavor seems a bit bland. I can detect the dark sweet malts and a slight flavor of oak. It finishes with a bit of a coffee taste. Like I said, it seems bland, maybe subtle is a better word, but this is really an enjoyable drink. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, honestly what I would want from an oatmeal stout.

S: There's a little bit of sweet malt on the nose, but overall this is one of the absolute very least fragrant beers I have smelled, especially for a stout. Totally uninteresting and bland.

I just get burnt malt and a sweet note that well reminds me of an oat meal stout. Clearly I don't eat enough different foods for describing things other than beer.  Big pillowy light tan head. Dark brown body that turns opaque in the glass. Good but not grate lacing, but at this abv what more can you ask?  Interesting example of the style. Opens with a very limited burnt flavor that comes out somewhat dark chocolate like. Then instantly turns overly sweet and finishes somewhat quickly thanks to an oat like flavor. Boring? You bet!  Really creamy and nice mouth feel.  I'm bored. I've had better oatmeal stouts. I've had better porters. I could use some hops or just a bit more bitter in anyway. It's too sweet. It isn't overly strong. This is really that well thought of? I had an Edmund Fitzgerald tonight on draft...5.5% alcohol and 10x more flavor and complexity than this beer could ever hope for.

S- Malty, almost in a boozy way at first, I suspect it to be brown sugar. Also there were bits of coffee and oats.  T- Some oatmeal flavor for the foundation with roasted malts and coffee on top. Comes in sweet and leaves a bitter aftertaste. You can notice hops in the aftertaste about a minute after your sip has been downed. Dark chocolate flavors also come into play after a few sips. All of these flavors seem to work in harmony without overpowering each other. It's not enough to kick this one up to a 5 for me, but I admire the work it must have took to create that balance.  M- INCREDIBLY SMOOTH. Good body, and carbonation is just right.  D- A great all around stout, sadly it's not available where I live, and where it is available, the price is slightly steep, but you get quality for what you pay. Do not pass this one up.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,kbnooshay,3.72,"wtf? I coulda swear i wrote a review for this many moons ago. Hmm anyways, its always nice to come back to this one.  Poured a gorgeous dark brown with a super massive frothy brown colored head, that i can already see is leaving some nice spotted lace. Many describe this brew as being pitch black which it isn't. Its a very dark brown but it certainly lets light through. Has it changed over the years possible?  Aroma is jam packed with oat, vanilla, brown sugar and lotsa roasted malt. There is also some sourness goinh on here, possibly from the yeast.  Taste is similar to the smell, but a nice bitter chocolate flavor kicks in with lots of deep roasted malt flavor.  Feel is creamy but not as thick as i remember. Light carbonation.  Not bad, but not what i remember from past tastings.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,tewaris,4.46,"OG? IBUs? 550 ml bottle with no freshness date poured into a Surly pint glass.  Appearance 5/5 Pours clear dark brown that looks black in the glass with deep brown highlights. Big, creamy, dense and rocky head that's like a Belgian ale's in all respects but its dark tan color. The persistent head leaves sticky lacing on the glass over the course of the beer.  Aroma 4/5 Big on roast, bordering on a charred character. Some grainy undertones. Perhaps powdered chocolate. This one is hard to say, but there might be some earthy hop aroma too.  Taste 4.5/5 Light malty sweetness in the beginning and middle, complemented by coffee like acidity that's perhaps from the roast, followed by a moderate bitterness from the hops, and then a moderately dry and roasty finish. A grainy character from oatmeal is certainly notable, but not prominent. The aftertaste is like dark chocolate in terms of some sweetness and decent bitterness. Hop flavor, if present, is very little.  Mouthfeel 4/5 Medium body with moderate carbonation, just the way it should be. Not cloying. However, it doesn't feel as silky as I expected.  Drinkability 5/5 Very very good. At 5% ABV, you can knock down a couple of pints of this flavorful dark ale.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,optimistictour,4.45,"I must preface this by saying that although my sinuses are a bit waylaid by a cold right now I've had the beer many times before, and know it smells great. Basically, my smell score is based upon memory. As for the rest...  Well it looks great, exactly as a stout should: dark with a tan head, it's got a trace of transparency and a moderate two-or more fingers of head so I know it won't overwhelm the tastebuds (or liver).  Smell is another above average area. This one truly fits the bill as hints of hearty oatmeal and a vague sense of coffee.. or at least a breakfast atmosphere, pervade.  It tastes just great. Seriously. There's a reason this one is so widely known and often serves as a gateway to the world of stouts for the uninitiated. Dark and filling, distinctively welcoming on the tongue. It's got a moderate amount of carbonation for the style which really adds to the texture.  It feels like velvet going down, not quite the dreamy black oil some of my favorite stouts resemble but an entirely enjoyable alternative. That carbonation really is what makes it a better gateway for those stuck in boring-beer-land. Tickles the tongue and gets those taste buds working to truly feel this beer out.  As for drinkability: it's only 5% and a bomber or two wouldn't necessarily knock you down. It'll fill your stomach and satisfy with both flavor and feel in a large way before overwhelming with any alcohol sensation. A truly sessionable beer. Or a prelude to harder stuff...",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

The taste has lots of oatmeal up front with light coffee and chocolate hints. A bit of bitterness and nuts in the finish with some molasses again coming out.

Behind that is a lightly roasted profile with raisin and molasses with a hint of cocoa.  (T)- Very similar to the smell. Far more creamier and chocolate-like than led to believe. A smooth molasses and cocoa profile with a touch of roasted raisin and dry bread. Let it warm up if chilled; it only got better as it warmed up.  (M)- A good carbonation level and balance.

A well-balanced mix of roasted coffee and toasted oats with a bittersweet chocolate finish.  M: Slightly chewy with a small amount of carbonation.

T: Slight peppery taste and very heavy, with yeast/bread being quite prominent. Bitter notes are present but subtle. It's one of the smoothest beers I've tasted, with no ""bite"" or sting that higher ABV beers have. Lingering tastes are slightly bitter in the back of my mouth, but these slowly develop into a mild sweetness that is quite pleasant. As the beer has a chance to breathe, the flavors become a lot more mild and delicate, with the most prominent being licorice. Overall, the lasting impression and the most prominent aftertaste is that of a rather potent piece of sourdough bread.  M: Hearty like a good stout should be.

Clear for a stout, what you can see through is a beautiful cherry color. Under a light brown head that seems to be having trouble holding up in my glass. Smells of chocolate and dark sweet malt.

113,571,yuenglingfan101,4.95,Wonderful beer. Looks good. Not bad at all. Smells like oatmeal and of course it taste like oatmeal. Mouthful well it isn't the best but close to it. Drinkability is wonderful. I could drink a few of these and and enjoy its wonderful taste over and over again. I would recommend this beer to anyone.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,jrallen34,4.13,"Tick, tick, tick.  A dark brown pout with a light tan head. About three fingers of head, very creamy looking, fluffy, good retention and lacing....a very strong aroma that hits me once the cap is off, very malty, mostly sweet chocolate with a hint of vanilla on the finish, pretty good, lacks depth...The taste is more of the same, mostly malty but overpowering or to sweet. Light coffee finish rounds this off. A fuller feel than most English beers. Easy to drink.  This is tasty, and abover average in all aspects, however I'm just not super impressed. I'd probably have again but can't strongly recommend it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Not quite as intense as most of its American counterparts, but pleasant.  Toasted oat taste, nuts, chocolate, and some coffee hints. Fairly full and balanced.  Really creamy on the mouthfeel with soft carbonation. Excels in this category.  Solid stout, not quite one of the best but good.

113,571,billab914,4.38,"Poured from a 550ml bottle into my Portsmouth tulip. Poured dark brown in color with a thick tan head to it. The head kept a nice covering on top of the beer as I drank it and left some excellent lacing as well.  The aroma has a smooth oat and chocolate flavor to it. It's not overly complex or extreme, but it's a very solid and appealing flavor.  The taste shows a big oat flavor to it that is similar to an oatmeal cookie. It has a roasty and rich milk chocolate flavor to it as well that is very nice. Pretty balanced with sweet and bitter in the finish. I typically love oatmeal stouts, and they really don't get much better then this.  The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is very good for me. I love the oat flavors and what it adds to the mouthfeel. Excellent beer overall and pretty much a benchmark for the style for me personally.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,mikesgroove,4.68,"I am sorry but this has to be one of the best beers ever made. A staple of my early craft years, I had long forgotten how good it was. I picked up a bottle on the local shelf on my way home tonight and cracked it open after dinner, poured into a pint glass and consumed on 08/13/2010.  Perfect dark brown color with a creamy tan head that reached about an inch up the side of the glass and had incredible retention. One of the best looking beers of any style I have ever seen, looking at it now some twenty minutes in the thick coating all along the glass is immense.  Aroma is sweet roasted malts, oasts, chocolate, rich an creamy caramel and vanilla. So full and rich, with a creaminess to the feel that is unmatched in the style. Each sip starts with a smooth, almost mousse like feel across the tongue, which evolves into rich chocolate and incredible depth of roasted malts. Light touches of hops come across on the finish giving it the slightest hint of bitterness in the finish before the final taste of sweet malts wrings itself out across the palate.  Overall it really does not get better then this, the hallmark people should strive for.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ChrisCage,4.51,"A- Poured this into my English ale pint glass and am immediately impressed. I was greeted by a cola dark colored brew that had a four inch thick head that is almond/tan in color. It also carries thick, very sticky lacing that clumps in pillow like fashion on the glass. It eventually settles into a puffy cloud on top of the brew. Very nice indeed!  S- A very toasty aroma, full of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, caramel, and rich earthiness. There is some dry cocoa hints that must be coming from the use of the oatmeal, because this doesn't smell as sweet as a standard stout normally does to me. There is a subtle hop bitterness at the end that smells fresh and leafy.  T- The flavors are a fair bit sweeter than the aroma lets on. The bitter chocolate flavors come through very nicely, followed by fresh brewed coffee tones....the bitterness of these flavors are balanced by some rich malty sweetness. It gets bitter again during the swallow, right at the back of the throat, but it's not a hop bitterness, it's more cocoa-ish.  M- Full bodied best describes this beer, and the carbonation is low and reasonably fine. This makes for a creamy texture that reminds me of the consistancy of what hot chocolate would be. The dry bitterness keeps my palate with these flavors long after the swallow, and I find get better, wanting me to enjoy another drink.  D- This is a very drinkable stout! It's a wonderful example of the style and the enhanced bitterness really drives home the roasty character of the beer. The alcohol is of course well hidden, as it should be, is rich and creamy smooth. Anyone who likes a good English style stout will love this beer!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,2DaMtns,3.53,"I don't have a lot to add to this that hasn't already been said. In all, it's a good beer, but I was underwhelmed.

The head is a light brown color, which stays around for the whole of the drink, and leaves some nice lacing. Not over the top, an understated, subtle, coffee and mocha smell, with a bit of chocolate and cola.

Slight dark copper reddish-brown hues on the edges when held up to the light. Nice frothy, foamy 1"" cream colored head that slowly settles into a thin layer on the top that stays for the duration. Beautiful lacing. Leaving rings at every stop on the way down the glass.  N- Very roasty, malty aroma. Hints of bittersweet chocolate, coffee and caramel. perhaps a bit of hops detected underneath all that malty sweetness.As the beer warms to room temp, smell of chocolate becomes much more prominent. Almost like that of melty semi-sweet morsels.  T- Getting fresh roasted coffee. Then dark chocolateflavor that turns to bittersweet choc. Definite bitter taste as I swallow my mouthful down. A blend of bitter from both the roasted malts and the hops on the back end.  M- Smooth and creamy. Almost a 'slick' feel about it. Not too heavy for a stout, and the carbonation it has helps it dance across my tongue. Coats the back of the throat on the swallow.  D- A fabulous stout, for sure. The fact that it is relatively light for a stout,and has decent carbonation make this one a good session beer in my eyes. Years ago my cousin(also a Beer Advocate)bought me one of these on Thanksgiving. It turned me into a person who ""dug"" good beer. First taste of stout. Haven't had it in a while, and this is the first time I've drunk it and really thought about the flavor profiles in it with the intention of a review.

Sweet smelling chocolate and malts.  T - Mmmmm mmmm boy is that delicious. Everything is prevalent; the chocolate, malts, coffee taste.

That said, I liked the look of the former, so of course I like the look of this one.  Smells quite nice - again, it's a lot like the IS, but the smoke smell is more pronounced.  Tastes very good - I'm getting a really good balance between the chocolate and lemon flavors. It's also a bit grassy, and a little hoppy afterward.  It's medium-bodied, with good carbonation and a lemony aftertaste.  To drinkability - quite a bit similar to the IS, but I liked this one just a wee bit better.

Thick, with powerful roasted malts all over the place. There's also definite dark chocolate notes...with a bit of tanginess that I would categorize as a licorice character. A small bitterness is noted on the backend. Mouthfeel is pretty thin for style, however.  I didn't remember this beer as being as full flavored as it is.

113,571,bigrzman,4.83,This is by far my favorite beer of all time. Since I had my first one at Smoking Joe's many years ago I am truly in love with this beer.  A: A nice tar like Stout color with a rich tawny head seemingly juxtaposed to the dark body. There is almost no carbonation visible in the beer at all adding to its smooth mouth feel. The head lingers on as it is being enjoyed.  S: It smells of oatmeal living up to its name. It also has a strong roasted characteristic. You can also smell the stone that it was brewed in.  T: Malty and roasted. There are hints of coffee in the overall Chuck Norris kick of oats. You can also taste the stone that it was brewed in.  M: The word smooth is the one that dominates.It is thick and coating. It goes down and warms the soul as it brings satisfaction to the taste buds.  D:It will go down smooth and is surprisingly not as heavy as it looks. It is appropriate in the winter as it is in the summer.

Smell: A light oatmeal note is present in the aroma, under a big chocolate and caramel malt smell that is also accented by some dark fruits, a hint of coffee, and a slight hop note.  Taste: The front of the tongue is a sweet/salty oatmeal taste that is more dominant than in the smell, which gives way to a wallop of chocolate malts and a small fruity taste and finishes up with a coffee note and a lingering bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium with low carbonation and absolutely velvety smooth.  Drinkability: Very drinkable and not very filling. Leaves you wanting another sip.

113,571,jporf911,3.83,"Poured from a 550ml (1 pint, 2.7oz) bottle into a standard glass. No freshness date provided. The back label shows a man beating down what appears to be an entire vat full of fluffy, foamy yeast head. That's a good sign.  Appearance- 4.5 out of 5. Very dark, almost opaque, rich black with a fluffy tan two-finger head that has admirable retention, lasting almost the entire time as I drank it. The lacing is thick and sticks everywhere.  Smell- 4 out of 5. The scent is surprisingly soft and mild for a beer this dark. It mainly reminds me of molasses with a nutty undertone.  Taste- 4 out of 5. This is a bold flavor with a strong, powerful taste of roasted dark malt, nuts, unsweetened chocolate, and coffee. There are earthy and woody undertones that are almost acrid in their bite. The eponymous oatmeal is evident and adds a rich bit of starchiness. The dark fruit and slight pear flavor is lost in the stronger flavors mentioned before. It's a very robust taste that can be intimidating to drinkers unaccustomed to Stouts, so be careful.  Mouthfeel- 4 out of 5. The body is thick; the carbonation is strong; and the finish is dry. Very full and filling.  Drinkability- 3 out of 5. This stuff is good, but I wouldn't want more than the bottle (which gives about 2 glasses once poured).",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

It smells and tastes of toasted malts...smoky sweet, if that makes any sense...to stout drinkers it certainly does. The taste leaves a bitter aftertaste even after warming up a bit. The bar I had this at served it a bit too cold.  The body is medium and has a silky mouthfeel due to the oatmeal. No nitrogen here to keep the carbonation active, the bubbles are natural.  A typical stout from the British Isles, not very heavy and light on the alcohol. Classic!

Color is dark brown with dark red highlights when held up to light. After an aggressive pour I am left with a massive tan head that settles at 1 finger. Looks solid the whole time and leaves some nice lacing.  Scents I can pick up are grain, oats, cream, Irish Dry Stout-esque. There is also some sour and hop notes.  Tastes are much better than the smell. I still get a Irish Dry Stout vibe, but this is much more flavorful. Oats, chocolate, light hops. Oatmeal cookie and brownie crumbs. Some light fruit and a bit of earthiness. Really nice when it starts to warm up. Lots of flavor and body for a 5% beer. Nice sweetness and nuttiness on the finish.

113,571,SteelerChris,4.23,"This is one of my favorite beers and beer styles. Most of the other reviews hit the nail right on the head with the description of its richness straight out of the bottle. The color is a very dark brown and the head is strong and stays frothy throughout the drinking experience. The aroma is nutty and smells like fresh brownies. The taste is smooth and velvety with a medium body. You can expect flavors of coffee, fortified dark fruits, roasted figs, touch of caramel, and of course cooked oats with a swirl of brown sugar. The carbonation is noticeable while the mouth feel is not too overwhelming and the alcohol is not noticed unless you have more than 4. I prefer to drink this slightly below room temperature, because if too cold you will not get the nutty and creamy flavors. There is a brilliant balance of gusto because you can differentiate the singular essences of hops, chocolate, coffee, and etcetera alone, but they are harmonious with one another on the palate. I usually drink this beer alone or with hearty foods, but I have been experimenting with paring beer and dessert. For this review I decided to pair this beer with Camembert. I wrapped Camembert with puff pastry and blackberry compote and baked it until crispy the drizzled a balsamic/strawberry reduction over it. These rich fruity flavors complimented the beer nicely and brought out a new level sweetness and roundness to this brew and I am very happy with the outcome. I hope others will try this pairing. It really shines the beer in a new light.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Taste - Rich dark roasted malts with an amazing smokiness. The oats and toffee finish it off oh so nicely.  Mouthfeel - The carbonation and full body of this creamy smooth gift from the beer gods are balanced out just right.  Drinkability - I love it!!!

Good balance between bitter and sweet. Dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and toffee swirl around giving the Oatmeal Stout.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth and creamy with a medium-full body.

Smell: Creamy coffee and chocolate. A little bit of bitter and roasted smell. Deliciously aromatic.  Taste: Pretty strong chocolate and roasted malt flavors. Milky sweetness comes next with some very slight hop bitterness at the back. Coffee and roasted bitterness emerges toward the end leaving a somewhat dry finish with maybe a hint of woodiness.

The label art is starting to feel a bit dated. A refresh might be in order.  Appearance: Almost ink black. It evidences deep red highlights. It has a beautiful creamy 1"" head that never quite disappears, and it leaves a modest trail of clingy lacing down the glass.  Aroma: Dark malt twang, earthy, sweat, with a hint of oats. Mild.  Taste: Delicious but subdued. The soft roasted malt flavor hangs in the foreground, eventually giving way to a mild, earthy sweetness. Towards the end, there is a sort of milky taste -- similar to oatmeal. The hop bitterness is minimal in the finish. Dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and toffee swirl around giving the Oatmeal Stout an inexplicably nourishing and full flavor towards the end.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth and creamy with a medium-full body. The carbonation adds just the right amount of zing in the finish.  Harmony: I am a big fan of this stout. It's very mild and subdued, but that doesn't imply a lack of complexity. Drinking it is calming, but at the same time, I can appreciate the many flavor combinations. The ""oatmeal"" aspect to the stout comes through quite nicely (though not as obviously as I would have assumed).  Bottled on: December 2009 (5 months ago) Price: ?

The head stuck around for a good while and them faded down to a good looking cap of foam. Clumps of sticky lace clung to the sides of the glass. The aroma is sweet malts, roasted barley, a clean bitterness, a touch of chocolate, and a light mineral note in the background. The taste of the beer is excellent. Roasted barley and light coffee tones lead, mixed with sweet malts, bittersweet chocolates, clean bitterness, and a light coffee aftertaste. The feel of this beer is silky and smooth, rich, luxurious and filling. As my cousin put it, ""like drinking some birthday cake.""

Flavor is very good with lots of great roasted malt, caramel, and chocolate.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and super smooth. The oatmeal definately helps in that respect.

Roasted chocolate and toffee malts smell absolutely delicious. Not hoppy, but with a discernable bitterness. Looks fantastic, time to drink!  Taste: Delicious, but much stronger on the chocolate/smoky flavors than I got from the nose. Medium-low level of carbonation and a reasonably thick body make this more of a sipper, but I almost like that better for this decadent brew.  Drinkability: There's a robust mouth coating that leaves one wanting for another sip, and I'm seeing the glass disappear pretty quickly.

Finishes with a pronounced mineral/stony/slate flavor, probably from the squares & local water.  M, D- Creamy and extracted. Neither thin & fully dry, nor sweet & sticky.

Interestingly, this beer looks English.  S: Liquid baker's chocolate laced with vanilla, and a touch of milk chocolate. Nearly smells like an Ice Cream shop, or a bowl of high quality chocolate gelato. Some highly roasted malts hide underneath all the chocolate. A wonderful nose...  T: Smooth, rich, soft, and mellow. Those are the first four adjectives that come to mind when thinking of the flavor of this beer. Chocolate and roasted malts celebrate matrimony in an inspiring way. Vanilla and the slightest bit of oak show up to join the party along the way, and the whole experience dies slowly away in wonderful mellow-but-rich aftertaste of dark roast barley, chocolate, oats, and hints of coffee grounds.  M: Possibly the most full bodied session beer I have ever tasted. Smooth, velvety, coat the mouth excellence. This is the first '5' I have ever awarded for any category for any beer. Wonderful, sweet, subtle, complex and thick without being overly heavy or sticky.  D: Astounding drinkability... one of the greatest session stouts ever brewed.

Like foamy coffee overall. Excellent lacing!  Smell: Lots of chocolate and coffee malts. The perfect mixture of these two elements in my opinion. Could be better if the smell didn't dissipate at the end.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Pleasant taste. Again, chocolate malts with a strong coffee presence. Not too strong overall though. Good taste! Very smooth as well, but not that thick, so that explains it a bit.  Drinkability: Filling and more difficult to drink as you finish. That's the only bad part.

I pointed out the mix-up hoping to get a free a nut brown ale. Instead I watched him dump it down the drain. :( So anyway he hands me the bottle with no glass. I ask for a glass he brings out a frozen one. :( Didn't matter, this beer would be good if it were served on a plate.  Poured black with a big brown head.  Aroma was mostly sweet and malty with maple syrup scents floating around. As with most stouts chocolate and coffee were there as well.  The taste had more character than most other stouts. The usual cocoa and espresso are there along with roasted nuts, dark fruits and oats.  This stout was light and sweet. The low abv is a plus as well.

Roasted barley and burnt coffee are the main components of the aroma, along with a little fig and nutty characters. Flavor starts with a dry roastyness that moves into some dark fruit and molasses. A touch of bitter coffee lingers on the finish. Mouthfeel is the weak link with this beer for me - thin and overcarbonated, to the point of being bubbly. Would be decent if it was a porter, but there's little, if any indication in the body that oatmeal is used in this beer.

Head dynamics are pretty good, and it leaves some lacing on the glass. I don't know about carbonation.  Aroma is a little weak. There is a mild roast to the aroma, disturbing the beer produces some more, its smells fine, its just small.  Beer is medium bodied and has a great flavor to it. I can't taste the oatmeal as much as some other beers but it gives it good body. Nice roast in the back. There is nice connectivity in the palate but not a lot of carbonation in the mouth.

113,571,feelmefoam,4.33,"Pours a dark, opaque brown that reminds me of pouring just-brewed coffee into a mug. Appears black in the glass, but has some mahogany-brown highlights when held up to the light. Put up a nice, thick, tan-colored head that rose to about an inch-and-a-half in height and had some really nice retention. Leaves a good amount of thick lacing down the glass.  The nose has some really nice elements to it, but isn't quite as aromatic as I'd like. Still, I can clearly pick out chocolate, black coffee, brown sugar, and a bit of sweetness that I think I can attribute to the oatmeal.  The flavor is a bit better than the nose in that it's a bit more full and assertive. Coffee and brown sugar show up at first, with maybe just a bit of chocolate, but not nearly as much as I would've expected from the nose. This isn't a bad thing, just different. The oatmeal comes in at the end, quiet at first but makes a bit more noise as the beer warms a bit. It works well with the brown sugar that's going on in the forefront of the flavor. Maybe a little bit of toasted bread flavor going on towards the very end of the draught.  Medium-heavy body with a noticeable amount of carbonation and a very slightly dry finish. I would've maybe used a little less carbonation to make the beer a bit creamier, but it's certainly not bad.  Overall this is a very drinkable beer and a good one for my first oatmeal stout. At only 5% ABV and packing a good amount of flavor, you can definitely enjoy the whole 1 pint, 2.7 fl oz bottle in one sitting without regretting it later. Pretty good stuff from Sammy Smith's.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

There is nothing incredibly notable about it, but it's exactly what one would expect from the style.  S: Even halfway through the glass, I don't pick up much on the nose but some muted sweetness.  T: Here's where this beer absolutely shines (it's amazing how much great taste there is compared to the non-existent smell). Very nice milk chocolate and some black coffee at first, and an oat aftertaste that is notable in its strength. Delicious.  M: A bit more carbonated than most beers of this style. When sipped in the way that stouts usually are, this beer can begin to make you feel rather heavy due to the level of carbonation being unusually high.  D: That being said, the taste is the most important factor in any beer and it will keep you coming back for more until the glass is empty.

The head is phenominal, with a chocolate cream feel. Lots of carbonation makes for a slow, even pour. Very inviting, almost intrigueing...makes you want to know ""What's this taste like?"" Defenitly a winning start.  Nose - Smell is very organic and nutty. Hints of coffee and chocolate and even alittle piney, but not overpowering for a Stout. There is a definite sweetness to this. Not bursting with aroma, but just enough to keep you interested.  Taste - First sip - WOW! This is how beer should taste. Starts with a smooth toffee blast, mixed with dark chocolate and mellows to the sweetness caught in the nose and follows through with notes of banana, butter and more coffee as it warms. The end of the glass tastes better than the beginning - I will have the next one closer to room temperature.  Mouth - Smooth and surprisingly light for an Oatmeal stout. The only downside is a tinge of overcarbonation - but this also adds to a flavorfull burst once it hits the tongue.  Drinkability - Defenitly one of my favorite beers.

Smell - A good amount of roasted malts with sweet chocolate and espresso beans notes. Some creamy oats and a sweet scent. A touch of dark fruits (raisins, prunes). Very intriguing.  Taste - This is extremely well-balanced and flavourful! Starts out with some serious roasted coffee bean notes and milk chocolate, followed by an exceptional creaminess from the oats. Yum, as good as I remember. The after-taste is slightly roasted and bitter-sweet, with a tiny bit of burnt malts.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied, with some moderate carbonation. Exceptionally smooth, even creamy. The alcohol is not present at all.  Drinkability - It goes down very smoothly and doesn't get boring and not overwhelming. This is one of the best stouts out there, and nothing is really compromised in this beer.

S - A good amount of roasted malts (but not over-roasted), with sweet chocolate and espresso beans notes. Some creamy oats, some floral notes. A touch of dark fruits (sultana raisins, prunes). Very intriguing.  T - Wow, this is extremely well-balanced and flavourful! Starts out with some serious roasted coffee bean notes and milk chocolate, followed by an exceptional creaminess from the oats. Then you get some bitterness and sourness. The after-taste is slightly roasted and bitter-sweet, with a tiny bit of burnt malts. This definitely beats the other oatmeal stouts I've had!  M - Medium-bodied, with some moderate carbonation. Exceptionally smooth, even creamy. The alcohol is not present at all.  D - It goes down very smoothly and doesn't get boring not overwhelming.

Head stayed around til the last drop.  S: Roasted toffee, coffee, some sweetness like caramel too.  T: Dark roasted coffee, unsweetened chocolate mostly, and the oatmeal is nice at the end. Very tasty.  M: Medium-bodied and smooth and creamy with slight carbonation. Slightly chewy.  D: Damn good oatmeal stout.

S - Dark and milk chocolate along with some espresso and coffee notes. Some roasted malts, oats, nuts, and other earthy flavors. Some sugar smell too, more sweet/less roasted than many other stouts.  T - Similar to the smell. A good amount of oat and grain taste, with a slight roasted taste. This goes along with an earthy taste. Good amount of chocolate and some coffee taste. Also a good amount of molasses/brown sugar. Slight herbal towards the finish. Ends with a definite oat taste, almost oat cookie like.  M - Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Very silky and smooth. A fair amount of chewiness, but not quite as much as I was expecting from an oatmeal stout.  D - Very good drinkability. Smooth and goes down easy but also has a full mouthfeel. The taste is nice and doesn't overpower. A bit of sweetness and bitterness. A good amount of oat taste.  Notes: Very nice beer that isn't as bitter as some other stouts but it has a good stout taste. Full oat taste, with a little roasted flavors, but not a lot of roasted taste. Good for a session or for a slightly special occasion.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Smelled of beautifully roasted coffee beans, hints of dark cacoa, ild hops, and sweetness. The beer tasted much the same, being really smooth with no hints of booziness or bitterness. Full bodied, not too thick, yet very rich and delicious. Tops.  Drinkability is superb.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,TitanTake,4.33,"I had purchased 2 other Samuel Smith beers recently (Taddy Porter and Nut Brown Ale) and loved them both. So, I had to give this one a try.  A - extremely dark, chocolate color; nice creamy coffee colored head; head lasted and didn't dissipate immediately; nice lacing  S - heavy charcoal aroma; small hint of flowers; also a nice dark chocolate aroma underlying  T - strong charcoal with hops within; slightly burnt flavor; bitter, but to the point of wanting more  M - immediately fills the mouth with more of a meal than a drink; thick; slightly effervescent  D - This is the beer drinkers beer; if you like the darker side of the beer world, then this has to be in your bank of beers.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,VaTechHopHead,3.96,"A - Typical dark brown, non-transparent but had a very frothy and thick medium tan head which left quite a bit of lacing.  S - The aroma is quite mellow for me and has a lot more oatmeal scent than expected. It almost drowns out all the dark malt and chocolately/roasted undertones normally associated with a good stout. Just a faint whiff of the hops bitterness towards the end.  T - Again, the oatmeal makes its presence quite early but doesn't overpower all the specialty malts. The combination of oatmeal and whatever grain bill is used is very smooth, sweet, and leaves just a hint of roasted barely in the aftertaste. Hops not really noticeable in this brew to me.  M/D - Had a lighter body than I would have imagined for a stout but it was still well carbonated so that it was smooth and creamy on the palate. Finishes a little on the sweet side since there's not much trace of hops and very clean after you swallow.

I have had this beer before about 2 years ago and didn't like it, well this is a testament to my palette growing over time. THIS IS MIGHTY TASTY.

113,571,Arbitrator,4.15,"Chilled bottle into a glass. I almost never buy this anymore, but after someone put it back on my radar, I went ahead and got a bottle.  A: Pours a nearly opaque, brown body in the glass with delicate ruby translucence around the edges. The head is a frothy tan cap that leaves some nice lacing down the sides.  S: Chocolate, coffee, molasses, and a definite grain note. What surprises me is that there's a very definite vanilla aroma to this.  T: Dark chocolate, light coffee, and molasses. Caramel and a definite grain / bread note that reminds me altogether of bread pudding. Again, the vanilla I picked up in the nose is very noticeable here. It's a bit mystifying; I thought vanilla flavors are usually imparted through vanilla beans or barrel character. Does yeast really produce this flavor? If so, it's very impressive. It rounds out an already tasty brew.  M: I won't lie; this is on the thin side for a stout, just shy of medium-bodied. The carbonation is medium as well. However, it scores big points for packing its tremendous flavor in such a light body. It's just really, really tasty for 5%.  D: Extremely drinkable. I've been overlooking beers like these since I got seriously into craft in late 2008. It's nice to revisit them on a trained palate and re-evaluate them. This? This is great.

It smelled slightly sweet and chocolaty with a hint of coffee. It was very smooth, sweet, and bold. It's ""oatmeal"" label made the oat-taste stand out in my mind, but the flavor was filled mostly with coffee, chocolate, and perhaps some kind of herb like rosemary perhaps. There wasn't much carbonation and had a nice malty finish. As far as stouts go, this one is pretty good.

Appearance: Very dark brown - almost lets no light through but you can make out the color if you hold it up to the light. Pours a huge thick head that dies down to 1/8"" across the top. Lots of lacing as I drank it down.  Smell: In the bottle I got yeasty bread. In the glass I got some faint roasted smells...I think the title of the beer is making me think I smell oatmeal but it's breadlike with some yeasty notes. Not very strong either way but as it warms up, yep, I'm definitely getting oats, like dry oatmeal in the bowl before you add something to cook it up.  Taste: Some hints of bittersweet chocolate, molasses, and a slight metallic finish, although as it warms up that metallic finish gets replaced with a bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Amazingly creamy and smooth. Thick and goes down nice. Just a hint of carbonation on the tongue.  Drinkability: This is good, but I think I must have it with a meal. This isn't a beer (for me anyway) for just drinking by itself, but it does go well with a meal (burger and fries in this case).",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Drinkability: Certainly easy to drink, but the metal doesn't help.  Picked up a Sam Smith sampler pack to get another one of their great pint glasses and do some reviews.

Aroma: pleasantly lactic with a slightly burnt, toasted finish--but mostly a welcoming aroma... Palate: smooth and soft; inoffensive in its presence and ever inviting of another sip; approaches the smoothness of a milk stout, butmaintains a backbone... Taste: lactic and velvety, an appealing taste that fulfills both the front and back of the mouth; enough smoke to round it out with weight... Overall: Samuel Smith will always have a place in my glass--and this is the third sampler I 've got (thanks Jer), so I've got some extras--and revisiting this classic is a pleasant reminder of how nice drinking a beer can be: tasty, classy, relaxing and reinvigorating a New Year's Eve drag simultaneously.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

The taste starts with a roasted flavor and finishes smooth with some caramel notes. I don't find this beer overly sweet at all. It isn't hoppy, but instead is well balanced like any English ale should be. I just drove twenty miles to find this beer and it is so smooth and well worth it. No American beer can match it.

S - Nice robust malty sweetness with some roasted character and nice chocolaty hints. Oat cereal hints are present and smooth out the roasted and burnt character for the malt.  T - Very smooth! Nice delicious roasted malt that is smoothed out by the oat character. Some mild vanilla spice rounds out a very complex and delicious beer. Some sweet caramel hints are present as well. There is some nice milky character to it similar to a Sweet Stout. True to the style description and an extremely delicious stout. Some nice bitterness at the ends makes an appearance but is not very overwhelming.  M - Smooth and medium-heavy body with a nice CO2 profile. Perfectly crafted.

Some ripe raisins with a slightly roasty roundness. There is a prominent high note that's slightly cereally and biscuity.  Taste: Creamy and smooth in a notable way, even for a stout.. Roasted and caramelized malts lay a rich foundation for syrupy, plumy goodness. While the finish is quite sweet, this stout perfectly balances sweetness and dryness like a slightly sweetened iced coffee...though the creaminess makes it more like an iced latte even. Subtle overtones of caramel round things out and a slightly citrusy, banana edge adds interest. As the beer warms some grain husk bitterness comes through, but its pleasant.  Notes: Balance, subtlety, and multidimensional grains make this a winner.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,AmberMan22,4.6,"Pours out a dark mahogany brown, a cookie-dough colored head.  Smell is kind of laid back, but there's definitely oatmeal, some chocolate malt, molasses?  The taste certainly lives up to it's reputation. Oatmeal stouts are one of my favorite styles, and this takes the crowned position right now. Served chilled but not cold made this perfect. Oatmeal and a dry smokiness come forward, balanced perfectly by chocolatey malts. A touch of sweetness is evident too, not sure what to call it though.  Mouthfeel seems perfect, plenty of heft and stick to it, not overly carbonated. Also good because it's not too heavy, like some stouts aim to be.

No fruitiness or hop aroma to speak of  T: begins with that same fresh bread that is in the smell. moves to a nice malty sweetness (coffee with cream) , followed by the roast character. The beer finishes with a roast character that gives the perception of dryness but there is some residual sweetness that creeps back in. There is not oatmeal flavor present, but as the style suggest its presence rounds out the flavors of the beer which, in my opinion, has definitely happened here.  M: medium-full body, silky smooth but with a slick feel from the oatmeal  D: exceptional on this beer. The flavor is so well put together, it is complex but not overwhelming, the oats do an amazing job or rounding everything out.

113,571,BillyBoysPie,4.5,"From a bottle into an imperial pint glass. It fits! (I knew it would, it was just too much fun to resist.)  A rich dark mahogany that is approaching black. I'm getting excited. Dense lacing.  Chocolate, toast, a hint of vanilla, and a little bit of (french roast?) coffee. Well rounded, the chocolate hints of lactose, but it clearly isn't a milk stout.  Slightly sweet chocolate, warm toasts, hints of vanilla and milk, and not overdone coffee. A hint of bitter on the aftertaste, but it's pleasantly dominated by pale toffee and vanilla. Incredibly pleasing and delicious.  Creamy and velvety in the mouth, carbonation is light enough to not interfere with the body, but still keeps it refreshing.  Delicious beer, would go great with a range of food: Roasted meats, BBQ, smoked fare, chocolate desserts, truffles, ice creams. Well rounded and refreshing example of good, quality beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Josievan,4.35,"Appearance: The color is a dark brown with deep red flashes thrown in at the bottom of the glass. There's a soft tan head, and the lingering foam becomes more of a wall than lacing.  Smell: Sweet oatmeal is prominent, with underlying roasted malts.  Taste: Lots of namesake oatmeal, with a tad bit of maple syrup sweetness. Finish is sweet as well, with only a hint of bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy, with a medium body. Just enough carbonation to keep things lively.  Drinkability: Despite lots of flavor and a full body, it doesn't weigh you down at all. An utterly drinkable stout.  Notes: Well, I'm finally getting around to reviewing Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout. It was the first Sam Smith beer I had and the first oatmeal stout I had. It remains my favorite oatmeal stout, and is one of the standouts in Samuel Smith's excellent arsenal of beers.

Lacing is somewhat sparse as it seems to roll down the glass with the carbonation.  S: Mostly roasted malt with a hint of sweetness. Maybe a slight hint of coffee that's normally associated with dark beers.  T: Smooth, smooth and more smooth. You get that roasted malt you can smell followed by some sweetness and then a bitter touch at the end. Really well balanced in my opinion.  M: This beer has great body, it's the kind of body I want in a stout. It fills your mouth but doesn't feel heavy going down. Carbonation is ample and tingles your mouth.  D: I really enjoy this stout. It's very drinkable and in many ways nearly perfect.

113,571,ThePortlander,4.35,"Straight from the 550ml bottle into an imperial pint glass, allowed to warm to the proper temperature.  On pouring, my first impression was how thick and jet-black this beer is, like oil. The head is considerably thick, leaving a nice ring on the side of the glass as the beer is consumed.  The nose on this one is what I expected: dark malts, coffee, sticky-sweetness, and a slight earthy edge. It wasn't quite as strong as I was hoping, but the flavor was in no way reflective. The beer is chewey enough as far as body goes, but still easy, and light on the palate, drying as it leaves. At first, there's a rush of molassesy, chocolaty goodness, but it's balanced by the earthiness mentioned earlier. As it sits, the earthy flavor melds with hints of coffee in the back of the mouth. The one thing missing is creaminess, which I really makes or breaks a stout for me.  A great stout, needless to say. I find, however, that one of these is plenty (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), so it gets a 4 on drinkability. Likewise, there could be more heft, and more creaminess to the beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Very pleaseing  M: Higher side of medium body but not heavy for full. Very smooth with a mild viscosity.  D: Awesome, could drink this all day.

113,571,Jwale73,3.98,"550ml bottle served in my Sam Smith nonic. Poured a deep, rich brown, almost black in complexion with some ruby highlights around the base of the glass. Head is dense and frothy (almost nitrous-like) and tan in color. As the head sizzles and pops and slowly collapses, it exposes a pockmarked surface and thin sticky webs of lacing as it settles into a solid half inch cap. Malty nose with the suggestion of coca, brown sugar and flaked oats. Taste consistent with nose; however, I get a little milky sweetness in the mix (perhaps some lactic acid) and a slightly metallic quality that comes out at the back. Body is light-medium, a bit on the thin side and a little watery, but goes down very smooth as the carbonation is very even and subtle. I tend to like a little more mouthfeel in my oatmeal stouts; however, this is a very pleasant and sessionable brew.

113,571,Kylito87,2.93,1st beer of 2010 I just came across my notes that I had stashed on a flash drive. This is the beer I drank at exactly mid-night to ring in the new year!Also my first Oatmeal Stout Heres We Goes.  Appearance- Almost ink black with a tawny head. It is actually a deep chestnut reddish color if held up to the light. Very sticky lacing that clings in clumps on my glass.  Smell= Smells like grandma's cookies! It has a sweet kick at first but then you pick up notes of dark roasted malt and slight cocoa notes. No noticeable hop aroma.  Taste- It tastes alot like it smells. It is very malty and roasty tasting with a very persistant sweetness. The sweetness seems to get stronger as it warms and you get closer to the bottom of the pint.  Mouthfeel- It is perfectly balanced. The carbonation complements the flavor perfectly. It is about medium bodied with a somewhat sticky and very creamy feel to it.  Drinkability- This is a one bottle wonder for me. Sure it isn't high in alcohol but I can only take so much sweetness. I am not super familiar with Oatmeal stouts so if I am flawed in judgement please forgive me. This stuff goes down so smoothly.  Overall- It is an interesting brew which I encourage anyone who likes stouts to try this atleast once. I am sure there are better examples of this style out there but I could see this being a great gateway beer for someone that is looking into getting into craft beer.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

S: Hints of dark fruit, toasted oats and grains, and mild coffee/latte. Nothing super strong. T: Toasted grains, roasted oats, sweet maple or birch syrup, hints of sweet dark fruits.

The oatmeal really plays out here in the aftertaste. A pinch of chocolate.  M: Mouthfeel is pretty good. Nice one to let linger.  D: Really good drinkability on this one.

113,571,RppIII,4.8,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter Appearance: A dark coffee color topped with thin wisps of an off white head. Oil on water is a good analogy of the remaining head floating atop an obscure black mass of beer.  Smell: A lot of malted barley gives this beer a distinctive coffee odor, which plays on a sweet malted toffee flavour.  Taste: Watered down coffee flavours play on creamy earth tones, and a slight bitterness of hops. Sweet toffee, roast coffee, dark malts and a hint of a bitter finish create an aesthetically pleasing experience. A moderately dry beer makes one feel that the alcohol content of this beer is greater than it actually is.  Mouthful: Beautiful and light this beer has an essence of cream milk with a glow of carbonation.  Drinkability: An extraordinary drink, this beer is a staple for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! At 5% alcohol I can drink this beer all night and a classic among beer aficionados. When I woke the next morning I could still taste this beer and was very tempted to have a pint for breakfast.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Cmack15,4.32,Ahh a classic. Poureds traight down the middle into a tulip glass and got a nice creamy 3 finger head with lots of lacing. Aroma is a very enticing sweet malty smell that invites you to take a sip. The malts are the star of this show and they shine tremendously. Nice sweet malty taste but not too sweet a good balance. The mouthfeel is a of a meduim bodied beer just enough to coat your palate and not overtake it. Great beer for sitting by the fire with a newspaper or crossword puzzle.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,mempath,4.77,"pours a deep impenetrable black with a sort of latte head that holds awhile, laces a bit and starts to settle nicely into a thick veneer.  a sweet dark fruit and toastiness greets the olfactory senses nicely. i catch a nice breadiness with ligonberry jam or something.  again, why should i be surprised at another Samuel Smith offering. they are so on with everything. excellent mouthfeel of sparkly creaminess allows the full crafted flavor to be delivered unhindered. the toastiness in the nose is deepened and spread out in the taste with the slight dark dried fruit sense also deepening but mellowing to exactly where it needs to be. another perfect formula by the brewmasters!  i noticed, as it warms, the 'sweetness' becomes a husk that reveals a nice sour, hoppy bite. mmmm.  so drinkable. session this. after you session half of the lineup from this brewery. amazing. one of my favorite breweries in the world.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

I did a beer tasting at my work for this beer, Wines Unlimited Stratford CT, and it went very well too. People bought this beer that night by the couples or fews, which considering it's steep price and it mysterious nature, this beer did well. I liked this beer. Jolly good!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,icetraxx,2.85,"A: Pours a dark dark, almost black, with opaque brown highlights when the light hits it. A creamy four finger head is produced that fizzles down to a 1/2 finger extra creamy head. Lacing and head retention is only moderate for this stout, I feel a strong head is a must for any type of stout.  S: Smells like marsala wine with roasted malt, caramel, and a dollop of dark chocolate.  T: Tastes exactly like it smells, roasted malt, blackstrap molasses (yuck), sweet malt in general, marsala wine (if you have tasted marsala before you know exactly what I am talking about), some chocolate, dark fruits, and a little less caramel than the smell suggests. There is the slightest suggestion of the bitterness of hops, as well as a trace of their fruitiness, but not quite enough to balance out the intense sweetness. For me the sweetness is a bit cloying, much sweeter than any sweet stout I've ever had let alone an oatmeal stout. The oatmeal flavor seems lost to me. There is a hint of coffee on the finish. There is sweetness everywhere, and it builds. This is a beer, where is the bitter?  M: Smooth and creamy, the oatmeal starch coats your tongue nicely. Slightly over-carbonated, but generally this is as good as any stout can really get. The oatmeal really does add nice and smooth body that needs to be tasted to be believed.  D: For me, terribly low due to the cloying sweetness. I would like to see more bittering hops to mute the sweetness of the additional oatmeal. If you can tolerate sweet beers, I bet you could drink many of these.  O: I'm no hop head, but this beer is so sweet I can't enjoy it at all. Maybe this style isn't for me. I don't think I can finish it, grrr...  EDIT: What a sweet mess, down the drain it goes... Stone's IPA is going to clear my palate.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,biboergosum,4.15,"550ml bottle, something to sip on whilst dinner melds.  This beer pours a clear, deep, dark brown colour, with prominent red highlights, and three fingers of dense, foamy, and puffy beige head, which renders some random inkblot lace around the glass as it slowly meanders away.  It smells of fruity, musty, and lightly roasted caramel malt, bittersweet chocolate, an oily nuttiness, percolating coffee, wet ash, and mildly floral, earthy hops. The taste is more faintly toasted caramel malt, oaten cereal, milk chocolate, dried orchard fruit, almond-flavoured coffee, and some mild woody, leafy hops.  The carbonation is on the low side, just a lulling minor frothiness throughout, the body rather creamy, smooth, and inhabiting the north end of medium weight. It finishes off-dry, the dark fruity malt and fading cocoa notes pushing through.  A lovely, lovely sipper - quaffer - drinker - whatever, this goes down oh so very well, the oatmeal softening, and at times, leading the way. Not hard to see why this is considered to be among the progenitors of the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

A: Pours a very dark shade of brown with some ruby hues capped by a massive three finger head with great retention and some spotty lacing.  S: Complex yet subtle aroma of oats, chocolate, roasted malt, and a flutter of alcohol.  T: Delicate flavor profile of oats, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, roasted malts, and sweet malts. Very clean and complex in that Samuel Smith's kind of way.  M: Medium-bodied with low, creamy carbonation.  D: Extremely easy and pleasurable drink especially with a modest 5% abv.

113,571,CormanoWild,4.58,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a long-stemmed tulip glass.  Appearance: Dark, dark red, practically black. A beautiful color, with a delicious, dark caramel head - not one of those thin, white heads that I feel spells doom for a purported ""stout""! Excellent lacing, as well: strong, thick legs.  Smell: Strong, dark chocolate predominates, with hints of cappuccino and only slight notes of the hops lingering behind.  Mouthfeel: The head is deliciously frothy, again, almost like cappuccino cream. The rest of the beer is equally smooth, and you can really feel the oatmeal body given to the brew.  Taste: Rich, dark caramel and coffee flavors hit your tongue first, accompanied by a dark, dark cacao - I wouldn't even say chocolate - profile. The brew finishes with a quite clear, clean burst of English hops, no perceptible notes of citrus whatsoever. Imagine chewing on a macchiato-flavored caramel, only to bite into the middle and find it's been stuffed with fine, vegetal English hops. As the drink warms, the hops take a back seat and the caramel and chocolate really, really come out - though the hops still do their job of quickly, happily cleansing the palate with a mild bitterness, their vegetal emphasis drops away almost completely.  Drinkability: I'd hate to describe something so flavorful and intense as ""drinkable,"" really, but the clear finish of low-key hops, which tapers off quickly rapidly, leaving you primarily with the enjoyable, lingering aftertaste of coffee and dark malts, would lead me to describe this as, how should I say - ""heartily, repeatably savorable."" That seems to do it justice!  OVERALL: Smooth, creamy, chocolatey, coffee-y, with an incredibly well-balanced level of hops. This beer tastes half like an Italian coffee shop, and half like the best an English tavern could have to offer. In short, it kicks ass. Pity it's so pricey, but it's worth every penny.

However, I've had many others since then and revisited this last night and it wasn't quite what I remembered. Still a very good brew, but I think it's somewhat over-rated.  Pours dark brown with a decent sized head that leaves a lot of lacing.  Smooth, creamy mouthfeel and flavors of roasted malt, chocolate, licorice and somewhat acidic. Did get better as it warmed...to a certain extent. Toward the bottom of the glass it got rather...eh... Kind of cola-like.

Smooth flavor, not aggressively roasty. Mild like a milk stout almost. Roasty, milky sweet finish with faint bitterness. Some milk chocolate. Hard water character that the other brews have. Really pleasing flavor overall, but quite simple. Almost no trace of coffee; no hopping to speak of.  I did expect the feel to be a little better. It's rich, but not as velvety or creamy as it could be. Light carbonation, but it's still felt.  But I can chug this stuff down. Very drinkable. It's a rather mild beer and simple.

Hearty roasted oats and barley highlight the flavor with milky chocolate to follow and again the roasted oats on the finish.

Smells of toasted malts, dried fruits, a touch of coffee and good quality beef stock.  Initially sweet but not overly so.. More dried fruit.. Waiting for some toasted malt or hop bitterness to balance, but don't get alot.. Some mild toasty notes with light, not unpleasant floral esters at the end.  Mouthfeel is smooth. Was hoping for a real chewiness, but it is a wee bit lacking. Still quite thick and delicious, which is one of the reasons I enjoy this style, but compared with others only so-so..  Had originally scored this higher in the drinkability stakes, but after getting halfway through, I do think it is a touch on the sweet side.

Huge oat flavor along with the roasted barley and malts. Nice bittersweet chocolate flavor that gives the beer a dryness. Just fantastically well rounded, gently bittered and perfectly roasty.

The ""dry"" sweetness of the oatmeal keeps it from being too heavy, I think. The slight bitter finish keeps it fresh.  D: Exceptional. It has complexity, medium body, fresh taste. It's wonderful to sip over time as it warms, but it could easily go down in gulps of flavor.  This was one of my first favorites back in college in the 80s. It's still one of my favorites.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,abrand,3.95,"550 mL bottle poured into the SN tumbler. This beer has been on my lenghty list to try, so I'm very excited to give the sammy oatmeal stout a try.  The stout from Tadcaster pours a deep brown color with a tan frothy head after an aggressive pour. Lots of lacing lines the glass. The pour is quite pretty. The nose is quite sweet with the usual stout aromas of chocolate and coffee but this also contains some grainy nuts as well as malts. Taste is sweet as well with lots of chocolate. Where is the oatmeal?? Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crispy. Overall this is a very complex but well balanced that provides much more than the average stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,AlexMunse,4.52,"Poured at 50 degrees into a snifter.  It pours a dark brown color, not as dark as most stouts I've had. Nice one-finger tan head with good lacing and retention.  The smell is a heavy chocolate malt with a little sweetness. Theres a lot of raosted grain coming through with a little alchohol.  Theres a bit of bitterness and sweetness to it. It's a bitlighter than I like my stouts, but still good. Theres a pretty good spicing to it as well.  The first sip is very smooth with an even flavor and nice carbonation. Nothing is too overpowering, I'd say this is a perfectly balanced feel for this beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,DerekP,4.4,"I poured my bottles into a 16 oz mug.  This is my review originally posted @ http://thelightonbeer.blogspot.com -  My buddy has been telling me for a few weeks now about Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout. So, when I saw it at my local six-pack shop, I had to buy a few.  The two singles I bought were somewhere around $3.50 each, give or take a few dimes. They're bottled with a touch of class, with golden foil around the head and on top of the cap. The presentation just about matches the quality of the product, with the beer coming out on top.  Honestly, I don't know much about stouts, nor do I throw them down very often. My previous experiences with stouts involved Guinness (naturally) and some stout brew from Troegs, the exact name I can't remember. To take that back without using the backspace, this past fall I had some sort of double chocolate stout in a purple can, either 16 or 24 oz's (I enjoyed it out of a friend's fridge). I just saw it in the store last night...ahhh...I typed it in Google and found a picture. The brew is made from Young's. Moving on:  I poured the Oatmeal Stout by Samuel Smith (England) in my 16 oz mug (at least I think it's a 16 oz mug) using the straight down the middle pour that I'm under the impression goes without saying when dealing with a stout. I got a really nice head out of the bottle, and the smell is very nice. The head retention is remarkable. Mind you, I'm continuously swirling, but I'm about halfway through the beer and after letting the beer sit for over a minute, I've still got half an inch of head that is showing no signs of disappearing.  The taste is excellent. It offers flavor like a smoked beer (minus the salty beef jerky taste that I can't stand), roasted malts, black coffee, burnt caramel, with a balance that is stronger than any amount of bitterness that would show up, depending on the palate. Considering some of the stronger elements to this beer, it is pretty incredible that it fails to make me want to gag.  After enjoying two Oatmeal Stout singles from Samuel Smith, I not only am going to try another brew from Samuel Smith's Old Brewery, I'm going to explore more in the world of stouts.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,theboozecruise,4.31,"Poured from a 550 ml bottle into a Sam Smith imperial pint glass.  Dark chocolate color, creamy tan head, great retention. Looks awesome.  Smells of chocolate, a hint of oatmeal, a little sweet.  The taste is more of the same, chocolaty malt, a little bitter on the aftertaste, just a hint of oatmeal. I was expecting a little more oatmeal, but it's still a very good stout.  Medium bodied, superbly easy to drink. A top example of the style and an all-time classic beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,bmwats,4.42,"Poured from a 550 ml. bottle into my Samuel Smith nonic.  A: Dark brown, almost black. Pours into a 3 finger, foamy, tan head. Slowly dissipates unevenly leaving sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Plenty of lacing remains as you drink it down.  S: A sweet but heavy malt. Grainy, nutty, a little mocha, chocolate, and a hint of nutmeg and molasses.  T: Heavy robust malt, with a hint of sweetness. The molasses and spice really come out. Just a bit bitter too.  M: Despite the robustness, has kind of a light feel on the palette. I think it's the sweetness, that fools you a bit. Lightly bitter aftertaste remains.  D: This beer is great to sip, but be careful... you can easily power it down too.  Atmosphere is great. Beautiful appearance, and a great, complex, well-balanced nose. Flavor is a near-perfect balance of hearty malt, sweetness, and bitterness. Overall, this is a great quaff.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,bminor7,4.4,"12 oz from Savemore. I can remember, once working in the reclamation dept. of a distributor, and an old coworker would always cringe when disposing of this when out-of-code. That's the hype for me.  A - brown/black...not as dark as an RIS but close. a good pour gives an inch of head that settles to tiny bubbles and sticks to the glass. S - molasses, dark malts, some hops. T - sugary, chocolate. i can never tell how the oatmeal works here. the sweetness is excellent. great flavor. M - light, crisp. effortless. the carbonation is the only downside, but I seem to have that issue commonly and may not be pouring hard enough! D - for a dark beer, the drinkability is oustanding. a good balance - great but not overwhelming flavor. the light abv is important to this.  would buy again and will enjoy the rest of the 4 pack.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,thekanna,4.25,"A: Dark brown with an impressive tan head which leaves rings that won't budge down the side of the glass. Nice, thick, and sticky.  S: Some roasted barley and oat malts sweetened by molasses, hot chocolate powder, and brown sugar.  T: Strong roasted malts, some cacao powder, toffee, molasses, chocolate milk, and coffee. I can taste some oats, but their flavor isn't prominent. Much more of the roasted barley malt shines through as with a typical English stout.  M: Very smooth with almost negligible carbonation.  D: An excellent stout, though a bit heavy and taking a while to finish. I really enjoyed this and wouldn't mind more.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,huricrane47,4.5,"Appearance- dark brown color with a caramel colored head. Smell- sweet cocoa Taste-similar to a cup of roasted coffee with a little chocolate and milk added. Mouthfeel- medium water content Drinkability- Very drinkable- finished this one within 5 minutes. Very enjoyable, complex, and flavorful.  The first thing I tasted with this beer is a medium bitterness. The bitterness is then taken over by a creamy, semi-sweet, roasted coffee/chocolate flavor. Its almost like if you were to put a little dark chocolate and a splash of milk in a cup of coffee. Although, most oatmeal stouts tend to have a more neutral acidic flavor than chocolate or coffee stouts. This beer is no exception- the acid flavor goes up and then comes back down with the coffee and chocolate. This is an excellent beer that is very well made.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,beerwolf77,4.13,"What more can be said about this old stand-by.  Poured into my pint glass the beer is dark chocolate brown with some blood red edges when held to a light. The creamy mocha head is a full inch that recedes leaving a fair amount of lace rings.  The aroma is not a strong as I would have expected. Roasted malt,coffee,cocoa mild bitterness.  The flavor is oh so yummy. Smooth roasted malt with hints of chocolate and raisins. A bitter black coffee bitterness rounds things out in a good way.  Medium to full chewy body. Not much carbonation, which makes it velvety smooth.  Overall a fantastic oatmeal stout. I could drink this all day.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,deleted_user_373360,4.73,Appearance - solid brown and nearly black but if you look closely you see some red and brown. Toffee colored head which was sizable and tons of lacing.  Smell - strongest is the malts and barely followed immediately by the oats. It's a very sweet scent and it only gets better in it's taste.  Taste - the oats come through with the malt and it is absolutely delicious. With the malt you get the slightest hint of bitterness and it tastes like a real stout. You don't get anything like coffee or chocolate just pure oats.  Mouthfeel - carbonation is upfront but then fades. Perhaps my only critique is unlike other stouts its very thing and light where as traditionally it is a thicker consistency.  Drinkability - could easily drink a few in a night before it got too heavy for me. Truly a delicious oatmeal stout and will continue to drink it again and again.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ludachris,4.45,"Last of the Samuel Smiths 3-pack. The last two were good, so lets see how this one fairs.  Pours a deeep chestnut brown, boardering black. I would have thought it was black if I didn't hold it up to the light, where ruby red and mahogany highlights were showcased. 2 fingers of creamy, khaki coloured head with solid retention top this beer leaving some nice, sheet like lacing.  Roasted malts, burnt molasses, brown sugar, powdery cocoa and a subtle but strange sour apple presence. Still a solid smelling beer.  Molasses, roasted malt, cocoa, grain, light oats, brown sugar with a hint of coffee and buttery malt making an appearance in the finish.  Mouthfeel is silky smooth. Reminded me a bit of Young's Double Chocolate Stout. Excellent balance, with the sweetness being perfectly stated. Light to medium bodied and RIDICULOUSLY easy to drink.  Overall, an excellent beer. By far the best of the 3 pack (which includes their EBA and EPA),d easily placed in the top ten beers I've ever had. St. Ambroise version of this is great, but I enjoyed this one much more. A perfect dessert beer but I could see myself having this on almost any occasion. I think this will be one of my favourites for a long time.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,smallbatchbrewer,3.5,"I must have walked passed this stuff a million times between all of the beer runs I have been on. The gold leaf cap and neck always catch my eye. Maybe because because of price or lack of interest by the group I'm usually with I never have had a chance to bring a bottle back to my place. I finally picked one up... here it goes...  A- Dark as dark can be, 2 finger head with creamy body that stuck around for quite a while and left a hearty lacing as it settled.  S- Chocolate, malt, toast (kinda bready but more toasted than yeast bread scent)  T- Honestly a little disappointed at the overall flavor, I'm tasting chocolate, cream, and something a little sour/sweet like ripe fruit. I can't pick up any of the ""oatmeal"" but I'm not entirely sure how much flavor of oat should actually be present in this beer. An average stout for taste  M- I have to say that this beer feels great in the mouth. Perfect body and carbonation and a warming feel not from the alcohol but from the rich texture of the beer itself. I really wish the flavors were a little more palatable to match the mouthfeel.  D- Average, mouthfeel is great but with its heavier qualities I might be taking a breather before I drink any in a session, one was like a liquid dessert",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Extremely great stout,highly recommend it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,MbpBugeye,4.48,"A- Pours a thin brown that collects into a black body. The redish brown shows through on the sides a little. You can already tell this is going to be a very sessionable stout.  The head rises to a beautifully thick and airy light tan cloud. It has exceptional retention and all the lacing anyone could ask for. This is one good looking beer.  S- Letting this warm slightly will strengthen the aromas. Smooth chocolate malts, powdery cocoa. It smells great but it is still a little subdued.  T- Grainy chocolate malts at first, some sweetness in the middle and a roasty bitterness to finish it off. The oatmeal comes in slightly at the end and hangs on in the aftertaste.  M- Smooth, creamy and delightful. Thin body, medium to low carbonation.  D- Really sessionable and extremely enjoyable. This isnt too heavy or too light. Its a perfect session beer.  Everything I have tried from Sam Smith has been spot on. They usually set the benchmark for most English styles.

It's espresso look-a-like body is crowned by crema-like head, tightly-formed with a rich tan colour. That cap of foam shows excellent retention and clings thickly to the walls of your glass. Deep brown sugar aroma underpins notes of coffee and raisins. Tastes more breakfast roast than french. Initial coffee flavour gives way midpalate to fruit and semisweet chocolate. Finishes with a medium bitterness. Throughout, there is an underlying gentle sweetness. While not the heaviest stout around, the oats do give it some noticeable weight on the palate. It feels much heavier in the mouth than it does in the stomach. Very smooth and velvety, with very little carbonation. Well-rounded and flavourful, and a pleasure for all the senses. Outstanding.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,veritas88,3.59,"I did a terrible pour the first time, so the head was huge. Second time head was much better, poured a very dark brown with a hint of dark red, and the head was a nice tan color, didn't last long but had lots of lacing.  Smell wasn't very strong at first, got but stronger as it got warm. Smells like bread, maybe a little bitter. Reminds me of some sort of food roasting in the oven.  Tastes surprisingly light for how dark the color is. Very smooth. Tastes a little smoky or roasted. Just a tad sweet, and not as bitter as I was expecting from how it smells. I keep getting a little bit of metallic aftertaste, which I don't really like. Metallic taste keeps getting stronger the more I drink it.  Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth. Almost creamy, but not annoyingly so. Very good.  Drinkability: the alcohol is very warm to me, but I don't taste it. I think it's a little heavy to drink a lot of, but it's definitely worth trying.  Overall it's pretty good, the mouthfeel is great.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,thejewthatbrews,4.38,"Poured from the bottle into an imperial pint. Deep, deep brown with ruby-brown edges and a coffee-cream colored head. Low on carbonation, head disappears quickly.  Smells of sweet yeast or breads.  Definite roasty taste, with a bit of licorice at the back end.  Incredible mouthfeel, reminiscent of a cream ale. Smooth, velvety texture keeps the licorice in check.  Overall, very satisfying. Definitely worth buying again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,TheHammer,3.84,"Having never had an Oatmeal Stout before, and having just purchased a convenient Samuel Smith's mix pack, I thought I'd start from the top on this style.  Appearance: A body as black as night, just as ever good stout should be. Two and a half fingers of creamy head. Solid head retention, but not very much in the way of lacing though.  Smell: Rich chocolate dominates the nose with dark roasted malt to back it up. Has the barest note of oatmeal to it but really the big problem is it is all so subdued and warming didn't really help it out.  Taste: Sweet chocolate with a touch of grain to start, switching to a sweet molasses, brown sugar and a small amount of oatmeal taste and ends with a smooth light floral hop and coffee bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Nice smooth transistioning, slight chocolate and roasted malt aftertaste that leaves a slight creaminess in the mouth. The only thing I can take away from it, is the carbonation turns lax at around the one third left mark.  Drinkability: Wow, the oats must be what is making this beer so smooth, as very few stouts go down this well. It is a stout so I suppose it is expected to be a bit heavier on the gut, but it's fairly good as far as stout's go. Refreshing enough, but clearly a winter beer.  Final Thoughts: All in all, solid stuff here, nothing really to complain about. This would be great to have by a fireplace at the cottage or at Christmas. I'm not sure I'd say it's incredible, but it's certainly worth trying at the very least.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

S: Sweet scent seems to dominate the nose (dark fruits and molasses) along with some roasted malts. Pleasant, but nothing really special.  T: Roasted malts, burnt coffee, caramel, molasses, subtle fruit, and just hint of hoppy bitterness on the finish. Nice balance overall.  M: Oatmeal makes this o so smooth all the way down. It's really quite nice. Medium to full bodied with a good amount of carbonation.  D: A well balanced, smooth, and great tasting beer. This, along with the 5% abv make this extremely drinkable.

113,571,beervana1858,2.48,"I had pretty high expectations for this beer and after the first taste I thought it would be a beer that I would buy again. About halfway through however, there was an off flavor of sorts which could only be compared to rotting fruit. I did finish it but I was tempted to pour it out.

As I got further down the glass it seemed to taste better, almost had a fruit flavor in there. Not much bitterness  Mouthfeel- Not too heavy, kind of creamy. Good feel over all.  Drinkability- Really easy for me to drink, could drink quite a few of these.  Notes: I rather enjoyed this, was my first oatmeal stout.

I like it quite a lot. the feel is a most a light-medium, but there is a very crisp carbonation that makes things a bit more exciting. the lightness of the beer, but the intensity and darkness of the taste make an interesting combination that I find quite chugable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Tastes like heaven going down you throat. It is somewhat sweet but also malt and somewhat bitter. The hops are present just so you know there are hops in the beer but they are not a big component of the beer. The main part of the taste is the dark chocolate and i want to say caramel malts.

A light bitterness from the hops which are faint, leads to coffee, milk, chocolate and butter.  D: Excellent stout that everyone should try at least once. Very hearty and full of taste.

Brown sugar and molasses body, hints of wood, nuts, oatmeal, all overlayed on a light roasty malt base. Lightish/medium body but at 5% no surprise there; almost milk stout sweetness.

T: Sweet and smoky, a nutty chocolate with perhaps a touch of coffee bitterness. Toffee is nice and subtle. The oatmeal works well, rounding it out.  M: Crisp up front, but very creamy throughout thereafter with a good chewy finish. Very good.  D: With all the flavors, it's somewhere between a candy bar and a sandwich.

113,571,bnes09,3.95,"Look is opaque black with red tint when held up to light. A thick tan head appears on the pour with excellent retention and leaves a blanket of lace behing.  Smell is pleasant and consists of a mild roasted character with a hefty dose of molasses as well.  The taste was slightly disappointing for me and I would only place it slightly above average. Molasses sweetness arouses the palate immediately followed by the roasted malt and finally the oats. The roasted character comes through in the form of coffee and dark chocolate but is slightly weak for a stout in my opinion. Hops are also hardly detectable. Brew finishes dry and mildly bitter.  Although there is a bitter, dry finish, the mouthfeel is very smooth. It has a light to medium body with a hint of carbonation that tickles the tongue.  Due to the lighter body and smooth mouthfeel, this one is very drinkable.  Overall, a solid choice for an oatmeal stout. My only real complaint is that it provided less of a bold roasted malt character that I love so much about stouts.

Has a surprisingly fruity nose, like raisins and prunes and other dried dark fruits and something reminiscent of the freeze dried strawberries you get in a lot of cereals these days.  The taste follows, with lost of chocolate roast, coffee and a bitter anise like quality to it, it's almost somewhere between a nutty brown ale and a sweet stout. More sweet and less dry than I'd prefer with below moderate roastiness, but quite enjoyable as it is.  Smooth, medium body with moderate carbonation, just a tad oily.

Can't taste the oatmeal that much, although the presence of roasted oats can be detected, definitely picked up some hints of dark chocolate and caramel. It starts off sweet, then the heavier roasted malts come in, and finishes off with a slight bitterness.  M - hits the palate in all the right places, to put it simply. Does not feel overly heavy on the tongue but is definitely thick and almost syrupy, which I personally like  D - a very drinkable beer in my opinion. goes great with a meal or on it's own. it's also not a particularly strong beer at 5% abv, so one could easily drink a few of these in one night  Overall opinion - One of my favorite beers that I drink regularly. I enjoy stouts and dark malty beers, so this was a real treat. And the price is spot on. Considering the quality of this beer, I think it's a steal.

T- Chocolate, and roasted malt with a bit of oat and hop bitterness on the finish.  M- Really smooth and creamy. Medium carbonation.  D- Really easy to drink. The smooth mouthfeel and full flavored but light qualities of this beer really contribute to this. Definitely a gateway beer for me and one I'm glad I revisited.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,glid02,3.83,"Bottle purchased from Green's on Ponce in Atlanta.  Pours one shade from black with a half-finger tan head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving solid lacing.  Smells of sweet oatmeal with molasses and lightly roasted malts lurking in the background. As it warms hints of semi-sweet chocolate waft out.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Very lightly roasted malt flavors up front segue quickly into oatmeal and molasses flavors. Midway through the sip a hint of chocolate enters into things before making way for a sweet ending.  Mouthfeel is very good. It has a smooth thickness with soft carbonation.  Drinkability is good. I didn't have a problem finishing the bottle and could have another.  Overall this is an oatmeal stout, not a stout brewed with oatmeal. Worth a shot.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,billshmeinke,4.16,"500ml bottle. Poured into pint glass (I wish I had a proper tumbler so I could do the british thing proper).  A: Black as the dickens, impenetrable to light, light khaki head. Very impressive head retention. Nice Lacing.  S: Not what I expected. Dark fruit (raisin mostly), a hint of chocolate, very sweet smelling.  T: Sweet raisin flavor upfront, oats come through mid palate, and a bitter chocolate malt at the end. Hops are clearly adding to the final bitterness, but are not very pronounced. Kinda like the beer version of a chocolate chip oatmeal raisin cookie.  M: On the lighter side of medium bodied. Feels right.  D: Very easy to drink. However, it isn't like there is a high abv to mask or anything.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Smells of tobacco, chocolate, roasted coffee.Taste of burnt bitter coffee for a moment, then sweet chocolate/coffee with a mild bitter finish. Mouthfeel smooth with a medium body. Wonderfully easy to drink, the Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout was one of the first Stouts I ever drank and along with their Imperial Stout is still one of my favorites.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,seand,4.4,"Poured from a 550ml bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a dark opaque brown, near black, with a foamy tan head. Lacing and retention are good.  S: Rosted malt, hints of milk chocolate and nuts.  T: Sweet, malty, full flavored. A little bit of coffee-like taste, especially in the slightly bitter finish.  M: Fairly carbonated, full bodied, slightly sticky aftertaste.  D: Drinks very easy, and the reasonable ABV makes it a pretty solid session beer.  If you like the style, or sweeter full flavored beers in general, this beer is definitely worth a try.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Mosstrooper,4.56,"Poured from 12oz bottle into Roanoke College branded American pint glass.  Appearance: Pours black with a large, foamy brown head that stays for a long time and leaves behind lots of lace with foam still floating about the top of the beer.  Smell: Sweetness from the oats, along with the typical roasted malt smell expected of a stout.  Taste: An interesting sweetness, with a hint of roasted malt bitterness at the end. This particular beer may be a bit older, as there is a slight alcohol taste that I wouldn't expect from a beer of this ABV.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth, with only a touch of carbonation at the beginning. Sticks to the palate, and has a dry, satisfying finish.  Drinkability: Simply put- my new favorite stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

The head dissipates slowly leaving lots of nice lacing.  Smell: Very malty smelling. The oaty sweetness also comes out strongly in the smell.  Taste: Has the malty dryness typical of stouts but with some extra sweetness added. The oats really add some nice flavors to this beer as well.  Mouthfeel: A little chewy with an exceptionally dry finish.  Drinkability: This is my first oatmeal stout, so I might be a little skewed. This is a great beer and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The oats really add a new depth of flavor to an already great style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Duttonic,4.63,"Dark, rich pour with a finger of creamy tan foam. Silky and velvety texture, amazingly smooth. I could surprisingly make this a session beer. The sweet, chocolate flavor is not overbearing. It is perfect as an after dinner beer or for drinking a few if you are in the mood for dark beer. It smells of cocoa, nuts, and maybe a hint of cinnamon. Enjoy one of you get the chance.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,webmanspidey,4.36,"Bottle poured into a pint glass. This is dark, rich, and thick with a solid inch of head. The smell doesn't offer much, but has a faint sweet aroma hiding in the background. Taste is very sweet, combining semisweet dark chocolate chips, raisins, and the namesake oatmeal. This features a thick, creamy mouthfeel and awesome drinkability.. almost no alcohol presence whatsoever. This is a very solid easy-drinking stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Stavage,4.4,"Got a nice frothy tan head that retains well and leaves good lacing. The brew itself is ink black. Everything a stout should look like.  Very strong dark malt smell. I get scents of a dark bread, like rye or even pumpernickel. There is only a hint of this though, so I found it pleasant despite my dislike of pumpernickel. Also it is balanced by more cakey malt smells. There is a little bit of that acidic espresso scent in there, but not nearly as much as many of the other stouts I've been drinking lately.  The taste doesn't surprise, and it definitely does not disappoint. Lots of dark malt flavours. Savoury dark bread malts mixing well with sweeter heavy cake like malts. Just enough hops to balance things, though it definitely isn't a main player. There is an acidity in the flavour. Maybe a little too much for me, it leaves me with a slightly rough feeling in my throat. I also wish there was a little bit more in the way of chocolate and coffee flavours. Keep in mind these aren't gripes, but merely the factors missing that would have otherwise netted the taste a 5 from me.  Very full body, very creamy, for the most part very smooth (aside from that acidity that added a little roughness). Definitely a meal in a beer.  A great sipping stout. Will be stocking up on these when winter comes around again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,SpeedwayJim,3.92,"Poured from a 550ml bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery pint glass.  A: Poured a 3 finger light brown fine head with great retention. Brew itself is near opaque except for the slightest bit of light shining through. Lacing is excellent with layers marking where I drank.  S: Nose is coarse and grainy with a slight hint of coffee and sugar.  T: Beginning is warming and oatmeal which develops and sours with hints of coffee. Meanwhile the brew develops to be more substantial and sweet as the experience continues. Finishes a little sweet with slightly noticeable alcohol.  M: Light bodied and rather coarse. The coarsity takes away from the taste here, not allowing it to develop as it would otherwise. Finishes clean and simple.  D: Highly drinkable, flavor isn't too heavy but is complex enough to keep me intrigued. Enjoyable if you're looking to transition from a maltier palate to something that starts to be hoppy. This isn't it, but it'll wean you off the excessive maltiness.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,PEBKAC,4.61,"12oz edition, random pint glass.  Tan, creamy, & slow to recede. Greasy dark brown color pierced with shades of amber.  I smell Milk Duds, coffee creamer, still water, a touch of smoke, ...& something a little ripe.  /Impatiently waiting on my meager typing skills to catch up to my mouth: Toasty sweet oats, vanilla, & almond paste. Rum & coke. Bit of a twang to it, but it gets lost in the bittersweet char finish.  I would of guessed 6%. The alcohol is warming, rather then irritating. Frothy, not quite thick, slightly tacky mouthfeel. Soft bubbles.  Possibly the best oatmeal stout in existence.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,rdub,3.82,Poured into a pint glass from a 50 degree chilled bottle. Dark as night with a tight tan head and lacing. The smell was fantastic and was better to me than the taste. Roasty toasty malt with a touch of hops. The beverage was bone dry but right for the style. Easily drinkable and a nice brew.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,TheBeerLovesYou,4.72,"Note: I don't know how long this beer has been sitting in the store I picked it up from. It's just a deli, so it's probably not as reliable as someplace specializing in beer or a place that prides itself on freshness like whole foods or the like.  a: this stuff looks really awesome in the glass. It's got a rich brown texture that, under the light, really stands out. Under further examination, it's clear that this beer has multiple layers and the texture is something that's going to be quite a joy for all the senses. This beer screams out ""drink me"".  s: There's a great dark caramel, nut, and oatmeal mixture with a hint of alcohol that creeps in out of no where. It's rich, but not overwhelmingly so. No burnt or stale smell here. Just a lot of body and boldness that you wouldn't normally expect from an oatmeal stout.  t: Sadly, the taste is not quite as complex as the smell. That being said, this oatmeal stout is no slouch in the taste department. The alcohol stands out right in front, which is nice, I think. Behind that there's a clear oat and nut base and a smooth finish with just a hint of tart and lip smack at the very end. It's not a refreshing beer, but it's certainly hearty.  m: Your mouth won't know what hit it. Smooth in the front, tart in the back, and dry going down. Like I said for taste, you'll need a glass of water after this beer, either to hydrate (hah) or prep for some other beer. In the end, this beer wants to be enjoyed and your mouth will certainly thank you for enjoying it again and again.  d: With such a wonderful flavor and texture, not to mention a pretty nice ABV, this beer is certainly one worth enjoying again and again. This beer gets top marks for drinkability. Now excuse me, I'm going to get back to enjoying this wonderful beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,jt31914,3.65,"A: 1 1/2 head - black color with very little carbonation rising.  S: Melded oatmeal and faint alcohol that is present in every samuel smith's beer.  T: Oatmeal is strong, the faint alcohol is there as well and slight chocolate/char flavor in finish.  M: A little too bubbly but good.  D: Heavy but drinkable.  My problem with Samuel Smith's is that they all taste okay, but the tastes seem pretty similar - very dry and alcohol-heavy.

113,571,TheMadJack,4.3,"Poured from 18.7 oz. bottle into mug.  Beer is dark brown and almost completely opaque. The head crests a full inch and settles to about a third. Foamy, sticky, toffee colored head with some lacing.  The beer smells like a caramel apple - heavy, syrupy caramel notes over sweet and sour fruityness. Roasted coffee notes come through behind.  Flavor is roasted coffee, caramel, and toast. Slight bitter finish, like a good espresso. The beer doesn't linger overmuch, but fades out without any hurry. The beer takes on a creamy note as it warms, and the coffee becomes more pronounced. Dark chocolate comes through on the finish as well.  This is one smooth beer. Gently carbonated, slightly foamy, with a flowing, creamy mouthfeel. Almost like drinking milk. Wonderful, beery milk. Like mother used to make, or would have if God had been thinking properly. I digress.  This beer is a pleasure to drink. While not exactly ""session"" material, it's easy to drink and I could see having several over the course of a long evening.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,deleted_user_357747,3.85,"Purchased a bomber from Supermarket Liquors in Fort Collins. Poured in an Samuel Smith pint glass.  A- Nearly perfect black, with just a little light coming through the glass. Billowy light tan head that hangs around and sticks to the glass. The head is thinner than you'd expect, more like the head on a Belgian beer than an English stout.  S- Malt smell, the sticky sweetness of the oats is just noticeable, light apples and pears, and a hint of grassiness. Pleasant, but kinda weak.  T- Not your usual stout; the oat mash really transforms this stout into something different; a grainy sweetness dominates the taste, moving to dried fruits and finishing with a disappointing old dishwater close. It's like they gave up halfway through the taste. It's good, but the taste is a little too thin and transparent for an olde English oatmeal stout.  M- Medium bodied, and a chewy texture makes each sip a pleasure to wade through. Very little carbonation to speak of.  D- Good, seems like it would go good paired with a roast and thick stew.

113,571,jarmby1711,3.83,This appeared as a stout should. It was mildly disappointing in the mouth lacking some velvety smoth softness that I associate with Oatmeal Stout.

113,571,PerroGrande,4.33,"Appearance: Deep red color that appears to be nearly black until illuminated. This beer produces a traditional and expected thick, tan foam. The foam dies away fairly quickly leaving telltale lacing on the glass.  Aroma: Not overpowering, but hints of chocolate and coffee are present, as are hints of malt. As the beer has a chance to breathe, some citrus hints are also present.  Taste: Hints of dark chocolate, coffee, and malt blend together in a fine example of an oatmeal stout. Let this beer breathe a bit and warm up, and some of the citrus hints in the aroma appear in the taste as well.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, with some hints of carbonation.  Drinkability: Excellent! Tasty, refreshing, but with all the character expected from a stout.  I've saved this for just such an evening -- the first truly cool fall-like night to hit our area. A pint of this is an absolutely perfect compliment to not only dinner, but the evening. Let this beer breathe and warm up a bit, and its smoothness and complexity will be revealed.

Brought to mind vomit, which is not good. Hints of chocolate syrup and coffee.  T - Straight chocolate syrup and coffee. Very sweet and toasty. A strange, pectin-like taste that's almost like that of apple juice (??).  M - More watery than I expected. Flat feeling.  D - Very filling. It is an oatmeal stout, after all...

Minimal bitterness.  Feel: Low carbonation, extraordinary smooth and creamy body for a 5% abv beer.

Pours with a beautiful dark brown colour with a coffee coloured massive head that stays throughout. Very noticeable lacing. One peculiar thing about the head was that it was always tilted, everytime i refilled the glass, the head was always tilted. Good coffee, chocolate nose with great depth. The taste was real big - sweet chocolatey with a bitter end note. This is really an end to end desription but there was a lot going on in between as well, can't describe it.

The beer pours a black color, with an one-finger-thick, light-brown head.  Smell: Like a stout; sweet caramel, burned malts, and something sharp (a bit alcoholic)  Taste: Complex and bittersweet; sweet-salty salmiac liquorish, banana, hints of fresh-sour fruits (cherry), roasted and smoked malts. The beer has a very bitter, salty salmiac aftertaste. Quite fruity for a stout.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation that still tingles the tongue. Light and creamy, not too full-bodied.

Stays about one finger throughout. Smells nice and malty with all the bread-like characteristics taking center stage. I thought it was fairly floral with chocolate and coffee notes in the mix as well. The sweet smell reminded me of dark fruits.  Balanced flavor kicks off with a dark chocolate sweetness with cherry or tart citrus hints in the mix. Makes a short sour turn before going toward a nut flavor and then to the classic coffee-like bitterness that finishes the brew. This beer really nails the mouthfeel. Very creamy, nice carbonation, good heavy bodied beer. Almost chewy. Good drinkability for the style.

Head is nice and thick to start off and it leaves a fair amount of lacing. It smells of malts along with a tinge of caramel and chocolate. Can't really detect the oatmeal... but then again I didn't know oatmeal had a smell.  Hoppiness is apparent from the first sip, but it quickly mellows into crisp and pleasant malty taste with subdued hints of toffee and chocolate. The finish is bready and ever so chewy, with barely any aftertaste. Definitely lives up to the stout name as it feels full on the tongue. Carbonation is just enough to stimulate the taste buds and let you experience the full flavor of the beer.  Definitely a very drinkable brew. I could have easily had another couple of mugs. Pleasant and refreshing but with just enough body, it leaves you quite content.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Retention is well above average and lacing is decent.  Smells of chalky minerals, Nestle milk chocolate powder and some dark fruit...raisins and brown sugared figs.  Taste is sweet milky chocolate with a slightly sour flavor and a bit of roast. The carbonation is low and it is not as creamy feeling as I expect in an oatmeal stout. There is also a bit of fruitiness that detracts from the smoothness of the beer. Maybe it is the brewery, but I have yet to be overly impressed with a Sam Smith's beer.

Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied, crisp, thick and semi-light viscous. Drinkability - a real good crisp stout.

Very slightly toasty, not at all roasty or burnt. Malty, can't pick out the oatmeal in particular I don't think but smells sweet and makes me feel ok that I had one of these with my breakfast on a camping trip.  T - A lot more subtle at first than you might expect, but then comes in the toastiness, then creeps in the chocolate and it ends with coffee. This for me is the definition of a drinkable breakfast beer. Forget those 9% coffee concoctions, this is made to sit in a glass next to your pancakes and eggs. Malty and sweet throughout without being cloying or sticky.  M - Really great body, thin but not. Maybe silky. Not thick and super sweet/sticky. Just the right amount of unfermentables.

Smells of rich oatmeal malt and a sweetness reminescent of english toffee. a slight nose of bittering hops.  Rich sweet malts, chocolate and oats. jesus is this a tasty one. Tried it in the past but for some reason never reviewed it.  Mouth is delightful and smooth. Drinks slowly but great for the style",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,kegger22,3.9,"Pours a dark, dark brown with a two finger head that hangs in there well. The aroma is some chocolate and a little alki. The taste is sweet, chocolate and a bit of sourness; but I do not get much coffee. Feel was rich and smooth but not heavy. Drinkability was typical for a stout, you'd like to, but it's just too sweet and heavy to make a night of it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,Lolli1315,4.45,"Poured this one in my pint glass. Have had this one before so I am looking forward to it.  A- Black body with a one finger tan head. Lacing isn't too bad, looks quite tasty.  S- Dark malty smell is what hits the nose first. After that it seems like I am getting an oat smelled coupled along with a little nutty yeasty smell.  T- The dark malts come through just like in the smell. At the backend of this beer you get that oat flavor that I expect out of an oatmeal stout. There also is a little of that nut flavor throughout. Tasty oatmeal stout.  M- This is probably the part of the beer that I have the largest problem with (and it isn't that big of a problem). I expected the mouthfeel to be a little fuller than it was and I feel that it would be a little better if the body was beefed up a little.  D- I could sip on these all night.  Notes: I would prefer a RIS rather than an Oatmeal Stout, but this is still a great beer. I find this to be a good beer to finish that night off with.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,TheFirstKnight,4.45,Appearance - Black with a tan head. The head lasts for a while.  Smell - Nice coffee smell with a hint of some brown sugar.  Taste - It has a strong malt flavoring with some sweetness mixed in. It has a bitter finish to it. It didn't have a strong oatmeal taste to it.  Mouthfeel - very little carbonation to it.  Drinkability - It was very smooth. It left me feeling a bit full when drunk quickly. I feel that this is a beer worth sipping.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,farrago,4.17,"Pleasing finger+ head of tan bubbles, the largest pop swiftly leaving denser foam to settle across the surface, moderate stickiness to the lacing. Mostly black, at some angles you can see dark brown to orange hues but not much. Very fragrant nose of black grape, blackberry fruit, black licorice and sweetened coffee, hard toffee, minor oats and other grains, nothing bitter here, very dominated by the fruit. In the mouth it's medium-bodied, the carbonation has a fine prickle to it and keeps things spinning around the palate. More sheer roast in the coffee flavors, bringing out more dark chocolate and cocoa as a result. Hint of witchhazel. Remains noticeably grapey, you also get red plum, cherry and blueberry fruit. Good grip, not too creamy, stands up for itself and not over ingratiating. The toast also teases out additional breadiness. Good length as it finishes, dries out steadily, tidy ending. Quite clear that this is British and not American made.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,mulder1010,4.24,"A-- black with a tan head. got 2 inches of head before it slowly went away. Not a lot of carbonation either and no lacing.  S-- a sweet coffee smell, like a lot of sugar put in a good cappuccino. A little burnt but not like overdrawn as coffee can be. Also get some brown sugar.  T-- Sweet but like an overdrawn cappuccino, not near as much oatmeal as I remember. Still reminds me of a sweeter version of a coffee stout.  M- Kind of flat but still a coffee feel. A little bit of a coffee bit but very good. Get the feeling of eating oatmeal with a decent amount of brown sugar.  D-- The strong suit of this beer I have always thought. Very drinkable. Could do several of this and never get tired of it. An excellent combination of ingredients. Just to me lacks more oatmeal.  Have not had this in a log time and a perfect session beer. Not real heavy but it can leave you full. Probably better sipped and enjoyed.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Smell-coffee and burnt ashes aroma, alcohol, fusel smells throughout.  Taste/Mouthfeel-full body, a lot of layers of flavor, chocolate sweetness, tart sourness, smoky earthiness, sort of muddled flavor and not smooth.  Drinkability-slow sipper for sure.  Overall-a complex beer with lots of layers, worthy of a try for the hype alone, but I think it just didn't measure up to it's name.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,mwa423,3.53,"A - Popped open the bottle, poured into a pint glass, WOW the head (which by the way is a dark brown), I might have poured it a bit aggressively but it filled 1/4th of an imperial pint glass. The color is jet black just like it should be.  S - Coffee, chocolate malt, also a sweetness, but not a caramel sweetness. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's there.  T - Rich coffee, malt, oatmeal stout flavor. Above average for the style. Surprisingly strong taste for only 5%.  M - Weak for the style, almost watery. I would say that it is close to Guinness in that it has lots of flavor, but watery mouthfeel. I also might have gotten an overcarbonated bottle, but carbonation is tickling my mouth, not something I expect from an oatmeal stout, and not particularly pleasant.  D - This could easily be a session for nights where I want malt and lots of it. Because Sam Smith's is so easy to find, I will give it consideration next time I'm looking for something cheap and malty.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,kflorence,4.87,"A: Pours opaque black with fairly decent tan head that sticks around for awhile. Minimal lacing, carbonation is not noticeable. Looks absolutely gorgeous!  S: Smells of raisins, burnt oatmeal, dark cocoa, caramel and perhaps a bit of espresso. This is honestly one of the best smelling beers out there... it is an overall sweet and inviting aroma.  T: Taste is fairly strong and complex. Oatmeal brown sugar and a plethora of caramelized malts hit the tongue first, followed by raisins and molasses. This is followed by a dry, coffee, hop and alcohol flavor. The lingering taste in the mouth is of burnt oatmeal, dark cocoa, roasted nuts and cigars. What a superbly crafted brew this one turned out to be. One of the most flavorful and refined beers out there in my humble opinion.  M: Although this is by all means a heavy bodied brew, the mouthfeel somehow comes off as smooth. Sam Smith's has managed to craft a thick, yet not syrupy beer with plenty of substance without becoming anything with the consistency of motor oil. Kudos!  D: As mentioned, this is a heavy beer, but it manages to sit pretty light in the stomach. Obviously a few of these will fill you up, but they won't make you feel overstuffed or bloated. I would never turn one of these down. One of my favorites.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,patobandito,4.73,"Been hearing rave reviews about this one for a while, but I've just recently been enjoying stouts, so thought I would give it a try.  Pours thick with a medium, creamy coffee head. The beer itself is thick, oil like. Smells of heavy malt with a lot of chocolate tones. The taste is fantastic, with a lot of chocolaty roasty malt, with a bitter finish, coming in the form of roasted coffee.  Great stout, will be drinking again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

S - Not really getting great flavours, bit metallic.  T - Didn't know what to expect after the first smell, but silky roast flavours come in lightly, chocolatey in the middle, then a big smokey/roasted flavours at the end leaving an awesome after taste, tastes like I'm still drinking a fair gulp.  M - Perfect mouthfeel, goes downlike beery milkshake.  D - Don't think I could make it a session beer, a couple over a hearty dinner would be awesome tho.  NB.

So I am taking the time to sit and review this lone hero in real time at my computer...  Poured into my favorite plain, somewhat chipped pint glass.  Pours a very dark brown; nearly black color with a bit of redness around the edges where the light fights to get through. Initially it has an amazing creamy 3 finger head that slowly receeds and leaves a fair amount of lacing about the previously touched sections of the glass. Deep smell reveals traces of burnt grains, chocolate and little bits of coffee. Taking a deep gulp, it has that rich smoothness you would expect with anything advertising the name oatmeal. Immediate flavors of over-ripened dark fruit, coffee, chocolate and burnt barley/hop bitterness brings in the finish. The carbination is enough to make your tongue tingle...quite inviting for the next sip.

113,571,myost88,3.98,"Poured from the 550 ml bottle into a Guiness pint glass.  Appearance- Pours the typical dark stout black with a light tan fluffy head. Lots of chunky patches of lace.  Smell- First thing I thought of was that it had this odd sweet wine like scent. Not something I'm used to in stout. Typical stout scents are less prevalent. Odd.  Taste- Very tasty! Lots of nice sweet chocolatey taste. The roasty stout flavor is not found in this one. The sweetness replaces it I think. Some graininess is present. No trace of that wine-scent in the taste.  Mouthfeel- Thick and smooth. Almost no carbonation. Milk would be an effecive comparison.  Drinkability- As with all the Sam Smith's beers, this one is very easy to take nice big quaffs of! At 5% I could easily down a few pints of this one.  Overall- I'm a huge SS fan. This one isn't my favorite, but it lives up to my standards for this brewery. Not great but pretty good.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,lacqueredmouse,3.06,"Very dark black-brown, with hints of ruby blood-red when held to the light. Thickish head of surprisingly light white foam. Some lacing. Pancake bubbles across the surface. Nice.  Dry chocolate notes on the nose, with a light vinous character, a little vinegary even. Some grassy, green lucerne and grain characters, not terribly dark, a small amount of sugar syrup. Can't say I'm a huge fan to be honest. Pretty weak.  Taste is a little better, a little syrupy sugar, but a dark malt character at the back to cleanse with a little bitterness. Mouthfeel quite thin, and there is that lingering sour character that's just out of place. The slight sugar syrup character lingers a little too much on the back too. Again. it's got some nice characters, but I'm not a big fan.  No, it doesn't do it for me overall. It's just too light and a little to sickly. It needs some depth and body behind it. There are some decent characters, but there are also some odd notes that put me off.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,laituegonflable,3.73,"Pours a dark burgundy colour, quite dark but a lot of colour in it, especially when held up to the light. The head is thin, very thin actually, beige colour. Leaves some deliciously sticky cascades of lacing around the edge. Pretty good indeed.  Nose is sweet and sticky, slightly roasty with a light cocoa character, hints of brown sugar, maybe some spice as well, nutmeg I think. A light citrus character at the back, orange and maybe lemon as well. A lot of nuance, but a bit subdued with nothing explosively aromatic.  Roasted character throughout the palate, slightly bitter without overdoing it into ashy territory. Hints of cocoa and a fair amount of cereal grain. Has a port character towards the back with a good sweetness that again doesn't overdo it by venturing into sickly-town or syrup-ville. Feel is smooth and velvety. Reasonably full but gliding, like indigestion cream.  This is extremely drinkable stuff, with smooth pleasant flavours. It does venture into sweet territory at the back, but it's balanced enough for the most part to make it quaffable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

This is quite a light stout as compared to others I have had.  Taste: Sweet toffee. Chocolate, caramel, and coffee is also there. Again, a very sweet tasting beer. Beer roasted malt taste.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy. A very small touch of alcohol pokes through. Very sweet beer. Full bodied. Medium level of carbonation.  Overall, this is a decent oatmeal stout.

Also, there is the impression of apples. The flavours are strong but not overpowering, which is the case in a lot of stouts.  M - Thick, smooth and creamy, with a slightly bitter dry finish.

Taste is not at all like I expected. Not a whole lot of *roast* character, like a Guinness, but quite a bit of chocolate/black malt. Some sweet caramel, but mostly that dark chocolate. Fades to a roasty flavour, and then finishes with a few herbal, hoppy IBU's.  Mouthfeel is very full. Thick and creamy. Sticky on the lips. Like the Sam Smith Imperial Stout.

After helping my buddy close out his list, it was my turn to choose a brew from the famed list and this was my pick.

S: Very roasty, with dark chocolate, mocha and oats.  T: Starts with roasted grain and oat flavors and is quickly joined by mocha and dark chocolate. The balance and smoothness in the finish is remarkable.  M: Medium to full body, with a creamy texture; moderate carbonation.

Smell: The oatmeal is right up front and with a hint of chocolate and notes of plum-raisin, almost a prune.  Taste: Not overly bitter, but certainly packs a wallop taste-wise. Notes of oatmeal and cocoa chocolate come first, with a bit more of the fruity nature on the back-end. A hint of smoke and layers its flavors very, very well.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth, and coats nicely on the finish.  Drinkability: I'd say this is where it bogs down a bit, as I'd have a hard time putting too many of these back due to it's nature.

Taste delivered in a BIG way. Very smooth up front delivering roasted malts, chocolate, and dark sugars, with a heavy hand. Breaks way from sweetness to wonderful creamy smoothness all the way to the end leaving a taste of caramel, coffee beans, and chocolate on the tongue.  Mouthfeel was fantastic! It gives the illusion of being a big beer. The smooth creamy finish is so damn tasty!  This is gonna be a new favorite in my fridge.

I could definitely put down a few of these, although it would probably compliment a winter day better than an afternoon in June.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,pants678,3.87,"Pours a very deep brown from a 550ml bottle with a two finger head that retains. It's opaque and pushes pitch black.  Smells of roasted oats and hints of coffee. Maybe a tantamount of carmel, but not much, just something that eases it off a harsh edge.  Immediately, it's a bit sweet on the front end, brings to mind raisins and molasses. The sweetness combines with the trace amount of carbonation and keeps the charred coffee subtle. The oatmeal body is full, with a tingling, toffee finish. There's some bitterness, but it's not off-putting. The diversity in flavors is unexpected.  I have to say that it's not as thick or heavy as I'd expect for any kind of stout. It's nice to be able to put away a few of these. The complexity and carbonation keeps it moving, but not too quickly. This brew is worth savoring and dissecting.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ExtraStout,3.5,"Nothing special although I did enjoy it. Not too thick and rich tasting. For the price, I need more kick (ABV).

113,571,CarlP2,4.77,"Poured from a bottle into my tall ""test mug""  A- Dark black, no light coming through. Thick fluffy tan head, some lacing left too. Agitating the beer a bit brings back some head, even as the glass is nearly empty.  S- This smells like something gods would drink. Smells sweet and slightly fruity. Reminds me of ice cream and oatmeal. I also get a hint of cough syrup, kind of a sweet medicine smell. I wish I had an air freshener that smelled like this oatmeal stout.  T- Oatmeal, coffee, and a hint of chocolate. There is a slight bitter finish, maybe some hops. The balance of sweet and roasted with the finish is just right. This makes a great dessert beer for after a meal.  M- Medium to thick body. I almost want to chew it. Very smooth, like drinking silk. I'm still amazed after every sip.  D- I could sit around and smell this beer all night. I'd rather drink it all night, and I could easily do that. The taste and smoothness combine to make a very drinkable beer. And at 5% ABV, it won't knock me down if I put a few away.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,PintOHops,4.67,"Poured from a 550ml bottle into a wine glass.  Appearance/Smell - Appears a thick looking oil black color with about 2/5 of an inch of beige head, can't see through this one. Fair head retention, and leaves some broken spotty lacing. Smells of semi bright fruity citrus notes, grapes, apple, pair, raisins, a wonderfully rich toffee, chocolate, and caramel follow. Oats, wheat bread, lightly toasted malts on the finish, indulgent & sweet dessert like aroma.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of lite fruity apple, grape, and pair, followed by a rich blow of overly indulgent toffee, mild coconut, caramel, chocolate, molasses, and coffee notes. Pretty much has a dark chocolate bitterness, some wheat bread & oat flavors, as well as some nuttiness on the finish. Very sweet & rich overall, wonderful! Mouthfeel is hardy, smooth, silky, creamy, thick & full bodied! I think I even felt some sediment going down, I could be wrong though.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - This is an outstanding stout! I was blown away with the richness of this beer, as well as the outstanding mouthfeel! I loved everything about this Stout, this thing hits the spot. Nearly flawless, and did I mention that it was overly indulgent? I could definitely have a couple pints on a toasty evening, sitting in front of a fire, ah. The drinkability is very high on this one, and I highly recommend that you try this. Cheers!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Served in a chilled mug (I know, not ideal, but that's how they serve their mugs, so I tried to let it warm to room temp).  A: Rich, deep brown pour. Creamy, khaki head, 1 finger thick which quickly dissipates to a ring of lacing. Opaque body.  S: Slightly salty profile on the nose - soy sauce first, then the roast aromas take over by way of oats and barley. Just a growing hint of sweetness on the back end - perhaps dark fruit, maybe some molasses.  T: Good roasted flavors peak at the front - definitely getting the oats, some heavier roasted barley filling out the malt profile. A flash of sweetness as well, suggestions of dark fruit, molasses, maybe a hint of bittersweet chocolate. Then there is a smooth toast flavor that appears mid sip, tempered with that soy sauce like saltiness detected on the nose - it cuts through the gentle roast. Finish draws to a mild, nutty/oatmeal flavor.  M: Low carbonation; fairly smooth and slick mouthfeel.  D: Only 5% ABV means this oatmeal stout is highly drinkable. Good flavors and a smooth body make for quite an easy drinking stout.  Hands down the best oatmeal stout I've tasted. Another solid brew out of Tadcaster, England.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,augustgarage,4.28,"Not sure I have much to add after 1300+ reviews, but I figured I will pile on to the consensus. This was one of my introductions to ""craft beer"" around a decade ago...and continues to satisfy as an affordable widely available breakfast beer today.  Poured from a 550mL bottle into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass (although, this beer certainly warrants the purchase of a proper imperial nonic).  Liquid is almost black but for a hint of taupe or brown and is thouroughly opaque. A large creamy tan (almost khaki) head forms quickly and never leaves. Very good lacing. Lovely.  Aromatics include freshly roasted grain (malt, oatmeal), mild coffee, hints of cocoa; the sum being greater than the parts, creating a particular, albeit gentle olfactory signature.  Sweet on the palate with prominent roasted notes (a darker roast than is suggested by the aroma) accompanied by (surprise) oatmeal. Someone else mentioned ""coffee with cream"" and I think that isn't far off. The finish has a mild though lingering bitterness (though hop flavors are heavily obscured) which is joined by a hint of burnt toast (not a bad thing!).  The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with reasonable carbonation. Very high drinkability due to its lack of bitterness, low ABV, and unique flavors.  I know Samuel Smith is credited for the revivification of this style in 1980, but I can see room for improvement/experimentation. I would prefer a heavier body and a greater intensity of flavors (maybe more oatmeal, higher ABV?). Still, this is one I return to with pleasure and anticipation everytime. This is also just the thing to nudge Guinness lovers a few baby-steps forward beyond the macro world.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,Buebie,3.66,"Poured from a brown 550 ml gold tin wrapped bottle. No freshness date, but a code at the base of the neck of sh26h1. Into the pint glass it went, makeing a 2 inch tan fluffy head. The head slightly resembling that of a Guiness with a whipped cream like texture and very tiny little bubbles. Leaving behind a colar of retention and light thin lace rings and drapes. The color is black with some dark red glowing at the edges.  The aroma is somwhat light and not really a whole lot to report on this side. Some mild chocolate grain aroma, protein oaty aroma, and a mild charcoal.  The taste delivers as always, Some sweetness throughout, minimal, but present. Carbonation as well. More grains, chocolate and cereal. Plenty of oat flavors making just a little more body to the beer beyond the abundance of carbonation. A lightly toasty charred flavor. Finishing crisp and slightly bitter from grains with some of that sweetness carrying its way through all the other flavors. Definatly a solid brew. I've had some bad bottles of this before in the clear bottle version. Almost turned me off to this beer completly. But I got this as a gift and am back on with this beer.

Very low hoppiness, but distinctive malts which start very sweet and crystaly, and move slowly over the palate to well balanced smokiness of roasted barley, then lingers on the finish with an almost chocolatey sweetness.  Mouthfeel is round and extremely smooth, esepcially for a beer this dark. Carbonation is good, yet this is one of the smoothest beers I've had the pleasure of quaffing.

113,571,originalsin,4.28,"Alright. Here we go. The famed sammy smith's oatmeal stout. Just finished a bottle of their nut-brown ale, which I enjoyed immensely. Coupled with what I've heard about this beer and my experience with Sammy Smith as of the past 20 minutes I've got really high hopes for this beer. The pour is a really opaque black. I wish the head was more forthcoming for me, but it just isn't and it won't stick around either. Oh well. It's got a nice earthy smell- some notes of coffee, roasted malt...this beer smells silky smooth. Otherwise, though, the smell is sort of boring. I'm waiting on the oatmeal here but it doesn't come through as much as I'd expected it too. A lot of roasted grain, some dark dark chocolate. Molasses is prevalent for sure, and adds some really serious texture and depth to this beer. It's got a medium mouthfeel and is a relatively drinkable beer. mmm I've got a newfound love of Sammy Smith . beers.

We could get Guinness, Harpoon and the like in the Boston area, but this beer was also readily available, and somehow much more exoctic because it was an unknown. Guinness, even pre-markenting push, was a major player, and there was some status in drinking it (""I won't drink anything I can see through""). I always saw this beer on the shelves, usually dusty, but I think only tried it once. Now seemed like a good time to revisit this beer, that somehow seems to be taken for granted.  The pour is a wonderfully deep, dark black with a thick and creamy head that leaves a coating of lace rarely seen these days.  Malty, bready/oatmeal, some fudge and lightly of figs. Tastes very much the same.  Very smooth mouthfeel with a lingering finish.  This is the quintessential session beer.

With the pour comes a decent sized off white, light tan head that goes down fairly quickly after the pour but still leaves a small head for a while leaving some nice lacing down the glass. The aroma is roasted malt and chocolate. The taste is fairly the same with the chocolate and roasted malt and is kind of sweet. Has a sort of medium feel to it and is a little creamy. With a low ABV I think this one is very drinkable, seems to go down really fast. I would love to have another. Another top beer from Samuel Smith.

I even picked up some vanilla as it warmed up 2/3 way through.  The mouthfeel is lighter than I expected, but it is about medium body overall. The aftertaste, however, is somewhat creamy and milky with slight syrup stickiness. Could be a little less fizzy in carbonation.  Definitely gets better as it warms, the sign of a good brew. I didn't want to finish it quick, because I only had one...  Very satisfying finish - has a very light bitterness, like that of chocolate but not quite dark chocolate. Sweetness is present throughout and it makes you want more like a chocolate cake or milkshake or ice cream.

Drinkability: This one goes down very easily and enjoyably. A brilliant beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,goblet,4.22,"poured it out into a glass from a 355 ml slender bottle with a golden foil around the neck and cap.this is the first beer i came across that has it`s own review,history and serving suggestions on the back of the bottle.nice touch.  A,this stout is midnight black or as close as you can get to it, with a thick deep tan frothy head that diminishs almost completely although it does leave some web lacing .  S,the aroma is dark roasted malt slightly sweet like chocolate, perhaps coffee with a little milk and sugar some grainy oats and leafy hops .  T,medium to full body, malty it certainly has a sweeter then i thought side but not overwhelming . i can taste the oatmeal flavor the brew is aiming for and the hops and yeast are inviting .  M,it`s sweet and malty also pretty hoppy for a stout with a grainy yeast spice on the palate with a tad bit of a bitter dry after taste  D, this is the first beer i`ve had from samual smith. i have had it more then once so i do find it drinkable .grab a few of these and get yourself some pizza.cheers .",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,johnmichael712,4.1,"Appearance: Poured out of a 550 ml (18.5977 ounces my calculator tells me) bottle into a nonic glass. There is no freshness date on the bottle. This beer pours a dark mahogany color that has garnet highlights when backlit and it's a fair shade darker than the Highland Oatmeal Porter I had earlier and a lot darker than the Guinness I had yesterday. A large, thick, oatmeal colored (dark tan) head with a soft, pillowy texture jumps to the surface of the beer and showcases the good amount of carbonation in the bottle. The head remains in a light ring around the surface of the beer all the way down the glass and leaves an enormous amount of Belgian lace.  Smell: The nose of this beer is fairly subdued compared to other stouts I've had, but it still has a very malty character with strong notes of blackstrap molasses, oatmeal, and nuts. There is also a bit of a coffee-like earthiness, the earthiness present in brewed coffee as opposed to freshly ground coffee.  Taste: This is definitely a very sweet and mild-flavored stout, and it starts off with rich roasted malt and molasses flavors with light notes of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. This moves to a cola-like taste and carbonation midway through that fades to a moderately dry, sweet finish. In fact, this sweetness is present throughout this beer (thank the oatmeal for this), and there isn't much hop bitterness to speak of in the finish. Overall a fine tasting beer, I just wish it were a little more flavorful and balanced.  Mouthfeel: This beer is incredibly smooth, with a medium-full body. Just as I assumed from how readily the head formed there is a good amount of carbonation in this one (for a stout, at least), but it's not so much that takes anything away from the mouthfeel score.  Drinkability: This is a nice, pleasant, and easy to drink stout for when you don't want something that beats you over the head like some Russian Imperial Stouts do. The smoothness, the creaminess, and the fact that the taste is on the lighter side for a stout, combined with only 5% alcohol make for one superbly drinkable beer.  Notes: This is the third time I've tasted Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, and each time it impresses me with how easily it goes down. It isn't the best looking, the most flavorful, the smoothest, or even the best example of the style out there, but it's still a darn good beer. I prefer my stouts a little less sweet and a little heavier, but if you're looking for an introduction into stouts this is definitely the way to go.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,eporter66,3.44,"550ml Bottle into pint glass  My first Sam Smith was the Imperial Russian Stout, which I know most wont consider strong, but I found a boozy flavor which was a turn off. Seeing that this had a normal range ABV, and such great ratings, it was time to try again.  A - Great appearance, black body, with brownish thick 2 finger head.  S - Underwhelming, I did not get much aroma  T - A good flavor, roasted malts, some chocolate, but again, with all the praise, I was just not blown away. There is a bitter character in the back of the mouth, aftertaste. I have had better more robust stouts in my limited samplings  M - Average, a little heavy on the carbonation for a stout to me.  D - Not a heavy beer, so it has a good drinkability.  Having read all the ratings & reviews first, my expectations were too high. Definitely a good beer/stout, and I will buy this again, but I guess I was expecting to find the Holy Grail of stouts, and I just dont see this as standing out above the pack.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Gosox8787,4.36,"Poured from the bottle into a glass. The appearance was dark brown, almost black with almost no beige head. The aroma is roasted malts, but it is not overpowering at all. In fact, the smell is subtle, especially for a stout. The flavor, like the smell, is rather subtle. The roasted malts offer a nice roasted taste to counter the sweetness of the stout. The beer ends with a nice, clean finish. The mouthfeel is heavy with little carbonation. Drinkability was very high for this beer because the flavor was not overpowering and the alcohol content is low for a stout.  Overall, a good sweet stout that has good flavor and is very drinkable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,kingothewoods,4.03,Very dark appearance when you pour it out of the bottle into the glass. Tons of dark tan head which is thick like a cake sitting on top. Smells of roasted barley. The first taste you get is sweetness on your tongue then the flavors change as time goes on. The stout is heavy and definitely the roasted flavor. Very smooth not like a dry Irish stout. I really like this one with some oaty hints.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,dhd1491,4.35,"Pours dark brown-black with hints of copper around the edges. Aroma of sweet malts. Taste is mildly smoky and sweet, but not cloyingly so, with some flinty English water taste. Gradually toffee and raspberries pop through. Mouthfeel is light, non-oily, and alcohol is virtually undetectable.  I've not found many English beers that I would rank among my favorites. Not sure what it is, maybe the water. This one is the best I've tasted so far.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,Gambrinus1184,4.43,"Poured from an oversized pint bottle into a Smithwick's imperial pint glass.  A: Poured a lavish, dark brown, nearly black color with a three finger head of rich, creamy tan foam.  S: Smells slightly sweet, with hints of caramel, slow roasted wood and bread with a bit of an herbal, medicinal aroma.  T: Taste is super smooth and delightfully malted. A semisweet and bitter cocoa, oat and roasted malt characteristic comes through with a bit of hop induced bitterness in the finish. Sort of sweet and milky at times, with a semidry middle and finish.  M: Mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite creamy, but finishes a little heavier than a dry stout.  D: This very tasty, decidedly English stout is a true stout session dream. At a steady 5% ABV, with a great blend of sweet and bitter flavors, and that smooth, creamy velvety finish, it's really a very nice stout.  Samuel Smith remains the king of the English ales and stouts in my mind thus far. This slightly off-centered oatmeal stout is certainly no exception. Think of a hybrid Dry Irish Stout with a Milk or Cream stout added to the balance and you've got this stout in your hand. Now sip, and enjoy.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Hints of coffee and chocolate come out more and more as the beer warms. M: Thick, creamy but a carbonated body. Leaves bitter hop in back. D: I would end any and every night with this beer.

113,571,magine,4.26,"Purchased this bottle at a local deli/bottle shop. This is my first time trying this brew after reading and hearing so many excellent things about it.  Pours a black beer with a creamy tan foam head. Awesome looking stout, just as I expected. Smells almost like a coffee; nuts, molasses etc,. The taste is of oats, some chocolaty undertones has a great full bodied taste and mouth feel. Has a almost bittersweet finish. Some lacing on my pint glass. This stout looks, smeels and tastes delicious. One of the best stouts I have had. Very drinkable, almost like a dessert beer. I have not had several at a time so I am not sure how full this would make me. But an awsome brew none the less.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,PirateUlf73,4.48,"Poured into my large mug.  A: Very dark black, with just a little light able to shine through. Big tan head with excellent retention and lacing capabilities.  S: Lots of roasted malts on the nose. Hints of chocolate, a smidgen of coffee, and of course a soft whiff of oatmeal. I also pick up a slight earthy hop aroma, but it was struggling to make itself known.  T: There it is! A mouth full of roast, chocolate, and oatmeal. Big and sweet, yet balanced very nicely by earthy, woody hops. Flavors a melded beautifully.  M: Full-bodied with a very smooth, slick and velvety feel. Carbonation is on the lower end, and the whole thing finishes pretty clean.  D: A very balanced, very drinkable stout, and sessionable to boot!  There is a reason that this beer is one of the benchmark oatmeal stouts. It looks great, it tastes great, it feels great, and one could easily make a night out of a few. The oatmeal doesn't present itself as much in the taste as it does in the feel, giving it that classic ""chewy"" feeling.

Sticky lace that stays around well after the glass is drained.  Smell- Sweet roasty chocolate aromas. Toffee and roasted coffee beans, slightly bitter cocoa, little- to no hop presence.  Taste- Very sweet roasted malt with chocolate and oats-- black coffee. Maybe a little hazelnut. Malt overwhelms hops, but hops come out in slightly dry finish.  Mouthfeel- Creamy, slightly chewy (excellent)  Drinkability- When in the mood for an oatmeal stout, there's nothing better than Sam Smith's.

M - Slight carbonation bite gives way to smooth medium mouthfeel, finishes slightly dry  D - Moderate, certainly not the type of beer you would want to speed through, much better when enjoyed slowly giving it time to warm.

113,571,BacklitAvenger,3.77,"Appearance - It is more brown than black until it's there in great volume. Kinda worried me as it looked sludgey and stuff.  Smell - Smells sweet, candy-ish, with some toffee or roasted bits on top.  Taste - I prefer this one colder than most dark beers. Something has opened up with astringent notes here at the end, sorta the opposite of the smoothness I expect. But cold it's a good beer and cheaper than a sixer of barney flatts.The oatmeal cereal note is there, and we got some slight coffee. Mostly it's sweetness and malty roasted stuff with very little hop bitterness until it warms up. Could use some dark plum or fruit notes I think to balance the sweetness. Toasty alcoholic aftertaste, but not in a bad way. Astringent grainy notes in the finish, both of the sip and the bottle as it warmed.  Mouthfeel - Silky, voluptuous, but oily and viscous, not in a pleasant way. Heavy, but not too heavy. Still, of this beer this is the best aspect.  Drinkability - Not sure how many of these I could pack down. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fiend for dark beer, porter or stout or schwartzbeer. I'd recommend Anderson Valley Barney Flatts Oatmeal Stout.

Everything you smell can be tasted, and then there's a hint of chocolaty-coffee something-or-other. It leaves a sweet-malty aftertaste.  M: Again, this is also where it is more like an ale than a stout. Light and carbonated. Nothing objectionable.  D: Not a gulper. You have to take your time with this one.

S- A very deep creamy appeal to this one as i'm getting alot of chocolate as well as the advertised oatmeal. A bunch of roasted malt is a strong contender as well. A very small amount of coffee.  T- This is a very nice oatmeal stout with a huge creamyness, perhaps the most i've had from this style. A bunch of oatmeal & chocolate with slight burnt coffee. A nice amount of hops to balance all those dark flavors.  M- Medium to slighty thick in the mouth which I was not expecting from the look of the pour. Creamy as hell, smooth as silk.

113,571,SykDoc,4.07,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. It pours a medium brown and forms an almost 2 inch mocha colored head that reduces to a fuller lacing that eventually dissipates. When held to the light it is a very deep red.  The initial aroma is higher in yeast and oatmeal. As it warms, notes of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, oatmeal, leather and alcohol become more prominent.  The taste is a mixture of bittersweet chocolate, bread, and oatmeal. A certain hoppy level with some bitter coffee components also mix fairly well with the mild alcohol.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied and a bit light for me. A very mild bitterness sits on the tongue for a few seconds and resolves. It is smooth and not overly creamy and carbonation did not highlight the flavor, as much as it could.  Overall, this is a quite good beer and definitely a good oatmeal stout. I do feel there are some things that could be done to improve it but given the consistent quality, it isn't necessary.

Low head retention, and no lacing. Also, more body transparency than I'm used to seeing in oatmeal stouts. EDIT: Looking at the other reviews, I'm guessing that Wiseman Zach just poured this one shittily (rhymes with Italy). When he handed me the glass, it hardly had a head at all. Oh well.  Smell: Oatmeal, ripe banana, flowery hops, mocha, and spices. Much more fragrant and complex than other oatmeal stouts I've come across.  Taste: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, ripe banana... maybe that's vanilla. Prickly, floral, hops emerge midway through. Maybe some berries in there as well. The tasted has a much stronger roasted character than the smell, but they're nearly equal in complexity. Caramel and a little whiskey in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and not very thick or creamy. Kinda slick actually; definitely finishes dry. Moderate mouth coating. ABV feels a little higher due to the warmth and dryness.

113,571,OldRaysputin,4.83,"This is my first review and what better to start with than this remarkable oatmeal stout. To begin with I poured from a 1Pt 2.7Floz bottle into my favorite mug. Temp appx. 55deg.  Appearance: The stout pours into a nice dark brown boarder-line black. The head settles nicely after about 45 seconds, but continues to sit throughout the drinking. Overall, very good looking Smell: A nice robust chocolate scent with a mixture of roasted hints. Taste:Wonderful smokey tones rush forth and settle on the palate. Truly a Perfect balance of richness and drinkability. Mouthfeel: Not too heavy but just right. Almost a soft/silky feel Drinkability: I honestly have to say that this could possibly be my favorite oatmeal stout. Wait a few moments after each sip and savor the complex flavors that continue to dance on the palate. Each sip begs for another to follow. What a treat.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,superdedooperboy,4.4,"Enjoyed at The Pizza Joint in Evans, GA. The ""Beer-Me Tuesday"" special put this gem at $1.95 a bottle.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a frosted pint glass.  The black-as-night pour shows blood-red ruby accents when held to the light, being the only indication that this isn't a viscous pint of oil that happens to be capped with a thick, creamy head of dark tan foam. The head settles slowly but leaves little behind on the glass, which can probably be attributed to the excess water left behind as the glass thaws.  A delicate aroma wafts into the nose: a nice, though surprising, fruity-floral hop aroma melds with roasted coffee beans and dark chocolate.  A nice, full body is made velvety by the addition of oats in the mash. Espresso-like roasted malt flavors meld perfectly with a slight herbal hop bitterness and the delicious flavor of chocolate that is made ever-so-rich thanks to the smooth mouthfeel. A medium-length finish of roasty bitterness sticks to the back of the tongue.  Painfully delicious, going down easily yet begging for a slow sip to enjoy the rich, velvety, roasty nature of the beer. This is one of the first brews that I enjoyed in my foray into the vast world of fermented grain beverages, and one of the ones--if not the one--that made me realize that beer can be so much more than a pale, hoppy brew. Oatmeal stout still ceases to amaze me, and its near-extinction ceases to amaze me even more.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,KentT,4.38,"Excellent English Oatmeal Stout. Very mellow brownish appearance greets me upon opening this beer. Smell is very pleasant, like newly baked bread with a cinnamon smell. Upon decanting it to a fine Guinness ale glass, it tastes rich and mellow with hints of clove, oatmeal, and a nice, malty finish. It is strong but never has any bite to go with the alcohol. It's very drinkable for a stout. Less bitter than Guinness bottled (the only good versions for me were on tap and in the Draught bottles and Cans with the Widget). Mellow, easily drinkable, rich, complex taste, and easily quaffable. Too interesting to be a session beer. I would give Samuel Smith an A- for this beer. Makes me feel warm and friendly drinking one. Recommended for most drinkers.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,bonkers,4.05,"I poured from a 550 ml bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours black with ruby highlights. A big, white fluffy head forms that will just not go away. The nose is sweet with hints of coffee and black licorice. The black licorice really comes through on the first sip, the finish is sweet and crisp. A medium bodied beer with a wonderfull creamy mouthfeel. The beer is meant to be sipped, but I would not have a problem quaffing this one. A very good beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,wl0307,4.22,"Revisiting this lovely stout and now it comes in a brown, rather than clear, bottle! BB July 09, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass.  A: deeply dark mahogany to almost ebony hue, coming with a thick and tight light-tan frothy head with superb retention, on top of unknown level of carbonation. S: rather thick and dense, full of creamy dark chocolatey malts with a tinge of winey fruits upfront, almost like a Porter! A swirl brings up really aromatic roast-nutty and even slightly smoky theme of dark malts with a good density, featuring sweet coffee infused with maybe jammy raisins as well as aromatic hops. The aroma, I'm sure, is a vivid witness to the open-top fermentation tanks, for the slightly sour theme that mixes perfectly with the rich malty body. T: smooth, smooth, smooth... the lightly sour edge of dark Chinese dates and other stone-fruits skilfully underlines the oily and meaty rich maltiness with a really lengthy roasty&malty aroma (attributable to roast oats as well?) lingering on the palate... quiet in the aftertaste, but here a sweet edge of grains (oats then!...?) intertwines nicely with a decent level of earthy hop bitterness, crushed toasted walnuts, and semi-thick ""coffee-flavoured malty milk"" (?! But we have such a thin in Taiwan, actually). Really mixed and aromatic in the finish, mainly thanks to the dialogue b/w aromatic hops, fine malts and extra sour-fruity input from Yorkshire square fermentation! M&D: despite the smooth texture, the tail of each sip does reveal a healthy input of microscopic fizz, not a lot but still not as natural as a real, cask-conditioned ale. Having tried this bottled beer only twice now, I have to say this has already occupied a special place in my book, between the Stout and Porter categories. Highly drinkable is not the word - ""Quaffable"" is!  * Tasting Date: 31/07/05 Coming in a clear, 550ml bottle... wonder why this traditional and brilliant brewery would bottle their great beer this way?! BB May 06. 4 A: served in a jug, it pours a very dark brown to almost black hue, with a very tight, brownish head fading a bit too fast with little lacing. 4.5 S: the nose has lightly sweetish toffee, roasted barley, hints of black cherry and red-grapes(!) plus fresh longan fruits, and some whole-meal bread's note... overall very refreshingly fruity note against the backdrop of settled kind of perfumy hop aroma. 4 T: a smooth palate of coffeeish taste and roasted malts upfront, with chewy nutty malts and dark chocolate flavour at the back of the tongue, balanced by slightly tart, dark-fruits' flavour and finished with a dryish, lingering fruity bitterness in the long, yet clean, aftertaste. 4 M&4 D: the mouthfeel is very smooth throughout and not heavy judging by its nearly rich flavour--a very enjoyable and refreshing stout with a good fruity and nutty backbone.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,dananabanana,4.2,"A: Dark brown to black. One-finger head at first, recedes to a respectable layer of beige foam. Thick lacing.  S: Smells sweet and clean. Milk, cream, hint of chocolate. Very rich scent.  T: Roasted malts. Coffee flavor. Creamy, but a slightly bitter aftertaste. Slight alcoholic tang. A bit of soy sauce. Caramel aftertaste builds later.  M: Well-carbonated. The bubbles come on too strong for a second, but fade quickly. Creamy.  D: Gets sweeter as you go along. Very drinkable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,donkeyrunner,4.53,"Black with oxblood highlights. Large foamy beige head. Great retention and drippy lace.  Smells like roast malt, raisins, oatmeal, molasses and some subtle chocolate.  Bitter dark malt at first then sweet and creamy toffee, milk chocolate and more creamy goodness. The dark malt bitter returns again with swallow. Did I mention this beer was creamy? Silky smooth mouthfeel. Acquires a cola taste as it warms which is a bummer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Magpie14,3.88,"A: no complaints with this pour and glass. Poured a rather light shade of brown and once settled in the glass looked very dark brown with soft bourbon edges. Head was mocha colored, big, dense, and hung around just enough to be admired and then melted away. A good swiping of filmy lace at the rim of the glass  S: you know, the first thing I smell is roasted grains prominently barley. Oats are hidden with sweet cream and could be comparable to a few day old oatmeal cookie  T: well, so far I am enjoying the sweet creamy oatmeal with a glop of molasses, maybe a slight buttery aftertaste. As far as stouts go this ones flavors are somewhat hidden and subdued. As it warms I find the oats push through a little bit more and have a soft smokiness towards the end. I also get bitter chocolates, earthy/woody notes, and ever so soft metallic notes  M: has a good hearty body that maintains a push over medium. Body has some dimensions of creamy and slick. Sometimes the aftertaste gets a bit mealy for me, not sure what that is all about. Maybe the word I am looking for is starchy...  D: easily drinkable and is somewhat of a standard for the kind. I can see why this brew has high marks and it aims to please. But, I still find this stout timid in some regards",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,MunchkinDrinker,4.37,"A- Pours a very very dark brown. Lets almost no light through except for aroud the edges, where it's a very deep brown. Head is foamy dark tan that dissaptes slowly.  S- Smells beautifully of chocolate and what reminds me of Quaker Oats. Very rich and sweet.  T/M- Very thick and rich. The sweet smell is an undercurrent of chocolate and milky taste for the roasted dark malty and oat flavor. A tiny bit of hops makes its way into the aftertaste. Very very smooth.  D- Very easy to drink down, and the alcohol is not noticable at all and is low.  Btw, goes great with cake.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

One of these is plenty for me.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

A: Opaque brown-black with 2-finger, cookie dough head with amazing retention and several rings of lace.  S: Roasted dark malt, light metallic/mineral, and leafy herbal hops aromas are all present and blend nicely  T: Fulfilling combination of sweet and nutty toasted grains, oatmeal, and earthy hops complete a satisfying brew.

Leaves a pleasant roasted malt/coffee aftertaste.  M- Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Incredibly smooth. Has that signature powdery(fine grittiness) oat feel.  D- I really enjoyed this stout.

113,571,Oatsoda,3.76,"This Oatmeal Stout pours a tall dark chocolate milk-colored head of foam on top of a dark, nearly-black body with some red-amber on the edges.  It gives off a very mild aroma that I would describe as ""sweet-smelling"".  Toasty and pleasant, without any strong overwhelming flavors, it finishes with a subdued bitterness.  This Stout has a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The carbonation and body make it seem a lot lighter than its color suggests.

T: Roasted coffee - also hints of toast. Lighter chocolate that grows throughout - almost like eating a chocolate bar.  M: Creamy - chocolate really coats the tongue. Tight carbonation, but not over-carbonated.  D: Very smooth and easy drinking.

113,571,bkilpatr,2.66,"Poured from a 550 ml bottle into a pint glass. 01/24/09.  Pours nearly pitch black with almost two fingers of light tan head. The head slowly dropped to a thin layer, good retention. Aroma is of dark toasted malt and light milk chocolate.  Taste starts with roasted malt and is heavy with chocolate flavors. Slightly acidic quality, and an earthy or herbal taste. Some coffee and finishes with heavy cola-like flavors. Not entirely pleasant. Feel starts smooth and creamy, then hits with prickly carbonation. Drinkability is decent. It's not too heavy, but the acidic/cola-likeness of it doesn't sit well with me.  Overall, not something I'd seek out again anytime soon. Honestly it feels more like I'm drinking soda instead of beer. I'm just not impressed by this.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Reminds me of a sweetened espresso and cream  T: Slightly sweet but fairly dry. Maltiness is strong on the oat flavor. The tasting ends with a dry fruity bitterness to balance the initial sweetness.  M: Creamy, full bodied. Slick oat contribution. Still and great head retention.  D: A variant of stout that too few brewers produce. The flavor is not as sweet as a sweet stout and not as dry as a dry stout which makes it a great beer to enjoy several. However, balance has its price and few would rate this as their all time favorite stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Vengeance526,3.73,"550 mL bottle...  Pours a dark, almost completely opaque black color with a 1 finger beige head that held nicely for a while and left a considerable amount of lacing.  Aroma consists mostly of chocolate with a touch of caramel and some bready notes.  Taste builds on the aroma as you experience many of the same things in a more pronounced manner. Caramel, toffee, chocolate and maybe a hint of dark fruit all come through in the taste. Pretty good stuff here.  A very smooth feel but maybe a bit rich for some. I'd cap it off at one bottle per sitting but that is not to say I would not want another later on down the line.

The taste is sweet, a hint of cinnamon. with the flavor of a very rich stout to it. The mouthfeel is of cinnamon and brown sugar, again very rich.

The nose starts with an acohol warning, developing into a dark fruit, rich and inviting. The flavor of figs and dates bubbles acrossed the tongue, falling back into a complex flash of caramel malts and soft sweet oatmeal, before finishing with the brewery's characteristic granite finish.

Pour was dark brown with a nice, consistent 1/4 inch head with good lacing.  Smell was very much oatmeal, and chocolate?  Taste was great, beers like this are why I'm not a Guiness fan. Oatmeal, malts, and chocolate, and just the right amount of bitterness to tickle the back of your tongue.  Mouthfeel was good, light carbonation and goes down like butter...and feels about as thick strangely enough.

A dark dark pour with a nice creamy head and significant lacing, looks very appealing.

Smell: Very complex and interesting malty/bready.  Taste: Very smooth mouthfeel. Complex. I tasted coffee, caramel, creaminess.  Note: I loved this beer! I've been looking for it for a while, and it's been sold out, so I was excited when I finally found it. I wanted to try it based on the great ratings I've seen.

The light beige head was about one-finger size, with lacing reminiscent of soapy water.  Definite oatmeal in the front of the nose, which is good. Hints of sweet malt and dark chocolate. The non-oatmeal scents were sort of muted.  Toasty, sweet malt flavor domination. Good amount of oat flavor. Finishes with a slight wash of dark chocolate sweetness.  Great feel; this beer is very creamy without being too rich or (Heaven forbid) syrupy. This is sessionable if one is so inclined; I could drink this all night.  A very good stout.

S: Molasses/brown sugar, oats, and some coffee notes as well.  T/MF: Full stout flavor, the sweetness follows that molasses aroma, full-bodied and rich. The oats add some body as well, lending it a starchy (not negative; think comfort food) mouthfeel.  D: Very drinkable, and with low ABV, could have tucked in to this one for the duration.

Minimal chocolate brown head that dissipated very quickly. Left minimal lacing.  Smell: Roasted malts, hints of coffee and chocolate, and some kind of unidentifiable sweetness. Not bad, but nothing spectacular.  Taste: Smooth, and the roasted malts are definitely evident. There's also an odd aftertaste, almost an astringency. I would have thought it was just my bottle, but I've noticed other reviewers having noticed a 'chemical' taste. It's definitely a good tasting beer, but there's that little something in the background that tastes a little off.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth. A little too highly carbonated, but that's the only real downside. Nice and creamy, the way I like my stouts.  Drinkability: It's smoothness made this easy to put down. Only a slight bitterness at the end. That being said, the odd chemical/astringent taste remained throughout the entire beer.

Flavor is downright amazing. nutty, oaty, and a very nice twang of alcohol hidden in the crispness. Plays around in the mouth, sucks to the top of the palate.

113,571,TheDoorman,3.7,"Solid dark brown body with a persistent light brown head. Big aroma of roasted malts and rich dark chocolate. Palate is big roasted flavors like the aroma. Only problem is that the finish is a little flat, some more hop presence is in order. I also think the beer is a little under alcoholed. The malt flavors are too strong and especially given the limited hoppiness, could use a psuh in the ABV to balance it out. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with a tingling carbonation.  This is a very good traditional Oatmeal Stout. Its a great example of the style, but not terribly complex. Problem with this beer is simply that it is what it is. Stouts have come a long way in the last decade, and this beer is somewhat left behind.  Some may feel that this beer has retained its greatness, and I agree to a degree that it is still a fantastic example of the style, but given the stout competition, I cannot say this is a beer for which I am going to rush back.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Other hints of flavors are present like coffee and nut.  T: I love oatmeal stouts and found Sam Smiths very tasty but short of leaving a complex aftertaste that I expected from the smell and appearance. Sweet, roasted and toasty taste.  M: Smooth with good carbonation. Creamy mouthful.  D: Easy to drink with great taste and decent aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Medium-thick bodied, lightly carbonated with small bubbles  Drinkability: Easy to drink, but I tend to drink most stouts pretty easily.  Overall: A good oatmeal stout, but for the price not something special enough to keep on hand all the time.

113,571,bobsy,4.21,"I bought a whole gift pack for this beast, so the hope was that it would live up to potential...  At first glance the pour is black, but when held up to the light some red is visible at the edges. The tan head is prolific and laces majestically. Some berry in the chocolate and light roast dominated aroma. Quite complex flavours - chocolate and coffee are present (as expected), but there's also a pleasant fruitiness and nuttiness. Perhaps a tad too sweet though? Nice smooth mouthfeel with a small amount of carbonation.

I've had this beer ""resting"" in my bungalow basement at about 59F for the past 3 weeks. Time to wake her up...  Appearance: Very dark, nearly opaque with some ruby tones if held up against a light. Brownish/creamy head that held up well. Smell: complex roasted aromas combined with perhaps a touch of licorice or anise. I'm guessing the yeast strain is also helping out with some good aromas - wonderful to be sure. Taste: Fantastic! A great combination of some bitterness from the hops plus light bitterness from the roasted barely. Of course, being that this beer is uniquely fermented in that famous slate, there is certainly a mineral component that is absolutely beautiful, especially in the mix of all this. Mouthfeel: Silky smooth through and through, attributed to those oats I'm sure. Finishes just a tad dry, which makes me want more! Drinkabilty: Oh, why didn't I buy more than just this 20oz. bomber? It's been years since I've had this great beer. I guess since it has resided on so many good beer shelves across America for so long now, I've tended to take it for granted. But, I'm hear to sing the renewed praises (if they needed to be sung again anyway) for this special stout. It is truly unique, and such a pleasure to have.

The nose is of malts, oatmeal, coffee and chocolate with just a hint of a citric flavour. The taste is of the coffee and chocolate with just a slight bitterness on the finish.  The mouthfeel is full with some carbonation. It goes down very smoothly, often more quickly than I want. That leads to high drinkability and makes me glad that I have half a bottle left.

Of Sam Smith's lineup, I've only loved the Taddy Porter. I appreciate most of their beers, but I often end up feeling a bit underwhelmed and disappointed. This beer is a dry stout with a full, smooth feel. It's dark, nearly black with brown highlights at the extreme edges. The head is beige and leaves some lacing. The aroma is chocolate malt with that dry note that I usually associate with Irish Dry Stouts (oh, Guinness...). The mouthfeel is creamy and full. It's the best part of the beer.

T: Hints of coffee and chocolate. Nice acidity and bitterness mixed with the expected sweetness. 12 oz isn't enough for my paladate, after the last sip, you wish you could have at least 4 more (sips).

A perfect looking stout. Smell is sweet nuts, faint hop aroma, and oatmeal. Taste is roasted malt, piny hops, black licorice, leather, toasted oats, and a charred, bitter hop aftertaste that hangs around for a while. Velvety, silky mouthfeel has a crisp, dry finish. One of the smoothest beers I've ever tasted.

Good looking.  Smells of sweet malts, splash of honey, molasses, roasted coffee. Very complex, but it's very soft and extremely well blended. Smells absolutely awesome.  Brew starts off with a wave of sweetness (honey, molasses) followed by a nice roasted coffee bean flavor, then it finishes with an outstanding oatmeal blast with a dash of hops that balances the sweetness in the beginning. Outstanding.  The beer is medium/full bodied on the palate with a chewy, rich, yet smooth mouthfeel. It goes down extremely well, which I kind of expected from its low ABV, but either way it's a great oatmeal stout.

113,571,Bootscraper,4.87,"This particular beer was recommended to me at another forum, and I do not regret picking one up whatsoever. Served at about 50 degrees F in pint glass, listening to Jesu- ""Why Are We Not Perfect?"". I am wondering why this beer isn't perfect, because it comes damn-close. Here was my humble thoughts: Upon pouring, a very creamy, frothy, tan head a few inches in length arose to meet the top of the glass. This was very pleasing, considering that I presume this brew has very low carbonation. It sat in my glass BLACK. There was some slight deep red tendencies bouncing off my glass when I held it up to the light, but this beer is quite opaque. After a good 10 minutes, the head got down to about 1 cm, and stayed that way until it met the bottom of my glass. I was kinda disappointed in the lacing though, as there wasn't much of any at all. Poking my nose in the glass gave me a very rich smell of a sweet loaf of bread. The sweetness was composed from nut to molasses, and vanilla to honey ranges. Pleasantly subtle, I might add as well. The taste was pretty much the same as the smell, but now working in hand with the signature stout ""roasted"" flavor. It's not quite ""burnt"" hops either, which would usually come across too harsh in other more common stouts. Rather, it's present more as a coffee flavor... one that comes alive a little bit during the finish. I found slight hints of savory caramel throughout each sip as well. Not much in the way of an after-taste. Pretty damn-well balanced this beer is though, even if there is nothing extravagant going on. It's medium-bodied once it was in the mouth, and it was smooth as silk. Seriously, this is the quickest beer I have consumed so far for a review, and I could easily move through some of this like water on a hot summer day. That is quite remarkable, considering it's other stout qualities (I may have found my new favorite beer!). My only discrepancy, I suppose, was that I wish they could make this beer how it is, but with a stickier mouth-feel. No, it certainly is not a Miller Lite, but it came across as a bit thin for a beer of this caliber. Skip the pretzels, go straight for snackin' on some oatmeal chocolate cookies when enjoying one of these!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Mid-stream is more of the same, with some bitterness forming. Finishes with more of the trademark oatmeal astringency that I come to love w/ this flavor of beer. There is some of that acidity that I've seen in this style before that is not necessarily pleasant.  M - Moderate body - light for today's stout. Carbonation that was obvious in the appearance isn't as much in the mouthfeel. Little residue from the beer.  D - Easy to drink - ABV is not high for the beer style. Not overly filling by any means. Flavors are muted, so it wouldn't become a wear on the tongue.

113,571,yesyouam,4.78,"The Celebrated Oatmeal Stout is a deep, barely translucent, aubergine-colored ale topped with a huge, dry frothy head that looks the color of cinnamon sugar. The retention and lacing are tenacious. The aroma is of warm cookies, soft, sweet herbs and roasted malt. It's very soft and even. A soft, heavy texture slides down the throat. Despite the rich, sweet flavor of this, the tongue is left a bit dry. The first flavor is sugar and caramel. Then comes an herbal element that is somewhere between fennel and tarragon; perhaps licorice. The lengthy and marked aftertaste is of chocolate malt. Yes, there is a reason this is an old favorite.

113,571,bluemoonswoon,4,"Trying to knock off most (if not all) of what Sam Smith has to offer. 550mL bottle poured into an imperial pint glass.  One quarter thick, viscous and creamy toffee colored head. A pretty looking stout, ruby brown, a touch of black ink nestles beneath the head. This beer might just be radioactive because it is emitting some supernatural aromas. Like most Sam Smith beers very vinous, even a bit winey, hard water, rich and smooth caramel malts, dates and figs, cinnamon raisin bread. Tastes a bit like the Taddy Porter, a bit creamier though with more pronounced dark fruity flavors. Not very much oatmeal but it is there in places. Rather though this beer seems to be built on the fruitier aspects and is even slightly herbal and a bit earthy.

Dark brown / black with some ruby hints around the bottom edges of the glass. Relatively opaque. Head is very persistent, slowly fading into a thick film. Minimal lacing is left behind.  SMELL: Roasted barley malt and a bit of chocolate in there. The oats are also noticeable in the background. Nose is medium strength; not quite big enough to make a statement.  TASTE: Roasted barley malt initially, gives way to a smoky pure chocolate taste. Very nice. Oats are there too, but not dominant. A pleasant smoky chocolaty aftertaste arrives late and fades nicely. Good job.  PALATE : Medium-thick body goes down smooth with a slight bite at the end. Medium carbonation and finishes pretty dry.  OVERALL: A very good stout, very drinkable. I can certainly see why it's ""celebrated."" I would say it's not quite as good as the Tadcaster Porter, but definitely a great brew worth stocking up on.

Drinkability: For an stout, this one is defintley drinkable, although for the style there is definetley better choices, this one is still a good one to fall back on. Fairly sessionable for a stout.

It has a dark-roasted chocolate syrupy taste with a bit of sweetness, though the pre-eminent flavor was the feel of the oats in one's mouth and the subsequently incredibly smooth finish. The drinkability is slightly affected by the tiny bit of bitterness before the grains kick in, but the beer is as smooth as butter.  Fantastic, really.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,astrasday,4.15,"Poured into a pint glass. Rich, near black color with two finger tan head.  Coffee, nuts and almost a sweet apple scent follows through to the taste. Chocolate rings true in the finish. Very smooth mouthfeel with nice tight carbonation.  High drinkability and an overall enjoyable experience. Great beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,niz,4.42,"pours dark brown with tan 2 finger head that dissipates fairly quickly.  smells of smooth creamy chocolate coated christmas cake.  taste is very smooth and subtle, starts almost fruity with chocolate mocha setting in, followed by a silky roasted backbone and finish.  mouthfeel is a bit smooth yet a bit watery for an oatmeal stout, but not overly carbonated.  drinkability is definately high due to a modest alcohol percentage and delicious overall experience",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,germanbeer1,3.88,"Pours a dark black with a nice tan head, but not too thick. Good lacing throughout consumption. The most recognizable scents are coffee and roasted grains. The taste is overwhelmingly of coffee, but it is possible to detect some oatmeal taste. The coffee taste does a very good job of disguising the alcohol as well. It's a very good beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,CanuckRover,4.55,"Pours jet black with a thick, foamy espresso head two fingers thick and puffed out at top. Dense sticky lacings.  A nice subtle sweetness on the nose, like chocolate milk. Pleasantly understated coffee notes. It smells... great! If smooth had an aroma, this would be it.  Carbonation gives an edgy metallic note up front. Oat sweetness, nice milk chocolate with a hint of vanilla. Very balanced malt, fruit is noticeably abscent and there's a great roasted flavour in its place. A hot chocolate finish that lasts for ages.  Oh the mouthfeel! The oats really do their job, giving the beer a silky smoothness that is stylistically perfect. This stout really goes down a treat.  A great example of the style, one to savour.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,crazeddaffy,4.36,"Thoroughly hated this when paired with chocolate cake as a chemical taste pervaded; however, when drank alone it is quite good.  Poured into an oversized wine glass: A: Black as oil, no light penetration with a 1.5 finger head when poured. 1/3 finger head that remain with nice lacing.  S: Weird smell I cannot describe but somewhat chemical, roasted malts, dark chocolate, and oats.  T: Taste is exactly how it smells with toffee and an extremely light hop flavor that is barely distinguishable. No bitterness at all that can be too sweet.  M: Medium carbonation that is watery and creamy at the same time.  D: Tasty when not paired with chocolate cake. Extremely sweet and drinkable",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Pretty impressive coloration - very dark, almost black, opaque with a creamy tan/brownish head that was about a finger and a half in thickness. Good lacing throughout the drink.  Aroma of dark chocolate, sweet oatmeal with cinnamon and a bit of hop bitterness, although a bit muted. Did detect a bit of funkiness in there, although I wasn't too sure of where it came from.  Taste was good but not great. There was a thick dark chocolate flavor, the sweetness of the roasted malts with the hops coming in right away.  Mouthfeel was good for a stout, creamy and thick and definitely left a slick feeling on your tongue.  Overall a good brew, but not as good as Young's Oatmeal Stout. I wouldn't pass this brew up but I'm not going out of my way to get it. It's session-able (if that's a word) but I wouldn't have more than 2 in a night personally.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Drank from tulip glass, poured from some huge bottle (22 oz. or some such).  a: nice, but not as thick and satisfying in color or head as I found their Imperial stout, for example.  s: really rich and oaty and malty.  t: fills the mouth with flavor, oats, perhaps coffee, though in my opinion, it's a bit thinner on flavor than other stouts.  m: good, but due to thinness, not its best feature (again, I think a stout can feel thicker and more satisfying than this, but it's still high in this area)  d: I'll want more; it's tasty and drinkable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,elfcounsul,4.67,"It passed the no light test, so it was safe to drink. Head was tan and just enough to let you know it is to be appreciated on many levels . The aroma was of roasted malts.  The taste was like drinking a licorice stick. It brought back fond memories. It was just sweet enough and the malts were not overpowering. I am not a big malt man, but I can make this a regular among my APA's and Wheats.  It's an easy drink that doesn't demand a finely tuned taste to appreciate.

I taste hints of oatmeal, definitely some sweet dark chocolate, roasted malts, and a little bit of coffee.

The aroma is black licorice, oatmeal and roasted malt. The taste easily outdoes the nose here. There's initially some fruity flavours, cherry, apple skins, sweet and sour black licorice flavours in the middle. Good roasted barley flavour is there and some hops are faintly detectable. The finish is dry as expected. There is some nuttiness and some oatmeal characteristics too. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy, milky. Moderate to heavy body and a low, soft carbonation. As expected.

Low to moderate carbonation. Not really any roasted astringency. No alcoholic warmth.  D-Good drinkability.

113,571,mwrseeley,4.05,"Poured from a handsome 550ml bottle, purchased from the LCBO as part of a Samuel Smith boxset (pint glass included), this oatmeal stout featured a foamy beige cookie of a head. The body was opaque.  On the nose I detected coffee and feedmill-like molasses. The taste reminded me of the same and was sweeter than I expected, and, therefore, not as enjoyable as I had hoped for. A dry stout is more to my liking. I gradually took to the taste and by the last sip I was enjoying my drink.  This gently carbonated beer is rich on the tongue, nicely balanced and has a long finish.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,largadeer,4.5,"Appearance: Black in the glass, nearly impenetrable to light, with a thick head of tan foam. Head retention is solid.  Smell: Baker's chocolate, brown sugar and hints of coffee. Oatmeal cookie with raisins as it warms. Really nice.  Taste & mouthfeel: Right in the middle of sweet and dry, some sips bring to mind dark roasted coffee, while others make me think semi-sweet chocolate. Oats lend a velvety smooth texture, and the moderate level of carbonation only reinforces that. This stuff only grows more complex and interesting as it warms, bringing out notes of toasted nuts and dark fruit; I recommend letting it warm up a bit before uncapping the bottle.  Notes: A real classic of the style.

T Really great to start, some light cocoa and brown sugar comes in here which leads to a plethora of creaminess, vanilla, molasses, and a bit of carbonation, and finishes so well with a touch of fresh roast that provides a slight bitter taste.

Caramel and burnt toffee, some oats and roasted malts. Muted, though pleasantly so. Smooth, sweet caramel and dark chocolate up front, mixing with a burst of floral and earthy hops. Very smooth and velvety in the mouth. Hints of coffee and milk sugars, with the oats reserved, but still present. Carbonation is felt, nice and bubbly, gives a nice contrast to the full, smooth body.

113,571,TheycallmeTim,4.33,"Poured from a 550 ml. bottle into an American pint glass.  A--Jet black body that gets slightly rubied toward the top in the light. Strong finger and a half chunky mocha head left decent lacing.  S--Not a whole lot here, maybe some roasted deep subtle malt along with mild coffee. Fairly bland on the nose, but then again, it's a stout.  T--Fantastic. Plenty of smooth dark roasted flavors with a strong milky creaminess. Finishes with just enough bitter oomph and floral roundness to remind you there are indeed hops in the beer. As this beer warms, though, it really opens up, with a bloom of almost cherry cloying up front and, I don't know what else to call it, beef jerky (with a touch of tobacco) on the back end. Complexity level goes sky high as it warms, so I'd say serve this just below room temp.  M&D--Super silky, minimal carbonation makes for just right porridge for this bear. Not heavy, either--a super balanced beer that wears its age on its sleeve in the way it comes together tastewise. Truly refined, and a humdinger of a beer.

113,571,biegaman,4.1,"Sepia toned black with splotches of dark burgundy when held to the light. These highlights are well concealed but astounding when they do bleed through. This stout falls on the light end of the dark side of the beer spectrum. A respectable proportion of both foam and bubbles, all cocoa stained, sit idly on both the top and sides of the glass.  The aroma required some warming before revealing notes of dry, well-roasted malts and stale black coffee. There is just a hint of bittersweet cocoa to give a faint impression of chocolate syrup. I'd also accept the notion of molasses. The bouquet is far too simple, however, to make any really convincing deceptions - this is largely just the smell of roasted malt... but it's good!  The flavour works on similar lines. It is simple and straightforward. It's enough to conjure the thought of certain flavours but not enough so to truly be deceiving. Fortunately these nutty, chocolaty impressions definitely come forth more with some warming.  What I might think I'm tasting in roughly this order: stale cold coffee, hazelnut, cocoa beans, and finally, molasses. This is a cast of tastes that work well together; they can sort of play off one another and combine for a very sweet profile. It's one that'll certainly have you taking big mouthfuls at a time - and plenty of them.  The chalky, mineral-rich Yorkshire water doesn't exactly work to your favour when you're trying to brew something to be velvety smooth. Especially not a beer with this high level of roast. But you'd be well in line to call this 'bittersweet' and more than fair in saying this mouthfeel is creamy and silky enough to pair to its rich flavours.  If you're not exactly 'new' to craft beer than chances are good that you've already a stout that is fuller, richer, and a heck of a lot more decadent than this; I can think of handful in the same oatmeal stout category. But Samuel Smith is who we have to thank for reviving the style after it had gone extinct before the First World War and considering the success their Oatmeal Stout has had at it, I think that's got to say something.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Pours like a coffee syrup with a monstrous yellow cake head. The head started at about 3 fingers, but disipated to a nice film after about 3 minutes. Nice lacing and solid retention.  Aroma has hints of mocha, vanilla bean, wood chips, with some faint alcohol.  Lots of earthy undertones here, with a nice roasted malt that runs from milk to slight coffee to a slight sour finish. There is nice balance with a very slight hop bitterness, keeping the sweet in complete check.  Mouthfeel starts with some nice viscosity on the tip of the tongue, which quickly flattens out. Beer is very thin, and almost quenching - making you want more and more.  I really enjoyed this - and think it has amazing drinkability and flavor for a relatively low ABV brew.

Beer is dark brown in hue but appears black in the glass and is not quite opaque when held to a light. A voluminous fluffy tan head rises easily two fingers and needs to settle while I wait to finish the pour. Minimal spotty fuzzy lace present.  Scent is roasted grain, bitter coffee, molasses and soft dark chocolate.  Flavor is coffee, dark chocolate, thick sweet molasses and roasted grain. Hops are minimal.  Mouth is prickly and nicely carbonated on the front of the tongue and milk like as it is swished in the mouth. Medium weight; not a heavy or viscous stout.  Drinkability is outstanding. Regretted only having one bottle on hand.  Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout is a classic English stout which I first became acquainted with over a decade ago. It's been a couple of years since last I enjoyed this beer.

This is an outstanding, nourishing, thick, delightful stout. This is one of my favorites from years ago, and my opinion has only solidified. This is an outstanding stout. The beer is thick, creamy, pours a thick dark color barely impenetrable to light, with a thick off white head. This beer laces like mad. The aroma is first rate. Caramel malts, dextrin sweetness, toffee and chocolate notes, and just a well balanced and enticing aroma.  The taste is just great. There is a definite oatmeal backbone to the beer and it comes through in its consistency. The beer has wonderful toasted and roasted dark malts, it has the slightly charred grainy notes, and the caramel maltiness to make it a delight. There is a slight butterscotch flavor to the beer that detracts ever so slightly, but this one is well worth seeking out. There is also a milkshake quality to this beer, and it has the characteristics of a lactose-milk stout. It isn't a strong ABV beer, and the mouthfeel is a bit oily, with an aftertaste that is not overly sweet, more like a refreshing, complex, and interesting thick chocolatey after dinner drink.

113,571,josiahschlender,4.1,"I love the hefty, classy bottle. Pours nice, too. Quite dark with a bit of light getting through. Adequate khaki cap that leaves a persistent ring.  Should have let this one warm longer before pouring it. The nose really opens up with some warmth but in my haste I poured it right out of the fridge. Lots of sweet dark grains. Very definite molasses coming through. Maybe a bit of coffee in the dark roast aromas.  Lots of molasses on the flavor as well, which is really tasty. The sweet grains are well complimented by dark roastiness and some hop bittering.  Feel is good, but maybe could have just a bit more oomph. Definitely very smooth and silky, just what I'd expect from a beer of this style. When I took some swigs when cold it had a bit of a carbonation bite that disappeared after a while.  Moral of the story: don't drink your stouts, especially this one too cold. Actually, don't drink just about any beer real cold.

A hint of sweetness from the oats pokes its head in too.  The taste is pretty good. It's not as sweet as your average American oatmeal stout, but it's very smooth and roasty. The oats definitely aide that smoothness.  This stuff is much better as it warms, too. The mouthfeel goes from being slightly thin to almost a little chewy. Beyond that, it's the most silky-smooth beer I've ever had. Remarkably smooth, even.  This stuff isn't the best oatmeal stout I've ever had, but it's very easy to drink. It is, however, better than I remember it from years past. I'll be buying it again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,UGADawgGuy,4.1,"Before you read the following review, please bear in mind that I haven't sampled the full spectrum of English stouts (or anything close to it).  Appearance: Cool! This stuff is almost black, with a hint of root-beer brown around the edge. An average pour yielded a fleeting, one-finger khaki/brown head, which dissipated faster than I had hoped. Fine lacing throughout drinking, although it's heavy enough to sink into the brew within 30 or 40 seconds.  Smell: This is the only moderately underwhelming aspect of this beer, in my opinion. The aroma is generally...well, mild. And it belies the flavor of this fine brew. I smell something honey-ish, with hints of molasses and oats.  Taste: I almost gave it a 4.5, but I changed my mind after several quaffs. This is sweet-ish, syrupy, oat-y goodness in a glass. I also detect coffee, toasted malt, brown sugar, and some oats. I like what I taste here.  Mouthfeel: Fairly dense and viscous, although I kind of hoped it'd be even thicker. Goes down slowly, leaving a tasty trail down my tongue and throat.  Drinkability: Solid. With its relatively low ABV, I feel like I could drink two or three without any regrets. I would consider this kind of a cool-weather beer, but it's not dense and warming enough to preclude me from drinking one or two in the summer.  Overall, this is a pretty great beer. If you're into stouts but haven't tried a lot of ""unusual"" ones (i.e., if you're a Guinness drinker), I entreat you to try one or two of these. Good stuff.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Beer-Zombie,4.03,"this brew pours up black with a nice frothy, tan head. the nose is dark malts, cherries, oats, hints of vanilla. the taste? Ahhh the delicious watered down malt taste like almost all dark English Ales (*sarcasm*)...taste is the same as nose minus the cherries. slight metallic sweet malt finish, watery medium bodied, low to medium carbo. Im not a fan of the watered down English Ale taste but this surely beats Young's Oatmeal Stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

S - Nose is dominated by molasses and caramel, toasted malts, and hints of biscuit and maybe even butterscotch.  T - Caramel, toasted malt, oats, and biscuits. Quite malty and sweet, with a hint of bitterness as it finishes.  M/D - Mouthfeel was medium, but left a little too much stickiness for my taste.  Overall, the caramel flavor kind of overwhelmed me.

113,571,OtherShoe2,4.2,"Poured a deep black with a tan head that lasted through the entire pint. Outstanding lacing -- a ring with every sip.  Smells of deep roasted malt/grain sweetness, some licorice notes.  Where to start. Sweetness from the oats/grain comes through, but is balanced by deep dark roast flavors. You have a little coffee, molasses, and bitter chocolate, as well as licorice and herbal hop bitterness.  This is a silky smooth one, no rough edges, with decent, tongue-coating characteristics. But the lingering flavors are not cloying in any way.  This is a nice beer. I've had some oatmeal stouts are brewpubs that I consider much better, but this one is a winner. At face value (and not style, comparisons, etc.), this is a terrific beer that you can have more than one of and not feel like changing gears.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Perfect  S- Smell was a bit metallic but that was overcome by sweet, roasted malts and of course, oatmeal. Not too complex but pleasing  T&M- Taste is light for a stout but that oatmeal makes it very enjoyable for me and gives it some consistency. Mostly sweet with nothing strongly bitter.

Even after sipping slowly, it retained a nice thin lacing to the last.  S: Coffee, Molasses, Malty  T: Definitely a complex flavor. The taste is what you would expect from the smell but then you get a really interesting balance of sweetness and bitterness. I hadn't detected fruit in the smell but there is a dominant fruitiness to the taste that then leaves you with a bitterness that was a little too sour for my taste. &#8232;  M: It is smooth, creamy and feels clean in the mouth. There was a little sharpness to the carbonation hitting the tongue - could have done without that. It felt to thin at the end.

T: It had a creamy smooth dark roasted malt flavor at its base with brown sugar, some dark fruits and a bit of bitter hops. There was a modest oat flavor but it was well hidden.  M: It was medium bodied with a modest amount of carbonation and a bitter roasted malt presence on the tongue. It finished dry and bitter and the bitterness lasted deep into the aftertaste.

113,571,Reagan1984,4.41,"This beer is just a delight to drink every single time. It had been a long time since I've had one and I was excited to get the opportunity again this week.  Beer poured with a wonderful tan head that rose from beneath the surface of the black beer. So much structure and so creamy. Just a beautiful beer.  Aroma was of roasted malt. Not quite burnt notes. Coffee, roasted nuts and a slight mineral (earthly) tone.  Flavor was just really soothing and pleasant. Coffee, Cream, some roasted goodness and a nice lingering flavor with a great deal of depth. In beers like this I often go back and forth deciding if I am tasting Coffee or chocolate. This certainly seemed to clearly lean on the coffee side of life, but the chocolate notes were present.  The mouth feel was very creamy and smooth. Just a delight to drink and enjoy. I made myself a promise that I wouldn't wait as long to have my next Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout again.  Excellent Beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,PerzentRizen,4.77,"Samuel Smiths Oatmeal Stout is a sweet, easy to drink excellent example of the style.  I poured mine into an imperial pint glass. This beer is black - but not thick like Ten Fidy. The head was full and creamy and seemed to dissapate a little too quickly. I think I might have my beer a little too cold to sustain the head.  The aroma is fresh and malty. I can smell the sugar in this beer.  The mouthfeel is full and inviting. I can tell that a four pack of this could evaporate quickly if it didn't cost so much. I would say this is the best beer I can get in Mississippi.  The taste is sweet, malty, and a little fruit after taste. A light hint of hops rests on the back of the throat.  This beer goes down smooth. Enjoy this one all you want. I would call it a very sessionable oatmeal stout.

113,571,SimplySinister,4.05,"A - In a dimly lit bar this brew appears as an opaque void of darkness; though not cloudy or completely opaque when exposed to light. A fair amount of carbonation and a non-existent head.  S - Full-bodied and complex. Although a oatmeal stout, it has some characteristics of a cream stout- namely the sweetness. It contains malty, chocolaty (mocha), and somewhat smoky notes.  T - Strong, and full-bodied. Mocha and cream come through strong, finishing like a powerful black coffee. The aftertaste is a bit lingering, but for a brew of this nature its to be expected.  M - A good amount of carbonation, and somewhat smooth. The brew is a bit sticky. As I've said, the aftertaste is a bit lingering.  D - Not very- this is a meal of a beer. I can't see having many of these during a session. Without any doubt I would defiantly have this beer again, but sparingly and in moderation.  Its a good beer to be sure, but its a little pricey.

The appearance is a very dark brown, if not black, with a nice tan head on it that doesn't quite fade as I drink it, and leaves a lace down the side of the glass.  The smell is of roasted malts, caramel, coffee, maybe some barley. It reminds me a lot of chocolate, perhaps dark chocolate given the slight bitterness that I detect.  The taste is awesome. There is a sweet malt flavor, as well as a bitter cocoa flavor, which finishes with a roasted barley as I swallow. The complexity in this is great, and it is what I have come to love about stouts. I paired it with some chocolate cake and coffee ice cream and it worked well with both.  Mouthfeel is very clean. It leaves no clinging residue in my mouth, and there is a nice bitterness after I swallow. It still holds a nice carbonation to it, while not being overpowering.  This is a great beer. I would save this for a finisher, maybe with dessert or on its own later in the evening. I don't think I would have multiple in one sitting, however.

There is also a taste of sweet milk chocolate on the front end that comes out. A very good oatmeal stout  MF - Oh this is a rather creamy stout.

Look: Poured into my pub glass a dark brown with a three finger caramel cola head with dissipation to a 1 finger head that lingers.  Nose: Roasted malts, slightly oaty. A hint of bitter chocolate?  Taste: Well balanced and smooth on the pallate, all the oat and bitter chocolate notes come back in the taste.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy, just like I believe an Oatmeal stout should be.  Drinkability: Superior drinkability. If, that is, I'm feeling like a slightly sweet beer, I could probably drink this all night. But on a college budget, I can't really afford to.  This was the overall best in show at our recent tasting of 11 totally different brews at my place among about a dozen people who aren't normally beer drinkers outside the Macro stuff, but considering some people came back for more.

The beer is very dark, almost completely black. There is roasted barley and a sweet nose, although the smell of this beer is pretty mild. The first sip blew me away. I like stouts, but realized just how limited my knowledge of them was when I tasted this one. The sweetness of the rich dark malts is so tasty, and the finish hits you right in the back of the tongue with the roasted barley. It feels heavy on the palate, but not too thick.

Purchased in the 550ml brown bottle.  Cracked this one open and it poured a viscous midnight black into a smooth pint glass. When held to the light the body did have hints of amber and copper to its color - but when held in hand... this one practically sucked the light from the room. The thick creamy head had wonderful retention, and settled into a nice thin halo above the brew throughout the entire drink.  The aroma is immediate here. Deep rich tones of chocolate, caramel, and coffee all pull through, along with hints of vanilla and all the malty goodness.  The taste is smooth and carries the aroma into its palette; with the beginning tastes of chocolate and caramel deliciousness, the ending notes of, what I can only describe as, bready tang (maybe hints of dates in there?) compliment it well. I could definitely feel the carbonation, which felt a tiny bit too much for me in this stout. I don't think I could do more than 2 or 3 of these in a sitting, but very good nonetheless.

Smelled of chocolate, fresh bread, some malt.  Has a slight metallic bite to the taste. Very thick and chocolate-like, a little dry. Very heavy drink. Wouldn't recommend this bad boy with a meal, it's a meal in it's own right.  Overall, pretty good brew.

Nose was a little roasty, chocolte, toffee and maybe some espresso. The taste followed with the nose. It was rather malty and much deeper than previous bottles I had consumed.

113,571,Ben4881,4.1,"Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout Samuel Smith Old Brewery  Appearance: This oatmeal stout is dark brown, almost black. However, hints of red emerge when light is shone through the glass. A decent off white head recedes rapidly creating intermittent snowflake patters on the surface. Spotty lacing remains after the head clears.  Smell: The sweet smell of toffee, roasted nuts, molasses, and coffee are detectable. Nothing extraordinarily bitter, most of the fragrance is sweet.  Taste: A mild, sweet, malt flavor is present up front. A hint of alcohol is detectable in the finish with traces of chocolate, toffee, and roasted caramel. The aftertaste is dry with a roasted coffee flavor.  Mouthfeel: Sammy Smith's Oatmeal Stout has a thick, medium to heavy body with noticeable carbonation that foams nicely.

Big fluffy two finger tan head drops down to a centimeter and lasts the whole session and leaves some lacing along the way.  Aroma is sweet overall. Tones of chocolate, coffee, and a slight fruitiness.  Flavor is of roasted malts, lots of chocolate and some coffee. Some fruit towards the end that isn't quite distinguishable because the hops come through and coat the tongue.  Mouthfeel is extremely smooth. I would say silky. Excellent carbonation.

The presentation was immaculate - fluffy tanned head, jet black. But I found the taste a little one dimensional. A straight out bitterness from the lips to the back of the palate, a simple roasted quality, a bit of cocoa, and not a whole lot else in terms of complexity. I did like the muddy slippery feel to it though  The bottle expires in Nov 08, so wasnt out of date, but wasnt fresh either.

The aroma was very light and understated. Not sure if it was an older bottle or not. Light hop aroma and some very light bready/nutty malts.  Very clean tasting. A bit nutty malts and a little taste of cocoa/chocolate in the back. Subtle smokiness or spice?  The mouthfeel on this brew is great. Very smooth with a nice level of carbonation.

113,571,malcontent,4.61,"Have I seriously not reviewed this beer? Let's see if an old favorite holds up as well as I hope.  As I should hope for anything containing oats, the head retention (for a good two fingers of the stuff) is outstanding. The opaque, black body is perfect for the style. This is a standard-setting appearance.  A bit of toffee, obvious roasted quality and a mild milky sweetness form the aromatic profile.  Soft butterscotch, restrained milk chocolate and an even-keel roasted bitterness are perfectly balanced to create the benchmark for this style. It's every bit as good as I remember although I don't remember the lingering fruit aftertaste. I would have to guess it's the product of the yeast strain they use at the Tadcaster Brewery.  Not nearly as heavy as many would think with a perfect balance of creaminess and carbonation. An easy choice for a session brew.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Not much in the smell department. Slight fruity smell after a couple of tries. Mouthfeel was good, like a stout should. Smooth but one-dimensional. The taste was bland with an aftertaste of fruit.

S: Bold, rich chocolate with some mild coffee. A hint of buttery diacetyl comes through, as well--all those beers from the Tadcaster brewery seem to have it.  T&M: A pleasant sweetness with toffee and butterscotch gives way to some lightly toasted chocolate malts. A general earthiness runs throughout, as well. Very tasty. Body is medium with faint carbonation that makes for a silky smooth taste. Finish is long and lingering with notes of chocolate and roasted malt--most excellent.  D: This is a highly drinkable oatmeal stout. The sweetness never becomes cloying, the flavor is well-balanced and interesting, and the feel is top-notch.

113,571,lordbrad1,4.3,"Appearance: Dark reddish hue that you can't really see unless you hold the glass about 1-2"" from a light bulb or open window. It's fucking dark. Nice thick head that slowly dissapates leaving little to no lacing on the glass. Has a very inviting ""dark beer"" look to it when it's in the glass.  Smell: Smoky, roasted malt smell is very dominant. There's also a sweet caramalized sugar smell that is lying just below the smoke, and roast. It reminds me of Amish friendship bread, or bananna nut bread (home made of course.) All in all it has a very nice aromatic quality to it.  Taste: It tastes good lol. Again the smoky roasted smells come through in the taste. Come to think of it I dare say that the comments on smell can pretty much be interchangable with the taste. Smoky, sweet, and very satisfying.  Mouthfeel: It's a heavy beer. It coats the tongue which bugs me a bit, but it's not a bad thing just my personal preference. It goes down very smooth, and has a very pleasant after taste. You don't get the weird alcohol aftertaste you get with many dark beers. I find that ""chewing"" the beer a bit really sets off the flavors, and smells. It's carbonated just right. All in all it's pretty pleasant.  Drinkability: It goes down smooth, it tastes great, it would pair perfectly with a sunday roast, or other heavy meals. You can definately put down 3-4 without much effort, but I don't think I'd go so far as to call it a session beer.

Finishes with a mild bittersweet dark chocolate flavor. Medium to full bodied. Smooth, and the flavors endure very well.

S - Roasted malt, but subdued with dark cherries, currants, and chocolate coming through. The fruit contributes to somewhat candy-like scent. Faint aroma of coffee in the background.  T - Amazing. Not typical stout flavor; I assume the oatmeal is really making the difference. Starts off fairly sweet and the full roasted malt kicks in. There's something earthy mid-palate, maybe oaky. Bitterness begins near the finish, but dies off quickly and leaves a dry, coffee-like aftertaste.  M - Also remarkable; sparsely carbonated, and medium to heavy bodied. There's also a very oily quality unique to this beer, a product of the oats I assume.  D - Very drinkable, especially considering the style. Bitterness isn't overwhelming nor is the beer's body.  I've had a couple of other oatmeal stouts in my time, but nothing about them has stood out; then again I never drank them with a review in mind. This brew makes me want to explore the style, but a lot of what I've read leads me to believe Sam Smith's might be as good as they get.

It has a very pleasant scent.  Taste is very complex. It's like cocoa wheats and toasted oats, with caramel apples. Sounds strange, but it went over well.  This is very smooth. It goes down very easily. You could polish off four of these things real quick if you aren't careful.  All in all, this is a good, solid stout Maybe a little heavy on the toasted oats.

I purchased it from the HiWay 66 Liquor in Claremore, OK, in a clear glass bottle. The appearance on this beer was beyond exceptional. It was extremely dark, black you might say. I held the bottle up to the sun, and the sun went away!  The smell was more complex than I can describe-burnt malts, hops; a definite beer smell that was both inviting and skunk-free despite the clear bottle. Very Nice!  The taste and mouthfeel are really where this beer excels...Taste was of dark roasted malts, with some hints of coffee, caramel, and lots of hops! It was silky smooth, and I could taste almost no alcohol.  The mouthfeel was very thick, almost chewy; this is much hardier than I am used to for sure! The aftertaste was also awesome: the dark malts and coffee hung around from swallow to swallow, and left me wanting more and more the more I drank it.  I definitley reccomend this beer to anyone looking for something outside of the usual stuff available. It is a bit pricey, but it definitley worth the money.

A medium to heavy body, this was incredbily smooth and creamy (almost milky) with the sweetness and dryness mixing together. There is a coffee/cocoa malt taste and coffee-esque drying backbite, but the oats and something like caramel/honey (something viscous and syrupy) smooth it out and also make it a little sweet.

The signature sam smith's apple-like yeast tones blend well with all of the other flavors, making this beer delicious, not too heavy, and extremely drinkable... but sadly, not as affordable as I would like.  Excellent beer, a prime example of the style... if a new beer drinker would want to try a stout, give them this.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Thiestru,4.78,"I typically drink this beer out of a 12 oz. glass mug.  Appearance: Extremely dark - I'd say it's black. Very respectable, creamy head. This is a rather thick beer, and it leaves quite a noticeable residue around one's drinking vessel.  Smell: Slightly chocolatey. The scent of malt is strong. Very promising....  Taste: Utterly fantastic. It has a strong malt character, again with the slightly chocolatey aspect. It never gets too sweet, however, and it finishes up with a little tang. Also prominent is a somewhat burnt flavor, as should be in such a beer as this. Every swig is completely satisfying, like it's a whole brew in itself. Wonderfully balanced. Great oatmealy aftertaste that lingers for some time.  Mouthfeel: Very thick and hardy, and also very smooth.  Drinkability: High. However, it is a stout, after all, and so is quite filling. I have no problem drinking three or four of these in a row, though, so if your stomach can handle all the epic beer it's receiving, your mouth will certainly be able to savor more than one of these mighty stouts in a sitting.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Mazeraski,4.83,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a mug.  A - Near opaque chocolately black in color, letting no light through. A 1 inch tan head persists for about 10 minutes that leaves sticky lacing clinging to the glass. As my roommate says: ""that looks like 10w-40.""  S - Aroma of sweet molasses malt, combined with the slightest hints of coffee, a certain nuttiness, roasted chocolate and an oak-like brown sugar.  T - The first wave to hit your tongue is the molasses taste, with hints of darker chocolate and brown sugar. The molasses and brown sugar persist through the sip, with a twinge of coffee and carbonation near the end, all with an oatmeal backdrop present throughout.  MF - One of the smoothest mouthfeels in a brew I have encountered. Smooth silk-like creamy, medium to full-bodied with the slightest hint of carbonation lurking in the background.  D - One of the most drinkable brews, with a lower ABV. However, if you don't have a slightly larger stomach you will fill up slightly quicker. Hell, if I could afford it I would drink this every single day. Hands down, one of my favorite (if not my favorite) beers of all time.  Notes: Simply one of the greatest tasting brews I have ever had. And until now I hadn't reviewed it for some reason. Please, pick up some and treat yourself to one of the finest crafted beers.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,robbyc1,4.53,"Had it from a 12oz bottle at a nearby restaurant.  The beer pours iwth a deep clearish chocolate color, black but not quite opaque. Just perfect for an English oatmeal stout.  Smell is roasty with deep chocolate nose plus a hint of the oatmeal influence.  Fabulous, this is what an oatmeal stout should taste like. Deep malt with a tight bit of sweetness, just enough to get you to want more. Not overdone, well balanced. No sign of hops as it should be.  Mouthfeel is smooth with easy drinkability, could have 3-4 of these for sure. Overall, as long as you get a fresh bottle, a great choice for dinner with a burger or fish or whatever you like. Not overpowering like most stouts. Just right.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,Rayek,4.39,"A great oatmeal stout. Very balanced and extremely drinkable.  A: Dark brown, bordering on black. Rocky tan head isn't too big, but has decent retention. Only a little bit of lace. Probably the beer's only weak spot.  S: Dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses and brown sugar. Quite sweet overall, but not overly so. Oak quality seeps in as well.  T: Yet more chocolate, plus a nice burnt bitterness. Burnt flavor is more woodsy than charcoal. Very balanced bittersweet flavor overall, with a certain bread-like quality. There is also a hint of acidity. Finishes somewhat dry in the mouth. Bitterness lingers for a little while.  M: Thick body feels great. Maybe a little too much carbonation.  D: I could drink a bunch of this. Too bad it's so expensive. I always keep a look out for it going on sale.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,wcudwight,4.21,"As black as the darkest of nights. Large tan head holds well and leaves behind lot's of sticky lacing. Aroma of sweet chocolate, nuttyness, and a touch of roastiness. The flavor is where this beer shines. It has so much going on for 5%. Roasted malts and a neat fruitiness. Almost reminds me of those chocolate covered raisins. Slight nuttiness and a yeasty flavor that I guess comes from the oatmeal. Silky smooth mouthfeel and somewhat creamy. Very easy to drink. Easy to session and still quite tasty. I've passed over this beer countless times in beer stores and now I wonder why.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,AKBelgianBeast,4.41,"A classic staple.  Sammy smith's oatmeal stout pours a deep deep black with good fluffy off white head. lace in nice. The nose is the weakest part of the beer with some malt smokiness and a coppery smell. Taste is defenitely the strongsuit here, and is immediately a roasted malt flavor that is huge with great smokiness and a wonderful burnt meatiness that sits well through the middle. The finish has some hops, but not enough to be bitter. Very silky mouthfeel through the middle, but still good carbonation. A grainy feel towards the finish detracts a little bit. aftertaste lingers smoke. Drinkability is superb, as there is a lot of flavor here for 5% without feeling abrasive or too soupy. Overall a fantastic brew by sam smith's. Defenitely one of my favorite cabin brews! I would love to clone this someday. Great beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

S - Faint smell of bananas, ginger bread  T - Molasses, coffee, a good bit of maltiness  M - Mouth feel is good. A modest amount of carbonation, and a thickness that is just right  D- Very drinkable, but probably limited to one or two at a sitting. It's very filling, like drinking a loaf of very tasty bread",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,SIRIUS2,4.21,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass.  Dark brown color, carefully poured produced a light brown foamy head at about 1/2"" of depth and left good lacing down the glass. The smell yields some nice but faint aromas of dark roasted malt, a hint of coffee, and some additional aromas of lighter malts. The taste is this brew's strong point. An even mouthfeel, slightly chewy and very creamy, and a complex mix of malty goodness combine well with the relatively light carbonation all add up to an excellent experience. Samuel Smith's typically produces high quality brews and this is no exception. Very good.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

S: Some roasted malt with a touch of sweetness. The smell is not overpowering like it is with some stouts, this one is more subtle.  T: Dark roasted malt, a bit of bitter dark chocolate, with a subtle hint of sweetness. It's smooth and milky creamy. The flavors are rather subdued. The hop presence is ever so slight.  M: Medium bodied, even a tad on the thin side for a stout.

S: Oatmeal, banana, and caramel malt notes. T: Dry, sweet, roasted malt. Medium roast coffee notes. Oatmeal, banana, and semi-sweet chocolate too. As this warms, molasses and caramel come to the forefront. Very nice over a wide temperature range. M: A surprisingly light body. Nice carbonation on the tongue. Smooth with a dry acidic bite at the end. D: Nice complexity and very easy to drink...could have pint upon pint upon pint of this stuff!

113,571,hustlesworth,4.85,"A- almost completely black, has a small amount of burgundy highlights around the edges. it some ways i looks nearly the color of a black plum, then again maybe the spring sunshine is playing tricks on me. huge spongy tan foam is aerated and full of air pockets and little bubbles. it's a real lace monster too and it compresses down to a thick creamy disk and never really goes away.  S-sweet cream, rosated malt, stone hard water, spiced bread and dark fruit, plum, raisin, toffee, maybe a little molasses. there's a savory side as well with meaty roast pork, and smoky grilled mushrooms. earthy herbal hops, fresh bread and biscuit mingle with soft coffee and cocoa aromas making kind of a burnt chocolate chip cookie.  T- much more semi-sweet chocolate chip flavor then aroma, and very very watered down coffee (not to say the beer is watered down-- it's def. not), buttery oatmeal with brown sugar, resinous hops add balance appearing in the middle and lasting through the finish. dark black cherry, prune, and raisin soaked in brandy and bitters. as it warms woodsy, oak, pine, and tobacco, rich soil and compost, very earthy, very natural, as if this baby came out of a magical spring in the forest or something.  MF- mildly powdery feeling from the oatmeal lends a definite creaminess to the body and also adds somewhat of a cooling effect, like the feel of mint. medium-mid low carbonation is perfectly on the level. this one's thick and rich, coating and resinous.  D- full of pure natural flavor, one of the things that appeals to me most about sam smith is the taste of the water. i wish i could get it by the gallon. all their beers seem so classy and traditional, and are entirely drinkable. this oatmeal is no different.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Half inch head that lasted about 5 min, laced very nicely  S - Nothing less than what an oatmeal stout should smell like: chocolate expresso, milkiness, oats and chocolate malts, all in perfect balance  T - Tastes as good, if not better, than how it smells. Very well balanced, creamy, and rich in flavor. I love Guinness but this is like Guinness X 30!  M - Full bodied and lightly carbonated. Silky smooth and creamy to coat the palate in a cocoa shower  D - I would say this is a highly drinkable. There isn't a whole lot of alcohol so one could drink a couple of these an evening, but I would rather enjoy it than drink in quantity...this stuff isn't too cheap! ($3.55/bottle)  Overall, this beer is one of my all-time favorites after just having one of these and I'll definitely be heading back for more. This is an oatmeal stout lover's stout.

S: Mildly sweet with a fair amount of chocolate and a hint of coffee. Quite a bit of roast is present as well, along with a light earthy hop character. Sweet oatmeal is present in the back.  T: Very well balanced, this beer opens with the roasted malt and the mild cocoa and coffee and oatmeal sweetness in perfect harmony. This beer is medium bodied, big enough to hold the flavors together while light enough to be truly refreshing. Mildly bitter on the finish with flavors of oatmeal, chocolate and raisins lingering, this is smooth on the palate with light carbonation. A touch metallic on the finish (iron?), this is the only flaw I can point to here. The oatmeal does take the edge off the roasted malt bitterness.

A: Poured a very deep brown with a tall thick brown head about an inch thick later reduced to about half an inch. A few dark brown highlights when held to the light. very appealing.  S: Chocolate, dark malts, faint smell of alcohol, not really remarkable, but smells quite nice for a stout.  T: Chocolatey, very sweet, smoky roasted malts, coffee like aftertaste, very little bitterness, and very few detectable hops, no detectable alcohol. This is pretty tasty.  M: Very smooth and creamy, exactly how a stout should feel, just a hint of carbonation, very nice in the mouth.  D: Pretty heavy beer, pretty much a meal in 18oz form, but a very good meal nonetheless.

T- The taste was good, pretty malty. It's got kind of a coffee taste to it. Pretty solid though. Somewhat sweet throughout.

113,571,johnnnniee,4,"03/06/2008 I've always been afraid to buy any of the Samuel Smith products because of that clear bottle they come in. So today I stopped at the local and the oatmeal stout had just arrived and was still sealed in the case box. There's no way that one is light struck, now is the time to try it!  Pours a solid dark brown with fluffy off white head that laces itself on the way down the glass. Aroma is faint chocolate and caramel. Taste follows the smell. Mouthfeel is medium thin, creamy, and drying. The chocolate taste lingers after each sip. Decent brew, definitely not like the American oatmeal stouts I've had. This one is much more sessionable. I could drink a few of these.  Revisited on 12/13/2009 I ended up with a Sam Smith Gift pack at a holiday party Yankee swap so I thought I'd do a better job reviewing this beer. Beer pours a deep dark brown with the faintest of ruby highlights when held to light. Large fluffy mocha head sticks around forever and laces the glass all the way down. Smells of molasses, oatmeal and a hint of chocolate. Taste is filled with caramel, molasses, chocolate, a bit of dark fruit. Finishes kind of dry with a lingering subtle roast bitterness. Mouthfeel is just short of creamy, medium body and carbonation. I actually think I like this a bit less than the first time I reviewed this. Its a decent enough beer, but nothing special. Maybe I just enjoy the less subtle American version of everything. My score reflects the first time I tried this.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

The bitterness wasn't overwhelming at all, nor was the alcohol very apparent.

Finishes with a bitter roasted coffee flavor and mild earthy hop bite along with bittersweet chocolate notes.  M - Medium bodied with pretty lively carbonation.

Head is 2 fingers,frothy like steamed milk/root beer, coffee ice cream brown, retains to about 1mm. No lacing to speak of overall.  S- chocolate, some roasted coffee, little toasty, sweet malt flavor. Very pleasant aroma that stays consistent and doesn't dissipate.  T- Sweetened black coffee, as if using brown sugar/sugar in the raw, little bit of scorched caramel. Recedes into a slight tang/sourness/bitterness on the finish, semi-dry as the sweetness lingers but not too much.  M- Very creamy, viscous in the mouth, coats the tongue and the active carbonation contributes to creaminess while at the same time having almost coke soda crispness.

At least two fingers of tan head that has some good retention and leaves a little bit of lacing behind.  A lot of malty sweetness in the smell with chocolate notes.  Like the nose there is a big sweetness here. A combination of sweet malts and the sweetness imparted by the oats comes together. Chocolate notes are there also.  Great mouthfeel on this one. Oats always seem to give a stout a nice mouthfeel, but this one is exceptional even considering that. Smooth, silky, creamy. Full-bodied but not overly heavy or dead. The mouthfeel alone would make me want to try this beer.  Pretty drinkable beer. Tasty with a great feel.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

I love the thick, velvety, chewiness of this beer.

Makes the first sip anticipation mouth-watering.  Very smooth and rich as it goes down-all of the aromas are pleasant in the mouth along with a bit of toffee/coffee. I dont get too much body initially as I taste it, but it is full when you are able to take it all in. The finish is nice and smooth too and leaves a great taste in your mouth that isnt too strong-makes you want to drink again.

113,571,Gehrig,4.48,"""I keep drinking malted milk, just to drive my blues away."" The opening lines form Robert Johnson's classic blues song ""Malted Milk"" poured forth from me on the phone one night when describing the smooth goodness that is Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout. While I sometimes break into this verse when discussing other particularly good beers, especially good Belgians, it all started with Oatmeal Stout, a standard bearer for delicious beer in my estimation.  The head is a little thinner than expected, with a finger of mocha froth topping a dark brown body with ruby outlines--beautiful. Those nose is fine but not pronounced enough, with roasted malt emerging with coffee and some caramel. The taste is fantastic, a delicious admixture of coffee, caramel, lightly roasted malt, and just the right amount of chocolate effortlessly blending. It's easily one of the best tasting stouts I've had.  The mouthfeel does much to make this perfectly drinkable, holding the carbonation in delicate balance with the fairly sweet, smooth, creamy texture. I find that I rarely have two of these back-to-back, usually buying just one at a time to savor. Yet enjoying two or three of these in succession would be a cinch. It's the easiest stout to drink there is, malted milk masquerading as stout. A gem.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Thick tan head reduces to a light froth, leaving a solid sheet of lacing.  Aroma of chocolate malt and coffee with a slight sweetness. A hint of hops, but you have to search for it.  Slams your tastebuds with a rich full flavor of roasted malt and pronounced oat nuttiness. Mild hop balance in the middle with a sweet finish.  Thick, full body with light carbonation.

113,571,morimech,4.03,"Poured a dark black with a two-fingered tan head that had excellant retention. A thick cap eventually forms and great amounts of lacing is left in the glass as the beer is consumed.  The smell is oats, chocolate, banana and roasted malt. A very inviting aroma. The granary and fruit smells is a nice combination.  The taste is mostly malt with chocolate hints. It has a sweet quality that isn't for everyone. It is full bodied with a chewy and smooth quality. This beer will fill you up. The more I have the harder it is going down.  It took a long time for me to finally give this beer a try. The packaging just didn't look appealing. The beer started off great but the more I had the less enamored I became. One of these is enough to satisfy my appetite.

Low on hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is great. Very smooth and thirst-quenching.  This is a great beer, especially for the winter. I imagine myself at a British pub enjoying this.

T: Smooth mild taste with most notable characteristics of diacetyl caramel flavors and residual sugars providing sweetness. It is not crazy sweet but I personally prefer dryer stouts.  M: Thin silky smooth body, probably light medium body.  D: While texturally appealing the residual sweetness takes away from the drinkablity, as does the relatively bland flavor profile.

S - Dark roasted malty goodness. Sweet to the nose with Carmel overtones.  T/M - Saaa-mooth, rich and creamy. The initially approach to the palate is full bodied, expanding upon sipping and filling the mouth with a smooth complexity. The finish is well, smooth again, with earthy toffee infusion that makes you put the glass down and slowly take in the flavors.  D - Highly enjoyable, 1 20oz bottle was just perfect for a nightcap.

The head sticks to the sides throughout.  The smell is slightly metallic / acidic almost like coffee.  The taste is not unlike a milk stout with the bit of creamy sweetness that comes through. A flavor I quite can't put my finger on, I want to say maple or honey hits pretty good but is not over the top. There is enough acidic bite to the brew to balances out the sweetness  The mouthfeel is slick to slightly oily. It doesn't have the weight of most stouts, but it is enjoyable.  This brew is highly drinkable, damn near addicting. The carbonation is just right and the flavor sticks to the tongue and roof of the mouth.  Overall I highly recommend this beer.

Smell: Smell is of roasted malts, toast, nutty.  Taste: Being my first oatmeal stout, I find it a little unique compared to other stouts. Obvious roasted malts that have a sweet quality; notes of brown sugar and even has a subtle coffee-like quality. Also seemed to taste a little oak-aged. These attributes are not too overwhelming on the palate.  Mouthfeel: A bit smoother compared to other stouts IMO. Medium-bodied.  Drinkability: Unique IMO. A lot of flavors jump out, but it doesn't make the beer confusing to the mouth. Drinkable.  Overall, I'm pleased with my first oatmeal stout experience and will seek out others for comparison.

The scent of sweet roasted malt was most present. The taste followed as well with only a bit of bitterness. It went down sweet and wet with a medium body - not too heavy and not too thin. This is a nice switch from the stout of a Guiness. This is also a bit more sweet and malty than Gray's.

113,571,ElGrecoVerde,4.38,"On the seventh day, God sat back and cracked open a Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout.  Great looking beer. There's something to say about looking at a seemingly pitch black liquid and seeing traces of bright red painted through it.  The smell is mostly roasted flavors and burnt chocolates. It's also pretty bitter, which fortunately is not overly reflective of the taste.  Normally bitter tastes in beer turn me off, but it works well in this one. It's only slightly bitter, but the kind you find in dark chocolate. If that's a problem for you, let the beer warm up a bit, and the rest of the flavors really do come out. I know a lot of people hate the thought of warm beer, but you can truly tell a great difference in this one.  It's amazing that this beer kick started the new Oatmeal Stout trends, because there's little room for improvement here.

S: A big baked bread aroma up front. Roasted malts, chocolate and toffee. Fairly simple, but spot on for a stout. T: A big malt character. A sweet smokey, chocolate, and coffee flavor. Maybe a little too bitter/sweet from the chocolate character. A touch of a mealy/oats flavor, and a touch mineral like as well. M/D: A medium body, that is very rich, creamy, smooth, and well carbonated. This is incredibly easy to drink.  One of the definitions of the style. This has a great flavor and drinkability. Even with age, coming across the pond and then sitting on the shelf for a while this still holds up well.

Subtle notes of oatmeal accompanying a light malty sweetness.  T/M: At a time when it's en vogue to overdo every aspect of a beer's flavor, this stout banks on subtlety and grace. Tastes slightly sweet, with notes of chocolate, oatmeal, and coffee. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected, but not too watery.

In this case, that's a good thing.  The carbonation is perfect and the taste is what it should be for an oatmeal stout--smooth but not sweet, not creamy-dreamy, and not flavorless. I can't believe I'm rating a beer this high for what it's NOT, but it's just done right. I don't think that's an easy feat, and is increasingly uncommon.  As an imperial stout fan, I rarely enjoy non-imperial stouts, and very rarely enjoy oatmeal stouts, but this one's a winner. In fact, I think I enjoy this beer better than the Samuel Smith imperial, perhaps because this exceeds my expectations whereas the imperial is disappointing.  Lastly, maybe I'm lucky, but I've never had a problem with ""skunked"" Samuel Smith beers, in their dark brown bottles covered with foil tops and packaged in cardboard.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Morey,4.46,"I love this beer!  Poured out of the bottle into my Samuel Smith's pint glass a jet black in color with a nice 2 finger tannish-brown head that settled to about one finger after a few minutes.  Smells of coffe, chocolate, and burnt sugar. The head sticks every side of the glass and with every sip.  The taste is a little bitter at first but finishes with a rather sweet silky smooth taste. A great stout...Highly Recommended!  Morey's Bottom Line: Samuel Smith's beers came highly recommend from a good friend of mine, and their Oatmeal Stout and Nut Brown set the standard for their styles.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,jar2574,3.71,"Poured from a 550 ml bottle. Jet black beer with a great two inch head. Tiny bubbles, but they take quite a while to settle. Nice coating on the way down.  Typical oatmeal stout smell. Nothing remarkable there.  Very smooth mouthfeel, with less roasted malt taste than I'm used to in a stout. I like it, the roasted malts aren't so overpowering.  That said, the taste isn't mind blowing or anything, it's fairly run of the mill. Nothing disagreeable. Malts and oatiness. Didn't catch any sweetness or hops, really.  Very drinkable, especially for a stout. Nice work. Great session beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,mooseisloose,3.13,Bottle smell is of sweet malty molasses with hints of brown sugar. Pours to a brown motor oil that lets no light through. Head is dark tan. Taste is very notably malty with a prevalence of oatmeal and semi sweet chocolate with a slight but not overly roasted flavor. The mouthfeel is good with sufficient but not too much carbonation. Not much hops at all detectable. This is a very sweet brew. For my taste is needs some bitter hops for balance. This is definitely a dessert beer and would go good with (or on top of) vanilla ice cream. In my opinion I have to rate lower on drinkability due to the lack of balance and excessive sweetness. One of these is sweet enough.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,tkeHijacker,3.3,"A: Deep dark Black with amber highlights.Thick creamy off white head that dissipates quickly, leaving very little to no lace. Bubbles still coming up.  S: Deep chocolaty malt smell, slight oat nuttiness.  T: Roasted chocolate, light flowery/fruity bitterness, sweet and smooth oat nuttiness present but not overpowering. (some reason my taste buds give me an almost grape flavor in there.  M: Medium to heavy body (more on the medium side though), smooth enough that you could take nice big mouthfuls at a time. Nice carbonation.  D: Goes down smooth, but too heavy in the stomach to have more than one (550 ml) in a sitting. Higher ABV would be a nice complement to the flavor experienced here.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,deltatauhobbit,4.03,"Pours a very dark brown, virtually black. Lots of head and retains itself for quite awhile.  Smells of roasted malt, caramel, hints of coffee and possibly even some chocolate hidden away.  Taste is smooth and creamy, quite sweet coming from the roasted aspects of the beer with chocolate being more evident than from the smell, the sweetness stays with you long after drinking.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,demcorhip,3.68,"One of the beers that originally got me interested in exploring the diverse realm of craft beer. This bottle is at least a year old, having sat in my beer cupboard for too long.  Pours black, very mildly and finely carbonated, yet manages a tight pale tan head, which displays pretty good retention. Thin sheets of lace grace the inside of my Samuel Smith glass.  Creamy oatmeal, a hint of treacle, some vinous scents as well, hopefully this wasnt forgotten about for too long. Mild roast quality, hints of chocolate chips and hazelnut coffee. Mild earthy and slightly woody hop character also present.  This one may have sat forgotten for slightly too long. Predominant fruity, vinous character from oxidizing malt almost overwhelms the finer qualities of this beer. Taste quite similar to the nose, but the things i really love about this beer are somewhat muted, the creamy oats and hint of nuts, the treacle, chocolate, and roast are getting ready to leave the main stage to play second fiddle. Earthy hints of decaying leaf and a mild woodiness appear at the finish, along with slightly smoky wisps of dark roast coffee.  Somewhere between light and medium bodied. Very mild level of carbonation, fits the style and does not detract from the still tasty grains and hops. Nice interplay between the oatmeal, nutty and treacly malts, and the roasted barley. Just a slight hop kiss to add another layer of depth to the experience. Unfortunately starting to show signs of oxidation with its vinous notes.  Still surprisingly drinkable, hasnt gone too far yet. Creamy yet slightly dry, light in body yet rich in taste, although certainly not to the level of bigger, badder assed stouts. Even while passed its prime this stout still demonstrates its quality. Do not cellar this beer for any significant period of time, respect it and enjoy immediately!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Ig0r,3.77,"The immediately noticable thing about this beer is the smell; as soon as I opened the bottle a slight sweetness was in the air. The pour gives a tall, thin, brown head that dissipates down to almost nothing but a rim of bubbles. The color is deeply black, fully opaque in a pint glass. The full smell is of dark malts with that sugary sweetness.  Not much stands out immediately in terms of taste, some carbonation is present, and the feel is a bit watery but very smooth. It leaves a bit of a doughy residue with a lingering sweetness.  Considering the color and smell, I was expecting more flavor and a thicker feel; however, this seems to be a reasonable drink compared to other oatmeal stouts.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Nickls,4.1,"Admittedly, I have not enjoyed too many oatmeal stouts and have only recently begun seeking them out more after trying Samuel Smith's take on the brew.  Overall the appearance was akin to most other stouts/imperial stouts that I have tried, so it looked nice to me. (Poured from bottle into standard pint glass)  Smell was enticing, and had a pleasant nutty, toasted aroma.  Very suprised by the taste, a touch of sweet alongside traditional smoky stout flavors. No one element overtakes another.  Mouthfeel was smooth over the tongue and palate.  Drinkability is the only thing that didn't stand out as much as other attributes. However, it's a really good beer, and served as a good starting point for trying oatmeal stouts.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ccrida,3.96,"550 ml bottle poured into my Samuel Smith's Imperial pint, the Oatmeal Stout is a dark garnet with a medium tan head, tight and creamy leaving decent lace.  Smell is fantastic, tons of vanilla with some chocolate.  Taste is a bit on the sweet/tangy side (heavy oats), vanilla and chocolate, with only a slight roast. A classic example of the style, but exaggerated and not my favorite. For example, I much prefer Full Sail's Humma Gumma, which I just had earlier tonight, a bit more rounded and stronger.  Mouthfeel is super smooth, slick and creamy. Medium body.  Drinkability is OK, but that classic Sammy Smith's tang is just too much, and this generally drinks much stronger then only 5% ABV. Would make a fantastic cologne though!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Aichelberger,4.25,"What's the old adage that ""you can never be too rich or too smooth?"" This one definitely falls into the rich and smooth category. As Oatmeal Stouts go, they can be a bit overwhelming. Like SS's other beers, however, this one takes a lot of taste and packs it into a very drinkable package. Dark brown, with a decent head that disappeared quickly but left a nice tan lacing all the way down the glass. All malt (dark toasted grain) in the nose and the taste starts with the same ""dark roast"" taste, but balances nicely. No change as the glass warms. And no perceptible alcohol taste. Very nice. And the best part is that you could enjoy more than one in an evening. Excellent!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,baos,4.32,"From notes.  Bottle into favorite Mason jar.  A: Pours dark brown with a nice 2 finger head. good lacing and good head retention.  S: Dark maltiness, coffee, and burnt caramel.

113,571,THEBEERBAR0N,4.11,"Served from a chilled bottle poured into a pint glass. Head is thick and tan, about 3.5 fingers from a hard pour. It took a good 3-4 minutes for the head to subside with some moderate lacing left behind. The beer itself is exceptionally dark, midnight black even when held to the light.  The smell is a bit lighter than I had hoped, but still is rich in roasted oatmeal, cream, hints of chocolate, and burnt coffee.  It tastes fuller than the smell might indicate, with the burnt coffee, chocolate, and roasted oats coming to the forefront and then a slightly creamy roasty slightly sweet finish that is qute nice.  This beer has a remarkable feel. Silky smooth, only light carbonation which balances perfectly with the soft and full texture. My surprise was in the finish, where it becomes much lighter and doesn't leave much if any residue.  I could easily see myself drinking these all day due to the rich body yet surprisingly smooth and light finish.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,TheodorHerzl,4.4,"Pours a nice deep black with two fingers of tan head. Head had great retention for the entire beer, and it left nice lacing on the walls of the pint glass. Great nose for an oatmeal stout with scents of sweet malt, coffee, toasted grain, and a bit earthiness as well. Strong coffee and cream flavor mixes well with roasted malt, chocolate and a slight grain/oatmeal flavor lingering at the back of the palate. The mouthfeel is like silk across your palate with a medium body on it. At only 5.0% ABV the drinkability is holds up very well. I could drink several of these and be just fine.  Exceptional for the style. Great beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

This beer pours a dark opaque color almost completely black with a nice frothy head... The smell is of burnt dark chocolate and roasted malts... a nice, sweet aroma with an even more appealing creamy, cocoa taste that is not at all bitter... The flavor is excellent for a stout - goes down crisp and smooth with no traces of bitterness what-so-ever... This is an exceptional beer that I will definitely purchase again.. Mouthfeel is equally great and I really enjoyed downing an 18 ounce size...

Smells sweet, oatmeal, chocolate, and smoked malt. Tastes mmm... thick oatmeal goodness. Mouthfeel is perfect, the carbonation lends supporting creaminess to the body, and doesn't get in the way. Good session/activity beer.. for shoveling snow, muching on olives and strong cheese, or sipping slowly in a old lazy-boy recliner near the fireplace.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Strangely enough, oatmeal is just one of many flavors, and not even a major one at that.  Interesting flavor, very drinkable for such a heavy beer.

113,571,Strix,4.06,"550 ml bottle.  Pours black with dark red edges and a thick, lingering tan head  Smell is pleasant, molasses and some coffee, but less obvious than some. A pleasant smell, but wasn't strong for me.  Taste is of dark malts, a vague oatmeal and chocolate background, and a lingering dry woody sweetness. Very balanced, a nice variety of roasted smoky flavors without going off too much in one direction. Quite pleasant, perhaps a bit understated in the beginning, but as it warms more flavorful with a longer-lasting bitter chocolate finish.  Mouthfeel is smooth, silky and creamy. Nice depth in beginning, seemed to thin out as beer warmed.  I'm quite impressed with this one.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,brewdoc75,4.41,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an Imperial pint glass.  As I pour this beer into the glass I see a beauty of a brew. Dark black w/ an almost red hue as the light shines on it. A seductive 1/2 inch creamy head crowns the top and dissipates to 1/8 inch a few minutes later. Very inviting indeed.  The aroma of this beer is great, but it doesn't take me away like I feel it should. Maybe its looks threw me off? As I let it warm up a bit, the aroma comes out more. Roasted malts, mild tones of coffee, toffee and even a bit of caramel scents.  The flavor of this beer is great. A light bitterness initially, but is backed up w/ a pleasant chocolately sweetness. I do taste a hint of molasses and even some banana in this one. Very well balanced flavors. The mouthfeel is great as well. As you would expect this beer is the quintessential example of creamy smoothness. It hits the lips crisply, but finishes smooth and soft.  Overall this beer is a must have if you enjoy stouts. If you are new to Oatmeal Stouts and want to try one, this is one you definitely must try. Extremely drinkable.

The burn aftertaste hangs around for a while.  D: Not bad. Better than Guiness (which isn't exactly the ""standard"", but something that everybody has had...) but I could do with a bit more flavor.

113,571,Durge,4.18,"Well I've been putting this one off too long. This six pack of 12 ouncers has been sitting in my basement for at least three years now and that's how long it's been since I had what was always one of my favorites (just got caught up in variety lately). So I was curious if this fine brew would hold up at all. It did pretty well. A very dark mahogany/black with a medium tan head and a super Guiness-like lace that wouldn't quit. The aroma is a fine mix of raisin, fig, coffee and smoke. The taste brings all that and more in a somewhat acqueous, lightly carbonated classic. It is somewhat winelike which I don't so much recall so it may be due to the unusual incubation period! I also pick up some roasted nuts and it's a bit more smokey. Very smooth with a nice coffee bitterness. Surpisingly drinkable but not really something I would want to drink too generously. Even after brutal storage this brew pleases. Always recommended to those who favor some character to their beer. Can't wait to have a fresh one now!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Wonderful taste to this thing. Bittersweet chocolate and coffee and something else that I can't discern but it's simply wonderful. This leaves some of the best lacing that I've ever seen. It's like it just clings to the glass. I'm enjoying this a lot.  This is one damn fine beer. This is exactly what I was expecting and looking for from this beer. I don't know if I like it as well as the Samuel Smith Imperial Stout, but that by no means is a knock on this beer at all.

S- Smells mostly of chocolate, roasted coffee and toffee.  T- Very nice taste. The coffee hits you first. If it is there, coffee will hit the American tongue faster than anything. Once you're past the coffee, the chocolate, toffee and a little bit of oatmeal come through. It makes me think of waking up to a cold winter morning with coffee and hot cocoa brewing.  M- Smooth. A little thick (I mean a little). The fluid really just binds together in a smooth, crisp manner.  D- This is very popular and I see why. Nothing too over powering.

Creamy... very creamy. The oats worked well in this one. It was a little thinner than I would have liked, but creamy nonetheless.

No noticeable lacing was detected. The beer was a dark brownish black and very opaque.  A tan, burnt malt aroma was evident with the first inhale above the rim. Definitely gave off the stout bouquet with hop undertones and a bunch of caramel malt  There was a nice smooth taste with the first swallow with just a slight bit of bitterness. Nothing off tasting was bombarding the taste buds though. The second sip went better as the initial bitter seemed to subside. I would not mark it down for anything coming out in the taste department though.  The mouth feel of this beer was very good with roasted barley, chocolate and caramel slowly dissipating over time. I would almost drink this just for the aftertaste.  My first trip into the Samuel Smiths line and it was very acceptable.

113,571,BMoney575,4,"Sampled on 10-26-07  Pours a very pleasant black, with just a hint of red licking at the edges. The enormous tan head lasts hours and leaves big, craggy lacing.  Smell is lots of chocolate, surprisingly complex with hints of oak and anise.  Taste is very malty and sweet, with flavors of subtle oak, chocolate, and even a raisin dark fruit quality. The English hops add their standard flavor, add it all goes together very nicely.  Mouthfeel is good, but a bit thin and watery for my tastes.  Drinkability is also good, but this is definately on the sweet side.  Overall, a very good beer. One of the first I've had where I enjoyed the English hops. Well made and easy to drink, and worth keeping around.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Roasted coffee and some bitterness in the finish.  M: Creamy, light, nicely carbonated.  D: Great intro stout. Easy to drink, but still that ""meal in a bottle"" feel that I love about stouts. Nice flavors, nice cult status, great beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Not an overpowering smell, but picked up hints of carmel, malt, toffee.  Wonderful taste, with multiple layers of flavor, very intrguing and complex. There are hints of chocolate, coffee, oats, malts and yeast, not too much on the hops... a little thin for a stoudt.

S - Malty, but with a little bit of an acidic twang. Did not smell as ""dark"" as expected  T - Good malty taste, but with a little more bite than I appreciate. Not as smooth as expected either. Not bad, just different than expected.  M - Good mouthfeel that matched the taste, more grainy and slick with a thinner finish than expected.

The head is so heavy it dimples the top of the beer.  S- There is a lot going on here and I am loving it. Chocolate, raisins... a very complex aroma. Sweet with a hint of roastiness and brown sugar.  T- Very tasty. Some chocolate and assorted darker fruits, very light coffee flavor. There is something really special here and I absolutely love this. Has a slight English ale flavor to it, which is usually not my thing, but it is brilliant here.  M- Very light and creamy on the palate, perfect.  D- I was amazed by this, I am almost speechless.

It did have a chocolate and coffee taste about it, almost like a milk stout. It was definately heavier than most of my choices but an excellent one at best.

Not overly carbonated.  D- Drinkability is good. Kind of too sweet to me for a session beer, but one or two of these are good for the soul.

As with other Samuel Smith beers I've had, it pours lighter and kind of fizzy. 2 finger tan head that dies to 1/4 inch. Devent lacing.  S: Grainy and bready. Getting lots of dark fruits. Just a tast of sweet coffee.  T/M: Lot of sweet maltiness as expected. Tastes like dark cherries that have been caramelized in brown sugar. I bet this would be outrageous with homemade cherry or apple pie with a strong cup of black coffee. Just a hint of roasted coffee. Suprisingly, I'm not getting any sweet milk out of this.

113,571,mcmidc,3.33,"After pouring this stout, the head settled down to almost nothing, not the slight creamy head I was looking for. It was a dark stouty color with not an over whelming amount of odor. There was slight hints of oatmeal and maybe some chocolate in the smell. Mouthfeel was milky and smooth, probably the beers strong point. I didn't encounter anything special in the way of taste, a sweet stout with a little oatmeal and coffee hints but nothing that really jumps out at you. To me, it didnt drink like a stout, too light and not very robust. A smooth beer that goes down easy and drinks easy, but not exactly what I'm looking for in a stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Taste of this beer is wonderful. Sweet milk chocolate, and hints of coffee, then followed by the slightest hint of dark chocolate. Mouthfeel was good, very creamy.

113,571,Halcyondays,4.53,"18.7 oz. English bottle,  A: Pours a very dark brown, looks black at first sight, but when tilted it shows its true colours, with ruby-red highlights. The head is a light brown colour, which stays around for the whole of the drink, and leaves some nice lacing.  S: Not over the top, an understated, subtle, coffee and mocha smell, with a bit of chocolate and cola.  T: Definitely a sweet stout, lots of residual sugar, a nice milk chocolate main flavour, with a hint of coffee, some cherry notes as well.  M: Relatively light for a stout, almost spritzy, but a nice amount of carbonation definitely adds to the flavour of this beer.  D: A great drinkable lighter stout. When I first had this beer on my 21st birthday it really stood out from the other drinks I had on that day, and almost 2 years later it still stands up.

People, this is a very nice drink. It pours very dark (not black) and has a pretty thick, tan head that disappears after a few minutes. The smell is nice, lightly sweet and not overwhelming. The taste is similar- you notice caramel (or something that tastes like it) but its not sugary. The taste itself isn't heavy- its hearty and complex, it almost tastes like it should be good for you in a whole-grain kind of way. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected from a stout, but pleasant. It's a heavy, meal-like drink; maybe you could have 2 in one sitting if you ate light beforehand.

113,571,ElGordo,4.2,"I doubt I can write anything that hasn't already been said, but I mainly review for my own records anyway. Poured from the 500ml bottle into a pint glass. Body is a deep rich dark brown color, verging on but not quite reaching black. The tan head is rather thin due to an overly-cautious pour. Sweet aroma of roasted dark malt, oats, a touch of brown sugar, and a hint of dark fruit. Palate is rich, mellow, and sweet. Rich dark roasted malt dominates up front, with the subtleties of dark fruit, brown sugar, and oats creeping in towards the back of the mouth. Finish is more dark malt with a bit of lactose sweetness. The body is really the main draw here. The oatmeal lends a silky texture that is just sublime and fits the palate perfectly. This also renders the beer very easy to drink, ensuring that a solo drinker can handle the entire large bottle. A top notch stout from one of the world's great breweries.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,MrBen,4.8,"Like this one needs another review!  Well, here's the classic English Oatmeal Stout -- the one that introduced so many to the style. While it's true that there are other oatmeal stouts I would prefer to drink all day than Sam Smith's version, this is still one of the benchmarks to which all other oatmeals can be compared.  Dark, rich, expertly balanced, and savory. Very approachable. American brewers take this ball and run with it, accentuating some of the subtle notes in this enjoyable brew, such as the patent malts, with their flinty and almost ashy flavor. Some Americans also push the oats and flaked barley, making for a more full, slick mouthfeel. But if you're looking for a traditional, consistent oatmeal stout, this is one to admire.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,JamesS,3.33,"Pours nice from the bottle with a fair amount of head, even if it's not as much as I'm used to seeing from a stout. Nice dark tones, but again not as dark as I'm used to seeing in a stout. It has a slight stout aroma, but nothing as strong as I'm used to seeing from a stout, just a hint of bitters and a very, very slight waft of oatmeal. It does go down smooth, it's texture being its best quality in my opinion. It has a nice stout flavor, but there is not one flavor that really comes out, making it a mild stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,bigdeuce,4.24,"Another good one from Sam Smith's. I have nothing bad to say about Sam Smith's except their beer, although outstanding, is way overpriced. This one pours a nice creamy head.

113,571,ClassicBrad,3.23,"So, as the cooler months approach I start to yearn for a good stout. So then, why not have the pride of England's infamous Oatmeal Stout.  A thick and stubbornly immobile head and a completely opaque, black hole of a body are two of my favorite physical features in a quality stout and this stout lacks the former.  It smells a little too sweet for an oatmeal stout in my opinion. I'm looking for down and dirty maltshake and I got a sweet and tart front nose.  Taste falls short on the same grounds as my gripe with this brews smell. I really could have used a more substantially thickened, mouth-filling monster of a stout but I get more of a refreshing cola out of this.  Mouthfeel as I have aforementioned lacked thickness in my opinion.  Drinkability was exceptional but I refused it an exceptional grade due to its over-drinkability. I could have used something that cure my hunger in a half-pint. Bring on a case of this and I'll still need stout quenching.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Smell: roasted dark Coffee w/ strong caramel. VERY inviting  Taste: Fantastic. Roasted coffee, molasses and caramel that lingers throughout the drink. Not overly sweet but in no way bitter. Rich and creamy The combination of the roasted coffee(slight bitterness) w/ the molasses makes for a fantastic combination...neither is overpowering and both combined make for a very enjoyable taste. Not a overly complex beer but damn does it taste great  Mouthfeel: Great....very smooth w/ little carbonation. Lingers slighty on the sides of the mouth and also leaves the slight molasses/caramel taste behind  Drinkability: God, it's smooth and tasty...what isn't to love? My only disappointment is that I only bought one to try. A great session beer that can easily be enjoyed throughout the night next to a warm fire. I'm in love  --I will being writing a review of the Young's Oatmeal stout to see how they compare but I'm not sure if it can top this fine drink.

Head dropped to a nice lace in about 3 minutes. The smell is a little harder to pick up than some stouts, but it has a nice roasted aroma. Upon tasting, I found that it has a strong roasted grain flavor with bitter and alcoholic undertones. The alcohol does not stand out, and you have to search for it to find the taste. This drinks very well, better than Guinness in my opinion.

Appearance: Nice black color through the bottle.  Smell: Roasted coffee and very malty.  Taste: Delicious! Very robust and silky smooth  Mouthfeel: A meal in a glass. The kind of beer you want to bite into.  Drinkability: Very smooth. Excellent aftertaste.  This just might be my favorite beer.

113,571,TexIndy,4.16,"Poured from a 550ml clear bottle into a pint glass. It was pitch black even against a light. I gave a hard pour so it had a massive light brown head. It slowly settled into a constant foam with some lacing. The aroma was roasted and chocolate malts with a sweetness in the background. It was weaker than I remember so might need to rereview later. The taste was great. Nutty and chocolately. Very smooth from start to finish. Almost session beer smooth. The taste won't blow you away but you find yourself drinking it down and going back for more so I bumped the drinkability to reflect that. Mouthfeel was good but wanted a little creamier. It was just a little watery. Overall, an excellent brew that I highly recommend. This one has a home in the semi regular rotation.

Some cold coffee and roasted grain notes. Slightly chocolaty, somewhat nutty, and very much like molasses.  T - Some chocolate flavors are there too, and they are backed up by a balancing twinge of sour roasted grain bitterness and some gentle leafy hops. I also noticed some very slight grapey flavors somewhere in there.  M - It's extremely well built and feels weighty in my mouth. The carbonation is almost non-existent, and this brew feels really silky and rich in my mouth. Satiny.  D - Excellent. Eminently quaffable.

This beer is smooth, silky, and fullbodied. I wish I had bought a 4 pack of this instead of the one. Drinkability is tough.

Some nice earthy notes are around there if you dig for it, but mostly chocolatey.  Taste: Wow this is one smoooth beer. Hits the tongue with an almost velvety texture with little carbonation.

113,571,TheWhaleShark,4.43,"Poured from a 550 ml bottle into a pint glass.  A: Black. Very black. Not quite like, say, the wine dark sea, but it's a damn dark beer. Head was a beautiful brown and fairly substantial, about 2.5 fingers. It stuck around for a while, and reduced to lace that remained long into the drinking.  S: Very roasty, with a dark chocolate and coffee aroma dominating. Also has hints of some sweetness; caramel maybe?  T: Wow. This is an awesome beer. Full roasty body, with coffee and a bready, oaty, nutty taste. Very smooth and a bit sweet; there is minimal hop character, but not really enough to reduce the malt character. The finish is somewhat dry, with a slightly bitter, dark chocolate taste.  M: FULL. This is a substantial brew, a meal in and of itself. A single sip of this beer feels like eating an entire slice of hearty 12 grain artisan bread. It definitely needs to be enjoyed slowly, to recover from each massive mouthful.  D: Its sweet and smooth character makes this an incredibly drinkable beer; the sheer fullness of its body does limit your ability to drink it. Definitely not doable if you have a very substantial meal as well.  Really, this beer is virtually a side dish. I love it.

On to the important stuff...  Pours a two finger head that settles to a thin covering of the dark brown brew. I can't see through this one at all. I can smell this one sitting at my side. A closer inspection reveals roasted malts, molasses and brown sugar oatmeal. As with most oatmeal stouts the first sip immediately reveals a smooth creamy texure. Carbonation is light and fine.

Slowly dissapates to a thin creamy film over the top and thicker around the sides.  Smell- Scent is subdued, slight chocolate malt aroma with oats lingering within. No real hop to speak of.  Taste- Mmmm creamy. I should have had this at breakfast time. Slight burn on the tounge from alcohol, lactose infused chocolate and black patent slides down the throat smoothly. This is the sort of beer you want to make an ice cream float out of. No real hop bitterness to speak of, but much oatmeal stout flavor.  Mouthfeel- Smooth and creamy, an excellent example of the style. One of Samuel Smith's best offerings.  Drinkability- Oddly for a stout, very drinkable. I find myself regretting that I didn't buy the full 4-pack and only buying a single, but lucky for me, it is one of the most obtainable.

You can definitely smell a healthy dose of barley as well but I didn't really pick up on anything else which was quite surprising  The taste to me was underwhelming especially for such a highly rated stout. I prefer complex and balanced stouts (this one is a bit on the hoppy side) that leave you with different layers of taste form inception to aftertaste. I love tasting chocolate/coffee/fruits/etc in a stout and this had none of that. I personally found this stout quite one dimensional and boring.  Mouthfeel was nothing special.  It's not a bad stout so I rated drinkability slightly higher but since I specifically tried it after seeing the 90 it scored here I was left scratching my head on this one.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Karyyk,4.44,"This was recommended to me by a preacher friend of mine, heh.  Pours opaque, basically as black as night. Holding it up to a light, very little filters through. Head is heavy and endures, leaving lacing from the top of the glass to the very bottom. If a beer can be classified as ""beautiful,"" this one is at the top of the list.  Smells of oatmeal (go figure), coffee and roasted dark malts. The taste is initially sweet, with a bit of bitterness on the back-end. The coffee and malts are again noticeable, and overall it's surprisingly smooth for a stout.  This is easily one of my favorite beers, and is a good one to sit back and sip when you're in a lazy mood and just want to relax. I've introduced it to quite a few folks who enjoy their beer on the stouter and more complex side, and I've yet to hear a complaint. As good as all of the Samuel Smith brews are, this one sits alone at the top IMHO.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,micahgoldfus,4.25,"Poured a handsome, dark brown-black color with a 2-finger toffee-colored head that slowly faded down. Smells of oatmeal and dark roasted malts. Tasted like the smell: delicious roasted malt and burnt coffee flavors, with an aftertaste that was a mix of sweet oatmeal and a touch of bitterness. I started drinking this beer fairly cold, but the flavors really came out once it warmed up a bit, especially the oatmeal. Mouthfeels was heavy and smooth, with little carbonation. I enjoyed this beer very much.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Glazed144,4.82,"Pours deep brown. Nice head, dissipates slowly, keeps a rim. Smells nicely of roasted malt, definitely smells like a stout.

113,571,Bitterbill,4.38,"Purchased at Liquor Shed in Casper for US$3.70  This ours from 550ML bottle a very dark brown with a large offwhite head of foam that just won't quit. And...there's plenty of lacing so it's really a very nice brew when looking into my glass.  The smell hits my nose with a lot of sweet and roasted malt and is very nice.  The taste follows the nose to a T. A big abundance of roasted malt with some sweet tones followed by a nice oatmeal flavour and lesser notes of anise and citrus tang. Wow, the mix of flavours really work well together and *force* me to take sip after sip. Very drinkable and it makes for an *excellent* session brew. I could drink this one all night long. The carbonation is medium light and the mouthfeel is silky smooth. I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this before as it's simply an outstanding example of the style and is easy on the wallet. Highly recommended!!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,scott,4.22,"V.07 Medium expansive head on top of a dark, highlighted amber edge. Sweet roasted malt, and chocolate entice the mouth, and there it finds a chewy, medium rich bakers chocolate. The presence of oatmeal restrains any notion of hop punctuation, but the beverage is saved by a crisp carbonation. Initially it is smooth & creamy, but finishes dry rather nicely. A well-crafted stout, and tradition is closely observed.. Great for a session, and recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,pmcadamis,4.23,"A - Classic Sammy Smith bottle with the fancy gold foil. Pours a coca-cola black with some hints of brown. A big solid looking head eventually fades to a thin cap and fat collar. Tons of brown lace is left on the sides of my snifter. A swirl builds the head back up to a solid two fingers.  S - Pancake syrup dark sweetness greets my nose. Rich peanut butter and milled oats too. In the background, there are some cold coffee and roasted grain notes. Slightly chocolaty, somewhat nutty, and very much like molasses.  T - Big time nutty flavors remind me of chunky peanut butter and freshly shelled and salted nuts. Some chocolate flavors are there too, and they are backed up by a balancing twinge of sour roasted grain bitterness and some gentle leafy hops. I also noticed some very slight grapey flavors somewhere in there. Towards the end, I began to notice some nickel-like metallic or mineral flavors that were slightly off-putting...a product of Tadcaster's water?  M - Thinner than I would have guessed from the chunky nose, but it's extremely well built and feels weighty in my mouth. The carbonation is almost non-existent, and this brew feels really silky and rich in my mouth. Satiny.  D - Excellent. This is complex, but well rounded, balanced, and understated enough to be eminently quaffable. At five percent ABV, this has session written all over it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Bamabrew22,4.13,"My first oatmeal stout and it didn't disappoint. Great looking black beer with a creamy, mother-of-pearl head. Two-finger head retention. Aroma reminded me of licorice, roasted barley and maybe a hint of chocolate. Taste was really nice; a chewy, viscosity to it, with notes of sweetness and coffee from the roasted barley. An overall earthiness was added by the oats themselves. Heavy beer which coats the palate. A great beer! Would love to savor/sip many of these.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,botham,4.87,"this oatmeal stout pours black with an inch of tan head that dissipates after a few minutes, leaving a bit of lacing on the glass. the color in light is a deep brown with a bit of ruby red thrown in. wonderful brew from the looks of it.  smell is of roasted malts, chocolate, and a bit of hops and alcohol thrown in the mix. the smell overall is sweet, but doesn't seem overly so.  taste is of heavy roastiness up front, followed by a bit of sweetness, which is where the chocolate resides. on the way down, the hops bring a bit of bitterness to the mouth, without overselling it.  aftertaste is of lightly bitter roastiness and chocolate, the sweetness seems to have gone away with the swallow. letting the mouth sit dry for a while, the chocolate fades into only a light bitterness.  mouthfeel is medium to light-bodied, leaving a bit of a film around the mouth after going down, which is exceptional. one definitely knows they are drinking a great brew from the aftertaste this one leaves behind.  drinkability is great. not filling or intoxicating at around 5%, one could easily enjoy a few of these for the makings of a great night!  this brew is extremely well crafted without much room for improvement. the ONLY critique i have for this brew is that the bitterness doesn't show itself until after going down. that being said, definitely check this one out.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,maddogruss,3.78,"This was a very solid beer; one of my favorite stouts. A very dark body with a nice tan head that holds throughout the beer. The smell caught me a little off-guard as it was slightly malty but still roasted. The taste emphasized the latter. Very roasted taste, almost smokey, as if the malt had actually been roasted over a fire. A nice, thick mouthfeel that was ok despite the summer months. Despite its thick mouthfeel, the beer is pretty easy drinking. The fact that the beer is nice and smooth is what makes it go down so easy.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Brown sugar, vanilla, some esters (blackberry-ish) and slight espresso flavors in the middle. Finishes with a bit of acidity. Chalked full of flavor.  Chewy mouthfeel with a bit of carbonation bite, can't say I expected that from an English ale (nothing a vigorous pour can't take care of).  One of my favorite English beers so complex yet so downright drinkable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Tan lumpy head which initially settles just over a finger thick and ebs to a centimeter with sticky lacing.  S - Vanilla then chocolate then sweet cookie dough.  T - Starts out with a slight rotten fruit flavor but this disappears instantly and gives way to a perfectly sweet flavour- the sweetness is not nasty, burning, or cloying its just perfect. SMOOOTH. Finishes light chocolate with the bitterness of a fine chocolate bar.  M - Perfect, it is smooth and finished slightly slick. Theres a tad of oaty graininess which is cleaned out by the slickness. I want to drink this. At 7% it is still very, very drinkable  D - I could drink this for the rest of my life. It tastes so fresh and yet it shipped from so far away.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,DGryger,4.1,"Appearance: Cola brown, medium-aggressive pour produces a 2+ finger khaki colored head. Thin eight inch head sticks around for a while and produces low to moderate lacing.  Smell: Smells almost exactly like sweet feed for horses. Heavy oats and molasses or brown sugar. Burnt caramel. A little more aroma would be nice.  Taste: Sweet roasty malts with a bit of licorice mixed in. Prunes and raisins, definitely some dried dark fruit flavors in there. Bitter cocoa notes left in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Moderately syrupy and smooth as silk. No astringent bitterness in the finish as I have found with some oatmeal stouts. Good carbonation, a class act all the way. Definitely worthy of a five.  Drinkability: While the ABV is only 5%, I think that the sessionability is impacted by the richness  this is a meal beer. If I were at a bar and it was on tap, I would probably go for it. I could see this beer going well with roasted meat.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

T - roasted flavours are superb, not overly harsh at all, just the right amount that is complimented by a sweet nuttiness, roasted flavours linger on in the aftertaste.  M- Lively carbonation, full bodied and thick/sticky   D: A real thick stout, a meal in itself! A first class effort, one of my fav stouts now. A super fireside winter beer.

On to the beer:  Poured into a pint glass, it's black in the body and tan in the head; the latter just sits there on top. There's a hint of chocolate syrup in the smell, a subtle roasted flavor, a bit of cooked oatmeal, and cappuchino flavors. The taste is more of the same. Fairy smooth, with the bitterness at the lower end for the style, making it easy to drink. Delicious!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Toasted grains - I feel like that oatmeal is really present even before it hits the tongue. Caramel/chocolate/coffee appearances as well. Velvety soft and medium-bodied in the mouth; the bitterness of roasted barley and mild hop are balanced nicely by sweeter oat. Bittersweet in the finish, and easy to sip at.

113,571,dbalsock,4.19,"App: Dark, dark brown with a vanilla tan head that goes 2-3 fingers on an easy pour. The lacing is nice. This beer looks perfect. The head diminishes quickly down to 1/4 finger (kinda small, but covers the beer not just the sides).  Smell: Caramel, some roasted coffee (but nothing intense), and a little hoppage, all very well balanced.  Taste: This is very nice. It tastes roasted with nice caramel malts and some chocolate, but it's also very nutty. It's quite sweet, especially on the aftertaste where it is perfect.  Mouthfeel: Just a teensy bit underbodied for my tastes, but is very smooth and creamy on the palate. There's a little hint of bitterness on the end, but I can't tell whether it's do to hops or the roasted character of the brew.

The beer was somewhat smooth going down physically but the flavor was just over powered by smoke. The mouth feel was more medium bodied. The flavor is there but the beer just seems too watered down.

Including milk and dark chocolate, black malty coffee, assorted grains, and a molasses sweetness throughout.  A creamy smooth mouthfeel has a great clean finish.

Taste - first sip was pungent. my first thought was that it was too hoppy, but, as the head died down and the beer got flatter it tasted better...possibly a sharper carbonation than suits my taste. Mouthfeel - again, harsher than expected. for an oatmeal stout, this wasn't smooth or thick. the carbonation really suppresses most of the beer's quality. Drinkability - honestly - let it sit for a few minutes. after the head dies down and the beer flattens, the carbonated sharpness goes away and the good things you would expect from a stout start to show themselves.

The head remained for some time, and slowly dissipated into a light layer of foam on the top of the brew. Lacing is apparent on all sides of the glass. Through the light, a slight red tint is visible. All around good looking.  Smell: A deep, grainy smell. There is a sweetness about it. There are hints of oats, and even a slight coffee-like aroma. The scent is strong and pleasant. It really gives a good indicator that the taste will be powerful.  Taste: As the smell suggests, this has a strong taste. There are different characteristics. Initially, there is a smokey character to the taste, which is followed by a splash of sweetness. The finish brings out the oat character of this stout. There is a coffee taste hidden among the oats. There is a wonderful balance between sweetness and tartness.  Mouthfeel: Thick, just like you would expect a stout to be. There is a little carbonation present. However, although the texture is thick, it is not syrupy, which is a plus. Overall, the mouthfeel is good, but it isn't amazing either.  Drinkability: This is rich, and definitely a sipper. It'd be tough to drink a multitude of these in a single session. You'll definitely want to finish your glass, but afterwards you'll want to reach for something lighter.  Recommended.

The taste is a little thin, slightly metallic, smooth and full of chocolate and roasted barley, the coffee flavor is more subtle than the aroma would lead you to believe. It finishes with a bit of an acidic/metallic bite which is no doubt a by product of the roasted grain, but that is forgotten with each subsequent sip. Silky smooth and a little thin, but it is a very pleasant mouth feel and easy to drink.

Reminds me of a big 'ole bowl of brown sugar oatmeal. There's also some leather and shoe polish?? Definately English...  Taste is alot like the aroma leads on, with flavors ranging from caramel malts to some nut and oat notes. A chocolatey aftertaste ends the full-bodied, smooth mouthfeel.

Taste: Sweet dark chocolate and roasted coffee/espresso flavor hit first, as well as some molasses and raisin. An earthy-grain flavor in the middle (from the yeast?). Finishes with a mild touch of hop bitterness  just enough to balance the sweetness of the roasted malt. As the beer warms, the flavors being to get deeper  the molasses sweetness and the grain tones start to stand out more. Very good balance in all the flavors - none too overpowering, all noticeable.

I rarely buy imports these days, due to the high number of awesome domestic craft beers.  Now I can say I've had it and I enjoyed it enough to know I can fall back on it if I ever find myself with a limited selection.

113,571,sunrisesolara,4.65,"A really great beer. Went well with the pizza, well suited for the social situation. Very much a beer that I could drink very often, a great meal beer. I picked this beer about a year back and it seemed different, perhaps my tastes have changed. Went back to it simply to try it again. Good choice. Definately tasted the oatmeal. A bit pricey, but worth it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,kpantz,4.1,"Executive Summary: This is the first ""craft"" beer I can ever remember seeing. My father used to drink this when I was younger. I've since turned him on to the likes of St. Bernardus and Dogfish Head, but even dads need to start somewhere, I guess. I can see what he liked about this stout. It's such an easy drinker with such nice flavors. It's like that guy at work you just can't say anything bad about, because he's just that nice.  Appearance: Nearly opaque, deep brown/black with ruby hues when held up to the light. Head is fluffy and pretty persistent. Decent lacing.  Smell: Sweet malt, caramel, mild coffee, toffee. Very, very inviting.  Taste: Buttery sweet malt to start, roasted flavors come through here as well. Oats are noticeable, but not so much as to be gimmicky. A very smooth flavor overall.  Mouthfeel: Wonderfully light and smooth - this is a casual drinker's stout. Low to moderate carbonation lets the smooth, buttery flavor come through quite nicely.  Drinkability: Extremely high. This is just a nice brew to drink. The flavors are well balanced and do not overpower you.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,trevorwideman,4.48,"550ml bottle poured into a pint glass.  Black brew pours with a massive tan head that just won't quit. Carbonation is likely aggressive, I can't see it. Incredible bitter roasted malt aroma that combines with lots of grounded earthiness and a little bit of tobacco sweetness. Plum, raisin, and fig aromas begin to appear as the beer warms to ideal serving temperature.  Taste is just unreal. Sweet off the top with lots of juicy fruit flavours, and there's that chewing tobacco bittersweetness that comes through right after. Roasted malt is subdued but does lend a pleasant bitterness. Earthy aroma hops come through in spades, and then a butteriness just to keep it all mellow. This is so complex but exceptionally balanced. A beer that has all these brilliant flavourful aspects but manages to blend them and keep them in harmony is truly art. Mouthfeel is so smooth and the carbonation is British and restrained, but it's perfection for the style. Body is Medium, just enough to give you something to ponder but not ever too thick or syrupy. At 5% it's sessionable, and Lord knows I'd like more than one, but this is all I get. I dread the end of the glass.  Brilliant.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Chocolate. Sweet oats and bread.  T: Pleasant roasted caramel malt and day old coffee. Sweetness of the oats and molasses takes over. Earth like undertones are followed by a soft toffee presence. Herbal or tea like finish.  M: Smooth as silk and creamy. Minimal carbonation. Slightly dry.  D: A very soft stout that has a wonderful sweetness about it.

113,571,barleywinebrewer,3.92,wow! 813 reviews posted as of this writing. What can I say?? I have enjoyed this beer off and on for years. I have even had it in england. I swore off it for a few years due to a rash of skunked beers.  I bought it this weekend because of the brown bottle. Yeah! My beer is back. A bit sweeter than I remember but still worth searching out! I'm happy to be able to enjoy this fine beer again without worrying about light damage!

113,571,schusterbauer,4.57,"by no means the blackest or thickest stout on the block, this has more of a calm burgundy/brown coloring with a tan head. light gets through, though not a whole lot. smell is very mild -- cooling brownies and a hint of alcohol, raisins, walnuts. chocolate, coffee, raisins, lemon zest, walnuts, and candy sugar flavors all mingle together, held together by mild roasted and charcoal elements. not over powering by any means, but delicious, and conducive to huge mouthfuls. medium-to-thin body, silky smooth, goes down effortlessly.  i've had this beer countless times, and it always leaves a sour aftertaste in my mouth once the beer is gone. not a big deal if you're having another, or if you have some water handy. never the less, though, this is a classic, and with good reason.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,Nesued,4.43,"550ml brown bottle. Gold wrap around the neck, traditional for Samuel Smith offerings.  Appearance - Purs dark chocolate in color. About a finger or two of a wheat-colored head forms upon pour. After sitting, the head resolves to a thin lace.  Smell - Nutty chocolate aroma. Not a very pronounced presence, however there is a rich depth. I do sense a bit of a fig smell as well.  Taste - Very malty taste with an exceedingly smooth opening, middle and finish. A bit of a hop bite, but not much to speak about.  Mouthfeel - Very filling and rolls nicely around the mouth. Nice and creamy  Drinkability - My goodness, this is an outstanding Stout!! Very well balanced and smooth. Very easy to down several of these in one sitting.

It's creamy, milky, and chocolatey across the palate. It's like a bite of chocolate followed by a quick swig of milk, which in and of itself is a delight.Oh my yes.

113,571,Talisker,2.69,"I wanted to love this one - sweet stouts are among my favorites. And I was delighted to find a Samuel Smith in a brown bottle - no clear glass here. But my beer was still either oxidized or just not a great sample.  Pours a deep black with a frothy deep brown head, dissipates quickly, but leaves about half a finger on top throughout the drink. Smells a rich malt, hints of chocolate, toffee, malt - and a tiny perfect hint of English hops. But dominated by a soapy oxidized/lightstruck character - damn it!  Unfortunately the taste is muted. Distant echoes of rich malt and chocolate, but oxidation continues from the nose. Very dry, even tannic, through the middle and finish - overly so, almost taking the moisture out of my mouth. Subsequent drinks are not easy to take.  A style I love, and a brewery I want to enjoy - but for English Oatmeal Stouts I'm sticking with Young's.

Lots of air in the head but it maintains it shape, and laces the glass.  Smell: A warm and soft aroma of roasted malts and nuts.  Taste: Has a nice and somewhat subdued flavor of roasted malts, oats, and a hint of chocolate. There's a pinch of bitterness to the flavor, but also some sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and incredibly smooth. Has a mild tingly feel to it as well.  Drinkability: Easier to drink than most stouts and tastes good too.  There's something a bit out of the ordinary with this beer (when compared to other stouts) but it is good! It has a somewhat cool and subdued flavor, but it works well.

113,571,witster18,3.77,"A solid stout. The oatmeal gives it an interesting mouthfeel. I detect a little banana with that chocolate...maybe that's the oatmeal as well...pours nice and dark with a 1.5"" head that holds nicely...not as smooth and creamy as Guinness but the flavors here are more complex and abundant.Along with the chocolate there is a great earthy sweetness. Finishes bitter chocolate with roasted malts and a bite of the alcohol characteristics late....maybe a touch too winey. Overall....Good. I have read before...and agree that this is a little overpriced...for about the same money I'd prefer St.Ambroise Oatmeal....but overall, this is way above average for sure....and definately a big notch above the mass-pro-avail stuff...very tasty! Lots of interesting flavors that unfortunately are overwhelmed by the alchohol late.... This is solid.... but a bit over-hyped! Compared to say Great Lakes Blackout Stout or Fitzgerald Porter... this is just an overpriced import.... too good to turn down but a bit pricey if you have access to other tasty american crafts.... why pay for the shipping when there are good representations here if you know where to look.... like the silky mouthfeel and I like the alcohol presence in the aftertaste.... to some they might be negatives but this is a distinctive brew because of those specific characterstics.  with this and other SS beers my advice is only by at high volume beer specialty stores... otherwise you could get a stale bottle which leads to less carb and more wineyness....and a hangover... so be careful... freshness is important with this choice.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

The taste of the oatmeal stout is not as pronounced as Smith's Imperial. It has a subtle roasted flavor, bit semi-sweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is as smooth as it gets, velvety. This is probably the most drinkable stout that I have had. It is very balanced and smooth, a tad bitter a tad sweet.

Appearance is just perfect, a pitch black beer with a coarse, brownish head. It is almost impossible to see any light coming through.  Smell is roasted and burned and has a slight oily and full smell. Not much hops or bitterness in the nose.  Taste is roasted and burned with that oiliness from the oatmeal. A good maltbitter and hopbitter balances the dark taste. There are some smokey elements and the yeast gives the beer it's distinct profile, which is hard to describe, but if I do, it would be earthy and charcoal.

113,571,Mitchster,4.07,"$3.99 for a 550ml bottle. I've drank this lots, but I guess I never got around to reviewing it. So it pours out to a clear very dark brown...you can still see through it at the bottom of a pint glass. Forms a creamy soapy light tanhead with average retention and nice sheets of lace. Carbonation is mild to moderate. The aroma nice...it has that Sam Smith skunk mixed in with lots of vanilla, black walnut, butterscotch, coffee, pennies and sour milk. I think the sour milk is the key to Sam Smith. They must throw a couple of gallons of old skanky milk in each barrel. Mouthfeel is smooth with a piquant acidity that bites the tongue toward the end. Light bodied for an otamel stout, which is to say medium-bodied. A little bit of delicately sweet smoke hangs in the aftertaste with some dirty copper pennies in the finish. Oatmeal is nowhere to be found in the traditional sense.  Ah, the taste of England. I'm not fond of the traditional rubbery, diacetyl-soaked English Ale, but this is a nice little awkward beer. If I had to drink English, it would be Sam Smith, although I prefer some of their other beers.

113,571,MMansfield,4.35,"Finally, Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout... I've been longing for this for a while. Got it in a gift set at the NSLC.  Appearance: Pours a dark dark brown, almost black with a huge froathy tanned brown cap. Retention is awesome.  Aroma: A rush of sweetness. Huge chocolate aroma hits you like a ton of bricks. Big roasted malt, coffee, toffee, and earthy aromas including a tiny bit of pine.  Taste: Very sweet, lots of malt with hints of chocolate and coffee. Medium bitterness, very well constructed, solid oatmeal stout.  Mouthfeel: Velvety with great level of carbonation, not too creamy, just dense enough. Not as thick as I've heard.  Final Statement: Lived up to the hype. The jury is out on which is better, this or St. Ambroise, but Sam Smith's put together a real winner here. I only wish it were available here on a regular basis.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

I don't know why but dark beers just look more like beer should to me. Smells sweet, slightly sugary with some coffee undertones. Not too much on the nose, but enough to be enticing. Tastes excellent, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, very nutty and earthy. Leaves me with a good memory of every last sip. Highly drinkable, as far as stouts go. Thoroughly enjoyed.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Aroma- Very sweet with overtones of roasted malts, toasted oats and just a hint of caramel. As it warms, it takes on a coffee nose.  Taste- Good balance of bitter and sweetness. Nice melange of freshly ground coffee, heavily roasted grains, and oats. As it warms, the oats become more noticable. Nop floral hops at all (as it should be).  Mouthfeel- Carbonation just a tad high, but overall, it's smooth and creamy. Not quite as oily as I would expect an oatmeal stout to be either. Medium mouthfeel, but clings to the mouth and jowels very nicely, giving it a very nice coffee aftertaste.  Drinkability- Very nice.

Roasted malts, a little nutty, a little oatey and little caramelly full wonderful nose.  Taste: Bittersweet chocolate malts, caramel, toffee and a little ground coffee beans. Hints of sweet cherry soda pop and a little burnt smoke. Nuts, butterscotch and oatmeal linger off stage and emerge gently as the beer warms. Bitterness is slight but present.

113,571,iamtyler,4.8,"I don't know if there's much more that I could really say about this beer. It's easily one of the very best stouts I've ever come across and a gem from Sam Smith's.  The appearance of this beer is very rich looking. It pours very dark and the head forms a darker tan color, a little less than in inch in height and remained through more than two-thirds of the beer.  I really enjoyed the smell upon pouring and throughout the beer. It was a strong smell to go along with a rather strong flavor. As with the flavor, such a delicious taste. I had high expectations going in and the flavor most certainly did not disappoint.  There is some molasses taste and coffee but the oatmeal really stands out as you drink. The further along you go, the more prevalent the oatmeal taste becomes and this beer really comes full circle into an outstanding flavor and smell.  I loved this beer, I may be willing to say this could now be my favorite as of right now. I will be keeping a few pints of this on hand at all times for any and all occassions. I even got my dad to give it a try and he isn't much for stouts and he says that it's one of the most flavorful and delicious beers he's ever tasted. Drinkability?

Dark reddish brown color (like cola) with excellent clarity  aroma - Chocolate, and some nice smoke - very roasty smelling. Also some toffee-malty sweetness  flavor - Initial dark malt sweetness turned a bit smokey and floated very gently into a creamy, smokey finish. Balanced but overall more bitter than malty. No hop flavor apparent, which is fine for the style.  mouthfeel - Medium-light body. Moderate carbonation, but light enough to be quite creamy.

Huge frothy beige head that stood two fingers high at it's peak slowly falls away to moderate glass-coating lace and a thin coat of film on top. Smells are roasted dark coffee and chocolate, malts, sweet caramel and toffee notes. Also a slight earthen grainy character present. Taste is sweet and roasty, chocolate and espresso flavors abound, finishes on a slightly bitter roasty flavor with a dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, medium to full bodied with lower levels of carbonation makes this one just silken-smooth. Drinkability is also great, very enjoyable stout characteristics and roasty complexity coupled with the low abv% make this an easy to enjoy oatmeal stout.

This beer pours very dark black but not completely opaque when it is held up to a light. The head is dark tan and is thin to begin with and doesn't lace much. The smell is chocolate malt, dark fruit, molasses and oatmeal. The taste is much like the smell with a bit of acidity coming through. The mouthfeel is nice and full with a good level of carbonation and a plesent coating feeling the beer fills the mouth well.

113,571,Alkey,3.85,Poured from a 12oz. bottle a dark brown with a small layer of foam that dissipated rather quickly leaving very little lacing. Smells a bit skunky with some burnt malt.(hope I didn't get the clear bottle blues) Taste of oatmeal and a burnt malt and hop bitterness. Feels light/medium and a little creamy in the mouth. I have had this beer a few times and I remember it tasting a lot more richer and creamier.

113,571,Grundle20,4.25,"Appearance: The beer is almost entirely opaque black in color when poured in to a pint glass. There is an average chestnut brown head to the beer that doesn't lace the glass much.  Smell: There is a strong butterscotch and toffee character to the scent of this beer. Underlying notes of bittersweet chocolate and floral hop esters are also detectable but less apparent.  Taste and Mouthfeel: For a stout this beer presents a surprising amount of floral and fruit character. There's touches of heather and tinges of cherry. These flavors are still basically served up on a bittersweet chocolate malt base but do an awful lot to boost this beer's crispness. The beer drinks full with a good crisp character, it falls somewhere in between smooth and flat, and effervescent and completely refreshing. The aftertaste is a little heathery but clean for the most part.  Drinkability: Easily the most drinkable stout I've had in recent memory. I could actually drink more than a couple of these and I can also see good potential for this beer's meal pairings.  Bottom Line: A very delicious and well balanced stout. What I liked most is that the aftertaste didn't completely pollute my mouth after a bottle of this beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,StargherKing,4.88,"Beer is extremely dark, almost black. When held to light shades of crimson shine through, while the head is a thick coffee color. Smell is extremely complex, with the expected oatmeal, yeast, and even a coffelike aroma shining through. Taste is the same, strong and bitter, in a good way. Mouthfeel is amazing, goes down extremely smooth for such a heavy beer. Drinkability is likewise surprisingly high. I would certainly recommend this one, and look forward to trying it again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Avagadro,4.88,"I am brewing a clone of this beer and am in the middle of bottling it. I decided to go out and buy the real thing to celebrate.  A: No freshness indication on the package. Pours thick and black with a short mocha colored head. A thin film of foam sits on top of the incredibly dark surface of the beer.  S: Not bursting with aroma like I hoped it would be, but is amazing none the less. Nutty with hints of coffee and oats.  T: Absolutely filled with flavor. Nuts, oats, bread, coffee, caramel, and toffee. All of these flavors come at you in several short waves as soon as this brew hits your toungue.  M: How could I possibly describe the way this oatmeal stout dances on your tongue in words alone. The mouthfeel on this beer is by far the most amazing thing I have every experienced. Is there anyway I can give it a 6?  D: If I was a millionaire, my fridge would always be filled with Samual Smith Oatmeal Stout. It is great as a session beer, or for just sitting back and enjoying its many complexities. This beer defines the style of oatmeal stout and deserves all of the respect it is given.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,MiScusi,4.76,"Wow, what a beer. This pours a very dark black, maybe shaded with some brown, and a big creamy tan head that settles to a cap pretty quick. Can regenerate quite a nice cap upon swirling too. The beer smells pretty simple up front- dark roasted malts and maybe some sweet sugar. The taste and mouthfeel are just outstanding. Smooth and slick roasty sweetness with not much of a lingering aftertaste, except maybe a little sweetness that coats your tongue. Carbonation is pretty low, helping to give it a nice smooth mouthfeel.  --- 3-9-07 update Some definite acidity and more of a carbonation bite. More of a bittering roastiness picked up here, but still quite smooth.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

D - Very good, and very easy to drink.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Musky,4.15,"This beer has a rich and smooth tight bubbled head that nicely laces the glass as it recedes. A cocoa or coffee smell hits you first when you go to take a sip. Very smooth on the palate with notes of roast?, has a slight sweetness at the beginning finishes wet with a burnt aftertaste. This 550ML bottle will be consumed quickly as it goes down soooo smooth. Would definitely recommend!!! Cheers",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,GregBrewski,3.92,"Pours a nice deep amber color that is almost black, with a tan head that goes away but leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. A very interesting aroma, hard to really pinpoint what is really there. Its a earthy, sweet smell, some chocolate and coffee tones. The taste is good, smooth in the front, with a building sweetness that ends with some chocolate bitterness and spice in the finish.

113,571,Whitley,5,"There are many stouts and oatmeal stouts about, but this is hands down my favorite. The aroma, the taste, the color, it just seems perfect.

I love it !!!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BretSikkink,4.16,"The Celebrated Oatmeal Stout from Old Taddy pours a classic black and tan, only the dregs of the 550 mL can't fit in my oversized tumbler. Slightest hint of ruby when held to light. Head stays at a minimal throughout, lacing trickling down the sides.  The smell is earthy and reminiscent of a chocolate stout, molasses perhaps. Coffee-like roasted aroma as well.  Tastes sweeter than the aroma lets on, not cloying but substantial. The coffee notes come in with the oat flavor. I'm getting some chocolate flavors (bitter), a hint of aromatic herbal hop flavor, maybe just a hint of licorice. More earth.  Starchy but sweet, full of flavor. Goes down easily start to finish, while remaining very complex (I can't place some of the flavor) and hearty, perfect to augment the paltry 13 degrees I'm working with tonight. Another reason to celebrate the Old Brewery.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Celt44,4.68,"Poured into a pint from a bottle. Decent frothy head - caramel-colored lacing lasts throughout. Deep brown color looks great under the head. Toasted, sweet, malty aroma - truth in advertising - like oatmeal cookies. Sweetness comes to mind first in taste - unusual for a stout. Oatmeal/Chocolate chip. Hop presence seals this deal. Mouthfeel is smooth - carbonation is well-balanced for a stout. Overall a SUPERIOR, different, and TASTY stout. Highly recommended - especially for the holidays!

It was a very fresh beer. Only the freshest from hercules nyc  A: Great pour, exceptional head it actually lined the entire inside of my glass all the way down. Poured a dark brown that created a mocha head with alot of carbonation evident.  S: Smells like Oatmeal! Very subtle nutty, grainy scents  T: I have nothing to say but YuM! Very tasty beer. Tastes like bitter oats that finish with a sweet aftertaste that is very smooth.  M: Medium to full body beer.  D: I am on my way back to the store for a case! I can drink this beer all night long.

It smells of roasted chocolate malts , caramel, and a faint hop and oatmeal aroma.  It tasted very balanced and smooth. Nice roasted chocolate malts. Nice hop balance. Sweet and bitter at the same time.  The mouthfeel is crisp and full, but coul dbe a little bit thicker.  This is the most sessionable oatmeal sout I've ever had.

Slight sweet notes in there also. T/M: Wow. Extra smooth in the mouth with a good thick body and soft creamyness. Oatmeal and roasted malt are noticeable. Caramel sweetness and roasted coffee notes play hide and go seek. Slightly bitter finish and sweet aftertastevery faint. Firm and bold body with a zap of carbonation.

113,571,monkaass,4.82,I find myself seeking out this beer over and over again. This is an incredible Oatmeal stout with such a wonder presentation that starts with a smokey roasted coffee smell with a hint of chocolate that gives you a warm inviting feeling before drinking.  It tastes incredibly hearty with a tart but sweet oatmeal overtone that snaps you back to reality with a crisp hop like finish.  I love this beer.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,brdc,4.1,"A black, tar beer with a beautiful dark brown, foamy head. The smell is marvelous: first a few hints of coffee, followed by sherries, roasted malt, plums with hints of alcohol. The taste is also remarkable: starts with coffe as well, but develops a delicate sherry sweetness finishing with a cleamsing but mild acohol bitterness. It feels great on the mouth, silk and creamy. Very easy to drink for what it is.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,beermanbrian,4.22,Black color with a thin tan head. I might have killed the head by pouring to cold but there just isn't anything there to speak of. Smell of cherries and plums gives it a real fruitiness. Milky smooth chocolate flavors appear in the taste and it finishes with a butterscotch note. I've been really turned off by butterscotch flavors in beer previously but this is just the right amount to not be overpowering. Some bitter bakers chocolate notes also come through. Very smooth beer with lots of interesting flavors. Totally enjoyable and deserving of the good reputation.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Appearance: Jet black with a wonderful tan lace and an inch and half of head that lasted almost to the last sip.  Smell: is a very good smell to it which doesnt overwhelm you. I hinted roasted nuts and dark coffee, with a little molasses.  Taste: Surprisingly smooth taste to it, with a strong roasted malt flavor. There seems to be a hint of sweetness in the beer as well, that is well balanced with the Hop bitterness.  Mouth-feel: Very creamy and smooth texture, which ends up a dry.

Taste: Despite the unthikably hard water, there is a slight improvement on the smell. A little molasses is present. The aftertaste is a little smoky. The taste is consitent from start to finish.  Mouthfeel: Utterly unremarkable.  Drinkability: The most overrated beer on this website, and perhaps the world.This posesses all the bad qualities of Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock, but lacks the charm.

113,571,treehugger02010,3.36,"I bought a 12 ounze bottle from Michael's Deli in King of Prussia and poured into a pint glass. The sound it made when it poured made you believe it was thicker than it actualy was (altough it was thicker than the normal stout). It produced a good bit of head, with a decent rate of retention. The smell was very malty and sweet. The mouthfeel was a little harsh. The taste wasn't as malty as the smell was, I guess it was blended more toward taste than smell. Don't drink and review.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BBM,4.13,"Bottle is clear with gold foil wrapping and a handsome old-world label. The beer pours a deep brown, with a solid mocha-colored head, that sticks around for a few minutes. The smell is not overwhelming, but there are hints of chocolate, roasty malt, and coffee.  The taste is superb. There is a sweetness to the flavor that isn't neccessarily chocolate, but leaning that way. There are plenty of roasted malt nodes and a hint of coffee as well. This is a very complex flavor that certainly takes time to unravel. As the beer warms the flavors are accentuated even more. Mouthfeel is clean and a bit thin.  Drinkability is ok. This beer is a bit heavy though, and I can't see myself drinking more than two on any one night. Still, an excellent oatmeal stout. Highly reccomended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,diamondc,4.38,"I got this in a brown bottle.  This beer is delicious. Pours a pitch black, VERY carbonated, almost coke-like appearance. Lots of foam on this one too. The aroma is of espresso and dark chocolate. Warmed up a bit, I first tasted a hoppy bitterness and a faint alcohol taste followed by chocolate and a roasted smoky oat taste. Amazing. I could imagine drinking this for a while for new tastes.  I've yet to had a bad beer from Samuel Smiths.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,eberkman,4.83,"I loved this. Plain and simple.  It poured beautifully out of a 550 ml bottle -- near opaque black until you hold it up to the light -- then you see some fiery reds through the glass. A thick, creamy light brown head settles on top and lasts throughout the session, leaving beautiful lacing on the side of the glass.  The aroma is of dark roasted coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate.  The taste is very consistent with the aroma -- almost a pungent, sharp, mocha sensation. It finishes nicely with a bittersweet taste that lingers.  The mouthfeel is full and thick. And between the taste and the relatively low ABV, this is certainly a session beer. Particularly since it doesn't feel as heavy as you might think.  Best English beer I've ever had. Best stout I've ever had. About as close to a perfect beer as I can think of.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,wanker,4.35,"I approached this beer with some trepidation, since I - like others - had suffered skunked Samuel Smith beers in the past. Luckily, that was not to be the case this time. This beer was fresh, man -- no skunks for miles around.  Samuel Smith makes what is now my favorite oatmeal stout. That honor was previously held by Young's, but Sam Smith's is a more interesting, although perhaps not quite as smooth, oatmeal stout.  When I sipped this beer molasses was the flavor component that leaped out at me. The finish was also slightly sweet and syrupy, with that burnt molasses flavor in there.  This stout is as drinkable as they come and no sip is boring.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,DaveFL1976,4.31,"I'm really hesitant to give 5's to anything, but I can't think of anything that I'd expect out of this beer that I'm not getting. Black body, but with clear, ruby red highlights at the edges, and a super thick, long lasting and sticky head. It's a beauty. A bit chocolaty on the nose. You've got the dry, roasty baker's chocolate thing going on, but it also has a bit of sweetness. too. Taste is smooth, sweetish, chocolaty, just really nice. Mouthfeel is rather thick, with super nice carbonation and smoothness. The only downfall on drinkability is that it's a bit heavy.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Doomcifer,4.55,"Pours a pitch black, until held up to light and it appears very dark brown, with a huge frothy/creamy tan head that retains beautifully. Tremendous lacing decorating my glass as I enjoy this masterful stout.  Smell is of roasty toasty dark malts, roastiness, chicory aromas, dark chocolate, french roast coffee, and reminds me of outdorr BBQ aromas. Quite complex and stunning.  Flavor is of roasty dark malts, ripe dark fruits, mild chocolate, coffee, chicory, oakiness, burgandy, ending slightly dry. Again, wonderfully complex and hugely enjoyable.  Mouthfeel is wondrous as well. Very silky smooth, creamy, rolls around on your tongue and medium carbonation. The perfect stout mouthfeel.  HIGHLY drinkable. At 5.0% abv, and the robust and addictive flavors presented therein, this beer is breathtaking and you cannot get enough of it. A classic amongst classic when it comes to stouts.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,OStrungT,4.43,"This beer pours an inky black color, with a brown head. The head fades slowly, leaving a good lacing.  This beer has a rich malty aroma. Some chocolate and coffee mix in, but only subtly.  This beer tastes malty. A sweet caramel flavor is dominate. Some milk chocolate is also present. Not much coffee flavor. A subtly hop flavor also makes an appearence.  I think this beer is a little thin. It goes down very smooth, leaving a milk chocolate aftertaste. It is well carbonated.  This beer would probably be a great session beer. It is not high in alcohol. Also, it tastes great, and is not overly cloying.  Overall: I cant believe I have never reviewed this one. It is always good, and always welcome in my house.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

No alcohol present in the nose. Taste is a grainy coffee bitterness with a fruity sweetness like a grape or plum. The bitterness finishes it off. The hops are pretty prevalant here and the taste is never sweet. This is Samuel Smith's best brew and rightfully so. So many flavors happening here. When you put the pint glass to your face you smell a burnt coffee aroma and the taste finishes that off nicely. With the low ABV I could see this beer as a perfect session beer.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,spaced,4.15,"550 mL bottle into a pint glass. This one pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a reddish tinge on the edges. The head is a nice 3/4 in. one that kind of reminds me of the head on a root beer, only more compact. Lacing is noticable, but not anything over the top.  Smells very good; although my nose is a bit stopped up, I can smell some bready malt and maybe a tiny bit of chocolate and anise. The malt dominates the taste as well, of course. I really like the malt character in this one, and its sweetness is balanced out with just the right amount of hops (i.e. not very much). There's also a bit of a metallic taste in there somewhere -- sort of aluminum-ish (is that a word?) -- that I hadn't noticed the numerous other times I've had this beer. This is a really minor part of the taste, however. Overall, it doesn't really do much to hurt the smoothness that I love about the taste. And speaking of smoothness, the mouthfeel is nearly perfect. Smoooth and creamy, but they didn't forget to invite a little carbonation to the party. Yum.  This has always been a favorite of mine, and again I'm reminded why. After a summer chock full of hefes and pale ales, this has me really looking forward to drinking some dark beer again.

Poured with a nice toasty head that didn't last long, minimal lacing.  Smell: I very much enjoy the aromas given off by this beer. Very malty smell, though my smeller is somewhat untrustworthy thanks to allergies.  Taste: I'm not sure how to describe the taste. It's not as bitter as some other stouts. There is a lot going on there, I taste some nuttiness, and maybe a slight metallic tinge after swallowing, but I enjoy the particular bitterness it gives off. Not too harsh.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy, actually feels lighter in my mouth that other stouts I've had. Carbonation is spot on and doesn't detract from the tastes at all.  Drinkabillity: I can see why this one is rated so high. I can see myself going back to this quite a bit. After a long day out in the sun, like I had today, it's perfect for sitting back and taking my mind off of things.

The massive foamy head is dark tan and was totally retained through a moderately slow drinking. I would have to say the smell has something unmistakable indicating its from Samuel Smiths Tadcaster brewery. There is something underlying all their brews that comes out in the nose here. Beyond that, there are molasses, cola, rooty, licorice and anise smells; a very complex nosefull. The taste is so smooth and round on the palate with sweet, syrupy, molasses and chocolate flavors tempered by an alcoholic warming touch and a restrained hop presence.

I received this sample through the generousity of Paul Bussierre and Robert Hodson of Union Beer Distributors. I'm blessed.  Appearance - dark chocolate brown/black with minimal cream espresso head. Decent head retention considering the oats.  Smell - suprisingly minimal and subdued. Definite diacytel contribution and mineral/herb profile. slight burnt nuttiness in background  Taste - Superb. Wonderful balance, full-bodied but not cloying. Perfect amount of flavor hops. Delicate roasted barley and chocolate contribution. A real gem.  Mouthfeel - one of the best in the world. Absolute velvet silky smooth oatmeat contribution. I've worked with oats in dozens of brews before. It is a common misconception that oats add a full-bodied and grainy, sweet flavor. Their contribution to the flavor is actually minimal. Their strongest influence is in the texture. The oats in Sammy's Smith's stout make this beer indellible.

Mouthfeel and drinkabilty is way down. The burnt acidic oaky flavor make this one a little tough to get down. Very sweet, unjustly so.  Nice oak and earthy flavors. Big time whisky afterbite. In the world of stouts, Oatmeal Stouts just don't do it for me.  Not sure why, but my reivews of BA's top 100 end up being a little low!!????",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Freshie,3.48,"Dark as crud colour with tan creamy head, that takes it's time lacing to the side.  Smell is not too strong but is pleasant. Dark molasses sweetness with earthy aromas.  The taste is malty, molasses sweet, with coffee like bitterness. An earthy oatness comes afterwards. Deep, rich, and bitter sweet.  Cola-like body leaves flavours lingering in your mouth. A bit sticky, but the taste makes you want to keep it on your taste buds as long as possible.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,sinistermadman,4.73,"One of my all time favorites. Beautiful pour of deep brown with ruby highlights. Nice frothy head. Excellent aroma of toasted grain, mocha, fruit and on and on. Words don't do the taste justice... Flawlessly smooth and silky presence on the palate. Perfect semi sweet finish which makes this brew so completely drinkable. Bar none a marvelous creation that deserves the attention.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,palffyfan,3.65,"Appearance - Pours a thick brown with some amber tones. Also forms a caramel colored head with average foam. Looks nice.  Smell - Smells a pastry sweet, with hints of chocolate and caramel. Smell is strong enough that you can smell it even a foot away from the beer.  Taste - Pretty fulfilling beer. Slightly bitter hops, with roasted malts as the predominant taste. Its certainly interesting, but I don't think it tastes as good as the only other Oatmeal Stout I've tried (Wild Goose).  Drinkability - The beer is definitely drinkable, but better beers exist as a whole and in the category. I would probably get tired of this eventually, because none of this beer's flavors have made an impact on me that would cause me to go out and get more..",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,yelterdow,4.45,"Served at between fridge and cellar temperature in the brewery's imperial pint glass. 550ml bottle purchased as part of a special 4-pack of Samuel Smith brews.  Appearance- A showstopping display... the beer pours a rich toffee brown with ruby port highlights, then the head begins to develop. My glass is 50/50 beer to crown, and the structure is exceptional. Small, evenly dispersed bubbles gather together and eventually meld, popping and hissing into a soapy mat. A few bits of lacing here and there, but the eyes on this beer are a winner.  Smell- Wonderfully big, uncompromising aromas of chocolate, cream, coffee, sugar, and even berries... the latter being dense and jammy. A meal in itself, the nose is amazing on this beer.  Taste- First and foremost, the English character imparted largely from the brewery's water source is a huge factor in this beer's uniqueness. Crisp and dry, it paves the way for the flavors... an abundance of roasted malt, followed by suggestions of coffee and chocolate... finishing with a spritz of berryish fruit and a nice, mild hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- On the palate, this is dreamy. A light, relatively thin entrance onto the tongue expands and swells into a beautiful, mouth-filling delight... full, active, yet subtle simultaneously. Effortless... a classic in its category, and worth trying and enjoying again and again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,mnj21655,4.5,"Pours a deep black with a nice brown head. Deep red when held to the light. Nice 1"" brown head, great lacing. Sweet malts and oats combine to smell reminiscent of caramel and chocolate... simply excellent. Mild taste, slightly of bitter hops and oats but is dominated by a great malty, caramel, chocolate taste. Mouthfeel is great, nice medium body, with relatively low carbonation and a great aftertaste. Great drinkability. This is another offering from Samuel Smith's that I will definately have again. If you like stouts this is a must have.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,hckyfn9999,4.28,Pours a nice black color with ruby hues when held to light. The beer has a nice tan colored head that sticks around for a while and leaves lacing throughout the glass.  Smell is of roasted malts with some chocolate also present.  Tasted is initially chocolate with some roasted malts followed by a dark roasted coffee bitterness.  This beer is very drinkable and one of my favorites.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Rudgers73,4.1,"Poured from a foiled 12 oz bottle.  A- Dark brown, reddish highlights. Decent head with a good pour. Settles to a thin tan layer of foam and leave lacing around the top of the glass.  S- Woody, burnt, malty.  T- Dry and smokey. Hints of charcoal and sweet rye. Starts out crisp and hickory, finishes dry. A nice little bit of chemistry as the flavor changes.  M- Really interesting. A dry feeling on the sides of the tongue and a sweet feeling in the back. This gets your whole tongue dancing. Really well done.  D- I'd drink it for a night. Not too sweet, not too dry. Just right. This is a great oatmeal stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Daredevil,4.03,"opaque with silky smooth texture ... medium dry palate with a sweet & sour like finish ...  You can't go wrong with Sam Smith, the Tadcaster brewery. I haven't tasted anything average from this producer yet (the Organic Ale comes closest to ""average"") and I hope the company will never be tempted to cash in on some horrid licenced stuff ... this one is a refreshing, nutritious stout ...",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Bouncingsoul1682,5,"Among all the beers I've tried...this is still probably my favorite which says a lot. Deliciously dark stout, organic, oaty flavor that is just plain and simple. I've sampled plenty of oatmeal stouts and they honestly can't hold a candle to the magic that samuel smith puts into ever pint. It set a new standard for my enjoyment of stouts in general...as a side note, i haven't had a bad beer from samuel smith yet and i've sampled all but maybe two of them it is truly a fine brewery.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,msolar,4.78,"Quite arguably my favorite beer.  A very rich, dark color that always surprises you the bottle is clear glass (and not tinted). A thick pour that leaves a nice ½ of head at the top. Creamy with a nice bitter flavor.  An Oatmeal Stout + beautifully grilled steak and Im in heaven.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Neehan,4.43,"Pours an onyx black with a thick tan/offwhite head that thins down to a ring and leaves a webbing on the glass. Smells of nuts, toffee, caramel, coffee and oatmeal. Sweet with a touch of bitter. Exceptionally smooth taste with the same complexities of the aroma with a touch of a mild aftertaste. Very rich and creamy with a chewy mouthfeel. Thick, warming and satisfying. Very drinkable in both taste and texture though a bit filling. Makes a wonderful compliment to a meal and great as a dessert by itself.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,barefootbrewer,4.45,"This beer poured a ....well....black with a thick tan head. It has a heavy malt smell that is pronounced. The taste is quite malty. It has hints of chocolate and is maybe a bit buttery. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. This is an outstanding beer that I'd love to have the opportunity to drink on many occasions!  I'm editing my review: After 2+ years of drinking, this is still an excellent beer, but in my enthusiasm, I scored it slightly higher than it deserves. Still a solid A beer though.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,beveritt,4.08,"Poured from a 18 oz bottle into a plastic cup. Not my first choice fro serving beer, but it was all the bar had. At least it was the high quality clear plastic style.  Appearance: Dark. Slight hints of brown around the edges, but basically this is a dark, black beer. Nice, creamy light brown head. Took awhile to settle, but stayed around as a thin layer for the whole beer.  Smell: Smelles of malts and roastiness. You can detect a hint of sweetness in the smell.  Taste: Nice malt flavor, much sweeter than I expected. But not overly so. Very little bitterness, incredibly smooth. Tastes strongly of caramel.  Mouthfeel: Still had a decent level of carbonation left, even after a hard pour. Perfect level to balance out the sweetness.  Drinkability: This is a great, easy drinking stout. Nothing to over the top as far as roastiness, hops, or malt, just a nice balanced blend.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,JWFokker,4.42,"It's a good looking dark brown stout with a nice creamy head. Primarily coffee in the nose, though caramel might be there also. The flavor is where it's at though. This is a top quality stout with great balance, the malt flavor isn't overpowering and some of the coffee in the nose comes through on the palatte. It's got a pretty good mouthfeel too. This isn't a thin beer. If only it weren't so heavy you could drink this one all night. It's that good. But it is filling.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Osiris9588,4.45,"Poured from the 550ml bottle, capped with gold foil. A dark black coffee color, opaque unless held to light. Very creamy, tan two finger head, with fluffy pockets of air, great retention and ample lacing.  Aroma of roasted malt, caramel yeast, and subtel floral notes. Taste of chocolate, caramel, honey grain, toasty malts, coffee, and vanilla extract. A light, not overly complex, mouth, with a toasty, malty, gently sweet finish. Plenty of carbonation, just a whisper of alcohol.  The absence of bitterness, makes it very drinkable when served at a proper temperature, though maybe not the best example of the style. A classic.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,rarevos,4.02,"Poured into snifter.  A: Pours a dark brown with about half a finger of light tan head. Head lasted just a few seconds before it became a bunch of bubbles and a small foam ring around the edge.  S: Molasses at first with some coffee and a light indeterminate roasted aroma.  T/M: Roasted coffee bean up front. There's a rich sweetness to the middle, like caramel or butterscotch. Finish then moves to semi-sweet, like toffee or chocolate. A little dry at the end with a brief hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is silky, as I'd expect an oatmeal stout to be, though the carbonation is pronounced.  D: It's good, but it's not the best oatmeal stout I've ever had. Was a bit surprised to see this rank as high on the BA Top 100 as it does. I would absolutely drink this again, though.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,dblinkhorn,3.88,"Poured from 550ml bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance - Pours a ruby-brown but is near completely black in the glass. If you hold it up to a strong light source the beer is dark copper/ruby color. The head pours at about one and a half fingers and is a smooth brownish tan color. It dissipates quickly to a thin cap of silky head that remains for the drink. Decent lacing all the way down.  Smell - Black coffee on the nose. There are hints of dark chocolate as well. The hops are present and smell bitter and slightly fruity. The malt character is very rich and roasted but occupies a background aroma.  Taste - The bitterness of the hops paired with the roasted malt his your tongue first. Immediately after this a bit of sweetness comes through and pairs with the former tastes. The finish is controlled by a slight fruitiness along with the dark chocolate coming through nicely. A slight earthiness from the yeast and oats dominate the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - This brew is much more carbonated and lighter-bodied than I had expected, but is quite smooth. This has moderate bite all around your mouth and tongue from the carbonation, which I feel are just too much for this style. It is a full-bodied brew, but definitely on the lighter side of that classification.  Drinkability - The flavors are rich and nicely put together. Nothing is outstanding but they are good overall.  Overall, definitely not one of my favorite oatmeal stouts, but a good brew althogether. Worth a try for sure, but be warned about the higher-than-normal carbonation per style with this one.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BurnsTau,4.08,"Pours black, amber highlights, nice tan head leaves good amount of lacing.  Smells are good, carmel, coffee, chocolate. Taste is very well balanced. There are the obvious chocolate, coffee malty flavors, but a slight hop taste and great mouthfeel and body balance this brew out nicely.  If you are a fan of stouts this is a definite must try.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,RedChrome,4.42,"Pour resulted in a nice black beer which was a deep garnet red when held to light. A thick inch and a hlaf head of chestnut color shrank to about a quater of an inch, but stayed until bottom of the glass. No carbonation can be seen in the dark color. Nice lacing rings.  A very nice aroma started to hit me from the open bottle before the pour even began. A very sweet malt scent knocks at the nose. Definitly an oat finish to every sniff. A very nice balancing blend of hops helps balance the smell of this beer out extremely well. Hints of fruits include plums, figs, and surprising a light lemon scent.  A very sweet initial taste that is easy to enjoy. A taste of oat is very light and only helps to highlight other flavors. There is a very nice taste of raisins and plums. With the oatmeal hints it is almost like eating a nice homemade trail mix. A very nice bittersweet chocolate aftertaste. The major sweet flavors are helped from being overpowering by a nice hops balance.  A nice thick stout. Almost no carbonation to help not moving taste on the tongue. Taste clings to the sides of the mouth.  A very nice treat for all the senses. This would be one of my top picks to enjoy as an after dinner beer without a dessert, as it is almost sweet enough on its own merits. A very good choice to introduce yourself to the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,AmorousAngel,4.15,"Poured out thick and black with a slight red tint. Dense tan head (about 1/4""). Light lacing.  My first reaction was that there was a slight sour smell. Following this there was a yeasty, caramel smell.  Milder than I expected. I don't drink a lot of regular stouts (preferring imperial stouts), so I was pleasantly surprised at the balance between the mild, malty caramel flavor and the slighty hoppy bitterness.  Very smooth, medium bodied feel. Very little tingle from the low carbonation.  Overall, a very nice, well balanced stout. Not overly filling, so I could probably have a couple without feeling like I've had a full meal.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Smell is a little odd....wine like fruitiness, with notes of caramel, coffee, and roasted malt.

T: A fine crafted beer this is. Perfect mix of coffee, cola, milk chocolate, hops and sweet malts. Very sweet on the tongue much like red grape juice. Finishes with sugary raisins and cotton candy.  M: Medium body with solid carbonation.  D: Legendary. Outstandingly good. A prize of an oatmeal stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,drotski,4.58,"Wow. I can't believe I waited so long to try this.  Beautiful. Thick tan head with great retention.  Smells of burnt chocolate and coffee.  Taste is out of this world. Chocolate, burnt coffee, and yes, oatmeal. A grainy, fresh taste, thats quite bitter, but very well balanced.  Perfect mouthfeel. Not too thin, not too thick. Perfect carbonation.  Very drinkable.

Smell is mostly fruit, a little malt, and a very faint hint of chocolate.  Taste is qute sweet, as it should be, a little malty, a good hop balance for the maltiness, but really, there's not a lot of anything. I actually found it to be a little bland.  Mouthfeel is fairly smooth and creamy.  Overall it's quite drinkable, maybe because of the relative blandness, but it's not anything I'd turn down by any means.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,BeerSox,4.62,"Comes in a clear bottle (oddly, first stout I have seen not in a dark glass), 1pt 2.7oz with gold label.  Pours opaque black with dark thin ruby edges. Light brown creamy head that lasts forever. Lacing is exquisite. Head eventually settles to for a solid cap.  Strong molasses scent, swirls around with hints of roasted malt.  Ultra sweet creamy stout, almost like a creamy milk flavor in the finish. Smooth as silk.  Low carbonation, full bodied. Finishes clean with a pleasant aftertaste.  Very filling beer. Definitely worth the purchase, I highly recommend this beer. Very good example of an oatmeal stout, as it superbly represents the smoothness and sweetness of this style.  === 2nd try, almost 3 years after the first. Previous try gave a score of 4.45 (4,5,4.5,4.5,4.0).  550ml bottle into nonic. This time it's a brown bottle, as this is well after Samuel Smith switched from clear to deep dark brown. Same label.  The 550ml fills the nonic to the brim. Starts out as a finger, but as I added the last bits of beer into the glass, and as the head settles, all that remains is a thick cap.  Still lots of molasses and dark roasted malts. A bit of cocoa.  Lots of burnt malts, but still creamy. A touch of burnt caramel in the background. Full bodied.  Not as smooth as I remember it, but still a fantastic beer (in fact, the score went up from my last review). Recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Beerzebub,3.8,"Poured not too cold, in a goblet. Black, with two fingers of tan head that go down fairly quickly. Pleasant smell of caramel and bread, chocolate, vanilla, but the whole smell is pretty faint.  Malty sweetness - chocolate malt, roasted barley, oatmeal. Creamy body at first, but it goes watery unless swallowed a little hastily. Finish is short. Too subdued for my taste. Fine without aggressive burned flavors, but more malt and more bitterness would help, I think. I would start with some hops - There's practically no bitterness or hop flavor/aroma. And the body is good for beer in general, but not really for oatmeal stout. A good, drinkable beer, I'll try it again sometime - judging by the other reviews, this may not be a fresh bottle.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Aroma is distinct coffee, cocoa, toffee, grain, licorice, slight cherry fruitiness, and a hint of earthiness. Flavor is dark carmal maltiness with some slight sour cherry and wheat right up front. Followed with cocoa, coffee, and roasted barley. Very smooth mouthfeel, medium body, low bitterness and medium-light carbonation. Highly drinkable beer with just the right amount of alcohol.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Estarrio,4.55,"Samuel Smith's is one of my favorite breweries. One common characteristic is that all of their beers are highly drinkable representations of their style. The Oatmeal Stout is yet another testimonial to this...  Pours a dark black with some subtle red tones. Big coffee head with decent retention. Nice silky lacings throughout.  Aroma is chocolate, roasted malt, creamy cocoa. The scents could easily pass for a tasty dessert.  As all of Samuel Smith's offerings, this is one notably smooth beer. The palate is full and creamy with light carbonation lending to this drinks exceptional drinkability.  The initial tastes are very sweet. Roasted malts, burned, sugary caramel, chocolate and cocoa are all present. The high sweetness is balanced by an earthy, bread flavor, presumably from the oatmeal. The aftertaste lightly hints at bitterness. This is a great tasting beer!  A must try for anyone with even the slightest interest in the style. I firmly believe that every Beer drinker should at least try a few Sam Smith's in their endeavors!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

There is a small ring of head and no lace.  S: The stout has a very pronounced sweet aroma that reminds me of a lactose/milk stout.  T: The flaked oats give this beer an incredibly sweet flavor that goes beyond the sweetness of a milk stout. There is no hop presence, so all we have is the sweetness of the oats and a slight roasted character.  M: The ale is quite sweet on the palate, finishing longer than some stouts. The roasted flavors could make a greater appearance.

The smell was a bit muted and seemed stale in comparison to the superior American oatmeal stouts. Minor hints of toasted grain and coffee. The aroma was very yoo-hoo ""ish.""  The taste resembled yoo-hoo as well. Not a real malty sweetness or coffee acridness. Kind of right down the middle and uneventful. Not the smoothness I would expect from an oatmeal.  The mouthfeel was average and the carbonation was biting.  Overall, not bad, but nothing special in my opinion.

A very smooth tasting stout. The complexity begins to come out as it warms up.

Smell is a bit muted, with slightly burnt maltiness and a light coffee aroma with some earthy notes. Taste is rich and full, with bitter burnt chocolate and coffee malts providing the base upon which sweet fruity and caramel notes are delicately layered, making for a wonderful balance.

It had a frothy tan head with incredible creaminess and staying power. Left lots of lacing.  The smell was of roasty malt and oats with a touch of hoppiness.  The taste was incredible. It was sweet and coffee and malty all at the same time. I was eating italian at the time and this beer could not have paired better with anything else. It made me have seconds of the chicken parmesan and another pint. Had to send my pregnant wife back to the beer store (not really i had one in the fridge)  The mouthfeel was as I would expect from a oatmeal stout very creamy and full.

A faint whiff of hops was present with a swirl of the glass. A nice hop bitterness hits the palate but is gone quickly as the dark malts take over. I also tasted tannins but in a GOOD way. A good froth in the mouth sweetens it up and you can feel the silkyness that I believe is imparted from the oats. I used to drink this stout all the time before it became the norm. Upon my return I am pleased to find it robust in malt and balanced in hoppiness. The aroma alone defines this stout as excellent. And I do say this stout is actually very good when fresh from the fridge in summer, for me anyway. Cheers, Joe",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Aroma of rich sweet malt, dark roasted barley, milk chocolate and even coffee. rich in malt with a wonderful mouthfeel. Finish is slightly drying from the hops as aftertaste of roasted malts toasted grains kick back in and fade to dryness. Samuel S. is a classic Oatmeal Stout. Wonder if they would consider a cold coffee toddy version?  A must try.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Phocion,4.62,"Poured into a nonic glass pitch black. Not even a hint of light through the beer. Thick, frothy brown head with excellent retention.  Nose is of thick toasted malts, chocolate and molasses, coffee, and as it warms up, obviously, oats.  This is very sweet for a stout. Very sweet molasses and coffee bean at first, with a somewhat earthy yeast undertone and a light bitter finish for balance. As with the aroma, the oatmeal comes out as this brew warms up.  Heavy-bodied mouthfeel with little carbonation. Very creamy and smooth on the palate, and with a relatively low ABV, though the drinkability is hindered because this beer is just so heavy. Too filling, it feels more like a meal than a beer. Excellent treat, just don't expect to session this one.

113,571,hunteraw,4.05,"Appearance: Pours a very dark brown with red hues, one finger tan head, good retention. Opaque. No lace, but honestly, I think that's because I didn't clean my glass very well.  Smell: I probably didn't let it warm up enough, so it's a little more subdued than it should be, but I can smell oats, earthy English hops, dark roast malts.  Taste: sweeter than I expected (reminiscent of a milk stout), but with lots else going on, too. some chocolate, molasses, a touch of fruit at the tip of the tongue. hop flavors are pretty subdued, a good portion of the bitterness seems to be coming from the roast malts. Oats show up more and more as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, but lighter than I'd anticipated or I would probably prefer.  Drinkability: on the whole, not as good as Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout, but good. a little too sweet to be highly drinkable, for me.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Damian,3.7,"Poured a deep brown/black with a small, fizzy brown head.  Aroma consisted of intense toasted malts, some hops and a faint sweetness.  Taste was coffee-like, somewhat creamy and sweet with a slight espresso-like, bitter aftertaste.  Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation.  Fairly easy drinking for a stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,gunnerman,4.6,"Here it is one of my Favs of all time just the taste and the complexity of this beer is amazing. Every time I drink one I come to find that it has a complete different taste to it very good in my book. The appearance is of a pitch dark to almost cola like blackness to it with a nice 2 inch head and very heavy lacing on the glass. This stout has such a good smell to it I wished they bottled it as a cologne, it is that good roasted oats with hints of chocolate and arabica coffee. The taste is wonderful of roasted malts and hints of chocolate that go down nice ans smooth, leaves a great aftertaste of vanilla.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,maundythirsty,3.77,"The beer is so black-brown and opaque that I do not think I realized the bottle was clear until I had emptied it into a glass. Produced a wet, oatmeal-colored (surprise) head no more than a quarter-inch deep, but the beer held a sheet of bubbles through the glass.  Smells of roasted coffee and lightly charred malt. A whiff of grassy hops. It's a great, thick, luxurious smell.  Thaste is much the same, but the burned malt/coffee flavor blanketed by cloying sweet/sour taste. Pleasant quiet hop bittering, but that sour is enough to make me pucker a little.  I keep smacking and swallowing to shake that sour touch. Very smooth beer with a distractingly high level of carbonation for a stout. The tangy sour flavor is eventually too much, I think I would drink the heck out of this beer if it weren't there.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,egajdzis,4.36,"Poured a deep, dark brown, almost opaque color with a medium sized light tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Sweet dark fruit and oatmeal, chocolate, and roasted malt aroma with some slight alcohol. Very creamy mouthfeel, with roasted malt, chocolate, and oatmeal. This was the start of it all for me. I could drink this all day!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,kimcgolf,3.46,"This was a good beer, but nothing spectacular. Poured to a deep black with tan head that faded quickly. Deccent lacing as I drank. Aroma was hints of chocolate, but faint. I enjoyed the flavor, especially at mid-glass, but the body seemed light, and slightly watery. Had an okay finish, but nothing to write home about. Enjoyed the SS Taddy Porter and Impy Stout more.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,jamie2dope,3.78,"Appearance on this beer is completely pitch black with a thick, rocky half inch white head with some good retention. Smell was dominated with lactates, accompanied with some light coffee and chocolate. Also in the nose were oats, a hint of something metallic, and also a somewhat pungeant vinnegar smell. Taste was a bit musty, but big on the oatmeal and chocolate flavors. This is a pretty big beer to be had, but in a good way in that this one could have fallen short. I have had many oatmeal stouts that just seem big and clunky, just pure heavyness without anything to really mention except its bigness. This oatmeal stout on the other hand has alot of personality and can be easily identified as being a Samuel Smith offering. As far as drinkability, although I enjoyed it, one bomber was more then enough for me, simply too much thickness for me. You can't really go wrong with this brewery, they time and time again provide classic esamples of the styles that they brew. A great starting point for anyone getting into quality beers.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,tneel,4,"I had been waiting for a while to try this beer and my overall hype led to a little bit of a let down when I actually tried this for the first time. But my first experience had been with a bottle of questionable age so I decided to give it another try and was much more impressed the 2nd time around.  Looks the part with a rich dark color and a thick, creamy head. There is a hint of oatmeal when you open the bottle and in each drink. A very smooth, highly drinkable beer that finished strong.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,blackie,4.12,"appearance: The pour gives a 0.25"" mocha colored head that quickly recedes, leaving a nice ring around the glass and some very light lacing. The beer is a dark brown in color.  smell: The smell is a great blend of roasted/toasted malts, caramel and toffee, light English hops, and semisweet chocolate. Pretty straightforward, but smells delicious.  mouthfeel: The carbonation is just under medium, and the body medium. Smooth on the tongue thanks to the oatmeal used.  taste: Flavors of toasted and lightly roasted malt, slightly sweet caramelized sugars and cocoa, and a subtle English hop flavor. After the swallow, a light bitterness kicks in and lingers into the finish with a chalky roastiness.  drinkability: easily drinkable  This beer was one of my introductions to the craft beer scene, and it was a pleasure to revisit.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,TheLastEngineer,4.45,"12oz bottle - love the clear glass  Looks the part with a very dark color and an oatmeal colored head with good staying power and nice lacing. Smells like roasted coffee with some chocolate notes... not earthy, but a full nose to it. Wonderful taste with outstanding balance of malt and hops with oats acting as a backdrop bringing it all together. Blossoms in your mouth as it warms up... velvety heaviness punctuated by cleansing carbonation. Close your eyes and think of oatmeal and it all comes into focus. Quite drinkable for such a potentially heavy brew, thanks to top-notch smoothness and balance.  I have found this beer to be ideally suited for two applications: as the first beer of a tailgate (a.k.a. ""breakfast"") and as a compliment to cashews. An exceptional beer that I would love to taste on draught someday.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,barknee,4.33,"Pours a dark espresso brown with very active carbonation visible in the narrow base of the glass. A gen-u-ine chunky deep mocha colored head with excellent retention hangs hard atop of the glass. Aromatics of burnt caramel & tar greet the nose along with freshly sawed pine enveloping the whole package. Delectably smooth & plush on the mouth; slightly sweet from the generous malting and just the right amount of hops to bring this brew into focus. Surprisingly understated in weight vs. its heavyweight appearance. This stout flows effortlessly down the gullet, providing potentially endless lip-smacking enjoyment.

T- Light hops present in the tip of the tongue....roasted sweet malty body...The hops give a slight crispness to the finish , but it is followed by a slightly bitter chocolate aftertaste. M/D- Moderate carbonation for a stout...the hop crispness right as the finish begins makes this beer all the more drinkable....it is pretty heavy, but easy to drink....I love that a beer like sam smith's is so readily available.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Taste was a sweet malty flavor with hints of oats, molasses, oak, and a mild bit of bitter burnt malts.  Mouthfeel was slightly chewy and had some nice carbonation.  Overall a decent offering.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,DarkerTheBetter,4.63,"This beer pours a glowing dark brown cherry with a tall, creamy, pale tan head.  Smells of brown sugar and molasses blended into a dry smoky oat.  The flavor begins with a touch of brown sugar with a sweet red grape that then fades into a slightly sour and woody smoky flavor that seems to be based on a thick oat.  The mouth feel is light with a plentiful, small bubbled carbonation that accentuates the slight sourness of the flavor.  This ones really fantastic. The flavor is very simple and delicate, and the mouth feel works exceptionally well with it. Very nice.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,GCBrewingCo,4.2,"The beer poured into the glass translucent black with a tan tall and long lasting head which laced the glass.  The aroma was roasty with a strong chocolate and a slightly vinous aromatic. The aroma contained some dark fruits, raisins most notable and a strong caramel component.  The flavor was nicely dry with a strong roast and a bit of grassy character. Coffee was present, but chocolate seemed to rule alongside the roast. The flavor did contained a bit of mealy oat character and a fairly estery fruit character.  The finish was dry with lasting impressions of chocolate and coffee with estery fruit charater into the aftertaste and beyond. The body was medium full with a moderate carbonation but still an oat mouthfeel was present. A nice stout, roasty. Glad I finally got back around to it.  18.7 ounce bottle.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,NolateM,4,"Poured into a mug. Solid black, with a slightly tan head, some pretty decent lacing.  Aroma is of strong coffee and dark chocolate. A hint of smoke.  Flavor going down is DEFINITELY dark chocolate, and slightly smokey. The aftertaste has a strong coffee ice cream kind of a flavor, with a hint of tiramisu. Definitely does taste stronger than just 5% though. There is a bit of skunkiness which I could do without, but it's not a big deal. Probably slightly light-struck cuz of the clear bottle.  Admittedly, I succumbed to a BA taboo by writing this review while slightly inebriated, but the flavors and aromas were so strong (especially after drinking Red Hook IPAs, which flavorwise were lighter) that it didn't even matter if my senses were slightly dulled, this beer packed a whallop of flavor!

Apple smells abound - I think British yeast strains tend to put off this smell and flavor. Mellow roasted grain note like toast, plus sweet milk chocolate, cookies, and candied cherries.  Full bodied with a velvety smooth mouthfeel. A mellow roastiness is matched with a subdued sweetness. Juicy cookie malt center has pear and apple flavors. Long finish of burnt toast and lightly citric leafy hops.  A classic example of the style. I had my first ten years ago and it has stayed delicious throughout the span.

An excellent example of the style without any bells or whistles.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,MuenchenerKindl,4.28,"Poured from a large Pt+ bottle to a Sam Smith tulip glass. The head was big tan and sudsy, faded to a very nice lacy pad atop a very dark rich liquid. The color is a dark chocolate with browning red hues.  Smell is of rich malt roasted to a dark perfection. Chocolate is one of the main players here with coffee espresso notes.  Taste is most certainly of deep roasted malt with chocolate and coffee. A subtitle sweetness is present that plays so well with the chocolate malty taste ant the very fine yet low key hops. The bitterness of the hops and the sweet malt are in perfect harmony to blend and carry off any unwanted alcohol taste. This is truly on of the finest examples of this style.  Mouthfeel is superb. A perfect blend of sticky full bodied liquid and radiant dissolved gasses coming to life. Warming and lively with a smooth creamy texture.  Drinkability is very high as this brew has no apparent drawbacks or flaws  Cheers mates! MK",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Aroma is sweet and roasty malt with oats and grains, a nice whiff of soft chocolate with some very subtle herbal and earthy hops.  Wonderful malt complexity, Chocolate, Oak, oats and grain flavors busting out on the palate with a current of Roasted Caramel flavor with major smoked-oats and grains. Very hearty. Just right.

113,571,Mechphisto,3.29,"A beautiful pour, dark and opaque brown/black with a nutty brown head that's reasonably thick and lasts a reasonable amount of time that leaves a nice lacing. It's my second favorite looking beer. I really couldn't get much of a scent from it. I don't think I'm experienced enough to really catch the notes yet. A deep deep inhale I can smell something, faint, and it's nice, but I can't place the spice or floral or what it is. It's like a richness that's right on the edge of perception. The taste is not as sweet as I would have expected, but this was my first oatmeal stout. Didn't know what to expect, but I like my Apple and Cinnimon Oatmeal breakfast, so I think I expected something sweet subconciously. *grin* There's a sharp bitterness, almost a burnt taste. Like what I would expect burnt oats to taste like. But it's only slightly annoying. More interesting, actually. I found I had to drink it a little colder than I normally like dark beers. Just under or at refridgerator temp. (What, about 50F I think?)",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,scoobybrew,4.03,"I poured this into a pint glass. The color is very dark. It has a light brown head with excellent retention. The aroma is one of chocolaty, roasted malts. Yeast diacetal is also noticed in the aroma with very subtle hop notes. The flavor has a buttery, complex roasted malt profile. The hops are in the background, but noted on the finish. Of course, there is the signature Sam Smith yeast. It has a heavy body with low carbonation.  Overall, this is very good for an oatmeal stout. It's very drinkable and not too heavy as far as stouts go.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,sinstaineddemon,4.35,"A - dark typical stout black with a dark tan head that laces in about a minute, too dark for any visible carbonation  S - dark chocolate and roasted coffee aromas, with sweet oatmeal hints in the bouquet  T - the taste is very similar to the aroma, coffee richer, and chocolate richer, the oatmeal is heartier, what a great tasty oatmeal stout  M - smooth and balanced, so easy down  D - high, not to alcoholic, not to bitter, easy for no-crafters",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,bwyker,3.97,"A: Pours dark brown to pitch black. Moderate carbonization, which forms a foamy head with decent retention.  S: A sharp roasted malt with a coffee bite and hint of chocolate. Sweet, yet hefty.  T: Not quite as sweet as expected. The oats are hardly noticed. More of a bitter, baking chocolate and rough coffee taste. Smooth finish, with the coffee taste lingering.  MF: Thin, smooth feel. Not as chunky as other stouts.  D: Highly drinkable, especially for a stout. Not suggesting the beer doesnt have many characteristics that should be savored.

Since 534 other people have reviewed this, I don't think I really need to delve into the complexities of the brew, and hell, it's my 100th - I deserve a break!  In any case, a great brew, and one that is really a great introduction to the fact that beer does not consist of a piss colored beverage you suck down to get loaded despite its nasty taste. I went to the store with the explicit purpose of getting this beer, because I had a trend of really bad oatmeal stouts and i needed something to restore my faith in the style. This certainly worked like a charm.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

The taste was mildly sweet molassass, chocolate and oats. Not as sweet as other oatmeal stouts I've had, but some sweetness was evident. Very smooth mouthfeel - quite drinkable! This might not be the best example of this style, but it is certainly a great beer. However, I've had some regional and local oatmeal stouts that were almost/just as/slightly better for less money.

113,571,SilentSabre,4.27,"I have had this before, as well as reviewed it. It has been quite a long time, however, and I felt revisiting it was in order. It poured black with a khaki coloured, thick foamy head which was slow to dissipate. The foam clung tightly to the sides of the glass when tilted. The smell is positively fantastic. Even better than I had remembered, quite honestly. You can actually smell the oatmeal present, on top of a bit of smoke, with some sweet malt, and very, very subtle chocolate, as well. Smells absolutely delicious. The taste is very pleasant, exhibiting most everything present in the smell. The oatmeal itself is a bit less in the taste and more in the smell, but the smoke and chocolate along with the sweet, roasted malt are all very much present here. Mouthfeel is smooth and gentle. This is better than I had remembered it, or perhaps my palate has become more keen since I last tried this, either way, I am very glad indeed that I chose to revisit this one.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,clickpush,4.4,"pour: 12oz bottle to pint glass. Came out with about a finger of light tan head that dissipated quickly and left strong lacings and a large foamy ring around the outside of the glass. The color is dirty-oak-tree-bark dark: just a couple shades from black, and slightly cloudy within.  nose: The aromas of mint and chocolate overtook me from the glass as I was noting the appearance. Predominately chocolate and oats with the light addition of red fruits or berries.  mouth: Enters with a smokier feel than I'd anticipated (but not overwhelming or unpleasant). Strong flavors of bittersweet chocolate and mint - alternating between sweet and sour. The hops seemed to be a bit sour in place of the usual bitterness, but it balances well with the sweetness. In terms of mouthfeel, the beer enters strong and fizzy but as it moves back in the mouth it settles into a creamy oatmeal-y flavored mouth cover that is so damn enjoyable I don't want to swallow. The non-aggressive warm exhale concludes this excellent gastronomic experience.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,frosty,4.87,"Now this is damn good beer. Poured from a 550ml bottle at around cellar temp this beer comes out nice and dark (almost pure black in color). As I put the glass to my nose I can tell I going to enjoy this one. I get the scent of chocolate, coffee, and maybe some oats. The taste is outstanding and reconfirms what my nose has told me. All the flavors are there including some maltiness and hops. If anyone whats to get me something for my birthday I'd be more than happy with this stuff. A great stout in my opinion.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Cresant,4.23,"This is my first review and my first oatmeal stout. This Tadcaster offering appeared rather intimidating because of it's opaque brown/black presentation. Pouring from a 12 oz bottle I got two fingers of tan/white head which dissipated rather quickly to a ring and then altogether disapeared.  The smell was an inviting earthy, grain-like sweetness.  I expected this ale to be more ""macho"", but it was not as thick or heavy as I anticipated. It has a smooth, molasses taste without being too sweet. A very nice balance of malty sweetness with a dry ""hoppy"" finish.  The mouthfeel was balanced, not too rich, not too watery. Could benefit from a bit more carbonation.  I like this one a great deal, yet one was enough. I generally like to switch beers to keep the palate interested.

It doesn't appear as lights out dark as some darker roasted stouts, but it has a bit more tan appearance around the edges, and leaves a medium in size, lighter in color head. The smell, taste, and mouthfeel of this beer are the highlights of it for me. It is fairly sweet for a stout, it tones back the darker malts and highlights sweeter carmel maltiness that leaves a foamy, sweet mouthfeel. It has a dry fruity flavor that I like.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

The head is of decent size and duration, and has that nice brownish color that I love in beers of this style.  The aroma is that of roasted malt, a bit of coffee, and is sweet.  The flavor of this beer is great. It is sweet and roasty with a nice clean and bitter finish. I am not much of a coffee drinker, so I like that this stout does not have too much coffee flavor or bitterness.  The mouthfeel is also fantastic. Very smooth and almost creamy.  The alcohol is a bit noticeable, and I think it takes a bit away from the drinkability.

113,571,edskirk3,4.63,"550 mL clear glass bottle, so I can already tell how opaque black it is.  Mocha-colored cumuliform head, retains for a long time, sticking to the sides of the glass. At this point I have a premonition of supreme tastiness.  Nose is of toasted malts and chocolate. No detectable hop presence.  The taste is sublime. It's sweet, creamy, milky, slightly bitter chocolate. It is, without exaggeration, absolutely delicious. At the very end of the bottle there is a twinge of bitterness. The only thing that disappoints me is that there's only 550 mL.  Very full-bodied. I guess this is the only negative I can find in Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, because this prevents you from drinking a whole cask of it.  This is truly a dessert in a bottle.

That black cherry aroma that is almost metallic. Big grainy oats in the nose as well... nice.  Big oatmeal flavour. Very rich and thick tasting. Lots of malt.  The mouthfeel is a bit thin for what I like my oatmeal stouts to be, but its a small complaint. The carbonation is subdued, as it should be.

Plenty of hops to even things out, but sweet. Buttery toffee and highlights of coffee. Lots of vague sweetness that cant be described (maybe apples), but can be enjoyed.  D: Very easy going down.

A strong caramel like smell to it, with a bit of fruity apple peel to it. This has an awesome flavor. There is a hint of coffee type malt that comes out toward the end of the swallow and leaves me saying Wow! A chocolatey, coffee. Up front it is that sweet malty, smell, maybe a little tamed. But regardless it is amazing. The apple peel flavor in the nose is not as strong to my tongue. Mouthfeel is not really syrupy, but it has a strong body to it. Very, very drinkable.

I think it's not as rich as an oatmeal stout can be.  Unfortunately, I think because oatmeal stouts are so good anyway, Samuel Smith's oatmeal stout gets a really good rating, but in the specific category, it just can't stand up to some of the smaller brews I've had.

The smell is subtle, yet intriguing, and from first whiff the drinker can detect a slightly sweet malty aroma. The taste is smooth, sticky sweet, and almost chewy at the same time. The roasted sweet oat taste is evident. The carbonation is perfect. This Oat stout is by far the tastiest that I have discovered. Unlike some other Oatmeal Stouts, this one is creamy rather that watery, and extremely smooth.

113,571,scottoale,3.9,"Comes in a clear 550ml.glass bottle and pours an almost black, mahogany brown lively stout, with deep burgundy red hues coming through when held to bright light, this stuff is dark. The lively carbonation produces a thick, frothy tan head that's an inch thick, with heaps of micro-tiny bubbles keeping it alive. Tons of nice sticky lacing, trail to the bitter end...very appealing.  Bitter, yet sweet dark roasty malt fills the nose with an atomic strong coffee and bitter baking chocolate aroma thats fresh and spine-tingling rich. It's the kind of smell that I like to wake up to in the morning. After a bit of warming, a leafy-green hopness, peeks through the thick malt curtain of darkness.  The taste mirrors the smell with it's bitter-sweet coffee and chocolate, filling the mouth with flavors so rich, then meld with the hops to bitter and dry the dark roasty (almost burnt, if you will) malts to a beautifully balanced finish...oh yeah!  Feels smooth and velvety with a medium to heavy body, with a most pleasant aftertaste, and the alcohol hardly noticed. In the past, these dark stouts and porters didn't impress me all that much...lately I've gained quite a liking for the quality of ales that Samuel Smith has been producing, for as long as I can remember.  As tasty as this brew is, unless you really love your stouts, I doubt you will be able to drink more than one or two of these in a sitting...enjoy!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

T: Chocolate with grains, oatmeal, mild hop bitterness mostly in the aftertaste. Tastes good, though it is very subtle. M: Good carbonation, though it is oddly thin to me for a stout. Goes down very smooth. D: Would be a nice stout to have around. It is good, but it isn't great. Certainly worth a try.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,BlueHammer,4.42,"This beer pours opaque, a dark brown with a thick tan-colored head. Head retention is good, and lacing is evident.  The smell is sweet and nutty. The taste is also sweet at first. The oats are apparant but not overwhelmingly so. This beer finishes slightly hoppy which provides a nice balance to the initial sweetness. It is smooth, which is accentuated by that sweetness at first.  Overall, this beer is warm and comforting . . . it feels familiar! It is a terrific end to a winter night - it leaves you feeling warm inside.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ProfessorHops,3.56,"Appearance- handsome. A strong looking drink with a nice looking thick tan head. Non deceptive.  Smell- sweet and clean. Elements of honey and wood.  Taste- rounder than most stouts. Truly malt influenced. The trademark stout flavor is introduced in the finish.  Mouthfeel- perfect!!!! I loved the feel, not to thick not to thin. Able to quench, but is still a stout.  Drinkability- when it's your first drink and your thirsty, goes down easy. But with a belly full of ale, this beer is moderately easy to drink.   An easy to drink stout, but not a traitor to the traditional robust flavor of the stout flavor we've all came to love. Cool!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Nose is dominated by chocolate malt and coffee aromas. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick but not syrupy.  Taste is malty, chocolaty, and nutty with underlying subtle sweetness and a wiff of alcohol arises late. Hop bitterness is short lived and finish is clean and surprisingly dry.  Clearly an impressive oatmeal stout.

Their is definately a roasted malt flavor along with some sugary flavor. I tasted a bit of a nutty quality in the beer. A little oatmeal taste and some sort of hoppiness. *Maybe a bit skunked? Lighter in body than I would have expected. It when down pretty good. It seemes fairly well balanced, and drinkable.  I am a firm believer that clear bottles can hurt a beers flavor, and I defineitely get the same thing in here that I got in their Nut Brown Ale. I think Samuel Smith would be better served with using dark bottles, but thats just my $.02. I would still try other brews of theirs, but won't grab for this first if I had other options.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

S- there was very little nose to this beer. some malts but that is it and this is the only flaw this beer has.  T- malt and then a smooth clean finish. I was expecting the requisite bitterness that comes on the finish with most stouts. Not here.  M- perfectly thick , but not too much so  D- really surprisingly drinkable. This is a surprise, most of the time stouts are one and done with the thickness and the complexity. This stout however balances the complexity with a crisp smoothness that makes it oh so drinkable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,JMD71,3.17,"Appearance: Deep chocolate brown with traces of cherry-red. Thick, 1-finger head when poured. Lacing tight around the sides of the glass.  Smell: Very vinous, boozy, alcohol smell. The fermented grains (oats?) are dominant in the aroma which is almost overpowering & unpleasant, Past the alcohol smell, you can note the roasty malts & toasted oats. It would be nice for that character to be more present over the alcoholic smell.  Taste: Wondefuly creamy, smooth flavor with very little of the alcohol that was present in the aroma. Slightly smoky, roasty character augments the oaty, malty base accompanied by a slight espresso tinge. A slight bitter hop flavor is noted in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Silky, smooth & creamy. Clings to the sides of the mouth as it goes down....smoothly. Finishes with a slightly cloying bitterness.  Drinkability: This is a great late night sipper. Would be wonderful on a cold night before a fire to warm the bones after a day skiing. One to be enjoyed slowly & with appreciation of the numerous flavors contained in this carefully crafted stout.  Comments: I enjoyed this Oatmeal Stout having never had one, of any brand, before. Initially, I was a bit put off by the aroma. The strong alcohol smell was overpowering to such an extent that it overcame the rest of its aromatic character. Once past the aroma, the wonderful flavor quickly charmed & endeared me to this stout. I would like to try others in the same style...",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Jcdolan,3.91,"I got the Samuel Smith mix pack and might I say that it is the coolest mix pack I have ever come across. It came with three 1 pint bottles consisting of the The Celebrated Oatmeal Stout, the Nut Brown Ale, and the Old Brewery Pale Ale. It also came with a nice glass, two coasters and and awsome chart that shows all their beers along with details of the beers' history, ingredients, serving suggestions, gravity, and every other detail that one could think of. Very impressive, but on with the reveiw.  Poured a black color with a thick brown head.  Smells almost sweet at first and upon futher examination I smell an almost nut smell with some oats mixed in.  The taste is unlike the smell but very good. Taste is a nut taste with oats. Finishes very sweet.  Mouthfeel is exellent. Very smooth.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Has an impressive tan head that slowly recedes down to just covering the glass. Lacing is thick. The smell is not particularly impressive, some malt, nothing outstanding. The taste is malty and incredibly smooth. The taste is slightly sweet, incredibly mellow and the mouthfeel is rich. There is no ""getting used to"" the taste. It is simple, nicely blended and has no unpleasant chalkiness, bitterness or other aftertaste. This is something I could slowly sip all night.

Creamy, sweet aroma with oats apparent and a hint of chocolatey roastiness.  Wow! Big dark malt flavors, deeply roasted and chocolatey. Somewhat sweet, and slightly sour, with gentle, subtle hopping, a slight prickle on the front of the tongue. Impressive depth and complexity for a 5% beer.  A very creamy, smooth medium to full body, coupled with low carbonation makes this a rich, luscious mouthfeel. This richness made me enjoy drinking this beer slowly, and it makes not so drinkable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,dieselboy914,3.89,"I tried this oatmeal stout simply because it was a Samuel Smith... and usually their stuff is really good. But there were both ups and downs to this interesting brew.  It poured pitch black into a regular glass, with very little head quickly disappearing into a fine lace around the rim. The scent is quite strong with the obvious oatmeal and hints of raisin... someother fruit that i can't point my finger on, thought it's not fig. Very pleasant and nice to look at, but that's where the pleasantries end. You take a sip and initially the mouthfeel is mild and underwhelming, with a grainy malty taste. Not much to get excited about, and then the aftertaste hits you when you swallow. A little on the bitter side, and quite bland with no taste. I can see this as a nice addition to a meal... but on it's own it's a little bit disappointing. Not a bad beer, though.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,IntriqKen,2.22,"I know...this is a world class rated beer. And I like...no LOVE oatmeal stouts. This was my second bottle of this brew and I wasn't impressed. I may be spoiled with more American versions of Oatmeals out there. Poured a deep, deep amber black with a small cream head that disappeared quickly to a fine lacing. Aroma was of sweet toasted or burnt malts...I missed smelling any chocolates or coffee. Mouthfeel was thin and weak to me....very light in carbonation. Taste was sort of bland...sweet malt but nothing fresh or standoffish...again, no chocolates or coffee and an unpleasant aftertaste..possibly old bottles, although my tastings have been months apart and from different sources. Slightly sweet aftertaste with no noticable alcohol burn. I could have finished the bottle but simply didn't want to.

113,571,asabreed,4.38,"1 pt. 2.7 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Huge head from a vigorous pour. Stays at about 1"" as I drink. There's a lot of clumpy lacing, too, which I suppose goes with the territory of the vigorous pour. Color is dark dark amber, and the head is mocha.  Smell: Lots of nice sweetness from the oats, with some dark, sweet chocolate, not overpoweringly toasted and burnt malt, and hints of coffee or mocha in there too. Also some hop bitterness creeps in as it warms a bit.  Taste: Much initial oat, malt, and chocolate sweetness in the beginning. Soon it mellows out and the sweetness becomes quelled a bit by the hops. Finishes sweet at first, then goes into toasted malt, a bit of chocolate, the oat sweetness, and finishes long and complex with all of that and some hops in the mix.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, rich, fairly full-bodied, and awesomely creamy. Perfect amount of carbonation to lessen the possibility of the cloying nature, which here isn't present.  Drinkability: Definitely one of the best of the style. It may not be the best, but it's not overrated. And especially for the price, this is a sipper and a treat to boot. Quality stuff all around, and the perfect amount of alcohol so you can have a few in a session too if you're going that route.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

This stuffs good enough that you won't sit around staring at the head.  Chocolate is the prevailing smell and taste. This stout is sweet, Not much roasted flavor.  Oatmeal is supposed to add proteins that boost the mouthfeel and body of a beer. Seems to me that the texture effect is pretty subtle. This is fine, because I find the creaminess of a Guinness a little bit phony.  Very quaffable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Body is root beer brown, dark but not opaque, with bright, visible bubbles.  Smell: Mostly dark malts; molasses, a tinge of soy sauce, rich caramel truffles, and floral hops.  Taste: Nice earthy flavor, very thick with dark malts. Good, stocky oatmeal flavor. Pleasant yeasty tang, especially in the finish. Also has some rich cocoa notes. This is very well-balanced and quite tasty.  Mouthfeel: Excellent! Smooth yet thick and grainy. Not cloying at all.

Tan colored head was slightly sticky, and hung around for the duration of the beer.  Smell - Molasses, chocolate, and some dark berries gives a sweet smell. I also smell coffee beans.  Mouthfeel - Velvety smooth, but not overly heavy for a stout. There is a slight tingle from the carbonation.  Taste - Starts off with oat sweetness, then the flavor of roasted nuts and chocolate comes through. There is an earthy quality to the overall flavor. Finishes with a mild coffee and hop bitterness.  Drinkability - Often described as a meal in a bottle, but I could drink a couple of these in an evening without much trouble. As far as stouts go, very drinkable.  Overall - This one gets better and better as you drink it. The flavors really come through as it warms. This isn't my #1 oatmeal stout, but it is very close. It isn't ""too"" anything; its well-balanced, flavorful, and very drinkable. If I could afford to, I would give this to anyone wanting to try a stout (but it is too expensive to be giving out willy nilly).

S - Roasted coffee, chocolate, malt, some sourness, a tiny bit of alcohol.  T - Roasted nuts, burnt coffee, chocolate, brown sugar and molasses. Sweet and rich. This gets better as the glass becomes more empty.  M - Semi rich and creamy - smoooth finish. I like these beers just for the mouthfeel alone.

Well this stout is nothing like those -- sweet tasting -- great smell -- easy to drink -  I don't know that I would pair it with food -- I enjoyed it as an apertif.  The alcohol is hidden in the aroma and chocolate taste -- mouthfeel was much lighter than I anticipated.  Enjoyable and I will have it again.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,goochpunch,4.5,"Pours out a licorice body crowned with a frothy, dark khaki head. Some isolated, spotty lacing. Smells of a tiramisu in which a touch of brandy was added into the mix. Flavors kick off with a chocolate and coffee wallop followed by what I always recognize as Samuel Smith's fruity, chewy malt profile I've tasted in each of their offerings. Not much of a hop presence, but the roasted bitterness takes care of the rich sweetness of the brew. Has the signature oaty softness in the mouthfeel as any oatmeal stout should have. A slightly syrupy finish in the mouth is the only flaw here. This is one to sip and savor, for sure, but it's hard to keep the glass down.  This was the first oatmeal stout I ever had, about 3-4 years ago. One of the few beers that has stayed with me throughout the years of developing my palate.

S: You smell a chocolate & coffee sweetness and a roasted malt aroma with just a bit of alcohol.  T: The taste isn’t as sweet as the smell containing a smoky coffee flavor. No bitterness at all and a slightly sweet after-taste.  M: Very smooth, with a heavy body and light/medium carbonation. I’ve seen the word “chewy” thrown around in other reviews and this is the first beer that I’ve had that identifies with that term. I’m considering that a good thing.

The smell is distinct and interesting, quite a good example of what sets apart on oatmeal stout from its bretheren. There are earthy, slightly spicy notes from the oats - almost like roasty molasses, but no distinct coffee or chocolate.  Smooth flavors; Zippy for a stout, there are hints of grapefruit peel, maybe a little coriander; Just a little buttery diacetyl. Slight coffee flavors lurk beneath - the oats add quite a lot of distinctly different and interesting flavors to the beer.

I remember the aroma being off-putting when I first tried this about a year and a half ago, but this is actually a very nice aroma.  T: Maltier than I'm used to with a stout, sweet but not really cloying. No real hoppiness of dryness at all. Again, much better than I remembered -- my palate has really changed since I first tried this.  M: Chewy is the word I'd use to describe it, almost as if it has some chunks left in it.

There is an earthy characteristic but also a coffee smell. MMM good on the taste. Chocolate backed up with a nutty, coffee taste. Very smooth rich tastes with a thick body that goes down like syrup. Tasty bits of coffee build up the aftertaste and very sublte notes of alcohol. The body and drinkability on this are outstanding to say the least.

More toffee flavors, but like burnt toffee from the roasted malts. A slight sweet undernote. very nice. A bitter chocolate touch comes out, especially as the beer's temp. goes up. aftertaste isnt spectacular, but more sweetness comes out with some coffee, like a very sweetened coffee with lots of cream.  Mouthfeel is great. Very smooth. Not the fullest mouthfeel i've gotten from this style, but it is full. Great balance. The perfect amount of carbonation.  Overall a great beer.

To the nose, the oddball oatmeal tang is present, although with this one it is more astringent than I'd like. Not a lot of sweetness depth.  In the mouth, this is a silky smooth stout. The creamy maltiness is overwhelming - but pleasant. Hop character is somewhat lacking, but who cares. Layers and layers of roasted malts abound.  The body however is much too light for my taste. For a beer with such over the top malts, this shoud have more chewiness to it. Very metallic and thin on the tongue and finishing. An organic finish is evident, but it is not hearty enought to speak about.  Musings: I've had plenty of these in the past - first review. I do love the taste of the beer - the body and feel is just too thin for my liking. Put it against McNeill's or even Troegs and the skinny feel is clearly evident.

The smell is sweet and spicy. The spicy being part mineral water, party earthyness, the sweet being oatmeal and toffee. Quite a unique aroma, especially for a stout. The taste is bright in nature, malt begins with a slight acidic tang, a roasted bitterness follows, with no real hop presence. Oatmeal with sugar is the obvious example, but it's not overly sweet.

Deceaving mouthfeel that I want to call medium, but finishes rather light instead. Low carbonation. Finishes dryer, with lingering roasted nutty flavors. This one is a good one ... maybe a very good one if you particularly like this style. Smooth and a little sweet. Worth a try!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,nouseforotacon,4.52,"This one poured out a standard jet black stout color with a creamy and frothy tan head that had great retention. Very nice.  The smell was wonderfully balanced; a mix of sweet, toasted malts and oats dominated, with a touch of milk/cream. Delicious and inviting aroma, but not exceptional due to a very faint trace of alcohol towards the end of my tasting.  The taste was overall very smooth, creamy in the mouthfeel, with a balanced finish that contained the oatmeal paired with light, bitter hops. A sweet, milky taste was present, giving this a rich, medium body. Enjoyable, but not too thick or too heavy.  I could simply not put this one down. It's rather easy to see why this one is a craft beer classic. Delicious and highly drinkable",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,rabsten,3.76,"550 ml bottle poured into a pint glass.This one came out of a three-pack sampler (with the Old Brewery Pale Ale and Nut Brown Ale making up the remainder).  Very dark, but the head was light in colour with fine/medum texture. The head disipated quickly and left only minor lacing.  Smell was toasty/malty. Typical stout.  Flovour was nice and crisp for a stout. Some roast in the malt gave it a coffee-esq quality, but not overly so. It was refreshing and left me wanting a second. the package only had the one, so I tried the Pale Ale next.  Overall: Nice, but its not going into my regular rotation.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,johnyeast,4.28,"Dark brown almost black in color with a carmel brown one inch head. A toasty, granola smell. A smooth, sweet taste that lingers into a nice aftertaste. An oh, so drinkable stout that I feel sets the standard for oatmeal stouts. Often I use this beer to introduce stouts to my friends who prefer lighter beers. This is one of my favorites and I wish to try on tap some day.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,doppelmeup,4,"Poured a bottle into a pint glass.  Very dark, some hints of red and tan, but very dark. Not much light gets through. About a half inch head that dissipated, leaving a ring of foam around the edges.  Smelled chocolatey, some caramel and some coffee. Also a bit of a candy apple smell.  Smooth, thick and creamy. Come chocolate, some coffee, some pumpernickle bread flavors. Not as striking as the Imperial Stout.  Light carbonation and thick mouthfeel. Interesting feel. Slightly bitter aftertaste and then it leaves the palate.  Nice beer. I prefer the Imperial Stout, but this is also good.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,bennetj17,3.55,"Very black in color, a short tan head develops slow during the pour, and then fades quickly. The carbonation appears to be average. Smell is dry and chocolate-y, mildly hoppy. The aroma is a bit off, it reminds me of drywall, oddly enough. The flavor is like dry coffee, a bit woody, and slightly sweet. The finish isn't all that bitter, but it does taste slightly burnt/toasty. The beer feels well carbonated, its thick but remains smooth. Drinkability isn't bad for this one. I feel like my review is lower than most and I can't figure out why. In the past I've liked this beer more, and this time I got more than one bottle from more than one source to make sure it wasn't skunked, but I feel the same way about it each time now. I think I'll stick with the Imperial Stout instead...",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,JudgeRoughneck,4.62,"No matter how many times I have this beer, I always forget the bottle is clear until I pour it. The beer is so totally opaque that it just looks like a black bottle. Its a straight up 8-ball blackbeer with about three fingers of rich, creamy, tan head that thins quickly but never goes away. No lacing this time around.  The nose is alcohol, fresh grain, dark chocolate, and a touch of that famous green apple. Taste starts with a mild dark chocolate/hop bitterness infused with a bit or green apple tartness. Goes metallic for just split second before that dark malt profile comes parading down the tounge. Actually got just a touch of oat in the finish.  Mouthfeel is rich and velvety. I have a few bottles of this old stand-by a year and it usually makes me wonder why I bother with anything else. Many thanks to Jwff for the Sam Smith gift pack.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,skillerified,3.58,"Dark, dark red mahogany in color. Reasonable sized head that looks a little fizzy and faded pretty quick. Pretty good, sticky looking lacing.  Dark berry scented. Vinous and licorice scents are intertwined. A cold alcohol bite too. Not particularly strong scented though.  Definitely tastes of oats. Some sweet chocolate and berry flavors. A dark licorice flavor too. Again, not particularly strong. Seems a little weak actually.  Sweet, creamy mouthfeel. A touch of bitterness at the finish. Meduim bodied. Mildly aggressive carbonation. Not too bad on this end.  Not a bad little stout, but it does feel like a little stout. I was hoping the flavor would be a little more aggressive.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,sitbooboosit,4.13,"The beer pours a dark ruby to black colour with a really nice looking inch of mocha, tan head. At first the smell was a little vinous which got me worried, however the smell of roast barley soon made its way through the fog and into my head although not as pronounced as I was expecting. Tastes of roasted barley with nice carmel tones. lots of coffee flavour, although the slight tartness i'm getting off this beer is making it taste like day old coffee. The mouthfeel is absolutely great; lucious foamy velvet sliding down my throat. yum. An easy beer to drink a few of although rather filling. I enjoyed the beer, but would like to have another bottle from a different batch. it tasted a little old to me. understandable vancouver is a ways away from Jolly Old.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,PeatReek,4.22,"Appearance: typical stout: black. Actually more transparent than some; clear ruby highlights in the bottom 1/3 of the glass. Very fine light tan head is quite durable; still about 1/4"" after several minutes.  Smell: huge sweet nutty aroma. Slight roasty smell after a few sniffs.  Taste & mouthfeel: It's probably related to the nice sticky head, but the body here just seems incredible -- chewy and thick. As for the flavor... wow. So complex. Nuts, bread, caramel, vanilla, smoke. Is this oak aged at all? Certainly doesn't taste like a whiskey bottle, but has some of the woody overtones I'd expect from barrel aging. I think it actually tastes a little like oatmeal! A slight roasty bite late in each sip is nicely balanced by thick nutty sweetness.  Drinkability: Boy, this is one thick beer, and as filling as one would expect from this thickness. Still, I'd feel OK spending a session on the Taddy oatmeal stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,1759dallas,4.42,Oh how I love this beer. Even starting to write a review about it makes my mouth water. The smell is fantastic! A rich roasted malty flavour that attacks your senses. You have to pour this beer then let it sit for a while. When this beer is too cold it destroys the taste. Like most good beers in my opinion. When it gets to the 55 degree mark start your drinking. You'll notice that about halfway through your already considering another one. Order it before you run out! If your not familiar with English brews don't be surprised by the lack of head. Thats a normal trait of good English beers. Enjoy.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,musingmonkey,4.11,"This beer is one of the most aesthetically pleasing I've poured. Deep and dark, with a solid, puffy head of creamy-tan appearance. It looks, come to think of it, like a giant goblet of espresso, complete with a glorious crema crown. Scent is a sweet combination of treacle and unobtrusive yeast. The striking initial flavour is molasses and burn toast. Sweet, but slight bitterness in the finish that linger thick on the back of the tongue. It feels medium bodied, but lightened somewhat by its carbonation. A very drinkable stout. Oat flavours are not as evident as I'd anticipated, nor is it particularly complex. I was probably expecting a little more, and yet it is still very hard to fault this beer, as my score will ultimately reflect. Not a beer I will be rushing back to, but a solid, quality product nevertheless that I know will pass over the lips happily enough somewhere in the future.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Every time I took a sip I swore I tasted something different. The most overwhelming taste is the molasses and chocolate taste with a slight oatmeal taste.  M - medium carbonation and medium to full body..  D - This is hands down the most complex and delicious beer that has ever touched my lips.

113,571,mentor,4.43,"This is it. This is the beer that started me on my transition from pounding cheap crap beer to enjoying quality craft beer. I recall it being absolutely wonderful nectar. Let's see how far I've come.  Pours a one-finger brown head over a pitch liquid. Smells soured black patent and dark caramel. Cherry sour with wet sweet and chocolate. Tastes rich dark caramel dominating cherry sour from underneath. Rough roast is tamed by gentle fruity esters and a hint of butterscotch. I'm also distracted from the concentrated coffee by the silky smooth mouthfeel. Hop flavor and bitter I'm not finding. Overall this beer is well balanced, falling towards sweet over roast. Md-light body helps the beer flow. An enjoyable visit.  Not as good as my fond memories built it up in my mind, but still a quality product. I think it was the silky smooth mouthfeel that caught my attention so long ago, rather than the flavor.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,geexploitation,4.55,"This is a wonderful beer -- one of the classics.  Pours thick and dark, with a velvety flow, while releasing a thick, tan head, that sticks around and is easily whipped up for more volume. Beautiful. The nose is wonderfully complex -- I've been drinking this for years and there are still new things that come out for me every now and then -- some banana... some brown sugar, perhaps?... oloroso sherry? The flavor is deep and dark. Wonderful, rich malt flavors, with a touch of vanilla and the slightest touch of bitterness, seemingly introduced only to highlight the malt. Finally, the mouthfeel is perfect. A beer this rich ought to be syrupy and thick on the tongue, but this isn't; instead it's hefty but not too much so, with those oatmeal sugars gliding over the tongue and producing exceptional drinkability.  Highly, highly recommended. This ode to malt is fragrant, tasty, and luxuriant. Get it. Now! :)",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Smells sweet, toasted, caramel with a hint of butterscotch (you heard it here first).  I have to admit to not liking oatmeal as a kid. My mother would put in some brown sugar and some raisins. I still couldn't stand it. If my mother had put a bottle of Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout in front of me I would have gone through a lot more oatmeal as a kid.  Overall I enjoyed this one.

113,571,MSchae1017,4,This beer was tasted in an imperial pint Glass from a 550mL bottle.  This beer poured a dark almost opaque black with hints of amber. There is a sizeable frothy tan head that dissapates mostly but leaves a little froth the whole way down the beer. The beer smells fairly sweet with roasted malts of chocolate. The taste is very sweet but overall very similar to the smell. The mouthfeel is thick with a good level of carbonation and a little drynes. The drinkability suffers a little bit due to the beer being so sweet but it is still a great drink,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,mrasskicktastic,4.43,"A - Dark brown, nearly black, but a ruby tint shows through when held to the light. Pretty! A thick brown two finger head dissipates in about ten minutes leaving thin rings of laicng down the glass.  S - Sweet, elderberries, a bit of caramel, chocolate and coffee malt, but they are all very, very faint compared to the sweet elderberry aroma.  T - Sweet molasses and caramel malt with a bit of elderberries and currants that linger through to the finish. A slight smokey character joins the fray toward the end. It's quite good.  M - Carbonation is high, feeling is slick and very refreshing.  D - Absurdly drinkable. An ideal session. Perfect for foods. This is an outstanding beer.

113,571,Vancer,4.53,"My favorite cross-over brew from many years ago, cant believe Im just now reviewing  guess I always knew this was a classic.  Easy on the pour, fellow! Produces a massive rocky brown head, ice cream looking. Oh, then chocolate malts, anise, and coffee in the sweet aroma.  Taste is unparallel, above items plus hints of charcoal, burnt toast, and fruity raisons. Close to being a RIS with the dry undertones.  The whole 550ml bottle is rich and robust, chewy, - very full bodied and all the while very enjoyable. Great sipper in the winter  hell, this one would go great in the summer too!

The rich flavor includes a deep roasted profile (coffee, chocolate, etc.), that sweet and sour, acidic lactic quality, some caramel, a touch of sweet fruitiness, and some strong burnt bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is pretty full and the carbonation mildly active.  Like some many of Samuel Smiths beers, its classic of the style and I personally havent found too many other oatmeal stouts that I can honestly say are better.

Once poured into a pint glass , color is very dark brown. (basically opaque black unless held to light, which reveals deep red around the edges) Nice thick tawny head which becomes moderate , made up of tiny bubbles with larger ones throughout. Taken to the nose , very nice roasty odors of chocolate , coffee, barley , and maybe even a little raisin. The taste is a very complex , very roasted , smooth blend of choclate , dark fruityness , and coffee which finishes bittersweet and extremely smooth! The mouthfeel is fairly silky and heavy.

Aroma is mainly of fruits, especially a dried raisin or prune smell. Slight hints of burnt cocoa and chocolate as well. Taste is mostly burnt, with hints of sweet chocolate and a syrupy fruitiness. Mouthfeel was a bit thin but not too bad, actually coated the palate a bit and complemented the fruity and bitter finish. Not a bad beer for every once in a while, but not anything to rush to your local store for.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,whartontallboy,4.28,"Pours out a black color with brown edges and a thick brown head that is rocky and holds quite well. Some lace is left, but not in huge sheets.  Smell is roasted barley, slight coffee notes, some chocolate, and a bit of dark fruit. Hoppiness is minimal but present.  Flavor is roasty as well, but it lets in more chocolate and coffee bitterness as well as a slight vinous character and some dark fruits, almost a raisin flavor sneaking into the back. Body is chewy and smooth, quite nice.  Overall: Man, I love this one as much as ever.

The beer poured a dark brown color with its true deep red/brown color only evident under bright light. The head is a toffee brown color, a decent size, and sustains itself decently. The mouthfeel is smooth with a hint of carbonation and the taste is solid with an obvious toasty flavor. Earthy flavors are well blended in this beer and some of the nut can almost be tasted from Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale.  Overall this is a very enjoyable beer that I wish I could drink to my heart's fulfillment without going broke. I could sip these and eat chocolate all night.

There are quite a few bubbles rising. The beer leaves quite a bit of lacing after drinking.  Aroma: The caramel and roasty aroma are the most noticeable when you smell the beer cold. Deeper within, the beer has a sweet cereal-like aroma. You can even smell pancakes in this beer somewhere. As the beer warms a bit, you can really start to notice the British hops coming out.  Taste: This is a seriously tasty beer! It is sweet pretty much the entire time. It has a nutty and toasty flavor that you notice first, and this fades to a caramel-like sweet finish to linger among a smooth and slick mouthfeel. Excellent!  Opinion: Go Sam Smith's! This beer is a whole lot better than I even remember it to be. It has a superbly crafted balance with just enough sweet and slickness to make it feel like you just had dessert.

I will leave my mind open to another oatmeal stout being on this level but for now this is the greates beer In this style in my book.  Notes: I think this would be the easiest stout to enjoy.

Flavor has roasty, sweet, dark malt flavors of molasses, pumpernickle bread, prunes, raisins, port wine tartness, and a light dusting of cocoa. Delicate, nuanced flavors abound.

This is a well regarded beer and I've been looking forward to this a while, although it'll have to go a way to top Young's IS. The first thing I notice about this beer is that it's very heavy in the mouth and an extremely round mouthfeel that envelops your whole mouth with the flavors. Wow, this beer is a full meal. The principal tastes are dark malt, coffee, sugars, and a pleasant full creaminess. This is a beautiful beer.

Sweet chocolate malts accompanied by aromas of molasses, butter, light spruce, raspberries and a touch of prune-like tawny port. The taste is of course very malt-dominant bringing in flavors of chocolate and coffee. Theres just the slightest hint of citrus making the hops presence just barely noticeable, but they add a nice bitterness to the finish. It has a medium body, dry texture and very low carbonation.

More than a faint hint of skunkiness too...and unfortunately this is all too common with the Sam Smith's I have tried. Someone please inform me the rationality of having clear beer bottles that intend to be shipped halfway around the globe. Obviously this would be much better in it's home country, but I just can't give it the really high marks it probably deserves until the brewers can properly bottle and ship their beers to my door. Do this beer (and yourself) a favor and let this warm up..the flavors get much more evident and mouthfeel is very creamy, despite it being somewhat thin.

Taste is almost perfect for what I would expect in this style, Classic stout flavors shine through with mild coffee and chocalate as well as some more unexpected nutty suggestions. The part where Sam Smith's is set apart though is the hop bitterness, they have this down perfectly which creates an amazingly balanced beer which is both filling yet wets the appetite.

I held my glass up and thought, damn, can't even see through this stuff. I held it up to the light, still can't see a damn thing, only traces of deep red glancing off the bottom of my glass, absolutely gorgeous. My first thought when I took a drink was, hmmm oatmeal, go figure. On subsequent drinks I began to get earthy, bread, kind of organic flavors....very nice.

Pours just beautifully into my giant pilsner. A huge 2 inch head that foams up, but eventually settles down to cover the surface of this deep reddish-brown opaque brew. Lots of lacing.  Smells like a good stout should. Malt, coffee, and earthy. Roasty nature to the smell. Promises wonderful things ahead...  Taste is very good. A fantastic balance of bitter and sweet. Delivers on everything the smell hinted at. Its rather sweet for a stout, reminds me a lot of Mackeson's XXX. Great aftertaste and a pleasant warming feeling in the back of your throat. Creamy and oh-so smooth. Not terribly complex, but what is there is splendid.  Samuel Smith's Oatmeal is a great stout. I have two issues with this beer. First, there is no dating information on the bottle (or any of Sam Smith's brews) so you have no idea if what you buy is 2 or 24 months old. Secondly, they use a clear glass bottle, which I suspect has been a factor in the few funny tasting bottles of Sam Smith I've had. I know, I know, a lot of microbrews are guilty of these same faults, but really -- if I'm going to spend $3 per bottle, it's not asking too much.  That said, this is a fine beer and certainly worth a try. It's my favorite of Samuel Smith's brews and I'll certainly buy it again. If you cant afford this, an excellent alternative is the aforementioned Mackesons.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,andjusticeforale,4.35,"This poured nice and black into a tulip pint with a traditionally tan head.  The initial smell is big deep caramel and bittersweet chocolate pools ; as if you are standing over the vats, but also some pub bitter hoppiness.  The taste is like the kiss on the cheek from an old friend. It starts out with a solid ridge of black malt flavour; some subtle flavor hoppiness(and very slight bittering hops); and then there is the finish. This is not as sweet as I remembered. The flavor is the subtlest hint of sweetness, wrapped up in a flavor that can only be described as the essence of Bailey's Irish Cream Liquer, which obviously compliments the coffee flavor of this stout. This is followed by a very slight bitter-dryness, much welcomed.  I could not imagine that the mouthfeel could be any better, perhaps a personmal preference would be to a silkier and smoother feel, but in reality this is an oatmeal stout so some earthy chewiness is really not unwelcome.  This is a classic, of course, not because I said so, or because you say so. That being said, wiser men than me, by the score no doubt, will leave weightier opinions. What I may be able to add is that this beer is certainly not as sweet as you may remember, and on that note, it deserves true characterization as a world class stout, along with imperials and exports, double americans, and the like.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Tastes extraordinarily smooth, rich, and full. But still maintaining a magnificant balance. Deep and with plenty of complexity.  Pricey, and worth it. You can easily drink the entire 4-pack in one sitting.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BigDaddyWil,4.13,"Thanks to NisJer05 for picking this one up for me at Cloverleaf in Southfield. This is my first taste of an oatmeal stout and boy I sure wasn't disappointed!!!  Appearance: Dark black in color, with a hint of brown to it. A thin cream colored head, that dissappeared quickly.  Smell: A light chocolate, with a hint of caramel smell. Mostly a toasted malty smell with a hint of oats.  Taste: A toasted malty taste not overpowering though. I love this brew, oatmeal stouts are quickly becoming my favorite. This did have a suttle taste of chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Not heavy at all, i would say a medium feel to it. I did notice a bit of a fizzy feel, but finished clean.  Drinkablity: I could drink a lot of these brews in one sitting. This did not fill me up as fast as other stouts. It has a nice flavor from the combination of oats and malts. It left my taste buds wanting more. I cannot wait to purchase more of this wonderful treat.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,rhoadsrage,4.23,(Served in an imperial pint glass)  A- This beer pours a thick black body with a faint brown tint. The body is to dense to see through but the head is a nice creamy light tan color that last and last.  S- The smell of roasted malt is finished with a slight sour note. The roasted malt has hints of toasted and fresh grain both.  T- The taste of roasted malt is nice balanced by a slight sour note in the finish. The finish is also pretty dry. As the beer warms there is a nice hint of fresh grain with some nutty quality. The hint of earthiness is hidden in the background. As it warms a hint of coffee comes through with the earthiness.  M- The mouthfeel is medium but has a slight fizz that makes it feel medium-full. There is also a silky texture in the mouthfeel. No astringency or alcohol warmth.  D- This beer has a very nice depth to it. The oat flavors come through with layers of dark roasted malt. The slight sour finish really balances the malt in the absence of hops.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Great 1/2'' head, which slowly faded into about 1/8'' and left some really nice lacing.  Smell = Rich hearty toasted malts. Tangy alcohol like flavor reminescent of good whiskey. A good overall scent.  Taste = I'm not a huge fan of stouts, but I can appreciate this and know its a darn good one. Dark, robust flavors of burnt, toasted malt. The right amount of sugar to compliment the more harsh flavors. Leaves a pleasant smoky aftertaste in the mouth.  Overall = Recommended for fans of stouts.

Taste: Acidic, fruity. raisin. Day-old coffee. Sour finish.  Mouthfeel: Way over carbonated. Harsh finish. This is an oatmeal stout. It should be smooth, but it's not.  This beer was tough to get down. Actually, I didnt even finish the bottle. Based on other BA reviews, I'm assuming this was not the freshest of bottles. However, I'm reviewing this beer as is since Samuel Smith makes no attempt to ensure the freshness of their beer (i.e. clear bottles, no born-on/exp date).",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,HugoGrim,4.36,"Poured from a 550 ml bottle into an imperial pint. No freshness date to be found on the bottle. This is a beautiful looking beer. Black as night in body. If you hold it up to a light a dark red light will peek through around the edges. It sported a thick two and a half finger head which remained until the end and left rings the entire way down the glass. Stunning.  The smell was strong and complex for a stout. Scents of malt, coffee, dark chocolate, and cream.  The flavor was that of roasted oats and coffee, with a creamy nutty sweetness hiding just around the corner. Almost like a flavored coffee, in which the body of flavor is bitter and roasted, and the accent is sweet. I enjoyed this stout with my desert of a slice of German style apple cake. The two went so well together it is hard to put it into words.  An excellent feel to this beer, firm and smooth.

113,571,Shovelbum,4.2,"Ah the celebrated Oatmeal Stout from Tadcaster.  Big chunky cocoa head over a black body with ruby edges. A head like this has to leave something behind, and this one leaves pretty decent lace. It's too bad the head itself didn't have a bit more staying power. Aromas of coffee, roasted malt and a touch of alcohol. Aromatic for as stout, but nothing out of style. Roasted malt combine with hints of chocolate flavors. Slightly sweet, a bit of mineral tang and some background bitterness. Full-bodied, but not thick. Low carbonation with a slightly drying finish.  Like a bad American I started drinking this a tad too cold. As it warmed it really mellowed out and came into its own. The flavors were much more balanced and it just slid right down. Ive had this before, but never realized how much I enjoyed it until I decided to review it. Its a substantial brew without being too boozy, syrupy or cloying. An ideal winter session brew.

I liked this one a lot.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,UncleFlip,4.25,"Strong dark tan head, mostly foamy- but with loose bubbles on top. Liquid is a ruby-hued cola.  Smell is yeast and crusty brown wheat bread. There's some spiciness infused throughout, but not the type that screams hops.  The flavour is very roasted, with a coffee undertone and some raisin and chocolate that hits right in the middle, and doesn't let go. Some spiciness creeps in on the end.  The liquid is thinner than expected, with a medium carbonation that strikes on the front of the tongue.  This one goes down easily. Maybe not the best stout around, but not the most assertive, either. Highly recommended as a session beer.  Be well -UF",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,crwills,4.69,"Yum! I love this beer.  Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Deep, dark brown with a big floofy tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves lots of residue.  The smell makes this beer what it is. Heavy scents of caramel, toffee, and cotton candy, accompanied by port or sherry sweet alcoholiness, cherries, sweet grapes, and some nuts (pecans). I don't need to drink this beer, I can just sit there smelling it.  But, drink it I did. Mouthfeel is milky and coating. Taste almost lives up to the smell -- espresso, bitter dark chocolate, burnt malts. This beer has a great bitter punch which quickly fades into a sweet maltiness that lingers. Aftertaste is black coffee that slowly gets more sugary as the beer warms.  I still don't know which Oatmeal Stout I like better - this or the St. Amb's version. But there's always room for lots of both in my cupboard/fridge!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Roasted and bitter coffee like malt with some juicy oat sweetness.  Dark roast malt flavors with just a hint of bitter malt and oaty sweet flavors. Basic stout, but tasty and not overpowering like some stouts I've had. Moderately thick body, but not oily slick.  One of the best stouts I've had.

113,571,PBRstreetgang,4.18,"Pours nearly black with ruby highlights. A huge pale brown head forms, very dense in consistency and superb retention that coats the entire glass with sticky lacing. Very sweet roasted barley aroma, with some molasses notes. Sweet oats and deep roasted flavor is robust but not overwhelming. The lack of any hop profile is compensated by the bitterness from the malts, leaving a balanced flavor that is non-residual, but also not too dry. Light carbonation and a full body lend a smooth and drinkable character that compliment the rich flavor. Burnt malt and overly sweet aftertaste create a flash of soy sauce, which fades quickly but leaves a slightly astringent finish.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Head pretty much all faded and left little to no lacing.  Smell is sweet, but for some reason smells dusty (wtf?). Overall, kind of faint and not that great.  Taste didn't come out until the beer really warmed up. Little bitterness and a little sweet. Its nice but kind of thin overall.  Very easy drinking and feels nice.  I could easily drink a couple of these, however, I wouldn't recommend it for the price. It was smooth but there really wasn't much going on with this beer. Give it to someone that thinks Guinness is too much.

An airy sniff of coffee beans with a hint of chocolate and sweet alcohol maybe even some walnuts way in back. Any way you put it: it smells excellent.  This one is different than a lot of stouts I've had so far. Starts with a deep nutty hop and comes back with sour roasted coffee. Aftertaste carries the nuttiness.

Hints of brown show only when held to the light, and then only around the edges. Thick, frothy head of tight, medium brown/tan bubbles. Sweet, malty aroma. Caramel, slight astringency. The background hints of the local blackstrap molasses.  First sip notes the creaminess the oats bring to the table. Not as sweet as the aroma lead on. Roasted malts lead the way to the slight sweetness of caramel and the hint of the blackstrap comes back at the end. Finishes slightly astringent and burnt. Dry.

Think a few onces of coffee with chocolate syrup added to a shaken bottle of Perrier.

Hops finishes with a subtle back-of-the-throat bitterness creating a slight sourness to finish off the overall sweet profile.  M: Creamy, not very carbonated and finishes a little watery to me.  D: Very drinkable. Clearly not an all nighter, but easy to drain the glass before you realize it.  Overall: If you like oatmeal stouts you really should check this out.

Lots of Southern attitude like Maxwell House and sarsaparilla tea on a white veranda.  I taste it and its like oats and cream poured over bluenose silk. The body is full and it slides over my tongue crisply. Dark roasted coffee notes dominate while subtle English herbs swish around my mouth, rosemary, lavender, and peppercorns. The finish is Portuguese bootleg, strong wine served with sharp cheese and cherries. I dig it and my belly does too.  It feels great. My mouth is tickled pink drinking this.

Theres a nice malt/sorghum nose, though again not quite as complex or pleasing as in Mackesons offering. Flavor is good, slightly bitter with a strong presence of toasted malt. Its a pleasantly liquid beer, going down easily but not as thick or substantial as Id prefer. The finish is pleasingly bitter.

I think it is one of the best stouts around, period.  Extraordinarily drinkable. Previously, I never really considered this to be a session beer, although I liked it well enough. After this most recent tasting, I think I could easily drink this all night.  This is the best Sam Smith's I have ever had, purchased at Harrington's in Chelmsford, MA.

Smells mildly of barley malt, roasted malt, chocolate, and cappuchino. Throw in some mild souring as well. No hop aromas. Flavors are similar to those in the nose, only much more bold, rich, and full. Never gets astringent or grainy. Big body finishes with flavors of plumbs and grapes (not wine). Finishes silky smooth, modestly sweet. The oatmeal rarely shows flavors but adds to the richness and smoothness of the beer. I highly recomend.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Noxious26,4.35,"550ml clear bottle poured in a pint glass.  Absolutely black, opaque in colour. Can't see through it and even the edges don't give up a highlight. Medium brown colour head is tight and low and recedes quickly to a light skim across the top.  Rich, roasted malts in the aroma. Undertones are sweet, dried fruit, a bit of syrup.  Sweet, dried fruit (raisins? figs?) at the start. Subtly and smoothly morphs into a nice caramel/burnt finish. In the occassional sip a mild dark chocolate and/or medium roast coffee undertone pops up. Aftertaste is a little bitter, but with some caramel, chocolate and burnt tones.  Nice and creamy and smooth. Little carbonation. Silky smooth mouthfeel.  This is a beautiful, smooth, subtle, easy going stout. No, it's not going to kick you in the teeth, but that's fine with me. I'm more than happy to be seduced by a beer rather than overpowered by one. Too bad I can't get this stuff here regularly, and too bad I only brought one back from Calgary.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,bubrewer,2.27,"Although Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout is supposed to be one of the classic stouts and a standard of the style, I found this one to be a most unpleasant experience.  The pour looked fine - color and and carbonation all seemed appropriate. Things went ugly from there, though.  The aroma was big -- and sour. Terms like waxy, plasticy, and ""smells like Murphy's Oil Soap"" flew around the table.  Thin body and soapy flavor rounded out this nasty glass.  Fully 3/4 of the people in the party said this stuff is nasty and NOT recommended. 1/4 liked it well enough and would try it again.  All I can figure from this is that this 6pack must have been mistreated, I will try again, from a different retailer, and see if I see things differently next time, but this one was nasty.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Sweet malts; not too hoppy at all and rather bubbly for a stout. Coats the tongue in a bit of a chalky kind of way. I haven't had too many oatmeal stouts that I can think of, but this is pretty good as far as stouts on the whole go.

Roastedness, and a sour/tart/tangyness that I really enjoy. Oats also add to the character of this brew. Mouthfeel is bubbly and chewy.

Its aroma is malty, roasty and is a little burnt. There are also hints of chocolate and oats.  The flavor is a bit sweeter than I like my beers, but not overpowering. This beer is definitely dominated by malt. Oatmeal and roasted flavor are the main characters here. A little bit of coffee and chocolate are also in the mix as well. There is also a slight hop presence in the finish, though it is faint.  The mouth feel is a little oily and leaves a slight film in the mouth. Its carbonation levels are quite low.

Taste begins with a slightly bitter hop profile of mineraly, floral and earthy flavors followed by a complex malt character that is slightly sweet with hints of caramel, molasess, burnt toast, toffee, chocolate, and of course oatmeal.

113,571,BigRedN,4.38,"Appearance: Pours from the 550 ml bottle into my pint glass black. My first Sam Smith's and I have just learned something, the bottle is clear. I never really looked at this beer that close, I had assumed the bottle was tinted, but it was the actual color of the beer! The solid, black, liquid pours out and forms a nice thick tan head, at least 1-inch, that slowly dissipates to a nice covering over the liquid. Thick clinging lace covers the sides of the glass as I consume this wonderful liquid. The beer did look good in the glass, I should have taken a picture.  Smell: Malty (roasted malt), a little grainy, aroma of coffee, a little chocolatey, and some raisin. Scent is very good, and I can still smell it in the glass even after I have finished the beer.  Taste: Marvelous, not too sweet, just nicely balanced with subtle flavors of coffee, chocolate (slightly burnt), and grains. There seems to be a slight bitterness on the finish, which I think helps to keep the beer in balance.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, full bodied, but not syripy (sp?). Actually there seemed to be a slight dryness at the finish.  Drinkability: Low alcohol content makes this an easy drinking beer, even in the summer heat, although I don't think one would want to make a session out of it. Still, very approachable, it's one of those beers where BMC drinker will be intimidated by its ""motor oil"" appearance and leave it alone. Although he will still insist that he's a real man and don't drink that weird beer, as he pounds his Bud Light. Oh well, more of the good stuff for the BA's.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

I had to pause to let the head settle before squeezing the last drop out. the head did not stay long as it fizzled quickly into the atmosphere. the body was so dark you can't see through it, as expected from a stout, but with hints of browness.  some malty sweetness in the flavor, very creamy and did not bite. good creamy oatmeal appeal on the tastebuds with a little bit of carbonation and some aftertaste. drinkability was ok as it took me a lilttle while to finish this beer.  this beer may be much much better on tap, which could be said the same for many other beers, therefore I can't help but add that the oatmeal stout came a long way from England to the land where oatmeal stouts do not rule enough for people clear the shelves in time for fresher batches. however I do recommend this for special occasions, all the while served cold, and I mean COLD. serving it warm can make the stout way too unappealingly sweet.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

I grabbed a bottle of this in favor of my usual choice, Deschute's Obsidian Stout, because I was in the mood for something new.  Poured like your normal quality stout, near black with a somewhat thick tan head. Mouthfeel was a bit too thin for my tastes but it got the job done. Although the taste wasn't too impressive I enjoyed the absence of a strong chocolate flavor, which makes mosts stouts undrinkable with meals. The versatility of this beer is probably its best attribute, you can have it with or without food unlike many other sweeter tasting stouts.

113,571,RedwoodGeorge,4.4,"Brew pours a deep reddish brown - not quite opaque with a thick fluffy tan head. Lots of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass throughout the drink  The smell is subtle but pretty much by-the-book stout: notes of caramel, hints of smoke and a wee bit 'bready'  The taste is quite heavenly - lots of dark roasted taste without any hint of burning or over-toasting. Primarily a caramel or molasses like sweet note with compliments of coffee and chocolate. Barely any hop note there but there is a small bitterness at the end to round out the taste.  Mouthfeel is everything an Oatmeal Stout ought to be - it's like drinking velvet and cream. There's a light amount of carbonation to fuzz up the tongue but the creaminess leaves a slightly oily coating on the tongue.  Very, very drinkable - just what you'd hope for in an Oatmeal Stout.

113,571,futaboots,4.4,"Lately I've been feeling like I should put my reviews up for the beers that defined my early exploration into good beer. Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout is THE beer. The one that slapped me in the face, and made me realize that there was a whole world out there of better beer. Astonishingly, it is still one of my favorite beers of all time, a beer I still get a frequent craving for, a year and a hundred or so new beers later.  So how does it taste? Excellent. There's a very sweet taste here that I still can't pin down, and I don't get a lot from other stouts. Kind of like molasses. Some astringency is there too. When I first started drinking this beer I noticed a metallic taste as well, but I can't detect it anymore, which might be attributed to a different pallette. For some reason I'm having hard time identifying the different flavors in this brew, which might be why I like it so much. Oh sure, the usual stout flavors are there, there's some roasted coffee, some bittersweet chocolate. But this beer tastes like it made it's own rules for how it should taste. I haven't had any other beer that tastes quite like this one. Young's comes closest, but I didn't like it nearly as much.  Appearance and Smell. Not completely black, there are ruby edges, and light can actually penetrate this beer if it is bright enough/viewed at the right angle. Head is modest, receding to a fine lace. Oddly enough, I know I've had some bottles that produced very little if any head, or lacing, although I don't remember the flavor ever suffering much due to this.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Samuel Smith said that this had an IBU of 32, but I couldn't really taste that much bitterness. I liked that it didn't show it, because it might have ruined it. Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied, not much carbonation, and has a slight roasted malt aftertaste. Drinkability: An excellent oatmeal stout that people should try.

Not nearly on the same level, but it has served its purpose well for the night.  Appearance is jet black is no light passage and a perfect tan head. The head sticks around for quite a long time, but does not lace well.  Smells like chocolate malt and coffee. Only a hint of roast.  Tastes very sweet, which recedes to a bit of a bitterness from the roastiness and hop bite in the aftertaste. The beer is fairly light bodied but with a creamy mouthfeel. Swishing throughout the mouth provides an awesome sweet malty flavor. Drinkability is good for this stout. Another one I'll probably drink again from Sam Smith.

M: Even though this looked flat, it was carbonated quite nicely. Very full in body. Low alcoholic warmth.

There is a very unique smell to this brew, something of a smoked meat characteristic, real pleasant. I know a meat smell isn't a good descriptor but that's what I sense. There's some coffee-like aromas as well. There is also a leafy hop character.  I get a distinct hop flavor at the start. A fruity grape-like sensation is in there, along with some earthy flavors, and then the sweet malts kick in. Hints of coffee, chocolate, and of course, oatmeal round this one out.

Great complexity as it warms and reveals even more of its olfactive charm with hints of black licorice and anise. This is one occasion I wish I had my wife's pregnant olfactory senses... that's like smelling in 3D!  This is a full bodied brew with a rich and creamy texture that coats the insides of the mouth fully. The flavours are really exceptional and beautifully harmonized. Just the right amounts of malty sweetness, fruitiness (cherries, and currants...) pave the way for roasted notes and hints of caramelization and dark chocolate in the middle. Late emanations of peat and smoke round out the experience judiciously and a gentle hoppy bitterness punctuates the peat and smoke perfectly. As the beer warms, the finish also reveals a faint residual sweetness that accompanies the hops to the bitter end.

Very soft flavor redolent of dried fruits and nuts with a long roasty finish- essentially it tastes the way that the aroma promises it will. There is just as much bitterness as is required to keep things grounded, and not a touch more. It starts to feel a bit thin by the end of a glass, but that is a minor complaint.

The brown head lasts and lasts til the beer is gone, all the way down my friends. Smell is totally sweet and creamy, which carries over to the taste. In addition to the milky sweet cream taste there's a nice roasted malt and cocoa taste, and a low bitterness profile. Whereas their imperial stout has that burnt bitter flavor, this one is all about the soft buttery taste. Mouthfeel is nice and I would even say thin for a stout, but that's the way I like my stouts, not chewy. That's not to say that this beer isn't hefty though. Sure is.

It had a one finger deep head(after an aggressive pour) that was creamy and tan coloured.  Smell is not so strong as some other stouts. A bit of roasted malt, something faintly soapy and a dark fruit aroma, none of which are very prevelant.  A bitter coffee flavour takes the lead in the taste category, with a faint sourness. The finish is fairly dry and bitter. It is a good flavour for the style, not my favourite, but nice.  Mouthfeel is bordering on chewy. Carbonation is what you'd expect for a stout, but leaving it on your tongue is not comfortable for long.  The beer goes down fairly well.

Dark roasty, matly aroma with some cereal grain quality to it. No discernable hop aroma other than a mild earthiness. Mostly roasty and sweet, with some caramel, coffee, treacle and chocolate-like undertones. Torrefied oat is a garnish amongst the malt. The sweetness is maltose, almost bordering lactose.

Tastes sweet with the primary flavors being a toffee and dark chocolate with a hint of coffee. Feels a bit smooth in the mouth, probably due to the oatmeal and moderately low carbonation. Very drinkable beer, especially at 5% abv. Overall this is one of the classics, a great beer that will stand the test of time no doubt. Notes: I flipped a coin to determine which stout I would drink and which would be used as a marinade.

113,571,beveragecaptain,4.53,"550 ml bottle. This beer pours out very nearly black with a tan head. Rich, malty aroma. Slightly sweet malty flavor with some roastiness. This beer has an amazingly smooth mouthfeel, which I assume is from the oats. This is an incredible beer that I am especially partial to, as it is one of my first introductions to quality beer. I would recommend it as a good stout for the inexperienced stout drinker. Of course it's a great choice for the experienced drinker too.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,beertastegood,3.82,"Out of the bottle...  Appearance: Pitch black with tan head that lingered.  Smell: Outstanding...coffee/toffee overtones with a rich malt nose.  Taste: Immediate bitter coffee taste with a dry aftertaste. This is a little harsh. Not as smooth as some of the other oatmeals, such as Young's or McNeill's. It is, however, very unique and unquestionably an oatmeal stout.  Mouthfeel: It's got a bite to it. Pretty ""chewy"".  Drinkability: In a word, no.  Not too bad of a brew. I think there are better oatmeal stouts out there.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,SaunaKing,4.13,"Wow - a beautiful looking beer. Pitch black witgh a nice tan leather head. Not much lacing but an attractive looking pint. Smell is a mild chocolate. Nice for a stout - not a very strong aroma but pleasant. The taste leaves a little to be desired, especially after the perfect pour and great aroma. Its very smooth but has a carbonated soda taste upfront whith a little coffee in the finish. The mouthfeel is watery and light. A very drinkable beer, these are made to be put back with abandon.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,EPseja,3.33,"Had this in a four Oatmeal Stout taste-off between Samuel Smith's, Troeg's, Wolaver's, and Barney Flats.  Appearance: 1.5"" generous head - tight retention. Medium sized bubbles all the way up, with tiny ones on top. Color is a very light tan/sand. Dark dark crimson when held up to light.  Smell: Very sweet, almost cola-like smell - reminiscent of a supersweet chocolate. Not really smoky. Cherry or chocolate twizzlers.  Taste: Full bodied, but cloyingly sweet for the style. Chocolate and candied malts. Bananas foster. Aftertaste reveals some roasted coffee roundness.  Mouthfeel: Medium - not smooth, not silky. Average.  Drinkability: Due to its over sweetness, this beer is only a one-pinter.  A good oatmeal stout, but I was expecting more from such a highly rated beer. I would rather spend the money on the Troeg's or Barney Flats!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,DrJay,4.75,"Appearance: Very dark, nearly black, and completely opaque. Not even a hint of highlights at the edge of the glass. This was topped by a dense, creamy, light brown head that showed good retention and stickage.  Smell: Rich aroma with some sharpness from the hops and a bit of earthiness. Maltiness consisted of roasted, caramel, and mild chocolate.  Taste: The malty aromas are echoed in the flavour, but with a little less roasted (although dryness from the roasted barley is present) and a little bit of fruit. Bitterness is just enough to balance the malt and the hop character is on the earthy side. Overall, it starts crisp followed by chocolatey, malty sweetness and finishes with more bitterness and some nuttiness. Great!  Mouthfeel: Full creamy body, aided (I assume) by the oats without making it overly heavy or slick. The low carbonation is just about perfect -- tiny bubbles form in the beer during a sip and add to the velvety texture.  Drinkability: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and would certainly have another if given the opportunity. I could drink this all night. I'll definitely be looking for it again.  550 mL clear glass bottle. No freshness date.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,bearrunner44,4.7,"Pours a deep, dark brown with a two-finger tan head. Very nice. The beer's aroma has the usual coffee and chocolate notes found in most stouts, but there's a also fairly major fruity presense that pulls it all together. Normally I'm not a fan of fruit flavors in beer, but I like it here. It's not overpowering, and it's a nice compliment to the slightly sweet character of the oats and the chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is very thick, just as an oatmeal stout should be. The finish could've used a little more bitterness, but it's not that bad. All things considered, this is a great beer. It's much more understated than Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout, and I like it better that way.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Frozensoul327,4.28,"Pours out to a dark brown / dark burgandy color. Dense brown foamy head was long lived, as was the sweet floral like aroma mixed with dark chocolate. Taste was smooth and rich, with complex flavors of coffee, oats and chocolate. Slightly sweet aftertaste hang around for a bit longer than I would like, but none the less, it was enjoyable. A reasonably priced beer for those looking for a heavier brew. This is probably the definitive Oatmeal Stout that is widely available today. Recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,chunkylover53,4.03,"This is a very tasty beverage.  It pours black with slight reddish highlights. One can small Figs, dark fruits and smoke.

113,571,beerceller99,4.37,50 cl. bottle pours a black fluid with a decent brown head. Has a malted chocolate and coffee smell. Medium bodied with a nice smooth mouthfeel. Taste is of dark roasted malts and sweet grain oatmeal. Very drinkable and tasty. One of the best Stouts around before the Craft brew revolution and still good in this day and age.

113,571,malty,4.55,"Served from a 12 oz. longneck claer galss bottle with gold foil around cap and neck. No freshness date.  Pours opaque brown-black with a beautiful beige head that starts fluffy and disipates slowly, but quickly rebuilds with a few swirls of the tasting glass.  Scent is wonderful - like fresh chocolate brownies right out of the oven. Notes of dark fruit covered in milk chocolate - mmmm.  The taste strongly reflects the scent - milk chocolate with a gentle roasted malts. That tell-tale Samuel Smith 'twang' (or 'stoney') flavor is apparent in this offering, but a bit attenuated compared to the Imperial Stout. Beautifully balanced and full flavored with the oat malt adding a good measure of sweetness. Nice juicy, semi-dry finish.  The body is Med-Full and is very delicate. Super silky & smooth, one of the finest mouthfeels of any bottled stout I've tried - very airy with super fine subdued carbonation.  Drinkability is up there mainly due to it's softness and smoothness, along with an avg. ABV.  What a delightful stout! A world classic. Very English tasting indeed. One word...Masterful.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,santoslhalper,3.94,"Appearence: Pours a deep burgundy with a nice, tan head. Head leaves decent lacing and has good retention.  Smell: The smell is mainly chocolate and roasted nuts. The oats are very pleasent smelling, and not too strong.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The taste is a strong but smooth nutty flavor. The chocolate and coffee notes burst through at the end, balancing it all out very nicely. The flavors that are there, though not very complex, are of a high quality. The mouthfeel is slick and slimey.  Drinkability and Overall: This is the classic Oatmeal Stout. While far from the best, this is an easily enjoyed beer, most suitable for a spring evening. The flavor seems like it would go with dessert well. This is a must try on your ""road to beer advocacy.""",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,beersarang,4.55,"Appearance is gorgeous. This beer is very dark and lets little light through. The tan head is creamy and leaves some lace on the glass.  Smells wonderful. The nose contains chocolate notes, with hints of coffee and possible a toffee like buttery smell.  Tastes exceptionally good. Rather malty, with the oatmeal and malts coming on strong and a very light alcohol character. The hops come in at the end but are only there to balance. For the style the hop bitterness is just right.  The true joy of this beer may be in the mouthfeel. This beer was so smooth and just thick enough. It was a pleasure to drink. The carbonation is not so high, but this beer is certainly not flat.  Quite drinkable, given the good flavor and the creamy moutfeel. I loved it.  Samuel Smith makes consistently good beers and I now believe that they are the best in England.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BDTyre,4.42,On par with Mcauslan's St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout. Pours a pitch black with a thin tan head.

113,571,Biggness,4.36,"This beer is made with the finest ingridients and has the taste to prove it. This may be the smoothest beer I have ever tasted. Samuel Smiths beers are very pricey but it is not hard to figure out why after you have tasted it!

Smells great--chocolate, caramel, coffee, roastiness. Tastes better than any oatmeal than I've ever had. Exceptional. It has one of the best mouthfeels, too--nice and thick. So drinkable.

113,571,Crotor,4.32,"Pours *almost* black, with one finger of light tan, slightly dimpled head. Decent retention, no lacing.  Diacetyl apparent in the aroma, plus slight acrid roastiness, and some heavily carmelized toffee-sweetness.  As always with Sam Smith's brews, the diacetyl plays a big part in this beer - and I wouldn't have it any other way. A bit roasty and toffee sweet, this is like mild coffee with heaps of buttery brown sugar. There are definite layers to this flavor. The major components are a slightly acrid, roasty bitterness, offset by the buttery, diacetyl/molassas sweetness. A very nice war do they wage on your tongue. Also a bit earthy, and perhaps the slightest touch of candied fruit. Maybe it's the Yorkshire yeast, maybe it's the diacetyl, but there's always something about Sam Smith's beers that makes me think they'd pair nicely with venison.  Overall, I'm *very* pleasantly surprised with this beer. I don't think I'd had it since I was a wee beer novice, and now I'm cursing myself for waiting so long to try it again. I will definately be going back to this very soon.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Taste was more of the same, very good. It would have been a shame if this style had disappeared like it almost did. It has a very decadent creamy mouthfeel, similar to the Imperial Stout, but not as over-whelming.

The color it pours is black comprised of red, looking though at the right angle shows the beers color of ruby so dark it becomes black. It makes sense as the stout is just a built up amber and this beer is a near perfect in color in my eye. The nose is a little lacking as the malt seems subdued, but there is a presences of earth roastedness and chocolate oats that escape. This has a great feel in the mouth of silky oat protiens that carry a roast bitterness that is delightful, still this beer has a metalic aftertaste that I couldn't seem to shake.

The smell is of chocolate malt, sweet oatmeal and brown sugar with a hint of alcohol and is pronounced but not overwhelming.  The taste is robust, mixing what seems like dark chocolate and maple syrup and finishing slightly nutty with a definite toasted-oat background.  Has a slightly lighter body than expected, but the pronounced flavor and virtual absense of bitterness makes up for the slight lack of creamyness. Goes down smooth as silk with a nice carbonation.

113,571,ngandhi,4.28,"When cold, this Sam Smith Oatmeal is strikingly similar to a wonderful ESB with bright, fruity yeast, a crockful of buttery diacetyl, and latent hoppiness. As it warms, these characteristics never really go away, but create a backdrop for wonderfully deep, plummy/pruny malt with golden raisins on the nose and a very dry finish.  Relax, relax. ng ---- July 22, 2003  I could drink a case of this stuff.  For real stoutheads, this might not be the best. It is suprisingly light-bodied and, obviously, made from oatmeal instead of barley. Nonetheless, this is the easiest drinking stout I've ever had. The thick head on the pour, along with the peaking lace that slowly bubbles down the glass, offer a remarkable balance to the stout.  The focus is obviously on the malts and they don't go to ridiculous ends like virtually burning all the grain to show you that. It's mellow and especially delicious served warm (as all stouts should be). A light sweetness gives way to smooth caramel, perhaps a little nuttiness. Guiness Draught drinkers should especially adore the Sammy Smith. If you're more of a Bell's Kalamazoo Stout kind of person, this might be a waste of your time.  A staple beer.

Following a nice smooth and sweet oat flavor along with a slight molasses take hold which adds a complex sweetness to this brew.

Excellent Oatmeal stout that I would recommend to anyone.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Hibernator,4.33,"I had this out of a 12 oz clear bottle and served it in a pint glass. Classic Samuel Smith gold foil on the top of the bottle and cap area. The label reads that this stout is ""The Celebrated "".  The appearance is a dark and wholesome black. Nice head with perfect lacings evenly across the pint glass.  Captivating aromas of sweetness, espresso and molasses are evident.  Taste is very sweet and smooth. Minimal carbination makes this so easy to consume. Very deep flavors and a drinkability that is hard to compare as far as stouts. Just the right amount of bitterness underneath the sweet flavors.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,cypressbob,4.12,"550ml clear bottle, 'victorian pint'  Pours with a dark dark brown body, little light penetration, good foaming head, tan in hue  Smell, coffee aromas, thick malty sweetness  Taste, sweet, milky body, slight coffee bitterness also coming though  A good example of the style, mabye a little sweet but that is the style, full of flavour",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,niknar,4.18,"Pours out a nice, dark brown... bordering on black. A milk-chocolate colored head rapidly appeared (fairly aggressive pour) and built to a very thick, fluffy mass. It slowly settled to a nice collar with some excellent lacing. This head survived several swirls. The aroma is good. Smelled something of oats, chocolate malt, and faint hops. Very pleasant, but not overwhelming. Taste was very rich with a complex development of oats, chocolate malt, and other darkly roasted malt flavors. Starts sweet, then finishes with a touch of hop bitterness for balance. Excellent! Mouthfeel was every so slightly thinner than I expected, though it did not seriously hurt the beer. Slightly higher than expected carbonation, but again, not so much as to be terribly distracting. This is truly an excellent stout to be enjoyed whenever the mood strikes! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,hobbes2112,4.35,"12 oz. bottle (from a mixed four pack)  This one looks a whole lot like the Taddy Porter, maybe a little more brown than red when held to the light. Nice and dark, with a large tan head. This one has lots of lace too.  Smell is chocolate malt, dark fruit, nuts and caramelized sugar.  Taste is smooth and clean. Malt, dark fruits, a little bit of a coffee acidity.  Body is much lighter than a expected, in a good way. The carbonation is low to medium-low and just rolls on the tounge.  I could drink this all the time, good stuff.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,tjd25,4.67,"The head is lasting and thick, brownish, silky and very smooth with fine dense bubbles. The body is of a totally opaque black color, in which I could see myself perfectly as I was trying to evaluate the color of the beer.  The smell is very enjoyable but brighter than for the taddy porter: some coffee and some caramel; some dark fruits, maybe raisins and figs, and hints of yeast. The brighter aspect of the malts may come from the oatmeal, I don't know.  I had a hard time identifying specifically the oatmeal in the taste. The taste shows toasted malt notes, a coffee-like character, and a distinct fruity character. I had a light strawberry impression at one point, and the brew was definitely fruitier and sweeter than I initially thought. A great dark chocolate or trufle feeling comes in the finish.  The mouthfeel shows an incredible smoothness; this beer is so enjoyably creamy. But at the same time it remains greatly light and drinkable, with a very pleasing level of carbonation. The finish is sweeter and more ""aired"" than I expected, the beer's almost breathing in my mouth. Great.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,bignick,4.23,"This is a very good stout. Its color is a dark brown, with a brownish white head. The head is deliciously frothy when I take my first sip, and it remains for the whole pint. This defining characteristic of the taste is toastiness. There are hints of chocolate and slight hints of coffee, as no flavor dominates. This is a smooth and well-balanced stout that I could drink several of in one sitting.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,MrNuggets,3.31,"Head is giant and creamy. Very full earthy aroma, can't help but noticed something off. Is it alcohol I smell? Taste is a fine mix of rolled oats and unsweetened chocolate. Nuttiness moves into a bitter sweet after taste that is unrewarding.

113,571,ALESwhatCURESya,4.53,This was the first drink I had on the night of our wedding reception. This was just what I needed to start out the fabulous night. Beautiful mollasses black color with super fluffy head that lasted forever. The taste was rich in toasted nut and chocolate and finished very crisp! This is a fantastic and very smooth tasting oatmeal stout. Two Thumbs Up!!,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,koolk,4.27,"Deep black with a crimson hue that makes that sort of cola colour. Head dies quickly - very low carbonation.  Wonderful aromas that is very much a mix of licorice/anise, confectionary, sweet maple and many other tasty smell. Almost smells so sweet it has black cola cordial notes. Intresting stuff. Changes every minute as it warms.  Same flavours on the palate, with cola, licorice, and malt flavours dominating. Good sweetness on the middle palate (almost blackberry/plummy confectionary like) that is well balanced by back palate hoppiness.  Would get a higher score if the palate didn't mimic the nose so badly. More roast and malt flavours would be good. Otherwise, a really enjoyable stout!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Gavage,4.35,"Black in color with a thick fluffy tan head that sported some large bubbles. There was some lacing through the drink. The aroma is of roasted malt, with earthy and sweet tones. The taste is wonderful as roasted malt and chocolate cause a nice sweetness, but is balanced with some light coffee and very light oats. Very minor bitterness is detected.  The body is medium-heavy with nice carbonation. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy at the start and finishes creamy and dry. The roasted malt and sweetness lasts shortly on the tongue.A great drinking brew.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,jimdkc,4.48,"Dark brown nearly opaque color with a small tan head. Smell is of roasted malts, brown sugar, with a little of coffee and chocolate notes. Taste is slightly sweet and malty with dark roast (maybe a bit smoky) flavors. Again, notes of coffee and chocolate, but they are not dominant. Some alcohol warming detected, even though this is only a 5% ABV beer. Flavors are smoother and more pronounced when letting the beer warm a little. A little hop bitterness provides balance. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, although a bit thinner than expected from an oatmeal stout, but it still manages to leave a thin coating on the glass and in your mouth. I think one of these makes a great dessert (someone else suggested with vanilla ice cream... I'll have to try that!) This is a wonderful stout! One of my favorites!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,mobyfann,4.38,"Paid $11.79 for a 3pk. (550mL) gift set with pint glass and two coasters...  The appearence of this is quite remarkable. The base is of a deep brown color but the head is what this beer is about. The head appears a little chunky, mid-to-large sized of an oatmeal color with excellent lacing throughout the drink. The smell is kinda like a mocha candy bar but roasted, no real hints of oatmeal.  The taste is out of this world; so much going on let's see what we've got here: Dark roast coffee, chocolate, caramel, slight grain, extremely smooth in the mouth. The drinkability is extremely high. I drank this one in about 10-15 minutes for 550mL of beer and loved it every margainally sized sip of the way.

113,571,Gueuzedude,3.85,"An opaque dark brown color, just about black. It is topped by a frothy, creamy brown head. Thick malty aromas mixed with burnt toast, expresso, toffee, and chocolate are all found in the nose. The taste is sweet, creamy, chocolately, and slightly viscous. I get notes of milk chocolate, and espresso. There is a bitter component that is derived from the roasted malt, but it is not enough to balance the sweetness that is found in this beer. For some reason I was expecting a bit more out of this beer. It is quite decent but seems a little dumbed down, which makes sense given this beer wide availibility & popularity.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Andreji,4,"This brew quite surprised me as a very poor fan of stouts. Purchased at Drinks of the World in Luzern (CH).  the pour, although very dark and heavy varies from your average stout at the head. instead of the creamy, white head you get a fizzy, coffee toned volatile one which emanates scents of coffee, naturally, and malt, as well as some bitterness to it. The taste was rather impressive because, beyond the feel of coffee in it, this beer reminded me, strangely, to the german Rauchbiers, as the mouthfeel and taste were strongly smoked, with some meaty taste to it- pleasant, certainly, but unexpected.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,henrysunset,4.21,"dark as night, very opaque, with a small light tan head of light bubbles. Smell is primarily a hoppy bitterness, but the chocolate malts are quite apparent too.  Taste is incredible; dry with exceptional chocolate malt flavor. Hops are extremely well balanced with the darker chocolate malt flavors. Subtle citrus tone but without the annoying sweetness. Bitterness becomes more apparent with additional sips, but is very pleasent.  Mouthfeel is also very good; pretty thick with a pleasent level of very subtle carbonation.  Very good beer, only major obstacle to drinkability is cost.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,beertaster13,4.47,"This beer poured a very dark mocha black, with a tan beigh mocha head that was a froth of a monster. Very thick and creamy. Smell was very roasted and smoked, not very oatmeal/grain at all to speak of, picked up a little wood and bark smell? Taste was of dark fresh roasted coffee with chocolate fudge, the sweet fullbodied creaminess was a perfect blen with the subtleness of the hops. Full bodied and creamy in the mouth, flavorfully smooth, I would drink this any chance I get.

113,571,Hunter,4.43,"Here we go...yet another beer with quite a reputation. I've had this one before, but this my first review of it.  Bottle is clear glass, typical of Samuel Smith's. Always makes me cringe a bit, living in AZ like I do and worrying about sunlight degrading the product.  Stout pours a dark, dark purple-red...not the black you'd expect. Lovely all the same. I held the pint up to the light several times to admire it. Thick tan head rolls out of the pour. Some lacing.  Notes of smoke, coffee, and bittersweet chocolate in the nose. A bit of roasted malt behind it all.  The taste is much mellower than I remembered. This doesn't bother to hide its alcohol the way Guinness draft might. I'm not sure if I hadn't eaten beforehand but I felt warm halfway through the pint.  Flavors of coffee and that dark chocolate intermingle on the tongue, with a smooth mouthfeel that wasn't as chewy as I'd have thought given the brew's name. I gave a good portion of the pint time to warm to room temperature. Glad I did, as it becomes velvety in the warming, less acrid and biting. Has the archetypal smoky aftertaste that seems standard for the style.  A lovely offering. God Bless England!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,PudTinkler,4.42,"Yum.  And readily available too...anytime I see this brewer's selections on a menu, this particular flavor is always in the mix.  Nice color, very little aroma, however. I would've expected it to be a bit thicker, but the typical Sam Smith smoothness is there.  This stout produces a fairly good head with a nice tan-brown color...would live to try it by draught but the bottle is nothing to sneeze at!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,PopeJonPaul,3.76,"Near-black color with a super-thick caramel-colored root beer float-size head. Not much of an aroma but a good strong roasted oatmeal flavor with a creamy chocolate malty base. A bit chewy and creamy at the same time, a surprisingly high level of carbonation. Good mouthfeel with a slight caramel finish. This would go well with a fine cigar. Not the top of the oatmeal stout chain but one of the better ones you might be able to find in your neighborhood.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Gagnonsux,4.08,"Re-Review 03/22/05  I thought I'd re-review this beer since my tastes have improved over the last year or so. The appearance is excellent, the color is about one shade less than black and the head is tan and creamy. Plus the head leaves a nice layer of cream once it has dissapated. The aroma isn't very strong, but has a nice subtle sweet smell with a dark chocolate undertone. The taste is very full-flavored. A sip starts with dark chocolate sweetness which rounds to a more general roasted sweetness. Sip concludes with sweet roasted coffee taste. I have definently come to appreciate and love this beer since my initial sample. I still find it a little bit too filling, but it isn't as much of an issue to me this time around.     Original Review 5/16/04  Ah, my first stout, I'm still trying to figure out exactly what I think about it. First off, this is some seriously dark beer, its almost pitch black. The aroma is nice, a little sweet, but not overpowering. SInce this is my first stout, I don't have much to compare to, but I do enjoy the taste. This beer starts off really smooth in my mouth and leaves a nice, mildly sweet aftertaste. Overall, I can definently tell that this is a good brew, but I'm still not sure if stout is a style that I really like. I'll probably have to try this again with some food to see what happens. I can definently tell this isn't something I'd want to drink a whole lot of in one sitting.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,katdaddy210,4.7,"So great, so dark. This beer doesn't speak of evil though. So much flavor, I'm at a loss. A beer to try, you must. You will not be disapointed with the flavor, if you love a black beer. It has so much more character than a stout of any kind, yet lets you feel like you already ate breakfast. This beer is worth the investment. A great cold weather friend. This is an amazing beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,brewdlyhooked13,4.7,"Appearance - very deep ruby red, practically black. Light brown head like chocolate milk. Thick drapy lacing.  Aroma - smoky coffee, baked biscuits, molasses and brown sugar. It's all there. Fantastic.  Taste - sweet malts, espresso with double sugar, charcoal and some light smokiness. Finishes sweet, toasty, fresh brewed coffee aftertaste. Solid and developed flavor profile in every aspect, superb balance. Probably not as great for those who aren't into sweet beers.  Mouthfeel - thinner than I would have thought, but very smooth with light carbonation.  Drinkability - super stuff, low abv, I could drink it again and again and again!!!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,WetCoaster,3.95,"Appearance: Initially jet black; daylight reveals a cola-like deep mahogany. Finger of dense, rocky tan foam. Thick, sticky lacing.  Smell: Smoky, with caramel and burnt sugar malt notes.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Starts with a blast of sweet malt; morphs into a pleasant bittersweet chocolate cake flavor before finishing dry and bitter with a hint of smoke. Body is surprisingly light and somewhat milky, but the fine carbonation is fairly sharp.  Drinkability: Quite, it's sweet and sort of... comforting, in a way--it's a very ""nice"" beer.  This is a tasty, harmless stout, but its light body and somewhat mild flavor make me wonder what all the fuss is about. I like it, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't make much of a statement, really.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,FormatKid,4.08,"I picked up a single of this from Riverside Beverages in Chattanooga. Ive noticed this beer is very appreciated on this site so I am looking forward to trying it. Im worried about the beer being light struck since its in a clear bottle, but Ill just cross my fingers and go.  This beer pours out jet black to the naked eye with an ample creamy head at least three fingers high. When held up to light dark ruby tinges become apparent.  Unfortunately there is a hint of skunk in the aroma but it is not too noticeable. The nose is deep with charred, sweet malts and a sparkle of earthy bitterness about the edges.  This tastes different than any stout Ive tried so far, but its hard to put my finger on it. I think the oats come across as a smooth, cured, nuttiness almost. Lightly charred malts are evident and a taste like coffee with a healthy dosing of sugar. An earthenly bitter, dry aftertaste is left in my mouth, pretty good stuff. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is light but pleasing.  Overall a very solid stout, and one I would definitely enjoy to revisit.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,dippy,4.3,"I feel like I rated this brew too high, but it is a great brew.  Pours a nice black brew but looks dark brown on the edges, A light tan head.  Earthy tones mellow out the dark roast, also smell a touch of sweetness in the background.  A smooth brew to drink that is for sure, a nice melding of flavors, nothing is fighting to be out in front. The dark roasted malt as I said before is subdued by an oaty, earth taste. Like a medium roast coffee with a touch of sugar to take the edge off.  A good session beer, I could drink this all night, not heavy at all just a little more than medium bodied.  I think this is a good beer to to turn people on to stouts.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Rastacouere,3.95,"Very dark brown body with a thin beige head. Just like the mcneills oatmeal stout, you can grab the oatmeal just by smelling. Deep malt profile full of chocolate, licorice, brown sugar sweetness and something powdery alike flour. There's no mistake on the tongue, this is a sweet stout, with caramelic peaks, tons of oatmeal, some powder sugar perhaps and nevertheless a great balance due to subdued english hops. Silky medium body, highly quaffable, definitely the most obvious definition of the style I've faced. On the other hand, it never comes close to approaching the imperial stout in terms of complexity.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,psyco1,3.86,"It poured a small tan head that stayed for about a minute. At first glance it's black as night, but holding it up to the sun it showed a dark ruby through the bottom corner.  A burnt and sour smell came through more than anything.  It tastes more like a porter than a stout to me with the slight sourness coming through, which is good, since I like porters more.:) A little chocolate , coffee, burnt flavor, alcohol and a bit of sour came together to make a nice combonation.  I could drink quite a few of these if I could find them. I think it'd go well with a roast.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,IceAce,4.87,"Appearance: An agressive pour from clear glass bottle to beer-clean Imperial pint glass rsulted in two and 1/2 fingers of light tan foam. As the collar of foam began to reduce, an elegant pattern of lace was left behing. The beer below the foam is midnight black.  Aroma: A very heady and earthy nose...full of promises of deep, rich roasted barley. To say the nose is inviting is like telling someone in the path of a tidal wave 'to expect miosture'.  Taste: OK, I admit it. While I evaluated the aroma, I actually lost control an took a sip. I couldn't help it...and I deeply apologize. How to describe the taste? How about this. ""There just aren't enough o's in smoooth to give this fantastic brew its fair due"". Malty richness fills the palate as the tongue begins to dance. Simply superb.

113,571,soper2000,4,"Poured a pitch black with small tan head. Aroma was a little bit faint but notes of malt and chocolate were notable. The taste is huge on roasted malts. A smokey chocolate character is present, but this is a pretty well balanced beer. No flavors were too strong or really propelled me to ponder this brew any further. I can see this as a nice session brew. It's a nice staple to have close by at all times and it's available in all types of places.

Pours a chocolate-brown to black that is unlike any other color I have seen in a stout- with a medium tan-off-white head that is beautiful to behold. My first 5.0 for appearance.  Aroma was not strong (I had the wrong kind of glass), but it was chocolatly (bitter European dark chocolate, not wimpy American milk chocolate) and my friend correctly noted ""smoky"". In fact, smoky look, smoky aroma, smokey flavor. Wonderful. Other flavors included almost a meaty quality, although there was some sweetness and chocolate.

It pours with a fine head that lingers along the galss long after it has gone down. The taste is remarkable. Initially, it is a strong roasted malt flavor. Later there is a slight cream flavor as well as earthy flavor. There is a pleasant lingering aftertaste of roasted malts and coffee. Very feint earthy taste. There was no freshness date, it came in a pint size bottle and then was poured into a glass.

A stubborn lace clings to the glass.  The beer has what I would describe as an aged chocolate taste. The malt flavor is not so much thick as it is bold. The aftertaste makes me think of walking around old basement. It's a nice taste because it reminds me of working on the farm as a kid.  I'm not usually fond of stouts, but I definitely would make an exception for another one of these.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Giant liquid-cookie head that bubbles up, comes back to earth and really lingers.  Nothing but sweetness on the nose. I can only slightly tune into the roasted malts. No hop presence at all, but none expected. A few shards of oats, or maybe i'm persuaded by the bottle color.  Could this be one of the sweetest beers ever? Not a stout to my tastebuds, closer to Young's Double Chocolate than their interpretation.  Thick mouthfeel but tongue cannot ignore the cloying sweetness.  Good starter beer for macro-freaks, but otherwise avoidable except for dessert settings.

113,571,Trentonator,4.24,"When I was a young associate attorney at a big downtown law firm, I loved Starbuck's coffee. When you are expected to bill 2500 hours a year, a good caffeine jolt in the early morning is great. I realize now that I am older (and hopefully wiser), that my Starbuck's obsession was not so much because of the great flavor of the coffee, but that the buzz from said coffee was so intense that it made it seem better than it actually was. Add to that the fact that those coffees were 6 bucks a pop, and it really puts into perspective what a bunch of hype and elevated expectations can do for a drink. So goes the SS Oatmeal Stout. The head on this beer is nominal. The taste is OK, the smell is phenomenal. Overall, this beer is good, but not great. It will give you a good buzz, and tastes delicious. The aroma is fantastic, and the color is darker than Darth Vader. I still think that it's high listing is a self-fulfilling prophecy, though.

Has a excellent fluffy tan head that stayed around for a long time and broke down to chunky lacing through out the entire brew.  The aromas coming from this brew are dark maybe smoked malts, bit of coffee wrapped around a sweet smell of molasses. A very nice smell to this beer.  The beer makes a statement with the roasted malt, as it is the dominant flavor to this brew. Can notice flavors of coffee and chocolate as well with a bit of a hop. Over all a real nice tasting brew.  This is a beer that eats like a meal; wow this is a filling brew. Over all for me it is a classic and another fantastic offering from Samuel Smiths.

It's not syrupy, but there is a roasted taste with caramel notes and a definite dry roasted aftertaste with the lingering sweetness following at the very end. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but still good.

113,571,Billolick,4.37,"Large clear bottle, pours black with a manly dark tan head, ecxellent head retention and nice foamy lacing. Sweet roasted malt in the nose. Smooth malt, toasted malt and burnt malt. Chocolate, cafe au lait and cocoa notes. Some chalky hops in the finish. Smooth, silky, coating mouthfeel. This one is wonderful to savor and enjoy. I enjoyed some spicy BBQ chicken and a piece or two of chocolate with this one. A fine brew, go out and get some.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,necoadam,4.58,"Poured out ink black with some decent amount of head on this beer. Gotta be careful with those gold wrappings around the cap, a little piece fell into my beer. Smell consisted of some sweet malts, chocolate, coffee, and some creaminess of some sorts. Taste is very good. So silky smooth and creamy. Almost like buttery chocolate in your mouth. It's so good. This beer barely had a chance to get to room temperature, it was gone before I knew it. It's true what the others say, this is an amazing beer. Always keep a 4 pack of this beer in your fridge/cellar. One of the best beers out there.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Stubbie1,4.38,This stout pouts as black as night. There is a thick large bubble foam head. The head last for aroma time and dwindles down to nothing. The aroma is a sweet and sticky. Hints of coffee and molasses are present along with roasted malts. The taste is smooth and a bit creamy leaving a smooth feeling across the pallet. The sweetness of the molasses comes across with a nice roasted malt flavor and a sweet finish. One fine brew. Cant understand why I waited so long to try this one.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Cwrw,4.35,"Ahh, the charm of Yorkshire, England. Not only is it a beautiful, misty, mysterious, moor-laden land, it has fascinating mediaeval history; and, of course, the Tadcaster Old Brewery. I cannot help but love this brewery, and this particular product they produce. Pouring with a very large, creamy, dimpled head, it quickly falls to an ample brown/red blanket on this black, or dark dark brown stout beer. The lace is patchy and viscous, large bubbled AND small bubbled. Even on a machine-washed pint glass, the lacing is extraordinary. The appearance, for a stout, is almost perfect. There are a myriad of aromas: coffee beans, syrup, molasses, raisins, oatmeal(of course), dark roasted malt, chocolate, and many others. The hops are not in the background either: they add a very distinct grassiness to the smell. The taste is ambrosial, delivering fully on the aroma. I taste malt, coffee, chocolate, and dark fruits, such as raisins or plums, with a very slight sour/tart finish, almost like yogurt or milk of some sort. It is creamy, grainy, and full on the palate. Sublimely flavourful and rich, but exceptionally drinkable--the richness and fullness is not overwhelming, but appetising. This is such a wholesome drink, I am sure 3 or 4 could replace a dinner or large meal. The choice is yours: eat a loaf of whole-grain bread, or drink an Oatmeal Stout. The latter for me, please.  Paired interestingly with young French Brie cheese. It seemed to bring out the hardness of the water and add a metallic sourish tinge to the taste. The earthiness of the brie brought out the sweet fruitiness of the yeast and malts.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,cerevisiaephilus,4.45,"Great beer. Great nose, little funky, lots of character, kinda leathery but more appealing than that. Good rich flavor, a bit funky, really satisfying. Good chocolate malt flavor with the rich earthy funk really make this beer enjoyable. Could be a little sweeter or something to up the mouthfeel, but other than that, I really enjoy it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ppoitras,4.63,"550mL bottle, with foiled cap, part of the Samuel Smith's Selection Box, purchased at Yankee Spirits, Sturbridge, MA  Poured into an imperial pint glass, a frothy tan head forms on top of a barely translucent dark mahogany liquid. The head was impressively sized, and showed good staying power. Nice strong aroma, mainly of heavy dark malts, and the taste echos that, with the hearty taste associated with those grains. An aftertaste lingers of chocolate, with a slight undertone of coffee as well. A thoroughly enjoyable stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Southernbrew,4.21,"Poured beautifully, nice dark black. Provides a 2-3 finger head, nice and soapy. Head lasts a good while. When held up to light, produces a nice red-brown. Smells like molasses cookies, sweet but not overpowering. Medium mouthfeel surprisingly. Not too heavy, but assertive. Strong molasses taste, but hops keep sweetness in check. Great beer, could definitely put a few back if it were just a little less expensive.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,krberg,4.05,"One of my all time favorite beers. Thick and black with a tan head I alway think of it as a grown-up's Guinness. It has a wonderful roasty taste that is almost over-powering, but falls short and disappears into a smooth sweetness that reminds me of milk stouts. I have been drinking this beer longer than any other craft beer and it has yet to disappoint me. It feels appropriately thick and rich and really just satisfying. I don't think any stout lover would have difficulty putting quite a few of these away.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Zorro,5,"Poured in a proper Guinness glass so that it can be properly evaluated.  Pours a super dark brown/black, holding it up to strong light shows that this is in fact clear with red highlights.  Smell is Wow this is a Stout? Smells intensely fruity and complex like Belgian Strong brown ale. Probably 100 individual smells in this, coffee, toffee, orange, cinnamon, peaches, tutty fruity, and more. Probably one of the most fragrant brews in the world.  Tastes strongly of coffee and chocolate. Fruit flavors are here too, lots of apple, a bit of caramel, earthy flavors like olives.  Mouthfeel is hearty and thick.  Super drinkable. I don't normally really like Stout beer; this brew changed my point of view on this style of beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,GuinnessSmurf,4.35,"Poured into my glass to produce a giant creamy head - I had a Pavlovian response almost immediately. The beer had a deep, mahogany appearance, with maybe a bit of red coloring if the light hit it just so. Smell was inviting - a warm, malt smell and some dark fruit smells on top. The flavor was beautifully full, and maintains dimension without being overly complex. There is a wonderul sweetness that accompanies this beer. The roof of my mouth hummed with bitter while the tongue smiled in sweetness. Great beer - but what else can we expect from Sammy Smith.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,rajendra82,4.35,"Chocolate brown. dense, and sticky body that is not quite opaque with ruby red highlights when held up to the light. Thick tall khaki head formed easily and receded to a quarter inch thick layer of bubbles on top of the beer. Wonderful lacing and head retention and medium carbonation. Smells like lightly roasted grains, caramel, and honey. Flowery hops with very mild bitterness. Taste leans definitely towards toward the fruity sweet end of the spectrum, with a mixture of plums, raisins, and cherries. Warming and soothing with a mouthfeel that is a bit thinner than most stouts. A restrained sweet stout that is easy to drink.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Phyl21ca,4,"Bottle  Poured a pitch-black brew with a nice dark foamy head. Aroma is very sweet with linger of maltness. Taste is very sweet with some coffee and chocolate. No strong aftertaste or bitterness. This is a very creamy, easy beer. You can go wrong with that oatmeal stout if youre a fan of the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Jables,4.38,"Poured pitch black with thin tan head.  Aroma is sweet, aromatic and a hit of tartness.  That tartness comest through a little bit in the flavor but it's mostly sweet, smooth, and really creamy.  The mouthfeel, you guessed it, smooth and creamy, really awesome stuff.  The drinkability is great, yeah it's roasted like most stouts are but the oatmeal makes it so smooth you can just sit back, relax and enjoy this one.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,TerryW,4.1,"Good and dark with a substantial tan head. Impressive to look at.  Great nose on this beer. Chocolate, coffee, malt and a hint of hops. Real nice mix, not overpowering, quite inviting.  Lots of sweet, roasted malt in this baby. Sweet but not cloying, with just a touch of bitter hops to finish. Clear, clean chocolate and coffee flavours make this a wonderfully toothsome beer. Good intro for a newbie stout drinker",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Elemental,4.35,"appearance: nice dark black color with a lite velvety head  Smell: Somewhat sweet smelling with hints of english hops. A thick malty aroma that is very inviting.  Taste: big bodied with a nice smooth taste. Its slightly sweet in the begining but soon become mildly bitter. The taste is creamy and lite on the tongue with a nice balance between bitter and sweet.  Overall a wonderful oatmeal stout, a must try",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,alexgash,4.5,"Velvety dark coffee brown with a creamy tan head. The nose has that distinct Sam Smith sweet yeast smell, along with sweet roasted malts. Taste is smooth, moderately sweet, with mellow roasted malts throughout. Also some fruitiness (like all SS beers). Delicious. Good smooth feel, if maybe a tad watery. Very drinkable; I just wish it was cheaper!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BuckeyeNation,4.4,"Deep, dark mahogany brown with lighter brown, almost ruby, highlights. The cap has the color and surface texture of a freshly-baked oatmeal cookie. It's frothysticky, reasonably persistent and leaves a few small sheets and a few wisps of lace behind when it fades.  The nose is a little more subdued than some stouts, but a chocolate-covered coffee bean character is evident. Flavors include warm molasses cookies and coffee, along with very little chocolate. Oatmeal comes to the forefront as it warms and the beer becomes even more delicious as a result.  The mouthfeel is medium in heft, smooth and not especially creamy. There's a little too much carbonation for my tastes.  This is supremely drinkable beer that I'm enjoying immensely. Here's the short version of this review: Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout is a widely available, easy drinking, delicious version of an oatmeal stout and is one that will always have a place in my beer fridge.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,MobBarley,4.6,"Pours dark and slightly syrupy with just a shard of ruby shining through the pint glass. Ample (3+ finger) head reminiscent of taffy shrinks rather quickly, but a small pile persists throughout. Gorgeous.  A cidery, fermented smell that reminds me of Fall takes the forefront here, followed by warmer, heavier notes of molasses and char. A hint of rindy, hoppy bitterness lingers.  The smell is a solid indicator of the taste, with the same molasses presence dominating, joined by the sweet wholesome toastiness of oats as well as notes of dark chocolate, French Roast and roasted chicory. The finish on this one is quite syrupy, with just enough of a crisp hoppiness to keep the sweetness out of the ""sickly"" category.  This beer drinks like part of this complete breakfast. The astringency and heaviness of the beer make for some interesting sensations in the mouth. Carbonation low, but serves its purpose.  The drinkability is this stout's weak link in my humble estimation. Certainly something to nurse for a while and enjoy the nuances of as it warms.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,rkhaze,4.71,"Pours almost black with dark root beer brown hues escaping the edges. Big creamy brown head that got chunky as it slowly fell. Great lace. Nice start. Aromas of sweet roasted malt, coffee and chocolate.Hints of caramel and spiciness. Sweet and tangy flavors of roasted malt, coffee and milk chocolate. Finishes bittersweet with hints of caramel and molasses/licorice. Beautifully balanced by mildly citric hops. Outstanding! Medium bodied. Creamy, velvety smooth mouthfeel and zippy carbonation make for an extremely quaffable offering. Top of the line Oatmeal Stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Sammy,4.1,"Not as chewy and more drinkable thant St. Ambroise. Dark brown with sudsy head. Drink your oatmeal! Taste is strong in-you-face. Almost thought it was a higher alcohol content. Nice with my roast beef lunch.

113,571,CBFanWish,4.5,"I picked up the bomber at the Eats Ave. Wegman's. It poured a deep black colour with the perfect head of a dark tan hue. The smell was of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, and a slight bit of hops. The taste was wonderful with the taste of chocolate ant coffee being the strongest part of it. There was also hints of roasted grains and malts. Just the right amount of hops were also added were I could taste them, but not too much. It went down smooth. Maybe too smooth because I want more.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Gusler,4.8,"The beer pours as dark as a moon less night, black as a Raven, darker than the inside of a cow, I think you get the picture, head is Bunyanesque in size, spumous in texture and a toothsome light tan in color, as it ever so slowly dematerializes, the resultant lace a thick and glutinous blanket to obscure the glass. Ah that smell, rich sweet malt, toasted grains, coffee, earthy, sweet milk chocolate, a treat for the ocular and olfactory sense, start is ambrosial and rich in malt with the top middling in feel. Finish is benignly carbonated, the hops delectable and the aftertaste a blend of malts, hops and toasted grains, quite dry and pleasant, a long time favorite stout that never fails to please, and one that always occupies my DBF.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,TastyTaste,4.67,"Looks like most other stouts. Near pitch black, opaque liquid, with a tan head. The flavor really blows me away. Huge coffee, chocolate, and vanilla flavors. This is maybe the most flavorful Stout I have come across. Definitely a dessert beer, that I could not even think about sessioning. This is one that has a lot going on, and improves as it warms.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BierManVA,4.08,A deep dark syrup pour with a small head. The explosion of flavor is quite startling if you are not prepared for it. The malt is very well balanced and is not too heavy.

John,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Foxman,4.37,"It pours a deep dark brown, allowing light through only at the edges with a ruby-russet glow. A thick light tan head blossoms but settles quickly to a mottled plateau of froth. There's considerable pretty, variegated lacing.  The thick, oaten aroma almost smells like breakfast. Underneath the earthy sweetness lies a sherry/port vinous note melded with an air of currants.  The flavor delivers what the aroma promises, a dense, moderated sweetness of chewy oatmeal. The port and currants are resurrected in the middle of the mouthful. Still, the oatmeal pervades, almost like the dust covering the inside of a box of the milled oats. It gives way to a long-lingering bitter-sweetness at the back of the tongue. Throughout, the flavor maintains a texture that is almost tangibly chewy.  Thick and heavy bodied, tendrils of dark syrup coat and distribute oaty goodness all about the mouth, feeling almost like light molasses. It fills your mouth and virtually begs you to chew it.  If only it were socially acceptable to drink your breakfast, this would replace eggs and bacon, or scrapple, for me. It's just sweet enough to be a treat, with plenty of peripheral notes to intrigue the palate. It's full and earthy, never cloying, and so wonderfully refreshing. Despite its considerable heft, the lower ABV helps make it delightfully fresh and drinkable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,mntlover,4.68,"Balck wonderful brew with nice foamy tan head that falls to nice tan ring following the beer down. Smells of roasted malts, oats good earthy smelling brew of substance. Taste is perfect roasted malt, sweet oats with hints of coffee, chocolate, carmel and more sweet wonderful brew with touch of bitterness at the end to bring eveything together perfectly. Mouthfeel is great, you could almost live on this beer alone my favorite stout as of present can't imagine getting much better then this.

113,571,GeoffFromSJ,4.33,"Dear me, this was good! Looked great. Pitch black. Nice frothy, creamy head which lasted quite a while.  As someone who is not a stout fan, I have to say: really good! This didn't have the typical astringent taste I associate with stouts. Incredibly smooth. Which gives is a very high drinkability. The taste was pretty mellow however, which I liked. But at the end of the day, something like that cannot get a 5 for taste.  Well done. I'll definitely be having more of this in the future.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Beastdog75,4.1,"Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout is one of the most acclaimed beers around, and with good reason. Simply put, drinking this beer is like drinking a desert. What surprised me was that this was more mellow than I anticipated. If this beer was kicked up a few more notches my grade for it would be even higher. I took this one out of the case, so my sample was pretty much guaranteed to be fresh.  This oatmeal stout pours a very dark brown/black color with some slight amber hints. A milk chocolate colored foam forms and retains well, but leaves minimal lace. I thought there was some dark red wine smell in the aroma, along with roasted notes, alcohol, and cocoa. The mouthfeel is smooth and soft, with light carbonation. The first flavors I detected were of chocolate covered cherries and other dark fruits, with some rum raisin. The flavor is definitely sweet. The sweetness struck me as tea-like, and even had a hint of vanilla to it. Some light espresso, mocha and hazelnut notes show up, and there is some alcohol flavor here that strikes me as being slightly brandy-like. All these flavors meld into mellowness, and the finish has a roasted, slightly bitter dryness to it. The aftertaste is clean with some roasted dryness and bitterness as the only lingering qualities. This one finishes out with some alcoholic warmth.  Overall, this surprised me with its mellowness and drinkability. This is a myriad of flavors and textures, and to anybody who says they don't like beer I would point them toward this one. A classic.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,shirfan,4,"Dark, dark brown, a little light gets through the edges of the glass. Slight lacing follows down the glass.  A sweet chocolate and marshmallow aroma.  Taste didn't wow me to the level that this beer is ranked. Good, to be sure; smooth dark toast mingles with a more subdued roasty malt flavor. On the sweet side, and finishes with another hint of marshmallow. Only mild bitter tones as the glass warms to room temperature. A little too thin and mild mannered. I like stouts to be heavy, chewy and assertive; this meets none of those criteria.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,LuckySevens82,4.32,"This has always been one of my favorite stouts.  I originally had this beer for the first time in High School and just recently found a place around where I live that carries it. Needless to say I snatched it up if for no other reason than nostalgia.  Anyway, the beer pours a deep rich brown, nearly black. The head was nice and thick and the lace stuck to the edge of the glass until it was finished. I am a fan of Oatmeal Stouts and this one an all around good stout. I highly recommend it. The taste is great and unlike some beers you can spend your time on it without it tasting awful on the last bit.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,HochFliegen,4.03,As a stout lover this is one of my favorites. Looks very dark and rich in flavor. An off white creamy head full of complex aromas. Alcholic and sweet are the two that stand out to me. Very rich tasting but much lighter than other stouts Ive had. It starts off very rich and creamy and finishs slightly dry. An Excellent beer.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,qbushido,4.37,"The first thing that struck me about this stout was the aroma, Very complex, almost sweet, with what I thought could have been vanilla among other things. The #1 surprise was the texture and consistency of this beer, I was expecting something much thicker, more like guiness, and boy was I surprised, a much smoother, lighter consistency with a great taste and just enough flavor to let you know you are drinking something quality without being over whelming. It took me more time to get a good overall sense of this stout then I would have expected, a compliment to the complexity of the flavor.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,daledeee,4.63,"I enjoyed the Smith Imperial Stout so much I thought I would give this a try. No regret.  Pours a beautiful dark glas with nice head and lace. Nose is vanilla, caramel, chocolate, earthy and alchohol.  Taste is mellow and beautiful. Like a milk shake. Smooth and creamy. A hair too sweet to keep from a 5 for taste. Malt and caramel are the prominent tastes; fairly sweet with a hint of chocolate. This is such a rich beer. A great desert.  I find it hard to rate any stouts higher than this.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Shiloh,3.95,"A very black offering with a thick tan crown, then, thin lace with marginal cling and a thick bubbled ring. The body is full. Carbonation by apperance is unknown. Nose has a malty sweetness about it. Interesting taste in that chocolate is obvious, yet bitter. A malty linger sensation to end which was short. Slight syrupy mouthfeel on closing. Not a session brew but very nice for dining.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,waughbrew,2.22,"Looks nice, with a fluffy light-brown head. Smells pretty funky, some plasticity and acidity. Flavor starts nice enough, although too sweet for my liking. Good molasses in there with the roasted grains. Finish is pretty bad, kind of like what I think varnish would taste like. Although I admire the distinctness of this brew and its fermentation flavors, I find it to be very unpleasant. Poor aroma and poor finish. How is this rated so high? I would like to see people's thoughts on this in blind taste tests so that there is no bias towards this popular brewery.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,NearerMyBeerToMe,4.17,"I had this a few nights ago at a tavern in the 355 ml bottle and wasn't impressed (old, musty, excessively yeasty). But I decided to give it another shot for this review, and picked up a 550 ml bottle from a different establishment. So: pours a deep, deep brown; basically black at the center; rosewood/chestnut highlights appear when brew is held to light. Not much of a head on first pour, just a thin film of foam... a more vigorous pouring on the second attempt revealed an off-white to tan, dusky head about two fingers deep that eventually settled slightly. And the aroma... what a difference there was between this bottle and my previous sample! So much fresher, with a pleasant smell of fresh bread, rolled oats and a raisiny touch up front, sustained by a pervasive cream sherry sweetness throughout. The flavor continues the trend: more distinct cream sherry tones accompany a dark (almost pumpernickel?), oatmealy midpalate while remaining subtle and light. Suggestions of black bread, prunes, and puffed wheat cereal round everything out, punctuated by a bit of English hop dryness. Near perfect mouthfeel. Creamy and light, stunningly silky and smooth, but also tingly, dry, and warming... almost distributes itself across the palate without you even trying. Nowhere near the density I expected from such mealy flavors and aromas. Drinkability is hampered (if you can call it that) only because the brew is deeply satiating and filling--a beer to be savored and slowly digested--a bottle at a time will be enough. Tasty; soothing. Recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,DagFishHead,4.7,"Appearance: Deep, dark, mahogany pour with a thick, lush, frothy head that lasts and lasts, leaving creamy lace everywhere. Smell: Roasted malt, earthy, espresso and bitter chocolate. Taste & Mouthfeel: Stunningly rich, smooth, and creamy malt start, followed by an alcohol/carbonation tingle, that subsides with a semi-dry hop finish that allows some of the roasty, earthy, malt sweetness to linger in the aftertaste. Drinkability: Obviously a tremendous stout. The oatmeal takes some of the more exciting stout edges off IMO, but if this is all I can find to complain about, I'm in heaven.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Dmann,4.65,"One word comes to mind when I drink this brew...smoothe! This beer poures a dark dark brown with just a little light being able to sneak through the edges and a nice tan head that leaves a nice lace down to the last drop. The smell has hints of roasted toffee and carmel and a little bit of coffee scent as well. The taste is out of this world, not only is is the smoothest stout you could ask for, it tastes just as it smells with a carmel, toffee and coffee flavor but with just the right ammount of sweetness to round it out. This is a great dark beer to give someone to introduce them to the stout/porter style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,silks636,3.94,"Poured from a 550ml clear bottle. No freshness date.  Opaque brown. Sticky rosy tan head with excellent retention. Subtle earthy and sweet aroma with hints of roasted malt. Taste walks a fine line between strong earthy malt and milky sweetness. A touch of hops makes it's presence known toward the finish although it quickly yields to a burnt coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth.  It's been a while since I've had one, and I had forgotten how wonderful this beer is. The usual complaints about the clear bottles not withstanding, Samuel Smith has always been one of my favorites. While not my favorite from them, this one is still a top notch brew. As has been mentioned before, this is great intro stout for those looking to delve into the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,merlin48,4.43,"Poured from a clear 12 oz bottle. Quite a surprise to find the bottle clear, but the top is foil wrapped and the pour is a very dark brown. Thick beige head eventually calms down to reveal a bit of the cherry color on the outside rim that was noted by some other reviewers. Don't know where that cherry hue comes from, but it makes for an exceptional appearance. Dark malts and chocolate dominate the nose, but there are hints of fresh baked bread and cooked oatmeal. Smooth, full bodied and filling in the mouth. Taste is of a well balanced stout that ehoes the nose. Very tasty. I took my time with this one because it's just too good to finish(it's my only one). One of the best that I've reviewed. My only complaint is a somewhat unpleasant syrupy aftertaste, but I guess that goes with the territory. Can't wait to get some more of these. I like oatmeal, stouts, and English brews, so a quality oatmeal stout like this is very seductive to my senses and perspective, as well as my sense of perspective.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Smell: plenty of roasted malt and enormous hints of cocoa. i little chocolatey as well. a very apetizing nose.  Taste: again, a nice roatsed flavour of oates and malt. hints of cocoa and chovolate give the beer nice body without being heavy. a very nicely, lingering finish that leaves a chalky-dry finish.  Mouthfeel: smooth with still a hint of liveliness. leans toward a dry and fullfilling finish.

A quick review of my stock showed I hadn&#8217;t reviewed one of my favorites, so here we go. Note: stored this beer on its side in a drawer in my beer fridge (space issue, not a conscious choice). Held the beer for a good 6 months that way, and noted when I opened it, it tried to gush. Tried to: head formed up to just above the lip, but held steady there. Clear bottle (ick) 550 ml bomber with foil cap, no date. Aroma: Roasted malt with a hint of hop. A has that classic stout nose, much like Guinness. Bread like notes are prominent. Appearance: Black, with strong back light showing, well&#8230; the slightest clear black. Hefty tan head of 3 fingers when poured settled down to a brown coat with a variety of large and small bubbles. Nice thick lace graced my mug, and the head lasted throughout my beer. Flavor: The deep roasted malt and oats give a rich earthy goodness to the overall flavor, and I tasted the hops deep in there keeping the brew well balanced. The profile seems to go: sweet rich malt, gentle twang of hops, odd metallic low point, concluding with a smooth long semi-sweet chocolate finish. Mouthfeel: Rich and creamy with lots of chew. No carbonation noted and a slight numbing tingle experienced in the aftertaste. Very smooth stuff. The oats give a nice coating to your whole mouth that slowly fades into the sunset. Overall Impression: Hard to figure how such a heavy, rich tasting beer comes off as light and refreshing. This is an excellent beer all around, and a personal favorite, but that odd metallic bottoming out spot is a bit distracting. It may be due to my unorthodox storage, or I may have let this one go a bit longer than I should have. Beautiful balance, wonderful quality, chug-ability, just about everything you could want in a beer. Scratches every beer itch I have. Strongly recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,NJpadreFan,3.78,Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout scared me very much!  As a beer drinker I have not yet moved up to the darker stout beers. I still think Guiness is mud! With that I said hell lets give this Oatmeal Stout a try.  At Petersons liquor store on rte. 70/Brielle Bridge I purchased the 550 ml bottle ($3.75)  This beer poured a very dark reddish brown with a fluffy dark tan head. The smell was of burnt coffee- that worried me! The first sip proved that it was velvety smooth and soft. The taste was actually very good! It was a light coffee/chocolate flavor that wasn't bitter or harsh yet smooth and enjoyable.  Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is a very good sipping beer that would go nice with a meal. Enjoy slowly.  Not a chugging or partying beer!,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,AbePhroman,4.42,"I bought a 550ml bottle for $2.99. It poured a very dark brown, much like the imperial stout. Much sweeter taste. Less fruiter than the imperial which tasted like raisins. This is sweet yet subtle in the oatmeal flavor. A very dark malt is present in this one. I drink it alot at Phish concerts, and it is a favortie choice at home. I do like the imperiral stout more, however.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,rorytmeadows,4.6,"This stout has a sharp, ""bite"" to it, with the mild stouty oat flavor. Delicious to drink for sampling and for those Friday nights. It's flavor is different than other oatmeals and is more highly recommended for those wanting to try an oatmeal. It captures the essence of oatmeals without the taste disappearing due to nitrous cans.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Zraly,4.66,"Pours a wonderful tan head and is black as a moonless, starless night. I just had to dip my pointer finger into the foam, as if it were whipped cream. The appearance is that tempting. Super-tight carbonation and the lacing is well-provided.  This oatmeal stout is remarkably smooth, undeniably accessible, and a true gem in the beer world. The taste has a true award-winning style. Smells of black licorice, leather, earth, and freshly ground coffee beans. Full malt flavors, even a mild taste of what I would call an ""Irish Cream"" flavor. Rich, buttery smoothness...and the finish is as mild and friendly as a tall, cold glass of milk after woofing down some homemade chocolate chip cookies. There is a nuance of a ""chew"" in the finish and an tiny note of spice in the end. (I think I am tasting something nutmeg-like.) Vinous feel from this offering, perhaps a California Zinfandel? A comparison to ponder and test out.  I like this as my dessert. I don't need much else.  I could consider this a ""comfort beer"". I'm going to miss it when it is gone.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,TAMU99,4.3,"This one certainly deserves its place on the Top50 list.  A: Dark brown, attractive color, a meedium off white head is slow to fade but leaves littel lace down the glass  S: Fruity smell with a deep overtone that defies recognition (at least I couldn't identify it). Very nice  T: Wow! Sweet caramel and raisins with a complex, well crafted malt profile. Each mouthful highlights just a little different taste in the beer. Sure keeps you interested.  M: Smooth and creamy, it lingers just long enough without interfering with anything else.  D: Very drinkable, I hnestly expected a bitter taste, but not at all.  Highly recommended, this is a GREAT beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,yankeeheel,3.88,"Pours a very dark black/red with just a hint of light coming through. Alcohol is the first thing I smell followed by some cherry and fig.  The taste is quite earthy and smokey. I definitely get some dark fruit in there as well. Plum maybe? Very smooth and solid mouthfeel, with an almost too dry finish for an oatmeal stout.  Very complex and tasty, but I think it's a little overhyped.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,OatmattStout,4.58,What can I say about this one that hasn't already been said. I will add a few things that stand out in my mind. Increadible silky mouthfeel. I find it to have a smoked or chared malt flavor to it as venom stated but also some really peaty undertones like a Scotish ale. Also did notice a red wine finish in its dryness. Awesome any way you slice it.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,beernbbq,4.47,"Ah, this puts most other Oatmeal Stouts to shame. Smooth, silky, lots of coffee and chocolate flavors coming through with a light hop touch to keep you looking for another. I enjoyed this with some steamers on a recent night out. In fact, I enjoyed two. Nothing over the top about this beer, just plain fantastic.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Mustard,4.25,"Presentation: 18.7oz. translucent bottle; no ""best before"" or ""bottled on"" date; purchased for $2.49 from Trader Joe's.  Appearance: Completely opaque; smallish, cocoa-brown head; a nice c-cup's worth of lacing; head hangs around for about a minute.  Aroma: Nicely of chocolate and plums with just a hint of cherry.  Taste: Decidedly like its nose; large notes of bittersweet chocolate, plums and cherry wrestle each other like a pack of greasy monkeys; decently sweet with a mild, roasty bitterness; subtly earthen; mild, acidic twang; full bodied with a smooth, crisp mouthfeel.  Notes: Six thumbs up.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,flaminghomer,4.38,"the last time i tried Samuel Smith, it was Imperial Stout. I didn't get the carbonation that i was longing for. i was worried about this beer having the same quality. thankfully, i was wrong! this beer has an exellent tan head that lasts a good time.  it tastes as good as it looks. (typical quality stout flavors and smells abound)  the thing that really got me about this beer was it's aftertaste that lingers and transforms from one great thing into another. maybe more experienced beer lovers get that from alot of differant beers, but for me it was the first time. another thing a like about this beer is it's drinkablity, tons of flavor, but light in the mouth and in the stomach. i'm used to drinking Guiness Extra Stout for my stout fix. this beer is a welcomed change.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,grynder33,4.33,"I have to fall in line with just about everyone else on this one.The tempting darkness of the brew is gothicly beautiful, as is the teasing carmel oatmeal aroma.Sweet carmelly aste floats right with you for the entire glass.Bitterness never showed its face. I thought the mouthfeel was just a little to high charged, but that just made it a thirst quencher, instead of just a sipping beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,rabidawg,4.7,"Appearance: Near-opaque deep ruby. Small, creamy head that laced in spots and streaks.  Smell: Roasted nut and oatmeal. Ripe fruits and a slight vinous character.  Taste: Smooth and sweet at first, turning creamy in the middle. Slight dark fruit flavor. Definite creamy chocolate, with a roasty, toasty backdrop like no other I've had. Loamy earthiness throughout.   Notes: Exceptional stout, and one of my new favorite beers. Find it, drink it, and sing its praises. It's that good, and should appeal to almost every type of beer drinker.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,HappyHourHero,4.77,"Poured from a 550 ML bottle, there was a small layer of fine head that disappeared fairly quickly. Hold it up to the light and you wouln't see much through it.  Love that outmeal stout smell, sweat kind of oatmeally caramel scent. Haven't found an outmeal stout I didn't like, but this is still one of my favorites. The taste is just short of rich, sweet at first, and then the oats roll in and smooth it all out. I can feel those tiny little bubbles of carbonation roll along my tongue with each sip.  If you haven't tried this one yet, you should already be on your way to the store.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,UnionMade,4.8,"The beer pours a nearly opaque black, just a touch of reddish light shining through on the bottom. A thick beige head tops the liquid, leaving some sticky cobwebby lace as your drink the beer down. The aroma is very roasty, with a solid hearty oatmeal presence. Plenty of chocolatey aroma, with a Fruity Pebbles like esteriness. Light caramel and some mocha, with a trace of goldings hopping. Flavor is creamy and sweet, with a big oatmeal flavor all the way through. Chocolate malt right up front, providing a bittersweet baker's chocolate flavor, melding into mocha coffee towards the middle. Some light plum and cherry fruitiness comes through in the middle, with a vague fruity pebbles feel to the esters. Mild hopping provides some dryness in the finish, although the bitterness mostly comes from the roasted barley. A rich, luxurious oatmeal flavor in the finish, continuing into the aftertaste, where it blends with some sweet mocha, lingering for a while. Smooth british carbonation, with a medium to full body. Probably one of the best oatmeal stouts I've ever tried. Perfect balance, excellent flavor. Absolutely world class.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Kwak,4.45,"This oatmeal stout poured thick Into the glass thick and heavy. when the glass settled I could see the thick black smoke like body and the supper chunky tan head. the head kind of slithered down the glass as i drank, It was almost a meal in itself. the almost spice aroma jumped up and bit me. the first sip was almost heavy it was thick and full of flavor, rich malty with just a hit of bitter balanced out well.

Think of the color of very very very very high-quality baker's chocolate. Smallish head of light brown bubbles. No retention or lacing. I may have served this a bit too cold.  Smell: Pruny, with lotsa roasted and dark chocolate malts in the background. Kinda smoky. Faint whiffs of sprucy hops.  Taste: Strong bittersweet chocolate taste that morphs into somme nice smoky malt goodness. Just a hint of bitter hops. These flavors meld much better when the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: Hearty, oh so hearty. A very zaftig mouthfeel with a great lingering smoky aftertaste.  Drinkability: It's a meal in a bottle, to be sure, so it's not one you'll be having too much in one sitting, but you'll definitely want to have more of this.

I even held it up to direct light - nothing. A large creamy mocha colored head formed and slowly melted down to a thin cap with some nice lace. I could smell this brew from a foot away! A variety of aromas came at me: burnt grains, bitter old espresso grounds, dark fruit notes, and a faint whiff of alcohol, surprising considering this beer's %ABV is only 5.0% Tasting only confirmed what my nose was telling me: this is a wonderful, well-balanced beer. A great combination of dark, burnt malts, smooth espresso, sweet prune-like edges and carmelized brown sugar, and just a bit of bittersweet baker's chocolate. It finished with a slight alcohol tang. Feel was full-bodied, thick yet smooth, and dry. This is one of the most delicious beers I'd had. All the elements are here for a truly great beer. Expertly crafted and so very easy to drink.

Taste: Creamy milk tones with fruit and robust coffee and chocolate textures a mild taste of alcohol presence running through it just so easily balanced this beer is tops in the style.

Smell is hard to place bitter and acidic. Could this be the oatmeal? Light sweet nutty smell as well.  Taste is creamy and smooth juxtaposed bitter flavors. Brew is malty with a burnt-nut taste. Doesn't bite like alot of stouts. This brew is smooth but still complex. I would call it medium bodies despite the bold appearance. Very drinkable.  One of the better stouts I have tasted.

Drank this delicious offering with a rib eye, and some fresh veggies from the farmers market here in Chicago on a beautiful early September day and it was like matching a fine wine with food! From the get go this beer showed its colors. Deep, nearly black with red tones around the edges. The smell and taste made me think of oatmeal chocolate chip cookies that I baked as a kid. The mouthfeel was velvety, creamy and very easy to enjoy. Taste wise I found ample stoutlike qualities-chocolate, mocha etc, yet this one had that oatmeal thing going that perhaps gave it the complexity to make it just a bit more unique that other stouts. I thought this to be a very rewarding food beer, and recommend it for that next rib eye off the grill.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

Poured black as night, with a nice reverse cascade on pour that created a very rocky head that had swiss cheese-like holes from a side view. Left bubbly foam stain. Smelled of chocolate, oats, dark scents that were malty and roasty, and no hops &#8211; great. Tasted of bitter chocolate and sweet chocolate, dark malt mixed with roasted barley, and a very quiet soda-like sour from the oats. So mild and comforting, and that real good sweetness, too. Finish was far from drying, it leaves things smooth and slick, with small roasted barley and dark malt flavors in the back of my mouth, reminding me of that sweetness. No hops &#8211; great.

The rating above are for a bottle that must have been under the flouresecent lights too long. For a beer this expensive, to package it in clear glass is flat out stupid. The one I had Saturday had an unpleasant bitterness at the end while not skunked was not a pleasant hop bitterness but an sourly sort of bitterness. I felt very ripped off.  If you can buy this straight out of the case, it will be one of the best oatmeal stouts you will ever drink.

The beer is quite sweet and malty, and I noticed a burnt peanut-ty taste. Yes, it's a dark stout, but it was very easy to drink. I had this with my dessert, and it was a fantastic finish to my meal.

The nose was very inviting. dark malts, a sugary sweet smell, almost has some slight hints of smoke, some nice soft fruit smells, fresh pears and even some apples. What an odd smell for a stout, but so perfectly balanced with the slight roasty smokey smell.  The taste was just as impressive. Medium bodied. Some light smoke, light roasted malt charector. Some soft chocolate. Brown sugar. A slightly oaky woody quality. A touch of earth. A very nice earthy hop, pear and apple peel taste. It starts very smooth and ends with this nice little bitter earthy punch, with just some soft hints of smoke.  It seems to linger for a little while with a nice earth bitterness.  Overall it's just such an amazing beer. Like a backwoods country stout. Earth, fruit, smoke and soft dark sugary malts. No wonder it's so popular among phishheads.

Taste was a velvety smooth dollup of mildly toasted malt, caramel and brown sugar, finishing with a slight hoppyness accompanied by a mildly raisiny taste. Mouthfeel is not as creamy as, say, a Guinness, but still nice. This beer is initially easy to drink, but one winds up slowing down because its very filling, otherwise I'd give higher marks for drinkability.

Smell is of slight, roasty coffee/espresso, but is not overwhelming. Taste is pretty much the same as it smells, with possible hints of chocolate added to the mix. As with the smell, not too strong. The mouthfeel of this one is delightful! Very smooth, milky, and creamy on the palate. Only reason its not a 5 in my book, is that it could be just slightly thicker.

This time it was like I had hoped it would be. Awesome. Lots of flavor. Not as much oatmeal flavor as I had expected but that was ok. Very roasted in nose and on the tongue. Roasted barley hits me first with malt and caramel sweetness. It proceeds to be very roasted but also creamier in the middle. Earthy tones and burnt hops are there to mellow the sweetness a bit. Finishes short and sweet. I want more.  edit: I have had this one a few times recently and it has definitely become one of my favorites. Also, the oatmeal taste is more prevalent now.

It poured a deep ruby black, with a creamy dense head that hung around for a bit, leaving some lace on the glass.  The aroma was sweet malt, buttery grains, and chocolate. Very appetizing.  The flavour was rich and roasted. Lots of malty sweetness, some burned bitterness, a good bit of apple fruitiness, and some caramel and buttery undertones. An oatmeal flavour was in there as well. Overall it was quite interesting and complex. There was an odd metallic twang in there that I can't quite figure out. It was a satisfying stout, without a doubt.  The mouth feel was smooth, but I didn't quite find as much of the oaty slickness that I would expect from an oatmeal stout.  To summarize: this maybe isn't my absolute favourite stout, but in all the stouts I've had, this one strikes the balance between amazing quality and popular drinkability. That is, I think most of my friends would be a little overwhelmed by, say, Shakespeare Stout, but they'd really appreciate this one.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

I owe this beer a lot. It's the best beer to come out of a clear bottle, that's for sure. Nowadays, I'd have to say I prefer the Imperial Stout offering by Sammy Smith's. But this is one stout I will always fall back upon and enjoy thoroughly. It's damn near opaque with a well-retaining tan head. The aroma is mostly burnt chocolate malt, faint coffee, sweetness, and hops. Same goes with the flavor as far as I'm concerned. It has a buttery, if slightly thin but still thick enough for a stout mouthfeel. And it's creamy....drinkable as all hell. I only prefer the Imperial because I'm on a robust kick.

It was still good, but it because great the closer to the optimal serving temperature, which IMHO is just slightly, slighty chilled or between 60-70 degrees F.  Poured a deep, dark brown almost black with a slight reddish tinge to it. The head was frothing and creamed coffee in color. Good lacing through out the sample.  Aromas of roasted malt, oatmeal, chocolate, and coffee with hints of earth and peat.  Taste is wonderful, full bodied roasted sweet malt flavor dominates the palette. The texture is creamy and silky smooth with hints of earth and peat that give way to a dry coffee bitterness that finishes with just the slightest hint of hops for balance. There are also undertones of toffee, caramel, and chocolate throughout the flavor profile that hit hear and there as this incredibly smooth and easy drinking stout go down way to quickly. I tried to slow down and savor the flavors, but this stout just glides across the tongue, through the mouth, and down the throat.  Truly a wonderful brew and a well crafted stout. Two Pints Up!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Indybeer,3.82,"As others have said, Whats with the clear glass bottle. Poured a dark chocolate brown, with a chocolate head that slowly receded leaving a fair amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is of roasted malt, a hint of chocolate, and coffee. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, however the taste didn't live up to the aroma. Sweet from the malt with some coffee but little else. Not bad, but not the best Oatmeal stout I've had. Overall it was still enjoyable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,tar,4.23,"From the clear bottle pours forth a black beer with a light tan to light brown head, which is composed of many tiny bubbles and diminishes somewhat quickly. The aroma is of roasted malt. Not particularly strong, but inviting. The taste is wonderful and full of many flavors including chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee. A taste similar to sherry also comes through especially in the dry finish. Very smooth and very enjoyable. Highly drinkable despite being a medium to heavy bodied beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,WesWes,4.15,"The beer pours black witha full tan head that is well retained. The aroma is of dark malts. There is something in it that I just can't put my finger on; maybe it's the yeast or an aromatic specialty grain. The taste is excellant. A good stout with that oatmeal flavor. Chocolate malts overpower me in a good way. It is such a balanced ale. A real pleasure to drink. The mouthfeel is med/heavy body, but a real drinkable beer. A low abv. (5%) means that many can be had without getting too loose. Another great brew from this respected brewery.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BierReise,2.79,"Ok, Now i'm finished with beer in clear glass. This one was slightly skunked as well. I'll never make another attempt at this. Looks nice, dark with foamy head. Aroma is sadly tainted. Same with flavor, although not as bad as the nutbrown I had earler. Good mouthfeel and probably a good hopped stout. Maybe I'll plan a trip to England and try this one. On draught.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,JohnnyDuvel,4.18,"The only other time I drank this beer, I had it in comparison with Sammy's Imperial. It is not as malty or subtantial (and isn't supposed to be). I tried it again tonight, and although it still comes across as somewhat mild for a stout, it has a nice, well balanced taste. Terrific appearance in the glass, with a large foamy head. I still prefer the imperial, but this is a very smooth, enjoyable beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,waboone,3.67,"It has been several years since I first tried this stout. It's expense put me off, and I am generally not much of a stout person. I pick up a bottle recently and just sat down to enjoy it. I should have let it set on the counter for a while to warm up, but I generally drink my beer slowly and now, an hour after I retrieved it from the fridge, it is a good temperature.  The head doesn't last as long as good stout's head should, but perhaps this is due to the fact that it is bottled. The smell seems to allude to a complexity that is not present in the taste. When bringing the glass to your mouth smell chocolate, caramel and coffee beans, but the taste delivers only the chocolate. It is overly sweet for my taste, and, dare I say it, it is too smooth.  As stated earlier, I am not much of a stout drinker, so I would humbly categorize this as a beginner's stout. And, as a beginning stout drinker, I am looking to move to something a little deeper and with more character.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,irishmoss,4.75,"A very nice dark stout, that when held to light I only imagine that there's a little reddish-brown color around the outsides of the glass. I light tan head that stuck around for a while and left a nice sticky lace down the sides. The flavor is sweet and malty with a hint of bitter-chocolate. Nice and creamy with a very clean finish and with only 5% abv this is one that I can drink all night. The only reason that I left room for improvement in my score is that it's not GLBC Ohio City.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,SheepNutz,4.57,"I had this beer in a 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip style glass. The color is a deep black with 2 fingers of dark tan head. There is a bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is sweet roasted coffee maybe. The taste is very sweet, not hoppy at all. Almost a mix of toffee and coffee in this. Nice sweet finish that is just great. The mouthfeel is very strong, I love it! The drinkability is a little low for a 5.0%. Great stout though that I will enjoy again soon.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,IronDjinn,3.88,"A dense opaque stout, that's for sure. Direct sunlight has an effort trying to permeate it. It pours out with a dark bubbly cake of a head that doesn't last the ride, but leaves a fairly impressive lace. It possesses a sweet, sweet nose--is there any lactose in there? A bittersweet flavour, but in reverse (sweet/bitter?), with a somewhat boozy acidic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, but with a bit of an acidic edge at the very end, which doesn't make it as velvety as it looks. However this is still a good stout, although I could only handle one per sitting, and I was weened on Guinness (which is by no means an exemplar of the style, just a starting point). A fine specimen for those with a sweet tooth.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,GeoffRizzo,4.85,"Pours a light ink black in color with a two finger foamy head. Aroma of burnt malts and some chocolate. Sweet and creamy, slippery smooth, somewhat acidic and smokey. Some dark roast coffee and a slightly dry finish, leaves you yearning for more. Incredible stout, should own it's own category.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,kbub6f,3.86,"Bought locally (Grapevine refrigerated shelves), a couple of weeks in my fridge, reviewed 45F-65F.  A big, dense brown head hosts little explosions. The beer is dark black with deep garnet highlights. The lacing is thick and sticky.  The sweet toffee smell is echoed in the front of the beer. The middle is sweet and malty, just a little oily. Just a touch of smoky coffee shows up in the finish. This is a good beer. It's almost a little too sweet for me, though it dries a little and gets creamier with temperature.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,far333,4.01,"Dark mahogany brown, with a foamy brown head. The head lingers a bit and leaves, but produces good lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, and the flavor matches the aroma, but then throws in a hint of hop bitterness, with nuances of coffee and chocolate. Very well-balanced, very nice creamy mouthfeel.

113,571,xgrigorix,4.18,"Pours like black espresso with one finger of tight tan head floating on top.  Mostly roast coffee aromas.  Smooth & creamy, full bodied. Like velvet.  Tastes of raisins, coffee, & chocolate mix well with the lucious roast malt flavor. Finishes smooth & bittersweet, with a very sublte hop character that keeps the sweetness in check.  I could drink this all night!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Tballz420,4.41,"Black as night, only small amount of red shows through when held up to the light. Loads of lacing. Well what can i say, this is a fine beer.

113,571,dwarbi,4.38,"Pours with a thick, creamy head. Head settles nicely. Extremely dark brown. Smells... ""oaty""! Some nuts, too. Well rounded, complex, but soothing taste. Toasted oats are obvious but not over the top. Slight, pleasant aftertaste. Very drinkable. I could go a night drinking only this.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,jlervine,4.09,"Appearance is gorgeous - thick and black, with a ruby hue when (and if) the light can get through. Not much noticeable in the aroma, almost a roasted malt smell. The taste is nice and thick, slowly developing the hops and roasted grains in the middle of your tongue while titillating the edges of your tongue with fizziness. Very thick and relaxing.  I am glad that this bottle wasn't skunked, as it is very enjoyable - probably the most enjoyable of the 4 Samuel Smith brews I have had this evening.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,dmarch,4.34,"This should be given to anyone who thinks that all stouts taste like guinness. Black in color with a thin tan head. I found little to know aroma at all. This is it's only downfall. The taste though, is fantastic. It's a very robust molasses like taste that lingers on my tongue for quite some time. The mouthfeel is very thick and it goes down smooth. Certaintly one of the best examples of the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,kwill,3.57,"Pours the obvious thick black like any good oatmeal stout should. The head was almost non-existant, but I think it could have been better had I poured more vigorously from the beginning. Smell is sweet and malty, but there is more chocolate than oatmeal in the aroma.  Unfortunately the taste didn't deliver on everything that the smell promised. There was a definite malty sweetness, but only faint hints of outmeal and chocolate, and there was more of a burnt flavor than anything else. The mouthfeel isn't quite as thick as I was hoping from a good stout.  Not a bad beer, and definitely drinkable, but not one that I will order again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,canucklehead,4.6,A light brown moonscape head sits upon black gold. This beer is one of the greats with its chocolate biscuit mouthfeel and burnt notes that increase as the beer warms up.

One of my favourite beers I haved tasted.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,John,3.51,"Nice dark brown, nearly opaque color. Head is steady, tan in color. A slight skunky smell taints the aroma. The skunk dissipates (or the senses acclimatize), but the nose is faint. Only with a vigorous swirl is there any aroma generated. Sweetish oatmeal and some chocolate notes are detected. Many of the characteristics of the aroma are noted in the taste and are a bit more pronounced. Body is light, mouthfeel smooth and drinkable. A slightly above average oatmeal stout IMHO.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Scooter77,4.13,"What can I say, but Holy Freakin Cow. This is one absolutely smooth beer. Pours a deep brown color topped off by an incredibly thick and creamy head. Head retains itself for the entire duration, leaving a thin, sticky coating of lace on the glass. Nose is full of roasted oats, toffee, and mild nutty undertones. The taste is very similar to the aroma, mildly sweet and very delicious. The mouthfeel is total smoothness. I highly recommend this brew to any lover of fine stouts.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,LarryKemp,4.58,"This oatmeal stout poured a very, VERY deep amber almost black. It was clear when held to a light. The ample dark tan head held on for the entire time it took to drink the clear 550 ml bottle. The roasted aroma was muted but very nice. The roasted flavor grabbed my tongue. It semi sweet taste lingered long after the liquid was swallowed. There was almost a wee heavy aspect of the roasted and chocolate combination. The mouthfeel was creamy and clung to my tongue. This is an exceptional beer and I would recommend this to anyone.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ThePostmaster,3.86,"After hearing about this for a long time I finally tried it. Wow. This is good stuff. Pours black with a large dark creamy head.

113,571,longpondbeerman,4.4,"I ordered a large (clear) bottle of this Oatmeal Stout at my newly-opened local beerpub, Mary's, and I savored its thick, dark, earthiness over delightful conversation with one of the pub's owners on a serenely slow Tuesday night. The stout poured an almost jet black (just a slight shimmer of red--but the lighting was low) with a deep tan head. It had a distinct musty smell and only the slightest hint of fruit. The mouthfeel was excellent; it was viscous and even creamy with little carbonation. The taste had a heavy maltiness, like caramel, and again the subtle citrus fruitiness lingered on the back of my buds. I liked it a lot, so I ordered another, and it continued to charm me--in all, a good choice from start to finish.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,darklager,4.6,"This beer pours an extremely black color with a beautiful brown head which laces the glass all the way down. It has a mild chocolate nose with whiffs of sweetness. This beer is smooth and yet has the most complex flavor of any oatmeal stout I've had yet. I can taste the oats, chocolate, roasted goodness and even some hoppiness. This brew has a nice thick mouthfeel that helps keep the flavor lingering until you are ready for the next drink. This is without a doubt the best Oatmeal Stout I've had to date. While it is a little on the expensive side, it is definitely something I will treat myself to again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,tavernjef,4.25,"Comes in a clear bottle so you see the deep brown with light red tones right in the bottle. Pouring it into a glass I immediately smell the oats and malt, very fresh and doughy sweet, like walking into a bread bakery, yum. Taste is very good and smooth with great balance of dark sweet malts. It even lingers in the mouth and throat after swallowing with oats and solid malty flavors. Great creamy finish with some cocoa and some nut-like notes and a slight twingey dryness. Has a smooth body feel with more then enough texture, super yum. Absolutly excellent. Recommendation is high for this UK keeper.  Rivisit Aug. 29th - Tweeked the numbers a bit - color of used motor oil and nearly pours as thick, finger high head of yellowish cream of spongyness, crumbles fast, spotty lace that sticks like glue. Aroma is strong of oats and molasses, some sweet bitter chocolate and lots of solid roasted malts with cherry and plum notes. Enjoyably wafting stout nose. Taste really smacks of nice sweet oat character the whole way through, almost too much, its sweetness is chewy and strong. Roasted malts play secondary on the palatte along with some darl fruityness of plum and very light bitter chocolate notes which alll mostly come through near the finish. Feell is super creamy smooth, medium body with the center being more full. Has a easy, relaxing calm smooth finish thats lightly dry.

This beer looks pretty darn good right from the first pour..seems to pour heavy it musters a large tan frothy head..but that only lasts a minute of two before it dissapates down to a thick lace around the glass edge. The beer it self is a deep dark mahogany brown..with some ruby highlights...nice. the smell is malty and fresh..can maybe sense some oats. This beer has a great chewy long lasting tatse for one so low in alcohol..good job.. i taste some malt, some choclate ( milk chocolate for a change) some coffee undertones and a creamy taste right at the end..very well done. Mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth yet not lacking in taste bud tingling!! My Lord a very drinkable stout..if this were not so exspensive i could see me downing quita few of these most weekends!! Overall great beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,AtLagerHeads,4.18,"Not normally a dark beer drinker I think this great beer helps to change my mind about the darker brews. This is an outstanding drink that looks good and tastes great. It has great black coloring with a decent dark tan head. Smooth and silky it has no single flavor that overwhelms the palate. A creamy, rich delight that is nicely packaged, but for the clear bottle. Definitely would be great with many different foods and could stay through the evening without overstaying its welcome.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,WaltTrombone,4.5,"Oh, man, I think I'm in love! My favorite Oatmeal stout used to be Young's, but now that I've had a Sammy, I may have to change my allegiance...  The beer came in the 550 ml clear bottle, and came as part of a Samuel Smith's Beer Nut package. This kept the beer in the dark, so it didn't have a chance to get light-struck, like most Sammies. The beer poured deep black, with a big fluffy, tan head that left lots of lace on the Samuel Smith's pint glass that came in the package. I served the beer straight from my cellar, not from the fridge, so it was about 55 degrees or so.  Most of the time, I don't notice much aroma in a beer, but this brew had a nice strong aroma of sweet malt. The predominant flavors are malt and caramel, with a couple of fleeting cafe au lait and citrus notes. Some mild cola notes appear as the beer warms. The finish is a spirited discussion between the malt and oatmeal sweetness, and a mild, hoppy bitterness. Outstanding mouthfeel, creamy, almost syrup-y, definitely thicker than many other stouts.  I can see why this brew is rated so highly. It's definitely more complex than many other stouts, and would make a great introduction to someone just getting into stouts.  Cheers!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Quaffer,4.1,"Appearance: The beer was black, with some faint ruby hues around the edges when held up to the light. The head was dense and settled down quickly. It left a minimal amount of lace on the glass.  Smell: The aroma was very mild. Chocolate and cream were the dominant components, with just a little bit of coffee. There was also a bit of a bite on the nose that I couldn't put my finger on.  Mouthfeel: Terrific. Full bodied, smooth, and creamy.  Taste: This brew had a milder flavor than I remember. It started off with the taste of sweet chocolate, and then faded into a mild, bitter coffee flavor. There was not much of an aftertaste at all. Just a little bit of sourness left in the mouth.

Silky smooth in the mouth with tiny pearly bubbles. Beer tasted roasty and sweet, at times reminding me of a Butterfinger of all things! There certainly was some coffee and some indescribable yet delicious ripe fruit.  Rich, complex, and classic brew. Its less sophisticated than their Imperial Stout, but it still creates enough havoc in the mouth to keep you very, very interested. This is one of my sentimental favorites, so even if they get bought out by AB Ill still drink it!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

I think my efforts could have been better, but overall appearance was good: very dark liquid with a ""thickish"" foam which settled in nicely (forgot to check my glass prior for head maintenance). I sensed a very pleasant roasted and alcoholic quality in the smell and my tasting quickly followed. Very fine taste indeed. Full, up-front roasted flavor and great finish. Mouthfeel was also super (oatmeal-enhanced?).

113,571,the42ndtourist,4.3,"Quite good. I compared this directly with McAuslan's Oatmeal Stout, just for the hell of it (and because I had a bottle lying around). That being said, they probably represent two endmembers for the style.  Pours out black, surprisingly enough. A nice creamy tan head that doesn't want to leave and laces elaborately. The taste is very smooth... Oatmeal is present at the edges, but the main flavour is smooth black malts. Sweet and succulent. Some bitterness, but very restrained. An all around excellent stout, and worthy of it's legendary status.  Since I started with mentioning the McAuslan, I better finish that thought - the McAuslan is aggressive everywhere that Samuel Smith is relaxed and smooth.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

It pours a very dark color with a nice tan head than receded into a film that followed the beer down the glass to the last sip. Smelling it brought out some nice coffee flavors and just a little hint of the oatmeal. Tasting produced a nice sweet effect on my palette and the oatmeal was very apparent. the only thing that caught me off gaurd was the thin mouthfeel it had, it was not at all thick.

Rich aroma springs from the bottle upon opening.  Creamy soft texture. Really full flavored on a huge frame, but everything works so nicely together it is not loud. It has that berry-fruity taste that great bittersweet chocolate has. There is a mellow sweetness here, that you almost miss because it is so mellow, despite it being so obvious. I found none of the astringent/bitterness that the other reviews found. I will have to buy a case and drink until I find it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Kunsan90,4.3,"First off, this sample is one that I received in Oct-Nov 2000. Upon opening, I didn't detect any bad or strange odors, so I decided to go ahead and drink it.  It appeared black as it was being poured with a quick forming dark tan head. The head hung around for the first few drinks than settled down forming a thin ring around the edges of the glass.  Once poured, it let out of sweet, spicy smell that I found pleasing and inviting. I was unsure what to expect from the first taste, but I was pleasantly surprised. It still had a somewhat silky texture, but the flavor seemed to come fast and leave faster. I could taste roasted malts with a hint of coffee and overall it was a pleasant taste considering its age.  Carbonation seemed to hold up well, but I will have to get a fresh sample this weekend to compare it. The after taste was dry and almost non-existent, but still left a slight bitter taste on the sides of the tongue.

Texture is smooth, with late bitterness coming through on the palate, very chewy and substantial. Comes on sweet, warm, and wonderful, a comforting stout. Honestly, how do they do it? There are many who attempt this style, but no one comes close to Samuel Smith's when it comes to flavor, to taste, to utter perfection.

113,571,Todd,3.88,"550ml clear bottle.  Pours a near opaque black as midnight rich-looking beer, crowned with a frothy tan foam head; sturdy retention and a slight stick to the glass. Head remains all the way through the drinking experience. Outstanding.  Aroma is very soft and gentle on the nose with notes of earth, blackstrap molasses, nuts and some dark roasted malt astringency akin to coffee.  Firm, thick, milky smooth mouthfeel, paired with a very high dextrin sweetness and feel, that's not sickly sweet, but nonetheless ample, defining and bold. Oats are noticeable, giving the beer depth and lending a touch of starch in the flavour. A slight acrid character is lifted from the palate by the beer's prickly carbonation. Robust. More rich blackstrap molasses with undertones of coffee, unsweetened bitter dark cooking cholocate, deep earth flavours, real faint aniseed, a mark of herbal (rosemary?) and a leafy/woody character from the hops that carries over into the mouthfeel; bitty, coarse, a bit pear-like. Bit of a ""cola"" edge appears where the beer peaks and begins to fade. Mineral flavours pull out of the thickness and embed themselves in the sweet-ish / woody finish.  A meal in a bottle, this one is. A classic English stout with all of the complexities expected from much touted Old Brewery Tadcaster. Certainly not the best stout in my opinion, nor the best example of the style, but it is damn good.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

The head was beige in color, creamy and thick. The lace held up nicely and stretched to the bottom of the glass. The aroma was of molasses, chocolate, dark malt, and slight vanilla. The tastes were sweet and creamy not thick. Flavors of roasted malt, coffee, bitter hops and chocolate in the end and some what dry . Simple and yet complex all at the same time.

Leaves true lace down the glass. Resolves down to one finger-width. The brown-black color is virtually opaque, similar to the &#8220;tobacco&#8221; color on a 60&#8217;s Mercedes cabriolet.  Smell: Second in smell only to the Maclay&#8217;s Oatmalt Stout, which is smokier with whisky notes. The caramel, chocolate, cinnamon, and semi-burnt aromas blend well.  Taste: All of the elements in the nose transfer to the tongue, along with some nutmeg and allspice. There is almost a &#8220;salty&#8221; edge to the flavor that replaces the sourness present in many stouts. More chocolate than coffee. If you move it around your mouth, the chewiness lets different flavors come to the forefront with each mouthful, revealing something new. Balanced. Long finish, with no astringent or sour notes. On the malty-sweet side, but pleasantly so.  Mouthfeel: My first reaction is that this is very satiny. The carbonation is definitely present, but in the background. Body is better than many oatmeal stouts, improving upon that of the Young&#8217;s nitro-can oatmeal stout and matched in the bottle only by St. Ambroise-McAuslan.  Drinkability: An extremely smooth, easy drinking oatmeal stout. The only reason it doesn&#8217;t get a 5 is that it is so filling!  In my experience to date, nothing compares to Young&#8217;s Oatmeal Stout on draught, which ignited my love for this style. Perhaps my memory has improved upon the reality and I&#8217;m willing to bet that the McAuslan is even better on tap than it is in the bottle, making it a viable contender for the top spot. After that, I find that this and the Maclay&#8217;s Oatmalt Stout (sadly gone) are the best, bottled, oatmeal stouts I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of trying.  Backwash: The gold standard of bottled oatmeal stouts.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,cretemixer,3.98,"That deceptive clear bottle. Until you pour this stout, you would swear it was in a brown bottle, but noooo- clear as glass can be! Deep brown, almost opaque, brew with a caramel colored head that lasts and lasts. Eventually fades to a thin layer with no discernable lace. Sweet chocolate aroma and mollasses. Smooth taste, slightly bitter cocoa, coffee, malts. Thinner mouthfeel than expected, light carbonation. Overall pretty drinkable and a good introduction to the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,francisweizen,4.5,"Re-sampled on 5/12/2003. An excellent brew. This beer poured a nice dark, midnight black colour into my pint glass. It had a nice beige head that held quite well. The aromas were of barley and roasted malts. This tasted very sweet for a stout (not unlike a sweet stout) and this style is quite different to dry stouts, sweet stouts, and imperial stouts. This had a very full, creamy mouthfeel and a nice drinkability as well. A very easy-drinking stout! Cheers! -F",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ethosx19,4.3,Nice chocolate flavor and typical dark stout appearance. Low carbonation and light body (for an oatmeal stout) made it easy to drink. The price is a bit high and will keep me from drinking too many of these.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,oelergud,4.43,"A very dark beer indeed, the head is a nice brown that leaves a good lace down the glass and stays for a good while unless agitated. It smells as dark as it looks, nut and earth like scents. The taste is very much like the smell, smooth and rich with added flavors of some coffee, chocolate and of course oatmeal. Mouthfeel is full and solid. A creamy experience with plenty of chew to be had. A great beer that I will be enjoying on a regular basis.  Oelergud - Cheers!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BeerBuilder,4.08,"Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is as black as a moonless sky, with a creamy brown head. It is fruity in the nose, wih a bit roastness and chocolate as well. Creamy, smooth, with chocolate notes. It is almost like a milk shake, with a hint of chocolate. It's silky smooth to a semi-dry finish. Probably one of the best Stouts I have yet to sample. Medium bodied, with a low level of carbonation. A very well balanced beer, the bitterness is tamed down by the creamy roast maltiness.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,canoehornpoint,4.25,"Review: Cool and classy bottle (but clear). Super dark with hints of red when held to the light. Minimal head but question the quality of the glassware. This abounds with aroma, roasted malt, chocolate malt. This has a smoothe malty sweetness with a slightly locorice like aftertaste that finishes a bit twangy.  Personal notes: This is a very good quality beer and true to style. My taste tends to favor a bit more bitterness but again, the taste fits the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Amdahl,4.25,This review is from a 550 ml clear bottle that is gold rappedfor most of the neck. Pours dark with nice head and leaves good lace. Taste is chocolate with a roasted flavors. Very lightly carbonation. Full bodied. Drinking more than 2 of these is out of question.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Morris729,3.75,Pours a deep black color with a tan colored head. Aroma is of sweet roasted malts with hints of citrus. Taste is sweet caramel up front followed by a strong bitter burnt coffee taste and then a sweet buttery aftertaste. A very nice stout.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,AtrumAnimus,4.53,This is a stout among stouts. Smooth and creamy but not to heavy like the Young's Double Chocolate. It is just a damn good stout. I highly recommned this one.  The aroma is lacking unless served at about 50 degrees. The palate is very pleased with the overall texture and taste of this fine stout.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,doho95fu,3.89,"I think there are some beers that you hear so much (good) about, that once you try it you are bound to be disappointed - This beer had a bit of that. It is a great beer, but I have just heard so much, that I was let down in the flavor department.  Pours deep brown with an average head, cream in color. The consistency of the beer seemed thinner than other stouts.  Smells of chocolate, oats, nuts. Great smells.  The taste was good, but just not as BIG as I expected. It had more hops flavor than I expected as well. I didn't get hit with the oatmeal flavor like I expected.  Very drinkable stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,MJR,4.13,"Appearance: Pours a deep black body that shows off a bit of really dark garnet and brown when held up to a strong light source. A nice, creamy tan head sits on top and sticks fairly well.  Smell: I pick up on roasted grains and a touch of burnt chocolate. Not nearly as strong as some stouts in the aroma department.  Taste: Well-roasted malts and a faint chocolate sweetness is the first impression I get. A decent amount of butterscotch/diacytel too. There's a small amount of hop flavor as it rushes down my throat. I like the smooth flavor imparted by the addition of oats...adds a bit of creaminess to the flavor. Great aftertaste. There's a lot of flavor in there, but it's more of a laid-back type of flavor. It doesn't demand your attention like, say, Bell's Kalamazoo Stout. I know...different type of stout, but that one reaches out and pulls you in. This beer has a very relaxed demeanor.  Mouthfeel: I think it's a bit thin for being an oatmeal stout: I expect a huge body and a thick, chewy mouthfeel and this one falls a bit short in this area.  Drinkability: Very good. Goes down smooth and easy.  A damn good stout, but in the Samuel Smith range, I'd take an Imperial Stout or Taddy Porter over this. I find this beer to be a bit 'overrated'...",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,maxpower,4.38,"Dark brown-black color, creamy head, aroma of sweet chocolate and well roasted malts. Medium body with a creamy, silky texture.

113,571,rockdick,4.03,"I tried this one because it had such a high ranking and I was not disappointed at all. I love the creamy head and 'roasted' taste of this beer.

113,571,Winter,4.13,"Comes in a clear 12 oz bottle. The gold foil wrapped over the cap and part of the neck of the bottle is a nice touch. Pours black with a thick light brown creamy head. Aroma is sweet with scents of raisins, dark chocolate and coffee. The texture is smooth and full-bodied as it flows over the tongue. Lacks dryness of most stouts-- which isn't a bad thing. Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness with roasted malt, fruit, and slight soy taste (I also noticed this, like the previous reviewer). This is an amazing stout and a great session beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BitteBier,4.7,"Smooth black pour with substantial, foamy head that sticks around for a while and laces very nicely. Full, smooth nose highlighted by creamy roasted notes and and light chocolate. A wonderfully full flavor profile that invites my third use of the word ""smooth."" Initial sweetness reminds me of Spaten Optimator but doesn't ever fully give way to the dry crispness of alcohol. Creamy, carmely middle with a lighter version of the typical stout profile. Drink after drink, and I just can't pin down the flavors (and that ain't a bad thing). A pleasant mouthfeel and good drinkability top off this wonderful experience.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,HossMcGraw,4.88,"THIS is what it's all about! Sammy Smith's Oatmeal Stout! Do you think they'll hire me to write slogans for them? I didn't think so either. Seriously this is the best beer I have ever had in my life. (I'm only 21 but still)! Simply amazing. I could rave about this stuff for days. I've never really been one to study the smell, appearance, and mouthfeel of beers like some of the aficionados on this site, but I just can't help it with this one. From the wonderful smoky aroma from when you first pop the cap, to the beautiful tan head that never goes away, to the slow caramel-like finish, this brew is a winner all the way. It is quite expensive, but IMO is worth it. Everybody should try this beer. There is no excuse not to. Go right now to your local beer store and get some of this. And when you get to the checkout counter, tell 'em Hoss McGraw sent ya!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,aaronh,4.05,"A nice deep, dark beer that pours with a creamy looking tan head. The aromas are of chocolate, brown sugar, with maybe a hint of hops. The flavor is of roasted malt, chocolate, with a slight alcohol note that reminds me of a good bourbon. The finish has a nice bitterness that balances out the slight sweetness in the taste. Mouthfeel is good, but not as creamy as I expected. Although lower ABV than many beers I drink, the alcohol is noticable, but just slightly. Overall, a good beer, but not as good as a few others I've had lately. That being said, I would not pass up the opportunity to have another one!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,TheLongBeachBum,4.1,"Served up in a 550ml (I love these), clear glass (but not these!), bottle with quite a colorful label. Sams have an uncanny knack for presenting their beers with a very authentic look. The dark, thick looking, black beer poured with a huge brown crusty head that settled down slowly. The nose is awesome, very strong roast malts, some coffee and other Stoutish aromas. Mouth feel is medium. Lovely chocolately malts in the beginning make way for a strong malty middle, followed by quite a lingering bitter finish. Some biscuit sweetness is there, but it is far from sickly, and it serves merely to round off the pervasive burnt tastes of the roasted malts, giving an exceptionally well-rounded Oatmeal Stout. A very rich beer that can be a little too powerful at times I think, but it is designed to to sipped and not supped - so enjoy this slowly would be my advice. That said, it is a really good example of the Style, but I cant drink much of this.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,kunzbrew,4.37,Pours a nice thick head that leaves a sexy lace trail. The darkness in color is like paradise. The smell of tasted malt rules this brew. The oats are not as strong as I would have thought but still aok. The coffee toasted malt is very strong and taste even better. The rich coffee after taste does not hurt the quality either. The hops are the perfect mix for this type of stout. I am very impressed with this brew.  Cheers,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,zakery,4.87,"Appearance: Foamy beige head sits on top of a dark and luscious looking beer.  Smell: Wow! It's a heady smell of portwine, prunes, raisins, chocolate, grains - dark and sweet! When reaching almost room temperature I detect a smokiness that does not come through when it is cooler.  Taste: Follows the smell. Rich, dark, dried sweet fruit. Definite notes similar to that of portwine. Soft and smooth with subtle chocolate notes. After taste is portwine-like with coffee. It leaves a little too sweet taste in the mouth when the after tase subsides.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with medium to medium-low carbonation.  Very potent tasting and rich drink. I like to drink it slowly and savor it as a special treat all by itself.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,faubs,4.17,"Very pleasing to the palette and hearty enough to stick to the ribs at the same time. A thick beer with full bodied flavor, but surprisingly smooth! The over all is a rich hop taste with a hint of chocolate. Definitely one of my favorites.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,NeroFiddled,4.35,"Black in color and topped by a creamy dark tan head that holds well and leaves very good lace. When held to bright light ,some clear, brown highlights can be seen. The aroma offers a bright fruitiness, some light chocolate, a mild roastiness and a hint of butterscotch. The body is light-medium with a very fine, restrained carbonation that gives it a silky smooth mouthfeel. The flavor is sweetly malty with a good dose of fruitiness up front, followed by some bittersweet & dark chocolate notes as it crosses the palate, and finishing with a more noticeable bitterness, some nuttiness, and a long lasting gentle roastiness. Clearly balanced toward the sweet side. There's a mild diacetyl here that seems to pull the whole thing together. It never appears to become more than just a light butterscotch note, but it helps to round everything out so nicely - smoothing out the roastiness, and maybe even helping to keep the sweetness in check.(?) A very nice, and highly enjoyable beer, that is soft & sweet & light but also offers alot of character - allowing it to fill a variety of different roles. Highly recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,sinistersteve,3.06,"I read lots of good things about this beer and it is one of BA's top beers. Alas, I would have to disagree. The good qualities is the nice thick pour and it's dark as night, but it has that distinct English taste and aroma to it. Unfortunatly, I'm not a huge fan of it. Not that those qualites make a beer bad, just doesn't make a fan out of me.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Mick,5,Arguably todays premier stout and there is no wonder to it's popularity. Dark as midnight this one his the mouth with a take-force flavor but parts the way for a rewarding creamy sweetness that keeps inviting you back for more. A deep coffee and dark chocolate mix. Goes down as smooth as ice cream. I usually find myself having a few in a row before realizing it!,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,putnam,4.44,"A nice grey/brown satin head that crinkles up in the middle before it resolves into a splotchy, torn blanket. My id is very disappointed with the color. It wants stout to be black black black, which this isn't. This is more of a Dunkin Donuts black coffee color than a Peet's espresso. But who cares about looks? Sweet, candied, roasted oats. It smells like something you should feed a reindeer; even some fruitcake spices are lurking underneath making the whole aroma very yule. Oh yeah, nuts too. And tobacco. A cigar-chomping, gluttonous Thrasher. A perfect attack of silky malty toasted almonds, brazil nuts and millet with a shy bitterness that gives definition and cut to the finish. This is soulful stout. Don't expect big, chewy extract though. This is rowboat-mandolin-sunspeckle beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,powoo19,4.88,"I am a diehard stout drinker, but rarely find a stout that isn't slightly bitter. After a friend told me about Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout, I bought a 16 oz bottle. When I cracked it, I couldnt believe the impressive dark colour and the unreal, almost sweet smell. It poured pretty nicely with a nice head. To say that this beer is smooth is an understatement. It left no bitter aftertaste and was just completely exceptional. I am now a Sam Smith convert, and suggest you all try it for yourselves.. Happy Drinking!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94

113,571,Dogbrick,4.58,"Wow, what a great beer. Somebody had to tell me the bottle was colorless before I realized that was the color of the beer!

A magical blend of sweetness mingles with roasted malt and magnificent hops bitterness. Creamy and smooth, tickles your tastebuds as it slides down your throat.

113,571,StevieW,4.88,"As near as perfection as I have had. Pours a midnight black, with a nice fluffy beige head. The smell is sweet and strong, but not overbearing. I loved the sweet first taste and the wonderful easy smoothness of this beer. Nice thick, almost chewy feel to it. The roasted chocolate and slight bitterness toward the end, was just right. I tried this based on the beer advocates rating, and it was better than I thought it would be. Of all the beers I have had, this is the most memorable. Of the Stouts I have had I would rank them: 1. Sam Smith Oatmeal 2.Young's Double Chocolate 3. Young's Oatmeal. 4. Old Rasputin Imperial",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,jreitman,4.6,"I was skeptical that this beer could live up to it's reputation, but it truly is a wonderful stout. The color was spot on and the head nicely colored and creamy. Nice full body with a fair amount of complexity. Chocolate and roasted malt flavors mixed with flavors I could not identify. The beer finishes smooth and dry with only the slightest hint of bitterness. Overall, the best oatmeal stout I have had.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,cokes,4.03,"This one may have been victimized by the light. Why the clear bottles? Still, the impact seems to be very small...quite good anyway. Pours deep translucent ruby-black with a nice retaining pale-tan head. Milk Chocolate sweetness on the nose wit hints of roastedness. Some light stuck smells too..fortunately, not very much. Taste is chocolately and roasty. Phantoms of dried fruit in the background. Nicely hopped. Balanced well, without being dominant or submissive. Finishes on the dry side, with lingering burnt qualities and a milk-like sourness. This baby is smooth...very nice to drink.... and one could drink quite a bit of this. Especially if it is fresh. It is an elite oatmeal stout. Best in the world?...probably not.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,pbrian,4.52,"As luck would have it, my local packy just got a fresh shipment the day I noticed it was at the top of BA's Top Beers list. Giddy-up! Pours black(duh) with thin tan head. Roasty aromas with a slight Yorkshire yeast ""twang"". You can almost smell the smoothness. The stuff slips down your throat so quick you become thankfull it comes in a big-ass 550ml bottle. The contrast between sweet, smooth and silky mouthfeel and the drying bitterness of the burnt malt and hops is amazing. I haven't had this in many years but will most definately buy it again very soon.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,budgood1,4.56,"pours out an opaque murky brown colour with a huge rocky head that reduced quickly but left lots of patchy lace. aroma of dark roasted malts, ripened fruits and butter. full bodied mouthfeel is complimented by the roasted malt. incredibly silky smooth and satisfying. chocolate, caramel, toffee and some fruitiness in the taste profile, and the use of oatmeal really takes the edge off any bitterness that is present, and makes the drinkability all the better. certainly worthy of all praise and deserving of it's high rating.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,DrewS,4.7,"Had this last night and realized how good this beer is. It had been awhile since I drank this stout and decided to pick one up after seeing it sitting near the top here for some time. I should have done it sooner. I actually had a Youngs Double Chocalate Stout afterwards and this is the one that was rememberable enough to review tonight. Quick overview - Deep dark color, ruby tint when held to the light, rich, creamy tan head. Roasted malt aroma, rich and creamy taste with notes of coffee and chocolate. No decernable hop bite, and goes down smooth as silk. I will pick up some more tomorrow.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,jackndan,4.66,"Sam Smith&#8217;s Oatmeal Stout: 550 ml clear bottle, gold foil top. Rich, dense foam head stands a good inch and half over the rim of the glass. Very light aroma, with a hint of coffee with a drop of cream. Very smooth, rich creamy malt taste, with very little aftertaste. No carbonation. This is a fantastic beer, rich and creamy. This beer will definitely replace your dessert after a big meal, although a slice of tiramisu might be nice on the side. This has to be in my top five, and is highly recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Pegasus,4.65,"Appearance: This beer is a dark mahogany brown color that might as well be opaque. The tan-colored head is initially quite thick but dissipates rather quickly, with lots of sticky lace.  Aroma: The aroma is sweet, with roasted malts predominanting and a slight earthy tone.  Taste: Upon tasting, a burst of mellow roasted malt flavor is followed by dark chocolate and coffee flavors and a sweet finish.  Mouth feel: The mouth feel is smooth and creamy, though not quite as good as Young's Oatmeal Stout, for example.  Drinkability/notes: A truly exceptional beer.  Presentation: Packaged in a custom 550ml (1 pint, 2.7 ounce) brown glass bottle, sealed with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,packetknife,3.84,"This is an excellent beer. A meal itself. The smell turns me off slightly but it is quite tasty and feels good in the mouth and throat. It feels like it hits lighter than a 5% though, which is good IMO. I suggest having it without a meal, it's deserving of attention.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ADR,3.88,"Big bubbled head, softly persistent and light tan in color. Slightly less than jet black color, muted aroma. Pleasant creamy malt flavor, no hint of a hop bite. Long on mouthfeel, short on super interesting flavor. Nice beer and example of style, love the pillowy globs of foam on the pint glass, but it needs more flavor. There is that characteristic nuttiness to the profile that I find interesting and nice to note. This beer review might suffer because of a back-to-back comparison with Rogue Shakespeare.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,marc77,4.5,"The thick beige head tops the nearly black hued brew-- a hint of a deep but clear garnet color is discernable when held to light. It's appetizing in appearance. The very pleasant aroma is comprised of chocolate, butterscotch, mild roasted barley and a hint of yeast - derived fruitiness. The meager hint of Kent Goldings is dominated by the malt notes. Silky smooth mouthfeel like a good outmeal stout should have. Bittersweet in flavor from a superlative balance of residual sugars and bitterness from roasted grain and moderate hopping. The mild diacetyl combined w/ the chocolate malt flavors lends a rich, dark chocolate note. Finishes w/ sweetness on the tip of the tongue and a mellow bitterness that coats my palette. Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is the epitomy of balance. Compared to many microbrewed versions it's quite sophisticated. It's worth the extra price. I've forgotten how good this is.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,proc,4.2,"Excellent. There is such a nice balance to this stout. It has a slight sweet taste that combines with that of lightly rosted coffee with a molasses finish. Man, I sound like a food critic from a fancy restaurant just now. Ouch. I've said it before and I'll say it again...the oats make beers of this style like a meal.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Bierman9,4.03,"Black in color; nice tan head leaving a lot of lace on the glass... Coffee-toasty nose, albeit mild. Medium-body and smoothness; could be perhaps fuller? More coffee-ish tastes, with burnt, roasty flavors. Finishes with a bit of a dry, sourish taste... Decent bier, though I expected more body and roasty-malt flavor.  overall: 4.1 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  90",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,aracauna,4.13,"Doesn't have the burnt bitterness of the dry stouts, but it has the other flavors typical off a stout. I like it, but it doesn't floor me.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Bighuge,4.15,"This beer appears black and has great tan head with great retention (which I have not seen lately from a bottled beer). Beautiful cocoa/coffee aroma. The brew rolls over the tongue like velvet. Taste of coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate dominate. There's a nice bitterness here. The hops aren't distinguishable, but the bitterness is. I think the bitterness is probably more due to the roasted malts. Great Oatmeal Stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,mophie,4.66,"This is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. Beautiful black/ruby color with a lacy tan head. An initial tanginess that gives way to a deep chocolate and sweet coffee taste, finishing so smooth and creamy you feel you're in total beer bliss. Absolutely wonderful.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,bmills1608,4.11,"Pours dark black, brownish good thick head. Smells bitter, with coffee grinds, dried fruit and chocolate.  Has a full rich flavor, brown sugar sweetness in the middle mouth filling and fudge-rich.  Finishes with a slight coco bitterness . Quite complex and on the heavy side.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Thrasher,4.4,"This is a fine, fine beer. Damn near perfect but I have to fault Sam Smith for using clear glass bottles. Despite that, this sweet stout holds its flavor pretty well. Creamy beige head atop a black beer although not as dark as SS's Taddy Porter. Very sweet, an excellent dessert beer; a marked contrast to the equally pleasurable but much spicier Imperial Stout. The oatmeal is detectable but insignificant compared to the amount of sugar, which puts a nice cap on the warm malt character. The beer equivalent of coffee with cream and lots of sugar. Low in alcohol but too sweet to drink lots of.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ZAP,4.45,"1-4-05  New notes...still consider this one of the best in the world...clearly better than their Imperial Stout and Nut Brown...great stuff.. --- 3-2-02 I can not even begin to describe how spectacular this beer is. I had to go back and change (lower) my ratings of the Bell's Oatmeal because it is not in this league...not many beers are...everything about it is fantastic....great sweet scintilating aroma...black-to-very dark ruby reddish in appearance with a soft lace...sweet, creamy and smooth...delicious!!! with just a hint of hop bite on the finish...I taste the oats strong and almost a ""cream"" sweetness to it..I have yet to try the SS Imperial but it would be tough to top this...",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,mickeymac,4.03,"After years of meaning to try this stout I finally got around to it recently and am left wonder what all the fuss is about. It may be a better than average stout, but plenty of less expensive stouts are better. Considering expecations, I found the taste to be rather bland and lacking in subtlety.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,BeerAngel,4.1,"Overall pretty good. My first stout to drink, so keep that in mind when reading this. I love the look, the smell, and it has a creamy mouthfeel. I wasn't overly impressed with the taste though I still consider it to be pretty good. I will drink it again, but probably won't purchase it again anytime soon.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,ThreePistols,4.88,"Dark rich color. Nice head & lace. Roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, caramel, toffee, molasses, and oatmeal perfectly balanced. Smooth, creamy, oily, and silky. Perfect balance between the bitterness and the sweetness. Outstanding aftertaste. A must try. Cheers!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Jordan,4.6,"Another phenomenal brew by Samuel Smith. Faint notes of oatmeal, dried fruit, stronger notes of caramel and cappuccino. It's SO damn easy to drink, almost dangerous. I'm trying to take it slow, but it keeps calling my name.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,stoutman,5,Without a doubt - the best brew in the world. A perfectly balanced stout. Even if you don't like stouts this is one worth trying-you just may become a convert.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,JMH_,5,An absolutely amazing oatmeal stout. Incredibly smooth. Perfection...,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
113,571,Jason,4.6,"Presentation: 12 oz clear bottle that has gold foil on top, no freshness date to be found.  Appearance: Ink black with a wonderful light tan lace which leaves rings all the way down the glass.  Smell: Mildly acidic dark malt twang, a little earthy and some sweetness also.  Taste: Smooth as silk with a crisp full body to boot. A strong roasted malt flavour pushes everything aside ... to make way for a creamy sweetness. There seem to be an hidden earthy undertone throughout ... most likely from the Yorkshire yeast. Hop bitterness is vague yet keeps the sweetness in check. A semi dry falls on the palate as soon as the sweetness fades. Dark roasted coffee, over caramelized buttery toffee and dark sweetened chocolate flavours swirl around the tastebuds to make for a bitter sweet finish.  Notes: A cult classic among beer geeks dating back to 1980 ... lets have a moment of silence in honour of this fine brew ... if you want to jump into the world of stouts give this one a try, you might be surprised and actually love it ... I did that is for sure.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Oatmeal Stout,94
