2681,34483,SpaceCamp,4.33,"Pours a jet black that forms a moderate caramel head. Dissipates at a slower pace and leaves a good amount of soapy lacing and a nice level of retention on the top. Aromas of licorice, cherries, roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. Taste is heavy on the roasted malts, bitter chocolate, coffee, and earthy hops. Becomes sweeter towards the aftertaste with a boozy finish. Medium-bodied. A very good imperial stout that is worth a re-visit.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,BuxMontBeerLover,4.4,"Purchased at Pennridge Beverage. Perkasie. PA. $16/4pk. 12oz cans  Pours a pitch black, abyss black. A dense but quicky fading beige head on the initial pour. Leaves sticky lacing on the glass after each sip.  Aromas of roasty malts and chocolate. Very inviting.  A delicous imperial stout. Great tastes of chocolate, deep roasted malts and a definite boozy aftertaste. Very drinkable even at a 10.5% ABV.  Very smooth consistency with low to moderate carbonation. Leaves a nice coating in your mouth after each sip.  Overall a top-notch stout. Highly recommended...cheers!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Griffin2,4.04,"Poured from a 12 oz can dated 10/12/2022 into a snifter glass. L - Pours a dark brown color with a nice tan head that dissipates slowly. S - Smells of chocolate and coffee. T - Taste follows the smell, lots of bitter coffee and bakers chocolate with some booziness on the finish. F - Medium to full bodied and lightly carbonated. O - Tasty boozy stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,DarkLordScott,4.02,"Pours black with a fluffy, sculpted three finger head that lasts and coats the glass with foam. Aroma is roasted black malt. There is a resemblance of coffee as well. Taste is roasted malt, with a touch of sweetness, as if it were similar to a milk stout. However, the black malt is the over-arching profile here. Along with it comes a feeling of bubbles on the tongue at the end of the profile.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BitteNochEinWeissbier,4.18,"12 oz Can Canned On Date: 26 Nov, 2018 Consumed on: 25 Dec, 2022 Glass: Tulip Snifter ABV: 10.5% Serving Temp: room temp   Look: Black with a 2-finger high brown head. The head dissipates to a thick ring and cover. Lacing is very good.  Smell: Deep and dark roasted malts. Bittersweet chocolate and some faint coffee. Light licorice/anise and a hint of molasses. Earthy and somewhat spicy hops.  Taste: An earthy hop bitterness starts things off but is quickly met and balanced by the substantial roasted dark malt notes. Coffee and chocolate (first bittersweet but quickly changing to semisweet) are noticeable. A mild sweetness appears that is a combo of semisweet chocolate, molasses, and faint dark fruits. A quick hit of earth comes back and lingers in through the finish. The sip finishes a shade dry.  Feel: Creamy, velvety and viscous. There is a nice warmth from the alcohol. The body is between medium and medium-full (though closer to medium)  Overall: A very nice imperial stout that makes a great winter warmer and fireplace sipper. Nice balance and even complexity.  The 4 years of age have had a wonderful effect on this brew. If I recall it when fresh (it has been a couple of years), it was quite bitter and even one note (maybe two notes). Now it is superb. I wonder how it would be at 5 years?  I also wonder if the IBUs have been reduced in more recent versions. I recall either 75 or 95 IBUs for Ten-Fidy, and as I mentioned the brew seemed very bitter to me when fresh a few years ago. OB currently lists the IBUs as 65.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MadMadMike,4.25,"2022 version - 12 oz can into a snifter at 50°. Big tight brown head forms over the dense dark elixir. Smell is stone fruit, cacao, anise, coffee, dark roast malt. Taste is the same as the nose, but somehow it seems the flavor profile changed from previous cannings. It’s lacking ‘ fullness’ and anticipated bitterness. Feel for this batch is less oily and thinner, uptight carbonation. Overall, an American Stout classic that’s always a treat.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JonnoWillsteed,3.1,"Reviewed near blind... all I know whilst making these notes is it's American and high ABV%. L- Pours jet black, with an impressive 3Cm notably very dark tan head. The head lingers for 10mins (as I was then distracted), now down to about 3mm + heavy lacing which is a heck of an achievement for this ABV% of beer where the surface-tension usually zaps the head super quickly. S- Whiskey, treacle + timber barrel. T- Molasses/black treacle, super deeply intense/pungent, notable whiskey, then up it comes a solid ABV% zing - bam! F- Rich but not outright sweet. It's super-pungently flavoured, so much so it's a reeeal slow-sipping beer, just waaay too intense to sup as usual. Be aware if drinking on a hot night that the beer might materially warm in the glass before you can enjoy it all. O- I'm often in a quandry to know how to rate beers like this. No doubt it's BIG, but subtlety and balance are harder to achieve IME and a nobler achievement, and a high ABV% CAN achieve that. It has a *very* shouty ABV%; and 12.5% isn't even that high (try visiting Iceland for properly high ABV% beer hehe) ... usually not considered good brewing if the ABV% is whacking your palate, albeit from a liquor barrel aged beer. Would I drink it again, no thanks it's way too big a shouty statement; I've had far higher ABV% beers than this that have achieved subtlety and balance. 355ml can.

2681,34483,Perioddicals,4.2,"L - Poured from a can into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass. Huge frothy two and a half finger chocolate head on aggressive pour. Lots of lacing. Dark opaque color  S - Scent was a chocolate, malt, roast, and caramel. So many great smell. Sweet. A little boozy.  T - Taste follows scent. Dark Chocolate and bitter chocolate. Roasty. Sweetness in there as well. Some dark fruits as you drink. Toward the end, the coffee notes are more present, which I don't prefer.  F - Great carbonation and frothiness. Enjoyable mouthfeel.  O - Overall this is a great beer, but as with other beers with coffee flavors, I’m not a fan, since I don’t like coffee. Despite that fact, this was still a good beer for me. I’m glad I tried it, and I would definitely recommend it to any coffee fans.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TheBricenator,4.27,"Look: Jet black on the pour and in the glass and even my delicate pour prompts a huge light brown head to explode and pillow up, eventually relenting some and leaving awesome lacing behind Aroma: Roast, dark chocolate, ethanol, roasted barley, bready notes, earthy hops, and blackstrap molasses Taste: Brown bread, baking cocoa, and roast jump out and tailed by wafts of alcohol heat which all hold for a second before earthy and slightly spicy hops come out to play. A little molasses and light brown sugar wafts are noticed in the background and closes with roast, chocolate, and booze along with a big bite Mouthfeel: Full, somewhat silky, medium-high carbonation, and a very dry and robust finish Overall: I dig it. This beer is big and means business and you can tell both of those things right away. I hadn’t had this in years and it was like I remembered in that it’s a hoppy and big Imperial Stout that flexes its muscle throughout and is a well-made and good one as well. A must-try for Imperial Stout/Russian Imperial Stout fans and I’m glad that its cold outside as this one is definitely a belly warmer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,dano213,4.29,"12oz can purchased off the shelf as part of a 4-pack. Canned 9/25/21, so this beer is almost 4 months old. I had this in the fridge and allowed it to come up to room temperature before I cracked it open.  Look: Pours out a very dark almost black color. There was a thick, rocky brown/dark tan colored head that slowly reduced to a thin layer, leaving behind some nice looking lacing.  Smell: Smells nice. Intense dark chocolate, coffee, sweet notes of marzipan and vanilla and some booze. There are also secondary notes of dark fruits. It has a nice roasty aroma.  Taste: Interesting. Up front, it is very dark and roasty and there are also some sweet pastry type notes (think brownies and chocolate cake). The finish lingers long and is more bitter than I expected - lots of roasted malt and there is a strong charcoal flavor on the finish. I think that there is a lot of bitterness and some oiliness from hops that is coming out in the finish. This beer definitely does not taste like it's 10.5% ABV, although I do get some warming in my chest as I consume more of it.  Feel: The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and has a very interesting finish. I would say that it is a bit thin for what I was hoping for.  Overall: I haven't had this beer in years. My old roommate and I used to split cases of this beer. It's definitely one of the quintessential American imperial stouts, and its availability has stood the test of time. I guess that my main criticism is that it doesn't taste as complex as some other great imperial stouts that I have had. Perhaps it would benefit from aging?",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,LesDewitt4beer,4.43,"Scrappy notes from 2018. 6 pack purchased at Super One Liquor in Duluth, MN. An incredibly firm and deep stout. It is boozy, firm tannins, very dark with a dark tan head, roasty toasty, dark bitter chocolate and molasses. It has a lot of staying power on the palate and is staining.

2681,34483,BeerdrinkerJon,4.77,"One sip propelled this Imperial Stout into my top 3! I didn’t have to evaluate it. That’s a good sign. Seeing how dark it was, I expected it to be thick-n-chewy, sweet, and have a lot of alcohol burn. Holy shit!…It had more balance than an olympic gymnast and an exceptional roasted malt complexity which carried throughout the finish. I avoid canned beer at all costs, but I really wanted to try this one so I took a chance on it. Poured into a stout glass and cooled just long enough, I indulged. I expected the typical regret of a curiosity purchase, but instead I was thrilled at the discovery of a new favorite! Although I was amused by the name of this beer, it actually detracts from this seriously well crafted Imperial Stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,leaddog,4.49,"1800th review!  Appearance - Pours a dark jet black with two fingers of frothy mocha tan head.  Smell - earthy, leafy, and floral hops, coffee bean, roasted malts, dark fruits (raisin and fig), cocoa, and earthy yeast.  Taste - earthy, leafy, and floral hops upfront. Then quickly goes into the bold coffee bean, cocoa, roasted malts, and dark fruits (raisin and fig). The earthy yeast rounds out the brew.  Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes velvety smooth with the bold coffee bean and cocoa with a nice lingering alcohol warmth.  Overall - A stellar imperial stout that has been on my radar for quite some time. If you come across this don't leave your local liquor store without a can or two. A pleasant sipper.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JohnniEMc,4.47,"This shouldn't take more than a twelve ounce can poured out and into a clear glass Imperial pint mug. It's expresso black-brown with a tidy tan head that is lasting. There's a strong aroma of roasted malt which is influenced noticeably by oak tannins. The taste is incredibly rich and complex. There's roasted malt, tannins, hops, alcohol and even some chocolate. The body is amazingly rich and smooth, especially considering all that it's delivering. There is sufficient glass lacing to bear witness to the quality of this brew's body. This may be a little too much for those that like a less whiskey influenced ale, even though the tannins are pretty well balanced by the other tastes. The ABV is high and somewhat noticeable, so that may also put off some. Overall, this is an obviously great example of brewing craftsmanship. But when you go this boldly, not all will follow.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Rapscullion,4.7,"Pours opaque jet black with a thin but persistent tan rim.  Heady nose of malt, molasses, pumpernickel and black figs.  Palate is massive. First taste is a big bitter hit.beer swiftly envoloped by roasted malt, dark chocolate, espresso, caramel, with fruity fig and plum notes. Some sweetness but the bitterness lingers right through the long finish.  Very full bodied with minimal carbonation, unctuous mouthfeel, lovely lingering bitterness, lot of warm alchohol. Beautiful savoury beer.  This beer ages really well. Mellows some of the alchohol heat and the flavor marry wonderfully.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,blazerkor,4.71,It smells sweet with malts and a lot of bourbon. That's really all that I'm getting.  The taste is like bready bourbon up front and then you get a rich coffee bitterness.  The stout coffee flavor and the sweet woody bourbon complement each other beautifully and provide for a balanced taste.  This beer is full bodied and smooth with just a subtle carbonation that gives it an even thicker feel. The finish is clean with alcohol and coffee.  Overall this one is pretty damn fantastic. So balanced and the mouthfeel is great. I'm giving it a 5.8 out of 6... so good!,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Sigmund,4.19,"355 ml can, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.5%. Pitch black colour, moderate chocolate brown head. Nice aroma of roasted malts / roasted barley, chocolate, coffee and bakery. Intense flavour of malts (malty sweetness + heavily roasted malts/barley), notes of strong coffee, molasses and dark bitter chocolate, ending in a distinct bitterness (both from the hops - 98 IBU - and the roastiness). Possibly the most awesome canned beer in the world.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

I would *mostly* agree, but am left wishing this brew was 0.5% higher so I could comfortably age it a year+ to see if my complaint is resolved. I am usually one who enjoys the booze heat or mouthfeel kicker, but I have long associated that with a trade-off for a complex taste profile that reveals something new within the style, or a particular niche. or, whatever - party. this stout is one of the greats, and I may have my checklist, but this thing rules 7 days a week.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Very rich milk chocolate, caramel malts without much roast, and coffee  Quite the sweet alcohol heat immediately starting the sip with notes of brown sugar to snooth it out before moving into a massively sweet but balanced chocolate with hints of vanilla and coffee  This is a full bodied beer with moderate carbonation that makes it go down quicker than it should for the abv, damn smooth  Just as amazing as the BA version and a little less caustic and in-your-face.

Tastes were quite different 2014 had distinct and complex dark fruit, molasses, chocolate, leather flavours; 2019 smooth chocolate malt, caramel, coffee with a bit of pleasant bitterness on the swallow - both had a bit of booziness but felt more definite on aged can, but in good way.

2681,34483,Donald_Loveland,4.1,"Canned: 08/06/2018 Poured: 1/26/2020  A: A deep dark black beer with a nice caramel head. A modest pour gives roughly a finger of head that quickly dissipates leaving a very light lacing.  S: It is hard to initially determine whether the smell is bitter or sweet when first poured . The aroma is pleasant, leaving some notes of toffee, caramel, and chocolate. It did open up a bit more once warmer, but nothing too significant.  T: I am initially hit with a toasted graham cracker flavor, probably coming from the malt, that morphs into a slightly bitter coffee aftertaste. I also get a very light dried fruit near the back. While the flavor is tame and doesn’t display a ton of complexity, it feels soothing after a long cold day. It is clearly well balanced with out being too bitter or too sweet.  M: The consistency is something that really helps bring this beer up a few levels for me. While some stouts of similar quality can feel thin, this beer has a solid medium body without being too syrupy.  O: This is a solid, easy drinking stout that I know is always reliable. While clearly less complex than some of the bigger imperial stouts, its perfect for a random weekday afternoon. You should always keep one or two around for a rainy day when you don’t want to crack into the good stuff.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Taste/Feel: The taste is superbly rich, with hearty bitter chocolate and dark fruits supported by the smooth body. The full bodied brew is silky smooth and is rich with coffee, vanilla, dark fruit, molasses, biscuit, burlap, tobacco, and big earthy hops.

Not much retention or lacing. Smell is a little muted-faint coffee and chocolate-maybe just a hint of alcohol. Taste is pretty bold and evenly coffee and chocolate. Not much of an alcohol taste giving the abv. Mouthfeel is very smooth with a bitter aftertaste and slight amount of alcohol. Overall a very nice IS. Price is a little high ($16/4 pk) so Narwhal or Expedition may be a better substitute.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,EnderFett11,4.24,"Poured moderately hard from a can into a snifter glass, eventually filling the remainder, ~3 fingers, with brownish head. Nearly black, opaque color. Smell is a wonderful and strong sweet roasted malt. Taste is similar, with flavors of malt, caramel, a bit of chocolate, and some roastiness that comes through stronger as it warms. Medium bodied with light/medium carbonation. Excellent stout, especially if you like strong malt flavors.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,b11,4.21,"The reason I'm enjoying this is that it is not viscous, it is not syrupy, it is not overly sweet. Pleasing scent of vanilla, less so of chocolate. Solid bitterness, burnt, which is the dominant taste. Nicely carbonated, just enough. Seriously dark color. I'd suggest you not drink this too cold, let it warm up a bit,",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Mouthfeel: pleasantly thick  Taste: rich, roasted malt with a subtle, pleasant sweetness, some coffee, hop balance, alcohol present but not overwhelming, a hint of licorice  What terrific balance in this special ale, as neither the 98 IBU’s nor the 10.5 ABV dominate, making this a wonderful, filling sipper.

Aggressive pour resulted in two finger dark tan head, which recedes but stays around as a thick cap. Leaves behind some scattered medium sized spots of lacing. Aroma is dark roasted malts, caramel, and chocolate. No coffee. Taste is a mellow mixture of dark roasted malts, caramel, and chocolate. A touch of coffee is tasted at the very end. Thicker mouth feel, and coating. No felt carbonation but it is there as supportive. Even at its advanced age in the can, the tasting experience is excellent. Not bitter and hides the higher ABV%.

Strong smell of coffee, baked chocolate, dried fruits and milk chocolate. These fill the taste. Big taste of sweet and roasted malt, semi-sweet and high on bitterness. Rich and smooth malty middle with a mild astringency, caramel and baked brown sugar are pushed along by the hidden carbonation. The finish is neutral and malty rich, balanced so well with hops and roasted malt bitterness. All flavors mentioned are present during a lingering aftertaste. Full bodied with carbonation in reserve, pours like warm motor oil. Smooth easy sipper. Outstanding balance between bitter and sweet, alcohol is fiendishly disguised. A sipper that can be quaffed, be careful with this one.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Has an above average body with a slight thick creamy feel Aroma isn't overpowering but it is mostly black coffee, roasted coffee beans, roasted malt, and some milk and dark chocolate Taste is much more powerful than aroma with bitter black coffee being forward.

The head recedes to a quarter inch cap and the lacing is complete and spectacular. The aroma is earthy chocolate and roast malt. The taste is semisweet roasty, ashy, bitter chocolate with hints of caramel. The mouthfeel is full bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a semi dry finish. Overall, outstanding.

They do well to limit the molasses from overwhelming the beer while letting the subtle flavors of vanilla, chocolate, dark fruit, and hints of coffee to come to the forefront.

2681,34483,DoghouseReilly3946,4.28,"Date: Canned on 08/22/18, enjoyed on 12/10/18.  Appearance: Pours out completely black, creating a finger and a half of tan head. The lacing on the glass as I swirl is something to see.  Aroma: Dark well roasted, near charred malts, loads of green hops, roasted coffee, higher cacao percent dark chocolate, molasses, graham cracker, oak, raisin, and a little vanilla.  Taste: Vanilla, dark chocolate, and a good amount of dark fruit juice hits first, followed by malts that taste more charred than they smelled. The end is a mix of thick and rich mouth coating molasses and a lingering oak bitterness. This is somewhat reminiscent of Deschutes The Abyss in its mixture of dark fruit and oak flavors. The hops work very well here to balance out the sweet qualties much as they do in North Coast's Old Rasputin. The mouthfeel is full and coats the palate, also there is some heat here but it isn't anythin that detracts. The beer gods be praised, for we have here a highly rated malt driven near masterpiece that isn't a damn pastry stout! While I don't think it's as good as Old Rasputin of Expedition Stout, it is a great beer for those snowy afternoons when you arrive at the realization that its bone chillingly cold and there is another three months of winter to slog through.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Chocolate, dark rum, burnt caramel on the nose. Tastes like a pure dark chocolate bar with roasted coffee nibs in it. A pleasant building heat in the finish, very dry, and some lingering espresso bitterness. The notes of rum remain as well, and cassis. The best part - sweetness is subdued, acting as a touch of balance. This feels like the definition of roasted malts. Light carbonation and medium-heavy body, with a creaminess like a chocolate bar was actually melted in it.  This is intense, but unlike the other high ABV stouts I've had recently, not overwhelming in any way. The balance of flavours is spot on. And most importantly, not doused with sugar.

I remember the first time I tried it about 4 years ago it was amazing and became my favorite dark brew. It used to be so smooth and that deep double fudge cookie flavor was there. Lately it just taste metallic and awfully bitter, skunky maybe? Did they change brew masters? I live in Austin TX where Oskar Blues opened a location, could it be they’re brewing it here under a different brew master? If so it explains the drastic change in quality, I hope someone can provide me an update on this.

A smell of chocolatey malt rises up but the roasted smell seems to clash with hops, smothering out their stench. The taste greatly personifies this, covering up the bite with an obviously dominate malt character. Still, this one seems to put the ""imperial"" in imperial stout. A nice, heavy drinker with a medium-heavy, residual, almost sticky/oily feel on the back of the tongue and the throat. The head settles in a few minutes time, leaving but a little carbonation. Overall a great beer by a great company.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Lahey,4.51,"This is a solid imperial stout. Coffee and chocolate flavor. Somewhat of a metallic taste, but not enough to ruin anything. The smell is divine. I'm enjoying this on tap, but the price for a 4 pack of 12 oz cans has driven me away. Even though it's enjoyable on tap i won't pay the canned price.  Edit: having a draft of a 2014 barrel. There's a lot more raisin flavor, the beer is smoother. Any off flavor is eliminated. Totally worth the wait for this bar owner. It made me raise my rating on this beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,hopsputin,4.33,"A: solid, midnight black color. No light shining through at all. Real nice dark tan .5 finger head  S: Deep dark chocolate, roast malt, milk chocolate , some soy sauce. There is some lactose sweetness in the aroma as well  T: silky milk chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, toffee, dates, soy sauce, cola, brown sugar. There is a touch of bitterness from the roast malt, which is good because it balances out some of the sweetness. Also, some bitterness from the roast malt. Very luscious taste  M: heavy, super silky mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Definitely a sipper  O: fantastic stout. It’s heavy, rich, and silky smooth. Sip on this and enjoy!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JBowenGeorgia,4.54,"Pours black with a surprisingly large dark tan head that took 5 minutes or so to settle into a splotchy cap. Smells dark, roasty, getting more dark fruit than coffee and chocolate. Taste follows, a touch on the bitter side with the dark fruit, burnt malt, some dark coffee notes as well. Pretty dry finish. Feel is thick, a bit chewy with a good carbonation level. Overall a very tasty stout, enjoying this one and looking forward to the BA version.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,Sak3,4.28,"Look: The body of this beer is a deep black and there is a very tan off white head to it. It's taken a while for the head to simmer down. Smell: A lot of liquor, with roasted chocolate following the alcohol. Taste: A lot of liquor and a nice coffee finish to it. Feeling: If you can understand the theme of things... A lot of liquor with a nice kick to it. Overall: This is a good beer with I believe to be just too much of an alcohol percent to enjoy the other attributes to this beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,FLima,4.28,"Petroleum color that verted like motor oil with a huge and thick dark caramel head with great retention and leaving good laces. Nice aroma with notes of cocoa, vanilla, dark chocolate, a bit of smoke, licorice, pine, some roasted coffee beans and plums. Flavor with notes of cocoa, spices, pine, grapefruit citrusy, lactic acid, oats, licorice, figs, raisins, molasses, drops of bourbon, Port Wine and prunes. Dry and bitter aftertaste. Its 65 IBUs are enough to balance its robust body. Full oily body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 10.5% abv is superbly well hidden. Excellent Imperial Stout with great complexity and perfect execution. More chocolatey than coffee and once it warmed up revealed lots of dark fruit notes as well. Despite its 65 IBUs it is not very hoppy, though this exemplar has been cellared for several months. Definitely a sipper. Worth trying and revisiting given its great cost benefit ratio.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,AZBeerDude72,4,"Pours a deep black with rich tan head and sticky lacing. Smells of toasted malt/sugar, chocolate, oat, and light coffee. The taste is good but a little hindered by the ABV, wishing the coffee was stronger and other notes more pronounced. I am getting a burnt oat/malt, lots of alcohol, bourbon and smokey notes. the finish is lingering burnt taste with mild alcohol. Overall a medium to heavy beer, I think some more coffee up front and blending could make this better but compared to others in the class I am sort of bummed.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,Lamar,4.93,"A wonderful Stout; sampled at a tasting in Washington, DC. Rich and so full of flavor; it's 10,5% ABV should cause this beer to age wonderfully well.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Holderness,4.33,"Canned 18 days ago so this stuff is fresher than ideal, but I'll take it  L — 1,000 lumens passed through the glass reveals an incredibly dark black body. It is so dark, in fact, that there aren’t even the faintest traces of light coming through the edges of the glass. Definitely up there with Speedway Stout and KBS for darkest beer I’ve had. 3-finger light brown head produced with moderately aerated pour. Amazing retention and lacing S — Pleasantly warming spiced chocolate, barley malts, molasses, bourbon, candied dark fruits, fruity yeast esters, hazelnut, and toffee T — Starts with a molasses sweetness, immediately followed by an explosion of charred barley malt, french roast coffee, bittersweet chocolate, bourbon, and burnt sugar. A real smack-you-in-the-face kind of beer F — This one plays tricks on you. At first it seems to be oily and slick, with minimal carbonation and practically no velvety or silky qualities. But after each sip there is a sudden sensation of fine pulpiness across the palate, at which point the flavors become most apparent. Long, sticky finish. Huge mouthfeel O — Damn this stuff is awesome, especially in a can!? It’s widely available but only for a limited time each year, so if you see it, buy a 6er! And then have 1 can every 2 months throughout the year  87/100",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,andrewh995,4.54,"Pours a very dark black with one of the darkest brown heads I’ve ever seen. Smells of deeply roasted malts, chocolate, roasted coffee, and burnt caramel. Tastes of roasted malts, dark bittersweet chocolate, espresso, booze, molasses, and dark fruits. Heavy creamy body and medium-light carbonation. Overall this is easily one of the best widely available and affordable stouts I’ve ever had. Actually you know what, it is the best affordable imperial stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Mindcrime1000,4.43,"Poured from a single-serve CAN into a stout glass.  Pours---absolutely motor-oil black. Thick, viscous, and everything a stout should be. The head is perhaps the darkest tan with mottled dark brown I've ever seen, and it's sticky, foamy, and has excellent staying power considering the ABV. The foamy lacing endures throughout the drink. I don't give ""5"" ratings on any point lightly--this is a winner.  The aroma is a full-on assault of complexity and power. Malts very forward, manifesting mostly in dark fruit, as opposed to coffee and chocolate, though they are present as well. Smoke and burnt sugar join the party, with the hops dancing in the background. Just a hint of booze completes it.  The flavor follows the look and the nose. Dark fruits (black cherry, fig and raisin), burnt sugars, blackstrap, smoke, and espresso coffee with hops arriving at the finish to balance the party. Perhaps a bit heavy-handed on the bitter notes, but that's more a matter of personal preference than criticism.  The mouthfeel is outstanding. Thick, chewy and heavy, yet the strong carbonation and hops provide a crisp finish.  This is a top-notch RIS. A must try.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,BJB13,4.11,"12 oz. can poured into a snifter.  A one and a half inch thick puck of medium brown dense foam settles over a thick black body that pours a dark oily brown. Heavy lacing and alcohol legs slide down the glass with each tilt.  The nose isn't as robust as I would have liked but the cocoa, roasted malt, dark fruit and slight hop aromas are nice. Tastes of coffee, sweet raisin and prune and a hint of sticky sweet chewing tobacco. It is mostly malty but the hop bitterness is there. The finish is fairly quick with some heat and a semi-sweet tang. While I mentioned sweet several times it isn't overly sweet and is definitely flavored like a RIS. The carbonation is low adding to the creamy smoothness of the full body.  A good RIS, one that I will certainly revisit this winter.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Jtee,4.79,"From a 355ml can served at 13 degrees Celsius into a snifter. Canned on: 10.05.2016 which makes this more than a year old.  Look: The beer pours out like oil – gorgeous, I'm salivating just looking at it. An opaque black with 4cm of dense, dark brown head that settles into a cap after 4-ish minutes. Very impressive head for such a strong beer. Great lacing too!  Smell: Strong and surprisingly well-balanced aroma for an imperial stout. Rich and complex with notes of roasted malts, dark chocolate, tobacco, licorice, molasses, caramel, and some dark fruit. Holy smokes there's a lot going on in the nose.  Taste: Bam! Strong and balances towards bitter. Same tasting notes as the aroma. Damn special and a treat to drink. The finish is long, strong, and bitter.  Feel: Full body with moderate carbonation. Deliciously thick, slick, and chewy with restrained alcohol warmth. Faint astringency. Mind-blowing presence on the palate.  Overall: Big, behemoth of a beer. I love the style and this is among my absolutely favourites. World class and a must try.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Rufus1,4.75,"Poured medium hard into an imperial gravity pint glass the same temperature as the beer. Appears like oily black magic. Two fingers of firm long lasting mocha head. Dense sticky lacing that coats the entire inside of the glass half way through. Some legs on this one. The smell is of deep dark chocolate malts with big expresso coffee. Dark fruits. Molasses. Rich fudge. Tart alcohol.  Wow!!! A massive assault on the tongue with an all in one punch of dark chocolate malts, heavy creamy cocoa, some smokey chocolate. Add lush creamy coffee and dark fruits along with faint molasses. Boozy yet still chewy and silky on the palate. Just a hint of bitter hops remain. It definitely follows the nose with its full bodied and just right carbonation.  This is a huge stout meant to be enjoyed in sips rather that gulps. In my opinion one of the finest imperials in the world. Would have given fives all around but nothing is perfect. Enjoy! Cheers!!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,craigbelly,4.53,Pours into my glass looking like motor oil far past it's change by date.

2681,34483,Lone_Freighter,3.99,"It poured jet black yielding the same color body and left a brown one and a half inch foamy head. It settled down to a half inch after about a minute leaving some awesome lacing coating the sides of the pint glass. Some of the lacing formed rings after several sips. The smell was extremely boozy yet lets a bit of malt and chocolate come out as the beer warmed. The taste was sweet with the alcohol coming out very strong in the taste. The palate is about a medium to heavy, probably due to the ABV in this beast. There is nothing harsh on the tongue. Drinkable, no way, one and done due to the booziness. Overall, pretty good RIS that I come back to every now and again, preferably in the Winter.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,CochonKing,4.98,"Sent to me from a friend with access to all of the Colorado stouts I wish I had access to on the east coast. Probably one of the best trades I've ever made.  Look - Pours a beautiful deep molasses brown, Heavy head with dark brown edging that sticks to the beer beautifully and doesn't fade.  Smell - Malt leads the pack. Nice chocolate and coffee notes. Burnt sugar and caramel as well. Alcohol blows a lot of this back but if you give it a second it really opens up.  Taste- Phenomenal. Well balanced malt followed by strong chocolate notes, molasses and burnt sugar on the palate as well. I would love to taste this beer after it has sat in a barrel.  Feel - Full bodied with small bubbles Just effervescent enough to calm the beer down but beautiful none the less.  Overall - Amazing",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,PDXAmbassador,4.56,"A classic velvety thick and pleasantly sweet imperial stout that's certainly improved by barrel aging, but it's pretty darn good in its own right as an easily-attainable (if, albeit slightly overpriced) non-BA shelfy stout in a can.

I've had a few over the time, and here's my thoughts. Pours like death itself. Motor oil with a thick luscious head that has staying power and coats the glass. Nose is a bit milder than expected with rounded coffee, black licorice, and burnt sugars. Taste hit initially like it will be smooth and a touch sweet with lots of coffee and cocoa. Sadly, it quickly turns astringent and acrid. I wanted to love this beer, but the flavor just isn't that great. Mouthfeel is exceptional. Overall, what this beer does well is does magnificently, but the taste doesn't hold up.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Could be at least 2 1/2 -3 fingers ! One of the prettiest pours in all my days of drinking RIP. What makes this so speacial is how balanced this one is. Many RIP are super boozy and remain boozy from start to finish. This one is amazingly well balanced. Big fan !!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Taste - Like the aroma only stronger. Gigantic roasted malt body, bittersweet dark chocolate, alcohol is noticeable but this is such a big beer that it fits right in, bitterness towards the end but no hop flavors I can pick up, aftertaste lasts into oblivion with burnt brownie edges and charred malts.  Feel - Full bodied, chewy, very slick and oily on the palate, good amount of alcohol warmth.  Overall - This is a huge beer. Not very complex, but it will cure a stout craving in no time.

Aroma: Roasty coffee, rich dark chocolate and light char with hints of molasses and licorice.  Taste: Roasted malts, molasses and dark fruit plum and raisins to start, followed by rich dark chocolate, roasty coffee, caramel and a light char. Finish is lightly bitter.

Smells of burnt toast, rich dark chocolate, and sweet caramel with a hint of roasted coffee. Taste follows with a noticeable alcohol presence, and the sweet caramel covered dark chocolate it easily dominated by the roasty qualities. Fell in a bit harsh for me... A little intense on the carbonation and alcohol warmth. Overall, this is an outstanding imperial stout, but not my go to.

2681,34483,CanadianBacon,4.33,"Appearance - poured into a tulip, this is the stuff heaven is made of. It pours the deepest of blacks with no visible carbonation! The head is an extremely fluffy 3 plus fingers of milk chocolate brown. This is exactly what an imperial stout should look like.  Aroma - both milk and dark chocolate are present in the nose along with sweet caramel, on the back end I get rich coffee beans.  Taste - its pretty boozy up front but still remains really smooth. The coffees bitterness is also prevailent but in a really good way there is a caramel sweetness behind it and as well as a rich dark chocolate.  Feel - this beer is on the heavier side of medium bodied with very little carbonation feel at all. There is a boozyness on the back end and a slight burn from the booze but nothing intolorable.  Overall - This is exactly what an imperial stout should be. Its strong yet smooth the flavors are rich and bitter but not overwhelming. I just wish it was slightly cheaper and more widely available north of the border! Cheers",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,LiquidAmber,4.56,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours pitch black with a great one finger dark mocha head with good retention and lots of lacing. Looks nice. Aroma of slightly sweet dark toasted malt, milk and dark chocolate, coffee and hint of booziness. Flavor is semi-sweet dark toasted malt with moderate char, dark chocolate, latte coffee, molasses; finishes with deep chocolate malt and modest hop bitterness. Excellent creamy body and mouth feel. One of the classic American stouts, rich and malty as would be expected from the Russian imperial stout style. The chocolate flavors are realistic and flavorful and the coffee is amazingly close to a stout with actual added brewed coffee. A triumph, and one that is relatively easy to find. I've drunk this for years as one of my top 5 stouts and can't believe I haven't reviewed it here. From my experience, this one ages well and gracefully.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SaltofOH,3.97,"Can dated 9/14/16. Guinness pint.  A: pours opaque black/brown with three fingers of thick, foamy, medium tan head. Otherworldly lacing and excellent retention. This one is a real beaut.  S: licorice; salt; dried malt; mild roastiness and some faint hops.  T: just had a barrel aged, so this tastes mild by comparison, but tastes right for an RIS. Lightly sweet and fully malty arrival. Some roast bitterness on that Initial arrival, too. A little sweetness on mid palate, but it is subdued; more direct dark roasted malt. Toward the finish I pick up the licorice I got on the nose, then a really pleasant and full bitterness. Very hoppy ending, I like. Roast lingers. Some warming alcohol, but noticeably less than many RIS's, some with lower ABV.  M: full bodied and slick; less carbonation than others I've had recently; on the lower end of the spectrum for the style.  O: it is what it is cracked up to be- standard bearer for the style. Right up there with old Rasputin. Not braking boundaries, but taking what is now an established style and killing it.

2681,34483,thehyperduck,4.57,"12 oz can purchased at the LCBO; canned 10/05/2017 and served just below cellar temperature.  Pours as black as a moonless, clear night sky, crowned with just over a finger's worth of foamy, brown-coloured head. It melts away at a near-infinitesimal pace, resulting in a dense, creamy cap about a quarter-inch high, as well as a full coat of gorgeous lacing. On the nose, I'm getting lots of blackstrap molasses and caramelized sugar, in addition to roasted malt notes of rich chocolate, tobacco, espresso and charred wood. Hints of herbal hops, licorice root, vanilla and alcohol, with suggestions of prune and oatmeal.  Now THIS is an imperial stout - it doesn't hold anything back; subtlety is beneath this beer. Molasses, prune/plum and roasted malt flavours come through at first, with decadent dark chocolate and espresso notes. Aggressively bitter on the back end, with herbal, leafy, somewhat earthy hops, together with hints of licorice, burnt grain, vanilla and coffee grounds. Flavourful, bittersweet finish; the potent ethanol content warms the palate and esophagus, and also has a numbing effect on the tongue, while still managing to integrate with the roasted malts beautifully. Luxuriously full-bodied, with soft carbonation and a thick, viscous, silky-smooth texture that makes this imperial stout far more drinkable than it has any right to be.  Final Grade: 4.57, a rare A+. Ten FIDY has been the subject of rave reviews for more than a decade, receiving accolades that go back to when I was but a fledgling BA. I never dreamed I'd see it in Ontario, but *hot damn* am I glad that I've finally had a chance to try this utterly fantastic Russian imperial stout. While well-established, highly lauded beer labels like this one don't always live up to the hype, this is one case where the hype is totally justified - I would be hard-pressed to come up with suggestions for improvement, because it's basically perfect as-is. An absolute must-try for anyone who has ever enjoyed a strong stout.  Printed on the base of the can: ""Space is really dark, man..."" You think it's dark now? Just wait 10^40 years, when the universe is knocking on heat death's door and only black holes remain. Yes, I just brought up theoretical cosmology on BA.

2681,34483,taxandbeerguy,4.59,"355 ml can served cold into a tulip. Purchased from the LCBO for $4.85 CDN. Elated to finally try this legendary stout. Canning date seems to be sometime in the fall of 2016.  Appearance - Absolutely jet black with a massive two finger brown head on top. Huge retention time and loads of frothy lacing clings to the glass. Imposing, serious, etc. a grown ass man's beer.  Smell - Coffee, mocha, leafy hops. Imperial stout all the way. Hints of tobacco and molasses for added effect.  Taste - Huge swell of molasses initially, followed by lots of bitterness, coffee, and traces of vanilla. Plenty of licorice too. An absolute malt bomb. Wow.  Mouthfeel - Super smooth, super slick, super dense. Chewy. What else could you want?  Overall - Simply put, one of the best RIS's out there on the market. Hefty price tag, but for this beer advocate who purchased 4, another 4 is certainly in the offing, Wonderful, big complex stout that warrants a try under any circumstances, especially the dead of winter.  Edit - January 1, 2018. Revisited this bad boy again as I stumbled upon a few cans at a local LCBO. Canned October 23, 2017. Was reminded why this is one of the best beers on the planet.

2681,34483,Cfred371,4.15,"This is a 2014 vintage, so a bit aged.  Look: Ten Fidy comes out a dark dark brown, near black, with a one inch brown/khaki head that dissipates quickly. Carbonation bubbles are ample.  Smell: Dark fruits are the first whiff I get, with some anise and leather showing through with swirl.  Taste: Anise hits quick, but subsides, followed by dark fruit, brown sugar, and some of that leather like flavor.  Feel: Medium full to full bodied, well carbonated, and somewhat drying but not terribly bitter. Somewhat hot.  Overall: I didn't really have expectations for Ten Fidy, but I'm happy with the beer. The aroma leans a bit more leather esque than I prefer, but the dark fruits and sweetness, complimented by a thicker body, make for a good beer.

A true classic and one of the first imperial stouts I ever loved. Looks fairly nice in the glass. Rich all around with the taste being a little oaky and astringent and chocolatey. And the aroma sweeter. Somehow able to be huge and measured at the same time, giant flavor but no shuddering/palate fatigue/being punched in the face by flavors/etc. And in a can (that is also a nice 12oz serving size for wusses like myself.

From a handsomely dark beer with dark tan head and great lacing to it's roasty and boozy smell - it was very impressive. What surprised me was its less-than-stellar mouthfeel and less-than-very-good taste - I was expecting much more given the hype that surrounds this brew. Overall, it is a very good beer, no doubt, it's just that outside the boozy flavor it was mostly more bitter than I prefer from my stouts.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Super fine bubbles that last incredibly well. You can't really see it disappearing, so the head looks like icing on a dark chocolate cake. Not sure if it's just the shape of my glass, but the head definitely leaves pentagon shaped lacing in layers.  S: Roast hits first with mocha and dark chocolate, balanced by vanilla, with a strong espresso finish.  T: Rich roasty dark chocolate dominates with smooth and creamy vanilla and coconut milk to balance. Dark fruit notes of plum and pomegranate, follow with a strong alcohol bite (like someone added a splash of vodka) finishing with coffee, dessert bread spices (cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, etc.) and charred oak. A clean, smart and perfect stout profile.  F: Full, creamy and a little bit dry, but thick and frothy. Goes down like whole milk.

Taste: Rich and soft dark chocolate dominates with a light touch of roast, dark fruit, and a moderate perceived bitterness. Unbelievably balanced and soft transition between flavors. No harsh edges. Mouthfeel: Velvety, creamy, heavy bodied, with a low carbonation. Finish: Leaves a silky, rich chocolate and light roast maltiness.

Expensive at $14.99/4 can in a very tax free inexpesive state. HOWEVER, I drank four of these over 10 hours - and have rarely been as impressed - perhaps Founders, and so on...there are 3-4 other fine and readily-available Imperials, but this batch (11/16) was quite impressive.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

This beer pours like asphalt, pitch black and extremely thick. It left a dark tan head that looked quite nice. In a glass, this is one of the best looking stouts I've seen, just a perfect example of how a good stout should look and pour. I'm smelling a slight licoricey caramel scent, and a little bit of coffee as expected, dark roast. Yum.. Taste is exceptional, all of the smell with a tiny bit of booze, very well hidden though for a 10.5%. The mouthfeel is glorious... It's thick, it's creamy, it's dark, and it's like velvet. Extreme lacing happening with this brew as well. I'm enjoying my first glass thoroughly. I so wish I had this in my state, it would be a regular beer even with it's high price tag.

A brown head lingers for quite some time after the pour. The aroma is heavy, with roasted malts, caramel, and the slightest touch of booze. The taste is to die for. Thick, mouth-coating, and rich. Dark chocolate, caramel, and deep roasted coffee dominate. There is barely any alcohol taste coming through here. Extremely fucking dangerous situation for being 10.5%. The finish is sticky yet slightly dry, making me want to take drink after drink. Overall, this is incredible. Living in Colorado I was able to get a 4 pack for $13.99.

2681,34483,Tdizzle,4.72,"L - Poured into a snifter. Ten FIDY pours an inky, motor oil brownish-black with a thick head of mocha-colored foam that gradually settles to a thick cap atop the beer. Some patches of lacing cling to the glass on the drink down.  S - Notes of heavily roasted grain, rich dark-chocolate cake, very overripe dark fruits, and a bit of coffee dominate the aroma. A mild, leafy hoppy character lingers behind all of the wonderful stout aromas. The 10.5% ABV is remarkably well hidden.  T - Flavors of bitter cocoa and heavy dark roast prevail. Chocolate lava cake comes to mind. A touch a hoppiness balances the decadent, rich chocolate and roast flavors. The same overripe dark fruit character of the aroma shows itself in some estery yeast and booze notes. Again, the 10.5% ABV is so well hidden, but it provides a pleasant phenol note to the big sweetness. The finish is surprisingly dry, but leaves a deep cholocatey note lingering on the palate.  F - About as viscous and ""chewy"" of a texture that I've ever encountered in an imperial stout. The perfect amount of carbonation bubbles allow the immense flavors to pop, but never get in the way.  O - A real benchmark for the style. One of the most chocolate-forward imperial stouts I've encountered. Remarkably balanced and ""dry"" for a beer of this stature. Each sip leaves you in anticipation of the next. Damn near perfect.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,iridius,4.21,"I love this tar. It is a really good stout, only reason it's my #3 at this time is because it doesn't have a uniqueness to its taste, but it definitely makes up for it in thickness and strength.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,HorseheadsHophead,4.94,"L: Pours out almost pitch black, with hints of cola brown in the light. It looks like motor oil even as it pours out. In the glass, it's midnight black, topped by a creamy, sticky brown head with surprisingly great retention, and leaves tons of tan lacing along the glass.  S: The aroma exudes dark chocolate, bitter baking cocoa, espresso, savory umami/beef broth, caramel, burnt sugar, pumpernickel bread and spice cake.  T: So much dark and bitter chocolate upfront. The mid-palate transitions to caramel, toffee, toasted pumpernickel bread, and spice cake. Some fig and brandy-soaked raisin as well. Just before it gets cloying, the finish transitions to a beautifully, pungently bitter earthy, espresso roast, tempered by savory, brothy, meaty umami, which lingers forever, continually teasing the palate between bitterness and sweetness.  F: Full-bodied, thick, creamy, and chewy; yet with a potent enough carbonation that the beer still flows smoothly and easily across the palate, behooving you to take the next gulp!  O: This is not only the best Oskar Blues beer and one of the best imperial stouts I've had, but one of the best beers I've ever had.

T: Taste matches aromas well with toasted malt and strong coffee notes up front followed by bitter dark chocolate, cherry, and spice notes.  F: Full bodied, thick, smooth, and creamy with a small but good amount of carbonation.  O: Overall, a great Russian Imperial Stout. Well balanced.

2681,34483,RppIII,4.85,"The beer was poured from a 12oz can into a tall snifter. There was no date or batch number on the can. I surmise this has worn off in the six years I’ve been storing it.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful pitch black with a rich creamy brown head. Head retention is lacking but there is a slight lace that remains for the entirety of the drink. The beer is impenetrable with a light red hue around the edges.  Smell: The aroma is complex and rounded, as if those several years of coexistence has brought all of the separate elements closer together. A woody alcohol pervades, with hints of dried dates and roasted and dark malts.  Taste: Very complex, slightly sweet, with a little bit of a bite on the end. Woody alcohol is most present, this gives way to a creamy, roasty grain flavor that turns a bit harsh on the back end. Notes of dried dates become more present as the beer begins to warm. Alcohol is relatively drying.  Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation, creamy, great mouthfeel. Some lingering sweetness that is nicely contrasted with the dryness of the malt.  Drinkability: Definitely cannot notice the high abv of this beer. It is incredibly drinkable on the warm Florida evening, I can imagine it is significantly more drinkable on a cool autumn night. Very glad I aged this one for a couple of years. I have had younger versions, and I always describe the flavors as sharp. This one has taken some time to blend all of its parts into a nice rounded drinkable, highly flavorful beer!

Big nose of chocolate, roasted malts, earthy tea-like hops and a little plum.  Similar flavors in the taste, but they come on in waves: first chocolate, then some hop bitterness, then roasted malts, a little nuttiness and a nice touch of alcohol. Quite artfully done.

T - There are a lot of hops in this beer (98 IBU??), but they are nicely balanced by the robust dark chocolate and roasty characteristics.  M - One of the thicker beers out there. Just coats the tongue and envelops it in the awesome flavors of the beer! The 10.5% ABV is barely noticeable as well.

I found a 4-pack at the local Bristol's in Westwood and had to get this before it disappeared. $17 for 4. Its reputation precedes it.  Pours black, the lacing is a torn curtain of perfection. Brown 1-finger head. Aroma is what you expect, coffee, chocolate, some rum, malt. Nothing wrong or unexpected.  Taste is char, malt, toffee, coffee, tobacco. Baker's chocolate in there, thick malts, smoky but not burnt, how to describe it? Steak, bread and your morning cold coffee thrown in. Hoppy bitter is lurking but nothing makes you throw it against the room. It's polite Russian imperialism. Incredibly well balanced, 10.5% is really hidden, no cola, no real sweetness, no metal. A deceptively simple, gateway Russian stout.  People who like more dark fruit might prefer Old Rasputin. Firestone's Parabola is richer, and just as hard to get a hold of. Ten Fidy has less character but also no false notes. Maybe nothing to fall in love with?

The taste follows closely with roasted malt, cocoa, and some earthy hops. The 2013 can had a noticeably stronger cocoa flavor. Nice body but lots of carbonation for the style. Fantastic smell/taste overall. Definitely one of the better non-BA stouts and easy to find. I wish Oskar Blues would can a nitro version of this.  Also had a 2012 can in Aug of 2016, dated 10/26/12 ""Infioyous."" Had a little less carbonation in the pour.

The aroma is a mix of licorice, molasses, and roasted barley smothered in a mocha blanket.  The taste is all about bakers chocolate, black coffee, roasty toasty barley, and it could not possibly get any better. The slight hop slap on the ass end is a welcome surprise.  Mouthfeel is smooth as greased glass.  Overall this brew most certainly lived up to it's reputation. Outstanding.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,Junior,4.27,"One of the beer stores I frequent recently started to carry Oskar Blues. I was a little disappointed to see a canning date of 08/25/2013, so it is almost 1 year old.  Poured black with a thin caramel head. Smells of chocolate and coffee. Tastes chocolatey and boozy. Fairly well balanced. Full of mouth feel and drank surprisingly easy.  Would like to try a fresh one in the future. Great beer, but for the price, I will look elsewhere in the future.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Fear4Beer,3.62,"UPDATE TO MY LAST REVIEW: I disliked this beer so much because it was so bitter and so disgustingly piney that I aged the beer for two years. I'm updating my original review to let everyone know that this beer becomes palatable after two years of aging. It becomes a totally different beer. The bitterness goes down tremendously and the pine notes go away. It actually becomes an ok beer. I would not buy this beer ever again but if somehow I received one I would age it. It becomes so much better. To be clear I'm a fan of tasty things (not bitter and not piney) but more of a smooth balanced flavor (sweet, malty, dark fruits, etc).   BELOW IS MY OLD REVIEW:  I saw the rating for this beer, I found it at my local beer shop, and had to buy it. I poured it into a tall glass to see it in all of its glory.  First lets go with the things I respect with this beer. This brew is inky black and the lacing on it is beautiful. It has a high 10.5% ABV also. That's where I have to stop. I respect what they are trying to do with this beer but I just can't appreciate it. Unfortunately I still have taste buds.  The negatives: Smells like an IPA with roasted characteristics Tastes like an IPA with dark characteristics (cocoa and some malt) HIGH amount of hops and bitters. I just googled its IBU rating and its a 95!!! Holy crap, that's higher than some of the most bitter IPAs I've ever had. $15 for a 4 pack. It lingers in your mouth for minutes afterwards. You can literally taste it in your mouth 5 minutes after your last sip. To quote the movie Pineapple Express: ""F'ing lingerer man, lingerer"".  I just can't appreciate bitter beers. I just don't like to consume bitter things. The first thing I thought when I took my first sip was: ""OMG, what sort of weirdo enjoys this!?"". I'm a cook, I love cooking! The best way I could describe this in terms of a culinary meal would be like this: Go to a evergreen tree and take about 20 pine needles. Then take a teaspoon of pure cocoa powder. Put both of them in your mouth and chew. If you tell me that is delicious I'd think you need a health checkup. That is this beer in a nutshell. Incredibly piney with bitter cocoa. It just about turns your face inside out.  I had high hopes for this but I'm let down. Its one of those ""America, F ya!!"" sort of beers. Where they just put as much hops as possible just because its the American thing to do.  If I want a dark chocolate beer I'll just stick with my girly Samuel Smith's Organic Chocolate stout. :) I had no idea that this beer was going to be this bitter (95 IBU!!), I would have never paid 15 dollars for a 4 pack if I had known. I need to grow a thick beard and ride a unicycle before I can enjoy this level of manliness. I don't know how someone can pretend to enjoy this. I can't imagine what sort of food they call ""good food"". Meh, to each their own I guess.  look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,daudelin2000,4.38,"Pours a jet black, almost like motor oil with a mocha head. Very viscous looking. Aroma is of roasted chocolate and coffee. There's also some slight dank hoppy smell. Taste is very robust and complex. Roasted coffee, chocolate, and the dank hops come through a little on the finish. Fairly bitter, but not off-putting. Maybe a slight bit of alcohol burn, but at 10.5%, it's pretty well hidden. Mouthfeel is decent, but could use a little more creaminess. Overall, very good Imperial Stout and I definitely have again and again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Absolutely delicious. Sweet and dark and rich. Booze is only present in the aftertaste, and given that this beer is 10.50%, it is subdued. Nice hop balance on this one, more substantial than most imperials. Compared to Rasputin, this is a noticeably hoppy beer, but in a very dank way.  M: Carbonation is fairly light. Creates a beautifully creamy texture. Perfection. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, sticky and dark.  O: A truly phenomenal beer. As close to perfection as I could ask for. Sweet and rich and full.

Interesting that my canned four pack was packaged 10/7/15. This little detail really gets me thinking. What are you up to, Oscar Blues Brewery, you rascals, you.  This is the strongest 5 i've ever given for feel. It's perfection reinvented, evolved, torn down, reinvented again, reborn, reperfected. Its true nature evades description and can be found only in experience. The taste is beyond exquisite. An extremely high 5. 97th percentile-ish i'd say. Triumphant over Old Rasp or Narwhal by a good margin. No small feat. Fort George's Cavatica is a dog chasing this car. Renegade's RIS chases closer. Even More Jesus territory. Smell is impeccable. ever so slightly harsh. Still impeccable. Looks Beautiful. got this baby to a 4 inch, creeeeaaaamy, bubble rich, roaming, foam. wait, is this a fucking root beer float?

ABV seemed subdued and IBUs, by my best guess, were swallowed up by the dense black hole that is this RIS.

2681,34483,mfnmbvp,4.35,"12 fl oz. can, canned on 10.07/15. Finally getting around to reviewing this classic from Oskar Blues; my first can of Ten Fidy. Acquired a single can of this stuff from the local bottle shop.  Poured into a Duvel tulip snifter.  A - Pours a thick oily black body, probably the thickest blackest beer I've ever seen poured from a can. Pours sleek and silently and conjures about a finger of dark mocha chocolate head that falls to a ring and leaves a nice surface skimming. Minor spotty lacing. Looks very nice.  S - Aroma is all malt-forward: roasty, musty, a slight floral alcohol note to it, though i wouldn't attribute any of it to hops. There are subtle hints at milk chocolate & cream, but the earthy / musty / band-aid fumes seem to dominate just a bit. Hints of dark fruits: raisins, dates, figs.  T - Taste is smooth, creamy, sticky, sugary, sweet. Notes of chocolate, vanilla, marshmallow fluff, dark barley roast, malt bitterness, notes of dark fruits: raisin, dates, figs.  M - Mouthfeel is ridiculously smooth & creamy. Not coarse or rough in any way, no lingering char or bitterness. Smooth, milky, & creamy feel all around. Exceptionally easy-drinking stuff for the high abv. Sticky, sugary, sweet, very thick body. Definitely a dessert beer.  Overall, a nice big bad canned imperial stout; easily the best beer I've had from Oskar Blues so far, and well-deserving of the good ratings and reputation that it has.

At 25 seconds, the foam head changes color to light brown. At 2 minutes and 15 seconds, the head has dissipated into a quarter fingers worth, leaving behind a moderate amount of thick lacing. Black in color, with an orange luster. I cannot see any rising bubbles. Lacing is moderate in quantity and thick with a few areas being very thick. SMELL: Strong aromas of sweetened coffee, sweet chocolate, and molasses deliciously entangle with mild aromas of plums and sweet black cherries along with subtle bitter roasted malt and vanilla aromas. Hints of alcohol are also present. TASTE: Strong sweetened coffee, molasses, and sweet chocolate flavors initially bombard the palate, forming an instant and loveable flavor of sugary goodness. Mild bitter roasted malt flavors immediately follow and prevent any cloying. Mild plum and sweet black cherry flavors along with subtle vanilla enter next and further sweeten the taste. Subtle sweet oats and hints of alcohol make thier apperance as all previous flavors persist. FEEL: Very full-bodied with hints of carbonation. This almost feels like syrup because of how thick it is. Goes down incredibly smooth and creamy while also clinging to the back of the throat. A mild and welcoming alcoholic warmth can be felt as it goes down the throat. Finishes with a strong and nearly unwelcoming dryness. NOTE: A beer that is justifiably hyped.

Tastes like dark chocolate, espresso, dark fruit, roasted malts and caramel. Well balanced flavours, leaning slightly towards chocolate bitter, which is a plus for me. Thick, viscous mouthfeel, low carbonation and a very bitter and full of chocolate aftertaste.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,oldn00b,4.23,"Pours near black from a can into a stout glass. Thick khaki head with solid retention but little to no lacing. Dissipates pretty quickly to a thin ring of foam.  Nose is huge on roasted malt - slight chocolate and tobacco notes.  Flavor follows - big roasted malt bill, nice rich character of leather, chocolate, hints of coffee and tobacco. Definitely some hop notes, but they feel a bit faded. Not sure how old this can is but it doesn't take away from the beer. It's not as though it's too sweet without it.  It is a bit thin for me. The mouthfeel overall is nice, rich, and full but it's definitely a bit more thin than I'd like.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

But I've had a good amount of stouts and this one is just balanced and smooth, with no overwhelmingly difference in any other stouts. Each to their own I guess. Maybe this one isn't for my palate.

Very dark roasted malt. Some dark chocolate. A little alcohol. Slight coffee and black licorice. TASTE: Alcohol, dark chocolate. Dark roasted malt. There is a bit of sweet malt up front and then a fairly strong dose of bitterness to finish. FEEL: Medium-thin body. Nice level of carbonation. A bit sticky at first, then dry on the finish.

Look: Pours and settles a viscous pitch black, with impressive three finger porous mocha colored head from an aggressive pour.  Smell: Rich roast coffee and dark bakers chocolate up front, followed by some sweet dark fruit, black licorice, and charred wood, all backed by some light alcohol.  Feel: Unbelievable smooth body, with some light carbonation on a full body.  Taste: Perfectly balanced; dark chocolate, dark fruit, caramel, toasty oat, roast coffee, and some boozy alcohol. Aftertaste is bittersweet and dry.  Overall: It is difficult for me to put into words how good this is. Amazing balance here, ABV is concealed very well.

2681,34483,jmasher85,4.34,"Pours thicker and blacker than Satan's blood - even the head is among the darkest I've ever seen.  Nose is an interesting mix of coffee, roasted barley, and hoppy bitterness, mixed with dark chocolate fudge, smoke, cocoa, and Satan's blood.  Taste is similar, but throw a bit of licorice in there. Truly, the greatest accomplishment of this beer is how it manages to be savory rich, toasty bitter, and malty, chocolatey sweet all at the same time, with all 3 flavors pushing and kicking each other around, vying for attention.

I had it in September 2014 out in North Carolina, but did not review it then. It’s good to see Ten Fidy out there instead of just the main Dale Pale’s Pale Ale, Old Chub, Mama’s Little Yella Pils, etc. A bit pricy for a can, but this was a must have.  Poured a black oil color with two fingers of dark tan, fizzy head, which thinned out fairly quickly. Good amount of spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. Below average retention. (Sight - 4.00)  Smelled chocolate, boozy licorice, caramel syrup, Jägermeister, roasted toffee, dark cocoa powder and chocolate syrup. (Smell - 4.50)  Taste follows the nose, although maybe not quite as good. Got boozy milk chocolate up front, followed by bitter smoky licorice, caramel syrup, dry roasted molasses, herbal hops, chocolate cake, some char wood and dark fruit. (Taste - 4.25)  Full body. Chewy, thick texture. Average carbonation. Long, warming finish. (Feel - 4.25)  This was even better than I remembered it. Looking forward to eventually trying some of the variants.

Look: Black like the night. 5 fingers of thick, fluffy, mocha brown head that takes its sweet time and gives me time to build up the anticipation. Gorgeous lacing as the head slowly dies.  Smell: Amazing complexity: dark roastiness, fruity like raisins or port wine, dark chocolate.  Taste: Excellent balance of sweet and bitter. A hint of burnt coffee.

Smells awesome, really get the chocolate notes on top of the roasted malts. Hits the mouth just as thick as it looks. Medium carbonation opens up and it has a really nice feel. Massive bitterness is well blended into the stout, step for step with the sweeter flavors before taking control at the finish.  Overall, this is one of the best RISs I've had. I was apprehensive because of the can and whatever, but the hype is real. For comparison, I just finished an Old Rasputin - which I really like - and it was beyond obvious that the Ten FIDY was the superior beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Not for the faint of heart, this beer pours as used motor oil with a thin caramel-colored head. Yeah, licorice, burnt toast, coffee, blah, blah, blah. Very flavorful but, let's be honest, it is hard to conceal 10.5% ABV. There is s distinct alcohol taste that numbs the tongue after a while.

Pours pitch black with a dense tan head that lasts a couple minutes and leaves lots of lace on the glass.  S: 4.25 As soon as the can is cracked, there’s a good dose of roasted malt, dark chocolate, and coconut that fills the room. Licorice, dark roast coffee, and vanilla show up as the beer opens up a bit.  T: 4.25 Taste is slightly sweet with strong roasted malt and dark chocolate. Anise-type bitterness comes through, mixing between sweeter flavors of vanilla and coconut and the more dominant roasted malt and subtle tobacco. Fairly strong malt and hop bitterness lingers on the finish.  M: 4.75 Body is thick and chewy with just the right amount of carbonation. Just about perfect in this regard.  O: 4.25 This is a classic example of a pure, imperial stout. Great flavors and aromas with good roasted malt presence, and a thick body.

2681,34483,velosuds,4.83,"Update 1/15/16: been too damn long since I imbibed this treasure. What prompted the edit? One word. On the can. Had to look it up. Can't remember needing to use the dictionary to look up the meaning of a word on a label or the printing on a can of beer. What is the world coming to? Cancupiscent. Not a recognized word, but a play on concupiscent. Translation: beer lust. It is. And, what synchronicity. As I opened the can, my playlist shuffle began playing the ""ten fingers of doom."" Yeah, Ted Nugent's Stranglehold. Which is what this beer has me in. This is the best beer in a can. Period. Exclamation. No hung jury. Out of cliches.  I upgraded the look, smell, and taste. Very affordable too!  I accidentally deleted my original review from 2010. Oops. Not BA website fault. Mine. And the buzz.   Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter glass. Single purchased from a health food store for $2.99. I drink to my health, or not.  L-Pours a virtually black hue, nearly the color of the can, with a two finger, dark creamy tan head with good retention and modest lacing.  S-Deep, dark chocolate and toasted malts and dried fruits like raisins, dates, and prunes. Coffee and vanilla also noted. Very nice and appropriate for style. Burst forth as soon as the tab is raised. Awesome.  T-Good, but not equal to the anticipation I expected from the aroma. Malty sweetness, but not nearly as complex as the aroma. Rich, creamy with some smokiness, and the alcohol is hardly noticeable, which is quite an accomplishment for a beer of this gravity. This is better in 2016 (canned 12/15) than in 2010.  F-Medium to full body, with a nice level of carbonation.  O-Quite good for a RIS, especially from a can. Nice that it comes in a 12 oz. serving. Wouldn't want a bomber all by myself.

2681,34483,Chris_Huston,4.36,"08/2015 can poured near room temp into truncated tulip snifter, an evil dark black with brown undertones, engine oil, syrupy, sinister molasses look as the unusually dark leather brown head piled up. Lacing sticks to the glass after the froth has receded to being a frame for the drink, and with turning the beer round in the glass, it lingers in pleasant, rhythmic sheets.  The immediate and sustaining smell is boozy, inviting rather than overpowering, but rather simple, dominating, and unabating. Makes me think this is a great candidate for aging. (Will find out, as I have a 2014 can in the wings.)  The presentation is in part exceptional, unusual, and modest, but it reveals its greatness in the taste -- more specifically, not just in delivering on its prologue, but bringing in more characters. A great smokiness , some malty sweetness that's balanced superbly with a coffee-like bite. It also, like a great tune, keeps some of its early motifs, but working in harmony with the new strains.  The feel is a slightly syrupy, creamy medium heavy body that doesn't wow with its weight, but still brings what you expect from a stout.  In contrast to something such as Founder's Breakfast -- one of my favorites -- which is more of a refined dressy dinner dessert stout, this is a rustic, Siberian bar stout.

2681,34483,MacMalt,4.43,"I've been drinking this RIS for several years and was surprised to see that I hadn't reviewed it before. Poured into snifter. The color is a deep mahogany-black with a two-finger, mocha-colored head and lacing. It's a very attractive pour. The aroma is decadent: dark chocolate, coffee, malt, some vanilla, and a distinct alcohol smell. What a taste! tons of dark chocolate, burnt coffee, dark fruit, and a bit of bitter hops at the finish. The alcohol is also evident. As if all this weren't enough, this stout pours from the can like motor oil: super thick and creamy; you can practically chew it. There is a significant alcohol burn. Overall, this is truly a superior RIS. It really deserves its stellar reputation.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,cmalitsky,4.83,"I am not a high IBU guy, but they are hidden extremely well in this beer.

Great to sip or share around Christmas.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Seanem44,4.38,"Pours like motor oil but it tastes oh so good. One of the best RIS I have ever had the pleasure of. Take your time drinking it and make sure its not too cold. It's not cheap though. $14.99 for a four pack, but its worth it. The alcohol is well masked for being 10.5% and this has become a yearly staple for me.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,mac31,4.27,"Big booze whacks you right across the palate up front. Rich, dark chocolate is the centerpiece of this brew. One word to describe this beer is decadent. Thick. Rich. Firm, spicy hoppiness (has a touch bite), which is gobbled up by the huge chocolate character. A touch of cereal grains, cooked caramel, and nearly burnt bread crust in the finish. Flashes of ash in finish. Such an easy drinking beer, especially at 10.5%. Tons of boozy vapors as you quaff, but goes down like a 7 percenter. Simple. Straight forward. Flat out good. Glad I have three more of these!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,mr-jj,4.52,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz can.  Color is ink black, completely opaque, with a thick mocha head. Long retention and lots of lacing. Smell is really yummy - dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, and a citrus hops. Taste is delicious - lots of chocolate goodness, some dark fruit, roasted malt and a bitter finish that adds balances all of dark richness. Mouthfeel is thick, rich and creamy. Full-body and moderate carbonation. Overall, an outstanding beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,kalosjakar,4.23,"Upon opening the can, the chocolate foam already showed itself.  Poured into a pint glass, dark dark black, with a large chocolate colored head. Looks appetizing!  Vanilla is certainly up front on the first sniff. Smelling a bit of alcohol in the back.  Tastes creamy on the first sip, almost milky mouthfeel. Definite roastiness up front, not much vanilla.. more alcohol than vanilla. In my opinion, the alcohol is not well hidden in this beer. The overly roasted malt is not enough. It is 10.5, so its understandably hard, but Ive had plenty of stouts on par if not stronger taste much smoother. The roasted aspect is one of the best Ive tasted however, perhaps its saving grace.  I noticed a good lacing as well.  A good beer, with a high ABV. If you like stouts its worth trying, if you do not like stouts you probably will not like this.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,aleigator,4.46,"Pours a pitch black color, with a small, dark brown head, soon reduced to a small ring of bubbly lacing.  Smells of fudge coated, roasted malts, also containing ground coffee leftovers. Matured, grassy hops create a bitter-chocolate impression, finding its sweet counterpart in molasses and a whiff of rock sugar. Exhibits a very vivid, diversified nose, not solely on the sweet side, but with a promising, intriguing earth supported bitterness.  Has a higher carbonation, perfectly preserved by the can, which adds a refreshing first sip, while the beer in general still drinks beautifully smooth. Even its dry, bitter coffee ending leaves enough space on the palate for soothing whipped cream, ensuring a soft, enjoyable mouthfeel.  Tastes of toffee accompanied earth, together with a warming scorched malt foundation. Milk chocolate produces a ton of whipped cream, which smoothes the slowly uprising bitterness till the very end, consisting of a blend between grassy, still pungent hops and heated coffee beans. Once the prominent bitterness is established, it becomes a cornerstone of the beers taste profile, revealing a multi-layered coffee, earth, roasty malts and hop richness. Caramel cuts through during the finish, balancing the long lasting bitter aspects of the beer, while ending surprisingly clean, putting the focus back on soothing whipped cream, wrapping up wooden ground coffee.  A breathtaking approach of creating a big, bold stout, with a fantastic, balanced depth to it. Almost overpowering the palate at certain stages, as for its extreme taste diversity, the smoothness guarantees a convincing balance throughout. The beer always tends to find an answer for the boundary pushing questions it poses in a fitting, just as extreme counterpart.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,schoolboy,4.25,"I can't fault this excellent stout - it's a winner all around. It's beautiful in the glass - all black and nice little bubbles on tight foam head. Quality made, obviously.  The aroma is a wonderful malty smell that keeps getting better as my brew goes from warm to warmer. Nice. The taste similarly warms up from a nice moderately bitter, malty, boozy drink to a richer, meltier yet experience. It is a strong stout taste yet is not so complicated as to confuse me.  This is a great one and is highly recommended. When we head out to CO in 12 days our first stop after the airport is a huge beer store, and I will seek this out. I wish we were stopping at the weed store first, but I'm not in charge of our big group.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Think of the blackest thing you can imagine, and double that blackness, and take a black magic marker and fill in the gaps, and put that into a black rocket ship, and shoot that into the depths of black space, and close your eyes, and use that as a reference. With a tan head. Perfect tiny fine bubbles, very little lacing. S: Dark roasted malt and some decent hop presence. Floating around in the background I get milk chocolate as well. T: Roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate, a hop brightness that makes me think of pineapple (but in a good way, really), and a bitter finish, but right for the style. F: Pretty much damn near perfect.

2681,34483,Raime,4.53,"Oskar Blues TenFIDY.  At long, longggggggg last I finally get to try this highly acclaimed juggernaut of a beer. Only took me three or four years haha. Anyway, scored a 4 pack for 15.99. Did not go into the store with intentions on buying this..and then I saw it sitting there looking lonely and calling my name like your mom after I dumped her when we had you. Enough fucking talk, let us get to it.  Look - I've said abyss. I've said motor oil. I've said darkness, pitch black, and your wives blown out vagina. But this right here is officially the blackest beer I have ever seen. Poura blacker than Charlie Murphy out of the twelve ounce can into a pint glass with the deepest, darkest mocha head I have ever given my witness testimony to seeing. Carbonation will obviously be impossible to read given the supreme depth of this beer. The stick is moderate in nature and clings to the glass quite well.  Smell - Woahwoahwoah...I've never seen hops like this in ANY stout before. Big grapefruit and floral notes right off the bat met in the middle by roasted malts and chocolate and coffee and this and that. This is most definitely the MOST UNIQUE nose I have ever come across in any beer I have ever cracked open. Well...this will be an interesting flavor profile.  Taste - Tropical mango and grapefruit piths really stand out in this beer. Honestly I think this may be one of the most tropical beers I have ever tasted. After the initial tropical assault you are met by the chocolate and roast though they stay tame relative to the hops. There is a huge vanilla note as well that really dominates the mouth as you continue into the beer. A palate wrecking stout? Well that's certainly new. It tastes like mixing a ' Lil Sumpin Extra! ' with a ' Stone IRS '. This is an incredibly sweet beer with a melding of bitterness. They do not cancel out and instead join into a unison of boozey goodness. The alcohol isn't present at all.  Feel - The feel os this beer is thick with a higher than any other level of creamyness. The fresh hops once again dominate this aspect and the malts are turned down from the taste though there is an ever present roasted smokiness. The beer swallows once again very sweet and very bitter in an odd unison that I have never encountered beforw in anything I have drank. Should also add that the carbonation doesn't appear to even be a factor in this one. Beer is so damn thick it gave me a mustache.  Overall - This is easily the most unique beer I have ever had. With that said, if you know a hophead who hates stouts or a stouthead who hates IPAs this would be the gift to give them for christmas. Ultra hopped and fresh to death. Nice melding of the sweetness amd the bitterness. I've drank some bitter and some sweet beers before but this one was king in both categories, nearly choking me up a few times. This is not your typical high ABV dark stout. This is a whole new dimension of beer making.   Note: I will likely update ratings as I continue into the four pack.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TheBlueWaffle,4.88,"Newer to stouts, but I'm pretty sure this is the best one I've had. Chocolate, creamy, hoppy in the right places, and down right delicious.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,DaverCS,4.31,"Poured super thick and lights-out black. 1 finger of gorgeous caramel colored head. Beautiful looking beer.  I am surprised with the aroma. I definitely get the chocolate and coffee with a kiss of tobacco smokiness, but the most prominent aroma is a hop-like citrus note. It's almost like a sour twang. Alcohol also does come through in the finish.  Taste is really nice. Nice and thick with beautiful rich chocolate and coffee notes. Minor smokiness throughout the sip. While the beer is not all that bitter, the citrusy hops push forward which does cut the richness, but detracts from the main components of the beer. Alcohol heat does come through slightly in the finish which warms the body pleasantly. Nice amount of carbonation and beautifully thick mouthfeel.  Overall, i think hops are a bit unbalanced in this one. Again, not the bitterness, but the slightly sour, citrus notes. Tone the citrus down and the beer is a perfect balance of smoke, chocolate, and coffee. Also, with all the great stouts available, not sure the price is justifiable. I see this pairing well with a porcini and espresso rubbed hangar steak with a red wine Demi glacé. It gets a 86/100.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,DaneBramage,4.43,"$6 on tap at my local pub, not a bad investment. Very smoky flavor mixed with chocolate, coffee and hints of burnt fruit.

2681,34483,HopsAreDaMan,4.33,"UPDATE( 1-12-2018): Had it at over three years old, and it was still really good.  12oz, dated as canned on 11/11/2015 (roughly a year of age), poured into a snifter; tried somewhat cold, then allowed to warm. Pours dark like any imperial stout (like motor oil), yet this one has a beautiful, chocolate-colored head, roughly two fingers worth; very nice lacing. The aroma has a lot going on, and has notes that remind me of an old ale: booze, perhaps sherry?, dark malts. Taste is a little sweet, with roasted notes, chocolate, and some bitterness in the finish. Heavy mouth-feel.  This is certainly one of the best imperial stouts I have had, but not the best. I can't be for certain, but I think I liked Stone's Collaboration W00tstout 3.0 better (which I had about two months ago). And price-wise, I'm not certain this is any better than Old Rasputin (of course, I would have to do a side-by-side to be certain), which is much less expensive for a 4-pack. I think the aroma on Ten Fidy impress me more than anything. It certainly is a quality imperial stout--and as I have read, it may age nicely in the can--but for the money ($14-$15 a 4-pack), I think there are better options out there.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,SGerrard,4.43,"Phenomenal RIS. Had on draft in a half pint glass (not the best for any level of appreciation, I understand). Mouth feel was a complete sensory experience, with a rich coating that persisted. Excellent go-to stout, much like the Expedition for me.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,engle1wj,4.47,Look - black in color and pours with a good amount of head which is brown in color  Smell - the smell was sweet with roasted notes but wasn't jumping out of the glass.  Taste - lot of roasted notes and the alcohol was hidden well with the beer especially with an over 10% abv  Feel - the roasted notes linger and it has a bit of a thick feel  Overall - very solid beer for an russian imperial stout. once you let it warm up it really comes to life,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Calvinistic,4.73,"This stuff is expensive, but well worth the money if you like a great stout!  L - poured slowly from a silver can into my favorite stainless steel mug at room temperature. Pitch black with a small dark tan head. S - smells sweet like syrup having a consistent maple/caramel character. T - sweet at first, with extremely strong malt flavor, then smoky caramel and a lingering pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. Then it turns sweet again. No dark fruit here, yet that is not a fault given the strength and complexity of the flavors. It's almost like a liquefied form of teriyaki beef jerky! Amazing. Makes you want to take another sip. F - yummy and thick like syrup with strong carbonation. O - I look high and low for great imperial stouts and this one is just excellent. A super combination of flavor, smell and mouthfeel. But keep in mind that this is a heavy and powerful beverage. ""Ten Fidy"" stands for the high 10.50% ABV. One of these is plenty for me. This is a flavorful sipper, not a session brew to just gulp down. If you like strong dark beers, you can't go wrong with this one. In a word, ""spectacular!""",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

I got the burnt barrel up front, but not as boozy as I expected. Must've been that particular barrel ( maybe used one time too many?) The taste: 60deg. out of a can, but first taste was burnt barrel then metalic. Not sure where that comes from. Sweet up front then bitter. I have plenty to compare this stout to and PERSONALLY, I can't see the 96/100 ratings. Feel: 60deg. Poured like thin syrup and that was what I expected. You gotta love barrel aged stout!

The handsome one-finger head is a medium brown foam composed of fine bubbles. The aroma is malty, roasty sweet (dried stone fruit -- cherries or currants) with hops presence. The taste is like the aroma with the addition of black coffee with sweetness (raisins) and along with slight burnt sugar plus a slight astringency. There is no alcoholic burn. The astringency remains as an aftertaste. The mouthfeel is perfect: chewy with perfect carbonation.

2681,34483,hoptheology,4.33,"Poured into a globe snifter glass from a 12 oz can aged 2 years, exactly - as in 9/5/13. Wow, didn't mean for that to happen intentionally!  A : Pours a tarry, motor oil 100% black out of the can, creating a reddish almond head of about 2 fingers. It's not too large, even small for this snifter, but it sticks around with a mossy layer of salmon-colored froth on top, also adhering softly to the sides as its swirled.  S : Lots of Russian going on here. A strong alcohol presence with hits of rum, chocolate (chip, syrup, burnt, powder), oats, anise, and burnt malts. Some fig and cherry notes as well.  T : This is highly burnt, both in malts and in alcohol. It's not a bad burn, but a smooth one. It's like a fire cavern in your mouth. Some black licorice underneath, with burnt chocolate chip cookies that were left in the oven too long (the crunch, the char, and the melted chocolate). Overall I'm left craving more chocolate, oatmeal, and depth.  F : The feel of this beer is highly sophisticated, and powerful. It's a creamy wash of depth and electricity, like firecrackers going off in a froth of heavy cream. It ends burnt and relatively dry.  O : This is a solid Imperial Russian Stout, but not quite my favorite. What it has going is lots of power, burn, screamin' alcohol, and some nice chocolate/licorice notes. I could have used more versatility in flavor and not as much linearity of the one-noted burnt alcohol/chocolate. I'm sure by the time I'm done with this snifter I'll be close to nap time. Already feeling this.   1 year later I've had one a touch fresher, and it brings out those syrupy chocolate drenched figs. Smells like a Bourbon Barrel Aged stout and tastes just as complex. Feel is heavy, syrupy, thick, viscous. This is one killer stout. The BA-quality stout that isn't a BA stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,nizzle8287,5,"Canned on 8/26/14 - exactly one year ago. Poured into a snifter at 55F.  No light gets through this beer; it is jet black, with about 2 fingers of tan head that dissipates rather quickly down to a ring around the edge of the glass.  I smell licorice and chocolate mostly, with a very faint hop aroma hidden in the background. Very simple, yet robust.  This is a full bodied beer with light carbonation, and as far as imperial stouts go, the 10.5% ABV is very well hidden. Compared to a fresh sample of Ten Fidy, the alcohol and hop character has mellowed significantly.  Taste is is like the smell, with licorice and chocolate dominating. There is an overall richness that makes this beer a delectable sipper, perhaps best with some kind of pie after a light supper.  When I had this beer around Thanksgiving of 2014, I would rate it 5/5. It tastes like a different beer now, more mellow, and less pronounced hop character, yet I would still rate it 5/5. It is a much more civilized imperial stout with some age. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone who loves thick and hearty imperial stouts.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Dustin_Sallitt,4.44,"Just an awesome Russian imperial stout. The key is that you let it warm up. The nose is mainly chocolate with some roast, but the flavor is so much more complex. The first sip hits you with a stern chewy chocolatey flavor, with a hint of roast to follow, followed by a nice sweet lasting chocolate flavor and may I say even a little bit of coffee esqe flavor recognizable, before a nice roasted chocolate flavor sits on your mouth. The mouth feel is silly and thick, a heavy beer but it covers your mouth and feels just right. This is basically, half baked brownie beer.

2681,34483,TomMorris,4.41,"This stout is fucking meaty. Pours extremely dark with some ruby-red on the outside when light is shone into it; leaves some ""cancupiscent"" lacing as well. Smell is an amalgamation of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, dark fruits and berries, and smoked meat with a bit of a subtle soy-sauce kind of twang that lots of Russian Imperial Stouts have. The taste is just incredible and extremely well-balanced; not too sweet nor too savory and twangy. Truly balance in a can. The mouthfeel is considerably thick and viscous, and lingers on the tongue while the beer finished with a slight but pleasing alcohol burn that warms the stomach upon consumption.

Smell: Somehow get lots of oakiness, but it's not BA, which is........confusing and awesome. Other than that, lots of chocolate, toffee and maltiness. Caramel and molasses too on the end.  Taste: Still get the bourbon barrely type taste at the front, which is amazing. Did they use oak staves in the brew? After that, lots of viscous mocha flavor and malty sweetness. So delicious and decadent!!  Feel: Thick and sticky, with a heavy body that lingers on the palate for plenty of time. The perfect dessert beer. Rich and heavy.

It smells a lot like bourbon but the can doesn't say it is aged in bourbon barrels or anything.  Taste: There's a lot going on here. It tastes like chocolate and coffee at first, then there is a bit of a black licorice flavor, and a sweet brown sugar flavor. It has a bit of a bourbon flavor as well. It tastes pretty awesome.  Mouthfeel: A very full bodied beer. Not too chewy or oily but not something you could chug. It's a definite sipper.  Overall: A really good beer. It has a good complex flavor and a nice full body. I would buy it again, but I'm making a note that this is a very rich beer and would be best as a night-cap, holidays, special occasions, etc. Don't let the can fool you.

Now I'm disappointed that I waited so long, this one is worth the extra effort to obtain. Pours a beautiful, thick khaki colored head that dissipated quickly. Smells sweet and malty, and the taste matches this - a balanced beer that is creamy with amazingly smooth feel. The alcohol kicks in at the finish with just a touch of bitterness, but it isn't a burner like many other RIS I have tried. This is the top of the line for non-flavored, non-barrel-aged stouts and every stout enthusiast should try this as a benchmark.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ljjpowers,4.13,"Quaker State; Valvoline; Castrol GTX; Oskar Blues Ten Fidy—the closest thing to a sludgy motor oil that you will find on the list. The beer flows from the stout’s trademark can at the same pace that Bartolo Colon gets down the line after lacing a double (just kidding, single) into left-center. The nose is complex, revealing roasted malt, chocolate, toffee, booze, figs, soy sauce (seriously), teriyaki beef jerky (seriously) and molasses one after the next. But the most striking quality of this OB creation is the finish… the beer goes down with a slight numbing that renders this brew dangerously drinkable. No flavor stands out. Instead, the tastes fuse to create something that is uniquely Oskar Blues. Speaking of uniquely Oskar Blues, who the hell decided to put a rich stout in a can? Despite its Colorado roots, this brew is not something that I would generally choose to take with me on a hike or rafting trip (read: I don’t like to mix physical activity with imperial stouts).

The nose is a bit sweet and darkly malty, a very nice blend of chocolate, caramel and dark toffee with hints of coffee and readily apparent boozy undertones. On the palate, it is sweet chocolate and cocoa up front, joined by a significant molasses character and hints of coffee mid-palate. The finish is dark, roasted maltiness that leaves behind a lingering chocolate/molasses flavor and a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is full and luxuriously thick, as well as warming due to the ABV; the carbonation makes itself known as well. Alcohol flavors are surprisingly absent from the palate, so caveat bibitor.

The aroma and flavor are bold: the smell is of sweet, dark-roasted (but, not burnt) malt, sugar, and coffee, and the flavor is of those elements, with a touch of char, sugar, oatmeal puree’, mild black liquorice, background celery, and bitterness, which being counter-balanced by the extreme malt, does not come across as a 98 IBU thing. Mouthfeel is heavy and viscous, and Oskar Blues Ten FIDY finishes in between wet and dry, with an alcohol presence noticeable in the body, but not so much in the flavor.

Excellent retention as the head lingers for awhile. Leaves behind some small amounts of beautiful lacing.  S: Chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, soy sauce, roasted malts, and some subtle earthy hops.  T: Chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, plum, cherry, soy sauce, and some earthy hop spiciness.  M: Full bodied, moderate carbonation, creamy, oily, and smooth. Alcohol is hidden well for being 10.5% but still gives a nice warming sensation. All of those factors make it a somewhat easy drinker that you want to saver as a sipper.  O: This is one of my personal favorite stouts. This is just truly a great beer that I look forward to every year. I always stock up so I can enjoy it throughout the year.

2681,34483,ZachWolf,3.31,"Odd occurrence. I peruse my local whole foods for beer often. Suddenly two weeks ago their selection of Oskar Blues quadrupled, and for the first time I saw Ten Fidy and immediately bought some. I open it up and it smells like.... SOY SAUCE. The 2015 Parabola smelled and tasted like soy sauce but it was balanced and it played nicely as an umami - ish element. Unfortunately I am pretty bummed out how much soy sauce I taste and smell blocking what seems like a great beer, especially being hype from its reviews.  Now the odd occurrence is that I looked on the bottling date and it was a year and a half old. Did Whole Foods go to a distributor and accidentally pick up beer that had been sitting there that long? Did they think "" oh stouts age lets buy it anyways."" I dunno. So Ill look for a fresh batch one day, or a guaranteed well aged one but for now this is just an alright beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,Brondeau,4.69,Almost a perfect stout. I enjoy stouts a great deal and this is one I keep coming back to. Pours like motor oil. Flavor is perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter. Heavy and thick mouthfeel with above average carbonation to lighten it into an easy drinker. This is a feat for a 10.5 ABV imperial stout.  Overall this is near perfect. Not quite as complex as a KBS but doesn't have to be. I could drink this every day of the year. I can't say that for the KBS which I love in its own way.  Wonderful.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,GrahamDN,4.26,"Canned 9/24/14; drunk exactly eight months later.  Right out of the gate, Ten Fidy tells you it means business, pouring dirty-motor-oil black and viscous topped with a deep tan head that takes a minute or two to recede.  The nose is dense with chocolate--fudge, chocolate cake, some cocoa--over top aromas of dried fruit and plum, some booze, and a whiff of oily espresso. A faint scent of soy sauce appears as the beer approaches room temperature.  Richly flavored without being oppresive, cocoa dominates on the palate, with an array of malt flavors supporting it. I feel like I can taste a little of every shade across the spectrum of malt kilning, stewing, and roasting. Full-bodied and viscous, the interplay of modest hop bitterness and acrid bitterness from roasted malts keeps this fairly sweet RIS from becoming tiresome on the tongue.  The namesake ""ten fidy"" makes itself known immediately on the finish. The tongue tingles with a gentle--but undeniable--alcoholic warmth that even numbs a bit, like a very mild anesthetic. A little too much so for my taste, but it does keep the beer from seeming cloying, helping to make this heavyweight dangerously drinkable.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

But with this said, the bold dark chocolate and dark fruity flavors work very well together and while there is quite a bit of alcohol in the taste it is not off putting at all.

2681,34483,michiganmatt,4.41,"Poured 12oz can at about 45-50 degrees into DFH signature glass (a snifter)  Appearance - 5/5 After a vigorous pour down the middle of the glass, a massive amount of beautiful chocolately brown head arise. It grows so big it almost overflows the glass. The color of the brew is inky black, with not even the slightly notes of anything but black. The head retention seems really good, a nice layer of foams stays around for most of the drinking.  Smell - 4/5 Dark roasty malts, chocolate, some pale-ale like hop aromas. Perhaps a bit of bourbon booziness.  Taste - 4.5/5 Very sweet. Roasty malts, cholocate and toffee flavors up front along with a perfect amount of smokiness which doesn't overwhelm the rest of the flavors. Some hop flavors near the end of the sip, along with some additional smokiness. There is a slight booziness throughout the sip, but it's very small and mostly covered up by the rest of the flavor.  Mouthfeel - 4.5/5 Ultra-creamy, such a luxurious mouthfeel. Puts all other creamy beers to shame. Only a light amount of medium-light carbonation. Medium-full body. Despite the 90+ IBUs, this wasn't very biter IMO.  Overall - 4.5/5 This was an incredible Russian Imperial Stout. One that I will definitely be buying plenty more of in the future.

Strong aroma of burnt chocolate, vanilla beans, molasses, and sugar. Pretty dense on the palate. Lots of bittering chocolate and roasty malt initially. Settles in with an overly sweet, sticky middle that introduces notes of grapes/raisins and figs along with an eye-twitching sweetness. Smooth on the finish with more chocolate and malt on the aftertaste. It might be the age, but I don't get much alcohol at all on this beer.  RIS's are my favorite beers, bar none. This particular one is exceedingly delicious. Mine had a decent bit of age on it, which I think made the sugars a little more vibrant.

This one is boozy but not at the expense of deep rich flavors that put one in stout heaven. Molasses and singed grains right out of the gate, followed up by bitter dark roast coffee, dark bittersweet and milk chocolates, Concord grapes, brown bread, a whiff of harsh wood char. A caramel sweetness lingers in the background. Beer appears thicker than is actually the case. Finish is rich and layered, with the grape-like fruitiness morphing into something more like maraschino cherries on top of semi-sweet chocolate. Slight grassy hops. This beer deserves its sterling reputation. There is some burnt graininess and potent alcohol flavor but not at the expense of the more delicate complexities.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jazzyjeff13,4.05,"A 355ml can with a canned-on date of Nov 2014. Purchased recently from the Brewdog webshop. After hearing so much about this, I'm pleased to finally give it a whirl.  A: Poured into a Duvel tulip. A dark chocolate-brown hue that appears pitch black in the glass. Yields a smallish head of creamy brown foam that lasts for a moment or two before subsiding to a patchy surface layer.  S: Aroma of rich roasted malt with hints of chocolate, coffee, burnt grain, molasses, earthy yeast and faint stewed leaves. The booze is well hidden. Lovely.  T: Tastes of intense roasted malt with a powerful bitter finish. Notes of chocolate, coffee, burnt grain, molasses, a touch of brown sugar, earthy yeast, subtle spice and stewed hops. Slightly sweet, followed by a strident malt-driven bitterness upon swallowing.  M: Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with pleasant carbonation and good body. A little hop oil action on the palate. Somewhat astringent, accompanied by an aftertaste of bitter roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, molasses and stewed hops.  O: Nice - an impressive RIS. Looks good, while the aroma and flavour are redolent with notes of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, yeast and stewed hops. Rich and intense. Lovely body.

Cocoa, little bit of vanilla and some caramel in the background. You can pick up that its boozy off the nose. T: Chocolate upfront, slight bit of smokiness in the flavor. Coffee, and caramel notes in the background. Slight warmth on the way down. M: Big full mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Coats your mouth and hangs around between each sip. O: Excellent imperial stout.

2681,34483,HowardTheDuck,4.43,"2013 can poured into a snifter. It's no surprise that Brah-lorado (aka, ""The Bros."") gave this a perfect score. Its far from a subjective perfect, but it is damn good. For anyone interested, the 2009 can I tasted from a few months back was among the tastiest non-BA imperial stouts I've ever tried. With just 18 months in the cellar, this one pours a deep, dark black with the viscosity of freshly changed motor oil cycled through a 30-year-old Buick for a few days. The nose reminds me of chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. At this point I'm reminded of how much the head lingers and contributes to the heavy lacing, presumably due to the heavy body. Flavor-wise, there's a good amount of sweetness, with baking spices, honey and brown sugar at the forefront. There's also some chocolate, some coffee and some lingering floral hops. I couldn't drink this exclusively, nor could I drink it all day, but for an occassional treat, it really hits the spot.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Smell: Malty, chocolate, boozy, slightly sweet, with a bit of hops in the background  Taste: Chocolate rounds out the bit of hops and sweetness from the malts, making for a balanced flavor from start to finish without any overtly dominant flavors. Notes of coffee are present but are never too bitter, as are the hops. Notes of dark fruits like dates and raisins are present and round out the bitterness. Very good RIS and among the best i've ever had. The fact that its out of a can is insane. Would pick this up often if it were always available.  Feel: Slightly thick, nice addition to the notes of chocolate and coffee. Really perfect and velvety.  Overall: Would pick this up all the time if it were readily available. Pricey, but a must-try for any doubters in regards to how great cans are. This brew is a testament to how far craft has come in complexity of flavor in such a seriously intricate style. IN A CAN.

Although it is exorbitantly expensive, I have always heard rave reviews about this beer. Hopefully this goes better than the last few times a beer got overhyped. Side poured from the can into a Chimay goblet.  Appearance - Pours a motor oil black with an impressive mocha colored one finger head that displays excellent retention and leaves amazing lacing. I love the packaging, and the beer itself presents very well.  Smell - Smells of strong malty sweetness, alcohol, licorice, roastiness, and chocolate, among other things. Very appealing.  Taste - Even better than the nose. All of the above mentioned flavors coalesce into one of the best RIS's I have ever tasted. Totally exceeded expectations.  Mouthfeel - Finishes big, rich, creamy, sweet, with just a touch of bitterness and alcohol warmth. Amazing.  Overall - This beer totally exceeded all expectations. Probably the best RIS I have had, and one of the top ten production beers I have drank ever. Although the price can be a turn off, it is worth the coin to grab a four or six pack of these.

2681,34483,Genie,4.22,"I could smell the dark fruit but it took some effort to sniff it out even when using a snifter. It also makes a pretty lacing on the glass. It's very smooth as described, but I could only taste hints of chocolate and coffee. Despite it's high IBU, it was not as bitter as I thought it would be. The more forward taste was the roasty malt flavor and it was not a scorchy roast, but a pleasant roasty flavor. It is quite strong, so I did have to take a break from it, but then it got warm and didn't taste as good when it was colder.  Canning date: 12/15/2014 I drank this on 03/09/2015.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Roast coffee scent but also vanilla-like sweetness. The carbonation gives the beer some texture. Coffee taste with bitterness in the finish. Very good beer.

2681,34483,ThaneMcC,4.5,"Pours like motor oil out of the can with thick brown head. Smells of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, ripe dark fruit (plums/prune). Tastes sweet up front with a tangy, smoky malt with a hint of coffee, dark chocolate, and a bit leathery and smoke. Hops balance the sweetness with a pleasant mid note bite. Full bodies, creamy, a bit syrupy but not unpleasant – sweet finish. Overall a great winter warmer, meant to be sipped and savored. I was really surprised by how good it was, and I will make this a go to for warming up on a cold day.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

I've had this in the taproom before, and, while it was good, I don't recall it being this good. Perhaps my tastes have matured. Whatever the case, this was a real treat...a perfect beer to sip on. I don't detect the smokiness that others have described (""not that there's anything wrong with that"")...just roastiness, as expected and appropriate, with some very earthy notes. I'm not a big fan of sweet beers, but this one manages to tread the line...I'm almost turned off by it, but yet it still manages to be so good.

Drinkable, and more importantly enjoyable, throughout with plenty of flavour packed into the can whilst managing to keep a good balance too. For an imperial stout I didn't think the beer was overly complex but I did like it, I just don't think it's one I'm likely to return to all that often since there are several other American brewed imperial stouts out there that I prefer to this one.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

It even leaves sticky lacing on the sides of the glass! I don't think I've had an Imperial stout, apart from this one that had such great retention and actually left lacing on the glass! On the nose there's lots of Roasty Malt notes, Coffee, Chocolate and a light bit of Alcohol in the background. How does this beer taste? Where do I start?! Smokey flavours, Raisins, Roasty Coffee and Chocolate notes, Light toffee and a touch of sarsaparilla and molasses on the finish.

Thin, fine-beaded lacing adorns the glass walls.  Aroma: Strong and sweet vinous alcohol dominates the aroma, along with charred malt, coffee, bitter cocoa, and wood.  Taste: Opens with a wave of roasted dark malt and cold coffee. Bitter cocoa soon follows. Sweet alcohol is omnipresent. Later in the taste, oak notes appear. The hops are quite restrained, with just a hint of herbal flavors. Finishes with lingering coffee, bitter cocoa, and sweet alcohol.  Mouth feel: Smooth, very full and soft, with just a hint of carbonation.

T (4.25) - This beer tastes pretty good. It's not especially bitter, and not overwhelming roasted (read burnt). I get some alchol taste on the finish, which isn't too surprising. F (4.25) - The mouthfeel is fairly smooth. A little thick at the same time. About right here. O (4.25) - So I'm not quite digging the Oskar beers. But I do like this one.

Starts with bittersweet chocolate, dank raisins, slight burnt coffee, smoke. Leads into an almost soggy wood taste finish that drags out and is quite unpleasant. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy.

A little alcohol warmth down the throat but certainly not hot.  M: Very full mouthfeel, appropriate carbonation. Overall quite creamy and not too sharp.

2681,34483,Jeffreysan,5,"12 oz can, poured into a goblet.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful, completely opaque, pitch-black color with a half of a finger of caramel-colored head that quickly dissolved into a halo of foam that gripped the sides of the glass and formed a few wispy clouds of foam that settled atop the beer.  Aroma: I’m stuffed up at the moment (I know that being in that condition is not ideal for reviewing a beer) so I’m not getting much out of the aroma, but other reviewers have noted aromas of roasted malt, bitter chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, subtle smoke, subtle licorice and boozy alcohol.  Taste: Brilliant!! Massive roasted malt up front, imparting notes of toasted dark bread, some subtle coffee notes and smoke, followed by tons of brown sugar-like sweetness, a touch of dark chocolate, a touch of licorice, and a touch of floral hops. Absolutely delicious!!  Mouthfeel: Chewy and smooth as silk as there is no carbonation what-so-ever. With an ABV of 10%, there is quite a pleasant alcohol warmth on the palate.  Overall: Wow, just wow!! What a beer! What a stout!! MASSIVE, bold flavors, all wrapped up in an extremely smooth and creamy beer.

The flavor follows the nose, the rich roast is still the most predominant flavor, followed by chocolate.

I bought a couple more cans that are going to the cellar for another couple of months. I don't think it can get any better, but you never know....  UPDATE: OK, so I cellared a few cans. Drank two of them kinda right away, but the third one? ""Another couple of months"" turned into 18 months! Still pours an oily viscous black with a wicked tan head. The chocolate is still dominant, but it has morphed into dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate. The booze is way subdued - virtually no burn at all. Slightly bitter finish lingers.

Holy crap, what the heck is this??? Dark, deep robust, all the favors others describe. Dark look, nice pour, strong but smooth dark stout taste. This immediately became one of my top 5. Amazingly well made beer, like liquid oil bliss in a can. I've had others of similar style, but this one stands out. I have since become a huge fan of Oskar Blues, almost all their beers are well made for each style.

This is so crazy good. The 98 IBUs and the 10.5% ABV are WELL hidden. BE WARNED! Let's this warm up a bit to cellar temperature! If you drink this ice cold you WILL get a metallic taste and it WILL go away entirely of you allow it to warm a little bit. O - An AMAZING, 10 star stout, easily makes my too 5 stouts list.

So thick and dark you cannot tell the carbonation level, but the head retention suggests fairly active. Smells of oatmeal, brandy, and decadent dark chocolate. On the nose, coffee and cream. Mid-palate some acidic coffee-- Ethiopian and Kona. Back palate deep cocoa and cooking chocolate-- heavy, deep, and bitter but not overwhelming. Tartness plays well against malty bread notes. Deep toffee. Vanilla. Some pepper and cream. So much going on. Every sip is another level. This is brilliance. This is the work of the Beer Gods. I'm finding hops and esters. Some raisins. A little brandy. Some oak and some smoke. The rabbit hole is deep. The alcohol is subtle. The smoothest stout at this ABV. Then the ABV hits your brain. Warm fuzz. Warm chest. I could go on.

Smell is a bit weak but roasted malts do come through.  T: this is where Ten Fidy shines. Dark roast malts, chocolate, vanilla, and some coffee. Flavors are very well balanced throughout and no flavor overpowers the others.  M: thick and rich. A little like heavy cream with a long lingering coat on the tongue.

Tastes of very rich dark roast malts, coffee, dark chocolate and a Medium carbonation with full body. Dark malt, coffee and dark chocolate with a light pine on the aftertaste. A very light pine resin left on the lips. I do not really detect any booze which is impressive with 10.5% abc.

2681,34483,SitkaSteve,4.46,"Christmas gift. Can dated November 7, 2013. This was poured into a snifter. The appearance, well, it poured like motor oil and had the same color body - pure jet black motor oil. A one finger white to off white foamy head dissipated into oblivion after about a good thirty seconds. Light speckled to spider web lacing stuck around the glass. The smell had a big boozy roasty chocolate to light coffee arranging itself nicely around the base of the beer. The taste was pretty much the same with a long lingering roasty chocolate aftertaste. Light sticky wet finish. The mouthfeel sat about a medium on the body with a good sipping quality about it. Roasted chocolate to coffee notes roll over my tongue. Overall, hot damn, this stuff is absolutely awesome. I can only imagine what this RIS is like when fresh.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Very thick and dark with a somewhat small head that is deep brown. Smells of everything a great stout should smell like, coffee, dark chocolate, and slight hops. Taste is the same. Everything is balanced wonderfully and I can't wait to get some more. Thanks Oskar Blues",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S: Good, but not what I was expecting. Lots of dark fruit and dark candy. Also a great amount of licorice. Not quite the chocolate bomb that I was hoping for.  T: Follows the nose. Plenty of licorice and dark fruit. Back of the palate is very bitter as well. Overall still a good beer, just slightly less than expected.  M: Very thick and creamy. Great.  O: Good beer but not as good as I was expecting. More dark fruit and licorice than chocolate and toffee.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Almost slippery feeling on my tongue (like you ate a bar of chocolate) with just a slightly bitter after taste.  O = LOVE it.

2681,34483,threeviews,4.5,"12oz can (Canned on 8/25/14) poured into a 16oz Belgian snifter/globe glass.  A- Pours a viscous, used motor oil black. The head was nothing more than a 1/2-finger's worth of a mocha colored head which disappeared as quickly as it formed. No light passes, even at the edges of the glass. (5.0)  S- Not explosive, but very complex of which builds as it warms. Molasses, Caramel, Anise, Milk Chocolate, Coffee and a fruitiness that is reminiscent of a plum or cherry. No alcohol in the nose. Although it is a bit more pungent (operative word: thick), it is somewhat reminiscent of Stone's Russian Imperial Stout. (4.25)  T- Milk chocolate sweetness attacks the palate first. Mid-palate is met with a dark roasted malts and that 'fruity' note...no doubt courtesy of the heavy handed dose of hops (98 IBU) and/or the yeast strain employed. It finishes with a very baker's chocolate/espresso astringency. As it warms, the 10.5% ABV is felt in the chest on the way down. (4.5) M- Consumes the palate from front to back. This is a full-bodied beer that makes it a bonafide sipper. (4.5)  O- Undoubtedly a fantastic imperial stout, but at nearly $4 a can, the value (or lack thereof) is hard to justify against other stouts (some barrel aged and/or brewed with adjuncts) in the same category. However, if you are in the mood to treat yourself, Ten FIDY is certainly worthy of a try. (4.5)",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Taste is very creamy with some sweetness, roasted coffee(espresso) and some toasted chocolate(just to the edge of burnt, but not).

Abundant milk chocolate brown head with excellent retention.  Silky mouthfeel, creamy and almost nitro level smoothness out of a standard 12 oz can. Amazing job by the masters of craft beer canning.  The nose is definitely boozy, and there's a bit of a black licorice thing happening. Molasses on the nose. Big roasted malts commensurate with the style. Subtle dark chocolate note as it lingers in the mouth, very nice. A moderate drying effect on the sides of the tongue after each sip that is extremely pleasant.

2681,34483,m_hall,4.88,"Poured from a 12oz. can (a can!) into a tulip glass. This is not a dark beer... this is BLACK. Midnight black. Outer-space black. Satanically black. It actually seems to pull in the light from around it... holding it up to a light, nothing penetrates. This inkiness is topped by a thick two-finger chocolate-colored head that fell slowly to a cap that left a cobweb of sticky lacing on the glass.  Aromas of coffee and toast are very apparent, a subtle earthiness, as well as tangy hop notes, vanilla, and alcohol.  The flavor of this is impossibly complex... the expected espresso, chocolate, and toasted bread notes are immediately perceived, with a touch of molasses fighting for attention in the background as a titanic wave of pungent hop bitterness sweeps in, somehow managing to harmonize with the lingering, almost ash-y roasted malt notes and warming alcohol. Even with the strapping 98 IBU bitterness rating, it all seems just right given everything else that's going on here. Subtle? No, but wonderful just the same.  The mouth-feel is rich and full-bodied, but with a surprising amount of carbonation lending it a tingle that keeps it from being syrup-y. It's not something you're going to quaff with abandon, but at 10.5 ABV that would be a foolhardy proposition in any case.  This is a true classic among Imperial Stouts, a masterpiece... powerful, uncompromising, demanding, this is the Death Metal of beers, and much like that musical genre not for everyone's taste, but very rewarding for those willing to explore its dark depths.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The taste was divine with espresso and chocolate in the beginning with slight bitterness before coming into a semi-sweet toffee like middle.

Absolutely adored this beer, a must try.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TheItalianStallion,4.46,"Poured from a 12oz. can into a tulip  A: Pour is pitch black with a huge, rocky head of brown foam. Head sticks around for a few minutes and eventually settles to a thin crown that leaves lots of lacing. This beer is BLACK and does not let a single ray of light pass through it.  S: Aromas of roasted malts with a bit of hoppy citrus zest. Chocolate and molasses come out as the beer warms. Trace amounts of vanilla and some alcohol also there.  T: Massive flavors of roasted/burnt malts and miniscule amounts of chocolate with a boozy finish. Occasional hints of molasses and anise. Plenty of hops are used being this beer is 98 IBUs, which is hard to believe because they are hidden behind the insane amount of malt. Alcohol is detectable, but not overwhelming.  M: This beer is the definition of full bodied and has an unbelievably viscous, creamy mouthfeel that seems to coat your tongue. Carbonation is low, and there is a bit of an alcohol bite on the finish.  O: This is a huge beer with big flavors of roasted malts and an alcohol presence throughout. A hefty 98 IBUs, but I smelled the hops more than I tasted them, personally. If you like massive imperial stouts you will definitely fall in love with this beer. Something nice to slowly sip on all night.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The head is a brilliant milk chocolate that leaves behind an inordinate amount of lacing, the nose and flavors are extremely dark and inviting. The pitch black motor oil body goes down thick and viscous, creating a luxuriously intense yet creamy experience. Any sweetness is backed up with a good amount of coffee/cocoa bitterness to make sure it never approaches cloying. This is a must try, and grab a whole 4 pack well you're at it.

This is Stout and dark beer season and that is a good thing. Ten Fidy is a true treat of roasted chocolatey goodness. The smell is amazing, but not quite as good as the taste. Lots of roast, chocolate, molasses, coffee and a hop presence that cuts through this like a spotlight on a dark night. It looks like a glass full of black paint with a nice rich brown head that leads to some very full lacing. The mouthfeel is thick, just what I want from a stout. You can tell that there is alcohol, but it's partially hidden behind the rich smoky flavors. The dark night just got a little warmer. This is very complex and best of all, very enjoyable.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,LambicPentameter,4.22,"Enjoyed out of a 12 oz can from which I forgot to get any dating information before recycling it. That said, I know for a fact this can is from last year (2013), so it's just about a year old at this point. Poured into a large 33 oz snifter glass.  Appearance (4.25) - It's hard to think of any way to describe the look of this beer other than motor oil with about a finger of ecru-colored chocolate mousse resting on top. It's the kind of brown that's so dark that there is no point in even trying to distinguish between the shad and true black. It matches the black on the can. The head is about a finger thick and slowly fades away to leave a film across the surface of the film and flecks of lacing here and there on the sides of the glass.  Smell (4.0) - Initial aromas are all varieties of roasted and toasted malts. Dark notes of burnt toast and char along with some more subtle elements of baker's chocolate and even hints of what reminds me of coffee grounds, but the variety that has been ground awhile ago, leaving them without the distinct coffee bean pungency.  Taste (4.25) - The promises of the smell are all delivered with interest--rich notes of semisweet chocolate and notes of bitter char and roasted grain are again front and present. There are also more earthy profiles of damp soil and soggy tree bark, even a bit of dried tobacco, albeit fleeting. It's relatively sweet, but not the cloying, toothache inducing kind of sweet.  Mouthfeel (4.25) - Full bodied and viscous, with a weight just like it's motor oil appearance. Moderate carbonation to counteract it from becoming sludgy. Semisweet and lingering finish on the tongue.  Overall (4.25), a fantastic beer and easily the best big, bold russian imperial stout in a can that I've had. This would be a great nightcap to have around the fire after a day of camping and drinking more heat-friendly canned beers in the sun. As the night comes over and the air starts to chill, whip out your can of Ten FIDY, pour it into your metal mess kit cup and sip away by the light of the fire.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,gibgink,4.75,"Other reviewers get the appearance, taste, etc. correct, so let me add this. This is THE standard that all other imperial stouts should be judged. It has all the characteristics of an imperial, and does them very well.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,1000lbgrizzly,3.94,"A: Oily black body, deep tan creamy, but thin, head. Weak lacing, quickly disappears. Good appearance of the can.  S: Dark chocolate and unmolested coffee, very bitter and slightly acidic. Some soapiness.  T: Roasted malt, loose structure of chocolate and coffee, molasses? Alpha acids play a minor part in the lasting bitterness. Alcohol adds a disappointing chalky note.  M: Thick, kinda heavy, light but sufficient carbonation.  O: Good, but nothing that knocks me over. Solid flavors but nothing that goes above and beyond. For such a sturdy and highly acclaimed beer I'm surprised I don't have more to say. Still the best from a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,UrbanCaveman,4.79,"12 oz can, poured into a bowl at approximately 50 degrees F.  A: Pours almost exactly like used motor oil (much like the eponymous brew from Harviestoun), a syrupy black with dark brown highlights. Once in the glass, that's it for any glimmer of light getting through it, save perhaps a little through the thick brown head. Said head stays around a while before collapsing slowly and gracefully into a cap and thick ring.  S: Rich dark chocolate right up front, over a malt bouquet composed of blackstrap molasses and toffee-sprinkled bread. Fruit wafts through the aroma as well, cherry and plum, and there's more than a little suggestion of a scotch or bourbon whiskey.  T: Bitter baker's chocolate meets dark-roasted grain for a morning duel amidst the backdrop of an orchard of plum and cherry trees, still ripe with morning dew soaking into wet earth. Mild sweetness alternates with earthen, roasty bitterness, forming a well-balanced and lush flavor experience. Malt notes abound, from toffee to cocoa to molasses, all wound around over-ripe fruit and grounded in a mix of black earth and wet tree bark, finishing with a warm glow of alcohol.  F: Full, thick, creamy, and smooth, this brew clings to the teeth and tongue as if it has suckered tentacles. Carbonation seems mild, just present enough to keep the beer from feeling flat.  O: This is the first Oskar Blues product I have actually enjoyed, but it is a phenomenal one. This encompasses most of the experience I want from an RIS, and I'd be hard pressed to say what, if anything, is lacking.  Update 17/3/2015: I was recently able to try the 2013 edition, aged for over a year. Age mellows out the earthy notes, and replaces them with more dark fruit and some metallic tang. This ages well.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Like used motor oil. Looks delicious. 5 S. Smells of roasted malt toffee, coca, slightly bready, like brownies. Little alcohol. 5 T. Oh hell yah, magic in a can. Taste the same as it smells but with hints of coffee. Also taste like a brownie with nestle quick sprinkled on top. Awesome. 5 M. Thick, chewy, syrup, that doesn’t fill you up. Very little heat from the alcohol. 5 O. Very, very good. Go get some. I love that it comes from a can.

2681,34483,JasW,4.7,"Quite simply the finest stout one can ever hope to come across in this life. Words do not do it justice. So while I can wax poetic about its oil-like pour, the alluring brown head, the notes of chocolate, coffee, tobacco, and what can only be called ambrosia, and the smoothest, richest mouthfeel this side of Kathmandu, I'll refrain, and return to enjoying this true nectar of the gods.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,EHopkinsi,5,"Un-friggin-belieavably fantastic beer.  Had a 12 oz. can from the Brevard, NC brewery that was just under two months old. Served in a run o' the mill pint glass.  Poured with the look and consistency of dirty motor oil. One finger head eventually settles down to about a third of that and lasts the whole beer. Foam doesn't lace, but rather blankets the glass. Foam is thick enough you could put a sheet over it and sleep on it. Smells delightfully chocolatey, with some light fruit notes. Cherry, maybe?  Mouthfeel is an unbelievably creamy, almost buttery. Taste is phenomenal- malt, chocolate, coffee, and that possibly-cherry fruitiness to it. Enough hop bite and alcohol to get your attention.  I'm not a stranger to beer, but I am pretty much a noob when it comes to evaluating and defining the qualities of beer. I didn't figure I'd ever rate anything a 5, but there's just no way to ding this beer. I know what I like in beer, and what makes for a good stout.  This is without doubt not only the best stout I have had in 3 decades of dabbling; it is hands down the best beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Lots of chocolate but somehow not too sweet. Great stout bitterness on the finish. To date it is the best stout and probably the best beer I've ever had.  I recommend drinking it fresh. I had a few cans that were over a year old. With age, the dark fruit takes over the aroma and taste and it becomes a different beer altogether. I prefer the chocolatey awesomeness of a fresh can.

2681,34483,Bone53,4.55,"Appearance (4.75): A super thick pour results in pitch black motor oil consistency with a half finger to a finger of brown mocha colored head  Smell (4.5): Big, bold dark chocolate and roasted/molasses malt notes, dark fruits, with a undertone of lactose. Slight alcohol in the nose as well  Taste (4.5): Big chocolate notes upfront, caramel malts in the middle, and a roasted malt finish with a slight hop presence in the aftertaste  Mouthfeel (4.5): Full and viscous body that coats the mouth; The alcohol is present as well as slight to moderate bitterness  Overall (4.55): This is a big beer, but not as big as i remembered. I would prefer a little more roasted malt and less bitterness-- that's nitpicking though. At $17 a four pack, i could do better for the price such as Founders.

2681,34483,2014LM2X1,4.75,"This is my favorite Imperial Stout. Its appearance is stunning - PITCH black and with a beautiful dark khaki head. It has a HUGE amount of all the flavors and aromas that you expect from an Imperial Stout - dark chocolate, coffee, earthy hops on the finish. Ten FIDY balances these flavors extremely well. What sets this beer apart for me is the mouthfeel and the alcohol burn. It has a thick, velvety mouthfeel that has no equal in my experience. The alcohol is hidden by the huge malt bill, but you can feel it burn ever so slightly. Ten FIDY has absolutely mastered this understated burn; it's tantalizing and entices you to keep sipping it. I often take 2 or more hours to get through 12 ounces; it's worth it to savor it as long as you can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,Buschyfor3,4.57,"Updated Review – 10/12/14 Serving 12oz can, dated 09/30/13, served in a chalice.  If there was one area where I thought Ten Fidy had room for improvement, it was drinkability – it was a touch boozy on the back end, a bit too much fusel alcohol for my liking. Let’s see what a year has done.  A: Viscous, inky black pour; nearly opaque, with just a hint of cola-like highlight near the edge of the glass; 2 fingers of dark khaki head forms on a vigorous pour, but recedes to a smaller collar of foamy bubbles and an oily sheen on the surface - not quite the same head retention as I observed from the fresh can, but nonetheless this stout looks quite the dark, imposing part; clings to the side of the glass, with sticky lace.  S: Initial aromas seem toned down slightly, but all the usual suspects are present – roasted malts, dark coffee, breakfast toast, with a bit of char; sweeter aromas of dark chocolate, a good helping of brown sugar, and some dark fruit rise forth in balance; as the stout warms, a vinous note peaks through, walking a fine line between red wine and a rum-raisin like note; really, outside of this vinous note, the alcohol remains rather in check on the nose, even after it warms to near room-temp – nothing of the stinging, fusel note I remember from a fresh can.  T: Where do I start with the complexities? Dark, sticky sweetness kicks things off - bittersweet dark chocolate dominates on the front of the palate; there are also a flashes of brown sugar and some dark fruit too – a boozy, rum-raisin like note; the roasted notes then step up to take an edge off of the sweetness, with dark coffee and burnt toast taking charge – like a good morning’s breakfast; however, the sweet flavors cannot be held in check for long, and a second surge showcases a fudge-like quality mixing with a faint hint of creamy vanilla; finish begins to dry out, and starts with a strong nutty flavor before easing into a residual day-old coffee flavor that lingers long after each sip; my only knock against this stout when it was fresh was that it was quite boozy on the palate late on – but that’s not the case with a year of age on the can; the only presence of alcohol comes through the vinous/rum-raisin note, but doesn’t carry any fusel alcohol sting (or heat) with it.  M: No change here – full bodied; low carbonation makes for a thick, frothy, slightly chewy and a commanding weight on the palate.  O: Age has been kind to this imperial stout. Perhaps a touch milder on the nose, but the upshot is that the complexities on the palate abound, and the drinkability is much improved – the 10.5% ABV is not nearly as present as it was in a fresh can. Sublime. Still, this is the best imperial stout in a can, and age has made it even better.   Original Review – 01/19/14 Serving: 12oz can, dated 09/30/13, served in a standard pint glass  A: Thick, oily pour; pitch black, opaque, like you expect from a big, bold imperial stout; head retention is impressive for a high gravity stout – a good 2 fingers of chocolate milk colored foam perches atop the glass, and stays intact for a couple of minutes; head finally settling out to a collar; this stout coats the glass – it is thick, and leaves a sticky sheen of lacing.  S: Roasted malts, warm coffee, dark chocolate and dark fruits are the predominant aromas on the nose; as the beer warms, the alcohol becomes more noticeable – a fusel/medicinal like note that slightly stings the nostrils.  T: Starts off sweet – bittersweet baker’s chocolate, brown sugar, and raisins; then the roasted notes from the nose perk up to add some balance in the form of heavily roasted malts and black coffee; finish starts with powdered cocoa sweetness that gives way to a slightly nutty, toasted flavor; a warming, boozy flavor comes on strong late on, with a bit of sting and growing heat.  M: Full bodied, for sure! Thick, chewy; coats the palate and settles on the tongue with a firm, weighted presence; low carbonation obviously contributes to the heavier mouthfeel.  O: What can I say about this imperial stout? Easily the best canned imperial stout in the world. Possibly one of the best canned beers of any style, for that matter. Massively complex, expertly showcasing huge roasted notes alongside sweeter touches of chocolate, molasses and dark fruits. If there is room for improvement, it's with regard to drinkability – a huge, boozy wallop comes on late and arrests the palate with a blast of fusel alcohols, making this a sipper for sure. But what a sipper this is. A bit of aging may mellow out that alcohol sting, but even drinking fresh, I highly recommend Ten Fidy. Don’t let the higher price point ($14.99-$16.49/4pk, locally) deter your purchase – this imperial stout is very much worth the cost if you can find it.

2681,34483,dmgeng,5,"This beer came highly recommended by my home brewing mentor and I had to try it.  A - Deep dark black that basically looks like used motor oil. It pours thick with dark brown creamy head and strong lacing.  S - Tons of of sweet malt smell with roasted, chocolate, caramel, and some toffee notes radiating out. No discernible hops but the elixir sucks you in.  T - The first sip you are overwhelmed with tremendous flavor having a very pungent character of malty, roasty, chocolaty, and some toffee/caramel taste. There is some alcohol but with so much other flavor there is no detriment. The roasted bitterness is strong too allowing the balance of sweetness and bitterness to make your taste buds rattle in your jaw.  M - HUGE mouth-feel with light carbonation. Super thick and heavy not allowing your mouth to escape the amazing envelopment of the TEN FIDY. It isn't as overly sweet as some other stouts I've had and I would accredit it to the balance that the roasted black malt provides.  Overall, this is one of the best beers that I've ever tasted. So much flavor packed into every sip. This RIS is an extremely tasty brew. I know that there are some people out there that would have a hard time dealing with the thickness of this stout and the punch but I love it. I strongly recommend this RIS especially since it is easier to get and cheaper than some other amazing Imperials out there.  Tasting note: I've tried it at every temperature but I still think about 60 degrees F is optimal since it allows the aromatics to really come out of suspension.

Excellent beer, I will definitely drink it again. If you like stouts it would almost be criminal not to try this one. Two thumbs up as this beer definitely pushes the envelope.

2681,34483,SportsandJorts,4.15,"Mini vertical, one canned two weeks ago, one canned one year ago. Reviews mainly for fresh with some differences on aged version  Appearance: pours a pretty thick black, very little change in color even around the edges. a finger or so of a dark tan head with slightly weak retention, but leaves a pretty nice lacing on the sides. completely opaque. Year old version almost identical just with a smaller head. 3.75/5  Smell: super strong and sweet chocolate. Lots of notes of dark and roasted malts, hinting at espresso. Some smaller notes of earth and maybe some hops but hard to separate those out from the bitterness of the roast. Alcohol seeps in throughout the smell. Year old version begins to develop a strong caramel sweetness that starts to block out the burnt malts, and the alcohol starts to fade. 4/5  Taste: opens with strong chocolate, a mix between milk and dark. Lots of sweetness to it. The sweetness is quickly thrown away as it develops into a strong roasted and burnt grain taste, along with some espresso in it. Towards the end there are notes of earth and maybe some oak. Alcohol plays a strong role. Slight metallic twinge from time to time. Year old version again developing a strong caramelized grain to toffee taste very similar to what is often found in old ales. Alcohol still a small factor. 4.25/5  Mouthfeel: heavy and a bit sticky. bitterness tends to stick around quite a bit. alcohol warmth. 4/5  Overall: definitely a well brewed and big stout. lots of tasty dark malt character and a wide variety of malts.

There's notes of oak and a hint of booze, vanilla, and and a subtle hint of red wine. 4.25  Thick layers of chocolate, vanilla and caramel are almost like drinking a milkshake. Just a boozy one, as again there's a bit, a tiny bit, of wine-like booze flavor. There's a dose of oak on the finish. 4.6  Superbly creamy, viscous, smooth and rich, this is a dessert in a can.

The aroma wasn't as pronounced as I expected but the beer may have been a bit too cold which could affect that. What I did gather was leather/tobacco and some coffee. Taste was like the smell but much more noticeable. Coffee, leather, tobacco with a coffee finish and aftertaste. The feel was what a RIS should be: smooth, thick and velvety.  Suggested food pairing: Teriyaki chicken  If you like this beer then you should also try: Rasputin  Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I would likely drink it again) This beer got better as it warmed up and it really hits all the marks for what a stout should be.

S: Complex: Tobacco, coffee beans, chocolate, wood, leather, a hint of cherry, roasted nuts, wonderful smell  T: Immediate hops, wood, cappuccino, roasted nuts, dark chocolate. Taste follows the main smells in the nose, but not as complex. Definitely an imperial stout as you get the taste of alcohol  M: Smooth carbonation, with an alcohol bite  O: Great beer! Very complex but light tasting at the same time. Although it's light tasting, this is a strong beer and alcohol is prominent. I think this would be a great first beer followed by a regular stout.

Well balanced dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, and a hint of licorice. Hops? I guess so but well integrated to taste like part of the coffee flavor (so they are light). The maltiness is perfectly positioned. A real sipper, well mannered when warming up and a pleasure to have a ‘beefy’ stout that is on the edge of the chocolate/malt precipice without going over. Not a bold taste by any means, but a refined, smooth, and rich taste that is not for the faint hearted but a must try for anyone who understands stouts. What can make it better? I don’t know so it gets an A+ in my book.  Parting thoughts – Really expensive but probably worth the money.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,etmur007,3.41,"Not really my thing. The taste is overwhelming and not all that enjoyable. I struggled to finish the can. With that said, my friend who finished it loved the beer. I would personally recommend against this, but given its high rating most people disagree with me. To each their own.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,leroybrown10,4.42,"Pours a deep light trapping black. Looks super thick. Head is thick and looks almost chewy. It's a deep khaki color and dissipates grudgingly. Fine lacing lingers around the top of the glass.  Smells of rich roasted malt. Coffee, chocolate, hazelnut, dark cherry and plum are noticeable as well.  Tastes of roast malt even more than in the nose. Coffee and chocolate balance nicely. Some licorice and smoke come through as well. Hoppiness on the back end to counteract the heavy malt beginning.  Thick almost sludgy feel. Carbonation a bit more than I'd expect from a stout this thick and strong but still only slightly more what I'd consider mild.  This is a rich, complex beer that could dominate an inexperienced palate. A true pleasure to drink and an exemplary example of the RIS style.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SD-Alefan,4.63,"Poured from the 12oz. can into a snifter.  This amazing brew purs a deep, inky and oily black with about a one-finger head that fades into some lingering foam around the egde. Only a bit of spotty lacing.  The aroma is roasty malt -- the darkest of dark chocolate, roast coffee, rich black tea. There are also notes of dark dried fruit .  The taste is an assault on the tongue. Intense. Chocolate, a bit of sweet toffee and raising and then big, bitter dark chocolate. The lingering, drying bitter note on the tongue has hints of more chocolate and roast coffee and malty Assam tea.  The mouthfeel is creamy and sticky with a bit of carbonation as well.  Overall, just wow. This beer does not disappoint. One of the best stouts I've tasted.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ChestSplitter,4.93,"I thought I really liked this beer, but I recently got a case that was canned in 2013. Three years in the can has turned this into the best stout I have ever had. Ungodly smooth. You can't taste any alcohol at all, let alone 10.5%. The chocolate and coffee notes are perfectly matched -- no adjuncts to unbalance anything -- but the time in the can mellows this beer. There is none of the bitterness that most RIS's finish with. There are even hints of caramel. Unbelievably good. So when you buy this beer, sit on it if you can stand to do so.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,paskinsj,4.77,"Ten Fidy is possible the best imperial stout. Black darkness that is like motor oil. Pours with very little head.

It will sneak up on you!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Great beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ThePaintedGrey,4.63,"12oz. can poured into imperial pint glass.  A: Pardon my language, but HOLY SHIT this beer is DARK. There's no color, no light shining through during the iPhone flashlight test, and absolutely no highlights either. What. The. Hell. This brew is scary! A moderately vigorous pour results in a monstrous light brown head that's dense and creamy and takes ages to deflate. Leaves tons of lacing in its wake.  S: Delectably rich semi-sweet chocolate syrup and roasted malts up front create a boisterous and powerful aroma. A little bit of roasted coffee and Earthy hops come through as well. One of the most delightful aromas I've experienced.  T: This is unbelievable... These flavors are off the charts. HUGE waves of rich, decadent chocolate. Those Earthy hops creep in that add just enough bitterness to offset the chocolatey sweetness. The middle offers a few molasses-like notes, but primarily consist of the initial chocolate hop medley. It's all beginning to feel a little too sweet, but then... the finish offers a wonderful deviation from the candied bliss and transitions to an absolutely phenomenal freshly-ground roasted coffee. Bliss. Pure Bliss.  M: The body is full, and it might actually be more accurate to describe it as huge. The closest thing to a flaw I can find here is that it's not as creamy and rich as I had hoped and the carbonation is just a hair above my comfort level in a RIS, but even still, I can't drop it below ""outstanding."" Oskar Blues just knows what they're doing.  O: I'm having a hard time processing my thoughts into words right now... I've always held Stone's offering of this style in the highest regard, but I think it has been replaced. I don't know what the folks down at Oskar Blues are doing, but they're doing it right. Every aspect of this brew is so powerful and each flavor is so intense that it borders unbearable, but then it transitions into something new and it just all adds up to a divine experience. I'm simply in awe right now, and slightly sad that I've taken the last sip whilst typing my conclusion... If you haven't had this yet, stop what you're doing right now and buy it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,akeiii,5,I have had this awesome stout in cans and on tap. The first time I had it on tap I was skiing and as soon as I tried it I knew it was the best I had ever tasted. When I got home I went out to a pub and THERE IT WAS! Since then I discovered you could get it in cans (cans really? Normally I only look at bottles) and although you can't beat tap the cans are still better than whatever is in second.

S: Dark chocolate, raisins, coffee, vanilla, and hints of oak.  T: Similar to the smell, with a delightful bite from the hops and heavy ABV. There is a lot of dark chocolate and coffee flavors in this beer, giving it a powerful robustness. The flavors come out even more after it warms up some. Delicious.  M: Full-bodied and thick, though easy enough to drink. It gives you the impression that you're drinking some sort of black shake.  O: Easily my favorite regular imperial stout, excluding special spiced RISs like Westbrook's Mexican Cake. If you get a chance to buy some Ten FIDY, I would highly recommend you take it.

Creamy, balanced with a little sweetness, creamy, and the dark malt, breadiness, licorice, dark chocolate and any bitterness which is not overwhelming, all are in the background. I get banana too. It ends smooth, no bitter lingering in the mouth.  M: Bready and thick but does not stick to your mouth as its SMOOTH. Medium low carbonation, fits well with this beer.  O: Reminds me of Edmund Fitzgerald from Great Lakes which is an American Porter. There is not much complexity as say Old Rasputin’s or Samuel Smith’s version, but its good.

T- Thick liquid chocolate and the toasted malts shine through. A little caramel, toffee, and vanilla in the finish. Smoke definitely presences as is a touch of burnt toast.  M- Full bodied and creamy. Left some room between the pour in order to get a bigger head and ridden some of the carbonation. Once the head settled there was little carbonation, just like I enjoy my stouts.  O- My favorite offering by Oskar Blues and a top shelf stout. Best served a little below room temperature to get the full flavors out. Nice rich chocolate and smokey, burnt notes in this one.

Smell: Big roasted malts, fudgey dark chocolate, hint of peat, old library books, licorice, coffee, vanilla. Nice, big aroma.  Taste: Actually follows the smell pretty well. Roasted malts, dark chocolate fudge, licorice, vanilla, still some peat. Really nice chocolate malt-forward stout flavors. Really smooth for the ABV.  Mouth-feel: Relatively low carbonation with a thick, creamy body. Very nice for the style. Finishes smooth. A wee bit sticky.  Overall: This is a wonderful big chocolate-forward stout. The age has really mellowed it out nicely. Highly recommended, and grab some cans to sit on for a couple year.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Not quite as much chocolate evident in the taste as the aroma. The booze comes through decently in the taste, but at the same time they mange to mask it surprisingly well. Some slight hints of fruit.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly smooth. Full bodied. Decent amount of booze. Low carbonation. Not too hard on the mouth for such a heavy hitting Stout.

2681,34483,pinyin,3.23,"I had really high hopes for this one after seeing the BA score of 100, and the higher than usual price point for a 4 pack at my local Wegmans.  The Good: -smooth mouthfeel -fresh taste from the can -head and consistency are top tier for a stout -the color is very unique, looks like a burnt orange under certain lighting conditions  Dislikes: -Way too sugary for a stout -to me this tastes like a sweeter, stronger copy of Dragon Stout (Dragon Stout is also much better and much less expensive) -To me it seemed like they covered up the higher ABV% with too much fermented fig or rock rock sugar  This beer is just really sweet. Felt like drinking a sweet soda with 50MG of sugar. ( I don't mind a sweeter stout if it's a milk stout, but this formula doesn't work for me with the higher abv%.)  This a was interesting for a canned stout, but gets old fast and I gave away the other three cans from the four pack.  I much prefer Dragon Stout, Green Flash Speedway Stout, Keegan Mothers Milk, Bourbon County and Big Gruesome Peanut Butter Chocolate Stout(which is amazing).  Not worth the high price point or tooth ache inducing sweetness.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,humuloner22,4.49,"Love the can! Please people can more beer! That's my pitch, I avoided Oskar Blues for years then they moved into the neighborhood and I began trying various ones. This one I avoided because of cost and I wasn't a huge fan of stouts, but this poor store was going out of business and I got these babies for a dirt cheap price, I hate it for the store, but I am happy I got to try this beer for a more reasonable price. Its a great beer but not worth the $16-20 I have seen it priced for a four pack, I got this for substantially less than that. Its a great beer, no doubt, but I have a hard time spending the hard earned cash on a beer I had never tried and only get four for $16, at best.  Appearance: Dark as widows dreams, this stuff does not open to light, it sucks it in. Poured fairly aggressively and had a good finger or so of foamy brown head that just stayed there like a stiff peak of brownish egg whites.  Smell: Nutty, burned chocolate, a little bit of molasses but what you expect of a good RIS.  Taste: Man this beer tastes divine and I bet it gets even better with age and the fact that its in a can means as long as you don't screw it up with heat, this baby will last for damn near the end of days, at least my days, but I doubt I let it tarry that long. It has the perfect blend of chocolate, roasted malts, sweet but not too sweet, but not overly bitter either, you can get in trouble with this beer. Its very drinkable for its 10.5%. I also love that they didn't muck this one up with coffee or coffee and chocolate, the chocolate thing is alright, but I cannot stand the coffee infusion thing, and I am a a coffee drinker, but not in my beer, unless its a subtle thing, like Founders does. I may need to do a side by side comparison, but its going to be a cooler day for that. I have totally been into IPA's lately but since I was getting such a deal, I figured what the hell.

Full of roasted malt, dark fruits, sugary goodness, a bit of coffee... This is just a fantastic smell. It smells like a rich dessert.  And the taste follows through on the promise. Cocoa, plums and raisins, some coffee, big charred malt, a bit of hops... this is what an imperial stout should taste like. Everything is big, but nothing is out of whack. I suppose if you set out to find something to dislike here you could locate it, but you'd have to look hard.  Mouthfeel is as big as the rest of this beer. Thick , rich, oily, substantial. It fits perfectly.  I enjoy a good imperial stout. I like them any time of year, not just fall/winter. This is one of the best out there.

Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, toast, molasses, raisin, plum, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of big dark/roasted malt notes with light-moderate fruitiness; with good strength.

Good amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, caramel, molasses, light char, raisin, plum, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate fruitiness; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome imperial stout.

Lacing is impressive.  S- Powerful and enjoyable, I can't quite figure out what I'm smelling but I'm glad that I'm smelling it.  T- This is where this stout pulls away from the rest of the crowd. I am getting more of all of the flavors that I like in a stout. I'm definitely sensing a chocolate presence.  M- Smooth, sticky, and straight up awesome for a 10.5% ABV stout. It has a little fizz but it's not distracting from a perfect drinking experience.  O- I waited to review this until I had my second can. I'm glad that I did because in the interim I read the BA section on proper beer serving temperature. It took me 40 minutes at regular room temp (approx 70) to get this to 50 degrees.

No need to stick my nose in the glass (did anyway) to smell big burnt caramel malt and coffee smells. Smells of dark chocolate, vanilla and dark rum lasts throughout. Citrus, pine and whiff of astringent camphor roll in behind. The flavors match the aromas, yet that dark rum taste dominates. Tastes of coffee, toffee, are tempered ever so slightly with a metallic tang and tobacco taste. This is one very rich and velvety liquid. The body says, ""Gulp!"" The boozy smell and flavor says, ""swig!""",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Not a significant amount of head retention, but I wasn't expecting that. It forms a head around the sides of the glass and is barely there in the middle save for a few bubbles.  I'm a home brewer, and the aroma is exactly what I get when I come home from the homebrew store and stick my nose in a bag of freshly milled malted barley. Flavor is very roasty and complex with chocolate, coffee, and residual sweetness from the malt. The alcohol is definitely perceptible and is pleasantly warming. Some lacing on the glass (if I were talking about cloud coverage outside I would call it scattered). The hops is there, but enough to balance the amount of malt. It's hard to tell if the bitterness is roasted barley, an alcohol bite, or the hops itself. In any case the balance is more towards the malt.  This beer is exceptional.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Mightykingmalard,4.51,"I've had this a few times but I feel it is worth a review.  A: creamy mocha head. Lasts forever. Dark as night. Pitch black.  S: smells exactly like dark chocolate. Rich, dark dark chocolate.  T: perfectly smooth, perfectly balanced as an imperial stout. Burnt chocolate forward and slightly boozy.  M: creamy and chewy at the same time. If stew were an imperial stout, this would be it.  O: this is a fantastic imperial stout that is year round (right?) available. It's expensive so hard to keep keep a lot on hand but every single time it is a treat. Probably my favorite imperial stout that isn't barrel aged.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,mabermud,4.58,"Oh man! I am drinking this after drinking a Samuel Smith's Chocolate Stout. This is an amazing stout.  This stout is strong, tasty, thick, and robust, with sticky lacing.  A- Opaque. In the glass, this is an opulent looking beer. Solid black with a dark brown head that settles into a dark beige ring. The blackness absorbs the light. This is an incredible looking beer.  S- Sweet silly-putty smell.  T- Cocoa, molasses, malt, and faint coffee taste. Rich and concentrated. Subdued bitterness and a faint boozy after-taste. Very satisfying taste.  M- Thick, dense, and weighty. This stout definitely has some heft in the body.  O- A masterpiece.  This is better than Founders Breakfast Stout and better than Rogue Double Chocolate (Two of my favorites).  I will definitely grab a few of these to stow away for the future.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ljthiesse,4.27,"This was a very fresh can. Opaque black pour with a small creamy brown head - very pretty - and amazingly thick. Strong, sweet, boozy aromas of chocolate and coffee. Taste is a little boozy (might just be because it was so fresh), sweet and creamy, lots of chocolate and coffee with some vanilla and sweet fruits. The sweet notes are balanced by some bitterness though, making it well-balanced and not overwhelming. Very, very tasty, and one of the thickest stouts I've tried. Definitely a favorite.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,dar482,4.73,"The beer pours out like motor oil, extremely black and thick and coats the glass with brown.  The aroma has sweet chocolate, chewy brownie, a bit of dark sweet plum and fruits, almost a metallic along with lots of umami. Bitter molasses.  The flavor follows with bitter coffee in the front, a milk chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, a huge creamy luscious mouthfeel with a bitterness on the finish along with that molasses, and savory umami. A good amount of roast flavor with some dark roast on the back.  The beer blind won against Founders Imperial, and Stone Russian Imperial was a distant third. I would imagine this beer does wonders with age because the molasses, umami, metallic notes must die down. Truly one of the best beers one may find the shelf.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,nodder,4.28,"A- Pitch black with a one finger light brown head. No lacing to speak of.  S- Chocolate, corn syrup/molasses, coffee. A slight alcohol smell present.  T- Coffee is big. Chocolate also with a big malty backbone. Some bitterness and booze in the aftertaste. Very nice!  M- Heavy and creamy. Quite dry. The ABV is well masked.  O- I have heard great things about this beer and wasn't disappointed. Well done!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Swongler,3.97,"Obtained a few cans at Healthy Spirits in San Francisco. Great beer. Caned fall of 2013, opened 4/21/2014. Poured into a brandy snifter.  A - Black-Sharpie-black in color. Pours quite smoothly out of the can into a snifter that fits all 12oz plus head perfectly. About a finger and a half of brown-ish head. Beautiful pour.  S - Having a Japanese grandmother made me sensitive to the smell of soy/teriyaki. So, I DO smell the soy sauce/teriyaki that some people describe in the beer. It is a sweet sticky smell - which reminds me more of teriyaki than soy sauce. Smell of corn syrup, prunes, and coffee also linger quite nicely.  T - Soy is not nearly as present in the taste as it is in the smell. Toasted malty flavor comes forward with notes of coffee and licorice. That date taste comes through as well. Coffee mixed with burned/roasted coffee beans comes through as well. Earthy notes are minimal, but slight in mid-sip. Alcohol is hidden, but definitely a sipper.  M - Viscous. Coats the inside of your mouth. Heavy feel - something I am not necessarily used to coming out of a can. What can I say - something you might expect from an imperial stout weighing in over 10% ABV.  O - Great beer - especially for the price. A 4-pack in California can be found for roughly $12-$15. You'd expect a 22oz bomber in a glass bottle with this type of quality to come in around that price alone, but you get twice the beer for the same price with a 4-pack of this stuff. Fantastic quality for the value. I look forward to aging a can, and picking up some more.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

One of the best IS at hiding its abv.  M - not overly carbonated, thick enough but not cloying or chewy.  O - This was a good can. I've had the occasional bad can which were heavily soy saucy, but a good can of TenFidy is one of the best IS there is period. Hell, even beer's there are period. I'm not sure if the 7 months of age helped it's cause since I never really paid attention on my previous tasting.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S-Sweet roasted malts and alcohol. Mild chocolate nose.  T- Sweet roast malt, chocolate, boozy, great imperial stout. Very mild coffee acidity/bitterness in the finish.  M- Thick, syrupy, medium carbonation. mild alcohol burn.  O-Excellent beer.

2681,34483,larryarms847,4.5,"Pours thick and viscous with a very sturdy three finger head of frothy tan foam. Leaves sticky tan lacing that clings like molasses.  Toasted oats, roasted nuts, oak, chocolate, and notes of coffee.  Heavy roasted malts, earthy, bitter chocolate, and slightly burnt.  Heavy-bodied, medium carbonation, sticky, viscous, bitter, and chewy.  Overall, this has an amazing body and is wonderfully chewy, exactly what I look for in an impy stout, but aside from being dominated by roastiness, approaching burnt aroma and flavor, there isn't much else that makes this really stand out.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,HopintheSouth,4.59,"Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter, looks of spent motor oil! A dirty copper, light brown head even resembles such.  The smell brings on licorice, roasted coffee, and sweet chocolate. Very pleasant.  Subtly sweet with hints of chocolate and coffee. Almost like the best espresso I've ever had, minus the hop bitterness that bites as soon as it hits the tongue. Taste is right on key, and so drinkable at 10.5% abv. Amazing, it's hard to drink it slow!  It's smooth, silky, and leaves a coating almost like milk does in your mouth that stings of hops and the taste of roasted chocolate.  Very good stout, hand's down one of my favorites and glad I got to finally try it. If you can find one, drink it. Oskar Blues did a very good job here!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Kuaff,4.66,"Bought on April 12th, 2014, but canned on September 24th, 2012 (...?!). Enjoyed at cellar temperature in a snifter.  Inky blackness oozed out of the can and, darkly pooling in my snifter, created a one-finger head of mocha-brown froth. Beauty.  From the moment I cracked the can open my nose detected a downright lethal dose of chocolate. This is balanced and enhanced by a thwomp (yes, ""thwomp"") of rum-soaked raisins and prunes, with a touch of earthy vanilla. Notably chocolaty and fruity, like chocolate-covered raisins smell. The aroma also has a bit of a likeness to the dough of a sweet, dark rye bread.  The flavor is a maelstrom of intense chocolaty maltiness and roasty earthiness. And it has a depth of dark fruitiness I usually only get from Belgian strong dark ales. Simply sublime. Must be the age.  The feel is thick, heavy, and sticky... duh! Anyway, it's great.  Tremendously tasty.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Finger and a half of creamy toffee colored head, which quickly leaves a sticky lacing down the the glass as it dissipates. Has the look of my kind of Imperial Stout!  S- With the first dip of the glass to the nose, I got coffee, and a hint of soy sauce. Chocolate and roasted malts are also present. The appearance and smell have not disappointed. Onto the taste!  T- I've been waiting for this. Taste follows the nose very well. Coffee, chocolate. I didn't pick up on a soy sauce taste. A slight boozyness follows as the beer is swallowed. Very good! Has the taste of a barrel aged stout.  M- Slightly thick, creamy, very smooth. Leaves a bit of a sticky feel as the beer is swallowed.  O- Ten Fidy is a great beer, very good Imperial Stout! Even though this beer is 10.5 ABV, It didn't go down that way. Very smooth.

You don't have to mince your words trying to find an adjective for almost-black-but-actually-very-deep-dark-brown. Lacing does not hang around too long, leaving a cauldron of menacing black liquid in my snifter which is awesome.  S - For the first time ever I got a really heavy dose of that soy sauce odour which people talk about. Not a huge fan to be honest.  T - Almost getting a little bit of a sweet bourbon flavour which is cool as this isn't BBA. Burned treacle, soy sauce again. Not much smoke or peat. Moderate earth and mid-roasted malt. A little booze heat which has a warming effect. Pleasant but not mind-blowing.  M - A definite strong point. Pleasingly viscous. Nice and thick and faint carbonation.  O - Good to finally try the widely lauded Ten Fidy. I'd like to try a fresher batch which hopefully won't be as soy saucy.

Thick, creamy, and vicious is how I would describe this brew. My first Oskar Blues beer and I am impressed to say the least. Smells of coffee, vanilla, and maybe dark fruits. Tastes of chocolate, molasses, roasted malts, coffee, and some toffee. A chewy, sticky mouthfeel that is extremely easy to drink and oh so smooth. The ABV is very well hidden yet there is an alcohol burn that's present at the end. Oskar Blues hit this stout right out of the park.

Striking shiny ink black body. It almost looked like clumps were being poured out of the can.  Aroma: Lots of roasted dark malts. Smells papery/cardboardish. Some sweet stone fruit and alcohol. Brings to mind chocolate powder and cold chocolate milk.  Taste: Massive amounts of smooth roasted malts fading into a nice chocolate/coffee taste. More of the papery notes. Slightly smoky, almost savory chocolate. Some leathery raisins. Finishes with an herbal hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Huge, thick and heavy. Lots alcohol warmth, almost boozy. Low carbonation for what is one of the better mouthfeels I've had from a stout. Too bad it's so hot.  Overall: A memorable looking stout with a thick, heavy body. The notes of paper/cardboard were not too distracting and were starting to take on some nice nutty chocolate tones not unlike an aged barleywine/old ale.

Slight boozy taste - but not overpowering or out of place  M: Perfect. Very light on the tongue. Smooth and creamy. Made the beer ""feel"" about 15 degrees warmer than it was. Slight dry bite on the finish - but among the best mouthfeel beers I have had.  O: This beer lives up to its reputation. It is smooth and very drinkable.

It doesn't stop til it's a couple inches thick. It retains well, but as it dies, it thoroughly coats the glass in a sticky lace.  Everything about the beer is dark, even the smell. Dark roasted grains and expresso dominate the nose. While alcohol content is high, it hides from the nose. Hop presence is non-existant.  It tastes spectacular. Roasty grains, expresso are there, but joined by some chocolate nibs. Something sweet resembles sweet milk.  Mouthfeel takes you far from beer, more like a liqueur with it's thick, smooth and creamy feel. It's still grainy, but like an expresso. Lots of sweet, only enough bitter for balance and still, the alcohol is barely there. Full bodied. Faint heat in the finish with a lingering, smooth chocolate coating.

2681,34483,Smakawhat,3.83,"Poured from the can into a snifter, date Jan 15th 2014.  A real good pour brings a super dark mocha brown head, thick and rich and easily three fingers tall. Out of the can it's like motor oil still, and hits with an incredibly dark body of black walnut color with no see through quality at all. Real impressive and much better looking than last time.  Nose is a bit mixed with a bit of weirdness. Gone is some of the metallic sense, but a strange sweetness hangs over. It's sort of like a juicy candy, mixing with a faint hints of coffee and very thick rich char. Senses of jammy fruit really seem evident on it also. Quite enjoyable and a bit out of kilter in a fun way.  Palate though provides some interesting notes. There is a bit of twinge and jarring to this, and a sort of ferrous quality. It's really hard to describe. THe mouthfeel is incredibly thick and rich with a very slick oily quality to match bring lots of roast and char coating. Big leafy hop bitterness and matches with tobacco warmth. My fillings are tingling. Where is that thick fruit quality on the palate hinted on the nose?  THe experiences is somewhat similar from what I remember taste wise before, but there's more here on the delivery to explore, and certainly more to enjoy but my overall rating doesn't really change that much, although more positive.  ---- 12-09-2010 23:54:18 ---  4, 3, 3.5, 3, 3.5 [3.38]  Poured from the can into a pint glass resembling black motor oil, not much head but does give way to a coffee like chocolate brown bubbles. Head does disintegrate eventually and leaves no ring whatsoever.  Smell consists of faint leaf tobacco but also metallic... don't like that, but there are some very good noses on here but they are weak, faint roast, tiny alcohol heat on nose also. I really do like this nose I just wish it had removed some faults and wasn't so weak. Sometimes from a can I can get that metal/aluminum thing others times I don't, on this one I did.  Taste is syrupy, thick bodied, more so than I would prefer, with tobacco flavors, masking the alcohol well, some malt, with a good finish. There is also a very nice smoked meat/sausage quality on the afterfinish which is great. Luckily the metal/aluminum on the nose doesn't come through on the taste so much. I would like this more if it wasn't so syrup/thick in consistency.  Drinkability though all considering is better than average because there are things worth exploring in this brew for sure.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Brenden,4.61,"Given the name, I was really hoping this beer would live up to it, and it really does. Black as tar and almost as thick, this is one RIS that it's easy to tell will deliver. Definite motor-oil viscosity and heaviness means this will be the style as it was meant to be delivered. The medium brown head rises to a finger's height and slowly settles to an eventual half-finger and no further. Patching sticks thickly to the glass and with good distribution. Big roast, really big, and a touch of char hit the nostrils with a rich, chocolaty sweetness to counter it. There's no tang or astringency in the roast, either, the hallmark of a good RIS and difficult to pull off. Some coffee notes are present and a nice bit of hops just for balance, impressively curbed to let malts rule but still as huge as most DIPAs out there, just so much more packed into the aroma than seems possible. There's a touch of fruity sweetness on the end that seems to be from the alcohol, which is well masked otherwise. Coffee comes up first with lots of roast, a certain creaminess, and some wood. Dark fruits flash in the middle before it turns back to wood, staying with the roast into a lingering finish. Cocoa is bittersweet, and the hops presence is noted in a particular leafiness. Alcohol is really very well controlled. Smoke also comes into the finish. Thick and very, very rich, with smoothness that develops in layers but remains constantly creamy. While smoky, woody notes dry it out a little, malts and sweetness keep it semi-dry and a real pleasure to sip. With no indicator of the high alcohol, it would be easy for one to think he or she could drink more of these in a sitting than he or she should.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,buzzardman,4.35,"Aroma: Toasty chocolate malt, molasses, slight notes of the alcohol as it warms.  Appearance: Motor oil black, Nice tan head that drops to thin lacing.  Flavor: Toasted chocolate malt, a little cardboard oxidation.  Mouthfeel: Thick a little sticky but not syurpy, smooth with good carbonation.  Overall: Solid basic Imperial stout. The high abv is not noticeable until it warms up. Not much depth in the flavor which is why I say it's a good basic imperial, but overall it is a decent beer, would buy again but I do have many other favorites ahead of this stout. $14 for 4 pack of cans.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Keananmichael5,4.7,Great stout that is very oily and rich. I like when stouts are oily because of the coffee flavor and feel that they bring. This is great also as a flout because of its viscous and think pour,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A - Pours a thick ebony/oily colour with a nice tight coffee head that retains real well for an impy stout.  S - Nice balanced sweet vanilla and roasted malts.  T - Up front some damn smooth flavours of vanilla and caramel. The roast kicks in mid palate before some nice toffee and vanilla flavours finish off the back palate.

Head lingers for quite some time eventually settling into a billowy cloud.  S: Dark rich cocoa powder, sweet malts, ovaltine and finishes with notes of brown sugar. Hints of cocoa liquor.  T: Dark chocolate and coffee together with sweet malts and brown sugar. The sugar notes balance out the rich dark chocolate resulting in an incredibly smooth finish.  M: Thick, rich and chewy with minimal carbonation. Very smooth.  O: An amazing RIS which lives up to the hype.

2681,34483,Tsar_Riga,4.46,"A - Solid black, completely opaque. Head is substantial, brown, with a very slow fade to large bubbles then scattered lacing.  S - Booze is out front. Roasted malt and coffee, slight suggestion of sugared plums, subtle soy sauce, but a relatively restrained nose. Particularly when you think about the range the taste shows, how quiet this beer is in the lead up is surprising.  T - Alcohol is ever-present, but beneath the steady hum of booze are a broad array of stout tropes. Roast malt comes through first, with coffee and bitter chocolate filling in the middle, and a closing of hops with smokey hints of the roast and sweet dried fruits.  M - Surprising combination of thick, smooth, and creamy, but without becoming cloying. Some carbonation, but it is mild. Not much warmth given its nose and 10.5% namesake.  O - An impressive feat, this RIS is both a powerhouse and surprisingly drinkable. Ten Fidy delivers.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ZagZagg,4.49,"12oz can poured into goblet glass  A: Blackest, most opaque stout I’ve poured. Viscous as hell, strongly resembling crude oil, with some mean looking surface tension - Had a one finger mocha tan head that didn’t have too much retention. Too deep to access any carbonation – a beautiful froth that’s a brilliant bronze  S: Roasted malt, bitter chocolate, cola, light anise, coffee bean, smells nice and bitter, very sharp, burnt sweet caramel, black cherries and prunes/plum  T: Malt banger, super roasted, creamy mocha mixed with caramel spiced in anise warping the bitters. Middle mouth sets in after the initial hop collides head on with smoked/charred malt; the residual is a smooth candied cocoa. Subtle heat, shades of Godiva liqueur. Cacao nibs flushed with chocolate malts dominate and run the show, pushing the smoke-roasted bready notes.  M: Big body, CHEWY, oily and slick. Carbonation is mild; I don’t know how it moves through this level of viscosity. Leaves a nice layer in the mouth that’s candied and chocolaty.  O: This is easily the best imperial stout and certainly the densest I’ve had. It's fantastic - Brings roasty bitter chocolate malt to a whole new level. It sports some intimidating flavor, and it’s totally in your face. Delicious, looking forward to my three remaining cans and any others I happen to see, ever.  And I love the name, TEN FIIIDY.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,OneEye78,4.25,"Poured from a can into a wide mouth glass. Oil-black with a very small head. Smell is a bit smokey and bit of roasted grains. Taste starts with some chocolately sweetness followed by a little hoppy blueberry tartness, or maybe green apple. Mouth was similar to the look, thick and satisfying. A little hoppier than other stouts but enjoyable.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Qbdoo,4.38,"Pours black, black, black with a thick tan head. Scent is not super strong - coffee and roasted malts. Taste is similar with a touch of cola and bit of alcohol. Not over-roasted like some imperials. Nice balance of coffee, cola, chocolate and roasted malt. Texture is pretty sludgy (in a strictly good way), though there's a surprising bit of carbonation.

Smell - Very roasty, I'm getting coffee, lots of malts, bread, also there is some a nice alcohol presence as well.  Taste - Again such a roasty beer. Coffee, roasted malts, not getting much chocolate. Moves into a bread, maybe biscuit flavor that drys all of the flavors to a woody, somewhat smoky end taste.  Mouthfeel - Full bodied, light carbonation, smooth.  Overall - Good beer. To me this beer is unique. It's not predominantly a chocolate flavored stout which is nice sometimes. Will be buying again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Furlinator,4.5,"Pours opaque black with one full inch of gorgeous brown head that leaves heavy lacing. My daughter said that it looked like soy sauce as I poured.  Smell is dark chocolate and faint coffee up front, dark fruit and molasses on the back end. Slight breadiness.  Taste is subtle coffee and cocoa at first. Faint cherry and plums with hoppy bitterness on the finish. ABV is very well hidden.  Mouthfeel is viscous, thick and creamy.  All the flavors individually are very subtle but, when combined are very powerful and unique. A world class imperial stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JerUrbans,4.71,"Pour looks like tar with dark tan head that holds on well. Smells of roast and alcohol. Tastes fantastic, chocolate and roast coffee, the alcohol is there but well hidden. This is up there with the best mouthfeels I've had, it's smooth and really creamy and a nice little bitter chocolate at the end.  Overall, this is the best imperial stout I've had, excellent taste, excellent appearance, and excellent mouthfeel.

Taste: Espresso and dark chocolate, dark fruits with a final alcohol/medicinal bite.  Notes: Expense aside, this is a nice introduction to RIS's. I do, however, think that this could probably be considered a regular stout. It has some serious ABV, thought.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Jay_Ulreich,3.84,"BAers seem to hype the hell out of this beer! But with good reason. Oskar Blues seems to have snuck its way into Indiana distribution recently... Thats great! Bit expensive... And If Im spending this much on an Imperial Stout again, its gna be Expedition. Anyway its really really good. A- I have learned something from trying many many examples of the style, and thats the color of the head, and thickness of the head. If it is tan brown or red in color, youve probly got a winner. This stout is BLACK. Its head is somewhere inbetween tan and brown, like some good raw if you know what I mean. Good lacing, great retention. S-I had to give it 3.75, because of the very apparent alcohol smell, I dont like it, it cuts right thru the good stuff. When you get past the alcohol, everything is there that you want, deeep roasted malt, almost chocolate. Maybe some fig?The alcohol presence is killing it for me. I can just pick out some hop bitterness. I dig stout where I can detect that. T-Again, alcohol is really detectable. You know what, Im going to let it warm for awhile, then come back to it. Its 9:26 pm, and its been warming up for awhile now. Okay its 9:45 now, and I know thats not alot of time, but it did make quite a difference. Well I gotta say, Im not sure when it was brewed, but its a little ""green""...Its just so fresh. I bet some aging would really improve this beer, and I may just do that. Its got big roasty character, dark chocolate... Im really trying to taste hops, but there arent any. I detect just the faintest hint of fig or something like that. M- Wow! I can say that about this beer, its mouthfeel is heavenly. Its creamy and smooth, almost chewy, but really its all creme. It seems to melt in your mouth, if you will. Overall? This beer deserves SOME of it hype. Its very well crafted, I love everything about it except a)the price and b)the over apparent presence of alcohol. $16 for a 4 pack? Really? Id rather spend another buck and get 6 Expeditions. Worth a try tho. Its all about the chase, man. Cheers",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TheFizzinator,4.47,"Roasted malt and chocolate! That's what this beer is to my palate. And let me tell you ladies and gentlemen, it is outstanding! 10.5 percent alcohol and it is difficult to taste a single drop of it over the chocolate explosion in my mouth. It's quite essy to see why this is one of the top imperial stouts on the market. Thank you Oskar Blues for deciding to distribute to Minnesota.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,CTbrew32,4.16,"Appearance- Black in color with a 2 finger creamy mocha head produced. Lots of lacing clinging to the glass.  Aroma- Intense aromas that can be smelled from a foot or two away. Dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and some dark cherry fruitiness in there as well.  Taste- Front of palate there is bitter roasted malts and dark chocolate malt that completely coats the mouth. Towards the middle some of the dark fruit shows up adding a nice compliment to previous dark and bitter flavors. Dark fruit and dark chocolate follow into the finish that is creamy and bitter. Very little al  Mouthfeel- Full bodied, low carbonation, creamy, and a somewhat dry finish.  Overall- Definitely one of the best and unique imperial stouts out there. Really couldn't offer another example that mimics this flavor profile and quality in which it uses these flavors. Only thing keeping this from being a higher score for me is the huge emphasis on the roasted malt and the bitterness (almost smokey) it adds. I enjoy that aspect, but I don't love it and there isn't something else really balancing that out. Overall though, this is must have beer and its worth the somewhat steep price tag.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Really great looking beer.  Aroma is rich dark roasted malt, bitter chocolate, and cocoa. Smells really nice and clean with a subtle sweetness in the background.  Taste is dark, roasty, and bittersweet, with a hint of dark fruit. This is one rich, dense, concentrated brew. The sweetness is balanced nicely by the roasty bitterness.

But Ten FIDY truly does have the thick, molasses, oil look. Pouring it is like emptying out an inkwell.  It's very complex - actually quite hard to describe all of the flavors incorporated into this masterpiece. ""Wonderful!"" - not much more to say.

2681,34483,Immortale25,4.4,"Poured into a Funky Buddha Brewery snifter. Bottom of can says Canned On 10/08/13.  A- Pours an ominously opaque black color with a 1/2 inch brown head that retains well before eventually decreasing to a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a half sheet of surface foam. Semi-resilient lacing leaves a thick ring behind.  S- Bold dark roasted malt brings notes of dark chocolate, molasses and a bit of smoke. Moderately boozy.  T- More dark roast and a considerable amount of hop bitterness. Charry with a cherrywood-type flavor. I see why people often name this as one of their favorite non-barrel-aged stouts because it has a lot of the same flavors that you would get from the barrel. Alcohol is certainly noticeable but works well in the flavor profile.  M- Creamy, thick and chewy. Medium-low carbonation and the fullest of bodies.  O- Man, what a great RIS. I think what's key with this one is the substantial hop presence that accentuates and complements the heavily roasted malt so well.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The taste, which mirrors the marvelous smell, is extremely satisfying with it's complex mixture of chocolate, espresso, roasted malts, dark fruits, toffee, and even a subtle hints of mocha and sweet chocolate.

2681,34483,Mongrel,4.41,"Pours inky, sludgy, old motor oil thick and nearly black, with a dense, thoroughly brown finger of head. The luscious head recedes to a thick film after a minute or two, but leaves nice lacing. Actually extremely impressive lace retention for a stout of this size.  The nose isn't particularly powerful - subtle whiffs of dark chocolate, roasted grains, green raisins and dark fruit. I'm noticing as I type and sip that these become a little more apparent as the beer warms.  Taste is simply everything you could want from a big imperial stout. Inky, concentrated chocolate, espresso and licorice flavors. Chalky mocha, roasted barley, a touch of plum... deeply satisfying.  Rich and intriguing mouthfeel. Big and full to be sure - soft, chalky and dry one moment, then a little slick and syrupy. It's tough to pin down, but I like that.  Overall, a really well-rounded stout, deeply imbued with those bitter-sweet flavors we love. Alcohol is almost nowhere to be found. Only in a slight, lingering cool after-vapor is it maybe perceptible. Very impressive for a 10.5% brew. This one might have just dethroned Expedition as my favorite non-barrel-aged stout, and even gives BCBS a good run for its money.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Roguer,4.42,"Pours cloudy, thick, and dark, with fantastic bubbly action and an enormous dark brown head. Brew is oily and completely black. Retention is good. Lacing is thick and impressive.  Smells like a chocolate banana smoothie. Once you get past that, I pick up some notes of dry wheat and a whiff of alcohol. Some char, molasses, and brown sugar.  Very, very tasty stout. Not too sweet, although there is a dry-ish cocoa flavor. Thick barley flavor, and some burnt black coffee on the back-end. Light red grape notes, some banana, and a bit of influence from the booze. Very light char, especially for a Russian Imperial Stout - definitely straddles the line a bit between RIS and AIS.  Very nice thick and chewy mouthfeel; very little alcohol, and very little sting. Some bite is presented by the burnt coffee flavor, which is absolutely necessary for balance.  This is a very tasty beer that can fill the role of breakfast or dessert stout. The mouthfeel is truly fantastic.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

T: Again, dark fruit and strong alcohol. Dark malt and only a hint of roasted malt make up the rest if the flavor.  M: As thick and chewy as it looks. Viscous and a little oily slick.  O: I feel like the first can from the pack I had was better, so maybe this can is off. Really disappointed with this sample though. Flavors kinda suck and there's way too much boozy alcohol, even for a big stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Atlas1,4.45,"Poured into a DFH barrel pint. I've had so many of these over the years that I take them for granted now, which is a shame. Such a great beer. I was surprised to see that I hadn't ever reviewed it before.  Pours a pitch black with a very dark brown head. Good lace. The nose is deep and complex. Strong notes of coffee and chocolate. Burnt toast. My wife says she smells toffee pudding. Faint charcoal. It's awesome and all over the place. The taste does not disappoint. Strong coffee and chocolate again, with some faint dark cherry. Molasses. It's strong up front, with a lingering sweetness. Some hoppy bitterness in the finish. Really good stuff here. Mouthfeel is firm and supports the beer on the whole.  Again, I can't speak highly enough of Ten FIDY. Sure, there may be people who do not like this beer, but they can't say it's because this is a poor example of the style. It's an excellent American version of a Russian Imperial Stout.

2681,34483,wildcatboy,4.59,A- dark dark black with a light tan head  S- I get a large anise smell with some malty ness. Maybe a little coffee  T- Not as much anise as the nose picks up. You get the chocolate and malty flavors with some dark fruits and some burntness. The booziness picks up the more this beer warms.  M- super smooth. No major bite or hop. For as big of beer this is an easy drink.  O- Ten Fidy lives up to its reputation. Truly a top notch Stout. A big beer but not over powering with its 10.5 abv.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,WesMantooth,4.21,"Had a 12 oz can. The aroma was good but not intense. The color is motor oil/deep space/Batman black. Tried to shine light from iphone through from other side of glass and couldn't see it at all. Probably the darkest beer I have seen. Really nice and thick ( that's what she said). Tasted really good until it warmed to close to room temp. Then I could REALLY smell and taste tobacco. In general, that isnt a bad thing, but having chewed my fair share of Red Man before, I thought I was drinking a spitter at the very end. Kind of ruined it for me. Too bad because it was very good up to that point. Obviously I am in minority, but there are many better imperial stouts. My cousin agreed with me too, so I am not alone Edit: after revisiting this with a year old can, I am not sure if my taste have changed or the aging did some good, but I enjoyed it more. Very creamy and smooth. Still think it is better below 60 degrees.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,kylelenk,4.12,A- A proverbial black hole. The sheer absence of light. The head quickly dissipates leaving a little oil like slick on top.  S- Smoked and chocolate malt forward. Muted burnt oak notes that present and almost tobacco like finish. Very rustic.  T- It's easy to pick up the usual suspects here in this high gravity American stout. Ten FIDY pushed bitter dark chocolate forward to new levels. Further present is the familiar burnt caramel and molasses. Maybe a tad bit of coffee.  M- Very chewy at points with a surprisingly carbonated body that hides well under the color. The viscous body will most likely encourage you to cleanse your pallet if you'll be enjoying more than one in a row.  O- A solid offering from OB. Very big stout that comes in a fun can.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Bosoxfan20,4.08,"A- Sold ink black with a minimal caramel to khaki head. One of the darkest of stouts that I have had. Sticky lacing. Oh yeah! This one looks sick  S- Holy roasted oats! Cocoa nibs and coffee beans also come to pass, while some earthy hops try to step in with a feeble attempt to distract my nose from the robust roasted malt  T- Everything the nose finds, but with added bitterness that comes on strong to give the finish quite a kick indeed. Lots of sweet chocolate, molasses, caramel, and an abundance of brown sugar up front with the burnt roasted astringency on the back end. So much so that it distracts in a lingering way. World class start with an average finish.  M- Syrupy, full body, and finishing dry. The alcohol is present, but not at all distracting like the astringency.  O- Big time appearance, aroma, and initial flavor wave left me expecting more from the finish. But admittedly, the bar was set extremely high. Overall, an outstanding beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MaximalC,3.9,"Pours nearly black with molasses highlights and a bountiful cap of coarse, mocha-colored foam. Excellent head retention is exhibited, and broad sheets of lacing cling to the glass as the beer descends. Aroma is mild but pleasant, smelling of roasted malt and molasses.  Flavor is big and beefy, with plenty of molasses and alcohol, along with herbal hops that give it something of a harsh edge. Subtleties are difficult to discern beneath the bold primary flavors--maybe some vanilla and marshmallow notes. The combination of the hops and alcohol positively sizzle on the tongue, made bearable only by the rich sweetness of the malt to offset them. Some dark fruit finally begins to emerge after considerable warming. The body is absolutely massive. This is what an imperial stout should feel like in the mouth--thick, rich, full, chewy, and so on and so forth.  Overall, this is an audacious imperial stout that takes no prisoners. The presentation and viscosity are exemplary, but it's a little heavy-handed in the taste department, even for me. There's no shortage of traditional RIS flavors (which are nearly on steroids), but it could do with a touch of nuance and complexity. If you're looking for a milkshake-thick imperial stout that will punch you in the face, look no further.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TargaFlorio,4.62,"L - As black as it gets. Love the way the beautiful tan head rolls into being. Nice residual lacing. S - Hints of chocolate and coffee. T - Never had a beer with such a clear molasses flavor as this one. Delicious. Sometimes when I have this beer I don't really notice the listed 98 IBUs, they are so well hidden in the cocoa, molasses and slight coffee notes. F - Really thick and smooth. Luscious. O - Just a great example of a RIS.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,rdilauro,4.84,"Ok, imagine running your c ar for 3 years, never changing the oil. Then one day, you decide to change it.  JET BLACK, JET BLACK and almost poured in slow motion. Glug Glug Glug into my glass. Then a nice foamy dark brown head. I almost stopped right there, because I couldnt believe anything would like so great.  Now, the aroma/bouquet , honestly there was not that much here. But thats ok, at the first sip I went to stout heaven! My mouth exploded with a deep rich creamy stout. The finish, did I finish it, was so bold and long.  No question, out of the top 15 stouts in the world, this one is right up there.  Today, this is my favorite oil can and by far my favorite Stout  02/08/13: Snowy Night in the North East. Ok, went into my stash of Ten-Fiddy (slowly dwindling) and pop'd one open. That dark rich jet black slow pour is something you just have to see to believe. After the pour, I am still not convinced if I am picking up a coffee or chocolate noise. Hard to distinguish. But with the taste, I am getting both flavors, all perfectly balanced.  The hardest thing to accept with Ten Fiddy , is that when you are at the end of your glass, no more and you look for another can, and you cant find one!  03/08/13 Another tasting. Still same results. Before I tasted this time, I think, I put my nose down deep inside the glass that was full of the stout. I picked up a strong aroma of roasted malt, very similar to what you might smell while roasted coffee beans. But there was also this noticeable aroma of alcohol, just as you would get from a tawny port. The first sip this time. A good amount of carbonation, that roasted barley/malt stands out as well as the alcohol. But as I finish that sip, I left only with a full tasted of the roast. There is a unique smoothness to this stout. It almost coats the inside of your mouth and as you swallow, your entire throat gets to experience the pleasure. I am still trying to determine if I am getting coffee or chocolate or both out of this stout. The first time I tasted this, it was easier, but now, I am having a harder time. Could be the glass. I believe the first glass was a white wine glass. This time, I am using one of the Samuel Adams Boston Lager glasses (which I love for tasting beer, narrow at the bottom, opening up, getting narrow again and then opening). So much more can be smelled, tasted and felt using Last time I reviewed this stout, my only complaint is that at the end of the glass, when it was empty, I was eager for more. Now, this time, I am so perfectly content with having just this one.  12/31/13 Ok, for the end of 2013, I went with Ten Fiddy. It did not disappoint me.. The dark rich black tar that pours from the can just beckons one to taste it. It may be because this is the end of the night, after tasting a number of beers, and celebrating with my co-workers with a nice French Champagne and then a Spanish Cava. My taste buds might be off somewhat Wht I did detect was a strong alcoholic nose and taste to this one tonight. In fact the nose was so very pronounced with alcohol, that it questioned me as to what I wanted to drink. Once I was past that, I could taste a lot of malt and little on the coffee and almost zero on the chocolate side fie a rich stout. I am still getting this little burn in my mouth with the aftertaste of this one... I never noticed this when I've tasted Ten Fiddy over and over. If anything, this in my face type of alcohol is the only reason, I took this one down a notch  01/04/14 I had a couple of people who believe Ten Fiddy to be the end all to Stouts try it again. This batch was from 10/18/13. While it was still outstanding, that rich deep, slow pour and thickness that we all experienced last year was gone. We found this batch to be slightly thinner than last year. And while it was thinner, we all also picked up more of the alcohol.. Last years, there wasn't even a hint of alcohol even though it was a high ABV.. I do wonder what is happening.  06/01/14 Had my second set of Ten Fiddy's for the year .....

T - Follows the nose with a rich sweet mocha, deep chocolate flavor and coffee/espresso. Has more layers as you drink it with some sweet dark candy, slight figs and dark fruit followed at the end with a roast that lingers with a slight alcohol bite at the end. This is an unbelievably awesome stout!  M - This is a full bodied pillowy and so soft. It is low on the carbonation that seems to go well with this beer as it feels great in the mouth.  O - This beer is one of the best stouts that I have ever tried. It adds more depth then other great imperial stouts and delivers in more then one. Definitely one to try even with a $4 price tag.

2681,34483,Samuel906,4.27,"Oskar Blues was new to our area, and after reading the reviews on this page, I had to pick some up. Between Ten Fiddy, G'Knight, and Deviant Dales I have to say they are a pretty solid brewery. And I love that they come in cans and I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've ever poured a true heavy duty stout from a can. Ten Fidy pours pure opaque black with just some hints of orange tinge on the edges. Very thin khaki head that quickly dissipates to a thin halo around the edge of the glass. Smell is mostly dark chocolate, mocha, brown sugar and fairly mild as stouts go. Taste is fantastic! Pretty straightforward, chocolate and brown sugar up front, with toasted coffee and malts finishing it off. The coffee really lingers which is great. No booze what so ever. Mouthfeel is creamy, but lighter than most RISs or heavy stouts, and the higher than average carbonation really brings to life the bitter of the coffee and keeps the sweetness subdued. Overall, supremely drinkable and a very solid stout. Not too sweet, some good alcohol warmth in the gut, great coffee flavor, and no metallic hints even poured from a can. Very, very good!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,krustster,4.61,"Pours a thick black with a preposterously huge, sticky, super-persistent dark brown head. When I say a huge head, I mean I poured this into a giant snifter and the head almost reached the top (when usually there's a few inches of space even on the foamiest brews). After a minute it faded to a manageable level that looks incredibly creamy and thick. The lacing is so thick and heavy that it actually seems to be drying in place on the glass like paint. People always describe imperial stouts as being ""like used motor oil"" but this may very well be the most apt example of that term that I've seen. No light shines through, even at the very edges, and it slops around like a glass of wood varnish. Incredible density and viscosity.  Smell is actually a little odd and not as exciting as the look. I get a large serving of fresh, almost vegetal coffee, with a bit of ""roast"" and not a whole lot else. It's kind of odd that there's such a coffee smell; as far as I know this doesn't actually have any coffee in it. Maybe a trace of alcohol in the nose but it's almost all coffee to me.  Taste: uuaauuhh god man. Weirdly, this beer tastes more like how it looks than how it smells, if that makes sense. There's a touch of coffee in the taste, but the appearance, to me, hinted at a sweeter and more roasted flavor. That's what comes through here. It's not quite as sweet as Mystery Stout but there's a huge sweetness almost like molasses. Following that is a blast of roasted malt tapes, massive dark chocolate, really almost milk chocolate considering how low the bitterness is, and that hard-to-quantify ""flaked oat"" taste backing it up. The finish is lengthy and thick with coffee. It's easy to see why this is considered a classic of the style. The variety of flavors is standard, but each one stands out and they almost come in stages: first molasses, then malt, then chocolate, then black coffee. Maybe I haven't been paying enough attention over the years, but this is the first beer where I've actually noticed a distinct progression of flavors, one after the other. The finish goes on for ages. Even as I'm writing this sentence, it's been minutes since my last sip and I'm still noticing new elements as it fades. Amazing!  Mouth feel: oily, syrupy, coats your mouth and throat almost like pepto-bismol (though the taste is far different). Incredibly viscous. It actually leaves a feeling in my mouth and throat like--and I know this is going to sound gross but I mean it in a positive way--drinking whole milk and/or having a bad cold. It just leaves that thick, borderline disturbing mucus-y feeling in the back of your throat. Maybe I'm out of line, but I love it in the right context. And of course, the right context is drinking a massive, oily beer. Finally, there's just a hint of alcohol burn that seals the deal perfectly. It never overstays its welcome, but you also never forget that you're blasting a 10.5% imperial stout. It's a beer to be respected.  Overall, the number of reviews and overall score for this beer should tell you all you need to know. It took me a long time to get around to it, mainly because it's not available where I live (I ordered it online in accordance with a free shipping deal) but now that I have it, I feel like one of the missing puzzle pieces in my life has fallen into place. This is an absolute benchmark of the style. The flavors and textures are so powerful, so in-your-face, yet so expertly layered... it's near perfect. If a bourbon barreled version of this exists... its power... I don't even want to think about it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Up front is heavy, melted chocolate, burnt caramel, and cherry bark. As it warms that cherry bark/woodiness comes out more, along with a more bittersweet chocolate.

It's thick like syrup and lingers on the tongue after every sip.  Overall, this is definitely a world-class beer, deserving higher than a 96 in my opinion. The only complaint I have is the price.

The bottom of the can reads “PITCH DARK WATERS.”  A: A motor oil body, thick and black, adorned with a substantial head of creamy chestnut-brown foam; looks menacing. Short retention and sparse dots of lacing.  S: Just as menacing here: just a whiff and you’re getting a noseful of clear alcohol (think vodka, not bourbon) with a sprinkling of maple and black pepper. There’s also a noticeable tone of green apple, as well…oxidation, perhaps? Whatever the case, it’s not exactly unpleasant.  T: The palate commences with a silky sweetness: tastes of chocolate fudge on vanilla ice cream and caramel apple cover the tongue. That creamy dose of residual sugars is assurance that this is a dessert beer, without a doubt. Flavors of hops and booze never get above that, but they do add notes of chili pepper, hickory-smoked meat, lemon-pepper, and char. Finishes with a slight crispness, roast tones peeking out from under a blanket of caramel sugars.  M: Quite a milky brew: full-bodied with a tingling of creamy carbonation. This is probably one of the best textures I’ve ever come across from a canned beer (no distracting fizz or thinness).  O: A sweet, velvety, and downright drinkable stout.

2681,34483,brianmandell,4.18,"Opened up a can dated 10/23/13 in January 2015  Thick black pour with minimal lacing and no head. Chocolate fudge, chocolate syrup, molasses, a big deep roast and a bit of soy sauce. Sweet but not overly so. There is a touch of astringent bitterness on the finish that becomes more apparent as the beer warms up. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel but not cloying. It's carried by a perfect effervescent carbonation. Overall, quite nice.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Mitchster,4.34,"$4.19 for a 12oz can at Siciliano's. Brewed with ""two-row malt, chocolate malt, roasted barley, flaked oats and hops"" 98 IBUs, 10.5% ABV.  Pours out to a clear very dark oily black, forming a tall dark brown head with superior retention and solid sheets of lace. Mildly carbonated, ~2.0 carbs or so. Nose of carob, black walnut, soy sauce, prunes and vanilla. No off-aromas. Stones fruit esters. Mouthfeel is creamy, softly carbonated, big bodied with mild roast and hop acidity. Medium, slightly sweet finish. Taste is a recap of the aroma. No off-flavors. Well balance complex interplay of all the flavors and a pleasant hop bitterness and the cleanly fermented alcohol warmth. Not hot or solventy at all. The hops are still quite green and would benefit from aging. I don't understand why brewers add late hop additions to RIS's when they almost always recommend aging. Forgo the late hop and drink it sooner!  This is an excellent RIS, however, for the money, Bells Expedition, Founders and Great Lakes are better and cheaper. Recommended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MoorBeerPlz,4.36,"Served from the can into a snifter...  Pours a black/brown, very much like heavy weight motor oil. A thick 1 1/2 finger head develops, the color of chocolate milk. This slowly dissipates to nice lacing and a foam cap.  The aromatics are surprisingly light. Roasted grains and a little alcohol. To me, not much changes as it warms up.  First taste is bitter with the roasted grains, coffee, maybe vanilla, molasses and the alcohol, especially at the end. As it warms, more chocolate, a hint of raisin and a little more intensity to the alcohol. I would say that overall, there is a balance to all the flavors.  Thick, rich, milkshake mouthfeel with a smoothness that coats your mouth. There is a balanced bitter/sweet taste and finish with a drying at the end and slight alcohol heat. Low carbonation throughout the taste.  Overall a very good, big RIS and I like it a lot. I can't tell you that it's the best I've ever had but I would buy it again if the mood strikes me.

2681,34483,Careliada,5,"This is it. This is the only thing to knock Ommegang out of my top spot.  Everyone knows how Ten Fidy pours. Black, thick as motor oil, with a good head that falls but lies flat on top of the beer long after.  It kicks you in the teeth, and then holds you by the throat. Not an accessible beer for beginners by any means, but one that swaths you in chocolate and coffee and leaves a decisive tingle on the roof of the mouth and the tongue for long minutes after it's swallowed. The first time I had it, I shivered, and had to wait for a second sip. If you're trying it the first time and you're unsure, it's a bit easier on the mouth cool, but the body and flavor only really come out when it's just a little before warm.  I love this beer. I would marry this beer if it were legal to do so. Since it isn't, I just have to keep 5-6 cans in my house at any time.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,AlCaponeJunior,4.17,"Re-review additional.notes: I will not edit my original review, as it was one of my very first, and I think it needs to remain as-is, as a testament to changing perspectives. It's now several years later, nearing 1000 reviews of beer, and essentially my view on this beer hasn't changed much, although the numerical ratings I would choose would vary slightly.. I would bump the flavor by a quarter point, and lower the appearance by the same. Also, it's debatable whether I'd rate the overall a quarter point higher. Note that when I originally rated this, BA did not have quarter point ratings, only half. Otherwise, I will keep the same comments, and my rating data was not changed upon re-review. Also notable is that this re-review is from an aged can of 2012 vintage. Finally, I have begun to prefer pouring beers at fridge temps, and letting them warm and breathe to prime drinking temperature (which is slightly different for every beer, IMO).  Original review:  After much anticipation, I finally opened my first Ten Fidy. Poured at about 50 degrees, this imperial stout comes out looking like used diesel oil - black as black can get, a true black hole of a beer. Made a decent head that dissipated after some time into a film on top with lots of lacing on the glass.  It smelled of sweet roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, molasses and caramel. The rising smell of alcohol seems to accent the complex aromas nicely.  The taste is even more complex than the smell and is a bit overpowering, but on par with the style. Bitter roasted malts, molasses, honey, coffee, chocolate, a touch of dark fruits (raisins?), and notable alcohol taste.  Feels excellent, thick and almost a bit chewy, gliding down with a warming effect, perfect for the style.  Drinkability - it's highly flavorful but a bit overpowering as a stand alone, unless it was a one beer evening. Will drink again, but only one at a time. Would make an excellent black and tan.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Pours a super viscous dark black color with an inch of dark brown head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, caramel, and hints of vanilla. The taste is chocolatey booze upfront followed by some roasted malts and more chocolate. Notes of coffee and earth. Hints of caramel. Bitter dark chocolate and malts at the end.

Nose is roasty dark chocolate, with an element of char in there. Mmm.  Taste is a deep, cavernous burnt chocolate/cocoa.

The nose has a little cocoa powder, dark chocolate, some molasses, and a bit of resin-y hops. Man that is rich and balanced.  This malty beast has the potential for cloying, what with the Tootsie Roll and Hershey's chocolate flavor. However, there is a nice punch of pine-y hops that make the whole affair slightly bitter, like a really dark cocoa bean. The roast is also prominent in the finish. This is a chocolatey and roasty monster.  Benchmark. Absolutely benchmark. I am drinking a beer that was an ice cream malt in another life. Huge, creamy, a finish that goes on forever, I swear this is not hyperbole.  Ten Fidy was an incredible drinking experience. This is one of the most balanced Russian Imperial Stout's I have ever had.

I'll split the difference and say Ten Fidy is quite drinkable with loads of good sweet chocolate, espresso, burnt/roasted barley notes -- and the 10.5% ABV is no joke. i'm definitely going to enjoy the second half of my 4-pack.

The head fades pretty quickly but thick lacing is left on the sides of the glass and it is impressive for a beer of this strength.  Aroma is a very rich, dark chocolate that is loaded with vanilla and toast. There is kind of a Sharpie smell to it but it is very nice. There is some tobacco and it is an aroma that is anticipating a very sweet beer.  Loads of vanilla, dark chocolate, and toast on the flavor. Smoke comes rushing in next along with some tobacco notes. There is some wood and a very light hint of dark fruit although the fruit is very well restrained allowing the caramel and cocoa to shine. Bitterness is fairly high but any hop character is restrained behind the char and toast. Mouthfeel is very heavy and silky smooth but not too sweet.  Overall, probably the best RIS I have had and one of the best beers I have ever tasted. So much going on and delicious on a cold night.

Alcohol burn is there but pleasantly so, not overbearing one bit. Limited hops are just enough to roughin the edge of the malts on this one.  Very smooth and thick and one the lower side of carbonation. Very well done.  Really like this big stout, from a can nonetheless. A bit pricey but worth it in my opinion.

There's so many specialty stouts it was nice this one lets the malt come through. Very slight alcohol burn as an aftertaste, but only because I was looking for it.  M - Thick body that goes down smooth, warms the mouth. No apparent carbonation on the tongue.  O - I've been wondering what all the hype was on this beer. Now I understand.

2681,34483,biboergosum,4.34,"12oz can, procured in Denver a few weeks ago, thanks to the Beer Diaries' Mr. Mike for the sample! ""Show me yo fidy's"" - heh. Combined with the 'Cancupiscent' (lustful, essentially) mention just under the rim, I'm surprised that this doesn't get some sort of mature rating from the guv'mt overseers. Oh, right, this is an adult beverage.  This beer pours a solid, light-destroying black abyss, with very, very subtle basal cola highlights, and four fingers (had to prematurely stop pouring before it got any higher) of dense, thickly foamy chocolate milk brown head, which leaves a perfect band of drooping webbed lace around the glass as it slowly ebbs out of sight.  It smells of chalky bittersweet cocoa, mildly roasted caramel malt, toffee pudding, acrid black orchard fruit, vanilla extract, a mild woody graininess, charred ash, and a simmering edgy booziness. The taste is again quite enamoured with the dark milk chocolate, all creamy and chunky, with a caramel malt strength that would be notable in damned near any other beer, some seemingly (mistaken, I gather) wood-borne vanilla, underripe fleshy plums and cherries, a twinge of watery espresso, and a now fully obfuscated alcohol warmth (I know its there, but have a devil of a time picking it out.)  The bubbles are fairly subdued, but not exactly inert - they know they've got some background work to put in, the body a stoic medium-heavy weight, thick, robust, and full in its creamy smoothness. It finishes astonishingly on the near-dry side, the lulling smoke, and well, maybe some under the radar hops taking the still prominent chocolate, caramel, fruit, and booze headliners to task.  One crazily drinkable (maybe it's just the can, vs. a bomber), and enjoyable RIS. The chocolate and more standard malt interplay is civil and agreeable, benefiting all. And the alcohol, how about that - 21-proof, and barely a tic. All in all, one of the best, and certainly most balanced versions of the style that I have yet to encounter.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,StoutHunter,4.32,"I picked up a can of Oskar Blues Ten FIDY last month for $3.79 at The Lager Mill. I've been wanting to try this beer for a long time and it was the beer that I wanted to try the most after I heard that Oskar Blues was coming to Michigan, I hope it doesn't disappoint so lets see how it goes. Canned on 9/16/2013. Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter.  A- The can looks good, it's got a nice clean look to it and while it may not be the most eye catching it does have some funny stuff written on the can. It poured a dark motor oil black color that didn't let any light come through and it had two and a half fingers worth of creamy dark mocha colored head that died down to a thick ring that stayed till the end and it left lots of nice thick rings of lacing behind. This is a very good looking RIS, I have no complaints at all.  S- The aroma starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness followed by lots of sweet and dark roasted malts that impart a very roasty, slightly charred, dark chocolate, and vanilla aromas that come together to make an aroma that reminds me of chocolate ice cream. Up next I get a lighter boozy aroma with some nice coffee aromas coming through. The aroma was very nice and it was full of great roasted malt aromas.  T- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness followed by loads of dark roasted malts that impart a sweet malt, roasted, slightly charred, and very chocolate like flavors with a little bit of coffee and vanilla showing up in the background. Up next comes a lighter alcohol flavor that's a little warming with very light dark fruit and slight toffee flavor. On the finish there's a fairly lower amount of bitterness with a very roasty and chocolate like aftertaste. This is a very nice tasting RIS, it was very true to style and it didn't seem to have any weak points.  M- Pretty smooth. clean, rich, creamy, slightly sticky, on the lighter side of being full bodied with a slightly lower amount of medium carbonation. I thought the mouthfeel was very good and it worked very well with this beer.  Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a very good example of the style, it was pretty spot on for the style with none of the aspects seeming out of place and there was some really nice balance and just enough complexity. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth for the style, clean, creamy, a little filling and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, this might be one of the most drinkable RIS's I've had, I could get in some trouble with this beer since I don't think it would be pretty easy for me to drink a few of these. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it may be the best mouthfeel I have encountered in an RIS and it has everything that I would want in the style. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change. I would for sure buy this beer again, I will be picking up some more next time I go to the store so I can throw some in the cellar and see how it develops over time, it's a little pricey, but I think it's worth it. I would for sure recommend this to anyone who likes the style, this is a pretty great example of an RIS. All in all i was very happy with this beer and I think it's safe to say it lived up to my expectations. I still think Founders Imperial Stout is my favorite RIS, but I think this one is close to be as good and I would say it's up there as one of the better RIS's I have had. Great job guys, I really enjoyed this beer and this is another beer that I will anticipate the release of, keep up the good work guys. This is now my favorite Oskar Blues beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,iamshad,5,"Friend, _n:_ A person who gives you their last 100pt beer in the fridge.  Thanks, Jimi! Ten Fidy is so unbelievably smooth.  When I poured it into the glass, my first thought reminded me of changing the car oil after waiting too many miles ... it poured so thick and black ... like bad oil. I now understand why this is $15/4pk and it's worth the money. wow, what an exceptionally smooth beer. I have just been ruined for wanted to try _anything_ other imperial stout.  Standing in front of the poured glass on the counter, I could clearly smell the strong aromas. It's just so wonderful. Rich. Heavy. Chocolate. Dark chocolate. Roasted. Mature. Thorough. Molasses. Thick. Rest well on palette. Aftertaste lingers. Worth every single penny.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Good retention and lacing, great looking beer  Smells of roast coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, and alcohol. Really good but not too complex, might be my stuffy nose  Taste is with the nose, dark espresso, dark chocolate, roast caramel malts, a little hoppy citrus, and a touch of alcohol on the finish. Really good even at two months old, everything comes together really well  Feel is smooth and creamy, thick, milky, and full. Alcohol concealed really well despite it's age, goes down dangerously easy  Overall one of the better RIS I've had.

2681,34483,KYGunner,4.44,"Amongst the biggest and grandest of appearances, this stout is thick and viscous. Black beyond comprehension the head slowly built in a row of foam then slowly disappated to a thin line. The foam was deep brown it held a ton of lacing.  Deep coffee aroma mixed with a bit of char, then chocolate, caramel and marshmallow hit the nose. Some light malt aroma, roasted of course, can be found near the end.  The flavors in this stout are so robust, so rich, that as cliche as it is I can't believe it comes from a can. The roasted coffee is strong at the front and then rails into a chocolate, Graham cracker and marshmallow finish. I actually catch a roasted caramel malt in there, though it is tempered and lost in all of the other richness.  The feel is silky smooth with a real thickness. 10.5 ABV is only noticeable in a heat that enters the chest. The carbonation is low and it lends to an easy drinkability.  I know it has been said before and there's a lot of hype but this really is something special, and it's in a can!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S: Even though I'm drinking this from a snifter I'm not overwhelmed by the smell. That being said it is still a pleasant aroma of molasses and chicory.  T: Up front, chocolate coffee and light smokiness. On the finish dark fruit but not sweet. Awesome!!  M: Sticky! Sticks to the inside of your mouth like it does to the side of your glass. Wow!  O: this is what I want in a stout. As winter approaches and I switch to stouts porters and barley wines this beer does not disappoint. To me it lives up to the hype.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,delta490,4.46,A- it's like a black hole in there. No light gets through the blackness of this beer. A strong pour produces a huge foamy head with good retention. It starts a deep mocha and then fades out into a lighter cappuccino after settling. Then it leaves lacing throughout.  S- deep roasted malt with some light notes of dark chocolate  T- big burnt flavors are strong throughout the beer. Not much subtle about this one.  M-slightly oily and the big roasted flavors and high ABV leave a slight tingle on the palette.  O- really easy drinking for how big this beer is. A great Imperial Stout.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Act25,4.49,"Consistent. Across all my fave reviewers, this is one excellent RIS. A great style from a great brewer.  Gotta sip and let this one warm as it only gets better. This is one helluva blending beer! Try blending it with a sour Flemish or Belgian ale, or with any pale ale for a black & tan. Works wonders and often its a 4+4=9 result.  A  Everyone agrees: Darkest, baddest, thickest, stickiest. - True to my experience. Want a Stout experience in your glass with sticky windows of lace and a permanent brown cap - this is it!  S  Its aroma is not over whelming, it's powerful chocolate/ roasted coffee / dessert like. A good night beer. Some malt and vanilla. Some church and some high altitude melting snow, like 14,000 feet or higher.  T  Wine like, massive. Like a large cabernet. The flavor is huge and dry, following the smell: Chocolate, coffee, malts, vanilla. Weight and alcohol with a nice see saw of sweet first and then bitter, with bitter winning the day in a dry, licorice lingering finish. Great place to leave your mouth.  M  Most full bodied. Creamy, heavy, tickler. Fine finale.  D  A sipper. A meditation beer. Perhaps the best RIS - up there ABOVE BORIS and Weyerbacher, up there with Founders, Rasputin, Narwhal. Worth it. Try it. Must have. And have again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

More dark chocolate and brown sugar on the front of the tongue. Extremely thick, coating mouthfeel. Long-pulled espresso bitterness gives way to slightly overwhelming alcohol on the back end.

2681,34483,cjgiant,4.69,"Re-review canned (NC) 8/25/2014, tasted 9/2014: A: dark, dark-brown black with nice sustaining small-bubble to foamy head. Lacing is present, but strangely ""watery"" - or perhaps better description is spotty.  S: (updated 10/2015) deep malt with roasted notes, maybe even a little smokiness. Strength is not actually very strong, but deep. Some whiffs have a hint of alcohol.  T: my first five (5)!! Also considering I favor IPAs (do enjoy imperial stouts more and more), I debated if I should, but for the style I thought it met my expectations on taste near perfectly. First re-review note: Having had and enjoyed many more imperial stouts since, I'd probably stand by this rating, barely - no worse than 4.75 on the old system. revisit 10/2015: Can't deny the 5 - this beer combines roasted notes of coffee, chocolate, and smoke in perfect balance.  Bittersweet or dark chocolate with a nuttiness underlying it. I could imagine some coffee notes in there, but it would be a flavored coffee, rich. This beer is rare in that I can usually debate chocolate in the coffee taste, but this is definitely the reverse. Little cigarette notes in the back of the taste. The flavors don't really evolve much, but slowly fade.  M: body is close to full, medium full I'd go with as it's not really too heavy - the alcohol makes its presence known subtlety, the lingering taste is similar to the taste, coating rather than dry, little bitterness. revisit: updated ""heft"" of brew""  O: this is almost exactly what I expect from an imperial stout. Re-review note: still a standard. I fully expected to have to rate this down a bit with my new experiences, but I must say, it holds up! 10/2015 revisit: Confirmed... taste-wise this is what I would hope every imperial stout would taste like.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Poured out thick from the can. Head was that typical dark khaki color with soapy bubbles on the top. Just what you want in an imperial stout.  S- Dark chocolate and roasted black coffee (more of a medium roasted coffee). Alcohol is there for sure, but it's not overpowering the nose. Sweet molasses is detected as well. Real inviting.  T- Rich! Dark chocolate and roasted black coffee. Just like in the smell, there's a molasses type sweetness. There is also some kind of hop bitterness I can't put my finger on. You definitely can taste the alcohol, but it doesn't put off much of a burn. The alcohol also creates a kind of bitterness as well. -When the beer warmed, more of a coffee flavor and less bitterness was present. It almost had a baker's type chocolate taste at this point.  M- Like with the taste, this is a rich beer! It's full bodied, but in at the same time, it's an incredibly smooth and easy drinking imperial stout. The finish is medium in length; it's not too long at all. It finishes on the bitter side with a ""slight"" sourness. This really didn't have much of a burn at all from the alcohol. I found that Old Rasputin had more of a boozy character than Ten Fidy did, and that was at 9% abv!  *This is an exceptional imperial stout. The best thing about it to me was how easy drinking it really was! I'd definitely say to drink on more of the warmer side!

Smells delicious...dark, metallic roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, dark fruit, surprisingly little hint of booze for 10.5%. Taste is awesome. Dark chocolate and coffee balanced perfectly with sweet milk chocolate, booze-soaked dark fruit, burnt sugar, all balanced again against a perfect layer of bitterness, leaving you basking in the glorious afterglow with sticky sweetness, and dark roasted bitterness lingering on the tongue, after a slight puff of alcohol heat. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, beautiful. Overall, this is an awesome RIS. While it's not the most complex, it has big flavors and they're all perfectly in sync with each other.

Color and appearance are super. Dark with a nice coffee colore head. The smell is a bit astringent and less than mouthwatering.

S - Vanilla, heavy cream, anise, and toasted malts with some acidic coffee astringency. Alcohol notes, but not boozy.  T - Rich in flavor. Coffee, toffee, toasted malts, caramel, vanilla, nutmeg, and amaretto. Pleasant alcohol notes. Some tartness initially, but fades quickly with a slightly bitter finish. Completely hides ABV.  M -Perfect sipping beer. Silky smooth. Lightly carbonated, perfect for style; slight tingle on tongue. Slight stickiness... reminiscent of a good eggnog. Very warming.  O - Wow.

Smell: Roasted Milk Duds and a bit of grainy graham cracker crust. Coffee notes keep the smell from becoming too sweet. Nice and balanced, especially for this style. Just a bit of alcohol on the nose.  Taste: Again, remarkably balanced for a Russian Imperial, even while retaining its complexity. Dark, malty chocolate, brown sugar and toffee, and a gentle roast ones to bring everything into balance and prevent any cloying sweetness. A small amount of dark fruit--plums, and a whisper of currant.  Mouthfeel: Velvety smooth, with moderate carbonation. Excellent for the style. Alcohol warming very light.

A: Fairly aggressive pour resulted in a thick and beautiful mocha head which leaves it's mark on the glass. Lacing continues as I continue to empty the glass. Pitch black. A small amount of light makes it's way through around the rim. This bad boy is sexy.  S: I've had this beer a few times, and for the first time I picked up toffee/caramel notes, and LOVED it. These compliment the rich dark chocolate and roasted coffee aromas. Such a well-balanced nose. Oskar Blues should contract with a candle company and put this shit in wax form. Give me some of that.  T: Lord have mercy... So many flavors happening. Earthy coffee flavors. Bitter dark chocolate. Smooth caramel/toffee. This beer is like playing with fire. So many things could have gone wrong, but so many things have gone right. Coffee and dark chocolate at the beginning, followed by the ultra smooth flavors of caramel, toffee, and vanilla. Alcohol is hidden incredibly well. The balance is immaculate at this temperature.  M: Smooth. Just... Just so smooth. Silky smooth. Hardly any carbonation. Ultra-viscous. A very thick, almost buttery, mouthfeel. The warmer this beer is, the better.  O: Don't even bother drinking this beer cold. Let it warm then let it WOW you. What a great offering from Oskar Blues.

Must try!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,cleve00,4.94,"First thought ""this cant be that great from a can"".... It was:)  Born Date 12/16/2012  Black and oily, mild carbonation, hearty but smooth, alcohol is there but not in a bad way, roasted expresso perfecto!  All Categories outstanding but had to leave room for improvement in the smell category. I drank this at room temp straight from the can and was blown away and I love RIS and thought I had peaked..the only thing was the cost 16.99 for a 4 pk. OUCH but I have 3 cans left for special occasons. It is a sipper for sure. I will be looking for more hopefully at a little better price.  Damn good!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,gueuzedreg,4.28,"The mouthfeel is perfect on this beer.  A- Jet black (exhausting). Pinky head, medium to large lacing around due to can.  S- Lots of charred dark fruit for this RIS. Really great profile. Charred fig, dark cherries. From what I remember, the nose does not resemble the T  T- Milky dark chocolate, with charred plum background. Interesting how the S & T are not the same in this way. A well crafted brew.  M- So milky, so perfect. I don't give 5's that often. But I did here.  O- Such a deal at the price. Love this brew.

2681,34483,DrewskiWhit,4.24,"A nice looking imperial stout. Pretty standard for the style. Nice medium tan head which dissipated slowly. Some legs on this one  S nice imperial stout notes with a touch of coffee and dark chocolate. Can detect a bit of alcohol  T again pretty standard. It does have some complexity to it but it just isn't blowing me away. The taste follows the nose for the most part with the dominant flavor being imperial stout and hints of bitter dark chocolate and then some coffee way on the back end. The alcohol is masked well.  M its creamy and drinks nicely, kinda reminds me of a milk stout.  O Was a bit disappointed with this beer. It was good but imo far from great. This can is at least a year old so I'd be interested in trying a fresh offering. The taste had nice imperial stouts notes and the feel was nice and creamy but overall it just seemed to be missing something.

2681,34483,HattedClassic,4.71,"The beer pours a very vigorous head that is a dark brown color resembling that of cocoa. The beer itself is an opaque black with dark brown notes. The beer has a very roasty smell with hints of dark chocolate sweetness to it. The beer also has a cocoa note that mixes well with the roast and dark chocolate sweetness. The beer taste is very roasted with cocoa and bit of dark chocolate swimming underneath of all the other notes. The aftertaste is very bitter, which is similar to the rest of the beer. Additionally, the earthy hops also make an appearance to offset the malts, cocoa, and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with some biting carbonation. While it is smooth, the beer also has a bit of texture to it as well.

Roasted malts nicely balanced with just enough hops. Coffee and dark chocolate. Super thick and without the burn of most imperial stouts.  O - Best imperial stout I've ever had, hands down.

Appearance: pitch black with slight 1 finger mocha head  Smell: roasted malts, dark chocolate, espresso beans, ris flavor, slight anise, caramel, vanilla  Taste: the perfect blend of dark and milk chocolate, espresso and coffee flavors, an classic RIS roasted malt backbone. To top it off plenty of vanilla and caramel notes. Alcohol is apparent, but fits in well and balances everythig out. Aftertaste is where the chocolate and vanilla, even subtle anise come through.  Mouthfeel: slight carbonation and huge bodied feel.  Overall: One of my favorite stouts, right up there with Bells Expedition and Stone IRS.

On the nose is sweet malt, bitter coffee, lactose, milk chocolate, cream, and some hops and alcohol. Very complex. There's always been a weird kind of off putting scent in some stouts that I'm not too fond of. Almost kind of puky smelling. It's very strong here.  The taste is better than the smell. One of the more interesting stouts I've had. Char, some woody hops, chocolate and coffee. No real dark fruit presence like most stouts. Hides the alcohol very well but there's a slight warmth. Nice. More hop notes detected as I swallow the beer.  Mouthfeel is huge. Smooth and chewy. One of the biggest stouts I've tried so far. More carbonation than expected. Really pricks the tongue.  This is a very interesting beer. Different from most stouts I've had. Was worried I was beginning to run out of ways to describe them.

This is the second review I've done of it, just to see if my palate has changed.  A - 5.00 - Beautiful dark brown-black color that is completely opaque. Head is a medium brown of thick bubbles, two fingers at first and dies down to a thick film that eventually is a patchy thin film on top.  S - 4.75 - dark chocolate, dark fruits, espresso, coffee, some vanilla/creaminess  T - 5.00 - dark chocolate, espresso, coffee, vanilla, cream, whole milk, dark fruits, roasted malts, burnt marshmallow, an amazing imperial Russian stout  M - Nice heavy, creamy mouthfeel. carbonation is medium-light and very smooth. ABV it there in taste, no alcohol burn, but this is great for 10.5%. Sits like a hot fudge milkshake in your mouth.  O - I love this beer. Completely worth every penny - 13.99 for a 4 pack of cans or 3.99 for one can. I will continue to buy this beer as long as it's available.

2681,34483,scotorum,3.99,"I bought a fourpack when I saw it based on its high BA rating, and was anxious to confirm if I got anywhere close to my $15.50 worth. Scots don't sleep well at night if they waste money.  Canned on 10/26/12. Poured from the 12 oz can into an Innis & Gunn flute.  a: If motor oil was not quite as thick and formed a brown head...which head stubbornly refused to dissipate much for quite awhile, leaving heavy lacing...  s: Dark malt and hops.  t: A strong hopped-up-tasting stout. Dark malt with a heavy dose of bitterness. Add a lot of hops and 4.5% more alcohol to Guinness and you have the idea.  m: Rather heavy and bitter.  o: I love a good hopped-up IPA, but if this is any indication, an RIS, not so much. Perhaps this is not a good example since it was canned nine months ago. Nor does it mean I am not an Oskar Blues fan. Old Chub is a fine Scottish ale, and Gubna and G'Knight also excel.  Now that I'm almost finished drinking my first Ten FIDY, and the alcohol is kicking in, I'm liking it a helluva lot more LOL. Reminds me of my very first Guinness drunk at a pub in London after touring the Tower in the summer of 1965. I was feeling no pain when I staggered out of that pub.  UPDATE 12/21/13: After being a bit intimidated by my underwhelming experience with my first Ten Fidy, I finally had a second and it was much more enjoyable. I have also had several more RIS's for comparison since this initial review. and it has added to my appreciation of the style.

2681,34483,JamesMN,4.13,"Canned on 8/29/13.  Appearance: Pitch black and opaque body with a frothy dark tan head. Nice lacing on this one.  Aroma: Roasted malts with the usual chocolate and coffee of the style. A touch of vanilla in there as well.  Taste: Ten Fidy is one of those beers that sticks to its style guidelines and yet somehow stands out from all the other beers of that style. The start is smooth roasty malt goodness with a bit of bitter hop presence there to keep things from getting too sweet. The finish is more of the same with black coffee bitterness and echoing hops looming through the aftertaste. The lively hop character will probably fade with time giving Ten Fidy a smoother flavor. 10.5% ABV is nothing to smirk at but the alcohol is hidden pretty well here, only coming through in the finish as a sort of liqueur backing to the abundant malt flavor. Well done.  Mouthfeel: Full in body with a feel akin to chocolate milk. The carbonation is at the right level but a vigorous pour keeps things nice and smooth. Drinkability is really good for a beer of this caliber.  Final Thoughts: A great RIS and a standout in my mind for one of the best non oak aged stouts. Got two cases of the stuff and can't wait to see how it ages. Would I drink it again? Yes.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ScaryHairy44,4.52,"The second I cracked the can it smelt like coffee. With that coffee forward smell there was a certain sweetness to it also that overtook the metallic smell of the can. The appearance was like motor oil, with hardly any head. What the head did compose of was dark bubbles with more of an aroma of coffee. The first sip gave me a roast forward taste followed by notes of chocolate. Mouthfeel on it was quite amazing too, which was very very sludgy.

A: Deep brown to black, nearly opaque, with a thin tan head and low visible carbonation.  S: Big roasty malts, coffee and sticky chocolate, sweet and somewhat boozy. Some dark fruit and vanilla show up more as the beer warms.  T: Drying chocolate, cacao, coffee, vanilla, hazelnut, dark fruit, and moderate alcohol burn. Finishes dry and sticky.  M: Sticky, chewy mouthfeel. Decent heft to the body, but not as thick as some examples of style. Alcohol presence is noticeable but it doesn't overwhelm the other flavors.

Creamy coffee colored head - about two fingers worth originally - retaining a film of mocha nicely. No visible carbonation. Lots of spotty lacing  Aroma starts with sweet milk chocolate which is quickly balanced by bittering espresso. Cream and coffee. Earthy, herbal anise pops up in the middle. Notes of vanilla and roasted malts round this out. Charcoal and even a little bit of cola. Lots going on here  Taste follows suit. Lots of chocolate but not as sweet as the nose suggested. Big espresso and roasted coffee flavor. The IBUs (I believe 95) balance this perfectly. Middle is herbal with anise and/or licorice and some char. Finish is smoky with some drying cocoa  Feels full and rich. Smooth and creamy. A pleasant sipper  Overall this is really nice. Being the first RIS I've had out of a can I will say I'm impressed. Lots of flavor and complex. Not the best I've ever had, and at $18 a 4-pack it is a little disappointing, but still very good.

T: It has a nice full taste that isn't too thick but a nice burnt malted roasted sweetness. Not too many notes here, just tastes good. Full malt character that has a just right amount of sweetness. You can taste a bit of the alcohol, but it seems to just be a part of the malt and sweetness of the stout.  M: Quite smooth with only a tiny bit of carbonation, that is very subtle. You are kind of left wanting a bit more. Just the right amount of viscosity.  O: This is a great stout and it is a steal at its price, abv, and convenience (since it is in a can).

Lacing is spotty down the side of the glass -- stickier than many imperial stouts.  S: Smell is pleasant, with hints of coffee, chocolate, fruit, anise. Alcohol is evident but not overwhelming.  T: Delicious. Coffee, cocoa, hop bitterness, malt sweetness, and just a little roasted character. The only detractor here is that the alcohol is a little more evident than I would expect.

O: Very impressed. One of my favorite imperial stouts, and my favorite imperial stout I've had from a can. I was a little worried by how syrupy the beer looked at first when I opened it, but this is a fantastic beer.

Mouthfeel is hardcore thick, oily and coats like peanut butter on the roof of your mouth.  O: I have been anxious to try this and I can say I was very pleased. I would have liked more roasted coffee or grains to combat the sweet. Indeed a sipper to enjoy that creates a film of awesomeness encompassing the entire mouth. I will be picking up more of this for sure.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S: Chocolate and coffee go head to head. Just delightful.  T: Pow! Right in the kisser. Chocolate slides in with nice coffee notes. Smooth, warming. Sweet, but not overly so. Alcohol creeps in without a whisper. Sip and be awed. Even better as it warms.  M: Medium to high; chewy, frothy carbonation.  O: Damn fine, especially coming from a can.

S - Tons of dark chocolate. Caramel, molasses. Bourbon/alcohol comes in a bit but isn't forceful.  T -Like the smell, chocolate, molasses, burnt sugar comes through up front. Not too much of an alcohol burn but the taste is there. Delicious. Like a dessert.  M - Slightly viscous, creamy. Great carbonation. Awesome mouthfeel.  O - Just a great RIS.

Roasted bitterness. Malty. Dark chocolate-like bittersweetness.  M- Medium full. Smooth and mouth-coating. Just like a stout should be. Slight alcohol warming after a bit.  O- Great stout!

Mocha at the forefront on the nose, with alcohol not too far behind. Sniff harder to try and find more complexity, but more of a solvent-like note comes out. Some nice roasty, dark chocolate notes are there, but they get squashed.  Creamy texture with a restrained sweetness upfront. The silky mouthfeel is noticeable and appreciated. Dark roasted malts evoke the flavors of dark chocolate, toffee, and a hint of raisin-like fruit. Slight hop bitterness, more of a roast astringency. The alcohol is more well-hidden than on the nose but still present. Good balance with all the right flavor notes for a big stout.  Ten Fidy is a very good Imperial stout, but the fuel note on the aroma and the high price tag are major negatives. There are better alternatives at better price points.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Some lacing along the glass.  Huge grain and chocolate malt aroma, caramel sweetness, molasses, roast, fresh wood, hint of booze. Just an incredibly deep, rich malty nose.  Taste offers a huge roasted character with restrained sweetness, dark chocolate, alcohol, and long, lingering bitterness.  Feel is spot on. I mean perfect.

Smell: Molasses, milk chocolate, caramel, with a touch of dark fruit. Smell is very rich and sweet.  Taste: Similar to the smell - Rich chocolate and molasses take the forefront, some caramel/toffee and dark fruit come through. Alcohol is hidden well. This beer is very rich and finishes pretty sweet. The only thing I would add is more bittering hops to balance out the sweetness on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Thick, rich, and velvety smooth. Appropriately low carbonation. Stays true to the motor oil name. Pretty much spot on for what I'm looking for in an imperial stout.  Overall: Phenomenal beer.

Would like a little more roast to this but it definitely has a presence regardless.  Taste is green apple, caramel, and soy. A little bit of roast in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is, as expected, huge.

The nose brings back childhood memories of opening the cap on a bottle of Brer Rabbit molasses: notes of espresso and black Australian licorice also.  Not much in the way of carbonation, but an RIS isn't supposed to be effervescent. Taste is exceptionally rich, deep, and creamy. There is a wave of full force flavors that coat your palate like roofing tar: dark roasted espresso, dark heavy molasses with a dose of black licorice. Full bodied and drinks like a can of beef stew.  Lasting aftertaste of roasted espresso, Fox's U-Bet chocolate syrup, Brer Rabbit dark molasses with a touch o' booze and intense black licorice.

Great creamy lacing.  Smell - Rich molasses and hearty malts, dark chocolate and sweet espresso. A tinge of fennel or black licorice.  Taste - Wow.. Fennel or black licorice followed by sweet creamy chocolate and then hearty roasted molasses, smoked and sweet. If you are into RIS style then this is most definitely your bag.  Mouthfeel - Rugged, a bit boozy here but otherwise quite enjoyable. Sticky and creamy and it sits like a meal.  Overall - Amazing brew, full of depth and character.

Taste is magnificent. Roasted coffee and chocolate dominate the palate, with a bit of tar and licqurice hiding in the background. Hugely complex, the taste stays on the tongue for ages.  Thick and creamy, really smooth and elegant. Nice level of carbonation.  Overall, this is a classic, and it's easy to see why. Huge taste, with a lot of depth to find, and great mouthfeel.

2681,34483,swoopdog,5,"A - Pours a syrupy motor oil black with a half finger of a dark mocha brown head that disappeared rather quickly into a thin brown ring of a head around the inside of the glass.  S - Nice big chocolate some coffee with a bit of maltyness at the end. With a few twirls I was getting less malts and more sweetness I am noticing almost like a sweet soy sauce aroma now or almost like some fresh baked cookies. Pretty interesting and delicious smelling.  T - I am letting this sit for around a half hour to get the most of it. The can wasn't really cold but I figure a good half hour after the pour should warm this up everything nicely and let it breath. Very malty with a big bitter dark chocolate taste. There is a nice caramel taste in the middle of the mouth that has some warmth behind it from the huge ABV on this. There is surprisingly more hops that I was expecting. The end of the tongue has a bit of that dank coffee in the aftertaste that gives this a great overall taste.  M - Full bodied (almost chewy) with minimal carbonation, the malt gives this a creamy overall feel that smooths this thing out to pure silk. Lots of alcohol warmth reminds you that you are in fact drinking a massive RIS. The bitters from the dark chocolate and the hops give this dry finish and gets you just thirsty enough to have another drink.  O - Ridiculous this thing is ridiculous.

There is a subtle booze flavor and aftertaste of bitter dark malt.  M- Thick, syrupy, heavy, creamy and medium carbonation. I'm happy the residual mouthfeel isn't too sticky and overwhelming. Excellent execution.  A fantastic RIS. IMO, it's one of the best mouthfeels of any and also has an awesome flavor. I think the booze will settle down and the beer will balance out with some time.

2681,34483,ZDub,4.48,"Can to snifter-hybrid. Pours a used engine oil brown with just a small dark toffee colored head that doesn't hang around for long. A quick swirl coats the sides of my glass. As expected from an imperial stout, the aroma has a powerful roasted malt character with a significant backbone of dark chocolate and just enough alcohol to let you know this beer isn't effing around. The taste backs up the smell and then some. Dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, a hint of alcohol, a moderate sweetness, and just enough hops to balance it all out. Ten Fidy is heavy but not too much so. It's a thick velvety liquid that coats my mouth like fine grade A maple syrup. As the first sip touched my lips my stubble grew to a beard that would make a Viking blush, my wife became instantly 6 months pregnant, my enemies felt a chill run up their spines, and a battle ax appeared before me.

Broad aroma of barrel tannins with dark roasted and chocolate malts. The 10.5% ABV is evident in both aroma and taste, but it’s still a pleasure to enjoy. Flavour starts surprisingly mild but quickly builds to quite a crescendo of malt and barrel tones, with an alcohol burn and bitter finish that lingers. Coffee, chocolate and whiskey tones are all beautifully balanced.  A stunning imperial stout and sipping beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

It’s got that RIS smell, which is a good thing, though not charting any new territory. Just huge roast, char, espresso, cocoa, and fruit notes.  Before I can even think about the flavor, I’m remarking at the body. This is thick! Body is just so full and satisfying. Flavor is equally large with an enormous amount of roasted malt at work here. Finish reveals some leafy hops, and there’s also a lingering char and black chocolate that dry it all out. Slight boozy tingle.  Overall this is a fine beer and worthy of all its accolades. Now I’m really eager to try it fresh to compare. Though I suspect it’s held up well in the can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Pours black as pitch with ruby highlights around the meniscus, otherwise totally opaque. Thick, billowy 2 finger dark cappuccino colored head. Very thick and syrupy looking. Gorgeous stout.  The aroma is a big caldron of caramel, creamy coffee, chocolate, molasses, dark bread and plenty of hops. Very big and bold.  Taste follows the nose pretty well, with a spreading caramel malty sweetness up front, fading into bitter coffee/chocolate and big hops. Huge flavor. Alcohol well masked.  Mouthfeel is thick, rich, creamy. Carbonation is just right. Body is massive.  Man, that was some kickass stout. My non-beer drinker friend instantly said ""whoa, you sip this stuff"" and was surprised to be able to pick so many pleasing flavors out of a beer.

Aroma of dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malt.  Taste starts slightly sweet of caramel, but quickly moves to a dark roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and a slight bitterness of hops.  Mouth Feel is thick, full body, chewy yet smooth. The dark roasted malt and bitter chocolate becomes more dominate as the the beer comes to room temperature. The alcohol makes an appearance as it warms.

It has a creamy, slightly bitter finish that make you want another sip  M - This was my favorite part of Ten Fidy... It's thick, slightly chewy, and creamy all at once.  O - This isn't my favorite non-barrel aged RIS, but it's definitely in my top 5. I prefer Plead the 5th, Expedition, and Founder's RIS.

The foam just looked so rich and edible. Like you could take a spoon, scoop it out and you'd think you'r eating milk chocolate.  Smell: Intense notes of sweet malty chocolate. Unfortunately I have a cold so it's a bit hard to pick up the specifics. But I have no doubt, that this is a beer you'll want if you crave a chocolate stout.  Taste: So sweet, malty, and rich. Seriously taste like a liquid dessert. The sweet chocolate is just so profound it screams at your taste buds. No hop profile or strong bitterness detected except for a little bit at the finish. Its like a dark chocolate where the sweetness overpowers the bitterness, yet you still pick up a touch of bitter.  Mouthfeel: Rich, creamy and full-bodied.  Overall: outstanding beer.

I don't know how to describe it other than ""smooth."" For a beer that's 10.5 percent, it certainly didn't taste like it. I pretty much guzzled it down, and my bf still had half of his 5% drink when I was done. It was like liquid candy. Not too bitter, but not too sweet, either.  M- Not too thin or thick.

2681,34483,SerialTicker,4.5,"*UPDATED REVIEW from JANUARY 3RD 2016*  Canned 7/28/15 and poured 1/3/16. : ""NIGHTY NIGHT!""  The first time I had Ten Fidy was well before I appreciated the style. The last time I had it, I was a fan of the style, AND the can was aged for a little over a year. This time, the can is about 5 months old. Let's see how this goes.  Smell: Changes a lot as it warms. Molasses covered hops at one point, boozy chocolate coffee the next. There's more so some chocolate, coffee, alcohol, and, as I get in some big stouts, a smoked meat quality. Complex and interesting.  Taste/feel: Very flavorful beer with a hoppier-than-I-recall flavor that adds to the bitterness as well as depth of flavor. The feel is syrupy and full with a moderate carbonation. Feels slick in the mouth. Pretty boozy and warming, which fades a tick with more age.  While I like the depth the hops provide, I actually think I liked it more when they were a bit faded. This is a delicious beer, and at $4 a can, it's actually fairly priced. This is a great, interesting, tasty, ever-changing beer that warrants your attention.  4.5/5 (4.5/5)  *UPDATED REVIEW from OCTOBER 4TH 2014*  Canned 9/26/13 and poured 10/4/14. ""FLUORESCENT BLACK""  Appearance: Poured aggressively as possible into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. Nice two finger dark brown, creamy head pops up and slowly fades to about half a finger and stays awhile. Absolutely pitch black in color. Beautiful, thick beer. (4.5/5)  Smell: Even straight from the metal can and a super cold fridge, this beer smells insanely good. There's just a phenomenal blend of dark fruits, roasted malt, coffee and chocolate, and then a little bit of alcohol to let you know you're not screwing around with a pansy beer. There's even a sort of vanilla/oak character to it as well, which is normally something only picked up in barrel aged imperial stouts. (4.75/5)  Taste/feel: It's all there, I'm not sure what else you could want from a non-BBA'd imperial stout. First things first, awesome feel on this beer -- actually relatively unique for the style. It has a pretty full body, but it has a surprisingly prickly carbonation. The flavor up front is pretty good, but as the sip goes on and you get to the aftertaste, that's where Ten Fidy REALLY shines with an insanely rich dark roasty flavor, some dark, over-ripe dark fruits, and even a slight char kind of flavor. All the while, Ten Fidy is never all that bitter; it's brewed phenomenally well. A true World-Class imperial stout. My only knock is an ever-so-slight metallic note on the front and middle of just about every sip. It's FAR from brew ruining, but it's something I notice -- might have something to do with the fact that this was canned over a year ago, I don't know. (4.5/5, 4.5/5)  (4.5/5) / 4.56/5  *ORIGINAL REVIEW from MARCH 26TH 2013*  Canned 1/03/13 ""One ’til November?""  Appearance: As you’d expect, the beer is pitch black with a pretty small head. The head is a dark brown, and the lacing is poor. Nothing out of the ordinary for an Imperial Stout, but it’s still very good looking. (4/5)  Smell: Probably my favorite part about this beer. I love the milk chocolate aromas I get, as well as the woodiness. I don’t get any sort of coffee note from Ten Fidy like a lot of people seem to get. However, I do get plenty of sweetness and dark fruit aromas. (4.5/5)  Taste: Super sweet with dark fruits up front, and the finish is almost equally as sweet with some smokey tasting malts in there. I was expecting SOME amount of bitterness in this beer, but I actually find it to almost be cloyingly sweet. Keep in mind I haven’t had many IS’s (maybe three or four), but this one seems to be the sweetest that I’ve had. Once the beer warms up a little bit, the sweetness dominates even more. The smell turns much more heavily to sweet, dark fruit, and the taste does the same... cherries come out a LOT once the beer warms up a lot. (3.5/5)  Feel: Along with the smell, the feel is among the best parts of this beer. As to be expected, super thick, coats the mouth wonderfully, and just smooth as all hell. The best thing about the feel though is that it never feels syrupy despite the thickness. (5/5)  Overall, Ten Fidy is a good beer ... when it’s colder. Given its ABV AND the fact that it’s a big Imperial Stout, it’d be hard to drink this one quickly. I find Ten Fidy to be much more enjoyable when it’s colder, as it gets much too sweet when it warms up, and the roasty tastes seem to go way in the background to the super sweetness. I’d definitely try this one again, but $4 for a can and about $15 for a four-pack is a bit too high for a guy that doesn’t particularly love RIS’s for the most part. Definitely try Ten Fidy and decide for yourself, and consider aging one that you don't drink.  (4/5) / 3.98/5",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S-Sweet, roasted malts, fresh bread dough, a bit boozy, burnt sweet bread, a little burnt coffee  T-A bit sweet, fresh baked bread comes through at the front of the palate and finishes with a bit of a sour, boozy bite. Burnt sweet bread, burnt coffee, and grains fill up the middle. A very well balanced brew.  MF-Smooth and thick as hell. Syrupy, but not too thick.

Smell: Chocolate, cream, molasses and citrus. Decadent aroma, but simpler than expected.  Taste: Strong roasted core of chocolate, molasses and light coffee. Additional layers of citrus and salt, especially on the finish.  Feel: This is the creamiest and smoothest beer I have ever had. Just, wow. Finish is somewhat dry and warming.  Overall: My first Imperial Stout from a can, and it is an exceptionally good beer in every way.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,beagle75,3.71,"Poured from a 12 oz. can into a tulip glass.  A: Opaque black color with less than one finger of diminishing light brown foam head. Scant lacing remains on the glass.  S: Dark fruit, rustic bread, and faint autolysed yeast stand out in the smell. Unctuous and intense spirituous qualities are also detected after a few sips. Alcohol is well-integrated, rather than obvious.  T: Begins off-dry, with roasted malt and fruity acidity. Flavors expand into the middle, boasting shoyu umami, bitter chocolate, licorice, and even vanilla. The finish is mineral-ashy, with inconsistent moderate bitterness cutting a sharp line on the palate at times. Alcohol vapors linger.  M: Thick viscosity, remarkably smooth early, with low carbonation.  D/O: An old can, set aside since 2009, yields a Ten Fidy experience worthy of the praise that led me to buy the pricey 4-pack in the first place. While this beer was found to be chokingly laden with shoyu qualities when it was young, it wears its maturity well in its fourth year. The heavy-handedness of its origins will never fade entirely, but this sample's profile falls well within the accepted--if not preferred--parameters of the style. Surprisingly good, compared to the last encounter.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,d5001986,4.43,"12oz can poured into tulip. Appears super thick and deep black with little light-brownish head. Smells sweet and roasty. Taste is so rich, sweet chocolate and coffee with an underlying roastyness. Feels very slick and heavy, like oil.  Overall a great can of stout. An good value at about $10/4. Also I find this beer to drink best with a little age on it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,gcamparone,4.57,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a snifter and allowed to warm as I drank it. Purchased in North Providence, RI.  A- Pours a pitch black body with virtually no head or carbonation present. Brown lacing.  S- Heavenly.. Vanilla, chocolate, maple syrup, roasty malt, coffee beans, and dark fruit. Just delightful to smell.  T- Upfront I get a lot of milk chocolate, vanilla. This progresses into a roasty, burnt coffee, toasted malt flavor. Slight dark fruit notes on the follow through. Has an awesome roasty finish.  M- Thick, creamy. Low carbonation. Very smooth.  What an excellent imperial stout. May take the place as my new favorite russian imperial stout, I will have to do a blind side-by-side with founder's imperial stout. Reminds me of a non-ba version of bcbs. Recommendable.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,hermit990,4.68,"12 oz can poured into a goblet. Canned on 11/26/12.  Appearance: The color is an opaque, impenetrable black. There is about 1 finger worth of a tan head off the pour, which recedes to a foam on top leaving a ring of lacing on the glass. The liquid looks very thick and viscous when swirled around the glass. Good retention of the lacing, sticking to the glass and leaving alcohol legs as the beer is agitated. A very good looking imperial stout.  Smell: On the nose, there is an immediate sweetness that invades the nostrils. The sweetness is joined by notes of chocolate and dark fruits (raisins and figs) as it lingers in the nose. I also pick up some hints of roasted grains and breadiness, almost resembling freshly baked cookies as they mix with the sweetness. At 10.50% abv, some hints of alcohol are also present in the aroma. A very complex aroma, seeming to unlock more of the grain notes as it warms in the glass. Generally on the sweeter side, which is just fine with me.  Taste: There is a slight sweetness as it hits the tongue, gradually morphing with the milk chocolate and fruit tastes that were present in the aroma. As it remains on the tongue, a bitterness sets in, leaving tastes of roasted grain to hang. This fades into a bitter, roasty aftertaste on the tongue. Considering the abv, the alcohol flavor is well hidden. Very delicious, layered flavors to this one.  Mouthfeel: Similar to the appearance, it's very viscous in the mouth. It feels very thick as it swishes through the mouth, coating the tongue and palate and cheeks as it travels through. The heavy feels matches well with the lingering tastes that remain in the mouth. The alcohol is much more present in the feel, leaving a warming on the tongue and throat during the swallow.  Overall: To me, this is very much what I'm looking for in an imperial stout. The sweeter notes fit well with my tastes and makes for a very enjoyable beer. This is personally one of my favorites, and I try to always keep some on hand. It is a little on the pricier side at $15 for a 4 pack in my area, but in my mind it's well worth the price. I would highly recommend trying this one.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,tviz33,4.7,"Poured from a 12 oz can, served in a pint glass.  A- The body is the closest thing to motor oil that I've seen in a beer. The brown head is only about a half-finger high but it looks thick.  S- The first thing I notice about the smell is the chocolate. It smells thick, sweet, and rich.  T- The chocolate is still noticeable, but is balanced out by caramel, coffee, and smoky awesomeness. This is an absolute treat.  M- Full-bodied as full-bodied can be. Creamy and thick. The brew sticks to my entire mouth and there's a nice burn from the alcohol at the end.  O- This is well worth a try for every aspect of the beer. Ten Fidy fires on all cylinders. This surpasses Old Rasputin for me.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

This disappears and leaves a ring around the glass, about which some light lacing tries but can't quite cling to the glass.  The smells are dark roasted malt, chocolate, and a rich booziness. A hint of dark fruit in there as well.  The taste follows the nose, with chocolate and coffee on the end with the booze.  Mouthfeel is full bodied. Has a slight creaminess to it, but it washes down pretty quick. Leaves a slight residue on the tongue.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,timc100,4.58,"Fresh can  Pours pitch black out of the can, big dark mocha head - fantastic looking beer. The smell is huge - bitter dark chocolate and coffee, and a nearly dominating grapefruit and pine hop character. Some chocolate covered tart cherries as well - serve as the middle man between the coffee/chocolate and hops. Taste is incredible - full and vibrant. Dark roast coffee beans, chocolate, hop bite, burnt caramel. Very bitter and sweet beer, in fact. Amazing, super delicious stuff.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,Stevedore,4.06,"12oz can, canned 9/28/12, poured into a Bell's tulip and quaffed today, 3/13/13  Aroma: Smells thickly sweet, like molasses. Hints of nice roasty malt character that you would get from stouts, but covered up by the molassy sweetness. Smells nice. (4)  Colour: Damn. This beer is some sort of a black hole, seems like light disappears when it hits it. Doesn't even illuminate brown. Pours with a generous 3cm brown head that takes almost 3-5 minutes to dissipate. Lacing is superb. You can't do much better than this in terms of RIS appearances. (5)  Flavour: Follows the nose- you get a lot of thick molasses with hints of caramel and dark chocolate. Not so much coffee as I'd get in other stouts. I get a wee bit of umami soy sauce-like flavour on the back end which I attribute to the hop character. Really good! I don't feel the heat at all in this beer. (4)  Mouthfeel: It's thick bodied, creamy and smooth. Glides over my tongue and the surfaces of my mouth like I would imagine motor oil would (though I haven't personally quaffed motor oil). Carbonation is great. Aftertaste is of the umami along with some sweet molasses that lingers just right- up to 10-30 seconds at a time. (4)  Overall: It looks great and feels great. Not the most complex RIS I've had, but its definitely the sexiest appearing, thickest on the mouth RIS. It definitely holds up to any other RIS on the market. And its really nice to know that I can pick this off the shelf anytime, anywhere in WI. I plan to get some more tomorrow.

Hits pretty hard with the high ABV. One of the better Stouts I've ever had (and Stouts are my favorite type of beers)! Only thing better I've had so far is Founders CBS + KBS, Bolt Cutter, and maybe 1 or 2 others I can't remember off the top of my head. It's REALLY GOOD!

The outer limits of what could be considered a ""liquid."" A small one inch head forms very slowly and stays for a while. Strong, sticky lacing.  Smell is of chocolate and roasted malts.  The taste is similar. Dark, rich chocolate, as well as sweet milk chocolate, with vanilla, oak, slight soy sauce, and dark fruits such as raisins. The roasted malt melds well with everything else, and doesn't add bitterness.  The alcohol is noticeably absent, incredibly. So smooth, creamy, thick, and viscous.

Just for fun after I poured this I took glass into a dark room and put 150 lumens of light under and on side of glass and no light penetrated this beautiful stout.  S: As somebody else has already stated it is strong on roasted malts and the presence of coffee is pleasent.  T: I'm not going to say much about the taste on this one except that I was a little disappointed here. Although it does satisfy the taste buds for us stout fans I believe there are better tasting Russian imperial stouts out there to choose from (especially for the price I paid).  M: Creamy explosion of flavors I expect from this style . . . Ten Fidy is smooth and won't let you down.  O: Not bad at all ! If you are a fan of Russian imperial stouts you'll like this brew and again it won't let you down. Favorite thing about this one is at 10.5 the alcohol taste is well hidden.

Dark brown almost black thick while pouring. Very dark black inside the glass. Opaque.  Aroma is full of burnt up malts. Very charred and dark roasted. A slight presence of coffee and dark chocolate. No booze. Roasted malts provide a nice aroma. Overall strength is medium to good. No strong by any means.  Taste is a good amount of roasted malts upfront. Some bitterness in the middle and towards the end. Good use of hops and charring sensation provide a well balanced dry yet bitter finish. Some amount of coffee and cocoa in the flavor as well. No apparent alcohol.  Mouth feel is full bodied. Thick with a strong presence. A good warming feel. No astringency but bitterness is pervasive mostly due to charred malts.  Excellent brew.

2681,34483,BigBarley,4.73,"First TEN FIDY I've ever had, due to not realizing it was available anywhere in Texas. Reviewing live.  A - Pours like bloody motor oil, yielding about 2 fingers of head that quickly receded by about half. Head is a unique and nice looking brown/khaki color. All around, easily one of the best looking stouts I've ever seen (and it's pretty hard for a the look of a stout to stand out)  S - Serious dark fruit, a deep roasted smokey quality, heavy on the molasses with a hint of cocoa and vanilla, possibly some burnt wood. Smells darker than dark  T - Lot's of dark, bitter fruit notes (imagine plum or currant without sweetness), complimented by some dark chocolate and a very faint hop profile buried below (either hops or just a bitter flavor residue from the sheer blackness of this beer), somewhere way in the back is a touch of dark coffee and raisin. Sweet on the finish, all around delicious and flavorful.  M - Carbonation? Well, all that went into making the head. This is nothing but black oil. It still has that bite behind it, but for the most part it's simply a creamy beast. Thick and smooth.  O - Well... this beer deserves the hype. any fan of imperial stout (or powerful beer in general) should drink this when and if they can. Wow.

Man I could get lost in this aroma. The maple/vanilla sweetness really sets this beer aside from other RIS.  Taste: The sweetness takes over in the taste of this brew. A really nice hop bitterness bites on the front of the beer which leads to the vanilla malt body. The high ABV cannot be felt expect in the wonderfully warming sensation as this beer goes down. A hop dryness sticks on the palette for a long time.  Mouthfeel: Thick and syrupy. Creamy texture which sends this brew down too easy.

The head is decently tall, about one fat finger, and dark mocha brown in color. The amount of head is surprising for 10.5% ABV. A chunk or two remains laced to the glass. Great looking RIS.  S-Smell is rich with heavily roasted malts. I detect notes of dark chocolate, coffee, and also a touch of warm, caramel-scented alcohol. The smell, unlike some RISs, is not overly bitter to my nose.  T-Taste mostly tracks the smell, but I find the taste to be more complex. I still get that ultra-rich, slightly caramel malt flavor, and a certain amount of semi-sweet chocolate and coffee, but there is also a booze-soaked fruit component (macerated cherries come to mind). A little smokiness on the tail-end, too.  M-Feel is heavy, carbonation is low, and it matches the brew well.  O-Having had Old Raspy and Narwhal recently, I was curious to see how Ten Fidy would hold up (especially against Narwhal, which I thought was a great brew). The canned beer does just fine, thank you. The flavors here are complex, the heat is nicely integrated, the appearance is right, and the feel is a great match. The only let-down (and I use that term loosely) is the smell. The nose just doesn't match the rest of the beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JohnnyBarman,4.5,"Single can from Premier Gourmet in Buffalo. Pricey, but I've heard so much good about this brew I had to indulge. Something special for my 700th review!  Ten Fidy pours a viscous inky blank into my Duvel tulip, producing a dark tan head of about an inch that settles into a thick ring. Each sip shows the real weight of this brew, generating a sheet of lacing.  Amazing nose for a canned stout - hell, for any stout. Sweet and mildly boozy, caramel, toasted malt, coffee, chocolate syrup, and a slight hint of smoke. Just smelling this brew is a treat.  Intense, delicious stout which displays remarkable balance of the aforementioned flavours. Begins sweet, with caramel, chocolate liqueur and coffee, before transitioning to a drier, roastier brew with smoke, toasted bread and sugar. Mild hops enter here. Surreal.  Smooth and silky, nice light but persistent carbonation.  If you are fortunate enough to have Ten Fidy in a nearby store, please send some this way! Why did I only buy one can?",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

There is some lacing, which is more than I expected.  Smell: Big roasted malt, brown sugar, caramel, coffee, yum.  Taste: Barley and roasted malts combine nicely with subtle coffee. A hop punch hits in the middle and then fades as the malt becomes evident once again, fading into a bitter, clean finish. Booze is hid nicely.  Mouthfeel: Just right, not exactly viscous nor thin. Medium bodied feel that lends nicely to the downability of this beverage.  Overall: Glad I got to try this.

2681,34483,DocJitsu,4.46,"Pours an opaque, very dark brown, with a diminutive light mocha colored head that dissipates quickly. If the head was a bit larger, and I tried to create that with my pour, and long-lasting, this would have been an extraordinarily gorgeous beer. As it is, it's just really, really sexy. The nose is huge chocolate with some British yeast notes wafting at times. The mouthfeel is creamy and viscous. It dries out like Baker's chocolate at the finish. There's also a bit of carbonation bite that occurs late. The flavor is a bit lacking. There's definitely some dark cholcolate, a bit of lactose, and some tart cherry that emerges in the middle and lingers after all else has passed. Some coffee bitterness is also noted after the beer has been swallowed.

2681,34483,tekn0ph1sh,4.5,I have been on a stout kick as of late. This was my latest find. And what I have been comparing all of my other stouts to.  Poured into a pint glass. It was thick and dark like pouring motor oil from a can. It had maybe a quarter inch reddish brown had that quickly dissipated to a little bit of lace around the edges.  I was thinking I wasn't going to like this beer all that much. It smells like chocolate and espresso and dark fruit.  I took my first sip and it tastes almost like it smells and is velvety thick and smooth as it goes down with a warming feeling in your belly as it settles. It is very nice and smooth. It is well balanced and the favors just meld together.  My only complaint about it is that at around 5 bucks a can...it's pretty steep but at 10.5 abv you don't need all that many to have a good night.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Argion,4.6,"I was looking at the list of top imperial stouts on this site and came across this beer. My local distributor had it and I was surprised to see it was in a can. That threw me off a bit, but given the good ratings it has received on the site I decided to give it a try. All I can say is wow.... it poured a very dark/black colour with no head whatsoever. The combination of flavors was very good with hints of chocolate and espresso in it. There was some sweetness on the tailend of the beer but it was not as bad as other imperial stouts I have tried.

Big, malty, chocolate-forward flavor...dark cocoa, toasted caramel, subtle vanilla, bread, and some coffee bitterness. Purply berries, raisins, vinous notes, and hint of port in the end.

There is an oddly tall and billowy head of foam that comes out initially, though it does settle into a thin dark brown layer that sits on top of the body of beer, lacing left behind is quite steady, thick, clingy, and remarkable.  S (3.75) — Loads of dark roasted malts, charred malts, licorice, anise, light cinnamon, tobacco, malt, leather, cocoa, bitter espresso, lightly alcoholic and bitter.  T (4.5) — Notes of tobacco, dark chocolate, burnt Maillard notes of licorice, molasses, smoky charred barley and malt. Load of leather, lightly smoky malt notes.

O (4.5) — Great overall, fresh this is a bit hotter and less developed, this little can really picks up steam with some age, I didn't expect this to age as well as it did, but I will be going back to buy more to lay down.

2681,34483,Efay,4.67,"Every time I've had this beer I've been preoccupied to do a real review! I picked up a 4pack after a long, cold day in the Chicago weather to warm me up. Poured into a pint glass and enjoyed.  A- Poured black, with some light being able to refract some dark brown color on the edge of the glass. This thing is really dark! When poured, big bubbles of foam, equaling around 3 fingers worth of dark caramel head was present. However, there was not much retention, but some spotty lacing appeared.  S- Initially I got a scent of booze, but I then got smells of baker's chocolate with some burn malt that was highly defined. This all ended with a smell of burnt sugar that made this thing smell pleasantly sweet, but complimented with the alcohol and bitter burnt malt.  T- Smooth and sweet baker's chocolate, followed by some sweet toffee. Ends with some bitter coffee and malt flavors that make this oh so enjoyable.  M- Moderate body for an IRS. Nice and smooth with a little amount of carbonation. Ends with a nice warmth down the esophagus.  O- This IRS is to die for. This beer is highly drinkable yet very complex. The great thing though is it's not too complex and I can drink a 4 pack of this in one session it's that good. It also isn't hot on the tongue but you do feel that nice warmth down your esophagus.

Chocolate explodes out of the aroma, with a hint of soy. Roast malt and malted milk balls combine with booze, a little coffee, vanilla, and licorice to round things out. Dark fruit notes of cherries, figs, and raisins emerge.  Roast malt dominates the flavor throughout. Not as sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe. Chocolate, dark cherries, and toasted nuts form the background. Booze is subtle, along with vanilla and raisins, which carry into a coffee ground, slightly bitter finish. Sherry notes emerge as it warms.  Body is slick and syrupy, with minimal carbonation and slight alcohol warmth.  Very complex brew. Roast malt and dark fruit are in good balance.

2681,34483,rodlavers,4.34,"Canned 10/19/12, poured into my Founders snifter. First time reviewing this, but I have had it in the past before.  Glug, glug, glugs out of the can, resulting in a towering three-finger dark mocha head; bubbly and foamy. Head falls to a thin layer of a slightly lighter color, with chunks of lacing sticking behind. Almost black in color, motor oil black. Looks like a delicious Imperial Stout, I would say nearly perfect.  Full-bodied roasted malt aroma dominates at first, and throughout the drinking experience, though it does mellow along the way. I do not smell coffee or chocolate.  Taste is similar, but I do get hints of chocolate. Obviously severely roasted malt dominates, but I do get a dark chocolate flavor in there as well. It's also slightly bitter/hopped up a bit. Very enjoyable.  Feel is incredibly smooth until the end when the bitterness is noticeable. Perhaps most impressive, Ten Fidy somehow masks the 10.5% ABV incredibly well, where with others in the style there is a considerable amount of heat that goes hand in hand. Here, there is no such ""heat"" accompanied by high ABV.  Overall, this is an amazing, unique imperial stout that I would love to get more of, even a case, maybe?

During the pour, it splashes into the glass with a deep brown/purple color that I've never seen in a beer before. The head is a smooth, chocolate brown color of its own.  The aroma has a boozy, slightly cocoa flavor, with a touch of plum and sweetness.  The flavor is fantastic overall. There's just the right amount of heat, which compliments the slight, dry chocolate primary flavor. Sweetness comes from a touch of vanilla, with some nice sweet raisin and a touch of fruitiness. Finishes dry and slightly bitter, but clean. For as big and bad as the can and pour look, this beer is like a big, soft pillow in the flavor. Pleasant and delightful all around.  Mouthfeel is just right; not too syrupy, not too thin.  Just a great beer all around. This is easily one of the best widely-available big ABV stouts, and certainly the best one in a can.

2681,34483,fmccormi,4.29,"Straight pour from a 12oz can to my trusty Cigar City snifter; canning date of October 18, 2012 printed in black ink on the can’s kick-up (“CANNED ON 10-18-12 @ 12:30 BLACK HOLE, SON!!”). Black hole, indeed.  Appearance (4.25): One fat finger of milk chocolate-colored foam caps a body that is as black hole-ish as was alluded to in the canning date information. It’s black, nothing else. The had shows a surprising amount of retention and lace: fat, broad legs of foam stick to the sides of the glass just below wherever you’ve taken a sip.  Smell (4.0): Iced coffee with a little cream in it, dark chocolate (like 70% cocoa +), mocha ice cream, double chocolate chip cookies—you get the picture. Roasty coffee, dark chocolate, and some sweet, doughy undertones fill out the nose very, very nicely.  Taste (4.5): Whoa, even richer than the nose—way richer, and just great. Roasty coffee bitterness without any of the soy sauce potential you get in lesser imperial stouts mixes with a rich, deeply earthy, creamy chocolate character. There’s actually a bit of grapefruit rind bitterness in the finish, but it’s relatively subtle and melds well with the mix of coffee bitterness and chocolate aftertaste that comes across in the malt body. And amazingly, there’s really minimal alcohol detected—just a bit of that warming, vaporous feel toward the end, just before the swallow and then again right after it. Very, very smooth for how big, bitter, and rich this beer. More of that earthy character, which I love.  Mouthfeel (4.25): As mentioned above, smooth. It’s full-bodied and somewhat viscous, but not quite syrupy. The alcohol and maybe a bit of hop oil character helps to dry out the finish, but I certainly wouldn’t call this a “dry” beer. Just a very addictive sipper.  Overall (4.25): This is a great beer—and imperial stout that’s full-bodied, full-flavored, and still something of a crowd pleaser. I would definitely recommend this to someone interested in getting into the style, because it’s not too sweet or syrupy but it’s also not so distastefully charred and bitter as some can be. But the earthiness mentioned above, which is like the intersection of the chocolate flavor and the hop component of the beer, is what really gets me—it adds a very nice depth to the experience. Really, really tasty.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Dark chocolates, Expresso, maybe some dark fruits, roasted malts.  T: Creamy, following nose with chocolates and coffe notes. Big flavors that I enjoy with an imperial stout.  M: Full bodied. Thick but not overly so. Creamy and coats the palette nicely.  O: Easily one of the best stouts. One of my goto choices.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,circus_cat,5,"A: Motor oil black with a light brown, almost maroonish creamy head leaving pretty nice lacing. Looks very rich and inviting.  S: Roasted malts, espresso, baker's chocolate, just a hint of vanilla, and some dark fruits in the background. The smell is incredible.  T: Mirrors the nose in many ways which is a very good thing. Lots of dark chocolate, plums, strong espresso, and roastiness. Wow.  M: Thick, creamy, smooth. What I imagine most stouts to be, only this time I'm not disappointed.  O: One of the few beers I've had where I find no flaws.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Roasted malts, dark chocolate, a little coffee as well as some nice sweet fruity aromas.  T: Lots of roasted malts, espresso, dark chocolate, smoke, and a little fruit. There are hops in there somewhere, but hard to find with all the other strong flavors. The alcohol is very well hidden.  M: Full bodied with just enough carbonation. Super smooth...almost perfect.  O: There's nothing bad I can say about this beer. It's damn near perfect.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Sludgeman,4.8,"Rerated on November 4, 2015.  $14.99/4-pack at TW-McLean. Canned on Sept 23, 2015. Consumed and rated on Nov 4, 2015. Poured into a chalice.  A decadent chocolate milkshake with the complexities of a fine wine. Quite possibly the best beer aroma ever. Certainly, an aroma that competes with the best hoppy IPA aromas out there. 4.75  A – Pours an inky black with reddish brown highlights. Has a two-finger reddish brown mousey head with white highlights. Good sticky lacing. Pours viscous, almost like a chocolate milkshake. 5.0  S – Milk chocolate, roasted barley, not burnt, sweet, almost unbeer-like, faint alcohol that keeps it from being cloying. Maybe even some slight spiciness and tobacco, faint coffee. 5.0  T – Roasted barley, coffee then chocolate. Alcohol is evident which only adds to the burnt bitter finish. 4.5/4.75  MF – Medium heavy with a dry finish. Creamy smooth, even velvety. 4.5  ----- Purchased at a local bottle shop for $16/4 x 12oz cans.  Poured into a room temp nonic.  A - A somewhat viscous black beer. Pours like chocolate milk. Head is a rich medium brown, almost like moose. 2 fingers high. Average lacing.  S - Roasted malt, chocolate, some hint of nuts, reminds me a little of a chocolate milkshake.  T - Dark chocolate. Roasted malt. Some hops. Ends with some slight bitterness of burnt/roasted malt and hops. Its taste easily hides the 10.5% ABV!  M - Smooth and silky, but not like a nitro-tapped Guiness. Chewy.  O - An excellent beer. Easy to drink. In my top ten. Will always be available in my house.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Nugganooch,4.38,"12oz can to my FW snifter glass Canned 10-15-12 Peanuts Envy  A: Pours a dark coffee brown with the complimentary finger thick of mocha chocolate whip atop. Damn near motor oil status as the name suggests. Definitely dark and lovely in the glass. Persistent head with curtains of etched lace all the way down.  S: The nose carries rich chocolates with some firm roast barley and notes of dry roast coffee. Has a real earthy toasted grain aroma with some ash on it. Not all that intense but nice with some suggestive alcohol spice. Warming opens up a bit more of the roast with some stronger hints of cocoa.  T: Flavors are bold with rich chocolate. Much more than the nose suggests. Follows with additions of coffee bean and dark berry. Dark roasted grains are predominant throughout with a bit of charcoal, vanilla bean, dark licorice, and some earthy chicory or birch root likeness. The beer has a substantial bitter hop charge that brings out some ashy pine notes. There lies some hidden alcohol giving a mild spice kick towards the finish. Great balance considering the intensity of flavors here. Sweet with gobs of dark roast malts but not cloying. All around just a delicious beer.  M: Silken smooth feel with an overall lush cream like quality. Somewhat light on its feet all together. There is a puckering hop bite to the beer with a dry crisping towards the finish. After feel is sticky and sleek across the palate.  D: Deceptively drinkable for such a beast of a brew. Possibly the best beer that does come in a can. Tasting incredibly fresh and very hoppy even for imperial standards. Balanced with plenty of sweet chocolate and roast character followed by a firm alcohol presence. I do enjoy this stout greatly.  I really should be picking these up more often.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,scootny,4.82,"This is one of the greats. Simple as that. Black liquid, dense brown head that leaves sticky spots and streaks. Smell is Godiva meets Starbucks. Taste is as good as it gets with a huge chocolate front that is followed by a heavy roasted grain coffee finish. Hops are plentiful but because of the huge sweetness of the malt they are balanced to the point of playing second fiddle leading into a coffee like finish. The wonderful blend of dark and chocolate malts just lays the floor on this one. A touch of licorice. Finish is surprisingly clean and dry with an extra bold coffee taste lingering. A touch of grapefruit skin as well. Feel is smooth and chewy while remaining light enough to drink way to fast. Satin on the tongue with a perfect and subtle carbonation. One of the best RIS I've ever had. No barrel needed, just vision and expert brewing. WOW!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,boilermakerbrew,4.33,"A- Pours black as night and thick as mud. Pretty large head forms, partly because of a violent pour, but I will also say the beer forms a large head by itself. Head is dense foam of a deeper chocolate color. Among the darkest colored heads I've seen. Lacing and retention is superb.  S- Heavy on the traditional dark malt roasts. Chocolate is the predominant flavor. A fair amount of sweet is there with the chocolate. Other malts are strong and dark in flavor. There is little to no detectable coffee profile in the scent.  T- Very similar to the scent, with the exception of chocolate being prominent. Starts with a big, dark, and somewhat bitter roast flavor profile. More coffee is present here before switching to the sweeter chocolate profile of the scent. Malts, slight coffee, and chocolate combine to present a solid flavor profile that isn't groundbreaking, but very good. This brew ends with a slight bite of the bitterness returning.  M- Creamy and thick, pretty much with an impy stout should feel like. Lower levels of carbonation provide the thick and creamy feel that I like in my big stouts. Towards the end of the drink the alcohol heat is detectable and can be felt down the throat.  Overall, this is an impressive impy stout. I've been looking forward to getting this one, and being near the Ohio border over break provided the opportunity to go get it. Nothing is too out of the ordinary as far as flavor goes, but the weight and feel of this one is pretty good. The only small drawback is the alcohol heat in the back of the throat.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,devlishdamsel,4.68,"I tried this for the first time last night. It was nothing short of amazing. It had an amazing texture, very smooth and velvety, without being overly viscous. The flavor was intense, without being overly rich. That being said I tend to avoid stouts due to the aftermath, but please give me more!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,VonThinker,4.58,"Split a can with a fellow beerphile...  A: Poured into a standard draft glass, about 55 degrees. Color is very dark, almost opaque, espresso like. Viscous pour, leaving a well-formed medium brown head of about 1 1/2 fingers which is slow to dissipate  S: Chocolate prevails, almost ""burned"" or ""campfire-like"" but not overwhelming. Hits to back third of the tongue mostly  T: Chocolate, dark chocolate, burned toast (mild), blending to a fine raisin/caramel/mild coffee like concoction  M: Smooth, full, and creamy. Warm caramel/chocolate aftertaste  O: I am by no means a stout expert and got this based on its reviews here...however if this is at all representative of the fine Russian Imperial type I am sold!! Definitely a ""dessert beer"" This one could catch up with you! Left me with a warm feeling",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,tcanaday,4.58,"Finally got around to picking up a 4 pack last night. Poured from can into a snifter.  Appearance: Motor oil like, no light makes it through this beer. Nice one finger dark mocha like head. Dissipates relatively quickly.  Smell: Not much of an aroma when cold, when warmed up a bit dark fruits are released, a bit of a boozy nose, a lot of malt and smells of intense chocolate.  Taste: The perfect imperial stout, a touch of carbonation, with the perfect balance of chocolate, malts and alcohol.  Mouthfeel: HUGE and thick mouthfeel, mouthfeel reminds me of that of Firestone 16 Anniversary, very thick supple but has a nice thick finish that dries slowly.  Overall: One of my favorite imperial stouts that I've trie thus far. Very drinkable for 10%, great beer for after dinner to appreciate all of the complex flavors of this beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Philousa,4.47,"Imbibed on tap at Original Gravity on 12/14/12.  This is seriously black in color with a wispy dark tan head. Aroma is roasty. Lots of sweet chocolate, somewhat creamy, milky. No presence of alcohol burn. Taste is just as roasty as the aroma. Like burnt chocolate underneath milk chocolate. I get a little alcohol presence, a bit harsh before fading quickly. Some burnt toast follows with dark chocolate. This thing is seriously chocolatey. There is just enough hops to bitter out the dark chocolate: they work in tandem. Great finish, slightly dry. No wonder this is so highly rated. I only hope the carbonation is similar out of a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SlothB77,4.6,"Poured into a pint glass  a: Extremely dark, espresso. With a thin, light brown head. Despite the darkness of the beer, pours thin.  s: Malt, with pungent chocolate, toffee, coffee, caramel  t: Chocolate, coffee, molasses, with a mix of creaminess and bitters in the aftertaste.  m: Roasted malts feel, light-medium bitters and some creaminess too. Light carbonation.  o: Overall, an excellent russian imperial stout. The taste itself doesn't betray the 10.5% ABV that its name does. The flavor doesn't seem as complex as a North Coast Old Rasputin, which I had recently, or as distinctive. Still an excellent winter beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MattSweatshirt,4.15,"New can o Ten Fidy.  Pours thick and viscous. Awesome. It looks black with a dark brown head on it. very nice.  Lots of roast and dark chocolate. Gets a little campfire I guess you could say as well. Diggin it.  Balances well between roast and sweetness but weighs in a bit more of the roasty side. Hits with some bitterness. Nice notes of roast, coffee, and dark chocolate.  The mouthfeel is almost perfect. Thick and full with light carbonation that you can still feel.  Highly enjoyable brew here. Could sip it all day. Went well with a chocolate chip cookie I broke out towards the end of the glass.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MVotter,4.88,"A - Darkest brew I've ever seen.  S - Toasted and burnt malts, coffee  T - Sweet malts, mocha coffee, hops finish for balance  M - Plenty of effervescence, heavy.  O - Overall experience is a stout lover's dream. Be ready for a robust, extremely flavorful and significant brew. This is not one of those sneaky, ""deceptively strong"" beers. Ten Fidy makes no excuses for its hugeness...never hiding anything, starts and remains delicious throughout. Imperial, indeed!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Ryanthebear,4.5,"Appearance- Poured from a 12oz can into a wine glass inky black with a light brown head that sustained itself nicely.  Aroma- lots of coffee, chocolate, and roasty malt. Some alcohol.  Taste- bitter cocoa, sweet malt.  Mouthfeel- probably the most interesting part of this beer... More effervescent than I expected, in a pleasantly surprising way. Like syrup in the middle, and finishing like an oatmeal cookie... borderline chewable. Pretty fantastic.  Overall- mmm, good. Drinks like a meal, but I still want another one for dessert.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JWU,4.53,"12oz. can poured into a snifter.  A- Pitch black, no light penetration. Darkest head I've seen on a stout, like dark chocolate. Some light lacing on the alcohol legs. Best looking impy stout I've seen.  S- Deep, rich notes of coffee, chocolate, some roasty char, and booze.  T- Char, french roast coffee, dark chocolate, some light dark malty sweet notes, but a fantastic light bitterness to balance. Fan-freaking-tastic.  M- Rich, thick and syrupy. Creamy mouthfeel, with a light carbonation to scrub the palette and move things along.  O- Certainly one of the finest RIS's I've ever had. Will seek this one out.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Dave1999,5,"Pours pitch black with a small tan coloured head.  The smell i dark malts, dark fruits, cherries and alcohol.  The taste is dark roasted malts, milk chocolate with a bit of bitterness to the aftertaste. Hides it's abv very well.  The mouth feel is smooth and creamy with low carbonation.  Overall this is an excellent beer, the mouth feel is spot on and the abv is undetectable. I'm not sure about the price though, about double that of old rasputin.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Siriusfisherman,4.25,"A: Poured a deep black with a nice two-finger brown head, very good lacing.  S: The smell is strongly of roasted malts giving notes of chocolate, espresso, cookie, and subtle dark cherry. Some booze is detectable, as well as some spicy columbus hops.  T: The Taste is more of the same, with an emphasis on the cookie and chocolate, but still wonderful roasted notes. A nice hop bitterness throughout gives perfect balance to the sweetness. The hops also make an appearance in the flavor, in a nice spicy character that blends in with the roast.  Mouthfeel: The smoothest beer I have ever had. The robustness and silkiness of this ale is in perfect harmony with the low carbonation, letting the flavors take the stage. Perfect.  Overall: I absolutely love this beer, it is nearly flawless in my mind. It is rich and and complex beyond belief. I wish I got another four-pack, I could drink this for desert on a regular basis.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

More dried fruit then the nose, a little chocolate, malt, perfect amount of booze, dry finish. Smooth. B e utiful  M: chewy. Perfect or as close to perfect as I can remember.  O: the taste and mouthfeel are what set it apart. Amazing. I have the bad habit of drinking delicious big beers, like this one, way too fast.

2681,34483,rappmann,4.58,"Poured from a can into Duvel tulip. Reviewed from notes.  A - Literally pours completely jet black. Oily is a good word to describe it. Two fingers of tan head that dissipates into a thin wisp over the beer. Great lacing, Great looking beer.  S - Boozy bitterness, sweet malt, dark bitter chocolate, and some nice deep fruit notes that I love in a stout.  T - Bitter dark chocolate really comes through, really well balanced, not too malty or sweet, the dark chocolate really helps balance it out.  M - Again likening this brew to oil is the best comparison. In a word, I would describe it as slick. Very nice carbonation, really nice beer to sip on.  O - A great beer, that I had wanted to try for a long time. Really what can I say that hasn't been said on these reviews. Seek it out, it's worth every penny!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Triglycerides,4.25,"Poured from a 12 oz can (naturally) into a tulip.  A: I was really surprised as to how ridiculously dark this beer is. As I poured it it seemed to have the dark pitch black look of motor oil. There's a nice mocha head that slowly forms to the top of the glass which is about 1 inch in height, but dissipates to about 0.5in, leaving nice lacing. Pretty impressed just by this.  S: Aroma is rich and malty with a bit of smokiness in the background. There's a bit of subtle fruitiness in the background.  T: Follows the smell with a rich malty profile, with some flavours of molasses coming through. Finishes dry with that familiar roasted malt/coffee type with a bit of dark (like &gt;70%) chocolate that I love about a good RIS.  M: I noticed it was a bit thick and heavy whilst pouring it. Mouthfeel definitely follows. Definitely heavy and filling, although the carbonation helps lighten it up a bit.  O: Definitely an expensive brew at about $4 ea, but well worth seeking out if you can. You're going to want to sip this one and never be disappointed.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,WiscoBrewsco,4.84,"Poured into an imperial pint glass  Appearance - Black as night and thick as motor oil, very low carbonation, thin tan head that doesn't stick around for very long,  Smell - Rich toasted malts, milk chocolate, coffee and a hidden floral hop smell but it's no surprise that it is there since this beer clocks in at a massive 98 IBU's  Taste - Massive chocolate and malt notes come in right away and fill the mouth. The hop presence makes itself known on the tongue but very subtly. Slight coffee tint near the end but oh that finish down the throat. It is like drinking liquid brownies. And the 10.5% ABV is completely hidden which is very impressive  Mouthfeel - Very smooth and textured mouthfeel. Good creaminess to it. The malt bill provides for a good bite  Overall - This is a fantastic beer in every respect. One of the best stouts I have ever had. The taste is just decadent and defines excess in every sense. Everything you could ask for in a beer from the malt bill to the hops and the rich chocolate. This is a beer to be treasured and not ignored, simply because it comes from a can. Most likely the best stout on the market that is available year round",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Neorebel,4.53,"And now, for my Ten Fidy review... I have been waiting a long time to try this beer! It looks perfect... nearly opaque cola-colored syrup flows out of the can as a cascade of bubbles comes to a very frothy, tan colored head. The head later recedes, but stays put at about 1/2"" tall. It sticks nicely to the side of the glass. The beer looks like an espresso, which is very pleasing to me. The aroma is very vibrant, with wonderful dark fruits, such as raisins, dark chocolate, fresh coffee, grains, and smokiness. There is a zesty hint of some sort of citrus fruit tucked away in there somewhere, too. Now for the first sip... after a big mouthful I pause to take in just how rich and overwhelming this is! It's like a mouthful of devil's food cake. I actually pick up very sweet cherries initially, before the roasted, doughy chocolate and espresso flavors wash over it. Still, in the finish the cherries and bittersweet hops sneak out for a second. As the beer coats my mouth and goes down, it is very warming with the alcohol presence very apparent. Although being full-bodied is an understatement here as well, I can't put it down. One of the best stouts I've ever had. Not for those who are intimidated by very big beers.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S: Rich and nutty, with sweet notes of chocolate and malt.  T: Rather bitter to me at first, and subsides into a more chocoately deliciousness. Definitely a lot of malt.  M: Very heavy and filling.  O: Overall a wonderful RIS that gets better as it warms up a bit.

2681,34483,jsprain1,4.71,"A- Pretty much black. Head is huge thick and brown. Falls to two fingers and stays there. Two solid rings of lacing. S- Sweet, roasted, and all sorts of nice flavors. Coffee, Chocolate, caramel, a bit of earth, a bit of hops. Very nice. T- Starts sweet with an interesting and odd blend of caramel, apple, spice, and grapefruit. Gets more roasted with espresso flavors and dark coffee. finish is a huge kick of roasted flavors and hops competing and complimenting. M- You can see it's thick the moment you pour it. Smooth.

Like a sexy simple black dress, this beer is working the glass.  S - Extremely pungent rich dark chocolate notes with espresso coffee notes you'd except in a RIS and a healthy dose of booze, sweet vanilla and caramel mingle with the aforementioned notes.  T - Yum, the chocolate is bittersweet and wholesome and fills the palate right before coffee notes and a bit of vanilla, malt, oak, smoke and a touch of earthy bitter notes touch the tongue and diminish as warming booze replenishes the soul. This beer is too complex, is too aromatic and pretty to drink from the can.  M - Full bodied, moderate-high carbonation, slick, oily, thick mouth feel with appropriately loud warming booze.  O - My favorite canned RIS, equally excellent on tap and among the best showing from Oskar Blues. This is one hearty beer with complex chocolate flavor and great balance.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S - nothing too special here. The weakest part of the beer. There is a hint Oof soy and some alcohol present.  T - Sublime. Some great roasted notes, hints of soy, dark chocolate, and oil. Just awesome if you like stouts with depth.  M - thick and chewy. Perfect for this style of beer. Coats the mouth but in a pleasant way.  O - A great beer.

2681,34483,MarioM,4.5,"12 oz can poured into a Delirium Tremens snifter.  A: Pours a heavy thick pitch black opaque liquid with a dark brown foamy head that quickly dissipated to a thin rim of foam with a few random medium sized bubbles left behind. This is what an RIS should look like, and even more epic by the fact that its OUT OF A CAN! God I Love this beer.  S: Rich dark fruits, dark brown sugar and maybe some molasses with a hint of dark fruits. This beer smells delicious. Slight roast but no coffee or chocolate like what would be expected. Mainly dry dark fruits and a touch of anise with lots of dark brown sugars. A bit sweet smelling as well. Cant wait to taste, as always.  T: Oh yeah. Nice soft coffee character mixed with wonderful and complex dark fruits mixed with a touch of anise/licorice and lots of dark dark fruits. A tad sweet with a nice grain malt sweetness that reminds me of unfermented wort when brewing a RIS and tasting it before pitching yeast. Just plain delicious.  M: Nice and thick with a gentle lingering bitterness and roast. Sweetness is also there along with dark brown sugar and dark fruits along with the lingering anise character that follows through to the taste after the aroma and keeps going through the mouthfeel.  O: One of my all time favorite imperial stouts and will continue to be for a while. A must try and fan favorite of everyone that I've gotten to try. I'm in CA so coming across such a gem come rare unless paying premium at a bar, which is worth whatever price at any bar just to try. Great great beer.

Tastes like i just ate a box of Whoppers.  10% abv and a nicely hidden 98 IBU complete this as a winner. I love hops and Whoppers and I'm glad i pulled the trigger on this one. 4 pk apx $15 could make this an every now and then. Some say way to hyped, but I'm sassified .

2681,34483,adamette,4.31,"Live review. I literally just returned from my favorite bottle shop, Save-On in Mentor, Ohio. I purchased a four pack for $13.99 from the fridge near the back of the store. Wally and his sister (her name escapes me) were very good to me as always. Poured into a clean, clear glass.  A Oil black body under a dark brown (that is DARK brown!) creamy head. I cannot imagine that the look of this beer could be any better. I also enjoy the can that resembles an oil can. The similarity cannot be a coincidence. 5.0  S Dark roast malt and some chocolately goodness but this is a rather distant smell. I had to attempt two or three smells in order to get that scent. 4.0  T/M Wow. This is one great Stout! Dark roast malt, velvety sweet malt goodness predominate. I did not count on the slight effervescense of carbonation in the feel but it is welcomed. This is such a big, huge beer that describing it is difficult. This is one of the deepest, darkest beers that you will find. The taste and the feel are very hard to improve on. 4.5  O/D Drinkability is not that high. The ABV is over 10% and it is such a huge beer. Really, I would only handle one of these in an evening. Overall this is a world class stout. 4.0  Notes: Thanks to Oskar Blues for finally distributing to Ohio. I had to travel to Atlanta before now to find this. Now it is at my favorite bottle shop!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ChiPool,3.68,"Can poured into snifter. Date on can (blurry).  Pours like motor oil into this snifter. Comes with about 3/4 inch of tan colored head, which leaves a bit of foam around the edges of the glass. Smell offers a bit of dark fruits, and a bit like tiramisu (cocoa & alcohol). Taste meets expectations for a RIS: lingering bitterness, and a bit sweeter that some that i've had. I do like the mouthfeel on this one: just the right amount of gravity to me. No off notes to mention: cold probably use a bit of maturing.  Overall: at face value, I enjoy this. I have to say that I'd take Old Raspy 10/10 times over Ten Fidy, especially for the price. I would like to try this on nitro at some point.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Moderate amount of bubbles. Solid three fingers of tan head that slowly fade into a thin layer. Leaves a lot of creamy lacing around the glass.  Smell: A very roasty and fairly sweet aroma. Dark roasted malts with big hints of chocolate cocoa, coffee, burnt caramel, oats, toast, toffee, and a little vanilla. Some molasses and burnt sugar. Hints of dark raisin and prune. Also a hint of anise spice and smoke. Light hints of earthy hops. A scent of booze is also noticeable. Smells pretty good.  Taste: Like the aroma, a very roasty and fairly sweet dark taste. Dark roasted malts with a big taste of chocolate, burnt toast, caramel, toffee, oatmeal, vanilla, and a little smoke. A fair amount of burnt sugar and molasses adds some sweetness. A little bit of anise spice. Undertones of dark fruits including raisin, prune, and dark cherry. Light earthy hops add some bitterness. A little alcohol heat is tasted. Taste is fairly sweet but well balanced by the bitter roast. Very good.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Creamy, chewy, and fairly thick. A little alcohol heat is felt.

2681,34483,hopstermonster1,4.48,"This imperial stout is one that deserves recognition. I poured this from a can into a tulip shaped beer glass. Color is very black and the consistency is thick and heavy. It smells like dried fruits with toasted dark coffee beans mixed together. It is a bit alcoholic tasting, but not overwhelming. When I first sipped this beer, I was immediately reminded of my love for imperial stouts. Oscar Blues did a awesome job with this one. If you see this beer in your area, I highly recommend sampling it!!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ScaryEd,4.94,"Pours the blackest color I've ever seen. This is the definition of ""the absence of light."" It's like Helen Keller's basement. The head is a dark brown color and sticks around for a long time. Leaves some decent lacing.  The smell is smokey and a bit leathery, with plenty of notes of dark chocolate. Just a hint of coffee comes through and lets you know ""yep, I'm smelling a stout"".  The taste is just absolutely ridiculous. So much chocolate, and not just one kind. I can taste sweet, milk chocolate, as well as dark. The burnt, roasted coffee is very subtle but adds a bit of bitterness to balance out the sweet chocolate flavors. There are hops here, but they're like that nerdy kid in school who always gets beat up so he maps out a route through the halls to avoid the bullies. In this case, the bullies are the chocolate flavors. A hint of char lets you know you're drinking a man beer.  The feel is also ridiculous. It's thicker than oatmeal and I believe there is a picture of a can of Fidy next to the word ""velvet"" in the dictionary.  Overall, this is the beer you drink after buying tampons to restore your manhood. It's my favorite stout and one of my favorite beers period.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bcostner1,4.56,"A: Pitch black, viscous, oil slick of a beer. Beautiful.  S: Chocolate, char, malt, cocoa.  T: Delicious. Chocolate, burnt brown sugar, roasted malt, chocolate milk shake, chocolate lava cake, mild booze, coffee hints. What a great melange.  M: Pretty viscous...and a sipper for sure. That being said, absolutely satisfying. Fantastic body...maybe a little too much. And the alcohol definitely hits but not abrasively.  Fantastic beer. I actually like it better fresh than aged. The flavors are much more present, melded, and explosive when fresh. Love it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TheSixthRing,3.74,"Appearance - Pours jet black with dark amber brown edging where light can penetrate. The head is a menacing reddish brown tinge, 2 fingers thick and with good retention. Silky lace with decent stick.  Smell - Chocolate, smokiness, and a touch of anise.  Taste - True to the smell: starts with chocolate and a touch of smoke. Some bitter roast character, but it gets buried by some additional smokey character and mild anise. Hints at dark fruit beneath. A little heat peaks through in the finish, and gets more boozy as it warms. Atertaste consists of the aforementioned, but smoke mostly dominates.  Mouthfeel - Full bodied, with low to moderate carbonation. Chewy at first, but gets a bit smoother on the finish.  Overall - I don't know that it's worth the hefty price, but it's a fairly unique imperial in the least. Mayhap too much smoke that dominates much of the flavor profile. I like this beer, but I don't love it, and for the price point I'd just as soon have a handful of other impys that I enjoy more for less.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S: Dark chocolate, malted milk balls, licorice, prunes, and a hint of roasted malts. Lots going on here, though the aromas are a bit muddled.  T: This beer starts off with intense molasses, caramel, and malted milk ball sweetness. Right behind this, I get some dark chocolate and roasted malts to balance the sweetness, actually quite strong, but not quite enough. The malted milk ball and molasses sweetness is really overpowering here. I also get quite a bit of anise in the flavor.  M: Quite thick and creamy - very good.  O: The complexity here is wonderful - I love the flavors here, there is so much going on. However, the malted milk ball and molasses sweetness is overpowering - it needs more dark chocolate and roast to balance. Either way, a solid RIS.i",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Slight notes of vanilla, malt balls and smoke. Dull trace of alcohol spice.  Strong chocolate and roast malts. Espresso notes and molasses like sweetness. Soft hints of ripe fruit, black licorice and smoke. Medium bitterness with a slight earthy hop flavor. Finishes long and sweet, with some surprise tobacco flavors subtlety making an appearance, as well as some light alcohol notes,  Full bodied, low carbonation.

2681,34483,damndirtyape,4.63,"12oz can (canned on 10-15-12 @ 9:15 Peanuts Envy) poured into a snifter.  Appearance: Pitch black and lets no light through at all when held up to the light. Dense and thick dark tan head at first, slowly died down to a thick ring at the edge and thin skin across the top. Sheets and strands of persistent lacing. A great looking Russian Imperial Stout.  Smell: Rich roasty smell with mild alcohol notes, bittersweet chocolate, some dark fruity esters (a hint of raisin).  Taste: Rich bittersweet chocolate, smooth roasted malt, a pleasant sweetness through it all. It's just a hair on the sweet side of things, but perfectly balanced with roasted malt bitterness and some black coffee-like bitterness at the end. Simple, but very very tasty and well done.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy, thick, and smooth. Just right carbonation on the tongue at the end.  Overall / Drinkability: What an amazingly rich stout! I can see why people rave about this one. A slow sipper on a cool fall night (and would be good this winter, good thing that I bought a 4 pack) and I think would be great with food. I had it with a banana butterscotch muffin at the end and it paired pretty well. Definitely a one at a time beer - the ABV is notable pretty quickly on after starting to drink this one. It warms you up. I can't say I want another one right away....and yet....I wouldn't mind if I didn't have to go to work in the morning. One does sate though.

2681,34483,Danny1217,4.63,"Pitch black. A nice brown head forms and then fades into a ring around the top. Incredibly thick looking. I'm contemplating grabbing out a fork.  Smells nice and roasty. Some coffee notes, and slight dark chocolate. Smells is good but rather subdued compared to...  The taste. Oh Lord! This thing is thick and delicious. Lots of rich roasted characters. Very bitter, exactly how I like my RIS. Coffee, chocolate, and a decent hop profile. Low carbonation and very full body. There's also something mesmerizing about watching a thick stout pour from a can.  Ten Fidy is one of the best stouts out there, and not too difficult to find. It's a bit pricey at about $15 for a 4 pack, but this one is worth shelling out the money when I want something special. A+ Will drink again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,tectactoe,4.39,"The pour is extremely viscous, thick, and blacker than a black hole. Let's put it this way - if your motor oil looks like this, then you should have changed your oil months ago. A creamy, tan-leather head caps the beer as it just sits, still and menacing. Swirling the snifter around allows the head to grow even more as the beer makes a slow and deep sloshing noise as it lapses over itself.  The nose is as powerful as the appearance; deeply roasted, almost burnt malts and grains; thick, bittersweet chocolate; creamy, dark fudge. Sweetness is heavily present from the malts, and some cocoa beans, burnt coffee/espresso, and slight char reside in the background. An ever-so-slight hop presence can be detected as well, even more so as the beer warms up; ashy, leafy, herbal. I like RIS's to have a deep, bitter offset, and if the nose is any indication - Ten FIDY will fulfill that desire.  Upon taking the first sip, I'm pretty blown away. The body hits my palate as creamy and chewy as they come. I feel like I should be cutting this beer into pieces with a knife, I can't tell if I'm drinking it or eating it. The intense roasted malts hit your tongue right away and come hand-in-hand with a gentle gradient that runs a slow course on your palate from a mellow sweetness to a sharp, yet delicate bitterness. The malts appear as a rich, dark chocolate, creamy, bitter espresso beans, and even a deep, dark fruit sweetness in the form of bruised figs and raisins.  Once the sweetness has taken its turn, the bitterness starts to make its crescendo on your palate - some more of that sharp fruitiness comes back in a subtle, yet effective way, along with a new set of flavors that start to take over. Ashy, leafy, and herbal hops, woodiness, slight nuttiness, and smokey, charred bitter hints sift through the static and leave a lasting impression long into the aftertaste. I haven't taken a sip in 5 minutes and I can still taste Ten FIDY. The 10.5% ABV is nothing to scoff at, and it provides a robust feel and a solidifying warmth all around. Carbonation is fairly low, but strong enough to bring out the best flavors - it works incredibly well, here.  Ten FIDY is simply outstanding. One of the first Russian Imperial Stouts that I truly fell in love with. It's quite a shame that I can't get this regularly in my region, or you can bet my fridge would be stocked with it all the time. If you're a fan of big-ass, robust RISs, do yourself a solid and seek this bad boy out - you won't be disappointed. Plus - it comes in a can. How fucking cool is that?",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

There is a mocha colored head which fades to a thing film and a ring of foam.  S: Dark and roasted aroma. Bitter chocolate and cappuccino.  T: Very chocolatey and bitter. Dark chocolate, roasted coffee but with a slight sweetness similar to a milk stout. Faint fruit, black cherry and fig. Some pine mingles with a notable alcohol flavor to make a bitter and lingering finish.  M: Smooth and creamy with a good amount of alcohol heat. Low carbonation.  O: Alcohol heat is fairly high so that might turn off some people, but I think the thick malt compensates. Very good, dry, chocolatey and roasted.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

(Also found AleSmith and some Weyerbacher barleywines; very good trip overall.)  A - jet black, actually a little darker than most RISs I've seen. Pours very, very little head. Foam is dark brown, hugs the perimeter of the beer all the way down.  S - really complex, lots of anise and a bit of chocolate. I detect a faint trace of something bitter, coffee maybe, but it's tough to put my finger on. Very good anyway.  T - a little less complex than the taste, but still very good. I detect hints of chocolate and coffee, but the bittersweet flavors like raisin really come out in the taste. I'm surprised that the alcohol content is so high.  M - another really great facet of this beer. Almost the perfect amount of viscosity; again, the alcohol is difficult to detect.  O - I wanted to give this beer a 4.25 overall, but couldn't, so I deferred to the slightly lower score. (sorry, Oskar Blues!).

2681,34483,C20Percent,3.98,"**Bottled on 10/11/2011**  A: Pours like a can of oil -- just pours so thick and black with a bubbly brown head on top. Surely, depending on how vigorous you pour the can the more head you get, and I definitely let it fly. Don't expect the head to stay like this throughout. But, this is what I feel a stout should look like.  S: Heavy chocolate, cocoa -- lots of nice roasted maltiness and toasted grains. Nothing bad here -- a bit of booziness, but very solid.  T: Warm, syrupy, roastiness with a little bitter finish. Not the booziness that I smelled. Some definite cocoa in there. Maybe even some caramel flavors. Nice taste.  M: Thick body -- syrupy, oily. Little carbonation, but that works here. Good chewiness, which brings out the chocolate. Nothing wow here, but good.  O: Very solid Imperial Stout -- the look of this is the winner.

2681,34483,hoody711,4.38,"Found in Houston, TX. Only had seen Dale's PA, so it was great to find this and Deviant Dale's. Hopefully it lives up to the hype. I'll try not to be too biased - not my favorite style.  A - Canned 9/17 (40 days ago, about). Poured into a tulip. Inky and thick, motor oil. Dark tan 2 finger head that settles to a thin film but laces beautifully.  S - roasty malts, a little sweet fruit maybe (?), chocolaty, toffee. A little hint of booze at the end of a big whiff.  T - Subdued is the first thing I think of. After mostly tasting nothing, just experiencing the silkiness on your tongue, a nice sweet maltiness blends into dark chocolate and more roastiness. Follows the nose with a little alcohol warmth at the end. I want to say complex, but I don't mean it changes from one taste to another to another etc. It's more the nice fade from a great silky warming mouthfeel to the imperial stoutness, leaving a nice sweet aftertaste if you lick your lips.  M - rich and silky at the start, then warms and coats the palate. Great, if you're into that sort of thing.  O - well, not my favorite beer style, but this is amazing, and definitely lived up to the hype. I love stouts/porters that don't smash you in the face with coffee taste, and this is one of those. The beer is beautiful, the taste is complex and subtle, and the mouthfeel makes you want to light a fire, throw on pajamas, and watch football with snow falling outside.

Smell: Dark fruit aromas emerge from the combination of hops over roasted malt. Lots of chocolate too with a small hint of coffee underneath.  Taste: Really delicious the dark fruit flavors mingle with the heavy chocolate and the result is just superb. Really not getting a ton of coffee but there is a subtle mocha flavor. The alcohol is completely masked.  Mouthfeel: Rich and creamy (very creamy). The hops just keep this brew from becoming cloying; however, as the beer warms this line becomes thinner and thinner as the beer seems to coat the palate a little more.  Overall: An excellent RIS that I have waited way too long to try, on the list of stouts with a dark fruit flavor component this one falls just below Peche Mortel, which I consider pretty strong praise (as it’s also nicely cheaper than Peche).",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Jagen,3.91,"Poured from a can into a snifter. 3rd one I’ve had out of the 4 pack…haven’t reviewed yet A – pours a very pretty looking, thick tan head…3 fingers initially. Slowly fading down. Thick, brown/tan bubbles…leaving an ever-so-slight lacing on the side of the glass. It pours black. Can’t really describe it other than black…”the darkness is coming” indeed! Head fades into an extremely thin layer that just barely covers the top of the beer. S – smells like a nice roasted coffee…the roasted smell almost makes me think of a burning sugar/syrup when cooking. Dark chocolate (slight hint). A hot boozy smell lingers tantalizingly at the end, hinting at the beast you are about to drink! T – very rich flavor. Immediately a heavy roasted malt flavor hits the palette. It has a bitterness I associate with a very strong batch of coffee. Tastes like strong, bitter cooking chocolate. This coffee flavor lingers for awhile. You can just barely taste the hops in the background…a very nice addition. I normally don’t get many hops in the background of a stout. This starts out sweet and gives way to the nice bitterness at the end. This beer is delicious. M – Very low carbonation…when you open the can you almost think it might be flat! Very thick body…smooth. I would love to try this nitro-tapped. O – One of the best things to ever come out of a can. A tad pricey ($15/4pack), but I would say it is worth it. If I had more money, I would stock up on this and see if it ages well in the can. The alcohol is surprisingly well hidden. I normally am not a fan of stouts but this is helping bring me around.

Pours black with a nice dark brown head. A roasty aroma with some nice chocolate and coffee. Taste follows through. Taste thick and rich, roastiness that travels into some burnt and bitter territory (which I love), some nice thick chocolate, and some coffee. As it warms the chocolate becomes stronger and more upfront than the coffee and a little something else shows itself in the middle there, perhaps molasses? A little alcohol shows itself but much tamer from what I have come to expect from fresher bottles. A nice full, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a great beer new or old.

2681,34483,deadonhisfeet,4.38,"Really excited to try this one. Oskar Blues just started distributing to Northern Kentucky. Poured from a can into a Lost Abbey Teku. It pours out a luscious, black liquid with a majestic rocky brown head that has some nice retention. On the nose I get some nice roasted notes, coffee, and chocolate.  The beer has a full body, a creamy, velvety mouthfeel, and a big, sweet malty flavor profile. Flavors of sweet milk chocolate hit the front of the palate. As the flavors develop, a little bitterness kicks in and you get complementary flavors of cafe latte. Right on the back of the palate, there is definitely a pleasant, warming hit of alcohol. The beer is not boozy, but it is very noticeable. It complements the bittersweet flavors perfectly and makes it very liqueur-like. As the beer warms, the sweetness recedes and the bitter and roasty notes start to come forward more.  Just when you think you know what to expect from this style, a beer like this one comes across your path and surprises you. I did not anticipate how sweet this beer was, but combined with the roastiness of the style, it works and doesn't seem cloying or syrupy. While some RISs display lots of burnt fruit flavors, this one is all about coffee and chocolate. It's almost like drinking AleSmith's Speedway Stout. It's not really roasty enough to be my favorite RIS, but it's awfully high up on my list.

The alcohol, though not extreme for an imperial stout is essentially invisible I don't taste it at all.

Will definitely be getting again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,tastybeer,4.5,"Canned on 10-5-2011...  A: Super black with an unusually dark brown head. Head is large right at the pour and fades to a dense dark brown layer within five minutes. Eventually there is nothing left but a solemn jet black pond. This beer looks intimidatingly heavy.  S: Big soft piles of caramel-dark cocoa syrup, grain, fig, tobacco, and various lingering purple and red fruits. Big and complex aromas smoothed together into a calm, harmonious arrangement.  T: Heavy concoction of sugary berries drizzled in syrupy chocolate liquor. Just the right amount of sweetness vs. bitterness. This beer brings layers of awesomeness to your mouth.  M: Thick with a lightness. Soft texture and lightly syrupy. Carbonation is perfect. Body is heavy as is should be. Metaphorically engine oil is appropriate.  O: This beer is pretty fantastic across the board.

2681,34483,Auracom,3.99,"Oskar Blues has finally arrived in Illinois! Been wanting to try this for a looong time. 6 oz. split into a Hunahpu's snifter on October 11th, 2012.  A - As close to a Cigar City stout appearance I've seen. Prefer a 4.75 here. Hugely thick, black, and oily. Thin mocha head with just traces left. Marginal lacing.  S - Surprisingly more dark fruit that I'd have guessed. Raisins, sweet syrup/molasses. Light spices. Definite roast but not massive.  T - Front end shows a heavy espresso bitterness. Mid palate turns to a huge roasted character, with almonds and the like. Back end is more roast, dark chocolate, and that sweet winter, pitted character that I also detected in the aroma.  M - Medium-heavy body. Moderate carbonation, good dry finish.  D - No alcohol harshness anywhere in this one. The fruit elements clearly is what I'll remember about this one. It's akin to Founder RIS and Dark Horse Plead the 5th, only with more sweetness and less roast that I imagined it would have. Good thing I want to revisit, since I bought a 4 pack. ;)",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,blackcompg,4,"Poured from their 12oz can, let the can sit out for 30-40 minutes prior to opening...  Appearance - Pours a finger of burnt brown head that recedes to a cap in a minute, the body is a deep dark black, light doesn't pass through the center, but the edges of the glass are a gorgeous mahogany garnet color.  Smell - Roasted malts, french roast coffee, dark ripe fruits, molasses, smells very rich and complex, time to pour...  Taste - Roasted pumpernickel bread, dark black coffee, nearly unsweetened black chocolate, roasted malts, good amount of char, unsweetened licorice, a touch of roasted rye, there are slight dark fruit at the very center of slight plum and cherry, the finish is dry toasted breadcrusts of pumpernickel and a good bit of char.  Mouthfeel - Just above medium, nearly mouthcoating, very silky and smooth, almost creamy, carb is on the lower side but provides some interesting brite edges along the back of the tongue. A very nice stout to sip and enjoy.  Overall - I expected great things from this beer, and it's definitely a nice RIS, especially if you like the focus to be on more of the roasty and char flavors. It's a very good RIS, but not great in my opinion. Great flavors, but not the balance I'm looking for, this one is definitely roast/char forward - which is great if that's what you like. Complex yes, balanced, not so much. For $15 dollars a 4-pak, you could do better.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A- Pours thick and pitch black with a finger's worth of a khaki colored head. The head sticks around along the sides of the glass for awhile.  S- Lots of chocolate in the smell. Some coffee hints are in there for me as well.  T- Up front I get chocolately malts, followed by coffee and espresso characters. The chocolate is most prominent for me. There is also some good hop bittering going on as well. Real complex tasting beer.  M- Thick, chewy, yet an easy drinker. The alcohol is well hidden. Nice balance of hops and malts for an RIS.  Great beer, happy I finally got to try some.

An opaque deep fudge brown topped by a two-finger leather head. Fair retention and great lacing.  S - Massive sweet chocolate and malts. This is like smelling a fudge milkshake, only better because its beer.  T - Same as the nose: huge taste. Big chocolate notes intertwined with some mild hop bitterness that finds a delicate balance. Some light hints of coffee on the rear that rounds out the RIS style. Some vanilla even makes a cameo appearance.  M - Perhaps the fullest beer I have ever had. Somehow velvety smooth and the ABV adds just the amount of warmth. Creamy and outright delicious.  O - This beer is the s**t. I have nothing else to say.

2681,34483,brureview,4.77,"First time trying this beer. Fortunately, I bought a few cans.  Served in a chalice. What a great beer!  The beer poured a very dark chocolate- dark coffee color. Less than a 1/2 finger head.  Aroma: toffee- caramel aroma- candy smell.  Mouth feel: light carbonation.  Finish: Chocolate Liqueur.  Bottling date: 10/31/11  A class act! This beer was difficult to find. Only one store in the area was stocking it. Different than North Coast Old Rasputin- smoother, more balanced, and rich in liqueur- candy aroma and taste. Buy it!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

It is as though the discomfort of Old Rasputin is replace with sheer joy while losing none of the character. Absolutely brilliant. The can ensures freshness. The can is a cool black and silver mural. I find myself going back to this when I want one, good, beer. This always does the trick.

2681,34483,BrownAleMale,3.24,12oz can poured into a Gulden Draak tulip glass.  Appearance- Black as motor oil with a 2 finger brown head that lasts quite a while. Nice lacing and alcohol legs. Best LOOKING beer I've ever seen.  Smell- I get mostly the acidity and piney hops with a slight coffee note.  Taste- Soy sauce is there can't deny it. Also lots of metallic bitterness. There are some nice chocolate and coffee notes but they are overwhelmed by the odd soy sauce and metallic taste.  Mouthfeel- Once again they hit this right on the head. As silky smooth as smooth gets.  Overall- The off flavors really deture from the beautiful look and mouthfeel of this beer.

S – Roasted malts, chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. It smells like Ten Fidy. I don't know how else to describe it.  T – Similar to nose. Chocolate is more pronounced. Some bitterness. A little booze as it warms, but that is to be expected for a beer of this size.  M – Full bodied with moderate carbonation.  O – For me, this is one of those style defining beers.

A nice medium-dark brown head develops which dissipates into a scattered geography of islands and streams. Smells like roasting marshmallows on a distant campfire with a caramel undertone. Lots of chocolatey, smokey, coffee, creamy notes that dive so deep into your soul.  Such an epic beer. Stouts are not my typical fare but this is supreme; Black velvet supreme. The fact it is aged 2 years makes it all the more delicious.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Maxwell,4.35,"The beer pours like a black-coffee ooze. Thick and without bubbles till you get to the top of the glass and there is develops some serious tan head that reminds me of maple syrup and only appears as a skim and fades away quick. I can’t see within the beer to report on haziness, etc… but I can tell you that there are little bubbles bouncing to the tops of the beer to refill the ring of lacing. When the beer is given a swirl it leaves long hill-like patterns of alcoholic legs along the sides. The beer smells fat with charred wood, charcoals, and a heady dark chocolate hiding behind everything. The booze also peak through slightly with a spicy slight burn at the end of the whiff. The smell in many ways reminds me of Paradox Isle of Arran by Brew Dog. The beer tastes fat and oozing with roasted coffee and sweet charred wood. The aftertaste resonates with dark chocolate, some slight charred wood and an oh-so-slight burn to remind you of this beer’s ABV. From the can the beer tastes mildly sweeter with a mellowing of the charred wood and more of a sweet boozy taste. This beer seems to taste better in the glass overall than in the can for me. The mouthfeel of this beer is heavenly. As I said before it is fat and oozing on the tongue. It is beyond-velvet smooth as it oozes through your mouth and it runs down the throat like molasses. This beer leaves the mouth high and dry and begging for more with only faint wisps saliva on the tongue trying vainly to put out the smoky chocolate fire in your mouth. Overall this beer lives up to its reputation, it was a delectable sipper that holds up to the Founder’s Breakfast Stout that I had last week. This beer in many ways reminds me of Paradox Isle of Arran beer without the bourbon flavor linger. This is a fantastic Russian imperial stout and is well worth a drink.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aroma is of roasted malts licorise coffee and dark bittersweet chocolate. Taste is quite good and exceedingly roasty. Flavors of coffee or espresso are in there too plus hints of vinilla suggesting time in a barrel. Warming alcohol at finish. Drinks very smooth and feels heavy on the palette.

2681,34483,mjtiernan,4.13,"12oz can poured into a Teku stemmed snifter. Canned on 11/14/11.  A: Little carb..poured quiet and lifeless. A desperate attempt at forming a head was met with failure. There’s a four pixel (salute to the web nerds) ring around the edge of the glass. Black as a country night and the oily texture and lack of carbonation only emphasizes it.  S: Sweet smelling, syrupy and burnt. Dominant roasted malt. A touch of either dark fruit or lactic sourness...can’t say for sure, but most likely the dark fruit. A vigorous swirl opens up some appealing coffee notes. If I hadn’t had this beer before I’d be worried about now. Not a fan of sweet stouts.  T: So much more complex and appealing than the aroma. No lactic sourness to be found and virtually no syrupy sweetness. Wonderful levels of roasted malt assaulting your taste buds. Nice smokiness with a bit of wood in the finish.  M: The definition of full bodied. It’s oily, yet finishes dry...which is impressive. Carb is marginally present, but I don’t mind much. The 10.5% alcohol is impressively hidden on the palate, but you start to feel it for sure.  O: I associate this beer with motor oil for a few reasons: 1) it comes in a can 2) it’s black as night with little carb and 3) it’s THICK. But it is a perfect example of how to do aggressive levels of roasted malt that really work. Awesome tasting beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Finish – Toffee, some charcoal and hints of smoke.  Mouthfeel Full bodied, silky, smooth, sticky and borderline chewy.  Overall I’m not particularly gung-ho about this Imperial Stout, but some people seem to love it. The mouthfeel is impressive and it’s gained an almost legendary status for its thickness. The year and a half aging has really mellowed this out and brought out a lot of dark fruits in the flavor profile.

2681,34483,chrisrose30,5,"This was poured on tap at TAPS in Petaluma, CA. Dark tan head with thick lacing that stuck on the glass. My first impression of this beer upon smelling it was molasses, coffee, chocolate, and everything black with a rich overall smell and subdued alcohol. The thing I really liked upon tasting this beer was the complexity - very chocolatey and thick, charcoal, molasses - and it subdued the alcohol well.

No trace of alcohol in the taste and this is thick chewy and silky at the same time. Coats my mouth in goodness. As this warms I get a bit of roast. Drinking this way too fast for what it is but it drinks more like a nice 5% porter than the 10.5 monster this is. Wow.

2681,34483,TempeBeerMan,4.85,"Poured from a can into a nonic pint.  A - Pours like motor oil (a perception possibly aided because it comes from a can), so black it seems to absorb light. Did I mention that it's really black?? Aggressive pour yields only a one-finger head of dark brown bubbles.  S - Everything here smells roasty and burnt. Getting burnt grains, burnt molasses, burnt raisin, burnt coffee. Smells inviting.  T - Wow. Surprisingly smooth for the flavor richness and depth. Esters of mocha, devil's food cake, espresso bean, molassess, plum, black cherry, and egg cream. If you struggle, you can detect some herbal and fruity hops in the finish. Extremely well balanced between sweet and bitter. 10.5% abv impossible to detect. Out of this world.  M - Medium to full bodied, with low carbonation. Smooth and creamy. Marvelous.  O - An amazing stout, and probably the best I have ever had. I have been reading about this for a while, and NOW I see what all the hype is about. Nearly perfect.

Picks up a little more carbonation when swirled. So silky smooth guessing it has a good amount of flaked oats to make it creamy. I really get not hint of alcohol in it whatsoever. Is it really 10.5%?  Ten Fidy has been on my bucket list for awhile and finally made a trip to Ft Collins and brought it back along with quite a haul of others we can't get here in S. Dakota.

They're have a series of rare barrel age brews that they receive with collaboration and due to the fact that Brick Store is a world renowned pub.  A 2010 Barrel aged Ten Fidy from tap to Tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours a thick, pitch black body with a great creamy, brownish head. Beautiful Stout.  Smell: Dark malty smell with espresso, chocolate throughout. The ABV is masked well and the aging makes the smokiness very subtle.  Taste: Oh so smooth, the flavors have mixed and become less pungent with age which make it so drinkable for a RIS. I can't stress how smooth this is. 2 years has done good to this beer.

This is a menacing look. Poured into two glasses and each had unique head patterns after a few minutes.  S: Chocolaty burnt and roasty malts. Some darker fruits. As it warms up it gets some bourbon overtones, very nice.  T: Starts with a fairly even malt, intensifying on the into a boozy bourbonesque finish. Some toffee or other sweetness. I like how the hops have mellowed.  M: Thick and creamy really feels like a stout. Certainly some booze at the end but expected. Very warming.  Overall a serious stout in a can.

The aroma says beautiful licorice malt, so deep it nearly suggests a minty grass hop with a slight bubblegum sweetness. Very nice. The flavor just brings more of the same with juniper malt licorice, smooth as silk and nearly as thick as motor oil. Goes down easy and feels like such a velvetty masterpiece you have to just savor it’s malty splendor. Not much more to say.

Tastes like a big Russian imperial stout. Lots of roast and coffee. A mix of Carmel, toffee and Carmel sweep in mid palate. A good dose of earthy hops and roasty bitterness on the finish.  Medium full bodied, low carbonation. Very oily and coating.  Overall this is very good. I'd love to try a barrel aged version of this if it exists. Full flavored, complex and very drinkable.

Pours really black with a nice brown head that is huge, considering no pssst sound when I popped the can. It looks weird poring something that looks like this out of a can.  Smell is a bit of a let down. Huge soy sauce aroma is overpowering. I do get a little roasted malt and coffee. I have smelled much better though...  I still get a big soy sauce blast from the taste, but it's way less muted than the smell. Good roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate round it out.  Mouthfell is viscous and thick. I like it!!

Pours black (duh), with a finger of dark brown head with a purplish tinge to it. Light retention. Nose has chocolate, brown sugar sweetness, coconut and syrupy dark fruits. A bit of almond liqeur and caramel also - really complex stuff. Taste has chocolate, dark sugary fruits, a bit of vanilla, syrup ans some nuttiness. Large roastiness too. A little less complex than the nose suggested but still fantastic. Some alcohol and warmth carries into the finish. Full feel, extremely smooth.

Nice 1/8th inch head, a beautiful beer.  This is a very flavorful beer. Hints of chocolate, coffee, and maybe roasted nuts...quickly turns bitter, but then suprises you with a very warm finish, a few seconds after it goes down. A really nice experience.  Mouthfeel: Not the best body, too much going on. Very flavorful, not a beer you would throw more than 2 down.  Overall, a great beer.

Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are aromas of dark roasted barley malts, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. It's mildy sweet smelling as well. The taste follows the nose. There are dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, coffee, and alcohol featured prominently in the flavors. The hops are also present on the back end to balance some of the malty sweetness. The aftertaste is mildly of coffee and chocolate. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation.

2681,34483,EnemyWithin,4.13,"Appearance 4.5 Dark opaque black beer with one inch brown head. Mild to moderate lacing. Head dissipates into thin covering. Good looking beer.  Smell 4 Robust roasted malt with dark and milk chocolate and faint notes of dark fruit and coffee. Overall good combination of roasty-ness and sweetness. Note of chocolate malt.  Taste 4 Initially, a prominent dark/semi-sweet chocolate flavour with a touch of bitterness and faint notes of coffee. Also a slight sweetness from the malt. Midway through sweet chocolate notes come out and a nice robust roasty-ness that becomes present. Finishes with a slow fading roasty-ness and a lingering bitterness from the hops. Also with a slight coffee aftertaste. Reasonable contrast between the sweetness of the malt with the bitter aspect of the coffee flavour/hops.  Mouthfeel 4 Mild to moderate thickness with mild to moderate carbonation that is initially a little brisk, but fades to a nice creaminess. Again, nice contrast between the astringent and sweet aspects of the beer. The bitterness prevents this beer from being overly sweet.  Overall 4.5 Great beer with enjoyable robust flavors that you come to expect from a stout. Good use of malt for the sweet roasty elements, without being overly sweet by any means. There is an element of bitterness to prevent the palate from becoming too fatigued. Incredibly smooth and does not seem anywhere near the 10.5% alcohol content. There’s been a lot of hype around this beer, and for the most part it lives up to it. Of the many stouts I’ve had, it’s definitely near the top and would be something I’d seek out again. The can provides interesting format. Reminds me of founders breakfast stout with more roasty/sweetness.

Some cola-colored bubbles, but no head. A glass of tar.  Taste: Vanilla at first, followed by mounds of sugar and charcoal bitterness that prevent sweetness from being too much of a factor. The alcohol is present with a raisin-like quality. The feel is velvet smooth and decadent. It finishes a little hot and burnt/bitter.  Overall: Goddamn what a beer.

I'm already impressed...  Pours a deep dark motor oil inky black... dark as the devil's dick with several fingers of medium mocha head. Solid lacing.  Super roasty and woody with the addition of some sweet figs and plum. Plenty of brown sugar and well-incorporated alcohol notes. Some hot licorice begins to surface with a bit of warmth.  The taste is nearly unsurpassed - toasted wood, mild coffee, fig, vanilla bean, more brown sugar, soft booze, it pretty much incorporates a piece of every memorable impy stout I've had.

2681,34483,kagent777,4.52,"I have traded and purchased these cans several times, but this particular can was a trade with Exiled. The can is dated 11-29-10, so about 18 months old. I poured this one into a CCB snifter.  Appearance: This one is really black. Pours very thickly and looks delicious, surprising to see this from a can, when some may be used to the looks of PBR. I did not expect much carbonation, but this one has no head at all, only a few whisps of tiny bubbles.  Smell: Char, roastiness, some dried fruit maybe raisins and prunes. One gets the general sense of chocolate and coffee, but not those flavors exactly.  Taste: This is a really well done beer. The taste has all of the flavors that you sense in the nose. The overall flavor is slight acrid and a little bitter, but there is also some sweetness going on, but not so much that it becomes cloying. I would love to compare Marshall Zhukov with this beer.  Mouthfeel: A very weighty beer, but you can tell that from sight and the way it pours. Needless to say this one is very flavorful and the flavors coat the mouth very well.  Overall: This is an expensive beer, but one that I suspect is expensive to make. I will gladly try this beer again as it did not disappoint. Maybe a little hard to recommend to new beer drinkers. Very solid!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,kell50,4.52,"I have had this one many times both in can and on draft, including the Barrel Aged version. This particular review is for the 12 oz. can of Ten FIDY I consumed on February 18, 2012.  I poured this baby into my oversized Ommegang goblet.  A- Pouring this stuff is like pouring motor oil. It’s super jet black in color and without too many bubbles. I honestly don't think it could be any darker. A small brownish head dissipates pretty fast.  S- Awesome nose. Nice roasted coffee, chocolate malts, a touch of booze, toffee/caramel, and perhaps some dark fruit notes too.  T- Boom! I love this stuff. Creamy chocolate dark coffee first hits the tongue then followed by chewy malts, a hint of roasted coffee beans, a little bit of caramel sweetness. It’s super viscous and sweet but not cloying. Light sweet aftertaste that sticks in my mouth.  M- Definitely one of the heavier and thicker beers I've had. As mentioned there isn't much carbonation. Amazingly, for a beer clocking in at 10.5% abv you really can’t taste much alcohol at all. Dangerous!  O- This is the benchmark of what a Russian Imperial Stout is and should be. It's truly a fantastic beer. It has a great complexity and goes down shockingly smooth.

T: Tastes about how it smells - and not as much flavor as I'd expect from such a heavy, dark RIS. Still good, though. Not necessairly a sipper - goes down pretty smoothly. Leaves a lingering burnt taste.  M: About what you'd expect from the pour, pretty heavy. A little carbonation kicks in to spruce things up.  O: Obviously not a Night Stalker - but, hey, I wasn't really expecting much.

2681,34483,JohnnyHopps,4.26,"The RIS was poured from the can into a pint glass. The color and the thickness of the stout reminded me that it is almost time to change my oil. It was as dark as used motor oil and had the same relative thickness. A slight mocha colored head formed at the top of the drink. Aromatic impressions included dark chocolate and burned malts, though the scents were light. The initial taste was a spicy dark chocolate with hints of dark fruits and the burn of tobacco. The smooth maltiness coats the tongue nicely. Tart flavors really hit the sides of the tongue nicely. These flavors are allowed to linger with the lack of strong carbonation. The aftertaste is moderately warming, lingering several minutes in the throat before fading. The dark chocolate continues in the aftertaste with hints of prune and a certain degree of chalkiness. This is a very well structured RIS that is fairly accessible.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The small, deep tan head faded quickly.  The smell was steely. Faint soy sauce. Really the weakest aspect of this beer.  The taste was fantastic. Chocolate, fruit, and creamy coffee. Brownies! Sweet on the lips but still not cloying. The roasted barley bitterness helps counter the sweetness. Well hidden alcohol. One of my new favorites!  The mouthfeel was perfect. Rich and creamy with enough carbonation to scrub off the richness. Well done.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Poured under light the stream has a deep chestnut hue but it ends in a pool of ink black with a thick half finger of dark mocha head. It's a beautiful beer that leaves ocassional dark tan islands of lace on the glass.   A rich, sweet nose with vanilla, chocolate, coffee, cherry and a bit of woodsy smoke.   Waves of flavor in this one! The initial booze blanket never fully disappears but fades to reveal layers of dark chocolate, leather, burnt coffee, figs/dates, vanilla, wood and pepper. So many flavors, all with an alcohol kick. It's quite nice.   Thick, heavy body with just enough ocassional pops to remind you that it's carbonated. Remains syrupy on the tongue for a long bittersweet booze soaked finish.   An outstanding imperial stout. I'd forgotten how enjoyable it is. A tad on the pricey side but sure a pleasure to drink.

Black.  Smell: Full of deep roasted malts. Smells sweeter than I expected. Hints of chocolate and coffee sneak through, but it’s roasty sweetness. High ABV booze come through as well. Hints of leather and fresh tobacco leaf, leaning heavy on the tobacco part of this. Smells like a freshly packed pipe dipped in roasted chocolate.  Taste: Absolutely loaded with roasted flavors. A metric shit ton of roasted malts. Booze hits the back in a serious burning way. Something tinny rings through the back. It’s not as sweet as the nose made me think it was going to be. Syrupy sweetness drags out some char and fresh tobacco. Lingering ashy smokiness. Very sweet.  Mouthfeel: Body is thick, but never hits on syrupy. Carbonation is almost non-existent. Heavy.

Pitch black motor oil with a colossal cacao colored head. Lacing is so sticky that anywhere the beer touches it leaves a thick foam in its wake.  S: I'm so confused by this. It smells like burnt milky chocolate coffee with a hint of toffee. I smell a little bit of something I can only describe as sweet charcoal. Very unique, very enticing.  T: Now THIS is a big stout. Taste follows the nose. Creamy chocolatey goodness with sweet toffee and coffee flavors. Can't describe all the flavors going on here...they're so complex.  M: Low carbonation is greatly welcomed. Such a thick, thick mouthfeel. The taste lingers way long after the sip is swallowed. I've never given a beer a 5 in any category before, but the mouthfeel on this one deserves it. A+ on that superb lingering aftertaste.  O: This is an exceptional stout. My only problem with it is the price and the fact that I couldn't drink anything after having this because it was so heavy. Not a downfall really, but I drank it after a few IPAs so it was a little tough to finish. Not sure if it's worth the price tag, but it's at least worth it if you can get a single can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Avoiding the syrupy dried fruits that some other RIS examples feature, this is a bold and heavy beer that I would pick up again.  Pours a tall (4cm) head of small bubles that turn frothy on top. Excellent head retention with ample lacing, head eventually fading to a ring around the glass. Body is dark brown to black and opaque. Can faintly see carbonation rising on top sides of glass.  Aroma is strongly of roasted malt, ground coffee beans, and mild milk chocolate. Sharp molasses0like sugars appear as beer warms. Not really any detectable ethanol.  Taste features strong roasted malt component on opening, alongside ground coffee beans, molasses (blackstrap), and milk chocolate. Chocolate lingers in aftertaste with blackstrap molasses flavors and a bit of ethanol. Ethanol is only slightly detectable at back of palate. Quite good.  Beer is medium-heavy to heavy bodied, with detectable carbonation that has very ""small"" bubbles, resulting in a very fine, gentle tingling across the palate.

2681,34483,jondeelee,4.5,"Ten FIDY pours jet-black with a rich brown loam head, and opens with a powerful cream-and-ash note that is instantly enticing. The nose is heavy on coffee, anise, heavy whipping cream, and the kind of rich brown bread that can feed a family of four for a whole week on a single loaf. Thick layers of fig, plum, and nectarine fruit esters add complexity, joined by molasses and brown sugar. Hops add grapefruit rind and pine notes, and it says much of the malts that the hops’ 98 IBUs only end up as background support. The overall effect is one of delicious intoxication, smelling like the best cup of coffee imaginable, accompanied by a world-class cigar and a bowlful of fresh-picked fruits and berries topped by fresh whipped cream.  On the tongue, the beer begins with a blast of tobacco, ash, black coffee, espresso, and anise. After this initial half-second black hole of an onslaught, the tastebuds recover enough to note the presence of a lovely layer of sugars, with fig, prune, plum, and raisin fruit esters joined by molasses, brown sugar, and dark caramels. There’s also a strong whiskey and cognac quality to the beer, despite the fact that this particular can hasn’t been barrel aged, adding some carbon, as well as a nice alcoholic bite. Hops add a nice supporting grapefruit rind and pine layer, and this lasts well into the aftertaste, joined there by a somehow-even-stronger tobacco, coffee, and black malt presence, with just enough sugars remaining to make it deliciously palatable, and the entire aftertaste lingering for a very, very long time. Mouthfeel is a syrupy medium-heavy, and carbonation is medium.  Overall, this is truly excellent fare; beer so good that it’s hard to believe it comes out of a can (much, to Oskar Blues’ credit, like all of their offerings). It’s difficult to imagine much more flavor being cranked out of a mash tun, much less being squeezed into a tiny can.

My only complaint is the salty background. Maybe a canning thing? Not too sure, but it is solid.  M - Absolute best in class. Smooth. Full bodied. Coats the mouth and makes this brew an absolute privilege to caress the tongue. Can't say enough about the mouthfeel of this stout.  O - Such a great RIS.

Bitterness lingers for a little bit in the back of the throat, but it’s mostly the sweetness that lingers on the tongue and palate. A little bit of a warming sensation from the alcohol. In my mind, this is how a stout should feel.  O - This is one of the best imperial stouts that I’ve ever had. It looks, smells, and tastes great, and it has the best mouthfeel by FAR of any stout I’ve tried. Plus, for 10.5% ABV, it hides the alcohol extremely well. This is an excellent beer. And it’s in a can!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,stephenjmoore,4.59,"A- Black with a hint of amber during the pour. A few tan bubbles on top that leave a light ring around the glass.  S- Roasted malts and sweet dried fruit (figs?). A hint of chocolate and coffee mixed in as well. A lot going on.  T- Roasted malts throughout the whole taste, some dried fruit sweetness, with the chocolate coming through a little more than the smell indicates.  M- A thick sipper. Very moderately carbonated, which is good.  O- Ten Fidy has a different flavor profile than almost any other imperial stout. The only beer it slightly reminds me of is World Wide Stout. The complexity and balance of the flavors is great.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Darkmagus82,4.35,"Poured from can into snifter  Appearance – Pours a pitch black color with a deep brown head. The brew was think and hearty even from the look. The brown head faded slowly over time to give some nice lacing.  Smell – Lots of great aromas here. The aroma is heavy of dark chocolate and dark malt. Sweet aromas of caramel, toffee and raisin are present as well. Furthermore there is a hearty presence of bourbon giving it a very warming boozy smell.  Taste – The taste follows the nose very well with tons going on. Big bold chocolate and roasted malt create a strong base up front. Up front there is also a good deal of sweet caramel and toffee and hints of creamy sweetness which when mixed with the cocoa/chocolate create a milk chocolate taste (or maybe more aptly considered milkshake taste due to its thick body). As the taste advances some of the caramel and toffee flavors give way to dark fruit flavors of raisin and some hints of molasses. As was detected in the nose, at the end, a bourbon flavor really starts to develop. This mixes with the sweeter chocolate and malt as well as a nice smoky flavor leaving a pleasing aftertaste in the mouth and bringing the taste to its end.  Mouthfeel – Creamy and thick just as the look forebode. It coats the moth like a jacket, clinging to the tongue and penetrating every taste bud with its huge flavors. It carbonation, being on the lighter side only accentuates the creaminess and mouth coating feel, overall giving a great mouthfeel.  Overall – The only imperial stout I ever had delivered in a can and it was fantastic!!! A huge and wonderfully delicious stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Bobheed,4.58,"A: Pours super, super dark black. One of the darkest beers I've seen, with a half finger brown head that dissipates very quickly.  S: A lot of dark chocolate, molasses, and sort of a sugar coated plum scent. Really get tons of roastiness too.  T: Get the dark fruits first and foremost. It sort of, then, transitions into coffee, just tons of coffee, leaving you with a bit of caramel chocolatiness at the end.  M: medium to light carbonation and monstrously thick. Exactly what you expect the mouthfeel to be once you see the beer. Not tons of alcohol either, which is nice, considering it's 10.5%  Overall this is an excellent stout. A great year-round offering and one of the best if not the best value for an imperial stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,sleuthdog,4.47,"Can poured into tulip glass Canned on 10/21/11  A: Holy hell this thing is black! It is as black as the black on the can it was poured from. No head formation on an aggressive pour and no lacing to be seen. There is a very small mocha colored ring around the edge of the glass but even with a swirl I cannot make any head formation. Now on to the viscosity. This is probably one of the thickest pouring beers I have had to date and is on par with a slightly thinner motor oil. No carbonation evident but I don't know how I'd see through the black hole of this beer.  S: Bourbon and more bourbon. I actually smelled this immediately upon popping the can! Dark chocolate and caramel with some coffeet and toffee notes. I pick up on some raisin scent. I must say the alcohol is evident on the nose but not ""hot"".  T: Dark chocolate and bourbon on the initial sip. Big time roasted malt and a unique smokiness come to mind next. At the tail end I pick up on the sweetness and maybe a little vanilla. I'm surprised at the lack of alcohol in the taste as compared to the smell.  M: Velvety smooth and creamy mouthfeel. This completely covers the inside of my mouth and tongue with a viscous feeling that is pleasant. The chewiness on this is almost hard to explain and as I swallow I feel like the beer is still left in my mouth. The wonderful taste is left behind lingering for my enjoyment!  O: I have to say I expected a good RIS but my expectations have been surpassed. This is a great tasting beer and one that I wished was distributed to my area. The price point on this is high, but if I had access to it on a regular basis it would be one I would have to indulge in every once in a while.  On a side note-now understand my wife is NOT into beer, especially ""big"" beer. Mid review I had to stop to help her with something and she didn't know I was drinking a beer in the basement and I just walked past her and she said ""oh your breath smells, are you drinking a beer""? Now I just walked past her and she picked up on this beer and at that point I had only had about 4 sips! I believe this is a testament to the bigness of this beer and one that I love!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BigCheese,4.14,"Can, 6 months old. Served barely below room temperature.  A: While pouring I noticed its as syrupy/viscous as any beer I've ever poured. Dark as night. almost no head. No lacing.  S: Bourbon, honey, dark roasted malts, unsweet dark coco nibs (ultra dark), caramel and rasins too, maybe a hint of bitter citrus, not sure. Good amount of booze in scent.  T: Dark coco, ultra rich, very sweet, ovaltine hiding behind dark bitter chocolate. Hints or irish cream. Smoky flavors too, very ""roasted malts"", then it takes a turn for a spicey/sweet with a kick of bitterness. Kinda surprising. Finishes with a honey, toffee, caramel, oak, smooth maltiness. Hints of dark fruits in finish too. Coffee notes seem absent. Lots of roasted malts but only light roast coffee, interesting. booze burn very slight, only towards end of glass.  M: Very little carbonation, super thick/heavy. Body of half/half. ABV insanely well hidden in taste, minimal ""burn"". Seems sessionable relative to style. Lot of residual sugars tho, like any RIS.  O: I always seem to have odd carbonation/head/lacing with cans, might be me. Like any good RIS its complex, but this one is incredibly smooth. More sessionable than others in its category. Still probably overpriced, fresh I would expect bigger hop flavors/robustness, maybe not as smooth though.

Everything was right there where it should be except for a raw, unapologetic wood-grain alcohol aftertaste, which took away some of the fun of drinking the beer.It is a beauty to look at and incredibly smooth in the mouth.

Raisins, plums. Strangely, no alcohol.  T/M: Slight lactic note. Rich, thick mouthfeel. Slight bitterness in the finish. A bit sweet up front, with chocolate notes. I don't get much dark fruit in the taste, though there is a strong roasted/charred character. Would almost be good paired with barbecue. Very little carbonation.  Overall: Holy shit!

2681,34483,TheDinger,4.57,"Picked this up at GBX on the growler station. Serious stuff here. The pour was just what you would think. Dark and thick, it look more like 10w 30 than a beer. Motor oil dark with a nice 2 finger mocca head. Good spotting and lacing throughout. Looked great in the new snifter. Smell is a chocolate bomb with some coffee notes. Very inviting on the nose and couldn't stop enjoying the aroma. Taste follows the nose with initial chocolate followed by some coffee and sweet dark fruits. Thought it would taste more bitter chocolate or over the top, but it was a nice blend and a true RIS. Feel is creramy/silk with adequate carbonation and full bodied. Overall- A great RIS with just the right amount of chocolate/coffee/figs/fruits/malts and hops. It hides the 10.5% ABV well, but it's a sipper for a chilly evening. Not over the top which is a nice touch. Top notch-",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A light beige head appears at the start but fades quickly to almost nothing. Low carbonation is evident. Light lacing.  Lots going on here. Dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted grains make up most of the aroma. Also present is burnt brown sugar, dark fruits, alcohol, earthy hops, and a tad of vanilla.  Similar to the aroma. Right up front are the earthy hops and roasted grains. This beer smooths out and everything blends together well. Rich milk chocolate, iced coffee, brown sugar, and vanilla are all there. Finishes with warming alcohol and sweetness.  Full body, low carbonation. Something you want to sip. Alcohol is there, not overbearingly so.  A great RIS overall. This beer has aged well thus far.

Smells of roasted barley, alcohol, coffee and hints of chocolate, Fuggle-like earthy hop character with some peppery notes.  Taste is up front earthy, herbal hop with a small grapefruit/cherry follow up. Roast and alcohol follow, which goes into a a coffee like astringent roastiness and ends on a sweet, slightly bitter finish. The finish lingers for some time and has notes or chocolate and sweetness.  Creamy, thick, with low carbonation, almost perfect if not for the almost too present alcohol. A bit hot.

Hints of brown sugar and coffee, almost a mocha undertone. Flavor was sweet and creamy. Very well balanced, not at all acidic. Seemed like a slightly burnt milk stout. A little thin in the mouth, didn't cling at all like I would have expected it to. Not terribly so. Overall a damn good stout, and damn good stout in a can.

A - Pours a viscous black with a small half finger head. The tan foam dies quickly but it shows some lacing. I have never seen a beer leave the can looking this dark or thick. The thin sparse film that remains on top is impressive looking. It looks like the iridescent shine on the surface of a motor oil puddle (minus the color) and can be swirled with a soft blow.  S - Very roasty malts with accents of bitter chocolate, coffee beans, some brown sugar sweetness, and a touch of booze. Smell is good and balanced, but not very strong like I like.  T - Much Sweeter than I expected. Some serious dark fruits (plum, cherry, fig) on the start give way to the roasty notes from the nose. Coffee and vanilla on the finish. Alcohol is well hidden. Smooth flavors with nothing out of place, but a bit sweet.  M - Very thick and chewy. The carbonation is light, which works well with the dark flavors. Very smooth with a creamy moist finish that coats the tongue. Top notch.  O - I really enjoyed this beer. The flavors are very complex and the mouthfeel is one of the best I have come across.

I really like that they were one of the pioneers of canned craft beer. It is really easy to point to their cans as an example of brewing done right. Just don't drink it right out of the can.  The look of Ten Fidy is perfect. It as dark as midnight with two finger tan head. The head dissipates down to scum with a very nice halo. That halo leaves some good lacing on the glass.  Off the top you get a bunch of malt, roast, and some coffee presence. The flavor is a very strong version of the smell. It is well balanced, and you even get some hoppiness in the background.

When i popped the tab, I thought the beer might be flat, as there was no release of pressure. Upon pouring it into a pint glass, the motor oil appearance got my hopes up a bit; though I was concerned by the lack of head. All doubts were put aside on the first taste. Caramael, roasted malt, chocolate, as each sip went down, I waited for the usual let-down of excitement or back-end bitterness... That never happened. This beer is incredible! Thank you Oskar Blues for bringing this stout into the world! Oskar Blues is not currently distributed in Ohio, so I will seek it out in my travels. Cheers.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Kevlee722,4.2,"Can poured into a tulip glass.  Pours a very dark brown, almost black with a small tan head that leaves a nice amount of lace as the first sip is consumed.  Bittersweet chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, and licorice on the nose. This is not a strong smelling brew, but it is a good smelling one. Nothing stands out as fantastic, but it does have a very pleasant aroma.  The flavor is immense, the first sip assaults the tip of the tongue with lots of dark chocolate bitterness followed by caramel and toffee rounding out the sweetness. The finish is lovely, with a lingering bitterness which is no doubt a part of the 98 IBUs contributing to the large flavor of this beer. As the glass warms to near room temp the chocolate shows through as the shining star of the flavor profile.  The mouthfeel is nice, a viscous chewiness is present as it coats with each new sip. Medium to high carbonation for the style, but it plays with the tongue as the thickness of the beer seems to pick up as it warms.  This is very good beer, especially for the value at around 11 or 12 bucks for four twelve ounce cans. It is fairly easy to sip on and enjoy the changes it takes on from cool to room temp. I wouldn't buy it regularly, but definitely snag a can or two every so often given the opportunity.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Very nice looking despite that it's so thick looking.  S - very complex smell. Lots of malty, chocolate, and espresso smells. They all hit you at once and its very nice.  T - tastes just as complex as it smells. Those same smells show up in the taste. Lots of malty, chocolatey goodness. Great.  M - almost a creamy feel.

Once again, blended together nicely for a smooth, smokey, nice stout. For the abv, you can't taste a large alochol flavor which I sometimes find in the imperials. Overall, this has a good taste.

Thick billowing taupe head that lasts throughout the consumption of the brew.  Aroma is very rich: dried fruits, peat, smoke, mocha. Outstanding!  Taste is about as complex as it gets for beer, the arrival is dried fruit (fig, prune), followed by a pleasant smoky malt, bitter hops, finish is chocolate and coffee, particularly long finish for a beer.  Mouthfeel is phenomenal, extremely viscous, exemplary of the style.

Lingering sweetness and coffee-like roastyness.  Full bodied, moderately chewy, with low carbonation. Little dry at the finish.  A delicious stout.

Chocolatey, roasty, cherry, licorice, and lots of alcohol.  Taste - Follows the nose. The strong licorice flavor and the overpowering booziness makes this not that great.  Mouthfeel: Very thick.  Overall: I was really excited to try this beer but I was extremely disappointed. I hate licorice flavors in imperial stouts and hate when you can taste the alcohol and you could REALLY taste both in this beer. It overpowered everything else.

2681,34483,kevanb,4.4,"It pours a syrupy jet black color, almost no head, but what does appear is a thin layer of caramel colored bubbles, very tightly knit. There is no film along the top of the glass and not even a ring of color around the glass, and this with a fairly aggressive pour. The aroma is pleasant, a bit subdued, nice chocolate malt, some roasty coffee, toffee, a hint of molasses and some alcohol with faint licorice. The flavors are much more robust and rewarding, lots of dark bitter chocolate, smooth coffee, not as roasty or salinous as the nose leads on. Not as much toffee, but more molasses, some oak and a bit more alcohol. The body is incredible, big and viscous, smooth and syrupy but definitely with a warm alcohol sensation as it goes down.  Verdict: Great Russian Imperial Stout from Oskar Blues. It’s a bit on the pricier side, but it’s definitely one to try at some point. I’ve got a few more and I’ll be really looking forward to how this one ages.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Appearance: Pours a thick black with brown tints and a very dark brown head. 2 fingers of head settle to a thin ring. Thick coating of lacing.  Smell: Dark chocolate, nuts, coffee, roasted malt and a dollop of sweetness.  Taste: Milk chocolate mixed with bittersweet chocolate, espresso beans, raisins, roasted coffee and some vanilla beans.  Mouthfeel: Coats the mouth so well with a very low carbonation. Bit of a coffee grind gives it a small layer of bitterness but this screams smooth.

The minimal head dissipates quickly leaving just the tiniest amount of bubbles. There was no lacing evident with this beer.  S: Aromas of bold chocolate with hints of alcohol, roasted malts, dark fruit, and coffee. Quite a bold nose and very pleasant.  T: Flavors are primarily of roasted malts and chocolate upfront, followed by the alcohol, coffee, and molasses. There is quite a bit of bitterness which is good for this beer and the faintest of touches of wood char/smoke.  M: Full bodied with minimal carbonation, slightly creamy and silky... almost a syrupy stickiness remains after you finish a taste.  O: I enjoyed this beer and think a tiny bit more aging/cellaring would probably do it good but am not sure that cellaring a canned beer really has a lot of effect. It is very enjoyable today so I will likely enjoy the rest of the 4 pack this winter and not worry about cellaring.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S: Chocolate and coffee come to mind. Roasted malts. Appealing in general.  T: Roasted malts and chocolate make up the backbone. It is extremely powerful and delicious, but crazy smooth with the delivery. It's like being hit by a train, but not really feeling it. Not as boozy as you'd think at all.  M: Heavy body, but gloriously so. It's like taking a bite out of something, and really spectacular when you factor in how great it tastes.

Smoky, roasty, malty base covered with the most awesome breakfast meat ever devised. Alcohol (10.5%ABV is non-existant).  M - Perfect for this style. Thick, but not fillingly so.

2681,34483,CaptDavyJones,4.43,"Poured a motor-oil black from a 12 oz can with the ABV on the can and the date and time of bottling printed under the can. Dark as night with absolutely no light penetration whatsoever. Half finger's worth of dark mocha colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. Tiny bubbles rising along the edges of the glass.  Aroma is of chocolate, chocolate and then some more chocolate. Hints of roasted malt and coffee with dark fruits and raisin like aroma come through the intense yet pleasing chocolate notes.  Wow, this is so full-bodied, creamy and silky on the palate. Absolutely no trace of alcohol or initial alcohol burn in spite of the high ABV. Upfront the malt bitterness makes it presence felt, giving way to slight sweetness in the middle, only to be completely drowned by the roasted malt, dark chocolate/cocoa bitterness. One of the tastiest RIS that I have ever had.  Easy drinking with a really good mouthfeel. Not a lot of lacing along the insides of the glass. Hands down the best canned beer and probably the best brew from Oskar Blues.

Very little head, some dark chocolate colored lacing that disappears quickly. Looks flat but maintains enough effervescence to satisfy.  Smell: Roasted malt, chocolate, you can smells 'hot' from the alcohol.  Taste: One of the best beers I have ever had from a can. This one gets better and better as it warms up, so let it sit a while between sips if you can. A rich roasted malt flavor, chocolate, this beer is somewhat sweet. The alcohol is masked by all the flavors, it really is most apparent in the smell. This beer goes down very easy. It has a nice bitter aftertaste that lingers on the tongue. Ten Fidy really opens up when it is warm.  Mouth feel: Not as thick as it looks. Oily.  Overall: A great RIS. Very satisfying, great flavors that improve as it warms.

2681,34483,magictacosinus,4.65,"Wow, a RIS in a can?? Poured out of a 12oz can into a Duvel tulip glass (to make it more intimidating).  And intimidating looking this is indeed. As black and dark looking as the design on the can. With some aid from the tulip, this does make a nice, brown head... although not for long. Insane alcohol leggings all around, and carbonation is beautifully streaked on the edges of the glass. This IS a RIS. That is all.  Okay, the smell is loaded with alcohol, but there's too many insane, bold stout aromas seeping from this thing to ever ignore. Past the obvious sweetness, there's dark chocolate, coffee beans, pistachios, crème brûlée (!!!), roasted malts, and so many more beautiful, wonderful things. There's a bit of a sting to it, although most of it manages to be very alcoholic and malty. Simply outstanding.  The taste is rather fascinating, however, as it changes as it warms up in an extremely progressive way. While cold, there were of course tastes of smoked bread, but surprisingly, soy sauce?? I took another gulp. Yep, definitely reminds me of soy sauce at the finish. After letting it warm up, that somehow disappeared. Think a wonderful, thick maltiness with a spicy bite loaded (and I mean *loaded*) with alcoholic temperament and you've got yourself one of the most aggressive and finest RISs I've had in a long time. While it's dry, it's still so thick that you could slice it up. If a beer could be a dark chocolate cake, this is it.  I'm totally blown away with how complex and satisfyingly balanced this is, despite many indications that it could be an aggressive experience! $4 for one of the best RISs you could get, honestly. Should NOT be consumed straight out of the can, however: this is the kind of beer meant for wine glasses due to the various flavors it produces, and due to its refined drinking experience that it provides. I'll have one or two more please! (And then NO MORE unless you're willing to carry me out of the bar!)",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

It has a small khaki colored head that leaves sheets of lacing as you drink.  S: Loads of roasted malt dominate the aroma. There are also bits of smokey and leathery aspects. I also pick up on a sort of beef jerky-like smell, kind of strange.  T: Roasted and burnt malts are the backbone and are quite dominant. The smokey quality appears again along with a touch of dark chocolate. I'm getting that beef jerky sense again. Don't know what that is, it's not necessarily bad, just a bit strange. Maybe I'm confusing it with a more frequently used term.  M: It has a good feel to it. It is pretty heavy and thick. Very syrup-like and drinks very smoothly. It hides the high alcohol content dangerously well.  O: This was a great RIS. One of the better ones I've had to date.

Dark as dark gets. Small off white/cream bubbles came to the top when I poured but beyond that the carbonation does not reveal itself until consumed  Aroma is almost perfect. Heavy notes of coffee/toffee/chocolate are balanced by cream and marshmallow. Why did this not get a 5? You know the ABV when you smell it.  Taste is incredible- notes of alcohol, coffee, butter, toffee, and cashews. Almost a cream texture. Really, really, really good. No question there is booze in this, but it works in this brew.

A - Dirty motor oil colored with no head initially, but a slow forming, short, cocoa-colored head after 10 seconds or so. Mainly just a ring around the edge of the glass a couple minutes in.  S - Initially, the nose was mainly booze, hickory, and chocolate. As the beer warmed, the smell wasn't as noticeable. Phenomenal smelling beer, exactly what a stout should smell like.  T - Big hit of chocolate at first with notes of dates and smoked goodness throughout. It got a bit more boozy as the beer warmed, but not overpowering. This tasted like a quintessential stout.  M - Quite creamy, heavy-bodied, not a lot of carbonation, while still being very drinkable.  O - Best stout I've ever had, and far and away, the best canned beer I've ever had.

2681,34483,BrownNut,2.73,I don't get it. People hold this up as a holy grail stout. It didn't even taste like stout to me. It didn't really taste like beer. I can't figure out what it tasted like but it was a taste that shouldn't be in a beer. Not quite fruity - maybe some kind of perfume? It wasn't necessarily a bad taste but I guess it's like when you go to take a sip of your coke and you're thrown off for a second because you had forgotten you were actually drinking iced tea. I loves me some RIS but this one must be an acquired taste. I've never had anything that tasted similar. I wouldn't order it again.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,musicforairports,4.35,"Can, bottled 11 October 2011, poured into a small snifter. Reviewed 22 January 2012.  Black. Very dark, small brown head. Pours like motor oil. Don't see much carbonation. Minimal head.  Roasted malt and espresso on the nose. Light alcohol. Pretty clean and smooth.  Flavor is so smooth. Roasted malt, dark fruit, some espresso, creamy chocolate. Very slight alcohol on the end. This is thick but quaffable. So smooth for being relatively fresh and not barrel-aged. It's like malty stout milk.  Mouthfeel is full and creamy, very light in carbonation.  Probably the best imperial stout I've ever had that didn't spend time in a barrel. And it's better--and smoother--than some that have.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Not much coffee, more of an espresso aroma, very dark and sweet.  T: Very similar to Old Rasputin. Dark molasses, dark cherry, figs. A little dark chocolate in there as well.  M: Smooth and creamy. Silky smooth, with a very mild burn in the aftertaste.  O: The BA crowd didn't steer me wrong with this one. A bit pricey ($15/4pk), but worth the occasional treat. A bit thicker and more tasty than Old Raspy, so I don't mind paying the extra $$. Very odd to see such a terrific treat in a can. A solid A+ overall.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jtierney89,4,"idk how well cans age but this ones about 3 years old. I thought oak aged yeti had the darkest head I've ever seen but I stand corrected, this thing is deep purple like. Pours like motor oil.  Lots of chocolate covered raisins on the nose with dark cherries cinnamon and vanilla. Smells like a fudge store. Incredibly thick and creamy mouthfeel. Flavors are surprisingly rather subdued but that could be the ageing on it. Roasted malts up front with creamy chocolate in the middle. Finishes with bitter coffee and chocolate cover flavored raisins. Impeccably blended flavors and increibly smoothness. Almost no detection of alcohol.  Impressive imperial stout that withstands the test of time of being abused in my liquor store. Good, but worth 11.99 (sale price for being old) for a 4 pack? Eh, possibly. But 14.99? I'll take a yeti. Still good though, best canned beer I've had yet.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SLeffler27,4.33,"A Dogfish Head snifter showcases this black to very dark walnut beer. A dense, chestnut brown head raises about a half inch before settling to a thin layer leaving patchy lace. A viscous film washes over the glass with each sip. A swirl produces lots of regenerative carbonation.  The rich, roasted malts are more prominent from the growler than they were on draft. Dark chocolate fudge with espresso and bourbon dominate the olfactory. The nuances of these aromas suffer from time in the growler. Notes of cedar are revealed with warmth.  It is intriguing how significantly the growler impacted this beer. The flavors are all still there and similar to the nose, but muddier than on draft. Accents include fig and cigar tobacco. The finish is long with roasted and bitter notes all the way through.  Ten FIDY is a full bodied beer with soft carbonation and syrupy texture. It is dry with warming alcohol, a real mouthful, highly satisfying.  Definitely a must-have whenever found on draft, but the growler is still great. I look forward to comparing the canned version of Ten FIDY once I find it. Sip and enjoy. This one pairs perfectly with a wood fire on a cold winter’s day.  Had this on draft 06.Feb.2010 and it was amazing.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A: Pours dark, dark, and darker with minimal head, even with an aggressive pour. Rim of khaki around the edge in my Delirium tulip.  S: Mostly dark fruits with a slight hint of smoked malts initially. As it warms up, the malt comes out slightly more.  T: Initial sweetness (with this ABV, that's to be expected) followed by the dark fruit I had picked up in the nose. Lingering and pleasant taste left with the malt and cocoa dominating.  M: Extremely smooth for the ABV with little carbonation. Definitely enjoyed this aspect.  O: Having had this beer only once before and remembering it to be great, I was not let down. I may have enjoyed it in the wrong venue and would have liked to share it with a friend, but I didn't mind having it all to myself at all.

2681,34483,Aiptasia,3.33,"First, the descriptions of this beer are fairly accurate. Here's the gist:  It's good. It's not quite great (for me), but it's good. I poured this beer into a pint glass and have been letting it warm up a little next to me, and been sipping it over the course of the last ten minutes.  A: It pours like a stout. Dark rich malts give it a deep high lovibond. Head was nowhere to be seen. A scatter star of lacing and no residual anywhere. It's sitting in my glass in a flat-coke utility kinda way.  S: Soy bomb. It reeks of tamari soy sauce. I guess that means it has umami, and yes, sushi would be a perfect pairing for it.  T: Surprisingly good given the smell. It has a citrus note that's lacking in most stouts. I'm going to assume it's coming from the hops, which are present but in a constant struggle for dominance against the sweet and sour sauce smoked malt. The taste is the best part.  M: Warming and comfortable, like a tongue sweater; it coats well. The smoked coffee aftertaste coming from the roasted malts isn't too overpowering. It's medium thick and sweet.  O: Overall, I have to give it an average rating. The smell is off putting to me and the slightly sour tang from the citrus notes comes across as asorbic. Definitely pair it with a protein.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,beesy,4.5,"Poured from a can into a standard pint glass.  A - pours a dark, engine oil black with a finger and a half dark brown head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving a foam film around the diameter of the glass  S - Roasted malts, dark chocolate, milk chocolate and the similar ashy/acrid aroma of fresh groud coffee house espresso beans. Slightly boozy. An intriguing aroma the begs this brew to be drank.  T - Roast, chocolate, coffee throughout, with a slight caramel flavor up front that turns into some fig and plum that turns into massive amounts of chocolate 3/4 the way through and finishes with lots of roast. A firm hop bitterness lingers slightly on the palate. Noticable yeast character without becoming over-estery. Alcohol detected in medium amounts - enough to know you are drinking a bigger beer.  M - full bodied, but needs to be to hold all the flavor in this one. Not overly thick or slick. Any more attenuated and the hop bitterness and roast would overwhelm and any less and it would become cloyingly sweet.  D - moderate-low drinkability for me. Somewhat filling.  Overall, a fantastic example of a RIS. I'd like to get some age on this to see if the alcohol will mute a slight amount, but that's really the only complaint I have with this beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Not very many other easy to get stouts.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,tony223366,4.2,"A: About as black as possible. Pretty much looks like oil. Even in direct light I get no reds. About one finger of brown head from a vigorous pour that slowly dissipated into a fine layer.  S: Rich molasses and lots of roasted aromas. I get some small amount of dark chocolate, but it quickly gives way to the roasted, almost smoky, malts. Wish it was a little more in my face as a RIS.  T: Now this is what I'm talking about. Really rich chocolate with deep seated roasted flavors. Very espresso-like. Some darker fruits make their presence known here. Some layered bitterness as well. Seems to me that the bitterness is both from the deeply roasted malts and the hop presence. Some warming alcohol and a nice roasted bitterness finishes this beer off.  M: Full body with tons of carbonation. Nice slickness. I do like how active this beer is.  O: Rich and delicious. Not my favorite Imp. Stout (tough category!) but it's up there. So decadent.

The beer looks good with a good thick and black body to go along with tan lacing that's very thick and does not fade away quickly. The aroma's not something I'm qualified to assess. I can't smell very well!  The taste's great. It doesn't have strong coffee flavors like many RIS beers, and it's something I prefer. There's some sweetness to the beer to soften up the stout flavor profile.  The mouthfeel's great, and it's very viscous and nowhere close to being thin. It lingers in your mouth for a long time, and what can I say?  I'd buy this beer once in a while, and I imagine when I'm in the mood, it'd be worth the $14-$15 for a 4-pack.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Smells of roasted malts and alcohol, with hints of caramel and vanilla. Smells like a big beer.  Taste is too, bold but balanced. Dark cocoa, caramel, and subtle dark fruit occupy the front of the tongue while the roasted malts do a number on the back.  Body is perfect: thick but not sticky or chewy. Extremely appropriate given the grain bill. The flavors are properly - and slowly - distributed across the palate. Really just wonderful.  Well, this is a great beer.

Lacing is oily, and is continually sliding down the snifter.  Smells of soy sauce, sweet malt, char, and a touch of astringency. Barely detectable is some dark cherry, but I feel it's more from the alcohol.  Taste is all malt, roasted, bitter, a hint of sweet molasses. Roast is the primary.  Feel is smooth and thick. Almost no carbonation to the brew, a hint of hop bite on the tip of my tongue is the only indication they were ever there. Not a easy drinker for me.  While this beer does many things well, every aspect has something I feel I want a little better. Needs more head(and who doesn't amirite?). A little too much soy sauce in the smell. Needs more sweet on the taste to balance. Needs a touch more carbonation to lighten this up and make for a more creamy feel. I liked this beer alot, the first canned beer I have every really liked, and that's saying something. In all honesty, the hype over this beer is what made me cross the line to the can. I am not disappointed, but I don't think it's as good as Old Raspy, which is far cheaper.

Typical thick black stout. 1/8 inch of brown head with an aggressive pour that dissipates quickly  S. The nose was not as big as I expected but light chocolate and coffee flavors were there along with dark fruit but the roasted malts and booze play the biggest roles.  T. Like the nose the chocolate and subtle coffee flavors are there but booze and roasted malts are big players. The chocolate and coffee comes first followed by the boozy dark fruits and the finish has a very enjoyable vanilla quality.  M. Thick and viscous but what would you expect with a beer called Ten Fidy? The carbonation is decent for a beer of this size.  O. Let me start by saying that I drank the first half of the beer for the review and then grabbed a slice of German chocolate cake to enjoy with the second half. The cake took this beer up a notch and was an amazing pair. The cake pulled out more of the sweet vanilla finish which is my favorite aspect of this beer. Imperial stouts are my favorite style and Ten Fidy is a good one. I hear a lot of complaints about the price of this beer but at less than $8 for the equivalent of a bomber of a great 10.5% stout is well worth it too me. I am curious how it will age in a can so I grabbed a few four packs and I will let you know in a few years!

Finishes with some rum and licorice notes. Good complexity.  M: Viscous and thick, like you'd expect. Silky smooth going down (with only a minor burn) and low carbonation.  O: Not my absolute favorite imperial stout, but I'm still a fan.

No head, but thats the be expected from a good RIS with an ABV of 10.  It smells like slightly roasted malts and oak. Vanilla as well. Its absent of bourbon, and Im actually very pleased with that.  The first thing that comes to mind is liquid oak. Very dry and woody oak chips. Hints of vanilla and bitter coffee beans. Very full and thick body, about as thick as the pour (well maybe thicker). Very roasty and still smooth in spite of the the lingering bitterness from the malt and coffee.  Leaves a very chewy feeling from the oats and malt bill.

Very slight drying from the alcohol.

I've found that people are generally shying away from the can but it's gaining a little more of a following each year. The Ten Fidy pours out looking like warm (aka not quite so thick) motor oil. Not only is it pouring into my glass absolutely black as night, but there is almost no foam to speak of. The foam you see in the picture was only after pouring the last 3oz pretty vigorously. If you don't believe me, check out the video of the pour.  The foam that does arise is a very dark almond shade of brown and lingers around for a long, long time. After about 20 minutes there is still a thin film of coffee-brown foam, with pretty significant lacing left on the glass. At first the nose is very soft with just a mild amount of roasted malts and coffee coming through. As the beer warms a bit, I'm getting a larger variety of roasts, toffee, chocolate, and more.  On the palate the Ten Fidy is thick and viscous, yet very easy to drink. Tons of roasted malts dominate my palate with a clean toasty finish and just a touch of dry bitterness.

Aroma is nice, with lots of mocha, coffee and roastiness. Mouthfeel is lovely, with the bier being satiny slick on the tongue, with a body that is medium-plus with nice chewiness.  Flavor has some nice sweetness all around. The mix of malts coat the palate with some dark chocolate, a smidge of molasses, roasty coffee notes, and some dark fruit action like dates and figs.

A: One of the darkest beers that I've ever seen: Pitch black with a deep brown, one and a half finger's worth of head. Quite a bit of lacing left behind on the glass.  S: Deep, malty, chocolate and coffee aroma. Very malty, and the slight smell of char. Surprisingly subtle, however.  T: Wow. Way more flavor than the smell seems to suggest. Bitter, chocolate malts are up front, with molasses, alcoholic esters, coffee. Lots of flavors that seem to hit all at once and then fade into a slightly alcoholic, bitter coffee aftertaste. Very sweet up front, but the hops balance it out somewhat, as well as the bitter malts.  M: Rich, thick and creamy. Not much carbonation. Very heavy body, as befits the style.  O: A hefty beer to be sure, and not one for the faint of heart. I'm happy to say that I see no evidence of aluminum tainting the brew.

I was told it pours like molasses. That's no joke; it did (poured into a Piraat tulip).  S -- Mainly chocolate, slightly tobacco, coffee and very ripe fruit. I can already smell the roasted barley.  T -- Starts out with a lot of roasted flavor, works through spicy fruit and coffee to citrusy hops with plenty of acid. A slight sweetness lingers. Astringency is absent in this big beer.  M -- It's a mouthful! Complex and syrupy as I expected, but it lacked the tannin tang I had expected.  O -- As expected, it's a great beer from Oskar Blues. I enjoyed the taste, but the mouthfeel and carbonation weren't quite what I expected. Next time, I think I'll let it warm up a little more before cracking it open. I'd definitely drink it again, but I hedge it with this: a better Oskar Blues: a cold Old Chub. A better big stout: Dogfish WW Stout crushes this one.  Update, 1/11/12: warmer was better.

Fortune cookie: Rollin Fidys. Poured into a shaker glass, and oh it's got a dark thick 1-inch head.  Appearance is a 4.5 for blackest black with such a nice brown foam. It even looks thick when swirling the glass.  Aroma roast with some bittersweet aroma which may be chocolate/molasses. 4.25  Taste is a big hit of bitter roast, hops with a bit of a heavy edge in the body a good bit more than in the flavor, and some back-of-the-throat warmth. I've been digging Even More Jesus cans by Evil Twin recently, and this is a similar profile of that can (bigger pint can, a bit less per can, too). I love how this lingers with a roasty/sweet malty finish. Really enjoying this. 4.5  Feel is a little less thick than I remember from last time I tried it, probably five years ago or more. That foam is about 1/4 inch of foam with tight bubbles that's almost like a light meringue that puts nitro beers to shame. It's nice to take a sip and have to pull it through the foam. Woah. I'm going 4.75.  Overall a 4.5 for me. Really like it and am starting to get a sense of why it's revered so well.

I am loving this beer and cannot get enough of it. There is huge notes of coffee and chocolate. This is a sweet beer that would be paired amazingly with some dark chocolate or any dessert. Oddly enough I'm getting hints of fruit which I wasn't expecting at all. Notes of hops may throw a few people off but overall for a beer geek it doesn't get much better.  Mouthfeel:  This beer should not be this easy to drink for a 10.5% beer. This is dangerous because I could put a few of these down and be flat on my ass. The carbonation holds up great and even for a huge stout this beer goes down easy.  Overall:  This is one of my favorite stouts hands down. If you are a fan of big beers I'd seek this one out. Sadly for me its not available in my state so I have to travel to get it. If you can obtain this beer grab it in a heartbeat because it is hard to be disappointed by this beer.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,FanofHefe,4.3,"12 oz. can that was canned on 11-14-11, so only about seven weeks old. Pours a deep black body with no noticeable light getting through. A small dark mocha head that leaves a bit of lacing along the glass.  The aroma is pure chocolate and roasted malt. I say pure, but there is a very small note of hops in the background.  The flavor is very rich, following the aroma with the chocolate and roasted malt. There is also a bit of coffee in the flavor that I didn't get in the aroma. Again, at the end of the flavor profile, I get a small note of citrus (lemon) hops.  This is one of the thickest stouts I can recall drinking and is very smooth. No substanital notice of the alcohol. I had previously posted a while back that I wasn't as fond of Ten FIDY as other stouts. But, upon having it again (maybe two years later?), I can say this is definitely an outstanding RIS.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,StonedTrippin,4.18,"this is a HUGE beer. pours muddy fudge black into a full pint glass (wow) with a dark brown head and inch high. smells really really strong, bittersweet coffee notes, and bread grains. taste is really bold, heavy dark roasted malts up front and a stiff bitterness on the back end, molasses and espresso in between. mouthfeel is great here, carbonated just enough, and really smooth for such a strong brew. overall a very impressive imperial stout, maybe the best ive had. got to be careful with these though, can get loose pretty quick with the abv. fresh at the brewery in lyons this was epic",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jpbebeau,4.38,"Can to tulip. Dated 10/11/11.  A: This thing *glugs* out of the mouth of the can: black gold/texas tea style. Thick and dark. Black, black, black; the only color is in a finger's worth of mocha head, which dissipated faster than I anticipated down to a stubborn thin film. Legs.  S: Chocolate malty goodness.  T: Finely-balanced sweet mild dark chocolate and coffee-tinged bitterness (again, mild) of roasted malts.  M: Smooth. Coats the palate fully, pleasantly, with small particulate carbonation throughout.  O: So balanced. A pleasure to drink—and it is drinkable despite its 10.5% ABV. Took an effort to slow down.

Smells of roasted malt, cocoa, licorice, a little must. Flavor is sweet, with a mix of bitterness and sweetness in the finish. Big mouthfeel, yet smooth and drinkable. Long finish. My go to beer for backpacking trips - concentrated goodness.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,One2Remeber,4.72,"Poured into an Unibroue snifter.  A: Looks like black liquorice, syrup as poured. Extremely frothy, dense, creamy mocha head that stays around. Body is pitch black. Looks inviting like cake for dessert.  S: Smells like malt bomb, really fresh like I'm in the brewhouse. A distinct toasty, bready grain aroma. Fruity notes and heavy oats on the undertones. Black liquorice candy smell covers any alcohol presence.  T: Creamy smooth oatmeal taste off the bat then goes to a bite of black liquorice. Fruity hops sit on the palate making me want to swish the beer around instead letting it go down. So much rich, smooth, pleasantly enjoyable flavor going on. Nothing is over bearable. The end taste is a malt bomb, like 7 different malt taste trying to fight for dominance at the end, yet they all go down in unison before a winner is announced.  M: Way to drinkable for its strength. A strong oatmeal presence makes all the flavors not TOO dominant so one can hold on palate and really savor each sip. Great beer:)  O: I feel like I'm finishing a bowl of coco puffs with chocolate milk; fresh bready grain flavor with an intense amount of malt flavor. The oatmeal reminds me of breakfast and the fruity presence makes it over the top. Reminds me of Expedition from Bells brewery, just not as potent. Would love to have side by side.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ZenAgnostic,4.27,"Aged about a year. 12oz stamped CANNED ON 12-02-10. Poured into Duvel tulip.  Appearance - Jet black body. After a half-vigorous pour, makes a two finger dark brown head. Top head doesn't leave much stick, but when tiliting the glass, it's pretty good. Decent retention.  Smell - Dark roasted coffee. Some hop bitterness. Olives, but not in the pungent, offensive way that the character sometimes expresses. Definite rubbing alcohol as the beer warms. Some chocolate. Almost candy fruity like Starburst or fruit roll ups. Gets very complex and suprising as it warms. Definitely one of the most complex smellers I've come across.  Taste - Strong alcohol that's quickly balanced out by a creamy chocolate with mild hoppy bitterness. Boozy. Dark fruit when agitated.  Mouthfeel - Coats the tongue. Just enough astringent solvency to help keep it from sticking around uncomfortably.  Overall Drinkability - Strong, balanced, complex and enjoyable. Slow drink.

I mean dark brown, like a deep stained wood. Perfect retention and lacing.  nose: Chocolatey, roasty, distinct yeast note.  Middle: syrupy mouthfeel reveals a malt-driven complexity of coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, and alcohol pungency. this is jam-packed with flavor. Definitely not a session ale! This is a treat to be enjoyed slowly as the ale warms. However, Slow is hard to do when the beer is this good. I taste more things with every sip. very complex.  Finish: dry with oatmeal chocolate coffee, slight hop bitterness.  This is a great beer and also the blackest beer I think I've ever had. It was a real treat drinking this one.

2681,34483,thecheapies,4.38,"It's can night. Third straight outta cylindrical aluminium. My brandy snifter will be the vessel of choice for Oskar Blues Ten FIDY. Canned on Halloween day, '11. Here goes!  Motor oil pour with a rich, bottom-forming, cappuccino head. Looks like creamy carbonated chocolate syrup. You could use this brew as a prop for blood in black-and-white movies. This beer is almost impeccable in appearance. Succulent.  First whiff was easy and slow; sugars, burnt and caramelized. A little lactose, maybe. Let's get in there and really sniff! Booze. That's what followed. Cold-press coffee (fruity and boisterous). Vanilla ice cream, hop tinge, yellow cake. Sinister, what must lie beneath these fumes.  First sip... there's the 98 IBUs! Where did that beautiful hop bitter zing come from?! RIS, nailed! Roasty and somewhat smoky, outta nowhere. Not so much of the vanilla sweetness. Tremendous body. A little coffee and a lot of the alcohol bleeding through. Very heady and warming. Let me open this up a bit. Full-bodied, like whipping cream. Silky and robust, like a cold cup o' cocoa. Whether I've just taken a sip or not, my mouth is swimming in this stuff. Coating. Slight antiseptic quality is mentionable. Licorice comes through as it warms.  In my RIS Top 5.

2681,34483,Thingus,4.75,"I generally pick these up in multiples since I know I won't drink just one!! Live tasting into tulip.  Appearance; aggressive pour yields one pinky of rich mahogany colored head that dissipates quickly with not a trace. ""Dark as a steers tuchas on a moonlit night"" a solid pitch black.  Smell; Im getting coffee and hints of chocolate as far as the smell... Mellow but I don't mind that.  Taste; Ten Fidy is a knockout in this department, mocha, coffee, the slightest touch of smoke and tobacco... A supremely mild bitterness on the finish that compliments the overall roastiness and coffee flavors...  Mouthfeel; is supremely viscous, but I don't think I'd call it syrupy as it doesn't taste sweet to me (syrupy and sweet go hand in hand IMO)... Definitely full bodied and easy to sink your teeth into... Coats the mouth, very, very smooth..  Overall; I think this is a phenomenal beer and I love how comparitvely easy it is to get this brew. It is consistently fantastic, and I could likely drink this every night without it becoming routine.

2681,34483,Vylo,3.94,"Appearance is the highlight. Black as night with a thin brown head, as to be expected from a stout.  Smell is underwhelming, but unless you are trying to snort your beer, somewhat irrelevant.  Bold strong taste. Chocolatety, bitter, but not too much so. Well balanced.  Low carbonation on the mouthfeel as expected. Above average for stouts, but a bit more syrupy then I think would be prefered.  Worth a shot if you are into stouts. If they aren't your flavor, you could stand to be a bit more selective, but still not an unworthwhile beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Agressive pour leaves a 1 finger dense and creamy brown head which settles out pretty quickly, otherwise I'd rate it higher. The aromas are jumping out of the snifter I poured into, chocolate, coffee, and a certain bit of roastiness. I'm getting lots of flavors here. First it's chocolatey sweetness followed by notes of coffee and hops which are a nice balance to the chocolatey sweet. It's full bodied with some very complex flavors going on. It coats my mouth and leaves a small bitter aftertaste, very good I am very pleased with this beer. There is quite a bit going on with the flavors and aromas. A great stout for a cold winter day.

2681,34483,TheWhiskerReview,4.32,"Pours black as my soul with a dense 3-finger brown head that forms like an atom bomb exploding in slow motion. Imagine swimming in motor oil. Leaves some lace clinging to the top but by the middle of the brew, it's receded to just a small ring.  The nose is incredibly woodsy with syrupy black licorice, espresso, stewed dark fruits, overripe bananas and an intense booziness.  Palate has an incredibly full mouthfeel- sweet and viscous, coating the mouth and lingering long after the swallow. Opens with a rush of chocolate syrup covered bananas, espresso, toffee and a touch of raisin. Wow is the presentation long. This lingers for a few seconds before a bit of spice segues into ample, but never overpowering, bitterness- joined by a ridiculously intense fusel alcohol character which adds its own bit of astringency, ensuring that the beer doesn't end too sweet but not once interrupting the incredibly smooth texture.  I'm pretty sure I'll still be tasting that fusel-like finish when I wake up tomorrow, not to mention I could run my car with this beer. Freaking amazing. And considering the only other things I've had that taste anywhere near this are the the Stone RIS and the DFH WWS, at $6.99/22oz and $10-12/12oz respectively, I think this is worth the price.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,tylerprince,3.61,"Poured hard from a can into a pint glass.  A: The color spectrum equivalent of absolute zero...pitch black. No light passes through this bad boy. Pretty headless despite the hard pour, but leaves a nice caramel colored lacing.  S: Pretty mild, but smells fairly smoky with hints of chocolate.  T: Very chocolatey, essentially overpowering any other flavor. Hints of oats and coffee. Quite a bit of alcohol taste at the end, but coupled with some fruit - banana, strawberry? at the very very end. This beer isn't particularly complex or brilliant, IMHO, just really, really big.  M: Oil. The US should drop out of the Middle East and simply brew Ten Fidy. Extremely full bodied, creamy. Quite a bit of carbonation, which is necessary to make this beer palatable. Very low on the drinkability scale, but it does feel pretty darn good.  O: A total slap in the face. A decent RIS, but it's not good enough to justify the price tag for me.

Lots of chocolate upfront with a hint of hops. No trace of booze at all.  T- Mother of God.... It tastes strongly of chocolate and malty goodness. This beer has an alcohol content of 10.5% (hence the name ""Ten FIDY""), but it is hardly present in the taste. Everything is balanced perfectly. Not too sweet. Not too bitter. Not too boozy. One of the best RIS's I've had.  M- It feels like velvet going down. Decent carbonation. One thing I will mention is that I think this beer is pretty filling. It would be difficult to drink more than two of these in a night....and expensive. I'm sure i would if i could though.  Over all, I love this beer.

Hold it up to the light and still nothing gets through. Just spilled a little on my shirt and I don't think that's ever coming out. It smells a little too much like vodka and coke to me. Some chocolate in there, but not enough to off-set the alc. The taste is not as chocolatey and smooth as I would have hoped, and there is a little burn toward the end which I would like to have masked a touch better, but all in all, it is pretty fine given the 10%. It is a bit lively, too, with a whisk of fruity flavors before the coffee and dark chocolate wash, then finishing with that slight burn.  I'll be honest, this just isn't my style. I don't need to taste my alcohol to enjoy it, and although this beer does a better job then most at masking it, it seems a little bit too much like a chocolate flavored rum...with a lot of body.

Head dissipates down almost immediately to leave only an outer ring. Leaves some mild lacing on the side that’s being drank from but otherwise no lacing.  S: Roasted malt and a smokey character are the predominate scents. They are joined by aromas of dark ripe fruits (particularly raisin), coffee, booze, and a subtle hint of bakers chocolate.  T: The initial flavor is dark fruits upfront with roasted malts on the back end. As I continue to drink other flavors that come out are bitter dark chocolate, plums, raisins, and coffee. The roasted character is initially the most prominent flavor, and then is joined by a significant hop bitterness. As it warms the coffee and chocolate flavors become more prominent, and a boozy character shows itself as well, but in a balancing way not a distracting way. Very good palate profile.  M/D: Damn is this smooth. Such a silky smooth oily mouthfeel with not a hint of heat going down. Full bodied, a nice very subtle carbonation. Incredibly easy to drink, with a double digit ABV that’s wonderfully kept in check. Perfect.  O: Overall, a fantastic RIS.

Pours a very thick two finger head, which rapidly reduces to a thin cap. Lively stout though and easily revived with a swirl of the glass. Black, opaque color.  Rich, malt driven aroma, chocolate and caramel, roasted malt, yeast and dark break. Complex. Could be a little more distinct IMO.  Incredibly rich, chocolate and huge roasted malt entry on the palate. Massive body, very full mouth feel. Dark unsweetened chocolate, caramel. No bitterness, just mind blowing richness. Wow!

I was really excited that I got try this one and I am defiantly going to pick this up if I see it during my future travels. The can was relatively fresh with an October canning date. I poured the 120z can into my DFH snifter glass to find a nice deep black body. I was surprised that the head was on the small side and dissipated quickly. The aroma was nice with cocoa, roasted coffee, and a few hints of sweetness with vanilla.  The taste was just exceptional, I was really surprised by this one. Great balance of flavors with the malts, molasses, coffee and chocolate. This one wasn't as hot as I expected it to be with the ABV, it was really on the smooth side.  The mouthfeel was perfect. This one is dangerous because it is very easy to drink and I could easily put down a few in one sitting.

2681,34483,Alieniloquium,3.91,"12 oz. can poured into a goblet.  Appearance - One of the blackest stouts I have ever seen. No light, not even as I poured it, passes through. It fills the glass with a slight chocolate head that dies down to wisps of bubbles and hints of lacing on the glass.  Smell - Roasted malts, sure. Chocolate, coffee. But what I am most surprised about his the light hop aroma. Definite citrus aroma to it that really manages to be stronger than the other aromas.  Taste - Much more stout-like than the aroma. Chocolate and coffee again. Some of the lighter malts come through as toffee and a slight fruitiness, but more of a dark fruit. It's consistently bitter throughout. Perhaps oppressively so.  Mouthfeel - Not as thick as I'd expect. Fairly light bodied for such a big stout. No booze in it, either. The bitterness is a detractor though.  Overall - I have had this a few times and always enjoyed it, but never thought it was as good as the ratings suggest. Definitely a quality and easily obtainable stout, but my money would go to Old Rasputin before this. I also have a few older cans that I'd like to try. I'm hoping the hops will fade a bit to let the malts shine a little more. We'll see.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Dark tan head forms after a vigorous pour that dissipates quite quickly leaving a thin head that lingers aroud for a long time.!!!  Smell _ Moderate amount of roasty and expresso coffee notes and underlying dark chocolate. At a 10.5 abv I would expect to smell some alcohol but none here. I found the nose to be a little muted .  Taste _ Crazy smooth I mean I can taste no alcohol and it isn't the least bit hot. There are some enjoyable coffee and subtle coco aftertaste. I would suggest enjoying this one on the warmer side of cold definitely getting better after warming up a bit  Mouthfeel _ A little thiner than I thought it would be but still a full bodied adult beverage. Definitely not stickysweet very enjoyable  Overall : This is a very solid beer and worth repeating.

2681,34483,Scrapss,4.65,"Purchased at my local distributor for $82 and change out the door with the governer's cut.  It's in a can. A fsking can. I can't believe I just paid $80+ for canned 24 pack. Then I think of bar prices. that's 3.25 a can. At the local (dive) watering hole, 3.25 gets you two 8 oz. drafts of Milwaukee's Best Ice and enough left over for a pickled egg. I don't feel so bad now that I have that perspective.  A quick search of uncle google and my bestest pal Beer Advocate told me that I was not crazy for trying this at that price. Since I am a huge fan of the Blackout Stout from the guys up in Great Lakes, I figured with this style/review/points/etc. it would not disappoint.  It doesn't.  A: Poured from the can into a standard wine glass (did I just say that?), it pours thick as all get out and a roasty, highly coffee colored 1 finger head. Speaking of roasty and coffee, the highly roasted character of the beer absorbs light at a rate not unlike a black hole. This beer is DARK. And I am loving that. Settles into a wispy ring that follows it down the glass.  S: No surprise, malty and light wheat almost, there is a very very slight hint of chocolate, ripe cherries?  T: toffee, coffee, roasted malts, and a very slight hint of what my palate says is bitter orange or cherries, almost like eating an orange rind, but mild and toned down a whole lot.  M: At approximately 55 degrees, this is extremely smooth and creamy, warming with boozy qualities. Very smooth, and filling after the gulp. Lingering aroma of roast and taste of stong coffee.  O: This beer is like the Jules Winfield of Stouts. If TenFidy ever got a movie made about it, Sam Jackson himself would play the role of TenFidy: it's that damn smooth but it will assert itself with great vengence and furious anger if you try to destroy too many all in one sitting.

The aroma is tons of strong roasted malts and a hint of alcohol. Not a lot of nuance but pleasant. Taste is more of the same, pretty straightforward, lots of roasted, chocolately malt with a touch of acridness and a good dose of warming alcohol that manages to avoid being harsh. Carbonation is medium-low which gives a good smooth and full mouthfeel. Overall this is a super nice, very accessible RIS, it lacks some of the complexity of its more specialized brethren but it does not disappoint.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,syrupjoe,4.3,"12oz can into pint glass.  Pours an almost black color with a slight dark red tint. When held up to the light, it's blood red around the edges of the glass. Creamy caramel brown head.  Roast, cocoa, cherry, leather, slight coffee and booze notes on the nose.  Taste is acidic, roasty as all get-out, leathery, slightly chocolatey, bitter and savory.  Moderate to low carbonation with a sweet but dry mouthfeel. This is surprisingly un-boozy on the tongue.  Overall a very solid RIS. Some interesting savory notes that seem out of place but quite well balanced and the best concealed booziness I've ever had in a RIS. Would definitely drink again!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,mkotsayfan,4.38,"Poured from a 12oz can into snifter. Pours a deep black with a nice 1.5 finger mocha head, and very nice lacing, a very attractive looking beer. The aroma is pretty straightforward for a stout, roasted malts and coffee, along with some molasses. The taste has some light roasted malts, molasses, and coffee, and a hint of chocolate. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied and decent/light carbonation, very syrupy and thick but also creamy and smooth, a delightful mouthfeel indeed.  A great beer from Oskar Blues, a nice and creamy thick stout that hides its high ABV very well. I'm glad I have a few more of these laying around.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Tschnab,4.35,"A- jet black, no light is coming through this one, good thick dark brown head and plenty of alcohol legs.  S- smells very malty, roasty, rum, raisin, licorice, plum.  T- like the nose, this is a very rich and wintery fruit flavored beer, layered with roasted malts, sweet rum, warming alcohol esthers, candy sugars.  O- an awesome impy stout here, it blew my mind honestly, because this might be the most drinkable beer for it's abv I've ever had.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,woosterbill,4.11,"On-tap at Prime 16 into a 3/4 pint glass.  A: Fully black body that glows vermillion around the extreme edges when held up to light. 1/2"" head of dense, pillowy brown foam. Good retention, great lace. Intense-looking, gorgeous stout.  S: Big + rich: chocolate, coffee, brownie batter, and booze. Quite good, but nothing really stands out to make it especially memorable.  T: Follows the nose: sweet and roasty up front, with major chocolate and brownie elements leading to a finish that balances the malty goodness with some earthy hop bitterness and a healthy dose of alcohol. Definitely boozier than I'd like for a sub-10% beer, but still very tasty.  M: Thick, viscous, and explosive. Definitely a bit overly frothy, but still hugely enjoyable.  O: Great beer, but I think I like it better from the can.  Cheers!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jegross2,4.35,"Aged (2010 vintage) can pored in a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a sludgy black color that looks exactly like used motor oil. Completely opaque. Pours a half finger of brown head that disappears when it settles. Below average lacing, but that is to be expected with such a high gravity beer. 4/5  Smell: Huge aromas of unrefined cocoa and bittersweet chocolate. Hints of cream, some marshmallow. Subtle hop bitterness as well. Booziness is definitely apparent. 4/5  Taste: Creamy dark chocolate. Roasted malts. A little sweet and smoky wood on the mid-palate. Warming alcohol is apparent, but it's very balanced and thus more cuddling that distracting. Finishes with unsweetened chocolate, some coffee beans, and warming alcohol. 4.5/5  Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied, very low carbonation. Very oily on the tongue. Finishes dry. 4.5  Overall: One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts on the market. I've had this fresh and enjoyed it, but aging this beers makes it incredibly smooth. Certainly worth buying and sticking in your fridge for a while.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Fair amount of lacing along the glass.  S: Major notes of chocolate as expected, but also strong hints of bitterness from the hops. I expected the hops to come through in the taste, but probably not in the nose. Some clues that the beer will be sweet as well.  T: Chocolate malt upfront, with a light caramel sweetness. Strong bitterness from the hops also. Definitely not used to this level of hop bitterness in a stout, but it works well.  M: So creamy, so delicious. This is easily the creamiest, full-bodied beer I've had. Imagine the creaminess of Guinness, but without it's thin body. Perfect.  O: Great beer.

S: Cocoa, slight smoke, coffee w/cream.  T: Charred malts, bakers chocolate, dark berries, molasses, & licorice. Not as hopped up as many RIS, but there is a moderate pine hop aftertaste. Maybe a tad too sweet. A slight hotness at the end, too.  M: Creamy, thick, smooth. Leaves my mouth dry after every sip. The dark fruit/berry flavor really kicks in warming up.

One of those beers I will attempt to cellar and know I'll have a hard time knowing how good it is. 2011 Vintage  A - Wonderful - Deep black body that is complimented by a dark caramel head. Poured about 2 fingers to start which falls to a trace amount. Some slight lacing.  S - Molasses and caramel. A little burn but not bad by any means.  T - A little burnt malts and molasses. Dark chocolate type bitterness. The caramel is there but very light. Well balanced between the sweetness and bitter chocolates. Very nice.  M - Stong carbonation and thick body. There is some dryness on the finish. Higher carbonation that a lot of stouts and high alcohol beers, but this is good.  O - A wonderful beer at a great price. Definitely a regular in my line-up but want to do a side-by-side with some other regular RIS beers available. Need to find my favorite.  EDIT: Opened an 09 tonight. I was searching for off flavors.

Almost a leather like quality as well. 2 years has done this one well, with the alcohol practically non existent.  M: Full body with low carbonation.  D/O: Great RIS.

2681,34483,mithrascruor,4.52,"12 oz. can poured into a chalice.  Appearance: Pours a black color with a thin brown film, mostly around the edges. Looks quite still, though there's a little cluster of bubbles sitting there quietly on top...  Smell: The aroma first strikes me as being both rich and warm, without imparting any particular flavors to me. The more I sniff, I recognize some sweetness. Not quite vanilla, and not quite caramel, but no matter, it smells nice.  Taste: Nice toasty malt flavor. The same sweet flavors that I detected in the aroma are present here, nicely offsetting the somewhat bitter roasted flavors. Very nicely balanced. There's surely some alcohol in there, especially at the finish, but it is kept mild and doesn't overhwhelm. Despite being served fairly cold, the flavors didn't seem very muted at all at the start.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, with a bit of pleasing graininess. Medium- to heavy-bodied, but not terribly dense. Light, tingly carbonation.  Drinkability: Strong, but heck, it is an IRS. The easiest-to-drink Imperial Stout that I've ever had, hands-down.  Finally shelled out the big bucks for a 4-pack of this, and I'm quite happy with it. The flavor is very nice: it isn't too bold, so it leaves room for subtleties in an oft over-the-top (or at the least, rather extreme) style. The alcohol doesn't make me shudder either.

Taste: Ten Fidy has a nice blend of flavors that all kind of balance each other nicely, roasted malt, coffee, oak notes, bourbon, vanilla and just enough alcohol burn to remind you about the abv.

Pours with absolutely no carbonation, somehow forms a head that looks like espresso foam. Laces pretty faintly. Smell is like Nutella on slightly burnt toast. The taste is dark mocha, with a nice bitterness to it...something almost like worcestershire sauce. Mouthfeel trends strongly syrupy, but not like it coats your tongue. Just enough carbonation to make it very drinkable.  I'm not a big stout guy, but this one is fantastic. And it comes in a can.

Taste is like the smell. Tons of espresso and dark chocolate coming through. There is definitely a licorice or dark fruit behind the espresso and chocolate. A nice overall bitterness to keep this from being too sweet. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy and carbonation is mild. Overall, the perfect representation of an RIS.

About 2 fingers worth of a frothy mocha colored head which is leaving a lot of spotted lacing as well as great alcohol legs. Carbonation is good and coming off the sides of the glass where the body meets the head.  S: Nose is of dark roasted malts, big espresso notes, and some light bitter chocolate. A faint caramel sweetness which a touch of alcohol that ties all these nuances all together nicely. As it warms I'm picking up a very light vanilla note as well.  T: Upfront, big bitter chocolate and espresso notes, then subdued by some malty sweetness. At the end I get the alcohol, but just enough to cleanse my palate and pop my taste buds open. The flavors aren't as big as the nose would lead you to believe, but it also has had 1 yr of cellaring.  M: Full bodied; the mouthfeel is good, very thick and somewhat syrupy, but in a good way.

Sweetness comes to the nose first, then some notes of roasted grain.  Tastes like everything I want from a RIS. It's like you put a good stout in an evaporation chamber and drank the distillate. A small sip fills your mouth with roasted malt flavors.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for a beer so sweet. Makes for a dangerous beer because you drink it and want another. And another is a bad idea, unless you want to be conscious later.  All in all, this is my go-to RIS. I will never judge it for being in a can.

Head dissipated quickly and left some decent lacing.  Aroma is fantastic. Milk chocolate right off the bat, then some coffee, and finally darkly roasted malt on the finish.  Taste is a combination of dark chocolate with a slight coffee hint. I was also caught off guard by the second taste. It reminded me of chocolate covered vanilla cherries...candy that I remember from when I was a kid. I cannot pick up any alcohol flavors, which is impressive for a 10.5 beern.  The mouthfeel is thinner than I expected, but still rich and coats the tongue.  Overall I'm a believer now. This is my first ten fidy, and I'm already thinking about my next trip to the store so I can stock up on more so I don't run out. Great stuff.

2681,34483,Jugs_McGhee,3.54,"330ml can served into Beer Sommelier Antwerp Beer Passion Weekend 2011 20cl stemware in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Recommended to me by Schlimenhaumer. Though I was raised in Denver, I've never tried this brewery before. I've heard great things and am very excited. Reviewed live. Can acquired at Wally's Wine.  A: Pours a two finger head of beautiful dark brown colour, excellent cream, amazing thickness, and incredible retention for the high ABV. Colour is a nontransparent solid black.  Sm: Caramel, wonderful cream lacing, lovely rich chocolate, very light roast, and maybe toffee. A mild to moderate strength aroma.  T: Chocolate, light caramel, very slight roast, and another layer of rich chocolate. It's nicely complex, but may lack the subtlety of other beers in the style. Nicely built and balanced.  Mf: Smooth and wet, but not as thick as expected per the ABV. It suits the flavours but doesn't seem tailored to them. It feels more like a porter than a stout, which I don't think is a good thing. How is this not overcarbonated coming from a can?  Dr: Very drinkable for the high ABV. In particular, I dig the chocolate. It disguises its ABV extraordinarily well. For a beer from a can, I'm very impressed, but it's not without its (minor) flaws.  3.6  *** 01/19/15: Brief further impressions.  Canned 08/26/14. I love the label design. Served chilled into a pilsner glass and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Expectations are high.  No bubble show forms as it's poured.  HEAD: 2 fingers wide. Gorgeous tan colour. Nice thickness and creaminess, with a full consistency. Could be more even and smooth, as well as richer and darker. Leaves a nice coating of lacing on the sides of the glass as it recedes. Retains well - for about 8 minutes.  BODY: Solid opaque jet-black. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.  This is what an imperial stout should look like, but there's room for improvement.  AROMA: Unique in that it evokes wort grains - i.e. the aroma I notice during homebrewing. Unfortunately, though, the aroma overall is quite muted, which is problematic seeing as the aromatic intensity is already below average. Really searching, I find chocolate, roast, dark malts, and a kiss of plum. I love that it features roast - a must in any stout.  No yeast, alcohol, or off-notes are detectable, nor are any hops.  TASTE: I love the roast, but the plum/dark fruit characteristics just don't work well here. The dark and chocolate malt backbone lends it just enough sweetness, and checks the roasty bitterness nicely. More of a burnt, charred, or ashen character would help this flavour profile nicely. It's got fair complexity, but never feels like a gestalt whole, and the balance needs dialing in. As it warms, a pleasant chicory tone emerges.  It could absolutely be deeper and more expressive, but I do like it and can see its appeal. I don't find the coffee noted by other reviewers.  TEXTURE: ""Motor oil"" is hyperbole as a descriptor, but it is thick, yes. It works though because it's not also syrupy or sticky. Full-bodied as hell and weighty on the palate without coming off overbearing or assaulting. Slightly overcarbonated, unrefreshing, smooth, and wet.  Overall presence on the palate is nice. This texture doesn't elevate the beer, but it does suit it nicely.  To my utter disbelief, the 10.50% is nowhere to be noticed.  OVERALL: More roast, please. And more intricacy and/or subtlety. I can see why this is a popular go-to imperial stout; it has a lot of good characteristics. But this style demands that you bring more to the table if you want to run with the big dogs. I'd definitely recommend it alongside other widely available favourites like Old Rasputin, Founders Imperial Stout, or Yeti, but it's far from world class. In any case, it's a shockingly drinkable brew at 10.50% and is one I'll revisit repeatedly so long as it's brewed.  Low B  *** 02.24.15:  Worthy of its mainstay status in many a discerning drinker's fridge, Ten Fidy is a nicely roasty thick-as-hell imperial stout that'll please fans of the style. Still, more roast and less dark fruit, please. Surprisingly drinkable for its high ABV. This'll get you drunk.  I'm still not sure if this would age well. Only one way to find out...

2681,34483,bubseymour,4.33,"Appearance - super black and brown 2 finger head little to no retention or lacing however  Smell - not the most aromatic or complex of RIS styles. Some chocolatey malts but subtle  Taste - Very nice chocolate, malt, coffee notes ans slight smokeiness and actually an easy drinker for 10.5%. Some slight hop crispness in the finish to help balance. Not as complex or smokey as other RIS's I've sampled but still a very nice taste.  Mouthfeel - Not quite as full bodied or buttery as some other RIS's but still very fine.  Overall - A very enjoyable beer and RIS. Not quite world class in my book but I could go back to this one on a cold winter night anytime. Easy to drink as well.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Pine hop bitterness along with more bitter chocolate at finish.  M- Full body. Velvet-like feel, smooth and creamy all at the same time. Alcohol is hidden very well.  O- Amazing beer!

2681,34483,Rschis16,4.38,"As black as oil out of a can, not even light coming through along the edges. One and a half finger creamy beige head on top that sticks around for a bit, then reduces down to a thin swirly sheet. Light patchy lacing. Dark chocolate and dark roasted malts come through on the nose, mocha-like. An element of cream in there as well. Definitely smells very malty.  Big, bold flavors of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee, and booze come out swinging. The booze adds a sweetness that is reminiscent of dark dried fruits, but never even comes close to being cloying as the dark chocolate and malt flavors take hold and don't let go. Very complex in taste, as not one of those four flavors takes complete hold of the beer, but all contribute huge elements into its enjoyment. Bitterness is achieved in the form of coffee and unsweetened chocolate, combined with sweetness from the dark chocolate, malts, and cream tastes. This makes for a well-balanced, albeit extreme, beer. Adding to the complexity is the medium body, despite the sludge look from the can. A bitterness of coffee and a nice tingle of hops linger in the back after the taste.  This is one good beer, and a beer that'll put hair on your chest for sure. I really like the extreme canned beers that Oskar Blues puts out. They seem to avoid any off metallic flavors, and the beer always tastes fresh, as well as always being unique.

S- A hefty amount of roasted malt, caramel, light dark fruit notes, sweet booze and some dark chocolate .  T- Roasted malt again stands out with notes of caramel, brown sugar, fig, cherry, dark chocolate. and sweet booze.  M- Low to medium carbonation and medium body with a roasted and a bitter finish. Alcohol seems to have mellowed out from age, but still warms the throat.  O- I liked it, but wasn't overly impressed by it.

No audible fizz when I popped the can but looks like it has decent carbonation in the glass.  Surprisingly mild aroma, faintly roasty and sweet, kind of chocolatey and malty as well. Very little noticeable booze in the nose.  Thank god for the flavor though. It's big and heavy duty. Lots of bitter chocolate. Modest hop bitterness (98 IBU?) is overwhelmed by tons of roasted malty goodness. Minor fruit notes of prunes, raisins, dates and the like. Molasses and fresh black coffee. caramel. Extremely rich but not overly sweet, really quite delicious. The finish is long and complex. Modestly boozy for such a high powered beer. More flavors become noticeable as this warms, including anise/black licorice, char, and dare I say it, leather?  Mouthfeel is incredibly sticky and viscous, with low carbonation. Cloys a bit as it coats the mouth heavily. Certainly makes an impression in this respect.  I really dig this one. It's powerful in flavor with a mouthfeel I won't soon forget.

It finally picks up here. Rich dark chocolate and milky caramel overcome the palate. Hops are present but very subdued. Its nice and smooth from here on out.  D: As long as you hold your nose, this has great drinkability. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy...nice.  Overall: This beer did not start out good, but it really picked up and became a damned tasty beer.

2681,34483,CraftBeerTastic,4.13,"Ba Review #76 Served On: 10/10/2011 Glassware: Snifter Labeled ABV: 10.5% Date/ Code: Sept 2011  I was fortunate enough to find a 4-pack the other day at Ye Old Spirits Shop in Frederick, MD while on my lunch break. I've been searching for this one for a while now.  Look: Pitch black with a rich 1-finger mocha colored head. I’m already impressed with this much head on a 10.5% ABV Russian Imperial.  Smell: The nose had a very heavy stout character with deep roasted malts and a pungent bitter sweet chocolate.  Taste: Where to begin with one! First was a deep roasted malt character that was almost smoky. The middle was a semisweet chocolate followed by dark caramelized fruits. The finish was full of bitterness and spices – probably from the higher IBU’s of this stout. The alcohol warmth appeared towards the end of the finish. Mouth feel was fairly heavy, but not a full as I was expecting.  I loved this beer. Even though I’m probably conforming with the status quo, I can certainly see firsthand why this beer gets exceptional ratings.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,rudzud,3.12,"Picked up a can of this at Julio's.  A - Poured into a Duvel tulip a super deep oil slick black. There was a slight half finger head that fades quickly to leave no side lacing and a barely there halo.  S - Shockingly average here. While the ABV is incredibly hidden, I cant look past how this is almost devoid of aroma. Not getting any chocolate or coffee or malts or anythign really. Almost a slight metallic aroma.  T - Similar to the nose in that its well, fairly average. Yes, the alcohol is hidden masterfully, but I really dont have much in the way of flavor. There is some light chocolate and roasted qualities but considering how big this beer is I expected it to be much more flavorful.  M - Excellent mouthfeel though on this beer. Drinks like its a 5-6%. Easily the best part of the beer, nice and smooth, ridiculouslly drinkable.  O - Overall, I feel like this beer SHOULD have been incredible. Instead, its almost a mess for me. I dont know if it was just a bad batch, or not handled propperly, but this was incredibly dissappointing. No where near worth the $5+ I paid for the can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,JonathanG,4.33,"2011 Batch. Can poured into a Duvel glass.  A: I'd have to agree that this looks like used motor oil coming out of the can, both in color and viscosity. The minimal head that quickly fades even looks like the tannish-brown color of motor oil when you change your vehicle's oil. Light lacing, but nothing substantial, nor does it stick around.  S: All sorts of dark roasted malt notes, French Roast coffee, a bit of chocolate, and some fruity esters of red plum and a little berry-laced prune. Interesting and a little hard to nail down the fruit here. Faintly smoky. Definitely better once it warms up. Also a hint of burnt brown sugar (not caramel).  T: More or less mimics the nose. Not dry, but certainly not sweet for a RIS.  M: Medium-viscosity. Again, certainly not light, but not the uber-richness sometimes associated with RIS.  I think I may save at least one can and see how it is down the road.  This is definitely better as it warms up a bit, maybe in the 55-60-degree range.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,zachary80,4.28,"Poured from a can into a New Belgium globe. Canned on 9/19/11  Black when pouring, impenetrably so in the glass. Small brown head fades, leaving just a few bubbles on top. Where is the lacing?  Malt, lots of roastiness that lends an almost smokey quality to the beer. Also get a slight fruity hint along with some alcohol vapors.  Flavor is somewhat minimal up-front with a robust flavor and strong finish, characteristic of a RIS. More on the dry side, but not totally. Pretty hard to me to describe for some reason. Definitely some chocolate to it, lots of influence from the dark malts. Delicious but not groundbreaking  Mouthfeel is thick, but not as much as expected from the pour and appearance. Does coat the mouth pleasantly. Don't feel the alcohol.  Overall it reminds me of a good example of a big RIS - like a more flavorful Old Rasputin is the best way I can describe it.

Taste: Intensely sweet flavor with tons of chocolate maltiness and a hint of roasted malts and coffee flavors. The finish is pretty boozy and a little fruity with hints of brandy-like flavor.

While pouring I wondered if I had not on accident opened a can of motoroil. It's thick, black no head to speak of and no visible carbonation. I bet this could keep my car greased up.  Something so thick got one thinking about how this could smell. Roasted malts, coffee and chocolate that ranges from bitter to sweet.  Decided to drink it since I just had an oil change for the car. Again the same roasted malts are present. There is a hint of smoke and some sweetness.  It comes with a fairly thick body. Not quite chewable but not far from it. The 10.5% alcohol is hidden well and I love how the flavors linger after the swallow.  Man, this a great tasty stout. Flavors are bold, the mouthfeel is thick and the look is good.

A small one finger light brown head that lasts a good while.  S: Dark roasty burnt smells of expresso, coffee and burnt chocolate. No hops or minimal hops detected on the nose.  T: Wow, flavors of roasted coffee beans with expresso and burnt coffee, roasted malt and tar. I really get a lot of burnt flavors. I hardly get any hints of hops and the finish was a bitter metallic type flavor that was unpleasant. It did open a bit when it warmed and the bitterness subsided, but still.  M: Heavy, the alcohol coats the mouth and leaves an aftertaste that I said to me was unpleasant.  D: Low for me. I just didn't care for this beer. In fact, I was glad to see the bottom of the glass.  Overall I don't get what the hype is on this beer. In my eyes there are much better impy stouts and this to me tasted like a canned beer. As I said it carried a real metallic type flavor on the finish that totally turned me off. With the hype, I might have to try another to see if I got a bad batch. Sorry guys.  ***Update 9/29/11***  Updating my review. I enjoyed an aged can last night of Ten Fidy. It was probably 2 years old or so and I really enjoyed it.  A: Upped score. Jet black and engine oil thick. Not much head, but a slightly reddish brown head did show.  S: Upped score. Loads of chocolate and roasted malt. I could smell the sweetness too.  T: Upped score. Ok, sweetness come out first with heavy chocolate, some coffee, caramel sweetness and roasted malt. Much more smooth and integrated. Finish is smooth and sweet but enjoyable.  M: Full, coating, sweet, not a ton of alcohol. Nice.  O: Upped score. I enjoyed this much more this time, plus the aging must have helped it out.

The smell wasnt as bold as i was expecting, going by the reviews i was expecting a more pronounced nose. The taste was good with dark choclate roasted malt carmel and coffee coming through. My can had little to no carbonation but a very smooth mouthfeel. i was surpised also to see that this was a 10.5%er because i dont taste the booziness at all. Overall I would have to say that although this beer was good i was hoping for more. It had the feeling of a highly hyped pay per view event that ended in the first ten seconds. Leaving you with the sense of "" i paid how much for that!"" Im not saying that i dont like this beer i do, maybe it was my can, maybe it was my mind hyping this beyond what it could produce.

The taste isn't complete I want more but it could be my mood the flavor is there and my wife loved it. The taste is smoke and not artificial. A smooth malt and sweet choc and almost cherry comes in.

S - Leather, soy sauce, alcohol, roasted and toasted malts, dark roasted coffee, cherries, plums, raisins, tar, gasoline, charcoal, cassis.  T - Roasty, dark caramel, coffee, milk and bittersweet chocolates level out to even more coffee with a hint of honey and almonds. The finish is sweet with lingering toffee and plum flavors mellowed out by a candi sugar essence. Cassis and cherry give way to an almost smoky, woody essence which leads the palate to a slight bitterness that rests firmly but lightly over the roasted malts. Alcohol is present and gives a slick sweetness but is not overwhelming.  M - Slightly sticky with a decent carbonation for the style.

From can into a snifter glass. About 45-50 degrees F.  A- I really had to pour it down the center to get any kind of head formation from it, but all in there after a quick pour I got maybe a finger and a half of really, really, really tan head. Of course, pitch black as expected....sweet. moving on  S- I used to live in a town with a chocolate making factory in it, and there was always a smell of sweet cocoa in the air within a mile around it...this reminds me exactly of that. smells like dark chocolate, a little floral hops, a little brandy-esque (almost like port wine) really not getting too much coffee, but for me that smell is in more dry stouts.  T- This is like I took a dark chocolate bar and melted it, or hot cocoa with triple the amount of powder in it (but cold). I can almost chew this beer (well not really, but its thick) simply delicious. Im getting literally little to no alcohol, even in the aftertaste, very well done being a 10+abv brew.

A vigorous pour yields a slow-forming 1/2-finger mocha-colored head that dissipates to a minute dusting and thin foam ring in just under a couple minutes. The body is a bold ebony with no traces of color when held to light. Thin lacing can be seen clinging to a good bit of the glass throughout consumption.  Dark malts give a strong, bold nose. Bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee beans, toffee, and licorice. There is also both a smoky and slight alcohol quality to the nose.

An overlying alcohol flavor is also noticeable throughout the entire taste but comes to rest in the back of the throat at the end.  Full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is definitely a sipper. The body is full and robust, allowing your taste buds to experience every nuance this beer has to offer. The carbonation is only slightly noticeable, does not interfere with the flavors, and helps to keep this beer from becoming a syrupy mess. It coats your mouth well and is rather sticky but the mouthfeel is still smooth overall.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Scent is of burned but not to much chocolate chip cookies. Maybe some ripened dark brandy soaked fruit. Taste is wow!

2681,34483,mdvatab,4.38,"Poured from 12oz can into snifter. Courtesy of Barfwin on bottling day.  Aroma: Soft, black olive note. (I know, sounds unusual...) Vanilla + toasted malt + molasses.  Appearance: Pitch black opaque body with dark tan foam. 1/2 finger head settles to a thin film.  Flavor: Dark/sweet roasted malt, smooth chocolate sweetness, well-balanced bitterness, followed by a soft finish. Some minerally bitterness appears at the end. The alcohol is slightly evident, but generally well-concealed.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium-full body. Slightly warming in the mouth, and on the tongue.  Overall: Gotta love an imperial stout from a can! Especially when it's aged in that can for 1+ year. Nothing bad to say about this beer. Actually--on a good note, it was fantastice! Would be intersted in trying a fresh one of these next to one that has 1+ year of age on it. Highly recommended!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Little head, quickly retreats for the glass.  S: Booze, thick sweetness, chocolate, dates, an element akin to a boozier smelling BSDA, beer bread  T: Clean, mild chocolate. Less booze here vs. the nose. The taste ride is very short and ""sweet"". No hops, finishes with a mild residue of something like maple syrup and cereal that puckers the tongue slightly. Rich sweetness throughout. Very interesting and very good.  M: Thin and smooth. Very even. Very low carbonation, which contributes to the silkiness. Tiny bit cloying.

S: A nice roasted malt profile initially mix with semi-sweet chocolate notes. A nice leather presence in the back.  T: Heavy roasted notes. Both sweet and bitter at the same time. Chocolate and some mild licorice. Alcohol was present as a warming presence in the finish.  M: Good creamy mouth feel. Seemed a little thin as far as imperial stouts go but did not affect the flavor or the quality of the beer.  O: A great beer. A good balance between sweetness and bitterness.

T: A very smoky coffee flavor with hints of chocolate and caramel. This is a very, very tasty beer.  M: More carbonate than you might expect, but still on the oily and smooth side. This is a pleasant and not too heavy beer considering its density and ABV.  O: Oskar Blues is in the business of brewing classic beers. This is certainly one of them. One of the best, widely available stouts you can find anytime.  EDIT for an aged beer:  Just cracked a two year old (almost to the day) can that had been sitting at a consistent 60 degrees in a pitch black storage area. All of the coffee flavor and aroma was still there, but it had mellowed. The aroma improved a lot, with some wonderful chocolate smells coming through along with a bit of vanilla and caramel.  The taste had some more of the same character changes as the smell, but it was ultimately a bit thinner (but probably smoother as well). Oddly enough, the 98 IBUs seemed to come through a little stronger two years later than with a fresh one.  Ultimately, I'd say this is worth aging, as I can imagine now that it has mellowed a bit it may become a more accessible beer. Also, the aroma really is quite improved. That said, for my tastes, two years may have been two long. I would like to try aging one for just a year.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A little boozy with some dark fruit notes.  T: Bitter chocolate and burnt coffee with a warm alcohol bite. As this warms, it seems to all smooth out and become a complex mix of chocolate, coffee, and some tart sweetness.  M: Thick and smooth with a slight booze burn. The carbonation fizz tickles the tongue and helps clear the palate.  O: Out of the cooler, I was not all that impressed with this, but, as it warmed, the character of this beer came out. I will let the next can warm a bit before drinking... overall a very nice RIS.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

I'm glad I have 3 more cans left behind it.  This pours a nice oily black color with but a sliver of a head. The aromatics on this stout are marvelous. This is a chocolate bomb beneath the nose. This tastes incredible. Chocolate, malt, and vanilla come together with so many other lovely flavors. This is dessert in a glass. The mouth feel is smooth and creamy. It coats your tongue and the walls of your mouth in all kinds of goodness. The can looks so bad ass and ominous, yet what's inside is so subtle and nuanced, it's really a lamb in a lion's suit. I used to have a stigma against canned beer. Lately, I'm having some of my best beer other in a can, and wishing more brewers would embrace the storage format. I'm going to need more of this.

Almost no carbonation, very thick and full mouthfeel. Creamy and smooth. A sipper despite the smoothness. This is almost over the top for me. I like it, but even a 12 ounce can is almost too much. It's just SO heavy. I find more drinkability in WWS than this. If ever I was curious as to what the inside of a black hole tasted like, this would be it. Very glad I got to try this.

2681,34483,DelMontiac,4.55,"While I was in Colorado on (a much needed) vacation, I was bummed to find out that Oskar Blues doesn't serve Ten Fidy at their establishments until fall. Good news was...the liquor stores had plenty.  Poured from a black and silver 12oz can in to a plain jane pint glass, Ten Fidy is as black as you're gonna find out there. An inch of caramel-colored foam caps it off. Lace is there if you drink fast enough, otherwise it's gonna retract into spider veins.  Aromas are sweet sugary dark malts, simmered dark fuits (plums, raisons, figs), esspresso, dark chocolate mousse, burnt toast, merlot, and a bit of smokeiness. How's that for temptation?  Flavors are exceptional - burnt moleasses, robust coffee, milk chocolates, vanilla bean, sweet pipe tobacco, black licorice, and grassy hops. Alcohol will peek out when at room temp which I feel is best. Think of a place somewhere between Old Rasputin and KBS. Yeah, it kills.  I don't think I've had a beer that compares in this feel - super full body, sticky, whole cream smooth, and dry. Pretty unique.  This is sold in four pack cans which is damn genius. Selling it in six pack cans would be stellar. This is something to add to your wants list if you ain't had it yet.

2681,34483,jtingue,4.92,"Poured into a snifter. Dated 2011 Batch 1.  Appearance. Pours a very viscous deep reddish brown. A finger of mocha brown head dissipates to a ring of bubbles around the ring of the glass within a few minutes. One thing I love about the appearance of this beer is the deep red tint on the edges when held up to the light.  Smell. Roastiness hits the nose right away and is almost overcoming. Sweet molasses and vanilla follow. Alcohol is definitely present.  Taste. Very thick malt sweetness right up front. Hop or dark chocolate bitterness starts the forthcoming sequence of nuanced complex flavors. This bitterness slowly transitions into a sweet molasses and dark fruit flavor. A more roasty, coffee like bitterness returns and lingers for a while. The finish is slightly dry, but still bittersweet. The roasted malty sweetness lingers until you take the next sip. Surprisingly the alcohol strength is almost nonexistent for such a strong beer.  Mouthfeel. This is probably the thickest, most viscous beer I have ever had. It completely coats every part of your mouth with its wonderful flavor. carbonation is fairly light, but adequate for this type of beer.  Probably my favorite imperial stout. So much complexity here to entertain the palate for the entire can of beer. If this beer weren't so available it would be considered on par with Dark Lord and other ""famous"" imperial stouts (in my opinion)",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Deep dark roasted malt character, bitter dark chocolate and more than just hints of espresso beans. Maybe the faintest of hop suggestions as well...booze? Very faint.  T: Rich, roasted malt profile. Good emphasis of chocolate and roasted malts, with a touch of smoke and some alcohol heat.  MF: Creamy, rich, soft, full bodied beer with light carbonation; a soft dryness finishes the mouthfeel.

(I later learned it was money well spent)  Poured from a 12-oz can into a New Castle Brown Ale schooner glass. I'm very excited about this beer after reading all of the hype on Beer Advocate and other informative beer tasting sites.  Appearance: Pours with intense pure absence of color darkness. I was barely able to get any head, which was portrayed by a dark caramel ring that quickly dissipated. Lacing is non existent but you can clearly see the beer thickness trying to hold onto the side of the glass with each sip.  Smell: Initial sightly boozy sweetness followed by dark chocolate and expresso coffee. I also sense some burnt molasses and roasted oats at the end of my inhale. Swirling the glass around after the beer warms a few minutes really brings out the full aroma nuances.  Taste: Bittersweet chocolate, black coffee, roasted oats all in one shot. Wow, this is outstanding. I was expecting it to be too sweet, but its perfect in every way. Slight hop bitterness with the roasted oats and vanilla really shining through in the finish. The alcohol is well hidden and gently warms the throat on the way down. The booziness is more prevalent as this beer warmed.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation was lively enough to spread the intense flavors all over my tongue. Creamy thick, well-balanced goodness...  Overall: Without a doubt this beer lives up to the hype. Who knew something so delectable could come from a can. I tip my hat to Oskar Blues because they sure have a winner RIS here. This is a ""must try"" for RIS fans.

2681,34483,AmericanGothic,4.47,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a Sam Adams pint.  A: Pours and opaque dark brown with one half finger of fairly dark brown head. Some retention and lace.  S: Wonderfully balanced chocolate and coffee, fair amount of sweetness. This promises to be good....  T: Chocolate cream up front, slowly turns bitter through the middle and slides into mocha molasses at the end. Quite bitter overall, but not unbalanced. Very tasty. Alcohol is present but also not unbalanced.  M: Fairly heavy but silky smooth and creamy. Quite good.  O: Was expecting something good, and not disappointed at all. If this were available in Iowa, I'd be getting it frequently. Meanwhile, I'll look forward to the next trip to a state where I can purchase. A really fine brew, get it and enjoy.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S: Lots of dark chocolate with a little soy sauce. Black strap molasses and licorice. Dried cherry and date. Mild earthiness.   T: Dark chocolate with soy sauce and tobacco. Lots of dried date and plum. Earthy hops. The roastiness seems to have faded a bit.  M: Full in body with moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is sticky and chewy.

Chocolate flavor is up front then comes the Hop punch followed by a roasted almost burnt taste and ends chocolately  M-Full bodied. with decent carbonation  D-Overall this is a wonderful Russian imperial stout. Don't think i could drink more than one in a sitting. it really is a kick in the face. I love this brew and will get again and again.

2681,34483,leschkie,4.17,"12 oz. can courtesy of rmalinowski4. Thanks Rich for this little treat! Poured into a tulip.  Appearance: Pours a viscous and opaque mocha with a very thin 1/4 inch cocoa-colored head that completely dissipated before I was even able to finish pouring the contents into my glass. No lacing whatsoever and zero light transmission through this monster. The long-lost cousin to motor oil, that’s for damn sure.  Smell: Lovely aromas coming from this one. Mixture of Dark and milk chocolate, roasted black coffee, vanilla, and molasses. Flavor profile is well-balanced and in full force from start to finish.  Taste: Delicious! Intense chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and molasses from the moment this beer touches my tongue. Bitterness from the coffee remains at the back of the throat after the swallow. I do wish the other flavors stuck around awhile longer than they did. Coffee gains in strength as this one warms.  Mouthfeel: As heavy as they come. Thick, chewy, and syrupy with essentially no carbination...as if it needed it anyway. Slight warming from the alcohol that also becomes exacerbated with increasing temperature.  Overall: Based on appearance and smell, I originally thought that I needed to set aside an hour or so to tackle this one, but it is actually very drinkable. Only downfall is the slight inconsistency in the flavor profile from start to finish. A superb example of the style. Damn, I wish I had more. Looks like I have a new ISO to post.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Sensaray,4.25,"With very aggressive pour got a whopping 1/4"" brown head. Pours deep dark brown almost black motor oil style.  Huge roasted notes were released on the pour. Upon closer inspection, some vanilla coffee sweet notes then also chocolate some nuttiness. Sense of hops. The can smells like strong alcohol and coffee.  The first thing I noticed was a chocolate flavor that kind of developed more intensity through my sip. Blended well wtih a hoppy flavor and bitterness, and some coffee. Bit of pine resin to the bitterness.  The mouthfeel was lightly creamy with little carbonation. Warming alcohol.  This was a delicious sipper. Nice and complex.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BeerisfoodLLC,4.3,"Love this brewery and this beer is typical of what they do. Poured from a can to a goblet:  A - Dark black in color, little to no head  S - Roasty, chocolate, boozy scents  T - Complex tastes. Roasty malts, chocolate, raisin type taste as well? Hop bitterness is there as well with a boozy finish to warn you up!  M - Heavy bodied, light carbonation.  This is right up there with many of the best imperial stouts I have had.

I can't make out the carbonation level to the the darkness of the beer and there is some excellent lacing. The head lasted for around 5 minutes before it was gone.  Smell - Malts, coffee, chocolate, smoke, vanilla  Taste & Mouth - There is a slightly below average amount of carbonation and the beer feels very syrupy on the tongue. I can taste malts, chocolate and coffee. There is also a smokiness and a some vanilla and some light hops. I can taste the alcohol but it doesn't come across as harsh. The beer finishes with chocolaty bittersweet aftertaste.  Overall – I've yet to see a beer that looked so syrupy while being poured. The appearance really does look like motor oil. The taste is well balanced and it would make a great winter warmer beer or after dinner drink. I'd buy it again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MassDriver,4.66,"12oz can poured into my Old Rasputin pint glass.  Appearance: Pour yielded about three fingers of a mocha colored head, very vigorous pour. Black as the devils heart, can kind of see a ruby tint in very bright sunlight but only at the edges. Poured like viscous oil.  Smell: Big coffee aromas with dark chocolate in the background, roasted scent in there too.  Taste: Just about follows the smell of the beer. Lots of coffee and chocolate but backed up with a nice bitterness in the finish to even the brew out.  Mouthfeel: Nice think mouthfeel here, also very smooth.  Overall: Fantastic brew! Everything melded nicely and the alcohol provides a nice little warming touch at the end. I could drink this everyday and never get tired of the complexities.

2681,34483,VelvetExtract,3.86,"A-All in all, this beer looks nearly perfect. The beer pours akin to oil. No highlights. The head is the most exciting part. The color of the head was a brilliant toasty brown with a nearly orange undertone. Thick, patchy lace leaves islands along the glass.  S-Great roasty, coffee RIS scent. Bitter dark chocolate in the nose as well. Faint hops in the aroma (the beer has been hanging around since the winter). Alcohol twang rounds out the aroma. An attractive scent, just how a big-time RIS should smell.  T-The roasted coffee bean flavor lasts for a ridiculous amount of time on the palate. The dark chocolate is bittersweet. The hops are still there, and I notice them more and more. The alcohol bite is evident too. Looks, smells, tastes big.  M-Perhaps my favorite part of the beer. Viscous, sludgy, creamy, and slick. Pretty swell carbonation as well. More bubbly than expected.  O/D-This one is great. I would not put this in the upper echelon of my top big stouts. Perhaps the alcohol is a bit too aggressive on the tongue. Nonetheless, this is beer is big and bold. Tastes great to boot. Finally knocked this one off the list.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,keithmurray,4.28,"Appearance - pours a jet black color with ever so slight tan head  smell - dark chocolate and coffee is what i pick up, not as fragrant as other RIS's I have tried  taste - this is a lot better than the smell - dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, espresso, hint of vanilla  mouthfeel - low carbonation, big bodied, smooth, good balance to this, slightly sweet at the start, then there is the right amount of bitterness to follow that, I can't even detect any booze and this is coming in at over 10%abv  overall - kinda pricey (bought a single of this for $4.50, the 4pk was $16), but if you like RIS's, then this is a must try. Really good example of the style and comes in a can to boot! I'm usually skeptical of beers that get a lot of hype but this one lives up to expectation.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,DavidST,4.23,"I'm completely sure this is the first imperial stout I've had out of a can. I poured into a snifter glass. It has a nice dark black color with a minimal dark brown head which quickly goes away. The smell is nice of dark chocolate and dark roasted malts, a few swirls and I can also smell the alcohol. The mouthfeel is very thick with little carbonation what I'd expect with a RIS, pretty much perfect (this may just have the best mouth feel of any beer I've ever had). The taste was pretty good, not quite as strong as I expected, its malty with a little alcohol burn on the way down with some chocolate aftertaste, for the way it looks this is pretty smooth. Overall this was good but not my favorite stout (I like a little more lingering bitterness), I found it for $12 for a four pack so its a decent deal.  ---  After letting this warm up a bit to almost room temperature, the taste is a little stronger and even better. I've had better RIS but this one is definitively worth trying, its thick and has no discernible can (metallic) taste.  ---  I've had another can of this, and its even better, this is a beautiful imperial stout and I'll be sure to have cans of this sitting around the house.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,b3shine,4.47,"Can to pint. IT'S ALL GOOD! Appearance was good, but nothing special. No head to speak of. Can is still a turnoff too (I can't lie.).

A must-try!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,thegodfather1076,4.42,"This beer was served out of a 12oz. can dispensed into a glass....  Presentation - Simple but cool can.  Appearance - Poured a thick syrupy dark brown or black. A very thin brown foam head that dissipated to nothing very quickly. I repoured this from one glass to another very aggressivley and was able to get a nice 1 1/2 finger brown foam head that left a nice lacing on the glass.  Smell - Smells very smokey with hints of roasted coffe, toffee, and caramel. Also slight hints of dark fruits(figs, raisins, etc...).  Taste - Tastes of smokey roast coffee and molasses with hints of the same dark fruits that are in the aroma. The alcohol content while hight and very prevelent blends nicely with the flavors.  Mouthfeel - Very thick, full bodied, and creamy. Very little carbonation.  Drinkability - Very drinkable in small quantities. As a nice flavor and smell.  This beer was very good but it is very potent. I could only see myself drinking one or two at the most because of how heavy it is and because of the alcohol content. I would highly recommend trying this one!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S - Dark dark chocolate, roasted malt, and some coffee. Really amazing.  T - Deep roasted malt characteristics with a TON of chocolate flavor. A bit of coffee bitterness as well. Delicious. Only outside hints of alcohol, nothing that would suggest the 10.5% ABV of the beer.  M - Full body with a nice clean finish. A bit sticky. Coats the mouth well and leaves you satisifed.  O - Really quite brilliant. The best canned imperial stout in the world! It holds its own against the greats of the category. While it'll never be Hunahpu or any of the other titans, it is definitely on the short list for best widely-available stout. If the price came down a bit, it'd be a big competitor for Old Raspy. At around 6.00 a can in NY, it's stupid expensive.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jamescain,4.47,"Poured a 2009 vintage into a Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours thick like motor oil and black as night with minimal head. The head is tan and only about a centimeter thick that fades into a ring around the side of the glass.  Aroma: Rich chocolate and coffee notes dominate with hints of vanilla and toffee.  Taste: Chocolate and subtle coffee notes with burnt grains rounding the edges. It has a sweet finish that reminds you of more chocolate.  Mouthfeel: It has a really thick mouthfeel, thick and creamy with a slight alcohol burn and a sweet finish.  Overall: This is a very good imperial stout and a good beer to give to people who swear by bottles and their seniority to cans. It’s everything I look for and like in a big stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Knapp85,4.35,"I had seen an article about this beer in a magazine a few weeks before I saw some at my local shop. The magazine was really talking it up so I had to give it a try. This beer pours out as black as a moonless night in an abandand coal mine. The thick black liquid chugs it's way out of the can as a dark brown head forms on top. The smell of the beer is very roasted and has just a touch of dark berry and hop aroma mix with a ton of molasses. The taste of the beer is very rich, it's deeply roasted with a subtle sweetness up front that fades into a burnt bitterness in the end. The taste in the middle is kind of earthy. The mouthfeel is very thick indeed. Overall it's a really damn good Russian Imperial Stout. really worth looking into.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,azdback,4.53,"Poured into my Stone Imperial glass. Deep dark black. There are no highlights to this, just black from one edge of the glass to the other. Head is huge and about three fingers. Dark brown in color and velvety in texture. The lace sticks in a spotted pattern and is the darkest I have ever seen. What all Russian Imperials should be graded on.  Smell is fantastic!! Dark roasted malts. Black roasted coffee beans, some sweet chocolate is there and maybe even some vanilla bean is present. I don't detect any alcohol or booze.  Taste mostly sweet like blackstrap molasses. Very sweet!! There are some roasted coffee tastes that come to play but all very sweet. Like an iced coffee delight from your local coffee shop. Late in the taste comes the 10.5% ABV. Not at all un-welcomed though. The alcohol is nice and definitely expected for this one.  Mouth is as expected for such a heavy hitter. The body is rich and smooth, silky even. To the end this one is not a bit hollow and never disappoints!! The alcohol warmth down in the throat is very nice and welcomed.  Overall.. This Russian Imperial is one of the few that all should be graded on. It's availability and reasonable cost should also play into it's overall score (IMO). I haven't even mentioned that it's out of a can!! WOW!! My advice to all you campers and hikers is, remember this one on your next outing and remember, ""pack it in, pack it out"".",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A good bit of dark fruit, anise, and molasses. Then charred dark grain bitterness takes over. Finishes with alcohol heat, mild bitterness, and residual chocolate sweetness.  Mouthfeel is Full bodied, smooth and slick.  Overall a drinkable RIS that is a bit on the sweet side. Alcohol and chocolate really come on strong.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bashiba,3.84,"Poured super black with a light yet sticky tan head.  The nose is suprisingly light for a big stout with hints of chocolate and dark malt.  The taste is pretty solid, big burnt black and smokey malt flavor with a light bit of chocolaty sweetness quickly turning to a strong bitter and herbal finish with a touch of anise.  The mouthfeel is thick and chewy with a ton of oily hop resin coating my tongue.  A pretty solid Russian Imperial with its only real weak spot in the nose.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Alpar,3.38,"A: Very dark (like the name implies). The pour gave a 1.5 fingers worth of brown head and not much retention after a minute.  S: A little bit of alcohol, chocolate/malt maybe some leather in there too but nothing else that I am detecting.  T: Hmm this is not what I was expecting at all. Its malty and strong and that's about it. Even as it warmed I didn't pick up much more...  M: Very thick and an ok carbonation level.  O: This is a good beer but I am not seeing what is so spectacular here. I definitely wouldn't pay the $15 dollar price tag for a 4-pk, but not a bad stout overall.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Head is very minimal almost none and is a mocha color which disperses quickly.  S- The aroma is sweet, roasty, chocolate, with some mild vanilla hints. Also picking up on some coffee notes.  T- Huge coffee and chocolate flavors. The alcohol hits at the very end of the sip. Lots of roasted flavors from the malts as well  M- Full bodied and thick...very smooth on the palate. There is some carbonation but not overwhelming.  O- Excellent beer. A great purchase for a RIS lover! Fits to the category well and does not disappoint.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SkunkWorks,4.05,"12 oz can poured into a snifter.  Look: black, oily body with a thick, dark foamy head. The head doesn't retain for longer than a few seconds and doesn't leave lacing. Good looking beer.  Smell: fudgy chocolate, coffee beans, caramel and a bit of hoppiness there as well. Good.  Taste: follows the nose with a big chocolate fudge taste, some coffee, roasted malt, sweet without being cloying. Once it reaches room temperature, the alcohol becomes apparent. Good.  Feel: full bodied, nice carbonation, silky, and the alcohol isn't noticeable until its room temperature and then there's a bit of an alcohol bite in the finish. Very good.  Overall: quite a good Russian Imperial Stout. The fact that its in a can is definitely interesting. That said, its a little overhyped on this site. It doesn't measure up to other easily accessible and more affordable IRS's like Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout or Old Rasputin. Still, if you're a stout lover like me, I would give it a go.

2681,34483,JoEBoBpr,4.15,Poured into a tulip from a 12oz can.  A - Pours out an oily dark pitch black color. No light goes through and not even through the edges. A thin head forms with the pours. After a swirl there is a nice thin 0.25 inch dark tan nearly brown head that is dense but recedes quickly.  S - Sweet chocolate hints as well as some slight burnt and melted caramel. Nice brown sugar and some mild cinnamon to the nose as well. There is some slight coconut hints in the nose as well as some nice powdery chocolate. Some dates are present also.  T & M - Starts off with some mild sweetness followed by some stronger bitter chocolate. After an intense bitter note there is some more of the chocolate powdery sweetness as well as some slight licorice and some dark fruit sweetness. Brunt caramel and roasted malt notes follow. There is a nice bitter finish with some slight hop notes in the back mixed in with the burnt notes to finish of with a dry yet slightly sticky note.  O - Pretty good RIS. Not my favorite and I don't really see the hype even though it is quite delicious.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Penguin3200,3.83,Poured into a pint mug. Deep dark oilcan of a stout. Nose of burnt caramel dark fruit and cedar.  Taste is dark and burnt. Burnt BBQ and roasted chocolate on the pallate.

S- Dark roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, sweet dark fruits-cherries, plums, raisins, bit of an alcoholic sting as well.  T- Bittersweet chocolate, roasted malts, dark cherries, plums. Finish lets you know that this is a big beer.  M- Thick as stouts come. Incredibly creamy and viscous.  O- So glad I finally got some of this and that it lived up to my expectations.

The aroma is heavy with lots of sweet fruits like black cherries and plums. There are also hints of chocolate and roasted malt. The brew has a deep roasted character,there a flavors of coffee grinds and expresso with a slight bitterness that gives way a little malty sweetness and dark chocolate on the finish .This beer is well balanced,no flavor really overpowers the rest.

2681,34483,zeledonia,4.52,"Canned 11 November 2010.  Pours thick and black, like motor oil from a can, with a half-finger of dense dark brown head that has good retention but not much lacing. This is one of the darkest, thickest-looking beers I've ever seen.  Smell is dominated by delicious dark sweet chocolate malts. A bit of sweet caramel in there as well, and some booze. No doubt that this is a strong beer. The smell is quite full and really, really inviting. I really can't come up with a downside. The only reason it's not a 5 for me is it doesn't quite have enough going on to warrant that.  Dang, that's tasty. Bittersweet chocolate, plums, a bit of rum. Heavy dark malts, sugary and alcoholic, with loads of good flavors built on top of that base. I'd say this is about as good as you can get with an imperial stout without any tricks (added flavorings or barrel aging).  Thick and chewy, but more like a milkshake than the syrup that so many big stouts are. Carbonation is fairly low, but the beer has so much body that I don't mind. It has that fluffy feeling that oats usually bring. It lingers in the mouth well, but despite the heaviness, it's not sticky or filmy.  I'm really impressed by this beer. I'd say it's the best year-round imperial stout I've had. No gimmicks, just a really good, solid, tasty beer. And the mouthfeel is amazing. Sure to become a staple.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ExtraStout,5,"Had this on tap and in the can at the Distillery in Sav. GA. Both were equally great.  Ten Fidy pours jet black with a coca colored head. Aroma is full of Roast, Coca, and Dark Fruit, Flavor washes your senses with roast, coffee, rasins and prunes. The alcohol is present as it is in all my favorite imperial stouts, but it is not obtrusive, subtle actually when you consider that it is 10% ABV. Superbly drinkable this beer could get you into trouble if you are not paying attention.  Comparing this beer to others in the style I have to put it at the top, de-throning others such as Avery's Czar, Bell's Expedition, and Old Rasputin. Even the perennial #2 beer can take some lessons away from Ten Fidy.  I don't want to rate this beer perfect, but I can't mark it down in any of the categories in good conscience. At $8 for 12 ounces that is a bit steep, but I'll gladly pay for a couple of snifters full to revisit this gem every winter.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ddahlen,4.22,"Poured out of a 12oz can into a Duvel snifter with no head at all. On the nose I get a ton of chocolate and some dried fruit, maybe a little prune. Upon first sip I'm hit with loads of smooth bitter chocolate and a nice malt sweetness. I'm left with a really nice lingering aftertaste. The alcohol doesnt seem to come through at all on this brew, and at 10.5 percent, that's saying something. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous, but the carbonation is lacking a bit. I don't expect a huge head for this style of brew, but this was a bit unexpected. In the end, the lack of carbonation on the brew really doesn't turn me off all that much, it's still a fantastic Imperial Stout. And, with the expansion of canned craft beer, I'm definitely excited to see more great brews like this one from Oskar Blues.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,deleted_user_574223,4.08,"I poured my Ten Fidy from a 12 oz can into an over sized snifter at a warmer then normal 59 degrees. It poured a nice thick syrupy black with a nice cocoa colored head that lingered for a bit. The cling to the side of the glass as I move it about is quite substantial.  The nose is of cocoa, dark plump raisins, and espresso. After nosing it again having poured the remainder of the can in I picked up a very subtle floral note.  The taste is malty and sweet with chocolate the overall winner in flavor. It finishes with a nice espresso type bitterness.  The mouthfeel is very rich and chewy yet very smooth. The carbonation is exactly what I look for in an Imperial Stout. The alcohol is not overpowering by any means and makes this one dangerous brew.  I was hesitant to purchase a 4 pack of cans for fear of that tinny taste but this brew certainly withstands it and delivers very nicely. I would certainly recommend this to anyone Russian Imperial Stout fan or otherwise. Enjoy!!!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The menu said that ""there are few beers that make us say HOLY SHIT""...well, now I understand why the kind folks at Holy Smoke included that as part of the menu description. Let me state that I am NOT a huge fan of RIS. I'll try, and usually enjoy, anything; but if I had my pick, I'd go with a Kolsch. The RIS anti-thesis. But this beer blew me away. The head was so dark, heavy and rich that it gave off a purple hue. The color of the beer was as dark as anything I've ever seen. Smell was to die for. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, a good stout should have. Coffee, chocolate, molasses, vanilla, caramel. At 10.5, I wasn't knocked over by the smell or taste of alcohol.

2681,34483,jsdunlop,4.37,"Pours out thick and viscous, motor oil consistency, with a dark tan frothy layering that forms rather quickly, then fades to a wispy covering. Smells of raisin, chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toffee, and alcohol. Taste manages to mimic the aroma fairly well. Raisins and plums hit the palate in a thick caramel sweetened blast of flavor. Roasted malts and bakers chocolate manage to break through heavily, with a slightly smokey character. Slight astringency mingles with the hefty booze presence, followed by a hint of bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Coffee and toffee appear after each sip to accent tje slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is heavy and thick. Creamy character with moderate carbonation. Overall, this viscous oil like concoction is amazing and multifaceted.

2681,34483,Hoops4life511,4.53,"12 oz can, canned on 10-25-10, funny little saying printed on bottom 10W-50... Fitting. Poured into oversized snifter.  Appearance - As I just stated, 10W-50 is fitting. This stuff is thicker and darker than any oil that has ever come from my car. Pours oily opaque black with a near chocolate brown head like nothing i have ever seen before. Absolute perfection when it comes to a stout. Lacing left patchy around the glass.  Smell - Chocolate, deep roasted coffee and a hint of alcohol leap out at you the second the can is cracked. Pouring into the deep bowl only accentuates these, but does add a hint of soy sauce and molasses. Very good, but turned a little on me.  Taste/Mouth - Sweet malty chocolate with a ton of espresso notes. Thick slick feel on the tongue with little carbonation present. Drinkable for one can, but any more is dangerous.  Overall - This is one of the best stouts I've ever had and I love showing it off to non craft drinkers. They all see can and think it's just like theirs and are BLOWN AWAY. I'd recommend this any day of the week.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Rifugium,4.02,"First had: on tap at Eulogy Belgian Tavern, Philly, PA  Pours and oily, pitch black, with a finger of dense brown head that laces nicely. Smell of coffee, ash, and licorice. Taste of dark roasted coffee, cocoa, licorice and molasses, with a rummy alcohol kick. Bitterness from the coffee notes lasts into the aftertaste. Full body and good drinkability. Very good stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Rootdog316,4.42,"Ten Fidy pours a very dark color, and almost looks like its motor oil. This beer is amazing from the beginning to the finish. The smell and mouthfeel are incredibly strong and are certainly the highlights of this beer. The taste is much sweeter than I expected, but towards the finish it becomes much more bitter. There is a mocha/caramel sweetness to Ten Fidy that I haven't had in any other stout. Definitely one of the better Russian Imperial Stouts I've ever had.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JoshVandy,3.93,"355mL can into a Cigar City snifter. Canned on date of November 19, 2009.  A- Pours about as black as I've seen a beer, with very little mocha colored head that vanishes immediately, leaving a menacing looking liquid in the glass.  S- Chocolate and roasted malts come through very nicely. Let it warm in the glass an picked up even more chocolate and just a hint of smoky molasses.  T- Huge taste of sweet chocolate and roasted malt hit my tongue, followed my lovely coffee and dark fruit. A great tasting beer, with not a trace of alcohol heat present, which is good.  M- Intensely thick and creamy, with a smooth feel and slightly low carbonation. Absolutely coats the mouth with huge flavor, leaving me wanting more every time I set my glass down.  O- A very well made RIS that is insanely drinkable given its ABV. This beer is immensely smooth and creamy as well. Definitely something I will have various vintages of at all times in my fridge and cellar.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,dvsbizzyb,4.08,"Appearance - This thing is a deep opaque black, almost like ink with a dark coffee colored foam head that disappears quickly. When held up to the light the room gets darker as this s.o.b. absorbs all light around it. It's pure evil.  Smell - At first sniff I get dark roasted malts and bittersweet chocolate. As it warms hints of of deep rich coffee and a oak wood aroma comes through.  Taste - First sips had a high level of bitterness which were still tolerable, but got better as it warmed. It transformed into a balanced flavor of roasted malts and barley then leaving an aftertaste of a liquored up espresso.  Mouthfeel - Judging by looks you'd think it would be thick, but it comes in very smooth with a medium body to it with very little carbonation.  Overall - Very impressive beer out of a can! This one is definitely a sipper and may get you in trouble if not careful as it hides the alcohol very well.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,legalpete19340,4.45,"A: Poured absolutely black with a big head. I didnt know head could actually be black. Dissipated to a skim. Minimal lacing.  S: Soy sauce, molasses, burnt sugar, barley, dark oat bread, smoke.  T: Sweet and salty. More soy sauce, chocolate covered cherries, dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, barley, oat bread, hint of bourbon. Some nice herbal hops hiding in the back. Alcohol is always hiding in the background.  M: Wants to be syrupy but its not. Viscous and chewable.  O: Wow, always impresses me. I try to forget about it but I cant. Dark and sexy.

2681,34483,vtblackdog,4.5,"Appearance is pitch black. I mean I held it up to the sun, directly in front of the sun, and no light penetrated. A short chocolatey creamy head formed and left little lacing.  Smell is a sweetish, alcohol with a hint of hops in the background.  Taste is great. This is definitely an imperial stout. The alcohol is upfront and slightly balalnced with malts and hops.  Mouthfeel is a creamy thick experience.  Overall an excellent example of an imperial stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Kvlterbm,4.46,"12 oz can to snifter.  A: Pours an oily, pitch black with about half a finger of milk chocolatey head. No light coming through it at all.  S: A lot of alcohol in the nose gives it a sweetness that marries itself pretty well with the chocolate aroma of the beer. Some coffee and roastiness is present as well, but the smell is dominated by boozy sweetness and chocolate.  T: Initial taste of chocolate mixed with some sweetness and a warming sensation from the alcohol. There's some definite caramelized sugar as well. As the sweetness starts to fade, you're left with roasted grains and an aftertaste of coffee. This would be an excellent dessert beer, but it definitely stands well on its own.  M: Thick, creamy, viscous, light carbonation.. what I want from an imperial stout.  O: A spot-on imperial stout. Definitely one of the best I've had in the style.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A - pours like black tar, has a great slight caramel head. looks like a dinosaur made of cookies should be stuck in it.  S - awesome, not amazing, but really great. smells warm.  T - really solid, especially for coming out of a can. slight burnt caramel and chocolate.  M - again, not amazing, but super acceptable for a canned stout. I really enjoy drinking this beer.

2681,34483,pmarlowe,4.44,"Tulip glass.  Pours a viscous black with a layer of dark brown and orangeish foam which almost completely dissipates within a few minutes. Smell is dark cocoa, roasted malt, and as it warms, coffee. Very good stuff. The taste has similar flavors, with a long finish, tinge of bitter sweetness, and a little heat (though not much considering the ABV). Smooth mouthfeel, with light carbonation on a medium-full body. Overall, this is a pretty straightforward, excellent, well balanced stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ThePorterSorter,4.35,"Love the cans. This is actually my first experience with oskar blues, although it isn't the first beer of theirs I've reviewed.  Appearance: The beer pours motor oil black with almost no head. The thin halo of foam appears to be a dark tan. There is also minimal lacing, in fact this beer appears to be almost completely devoid of any carbonation. This is the type of beer to coat your insides.  Smell: Very potent ethanol with some spicy notes of fruit and caramel. There is a faint vanilla, but little notes of chocolate or coffee. This beer is very delicious in both appearance and smell.  Taste: WOW, incredible taste. Very bold caramelized sugars saturating my palate with just enough bubbles to trick my senses into thinking I'm really drinking down a glass of heavenly cream. This beer is vaguely reminiscent of toasted coconut. There is approximately 5x normal stout flavor crammed into every drop of this beer. Not to mention the spicy bitterness from the hops that melds well to complement the beer's inherently rich roastiness.  Mouthfeel: This beer is as rich as it appears, I am spoiled now and may never look at any stout (russian imperial or not) the same ever again. Rich and creamy, easy to put down, but still packs a punch with its bitter hops and potent ethanol. This beer gets even more delicious as it warms providing additional kick to all aspects of its flavor and aroma profile. The aftertaste is of burnt caramel malt which coats the palate, but doesn't overextend its stay.  Overall: Delightful stout and definitely pushes the extremes of its class in both alcohol content and flavor (which is an impressive feat). I love the feeling of just pouring this motor oil black beverage. The price is also fairly reasonable at $4 a can (if I were paying that in a bar...call the ambulance). Lastly, I am a fan of can packaging over glass, just a personal preference!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Devi0us,4.26,"2011 batch poured into a tulip.  A- This is the darkest/blackest stout that I have poured. I can't believe it's coming from a can. Very Thick with a 2 finger head. Did I say Thick? Coates the glass nicely when swirled with spotty lacing left behind.  S- Dark Chocolate and Coffee/Espresso. As I swirled it, the smell became more intense.  T- Didn't expect it to be this sweet. As it warmed up, the Coffee/Espresso hit you with an oak bittersweet finish. Alcohol was very well hidden. Very Drinkable.  M- Mouthfeel is Thick. Light carbonation. Coates the palate very well.  O- Overall, this is a great brew and I still can't believe it came out of a can. The beer tastes better as it warms up. I would definitely grab more of this again as it is very drinkable.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bobhits,3.64,"Blackest black pour I’ve ever seen, even the pour looks nearly black. Once in the glass nothing not even the slightest hint of light gets through. The head is also the darkest I’ve seen, extremely dark chocolate head. Brandy like legs top off this motor oil like stout.  Dark fudge and floral hops dominate things here. An extremely hoppy beer without much coffee/espresso notes which makes me wonder why I’m missing what others have noted. Ah, the nose without a swirl that brings out the hops does take on some powdery coffee notes. Among the RIS style this is pretty par for the course.  Sickly sweet malt just dominates this making for a nearly too sweet sugary beast. Hops are very present and they simply add to the sweetness adding a fruity finish. This reminds me as an intense and darker black out stout. The back ground has chocolate and mellow liquorish. Hops are the show case here, nothing like night stalker and it the IBUs don’t bite, but the hops add a wonderful flavor.  Creamy, viscous, nearly syrup levels of body with virtually no carbonation. Simply amazing and without any alcohol notes!  Ah, canned beer, the best thing since the best thing before sliced bread so what the wheel? All things being even this is a bit too big and sugary for me. If I wanted something this sweet I’d eat things like cake. So now I think I need to go run and go no carb for a month to make up for this glass. Still extra points for canning as nothing is better than pouring a beer from a can into a snifter!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Pours jet black with a small dark tan head. The smell is chocolatey with some molasses and some general sweetness. A little alcohol. Taste is bittersweet chocolate, a little vanilla toffee and heaven. Coats your mouth and hangs for a bit and finishes with a little bitter to balance out the sweet. So good, would be dangerous if I had access to this all the time.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Krakistophales,4.45,"A: Pours jet black with a dark tan head that recedes into a halo of bubbles.  S: Dark coffee, malt, caramel, milk chocolate, and brownie in the initial whiff, but as it warms you also get star anise, bread pudding, and candied fruit. Truly complex and wonderful.  T: Initial hit of bittersweet chocolate that changes into sweet, candied fruits and is finished with a double espresso, dark coffee, bittersweet finish. As it warms, you also get oak chips and smoke in the finish.  M: Silky smooth, good carbonation, goes down easily, booze is hidden well, warms nicely.  O: This goes directly into the top 10 Imperial stouts that I've had list.

T - Roasted dark malts, creamy rich chocolate, brownie batter, toasted brown sugar, tart dried fruit, charred espresso, faint anise in the background, toasted/charred brown bread, finishes dry with a smokey bitterness on the end.

Some minor lacing prevalent on the pint glass, but nothing to brag about. Love the name and graphics on the can and the fact that it is indeed served in a can.  S - Milk chocolate and roasted malt come through with a sweet and smokey characteristic.  T - The milk chocolate seems somewhat darker concerning the taste and the smokey roasted malts are very up-front. Some hop bitterness is there as well, but only in miniscule amounts. The alcohol is definitely there, but it's hard to mask at 10.5% (Ten Fidy!).  M - Feels like it appears, viscous like motor oil. The sweet and thick beer coats the entire tongue in a pleasant milk chocolate layer.  O - Overall this beer dominates the style. Everything about it is wonderful except that I would only drink one at time for inebriation purposes and because of how thick and filling it is.

Chunky dark khaki streaks of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and dark fruits. Taste is of dark roasted malt, dark cocoa powder, dark fruits, and slight coffee on the finish. Very little bitterness on the palate after each sip. Mouthfeel is extremely thick and creamy.

Very thin wispy. film of a head appears briefly but very quickly disappears.  S-&gt; Whoa! Bitter Baking Chocolate dominates first and foremost. Smoky and robust malt aromas are also present. Some sinus-clearing booze is also detected.  T-&gt; VERY BITTER, like unpleasantly so for the first few sips before my palate adjusted. The bitter bitter baking chocolate taste dominates through the middle where finally a toasted grain and smoky malt flavor becomes apparent and finally finishes with a tiny bit of hops and sweet, metallic-esque taste on the back end. (Full disclosure: This beer did improve significantly for my taste after it had warmed and I had consumed about half the can...Also got some molasses as this warmed)  M-&gt; Would have liked just a scootch more carbonation but otherwise this is a full bodied brew that finishes. Maybe that would have helped or hindered the astringent-like feel I got from the alcohol, who knows....  O-&gt; Overall, I'm really not sure why this beer garners so much of the praise it receives. Maybe it is better fresh? Or with more age on it? Not sure. What I am sure of is that this was far too bitter for my liking and way too overdone on the chocolate. I didn't get any of the coffee notes others were finding. I wanted to like this, I really did as I enjoy Imperial Stouts quite bit...I just couldn't force myself to enjoy it....it got a little less harsh on the bitter chocolate as it warmed but then the booze just took the reigns from there. Either something was up with my can or I just don't care for this brew. Different folks have different tastes and I just don't share others infatuation with this beer...I can think of a handful of RISs that I would rather have for less dough.

2681,34483,shand,4.54,"Poured from a 12oz can into a nonic.  This is black. Blacker than the blackest black times infinity. Hold this right up to a lightbulb. Nothing shines through at all. The head is very very dark colored, but it's fairly thin and minimal. That's alright though because this is black. Viscous. Looks like it's deadly serious. The aroma is probably the weakest part of this beer. I'm having a hard time coaxing a big aroma out of this, there's some chocolate and matiness, but not too much more. The taste is absolutely sublime. Smooth dark chocolate gives way to some dark fruit and just a touch of a hop kick. Vanilla and absolutely perfect roasted malts finish this off. Just fantastic.  The mouthfeel is extremely thick and full bodied, with a light, yet noticeable amount of carbonation.. Absolutely perfect for the style. The drinkability is absurd for the ABV, this goes down way easier than the 10.50% on the can claims. A superlative RIS from Oskar Blues. Seriously. Drink this. It's so good.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The pitch black beer gives a thick, chocolate brown head that lasts for just a minute or so before declining to a thin khaki cap of lace.  This beer smells very sweet, with a toffee-like aroma; big pumpernickel, smoke, and bitter chocolate notes.  TenFIDY sips like a big heavy glass of toasted grains and syrup finishing up with a taste rather like fresh biscuits. It's incredibly sweet--much more so than I was expecting. This isn't one of the sharply bitter imperial stouts with the emphasis placed on the charred barley; this brew has a softer side. Full-bodied.

A fingers worth of burnt caramel head sits for a short while. The edges leave very little light to pass through. Spotty lacing clings throughout.  The nose brings a lot of milk chocolate that has a bittering end to it. Roasted malts and a presence of alcohol are also noted.  The taste is interesting. The roasty malts bloom but an annoying metallic taste lingers. There is a light hop presence. As it warms, the flavors intensify.  The mouthfeel is very full bodied and sits like an anvil.

Thick coffee, chocolate and licorice aromas, bits of toffee and caramel are there too  Kinda sweet at first with the toffee and chocolate flavors but the roasted flavors come in very strong right after, the roasted coffee like bitterness is a great complement to the initial sweetness, bit of a metallic tinge on the finish.  Smooth, almost creamy and from a can or a bottle I consider that to be quite the feat. Carbonation was adequate, not sure I could have more than one in an evening.

2681,34483,eat,4.5,"A straight-up donation from viggo. I owe you one!  Canned October 12, 2010. One of the more viscous looking pours I've ever seen; this stuff pours like melted dark chocolate. You can't even see through it with an inch left in the glass, it's pitch black. An evil dark-mocha head rises up an inch for a minute before fading to a thin cover and leaving some spotty lacing. I love to see such a dark head on an imperial stout, always a good sign.  Smells like a huge malt bomb: malted milk balls, dark sticky caramel and charred bread with salty minerals, earthy hops, alcohol.  Almost anything you'd want to find in an imperial stout is here in fine form: smoke, oak, bourbon, molasses, 85% dark chocolate, a hint of espresso, vanilla bean, estery over-ripe stone fruit. Some alcohol through the middle, though it's not at all out of place amongst everything going on here. Drying soily hops and cocoa on the finish. Not overly sweet nor overly bitter. Very well-balanced and accessible in spite of the intense amount of flavour.  Nice thick, substantial body. Very low carbonation. Great feel, though maybe I'd like the tiniest bit more carbonation (to be extremely picky).  Quite possibly the best beer I've ever had out of a can (with Surly Furious as the competition). If I were to dream up an imperial stout with all my favourite elements, I don't think it would end up too far off what Ten Fidy tastes like. Wish I had easier access to this, I'll be buying a bunch of this next chance I get. Thanks a ton viggo!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

I'm holding it up to the brightest lamp in the room, and absolutely NONE of the light penetrates this beer! Aroma is surprisingly faint, but has hints of unsweetened dark chocolate & black coffee. 1st sip is surprisingly sweet...more dark chocolate, black coffee, malt roasted almost to the point of being ""burnt"", and a slight hint of smoke. On the swallow, there is a bitterness of alcohol and the the dark chocolate/coffee notes with a hint of hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, silky, and thick...the consistency of syrup or honey. Overall?

2681,34483,scotvega18,4.4,"Poured from a Can into a 12 oz snifter - from 2010  A - possibly the most gorgeous imperial stout I have seen. The head color in particular is incredible with a kind of dark chocolate brown that resembles ice cream. The body is as black as ink.  S - I think if there was a weak point on this beer, this is it. I really dont get a whole lot on the nose other than alcohol and dark fruit, presumably from the yeast. I dont smell the chocolate or roastiness that some people mention EDIT- as this warms up I start to get the chocolatiness out of the nose. Still, Alcohol and Dark fruits dominate the scene.  T - BOOM! incredible smoothness, can only be described as velvet, as the taste of chocolate, both milk and dark, and some mild roasty bitterness coat your mouth. Wow, just.... wow.  M - As stated before, velvet is the only way to describe it. It is the balance and smoothness that make this beer one of the bests in terms of imperial stouts. amazing  Notes- This thing assaulted my taste buds. holy crap. The stickiness, which is something I love in a stout, sticks around forever. This being in a can, It will be interesting to see how this ages.

There isn't much lacing to speak of and the head quickly leaves.  S - Heavy coffee aromas, tart cherries, dark chocolate.  T - The front mimics the aroma with coffee notes, tart cherries, dark chocolate. Feels deliciously tart and sour in the middle to the back of the throat. Finishes very clean with a quick aftertaste.  M - Medium in body. Not a hint of the alcohol.  O - Excellent flavorful and complex RIS. If you like sweet strong stouts It doesn't get much better than this in my opinion.

2681,34483,greybeardloon,3.24,"Canned on January 11, 2011.  A: Black. An aggressive pour creates about a finger's worth of dark brown head that lasts for a minute or two. The lacing is quite prominent for the style. This is what an imperial stout should look like.  S: Sweet miso, roast, dark fruit, and booze. I found the miso a bit too prominent.  T: Tamari, blackstrap molasses, some chocolate and roast. Some dark fruit. And booze, of course, but not as prominent as I expected from the smell. I found the tamari and sweetness overwhelming and would have preferred more hop bitterness to balance the sweetness.  M: Smooth and creamy. It's definitely thick, but it doesn't feel anywhere near as syrupy as it looks.  O: This beer has a great appearance and mouthfeel. The unbalanced sweetness and the tamari put me off. I occasionally pick up miso/tamari/soy sauce in roasty imperial stouts, but this was way too much. [On a later occasion, I sniffed some actual soy sauce while drinking the beer, and that helped me break the soy sauce association somewhat. It didn't help me enjoy the beer any more, though.]",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TheBrewo,4.47,"We pour an oily thick brew as dark as midnight. It holds a transient dark brown colored head of half a finger, which recedes into a thick ring and swirl about the top of the glass. With a harder pour thick bubbles populate the head, and eventually segregate to the glass’ sides. Some lacing is left as they go. No sediment is noted, and carbonation looks slow, due to the thickness, but active. The nose fills with deeply roasted malts swimming in a pool of fusel booze. It is highlighted throughout by a sticky sweetness, with dried prunes, molasses, brown sugar, and the faintest banana esters all contributing. As we sip, sweet alcohols burn off the front to reveal a heavy roasted malt profile. Hiding within are those dark fruits from the nose, appearing as cherry and ground cherry pits. Sugary sweetness pulls through the middle, calming down the booze momentarily. Some of the other flavoring shines through briefly, with more dark malts, and even some roasty coffee coming out. We finish cleanly, with slightly metallic and chalky malts, and a strong alcohol character. The aftertaste breathes simply, and quite mildly, with burnt grain, and more of that high abv and fruit from the beginning. The body is full, and the carbonation is medium. Each sip arrives with generous froth and creaminess, and a slickness that coats the mouth in full. Slurpability is way up there, and the mouth is left a bit sticky, of sugar, and dried. The abv is high, and warms nicely, but is within range. While the booze is obvious and stark, this one is very drinkable.  Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the aroma and the general drinkability. A common theme throughout this tasting was that this beer is highly boozy. They don’t try to hide this point, but rather play to it. In the aroma the fusels are well integrated into the heavy, dark malts, while in the taste, there is enough push from the background to keep it from being unmanageable. Each sip brings a stickiness to the lips, with generous coating throughout the mouth. All of these characteristics help to bring the beer to its full potential, and make it greatly enjoyable all around.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,mdaschaf,4.18,"A: The pour from the can into the my DFH signature glass looked very thick and oily. It poured incredibly black, completely opaque. A one finger mocha head formed and reduced to a small layer of foam on top. Great lacing for style.  S: Nice dark chocolate upfront and some roasted coffee midway through. There is some molasses, caramel, and a little bit of mocha.  T: Upfront there is a combination of chocolate and coffee. Some roasted malt and a little bit of hops in the midpalate. Hints of tobacco and vanilla as well. There is an extremely bitter finish.  M: Full bodied with good carbonation, drinks very thick. Despite its thickness, it is still rather silky smooth.  O: Pretty good, not the best I have had, but very good. The flavors blend quite nicely, if the finish was a little less bitter it would be spot on.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S- Real smoky, reminds me of camping. some chocolate and coffee like roast in there but the smoke is prominent.  T- Much like the nose. Very smoky through out with a slight dark fruit hint up front. Chocolate and coffee in the middle thats followed by smoky coffee into the finish. sweeter tastes linger  M- heavy on the tongue with little carbonation. Very smooth.  O- Really like this beer.

S: A little sweet and very roasty with a hint of chocolate. T: Very roasty, some hop bitterness as it warms. There is some definite chocolate along with some burnt notes (maybe black patent malt). A little bit of dark caramel sweetness. There is only a slight hint of alcohol warmth, somewhat surprising given the 9.5% M: Creamy, rich, a medium low level of carbonation, all combine for a sippin beer that goes down very smooth. D: An excellent example of a RIS, goes down smooth, a great dessert beer and a something that would be perfect in front of a campfire.

2681,34483,BARFLYB,4.35,"Just moving some stuff around here, Review # 1050.  Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter. this can was bought over a year ago so it may have been from one of the 1st ""canings"" of this brew. no date present on the can.  A- Cracking open the black can came a black liquid that was thick as thieves. A aggressive pour lead to a nice 1 1/2 finger brownish head that looks creamy. a lot of bubbles are seen throughout the head. a good amount of lacing as well. very beautiful.  S- I smell a lot of chocolate and some tootsie roll goodness. It's followed by coffee, a little caramel, and a twinge of alcohol. Malts are also present. A very nice full aroma consistent with the RIS style. the smell tells me i'm in for a treat.  T- Wowsers, flavor overload. I get a bunch of dark chocolates and black coffee with roasted/smoked malts that add some bitterness as i sip more. As ten fidy warms the chocolate comes out even more and some licorice makes a cameo appearance. Alcohol is only slightly present.  M- TF goes down pretty smooth and has a medium body. not as thick/thin as some RIS i've had so the feel is almost perfect.  D- Yummy yummy yummy, i have ten fidy in tummy, and i feel like drinking two!!! This is not a session beer but once i'm done one, i want another. A perfect sipper but i can't help to drink this fast.  I'm going to have to get a fresh can and compare the batches cause i read that some changes were made.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,DirtybeerguyRI,5,"APPEARANCE: A friend of mine performed an experiment with Ten FIDY where she took a pint into a completely dark room and had her son hold a high-powered flashlight directly behind the glass. According to her, absolutely no light was able to pass through this beer. Not surprising. You'll have better luck seeing a firefly through concrete. This beer is dark as pitch. There's about one finger of a light cocoa head.  SMELL: Fantastic aroma! There's the smell of oaty, freshly-baked bread combined with espresso and dark chocolate. I pick up an undertone of dark fruits with an alcohol tang (note the ABV above).  MOUTHFEEL: Slick and velvety! This very full-bodied, nearly viscous stout feels incredibly rich on the tongue. Low carbonation translates into a very smooth, drinkable stout.  TASTE: This stout opens up in the mouth with a huge, balanced taste of both dark chocolate and coffee. There's a lot of toasty dark malts, and under that tones of caramel and molasses.  DRINKABILITY: For such a huge, viscous stout, this is a surprisingly drinkable beer. Granted, I have a high tolerance for stouts, but I could drink several pints (or cans) of this stuff. It's hard to improve on this one.  VERDICT: Hands down, this is one of my all-time favorite imperial stouts. I'm a HUGE fan of this brewery and Ten FIDY is my favorite from them. That said, don't ignore their other brews. All good stuff!  Cheers, John Harvey Dirtybeerguy.com",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,dragonWhale,4.14,"sweet sweet Jesus..2006 on tap at The Gate. Beautiful. Some sweet roastiness in full midnight. The bitterness of the brew is still solid, all flavor hops faded totally removed. Some chocolate and coffee behind the roasty bitter. Very good with this age on it. The bitterness finally balances the rest of the beer out. The more recent batches seem to have been way too heavy on the roast but this one is right on.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,CuttDeez,4,"Can into a snifter A - The pour almost defines motor oil and it appears blacker than black. There is a very creamy tan head on this beer with a decent amount of lacing. S - Very awesome note. There are roasted malt sugars, there are roasted oats, wheats, and grains. Then there is the deep dark chocolate mixed with coffee and roasted espresso notes. The thing that balances it out is the dark fruit notes that are mixed with the sugars. A good complex and deep nose. T & M - A very very smooth stout that is dominated by the nose in taste. The coffee, malt, chocolate, and roasted grains come through in all phases. I am a big fan of the cherry and chocolate flavors mixing in the palate. The beer is not very carbonated, but it is smooth and it is heavy on the palate. O - A great beer. Awesome to have some canned craft with such character and I cannot wait till my other cans get some age on them. Great stout from oskar blues.  -Cheers",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bum732,4.48,"S: Toasted dark bread, touch of soy sauce, roasted coffee, raisin bread, perfumy vanilla.  L: Jet black, dense tan head with good retention and great lacing.  T: Dark and milk chocolate off the bat with a rich breadiness. Medium-low bitterness leads to more milk and dark chocolate sweetness. Finishes with some vanilla and more raisin bread with a touch of roastiness. Fairly sweet finish with some fudge.  M: Medium full body, very creamy, low carbonation.  The very definition of a dessert beer, very sweet, chocolately, creamy and even some booze to warm the stomach. Love it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ludachris,4.65,"Two fingers of frothy milk chocolate head sit on top of this monstrous goopy jet black body, receding slowly and leaving dots of lace behind. This is a fantastic looking imperial stout.  So rich and so complex in the nose. I get heavily roasted malts, sweet burnt granola, very dry dark chocolate, alcohol soaked cherries, overly ripe plums, and hints of coffee beans. Well rounded and incredibly inviting.  Slick and smooth sweet milk chocolate glides across the palate alongside a pleasantly roasted malt character. Sweet dark fruits peak through about midway in at the front of the tongue and remain there for some time. Burnt sugar cane comes through just before a perfectly rendered dry and unoffensively bitter smokey and roasted malt finish.  The mouthfeel is an experience in itself. Full bodied, frothy, and velvety smooth. Well balanced seems to be an understatement. It's scary how easy this beer is to drink with next to no trace of the high ABV. If I could give higher than a 5 for this category, I would.  I had high expectations for my first time trying this and they were easily exceeded. This is by far one of the if not the best RIS I've ever had. It doesn't destroy your palate with gigantic, mouth puckering notes of one thing or another. Instead, it's extremely well balanced through and through while still being incredibly flavourful. I'll have no problem buying this again, and again, and again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,uustal,4.5,"Pours a motor oil black out of the can. Milk chocolate brown colored head which quickly gives way. Aroma of coco beans, dark cherry and roasted marshmallow. Flavor is outstanding. Dark cherries, coffee beans and the slightest hint of crisp hops to start. Beer quickly moves onto huge rushes of roasted chocolate, cream and marshmallow. Molasses as it warms. Thick creamy mouthfeel. Excellent, drinkable RIS. Alcohol is dangerously hidden.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ElGrecoVerde,4.46,"Look: Well, it's black. No highlights of red or hints of brown. Just black with a brown head.  Smell: Dark fruits, mainly berries and dark chocolate. Undertones of roasted grains.  Taste: The roasted flavors really stand out here. Toast, burnt malts, dark fruit, rich dark chocolate, and creamy espresso. Behind all of that lies hints of caramel, brown sugar, vanilla and a solid floral hop presence to pack it all together.  Feel: No room for improvement here, its excellent. Creamy with a frothy carbonation that keeps the beer from feeling like milk.  This RIS leans more toward the dark fruit side than dark chocolate, but there's plenty of both. Overwhelming amounts of flavor as you'd expect from the style. Highly roasted and the high ABV is well masked.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,finagler,4.6,"Pulled the drain plug on my can of Ten Fidy and let it pour into my nascar pint glass. I'm going to drive the puns while drunk on this stuff, sorry.  A - Black with no head while pouring slow. My second one I did a vertical pour and managed a 2mm thick brownish fizz that faded quickly. Swirling leaves a nice clearish brown film.  S - Carmel, molasses, chocolate, roasty and fruity.  T - Amazing balance of smoky/fruity for how thick and black this beer is. I wasn't expecting such a full flavored and complex beer. Served at different temps yields different flavors.  M - Thick, carbonation is apparent despite lack of head. Stickyness on the lips. Watered down syrup.  Overall a very tasty brew, highly recommended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The aromas definitely open up as the beer warms.. lots of chocolate in the mix, along w/ some coffee and molasses. The flavors are very roasty, bold, and intense. I'm also picking up a slight amount of milk and vanilla. The aromas and flavors are spot on for the style. Mouthfeel is exceptional! Extremely thick, heavy, creamy, and rich; not too much carbonation. Finishes slightly warm, alcohol slightly noticeable. Great imperial stout, definitely top-tier. Very impressive!  No doubt this belongs up there w/ the best stouts.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,flipper2gv,4.58,"Thanks to crossovert for this great beer!  A: Pitch pitch black. Might be the darkest beer I've ever seen (seems even darker than WWS). No head at all. Don't know if there is a problem with my can, but the little head I had didn't last long too. No lacing.  S: Very sweet and reminiscent of Choklat and most Soutern Tier imperial stouts. Tons and tons of milk chocolate in this with coconut, vanilla, smoke (aka bacon), wood tannins. Man this is really dark smelling beer. And it's also quite fruity with good amounts of over riped strawberries, cherries, plums. Light maple syrup.  T: Again, very reminiscent of a lesser sweet Choklat. The smoke is very strong (bacon) in this and it actually works great. Also, much more of roasted malts in the taste than in the smell. From them you get powdery cacao on the top of the sweet milk chocolate. Vanilla, coconut, wood tannins, maple syrup, over riped strawberries, cherries and plums are still there. A complex, sweet (but never getting cloying) imperial stout that has no anise or molasses in the taste (IMO). Some marmelade???  M: I'm very happy to notice that the appearance falsely led me to believe there wouldn't be any carbonation. Although the carbonation is still low but I wouldn't want any more than that for a beer like this. Mouthfeel is HUGE, creamy and sticky, great.  O: This is a really good beer. There's nothing new with that. I'm still quite surprised on how much more balanced the beer is versus the idea I had after smelling it. Very drinkable even considering the massive body of the beer. No alcohol in sight. A must try considering it's only 4$ a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,zhanson88,4.04,"Appearance: Pours out of the can almost pitch black, and looks completely opaque once it settles. About 2 fingers of deep roasted expresso head forms that has amazing retention and lacing.  Smell: Very interesting smell. The requisite roasted malts are there of course, but I also get tons of dark fruit scents as well. Like, insane amounts. Lots of plum and fig threaten to drown everything else out. Little to nothing in the way of chocolate or coffee.  Taste: A great deal of roasted malts appear up front. Maybe hints of chocolate and coffee. On the back end the flavor becomes dominated by the plum and fig dark fruit flavors. Finish is pretty fruity. It's a very unique stout, unlike anything else I've had.  Mouthfeel/Overall: This beer is every bit of full bodied; thick, chewy and creamy. Everything an imperial stout should be. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden. Overall, a very good imperial stout that I'd love to have full time access to. Very unique and pretty tasty.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The beer changes quite a bit as it warms in the glass and it seems each sip brings out something new  M - very full and rich on the tongue, viscous, creamy, and warm  D - as if 10.5% alcohol wasn't enough reason to take your time with this beer, the depth and complexity rewards contemplation.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

I cant wait to sink my teeth into it. There is a thin ring of burnt caramel color on the outer rim of the head. There is no head retention and no lacing.  S - This beer smells thick, if thats possible. Smoky malts lead to a coffee and burnt caramel notes. There is a slight tin aroma as well as a light alcohol smell.  T - I let this beer warm up a bit before enjoying. Dark roasted malts are giving me dark chocolate, molasses, coffee, licorice and vanilla. There is also a great smoky element in this flavor profile.  M - Thick and creamy. Very slight smooth carbonation. This beer leaves a thin oily film on my tongue. Like i would imagine a 10w-50 motor oil would feel in my mouth if i were stupid enough to drink one.  O - This is a delicious imperial stout, that has some serious heft behind it. The name is completely apropos cause it looks and pours like used motor oil. Its wonderfully balance, and the high ABV is well hidden other than the fact that i has a nice warming effect.

2681,34483,weizenbob,4.27,"And in this corner, weighing in at 9.5% ABV, the granddaddy of canned stouts, the lion from Lyons, Oskar Blues Ten Fidy! This will be a twelve ounce fight. Keep it clean and go out swinging!  This can was received in a trade with dizknee24. Thanks Pete. It was dated 11/2/09. Score! I punched a knife through the bottom, cracked the top, and shotgunned the thing. When I regained consciousness the next day I sat down with another can which I sensibly poured into a large wine goblet. The moral of the story: treat this one like a lady. Love it and it will love you back.  Knowing that I was pouring a beer that was approaching 10% alcohol, I tilted the can aggressively in an attempt to rile up as much head as possible. I was rewarded with about a finger's worth for my effort. The head is Crayola brown but unfortunately (though expectedly) the retention is pretty poor. Lacing is thick and sticky. This is about as dark a stout as they come. Sometimes it's a slight exaggeration to describe a stout as black. Ten Fidy literally is black. If you stare into it too long you can get lost.  This is a stout that starts blurring the line between beer and fine liqueur. The aroma is quite alcoholic and a bit fruity, landing the impression of black licorice. The scent of chocolate is also very aggressive. Roasted malts are noted in the background. It all blends in such a way as to suggest a smooth chocolate liqueur. In other words, it smells like a treat.  The initial sip hits a couple of different areas of the palate simultaneously. The tongue becomes instantly coated with alcohol and the presence of that aforementioned licorice bite. At the same time, the nose becomes filled with wonderfully roasted malt. As the alpha traits of the flavor profile begin to subside, other wonderful flavors come out to play. Sweet chocolate syrup coats the mouth and deceives me into thinking this stout will be all pleasure and no pain. Then the reality of 98 IBUs kicks me in the teeth, reminding me that this heavyweight has a bitter side that is not to be taken lightly. It's as though your favorite stout made love to your favorite barleywine. A great raw cocoa flavor lingers in the aftertaste.  As far as the mouthfeel is concerned, Ten Fidy is surprisingly medium bodied. For such an aggressive brew I expected something much heavier. It does have a high alcohol content which aides the feel by adding a touch of velvet and keeping things generally smooth. The carbonation level is medium and appropriate. Still, the feel is disappointingly thin for such an amped up brew.  Overall Ten Fidy was a pleasant experience. It's not the best imperial stout that I've imbibed but it is certainly a good one. I could wish for a heavier mouthfeel and a longer lasting head, but when push comes to shove what really matters is the taste. In that respect, Ted Fidy delivers. It's a high alcohol brew and the cans are not cheap so you will not likely be sessioning this one. But as a dessert beer it is a fine selection. The winner and still canned beer champion: Ten Fidy!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,aasher,4.14,"Finally, MY first Ten Fidy! This beer pours like a champ. It's a black viscous potpourri of dark roasts, milk chocolate, and coffee. Generic adjectives yes, generic presentation of the aromas, no. The flavors are of roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, and sweet chocolate. It isn't as well blended as it could be. This beer drinks exceptionally smooth, almost too smoothly. It's very tasty and a fine stout out of a can. I do like it and I'd recommend it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

(makes me feel like I'm not drinking much)  Supremely black pour which never fails to amaze me coming out of A CAN. Sorry, I'm still too old school for this can thing, but I am trying... Wonderful dark tan head with drapey, classic syrupy lacing. Coats the glass in the way I love.  Aroma is a little musty. Caramel and roast for sure but there's a slight veggie element there that is maybe a little canny taste?  But moving on. I let this one warm a little because too cold kills the complexity of the taste which is slightly sweet, dark roast, licorice, burnt toffee, caramel, and a slight bit of coffee. With milk.  Excellent feel on the tongue. That's. What. She. Said.  Overall very nice and surprising. Could be a bit cheaper at $5.50 per can. But supremely tasty.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Yoonisaykul,4.2,"Got this thanks to papat444. Finally more Oskar Blue's. I've only had Dale's Pale Ale. Very excited to try it. Cool name, it's canned, looks like a great product.  A- Very dark brown, almost Fry's cocoa-like head. Held the tulip to a light and... it's an eightball. Can't see any nuances in this abyss of a stout. Didn't manage to get any lacing.  S- Woah. Smells like olives. The kalamata dissipates a bit and allows some toasty chocolate to come out along with some pretty strong alcohol which burns the nostrils. Interesting.  T- Lots of alcohol in here but it's all good. Some kind of green, very grassy hoppiness which tastes great. The rest is obviously roasty and chocolaty but (I don't know what's up with my tastebuds) it just doesn't jump out as roasty/smoky/chocolate/coffee like most other Imperial stouts. Still a clearly roasted and smoky after-taste, even a bit tobacco-like. Very sweet and even a bit fruity up front. Quite tasty and different. I'm rating taste as exceptionnal not because it's incredibly good but because it's very good but also exceptionnal as in one of a kind.  M- Kind of chewy. Medium to low carbonation but a heavy and sticky body. Medium dryness.  O- Very good beer. Different. Relatively easy to drink. Love how you can taste some hop flavour but it doesn't actually taste like a hoppy stout. Olive smell is weird but doesn't really affect the taste. Most of all, this beer is satisfying and I love a satisfying beer. Thanks again papat.  I'd definitely buy more of this.

Thick and luscious, with a moderate-low carbonation and slight, pleasant acridity greeting the tongue.  Roasted malt at its base, flavor like 90% cocoa chocolate, Kona coffee note, a bit of vanilla and smoke, dark fruit.

A great experience of flavor that is full bodied and enjoyable  D- Ten FIDY may be the best canned experience in the history of craft beer. A roasty candy-like experience in a can.

Just about no hops detected in this beer. Taste is very smooth and chocolaty. No alcohol burn or detection at all.  M - SMOOTH, THICK, RICH, and CREAMY. Nice Carbonation. Full bodied.

2681,34483,brian44556,4.16,"Picked a 4 pack of Ten Fidy while visiting Atlanta for the SEC Basketball Tournament.  Poured from 12oz can - canned 9-25-09.  Pour a beautiful, motor oil black. A great chocolate brown head forms and lasts for about a minute before crawling back into the rest of the beer. This beer has a great lacing on the sides with every drink. The smell is very complicated. I get a strong smell of chocolate, a little bit of coffee, and a strong alcohol smell. Strong taste of chocolate and alcohol. The 10.50% really shines, but that isn't such a bad thing. Mouthful is very good. Decent carbonation and very thick, just like a stout should be. Very good offering by Oskar Blues.

S - Wonderful aroma of milk chocolate, leather, smoke and just a little licorice. Just awesome!  T - Roasty and sweet taste. Coffee plays a big role, as well as dark rum, bitter chocolate and earthy hop. Gets a bit fruitier as it warms in the glass.  M/O - With a super thick mouth and complex flavors, Ten FIDY is a great sipping, after dinner brew. Insanely complex and a joy to drink.

Lots of pine but it mixes well with the creamy and maltyness. Love the expresso bite.  M: I love this beer! Very sticky, but still slides like oil down the back of your throat.  O: A great RIS!

Roasty, toasted, burnt hops. A little hop tang and malt sweetness. Nice semi sweet chocolate present. Smokey in the air of your mouth. There is a slight tangy/acidic note I can't quite identify. All of this going on with a little alcohol warmth to boot.  M - Very viscous and syruppy. Ive had thicker bodied beer but this is up there. However its incredibly smooth and silky rich.

Smells sweet, a little chocolate and coffee but mostly just brown sugar in the nose. Incredibly sweet and delicious...the 10.5% ABV is just barely noticeable. The chocolate flavor really comes through, very little hops flavor. Mostly malty. The mouthfeel is really lovely and thick without being heavy.

2681,34483,SWMeyer4141,4.53,"St Pattys day edition. Really excited I found this beer, some reason found it in the back right of the cooler at the liquor store, and it came in Monday, kind of odd, but think I may have hit the jackpot.  Appearance-Black as Night, no transperancy, very little carbonation. One finger brown head. Beautiful looking, what I expect to see in an RIS.  Smell-Fruit, primarily cherry. Not so much the Coffe/Chocolate characters you normally get in a RIS.  Taste-Unreal. Chocolate realy comes out, roasted malt comes out. Sugary, but balanced out perfectly with some slight bitterness. Alcohol is present but not too overwhelming.  EDIT:Drank from same batch 3 months later, similar features, but had to change from a 4.5 to a 5, Need to leave room for improvement.  Mouthfeel-Definitely full bodied, fairly thick. Creamy, with little carbonation.  Overall-Amazing beer. I'm lucky to have found this. Easy to drink for 10.50% and balanced perfectly. I'm going back tommorow to get whatevers left. Funny thing is the guy who worked there said it was a combination of Vodka and Motor Oil tasting. I wasn't sure why he would tell a customer that but still bought it. Glad I did. Happy St. Pattys Day.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Finger of mocha head. Leaves a thick ring around the edges of the class.  S: Loads of rich, sweet smells. Roasted barley, smoke, coffee, brown sugar, bitter chocolate. Excellent.  T: So good. Roasted and sweet. Chocolate, black coffee, brown sugar, dark fruit flavors. Didn't pick them up in the nose, but getting citrusy hops in the taste as well.  M: Thick. The alcohol provides a warm, tingling sensation. Completely coats the mouth with a bitter, sweet aftertaste.  O: Alcohol is well hidden in the taste and nose. World class, delicous.

2681,34483,DoubleSimcoe,4.7,"Ten FIDY out of a can (my first can review!), bought for $3.50 at New Beer Distributors in Manhattan, New York.  I used to drink this beer fairly often but have not had it in a very long time. I did have, though, and not too long ago, both the tap and whiskey-barrel versions at Max's in Baltimore.  Appearance: Served in a Sierra snifter, the can pours out a super thick and viscous, somewhat flat and devilishly black liquid. Probably the thickest Imperial Stout I have ever had. Comes with a 1/2-finger head that dies quickly, leaving a coffee-colored rim around the glass. No lacing, no retention, minimal carbonation. This is up there with the biggest stouts and bourbon-aged beers.  Smell: Truly outstanding, with even bourbon overtones, plus lots of smoke, dark coffee, dairy, burnt sugars, roasty malts, wood... imagine all the aromas you expect in an Imperial Stout; FIDY has them all, and then some.  Taste: Thinner than nose, I would suggest letting it warm up before sipping. In the mouth, creamy chocolate dominates, followed by some vanilla notes at the very end. Finishes thick and dry, prompting me to sip on something else- water! Smoke is present too, as is wood again. Truly amazing to think all these outrageous flavors came out of a CAN. Dark sweetness, hoppy bitterness around.  Mouthfeel: A little thin for the style. Smooth, creamy, low carbonation, medium body, full flavor. Good but not on par with the rest of this amazing beer.  Drinkability: WOW! Who would have thought a huge Imperial Stout like this would drink so well and easy?? It is poundable...  Yes, this is my favorite Imperial Stout. EVER!! I think I like it better canned than on tap, and definitely better than the whisky-barreled version.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Aroma-Rich, roasted malt, chocolate liqueur, cake batter, plums. Slight hop aroma, and some pungent alcohol. Smells like intoxicating brownie batter.  Flavor-Rich, luscious, and chocolatey. With notes of coffee and roasted malt, and dark fruits (prunes, plums). Slight green, earthy hops creep up along with moderately low hop bitterness. Finishes with some drying alcohol, and the chocolate brownie liqueur flavor lingers long into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel-Medium full body with moderately low carbonation. Silky smooth. Alcohol shows as moderate warmth, but is pretty damn sneaky. Awesome.  This is a solid RIS, with great chocolate and roasted malt flavors and aromas, and subtle dark fruit character to back those up. As far as RIS in a can goes, this is boss. Bravo.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Wegomlegging,3.12,"Poured black with a dark tan hide head that rises nice and slow. Smelled like wet tin cans. Flavor is a rush of sweet toasty malt, followed by warm alcohol down the back of the throat. Just the right amount of carbonation, wet drink. Drinkable, but not leaving me yearning for more. Overall a good beer, but stay away if you don't like this style.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Just not an everyday beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Morey,4.13,"Pours pitch black in color with a chocolate milk colored brown head. The fluffy head is still one finger tall after several minutes and features various sizes of bubbles.  The aroma is sweet and roasty with notes of dark chocolate and coffee.  If ever there was a beer that tasted like a mocha shake, this is it! Nice balance between the bitter hops and roasted barley which provides a definite sweetness.  This is one thick and chewy mouthfeel! I've had some full bodied beers, but whoa! Low carbonation level.  The 10 and a half percent alcohol isn't noticeable at all, but the sheer chewiness of this bad boy would keep you from downing too many.  Morey's Bottom Line: Finally got to try this, and all I can say is WOW! This is one heavy hitter of a stout.

S - After letting it warm, I picked up on a very sweet dark cherry, burnt chocolate smell with just a subtle hint of alcohol to let you know it's 10.5%.  T - Initially surprised by the creaminess of this beer as compared to its sweet notes on the nose. As you get into it you can really taste the dark fruits in the middle followed by a burnt chocolate/charred marshmallow taste on the finish.  M - Very creamy with a bit of chew. Overall a great feel that leaves the lips a bit sticky by the end.  D - For a 10.5% RIS this goes down dangerously smooth and taste great. Wanted to drink this one fast, but enjoy it at the same time. A big beer that hides the alcohol well, but brings all the flavors.  Bought 4 of these hoping to age 3 of them, but enjoyed the first one so much I had to go back for seconds with dessert.

Sweet chocolate dominates.  Taste is complex. Roastier than the aroma but definite chocolate presence. Very dry. Dark molasses and dark chocolate. Dry oats and cereal grains. Crisp and clean. The dryness and sweetness interweave. The taste is different from lips to finish. Nice sharp chocolate bite at points. Nice dry smooth finish at other places.

Roasted malt, tinge of burnt malt, and cocoa. Very rich smelling overall.  T - Like drinking candy. Sweet, chocolaty, and finishes with a good tongue grabbing bitterness. This is a full malt beer.  M - Syrupy, thick; fair amount of carbonation that is hidden by the thickness. Lingers in the mouth.  D - Great overall. A bit too malty for my preference, but no downgrades for that.

Slight alcohol burn is noticeable, but it makes the entire experience pleasant. Aftertaste has light and airy notes of dark fruit.  M- Creamy smooth and chewy with just the slightest carbonation, if this could be better I'm not sure how.  D- I have 2 left. I want to drink them now. This beer surpassed my expectations. I've only had a couple OB beers, but it's no wonder they're growing so rapidly, and it's not just the cans. These are some high quality brews.

Smells like dark chocolate, coffee, toffee, molasses, and just a bit of fruity hops.  Taste is excellent. Roasty and sweet malt with a bit of coffee, dark chocolate and again some pleasant fruity hops. Very well balanced.  Mouthfeel is heavy and sticky, as expected. Mild Carbonation.

2681,34483,allforbetterbeer,3.73,"Poured into a Swiss wine snifter. Canned on 11-12-2010, consumed 03-07-2011.  This viscous libation pours black with an almost rusty charred brown head, which rises two fingers and dies over the course of a few minutes.  From far away this smells like a box of fruit-filled chocolates. Cherry syrup, vanilla, imitation maple and confectioners sugar with sweetened milk chocolate. I have never smelled a sweeter beer. Swirling the odd concoction brings up some surprisingly bright and fresh hops, and the classic roasted barley notes that seem both sweet and burnt-bitter at the same time. Chocolate chocolate chocolate.  Thankfully the taste doesn't follow the nose, as this would be a mouth-hurting sweet syrup. First... well this is interesting. Darkly roasted malts are here and taste a little different than usual, could it be the hops? These taste different than usual as well. I think this different taste that I have been working to define is... burnt marshmallow! Not bad, but sugary AND burnt in a way I haven't tasted before. Pretty interesting, and tasty.  Mouthfeel is full and slick, I suspect the oats contribute to this. Carbonation seemed a bit excessive at first, and then a bit flat soon after, so maybe I am just picky tonight. Drinkability is pretty good, but not (in my opinion) up there with the very best.  Conclusion: Well my hat is off to Oskar Blues not because this is a beer that I love, but because it is unique. It tastes like nothing else exactly and for that I respect it, however I prefer my big stouts to lean more towards dark fruit, coffee, pure black patent malts or smoke, not burnt marshmallow. To each his own...  P.S. Take a big swig of this right from the can, it will scramble your expectations concerning 12oz cans wonderfully.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

T. alchohol bite at first followed by roasted malts and dark fruit such as prunes and fig and dark chocolate ending with some hop biterness I suppose. I get a small amount of metallic aftertaste in this.  M. Beautiful thick heavy mouthfeel covers the whole mouth, very smooth considering the ABV.  D. I can drink a couple of these no problem,but the 10.5 will drop the hammer for sure.

Very interesting.  S- The smell is light chocolate, earthy, molasses and some kind of dark berry. Black berry? Way more subtle than you'd expect from the appearance of this beer. The faint aroma doesn't match the bold visual at all. This beer is shifty.  T- Boom! The rope a dope method is in full effect! Faint, delicate aroma give way to strong molasses, coffee, semi-sweet chocolate and brown sugar. The alcohol comes out throughout and is alarmingly strong but adds to the flavor experience without taking over.  M- Syrupy and heavy with a formidable chew.  D- This beer is dangerous. Between the delicate aromas, powerful flavor and high alcohol content you'd think this would be a slow sipper to appreciate and move on but then POW! You've had 3 or 4 and you're face is numb.

Dark fruits mix in with some more sweetness and a bit of smoke. Light alcohol flair.  Plenty of rich malts laced with bittersweet dark chocolate and cocoa. A decent layer of dark fruit with dates and plum add in a unique sort of sweetness. Hints of charred smoke towards the middle. Some alcohol flair with a hop bite during the finish.

2681,34483,rawfish,3.56,"The beer pours motor oil black with a tiny mocha head. Very slow and viscous pour, noticable from the moment the beer leaves the can. Additionally this is as black as beer gets, some deep brown highlights on the edges but no light penetrates it, impressive.  Smell is not as strong as I expected out of a RIS but it's every bit as complex. Dark fruit, dried cherries and currants with all of that roasted maltiness and raw cocoa, like fudge.  The taste mirrors the smell with depth of chocolate flavors backed with some piney hops, enough to maintain balance. I was hoping for some coffee bean but the roasted smells didn't back the flavor. A bit of astringency and soy sauce.  The mouthfeel is thick, oily smooth without being overbearing with little carbonation to speak of. There's bitterness that was expected but it creeps in metallic and harsh, not fresh or bright. While the beer leaves a sweet mouth coating it doesn't dry and the bitterness unbalances the whole act driving you to quickly sip to drive away the unpleasantness.  I was really looking forward to this beer and I found it to be an amazing canned product but not on par with the hype.

Nose is of very ripe fruit sugars and molasses, with a bit of sweet chocolate. Tons of toasted scents as well.  Taste is very toasted, almost charred at times, with molasses the prevalent sweetness. Roasted malt bomb milkshake is the best way I can describe this beer, as it throws a lot of intense malt and texture at you without losing its mouthfeel or drinkability.  Speaking of those, Mouthfeel is ridiculously thick and creamy, and the foaming of the beer when swished around in the mouth adds to it immensely. Syrupy and viscous too, which is awesome for the style. Drinkability is crazy good, as the abv is flat out not there, and the coating this one leaves after each sip is delectable. I will say that the pure roasted character of this beer can get to be a bit much, but not for a while. Love this beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,AleWatcher,4.17,"Got this in the Blind BIF from nlmartin. Thanks buddy! The beer was opened without any prior knowledge of brewer, style, or anything.  So I made myself some nice pizza for dinner and decided to pop the blind can to go with it.... I had asked nlmartin what glassware to use for the beers and was told the snifter would get me through most if them, but ""use a glass for the can."" with no modifier in front of the word ""glass,"" I assumed ""pint glass.""  Anyway-- I pop the can. I immediately regretted it. It opened with a *click* with no hiss of carbonation... As soon as I began to pour it, I understood why-- this is a stout. A monstrous, sludgey, thick, viscous, dark black stout.  Sunnuvabitch. This will not go well with my pizza. I love me some Ten-Fidy... But I was expecting a pale ale... Yes, I guessed right away that this was Ten-Fidy-- what other Imperial Stout is in a can? Awesome.  Dark tan head, minimal lacing, no head at all left after I'm halfway done. Still though, looks nice... Smells of chocolate malt, toffee, some dark fruits, and a hint of black licorice. The taste has a great sweetness up front and dries out with a light booziness that really works well. This is very tasty. The black licorice is minimal, and the dark fruits ride in with a small charred smokiness. Very very tasty.  The body is full and thick. Good creamy feel with the low carbonation. Insanely tasty and easy drinking. Man, I need to ask my buddies to send me more of this... Thanks!

2681,34483,tlazaroff,3.76,"The appearance of this beer is quite dark, if I hold it up to the light I can see very very feint mahogany/purple hues on the very edges of the glass. That being said, it is almost pitch black. The head is a dark tan, almost brown head comprised of lots of tiny bubbles. The aroma is hoppy more than anything else. I pick up earth tones with a roasty malt background. Taste is fantastic! Big on roastyness with subtle coffee/espresso and chocolate flavors. Texture is thick, and I mean THICK.. like syrup! good carbonation but it's almost unnoticeable because your palate is adjusting to the syrupy quality of this beer. For drinkability I would have to give it a lower rating due to the high 10.5% ABV and texture. This is a sipping beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,omnomct,4.48,"I love Ten FIDY stout from Oskar Blues! You really need to drink this with some heavy food like pizza or pasta. This is not for the faint of heart. Really thick, heavy flavors, almost thick like syrups. One of my favorites, but super hard to find. You get a nice molasses flavor going on with some hints of burnt caramel.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Cmack15,4.03,Ahh an imperial stout in a can. I have wanted to try this beer for awhile after hearing a lot of good reviews and thankfully this beer did not disappoint. A beautiful thick chewy stout with a nice pleasant aroma of dark roasted malts. This beer is remarkably smooth for 10.55 abv. Good beer does come in a can and this beer is proof.

2681,34483,TCHopCraver,4.47,"Reviewed from notes written on 2/15/11. Thanks for the venue, Walter the Dog.  Ten FIDY ( I love that name) pours a scorched engine oil black into a medium-sized wine glass. There was no fizz at all when I popped the tab on the can, which led me to wonder if it was under carbonated. No head appears at all; only a faint haze of dark brown sits atop the black body. Just a hint of a brown hue is visible around the edges and there is no lacing to be found on my glass.  The smell is very toffee heavy upfront, with quite a bit of caramel and dark chocolate notes showing through. Some roasted malt and acidic coffee scents are present, but they reside well in the background. Dark cherry and plum aromas also hide in the background. As it warms, the roasted malt and coffee smells become much more prevalent. Strangely, the smell reminds me a bit of creamy Baileys. ""I'm Old Greg!""  I find there to be a perfect balance of acidic roastiness and sweet creaminess in the taste. As it warms, the acidic roastiness pops and nudges the the creaminess of the dark chocolate, toffee, and caramel flavors out of the way a bit. This is a very full, complex, present taste with a nicely dry and roasty finish.  Ten FIDY has a full and viscous feel in my mouth. It is very creamy and Baileys-like, but with enough of a roasty and hoppy bite on the sides of my palate to balance the feel out. This beer is a member of the three B's club: Big. Bold. Badass.  This is a slow sipping beer and an ear and face warmer, to be sure. It is not one that I would ever think of having several of in a sitting, simply because it is so heavy. It is, however, a beer that I would be thrilled to have from time to time.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,paulginva,4.55,"APPEARANCE: This beer poured into a pint glass with virtually no head at all -- 1/8"" at the most -- that dissipated to a small swirl of dark tan bubbles almost immediately. Looking carefully (with the help of a small LED flashlight) into the murky black body revealed a moderate amount of carbonation.  AROMA: Holding the glass to my nose I was immediately struck by a pleasingly balanced moderate alcohol scent supporting heavy malt aromas of roasted coffee, caramel, and molasses, with a light scent of pine needles and a slight earthy scent. I couldn't wait to see if it passed the taste test!  TASTE: Well, it passed the taste test with flying colors. Alcohol turned out to be mell masked by the heavy malt flavor to the extent that it seemed light even though I knew the beer had a high alcohol content. Tastes of caramel, roasted coffee, and chocolate were complimented by a slightly earthy light taste of pine and a hint of black licorice. All together, a masterful example of the brewer's art.  MOUTHFEEL: I loved the mouthfeel of this full bodied, slightly oily brew. Body lacing was virtually nonexistent. Moderate carbonation tickled the tongue. The initial flavor was slightly sweet, morphing into a slightly bitter flavor at the finish. This sensation stayed on the tongue for a moderate amount of time.  DRINKABILITY: This was unquestionably the best, most memorable Russian Imperial Stout I've tasted. This is definitely a sipping beer, but by the end I found myself wishing I could stay for another. Such repeatability in a big beer like this is rare, at least for me. The brewmaster deserves high praise indeed for melding the flavors so as to make this a relatively smooth, easy drinking beer. Would I buy it again? In a New York minute!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,tbraun1,3.7,"12oz can to pint glass  Appearance - Pours black as motor oil, minimal carbonation, and coffee colored head that settles quickly.  Smell - Roasty, chocolaty, caramelly malts...can also smell the alcohol on this one faintly.  Taste - Smoky on the onset but finishes somewhat bitter and hoppy. The alcohol is there but does not overpower the other flavors. I also pickup some of the roasted coffee/espresso flavors that others have described.  Mouthfeel - Pleasant mouthfeel with some lingering flavors that coat your mouth. Very complex flavor profile with subtle nuances in every sip.  Drinkability - This would be a nice dessert beer right along side a piece of german chocolate cake.

2681,34483,Hellabeerguzzler,4.15,"First time I tried this, I could believe such a thick, chewy brew could come from a can. This beer has some weight to it - and some serious calories I'm sure.  Pitch black with deep brown head. Settles pretty quick with just a ring arount the pint glass this was poured into. There was plenty sticking to the side of the glass, in fact, as I finished it the clear glass was a shade of brown.  Smells rich caramel, roasted malt and other grains. Didn't get the chocolate/coffee thing many are saying. Just a very real RIS. It's not a chocolate stout or a milk stout, this beer is just plain stout.  Tastes delicious. Caramelized sugar and burnt malt with some booze lingering around. Not too hot though but a year should do this beer fine.  Mouthfeel is syrupy and thick. Leaves a coating on your tongue like it does the glass.  Drinkability is good. Although 1 would be plenty satisfying, you could do 2-3 with ease. Goes down sugary sweet with a burnt finish and touch of alcohol.  It's just a great example of the style.

Head disappeared quickly and lacing was slight but present.  S: caramel, roasted barley, brown sugar.  T: Nice mix of chocolate and barley and the bitterness of the chocolate is well balanced. Not sure by what; perhaps some vanilla? If so it's not at all overpowering.  M: creamy, full bodied lingering taste that holds on for quite some time. Little aftertaste included but that which does hold on is welcomed.  D: unbelievably drinkable beer for a beer with an abv north of 10%.

Cannot see any carbonation. Nice alcohol legs left on the glass, but not much lacing. S) Very rich aroma. Deep chocolate, espresso and roasted malt notes. I don't pick up any alcohol, despite the 10.5% abv. T) Roasted malt with a huge finish. Big chocolate and espresso notes, a bit of alcohol in the finish. Really nice beer. Big flavor. Nice lingering espresso bitterness. M/D) Full body, very thick and syrupy. Very smooth with very little carbonation. Drinks almost like a imperial stout shake. Very drinkable for such a high abv beer. Not very sessionable, but I have no trouble at all drinking this beer.  Wow, what a beer!

Flavor is also more like the Belgian strong dark ale, with rich dark chocolate cake, cherries and prunes. There is a very slight roasted malt character. No noticeable bitterness.  Finishes quite dry in the mouth despite the fruit in the flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy. Alcohol level is not really noticeable.

Was excited to see that. Thats a stout pouring for you.  Smell- I get booze, molasses, dark fruits and roasted malt.  Taste- It's a little cold so I think the flavors are muted on this. Very roasted malt with a creamy smoothness. Suprising chocolate flavors burst during the drink with some dark fruits more leaning towards raisins and slightly bitter.  Mouth- Full bodied thats for sure. A nice medium carb level with a slighly creamy texture and a slight roasty/bitter taste. Get a little pepper in there as well.  Drink- It's big from a small can. I could see myself drinking all 4, blacking out and asking WTF just happened? Very tasty beer though.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

T&M: mocha chocolate in a french roast. the roast is delicious. definitely bitter, but not to the point of acidic. not getting any alcohol, which is greatly appreciated. a smoothness of melted butter. just a touch of fiz on this towering body makes it a great sipper and the ultimate dessert brew.  D: thick, rich, and delicious. a little lighter on the carbonation then im used to for the style, but works well on such a meaty body. i know i said this would be a great dessert beer, but right now im using it as an appetizer and loving it. get some.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,afksports,4.25,"""This dog'll hunt."" Yowee. Never was anything so true. Let's go find some meat!  Enjoyed this brew aged about 6 months. It pours pitch black and thick. Dessert in a 12oz can.  Looks as dark as night, and still has a decent tan head for a Russian Imperial Stout of this thickness and gravity. The beer smells of alcohol, bread, rich malts, and surprisingly - hops. On its initial taste it's sorta underwhelming. Coffee and chocolate malt notes that you'd expect in a RIS, and it follows with a tiny hops bite. But as it warms, that taste gets richer and richer, includes some dark fruits, then gets thicker and thicker, and my belly gets warmer and warmer (fatter and fatter?).  It's a full-bodied brew with good carbonation and it leaves an impression that sticks even when it's finished. Not the most drinkable beer out there, but easily the best RIS I've had from a can. Even at the $3.50 or $4 price point that you often see it.  Yowee. (Again, for good measure).",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Janderson91,4.15,"Had this on-tap at Taco Mac in Atlanta on February 19. Review from notes.  A - Pours absolutely opaque black with a small pretty dark brown head. Leaves very little lacing but could have been because of a bad pour.  S - Chocolate. Some roasted malts and also a very slight hop aroma but mostly bittersweet dark chocolate.  T - Taste follows the nose. Extremely chocolatey which gives way to a good roasty flavor toward the back. Actually finishes relatively dry for the richness of the beer. Leaves a good hoppy, roasty, dark chocolate flavor.  M/D - This has one of the thickest bodies of any beer I've had. It works though. Ten FIDY is incredibly rich and therefore it's a definite dessert beer and drinkability is pretty low.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Aroma: Gives of hints of chocolate and espresso. I smell faint hops as well. Mouth-feel. This beer coats the palate quite well. Taste: Sweet, boozy but not overly bitter. I can also taste a bit of the can, but surprisingly, this does not bother me. This beer is extremely well balanced. Final thoughts: This is a definite must for any imperial stout fan. This beer is worth every penny of the five dollars I paid for it. I will certainly buy a few more cans to age.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,gabedivision,4.52,"Finally Ten-Fidy! Poured from a can to a snifter glass.  A- Often i have people say to me ""how can you drink that stuff it looks like motor oil"" when ever they see a beer thats not yellow, i disregard it usually. In this case, this looks and pours like motor oil. Nice black, creamy opaque flow, with a thin laced brown head.  S- Big chocolate malt, big fruity figs and dates and plums come to my nose. Vanilla on the tip topped with a slight coffee touch. The alcohol adds a different smell to the mix, strong but not offensive, gives it an almost olive-type aroma. Truly a treat.  T- Chocolates, fruits, malts, sweet and hearty. Sugary sweet alcohol finish, very complex, very well put together.  M- Full bodied, as a imperial stout should, low carbonation, very smooth and easy to forget its 10.5%.  D- Great! But no way im having more than one of these, delicious and well put together.

2681,34483,Pellinore1,4.42,"Thanks to Mora2000 for sending this can.  I have never before seen something so dark and thick pour from a can. It settles into the glass gently, producing just a bit of brown head. This eventually fades completely, leaving an inky black surface.  The smell is all big, dark malt, as I expect from a RIS. It's a bit sweet, and reminds me of chocolate, molasses, and prune.  The flavor starts with molasses and chocolate, but finishes with some very nice, bitter roastiness.  Full and creamy, with little carbonation.  This goes down way too smoothly, with very well hidden alcohol. Even so, the intensity of flavor and fullness of body makes this a definite sipper.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,haazer,4.59,"Canned on 10/25/2010. Poured this can into my Swashbuckler pint glass.  A- Thin layer of brown caramel head forms and dissapates quickly. I brought this home in my car over some very shitty PA pothole roads that may have bumped this around and oxidized it a bit. The beer itself is a motor oil viscous, completely black beer.  S- Enticing chocolate and caramel aroma's at first. Chocolate mostly. Smokey roasted malts are a plenty, combined with a little bit of heat and great scents of vanilla. Lastly there are some faint distinctions of coffee. Amazing smelling RIS. After letting this warm some I even got some dark fruit aromas. This bumped it to a 5 for me.  T- Almost the same as the nose. I detect the heat and vanilla flavor first. The malts stand out strongly in the flavor. They make their presence known midway through, with a medium roast blend that goes well into coffee. Lasting flavor at the end and leaves an aftertaste is the chocolate.  M- The viscosity from the pour makes for a closer to full mouthfeel. Syrupy thick, yet velvety smooth on the tongue. Little bit of heat but not astringent at all.  D- Everything about this beer makes it easily drinkable. If not for the heat this would be quaffable. I think the appearance could've been a lot better had I driven home more carefully, but I blame PA roads. Great tasting, sweet aromas, and superb mouthfeel.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Northjames,4.3,"12 oz can.  This pours blacker than almost anything I've seen.  The smell is overwhelming molasses with some caramel notes. I don't detect alot of hops in the nose.  There is a huge molasses punch to this beer up front, fading to a balanced bitterness. Similar to Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout. The alcohol is just barely detectable.  Mouthfeel is a strongpoint. This is a smooth and silky beer. Almost milky.  I could have 2 of these, but I'm not sure about more.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,websherpa,4.64,"I've had this beer before and really enjoyed it. Reviewing a can with noteable dents in it. Hope the contents are ok...  Appearance: Black, no transperency. Modest 1/2 finger brown head. Interestingly on the edges the thick black color of the beer seems to creep up into the head. Lacing just from the head melting. All signs indicate thick and and full beer. I've seen other review with more head, and I really wish I had more. It looks phenomenal, I'm just not getting a lot.  Smell: This smells complex. There is a musty roasty-ness that prevails through all the flavors. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it reminds me of the wonderful smells of a leather shop. Vanilla is probably the most forward but there is a lot in here. Chocolate maybe some nuts. Coffee is there but way back. There is a balancing bitterness and maybe that is the prevailing mustiness. I'm positive I'm not picking out everything Definitely booze in there too.  Taste: Just delicious. I could try to pick out all the flavors, but it's so much nicer to sit back and let the ensemble do it's job. Appreciate the complete picture. Look at the smell for the components, but the well executed blend of all the above parts is why this beer is so delicious. The alcohol is actually very well hidden. You know it's a big beer based on the flavor, it's not what I could boozy. As the beer warms I get some pipe tobacco smoke flavors. Just wonderful.  Mouthfeel: It's thick as expected. It washes over the mouth and stays there. Fresh out of the can it's slightly over carbonated but if you sip, it hits it's stride about halfway through the beer. I'm no expert. As the beer warms the alcohol kicks in at the end of the beer. The tobacco flavors are enhanced by the dry finish.  Drinkability: The flavor sticks with you and does not demand the next drink. Still there is nothing stopping you. It's rich without being overwhelming. You can sip on this for an evening, or it can be a candidate in a evening filled with drinking assuming the other offerings aren't quite as tall.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,codsmith,4.02,"Appearance - It was a very nice deep, dark black with a slight head on it from the can.  Smell - This is by far the favorite part of this beer for me. it has an amazing feminine smell to it that I have never smelt in a beer... a little weird at first, but it really makes you want to drink it. No hoppy or grainy smell, this is very hard to describe.  Taste - it starts with nice deep tones and milds out in the middle. The end is really where your smell and flavor kick in and take you for a ride to the end. Nice and deep body with full flavor  Mouthfeel - It start out light, but ends feeling a little heavy in the mouth at the end.

S: Almost like Irish cream with good chocolate milk or hot chocolate going on here. A slight earthiness has to be coming from the hops. A very slight artificial sweetener is a little off-putting, but otherwise everything is good. T: Dark chocolate, nice burnt sticky caramel roast that lingers with a crisper hoppiness in the alcohol that's like rum. This is thick and packed full of roasted goodness. It reminds me of an Expedition with more caramel. This certainly redeemed the smell. M: Sticky with a creamy carbonation. Pretty good. D: Not too bad. More than a can or two would be too much.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Wadsey,3.9,"I received this can of Ten Fidy in a trade with discovalante65 February or March of '09, so it is at least two years old. Thanks, Andrew!  Can cracks open quite quietly. Hard-poured into my DFH signature glass at cellar temperature.  A: Ten Fidy is appropriately black and presents a little layer of milk-chocolate head. The pour and the way the beer rests in the glass indicate Ten Fidy has a massively thick body.  S: Mega roasted malts, specifically chocolate and black, are joined by crystal malts, which add dried fruits, especially raisins, but not much caramel.  T: A flash of sweetness and then roast, dark chocolate and dried fruits assert themselves. A bit of coffee, probably suggested by the huge roastiness, which just borders burnt and lingers long into the finish. A muted bitterness also appears, making for a dry finish.  M: Exceptional. Fat, creamy mouthfeel. This is as close as beer gets to a milk shake. There is also a bit of grittiness, which doesn't necessarily detract from mouthfeel. Not really warming.  D: One is more than enough. I love sippers and Ten Fidy definitely falls in that category, but it is such a massive beer that I labored for at least two hours to get through 12 ounces.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BarrytheBear,4.34,"Another single purchased to verify or nullify previous experiences with the fidy. Canned on 11/11/10.  12 oz black can dumps a pretty motor oil consistency into an eager snifter. Somehow this looks more bad ass coming from a can, though the whole idea of good beer coming from a can is long gone. A thin cinnamon veil hides itself along a thin ring hugging the glass, while sticky amoeba lace patterns itself throughout. The result is a very pretty beer.  Smell is a letdown. No matter the temperature variance, there remains a smore chocolate/graham cracker note. While this is not unappealing, it's not nearly as complex or varied as I'd hoped.  Graham crackers, cinnamon, and fat black cherries (thankfully, those are the best kind) lead to a hop pop at the finish. The bittersweet cherry twang, along with the hops, leave a mild bitter finish that hangs around. More towards the sweet/dark fruitiness than I would prefer, but overall, quite solid.  Mouthfeel is thick and rich with a low/moderate carbonation that allows everything here to sit, settle, and linger. I wish more stouts achieved this sensation.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

There was a thin, chocolate colored head that lasted about thirty seconds, and then it retreated to just a ring of film. The beer has aromas of coffee and toffee, but also some booze. The flavors are milk chocolate, coffee, and smoke. Some bits of sweet malt/molasses and some bitter characteristics, as well, and of course a bit of alcohol. As it warms, you get some dark fruity sweet flavors, also. The beer is heavy and thick in mouth. Very viscous and lingering in the mouth, which is fantastic given the amazing flavor combination. The finish is creamy and smooth, despite the alcohol flavors. Aftertaste of bitter coffee. The beer is extremely smooth and easy to drink, and fabulous on a cold night.

A: Can cracks without the usual hiss, a somewhat unsettling event if I do say so myself. Ten FIDY pours like motor oil into my goblet, with a chocolatey head that quickly disappears.  S: Deep molasses, creme brulee, and coconut give way to a touch of banana. This is fantastic.  T: Somewhat sweet, and entirely enjoyable, all of the notes indicated in the nose are present, and rounded out with hints of espresso. Thoroughly enjoyable.  M: Full body, chewy, and a touch sticky, with no carbonation to save your palate from the onslaught of flavor.  D: Absolutely enjoyable through-and-through. This is everything an RIS should be, and is widely available. The price is a bit high, but I kind of like that.

2681,34483,BirdsandHops,4.05,"Doing a side by side of a can from 11-11-10 and from 9-25-09--the ranking goes to the better of the two.  A: Both pour a thick, jet black with about a finger of dense, dark brown head. It fades into a thin brown cap with some decent lacing.  S: The aged can has an odd chalky, graham cracker-like scent to it. Behind that is some more subtle sweet chocolate and coffee. The fresh can smells of roasted malt up front followed by dark chocolate and more bitter coffee. I have to hand the smell to the fresh can.  T: The aged can is packed full of semi-sweet chocolate with some coffee and darker chocolate aftertaste. A bit of the graham shows up in the aftertaste, but not much. The fresh can hits you with dark, roasted malts and coffee up front with a bit of dark chocolate. The aftertaste has a decent hop kick along with bitter coffee. I tend to prefer more coffee and bitter flavors, but the aged can hasn't mellowed so much that they're gone. With the odd graham aftertaste, though I prefer the fresh can.  M: The aged can has a heavy body with little carbonation--thick and creamy. The fresh can also has a heavy body but has more carbonation to it, which goes well with the coffee and bitterness. I'll have to give the upper hand slightly to the fresh can, but again it's because I prefer the coffee flavors a bit more.  D: The aged can is very smooth and goes down more easily than the fresh can, which has more carbonation and bitterness. The upper hand here goes to the aged can.  Overall, I prefer the fresh can but the aged one is by no means bad. I enjoy the hoppy and coffee flavors of the fresh beer more than the smooth, chocolaty flavors of the aged.

Smells of chocolate, soy sauce, sweet, caramel and a bit of smoke. Tastes of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted, the soy flavor shows through but not too overbearing or anything.

2681,34483,tewaris,3.84,"2010 vintage poured into a New Belgium globe on 02/07/2010  Pours very very dark brown and looks jet black in the glass with a big, dark brown head that rose up in cascades. The head took a long time to fall into a thinner cap and laced the glass beautifully.  The aroma on Ten Fidy leans more towards burnt, roasted notes, that were almost meaty. As it warmed up, the alcohol got noticeable, but that's alright.  This beer is about the powerful presence of roasted malts. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of dark fruit notes but roast and hop bitterness rule this beer.  At this point, I am going to drink some water and a small sip of Scotch to clear my tastebuds before proceeding with the scores... alright, all done!  Ten Fidy is chocolate like bittersweet, slightly acidic, and rich, with sweetness coming (seemingly) more from alcohol than from sugars. Low on carbonation, high on silkiness, the roast doesn't affect the thick mouthfeel negatively. A very delicious aftertaste of roasted coffee beans lingers after a medium finish. Could and would drink more of it. Good stuff!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,brewcat,4.31,"A complex imperial stout to be sure. First, in a can. I realize that several craft brewers have either moved entirely over to the can or some portion. However, to find such a complex, rich, and refined libation contained with these aluminum walls is a departure for sure.  Pours a perfect imperial blackness. Looks like someone replaced my fizzy yellow beer with 10/40. nice mocha head results. Aroma is bitchin. I get a bouquet of molasses, brown sugar, and soy sauce. Also kinda get some hot tar roof, band-aid, saran wrap notes. Things definitely improve as this brew warms and breaths.  Taste matches the aroma nicely. Rich balance of the sweetness is matched be an assertive bitterness. Something else pops as i contemplate this one further. Anise or black licorice comes through rather subtly as I swish. Finishes with a lingering bitterness that is both pleasant and restrained.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,chicagobeerriot,4.15,"Ink-black with an apparent motor oil consistency, Ten Fidy is crowned with an inch and a half of mocha-colored head that slowly settles to a thin film. Swirling creates some impressive ""legs"" that slowly slide down the side of your glass.  On the sweet-to-char continuum, Ten FIDY treats the nose to more of the char and espresso notes while keeping the molasses and baker's chocolate in a supporting role. Smoke and wood flavors provide a nice bacon-like undertone.  Mouthfeel is downright thick. Darklord aficionados will feel right at home as this viscous ""beershake"" coats the back of your throat. There's enough carbonation to prevent the weight from being unpleasant, but make no mistake: this is a very full-bodied beer even compared to its impy brethren.  Espresso and dark chocolate form the flavor foundation, while some molasses, faint dark fruit, light smoke and tobacco provide some welcome complexity. A slight tangy astringency at the finish takes a bit away from an otherwise first-rate example of the style.  While I'd never describe the heavyweights of this category to be highly ""drinkable,"" Ten FIDY does what it needs to do to avoid demerits here: it hides its alcohol reasonably well, doesn't overwhelm the palate with repeated sips and doesn't smother you with its oil-slick consistency.

Appearances were pretty similar, both Black as night with a milk chocolate colored head, the only real difference being the 09 had a good bit of head and the 08 was noticeably smaller.  Aromas were also similar with lots of chocolate and burnt roast. The major difference here was notes of alcohol that was present in the 09 but not in the 08.  The differences in the taste were more noticeable, bot had lots of chocolate, but the bitter roast was much smoother in the 08 and had more of a bite in the 09. There was also a bite from the alcohol in the 09 that had vanished from the 08.  Mouthfeel was thick and viscous in both with moderate carbonation. Both of these are enjoyable, and I'd like to try it against one that is really fresh, but it seems that once Ten Fidy hits the 2 year mark, it really smooths out and takes things to the next level.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The initial flavors were sweet with a deep roasted caramel, dark chocolate and roasted coffee.The roast lasted nicely in the after taste and the alcohol was masked fairly well. The alcohol gave a nice warming of the nose feel. This beer was full bodied and lightly carbonated.  Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Well rounded in flavor and complex.

The taste is delicious on so many levels. Nice big malt flavors, chocolate, roasted coffee, caramel.

After folding and buying 2 cans, I can say that is one of my favorite stouts to drink.  This brew pours a creamy pitch black into the glass with a dark chocolately brown 2 finger head. Carbonation looks adequate and with no issue, the thick brew begged me to take a first sip  Immediately upon pouring, I could smell the dark chocolate and smokey coffee notes, with a background of vanilla and bourbon. No acrid ether smell as the goodness hid any alcohol from reaching the nose  The flavor was quite amazing and surprising. Although as with most imperial stouts I enjoy, the chocolate and coffee notes are readily apparent, though quite balanced and didn't try to overtake each other. This is a true and bold Imperial stout.  Being that it is a true stout, it was thick and found it was best enjoyed around room temperature. If not, I thought the cold brought out a slight metallic aftertaste, coming from the canned home. This beer is smooth as jazz and easy to gulp down. The 10.5% is masked perfectly, and you're welcomed with an exceeding warmness in the belly as you finish the first can.  And as far as drinkability, I had 3 in my sitting, savoring each one better the the preceding brew. I was safe at home so no driving for me, and had only planned on two with dinner.

The head is thick, frothy, and burnt caramel in color. Aromas of brown sugar, roasted coffee, and warm fudge brownies have my attention. Flavors of chocolate covered toffee and roasted malt hit you right up front, then comes bitterness from the hops, all rounded out and mellowed by the oats. FIDY has a rich, creamy body and while the carbonation is light, this helps to keep the beer smooth (like a milkshake). The 10.5% ABV isn't overpowering, but adds a nice warming sensation. This is definitely one of the bigger, better Stouts made in Colorado, and the drinkabiltiy is still quite friendly.  Dark chocolate goes especially well with imperial stouts, and this is easily going to be the best pairing with Ten FIDY. A chocolate ricotta pie is a really delicious treat anytime, but an intense stout will compliment the creamy, richness of the pie. Use high quality dark chocolate and farmstead ricotta if you can, then you'll never eat a regular cheesecake again. If you would prefer a savory pairing, try it with a chocolate mole sauce over duck. I never said it had to be dessert... it's the chocolate that matters!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,HeadwatersFinest,4.33,"Thank you for the cans Oskar Blues, and the 12 oz serving size. This being my second can, I reminded myself to pour vigorously in order to enjoy a nice two finger mocha head above the black, thick body.  Aroma is faint for such a big beer - Slight smokiness, very slight booziness, and a light leafy hop presence.  T - The flavor is where this beer really kicks off. Bittwersweet chocolate and slightly sweeter chocolate cake, with more smoke, molasses and a leafy hop presence in the back. Outstanding. Not getting the fruits that other reviewers got, but the beer doesn't suffer for it.  M - Thick mouth, coats the tongue, low carbonation, but some, and no carbonic bite.  D - At 10.5%, I wouldn't have more than two, but for the style, this is excellent, I will go back for another.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The dark chocolate smells very, very rich.  Much like the scent, the taste has tons of chocolate. It's like drinking a decadent chocolate cake. It's delicious. Moderate hop bite in the finish that finishes with roasted malt and fresh coffee. Great chewy mouthfeel. Flavor never seems watery and either does the beer's body.  Such a great surprise. I got a few cans for christmas and I've been enjoying it like crazy. Also my 1st craft beer in a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,mmmbeer,3.85,"12 oz. can that is over two years old; brewed with flaked oats, two-row, chocolate and roasted malts and hopped to 98 IBUs. It pours very thickly, deep black, with a tiny collar of dark tan foam that leaves a bit of lacing. Lots of hops in the nose give way to very roasty dark malts that contribute bitter chocolate, coffee and blackberry. The flavor starts with charred malt, almost too much so, with tobacco and old leather that then moves to green, citric and spicy hops which shift the balance too far to the bitter and hoppy. Very thick and full, dry and rich, with a long bitter finish. The alcohol is very well-hidden, but this style should be more about the malts than the flavor and bitterness of the hops.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,SirRuss,4.58,"A - It seems Exxon have just got into the beer business: thick, sticky, blacker than black gold spills between the can and glass in viscous slow motion. As the slick gathers, its inkiness shows no flaws, and although the head lacks height, it's depth of chocolatey color makes up for the skinniness.  S - Simplistic and mild, yet finds some retribution in its depth. The profile exhibits fragile hops flailing like sticky fish bogged down in an encompassing dark creamy chocolatiness. Contrary to general expectations of unidimensional aromas, the ruthless omnipotence of the malts somehow entice the senses rather than disappoint them with their singularity. Sniff at it again a little while later when it's warmed, and whiskey-toffee wafts roll from within lending a long awaited complexity that places this brew an echelon beyond its former self.  T - Somewhere between the nose and palate a lit match has been flicked into the mix, igniting the latent volatility of that deep inky blackness. The malts suddenly take on a multifaceted personality as roasty espresso and charcoal notes coalesce with the original milk-chocolaty creaminess, which serves as an effectively charismatic ring-leader. As the brew warms, further layers of complexity emerge, with vanilla pod, bourbon, and a final green chilli spiciness confessing their roles before the international inquiry is through. The hops also express undeniable guilt, but they are the token tricky characters who use the brawn of the roasted bitterness to create an ambiguous involvement.  M - This brew's creamy nature is perpetuated in its mouthfeel, and if weren't for a robust carbonation, the whole experience would probably claim the drinker as another oil-laden victim of this sticky spill. But the carbonation is there, and does an amazing job of cleaning the thickness from the palate allowing the impenetrably dark flavors to be enjoyed rather than feared.  D - Diligence stipulates that any review contemplating a 9.5% stout with 110million% viscosity and a shit load of dark candy goodness, should proclaim the drinkability factor close to ""HAZMAT"". But I'm going to leave that compliant conclusion to be fulfilled by every other investigator, and simply state that Ten Fidy is a blow-you-away brew, which I admittedly wouldn't start drinking until the end of an evening, but could happily keep sipping until the birds start singing...or spluttering, and drowning.  0 - This is a great transitional brew that really opens up as it warms in your hand. If Oskar Blues operated oil rigs, the next Gulf Coast spill would have Texas paying OB billions of dollars, and the international outcry would be replaced by an elated global cheer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

I have not read anything on this beer but I picked it up after seeing that it received an ""A"" rating so with that in mind here goes....  Pours black, I mean friggin dark and a beautiful head on it. Very thick & frothy. Smells great, not overly strong or boozy. I know this is where all the hoity toity reviewers get all ""presence of currants and plums with the chocolatey gooey goo filling my proboscis"". I can tell you this, I have drank MORE than my fair share of stouts and this one smells like some shit I'm gonna like...REALLY promising.  Flavor:Delicious, really. Thick and creamy in the mouth very nice, thick mouthfeel. It's got all of the great flavor characteristics of thngs like the Bells Expedition and Stone Imperial Stout.  The flavor lasts in your mouth for a loooong time after swallowing this brew. The one thing is it almost tastes ""hot"" like I thought it may be the alcohol burn which is so strong...not like the other great stouts that I mentioned before so I am not sure.  I did not let it cool enough, probably, as I was really excited to drink this swill as I have never seen it before but had heard it mentioned so maybe that's the alcohol burn as its pretty warm. Did they brew it with chili's? That would be good to know. Things hot though. I guess if you're cold, slam a couple of these and be warmed right up.  Great stout except for that burn at the end. Anyone else get that or am I just a freakin weirdo? I'm knocking off points for that burning my throat dammit. It does leave streaks all over the glass too but all the hoity toity's like that so I won't dock it for that.  I'm gonna go with a B+ as I would drink it again but I'm not gonna drive all over creation looking for it like I did all day today. Maybe the Oskar company will re-imburse me for the gas money I blew driving a friggin Ford F150 all over and gas at $3.10 / gallon. Okay guys go ahead and send me a two six packs of that Dales that I've heard good things about and we'll call it even. Just make sure it doesn't burn my friggin throat though, okay?  Hope this helps. I'm drinking it as I write this to get the ""live action"" thoughts on this hence the rambling. And yes, this is my first beer of the day so I'm not loaded and reviewing (yet!) I'll see what else I can get in me this evening and maybe do a couple more reviews as I get more and more loaded. Wait until you see how my spelling gets after 6 of these!

2681,34483,KickInTheChalice,4.36,"Poured from a 12 oz. can into a tulip. Thanks to SalukiAlum for sending me this.  Appearance: Ten Fidy pours a deep mahogany that does not relent, even at the edges. A full, creamy coffee colored head forms on the initial pour, gradually receding to a ring around the glass and an island in the middle. Spots of lace decorate the glass.  Smell: Tons of roasted and chocolate malt. Espresso really helps the aroma along. There is some bitter aroma not attributed to the coffee; maybe light pine or earthy hops.  Taste: There are a ton of great flavors working together here, and it is slightly different than the ultra-roasted RIS. This has the roasted malt, espresso, and chocolate flavors to be sure, but there is also the dark fruit working in the background that adds a nice depth. Alcohol is lightly noticeable, with the finish exhibiting mostly a coffee bitterness. There is a further bitterness here that is tough to identify - light earthy hops and a bit of pine as well. The finish reminds me mostly of coffee.  Mouthfeel: Dark, smooth, and creamy, with barely a noticeable crisp carbonation to keep me honest. Really, just smooth, silky, and enjoyable.  Drinkability: I could tell after the first sip that this was a beer I could drink all night.

Snifter pour and I am met with a black as night ale and a huge mocha colored foamy head that stays and produces a nice lace on the glass. Bittersweet chocolate, cocoa, roasted malts and charleston chew aroma. Awesome stuff. Chocolate malt taste with dark chocolate on the swallow and a lingering toffee/black coffee on the buds. The mouthfeel is slick...oily and silky. Goes down waaaay smooth. The drinkability is great for a 10.5% though more than two will get you to la-la land pretty quickly.  Great, great stuff.

2681,34483,zoso1967,4.32,"Canned on 10/25/10  Ten Fidy pours a thick looking black brown with just a touch of brownish amber showing at the edges of the liquid. There is really no head on this beer at all, but the very small ring of foam around the edge is medium tan. Lacing is decent, but nothing special.  The nose is quite sweet, but also full of roasty goodness. There is a pretty big dose of milk chocolate that melds with a more bitter chocolate character and some coffee. Caramel is also quite apparent, as is a bit of vanilla.  The flavor comes through as a bit more roasty, but still possesses plenty of sweetness. The taste starts off like a caramel and chocolate shake and transitions into a coffee spiked with bitter cocoa. It is a pretty unique taste that changes as I let the beer marinade in my mouth before swallowing. Some hop bitterness comes through in the end, but I find it hard to appreciate any sort of hop flavor.  The mouthfeel is definitely in the full zone, but at the same time it does not quite feel chewy like some big stouts. The carbonation is definitely low. It is a bit sticky and coats the palate. The finish is a sort of mix of caramel and coffee notes.  Ten Fidy drinks quite well for its size and strength. I did not detect any alcohol and aside from the thick and coating nature it has, I found this to be very drinkable. It is a little different than your usual imperial stout. This is a beer that I will certainly re-visit.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Roasty and somewhat mild aroma of licorice, chocolate malt, molasses, and a bit of sweet fig.  Moderate carbonation offsets and enhances a thick, creamy mouthfeel. Sweet caramel and molasses flavors followed by smooth espresso and dark chocolate. Slightly warm boozy finish with hints of vanilla, smoke, and long-lingering roasty bitterness.

The dark brown, slightly lacy head looks like a chocolate mousse perched upon a black pillar, until it quickly fades to a tiny ring.  S- The aroma is nice, but fairly simple. Rich, dark chocolate, roasted malt, molasses and cafe´au lait. Strong ethanol. But wait... sometimes after a vigorous swirl & sniff, there is a Fir bud/grapefruit blast that escapes from the black dungeon and reaches your olfactory receptors, and says ""I'm buried in here!""  T- Big, rich, dense, extracted, super-concentrated flavors of chocolate cake. Chocolate covered raisins, almonds, and espresso beans. Hops bitterness is within balance of the body & sweetness. Thankfully, the roast was rich but without any burnt char, and I greatly welcome that fact. Long, lingering, sweet chocolate finish.  M- Creamy, viscous, velvety, with a tacky feel. Big, opulent, voluptuous feel and structure. Big and bold.  D- The ABV is mostly buried beneath an avalanche of malt and chocolate structure, but became quite apparent only upon hitting the back of the throat, as it teamed with the CO2 & hops bitterness to give a scouring effect.

Appearence- Couldn't pour very fast as it was the consistency of motor oil. The head was almost non-existent, but with a few swirls, a tiny, chocolate milkshake-like head appeared and remained. Of all the stouts I've reviewed, they all have had a reddish tint around the edges of the bottom of the glass...NOT THIS BEER!!! Completely black all the way through, and the head looked an orangeish, blood-like color through the glass ( Looked like a chocolate milkshake without looking through the glass). I put my finger in it out of curiosity and had the consistency of a milkshake as well.  Smell- chocolate and maybe molasses. Very sweet aroma. Taste- syrup. Full bodied all the way across the sky! Again, like I was drinking a milkshake. Heard it referred to like drinking cough syrup. Very fulfilling and enjoyable feel.  Aftertaste- I don't know cuz I'm drunk! Nah, it was very smooth and laced your tongue and throat with a nice chocolate flavor saver.  Conclusion- Toughest looking stout I have ever seen. The Ten Fidy looks like you're getting ready to be beat into a gang. It's a no bullshit stout. It just about stained my pint glass.

Nothing unique for the style but very pleasant nonetheless  incredibly smooth, alcohol is not noticeable at all. Roasted flavors + bitter chocolate, strong malt in the back. This beer is serious business. I'm an imperial stout lover and I find this to be an amazing one, well balanced and flavorful but not too complex for its own good: no stray flavors that overpower the others such as what is seen in certain barrel aged stouts (not that I have anything against barrel aged stouts)  Creamy, but not extremely thick/chewy as one might find some stouts to be. Very little carbonation. The low carbonation does not detract from this beer at all, in fact it helps the mouthfeel for this style of beer in my opinion.  Almost too drinkable for its own good at 9.5%. This might be because it's near the end of my night, but I feel that this beer is ridiculously smooth and there is no noticeable alcohol flavor.

Smells of roasted malts, fantastic burnt chocolates, fruits, and figs. In all regards, I'm salivating at this point to just get my nose into the glass.  Wow, this is almost like a beer milkshake. It's extremely chewy texture makes this the thickest beer I've had to date. Seems to be mostly devoid of carbonation; but that's not a complaint! It adds to the character of the beer; the taste isn't too strong, but it is very far from weak. It's syrupy consistency tastes of malts, roasted grains, bitter chocolate, and hints of cherry.  Overall, for how thick it is, this is an extremely drinkable beer. For those who aren't fond of the thickest of beers, I'd advise to steer clear, because this syrupy monster almost needs to be cut with a knife. Overall an extremely fabulous beer.

2681,34483,jims4210,4.2,"Stopped by Craft Beer Outlet in NE Philly and bought a mix six and the guy behind the counter asked me if I'd tried Ten Fidy yet. I hadn't ( usually stay far, far away from beer in a can), but he assured me that I'd love it. One word. Wow! That's a lot of beer in a little can...  Appearance was black like motor oil and the pour was a satisfying glug. Guess I'm not used to pouring from a can, but it worked. Tan head which didn't stick around, but left nice lacing to the end.  Smell was malty, with chocolate and coffee dominating.  Taste was really intense. Chocolately. Nice warming from the alcohol.  Mouthfeel was superb. Velvety with little carbonation, thick like a shake. Wonderful.  Drinkability was good. Couldn't have too many, drank like a meal, but I'll definitely be buying this again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,PEIhop,4.33,"Poured from a 12oz. can into a tulip glass.  A - Pours a beautiful jet black that is extremely viscous.  S - Intoxicating aroma of chocolate and dark roasted malts  T - One-dimensional lacking complexity, but the taste is absolutely captivating. The chocolate explodes upfront with molasses/dark fruit subtly interwoven into the finish. Delicious!  M - With a friend from Boulder, the pour and mouthfeel were becoming legendary. The mouthfeel is utterly unforgettable with its amazing creaminess and thickness. It delivered on all the hype.  D - Due to the detailed craftmanship, the alcohol is magnificently hidden within this surprisingly refreshing stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,dfclav,4.49,"Poured into a snifter. Gave in and bought a 4 pack after hearing all the hype. I've never tried this beer before because of my stubbornness to not buy cans.  A - pours jet black, this is darker than most of the stouts I have ever had the pleasure of trying. Very thin 1/2 finger red hued head. Decent cascade.  S - very rich complex chocolate, they used a lot of malt here and it stands out very nicely. Ingredients smell very fresh, the can just might be the answer! Dark fruits linger throughout.   T - huge silky chocolate, honestly the best chocolate profile I have ever tasted in a stout. Ripe dark fruits sit on the back of your tongue. Roasted malts and coffee sit in the back but make themselves noticed. Alcohol is noticed but very warm and pleasant. Fresh hop twang somehow very mellow from the oats I am guessing.  M - a little too syrupy for the style, very creamy and a little light on carbonation.  D - this is a very good stout and to answer the question, yes, it is worth picking up a 4 pack. This stout can be included in a session without destroying it in my opinion, because the profiles are intense but don't destroy the palate. IBU's hidden deceptively well behind huge malt. Well done!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,OBeerMeGreatOne,4.31,"Poured from a can into a goblet. Pours pitch black with no highlights, no real head either. The little bit it had looked like coffee colored soap suds. Zero lace. Smell: Super roasted malts, chocolate, figs, earth and a touch of the booze. Very nice. Taste/Mouth: Wonderful start with dark roasted chocolate, cherries, hay, expresso and maybe a touch of Anise. It is a little thin and there is zero carbonation. That would be one of the few minus points for the beer. Drink: For a big beer this is an easy sipper. I'm a bit bummed out by the body but all's forgiven when it comes to the taste.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

D - A very drinkable RIS. Nice work.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,diomz88,3.83,"Good smell like usual imperial stouts. Coffee, chocolates caramel, but not that strong. Black, as in pitch black, with half to an inch in head, brown to tan in color, and fades right away. Taste is great! The hop will kick in right away but goes away smoothly. It's creamy, a little sweetness to it, but overall it is a little light. Very, very drinkable, like drinking a milkshake.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,nihiloexnihil,4.33,"Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter.  A. Silky black darkness, which gives rise to a murky milky caramel-colored head. The head lasts for a few minutes with tons of lacing before disappearing into a rim around the edge of the surface.  S. The scent hits you as soon as the can is opened. Roasted malt, chocolate, dark roasted coffee.  T. The taste is smoky, dark, roasted malt with caramelized sugar. Even some lighter notes like wheat and barley, but absolutely no floral or fruity undertones. The alcohol gives it a warm rush in the middle of the body. Unfortunately, I can't ignore the slight metallic aftertaste that I can only assume comes from the can.  M. Silky, smooth, gorgeous mouthfeel. Perfect level of carbonation.  D. Heavy duty imperial stout, a serious beer. Hard to drink more than one or two, but since it's an imperial stout, that's just perfect. I'd put it right at the A-/A borderline.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Satchboogie,4.3,"12oz can (no freshness date) poured into a snifter  A: Pours pitch black, as black and opaque as a black hole. 1/2 inch dark brown frothy head that slowly dissipates into a thin froth.  S: Dark roasted malts, espresso notes, dark chocolate, char, maybe a little dark fruit.  T: The first thing that comes to mind is balance. Charred malt, espresso, dark chocolate, molasses. it's all there. It's incredibly creamy, almost has some milk chocolate like qualities. Not a single flavor dominates and it's all there from start to finish. The molasses is there and sweet enough to balance out the bitterness of the roasted malt, but not overpowering in the least bit. There's a little bit a licorice in the background. Alcohol soaked dark fruits pop up in the background in the finish. The hops are just visible in the background and contributes an earthy, almost smokey, taste (like fresh ground Kona AA coffee). This has just a little bit of an alcohol bite to it, and the finish warms with the beer. This might honestly be the smoothest Imperial Stout I've had yet.  M: Medium to light carbonation, the fullest and most viscous body imaginable. It's boarderline syrupy! The body coats everything. Oily and smooth, finish is fairly dry. A little more carbonation would help and a bit more creamy rather than oily would be nice.  D: Drinks better than the 10.5% ABV. I found myself gulping this and slowed down only to savor it. One of the most easily consumed IRS i've had.  Overall I had somewhat high expectations for this beer and it exceeded them by a long shot.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Mississipping,4.6,"12oz can poured into a Bruery snifter and served at 53 degrees. Thank OakedCanuck for the unexpected 4-pack!  A: Pours like clean motor oil with a nice glug from the can. I know, it's cliche, but it's a great descriptor. A small mocha head rises out of the pure blackness and then recedes almost as quickly, leaving traces of itself behind in moderate lacing and a thin ring.  S: A nutty chocolate smell dominates, with roasted malt, booze, coffee, and licorice (in descending order) in the background. Booze moves to the fore, though, as it warms, and the aroma becomes less balanced, but not unpleasant.  T: Sweet, chocolately milk taste really makes itself present at the beginning, followed by a moderate roastiness, and a slight booze burn on the back end, but not too much. Booze and a transition to bitter dark chocolate linger for longer than you'd expect.  M: Pretty full-bodied ... syrupy, slightly chewy. Completely coats the tongue, back of the teeth, roof, and throat. Perfect amount of carbonation that counterbalances the thickness to make it extremely smooth and much more drinkable than it might be with out the velvety bubbles.  D: This is not very drinkable, but I wouldn't want it any other way. The viscosity and alcohol content make this a sipper. The complexities change quite a bit as the temperature rises, so take your time with it and enjoy the complementary layers. Don't wait too long, though, unless you like a boozier stout.  This is really one one my favorites! Highly recommended and alway welcome at my place.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Dreadnaught33,4.4,"Had an 08, 09, and 10 all back to back. I'm rating the 08, since thats most interesting.  A: Really Dark color that seriously looks like spent motor oil, like toxic sludge that covers all parts of the glass. Nice lacing.  S: Burnt currants, fudge, prune, teriyaki, dark malt, and some alcohol detectable. Pretty nice over all.  T: Prune and cellar touches mix with an onslaught of burnt roasty flavors, malt, alcohol sweetness, soy sauce, candy like sweet touches, fudge. Great stuff.  M: Totally coating. No carbonation at all almost, but I enjoy it this way.  D: Great stuff, good drinkability but i can't see drinking too much sludge lest I become one of Captain Planets enemies.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S: Roasted malts a clearly present along with what I picked up as smelling similar to powdered sugar. Interesting, I know, but that's what it smelled like. Coffee and sweet chocolates follow with a hint of the alcohol on the back end.  T: Creamy, bitter chocolate is present almost immediately with some coffee present, but the taste is fairly dominated by the roasted malts, almost giving it a very very slight nuttiness. A bit of the alcohol is present on the finish here too.  M: Very viscous and creamy, with a little bit of carbonation which fits just right with this beer. The alcohol, again, on the finish.

The can pops with little fanfare, but the pour, my god, the pour, is thicker then anything I have ever seen, a black serpent pooling lusciously into the bottom or my Surly Darkness goblet. Pitch black glass of stout. No light shines. A finger thick milk chocolate head crowns this midnight oil. The smell is big for a stout, chocolate covered cherries and peanut butter, with some coffee. The taste is very nutty, with bittering hops, then peanuts, dark chocolate, some sour cherries and a dark roast coffee finish.

2681,34483,sprucetip,4.26,"Black, modest mocha head with some but not great retention. Does not appear to be all that active, but hard to tell due to the density of the blackness. No lacing to speak of. Looks like an imperial stout.  Roasty black malts is all I get at first....Some malty sweetness and light alcoholic notes are identifiable later, and it all works well together. Not especially complex, but it's pleasant.  Sweet malty backbone is clearly present right out of the gate, merging effectively with the flavors of the roasted grains and the medium bitterness coming from the dark grains and/or the hops. Booze is barely noticeable. Pretty danged well balanced, and very smooth.  Medium carbonation, medium/strong warming, very rich, thick viscosity, and some roasty bitterness in the finish.  Pretty easy drinking Imperial Stout. Smooth, balanced rich, tasty, and not too boozy. The roasty character, including the bitterness, is a key player, but not overdone. Really tasty.

S-- Big roasted malts, burnt coffee, big, thick chocolate with some cherry sweetness. Bold smell with some alcohol to this  T-- Burnt brown sugar, dark bitter chocolate, bitter coffee.  M-- Thick and rich. Pretty simple really. Finishes smooth with a bit of dark chocolate, coffee bitterness, and a small bit of cherry sourness. Long lasting flavor. Big rich feel and low carbonation.

Taste: Sweet fruits and nuts on the tongue, sweet malts and chocolate on the palate, and bitter dark chocolate going down. Strong roasted malt/coffee and toasted nut aftertaste.  Feel: Very thick and syrupy, but nicely carbonated. As with the coloring, still waters run deep.

The sweetness is well balanced by a coffee like bitterness. Did I mention dark chocolate? Oh man, so delicious, dark, and deep. Yum.  Silky like texture with a nice mix of low carbonation.

M: Pretty thick and syrupy, typical heavy feel. Not overwhelming, though.  D: Like I said, it's thick and sweet, but in spite of that a few would be perfect for a cold winter's night.

Aroma has lots of chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit and anise.  Taste is sweet and roasty, but dry on the backend. Starts fruity and molasses-like, finishes roasty and slightly boozy, though the 9.5 percent abv is pretty darn well hidden. Notes of cane sugar, dates, and both milk and dark chocolates. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, with smooth carb. Tasty beer here.  Overall, this is a very good stout. I'd like to see what a year in the cellar would do to this can. That's right: I'm aging a can of beer...  ... end of December 2010 -- Aged imperial stout in a can: check! Definitely a smoother beer, but still nice and roasty. Aroma has improved.

The taste is syrupy, thick bodied, more so than I would prefer, with tobacco flavors, masking the alcohol well, some malt, with a good finish.

Taste follows the nose pretty close. More smokiness again, still a slightly different finish...Kind of an odd slightly bitter taste in a weird kind of way. If it wasn't for that, I would score a lot higher on the taste. Thick, creamy, average carbonation. Average to slightly lower drinkability for the style.

Feel is full and viscous, befitting a brew of this ilk. Drinkability is fair given the ABV and magnitude of the beer, but I couldn't drink many of these in one sitting. I'll have no problem enjoying this 12 oz can, though. Another excellent beer from Oscar Blue. Perfect for a cold, rainy, Southern California evening. Cheers!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,kwjd,4.33,"Pours jet black with thin brown head. Some mild lacing. This beer just looks really thick somehow. Smells of huge roasted malt and bitter chocolate. Flavour is huge alcohol, bitterness and roast. The beer is quite thick for a mouthfeel. A completely awesome imperial stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,AdamBear,4.68,"A- Black with a lot of dark tan head  S-A lot of dark chocolate. Very sweet and malty.  T- Hits with a very smooth yet striking blast of dark malts with a hint of chocolate notes. The after-taste is bitter but it's a very welcomed bitterness. There is also a nice dose of mocha malts as well! This is a nice warm beer. The ABV note is present but minimal.  M-Very heavy, medium to low carbonation with a crisp finish.  D-Well its very thick, so its definitely a sipper. But wow I feel it might get better and better as it goes down. I hope to be getting this again some time soon!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Tucquan,3.95,"Had this on 2010-12-21 in Columbia, PA. A nice treat to have while warming by the fire.  A - Jet black with no head a just a few bubbles. A small bit of lacing. This is the thickest pouring beer I've ever seen.  S - Apparent but not super strong. Figs, raisins, smoke, roasted grain.  T - A flavor bomb. Smokey, dark roasted grain, dark chocolate, expresso, dried fruit that's been roasted on a charcoal grill, some molasses and vanilla sweetness, moderate astingency and some bitterness and earthiness from the hops to round it off. Aftertaste is very good, like an acrid latte. Impressive.  M - Very thick but not cloying at all. The alcohol helps dry off the ending sweetness.  D - I think one is enough at a time for me. Liked it quite well but didn't want a second one.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Teleweizen2,3.88,"From notes.  A - pours a deep, dark, opaque, motor oil color. It almost swallows light like a black hole. Has a thin film of the darkest foam I've ever seen on a beer but this dissipates rather quickly.  S - a very vinous nose. Lots of dark chocolate, dark fruit, burnt sugar, and a little smoke round out the aroma.  T - intensely bitter. Lots of burnt roasty flavors. Some herbal hops add to the bitterness. Some chocolate sweetness for balance. As it warms more dark fruit and alcohol flavors become apparent.  M - thick. Viscous. Those world only begin to describe the mouthfeel of this stout. Could use some more carb to smooth it out a bit.  D - a very aggressive brew. It took over 2 hours for me to finish the can. Not something to have often but on a cold night it would be a great treat.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Chaney,4.58,"A: Even as I poured the beer, the liquid that oozed out of the can was a murky, dark, chalk dust-filled, and pitch black. Once it hit the glass, the black lagoon was whole and did not take any prisoners! about a 1/4 finger dark reddish-brown head evaporated within seconds.  S: Coffee, chocolate, roasted barley, and dark fruit for sure, but I also got a hint of cherry. I got no indication that this was going to be a booze bomb in any way. As a matter of fact, I was amazed by how discipled the brew was in terms of tempered balance between the ingredients.  T: Not so much coffee on the taste, but plenty of chocolate to go around. A bit sweeter than many of the RISs on the market, but that helped cut through the ""unsweetened dark chocolate bitterness"" that plague so many RISs on the market (I'm thinking GI ""Nightstalker"" in particular). The finish was somewhat fruity and smooth, and not at all dry, despite the high ABV.  M: The lacing was non-existent.... and I truly mean that! Literally, whenever I swirled the glass, the sludge just fell back into the glass, leaving a trail of moistness rather that one of dark stickiness. The carbonation was perfect for the style and cut the potential booze and syrupiness down to size!  D: I've only had ""The Abyss"" once, and I remember drawing a parallel between that brew and this one in terms of balance, full taste, and smoothness. I can't believe that ""Ten Fidy"" is 10.5%. I refuse to believe it! This is my favorite RIS available in my local area.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Vdubb86,4.38,"Served in a pint glass  Thanks to TheManiacalOne for giving me this huge want.  This beer was poured vigorously like the motor oil that it is into the glass to produce the finger of foam that is a deep brown color to top of the black as night body. The smell is of bourbon, chocolate, cherry, and a hint of orange zest. It's rather nice and doesn't come off too hot. The taste has a sort of rum raisin quality found usually in port with a coffee like roast in the back along with a touch of smoke that makes in real nice in the finish. The mouth is super viscous and still finds a way to be carbonated. This beer is truly a sipper of the highest order, but damn if it's not a really good beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Very nice. Little sweetness in the scent.  T - Just a touch of bitterness but not overpowering. Nice coffee flavor. Dark chocolate flavors as well and has that nice alcolhol feel at the end. Not overpowering at all but you feel it.  M - Amazingly clean feeling with enough thickness that feel like your whole mouth is coated in goodness.  D - Yes but with that ABV you will start to feel a couple in a hurry. Not that its a bad thing!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,CHickman,4.33,"Pours pitch black with a 1 finger super creamy light brown head that lasted a little while and looked like a chocolate shake on top; it left very good lacing that clings to the glass.  Smells of roasted malt, coffee, caramel, molasses, toasted grains, cocoa, burnt smoky wood and alcohol like bourbon or aged wine. Smoky, sweet aroma that reeks of malt and coffee and gave off nice desert whiffs.  Tastes of sweet malt, roasted malt, cocoa, burnt coffee or coffee beans, espresso, caramel, molasses, syrup, toasted grains, chocolate, burnt wood, smoked malts and alcohol like bourbon or dark rum; light vanilla notes come through in the finish, which is semi-dry, toasted and full of the coffee bean and chocolate flavors. Not sure if there are any hops in here, but if there are they don't come through, nor does the alcohol for the most part.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a roasty smoky malt taste, a thick medium to heavy body and a bitter smoky dry finish.  Highly drinkable and packed with flavor, this beer is fantastic. A definite recommendation that lived up to the hype and was extremely complex and tasty. This is a very expensive 4 pack of cans, so this is a beer to sip and savor.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,oregone,3.86,"A: Very nice head of rich brown that has some longevity. Darkdarkdark. A fairly ideal representation of what a RIS would be for me, just lacked that exciting something. S: Roasted malts, malted milk, domestic coffee, some vanilla, etc. Classic aromas that lack some vibrancy and definition. T: Similar to nose, but add some smoke, tobacco, dark chocolate, etc. M: Fairly rich, but not really sticking around or distinguishing itself. D: Too high for what it is. Cracked this open after work and realized about three minutes in that it was 2/3s gone. Sloooow it down.

2681,34483,July2Nov,4.5,"Appearance: Black as oil! This is some of the darkest beer I've ever seen...kind of astonished. Thin, brown lace of a head.  Smell: Has a nice buttery chocolate scent to it. Think Swiss Miss in an alcoholic form. Very tempting!!!  Taste & Mouthfeel: Light in body at first sip. Slight warming of alcohol. Syrupy hints comes through in the flavor and then deep notes of chocolate come up, with a little bit of coffee for good measure. Also, an ever so slight acidic flavor comes through at the tail-end. The level of this beer stays pretty constant with a full on syrup feel. Aftertaste of a chalky coco hue lingers a bit after each sip.  Drinkability: For a 10.50 ABV, this is very deceptive! Glad I finally was able to find this great brew. If you like your beers dark, then you should venture down this road and as the can says, ""This dog'll hunt""....and it does!  * Looked at the bottom of the can and noticed it had, ""Hahaa, Darkness"" written on it!

Coats your mouth with sweet cocoa, and finish clean from the hops  D- for an RIS, this is insanely drinkable. I dare to say ""too drinkable""... For 10.5 ABV, it has no boozy kick when on nitro (not that it has much from a normal tap). You could down a few pints and find yourself in a lot of trouble!

Retention is decent, but eventually the head settles. Some light patchy lacing is left sticking to the glass.  S: Dark cake-like chocolate, sweet cherry and plum darkfruit aromas, piney and earthy hops, black licorice, and a bit of spicy alcohol. Light woody smells. A complex nose, but not as in-your-face as I would like it to be. Lacks clout.  T: Chocolate cake and cocoa powder open. From there, the flavors shift to roasted coffee. Plums and cherries come out briefly, along with some raisin. Mildly spicy alcohol. Hints of earthy and herbal hops throughout create the impression of black licorice when taken in conjunction with the roasted malt flavors. Finishes dry with a deep roastiness, more chocolate cake, and distinctly woody notes.  M: Thick and ridiculously smooth and creamy. Syrupy and mouth-coating as well. Alcohol is pleasantly warming.  D: A sipper, but drinkabililty is good for the style.  Notes: Great beer, one of the better RISs I've had. This can was just over a year old.

It tastes thick and chocolatety with a slight bitterness from the hops. A big, full body beer at 10.5 abv which masks the imperial booziness under thick layers of complex dark malts.

Carbon, smokey malts, some hop bitterness present, graham crackers. If this was a bit sweeter it would be like a s'more in a can. Finish is earthy and a bit hot.

2681,34483,nhindian,4.12,"12oz can poured into a tulip. Canned with care on 12-18-09.  ABV on my can is noted as 9.5%.  A - Thick, viscous goop pours out where I thought beer would be. Not as syrupy as some other RIS's I've had recently, but pretty much blacker than all of the combined. This beer has almost no highlights to it, simply black void all over. Even after a hard pour of most of the can, I struggled to ink out even a finger of cocoa colored head. Pretty meager retention as well. Not much lacing, if any.  S - I came into this beer expecting another coffee-bomb stout, but am pleasantly surprised. The nose is sweet and malty, thick to be sure, but also full of rich, bittersweet chocolate. The coffee is suppressed to say the least, but the chocolate covers up nicely. However, not much depth besides that.  T - The taste doesn't bring much out in the way of the coffee, either. The malts really bring a roasted, sweet flavor without relying on the burnt espresso taste, and they transition nicely into a chocolate flavor so bitter, I don't think I've met a beer that even comes close. It's like biting into a bar of baker's bittersweet chocolate. A subtle, subdued hop appearance near the end.  M - Mouthfeel is definitely thick and heavy bodied, but with a good amount of carbonation to help it move. A moderately lasting bitterness, but overall it doesn't abuse the palate that some other, coffee-dominated stouts do.  D - Drinkability is moderate. Surprisingly, the thing that I could see holding this beer back is the sweetness and bitterness combination of the malts. The sweetness lasts throughout the entire taste, which is good to ease the coffee flavors, but bad in that it imposes in the finish. Alcohol is masked wonderfully; there's almost no presence of the 9.5% ABV.  Overall a nice change of pace from other RISs, but I feel it's a bit too sweet for my liking, and I am a stout lover drawn to the coffee flavors. A good beer, and I'll certainly get it again, but I won't make a special trip for it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Lldeegan,4.3,"Ten Fidy, is a beast wrapped in aluminum. Here's my review: Comes out of the can like motor oil. Thick and black but produces a bit of dark brown foam to top it off. Don't pour it in your car. Strong aromas of dark fruit, fig, molasses, chocolate, coffee, wood and smoke. The thick and sweet molasses comes through first with an oily arrival of oak, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, raisins, figs and smoke, with a bittersweet coffee finish. Awesome Imperial Stout, and you can take it hiking, to the beach, the pool, although I wouldn't advise shotguning it... would I?",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,surlytheduff,4.35,"The beer poured a thick sludgey black. A bit over one finger of a tan head, which didn't stick around for too long. As the head receded, a clingy film of light lacing was left down the side of the glass. The smell wasn't terribly intense; there was a general roastiness, with some chocolate and coffee notes.  Taste was really pleasant. Roasted malt, sweet molasses, dark chocolate, a slight bit of mild bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel was very creamy, velvety. This was one of the sweeter RIS's I've had, and if I could ignore the per-can price I could see myself drinking a few of these.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,cbutova,4.27,"I have to admit, I have held off on reviewing this one for way too long. Since I have no other beer to review in my fridge, this one will finally be judged. Canned 11-16-09, just over a year old.  A- Many beers are described as pouring like oil and this one is no exception, probably fits the description the best. A small dark tan cloud appears briefly but disappears very quickly. A tiny ring leaves some sticky suds but nothing in the way of lace.  S- Milk chocolate up front with dark fruit, heavy roast malt and licorice in the mix with it. The cocoa in the nose is very nice.  T- A nice balance of roast cocoa and malt with dark fruit, licorice and caramel in the mix. Pretty straightforward to me but still nice. Slight vanilla comes to mind.  MF- Very rich and thick with a silky smooth creaminess to it. The carbonation is pretty much spot on to support the in your face flavors.  DB- I would be interested in taking some notes on a fresher can. I can taste a bit of the age on this one but it is still a solid, no gimmick RIS. Superb example of mouthfeel in a big stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ImpairedPirate,4.05,"Canned December 2009, purchased and poured into a pint glass November 2010.  Appearance - At first pour, this beer is dark and thick.  There is an extremely subtle almost-rusty brown hue, behind a veil of motor oil darkness.  The lighter color can be seen around the meniscus of the glass, and at the edges when tilted.  The head is a lingering high density.  Smell - Initial smell of roast, maybe some dark fruit undertone.  While not the most prominent smells, just the first noticed.  There is more, but the other notes are harder to distinguish.  As it breathes in the glass, the more complex aromas surrender to a stronger boozier scent.  Taste - A slight bitter cocoa flavor hits the palette initially, which evolves mid-taste to include a slight toasty coffee hint.  Maybe some caramel?  Mouthfeel - Absolutely amazing, and my favorite part of this beer.  As a long time BeerAdvocate lurker, this beer has pushed me over the edge and inspired me to join BA to review.  The mouthfeel is the best feature of this beer; it stands out above others in the same category.  It feels a tiny bit less viscous than syrupy, and is weighty enough to coat the mouth.  If this was a season, it would be early Winter.  Drinkability - Considering the high ABV,  this beer is surprisingly pleasant.  While this beer's characteristics are strong, as an entire package it does not overwhelm the senses.  Highly recommended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Notes of anise, leather, smoke, chocolate all wrapped up in a smooth cotton candy wrapper.  M - The most impressive aspect of this beer. Coats the mouth like fine cognac. Smoothness beyond comprehension.  D - So complex that more than one per night might be stretching it a bit. Needs to be savored one at a time.  I'm proud to be from the state that this epicness eminates. Beyond all expectations from other Russian Imperial Stouts.

2681,34483,Bouleboubier,4.65,"Really bugs me that this is $4.50 a can in my local beer stores selling singles. Bugs me even more now having finally had it and very much being as close to blown away as compared to my expectations, which wrote this off assuming multi-faceted hype.  At my local, this was listed at 9.4%. Wonderfully woven in. Coal black with a virtually everlasting dollop of chocolate-mousse-y shaded foam - it does eventually settle out, but leaves a hot-cocoa-y swirl in the middle, a frothy collar, and luscious thick lacing. Intense, dense, deep down hazelnut-coffee-roasty aroma - wouldn't quite add chocolate to that yet. Those roasty coffee notes really do dominate here, though not actually smelling like real java was added - amazing. Add to the joe, a little bit of cocoa in the taste and a whole lot of subtly sweet cream - this drinks/feels almost like a milkshake - how the hell did they do that?! The presence of alcohol in the taste and overall experience is just about ideal for the style. I will, without a doubt, go back to this, and I'm excited to dig deeper into the wonders and complexities of this magnificent drink.

2681,34483,mwrecording,4.7,"Wow. At $16 a four pack, I was a bit resistant to try it given that most high praised beers I've bought and spent big money on weren't worth the high price but imperial stouts are my favorites so I wanted to give it a shot. Holiday gift to myself.  The appearance is what you should come to expect from an RIS: Pitch black with a small brown/tan head.  The smell is mix of coffee and soy sauce to me and while that isn't appealing it certainly isn't off putting. For me, anyway.  The most important part - the taste: Very sweet, subtle coffee notes, sweet malty notes and I even pick up a bit of that soy taste - which I enjoy. Great taste.  The feel of it is a bit different than any other RIS I've had before as it is a bit 'chewy' and very thick. Coats the mouth and teeth.  Drinkability: At the time of this writing, I'm halfway through the beer. I haven't tasted much alcohol at all although that could be because I've enjoyed the beer so thoroughly. I'm a bit of a lightweight so I don't know that I'd have more than one of these in a sitting but if I could I'd drink them all day.  I loved this beer and I can't find anything bad to say about it. It'd be great if it was a few bucks cheaper but at its current price, for me, it'll be a special occasion type beer - and maybe it'll be even better that way.  Lastly, this was a fresh shipment my store just got in. I'm planning on drinking another in a week or two and then aging the other two from the pack. One for 6 months and one for a year.

2681,34483,soze47,3.76,"My first RIS from a can, poured into a snifter.  Appearance: Pitch black and luscious looking. Nice chocolate brown head that is almost purple looking on the edges when a little light can sneak through.  Aroma: Dark roasted malts suggests some char bitterness to all the other flavors present (bakers chocolate, raisins, and pumpernickel bread). Surprisingly subdued aroma for such a hearty beer.  Taste: Very hot and boozy to this taster. I think this really wakes up the palette on the first couple of drinks, so take a few sips to acclimate yourself. Bitter cocoa stays for a long time, ultimately resulting in an accumulating linger. There are notes of raisins, rum, and dark fruits (cherries?) in the midst of flavor development, but chocolate bitterness and alcohol heat are what hit first and last.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very rich beer with a heavy mouth feel. This one is viscous, in a creamy way, that coats your mouth right away resulting in a progressively heavier beer and linger. It has what seems to be a higher carbonation than most RIS's, but rather than keep the flavors dancing, it creates a fuller mouth feel that contributes to its richness.  Overall: This one was a little too hot for me, so I should put one down for a year to see how it tastes when the booze settles a bit. Not a bad beer at all and I can see that its complex flavors could make for an enjoyable drink. However, this one is a little too rich for my blood.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Big lacing as I swirl. Perfect RIS look.  Aroma-A bombardment of darkly roasted malts ascend from the snifter, chocolate and roasted malt is king here, chocolate fudge is the dominant aroma followed by medium-roast coffee and a withering smidgen of hops.  Taste-Initial wave of sweet to bittersweet chocolate fudge rushes over the palette and literally coats everything, this is quickly tempered by a withering piny hop quality that struggles and does everything in its power to keep things from becoming cloying, it succeeds. Undercurrents of coffee beans, black molasses and sticky pine-sap can be detected, maybe a hint of anise as well.  Mouthfeel-Now this is just perfect, super thick, viscuous, syrupy, mouth-coating and drippingly thick, perfect RIS consistency.  Drinkability-This keeps me coming back for successive sip after sip, it's pretty much as drinkable as a 10.5% RIS stout is going to get.  Notes-All in all, a damn near perfect RIS and one that always makes me look forward the the late fall/early winter; it isn't the season until I've had some Ten Fidy in my snifter.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,UTCengOwl,4.68,"Ten FIDY, how I love thee. I've had you from cans in my Great Divide ballon glass at my house in Austin. I've brought you as my ""I'm a badass"" beer out of a can while floating the Comal River. Now, I had a 2009 version of you at the Falling Rock Taphouse and I couldn't help but review you (served in a St. Bernardus chalice).  This beer is always shockingly beautiful. At the tap house, it came without much of a head, but it had an impressive oily layer across the top. This beer looks like the death of light. I feel bad for any beams that happen to cross its path. They will never escape the black hole that is this beer. When I've had it at home, it produces a nice light brown head with some tight bubbles. If I could give this beer a 6 on appearance, I wouldn't hesitate.  This beer is a toasty behemoth. Smells like chocolate and burnt goodness. The hop presence wasn't there as much for the 2009, but it's definitely there when I've had it at home. You can tell from the nose alone that this will be a huge beer experience.  Thie taste is surprisingly balanced. Always roasty as all heck, but not overpowering. The 2009 had a great dark crystal dopplebock type quality. Mmmm.... fruity. The booze isn't hidden here. The hops always show up to the party in the fresher vintages. Just well balanced and inviting. It's not the ass kicker that the smell and look suggest, it's much more of a sensitive, but powerful force.  The high booze feel gives it a great thick and warming quality. Excellent for a 10 degree winter night. The beer works its way around, coating my whole mouth. Such a great feeling. While it's a huge beer, I never have a hard time finishing the glass / can and I would never mind getting another (unless it's already warm from being in the sun on the river :) ).",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Chadpaq,4.35,"Picked up an 8.5-ounce portion of this stuff on tap at my local taphouse of choice, Duckworth's. $4.50 for this fairly small pour. Whatever, it's a Ten Fidy, I have a little extra cash in my pocket, I've been wanting to try her for quite some time. I can splurge every now and then.  Appearance is about as dark as they come, something I guess I should have expected...yet didn't, somehow. At any rate, nearly zero penetration of UV rays. I like that. Seems like a very rich beer, and at 10.5%, it had better be.  The smell churns up images of coffee, chocolate with an extremely high cocoa content, licorice, and perhaps something even toasty. That's probably the malt poking its head through.  It tastes surprisingly sweet. Malty as hell; probably one of the maltiest I've ever had. I'm a hophead, but every now and then, a beer like this a welcome change.  Not much carbonation. Would've liked a little more. I'm sure the lack of it isn't a testament to the freshness of the beer; merely so much hops that really nothing can be done.  This stuff has the potential to knock me on my ass. Fortunately, I'm going to stop after this small portion.  Good beer. Not my style, but certainly an excellent...ah, yes, ""Russian Imperial Stout."" I'd congratulate Oskar Blues, but I'm pretty sure everyone and their mother already has.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

It is hard not to notice during the pour that the beer appears to have the consistency of syrup. The head is small and limited, but lacing appears at the top of the fluid as light-brown lace.  N: Coffee and oatmeal--not a very strong nose.  T/M: What it lacks in the nose it makes up for in taste! Coffee and chocolate syrupy goodness! The flavor is very stand-upish. Thick mouthfeel, very much like syrup--a bit of a bourbon touch in the middle with a plum/prune backdrop. The beer is fairly drinkable--the alcohol is not over-bearing, which allows the flavor to flouorish--but it is very heavy and filling.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JK4Stout,4.75,"Poured into a regular pint glass. The deep dark color shows a love of quality malt that one comes to expect from OB. I have had this beer once or twice before, but I enjoy it so much that I have review it. This is one of those cold night brews. You know the one you can open while watching football as the snow is falling outside. The aftertaste lingers with you in a sweet chocolate notes. And the mouthfeel of this brew is honestly enough to win it all the awards it has garnered already. Don't try to have too many in one sitting, but it is very much worth a try.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Habmike,4.22,On tap at Duckworths in Charlotte.  Appears quite dark and sinister. Brown head but not much of it. Laces the glass decently.  Roasted espresso and some charred smokyness in the nose.  Taste is pretty monstrous. Lots of charryness with plenty of roasted malt and espresso flavor. Still a bit of fruityness and apple brandy flavor hidden in there as well.  This one is a big boy in the mouth with the right amount of carbonation teetering on the low side. Leaves my mouth coated and happy.  Drinkability is dangerously good but at the abv it will take its toll for sure!,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Lacing is top notch as well. I wish I could give this more than a 5.  S: Big punch upfront that's sweet, rich and roasty with a hint of vanilla. Smoky and boozy once you dig a little deeper.  T: Sweet sugariness and vanilla are intensified. Smoky in the aftertaste. Sticky syrup and alcohol linger on the palate. Black coffee comes through in the after-aftertaste.  M: Like butter baby.

2681,34483,amcmaho1,4.95,"After hearing so much praise, i figured it to be the right time to finally have a Ten Fidy. With the weather slowly changing in these late november nights, what better companion than a delicious Imperial Stout?  Appearance: Incredibly dense, black, impenetrable body. A nice head, the color of creamy coffee rises and quickly dissipates. Some lacing, and certainly lots of ""tiny bubbles.""  Smell: Right off the bat, black licorice seems to be the dominant smell. Along with this is the definite hint of dark fruits, bittersweet chocolate, but most predominantly black licorice.  Taste: In the taste there are elements of chocolate and licorice again in the beginning. In the middle theres a slight bitterness, favoring the chocolate flavor; which transforms into a chocolaty coffee taste towards the end. The aftertaste left in my mouth reminds me of a flavored coffee (i.e. a froofy choloclate mocha whatever etc...). The malt and hop interplay in this beer is really nicely balanced.  Mouthfeel: Not too thin, not too light. Nice carbonation without being too powerful. Slight chewiness. Overall, Great mouthfeel!  In all I've been very pleased with the Ten Fidy. I'm glad to have found another great Imperial stout which is relatively easy to find and exceptional drinking...",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,stakem,4.2,"Review from notes taken on 9/15/10.  On tap at Al's via the beer gas nitro blend and server in a nonic. Appears blak in color with a severely dark brown to tan head that quickly dissolves.  The aroma is dark chocolate with a twang of citrus hop character. Some alcohol is evident along with a light mineral quality. The alcohol imparts a fruit-like scent that increases in intensity as the brew warms.  A very pleasant blend of bitter roast verse chocolate sweetness hits the tongue. Taste of bitter chocolate couple with citrus bitter hops adds a nice layer of complexity. The alcohol is apparent despite a fairly cold serving temperature and adds a dark fruited character like raisins or plums soaked in alcohol. A twinge o flavor almost like liquorice is evident with some minor yeasty notes.  Overall a solid brew, quite a roasty bugger that is very bold and enjoyable but blends very well with all the flavors incorporated and a nice contrast of sweetness verse bitterness. Medium to full bodied with a modest level of carbonation. It is very enjoyable and I would have it again. It leaves a lingering aftertaste of sweet dark chocolate coupled with bitter grains hops and alcohol. I'm not sold on the nitro presentation altering much of this experience. If anything it might be perceived as a bit smoother in the feel than the norm but not 100% smooth like all nitro could.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,WholeFoodsDerek,4.77,"I am not pouring this in a glass. Rather, I am drinking it out of the can since it is one of the few beers I will drink in a can.  A - From what I can see, extremely dark black with a small brown head retention. Obviously pouring this in a glass would make a difference.  S - Lots of Caramel and toffee. Subtle chocolate.  T - Lots of smoke flavors. This could be quite hot on the palate depending on how experienced you are with Russian Imperial stouts (as in alcohol taste). Very Creamy and toasty. Obviously an abundance of malt. Sip and enjoy this winter time brew.  M - Thick with an oatmeal stout mouthfeel. I wouldn't be surprised if this were an imperial oatmeal stout. I hope Rasputin doesn't scoff at me.  D - Two pints is quite enough. Three or more is asking for a rather harsh morning, so you better have time to sleep in. This is a great beer regardless.  Overall, a great winter time Russian Imperial Stout. This is my go-to stout during the Winter when I am out and about. Dark Lord and Hunahpuhs are obviously Gods of the Stout Genre, but they are extremely limited, obviously. If it is November through February, chances are I am drinking Ten Fidy if I am drinking Stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S - Dark roasted malts, cocoa, licorice, dark fruit. Some hop bitterness.  T - Dark roasted malts, cocoa, espresso & faint hints of dark fruit and licorice. A nice but not overwhelming hop bitterness in the background.  M - Medium body, silky, chewy.  D - Remarkably drinkable for the ABV.

2681,34483,Huhzubendah,4.43,"A: Ten FIDY is jet black with a dark tan head that leaves ample lacing on the glass.  S: The aroma is of roasted malt and chocolates. Very inviting.  T: Simply put, Ten FIDY is unbelievable. In my humble opinion, this is one of the best Russian imperial stouts around. This absolutely belongs in the discussion with many of the special release stouts that are so highly coveted. The flavor is so ridiculously smooth and rich, it's hard not to gulp the beer down within minutes after pouring it. What the beer lacks in complexity, it atones for with irresistible and delectable flavor.  M: The mouthfeel is flawless. The double digit alcohol percentage is masked so gracefully, it puts a smile on my face. The beer coats the palate with rich, creamy, buttery stout and finishes with a delicate warming sensation. Extremely well done.  D: Keep it coming. A must have for the imperial stout lover. Highly recommended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S - a ton of roasted malt, coffee, burnt brown sugar, chocolate and molasses.  T - same as nose - huge malt presence, coffee, chocolate and oak.  M - very thick and sticky, good carbonation.  D - damn fine flavors, no burn or hint of alcohol. I know it's there though, and it's going to slow me down after one or two. I wish I could keep going!

Kinda pricey but for a brew of this caliber reasonable to say the least! Tasted great and had an alcohol content to compliment.

2681,34483,reedy212,4.29,"A. A hard pour left me with with nothing but a black glass and some inkling of blood red foam S. Coffee and booze were the first scent to hit my nose. Enough so that I decided to check to ABV. 10.5%. Shoulda drank this one first. T. My first RIS, and its a far cry from stouts I've had before. The taste proved my nose knows, coffee chocolate booze and black licorice. Basically if its a black or dark brown food, its in this beer. IMO it got better with a little time in the glass. Could be the taste could be the 10.5% playing with your taste buds. M. The lowest score of this beer for me. The booze kind of lingers in your mouth. Kind of like after you rinse with scope that feel on your tongue. D. If you take away the mouthfeeling and you set aside a chunk of time and don't rush this beer its delicious.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,plumcrazyfx,4.37,"Wow, best stout I've ever had in a can. This thing pours black, black, black. I poured hard knowing the high alcohol would probably lead to lower carbonation - I was right here - just a small head. The smell is a heavy mix of coffee, brown sugar, and alcohol. This is a sipper - each sip coats and overwhelms the tongue. I taste chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, and alcohol. The flavors meld in a good way and take turns as you swallow each sip. Definately opens up with the alcohol as it warms. Mouthfeel is super thick and coating. I can only have one of these but will go back for more when I recover from this one.

2681,34483,rjhaupt,4.35,"A - It's obsidian. Opaque through the middle with the tiniest ability of light to pass through around the edges. Pour as vigorous as you like, you won't get a head on this viscous bad boy.  S - You can really smell the alcohol in here, but hey, this is a legit high gravity beer so you're getting what you pay for. The other smells are licorice, hops and mocha coffee cocao (yes, all three).  T - Having recently had actual molasses, I can confidently say ths is the beer equivalent. (I know fermented molasses is really rum, but I'm talking flavor not distillery/brewery science.)  M - This is so viscous it's almost hard to swallow, but if I don't swallow it I don't get to drink any more. That would be a tragedy.  D - You can have one of these. You want another? Well you can't appreciate it if you try to have more than one at a time! You'll like the one you have, but you shouldn't have another.

Pours with a dark brown head that fades fairly quickly.  S - Dark chocolate, coffee and alcohol. I don't find it overpowering at all though.  T - Sweeter than I expected, but in a good way. The sweetness helps it balances the beer out very well. If the sweetness wasn't there it would be a little much. The alcohol brings a very nice warming characteristic.  M - Thick and chewy. Almost a creamy feel to it. Slightly grainy, but nice.  D - Not for the beginning beer drinker. I love stouts so it was amazing to me.

2681,34483,weatherdog,4.39,"12 oz. bottle poured into a John Smith's snifter. ""Canned with Care 10-27-09""  It pours a nearly jet black with a 1 finger dark mocha head. The head dies fairly quickly leaving just a ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass.  The nose is deep and rich filled with alcoholic chocolate. The alcohol is nice and warming, absence of harshness. There isn't much of a roasted character at all.  The taste is really great, it's rich and full of sweet sweet chocolate. Much like the nose the roast character is very low but I think, coupled with some hop bitterness, lends a contrast to the sweetness so it isn't overwhelming and cloying. There is just a hint of a nice mild coffee flavor and licorice at the end. It's really a great beer.  Mouthfeel is just amazing. Although it has a nice carbonation level the mouthfeel is liquid velvet, just coats the mouth and doesn't let go. The strength of the beer can be tasted but it's not distracting, it's just great. Drinkability is above average for the style but because of the fuller mouthfeel this beer lends itself to be a nice sipper and enjoyed for a good 30-60+ minutes. Just wonderful.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TJBAIHWL,3.59,"Pours blacker and thicker than anything I've ever seen. Motor oil comes to mind. No highlights whatsoever. There's a half-finger head from an absurdly aggressive pour (about 2 feet from can to glass). Wish there was more head, it's a beautiful cedar-colored bubbly layer that sat around atop the beer for about 30 seconds. Smells as dark as it looks, with mocha, dark chocolate, and roasted grain dominating the nose. The first sip is predictably thick. There's a massive roasted barley flavor, coffee & dark chocolate blending into sort of a mocha character that finishes bitter and warm.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Kinsman,4.28,"Cellared Update: One year old Ten FIDY: canned on 10/09/10, consumed on 11/03/11.  Aroma is a bit sweeter. Not as grainy. Fruity with more of a chocolate note. Roasted aspect seems to have subsided a bit but leaves plenty of chocolate and coffee goodness. Not as hot. This past year has treated this beer very well.  Original Revew: Fresh Ten Fidy, about a month old.  Blacker than black, truly one of the darkest beers I've ever seen. A dark coffee colored head slowly develops to be a bout 1 finger thick but faded away too quickly for my liking.  Aroma is full of a roasted grain scent and lots of underlying aromas. Dark chocolate, coffee, and hints of a fruity sweetness.  Lots of flavor going on here. Roasted barley makes this a bit grainier than expected but still lots of chocolate and coffee flavors going on. Again, a slightly sweeter fruitiness comes in at the finish.  Mouthfeel is full, chewy and smooth. Overall, Ten Fidy is tough to beat for widely available stouts.

Poured from a can into a Duvel tulip glass. Beer is pitch black and syrupy on the pour. With a really aggressive pour, there was only half a finger of dark brown head consisting of very small bubbles, but recedes almost immediately. Cannot see anything but black on this beer. Swirling the glass causes some light lacing that clings to the edge of the glass nicely. Really really thick looking beer.  Pulled it out of the fridge and poured when it was fairly cold (~35°F) but still a decent smelling RIS. Lots of roasted malt, dark chocolate bitterness when the beer was cold. A bit boozy as well, and just a slight hint of sweetness from burnt sugar. Smells a little sweeter when it warms up closer to room temperature.  Taking a sip, really smooth roasted toasty malt and dark chocolate like the nose. Not as bitter as the nose made it seem to be. Alcohol is hidden really well, with a nice bitter sweet chocolate note at the back of the tongue and in the aftertaste.  Smooth creamy full bodied beer, with a good amount of carbonation despite the high ABV. This RIS is a little too easy to drink and I had to remind myself to sip it and savor the well balanced flavor.

Pours black and is completely impermeable to light. Has about a half a finger of brown sugar colored head that disappears quick leaving no lacing. Roasted notes with tons of cocoa in the nose. Taste is phenomenal, a little bit of everything you would expect. Predominately cocoa and sweet/roasted malts with nice hints of espresso and some faint charred notes. Full bodied to say the least. I want to say the 10.5% alcohol is well hidden but that may not be all that accurate given how much is going on with this one. I absolutely love when a beer lives up to the hype that surrounds it.

Dark chocolate and a hint of coffee.  T: Dark chocolate, espresso. It's like taking a bite of a dark chocolate brownie with toasted nuts inside.  F: THICK. I hear Dark Lord is thicker, and I don't doubt that, but I can't imagine how it could be more viscous than this. Full and creamy, oily coating everywhere.  D: Ridiculous.

Jesus, this is an inviting black pit right here.  S: Roasted malts, crisp bitterness. Deep, deep, deep malted richness. Only problem here is that the taste annihilates what's going on in the nose for richness, complexity and depth.  T: Up-front is roasted malts. Then hits the booze, in droves. Fades off into a hard-biting finish. Far deeper than it smells or looks, this beer goes on and on.  F: Rich as hell, and creamy. Head is pillowy, with good retention.  D: Damn good, gets better and better as it opens up.  Really, the only problem with this beer is that at $13 for a 4-pack, it doesn't stand up to Old Rasputin (at $8 for a 4-pack).

S: Big sweet notes of molasses with more subtle notes of coffee, vanilla, caramel and dark chocolate. Very delicious. T: More chocolate comes through than the nose. It's almost like chocolate fudge there is so much. Coffee is subtle but there is still a vanilla and molasses-like sweetness. Aftertaste has a touch of licorice and tobacco, and has a bitterness akin to very dark chocolate. M: Exceptionally smooth and creamy mouthfeel over a full viscous body. Alcohol is well masked and any warmth that a fresh can had is now gone with age. Very creamy. D: One of my favorite RIS and an exceptional beer. Rich and extremely smooth. Sad to hear this one is leaving California.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Phelps,4.02,"A: maybe it's the shock of seeing this tar pour out of a can, but few stouts I've seen look as thick and heavy as Ten FIDY. Rarely do you see a beer with legs like this one. It's syrupy like molasses, black and viscous as 10w30. A tiny head of cinnamon peeks out of the murk before swiftly fizzing out. A tiny amount of spotty lace is left on the glass as I drink.  S: maple, molasses, cocoa powder and a bit of vanilla. This is one sweet aroma.  T: the flavor trends toward the sweeter side of life, with molasses and maple syrup playing about. You could bake ginger snaps with this. It later opens up to roastier tastes of toasted bread, peanuts, and a finish of espresso.  M: the viscosity of the appearance translates to the mouthfeel, as it's nicely velvety and creamy about the palate. The body is medium-full and a light carbonation massages the tongue.  D: Ten FIDY is definitely a sweeter RIS, but I like it that way. It's got great flavor, the 9 percent ABV is only noticeable when it's far too late to care and it comes in a can! What's not to love? In the top tier of readily-available Russian Imperials.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,hopstradamus,4.23,"A. This beer is a deep, dull charcoal-like black. It pours softly with a thick, dark chocolate head that settles quickly into a thin ring around the edge of the glass. Thick and syrupy, it lets absolutely no light through.  S. Sweet roasted malt smell along with coffee, dark fruit, and just a hint of vanilla. Hops take a back seat to the malt but are still there.  T. The taste hits instantly and moves from smoky, dark roasted malt to chocolate and molasses to burnt sugar to dark fruit and then finishes with a sharp hop flavor that is accentuated by a ""hot"" alcohol burn.  M. Thick but not syrupy like it looks, it is both bold and chewy without being too heavy. Very smooth and creamy.  D. Very good, mo disappointments here! The high alcohol will keep you from drinking an awful lot of them, but I wish I could keep this in my fridge all the time. This is the best canned stout in my humble opinion. .",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,comfortablynumb1,4.19,"Brother came through with a 4 pack of these. Thanks man...  Poured from a 12oz can into an Old Raspy pint glass. Bottom of can reads: Canned with care. 11-02-09- Delicious darkness...  A - Pours pitch black with a one finger brown head. Head dissipates rather quickly. Not much lacing to be had...  S - chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, and sweet caramel...  T - Dark chocolate, brown sugar, caramel, with a coffe finish. Brown sugar and caramel do add a sweetness that, in my experience, is not usually associated with a RIS; however, it is nothing that is over the top, and you get no hint that this beer is a 10.5%. Very smooth for the style. No alcohol warmth comes through...  M - Thick and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. This one is deliously viscous...  D - Really enjoyed these. Could definitely see myself picking a four pack up in the future. The only thing that keeps these from being in my constant rotation is the steep price. Nontheless, this is a solid RIS...

2681,34483,MetalHopHead6,4.31,"Ten Fidy is smooth, remarkably refreshing for an RIS, and layered with flavors and visual appeal.  It looked like black ink pouring out of the can. In the glass, it was black with a dark multi-layered head. It was darker and more complex than the typical milk-chocolate stout head. It left an intricate ringless lace design that was like a Rorschach blotter from the top of the glass to the bottom. Once I started drinking, the remarkable smoothness of this stout jumped out. It had a clean finish, with no stickiness and no lingering aftertaste. The flavor was sweet and complex, with immediate notes of dark fruit followed by a hint of chocolate, and a coffee-like finish.  Ten Fidy is complex and delicious, with an accessability that makes it a refreshing, and potentially, every-day stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

T: There's an insane amount of roasted malt here. The hops are more sensed than tasted, but they keep the malt flavor from getting too sweet. Dark chocolate, coffee, and sweet dates on the finish.  M: Oily and very heavy. It's appropriate that this motor oil of a beer comes in a can.  D: The alcohol hits fast and hard, as you would expect from an ABV this high.

Very roasted malts, and I mean roasted. Charred might even be a better term. Full, creamy and very velvety on the mouthfeel. This has a close feel as a weak milkshake as you can get. This would be very complimentary to a good dark dessert. Can't get over the amount of roast, chocolate and coffee that is here. Over the top, but good beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S- dark roasted malts and bakers chocolate. Touches of coffee and a woody smokey char.  T- opens up with a load of almost burnt malts and espresso. Bitter dark chocolate and bit of bruleed brown sugar. Slight condensed milk sweetness. Just the slightest bit of oxidation. Long everlasting roasty finish.  M- on the fuller side of body with a mid to light carb.  D- this is one of the classics. Its super accessible and a beast of a brew.

2681,34483,ralree,4.94,"A: Pours deep black with a dark brown head. Head is slight, but expected for the style. Retention is good, but lacing could be better.  S: Roasted coffee, hops, loads of bitter chocolate, some herbs, a touch of vanilla. Wonderful smell.  T: Extremely toasted malt and wonderful hops are right up front. Chocolate is strong and a main player as well. Coffee is also in there, but a little lighter. The bitterness of the hops and the charred malt go together well. Aftertaste is of, surprise, burnt wood, along with a sweet vanilla that is just delightful. Alcohol is nearly undetectable. Fantastic.  M: Lighter than some Imp. Stouts I've tried. Still, medium-heavy body, oily, non-astringent, good carbonation. Nothing to complain about here!  D: Goes down wonderfully for the style.

2681,34483,Naugros,4.08,"The beer is nearly black with a tan, dense head that sticks around for awhile. Despite the alcohol content there is very little evident in the nose. The smell is left to the roasted malts that give a sweet and mild coffee odor. The alcohol does show up in the taste, giving the overall impression of a coffee liqueur in a beer. But the mouthfeel is what really sets this one apart. It's creamy, thick and viscous. The booze show up here as well with a bit of a tingle on your tongue. This beer will definitely make its way into my beer fridge one of these days...when I can afford it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bohemiandonut,4.59,"Black as night. Disappearing tan/brown head.  Really nice coffee scent on this. Very sweet with none of the pungent acidity common in big coffee stouts. Hint of coconut and creamy dark chocolate. Maybe some marshmallow but it could just be my imagination.  For one thing, the 9.5% alcohol factor is nowhere to be seen. Nothing messy about this stout. Extraordinarily smooth (yes, smoothness is a flavor descriptor), rich and bold. I don't think I have ever been this happy about a beer purchase.  This is worlds beyond Stone RIS in every dimension, and I would place it above Speedway and Old Viscosity as well for that matter. A bourbon barreled version of this might actually take away from the superb balance OB has pulled off here. I'm surprised at how much I'm enjoying the can aspect - but you can't argue with a beer that retains its temperature as you snifter shot after shot. Also, no worries regarding QC in this format.

2681,34483,boomer31,4.33,"Had this fresh last year and enjoyed it but didn't review it. Canned 10-27-09:  A - Slight pop of the can and pours a black viscous liquid all the way thru, tiny light brown head around edges, leaves lacing on glass  S - Big roasty malt, hint of coffee and perhaps a hint of fruity hop but only a hint  T - Again big roasty malt, slight hint of alcohol and chocolatte late. Whatever hop presence there may have been in the nose has disappeared. Dark fruits and cherries come thru very slightly as the beer warms. The sweetness really lingers.  M - Huge viscous mouthfeel, low carb just beautiful for the style. The malt litterally sticks to by tongue just as it does to the glass.  D - This is a sipper! Huge roast and chocolate with low bitterness makes this very approachable.  Overall this is a great RIS! Perhaps a bit pricey but I can't say I regret the purchase. Roasty and chocolatey and very full. Great job here",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,NODAK,4.34,"Imperial stout in a can?? Interesting. The aroma is very thick...molasses, coffee, black licorice....all malts, all the time. Rich.  Pours a very viscous black...I couldn't get much of any head on this one. What head there was, was so thin it hardly counts.  Carbonation was very low. Taste was more on the sweet side than the bitter, roasted side that many imperial stouts seem to favor. The body of the beer is very thick, with semi-sweet chocolate malts, molasses and a hint of dark fruit in it. But again, it's not really a bitter or roasted flavor. Very mild, in my opinion. The finish brings on some bitter dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malt character, but it's not really at the biting level many of these beers get to. A lot of thick molasses hangs around during and after the swallow too. The alcohol is somewhat noticeable on the finish as well, especially on the exhale, but given the ABV I'm not that surprised.  This is actually a favorite imperial stout of mine now. To be quite honest, the overbearing roasted and bitter qualities many RIS's have can be a bit much to handle...but this one doesn't have that edge. In fact, it seems like a really rich and sweet rendition. Thankfully, it still has the consistancy of motor oil...which I do love.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Very dark chocolate with a bit of sweetness - molasses. Lots of roasted bitterness and coffee on the swallow.  M. Thick and chewy with smooth carbonation, but the carbonation is a bit much for me - it makes you want to swallow rather than allowing the flavors to sit on your tongue.  D. I really like the aroma and the flavor is good, but the carbonation level really takes away from the drinkability.

Not going to write much on this one but don't mistake that for lack of respect for this beer. This is also my first review in almost a year so let's hope I'll get back to it somewhat regularly...  Very smooth, silky to the nose as much as the taste. Oatmeal cookie, milk chocolate, a bit more than a hint of coffee and nice touch of vanilla going on here. Much more going on at room temp. Stickier and better.  Very solid Imperial stout. Nothing that will blow you away but very enjoyable. Taste follows nose, silky oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, and bits of coffee going on here. Vanilla makes it's way through at finish. Maybe cans aren't so bad after all....  Very drinkable. Could use a little more body. If Black Butte XXI took the whiskey barrel portion out of it's profile, I'd imagine this is almost exactly what it would taste like.

Aroma dark unsweetened chocolate, roasted coffee bean, mix of raisins, hops, and alcohol peeking out. Taste creamy roasted coffee and dark malt, hint of raisins and prunes, and thin sweetness trying to get through, then a taste of alcohol with a bit of a viney green hops bitterness mixing with the roasty bitterness.  Alcohol a bit warming and forward, dry finish. Low carbonation, medium mouthfeel, but not as creamy and heavy in the mouth as the color might've suggested. A bit of a rough heated finish from the alcohol. Decent, but not killer to me; probably would've liked it more if the alcohol didn't feel so harsh to me.

Notes of roasted malts and chocolate dominate the rest of its scent.  The mouthfeel is like velvet, very low carbonation as it should be.  The taste is of sweet and roasted malts but nothing too harsh. It finishes without any burnt tastes at all.  I love imperial stouts and have been waiting to try this one for a while.

Appearance: Pitch black like motor oil in color. Nice two finger, dark brown head with good retention. Almost a reddish or scarlett hue to the head. Very dark and very unique.  Aroma: Sweet chocolate dominates the nose. A little coffee bean bitterness, but the fudge and chocolate notes are the real draw.  Taste: Big fudge brownie and chocolate notes upfront. Transitions to more chocolate with a slight amount of bitter coffee beans. Sweet, but nicely balanced.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and very creamy. Maybe not as thick as it appeared on the first pour, but still quite thick and chewy.  Drinkability: The flavors are balanced and nice and the ABV did not seem like 10.5% even though this was an imperial stout. Goes down really smoothly, though I can't imagine killing a four pack of these.  Overall, a really solid and sweet imperial stout.

Forget drinking this, I need this smell as a car air freshener.  T: Wow. Amazing. Not a legit description though- okay... a rich flavor of dark bittersweet chocolate, coffee, molasses, caramel roasted malts, and vanilla. Booze and hops can be detected, but are very faint.

It's almost kind of amazing how dark this beer pours.  Wasn't getting much scent from it unfortunately. Not sure if the can is really holding down that scent or what but it was tough to get a sense of the beer until taking a sip.  Regardless happy to report that the beer drinks like a thick dessert of rich chocolate and licorice with some light coffee notes. The malts are sweeter and flavorful and balance well with some light hop hints towards the end. Subsequent sips reveal the same characteristics; deep, flavorful and complex. I don't know another way to express that there isn't a ""light"" moment in this beer, it drinks like a liquid slice of deep rich malty chocolate cake.

2681,34483,ptykozoon,3.78,"Very pretty beer. Abyss like dark. Mountainous dark brown head with nice retention and lacing.  Smells of rich chocolate and spice.  Tastes like the nose, spicy chocolate. Not too much else going on.  Very very very thick, chewy mouthfeel, can feel deposits of sugar being etched on my teeth. I'd like just a bit more of a controlled alcohol heat. Not bad.  Interesting beer, I detest cans but this is one I may seek out in the future.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,decadance,4.15,"A - Yep, its black. Very little head, a little disappointing.  S - Burnt malts which ends kind of sweet. Coffee in the back of the smell.  T - Not so much chocolate sweet as coffee sweet. Full malt flavor, with a bit of alcohol in the back.  M - Pretty think and coating. Would be done well with a bit more carbonation.  D - More carb and I would like more. Its an excellent taste when an ""ehh"" mouthfeel.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,alkemy,4.2,"Cliché, but this pours just like old motor oil. There's no real hint of carbonation in the pour. Head is dark brown/burnt orange, but really dissipates quickly. Really smells of dark, dried fruits like prunes. Intermingled with this is a burnt sweet malt aroma reminiscent of crème brulee. Silky smooth feel. The burnt malts are the dominant taste for me. Prunes and raisins also show themselves. I also get an overall sweetness that has hints of both chocolate and vanilla. The alcohol is pretty well hidden. I'm not a huge RIS fan, but this is pretty good stuff. I've yet to be disappointed with an Oskar Blues beer.

No lacing, nothing.  S - I had a Bells Expedition last night and I cannot believe the similarities between these two beers. Almost an identical nose of dark sweet malts, coffee, licorice and rum-raisins.  T - Very rich and sweet. Dark roasted malt, cocoa powder and coffee with a touch of dark stone fruits and smoke. Not much in the way of an alcohol burn.  M - Surprisingly medium-to-thin bodied with barely any carbonation. I seem to remember this being more ""milkshake-like"", so I'm a bit disappointed with the thinness on this.  D - Quite drinkable for the ABV but I really wish this was thicker and had better carbonation. Definitely a great stout, but I'm surprised by how Expedition-like this is. Granted, I did love Expedition, and imitation is the most sincere form of flattery...",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Jeffo,4.07,"Got this in a big trade with Jojomdma, as an extra no less. Thank heaps!  From a can into a snifter  APPEARANCE: Pours out like black motor oil. No joke. Small brown noisy head quickly disappears, leaving only a ring behind. Jet black body with zero carbonation evident. Thick looking body. Unfortunately no head, ring, or wisp remains, and leaves no lacing either. Looks a little flat by the end. Great, thick body, but a lackluster head.  SMELL: Roasted malts and lots of pure chocolate and molasses. Slight espresso notes and touches of black licorice as well. Lots of pure chocolate and molasses here.  TASTE: Roasted malts, smokiness, but lots of pure chocolate and molasses all over the place. Notes of espresso and black licorice, like in the nose, but it's more about the roasted, chocolate and molasses throughout. Mild but lingering aftertaste on this one.  PALATE: Medium-full body with medium prickly carbonation. Creamy enough on the palate, goes down smooth, a slight burn after the swallow, and finishes somewhat mouth-coating.  OVERALL: An enjoyable and tasty stout. I see why it's so highly praised, especially compared to the other chocolaty molasses flavored stouts. Lots of flavor and a good body on this one. The head could use a little beefing up, but a solid brew all around. Thanks again for hooking me up Jojo!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Luk13,3.7,"Can, thanks to HogtownHarry. Thick, dark, black pour with a bit of brown head. Aroma is a malt bomb, heavy with chocolate. Some hops and licorice too, reminescent of Bells Expeditions stout. Taste is quite bitter, some roastiness and hop bitterness with a fruity finale. Palate is rich and thick, quite boozy (lots of alcohol warmth). Slightly overdone even for an imperial stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ebby82,4.32,"Pours a deep, dark night, as bleak as Poe's cavernous poems. Odors of coffee and alcohol. The taste is quite alcoholic, with coffee and roasted malt flavors.  The viscosity of this drink reminds one of used motor oil, if indeed motor oil were delicious and intoxicating.  Certainly not eminently drinkable because of the aforementioned viscosity, as well as the propensity for a high alcohol content. However, I marvel at the ability of such a delightful drink to come from an aluminum can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,drizzam,4.41,"Thanks to my good friend jdostal for this generous offering!  A - HOLY BLACKNESS! Darker than the soul of Hitler. This stuff poured jet black, the look of well used motor oil, topped by a thick, frothy three finger dark tan...nay, brown head. The head sticks around forever, leaving a thick veil of chunky lacing down the inside of my pint glass. Wow...this is some good looking stuff!  S - Sticking with the dark theme, the aroma consisted mainly of dark roasted malts, accentuated by some bitter dark chocolate.  T & M - This is a meal in a can. Thick dark roasted and toasted malts lead the way, followed by a rich bitter dark chocolate flavor. The smoky, roasty, toasty, chocolate combination is extraordinary. The alcohol is very well masked. Thick and creamy mouthfeel...very smooth.  D - I've never been let down by Oskar Blues, but this is one helluva extraordinary offering from them!

2681,34483,aggiearcher13,4.32,"Poured from a can dated 10-27-09.  A: Maybe I was a little weak in the pour, but not a great amount of head on this one. I have been aging this can for a little while though, so maybe that has something to do with it. Otherwise, dark as night, no seeing through this one, and it pours as thick has heavy crude. What little head is there is a nice tan color. Leaves pretty good lacing.  S: Dark chocolate. A little boozy. Molasses, dark caramel, burnt sugar, raisins. Roastiness is rather restrained. Piney hops come through a bit.  T: Smooth. On the sweet side for the style. Dark chocolate and coffee dominate. Pine and citrus hops as well.  M: Viscous. Really smooth, carbonation is so in tune you hardly notice it. Without a doubt the best part of this beer, but that shouldn't take away form the rest of it.

2681,34483,axeman9182,4.29,"12oz can, chilled slightly from cellar temperature and served in my Chimay goblet.  The beer pours an absolute, soul sucking black. I swear the lights even dimmed when as I filled my glass. A dark caramel head forms, only about a finger in height, and sticks around for a minute before fading. Retention is average, but there's no real lacing to be found. The nose is simple but awesome, super rich dark chocolate and a very smooth, but noticeable warm alcohol sensation. The nose did not prepare me for the blast of pine and hop bitterness on my first sip, and to be honest I prefer my stouts with a little less prominent hop influence and to be all about the malt. Not to worry though, there's still the megaton of dark chocolate promised by the aroma, and the alcohol is a bit less pronounced (though still present, and not necessarily a bad thing). The mouthfeel is absolutely luxuriant, spot on low end of the spectrum carbonation and probably the thickest, chewiest stout I've yet encountered (and this is not a bad thing). The hop flavor isn't too much, but it's more than I prefer, but other than that everything about this beer is very well done and as a result it's disappearing almost alarmingly quickly from my glass.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,crossovert,3.36,"12 oz can, canned on 11-02-09. Served near warm (probably 55-60ish)  It pours form the can a thick black and looks a tad thinner than motor oil. The head his large, thick, and tan when poured vigorously. It doesn't leave much lacing as it recedes however.  The smell is not what I expected here. This smells more like one of those Eastern European malt liquor deals. It has that unbridled alcoholic scent to it with some honey and maybe molasses. There is a hint of caramel and sugar as well. It doesn't smell as dark and roasty as most of this style.  The taste is more traditional however. It is up there is sweetness though, it definitely has a cloying sweetness and a tingle that lingers on your tongue from the burning and unhidden alcohol. It has a nice roastiness to somewhat counter the sweetness but not enough. It is mainly caramel and sugar in flavor with a hint of roasted malt.  While the mouthfeel is incredibly thick and syrupy it is also cloying and burning.  Overall it is a middle of the road RIS, perhaps a bit too blunt and too sweet for my tastes in a RIS.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,hustlesworth,4.68,"A- damn downright darkest foam i've ever seen. no pssht when i popped the can and at first i though something went wrong and there would be no head but it kinda formed on it's own with awesome cascading effect. body is absolutely pitch black with no highlight at all. the head on this one is dense like a half cooked light chocolate cake. it seems to lighten in color a bit as it slowly recedes, takin on the tone of chocolate mousse or hot cocoa. remarkable retention as well for a beer so high in alcohol, but i'm guessing there's enough hops and grain in there to keep it solid and dropping some seriously nasty lace.  S- sweetly smoked and incredible. chocolate milk, cocoa and coffee hit the nose right away followed by smoldering pecan wood and the dried mellow aroma of figs and dates. smells so roasty and savory that notes of smoked pork shoulder rubbed with brown sugar and black pepper come to mind in the midst of pungent charred grapefruit and oscuro and maduro ciga wrappers. a floral pineapple lily apple whiff of alcohol is present, but neatly tucked beneath the blanket of roasted malt aromas.  T- dark chocolatey sweet from start to finish and long into the finish for that matter with the damn near exact flavor of lingering 80% cocoa melting softly over the palate. it's sweet like extra dark fudge brownie sweet, but by no means is it cloying or sugary. the full deep roasted flavor is so intense, backed by resinous hop bitterness against the burnt wood bitterness, the sugary isn't even an option. alcohol aromas appearing as the brew warms reflect on the taste as well, intensifying the dark fruity tart side of the flavor profile. think lemon, orange, and grapefruit rinds along with figs, dates, and black currant all left to pickle in a jar of molasses, burnt mixed nuts, charcoal, a pinch of salt, and a dash of balsamic vinegar. that's the best way i can describe it. lit oscuro cigar, damp wood, rich black soil, sandalwood incense, super strong espresso, and burnt pork. keep in mind that while all this is going on, dark chocolate flavors are unabated and continuously present, contrasting and complementing every subtle nuance of this insanely complex craft beer from a can. another puff of smoke on the swallow, and an extremely long finish of all the tastes above fading to penetrating hop flavor.. to roasted.. to dark chocolate.  MF- slow lazy lethargic carbonation, as if the bubbles just can't push through the turgid sludge to make full contact with my tongue. they feel like stomping bubbles marching over a blanket of gel, their impact significantly reduced. thanks in part to the addition of oats, the body is creamy beyond words-- like melted chocolate and whole cream and so decedent and rich and warming that this could seriously be an ice cream topping. drying on the cheeks thanks to massive alcohol (their website states 10.5% which is appropriate) and sticky on the lips thanks to the abundance of malt sugars and microscopic particles. there's alot of thanks goin on.  D- i couldn't have another one of these right now. one is enough. i need something that will wash the much of my palate. nevertheless, the complexity of flavors and the feel of this brew keep me comin back for more. the smoky dryness and sticky graininess incline me to take sip after pleasurable sip to relieve the roasted condition of my lips and cheeks but the only that could do that would be a toothbrush and lots of toothpaste. so in that sense, one can is entirely drinkable and in many ways too small, but this brew is too rich and powerful to be anything but a treat for me.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S - The aroma is a strong mix of roasted malts, bitter cocoa, and alcohol. There is no hiding the alcohol content in the nose.  T - Smooth chocolate coats the palate with the roasted malt characteristics coming through in the finish. Judging by the aroma, I expected this to have a strong alcohol flavor, but suprisingly its well hidden. A hint of floral hops in the finish.  M - Heavy bodied with a thick mouthfeel. Low carbonation and very smooth.  D - This is the way I like my RIS's to look and taste. Strong complex flavor and dark as night appearance!! Great thick bodied and mouthfeel that coats the whole palate and leaves the flavor hanging long after the swallow.

Cracked it open and poured what looked like pitch or tar into a glass that at first gave no indication of carbonation at all. Slowly some sneaky bubbles gave rise to the darkest head I've seen. It kept rising into a frothy foam that was very promising. Faded to nothing with no lacing. Left a very intimidating inky brown/black opaqueness.  The smell is pretty quiet compared to the rest of the beer. Roasted malts dominate.  Great flavor of balanced sweetness, malts, and a bittering finish that is perfect as an offset to the initial maltiness.  Big density and light-medium carbonation actually leads to a great mouthfeel and perhaps the most drinkable stout I've had. Stupendous beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BeerAdvocate,4.5,"Beer review from BA Mag Dec 2007.  An Imperial Stout in a can--you've gotta love that.  Pours a motor oil consistency, ink black, dark as Satan's heartless soulless pit, liquid that's crowned with a thick, rich-looking coffee-colored head--hold the cream and sugar. Aroma is surprisingly soft with some fresh grain, hint of smoke and estery, dark ripe fruits taunting in the back. Creamy mouthfeel, full-bodied, viscous, with a rich malty base. Tangy molasses, molten chocolate cake, major roastiness going on with more smoke, char, double espresso and burnt raisins. Overripe black cherries. Bitter, but not puckering, more of an overall acridness that engulfs the palate. Hop presence is leafy, herbal, earthy, with a hint of lemon--barely detectable in the black chaos. Alcohol is well hidden, but sneaks into your brain eventually with a warming fuzz. Finish is exactly like you just had a double chocolate chip cookie in your mouth.  This one puts the ""A"" in ""Holy crap!""",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jagoffyinzer,4.4,"Pours pitch black with almost no head. Tan lacing coats the glass and my taste buds begin to water. The aroma is roasty and malty. Slight hints of coffee and almost a hint of smokiness like it has some rauch malt. The taste is a deep roast balanced with a residual sweetness and a warming alcohol sensation. It almost has a bourbon taste to it or like it was aged on oak. It feels thick and smooth, it paints your mouth practically. This is a phenomenal brew but I don't think i could slug more than one back. Too much of an alcohol taste for me.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Ryan011235,4.25,"Poured into a snifter on 12/23/09  Canned on 12/22/08  Thanks to Freethyhops for throwing in this as an extra on my first trade  Pours a dark crimson brown; settles black. 1/4th inch head of hot chocolate colored foam dissipates quickly, though swirling revives a thin layer for a short time. Such is retention. Lacing is decent in real time but doesn't last, save for a few spots here & there.  Big chocolate aroma with mild sweetness. Roasted malts; hint of toffee & molasses. Earthy notes around the edges with nutty undertones. The nose seems more potent than complex. Not that that's a bad thing. On the contrary it's quite good.  While the nose is impressive, this beer tastes outstanding (especially considering the sweetness). Chocolate runs the game with some roasted malts & dark sugars blending in with much reserve. This is essentially like drinking a candy bar that a mix of milk & dark chocolate at a 60/40 ratio. Bold flavor does not shy on sweetness. Almost too sweet. Faint earthiness calls to mind hops past; never quite musters bitterness though.  Full body; quite heavy actually. Carbonation is very low, creamy & smooth. Though a bit slick upfront, there's a lot of grittiness - awesome. Mild alcohol heat. Interestingly enough, a little bitterness makes it to the finish.  This is good stuff indeed. Not overly complex, there is flavor to spare. More bitterness would be ideal, in my opinion. Other than that, no complaints. If you're going to do a very sweet Imperial Stout, this is how it's done. Recommended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Gouxman,4.25,"This Imperial Stout came out of the can looking like straight motor oil. As I poured it into my snifter the opaque brew resided with a dark brown head.  The aroma is full of roasted malt, chocolate, and molasses.  This brew is rich and flavorful with hints of roasted malt, licorice, molasses, cocoa, and smoke.  The mouthfeel is super smooth as it coats the touch. The finish lingers for a while, but in a good way. There is a slightly sweet and bitter bite on the end of the palate.  For a 9.5% Imperial Stout the drinkability is quite high. I could drink one of these every night for dessert.

No hop aroma and no diacytel.  T: Roasted almost burnt dark malts dominate. With out hints of other flavors. The finish was alcoholic.  M: Slightly astringent roasted malts finishing with a high degree of alcohol warmth that lingered into the finish.  D: I drank this beer on a 10th mountain division hut trip in the rocky mountains. After carrying this beer 13 miles into the woods I was disappointed by burnt and alcoholic flavors.

There's a little espresso in there as well, and a touch of bitterness in the finish. It's much more complex than the smell would make you think.  M: Not quite as thick or chewy as I would have liked though a nice aftertaste, and perhaps a bit under-carbonated for me.  D: Very high.

(4)  S - Predominantly roasted malts with a dash of sweet molasses or caramel with, perhaps, a faint hint of coffee and chocolate. (4.5)  T - Starts with sweet caramel-flavoured, roasted malts upfront with dark fruity notes of rasins in the middle, nicely blended with a taste of chocolate, finally finishing with aromas of coffee and alcohol. A light bitterness lingers in the after-taste reminiscent of most stouts. Very complex and simply impressive. (5)  M - Fairly thick and creamy in the mouth with a tad of carbonation; goes down creamy smooth with mild alcohol warming; close to perfect for this style (5)  D - Very well-balanced Russian Imperial Stout overall with little flaws and is deceptively easy drinking despite the 9.5% ABV.

This is definitely setting a very high standard for the Stone and Dark Lord Russian Imperial Stout that's presently sitting in my fridge.

2681,34483,IronLover,4.02,"Totally black color with a thick cocoa brown head that slowly dissipates. Sweet roasted malty, chocolaty, aromas, with hints of maple syrup and coffee. Thick and chewy feel. The carbonation slowly fights through the thickness to provide the full body feel. Big dark roasted malt flavor with a very smooth finish. The high ABV peaks through in the aftertaste, but is generally hidden in the big thick dark malt flavor. Very enjoyable.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Arithmeticus,3.88,"A: thick head; dark brown, very black S: sweet smell with chocolate and malty overtones T: outstanding, full-mouthed port-like stout; slightly brassy flavor detracts M: thick, rich  An outstanding beer worth having time and again. The can is unflattering on the shelf, but its hold on the carbonation can't be beat.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ChadQuest,3.91,"Pours as black as possible with a chocolate milkshake colored head. pouring something that looks like this from a can is quite an experience, its very odd to say the least.  aroma isn't the strongest, some vanilla, coco, and roasted malts.  Flavor is very balanced, balanced between roasty and sweet. i could see this being a RIS anyone could enjoy. Vanilla & carmel on the sweet side, with dark coco and italian roasted coffee on the bitter side.  This is the Gulf of Mexico in your mouth. Straight up Oil on your pallete.  Pretty drinkable, but not overwhelmingly so, the balance keeps it from getting cloying, but this isn't the type of beer that screams at me for another one, more like the kind of beer i'll have one of over an hours time.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,dbossman,4.08,"A: Black and thick out of the can with a brown thin head  S: Alcohol and roasted dark malts dominate; a bit grainy; some slight vanilla and coffee--somewhat subdued  T: Roasted dry malts but some subtle sweetness, a bit of vanilla, chocolate, and caramel  F: Really creamy and smooth--well balanced mouth coat  D: For what it is, this is quite drinkable; a very delicious big stout in a can...awesome!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,KAP1356,4.28,"Poured from one of the coolest cans I've ever seen into my snifter...  A - Black as can be. This is the darkest, blackest stout I have ever laid my eyes on. A great mocha/caramel color head forms about one finger in height.  S - Leathery, roasted malts, chocolate and some great coffee notes as well. Some dark fruits and an almost licorice smell seems to be present as well. This one smells like a big RIS and I'm hoping it is.  T - Coffee, chocolate, roasted malts. Sweet up front; I assume from the chocolate that is present but then the roasty goodness takes over the back of the palate. There is a bitterness as well from the coffee and malt.  M - Smooth and creamy. Just an excellent feel. Just the right amount of carbonation which makes this a velvet like RIS.  D - The alcohol is well hidden here which makes it that much more enjoyable to drink. I think a can or two could easily be done by one person.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Spica66,4.35,"A: Dark, black beer. Very slight head, not a lot of retention. Minimal carbonation.  S: Smells of molasses and dark malt. No hops in the nose.  T: Very light molasses taste followed up with excellent roasted barley taste. Very nice bitter coffee finish.  M: Incredibly creamy, nearly sticky. Very nicely done.  D: Very easy to drink and enjoy.  Very good beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,HeckYeah,4.73,"First had this beer on tap at the Viking in Spokane WA. Had to get it again.  A: poured into a pint glass from the can, this beer is one of the darkest known to mankind. This beer absorbs light...in fact, it emits darkness. When i hold it up the the light, the room dims. A very minimal brown head quickly dissipates into some thin swirly bubble patterns and a ring of tight bubbles around the perimeter.  S: Smells like sweet molasses drizzled over dark roasted barley. Alcoholic vapors when you exhale through the nose.  T: Roasted barley, then semi-sweet molasses, then bitter and burnt mocha. Alcohol at the end, but matched well with the bitterness.  M: The carbonation of this style of beer should be minimal, and Oskar Blues does it perfectly. Drinking this beer is like pouring tar over your tongue. The viscosity perfectly engulfs your taste buds and fills your mouth with rich, powerful, sticky flavor.  D: After 9.5% ABV, an abundance of flavorful malts, and the sensation that your mouth was just paved with thick, fresh tar, i could only drink 13-14 of these beers in a row.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,WeedKing4,4.18,Pours a dark black with a nice thick one inch layer of caramal brown foam. The taste is of nice roasted malts with coffee and dark chocolate lingering in the finish. Very fucking smooth and drinks so damn well. No hint of the 9.5% alc in any sip of this at all. Hope I get the chance to pick up some more of this in the future.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,airohead2001,3.98,"12 oz can poured into a snifter.  A - Good looking beer. A vigorous pour yields a one finger light brown head that sticks around for a minute or so. Great legs that coat the walls of my Westvleteren snifter.  S - Typical smell of an imperial stout - coffee, roasts, leather, and malts.  T - Great! Far better than I was expecting. Coffee, chocolate, alcohol, roasted malts, bitter finish. Not the most complex RIS in comparison to others that I've had, but still a great tasting beer, especially from a can. The few flavors that do come through, however, are really wonderful.  M - Just the right amount of carbonation and thickness.  D - Very, very drinkable. I split this can with FluffyFactor, and I certainly would have had no problem drinking at least one or two cans on my own. The alcohol is well hidden. All in all, this beer has certainly exceeded my expectations.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bluejacket74,4.47,"Once again, thanks to jgasparine for this great brew! 12 ounce can, canned on 9/25/2009. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch brown head. Head retention is decent, with a small amount of lacing. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, molasses, and some dark fruit and licorice. Great malty aroma. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, coffee and a bit of dark fruit. Starts off sweet, and then has a slight bitter roasty finish. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's velvety, sticky and creamy. Drinkability is pretty good, it's nice and smooth and very easy to drink. I think this is a good overall brew, luckily I have 3 cans left so I know I'll have some to try another day.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Interestingly enough I bought a single of this beer at the new Whole Foods in Dedham. This can has sat in my fridge for the past month and finally I get to taste this brew.  Pours an ink black. Opaque in appearance. Deep, dark black with a khaki colored head on top.  Roasted malt nose with some dairy notes.  Wow, a robust and full Russian Imperial Stout. A style of beer that I truly cherish with serious dark chocolate flavors with a Hershey syrup sweetness breaking through. Some sips remind me of an espresso shot with it's sharp bitterness and it's roasted goodness.  This beer is also a tad sweet with some sugar and dextrin. Perhaps a touch of dark fruit, like cherry. A wonderful bitter hop snap finishes this beer.  The 9.5% ABV is borderline unbelievable. A nice stout that captures the complexities of this style.  Hats off to Oskar Blues for creating an excellent beer!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,dpodratsky3,4.36,"Thanks to AgentZero for this one, I've wanted to try it for a while, but never got around to it.  12 oz can poured into pint glass  A: Poured fairly gently, has a small brown head that settles to some film covering right away, looked like really melted chocolate syrup pouring out of can, dense looking, just really rich appearance, deep brown with some lighter brown hues  S: Hops kind of hide in the aroma, the only thing that gives away their presence is in the very end, almost a fusel-y note, like a burning, but not an unpleasant one, really big roasted malt notes, sweet chocolate for sure, not too much coffee, a hint of molasses, but not that really sour kind  T: Malt note is intense, and the hops don't dominate like I thought they would at such high IBU's, however with such big notes it needs big balance, bitterness is present right from the beginning, but also that roasted coffee bitter, they go hand in hand and won't let your palate relax, that kind of syrupy sweetness starts to take over after that and big sweet chocolate notes, but then the hops come in and prevent it from turning into a ""sweet"" beer, the hop notes are almost DIPA like, they use that big sweet malt in the same way, hops still manage to taste juicy, crazy  M: Really thick, its like melted ice cream in a bowl thick, but after you swallow it doesn't disturb you at all, not unpleasant, I think it needs a big body for its flavors  D: High, despite the crazy intense flavors and thick mouthfeel the glass did not last long, even at 9.5%  Notes: This surpassed the expectations I had for it, and they were very high because I have come to love everything from Oskar Blues. The flavors are just so big, descriptions can't do it justice.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The head stays present from start to finish. A very nice looking beer.  S- I smell the roasted malt flavor right off the bat. I am also picking up chocolate and some light coffee.  T- I taste the roasted combination of coffee, malt, and chocolate flavors. This beer is smooth and easily drinkable. For the high ABV you don't get any of that taste when you drink it. This beer goes down nice and smooth.  I have begun trying some of the Oskar Blues offerings and this is a very good one. A very nice tasting and easy drinking RIS beer that I plan on having again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Bendurgin,3.45,"Looks great. Poured this into a tulip. Pours black with about an inch of mocha head that isn't retained very long. The nose isn't very strong buy familiar RIS smells peer through; dark fruits, cocoa, and a hint of coffee. Dark fruits are most prominent and I feel like I'm really fishing for other aromas. Roasted malts and coffee take charge in the flavor. This beer is hot. I really tasted the alcohol and it lingers all throughout my mouth. After another sip and I notice more dark fruit characteristics, especially on the finish. Mouth feel is pretty nice but the burn makes it tough to really appreciate. This guy is a sipper, and I kind of regret opening this on one of the warmer days of the year. At 9.5 this beer is surprisingly hot to me. I feel like I had bigger beers with less noticeable alcohol presence.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,LittleDon,4.35,"Served in an 8 oz. glass (too full for a full pint) at Homemade Liquids and Solids. Jet black with a plentiful dark latte colored head. Coffee, oak, and caramel aroma.

Aroma is rich, enticing, and almost intoxicating in and of itself (10.5% ABV is in evidence).  Extremely rich flavor; notes of coffee, chocolate, licorice...basically everything you could ask of a stout. Creamy, syrupy mouthfeel adds to the experience.

The flavor profile and feel was phenomenal. Molasses/Brown sugar, with some coffee, some dark berry, dried fruit in there as well. Got to admit I had trouble focusing on the elements of the flavors becasue they were so well balanced. Just the right viscosity, very cohesive.  D - This one ain't about how many you can put away...  A great beer, probably my favorite RIS so far. (We will see how the Stone cellars) Not sure how it got any subpar reviews (maybe drink it in the sun on a hot day?), but they should seriously consider revisiting this one.

Dark oily brown, literally, as it gives the distinct impression of cracking open an oil can when this beast is poured. Tan head is small. Smells of rich dark chocolate and raspberries.

Mostly cocoa, get some slight coffee in there but not much. This is just majorly malty.  T - Huge roasted, almost burnt taste of cocoa. Nice roasted malts, little coffee, some caramel, and a slight bit of maolasses and brown sugar. It finishes a nice, dark, roasted bitter taste. This is very good.  M - Thick, full bodied, almost chewey. Appropriate amount of carbonation.  D - Got through one can no problem, other than the alcohol made me tipsy and it was fairly filling.

2681,34483,carolinabeerguy,4.3,"Can dated 11-02-09. Poured from a 12 ounce can into a pint glass. The can was only 9.5% ABV as the batch turned out a little weaker than normal according to an email response from the brewery.  Appearance: Pours a motor oil black color with a 1/2 finger dark chocolate colored head which dissipates quickly. No lacing.  Smell: Coffee, rich chocolate and dried fruits with just a hint of soy sauce.  Taste: Bitter unsweetened chocolate and coffee up front with hints of dried fruits followed by a strong alcohol bite in the middle ending with roasted malt at the finish. Mildly bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, thick and sticky. Not a lot of carbonation.  Drinkability: Pretty high despite the high ABV. I would definitely like another can but I only bought one.  Overall: Excellent representation of the style. This has just about everything you'd want from a stout. If you see it, ignore the price tag and buy it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

This chick don't look too good but what's inside is alluring. I'll get her number.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,GarrettMD,4.31,"This was on some magazine's list of top weird beers to try, so when I finally found it, I had to get it.  A- Pours like motor oil, literally. Most people say that about Imperial Stouts, but this was the thickest beer I have ever poured. Color is jet black with a 1 finger foamy brown head. This was also one of the darkest heads I have seen on a beer as well.  S- The smell was very malty, roasted malts, chocolate malts, just malts. No real alcohol scent even though it is 9.5% (at least as listed on my can). Slight hints of coffee, but not much.  T- The taste is very similar to the smell. Bitter roasted malts fill your mouth followed by a nice chocolate flavor coming with the slight alcohol burn.  M- The mouthfeel is great, this thick beer just sticks to the sides of your mouth. The slight alcohol burn is very warming, not anywhere near the burn you would expect from 9.5%  D- The drinkability is good for this ABV. It is still a slow-drinker, but it works well for that. As the beer warms the roasted malts take over the alcohol burn more and more until is really isn't noticeable. That could also be the alcohol taking effect, but either way, gets better as it warms.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,missingsense,3.77,"Pours a thick, motor oil black with a dark brown 1-finger head that fades quickly, but leaves a nice layer on top. No serious lacing. Smell is very enticing with cool extra-dark chocolate, cherries, and a slightly oaked scent. Mmm, I really like sniffing this one.  Some chocolate and coffee is noticeable in the taste at first, but the aftertaste is overpowered by alcohol, resembling cheap vodka. A Black Russian maybe? Mouthfeel is nice and fitting for the style, thick and chewy.  I really liked this beer when I had a small pour during a tasting, but polishing off a whole glass is not quite what I'd hoped. The alcohol taste is just a little too much and leads to a slightly unpleasant finish. For the same price, I could get 2 Old Rasputins or a 550mL Samuel Smith, which are much more drinkable to me.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,prsguitarsr4me,4.65,"Definitely not cheap, but well worth it. This beer pours near black with a dark espresso colored head at the end of the fast pour. Not a huge head, but nice. Smell is intense chocolate and toffee - very sweet and bright. The taste is fantastic - full of caramel and lots of chocolate. I'd like to taste the aged versions for a darker overall taste. The feel is incredibly creamy without being too heavy - not too thick - very easy to take down. I would never guess that it is 10.5% alcohol (other than the name of course) - feels more like 7-8%. The smooth and not too intense overall feel of the beer makes for an exceptionally drinkable RIS for me. If it was cheaper I'd be drinking this all the time, but at $4.50/can, it'll remain a once-in-a-while drink.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,djmichaelk,4.08,"12oz can into a snifter.  A - Black as night, with a mocha-colored one-finger head that receded to nothing, just maybe a slim ring around the edge. No lacing at all.  S - Dark chocolate and black cherry at first, followed by brown sugar and toffee.  T - Dark chocolate is dominant, with those same black cherries along with it in the front. French roast coffee follows, plenty of alcohol -- it's not too hidden, although it's not out of place. The finish is more cherries and dark fruits, and burnt sugar.  M - Thick and velvety; very pleasant. For a RIS, this is just about perfect. Coats the mouth and then recedes without overstaying its welcome.  D - Pretty boozy, even for a RIS. I'm buzzed after one, but the flavor keeps me wanting to come back for more.  Overall - This is one of my favorite RISes when I don't care about subtlety. There are others that might be more nuanced, but when I want a powerful example of the style, this is where I turn.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Looks like thickened motor oil, it coats the glass  S - Giant molasses/brown sugar smell, dark roasted malts, raisins, and very faint hops.  T - A lot of sweetness from the molasses hits right away, the roasted malts comes through in the middle, also has some dark fruits, and dark bread, man there is a lot of dark in this beer.  M - Full bodied, super creamy and viscous.  D - This is a heavy hitting beer, has huge amounts of flavors, great mouthfeel, terrific smell and appearance.

A: Dark as knight with a 2-finger brown head that dissipates into a ring.  S: Maple syrup and some dark oak, chocolate, and coffee aromas.  T: A perfect blend of roast, sweetness, and dark chocolate melded together. Even a littler bitter aftertaste from the hops.  M: Smooth and luxurious. Not that much carbonation but works well with the style.  D: With the ~10% ABV this one stands out in the drinkability amongst the masses of delicious RIS's out there.  Overall, a stunning beer for the $3-$4 price tag.

Rich roasted malt aroma with a hint of sweet fruit. Very good but big roasted chocolate malt initial flavor that finishes with a chocolate, slightly alcoholic aftertaste. I started typing mouthfeel before flavor. It is excellent, thick and smooth, not too syrupy, but thick. I almost want to chew it. I don't ever really want more than one of these, but I would take one at any time - winter, summer, right now. What does that mean for drinkability? This is a great beer.

Chocolate. Alcohol. This is BIG-big.  This is really great for the style, very faithful. I cannot however give it highest marks, because, well... I'm biased, and faithful.

Well, considering this is the best stout I've ever had...  A: The new record holder for thickest, most oily pour I've ever seen. It comes out of the can looking like something that would make Daniel Plainview lick his lips. Aside from being black as night and thick as thieves, this beer leaves a dark brown barely-one-finger head in its wake and beautiful lacing that never ever goes away.  S: Hershey's chocolate syrup and a little bit of coffee on the nose. Very strong scent, and a downright irresistible one at that.  T: Can't I jump right ahead to mouthfeel? Hold on, taste, I'll be right back...  M: The first thing, even before your tastebuds realize that they need to stand at attention, that you'll notice when you take a sip of this beer is just how thick and smooth it feels. I don't know who wouldn't enjoy this sensation on their tongue, but I don't want to know 'em if they're out there. Pure perfection. The slightest bit of boozy resin coats the tongue and leaves your mouth wanting more. It's absolutely impossible not to want another sip. Okay, back to the taste...  T: Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, a little bit of anise and licorice... it's all good and it's so well balanced that it's not too bitter and not too sweet. The aftertaste was described by my girlfriend as being reminiscent of soy sauce, and I can't say I disagree with her, it's almost salty and savory on the finish with a little bit of alcohol burn. I'd dip sushi in this stuff any day, quite frankly.  D: Anything that looks, smells, feels, and tastes this good has to get a perfect score in this category. Depending on who you are, it might take you a while to drink, but I swear - if I had a straw handy, I could take down a 4 pack of these in about 20 minutes. And then become horribly ill, of course.

2681,34483,brewerburgundy,4.23,"12oz can, Sam Adams glass, same vintage as below, 12/22/08. Drunk on 5/27/10, a five month difference from the below review. Scores are averaged and rounded up.  I would still say this is an inpenitrable shade of crude brack (brown + black..). At first I was afraid there'd be no head; one formed, but not a big one. Black as night beer with whisps and foam and lace in this-is-truly-a-dark-chocolate-mocha brown. 4.5  Chocolate, graham cracker, chocolate graham cracker, cinnamon, Aztec chocolate, Belgian-like dark fruit. Very sweet with raisin, dark molasses rum, chocolate liqueur, and dark chocolate covered almonds. 4.5  Huge dark fruit. Currant, raisin, plum, prune too, and then the rum soaked version of all these. It isn't boozy, but I would like to point out that my can states 9.5% abv as opposed to the 10.5 of this page. There is the impression that warming will bring out some alcohol burn. A tiny bit of roast is starting to show up, coupled with maybe some hop bitterness. The coffee peeks in at the end but isn't the espresso with bitterness that it was five months ago. These do little to stem the tide of dark fruity sweet flavors. Chocolate is present but also slight. Thankfully the sweetness cuts a bit with warmth. 4  A little syrupy with a shocking little burble across the tongue. Where did those bubbles come from? 3.5  Are you kidding? A 9.5% abv hyper-sweet Imperial Stout drinkable? No way, I doubt I'll drink this more than twice a year. 2.5  12 oz can to Sam Adams glass. This particular treat was canned on 12/22/08.  Black as night. Truly the darkest I've seen and honestly like crude, as so many testify. The only highlight is a fingernail thin ruby at the bottom edge of my new Sam Adams glasses. Darkest head I've seen too, milk chocolate. 5  Slightly boozy, huge toffee, caramel nose calling to mind their Old Chub scotch ale. Moderate roast note, though it is of rich darkness, not burnt. Cherry or raisin, currant note. Phenols as the glass warms. 4  Huge toffee, espresso, dark chocolate with the emergence of a sweet dark fruit. Burnt sugar. The hops must be providing some of the bitterness but any spice or other flavor that seems to be hop induced is escaping me. 5  A little sip is a mouthful. Substantive, chewy, viscous, more than a liquid this is. I love it, it's bursting with flavor from every seam of the can. 5  Intelligence will dictate a limit of one a night I'm afraid. Yum.

2681,34483,trevorjn06,4.01,"This is an imperial stout and it pours real thick, like oil. It has a dark brown head and smells fairly mild, a little roasty. It tastes smooth and rich, hints of chocolate and a thick feel in the mouth. It has a bit of a warm alcohol feel on finish. This stout is quite good.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Beerandraiderfan,4.34,"Great black pour, minimal head, great cherry cola look to what is there. Sticky. Aroma, very fresh feel to it.  Taste, wow, very similar to Abyss (pretty soon Abyss will only be 1% bourbon barrel aged to make this a more legit comparison). Smooth. Velvety chocolate feel, few hops. Goes down so easily, but little nuance of cinnamon with it, yet not too sweet. Even a little vanilla.  I resisted trying this for so long, $16 for a 4 pack of cans just didn't seem right. I was wrong.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Beefeater57,4.6,"A: Opaque. Light isn't going through this one. Thick, clumpy brown head that looks just like oatmeal. Pretty much like engine oil out of a can, which is what I expect from an Imperial Stout.  S: Licorice, strong semi-sweet chocolate presence. Some espresso, roasted malts, and brown sugar/molasses.  T: Smooth. Sweet roasted maltbase, some milk chocolate notes, some dark chocolate, and a grainy hop bitterness to balance it out a little.  M: It's a meal in itself. Chewy, hits the lips like a milkshake. Very smooth beer, silky. Some alcohol warmth after a few sips.  D: One of the best Imperial Stouts I've had, goes right up with Stone's. The thickness and ABV limits drinkability, but you just need one and call it a night. This is what I expect Imperial Stouts to be. Too bad this beer is costly, because I would consume it often. This is a rare treat to myself whenever I feel like giving my beer-lovin' soul a high-five.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,EvilGnome6,4.75,"Poured from a can into a Belgian tulip glass.  A: Pours a syrupy, oily jet black with a small tan head that settles into a small film after a few minutes. Very little carbonation; just enough to create a head when pouring. Leaves an oily film on the glass with delicate lacing.  S: Strong black coffee and dark chocolate. There's also a subtly sweet roasted scent that is quite pleasing. Maybe a touch of dark caramel.  T: Salty black licorice, dark chocolate and espresso. The flavor explodes like a biting into one of those liqueur soaked cherry chocolates. Has a touch of sweetness with just enough bitterness to keep if from being cloying. A small hint of vanilla bean in the finish.  M: Dense and creamy. The flavors cling to your mouth and lips and slowly fade. Goes down like a rich chocolate milkshake.  D: Very drinkable for its richness. No, this isn't something your could chug down or drink all day, but that isn't the point. It's a delicious and incredibly decadent treat that should be savored with every sip.  Overall: Incredibly good. Very accessible for such a rich flavor that belies its strong alcohol content. The only hint if its strength is how quickly your head will start spinning. I would definitely drink this again and would drink it regularly if it wasn't so darn expensive.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,sadie23,4.8,"A: Thick, rich, dark liquid with dark fine bubbles in the thin head.  S: Deep coffee candy smell that reminds me of my grandfather's house when I was young.  T: Licorice coffee taste, maybe more like espresso nibs. Unsweetened dark chocolate, light alcohol taste considering the ABV.  M: Not as thick feeling as it looks, but creamy.  D: I would like to eat this with an expensive bar of chocolate. I will definitely drink this again, probably just 1 can at a time because it's relatively expensive.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S: Nice mild cocoa, roasted malts and aromatic coffee/espresso.  T&M: Smooth, ultra-smooth, full bodied stout with a creamy, rich espresso flavor that is incredible!  Excellent stout. Just about the best I've ever had in any 'stout' category.

Heavy nose that texturally pushes outwards to gain as much ground as possible, licorice, white cake mix, toffee, baker's chocolate, café au lait, not overpoweringly sweet nor sugary, as much white grape and apricot fruit as cherry or plum scents, vanillin booziness, brazil nuts, there's plenty of different scents in there but they don't quite cohere into a choral whole. Full-bodied, dense and slooow moving, oily texture. Coconut, butterscotch, caramel, coffee, carob and chocolate covered raisins, darker complexion to the fruit here, cherry and blackberry with only a brush of apricot. The carbonation itself is slow if steady, more like a drip from a leaky faucet than a steady stream. More roast to it when warmer but, conversely, sheds some weight. More intensity of flavor and it's a right up with the best.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

There are scents of toasted marshmallow, smoked meat, coco, coffee, and horehound. Nicely balanced. The scents are nice, just a little weak for the style.  The flavors match the nose well. Again it seems a little week for the style, but dam tasty none the less.  The mouthfeel is sticky and flat with nice medium body.  Verry drinkable.

I've had alot of stouts and this is right there with Old Engine Oil as the thickest, blackest stouts I've seen. Minimal tan head with barely any lacing at all.  S: Alot going on---molasses, coffee, dark chocolate, licorice, vanilla, little tobacco and very roasty  T: As mentioned above, alot going on---all that is listed in the smell but also there's a lingering bitterness that rounds it all out very nicely.  M: There is very little carbonation but in this case it's very nice. Very thick and syrupy as evidenced from the pour.  D: This one went down very smooth and quickly. I'd definitely go for another if I had one but that might be it.  It's really nice to know that this RIS is widely available in many stores nearby. A very solid, enjoyable stout.

2681,34483,scarfield,4.13,"Looked like well-used motor oil coming out of the can, seemed almost thick as it came out out of the can. I was wondering if any head would eventually appear but after about half the can was poured a small head appeared for about as long as it took me to smell the beer. The smell is vague but could pick up slight notes of burnt fruit, definitely not as strong of a smell as other beers of this style. The first taste was surprisingly complex considering the simplicity I picked up in the nose. Roasted toffee and malt at first, bit of burning sensation on the way down and leaves a dark chocolate and coffee bean taste in the mouth after swallowing. Minimal lacing through the glass as I finish.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Deep black with a chocolatey brown head that didn't hang around long. Very complex on the nose, notes of toffee, sweet cherry, chocolate. Wow. Soooo smooth. The alcohol is very well hidden, yet at the same time you get the feeling, a few of these and you'd be feelin no pain. Finishes remarkably clean compared to its stylistic peers.  This could be served after dinner in a snifter or cordial and impress the finest port and brandy drinkers, and yet is drinkable enough to enjoy a few full glasses. The price is kinda rough, but I have to admit, I'm likely to buy it again for special occasions.

2681,34483,Briken,3.86,"First of all, thanks to beertunes for this one!  Ten FIDY pours a deep brown just shy of black with a big brown head. The aroma is an overwhelming molasses, like wiping blackstrap under your nose although it did calm down enough to notice a little licorice. The taste is very similar. It was kin to licking a taste of molasses and swallowing a little water. It eventually calmed down as well but went almost directly into bittersweet chocolate mode where that was all that I could taste. Near the end a little licorice and smoked barley came through but not enough. A sweet alcohol retro-olfactory is present throughout. The mouthfeel has a good imperial stout mouth-coating but is fairly smootth with just a bit of a syrupy feel and good carbonation to make it go down easier.  I must say it slmost unnatural to see something that dark come out of a can, and I mean that in a good way. I wonder if this gets a few bonus points for being from a can but overall it is a pretty easy drinking imp stout that is hard to stay away from.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JoePat,4.18,This beer pours a dark black spent motor oil color with a thick dark mocha colored head. The smell is strong and fruity with some chocolate flavor. It tastes like chocolate roasted malts. Smooth and chocolately with some fruity undertones. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Almost light and fluffy feeling. With this mouthfeel this beer is very drinkable especially for a 9.5% Imp Stout.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Very tasty stout.  M: Smooth, thick and syrupy. Very little carbonation.  D: I could easily drink more than one of these - despite the high alcohol content.  Summary: This is a good stout.

Sublime.  M: Flatish, still good, for the style but a bit flat, didn't take away from the flavor at all, just made it smooth.

Produced a good brown colored head that dissipated down to bubbles after a minute or two.  (S)- A rich roastedness that is actually rather toast-like. Bits of coffee & raisins. Dark cocoa amidst some bread-like nuances.  (T)- Pretty much just like the smell. A depth of roasted malts with flavors ranging from toast, molasses, raisin, coffee, & cocoa. Rather bread-like. Has the tiniest hint of licorice.  (M)- A good carbonation level & balance. Malt-tastic! A wealth of robust roasted flavors with only a mild bitterness. Has a rich body that is surprisingly smooth. Hides the 10.5%abv extremely well.  (D)- A solid to great stout, but more importantly, probably the best beer I have had out of a can!

Feels thick like syrupy, with a very mild carbonation tingle on the tongue. Warms going down.  Very good. Don't let the can fool you. Has to be in my top three RIS that I've had so far.

The flaovr starts off chocolatey a turn into a culmination of molasses and hops. Sure, there are background notes of coffee, roasted bread, (yes, I meant roasted bread) and chocolate, but the molasses really sticks out in this one as the backbone flavor. Maybe even some soy sauce in there. The drinkability of this beer varies.

2681,34483,wheatyweiss,4.19,"Poured from a twelve ounce can into a snifter.  Pours an intense deep black. Completely opaque, when held to the night none makes it through. Small head is short lived and settles to a cap. Swirling brings legs all around the glass.  Aroma is dark fruit, sherry and darkly roasted grains. Sweetness of the malt brings date and raisin aroma. Middle brings dark chocolate and hops. Hops are resinous and piney but muted against the huge aroma of the grain. Maltose and dextrose are big on the aroma with a slight amount of alcohol whiff. Finishes with a dusty slightly smoky aroma.  Taste opens with a huge hit of darkly roasted grain. Chocolate and dark fruit. Booziness creeps in but is not solvent. Oatmeal with molasses and burnt grain. Hops give a bit of balancing bitterness but are beat back by the malt. Coffee notes come into play with cocoa powder and dark spiced rum. Finishes dry even though it is sweet as hell.  Mouthfeel is thick, sticky and viscous. Carbonation is low to non existent. Velvety smooth on the tongue and slightly coating.

M- Syrupy to no end, low carbonation, and (thankfully) more subdued on the bourbon aftertaste than much of the other super extreme imperial stouts out there.

This was so cool to see a thick black stout pour out of the can . The big bombers add drama and class to the proceedings but the can has many advantages.  The nose was only thing on this beer not up to a very high standard. A little off and burnt and not indicitive of the lovely beer beneath.

A - Most say oil but if you pour from a good six inches into the glass you can see light at the end of the tunnel. Nice lacing on top of tulip glass. S - Mostly roasted malts with slight chocolate and molasses. T - Mine was very slight with roasty flavor due to age but toffee and molasses was very nice. The roast factor gave way to a slight bitterness which was enjoyable. M - For something thick it sure was silky smooth to drink.

T: Moderately sweet molasses flavor that finishes quickly with a heavy roasted malt bitterness.  M: Moderately thick with low carbonation. Bitter on the tongue.  D: A good beer, but not overly impressive. For me, the reason I drink stouts (and Imperial Stouts and RIS's) if for their complexity and this beer is lacking complexity.

2681,34483,deleted_user_357747,4.51,"A- One of the darkest stouts I've ever seen. Comes out the can blacker than oil and almost as thick and sticky. Not overly carbonated, still manged to get a decent size head which was super dark brown, gritty and fairly loose. Quickly fades to small floating patches. Pitch black, this sucker is imposing. I think I could feels it's presence from across a crowded room by sheer magnetic looks.  S- Rich burnt/toasted smells; astringent alcohol pads, earthy malts scents, balanced well by a hearty hops smells. Sweet, well roasted grains and big alcohol nose.  T- This is a pretty subdued imperial stout. I was expecting a sharp prickly taste, but actually I'm greeted more with thick chocolate malt goodness. Serious alcohol burn, though, this is one spicy meatball. Great balance, great simple nature, this is a straightforward RIS without trying to get too fancy. Burnt and earthy are most in play.  M- Spicy alcohol on the tongue, but pulls wonderfully smooth from the glass with a hearty thickness. A big, mouth-filling beer from a little can. Great feel.  D- A simple formula, great straightforward taste and excellent construction make this a joy to drink. This may be my new regular in the winter months. I loved drinking this.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jettjon,4.05,"From a can marked ""canned on 11-25-09"" into a glass, this one is pitch brown with a 1-finger dark brown cap which fades fairly quickly leaving a thin sheet atop the murky liquid and some lacing. Nose advertises a very sweet malt backbone with notes of molasses and cocoa powder. In the mouth, a fairly complex mix of sweet and dry flavors is on tap. Nicely complex, though a bit overly sweet, the malt is up front and bold, barely reined in by bittering hops which fight for control but are quickly overwhelmed by the nearly cloying malt sweetness. Notes of cocoa and molasses as the beer warms and opens up. This one is definitely best enjoyed warmer. Mouth is superb, very nicely chewy and extremely smooth and velvety. Drinkability is good; even though it verges on overly sweet I could drink 2-3 of these at a sitting. 9.5% ABV should be noted.  Overall: A very good imperial stout, verging on overly sweet but solid overall.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,coachdonovan,2.58,"the OB website says this is called Ten Fidy because of the ABV level. but both the can and this website say the ABV is 9.5%, so maybe they need to change the name to Nine Fidy. this one was ""Canned with Care"" in Nov 2009.  took this out of the fridge for about 30 minutes to let it warm up. not a single hiss when i open the can and it pours pretty flat with probably the most nonexistent head i've ever seen on a stout. completely completely black.  aroma and taste is stone fruits, dark chocolate, a little smoke. the alcohol is there too, and it's a little too hot for me. there is that textbook RIS stickyness. i could use some more carbonation to liven up the tongue and make things less syrupy. i'm glad i tried this one but i won't be going back again often.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,blivingston1985,4.56,"Ten-FIDY You are a beautiful RIS. Don't know that I've ever heard a Russian Imperial Stout abbreviated that way, but I like it and will continue to use it until it catches on, if it has not already.  Pour/Color- Ever held off on an oil change for faaar to long? That's the color. Not much head, as to be expected from a RIS. The head is a coffee-with-a-little-cream color. Lacing is all, but gone in a matter of second. Though, a ring does stick around for the length of consumption. I like that there is a complete lack of coffee to this beer. Not against coffee beers, but it is nice to have something that breaks away from what seems to me to be an overly common practice these days in your darker beers.  Smell- Molasses is right up front. Thick and strong. Slight alcohol. Chocolate and... tobacco? Read a few reviews where this beer was called ""too sweet"". I don't know if I would go as far as calling this sweet. A lack of bitterness doesn't equate to a ""sweet"" stout. Taste- Up front you get a nice chocolate and malt flavor. Very, Very smooth. The malt are strong in their roast characteristics, but no right away. The roasted aspect kind of creeps in at the last second before the aftertaste takes over. Minimal bitterness. Very pleasant.  Mouthfeel- Perfect.  This is a well rounded imperial stout. Does a lot of things that too many breweries don't do. Like, for one, keep it simple. Complexity is great, but in moderation.(If thats not too oxymoronic) This is a smooth, rich RIS that one could drink all the time.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S: Roasted malt, sweet chocolate malt, hint of vanilla, mild oak undertones  T: Big beer taste. You can taste all the layers found in the aroma, followed by a little alcohol bite. The hops don't jump out in the taste, but you know they are in there since this beer is so well balanced. Maybe a little hop bitterness in the finish.  MF: Thick, viscous, and layered.

The alcohol burns my nostrils. No Hop Aroma  T: Nice balance of the roasted malts and chocolate malts to where neither over powers the other. Nice Bittering Hop Balance. No flavor hops detected. Slight Alcohol taste.  MF: Real Creamy, Possibly some Oats or Flaked Barley, Warm, with the slightest alcohol burn surging up the nasal passages. I kept this can at 45F for 2 months and it feels warm in the mouth.  D: I'm only 1/4 way down the glass as I write this and I'm feeling the effect. A nice big beer.

The taste seemed to be coffee/chocolate, to me, a nice balance.  This beer is so smooth going down,sip by sip, you can drink alot of this. Then after awhile the 9.5% kicks in...Good Night.

A little bitter after biting through the foam. Once this warms its incredibly drinkable. Creamy mouthfeel. Not a whole lot of roasted barley. Nice oat flavor.

I'm not getting a huge aroma out of this, to be honest.  T- Getting some dark fruit, maybe plums or figs. A little bit of a bitter chocolate and coffee kick near the end. The fruit actually kind of blends with the coffee to create a unique and pretty damn good taste.  M- Thick. Almost syrupy. Just like a good stout should be. Its bordering on too thick though...but it doesn't hit that mark, at least.  D- My feelings are mixed. I've had worse Imperial Stouts, and I've had better. This falls somewhere in between.

Dark brown nearly opaque body, dark tan head slow dissipation with some nice spider leg trails down side of glass, a really nice looking beer. Nose is big chocolate hit, some roast, and a healthy dollop of floral hops for good measure. Taste is yummy, chocolate with a bit of smoke, quite a bit of hoppiness on back end.

Head slowly dissipates slowly and leaves a whole bunch of lace.  Smell: Not overpowering, but a bit of coffee and chocolate, even a bit smokey. Although overall not too powerful.  Taste: I get a lot of chocolate up front, then a malty background overwhelms the initial flavor and leaves a slightly licorice flavor. But I kind of feel that big malty flavor just stripped me of that nice lingering espresso/choco/smokey/etc flavor that makes me love a RIS.  Moutfeel: Heavy, but not as huge as Rasputin or Stone IRS.  Drinkability: I can definitely take down a bunch of these, but for the price, I think I'll stick with my favorites.  Notes: Overall I like this beer, I really do...but It doesn't really catch me the way others have. Will I recommend it? Yes, but after I recommend others.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Rich malt flavors, coffee, more roasted coffee, some chocolate, touches of dark fruit around a hint of hops returning to more malt.  M - Full bodied, creamy and smooth with adequate carbonation.  D - It actually works beautifully. One forgets the shortcomings of the aroma in this serving with such a rich taste and profile.  Notes: Hmmm, it had been a while since I had it last and I did not remember it this good.

I'm sooo excited for tasting this. Other smells? It has a richness and a metallic tang.  Taste is potent and meaty, with a metal bite and metal afterbite. A bit of a bitter kick to the end. It has some sourness that twists up my mouth, and it's super tasty. The middle flavor is dark chocolate and sour cherry, just enough to add a lot of interest and satisfaction without turning into a strictly chocolate beer.  I love this mouthfeel. It's rich, thick, with a tongue coating weight and just... it's like whole milk, or that superfood green juice. Like the they feel in my mouth, except this has carbonation. I love thick beverages, and this does the job well. The mouthfeel is incredibly satisfying.  This is so incredibly drinkable. But it's also 9.5% ABV. And it's expensive.

An extremely chewy stout full of chocolate, roast. They claim this has 98 IBU -- I didn't sense so much bitterness, but the heavy body & residual sweetness may have balanced it out so it seemed less bitter than it really was.

Medium brown head of fine bubbles is wispy but persistent, always sticking around edges of the glass and lacing nicely when swirled. Beautiful.  Aroma - 4.5 - Incredible mix of roast coffee, oak and alcohol. Reminds me of bourbon barrel stouts with its whiskey-like aroma. No hops in the nose.  Flavor - 4.0 - Very big beer that hits with a huge wave of hop bitterness that drowns out other flavors at first. After the swallow, the roasty, coffee-like flavors rise up as the bitterness fades. Only then does the alcohol burn start. The aftertaste fades surprisingly quickly. This is a little disappointing, but it does lend to the drinkability.  Mouthfeel - 4.5- Thick body with little to no carbonation apparent. Mouth-coating and sticky in a way that perfectly complements the flavors.  Overall Drinkability - 4.5 - Big, bold and satisfying.

On the nose, this beer is once again quite impressive. The aroma profile includes coffee, wet tobacco, leather, vanilla and a hint of cherry. Flavors replicate the nose in this moderately sweet beer, and the mouthfeel is full, rich and quite long. Drinkabilty is pretty good, though you can tell this is a big beer, with alcohol that becomes increasingly noticeable over time.

Roasted malts left on the palate with some oily slickness all over the mouth. Light hopping in the aftertaste with some chocolate flavors as well.

2681,34483,Reaper16,3.86,"12oz. can served into a snifter  Pours a inky black. Pretty damn black. There was no head upon the pour but an aggressive agitation produced nearly one finger of the darkest head I've ever seen. The foam was so tan it was almost orange! There isn't any lacing, not really.  Lots of roasted malts in the nose. Some burnt notes, some acrid notes. There is a touch of licorice and definitely some anise. There is a weird sort of smell that reminds me of a dog. Off-aroma? I hope so.  No off-flavors on the tongue, thankfully. Silky flavors of milk chocolate and dark fruits. Some heavy roast flavors for sure but they tend to show up on the back end of the drink. Some earthy hop flavors linger on the tongue after you swallow. Very nice but nothing amazing.  The mouthfeel? Pretty amazing. This is a thick, viscous imperial stout that is remarkable for two things. 1.) There is just enough carbonation to keep this from being more syrup than beer. 2.) This is thick, yes, but it is also very silky. It feels great rolling over your tongue. The superb mouthfeel goes a long way towards making a drinkable impy stout. The alcohol is amazingly well-hidden, which bumps the score up even more.  I don't know how old this can in. Other reviews suggest that Ten FIDY usually tastes more intense than what I experienced. This is a very, very nice beer regardless. Who knows; maybe the other can I have will be even better. If so I will revise this review.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,Flashsp2,4.43,"Poured into a snifter. Black as midnight, this brew almost chunks into the glass it's so immensely thick. Looks like used oil, and has about the same viscosity. Even with a hard pour there was very minimal head out of the can (which is still weird, a can), leaving a thin espresso head, and some light lacing. A quick swirl develops a fluffy head. Served in a thin stemmed tulip generates a larger, more pronounced head.  Aroma is intensely rich. Molasses, roasted malts, big boozy notes, and some light powdered chocolate.  Taste is rich molasses, a big warming alcohol, some roasty malt and dark chocolate. The molasses lingers all the way through, very rich, very decadent. This brew is a dessert all in it's own. The richness just lingers around forever, and a quick lick across the teeth seals the deal even further.  Mouthfeel is just thick and murky, like a blended up piece of chocolate cake. Carbonation is very low, which is kind of a bummer, but the remainder of the brew is so well executed that it more than covers this little flaw.

S- Smells of roasted malts with a good mix of chocolate and maybe some slight coffee in there. Also getting some sweet dark fruits.  T- Roasted malts with some coffee and definitely a solid dominating bitter sweet dark chocolate backround. Slight alcohol sting in the finish but not bad at all. Actually adds to the overall feel of the brew. Gradually gets stronger as it warms.  M- Wow. It's hard to find a beer that actually tastes full bodied to me and I have to say this is it. People always tell me a beer's to heavy or thick but I never got what they were talking about until now. Thick and syrupy full body with low carbonation and very little bitterness. But I gotta say despite the heavy mouthfeel, it's no where near heavy on the stomach. IMO it's making this brew insanely drinkable and smooth.  Overall I am really impressed with this beer.

Smells like roast, chocolate and liquid Maltesers, prunes and raisins and molasses. Very sweet and malty.  The taste is sweetly caramel, rich and chocolatey with lots of prunes and dates but despite these rich tastes it finishes dry and roasty. There's a nice lingering bitterness in the palate that cleans things up and makes this a moreish delight where you just can't wait to take the next sip. There's perhaps a little more residual sweetness than I would prefer, but that's just nitpicking.  It's a very full bodied beer that somehow registers a lot lighter than I think it really is thanks to a light lift of carbonation.

2681,34483,MasterSki,4.52,"Picked up a four-pack recently in Milwaukee, WI. Served in my Surly pint glass.  A - Pours with a quarter-finger of dark, dark, tan foam that dissipates to a haze and thick ring. Maybe a few specks of lace. Black body - no light penetrates this brew - that looks like oil when being poured from the can.  S - Lots of milk chocolate, roasted malts, fudge, nutty coffee and cream, and a surprising note of floral hoppiness. This is definitely a fresh batch we have here. Alcohol is well-hidden, and the aroma explodes from the glass.  T - The taste starts of with dark & milk chocolates, fudge, almonds, anise, and dark fruit sweetness. This morphs into roasted malt and coffee flavors that contribute bitterness that lingers into the finish and aftertaste. There's also some hop bitterness that mingles with the aforementioned flavors.  M - Slick, oily, silky, full body, with more carbonation than I remembered. The light carbonation is actually welcome here, as it keeps things from getting overly syrupy and heavy. This is reference quality for the style.  D - I drank a can in about 15 minutes without much of a buzz at all. Oskar Blues proves you make a big full-flavored stout without pushing the ABV into the double digits. The thing that keeps this from being even more drinkable is the bitterness - it could use a little better attenuation. Also - if you are crazy you can shotgun these!

Bubbles from the exact center of the glass came up and formed a four-part clover of swirling new head. Irrelevant, but cool...  S - I like it. Very strong baking chocolate smell - the kind that smells delicious but is really dry and ends up too bitter when you taste it. A little bit of anise, and just a hint of alcohol. No hops.  T & M - The same flavors from the nose are here, but barely. Now I remember why this beer didn't impress me before. It is slightly creamy but not full bodied, the alcohol is not well hidden at all, and there is an unpleseant bitterness in the finish.  D - I'm not giving up on this one, but it will take some time to finish. The flavors are big, just not enticing.  What a deceptive beer - first you notice it because it is a RIS in a can, then it looks and smells great, and then it just lets down big time in the taste. Weird.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,gnemesis,4.4,Poured from can to snifter. Thin brown head fades quick atop the pitch black oil in the glass. I get the scent of chocolate and a little molasses and perhaps toffee late. Roasted malts are also present. The taste is what I expected ecept for maybe a little more chocolate and a slight alcohol warming in the throat. This beer is big and full-bodied. Dangerously drinkable though a water break is needed between pours to restore the pallate. Another great beer suggested by richbrew.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Brent,3.63,"A RIS in a can - as an old-school bottle guy, still seems a bit odd. Perhaps the darkest pour I've seen - like squid ink. Nominal head. Very sweet malt flavors - molasses predominant, with some toffee in the background. ABV well integrated and lends a touch of pepper. Sweetness seemed a bit out of balance and bordered on cloying.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,DrDoitchbig,4.23,"This will be my first review of a can of beer that can be considering craft. Canned on October 1st, 2009. This puppy already has some age on it.  Appearance: This stuff oozed out the can like motor oil into an engine. This is definitely one of the darkest beers I've seen to date. Not even a whimper of light makes it through this beast. The head started off at a respectable finger's worth. Ridiculously dark brown, again one of the darkest I've seen. It faded relatively quickly, but left a collar that lasted throughout.  Smell: The first thing I'm picking up on is licorice. As in sweet Twizzlers brand black licorice, not anise. Though I think this could be the merging of the tones of anise and the dark chocolate. Perhaps a shade of alcohol plays a part in their as well. Beneath the two aforementioned aromas lies roasted malts and coffee grounds.  Taste: All the flavors are here from the aroma, but they take a slightly different order of dominance. The dark chocolate is slightly dominant of the licorice this time around. The licorice flavor continues to be relatively on the sweet side, but not to the point of being cloying. The roasted malts are a fair bit stronger than in the smell with the coffee flavors being confined to the lingering, bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: This is easily my favorite part of this brew. Huge, full body without the syrupy quality that often bugs me in these big boy stouts. Instead it's rich, velvety and smooth. Carbonation is a solid medium-low, but it's about as good as it gets for the style.  Drinkability: There have been times where it's taken me hours on end to finish an Imperial Stout such as this. But I believe I can chock that up to the syrupy body that I've found in some examples of the style. But this one, all things considered, goes down easy.  Overall I'm impressed by my first Imperial Stout out of a can. I can only hope that the other Oskar Blues brew I traded for (Gordon) is as good as this one was. Thanks to JosephLondon for the trade!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,kiddynamite920,4.2,"Canned 12-10-09. About 3 months old.  A: Good lord is this dark. Even the head is nearing brown. Head slowly developed but bloomed a bit as the pour increased. Dropped to a thin ring of mocha brown surrounding the glass. Looks like motor oil.  S: Smells of oak and roasty malts. Alcohol is still a bit on the forefont, the beer is only 3 months old. Get some sweet notes behind the alcohol. Vanilla and bourbon aromas are quite nice. Theres a bit of a chocolate syrup type aroma. Just a touch of raisin/plum smells. Very focused on the roasty malts. Smells fantastic.  T: A quick alcohol burn leads to a deep roasty taste profile. Could see this aging quite nicely. Some dark and sweet fruits are present. I also get vanilla and that oak I smelled on the nose. Bitterness comes way at the end and leaves the palate feeling dry like a highly tannic wine. Has a fruit soaked in brandy taste to it as well. Like cherries soaked in brandy, the sweetness is there but the alcohol in the brandy cuts it a bit. Very interesting.  M: Great mouthfeel. As stated above, the beer lends a tannic experience to the tongue. It is not a bad astringency, just leaves you wanting more. Hits the tongue smooth as silk and carbonation comes out right before swallowing as the tongue hits the roof of the mouth.  D: Might be hard to get through more than two of these, although it does sip quite nicely. So flavorful that you'd want to grab another but they are quite strong. Think I'll savor the rest of this one while finishing up a movie.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TheFightfan1,4.71,I had this at the craft beer outlet in Philly. Poured into a Cigar City pint glass. Damn does this stuff look like oil. Left amazing lacing and rings all the way down the glass and very thick at that. Opague black and had a brown heading.  Smell is all roasted malt with a heavy coffee aroma. There is a slight aroma of hops in this beer but very little until the big dark malts flexes it's muscle.  Taste is very similar to the aroma. Heavy dark malts with nice sting on the palate of hops. You can sense the hot booziness in the beer after the intial taste but is immediately replaced by the big malt in this beer.  Mouth is full bodied with very good carbonation and amazing velvety texture on the tongue.Leaves a heavy coffee aroma on the palate after a few sips.  Very enjoyable and very smooth.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,mroberts1204,4.68,"A - Pours black with a dark brown head. Looks like motor oil. Leaves decent lacing and head slowly dissipates into a thick brown ring around the glass.  S - Chocolate and brownies. Bitter bakers chocolate. Dried fruit, maybe fig. Very little alcohol. Smells great.  T - Loads of chocolate. Some nice roastiness with a little bitterness towards the end. Similar to the bitterness associated with coffee. The alcohol is completely hidden which is amazing considering the high abv.  M - Thick and creamy. Good carbonation for the style. Very smooth.  D - Extremely easy to drink. Had to stop my girlfriend from drinking it all. Could probably drink 3-4 of these in a night and regret it in the morning.  This is an extremely good beer. Almost perfect. Would love to try a barrel aged version.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,100floods,4.57,"Last of my four-pack. I wanted to age it, but the last time I drank it I debated whether or not it really needs aging. here we go.  pours pitch black with a dark copper head that fades away, only to leave some lacing around the edges. A little fizz here and there, but nothing noticeable on site. There's a few different aroma categories/groups I associate with stout and this one hits one of them on the head. Roasted malt, dark/semi-sweet/bitter chocolate notes. It kinda gives the illusion of some alcohol scents, but it didn't fool me this time. This one is smooth. The flavor leans more towards the dark and roasted flavors. Just enough carbonation to stir things up but not disrupt each sip. It works well with the roasty aspect. i would definitely sip this one. At 9.5%. I think the can also helped the pour. I've had a few other Oskar Blue beers and it's even easier to get a good pour with a can. Anyways. This is a smooth, highly enjoyable (and accessible) top notch stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,hawks10,4.28,"Russian Imperial Stout...from a can, AWESOME! Thanks to ""yourefragile"" for this extra in a recent trade...  12oz. can poured vigorously into my Delirium Noel snifter...  Pours a dense black, maybe a hint of mahogany...vigorous pour results in a thick one finger chestnut brown head that leaves a ring all the way down the glass...  As expected, roasted malts with some coffee hints dominate the nose. If you really try to sort through the complex scents, you can detect some vanilla and a mild hop presence as well...  Tastes like it smells; dark roasted malts, some sweet chocolate flavors, with a burnt coffee taste in the finish. I also pick up a molasses/syrupy subtlety as well. There is a slight burn on the way down...beer is balanced well between the dark malts, mild hopping and decent alcohol presence...  Smooth and creamy, coats the palette and gives a nice little 10%abv (or so) reminder on the lips and back of the tongue...  Only gets better as it warms, definitely something I'll sip and savor, took about 45 minutes to drink...will be trying this one again!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Vonerichs,4.23,"I had this on tap at Falling Rock in LoDo. The bartender must have some serious experience pouring this because it was the best looking stout I've seen. Jet black body, with an unbelievable head. The head was coffee colored, thick, dense, foamy, gush, gush, gush. After every sip there was a new cascading line left. By the time I was done there were chocolate rings every 1/2 inch all the way down the glass.  Great smell. Obvious roasted malts, a vanilla bean sweetness, and brownies.  Great taste, moves into contention for one of my favorites in this category. The bitterness of the burnt malts is offset by that vanilla and leaves with an aftertaste of marshmallow. Coffee graces the palate in the middle. It's a complex roller coaster of a stout.  Mouthfeel is rich, creamy, and smooth. Finish is slightly bitter but does carry a little bit of sweetness.  But for the 9.5% and being a nice filling meal of a stout, this is very drinkable due to the flavor profile.  I wish I had steady access to this in IL, but unfortunately I don't. The good news is that I have friends in the area and visit it on occassion myself, so our luggage just got heavier.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Bubba83,4.34,"Poured into a snifter at 50 degrees. Midnight black with a very dark tan head. Unfortunately, despite the most vigorous pour I could muster, I've come up with only about 1/4 finger width of head, and even that dissipates quickly into a thin ring. Some passable lacing exists, but it's on the low side. The beer itself appeared thick while pouring from the can, and swirling it around, it looks viscous.  Smells quite fantastic, lots of complexity here. Tobacco leaf, vanilla, roast, coffee, chocolate cake, dark caramel, cherries and some mild piney hops.  Tastes about how it tastes, but a little less complex. Yummy dark brownies followed up by vanilla, coffee, and finally cherries and some alcohol. Didn't get nearly as much of the hops as I thought I would, which may be a good thing since I didn't think the pine would meld too well.  Mouthfeel is also excellent, it's a heavy beer, quite thick and coats my palate well. Super oily, luscious, smooth and rich.  Drinkability is hindered a bit by some alcohol heat, but it's not overbearing and does add the nice cherry flavors. Also, it's so thick that it constantly reminds you how big it is. Overall this is one of my favorite Russian Imperial Stouts for being so unique, and it's probably one of the best beers to drink when you're feeling cold and dreary.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ricke,4.03,"Can.  A pitch black beer that looks really freaky as it pours from the can. A small brown head settles into a ring of lacings.  The aroma is quite powerful with notes of roasted malts, piny hops, chocolate, molasses, coffee and a hint of alcohol. Dangerously close to being a mess, but it keeps it together.  The smell is quite sweet at first with lots of chocolate and roasted malts, coffee and molasses. Hints of soy sauce. Then it turns fairly bitter with notes of bitter roasted aromas and piny hops. Strangely enough, although it feels powerful it feels like it lacks something in the middle. The finish is fairly warming with notes of sweet alcohol, roasted malts and hops.  Medium to full body, quite lively carbonation actually, but the mouthfeel i smooth.  This is quite a massive stout and it's constantly on the edge of collapsing into a sweet and bitter mess, but for the most part I think it manages to deliver. I had this at room temperature and I think I would have liked to have had it served a few degrees cooler.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Big 1'' of a dark brown head that quickly disappears leaving a slight film over the body of the beer. Solid lacing all the way down.  S- malts, dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, and maybe a hint of vanilla.  T- Bittersweet/dark chocolate chips right off the bat. Followed by roasted malts and dark goodness. The sweetness of molasses balances everything out pretty well. Then it ends up bitter once again on the backend. Slight burn, just enough to remind you that u are drinking a a brew that has a 9.5 ABV. It's good that it's there because it doesn't seem like it's that high.  M- It's got some nice thickness to it. It really coats your mouth and leaves you with all the complex tastes swirling around for a while. Leaves a nice lil tingle in the throat from the alcohol.  D- I'm really enjoying this one. Not drinking it to fast. I'm just taking it all in after another cold night in Florida...yup 40 degrees. This one is warming me up from the inside out.

Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. This one plops into the cup more than it pours really, it's that thick. Looks like an imperial stout should in my opinion. Pitch black with no highlights and one of the darkest brown heads I've seen. The smell is dark and roasty with some alcohol. The taste is pretty unique, one of the meatiest stouts I've had. The coffee, chocolate and dark fruits are all there, but there are also some soy/teriyaki sauce flavors in here which are kind of odd. It sounds odd but this stout has some very savory elements in it to me. Not bad but different. Mouthfeel is thick and warming. Drinkability is good for such a big beer.

A) Pitch black, 1 finger of dark brown foamy head that lasted a few minutes before settling into a ring.  S) I was surprised at how much the dark fruit smell stood out (grapes, prunes). Also plenty of roasted malt presence, burnt sugar, coffee.  T) Like the smell - again heavy on the dark fruits, coffee, roasty, malty, nutty, some alcohol taste and definite warmth.  D) Overall, excellent. At 9.5% ABV it is way too easy to drink several. For some reason I seem to recall this being more coffee tasting and less fruit tasting when I had this before.

The beer pours out of the can tar black, definetley one of the darkest beers I've seen. It pours very oily without much carbonation.

At the end a hint of hops.  The taset is very sweet start to finish with a light coffee bite at the end. Its not overly sweet or annoying, ist just a sweeter ris.  The feel is a little warm, but light, with a dry finish.  Overall, this beer is a fine ris.

A thin cap of brown, loose bubbles forms for an instant and collapses rapidly to a thin collar and a lingering and persistant swirl of bubbles on the surface.  S - Smells strongly of alcohol, coffee, a hint of vanilla, maybe a tiny hint of bourbon, licorice, and lots of dark fruits surrounding it all. Very complex.  T - Flavor is just as complex as the aroma. A bit hot with noticeable alcohol in every sip. Some creamy vanilla flavor comes on strong up front. Coffee with some licorice fills in behind the vanilla and is rounded out with some pruney flavors behind. A touch of caramel and its associated sweetness comes in at the finish.  M - Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and feels like it coats the entire mouth with its roasty, bitter and sweet flavors. Carbonation is low giving a nice creamy feel that complements the vanilla character to give a great smoothness to it.

T - Wow, expected a hot boozy over the top imperial stout but this was anything but. Good balance of bittersweet chocolate, roasted nuts, a little burnt caramel set off by a slightly bitter finish.

A deep, dark black, poured with very little head, but delightfully dark as night. Head is an off-brown cream. Smell is like coffee, malty, with dark chocolate and an enjoyable toasted finish. This seems to match the style exquisitely.  The taste is not overwhelming like other imperials I've head, but well balanced. Reminds me of the nose, with toasted chocolate - I cant think of a better flavor for winter. This is like drinking slightly burnt gingerbread. The mouth is sufficiently full, with very little bitterness. So very drinkable, but the ABV is high, and it'll hit you along the way.

The walnut head is not too much to speak of, rising up to about a half-finger at its zenith, but this completes the image of death: no head can survive when the presence of The End is so omnipresent. The aroma reeks with elements of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla, even an only slightly perceptible hint of smoke. The taste relies heavily on that dark roasted malt flavor, with bits of vanilla, cocoa, and, yes, even that smoke making cameo appearances. This guy sits heavily on the tongue, yes, but not so heavily as to give the experience a negative connotation.

Once in the glass, the brew is pitch black with one of the darkest tan heads I have ever seen. Usually I'm unsure how to rate appearance, but this one really impresses.  S: Strong aromas of mocha, espresso, and chocolate immediately meed my nose. Hints of sweet vanilla, molasses, and alcohol are also present. I know this wasn't aged in barrels, but the smell is reminiscent of some of the big BA stouts I've had.  T: Really great. Chocolate is the primary flavor I guess, but so much is going on here. There is a mixture of sweetness and harsh alcohol bite that balances out very well in this brew. Vanilla, molasses, toffee, and licorice all come through as the sweeter flavors. Maybe even some dark fruit too. The alcohol bite is reminiscent of bourbon and if I didn't know better I would guess this was barrel aged. Some bitterness in the finish can be attributed to some dark roasted malt and hints of coffee and espresso.  M: Rich and full, borderline chewy. The alcohol is hidden decently well, but you can definitely tell its there from the warming effects in your throat and chest.  D: A sipper for sure, but a great one.

Small hints of alcohola and coffee are evident.  t - Bakers chocolate is defintiely the best comparison I can think of for this taste. It's a bittersweet chocolate taste that jumps out at you at first, followed by a little fruit and roasted malts, and finishes off with a tiny bit of coffee. Great stuff.  m - Thick, full bodied, moderate carbonation. Little hot from the alochol taste but still enjoyable  d - Overall I really enjoyed Ten FIDY.

Decent head retention, a little bit of foam on top and lots around the edge of the glass.  Smells intensely roasty. Tons of chocolate malts. Slight vanilla and toffee. Some alcohol in there too.  Up front there is a big, luscious malt presence. Gives way to chocolate, toffee, graham cracker, some marshmallow, and vanilla bean flavors. Ends on a bittersweet dark roasty note, finish is espresso like with a kiss of alcohol spice.  This beer is quite thick, but not overly so. Full bodied. Medium carbonation with nice tiny bubbles. Very smooth and creamy. Gives you that warm feeling in your belly.  The alcohol is quite well hidden, and it's an all around very enjoyable stout.

2681,34483,mutterfudder,4.23,"Craft beer in a can... gotta love it! This has to be the darkest, most extreme canned beer I've ever poured. Into an imperial pint glass, with plenty of room to spare.  A - Dark and thick pour, similar to spent motor oil. Foams a lovely, rocky dark-cherry colored head. Very appealing to look at.  S - Dark and malty as expected. A mild molasses sweetness also in there. Again, very inviting and appealing.  T - Initial flavors of burnt malt and a caramelized sweetness. Molasses and brown sugar notes hidden behind the wallop of burnt malt. I really dug this flavor.  M / D - Ten FIDY sits in your mouth for a long time, coating it with its flavor. As far as drinkability, I was able to knock two down pretty quickly. For the style, it's pretty drinkable. After those two, I was feeling alright with the universe.  Ten FIDY is an excellent Imperial Stout. Perfect for a bitter cold night like the one it was consumed on.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,moz9,4.08,"This is a Russian Imperial Stout--as advertised.  Poured a 12 oz can into a stout glass. Pours a thick coffee looking consistency, pretty thick body with a nice brown head finish.  Smell is nutty with hints of chocolate and molasses. It's obviously better as it warms, and the chocolate and malty flavors show through. I think this is an excellent stout--it's a bit pricey, but there is no questioning the quality. It should be enjoyed as a nightcap, and goes well with a lot of different food choices.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,willPS21,3.73,"This one was a bit of a disappointment only because my hopes were so high, kind of like ""Dark Knight"". Poured into snifter. There was a bit more of a fruity, floral, and anise smell and taste than I want in an RIS.. not my preferred flavor profile. In this sense, I would have probably enjoyed it more if it was only 3-4oz and not 12. Also, since I tried this the same week as the Old Chub, I expected it to be superior, which it wasn't IMO. It was definitely jet black and thick as hell and seemed to coat your teeth like a malbec or other thick red wine. In some ways I almost thought it tasted more like a double IPA. The fruitiness/spiciness combined with the thickness made it seem harsher and as if it had more abv than it did. I would have guessed it was more than the Stone, but its 10% less. Overall, the balance was not what I expected from an acclaimed RIS, and I wish it leaned a bit towards the malty/metallic side of things (Rasputin), or nutty/chocolate/coffee like Stone. After I washed this one down with an Allagash White, I cracked the Stone IRS later in the evening and realized what I had been missing. It was enjoyable overall, but if they have this in the store there's a huge probability they have something I'll buy instead.  edit: I just realized that this is an imperial stout, not an RIS. Therefore, my minor complaints about floral/fruityness and more harsh/alcohol taste are, well, duh. I guess my main disappointment was due to the fact I thought this was an RIS.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

N: Dark chocolate, roasted coffee, warming alcohol, and a touch of tanned leather and vanilla. T: Lots of chocolate and coffee, vanilla notes come through nicely too with a hint of bourbon making an appearance in the alcohol heat. Develops nicely on the palate if you stick with it past the alcohol, there is a nice bitter hop finish though it is pretty subtle. M: Carbonation is a little thin, alcohol heat is very present, not terribly syrupy which I like.

No head at all; just the tiniest bit of tan bubbles around the perimeter. Very little lacing.  S - Very complex. Strangely, though, I can't pin this one down to individual flavors. It's roasty, it's sweet, but that's about as descriptive as I can be. Strange.  T - Very rich. Less bite than many imperial stouts I've had. Very tasty, but not so bitter that only a hop-head could appreciate it. Be that as it may, I suspect you'd have to be a fan of imperial stouts and/or extreme beers in general to appreciate this one. This is not for the Corona crowd.  M - What an imperial stout should be: thick. Like some others have said: motor oil.  D - This is not a session beer. Take it slow or it will knock you on your ass.

Not sure if I've ever seen a head so dark, but it does fade away to a light ring in short order. Utter blackness...no way any light is shining through this mother.  S-Sweet malts, roasted coffee, vanilla, molasses. Fudge also comes to mind. I'm also picking up some hops back there in the distance as well.  T-Big chewy bittersweet mocha hits you up front with dark fruits populating the mid palate along with smokey vanilla, a hint of bourbon and a very nice peppery hop bite on the back end wrapping all up in an astringent finish. Devine.  M-Full bodied, creamy and oily...like it should be. Slightly overcarbonated, but easily solved by boxing it back into the snifter to form a head that reminds me of dark chocolate milk.  D-Shedding a tear of sadness that the glass is half empty. Shedding tears of joy that three more are left from the four pack. Not sure they will be there much longer.  There is something so utterly decadent about an Imperial Stout in a can, but I love it. In fact, I love Oskar Blues...they seem to nail every style on the head in a robust and flavorful way.

An excellent stout, smooth coffee and cocoa flavors without the bitey aftertaste that some stouts have. It also was pretty thick/viscous.

A: Pitch black color that light wouldn't dare to penetrate with a perfect mocha colored head that left plenty of lacing.  S: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, and mocha blend into a wonderful aroma.  T: Starts with a beautfil roasted, mocha, dark chocolate flavor, well balanced and not giving too much to any. It was supported by a great hoppy bitterness which really complimented things well.

I can now safely say there is no need to be afraid, great brews can come in cans!!!!

Thick tan head, generous lacing.  Smell: Sweet. Dark fruits. Raisins & plums. Chocolate. Where's the alcohol?  Taste: Seriously, where's the alcohol? It must be hidden behind that sweet taste of roasted malts. Nice chocolate taste but the raisin dominates. I love it.  Drinkability: This is probably the first and last RIS that I will give a 5 to drinkability. The thick, creamy, chewy body's alcohol is so well hidden you'd thick you were drinking chocolate milk. This beer is absolutely amazing.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,afausser,4.32,"Appearance: Pours a near pitch black chocolate, the color of very dark coffee. Starts with about a finger and a half of bubbly head, about the color of coca cola, or perhaps molasses--and close to the same consistency as well--the head disappears within three minutes or so and all that is left is the tiniest ring of bubbles and the very small carbonation bubbles that are just barely visible moving up to the top of the glass. Sadly, unimpressive lacing. I realize this is a high ABV beer and the style isn't one with a ton of lacing....but I'd say the average RIS has slightly better than this one.  Smell: Smells very sweet. Dark chocolate and caramel are readily apparent, but there's also a hint that comes across almost as sugar syrup. Sweet and fruity with sweet raisins and apples but also a hint of berries--maybe even blueberry. A slight toasted malty note and some coffee grounds come out as well (as does a hint of anise), but predominantly is made up of the sweet malts and fruity notes. I should note that it's not slick or just syrupy--the other notes very nicely balance the sweet ones and provide some depth to the brew, but this isn't your typical coffee and smoke dominated RIS.  Taste: My first thought as it hits my tongue is how light it is. The second is ""but wow, there's still so much flavor!"" It starts with brown sugar and light sweetness, as well as some of the berry notes (though they are more hinted at than actually making themselves known in this) and finishes crisp with a coffee, smoke, and hops aftertaste (though this still comes across as somewhat light). Definite anise, especially as it warms, at which point the coffee and chocolate become more prominent in the blend. A slight hint of peppermint as it warms, quite nice.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel on this is very crisp and pops quite a bit (especially for being composed of such tiny bubbles) but is not overdone. The fine, fine, excellently done bubbles come across as much bigger than their size, get the job done, and disappear with each sip. I'm actually slightly baffled as to how this was done--it's pretty unique and works extremely well. Additionally, you really have to look for the heat, and even then it's barely there.  Drinkability: This one should be one to sip because of the ABV, but the carbonation makes you want to drink it more like a soft drink (though obviously the flavor is too heavy to drink it quite THAT quickly)...but I'm not sure I would be able to get through the whole thing that way. So I'm presented with the quandary of trying to give this one a drinkability rating....keeping in mind that it's also a 9.5% ABV...it's quite difficult. I think, though, that with the combination of all the factors at hand, the drinkability is pretty high.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BlackBearForge,4.28,"Oscar Blues Ten FIDY pours a deep deep oily black stream from the can building a dark brown head that falls fairly quickly leaving oily lacing about half of which sticks to the sides of the glass.  The aroma has strong dark chocolate, anise, deeply roasted malts and grains and a very nice fresh and grassy hop presence.  The flavor has a huge dark malt and dark chocolate body, full of black molasses, coffee and licorice with a nice bitterness that counteracts the sweet of the malts. There are also nice citrusy hop flavors, amazing in a beer with such a huge malt presence that can hide the alcohol as well as it does. Alcohol is noted however but it's taste is definitely secondary to the other flavors.  The mouthfeel is full, thick and chewy. Carbonation is low but fine enough to make it creamy.

The monochromatic can announces this beer is all business, and it pours like bitumen (see link) http://www.theviewfromthepeak.net/images/thicktar.JPG. I've only been a time or two, but the dark side of the moon is also a fair description. Combined, the can and the beautiful pour make you eager like prom night.

Malty, rich chocolate, raisin, with a hint of coffee, but not as much as others of the style. Yummy yum yum. 98 IBUs, so the hops are there, but are completely overpowered.

A: Pours jet black, almost like motor oil. It's so dark that you can barely see any carbonation bubbles, but upon a closer look you can just see them lazily floating to the top. Beautiful tan-brown head.  S: The chocolate & dark malts really come alive and tease your nostrils. Hop notes present, but more or less covered by the thick malt aroma. Love the smell.  T: Syrupy chocolate taste, yet it doesn't taste overly sweet. It's got a nice even bodied taste.  M: It's a pleasure to drink. This is really one to savor with the high alcohol notes and great stout taste. This one's perfect for the cold winter nights.  D: This is the only category I can't really give this beer a ""5"", but only because it's a tough one to drink a lot of (and find!). With the high ABV and the great stout taste, I found myself wanting to switch over to another beer after this one just to ration out the remaining beers in the pack and so I can spread out the great taste & appreciation for a longer time. If this beer was more readily available, I'd rate it higher. However, I even visited the original Oskar Blues Grill & Brew in Lyons and was somewhat dismayed that they didn't serve or sell this beer on the premises.

2681,34483,kanshiketsu,4.21,"Picked up a four-pack from the Total Wine right by my house after reading about this beer in Maxim magazine.  Poured from 12oz can into Imperial Pint glass.  A.) From the mouth of the can into the bottom of the glass, this beer looked like an oil change in my kitchen. Black, opaque, forming a dark-khaki, quarter-inch head. Then the magic happened. The gorgeous separation of liquid and foam leaving about an eighth-inch of very clingy, very dark beige head that left stubborn lacing all around the glass. Its the kind of beer you not only love to drink, but love to look at when its served.  S.) From the fridge to the glass I have to say the strongest aroma was that of alcohol with a faint odor of smoke. Once the beer was able to warm up to room temperature, these smells were challenged by malt and dark chocolate; typical of the style.  T.) Bitter, but the bite masked the alcohol well. This is where the dark chocolates and malts really stood out. No coffee flavor or hints of citrus here. Just warm, black, sludgy smoke, malt, and chocolate. Mmmmm...  M.) Velvet. Silk. Satin. The mouthfeel is slippery, but not so thick that you feel you have to chew before swallowing. This RIS is one of the first I've had that was delightful to swirl around my palate. It's mouthfeel is closer to Dogfishhead's Midas Touch than Stone's Russian Imperial Stout.  D.) Not as drinkable as its lower-octane cousins like Guiness Porter or Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout, but far and away the most drinkable high-octane RIS I've found to-date.

A very thin head forms, that dissipates quickly, with almost no lacing. The lack of head may be due to parcel shipping.  Nose: A malty sweet chocolaty aroma, coupled with toasty bread.  Tongue: Similar to the smell with less chocolate overtones. Roasted malt and chocolate flavors dominate, certainly very sweet, while maintaining a good balanced. Notes of dry raisin, vanilla, and plum.  Mouth: Extremely flavorful, but quite smooth and palatable. Much lees thick that expected from an Imperial Stout. It drinks easy and has a short-lived aftertaste.  Libation: Very, very nice. The smell was quite impressive but concerned me because I didn't want it to taste exactly like the smell. Fortunately I wasn't disappointed after the first sip. A very robust and complex stout, this is unexpectedly smooth and drinkable given the high ABV.

Poured with about a two finger cocoa colored head that resided in to a spotty cap and leaves a lot of beautiful lacing on the glass. Very pretty stout.  Nose - Very rich nose with roasted malts and dark chocolate. There is a touch of alcohol in there as well which is nice. I usually am not a huge fan of alcohol in the nose of beers as I think it tends to overpower the other aromas but this one is nicely balanced with everything.  Taste - Lots of chocolate in the taste. And by lots I mean LOTS. The chocolate flavor you get upfront fades in to a bitter roasted malt flavor and finishes with a combination of the two. The finish is sort of like a dark chocolate covered coffee bean. Very clean and well rounded taste.  Mouthfeel - Thicker body which is nice, especially with it cooling off again outside. The carbonation is perfect and exactly what I expect from a RIS and the beer has a long, but clean, finish.  Overall - Really good, top class, Russian Imperial Stout.

But I have rated each category honestly, so I won't change the ratings to be a solid A+ like I would say this beer is.  The appearance is jet black with a big, dark brown head. There are no highlights. This beer is impenetrable. The way the foam sticks to the glass when tilted is bewildering.  Upon first smell I was not impressed. I kept trying to pull something from the nose to put on paper without an iota. While it has warmed the beer has come alive. Now I smell roasted dark chocolate espresso, malt, caramel toffee and cocoa nibs.  The taste is big and bold. Deep robust flavors of the nose that assault the palate. Goddamn I love this beer.  The mouthfeel is second to none. It is thick and chewy. It layers my mouth with its celestial glory. Since having this beer I have realized no other stout I have had could have a perfect 5 mouthfeel. I am ruined.  This beer is not made to be ""drinkable"". I am wrapping up my first and only beer now and I don't want another one tonight.

The edges of the liquid are a mahogany brown when held up to light.  Smell: Nutty and smokey.  Taste: Small Guinness-esque flavor up front, then big toasted complexity. Deep smokey and nutty malt character. Even ice cold the taste is complex and satisfying (I had this at a restaurant and couldn't wait for it to warm up before giving it a try). As it warms, some mild hops come out, and the malt stays big and roasted.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy, with a nice carbonation hit at the end. Pleasantly subdued alcohol burn that builds in the chest.  Drinkability: Well-masked ABV and solid flavor. Will happily get again.  I had this at Plan B in Glastonbury, CT, paired with a moderately spicy and creamy veggie burger. The garlic mayo and beans in the patty made the veggie burger predominantly creamy, so the warming alcohol and roasted, occasionally hoppy bite of the Ten Fidy provided a perfect accompaniment.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Dark, dark, dark and impossible to see through. Not very much of a head at all, colored a dark brown that dissipates into nothing very quickly. Not too much lacing at all. Smell has a big malt character right up front, with some raisins and chocolate backing that up, as well as a subtle wafting of alcohol.  Big malty bite off the bat that carries a hint of sweetness, followed by tingling bitterness from the mixture of hops, dark chocolate and coffee, with just a tinge of raisin and anise. Finish is crisp, with a pleasantly bitter aftertaste that lingers. The 9.5% ABV is masked fairly well, but there's just a little kick towards the end that serves as a reminder of the oomph that this brew packs. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I expected, but still quite substantial. A nice well-balanced body with not too much carbonation that rounds off briskly.  Drinkability is rather good given the tasty character and the well-hidden alcohol content. I would definitely have another one, but the prohibitive $5 a can price keeps me from having another, which is probably a good thing.

Taste - Lots of roasted malt and chocolate. A less noticeable flavor of coffee grounds. Some alcohol. Mouthfeel - Rich, full body with light carbonation and fine bubbles.

Nose- Lots of chocolate and roast malt. Coffee flavors and pine hops add to what smells like its going to be a big beer.  Palate- Slightly softer than the nose. More chocolate than roast. Starts off sweet and chocolatey, but ends bitter with a combination of roastiness, coffee and hops that play together nicely.  Mouthfeel- Full bodied, medium-low creamy carbonation.

Ten FIDY looks, tastes, and feels like a great RIS. at nearly five bucks a can, it had better kick ass!  pours a beautiful thick black like motor oil, slick and heavy in texture. it's covered by a tiny dark brown head that disappates quickly, even for the style. smells heavy with malt, syrupy and sweet.  tastes are initially heavy with dark chocolate and raisins. when it warms up, complex flavors like very sweet and heavy deep chocolate stands out the most, with some roast and coffee behind. booze peeks out a bit as well.  mouthfeel thick and full, almost syrupy. this was a good beer and enjoyable. everything you would want and expect from an imperial stout. it's great in every way- but not worth five bucks a can. i'd rather get a bomber of something just as good for that price.  that being said, i'll still buy this again, even at 5 bucks a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,marvin213,3.03,"Pouring this out of an aluminum can is like adding a quart directly into the engine block: black, viscous, and almost menacing-looking. It's a bit more beer-like when a hint of fizz climactically escapes the top. Oddly, the fizz quickly fizzles; the small, Sprite-like bubbles diminsh back into black. This beer is solid black.  I detect some aluminum in the smell--not like a contaminant, but the near inevitable residuals you get from those containers. There's also anise, as is characteristic of most Russian Imperials. Other than that, there's nothing. It's like liquid anise within a watery black nothingness. It chugged out of the can like thick broth, but its smell is simple and thin.  It tastes eerily like it smells. The anise adds a licoriceness to an aqueous solution containing aluminum. It's simple--and not bad--but simple--and underwhelming. The feel is thin and watery, and the metal has absolutely impacted the taste. I've had some Surlys about which I didn't feel this way, but the taste and feel is just beyond Guiness. I actually wonder what this'd be like from a nitro-can. Though it tastes better and stronger than a Guiness, it's status is similar: a genuine stout that meets but fails to exceed expectations. The feel, particularly for the style, is lacking because it's so aqueous. Sometimes I've wondered about the ""chewy"" designation on mouthfeels; this one, clearly, is far from chewy.  Drinkability is that most subjective notion where we consider things like experience and price. At $14.49/4-pack, my lasting thought involves this costing more than FBS. As the template for stouts the Ten Fidy fails to compare. Though this beverage is far thinner, I'd easily and enjoyably down two FBS before I'd consider reaching for this. With no prior attention to the malt liquor-like marketing (""Ten Fidy--Half-Baked. Fully Roasted.""), perhaps my expectations were falsely elevated. In fact, the more I ponder it, the more the marketing strikes me as apt: this is like the malt liquor of Russian Imperial Stouts.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TKEbeerman,4.53,"Poured right from the can into my snifter.  A: I've had dark stouts before, but Ten FIDY might take the cake for the darkest stout I've poured to date. I live in Florida, the sunshine state, and I can tell you right now I'm holding this brew up the sun, and not even the sun's powerful rays of light can penetrate Ten FIDY. The head on this beer is something to be admired. It reminds me of a fluffy cap of dark chocolate whipped icing on a tasty birthday cake.  S: With certain beers, you can expect what you might find in the nose. I've begun to realize that it is the strength and the distinguishing characteristics between aromas that make a beer special. Ten FIDY falls into this special category. I've said before, you know a beer is gonna be go when you crack it open and your mouth waters from a distance. Roasted, toasty mault dominates the smell. Notes of chocolate and an alcohol tingle is also present.  T: Tons and tons of deep dark roasted malt and bitter sweet chocolate with notes of roasted coffee beans. The hops in the beer tingle your tongue as you slowly sip it down. My mouth waters after every sip of this brew, it's like I just can't get enough.  M: Silky smooth, light carbonation, a perfect combo for a beer like this. This beer just rests on your tongue, letting you take in all its glory.  D: This beer is DANGEROUS. You will find yourself cracking open another can after this, and then you will find yourself trying to hold yourself back from cracking open another. After failing to do so, you will find yourself falling into a deep sleep filled with dreams of Ten FIDY and a fluffy chocolate, roasted malted, beer land.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,clayrock81,3.8,"Pours a thick black body with a one finger tan head with lace patches on top of a roasted malt aroma with hints of coffee. A smooth, creamy not too harsh beer that doesn't have a really dry quality but is more laid back and smooth. Hints of coffee and chocolate underlying a mild roasted malt finish and a touch of dark fruit lead to an easy to drink RIS with a well-hidden ABV and crisp finish. I like my RIS a little stronger but for availability and price (and I can't believe it is canned) this is a must try.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,rapidsequence,4.65,"A can. A 12 oz can.  Appearance: It pours thick like motor oil-- the can adds to that image. Completely opaque. The head is one of the darkest brown heads I've seen. It never completely disappears, but fades to a rim and some floating spots-- even after an hour. Spotty lacing runs down the glass and looks great, but doesnt stick.  Smell: Roasted coffee and sweet and bitter chocolate. Its mostly sweet and less bitter. Some fruitiness to it also. Roasty. Very, very chocolatey.  Taste: I'm surprised at the hop bitterness after not smelling hops. It works though. Rich bitter chocolate flavor and bready malt flavor. This is huge and it lingers. Delicious. Finishes slightly bitter, then sweet.  Mouthfeel: So thick and viscous. Oily and coating. Carbonation doesnt interfere.  Drinkability: Its a fantastic RIS. Convenient, affordable single serving size is a plus.  Another can from 11-11-10, poured on 11-29-11. Excellent. None of the bitterness noted above except for roastiness. Rich bittersweet chocolate. Bready, heavy, sticky.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Pours a motor old black into the glass.... almost no head and no sense of carbonation. The beer just feels kind of ""dead"" as it sits in the glass, which, while purely aesthetic, still bugs me.  Smell is of obvious coffee/chocolate and very pleasant, though not overpowering. Alcohol pretty hidden.  Drinks with a relatively creamy mouthfeel and sense of smoothness. Taste goes pretty hand and hand with the smell, mostly chocolate and coffee, very minimal sense of alcohol or hops.  For a RIS, very drinkable, pleasant. Doesn't strike me as particularly complex, but it gives you more or less what you'd expect from a RIS.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,hansendc,3.48,"Pours a deep motor oil black. Almost no discernable head. I tried to drink it out of the can at first. I figure that it's in a can for a reason: if you could take a bottle or a pint glass to where you would be drinking it, you would. Perhaps I'll keep a can or two around to drink at the top of a mountain or for backpacking.  This isn't one of those aromatic beers. I would assume that there was little dry-hopping done, if any. Actually, there is a very small amount of hops at all. At first I thought it was because of drinking it out of the can but, even after pouring into a pint glass, there is very little aroma.  It has a pretty thick mouthfeel. Could use some improvement, but not bad.  The taste is simple. Nothing offensive at all, but nothing special. I bet the barrel-aged versions add some complexity. Definitely try those if you have them available.

2681,34483,Rizow,4.05,"Great Scott, stacks and stacks of cases of Ten Fidy, just sitting out in the open, at display in front of the Lake Merritt Whole Food's beer section? Just sitting out there, like we're not supposed to notice this shocking and sudden surfacing of one of the legendary BA stouts?!  What can one say, but - Crazy Unexpected Beer, Get Out Of My Dreams And Into My Car!  And drive away we surely did. Can't wait to get you home and crack that top...  Well, it's dark. Very dark. Black, as one would expect. It leaves pleasing lacing patterns on the glass, I'll give it that. It smells as it should, as one would expect of a heavy, contemporary craft stout - there's chocolate, coffee, sweet syrups, some may find anise or licorice. And the taste ineluctably follows this same pattern, the only question being which of these flavors will be featured. Here, it's big burnt, bitter and roasted layers that dominate.  Mouthfeel is a definite strength. Ten Fidy's slick velvet feel leans more toward the motor oil feel of Bourbon County Stout than most other stouts, which earns it good points from me.  Drinkability, to me, must be reasoned as more than simply just ""Can You Drink A Shitload"" of a given beer, which is an approach I find far too simplistic, necessarily slanted toward lightweight beers, and unfairly prejudiced against heavyweights. Drinkability should be a complete measure of the experience, and not a mere reflection of volume. In this case...yeah, drinkability's fine.  If ""Reputation"" were a category, Ten Fidy would surely rate a 4.5 or 5.0, and the hype is not unjustified. This is a supremely good beer. For me, though, it sits a notch or two behind the likes of Bourbon County, The Abyss, Speedway, but remains a definite winner, by any means.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,PittBeerGirl,4.47,"Finally reviewing this brew from a can sent from TX by whoneeds8. Thanks! Have had this multiple times on tap and 1-2 times in a can-but never formally reviewed.  A-Body is an opaque definitely black hue...even when held up to the light. An aggressive pour ends with a slowly emerging 1 finger deep brown mocha colored head which fades slowly into a thin collar. Small traces of lacing are left behind in the glass.  S-Nose is distinct of RIS style. Dark is prevalent with big accents on dark chocolate, anise, and fig. A very mild almost hidden touch of phenols is present.  T-Upfront is a rich dark chocolate flavor as well as a hint of molasses with a big roasted malt backbone. A touch of anise also comes through. The anise and dark chocolate flavors as well as hint of liquor come through the most for the finish. What lingers is a big roasted malt flavor as well as smooth and subtle hints of the other flavors mentioned and a very mild alcohol warmth.  M-Awesome. Low to medium tingly carbonation and a thick but velvety smooth body with the slightest presence of alcohol consistency.  D- This is, so far to me, one of the great RIS's. The character matches the style to a tee. The alcohol is mildly present but never obnoxious and it had that dark complexity that I sometimes can't get my head around with a wonderful balance. This beer, to me is on par with the most hyped,well known, and infamous stouts- but this is readily available and a must-try for the style.

Trying some aged 10W50 tonight...hopefully my tolerance will allow me this 2-year old can plus the 1-year old can in the same night for some comparisons.  Pours thick black with a very small DARK brown head, one of the darkest heads I've seen, shame it was so small and short-lived. Reduces to a small ring and very faint wispy island, leaves just a few temporary spots of lacing.  Aroma is rich black coffee...lots of coffee, some dark chocolate and roasted malt, a little bit of anise and dark fruits round things out. Flavor is roasted malt, anise, cherries/dark fruit, some coffee & chocolate, very low alcohol presence. Good, but not the best tasting Ten FIDY I've had.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied for an IS, low carbonation, sticky.  Well, the muted alcohol was nice, however this seems to have lost some of the characteristics I've enjoyed in this beer in the past. Definitely curious to see what the 1-year old can has in store.  Aroma 4, Appearance 3.5, Taste 4, Palate 3.5, Drinkabilty 4  ---  12oz canned Sept 25, 2009, enjoyed August 21, 2010.  Pours thick black with a small, fizzy, and quickly dissipating dark brown head, reduces to a small ring and doesn't leave much lacing. Even more flat looking than the '08.  Aroma is of moderate strength and features some coffee, chocolate and roasted malts, dark fruits, mustiness and alcohol, quieter than other versions I've had.  Flavor is some strong coffee, somewhat burnt, roasted malts, a bit of chocolate, some dark fruits and a touch of sourness, also only of moderate strength. Alcohol makes more and more of a presence as it warms and starts to become fairly distracting.  Mouthfeel is thick compared to all beers, but medium bodied for the style, low to medium carbonation, oily and a bit sticky.  Good, but easily my least favorite can of this I've had. While never reviewed, the 2007 batch ranks in my memory as the best one yet.  Aroma 3.5, Appearance 3.5, Taste 3.5, Palate 3.5, Drinkability 3.5  ---  Jul 3, 2009  12oz. can. Pours black, literally like used motor oil. Blackest, thickest substance I've ever seen come out of an aluminum can. Small dark brown head. Some lacing, but very temporary, doesn't stick to the glass.  Aroma is dark roasted malts, cofee, and some chocolate.  Flavor is heavy on the chocolate with some coffee, roasted malts, and a bit of the hops rearin' their head, and is also long-lasting. This year's is less chocolaty than the previous years.  Low carbonation, thick and rich.  A top-notch imperial stout. I've bought a number of 4-packs over the past year and will definitely buy more.

There is a faint chocolate coffee taste to this; however, I would prefer both to be pronounced a bit more...

The smell is a little chocolate syrup flavor. It has a pretty strong caramel flavor with a bit of a peppery flavor.  The taste is is dark chocolate with creamy notes. Some hints of licorice with some espresso flavor and toffee.  The feel is medium bodied that is pretty surprising for an Imperial stout but it is the first that I have had a can.

2681,34483,laituegonflable,4.23,"Pours a dark colour, almost pitch-black. Slight hint of brown up to direct light. Head is not beige, or ochre, but brown. Bronzey sort of brown. Very dense, bubbles pop here and there but it's sticking around, about an inch thick. Leaves some nice spidery trails of lace. Very nice.  Nose, look, has huge darkness in there, but somehow doesn't reach the depths of the abyss. A large amount of dark chocolate, but yeah, mostly spice, huge peppery sensation and a lot of liqueur notes. But wow, smelling deeply makes my eyes water. It smells strong, more than anything, like a good cognac. But very pleasant.  Taste is surprisingly palatable. Strong, yes, but starts like dark chocolate and has notes of raisin in there and some blood plum, then gets very alcoholic towards the end, spicy and phenolic with black pepper notes and a lot of vinous flavours, oak and burgundy, some rum, yeah. Definite noticeable alcohol, but it comes through full of flavour, it's all roasty and alcoholic at the same time. Really, really good flavour. This is the sort of beer I adore. Strong like a cock, but flavoursome as a minge. I tasted this blind, was stunned to find out this came from a can.  Thick feel, makes your mouth very sensitive though, with its harsh alcohol.

2681,34483,lacqueredmouse,4.35,"Bought from Whole Foods Market in Chelsea, New York. Carried back with loving care to Australia and shared with my bro @laituegonflable.  Dark opaque black colour, with just the hint of brown at the edge. Head is a creamy and delicious smear of chocolate coloured foam across the top. Quite turgid and frothy, with amazing lace. Looks extremely dark and exceptionally full bodied. The tiny bubbling in the head is exceptional - it's bordering on creamy without the gimmick of pure creamy-headed stout. Really awesome.  Deep, dark and boozy notes of fresh licorice, charred grain, leather and (almost) smoked fish. It's incredibly smooth and complex, with so many dimensions cavorting around. But despite this, it seems so well integrated, as though I'm viewing it from far away, and the radically different elements are all part of one succinct and coherent whole. Quite remarkable.  Smooth and creamy on the palate, and certainly not as intense as it could have been. Roasted notes of high-cocoa chocolate, vienna-roast coffee and smooth bourbon vanilla make it rich, but approachable. Finish is full and rather sweet, despite the carbonised coffee bean rawness; and the smoky tessitura just accentuates the otherwise full-bodied rounded character that makes up its bulk. Mouthfeel is smooth, but slightly more tingling from the alcohol than expected.  A very robust and complex but enjoyable impy stout. It packs a punch, but is unexpectedly drinkable given the ABV and the style. This is a really good and extremely layered beer - extremely worthy of appreciation.  (Without a doubt, the best beer I've yet had from a can).",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Picked up those mentioned above in the taste with some hops deep in the background. Nice balance.  Thick, almost syrup like mouthfeel.  Drank one and I thought it was impossible to handle another.

2681,34483,jwillcourt,4.4,"Poured from a 65 degree can born on 10/27/09 into a snifter.  A - Deep brown/black with the slightest ruby halo around the rim. Head is remarkable chocolate milk color, one inch that fades in five minutes. No lacing, but when swirled, there is a ruby sheen on the glass. It really does look like motor oil (maybe iced espresso) during the pour, and I think the can adds to it.  S - Once warm, it smells just like warm Christmas pudding. Specifically, brandy-soaked raisins, currants, and toffee cake.  T - So many flavors over the course of the tasting, but never out of balance. Strong licorice at first, but that goes as it warms. Bittersweet chocolate, coffee, burned malt and burned sugar. Later, dried fruit, particularly raisins, and fig. Alcohol is warming but feels less than 9.5%. Slight hops.  M - Thick, heavy-bodied with light carbonation. Feels syrupy on the lips (just like how it coats the glass when swirled). Slight alcohol burn impacts mouth feel more than taste.  D - This is extremely delicious but due to the high gravity and alcohol it is a sipping beer. One can usually lasts an hour, and it's enough for the night.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,nrbw23,4.42,"My first Imperial Stout from a can.  A- Pours a thick black with a dark tan colored head. Fairly light on the lacing.  S- Dark fruits, alcohol burn, sweet malts, molasses, burnt carmel, coffee beans, and some chocolate. Lots of dark fruity sweetness up front with the malts followed by the bitter chocolate notes on the end.  T- The alcohol in the nose has almost vanished in the taste. Caramel, coffee, and burnt malts shine through. More bitter than sweet and very awesome.  M - Full bodied, low carbonation, creamy and rich,  D- Very solid brew and its pretty cool that it comes from a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Leaves a maze of lace like a side-view of an ant farm. Thick foamy miasma retention. Great first impression.  Smells like awesome. Sugary dark malt, toffee, vanilla, dark espresso.  Alcoholic warmth, dark fruit (black currants, cassis), burnt caramel and roast malt are like four good friends guiding you on a tour of awesome town. Licorice and toffee support.

A: Pours thick and black, like used motor oil. It has a thin brown head which faded quickly with only slight lacing.  S: Lots of roasted and toasted malts here. Great dark chocolate aromas and roasted espresso. Some dark fruit, raisins, etc. This beer actually smells sweet from the chocolate and fruit notes.  T: More toasted malts, with a lot of sweetness of raisin or currant. Nice bitterness of dark chocolate and coffee. For 9.5% ABV, there is absolutely no hint of it in here. Pretty much no hop presence detectable here as has been noted in the fresh beer; this is to be expected for a year into aging.  M: Nice carbonation present, with a very heavy body from the sweetness and the bitterness of the malts. The aftertaste is rather dry and somewhat bitter, like a hot cocoa made from rich, very dark chocolate.  D: It tastes great and has no hint of alcohol, as noted above. However, the heavy body dissuades me from drinking too much of this one.  This beer has very mellow flavors after one year. It is nicely balanced between the sweetness and bitterness of the malts. I would be interested to try a fresh one to see what it is like with more hop presence. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I can get this beer at stores near me, as I bought these year-old cans at a store while visiting family for the holidays. I do have a couple more to age for another year or so, it will be interested to see how much more mellow this can be by then.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Smelled very roasty, definite coffee presence. A bit of dark chocolate and mocha notes hiding in the also.  Taste and Mouthfeel:Tasted of sweet slick chocolate and scorched dark fruit. Definitely alot more earthy hop bitterness than expected. Almost to the point where it noticeably hid flavor. The mouthfeel on the otherhand was as good as it gets. Bounces between heavy roast and bitterness to thick creamy sweetness. Finishes nicely with a nitter-sweet licorice like flavor sticking aroud.  Drinkability:I've been really wanting to try this brew a while this definitely appeared in the glass as labeled. Looked like thick motor oil. This was a very enjoyable brew just a bit spendy.

2681,34483,JalfPsu,4.22,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a pint glass.  Wow. I've never seen anything this dark come out of a can. I don't think I was quite prepared for it. It pours nearly jet black, with about a quarter inch of dark brown head that dissipates quickly, leaving minimal lacing.  The smell isn't nearly as impressive as the appearance. It's pleasant enough, with notes of caramel, molasses, and coffee, but the aroma is quite mild, and perhaps a little too subdued. It doesn't provide too much of a strong impression up front.  The taste, on the other hand, doesn't hold back. The initial tastes are rich caramel and molasses, with intense coffee following close behind. There's some chocolate mixed in there, along with a mild cherry taste, but they don't overwhelm. The aftertaste is primarily coffee and molasses, with the coffee flavors lingering for quite a while. Overall, it's quite a well balanced RIS, with all of the flavors complimenting one another very nicely.  The body is lighter than some similar Russian Imperial Stouts, but it's by no means thin. There's very little carbonation here, and it definitely coats the tongue, though without being excessively syrupy. Honestly, the body of this beer is as close to perfect for the style as I've experienced; it's not overwhelmingly heavy, but there's still plenty there to enjoy.  This beer is also impressively drinkable. It hides its alcohol quite well, and the flavors are well balanced, and don't get old. It's also not oppressively sweet, which I feel can hinder the drinkability of comparable such stouts.  On the whole, this is an excellent brew, and goes a long way toward showing that canned beer should not be looked down upon.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,greenpumas,4.42,"A: Black as oil topped with a mocha colored head. The lace has little retention, and makes its way down the glass with each sip.  S: Burnt toffee, mocha, caramel, malt, a little yeast note, and, as with most RIS, a lingering alcohol aroma that becomes more present as the beer warms.  T: Out of this world. Coffee is present on the front of the palate, which then expands, bringing out the mocha and sweet raisin flavor, easing one into the warming alcohol.  MF/D: A little bit thin for a RIS, I still give this beer a 5 on the MF aspect because it really is one of the smoothest, most well rounded stouts I have had the pleasure of enjoying.

2681,34483,kzoobrew,4.52,"Black viscous body shimmers like oil in the snifter. Deep cocoa brown head perched atop. Stands just over one finger tall and is quite creamy. Retention is decent though the lacing left behind is impressive. Full curtain of thick lacing encircles the glass.  Rich fudgy chocolate and roasted malt aromas are pleasantly strong. Complimentary java smell settles underneath. Herbal, maybe piny hop presence flutters in and out, with the much more rich and deep flavors a firm foothold would be hard to come by. A touch of molasses rounds out the back end. Though not the most complex of aroma, certainly one of the most enjoyable.  Decadent chocolate fudge carries over heavily from the nose planting itself smack dab in the middle of the tongue. Deep roasted malt delivers a subtle char flavor. Dark roasted and full bodied black coffee flavor sits on the back of the palate, the java flavor is not hidden but surely overwhelmed. Substantial hoppy bitterness is present. The bitterness plays off the roasted characteristics strengthening the bittersweet chocolate and coffee notes. Dark Cherry and plum flavors are rather inconspicuous in comparison but blend well into the flavor as a whole. The slightest bit of heat is noticed, this is in no way off putting but rather a welcome addition to a beer of this style.  The mouthfeel is the high point of this brew. As far as I am concerned there is no room for improvement. Rich thick and luxurious body. Texture is beyond creamy. Carbonation settles in on the lower end of the spectrum but perfectly matches the characteristics of this beer.  The only gripe I have regarding Ten Fidy is its availability is my area. It is rather hard to be drinkable when the beer is not easily attainable. Though when generous traders provide such a treat it is always a pleasure. Ten Fidy joins the crowded top tier of beers in my favorite style. Excellent across the board. Highly recommended to any appreciator of fine beer.  Huge thanks to SpdKilz, Carleton is the man.

""average"" for an ris in my experience is exceptional for beer in general. this is definitely below that average.  mouthfeel is smooth and moderately thick, great.  the rotten fruit is really bugging me. i dont remember it from previous tastings, so ill take that into account. but its odd that it comes when im first taking notes on it. this was the second disappointment in a row after founders breakfast stout came through with charry, ashy, and bitter characteristics that i didnt recall from past experiences. if i find on future tastings that these characteristics were specific to the can i shared last night, ill alter my scores. but this one was a strange disappointment.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A - Pours pitch black with motor oil qualities and a mocha colored head, about a finger width thick to start off. The head dissipates after about a minute to leave a nice ring on top. There is some lacing left on the glass.  S - I get a lot of roasty malts, and some dark chocolate. It's balanced nicely with some dark fruits. Not the most complex stout ever, but still good.  T - Dark chocolate is the predominant taste with molasses and just a touch of toffee, with a little bit of dark fruit notes at the end. Roasted malts are present throughout the entire taste. It's a bit boozy at the end as well.  M - Heavy with light carbonation. it's creamy, and chewy, and good. This is pretty much how a stout should be.  D - It's a pretty well hidden 10.5%.

As the bubble-crown recedes into a pitted spongiform mass, sticky brown freckles and drippy rings of lacing hash-mark the insides of my Duvel tulip glass.  The aroma is laden with smoky black char, accented with toffee, vanilla, and a blast of baker's chocolate.  The taste is darkly rich and roasty, with sweet vanilla caramels and a sprinkle of crushed toffee accenting a charred barley backbone. Notes of molasses and mildly-bittering smoky black barley are accompanied by a twist of citrus peel oil and a sprinkle of dusty cocoa that help provide depth and drying balance. Espresso-roast and still-darker coffee notes pervade the brew throughout the encounter, and any alcohol flavors are sedately vanilla-like in character and otherwise very well-suppressed.  The drink is luxuriously full-bodied with just enough carbonation to keep any sugary stickiness to a minimum. Highly drinkable even considering the burly ABV. Russian Imperial Stout in a can?

There's also lots of dark malt bitterness as well. Caramel and fruity, banana esters from the yeast also show their presence. The alcohol provides complimentary warmth and always belies its 10% strength. The mouthfeel is super full-bodied, mouthcoating. The finish is hoppy, roasty and bitter for a long while.

Mouthfeel is heavily bodied and smooth and creamy with perfect carbonation - it's like velvet across your tongue. Drinkability is typical for the style - tasty, but heavy.

The chocolaty, coffee nose is a nice compliment to the look.  As one would expect from such a thick stout the mouth frrl is very full and the chocolate lingers through the finish.

As for appearance, it's everything you might expect from an amazing RIS: the head is a 3/4 inch tan billowing cloud of deliciousness. It laces beautifully. I'm not gonna lie here, I'm somewhat partial to the style. I get the feeling that a lot of us BA's are. We appreciate good beer, yes, but a whole lot of RIS's tend to fall into that category without doing much to distinguish themselves from the rest. Perhaps the can here is a gimmick...used to get the beer some attention. Fact of the matter is, that attention is totally deserved.  I think one way that RIS's can be properly distinguished is through the mouthfeel. It's a quick impression and a lot of the russians seem to falter here- too creamy, too light, etc etc etc. Ten FIDY has a relatively subdued mouthfeel but it's creamy, still. The balance is great, and makes for a very smooth drink.  Taste and smell are a bit heavy on the molasses and contain notes of dark chocolate with a hint of spice as well as some roasted coffee.  All in all, I'd say go for it. This is a great brew and one that I will no doubt be returning to. Cheers.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The body was murky and very dark, basically black. The Ten FIDY is one beautiful brew.  S: Very heavy malts as you would expect but not in an offensive way. Chocolate (cocoa powder, really), coffee & oats, all in their roasted glory. The malts are predominant but a balancing effort is put forth by a nice, healthy dose of hops. Grassy, piney & resiny. All fantastic. Definite yeast character, doughy, and I swear I got some cheesy yeast notes too.  T: In addition to the aromas, some raisin and maple syrup come through on the palate. Longggg lasting finish, slightly sweet and moderately bitter. Heavenly.  M: Full & creamy. At 10% ABV, you can't blame a little bit of warmth from the alcohol. Fizzy carbonation and slightly chalky at the end.  D: Basically perfect. Lost a point here simply because it's a heavy hitter and if you haven't stopped after 3 or 4, you probably should.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,garbercury,4.5,"World class Imperial in a can??? Yep, no doubt about it..  A--Pretty normal for the style, very little head, very dark with a red hue. Some lacing.  S--Solid. Oats, Chocolate, Coffee, hints of vanilla also.  T--Wow, this is one tasty beer. Really did not expect it to taste THIS good. Flavor was not over the top but had tons of character. Chocolate and coffee dominate but not so much that it might take over the brew. This is one of the better tasting beers I have ever drank.  M--mellow and silky smooth.  D--I hate to say this, but as high as the ABV's are, I would gladly work on a few of these on a cold winter night. One of the best beers I have had in a while and a terrific version of a RIS. Highly recommended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Bulkman,4.35,"Obtained this through a trade with Paul (Lunch)...thanks Paul!  Appearance: Very thick & completely black, looks like used motor oil. Minimal head, but what is there is dark brown & quickly dissipates. The small amount left around the mouth of the can dried by the time I finished my glass & looked like tar.  Smell: Heavy, rich aroma of dark chocolate, molasses & mild coffee. I detect some fig as well.  Taste: Again the dark chocolate & molasses kick in, with a lingering bitterness & mild alcohol flavor, which notches up as it warms. I speculate that this brew is best served warm, but it was so good I couldn't let it sit long enough to get completely warm.  Mouthfeel: Heavy & thick, coats your tongue with a mild, warming alcohol presence, especially as it warms. Almost like a liqueur.  Drinkability: The alcohol is hidden pretty well, resulting in a very drinkable brew. Could easily have a couple of these over a few hours.  I'm pretty impressed with this brew. I'd put it in my top 3 RIS, behind only Old Rasputin & Darkness. (Yes, in that order)",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bonk0076,4.35,"Pours a jet black color out of the can with a bold, creamy brown head. Aroma is of coffee, oatmeal, chocolate and molasses.

2681,34483,Wisconsinality,4.4,"Poured from a 12 oz can. Canned 10-31-09  A- Pours a jet black with a very small head. The head is a nice mocha brown that disappears almost immediately but leaves some nice lacing. Motor oil is the best way you can describe it.  S- A strong scent of dark chocolate and some roasted coffee. There is also a hint of vanilla to go along with a little bit of malty-ness. The smell definitely opens up when you let it warm up some.  T- A bold taste of dark chocolate to go along with a roasted almost burnt malt taste. Maybe some black licorice in there, and the alcohol just peaking through at the end. Again the complexity of this beer opens up when it warms up some.  M- A very smooth and silky beer. The beer has some warmth to it from the amount of alcohol in it. Also there is a small amount of bitterness on the tip of the tongue from the roasted malts taste.  D- For being as high as the ABV is, it goes down really smooth. You get a little bit of warmth from it which makes it a great beer to enjoy on a cold night.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,tattooedtolley,4,"Informal. Nice, nice impy stout in a can. Can beers no longer scare me, its becoming more and more common place and this proves it once and for all, you can, can anything, Big roasted malt flavor, big in body, weighs in at 9.5abv. Delicious. Recommended.  The can seems like a novelty at first but I'd pass over quite a few stouts in a bottle for this one, the best of the Oskar Blues in my humble opinion.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,billab914,4.37,"Poured from a can into my Stone RIS glass. Pours a thick and black with a small tan head. Head retention is low and not much lacing on the glass.  Very bold aroma of chocolate, coffee and roasted smokey grains. There is also a little sweet slightly fruity flavor to it.  Taste is also big on the bitter chocolate with some coffee and roasted grains. Bitter finish with some sweetness up front.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick with moderate to light carbonation.  Drinkability is good for a Imperial Stout that is almost 10%. It comes in a very drinkable quantity of 12oz as well instead of 22.  I have purchased a 4 pack of this several times now and always enjoy each can. My friends are always impressed that something like this can come out of a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Natural510,3.98,"12oz aluminum, canned 12-22-08.  Consistency of crude oil bubbling fresh from the ground; the color is beyond pitch black. A centimeter of brown head is created, which dissipates to a thin but solid ring of lace on the upper lip of the chalice. Loads of chocolate to the nose, with a slight roasted malt edge. Flavor is very sweet; rich milk chocolate, candied sugar and espresso dominate the flavor. Very similar to a chocolate candy bar. Malt provides a hint of cola to the flavor as well. Heavy in body and soul, as evidenced by the pour. Ever-so-lightly bitter in the end, with a nice little hop buzz at the finish. Drinkability suffers a bit from the cloying sweetness. If that element had been toned down, it would make for a much nicer RIS. Still worth picking up, but I'm tempted to age the other cans further to see if it will mellow.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Lunch,4.8,"Served on-tap at Frisco Grille in Columbia, Maryland (12/08/09) into a goblet at the appropriate temperature.  A: Pours a motor oil black with a slight cap of an espresso colored head that fades quickly leaving decent lacing on the inside of the glass.  S: Wonderful bouquet of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, cocoa, prunes, toffee, and a slight alcohol perfume. As the beer continues to warm a rich graham cracker scent builds. The graham cracker scent is slightly more apparent in the draft version as compared to the can adding to its appeal ever so slightly.  T: Very rich with roasted malt, chocolate, molasses, graham cracker, cocoa, toffee, and prune. Alcohol is present in a wonderful warming sense that is never obtrusive and seems to add to the complexity. A decadent beverage with rich flavors that allow the palate to endure quite a workout without being overwhelming. I found the flavors in the on-tap version to flourish just that much more pushing my rating up .5 to a perfect 5 from the can version. Truly perfection (in mind at least).  M: Full-bodied and oily with a syrupy but slick mouthfeel with a low-moderate carbonation.  D: Even though there is a hint of alcohol in both scent and palate, the effect itself seems negligible and allows this rich and complex beer to be very drinkable especially considering its 10% abv.  Overall I find this to beer on-tap to just slightly edge its canned brother and it has certainly become a favorite and staple in my fridge for years to come. The complex full flavors with great drinkability give many of its bottled brethren a run for their money. If you see this on-tap it is a must. Highly recommended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Arbitrator,2.43,"Lightly chilled can into a glass. 2009 vintage. Purchased on sale at $10.50 a four-pack -- appropriate price. But with the price increases and my changing palate, it's almost certainly the last time I'm buying this beer.  A: Pitch black, completely opaque when held to the light. Reminds me exactly of used motor oil. A mildly vigorous pour produces several inches of fluffy, chocolate-colored head. It recedes very slowly into a halo and broken film on the top of the brew, with little lacing down the glass. Very captivating for a 10%er.  S: Dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and vinous dark fruit, like raisins. The fruit is restrained, so it doesn't add a tartness to the aroma.  T: Follows the nose, but brings out some flavors I couldn't detect in the aroma. This beer is nearly sickly sweet. Dark chocolate, molasses, raisins. It has a light earthy bitterness and some smoke, but not a hell of a lot of balance. It ages nicely, but fresh this doesn't distinguish itself from others in the style.  M: Velvety smooth, creamy, and full-bodied. Low carbonation, as is appropriate for the style. A little alcohol burn (not warmth), but it's mostly well-masked. I love the toasty exhalation that follows each sip.  D: I opened one with largadeer, who wound up leaving early and making me finish the can on my own. It was very hard. That, and the price increases, and my decreasing tolerance for sickly-sweet RISes, have made me a little tired of this beer overall. I don't see myself buying this again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,cottonkoozie,4.2,"A - Used motor oil, 10W-30. Very little head that doesn't last long, no lacing. But for the style, not bad.  S - Sweet malts and a fruity smell. Pretty good.  T - Much like the smell, lots of chocolate and caramel malts at first, followed by a nice hops bitterness. Sweet boozy finish though keeps this from being a 5 for me.  M - think and syrupy, goos for the style.  D - Good for the style, but honestly one of these is all I could do in one sitting.  Overall this is a good RIS, however, not top 100 beers in my opinion. Good beer, above average, but not great. Rather have an Old Rasputin. Like many Oscar blues beers, overhyped.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bret27,4.33,"Had this beer previously on tap @pizza port solana but felt I should review to just add to it's great reputation.  Poured from a can. Strange feeling pouring motor oil out of a can for consumption.  A: Black and thick, minimal brown head.  S: Chocolate covered bananas at first. Chocolate and coffee come forth as it warms w/swirling in glass. Little warm booze.  T: chocolate and sweet caramel dance as roasty burnt coffee beans cut through them. Still taste a little banana, maybe just me. small booze warmth from middle of palate to throat, but very subdued by sweet syrup mouthfeel.  M: so syrupy and great. Not quite as thick as syrup of course but just maybe engine grade oil. If you named this older viscosity, I don't think anyone would argue  D: If you like thick and assertive w/o much alcohol presence and all flavor, very nice. Is pretty sweet though.  Overall: I have personally been hit or miss on Oskar Blues' beers. This, along w/Dales Pale is definitely a hit!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S - Roasted malts and chocolate / bitter aroma, espresso like qualities. Definitely became much more complex as it warmed up, adding a raisin aroma and some minor hop.  T - Strong roasted malts and sweet molasses flavors. Not overly sweet for a 10% beer, and a small hop presence at the end.  M - Wet and reasonably carbonated for a draft pour, nice residual creaminess at the end.

2681,34483,darklordlager,3.93,"Oskar Blues Ten Fidy (2009)--Canned 11/25/09, pretty fresh.  A-Pours a dark brown/black with a bubbly dark brown foam cap--perhaps the darkest head I've seen. Coats the glass when swirled.  S-Pineapple! Tropical fruit, a little banana perhaps. If you really dig past the pineapple you can detect a little chocolate character, and vanilla. The malt makes a good effort to subdue the hop scent once it warms. Not the most complex RIS I've had by any means. The pineapple is definitely at the forefront of this beer--probably heavily dry hopped, and will mellow with age.  T-Light fruity hops play into roasted malt. Nothing too complex (which may change with age, although I don't see too much potential) Much lighter than the appearance lead it to be. A little sweet chocolate comes out as it warms, followed by a French roasted coffee acidity in the finish, slight hoppy bitterness.  M-Not nearly as syrupy as the Expedition had side by side. More creamy than syrupy, which I enjoy.  D-The alcohol is hidden much better than the expedition, coming in very smoothly with the finish only (as opposed to being evident up-front in the Expedition). Very smooth for an RIS of this strength and for how young it is.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The smell is just as an RIS should be, however I would like it to be a little stronger. The roasted carmel scents are there, but it's just not kick you in the butt like the taste is. And the taste is well balanced, with no noticeable spice that might throw out the style. Just perfect. The mouthfeel is very nice as well. There is a alcohol warmth to this, but for it's age it isn't all that overwhelming. Another perfection.

2681,34483,Soneast,4.15,"Canned 10/27/09. Pours a pitch black color, with a 1 finger thick, brown colored head, that receded rapidly to a creamy ring, leaving heady residue on the glass the whole way down.  The aroma is rich in dark chocolate and roasted goodness, with a touch of anise and and burnt caramel. A very coffee-like aroma really takes over as it warms.  The flavor starts off with some nice roasted qualities giving way to a bitter cocoa flavor with a hint of vanilla as well as a dark fruit, raisin-like character and I seem to be picking up some anise flavors as well. The finish is relatively bitter with a decent alcohol presence.  Thick bodied and well carbonated. Great complexity and delicious flavors. I am thoroughly enjoying this stout. Not sure why I'm picking up the anise smells/flavors...thankfully I love black licorice. It still tastes a tad young, so I think I'll age the other two cans I have left. I can only imagine how tasty this will be with a year on it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,AndyAvalanche,4.58,"Woa, talk about impressive. Only the 2nd beer I've had from this brewery, and I'm still most impressed. This is one of the greatest looking beers....ever. From the can into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass this beer pours out completely black in color, really no highlights to it. I had a huge foamy head that was one of the most unique colors I've ever seen. Similar in color to coffee with a slight amount of creamer to it, but almost had a reddish tint to it and it provides some decent lacing, spots all over the glass from top to bottom. The smell consists mostly of roasted malts and heavy amounts of chocolate slightly blended with some coffee. I actually expected to smell a touch of alcohol, but nothing. You can pick up on the hop aroma, but I couldn't notice it until it was room temperature. Excellent taste to this, absolutely wonderful. Same combination as the smell, it really has heavy amounts of chocolate, almost like fudge. There are roasted malts which adds to the initial sweetness. The hops are much easier to single out in the taste than the smell, pine. I noticed the coffee hints right before the hops. Extremely well balanced flavor with all the different flavors, well done! The mouthfeel is truly exceptional. Full bodied with an excellent texture to it, heavy, sweet and a bitter finish. All of this blended together so well leaves this an extremely drinkable beer. 2 for 2 from Oskar Blues in my opinion.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BeerFMAndy,3.69,"12 oz can poured into a Nonic. ""canned with care"" 10-27-09 @ 14:52 ""Join the dark side"" on the bottom. Part three of ""Birthday Beer Extravaganza""  Thanks to Beerwolf77 for this canned beauty!  A - I absolutely did not expect this from a can. The pour showed the beer to be extremely dark cocoa brown with a good clarity but I have never seen a beer so black in my life. It's as black as the can it comes in, blacker even than Satan's soul. It also poured with a head darker than any I've ever seen. Totally chocolate brown and dense, it has moderate retention with specks of lace left on the glass.  S - The aroma broods with deep roasted malts, cocoa, and unsweetened chocolate. Unfortunately like the Rochefort 10 before it, it also has a strong metallic nose. A bit of alcohol comes out on a swirl and, thankfully, the malts become more prominent than the metallic nose.  T - The malts seem to be at an insanely roasted level. Lots of molasses flavor with bittersweet chocolate too but damn it, it's got that same metallic-like thing the nose does. I don't know if it's from the can or from the malts being roasted beyond comparison (if that's possible) but it makes it much less appealing to me. It also has a slight nutty, woody hint to it and a little spice with the alcohol. A bit overly roasted methinks.  M - This beer would compare to some motorcycle oil in weight. It's as thick as molasses and coats your throat the same. Almost no carbonation to speak of and an utterly full-bodied beer. The finish is a bit dry and bitter from the sheer level of roast.  D - OY, this beer is out of control. I'm having a hard time sipping at it for two reasons; 1) The ridiculously roasted flavor, and 2) that pesky metallic thing. Sometimes more is not better which is exemplified in this beer. I'm going to try and share it now.  This might be the Star Wars geek in me, but my favorite part of this beer besides its ink color is the ""join the dark side"" quote on the bottom.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Deep dark malts, but not all that roasty. A little booze noticeable as well.  T: Massive maltyness, mainly cocoa flavors, but the roasted malt characteristics absent in the smell are there too along with a bit of tobacco. Hefty dose of hops adds plenty of bitterness for a bittersweet chocolate flavor that completely saturates my tastebuds. Definitely falls into the sweeter ""milkshake"" category of RIS's.  M: Thick and creamy. Very light on the carbonation, but it works pretty well.  D: Ten FIDY doesn't hide its alcohol quite as well as some RIS's but it is tasty enough to keep me raising my glass.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Travlr,4.42,"The best thing to come out of a can since Guinness with a widget. Appearance is oil can black with a medium chestnut colored head and scant lacing. Smell is smoky, with burnt espresso and spice. Taste starts with caramel then chocolate, progresses to raosted coffee with heavy cream. Bitter and dryish finish. Best beer of the night, even if you count the Three Floyds tasting later that evening.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TheJollyHop,3.81,"Decided to end my drinking night with this brew. Have to say, I have never had a craft beer in a can. With that being said, here is my review.  Opening the can, this beer pours a very thick, viscous black with a large, two finger milk chocolate head. Malt scents of molasses, roasted notes, hint of maple syrup, and some faint alcohol.  Has a roasted character that tastes of cherries, booze, with a bitter tail ,and some alcohol warmth at the end. Some chocolate/coffee flavor combination is in there as well. Very chewy, and mouth coating. It envelopes your tongue completely, bombarding it with hop bitterness. I think this beer could use a little age, to mellow out the alcohol.  In my opinion this beer is a sipper. A little too hot to want to drink another, but likable for an occasional beer diversion.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,infi,4.4,"2009 release, canned with care on 10/01 at 10:20.  Poured into a snifter.  Smoothly pours out a dark and rich color and carries much viscosity in the glass. Initially releases a thin mocha-colored head, which slowly dies into a thin ring. You can see a thin layer of the alcohol atop the head, especially when you swirl it. The head leaves some nice thin sheets of lacing around, as well as some mini speckles. The smell is thoroughly roasted. Coffee bean and malts straight up, with some hints of chocolate and caramel as well. Not much afterwards.  Damn. The taste is so, so, so delicious. Tastes like iced coffee with chocolate syrup swirled into it. Took me by surprise. Roasted coffee is initially the heaviest flavor by all means. Some bready malt in between and then graciously ends on a huge milk/dark chocolate combination. On the aftertaste, coffee astringency and bitterness lingers on the palate. There is seriously no taste of the alcohol in this beer, especially at a titanic 9.2%. Only the beautiful warmth as it goes down. This is seriously tasty and gratifying.  Mouthfeel is perfect. Thick, smooth and chewy in all aspects. Literally a meal in itself. Evident through the taste, the drinkability is very much high, but slow. I'd give it a perfect 5 if it weren't for the high alcohol to counter the fast drinking that this beer should carry. Also the fact that I paid around $5 for a single is a bit ludicrous. Makes my wallet cry. Oskar Blues, why are your Ten FIDY four-packs so expensive?! I'd love to have this stout all year long, but the price is what keeps it in check.  Seriously one of the best stouts I've had.. a contender to the FBS by all means. A definite brew to look out for and have a try. Aside from the price, it's worth buying and poured into your glass.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

When pouring this out of the can I had to make sure I was not pouring motor oil, but rest assured, this is thicker than motor oil. Even the pour is black, amazing. Head is light tan that leaves without a trace. Does have some ABV legs with light lacing.  The smell is very faint, but what is there is heavy earth notes with dark malts. Like I said before not very strong.  The tastes are great. The dark malts are very present in this, they must have boiled out more than half of what they started with. What I mean is this is chewy as hell. The ABV pushes through to present some licorice and chocolate tastes, which tastes delicious. Some hop bitterness as well because it is so fresh fresh baby. Delicious.  The mouthfeel is amazingly thick. I am biting through this beer. It is heavy in my mouth and stomach, a meal for sure. I love it.  THe drinkability is good for being what it is.

Smell - Has a strong coffee smell to me, toasted malt, and a hint of vanilla. Twinge of green olives, sounds strange, but that is all I can explain it as.  Taste - Full on roasted flavor, some bitterness, little chocolate. Alcohol is subtle. Flavor is pretty well rounded.  Mouthfeel - One of the thickest beers I have had, little creamy, good amount of carbonation.  Drink - Fairly easy to drink, wouldn't have guess it's alcohol content was that high. Wouldn't want to drink a ton of this in one sitting.

2681,34483,doppelmeup,4.53,"I was fortunate enought to have a glass of this on tap at the brewery in Lyon, CO.  Pitch black, with a cinnamon mocha colored head. Not a lot of foam, however the serving glass was filled to the top so there wasn't alot of room. Even so, some rich foam remained all the way down the glass.  Not a strong aroma for many of the reasons just mentioned. I also have a cold so my sense of smell is not working well. Still, some roast and malt aromas were present, with a slight sweetness.  The taste. Exceptional! Roasted malts, slight coffee and bitter chocolate flavors; however not bitter nor over the top in flavors either. Is there even any alcohol in this 10.5 beer? You'd never guess it if you didn't know.  Mouthfeel was also spectacular. For a big, heavy stout, this is very light and smooth on the palate. It is actually very soft. Warming as it goes down, it is a great sipping beer.  Overall, the drinkability is very good for a stout this strong. I could easily have a couple glasses at one sitting, but it is rich and filling and will catch up to you.

The nose offers aromas of chocolate, coffee, molasses, black licorice, spicey/slightly piney hops, slight irish cream liquor, dark berries (prunes?), & chocolate cake. Very thick on the palate with great carbonation and sweet, but not too sweet flavors of everything I got on the nose. There is an alcohol presence on the back end and a subtle bitterness in the beginning that lingers to the finish.

2681,34483,davod23,3.45,"Fresh Ten Fidy. Had it before, but haven't reviewed it quite yet. Poured from a can into my Bruery tulip.  Appearance: Big surprise here. Pour is thick and black. Maybe it's because it's a canned beer, but the damn thing looks very much like motor oil. Tan head forms but is gone in no time flat, with little cirrus clouds of foam that remain at the top of the brew.  Smell is nice enough. Roasted malts, dark chocolate, anise. Not as big and bold an aroma as I would like from a top-rated imperial stout, but it's nice.  Taste... hmm... yeah, this is pretty much how I remember it. Dark chocolate, anise, pretty sweet... oh yeah, and a metric ass-ton of black licorice. Honestly, the licorice is overpowering in this brew. I wouldn't mind a hint of it, but it really shouldn't be the dominant flavor, IMO. Points for being fairly unique amongst impy stouts, I guess. Long, lasting finish. Notable lack of boozy heat.  Mouthfeel is very nice. Just a hint of carbonation. Very thick, full mouthfeel - like the consistency of a slightly-melted milkshake. Nice.  Drinkability isn't bad for an imperial stout of this magnitude. However, it's not great. The licorice is tough to work through, and it becomes a bit fatiguing. I can't imagine wanting to drink more than one of these in a sitting.  Honestly, I'm not sure why this gets such high marks. It's an okay imperial stout, but there are so, so many that are far better (BT, DL, GI BCS, Abyss, KBS, Expedition, Old Rasputin, Serpent's Stout, etc). I don't know when I will get around to drinking the other three cans I have of this brew.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Appearance is very dark black that poured out like a can of motor oil leaving a brown one finger head leaving a little sticky lacing around the edges.  Smell is is a wonderful aroma of roasted malts, coffee, and dark chocolate. Quite toasty and welcoming.  Taste is fantastic! A strong rich blend of coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruits all starting out sweet and ending with a nice bitter finish. All around rich and well blended!  Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and as smooth as velvet.  Drinkability is fantastic! It goes down very smooth and is quite tasty. I'd want to say its a great session beer but the abv seams quite well hidden and could probably sneak up on you easy if you have a few.

T- Coffeelike roasty malts are predominant up-front on the palate... along with the more subtle and anticipated flavors of dark fruit, brown sugar and white chocolate. Finishes a little hot with alcohol (in a non-offensive way), chocolate and with a touch of hop astringency.

2681,34483,kindestcut,4.75,"You know when people define Imperial Stouts as ""thick""or ""viscous""? Usually, that's code for ""this is a dark beer."" However, this is one of the few beers that I can say without pause that it looks thick when it pours. At the onset you can tell that this is going to be a unique experience...and it is.  The can is a wonderful thing. You don't have to worry about it breaking. Your drunk friends can't break it and use it as a weapon. And you can always crush it on your forehead if you are drunk enough.  The pour is dark, to say the least. The head is light brown and lingers for a couple of minutes...the amount of time I let the beer warm before I could wait no longer to taste it.  The aroma is just wonderful- malty, smoky and chocolaty. The smell invites you to drink the beer. I think my mouth actually watered as I typed this.  At first taste I felt like I was drinking a malt at an old-fashioned soda fountain. This is a very thick beer, creamy and delicious. The malty aroma translates here to a wonderful sweetness. The chocolate is apparent as is a roasted malt flavor. There is a slight hoppiness on the finish that definitely aids this huge beer in its balance and drinkability.  Unfortunately (and this isn't necessarily a bad thing) the alcohol is so well hidden you could drink the Ten Fidy as you would a ""normal"" beer. That makes it dangerous.  I like danger.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A nice balance between the burnt toast, chocolate, caramel, coffee, with some hints of alcohol.  M: A big robust full bodied beer. A thick creamy sweetness, with a tad of bitterness is left on the palate.  D: Definitely a dessert sipping beer. A high alcohol content keeps this to maybe one or two in a sitting.

2681,34483,Foxtrot,4.65,"Seeing as I've been into Stouts of late, I wanted to track down and taste this canned RIS.  Pours black obsidian with lavish 1 finger with one of the darkest heads that I've seen. Dark brown with good retention and moderate lacing.  Aroma is a chocolate makers Heaven! Huge strong notes of bitter chocolate, light milk chocolate, roasted espresso beans, a nice dash of hops, and a light underlying aroma of charred malts. I'm already salivating from a few whif's of this beauty.  Ten FIDY doesn't disappoint. Begins with a myriad of chocolate flavors that caress the tongue accompanied by sticky molasses, and coffee. One thing to note is the light citrus hope presence near the finish. Nice and crisp and not overpowering like some RIS's that I've encountered in the past. Finish is smooth, no alcoholic heat from this brew whatsoever.  Mouthfeel is the epitome of creamy. Full and luscious as it delivers it tasty goodness. Carbonation is spot on.  The sky is the limit with drinkability. The 9.5% ABV is extremely well hidden, but this beer really shines as the weather drops. And not to mention its the best canned beer I've ever had!

2681,34483,nomomentwasted,4.41,"Had this out of a can twice now, and the second time through only confirmed the first: this is the best canned beer I have had to date. By a looong shot. And it's funny that this beer get such recognition for being in a can, and for a long time, I wondered if it was due to its canning that people made such a fuss. If this were in a bomber, would the love still remain?  Yes, yes, yes. It's very solid.  Picked up a 4-pack for 14 bucks. Considering that's ~ two 750s, that's about 7 bucks worth, and allows for four differently timed tastings. Awesome.  Appearance: No getting around this one: it's about as good as they come. A solid pour yields thick, creamy brown head on top of an obsidian-black brew. Laces thickly down the glass and looks about as good as a stout ever could. Fantastic!  Smell: Chocolate, roasted coffee, more chocolate, roasty malts, and a hop presence on the back-end. And then more chocolate! It wasn't as fiercely assertive as I'd hoped, but still very inviting.  Taste: Whew, someone call Hershey's, since Oskar Blues has illicitly used their chocolate! Man, this beer taste thick and chocolaty, with some deep molasses sweetness as well. There is almost a citric bitterness there as well, which is certainly from the hops. Not quite as hoppy as Storm King, which surprised me a bit. Neither tasting struck me as such, but still hopped nicely. Very, very tasty. Girlfriend beer even, and I mean that in the way that it's a fun one to get people who avoid dark beer to try, as it will surely change some minds.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, thick, and bitter. Stout all the way. Almost syrupy goodness. Just so smooth and creamy, thick like chocolate syrup and carbonated appropriately with a nice bitterness as well. Just all together very, very solid.  Drinkability: As for as 10% ABV, it's certainly felt a bit by the end of 12oz, but it's also a very friendly drink. Rarely does the alcohol ever peak through, and if it does, it's never off-putting. Worth seeking out and spending a few bucks for a 4-pack, as it really makes an excellent beer for cold nights, desserts, camping trips, or really any occasion.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Background ha some sweeter chocolate and coffee aromas as it warms up. Medium bodied, creamy and smooth, with soft carbonation. Very nice, but not quite as thick or syrupy as expected. Finish has more of the roast barley and burnt malt flavors, little hop or sweetness. Flavor starts a little harsh, strong hop presence and burnt flavors. Middle and finish mellows out with mild milk chocolate and sweeter malt before the finish described above. I'm conflicted about this, I had high expectations for it and it's not bad, but I can't really decide what's holding this back from really exciting me.

Finish is sharp with hops and alcohol coming into play in an unpleasant combination.

Taste resembles the smells but I just don't think they are as intense, again I will age and try again later.  M-Good carbonation, definately a big/heavy/viscous beer that is very creamy on the mouthfeel and the alcohol is definately evident but is not overwhelming.

Absolutely sinister looking and leaves about two fingers of mocha colored head which recedes slowly and leaves great looking lacing.  Smell - Licorice, roasted malt, dark/bittersweet chocolate, and hints of coffee. Smells amazing.  Taste - Great roasted malt flavor with an immediate bittersweet chocolate/coffee flavor. A bit of hops shows through and as the drink warms you can definitely feel the warmth of the alcohol show through. Very  Mouthfeel - Medium thickness (but not syrupy) and an extremely smooth/creamy mouthfeel. Low levels of carbonation which suits this drink seeing as it is a full bodied RIS. Great mouthfeel.  Drinkability - Honestly pretty damn drinkable but when I think about it I would have to say one and I'm done. Granted I had planned on this being the end beer of the night, but even if it wasn't I don't think I could do two of these in a sitting.

2681,34483,NoHipTee,3.17,Not my favorite RIS. The promise of the smooth dark pour was not delivered in either smell or taste. Two qualities that I cannot separate when tasting a beer for the first time. The whole experience is so tied together that I am almost shocked by what a let down the smell is. Watching it pour into my glass made me long for a deep nose full of rich aroma but I was left with a strong alcohol and burnt molasses. Like biting into bakers chocolate when expecting a hersheys bar.  A: dark smooth appearance with a small amount of head that dissapates quickly in the glass. No lacing to speak of.  S: Almost rubbing alcohol with a burned candied cherry hiding in the back.  T: Hard to distinguish from the smell. Definite cherry flavors (I know this sounds wierd but this tastes like one of those pie cherries that had already fallen off the tree and started to ferment.) Mom told me not to eat those.  M: The rich undertones do coat your entire mouth. Very little carbonation to get in the way. Feels like an after dinner dessert liquor.  D: One is enough to last a long while. A sipper for sure.

Liquid is a menacing bistre, approaching black topped by a fallow to dark-tan finger of foam. Excellent cascading lacing, and a whisper of varnishing legs.  Complex aromatics include dark roast coffee, toffee, brown bread crust, slight burnt toast, hot chocolate, and caramel.  Molasses, rich malt and grain roasted to varying levels, cocoa, espresso, and earth notes on the palate. Prunes and/or dates, followed by a wonderful bitterness to balance the sugars - equal parts hops and roasty astringency. Very long rich bittersweet finish.  Heavy bodied, moderately carbonated, wonderfully warming - thick, luscious mouthfeel with just enough astringency to keep you from chugging.

The aromas were a little more subdued than I expected for the style, but still full of deep, rich roasted notes. The flavor was right where I think the style should be, plenty of the deep malts with just a slight tang of hop on the finish.  The body was also just about right for the style, full, deep and rich without being overly heavy.

A very slight carbonation and nice hop flavor and bitterness really nicely layer. Rich and feels like its full of vitamins, must be good for me. The dark stout feels like its pulling the color right from my tongue. I have a feeling my tooth brush will be black every day for the next two weeks now. It leaves a layer of thick syrup that never goes away, no matter how much I drink more of it, wait, that doesn't seem to work. And I can barely even detect the alcohol, except a slight warming and spice taste, so it hides the 10% very well!  M: Super thick and even thicker than that. Creamy and rich, flows down your throat slower than molasses. Layers your mouth and very low carbonation.  F: Finishes pretty stouty and dry, and like super bitter dark chocolate. A chocolate milk comes to mind, chocolate milk that would conjure up the depths of oblivion and demon spirits from beyond the gates of Grenach! I can feel the lost souls escaping from the thick syrup into my tongue and trying to run away and but getting swallowed by the richness.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Sean9689,4.25,"A RIS in a can? Could it be? Yes. Poured from 12oz can into DFH snifter.  A - Pours black with a dark roasted brown/tan colored head. Two fingers worth of head leaves a small amount of lacing an a thin cap on top with some bubbles popping up here and there.  S - Dark fruits, alcohol burn, sweet malts, molasses, burnt carmel, coffee beans, and some chocolate. Lots of dark fruity sweetness up front with the malts followed by the bitter coffee/chocolate notes on the end.  T - A lot more bitter chocolate and coffee beans then I was expecting. I thought this would be more sweet but I actually prefer the bitterness over the sweetness. Some alcohol burn, but not 10% worth, very well hidden. A nice roasted/bitter finish that I'm really digging.  M - Full bodied, creamy and rich, really engulfs the palate. A dry finish.  D - At 10%, this would kick my ass if I opened another can. That said, it's very approachable for the style and ABV. Great things do come from cans, there's no doubt about it with this one!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S - Big tasty roasted malt smells, with touches of chocolate and toffee. Sweet and heavy on the nose. Smells awesome.  T - Sweet, chocolate and toffee at first. The hops kick in and balance out the sweetness half way through the sip. The aftertaste has coffee and bitter cocoa notes, which is a nice balance to the sweet begining of this beer.  M - Thick and syrupy, with moderate carbonation. This beer is smooth and velvety.  D - Incredibably drinkable. This is smooth,big and well balanced. The alcohol is completely covered up and the taste is awesome.

2681,34483,bobsy,3.65,"I've had the good fortune to try the whiskey-barrelled Ten FIDY, and while it wasn't really to my liking it didn't dampen my desire to try the original Ten FIDY - one of the world's benchmark imperial stouts. While I did enjoy my hour with this beer, it wasn't the mind blowing experience I hoped for, and I would not put in the top tier of imperials.  The appearance is classic. If there is a darker imperial stout I would like to see it. A midnight black body supports a finger of chocolate head which slowly dies down and leaves tings of lace on the snifter. A rich aroma of chocolate, coffee, vanilla and sweet rum soaked dark fruit greets the nose. Up to now, everything is first rate, and has me thinking that Ten FIDY deserves its spot in the top 100.  Its in the flavour where I feel the beer starts to lose it. While all the requisite elements are there they are overpowered by a sticky sweetness which makes the whole beer unbalanced for me. Its as if the bittersweet chocolate and rich coffee notes that are lurking underneath have been bullied to submission by an army of sugar. Its too bad, really, as I know that if it was toned down a notch I'd find this beer to be phenomenal, because its otherwise nicely balanced and full of roasty goodness. There's even a nice hop bite in the tail. The body is also spot on for the style, but when coupled with the sweetness, its heavy weight slowly becomes cloying.  I wasn't expecting this to be such a huge dessert beer, and it probably wouldn't have been a problem if I hadn't already had two helpings of pie. Just too much sugar all round. Tone it down and call me back.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MaxBrews,4.23,"Presentation 12 oz can into a Pint glass.  Appearance: This is quite a sight. It looks and glugs like motor-oil out of the can. The color is an impossible black. 100% absence of late. The darkest beer you have seen. The head looks like a fingers width of espresso crema and dissipates much like a shot of espresso would. Even coffee isn't this black. If it wasn't for the medium brown lacing I'd be scared to drink this brew, so this gets a 4.5 in appearance.  Smell: Big whiff of alcohol in the nose and a huge medley of roasted malt. Smells like coffee and dark cocoa colliding with bourbon.  Taste: Dissipate the huge alcoholic nose, the beer is far more pleasant then that. Tastes like dark chocolate malt balls, biscuit and a little bit off coffee. This beer is 98 ibus so there most a decent amount of hopping, however I cannot taste much. It might be what is giving this beer a bright biscuity finnish. Theres also a tiny bit of prune and plum taste hidden in there. Chocolate biscuit taste gets more pronounced as the beer warms as does its alcoholic warmth.  Mouthfeel: Despite smelling the alcohol there is hardly any taste of it. Nor is the 98ibus all that noticeable. There is a dryness in this beer, but its not brutal. Body is extremely thick and heavy. I mean would you expect anything less for something this dark and evil looking.  Drinkability: As with all imperial stouts, its not really a beer for an occasion, however this is more drinkable then many even for being a 10% motor oil looking 98 ibu monster. Will drink again especially as winter dawns defiantly a fireplace sipper. Ones really enough to fill your stomach.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,rfgetz,3.9,"Pours a deep dark black. Full frothy khaki head, retention is good and lacing is nice. Smell is of roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, earth, dark fruit. Taste follows smell with a focus on the coffe, chocolate earth and dark fruit. Oily, viscous, full bodied. Not too sticky and little aftertaste. Very good tasting RIS that leans a little away from tradition.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,GarrisWH,4.41,"A - Pours an opaque, pitch black color with a somewhat thin but very nice looking creamy, dark brown head. Spotty lacing.  S - Rich, roasted malt aromas with notes of coffee, cocoa and a hint of sweet dark fruitiness. There is a bit of hop bitterness hiding in the background.  T - Very flavorful roasted malts with tones coming through similar to the aroma - mostly coffee, cocoa and some dark fruit (raisins, prunes). A nice level of hop bitterness backs up the malts, and gives the finish a nice, slightly dry feel leading into a lingering roasty malt flavor. The ABV is hidden well too, not picking up on much, if any, alcohol flavor.  M - Very rich and full bodied with a smooth feel due to low carbonation.  D - A great example of the RIS style. Very nice combination of malt flavors and well-balanced with ample hop bitterness backing up the richness. The only thing that would hold me back on the drinkability is the 10% abv, which could be dangerous in such a delicious brew. I will definitely be adding this into the winter rotation.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Mistofminn,4.58,"Thanks to BA beandip for a 4 pack of this! Thanks Adam!  Poured into my Surly tulip. Pours a thick jet black, completely opaque. Initially it doesn't look like much head will show up, but after you stop pouring it grows. I got about a finger of molasses colored head. Retention isn't the greatest, and it doesn't leave much lacing. But other than that, I couldn't imagine a better looking RIS.  The nose is an expert blend of bitter chocolate, sweet malts, vanilla and caramel, ground coffee, roasted malts. It's not unlike other RIS's I've had. There isn't a realy big hop character here, this one is very malty.  The taste is much more roasty than I anticipated, almost drowning out the subtle hints of caramel and vanilla. I still get a significan portion of bitter chocolate and ground coffee. There is a nice bitter bite at the end. No alcohol present. There is also a bit of molasses as it warms.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, smooth and beautiful. Goes down great, it's hard to put this one down. The bitterness definitely comes out in the taste, which is odd because I didn't get it at all in the nose.  Drinkability is good. What a great beer from a can. I'm very impressed.  Finally! I've been meaning to pick this up in Hudson for ages, but every time I go, they are sold out. Thank you so much, Adam, for the chance to try this great beer!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jhp40219,5,"Amazing, top of the line Imperial Stout here! Pours a dark black with the look and consistancy of used motor oil. Rich chocolate-colored two-fingered head. Smells of roasted coffee and chocolate. Normally I am not a fan of imperial stouts. Generally they taste like burnt coffee with alcohol added. This isn't like that. This is strong, as an imperial stout should be, but extremely tasty and drinkable. Not something a frat boy is going to chug. Instead it is a very savory sipping beer. Huge delicious chocolate taste with hints of coffee and malts. A slight alcohol burn on the back of the throat after a drink, but not something you are going to taste. Left a dark brown lace on the glass after each drink that required the pint glass to have a second quick rinse afterwards. Generally the imperial stouts I have tried have a very up-front alcohol taste. Not this one at all. Works extremely well after a nice meal as a dessert. I would not give any beer a perfect rating unless it absolutely deserved it. This one does. I have had top-rated imperial stout DarkLord by 3 Floyds Brewery at three seperate beer festivals, and I have to say I prefer Ten Fidy to it. Ten Fidy should be every bit as celebrated as DarkLord! Ten Fidy should be the gold standard that all imperial stouts aspire to.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Aromas are of chocolate, coffee, and licorice. The taste is pretty much what you would expect from a well-crafted RIS. I still cannot get over how this heavenly goodness just poured right out of a can! Who would have thought? This stout is big, bold, and powerfully flavorful. At 10% ABV, it went down smooth, but at this level, you are confined to one, maybe two at best. A great nightcap.

The blackest of the black, with two finger dark brown head that has minimal retention but leaves medium lacing down the glass.  S: Smells of heavily roasted malts, chocolate malt as well as roasted barley. At 98 IBU's I would expect some hops in the nose, but I can't find any.  T: Again, heavily roasted malts and barley, definitely some bitterness from earthy hops. The alcohol is there, but not overly done and leaves a welcoming warming sensation in the aftertaste. Milky chocolate is most prevalent in the taste overall, coffee comes in a close second. Very good.  M/D: Very viscous, very thick mouthfeel. Silky smooth with the low carbonation. Alcohol is present and leaves a bit of a burn.  A great beer that I would buy over and over again if it were available here in Ohio.

The darkest head I've ever seen in a beer, settles to about 1cm and is pretty uniform. Looks damn impressive.  S- I can smell this from the pour. Boozy, for sure. Rich, dark chocolate and spicy plums. A bit too boozy, in my opinion.. but then again its 10%, so I guess its all in order.  T- Wow. Really really good. The alcohol in the nose has almost vanished in the taste. Caramel, coffee, and burnt malts shine through, each fighting to be the dominate force. Whatever wins, its all good for me. A superb RIS. Sweet, but not cloying at all... this comes from a can????  M- Rich, creamy, but not as heavy as you would expect. Goes down incredibly smooth, with a bit of alcohol on the back end... but @ 10%... damn. Very well-crafted. I am impressed.  D- Moderate, as most RIS's are.. perhaps a bit moreso though. I really enjoyed this beer, and at the price, I couldn't name a better RIS. I waited a long time before I got this.. glad I finally did. Now I have to make up for lost time. While I wasn't blown away by Dales Pale.. this beer has left my jaw on the floor. I see a lot more of this in my future.

Mouthfeel: IMHO, the best feature of this beer. Thick, creamy, smooth, and full bodied. Wow.  Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable for 10.00% ABV. Smooth, creamy, and just downright good.

2681,34483,TimDudley,4.24,"Pours as black as oil, and nearly as thick. Little carbonation. A thin head quickly disappears, leaving only a milk chocolate ring around the glass.  Aroma is not very strong, but what's there is full of burnt caramel, chocolate, and soy sauce.  Taste is sweet and metallic - perhaps from the can? Bitter coffee, soy sauce, and molasses dominate up front. Also a slight dried fruit. Hops at the end, not much but more than your typical stout. The hops are a bit floral and not too dry, typical of popular American hop varieties, and do a lot to balance the initial dark sweetness.  The flavor here is incredibly complex. The more I sip, swish, and think, the more I can detect. A sweet note here, a bitter note there, a glimmer of citrus, some burnt smoke. Alcohol is surprisingly hidden.  A looong aftertaste, deserving of at least five or six o's. Finish is dry, with a slight iodine bitterness that fills the palate long after I've swallowed.  Mouth is bold and full. The beer coats the tongue. There's not much carbonation or alcohol tinge. It's smooth, not syrupy. It's highly drinkable - but 'sippable' rather than 'gulpable'. I could easily put back several over the course of a few hours, it's not heavy or filling like most stouts. I'm restricting myself to one, though, mostly because at 10% alcohol, I might not remember anything past the third.  Ten Fidy has been on my 'to-try' list for about two years, so there's a great deal of anticipation and expectation here. I'm happy to report that my high standards were met, but not exceeded. This is the most hoppy stout I've ever tasted, yet somehow that's desirable. A great beer all around.

Poured absolutely black and as much as I don't like the analogy, this actually looked like used motor oil coming from an oil can - very cool effect. Head was fairly thin as expected and was milk chocolate in color. Aromas were of burnt and roasted malts, espresso, dark chocolate, and a hint of sweetened anise perhaps. It was instantaneously boozy, but not overly, with full notes of roasted malt, dark bakers chocolate, and bold espresso, with the hops providing a somewhat spicy finish and a prickle on the tongue - a very pleasant dark chocolate taste lingers on in the bittersweet finish as well. At 98 ibu, this is tremendously balanced and the bitterness seems to be more burnt and roasty. Alcohol is present, but well concealed and provides some fruity esters resembling ripened dark fruits.

Taste: lots of big fruity alcohol taste supported with thick, roasted malts. It is not overly bitter and is surprisingly smooth. There is that hint of the sea in the flavor too, but not enough to be truly off-putting. It's not bad, but it's not my favorite RIS.  Mouthfeel: huge body, not particularly carbonated.

Pours a thick dark black. At first I thought I mixed it up with a can of Mobil 1 or greasy granny's gopher gravy, but, nope, it's Ten Fidy, says right there on the can.  Smells sweet and some nice cocoa touches. Lots of roast, and a bit of molasses.  Taste is awesome! A bit of alcohol warmth, then chocolate and brown sugar sweetness and a dark, almost burnt flavor in the aftertaste. My girlfriend took a sip and dubbed it 'Dark Lord Jr.' I kinda see where she got that from, but let's not go crazy ;)  Mouthfeel is excellent. I've only had a few better mouthfeels on regular RIS's (my gold standard is New Holland Night Tripper). Thick and perfectly carbed for the style, a hair away from greatness.  I could drink a few of these. Very heavy, but not a pallate decimating beer. Actually quite refreshing, in a milk-shake kind of way. Leaves a coating and keeps you warm.  Overall, this was great.

Mouthfeel: Typical RIS mouthfeel: rich, smooth, and some heat, well actually a lot of heat. Full bodied with medium level of carbonation. Ends with a big roasted malt flavored aftertaste.

S: Molasses, roasted chocolate malts, dark fruit, sweet soy sauce, and a hint of alcohol.  T: I can't believe this came out of a can. Flavor begins rich and chocolatey with a hint of the sweet molasses and dark fruits entering into the middle. The taste then transitions into a roasty bitterness before again finishing sweet with a lingering sweet soy sauce aftertaste. Most enjoyable.  M: A very silky and impressive mouthfeel. There is little carbonation and the appearance of this brew really translates into the mouthfeel. It coated the inside of my mouth, leaving it sticky, hot, and chocolatey long after the beer went down.

S- Chocolate is the first to hit my nose followed by some coffee aroma. Chocolate smells very sweet and delicious. T- Taste is complex, sweet, and delicious. Chocolate really comes through nicely. Coffee is there and certainly detectable, but not that strong. Tastes like a founders breakfast stout but with the chocolate flavor outshining the coffee flavor. Alcohol seems top be apparent in some form of warming sweetness right as the beer hits the taste buds. The flavor then progresses to sweet chocolate then coffee and the warming is gone.

Not to say I couldn't drink a four pack if I had enough time.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,qchic,4.43,"This is one black beer. No light penetrates and thead is about as dark as I've seen. The aroma is roasty, boozy, slightly sweet, and creamy. Notes of coffee, chocolate, and smoke. Like the body, the flavor is full. Roasted malts, tons of coffee, prune, cocoa, wood, and raspberry. Nice bitterness throughout to balance the rich malts. This beer coats the mouth to say the least, and so much flavor makes this one a nice sipper. This has to be the biggest beer in a can and Oskar Blues did one heck of a job!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,sisuspeed,4.52,"Took the first sip out of the can. Wow, I never thought I would taste anything like this that wasn't bottled. Pretty funny. After a sip or two though, I poured the rest of the brew into a snifter to get a better appreciation for the beer.  This guy pours a dark brown, almost black, with a thin tan head. Nice foamy lacing on the sides of the glass. I can smell well roasted malts, some caramel and a bit of anise. There is also a faint hop aroma, but it is largely muted by the other scents.  The flavor is first of all, super smooth. Toasted dark malts, rich caramel notes and some well placed anise in the background. Hops come in and out of flavor, adding a slight bit of bitterness here and there, but never detracting from the smoothness of the taste. And finally, to add to this already incredible flavor, is the growing presence of milk chocolate malt. The chocolate really starts to come out as the beer warms up a bit and is delicious.  Mouthfeel is amazing. Thick, creamy, smooth and rich with the perfect amount of carbonation and warming alcohol. However, the 10% ABV is hidden very well and could creep up on you easily.  Hats off to Oskar Blues. I thought this would probably be a decent RIS, given the ranking, but it has blown past all of my expectations. Maybe it isn't the most complex RIS out there, but damn is it tasty and highly drinkable for the style. I will definitely be picking up more.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,abuliarose,4.37,"Poured from their can into a snifter. Appearance is a dark, opaque black with a little caramel-colored head that dies off fast. Smells thick, rich and delicious with notes of dates, fruity dark chocolate and a little dark roasted malt.  Tastes thick, rich and delicious (whoo hoo)! I venture to say this beer has even less metallic flavor than some of the other imperial stouts I've had out of bottles. Maybe it's a cap issue. Anyway, the beer enters sweet and smooth with all the tastes mentioned above highlighted by a refreshingly round carbonation and subtle but numbing bitterness to finish. The alcohol is apparent, but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is palpable, but not blanketing. It's heavy-bodied, but I find it pretty drinkable... possibly because of how good it tastes. It also comes in such a convenient size!  I am very pleased with this beer. For an RIS, Oskar Blues certainly met the mark.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ritzkiss,4.38,"Can states 9.5%, acquired with the help of a fine BA, piclee. Pours a thick black liquid with jetties of dark chocolate head twisting around, just the faintest hint of cherry around the edges.  Smell is initially a burst of roasted malts and smooth milk chocolate, just a dash of bitter chocolate thrown in as well. As it opens up some fruity elements come into play, almost smells port-like.  Thick, viscous body reveals a rich sweetness, controlled yet bold roasted malts, bitter chocolate, a dash of milk chocolate, plums, cherries, again a red wine/port hint there, booze in the finish along with just a slight drying. Everything so harmoniously blends together. Smooth, creamy body, not much carb but enough to get some bubbles when I swirl.  A really fine beer that drinks like a port, a real sipper for this cooler evening. So rich and sumptuous. Not overly roasty or even too in your face, yet it has all the rich flavor notes you're looking for in a world-class stout. Best beer in a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,hooliganlife,4.41,"caned on 10/28/08.  this took me by surprise, i cracked the can and i had to make sure it was not really motor oil. this pours thick, full, and jet black. little to no head, barely any retention, very light lacing.  giant roasted malts with light vanilla and chocolate. slight coffee with hints of alcohol. sweet candy mixed in there.  very bold with the roasted malts up front with the chocolate and coffee following. a light sweetness lingers through out.  very thick, almost beyond liquid. what else can be said?  blown away by this... when i poured it i knew i was in for something special. i enjoyed every sip of this. everything a RIS should be!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,digitalbullet,3.77,Apperance: dark as the moonless night with a thin head even after a slow pour Smell: dark roast coffee with a sprinkle of chocolate. A strong alchohol note present. Taste: Lots of coffee with dark chocolate. A strong boozy aftertaste that detracts from the goodness. Mouthfeel: slick on the tongue. Drinkability: due to the strong alchohol presence I have detract from here. It is difficult to have more than one due to the strong flavors.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,COBeerBuff,4.63,"Huge thanks to mcduck for sending this beer. I've wanted to get my hands on one of these cans for a while now. Poured in a Smokestack goblet...  Appearance: Crack of carbonation upon opening the can. Pours like motor oil from the can. Heavy carbonation leads to an opaque black liquid with a caramel-mocha colored head that dissipates quickly leaving a mocha ring around the glass, and tons of beautiful lacing down the sides. This beer looks exactly like an RIS should.  Smell: Chocolate and roasted malts, and a ton of them, at that. I can smell this beer from an arm's length away. Some vanilla and toffee as well, but the breadiness of the malt is overpowering. This smells delightful.  Taste: Exactly like it smells. Glorious roasted, toasted malts. Some nubs of dark chocolate mixed with some notes of caramel as well. The flavors meld together to create an otherworldly mishmash of beauty and goodness.  Mouthfeel: This is a heavy RIS. It coats the tongue (which saying it looked like motor oil coming out of the can makes it not much of a surprise) and envelops the taste buds. The toasted malts play well with the sweeter flavors, and it comes across very well in the overall feel of the beer.  Drinkability: The alcohol is very well hidden in this beer. The 10% ABV is almost nowhere to be found. Maybe a slight twinge on the swallow, but overall, this beer is pure bready malts and chocolate flavors. It's a shame this beer isn't distributed more widely, as this could become a staple in this Kansas home.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,mirish72,4.35,"So maybe waiting to try my first Ten FIDY on te hottest day of the year in Massachusetts wasn't the best way to experience this beer. That being said, if this beer is as good in the dead of winter as it was tonight, that means something.  It pours black, with a chocolate head. Malty, bitter, chocolate smell. Not overpowering but impressive. Nicely balanced beer that definitely lives up to the hype.  Still can't believe this beer comes out of a can, I will be picking more up soon.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,GregSVT,4.58,"A: This pours a pitch black color with a small dark brown head that dissipates to a small ring. I poured this one very violently and got a good 2-3 finger head.  S: Aromas of dark fruits, coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malt. I swear it almost smells like GI BCS without the bourbon kick.  T: The taste is one of the best in it's class. Big flavors of dark ripe fruit, coffee, small amount of sweet molasses, and dark roasted malt bitterness that balances out the sweeter tastes. Excellent!  M: The mouthfeel is excellent, thick and viscous. Carbonation is decent for a RIS and it helps the beer goes down smooth.  D: This goes down so easily and the alcohol is no where to be seen in the smell or taste. I could drink as many as I wanted before the ABV kicked my butt.  Great stuff and in my top 3 Russian Imperial Stouts. I buy at least a 4 pack anytime I see it on the shelf.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,beerman207,4.83,"A 2 fingers of head, it's a thing of beauty coming out of a can. Looks like I just tapped a jug of motor oil. Head hangs around quite a while and is almost a dark brown. Wow. Leaves quite a bit of lacing around the glass.  S - Smell is of chocolate, raisins, and some hazlenut?, perhaps even figs, the alcohol comes through the nose a bit as well  T - This thing tastes like chocolate and coffee as well some hints of dark fruit. Definately has some bitter coming through and a sweetness that adds to the finish as well as a nice warming feeling.  M - Wow, this is silky and smooth and just magnificent in terms of the mouthfeel. The carbonation is just right and the creaminess of this is very impressive.  D- This one is a sipper for sure. I would love to have more than one can of this. Will definatey look for another.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,LordAdmNelson,4.35,"A- Motor oil black... very viscous. Thin milk chocolate head forms, fades relatively quickly, but laces nicely.  S- An array of dark chocolate, sweet malt, molasses, some coffee, and maybe some leafy hops. Not too aromatic, but really nice.  T- Big chocolate and coffee notes, roasted malt, moves into some slightly citrus and leafy hops. Alcohol is barely noticeable. Aftertaste is lingering, a blend of chocolate and herbal notes. Delicious. Definitely a good stout, although I'm not sure it absolutely outstrips Expedition or Storm King or Yeti. Good stuff. Hops are definitely more prominent in this one than others, and I like that (I'm a huge fan of fresh FFF Black Sun Stout). Good blending of flavors.  M- Intensely smooth and creamy. Thick. Perfect carbonation.  D- Delicious brew that is worth seeking out. I really enjoy this one. Thanks to alleykatking for this one!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ClevoPiwo,4.12,"Surprised to see an imperial stout in a can, I entered this tasting with some hesitation but was left very pleasantly surprised.  Poured into a snifter, the color was an opaque black with a tan/coffee colored head about a finger's width that dissipated with some spotty lacing - already very surprised at the viscosity and great appearance of this beer.  The smell was good, also. Roasted malt, a hint of coffee and chocolate, etc. Also a bit of alcohol present in the aroma.  The taste left me pleasantly surprised, not sure what the deal with the can is, but this imperial stout was just as good if not better than most I've had out of bombers. Smooth up front with roasted malt and chocolate and a hint of coffee that faded into a lingering bitterness that finished pretty well. Alcohol was also present in the taste and became more pronounced as the beer warmed.  Overall, a very good imperial stout - I wish we got this in Ohio, will definitely be on the lookout for it in the future.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,scottyshades,4.7,"""this dog'll hunt."" -Side of the can  Thanks to Vasdef42 for this extra!! Beer karma coming your way.  A: Pours a pitch black color that produces a deep, rich, ruby- truly evil looking head that reaches four fingers. Lacing is cathedral effect along the glass. This is perhaps the most beautiful/ ominous looking brew I've ever seen! A masterpiece  S: Burnt malts, chocolate malts, toasted barley, tons of hops (98 IBUs!), bitter sweet chocolate, molasses, and a smokey note that lingers. A king! (or should I say czar)  T: Super hoppy! Tons of chocolate, coffee, molasses, and some alcohol as the temperature warms. I must say, I am not a huge fan of super hoppy RIS's, but this one has changed my perception. Perfectly balanced.  MF/D: Very velvety, chewy, oily, with the consistency of motor oil. A little bitter to finish, but nicely balanced.  I must say, it is easy to pass these stupid, cheap looking cans when you are beer hunting if you aren't familiar with OB, but ALL of their beers are extremely delicious and I think the cans add charm and personality to their products! Well done!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,CheckMate,4.82,"12 oz can from Oskar's first batch obtained at the Liquor Shoppe in Tyngsboro, MA. Pours a nice Ebony color with a half inch of coffee brown head. Smells of chocolate hits the nose nicely, smells almost like a Hershey's Kiss. Roasted chocolate malts plays on the palate quite nicely and no hint of alcohol on the tongue, surprisingly. leaves a hint of chocolate in the aftertaste but isn't overly powerful. moderate carbonation. not a sipper, but i wouldn't recommend drinking it too fast, it will definitely hit you later, IMO. Overall, a very yummy beer.  Cheers!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JohnQVegas,4.1,"Can into snifter (from notes).  Pours pitch black, no real head, just a tan ring around the outside of the glass, with noticeable lacing. A bit of a sensory disconnect seeing something this thick pour out of a can.  Aroma is cocoa, big coffee, rich and sweet.  Taste is dark chocolate and huge espresso up front, big and smooth. Finish is dry and bitter, green hops and a noticeable hit of acidity paired with a big espresso bitterness that sticks around. Just a bit hoppy for me.  Palate is one of the thickest I've experienced, creamy and smooth with very subtle carbonation.  Drinkability suffers a bit from the pure size and intensity of the beer, and from how green (and prominent) the hops are.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MbpBugeye,4.63,"This one another awesome surprise extra I got from xpimptastikx. Poured into a snifter.  A- After a pretty viscous pour a thin DARK reddish brown head rises then falls leaving nothing but a ring. This head is the darkest Ive seen. Its almost as dark as some porters! Ten FIDY is the typical opaque pitch black, the only thing about the appearance that's one of a kind is that dark head.  S- Waiting for this to warm really helps awaken the nose. Slight alcohol, sweetness and cocoa powderyness.  T- Really exceptional flavors here. Bitter-sweet cocoa, dark and roasted maltiness, and a lovely creamy/milkiness. Alcohol is barely present.  M- Ive heard great things about the mouth feel here. Mainly that its really really heavy and thick. In that department I was let down a little bit. I think mainly because of the hype. But thats not to say the mouthfeel on Ten FIDY isnt amazing. The carbonation is very low. The MF is similar to a creamy whole milk. Its liquid velvet. So nice!  D- Its taking all my strength to not chug this all down right away. Its so good! Alcohol is barely perceivable. A very very drinkable RIS.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,brokensail,4.3,"A: Black, very viscous. There is about one finger's worth of foam initially, but it quickly disappears.  S: Very chocolaty, excellent malt aroma, vanilla, and a mild coffee scent.  T: Very much like the nose. I get the chocolate, primarily. The vanilla is very subtle here too.  M: Very smooth and full bodied.  D: One of, if not the, easiest drinking Imperial Stout I have come across.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bjacobsen,4.38,"Poured from...well...a can!  A: There is nothing quite like the raven-black pour of an imperial stout. Supports a 1/2 inch beautiful mocha head that dissipates pretty quickly. Not a lot of lacing left in its wake, but definitely some sticky goodness.  A: Really appealing scents of rich dark chocolates, caramel maltiness, coffee sweetened with vanilla creamer. I can't stop sniffing this one.  T: More dark chocolate, strong roasted and dark malt presence, just a touch of heat from the near double-digit ABV. I'm also getting a milky/creamy/vanilla flavor... it's a great balance to the bitter (good bitter) chocolate flavor. The alcohol is present, but seems to just fit with the bold flavor combinations in this one. By no means is it over-powering. As it continues, I'm loving the complex bitter-sweet thing happening here!  M: Medium to thick body...Where it should be.  D: Drinkability is such a catch-22 with double/imperial styles...so I will say that for an imperial stout, it is VERY drinkable. Each time I set it down, my taste buds are prompting me to pick it right back up. I am actually very appreciative of the fact that this comes in 12 oz. cans as I think that is an appropriate serving size. Obviously, this is not a beer to get your session on, but it makes you believe you can.  Overall thoughts: I am partial to a good RIS and have really used AleSmith's Speedway Stout as my basis of comparison for all others. I have read the buzz on Oskar Blues (and this beer in particular) and had to give it a go. What a pleasant surprise...the can, the price, and most importantly, the taste make this one of the most intriguing beers I've had.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,atigerlife,4.5,"A BIG MAHALO to Macktbone & his lovely wife for bringing this amazing offering. Was great to taste with the boys after work....  Pours black. Light brown head that dissipates rather quickly.  Aroma of dark chocolate, soy, sweetness.  Taste is dark chocolate but suprisingly light alcohol given the ABV. Sweetness [marshmallow, chocolate milk, maple syrup] and tons of roasted malts. Some coffee in there. No aftertaste. Truly complex and amazing.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very smooth, creamy. Lightly dry at the end.  Overall, amazing. Drinkability is awesome, even with the ABV. Very, very easy beer to drink.

2681,34483,JohnnyDuvel,4.7,"One of the great beer surprises I've had in quite some time. I had this once a while back, and hadn't seen it since. I found it in an unlikely place and grabbed a four pack. I was so knocked out I went and bought up a case. I have had this head to head with Expedition, Stone, Peche Mortal, and Yeti espresso - and it (at least) held it's own with all of them. Maybe the best balanced stout I have ever had. Pours black as motor oil, with a thin but lasting head. Smells and tastes of coffee (and I mean good coffee!). This beer is so smooth it's dangerous! This may be the biggest sleeper in the beer world (in a can, no less!). Long live Oskar Blues!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Thanks to beandip for this little number!  - Great dark coffee color with a mocha colored head that quickly went down to little bits of drifting mocha lacing... poured in a tumbler, and can't see through it.  - Wonderful sweet chocolate and caramel scent.. heavy butter cream... and creamed coffee latte goodness.. rather sweet.  - Great bitter hop zing with a creamy finish to a chocolate syrup delight... huge bitter chocolate characterlittle bits of caramel and cake frosting.. lol  - Bit bitter dry feel... leaves the mouth watering for more..  - Hugely drinkable... bit sweet but it must be needed to hide its strength so well... a great all around imperial stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,NittanyBeerFan,4.12,"Received from treyrab in the the first tri-monthly beer swap, aka Beer Swap 1.0  A: First, the sound. The can cracks with a light hiss. This is not your ordinary canned beer...as if we didn't know that already though. The last time I saw something like this beer coming out of the can, I was watching 14000 mile old 5W-30 pour out of my engine. Topped by a coarse half centimeter of head that arrives late and disappears quickly. Foamy clusters of bubbles stick to the side of my oversize tulip and slink their way back down into the beer.  S: Not a very intense smell, but as I swirl it, almost like a wine, it starts to rise up from the glass. I get roasted malts, light chocolate, wisps of coffee notes, and some mild scents of warming alcohol.  T: Dark chocolately malts are much stronger than the scent would lead on. Roasted coffee flavors complement it nicely. I can also pick up some caramel and molasses, just to add some character. I like.  M/D: Tingly carbonation and a medium texture, despite the appearance. Remarkably smooth finish, and the undertones of the mild flavors give it a nice complexity. There is a lot to look for in this beer, and it's texture is light enough that it doesn't make you feel full. The alcohol is non-evident.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Onenote81,3.57,"Can received from Kiefdog in a recent trade. Thanks!  Poured into my snifter a very thick black with a thin light brown head on top. Retention is weak, and there is little lacing. Smells of roasted malts and nuts, cocoa beans, and soy sauce.  The mouth is smooth and creamy. I think I started drinking this too chilled as I was getting a wallop of soy sauce and this weird sour note. As the beer warmed more to room temp, I could sense more of the roasted characteristics as well as the deep chocolate. Aftertaste was of Tootsie Rolls. Pretty heavy brew that took awhile to consume. Drinkability was hindered for sure. Not bad, but fell short of the hype.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BamaBeerBuff,4.58,"This can is an 07-early 08 vintage, around a year and a half old.  A: Pours an incredibly deep black color. No light comes through whatsoever. Head is huge, creamy, and dark chocolate colored--one of the darkest heads on a beer that I've seen. Retention is excellent, thick sheets of lace on the glass. Top notch appearance.  S: Loads of fudgy chocolate, some hints of espresso. Vanilla, rum, and molasses all present, as well. The time in the can appears to have eliminated any hop presence in the aroma.  T&M: Begins with bittersweet chocolate that gets increasingly fudgy and sweet. Notes of molasses and espresso creep in, and the finish bitters things out, though not too much. Some lingering piney, earthy, and grassy/herbal hop flavors still remain. Alcohol is utterly undetectable on the finish. This beer is huge in body, with a measured carbonation that's perfect. Velvety smoothness, oil-like consistency--exactly what a Russian Imperial Stout should be.  D: No alcohol in the flavor, and it's like drinking an espresso-brownie beer-shake with some molasses thrown in for good measure. Simply a delightful beer, and I'm glad I've got a couple more cans of it aging.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Roasty dark chocolate, coffee, toast, date, hints of nut, brown sugar, toffee; the slightest hint of alcohol toward the end. Toast, dark chocolate, coffee, and toffee hit the palate right away, with some brown sugar, burnt, dark roasted coffee, toffee nut, and date, along with just the slightest tinge of alcohol warming dominate the exceptionally long finish for this beer. Rich full mouthfeel without being too viscous or syrupy, with light to medium carbonation. While this is definitely a sipper (true to style), one sip most definitely invites another one due to the complexity and tastiness. I am literally floored by this beer. It more than lives up to the hype. Possibly the best RIS I have ever had the pleasure of drinking, this beer is practically perfect in every way. and in a can to boot! Absolutely stellar.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BZero007,3.91,"Picked up a pack from Rick's Wine and Gourmet in Alexandria, VA.  Pours an extremly black color with the outer edges looking see threw brown, reminds you of motor oil. The head formation is a thing of beauty as it forms with out any help. The head formation was great for a RIS and any other brew honestly. Afterwards lace surronds the glass the entire way down. Smell was not very strong and did not contain the strong coffee or chocolate scent. To me it was a very light chocolate aroma, which by no means is bad. First sip is great as for most RIS's in the 10% alcohol range to me are sippers due to the strong flavors. This is a roasty chocolate RIS with a light hint of coffee coming threw in the background. The flavors are not extreme and do not over power your taste buds, which makes it a nice over all drink. The brew is extremely smooth and the alcohol content is almost no where to be noticed. Though once you are done you will feel that 10% sneak up on you.  Great brew that I will continue to stock.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Chocolate unsweetened bakers chocolate, lots of coffee dark fruits smokey notes.  Taste is wow rich thick roasted malts, coffee, chocolate lots of piny hop flavors that linger through to the finish. This is one hoppy stout but doesn't seem over done as lots of roasted malt goodness to back it up. Some smoke notes along with chewy dates and tobacco leafs.

2681,34483,tgdigital,4.6,"This is a big beer. Pours engine oil black into a glass with a dark brown head. Loads of roasted malt presence in the smell with some hoppiness to balance. The taste is filled with hints of chocolate, vanilla, toffee, caramel, coffee, and toasted grain. The residual sweetness is balanced by the bitterness of roasted grain and hop character. Thick and full bodied in the mouth. This is a fantastic stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,mhatters,4.42,"Poured from a can into a 10oz tulip glass at TDR, Exton  Pours an oily black with a thin light brown head  Roasted notes in the nose, coffee, malt, and chocolate - very appetizing  The chocolate comes through in the flavor. Creamy and slightly bitter rolling nicely into the coffee. A dark sweetness subdues the bitterness at the end. Very impressive  Thick, creamy, and lovely.  Easy to drink, the alcohol is well hidden and all the component flavors are balanced and in synch.  Love it",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,IMincedTheKing,3.51,"Pours a sludgy, viscous black with a 1/4 inch film of ruby-brown head. Like frothy motor oil--a strange combination of impressive and disgusting.  Roasted malts overwhelm the nose. It's very dark with some subtle hints of fruit and coffee.  Thick and chewy in the mouth with roasted malts standing above all else. Hints of dark fruits sneak through. Juicy on the finish with a lingering hoppiness.  This beer's too big for it's own good, and I find it rather boring. Not something I'll be running back to.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,gregmurer,2.82,"Appearance - incredible appearance, sure it's an imperial stout, but, the head is totally dark like the beer itself...  Smell - It smell like something burnt... no issue, it's full of chocolate malt, heavy smell, but a bit frightning...  Taste - bitterness is not really present, it's totally hidden by the roasted barley or malts, for sure it taste something... too much i may say.  Mouthfeel - it really feel thick, too thick, it's incredibly long and tastefull.  Drinkability - certainly not drinkable, take a 33cc can for 2 or 3 friends, it's too much heavy in mouth, not refreshing at all (even from the fridge).",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SShelly,4.08,"Pours a dark black with low dark head that dissapears quick.  Light roast aroma with some chocolate, some sweet malt aromas, no esters, well maybe a little something fruity but barely there.  Initial sweet malt flavor gives way to a little dark roast, medium creamy, little to no hop flavor, a little bit of bitterness that lingers on the tongue, no big flavors in this...Sweetness lingers on the pallet for a few minutes after a sip. Light alcohol warming through the chest, very minimal.  overall a decent beer, probably a tad overhyped, doesnt rank in my top 5 of RIS's but drinkable none the less.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,stephens101,4.35,"Pours impenetrable blackness like a Rimbaud poem. A very dark tan head covers the abyss and fades quickly with little lacing left behind. Various aromas of deep dark chocolate, charred wood, licorice, roasted nuts, pine and even honey waft to the nose. Sweet chocolate and caramel reach the tongue first, followed by some spice, a nice hit of hops, more dark chocolates, some alcohol heat, roasted malts and vanilla extract. The aforementioned alcohol heat lingers for a while, but is not bothersome. The creamy smoothness is second to none going down; almost dessert-like, and while the body of this brew leans toward heavy, it doesn't weigh on you like some stouts can. A rich complex brew that goes great by itself, but would pair well with a great meal, and that is coming from one who usually gives a rat's ass about beer pairing with food.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,rayjay,3.84,"Crazy viscosity which is evident from the pour, pretty cool seeing that come out of a can into my Delirium Noel goblet. Dark head that looks like a coffee stained shirt.  Good aroma, a bit of cooked veggies and dumpster funk, but over-ridden by deep roasted malt, roasted barley, and molasses. These green overcooked veggies lend a freezer burnt note to the aroma...acceptable but questionable. I'm torn because i detect many defects but it still smells pretty good.  Flavor is creamy and roasted, almost like burnt curry. Lots of esters combined with the roasted grain lend a sort of burnt fruit flavor. Background hops for he style, but they add a nice bitter backdrop along with the black malts and barley.  Excellent mouthfeel, lots of creamyness and a nice velvety texture. Very enjoyable.  Delicious and drinkable, although it will slow you down. Cheers!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Hints of chocolate, and coffee  T: Very malty flavor. Full of chocolate, carmel, sweet cream, and a hint of tobacco. Subtle hop finish. Incredibly balanced beer.  M: Wow, the texture of this beer is amazing. It's so smooth and creamy.  D: Although this beer is exceptional, I can't drink more than one of these.

2681,34483,BeTheBall,4.22,"Poured a deep dark opaque black to brown, deep as night. Frothy and lively head and lacing. Smell was huge chocolate and roasted malt. Taste was also chocolate and roasted flavors with a hint of alcohol hotness, in a good way. Mouthfeel was rich and creamy all the way down. Drinkability is limited for me, very rich and very strong with the ABV. More than one I wouldn't probably do, but that one is awesome.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,damienblack,4.35,"Pours to the typical RIS appearance, dark brown/black, thick and syrupy. Small tan head, decent lacing, typical appearance. Smell is typical too, slightly sweet dark malt. But the taste sensation is where it really kicks in. Overall, it encompasses a very nice balance. Some roastiness yet not too roasty, but not to sweet either. The thing that really puts it over the top is how creamy it is. Just silk-like in its delicacy. No bitterness at all. Just a bit of hop balance at the end, but nowhere near as hoppy as I've heard. Mouthfeel excels because of this, the perfect level of coating. Super drinkable for the ABV and subject matter. Forget Rasputin, this has become my favorite of the sessionable imperial stouts!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SuperSpy,4.1,"Poured this one into a pint glass and it looks as black as tar. Even when held up to the light I can't make out anything but BLACK. The head is thick, creamy and is darker than chocolate milk. As the head finally starts to die down it leaves a ton of lace.  I'm smelling some sweet chocolate, a hint of molasses, but I really had to hunt for those. Considering the look of this beer I am disappointed by the lack of punch in the aroma. Considering just the style I would expect to be smelling more. Even as the beer warms there is still little to nothing in the smell. Perhaps I just got a bad can because I'm not getting any of the aromas I'm seeing in the other reviews.  This beer is definitely full-bodied and full flavored. I am tasting the dark chocolate and molasses that were only hinted at in the aroma, but I'm also getting coffee, dark fruits and a slight alcohol warmth as it goes down. I'm actually surprised at the lack of alcohol flavor and burn considering the ABV on this thing. I could drink plenty more of these. This beer goes down really, really well and I don't know that the wonderfully creamy smoothness could be improved on, or that anyone should even try.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,sgoodship,4.26,"Picked this up in Steve's Liquors in Madison. Great place to buy beer and make your own 6.  A: Poured from a can, this is some dark, viscous stuff right here. The color is oil black. No light gets through it. It popped up a lovely 2 finger head. The head was craggy and dark golden brown - one of the darkest heads I have seen in quite some time. It's a shamelessly handsome looking brew.  S: Massive roasted grains and coffee. There's a sweet chocolate and a hint of booze. There's a bitterness there but it's hard to pick out hop profile in the onslaught of the malt.  T: I'm going to keep this simple for yah. Lovely! There ya go. It's everything that the smell promises except to mention how well masked the alcohol is and how amazingly well balanced it is.  M: Thick and smooth. Really great mouth. Full bodied beer with low carbonation.  D: The one critical thing I could say about this beer is that the taste isn't amazingly distinctive or complex. If you want a knock it out of the park RIS that is super well balanced, look no further but it is not going to challenge or surprise you. Don't get me wrong, this beer is easily going to one of the top spots on my RIS list.

2681,34483,Georgiabeer,4.7,"Pours an oily, viscous black with probably the darkest head I've ever seen on a beer- morethe color of espresso than crema. The head seems to fade a bit quicker than on the draft version. On the nose are notes of fine, vinous chocolate, a deep roastiness, and long bitterness with hints of coffee waftinf in and out. Very nice. The flavor is a knock-out. Big flavors of bitter chocolate, espresso, a massive roastiness, long complex vinous notes and a gritty cocoa powder finish. Just magnificent. Huge mouthfeel, a bit grittier than on tap- it lacks a little of the creaminess of the beer served that way, but huge, with a bitter and vinous finish that goes on for a long time. Just as delightful as the first time I had this. Wonderful stuff, and my absolute favorite beverage for a winter camping trip.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,kimcgolf,3.68,"Out of the can at Leon's. Poured a thick, syrupy jet-black with a skim of a brown head that dissipated quickly and left little lacing. Aroma is a strong malty-choclate-toffee-coffee that hits the nose immdiately. The 9.4% ABV works its way into the nose at mid-glass. Mouthfeel is thick (too much for my liking) and syrupy. Taste, while reflecting the scents found in the nose, is somewhat overwhelmed by the syrupy sweetness. Finish is long, but somewhat like glue stuck inside your mouth.  Summary, while I can taste the quality, I just can't get as fired up as most for this carbonated chocolate syrup.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A- Pours a thick, rich, black, and completely opaque. _1/2 fingers of brown head, which settles quickly into a thin ring of foam, and an incomplete, oily island.  S- Molasses, roasted malts, coffee, anise infused sweetness, hints of dark fruits and alcohol. Quite excellent.  T- ""Robust"" is the first thing that comes to mind. Lots of what the nose made me expect; molasses sweetness, and roasty malts and coffee. Hints of alcohol bitterness builds as consumed.  M- Moderately low carbonation. Thick and full....smooth....the way I want a RIS to feel.  D- A fab slow sipper, and quite smooth and easy drinking considering it's 10 % ABV ....  Future outlook: Quite worthy of it's high ratings.

2681,34483,beveritt,4.7,"Presentation: Poured from a 12 oz can into a Duvel tulip. Thanks to DoctorDog for hooking me up with this not so little gem. Can is black and silver with the image of the sun rising over a mountain. Bottled on 10-30-08 printed on the bottom along with the cryptic phrase ""Who does #2 work for?""  Appearance: Looks like pouring motor oil in to a glass. Pours with just under 1 finger of dark brown head. This settles slowly, eventually dropping to a ring around the glass and a small island of foam above the nucleation site. The beet itself is black, completely and absolutely black. No sediment remains in the can.  Smell: Rich, sweet malt aroma with hints of molasses, figs, and tobacco. Alcohol is present in the finish.  Taste: Building flavor upfront, comes at you gradually rather than suddenly assaulting the taste buds. Strong flavors of licorice, molasses, and dark candi sugar. Alcohol is hidden very well, considering the 10.0 % ABV, but is barley discernible in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Slightly lower than average carbonation level, as expected for this style. Body is incredibly thick and clinging.  Drinkability: A wonderful sipper, too bad it doesn't make it to Ohio.

2681,34483,kels,4.13,"Thanks to the amazing cmitchell for passing a can of this off to bamadog. We shared it the other night for our collective 100th review.  Appearance: Pours rich chocolate brown, almost black, with the slightest ruby highlights, mostly showing in the ring of tannish head that barely retains. Some spotty lacing dots the glass just above the liquid that's dark and viscous. A mild oil slick sits atop the beer, and little bubbles burst up through the surface now and again.  Smell: Smell is full and robust - tons of nicely dry dark roast malts and chewy graininess. Slight bitterness from either a bittersweet chocolate or dark coffee comes through, along with some alcohol heat.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The feel is well carbonated and somewhat gritty, not as viscous as it looks - moderate mouthfeel. The taste is full of bitter roasty, charred malts that are coffee-like in taste. There is the slightest hint of vanilla-like sweetness to accompany bright, appley hops in the aftertaste. Moderately warming alcohol finishes it.  Drinkability: Moderate at best.

Poured from a can into a stemless wine glass. This beer is pitch black with a two finger mocha head. Lots of stamina on the lacing as it slowly courses down the sides of the glass.  The smell is roasty malts, coffee, bitter chocolate and some sweet vanilla, very nice.  This beer tastes just like it smells, awesome roasty malts and bitter chocolate with a nice hoppy balance. I love imperial stouts that start with roasty malt that blends into a nice hoppiness.  This beer is thick and syrupy, but hides the alcohol well and tastes very smooth.

Split the can with Kels for her 100th as well. Poured from the can into a snifter.  Appearance: Poured thick, black and viscous like motor oil; no head at all except for when it's swirled especially hard and then there is a very deep tan thin layer that floats like oil on top of a mud puddle; very spotty lacing clings to the sides on the swirl as well and there is an interesting ring/band if it sits for a bit and I tip it for a sip.  Smell: Deep roasted malts; sweet chocolatey presence; a slightly smokey/woody presence; faint whiff of alcohol; very faint bitter hoppy prersence somewhere in there as well...  Taste: Wow. Long roasted malty goodness comes out; a little coffee-esque and also some sweet chocolate; slight presence of alcohol and like in the scent, a mild hop presence as well. A very amazing and wonderful tasting stout. The aftertaste is very much like roast coffee.  Mouthfeel: Amazingly thick and creamy; coats the mouth heavily; gums are a little tingly from the alcohol; pretty thick so not a ton of carbonation bubbling throughout so I'm assuming the tingling is from the alcohol; feels a little gritty as well.  Drinkability: Pretty high for a big heavy stout - I would have enjoyed an entire one to myself, but it's always better to share.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,Trappissed,2.96,"I don't have a whole lot of experience with imperial stouts, but I will say this one reminded me a lot of drinking a Baltic Porter(i.e. Okocim and Zywiec). Very similar sweetness, that I don't actually enjoy very much. Its true the alcohol is hidden pretty well, but the taste just isn't doing it for me. Very nice appearance with a nice tan head. In the flavor, I was getting a little fruity nuttiness. A little roasted chocolate taste as well. Just overly sweet in my opinion.  Would make a nice dessert beer either paired, or by itself as it is a pretty heavy brew. As someone else mentioned, I just wish they could have gotten a little more hops in this, and toned down the sweetness, or something to balance it out a little more. Mouthfeel had a nice quality, definitely appropriate for the style. However the taste and drinkability were lacking; those are kind of important. I know this is a sipper, but I will go as far to say that this was cloyingly sweet.  Obviously I am in the minority here, seeing all these other reviews.

The head showed great retention and just looked like a puffy goose-down pillow.  Smell - This is my favorite type of RIP profile. The roasted malts are there but very faint. The big aroma is that stiff brown sugar on toast with butter washed down with a cool cup of cocoa.  Taste - The wonderful sweetness from the nose comes over at the taste with a perfect step up from the roasted malts. There is a very mild and pleasant burnt flavor that does a terrific job of lightly cutting the big sugars. The finish is all roasty malt just the way I like it.  Mouthfeel - This is bigger than medium-bodied but I wouldn't call it full. The bitterness is not shy but doesn't overpower. There's a light tinge of alcohol in the middle with a tick up in the bitter department at the end. There's some decent carbonation in here as well which I usually don't find much of in the style but here it seems right at home.

2681,34483,connecticutpoet,4.32,"Very dark brown, clear brew with a thin, dark brown head on the pour. Flows like oil.  Aroma is of pumpernickel bread, dark roasted malts, raisins, and hints of cherries. Complex and layered. No coffee odors, but definite roasted grains.  Taste is of strong dark malt, slightly bitter, roasted character played down and well balanced.  Mouthfeel is smooth, full, rich, and chewy.  Drinkability is good.

While this certainly isn't my favorite RIS, it has worked to turn me off to the irrational fear of canned beer that I still maintain (I'm sure Surly would have done this long ago were we able to get their canned beers in Chicago instead of having everything on tap.)  A: Very dark black with a good brown head.  S: Some chocolate notes along with some hops and roasted malt. A tad bit weak.  T: Roasted malt and some chocolate underneath some hops. Much like the nose, but a little bit more there.  M: Full-bodied and slightly dry.  D: Pretty good, but this one fails in comparison to the truly great RIS's.

Tastes of nice roasted malts, molasses, alcohol and some sweetness from the malt. Low carbonation and very thick making it nice and smooth.

2681,34483,jminsc76,4.3,"Had this in a tulip while relaxing at home. Pours a large brownish/mahogany head atop an impenetrable black body. The head is creamy but not thick and foamy. Excellent legs but decent lacing down the side. Visuals are better upon the initial pour.  Aromas of molasses and coffee at first, and subsequent cocoa, molasses, and coffee with a little agitation. Also very fruity - mainly berries such as raspberry and strawberry - that exhibit a high degree of sweetness. Nothing that burns the nose hairs off, but its impressive.  A sip yields more molasses and fruity flavors (very similar to the smell), and a quaff yields more coffee, chocolate, espresso, and slight bitterness from the hops. It's not a punch to the palate, and I don't taste as much of the complexity, fullness, or refinement found in some of the other high quality Russian Imperial Stouts, but the plethora of flavors as I continue sipping and quaffing is so various and intense I could drink at least three more of these in one sitting. Considering its 9.5% ABV per can, however, I would probably be rolling on the floor spouting incoherent ecstasies and nursing one hell of a headache the next day.  So I'll stick with two per sitting and spout more coherent ecstasies. Great beer overall, with an A- for the mouthfeel due to the easy consistency on the palate, with the high ABV nowhere to be found in the flavors.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

I have been wanting to try my first ever imperial stout from a can, so here it goes:  A: Pitch black with a nice creamy dark brown head. Head sticks around throughout. Coats the glass.  S: a very sweet and roasty smell, some notes of chocolate. This smells delicious.  T: Wow, the taste is amazing. There is a perfect harmony of malted sweetness balanced with roasted notes. The finish is chocolate and sweet. I would say this is a little on the sweet side for imperial stouts, but it works so well with this beer. The 9.5 % alcohol is very well masked.  M: A nice velvety smooth feel with low carbonation. This beer is very thick which is perfect for the flavor.  D: I really wish this beer was more readily available for me, this is an excellent imperial stout. I have yet to be disappointed by a craft beer in a can. This is one of my favorite imperial stouts.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,chsanders,4.83,I was very impressed with this beer. It met every expectation that I had from things I've heard on different podcasts over the past year or so. It has just taken this long to get my hands on some. I love this beer and will sing its praises to anyone who will listen.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bowersdm,4.72,"12oz can poured into a nonic. thanks to ScreamForMe for including this as an extra.  A - typical RIS black with a halo of carbonation forming on the beer's meniscus.  S - roasted barley, chocolate, coffee, a bourbon smell with oak, tobacco, and plenty of oak, a slightly smoky, charred flavor which I wasn't sure whether it was due to the bourbon/oak or to some charred barley.  T - roasted barley, dark chocolate, alcohol, oak, solvent-like alcohol combining with the oak produce a distinctly barrel aged flavor. further notes of molasses and anise as the beer warms. caramel?  M - thick. oh my god thick with a viscosity reminiscent of oil. low carbonation further makes this beer seem thick and honestly, chewy. I could feel it sliding down my throat...or, perhaps ""oozing"" would be a better word.  D - amazing beer. best mouthfeel for any of the RISs that I've had. one to seek out and stockpile.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,Pudge43,4.65,"Let me start by saying thanks to my man Aaron (PerzentRizen) for my first Ten Fidy. This is the BEST CAN of beer that I have ever had! This is definitely not your typical can beer. Pop the top and out pours black liquid that looks like ""motor oil"" according to my wonderful wife. No head rises whatsoever on this baby. Strong malts smell but a hint of hops in there as well. Molasses, carmel and alcohol (9.5%) smack you right in the face. The burnt carmel flavor takes over from there and coats your mouth. The aftertaste lingers for quite some time. I love my stouts and this is definitely right up there with the best of them. This is extremely smooth but more than one or two in a sitting would be tough to handle.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,morimech,4.51,"Pours dark black with a thick looking body. Just a very small head that quickly goes away. Very little lacing is left on the glass. Not that great looking RIS. The aroma however is very pleasing. Dark, roasted malt, dark fruit, and coffee. Has a bittersweet quality. Nice roasted malt flavor. Again it has a bittersweet quality. Hops make their presence known. Alcohol warming in the finish and it helps to cleanse the palate without dominating the flavor. Thick and rich body. Just enough carbonation to liven up the body. One of the better tasting RIS I have had.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BuffaloTapHugger,3.98,"Poured 12 ounce can into a small tumbler. Like a can of oil out of the can, a small caramel colored head and some very stellar lacing. Smells of sweet roasted malts, some chocolate, coffee notes, and earthy tones. Taste is a bitter/sweet blend of robust coffee, some of that there chocolate, nice sweet malts and some nice hop to pop at the end. The beer is thick, its real chewy and has a bite like no other. ABV very noticeable, but the fullness of the beer has know problem telling you about it. Unfortunately its a sipper, but if you like slugging barium this is the beer for you. It's phenomenal overall, just takes a lot of devoted time to consume, (chuckles). Been dying to try this one, glad that I did but would probably pick another RIS if confronted again.  ""It should have been you, Gordon""....  is next",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,hardy008,4.73,"Appearance - Dark black, no light passes through. Pours a dark tan foamy one finger head with nice retention.  Smell - Strong aroma of malt and chocolate, with some molasses. Very impressive.  Taste - Malt, chocolate, molasses, with a little coffee bitterness. Strong alcohol presence. Outstanding.  Mouthfeel - Rich and creamy, full bodied and the right amount of carbonation.  Drink - Very drinkable, this is an outstanding RIS.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,drcarver,4.3,"Starting with what may seem like a downer, it comes in a can, but this ain't your typical can beer. A dull pop from the can signifies that its open (it understands itself enough to not release any pretentious fizz). Out of it pours a liquid with the same color and consistency of motor oil that sat in your engine two years too long. Nearly no head rises to the surface, but a few dark brown bubbles cling to the surface.  The smell of the malts is strong, but there is a hint of hops. Caramel/Molasses, soy sauce, and alcohol (9.5%) are predominent, but a slight pine aroma is hidden in there. The flavors of burnt caramel and soy sauce cover the entire mouth and soak into the tongue. The sweet, pungent aftertaste lingers.  The drink is smooth and soft, but leaves a bit on your tongue. I am a dark beer fan and this is DEFINITELY a fun beer. It goes down smooth but in no way would I be able to have more than two.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,snpub540,4.52,"Poured a deep opaque black with a tiny chocolate brown head that left almost no lacing.  Smells were amazing. Could pick up up raisins, prunes, chocolate and coffee. Very sweet and inviting.  First swig had very vinous qualities, followed by a very pleasant roasted flavor. Coffee and dried fruit flavor is definately there as well as a sweet alcohol finish.  Mouthfeel was almost velvety in texture and it went down smooth and not all harsh. The 10% alcohol is definately there and does not keep itself hidden. A very good beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,teamizm,4.36,"A - Dark as the darkest nights S - Bitter chocolate with some dark, sweet fruits T - Nice hit of initial chocolate sweetness with a back end of mild bitterness. Very very pleasing to the palette M - It's a little less viscous than I would have expected or liked, but still, no real complaints here D - Man, i can't believe this baby is 10%. Even as it warms the alcohol still seems pretty well masked. O - Thank you to whomever for finally bringing Ten FIDY to California. This is a great go-to RIS. Probably best canned beer I've ever had. Can you imagine tail gating at a baseball game with a cooler of these bad boys?!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,cdViking,4.2,"Consumed in a can, at home.  Pour is the darkest of darks, color looks absolutely amazing, with minimal head that disappears after a short period of time. Smells like sweet roasted coffee with chocolate undertones. Taste is amazing: wonderful chocolate and coffee taste, with sweet dark fruit back there as well. Perhaps the richest beer I've ever tried. The mouthfeel is the best part of this drink. It is a silky smooth, and a tremendous treat going down. While I had no problem sipping what I opened and completing it, I could not see myself having more than one of these in an evening: each can is pretty much a dessert, and much like a sundae, consuming multiple would be overkill.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,washburnkid,4.05,"Enjoyed in a snifter.  A: Thick black liquid with a dark brown head, one of the darkest I've seen. Head retains as a tiny ring and there's a decent amount of lacing, though I'd love to see a little more activity on my snifter. S: Huge malt aromas complete with bitter chocolate and dark fruits. I get a small brine sense, but it's not so overpowering that I couldn't enjoy the aromas. T/M: Viscous and chewy mouthfeel with a backbone of bitter dark chocolate and dark berries. Hop balance at the back of the sip. There's a slight metallic note that hovers over the flavors but is not overpowering and eventually fades. As the brew warms, it takes on a mild toasted flavor, which is nice. The flavors overall are pretty subtle, without any one characteristic dominating over the others. D: This is definitely a sipper. I had a warmed chocolate chip cookie and mocha java ice cream to pair. I look forward to trying more from Oskar Blues.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,kbutler1,4.33,"Served from a can, batch was canned on 12/31/08. Serving temperature was 46 degrees. Poured into a tulip glass. Appearance: You'd think you are pouring motor oil from the can on this one! Inky black with dark red hued tan head. Smell: More mild smelling that I would have imagined. Pick up some sweetness to it. Taste: Sweet turning to bitter on the tongue. Dark roast coffee after taste mixed with cocoa. Mouthfeel: Heavy mouthfeel Drinkability: Very drinkable. Alcohol is well masked on this one.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Kromes,4.03,"Pours black hole black. Very thin dark brown head. Smells like alcohol and sweet fruity burnt coffee. The initial taste is of sweet alcohol mixed with a candylike fruity hop flavor. Very sweet and candylike, almost too sweet. Then comes an extremely strong burnt coffee flavor that lingers along with alcohol and bitterness in the aftertaste. This is a very strong beer. Definitely a sipper. It burned all the way down and I think it is burning a hole in my stomach right now. A heavier mouthfeel to this one. As the beer warmed up, the fruity hop flavor became more apparent and the burnt coffee flavor died down a little.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,rwrk42,4.13,"Pours dark black with a nice tan head. Smell: Roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. A nice sweet smell Taste: Immediate sweet taste of chocolate, roasted malts and coffee. On the sweeter side and not much hop influence. A very nice Stout which I would recommend",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bonkers,4.05,"I poured from a 12 ounce can into a standard pint glass. It pours pitch black with a 1 finger tan head. A bit of tan lacing is left. The aroma is coffee and chocolate. The flavor is pleasantly bitter and has notes of coffee and chocalate, with the faintest hint of sweetness. The beer is full bodied, adequete carbonation and has a pleasing creamy mouth feel. The brew is meant to be sipped. A solid RIS, but a bit overhyped.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,squaremile,3.9,"Observables: very dark black oily pour, maybe the thickest beer I've ever seen, GIBCS is close. The defining characteristic of the beer to me is the sweetness, which limits it's drinkability. It leaves a coating on the glass and your mouth, and has a looong after-taste. There is no balance at all and its the most syrupy/sugary beer I've ever had.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,tr4nc3d,3.72,"Pours a dark black color with tan head.  Smell is of roasted malts, molasses, coffee beans  Taste is just like the smell with a little more burnt coffee taste then I expected.  Mouthfeel is heavy and creamy with slight alcohol taste.

2681,34483,theghost3,4.23,"Pours deep brown, almost black with a creamy light brown head. Lots of lacing.  The smell is strong of dark chocolate, roasted malts, molasses & alcohol.

However, it's a little more bitter than I like.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,tronester,3.93,"Pours a pitch black with a creamy, tan head. Lacing sticks to the side of the glass all the way through. Smells of honey and toasted bread. Taste is richly malty, with a smooth roasted bitterness in the middle. The finish is lightly bitter, with a hint of earthy hops. The finish is also slightly metallic likely from the high alcohol levels. Mouthfeel is smooth, very rich, with nice carbonation levels. Drinkability is pretty good, being 10 percent abv makes it tough to drink more than one can at a time. Not my favorite RIS, but a very good beer, and definitely worth a shot for lovers of the style.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ZAP,4.42,"A-Black with ruby highlights...looks the part.  S-Awesome aroma of top quality chocolate starts things off...then a little Bailey's Irish Cream notes....caramel...the more I smell this the more of the Irish Creme Coffee notes but light on the java...also some plums, and raisins....really a great smelling beer.  T-Dark unsweetened chocolate....charred raisins...licorice...good amount of pure hop bitterness....a lit bit like Rogue IS in the hopping....some alcohol is flexing its muscles and is quite evident....exudes what you'd expect from an Impy..  M-Rich, and full bodied..velvety..  D-Damn nice Impy that ranks on the top tier...I like a couple others better than this but that is no knock on this beer because there are really some kick ass impy's being made these days...A must try if you like this style..",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,dukedevil0,4.5,"Big thanks to Dajtai007 for this single can as an extra in our recent trade!  A: Pours a DARK black used motor oil color out of the can with a bunch of frothy chocolate milk colored head, lots of lacing on the glass.  S: Usual RIS scents here, roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee...and i pick up some bread in there too  T: Wow, I was really surprised here. The tastes are like the scents, but it's almost got more milk chocolate in there and if this were a blind tasting, I would have told you it may be bourbon barrel aged. This is a great tasting RIS.  M: The mouthfeel is great in this brew, full and creamy with a great amount of carbonation  D: Totally drinkable, the fact that this RIS isn't as ""burnt"" or ""bitter"" as some others I think it really helps the drinkability factor.  I need to find and keep a little stockpile of this to have around!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Richardberg,3.35,"A: poured from a can into a stemless wine glass. Very thick black liquid. No head, although you can tell there's a decent amount of carbonation.  S: black coffee, molasses  T: bitter chocolate, black coffee, molasses (but not at all sweet). The flavors are not simple per se, but they are all definitely on the bitter side of the spectrum. Alky bite is very present.  M: nice oily feel with ample carbonation to keep things interesting  D: 10% ABV is not at all hidden. Definitely a sipping beer -- which is fine, but I'm not sure I'd want to sip an entire can of this rather one sided brew, much less another.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

It is a complex sipping beer. One of my favorites in the style, but not quite there...A very very good beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,NiceGuyMike,3.5,"By far the darkest beer I ever poured from a can. Pours with a viscous yet thin tan head which is expected of an RIS. However the head disperses rather quick. Smells of wonder full chocolate malts with a hint of alcohol. As the head reduces so does the scent.  Wow...what a mouth feel. Supper smooth and thick like a shake. Strong alcohol flavor. Nice chocolate malt. Aside from that it doesn't stand out. Odd after taste.  This one is a sipper to be sure. I'm not wanting more.  I was sure this was going to be a slam dunk after pouring and smelling. The taste, although not bad, was simply average. Nicest mouth feel I can remember. I have two more cans of this so I'll try again another day.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Gyle41386,4.58,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass.  Pours the blackest black I think I've ever seen. Rich, brown chocolate head. Great lacing. Perfect.  Big nose here. Loads of roasted malts and chocolate. Big coffee scent with underlying hop bitterness.  The taste is damn near perfect. Bittersweet chocolate, deep roasted coffee beans. Dark fruits and molasses. Love the hops in this one.  The mouthfeel is incredible. Silky smooth. Rich, rich, rich. Viscous body, appropriately low carbonation. Never-ending finish, coats the entire mouth, leaves you absolutely BEGGING for more. Nice alcoholic warming sensation kindly reminds you to slow down. This one is definitely a sipper, but it's so perfect you can't help but keep going back for another sip.  This is an amazing Russian Imperial Stout. Not really a whole lot else to say. I'm almost ashamed of myself for not buying some sooner.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BarrelO,3.88,"12oz can poured into a goblet. Review from notes from a few days ago.  A: Black. A vigours pour creates a sizable head that leaves lots of lacing.  S: Coffee, licorice, soy sauce, alcohol, some chocolate.  T: Major coffee roastiness with hints of bittersweet chocolate. No trace of alcohol, but there is a bit of an off metallic flavor. Finishes with strong hop bitterness.  M: Thick and creamy, the way God intended imperial stouts to be.  D: The best beer to come from a can? I'd say so...for what that's worth.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jwhawkins81,4.45,"Aroma - Malty roasted goodness. Nutty. God this is good.  Appearance - Dark motor oil that has a resilent light brown head  Taste - Surprisingly unoffensive (yeah that is what I first thought). Not knock down drag out good, but has an awesome lingering roastiness, some cherry, well balanced. Just a solid solid imperial stout.  Mouthfeel - Surprisingly thin  Drinkability - Way too drinkable for 9.5% ABV (It said so on the can)  This would be in the running for my regular RIS if it was available in Ohio.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,alcstradamus,4.08,"A--Pours out of the can so thick it almost makes you wonder if it is going to clog the opening. Nice finger of dark brown head. No lacing.  S--Bourbon, caramel, milk chocolate. Nothing is jumping out at me too much, a very pleasant scent but not a very powerful one. I'm picking up caramel more than anything  T--Fairly complex and extremely well balanced. Vanilla, roasted malt, hints of dark fruit, chocolate. Nothing really jumps out and makes me say ""wow"" but it is overall very good.  M--Creamy as hell. Carbonation is minimal and is only felt on the back of my throat.  D--A nice easy drinker consider the size of this puppy. A top quality ""everyday"" stout.  Overall this beer is definitely deserving of its status. It could use some improvement to really make my palate happy, but I was pleased.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ibbjamin,3.65,"Picked up a four pack of 12oz cans from Healthy Spirits in San Francisco, CA. Poured into a small snifter.  I feel like I am pouring a can of motor oil with this brew. Out of a can and nice, thick and black. Quarter inch dark tan head after an aggressive pour. Minimal carbonation.  Nose is pretty heavy. Alcohol is pretty well hidden for a 10% abv. Sweet roasted malts, some raisin and molasses. Quality nose with quality ingredients. Nothing over the top or real complex, but certainly not bad.  There is a smoky malt presence that dominates the mouth. Kind of reminds me of some good smoked beef jerky. Lightly roasted malts with some oak wood flavors. Tastes like it is young but would age well.  Thick, mildly viscous and very full body. Minimal carbonation. Good drinkability.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,selecter70,3.9,"Brought to by the masters of good canned beer, the Ten Fiddy Stout holds up excellently in spite of any initial reservations. A thick, smooth black pour and near to no head/lace sat like dark oil. The aroma was thick, with a bit noticeable alcohol that blocked the other wet, burnt wood & burnt malt aromas. The flavor was akin to the aroma, with additional plum-raisin elements and a near-liquor quality that brought on a nice chest warmth. A bit flat & heavy on the alcohol, but otherwise a good sipper.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,callmescraps,4.25,"Ok, not always my favorite style. However, I've been trying to appreciate well-made beers no matter the style, and I do LOVE Oskar Blues, so I figured it was worth a shot. Also, found a single, which isn't common, so I figured it was a sign.  Appearance - Black. I held it directly up to a bright light and absolutely nothing got through. It's about as black as beer can be. The head is a nice chocolate color, but is not very prominent at all. A little more of that pretty head would have been nice.  Smell - Sweet dark roast. Not too coffee-ish (why I dislike most stouts, I just hate coffee) with a little burnt candy hiding back there. Just a hint of cinnamon toast.  Taste - Very sweet up front. Almost a salty soy flavor as well. Lots of dark roast, but very little coffee. It definitely has some burnt bitterness, but it's not too prominent. Definitely some dried fruit, maybe raisin, lingering in the background. Plenty of chocolate. Very nice and balanced. The booze shows up as it warms, but never overpowers.  Mouthfeel - A little chewy, but mostly sweet cream. It coats the tongue pleasantly, but doesn't linger. Very pleasant.  Drinkability - Very good for the style. Not really my favorite, but I'll happily have this one. That said, it's pretty heavy for a session.  I'm very, very impressed. This may be my favorite RIS. Now, that's not saying a whole lot, since it's just not my style, but this guy is really pretty damned good. The balance is what does it. Some nice chocolate and fruit, without all the burnt bitterness or coffee notes that usually turn me off. Oskar Blues makes the best beers in a can, bar-none.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,joshuadlight,4.87,"What better beer for my 50th review than the old ten FIDY?  Motor oil, soy sauce, deep dark outer space... whatever descriptions and metaphors you want to use. This stuff is blacker than black. Almost no head which gives away its lack of carbonation.  Out of my snifter this beer came rumbling forth with all kinds of the stoutiest aromas and flavors. Sweet cinnamon toast, freshly baked bread, and melted dark (think 99% cacao) chocolate. It tasted heavenly, sweet if thats possible, bitter, hot, roasty malts. There a soy flavor for the first couple of sips, but after warming those foul flavors died away, leaving only the best flavors you can find in an Impy Stout.  Can't give it a perfect for drinkability because one was enough, but it was nicely drinkable for what it was: a big, over the top bomb of aroma and flavor that was a joy to imbibe.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BeanBone,4.7,"Appearance: My God, it looks like motor oil as it pours out of the can. Blacker than black and thick as molasses, this is without a doubt the darkest beer I've ever seen. It's like a black hole, absorbing all light it comes in contact with. In the glass, it pours a very minimalistic deep-caramel head with half-decent lacing and retention.  Aroma: If you melted a bar of dark chocolate and mixed it with a few drops of pure hop oil and a shot of ethanol, this is what it would smell like. Powerful is somewhat of an understatement.  Taste: Pounds of dark-roasted, bittersweet chocolate malt condensed down into an aluminum-wrapped twelve ounce serving. But don't be fooled into thinking this is just a one-dimensional beer. Somehow, the maniacal brewers have found space in the can for a big wall of hops. How can a beer as big as this seem somewhat balanced? Madness. As you'd expect for a beer in the double digit ABV realm, the booze likes to raise its voice. As it warms, it kicks your ass more and more.  Mouthfeel: I've compared other beers to milkshakes before, but they all seem like water compared to this. This is simply massive and smooth as all hell. The booze makes itself known in your throat.  Drinkability: You'd have to be some sort of God/lumberjack hybrid to be able to throw this back with ease.  Verdict: Ten Fidy is an experience, to say the least, and the best Russian Imperial I've tried yet. A massive body with a brilliant malt profile and a nice flourish of hops. If you like Russian Imperial Stouts whatsoever and can find this in your area, buy it. If you can't find it in your area, move.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,klewis,4.22,"A: A viscous pour from the can produces a pitch black brew with a tiny tan head. Barely any lacing.  S: Dark. Previously, I wasn't aware that ""dark"" actually had a smell, but I'm pretty sure it's this. Also, anise, dark chocolate, and a touch of booze.  T: A strong black licorice taste with big roasted flavors. Burnt oak, coffee grounds, tobacco. A bit under-attenuated with some heat.  M: Full-bodied, thick, and chewy with light carbonation. You'll need a steak knife to drink this one.  D: Hugely intense on all levels. One is about all that I can take, but I'll be looking forward to finishing the 4-pack later this week.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,popery,4.33,"A: The liquid is as black as black can be with a mocha head that is darker than nearly any other beer that I can remember. Moderate lacing remains after a few minutes.  S: The nose is dark, roasty, sweet, chocolatey and a bit fruity, like plums. For all that complexity, it's a tad on the weak side. It's a particularly sweet aroma for an Imperial Stout, and some of the complexity is washed out by this malt sweetness.  T: Excellent mild flavor for a big old Imperial Stout. Mild seems like a bad word to apply to an Imp Stout, but Ten Fidy pulls it off rather wonderfully. Chocolate is probably the dominant flavor, but there are some big roasted and fruit notes in there as well. There are some flavors that are somewhere between rum and bourbon.  M: The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly syrupy. There is a very subtle bite to it, just enough to keep it away from cloying. It walks a fine line, but the results are very successful.  D: A very interesting Imperial Stout, up there with some of the best of the style. It doesn't quite climb that very final step, with beers like The Abyss out there.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,WYVYRN527,4.38,"Finally got ahold of this beer on a trip to Sconny. The beer pours with the look of used motor oil with a thick tan head that disolves rather quickly. Carbonation is subtile. The nose is boozy at first, with hints of coffee and chocolate. Wow! The instant this brew hits the tongue, Coffee, chocolate, and vanilla notes overwhelm all else. It finishes dry with a nice hop bite. Creamy and thick, Ten Fidy is a full-bodied sipper. Very drinkable, but I wouldn't have more than one in a sitting. It's definitely made my top ten Imperial Stouts list.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,gregmoscetti,4.7,"A strong arm of a stout. Love affair born? Yup.  My first sip of this beer was on draft at LA's Fathers Office, however I only like to review a beer whileI am drinking it. Next came my county wide man-hunt to find this bad boy. After a cruise to huntington beach (followed by lunch at Beachwood BBQ), I was able to stock my fridge with 8 of these bad boys. I cracked one open while preparing some ribs for a ""family"" cookout and the first sip was just as good as i remembered. I credit Craftsman with making room on my IPA loving palate but I have to credit Oskar Blues for teaching me that love is real. If that can had arms, I'd hug it.  Even gave a taste to my Dog Archie. He wanted more.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,supercolter,4.27,"Ok so I will start this review with this beer is very good and I take nothing away from those who reviewed it. However, I just did a side-by-side with it and Surly Darkness and there is no comparison. I apologize for those that can't get Surly in their region but those who have had Darkness will agree with me I am sure. Appearance is black as coal with small head and no notable lacing. Smell is quite good- dried dark fruit and a roasted malt graininess comes through. Taste is a bit weaker than expected. More of the same but the malt is slightly lessened by a sweet hop flavor. Mouthfeel is good, nice and creamy. Very drinkable for the style.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BeerImmediately,4.43,"My first ten fidy... sweet. 12 oz to mug.  Middle-of-the-night-in-the-jungle-black color. Bubbly, tan, frothy, 3F head. Definite lacing on down.  Smell is nice, without being crazy strong. Molasses sweetness, roasted almonds, and a hint of black coffee.  Taste was like a dark chocolate milkshake with a double-shot of Baileys. Good God Y'all!  This may be the mouthfeel king of the RIS family. I'm a RIS luva, but this one didn't just put a smile on my face, frankly, I believe it seduced me.  Terrific drinkability, slow and sweet. Sip this puppy, and enjoy!!!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MisterClean,3.98,"Ten-Fidy? He wanted ten-fidy. That ain't no girl scout, that's a damned lochness monster!  On tap at Manderes in Folsom  A - Poured black, with a 2 fingered brown head, dissipated slow, left nice lacing.  S/T - Dark coffeee, chocolate, caramel, and light alcohol. Little hop flavoring.  M - Highly malt-dominated, slighlty thin, very sweet. No alcohol presence in mouthfeel.  D - This is a good beer. It could probably use some hops to tame the sweetness.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MPLS,4.55,"Poured from a can, can this be right? Into a tulip, did not feel like washing the snifter. My cold is still lingering, but a RIS seems more therapeutic than cough syrup, it's man's syrup.  A: Thin motor oil. I like drinking black shit mom. Nice 1.5 cm mocha head that settles down rapidly. Amateur lacing. Pure Vin Diesel.  S: Lots of sweet smelling malt, tame chocolate, discernible hop profile.  T: Initially was hit with a chocolate coffee bean syrup reduction, the tongue begins to feel the IBUs and like someone slowly turning up the volume on a stereo a nice roasted anise cherry like bitterness. Pleasant alcohol warmth as this monster gets closer to room temperature.  M: Feels like sex without a condom. A small ring of foam manages to cling around the glass, good carbonation for this dense yet smooth syrup.  D: I bought a 4-pack, sweet.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,KeefD,4.65,"Very thick pour, completely opaque, very small head, but it's the darkest foam I may have ever seen. Smell is fantastic! Lots of sweet roastiness, some chocolate and light coffee with some brown sugar and burnt caramel in the background. This beer completely loaded with chocolate milkshake flavor, it's pretty sweet, with a very nice roastiness, some light bitterness in the background, and just a touch of roasted coffee beans. Flavor just coats the mouth, one of the thickest stouts I've had and is up there with some of my favorites. Alcohol is barely noticeable and I find myself drinking this one a little fast because it tastes and feels so good! A+ indeed.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,schellsbeer,4.6,"Man....when KeefD said that he had a new ""little"" beer for me this evening, he wasn't kidding. Thanks my friend for this one. WOW!  A - This beer, by my standards, is one of the finest looking beers I have had the privledge of looking at. Incredible. A 5 in my book. Thick and black as fricking motor oil that has been in an engine for too long. Exceptional. NO and I mean NO LIGHT comes through. Perfect.  S - Ohhh yeah. Burnt sweet malt heaven. Like walking into a beer lovers candy store. Huge wonderful smell. I need a corned beef sandwich on Rye with some horsey sauce nextt time I have this beer. Another 5. I am scare, where is this leading. I never give all fives. Where could this be leading?  T - I am kind of excited here. If the past two criteria have any indication, I might be going on a trip to some beer planet in a few moments... Here goes...Wonderful. This beer is big and not scared to let you know it. This is one huge stout. Alcohol is present but in a fantastic way. Beer gets so much better as it warms up a bit. All of the thickness and strong stout characteristics come through. Wow....I am hooked. Not quite a 5 but close. I have to give it a 4.5. This beer reminds me of an Old Raspy but much thicker.  M - Get the steak knives out boys because you are going to chew this one down. Fantistic. Creamy. Completely coats the mouth. Smooth. Another 5.  D - Why can Wisconsin get this but Minnesota can't? I mean, the trucks have to go through Minnesota to get the beer to Wisconsin. For this reason, I have to give it a 4. Also, because this is such a HUGE beer. Could I drink this all day. Of course I could. Would I die trying...I just might, or at least the liver might. Sign me up for the donar program boys....if this hits Minnesota, I just might need one.  Thanks again Keith...Fantastic.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,merlin48,4.05,"Pouring a stout from a can is a new experience, I must admit. Ebony body is topped by a small brown head that leaves some wispy lacing.  Aroma is dark roasted malt notes of chocolate, cocoa, and coffee.  Excellent mouthfeel is silky smooth, with subdued carbonation and a full body.  Taste is on par with an excellent impy stout, but not as complex as I had hoped. Prominent cocoa and bittersweet choclate, complimented by hints of dark fruits and earthy hops. Finishes with a bitter roastiness.  An excellent stout, but I was expecting something earth shattering given my previous experiences with Oskar Blues. Still, this is definitely one I would buy again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,droomyster,4.7,"Ten fidy is extraordinary. The blackest of black with a dense brown head that smells like a smore that was hit with a blowtorch. Appearance smell-wise it is not very different from other RISs, but its taste sets it ahead of its kin. Very rich chocolately and coffee flavors, both of which have sweet AND bitter expressions coming through depending on whether its on the front of your palate, swished around, or the lingering swallow. Its body is dense but has a luxurious, velveteen texture. The first sip literally gave me goosebumps. This beer has ""quality"" written all over it. Props to Oskar Blues for shunning microbrew conventions by putting such a grand masterpiece in a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,AdmiralDiaz,4.32,"Thanks to Br3wmeister and Natasharai! Poured from a 12oz can to pint glass.  A: Pours black with a beautiful one-finger brown head that is very creamy and has pretty good retention. Some lacing but not a lot after the initial head.  S: Very malty, with molasses and chocolate. Small trace of alcohol.  T&M: Bittersweet chocolate malts with a slight smokey/roasted taste and a bit of alcohol that gets stronger as the drink warms. A small bit of hops in the finish along with strong chocolate. Leaves a strong malty/chocolate aftertaste. Very smooth with a bit of carbonation, perfect for the style, it's always nice to have a strong stout that is drinkable and not overpowering.  Overall: Wonderful stout that is one of the most drinkable I've had. Very good flavor and smell. If you're able to get one of the bad boys expect a great overall RIS",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,DavidSeanNJ,4.5,"Yes!  Finally got a chance to sample the Ten Fidy. Had a nice little can all to myself =)  Poured this badboy into a tulip glass for an optimum tasting experience.  A- Oily black liquid straight out of the bi-colored can (silver and black). One look and I knew this would be a bad ass RIS. Thin caramel graham cracker head. Thin yes, but it stuck around the whole time. Lacing- CHECK. All the elements of a nice looking RIS were in order.  S- The smell was much sweeter than expected. I smelled some dried fruits and figs a long with cocoa and brown sugar.  T- The fact that this brew was extremely well-balanced was one of the beers best qualities. A nice combonation of hops, chocolate, dried fruits, sugar, molasses, etc. Not too much of just one ingredient.  M- Oily as all hell. Smooth like slick on the tongue and throat. Woah! Burns, yes, but quite enjoyable. Carbonation perfect.  D- One of my favorite brews to date! I would love to pick up more and sit a few down although its great right now.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ffejherb,4.43,"On nitro-tap at Brass Rail, Campbelltown, PA on 3/12/09.  A - Poured oily and black as night off the nitro-tap with an inch of creamy mocha-colored head that reduced to about a quarter inch of retention and left decent lacing. Produced a nice cascading effect every time I swirled the glass.  S - Alcohol is more apparent here than with the canned version. Chocolate and coffee notes mingle with the boozy character. Some black licorice also emerges. Quite a hot and roasty aroma overall.  T - Flavor is quite chocolatey, but not sickeningly sweet. Hints of coffee and licorice add some depth, but overall the chocolate dominates the flavor. Ten Fidy also boasts a bold hop presence suggesting earthy and leafy notes, especially as it approached room temperature. Finishes on the bitter side for a stout with plenty of roasted malt goodness.  M - Full bodied and rick with an amazingly smooth and creamy texture. There's just a touch of carbonation in the middle to wake up them tastebuds. Finishes with moderate bitterness on the palate.  D - One of the best RISs on the market, IMO. This was amazing on nitro. Ten Fidy drinks supurbly for a 10% beer. Yum!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,StarlightSeraph,3.85,"Poured from a 12 oz can into my New Belgium globe glass.  Appearance: Thick. Very thick. Dark, dark brown, almost black, with one finger of some of the darkest-brown head I've seen. Very bubbly. The head subsided fairly quickly, but left a thin brown layer for most of the glass. Heavy layer of lacing.  Smell: Dark chocolate, sweet malts, some dark fruits - not as heavy on the roasted notes as other Impy Stouts I've had. Wisps of alcohol seep through. Lots of chocolate comes through as the beer warms. Almost a little bit of a smoky scent. Smells a lot like a chocolate brownie.  Taste: Chocolate, coffee notes, more roasted malts than are present in the smell. An astringent note that is mildly unpleasant, and something I just can't place. The finish is both bitter and smooth, if that makes sense - a smooth, creamy taste from the chocolate and sweet malts backed with the bitterness from the roasted malts. Left a nice warming sensation in my stomach. Becomes a little cloying as it warms, however, as the sweetness begins to overpower the beer.  Mouthfeel: Thick, but surprisingly, not as thick as I would have guessed from the appearance. Very creamy, and nicely carbonated. Perhaps a tinge too highly carbonated, but that's nitpicking.  Drinkability: A very good Imperial Stout. Glad I sought this one out. I like it, but there's something about it I can't place that bothers me. I'd probably have it again. This one did go down dangerously quickly.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,soulgrowl,4.17,"Appearance: Extremely oily, viscous, and thick black with a hazelnutty milk chocolate-colored head. Good structure, but the retention is not exemplary.  Smell: Big caramel brownie aroma, with plenty of rich chocolate, toffee, hazelnuts, and walnuts and a big bass note of molasses. Plenty of port and Scotch-like booze, licorice, raisins, and black cherries round out the flavor. This smells great!  Taste: Pleasantly rich and robust. Loads of chocolate, espresso, creme brulee-like burnt sugar, prunes, and raisins. Really decadent and dark on the palate, very nice indeed.  Mouthfeel: Very good, smooth and oily but not too cloying. Not dry, but not syrupy. A good amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Very drinkable, especially for the ABV, but this isn't the most interesting or delicious RIS out there. Quite possibly the best beer I've had out of a can, though.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jstilwell,3.8,"Ahh yes the Ten Fidy! I love this company,all of their styles across the board. The Ten Fidy was one of the first RIS I ever tried, and boy was I horrified at the time. My tastebuds were not at all prepared and my palate had not quite matured. I went running for the hills. Time to review again.  This is the blackest of the black. I get a very dark head, a true medium brown with some off white. ITs a thick head but quickly shrinks to a half finger size. Lacing is lasting and everywhere on my glass. I'm a swirler! Aroma is tremendous, earth, malt, dark chocolate, strong alcohol, tree bark, and blackened char from the grille. This is a very complex brew. I can see how this one can be someone's favorite stout, it has a unique taste to it. There is some syrupy feel but it is not sweet overall, or is it?. Sweet and bitter battle it out and I feel differently with each sip. There is a definite smokiness to this one. There is a nice chewy roasted characteristic to this one. The aftertaste is a bit harsh and the alcohol is quite prominent. I will revisit this one from time to time one at a time. Drinkability is very low for me. I'm impressed with this, and I want to like it more than I do. Overall, many other stouts are ahead on my list, but I see the allure for sure.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Hoagie1973,4.62,"Poured like freakin well-used motor oil. I mean BLACK! There's no light getting through this one anywhere. Smallish head, but its one of the darkest I've seen; even darker than Mackeson XXX. Lacing is wet, sloppy and spotty all over the glass. Smells amazing. Like espresso and bittersweet chocolate. Same holds true for the flavor. High ABV is barely perceptible to the tongue. Bittering hops show in the long finish after the sweetness has faded and the alcohol warming kicks in. Goes powdery dry at the very end with a definite black coffee characteristic. Mouthfeel is heavy and full, thick and creamy. Very little carbonation, but very little is needed. The body of this beer holds up on its own. Delicious! On par with Old Rasputin and Brooklyn BCS. I couldn't say which of the three I like best.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,sulldaddy,4.82,"Another fun style beer in a can! I love it.  The beer is at cellar temp and poured into a snifter. A pitch black pour with minimal tan head that fades an edge layer quickly. Aroma is grainy and chocolate some booze and molasses and roasted malt as well. Very complex nose that I like. First sip reveals the expected thick body with fin spacious carbonation, the carbonation is almost cask like and flows effortlessly across my palate. Flavor is roasted malt and molasses and some brown sugar mixed with chocolate. Big hearty flavor and texture. The booze is fairly subdued due to the rich flavors that meld perfectly in this beer. No real hop presence either. This is one beer I will buy again for sure.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,snaotheus,4.11,"What do you think an imperial stout is going to look like? It's black and thick, it has thin filmy brown head, and medium lacing. All of which is nice. The can itself is the ugliest aspect.  The smell is not very strong, but what I do smell is smoke.  The taste is surprisingly sweet -- caramel and molasses, coffee and chocolate, some smoke flavor, and all surprisingly well balanced. A little cherry note as the taste fades away.  Feels thick, but not quite viscous -- it feels more carbonated than it looks.  Pretty drinkable for an imperial stout. Sometimes they're so thick and heavy they're hard to get through, but this is pretty nice.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Spotty white lacing at the side of the glass  S: Alcohol nose with a coffee and chocolate backer.  M/T: Medium, syrupy body. Huge alcohol taste stings the tongue, followed by roasted malts. Finishes slightly bitter, but overall clean.  D: This beer has a lot going on. The bitter aftertaste makes it a little bit of a pallet killer in my opinion, however very complex and enjoyable.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,EPseja,4.56,"Poured from a 12 oz can (of course) into my DFH snifter at just below cellar temperature.  A - Motor-oil black with subtle carbonation action that pushes up a modest cappuccino foam head that subsides to a film after about a minute or so. Not much for lacing, but then again this style always has trouble in this area.  S - Amazingly, behind the thick roasted coffee and dark chocolate malt assault, the crisp green west coast hops are completely discernible. Also noted are hints of vanilla, soy, brown sugar and molasses.  T - Bitter coffee and bittersweet chocolate with that odd but unmistakable nuance of English Stilton cheese that I so often get in really good Russian Imperial Stouts. Nicely bittered in the back of the tongue and after the swallow. Decently drying in a way that leaves you wanting that next sip...  M - Silky and smooth with just a quick wash of tingle. Turns thick and viscous in the mouth before the sublime, throat-coating swallow. Fantastic.  D - For a ten percenter, this beer is all about the smooth. I don't know what else to say other than -- this beer simply rocks, and I wish I had it in the running when I did my last RIS blind tasting.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,alpinebryant,3.85,"Appearance: Dark black with a light cappuccino foam.

2681,34483,tavernjef,4.41,"Thick and black with a steardy, fluffy dark fudgy brown top of foam. A thin grazing of lace sheets itself across the glass with amazing might.  Nose of semi boozy/rum soaked dark fudge and darker chocolate, roast, espresso, dark cherry, and notes to piney hops.  Flavors are quite nice with a rich, decadant flow of deep lush chocolate laced with roasty coffee bits and some tame tangy black cherry sweetness and thick fig are layered within the chocolate. Loftily and mediumly justified in its bitterness of chocolate and hops the whole way thru. A lofty cake-like fluff in the finish builds incredibly well, like eating a huge, well-made chocolate chocolate chip muffin, as it then seeps in a bit of dark cherry/dark rummy/port wine-like warmth over a bit of molasses and some slight piney hoppyness under its lengthy chocolate base. Delish! And worth every sip and/or gulp.  Big creamy body of silky laden thick chocolatey fudge. A bolder bite in the mid range of carbonation, yet staying calming and smooth, soft, and supple. Lightly drying off ever so faintly into the finish of a complexing and fun portion of fluffy dark chocolate, dark cherry warming piney hops.  Impressive as hell! And quite drinkable just the same!

Pours like jet black motor oil with a nice brown head and decent lacing. Slight bitter chocolate aroma with roasted malts, coffee and some espresso. One thing I noticed right off the bat is that the roasted malts do not take over the whole beer which is nice. The bitter dark chocolate taste is their as well as the coffee but I do detect some hop bitterness underneath the coffee.

There are some of the head clinging to the glass.  Nose: A roasted malted barley, with some molasses, caramel, toffee, coffee, and chocolate. In the background of the beer there is some citrus and floral. You also can smell the black malt which gives the beer a slight burnt character.  Taste: A deep rich roasted malts, there is some molasses, caramel, coffee, and chocolate. There is some noticeable hops in the beer which lend to the floral ester, slight burnt character, and some resin.  Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is coating and creamy. The body of the beer is full. The finish on the beer is medium full with slight bitterness. This beer is well round and very well made. It is one of the better RIS that I have tried.

Light carbonation, this has to be one of the most beautiful things Ive ever seen poured out of a can(haven't had Surly though,). Aromatics are highly enjoyable. Chocolate, pomegranite, milky dairy creaminess upfront. I once tried a chocolate Pom pomegranite juice drink, and this is it. Espresso, vanilla, anise, soy follow. This is not overpowering in any direction, clean, well hopped. At first sip, a suprising hoppiness comes through. A extremly well balanced mixture of spicy hops, followed by cocoa, little dark fruits, Armanac prunes, more espresso and chocolate on the finish. Spiced mexican chocolat comes to mind. The deepness of the maltiness paired with hoppy spiciness give this brew a chocolaty musty spiciness that recalls a young Barolo wine. This would pair greatly with roasted red meat or game. This is easily one of the most hopped stouts Ive tried, and Im digging it. Mouthfeel is full, thick, and rich but then kept in balance by the hoppiness. Over all a very ""clean"" extremely flavorful stout I will make a regular.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,instrumentality,4.13,"Ten FIDY has the honor of being the first canned beer I've taken the time to review. I'm still getting my feet wet with Oskar Blues, but so far they have done a nice job of helping to shatter the stigma of canned beer. The very notion of an RIS coming in a can is foreign to me, but this isn't my first time trying it so I already know to expect good things.  I've been out of practice as far as respecting beer to the level of formally reviewing it, but it's something I'd like to get back into the habit of doing, so I'll try to do it right.  I poured this brew relatively quickly into my Stone IRS tulip glass, which is my favorite glass and also seemed appropriate given the style. It's black with very little head; essentially just a caramely-brown halo and some lace. Looking directly down into the glass, my mouth actually waters a bit as I make the mental association with a refreshing chocolate malt.  The odor picks up where the visual left off - fresh roasted coffee beans...chocolate malt...a little burnt smell like smoldering charcoal in a barbecue...a slight fermented fruitiness like a dry red wine. It's partly enticing, partly intimidating. I never expect an RIS to be refreshing, but I'm not sure whether this will be more on the rich malty side or the dry alcohol burn-heavy side...and this is after already having tried it, so obviously I didn't pay close enough attention.  Here goes...  Very malty up front (not so much chocolate malt but yum)...followed by some dry sweetness of red wine (eh)...with a burnt charcoal finish that becomes more prevalent as I exhale softly (soothing).  The body seems a little thin, and as I drink more, it becomes a little abrasive and acidic, but that charcoal element always comes in at the end and rounds it off nicely. I'm trying to review to style, though, and I generally find RIS's to be aggressive, so give the circumstances, this one is pretty good.  As with many beers that are a bit intense at first, this one gets better as I get deeper into it. Is my palate adjusting? Is the alcohol making me more forgiving as it kicks in? Probably some of each. Either way, over time, I've upgraded the mouthfeel from a 3.5 to a 4 and the drinkability from a 4 to a 4.5, so if you actually care about my opinion and are experiencing similar sensations, be patient. This is a very well executed, approachable example of the Russian Imperial Stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TheChauffeur1,3.03,"First I must say this in not my style and far from it. I am trying many new beers and this review is IMO. This is a big beer that looks good. Had it on tap at Capone's.  This beer smacked me in the mouth and overwhelmed my taste buds. Others tasting with me loved this beer. I am trying. Even for its class this beer is a mouthful for sure.

2681,34483,Bighuge,4.53,"Pitch black body. Thin creamy brown head. Lace is sporadic. Bubbly islands of brown cream form on the surface as I drink. The aroma is pretty thick, oily and greasy, and roasty. Also notice some hints of black licorice and dark currants. Oh, as I first taste this, I realize this thing's got some viscosity. This is some viscous shit. In a good way. I like it. Imp. stouts should have a very full and viscous body and mouthfeel. Carbonation is appropriately low. and the alcohol doesn't really surface much. I think it's hidden behind some of the bold flavors of this beer. I really like the flavors of anise and licorice and currants in this beer. It's got some of the requisite char and roasted malt bitterness. But the beauty is really in the dark fruitiness.

2681,34483,htomsirveaux,4.2,"12 oz. can tried 21 Feb 2009. Slightly smudged writing on bottom but appears to have a canning date of 08/25/08. Courtesy of gford217, thanks for this!  Poured in 0.4 L Steiner Pils snifter. Very viscous in the pour. Medium sized deep dark brown thick head. Completely opaque, pitch black. Aroma of deeply roasted chocolate and smoke, charred coffee beans. Begins and ends like very roasty espresso. Through the middle is a lot of cocoa and bitter chocolate flavor. Only slight sweetness, this is more on the dry side. Body is heavy and creamy. Ethanol seems milder than 10%, but quite warming.  By far the best of the Oskar Blues I've tried so far.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jera1350,4.08,"Black as night with a deep dark brown head.  Smells of toasted malt and coffee with some dark chocolate notes and bit of alcohol.  Taste is quite hoppy. Decent bitterness which doesn't show up in many RIS's. Very roasty, some grassiness and quite a bit of dark chocolate with some coffee. Alcohol is a bit noticeable.  Full bodied, but feels a bit thinner than other top ranked for the style. Not as slick as others for the style. Some prickly carbonation is present as well. Warm alcohol is felt on the way down.  Hoppy and roasty makes this stand out from some other RIS's. A very nice RIS. I can think of a couple others that are better at a better price point as well. Very good beer and it comes in a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ProudBeerSnob,4.25,"Another brew I've been looking forward to trying...  Poured from the can into a pint glass. Inkky black with a thin tan colored head, with heavy chocolate aromas.  Very dry chocolate flavor upfront, with the roasted malt coming at the end.  Mouthfeel, as expected is thick and creamy. Impy stouts don't tend to be crinkable, but this one is good. I'm taking my time because I'm enjoying, not because it's a chore.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,tmoneyba,4.25,Can from aljsdad.  Poured black color with a moderate to large creamy brown head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Heavy toasted chocolate and coffee malt with a small alcohol aroma. Full body with a creamy texture. Heavy balanced toasted chocolate malt flavor with a heavy dark chocolate bittersweet finish of long duration.  This is a standout beer. Thanks Brad!,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,superdedooperboy,4.27,"Poured from a 12 oz. black-and-silver can into a snifter glass. Alcohol content as stated on the can is 9.5% by volume.  Never before has an imperial stout looked so much like oil as it is poured into the glass, and the can truly adds to the effect. Super thick, viscous, and opaque, giving off a tiny and brief ring of milk chocolate brown bubbles.  A wonderful dessert-like nose of milk and dark chocolate, espresso, figs, and cherries beckons one to dive into the darkness.  A thick, fat body wraps itself around the tongue, imparting flavors of bittersweet dark chocolate, roasted coffee, licorice, dark fruits, bitter hops and a touch of alcohol. As it sweeps the palate and goes down, an incredible dryness saps the tongue and a rich, heavy sweetness lingers on the back of the tongue for a long while afterward.  An incredible imperial stout, worthy of being ranked up there with the best. I'm not sure if the can imparts any particular characteristics that serve to make this such an amazing brew; it would be nice to be able to sample a bottled or draft version so as to make a comparison. The can isn't hurting anything, though, and if anything it adds to the allure of this blacker-than-night beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,PeprSprYoFace,4.54,Pours a motor oil black. Very oily looking. No head at all but some lacing down the glass. It could have been because it was in my regular fridge and was a little colder than it was suppose to be.  Smell is wonderful. With alot of burnt coffee and bitter chocolate. I smell a bit of Burbon too maybe.  It starts with a viscouse semi sweet taste in your mouth. The carbonation hits and then finishes with bitter coffee and chocolate I'm the center and back of your tongue. Very tasty.  I wish the mouthfeel was a little more viscous and a little higher on the carbonation.  Drinkability is great and I will buy 4 packs of this for as long as I can.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,beachbum1975,4.47,"DrewOSU shared this with me tonight. I've had it before, but never reviewed it - so here it goes...  Thanks for the share, Andrew!  Poured into my over-sized cab glass like straight-up motor oil. Blackness with no hope of any light coming through. Very little head on both pours (mine or DrewOSU's). What small head I did get was dark brown and left impressive lacing.  Big and powerful nose with super heavily roasted/burnt coffee followed vanilla, sweet, chewy malts and hints of sweet cherry.  High viscosity with great carbonation out of the gates. Full flavored blast of rich coffees all around. This is a big beer with great flavor. After the initial wave of coffee, I get some sweet malts and light smokiness or char flavor as you would look for in a RIS. As the beer hits my tongue, it's like a blanket of wet, coffee and chocolate goodness. The finish on this beer is slightly vegetal, likely due to it's high, but hidden hops presence.  This is an amazingly enjoyable beer. Recommended if you're a Russian Imperial Stout fan!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,markwise,4.55,"Thanks kiefdog for the share. I can't believe that a world class beer comes out of a can. Dad gum it Osker Blues! It pours motor oil black with a dark brown head. Nose is roasted malt, alcohol burn, coffee, some coffee, slight licorice flavor, and dark fruit. A ton of yellow lace lines the glass when you swirl. Flavor is velvety smooth- very light on carbonation- with lots of ripe dark fruit, sweet chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee bitterness. Starts sweet, and finishes with coffee bitterness. Slight bourbony alcohol flavor throughout. Thoroughly enjoyable beer! If it spilled I would lick it off of almost any floor.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,waldowin,4.06,"Can was labeled at 9.5% ABV, not the 10% shown here.  Pours an opaque black. No light gets through, even at the edges. Head is very thin, light brown, and comprised of small bubbles densely packed. This is about as dark as it gets.  Smell is of chocolate, dark roast coffee, and licorice. Not very strong, but not surprising, given the style.  Taste is of raisins, bitter chocolate, and a hint of licorice at the finish. Mouthfeel starts fairly balanced, the finish is slightly astringent.  The high ABV and acidity of this beer would make it hard to drink much, but I wouldn't mind a second can.  Probably the first canned beer I've enjoyed.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S: The aroma isn't strong or long lasting but starts out with strong coffee aroma there is even a little bit of chocolate in the nose but this is all somewhat subdued and subtle  T: Very smooth and creamy. there is a roasted coffee bean taste that adds to a biting bitterness that doesn't linger on the tongue too significantly and then is backed by a malty burnt taste. the bitterness does overwhelm any particular sweetness the beer might have. this is very good  M/D: this is a very smooth delicious IRS its thicker and more potent than a lot of supposed stouts, but isn't overwhelming so very good.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The taste is huge, yet fairly well balanced. Big roasted malts, almost a barley wine type taste in there nice hops help round out the huge malt backbone on this one. Molasses, coffee, chocolate, burnt bitterness, well crafted brew here. Very smooth, creamy mouthfeel with nice light carbonation makes this extremely drinkable. One of my favorite RIS, must have again and again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

M: Creamy and smooth. I could use a little more carbonation.  D: It's a 10% beer, how drinkable can it be?

It has a resiny, roasty, chocolate-licorice aroma. It smells a touch sweet like molasses. It is heavy and smooth. The finish is clean and very dry. It tastes very roasted, like medium roast coffee, but it doesn't get too astringent. Once again, there are notes of chocolate and licorice. It is well balanced and action packed. The aftertaste is like sweet resin. It's a formidable beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,Beerenauslese,4.15,"This pours black, with a good head at first, but dissipates quickly, with not much lace retention.  Smells of dark chocolate, cherries, and earth.  A fruity sourness at first then chocolate, espresso, cream, cherries, blueberries, a little pepperiness. Quite delightful, with an interesting complexity.  Low carbonation and syrupy. This delights the palate with sour and sweet sensations, but with a creaminess that unites the two.  A very drinkable brew and a knockout for a canned stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,HitokiriNate85,4.23,"Poured into a snifter. I contacted the brewery and was told it was canned in late 07/early 08.  A - It was hilarious and awesome seeing an RIS come out of a can. Really, really thick. Poured a thin, dark brown head that faded quick. My girlfriend watched and claimed it was the blackest drink she'd ever seen.  S - I opened this on the counter, and literally as soon as I cracked it, I could smell it from a couple feet away. It has a huuuge aroma. There's an enormous chocolate/roasted malt presence that just really dominates here.  T - I took my first sip and thought to myself, ""This is why I love RISs."" The great chocolate/roasty smell comes through so well. There's some brown sugar in here as well, which I've never seen had come through so much in an RIS. There's a really slight hint of alcohol, which I was surprised at considering the age on it(this is my first aged RIS). Really roasty finish.  MF - Thick. The thickest RIS I've ever had, and I like it. Leaves a lot of coating. There's a sharpness from the alcohol. Average carbonation for the style. I love the thickness of it, but I wish it were more smooth in this department.  D - It's just huge on flavor and feel. I can't imagine drinking more than one, but a lot of RISs are that way for me, so it fits my idea of the style. It would almost feel like stealing to get this at less than $3 for a single can(granted, I'd be more than happy to oblige), so it was worth it. I'm giving it a 4 because while I wouldn't drink more than one, it's certainly one of the best RISs I've had.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TheDoorman,4.12,"Pours like motor oil, to use a style-cliche, thick and black. Forced pour encourages a small tan head that dissipates quickly. Solid retention on a tip of the glass. Nose is filled with dark, rich roasted malt, followed by a strong smokeyness. Love this aroma. Palate is surprisingly light on the front end and the sweetness of the malt comes through closer to the finish. Great roasted malt, but a bit light in the front of the palate, and a bit one-note. Mayeb a tocuh too sweet, could use some more hop character to cut it. A tingling effervescence is somewhat troubling. It isn't a strong carbonation, but fairly persistent. I'd prefer a touch less. Still very creamy and silky. Alcohol is well hidden behind the roasty malt goodness. A very good rendition of an imperial stout, and certainly the best I've had out of a can, but not in the upper echelon of the style in this reviewer's opinion.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bbothen,4.38,"Deep dark motor oil black with a thick & frothy less than 1 finger deep tan colored head. Looks like melted dark chocolate. Not a trace of light can penetrate the darkness. Looks awesome & ominous. Yes, a 5 for appearance.  Aroma is of sweet dark malts, cocoa powder, dark fruit, plum, date, fig, raisin, faint roasted coffee, hop bitterness. A world of aroma going on here. I'm pleased so far, bummed I only have one of these.  Big roasty flavors, coffee, chocolate, warming booziness, dark fruitiness, licorice, lingering roastiness. Nice.  Thick, not syrupy, chewy, thick, FULL bodied, low carbonation, thick, creamy, filling like a meal.  This is a big ass imperial stout. Very happy with the 12oz serving size.

Head sits a darker burnt caramel mocha hue. The retention was very impressive leaving a sheet of tightly bubbled lacing around the glass.  S: Rich baked chocolate aromas. Heavy sweetness like licorice sticks dipped in honey and molasses. Smoked malts with a faint tint of hops toward the back. Maybe a bit of 'can' smell but the rich and thick aromas in this beer outweigh that.  T: Complex malts with warming chocolate and coffee tastes. Dark toasted milk chocolates with woody undertones. Has a fudge and oaked quality especially as it warms. Some hint of charred dark fruits like figs or raisins. Vanilla and cocoa swirl together with a toffee sweetness. Just like the nose there is a quick hops bittering finish in this beer.  M: Medium to full bodied with good carbonation. Maybe a bit mild for an imperial stout but only barely. This is still very solid and coats down to the core.  D: I love the fact that this comes in a can. It looks cool and it drinks damn finely.

Smells of chocolate, roasted malts and tin can.  Damn tasty stout, reminds me of Great Divide's Yeti. Nice big flavor but oh so smooth at the same time. I was shocked when I read 98 IBUs but then thought it made perfect sense with how balanced the taste was. I know it's their trademark but the tin can taste was at the end of every sip but in no way ruined the beer, I'd love to have this on tap, out of a bomber or even barrel aged.  Mouthfeel is kick ass! Rich and smooth somewhere in between a milkshake and chocolate milk.  Drinkability was perfect, nice balance of great malt taste and 98 IBUs. The 9% ABV was revealed at all the right moments.

Flavor has lots of roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, chocolate. Sweet enough to balance the coffee/espresso bitterness. You can feel the warming alcohol, but doesn't burn.

First thing that I noticed was how creamy this is - it's great. Sweet coffee/mocha flavors backed up by roasted malts with hints of dark fruits and dark chocolate. Dark chocolate dipped cherries kept coming into mind.  Alcohol slightly bears its head on the finish, but overall it's extremely (and dangerously) well-hidden.

It tastes very malty, like a boozy malted milkshake, thick and creamy and chocolatey with a bit of bitter aftertaste. Most Russian Imperial Stouts like this one are quite strong, and while Ten FIDY does come in at about 10% alcohol, it's not quite as intense as I expected -- it's quite drinkable and perfect for a cold winter night.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Dark roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and faint forest floor (from the hops I assume).  T. Most of what's present on the nose carries over to the taste - rich smoky malts, coffee and chocolate. There is a nice lingering bitterness to the finish that sticks with you for quite some time after swallowing this beast.  M. Rich, thick and chewy with low carbonation. More or less what I am looking for in a RIS.  D. This is a one-and-done beer for me due to its high ABV and heaviness. It's a very enjoyable RIS that carries its alcohol well and avoids the over sweetness of many others.

There are hints of sweet spices like cinnamon.  Taste: Up front pretty smokey and malty. There is a bit of alcohol taste, and a bittersweet end like dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel: This beer is medium bodied for a RIS, slightly syrupy, has a small sting on the tongue from the alcohol.  Overall: For a RIS this is pretty easy to drink.

Big sweet burnt malts invade initially, fruity mid palate with a bright hop character on the finish leading into a drying alcohol wave. Good weight to its body, low carbonation makes it feel 'bigger' than it really should i think, very good drinkability nonetheless.

There is a big chocolate presence, espresso hints, small note of smoked flavors in the first sips. Hops are present, but very mild - however gives a nice blend of bitterness.

S - I don't drink many stouts but to me it smells very roasted and malty. Very chocolate-y, lots of roasted aromas, hints of malt syrup, and surprisingly a little sweet at the end.  T - If you told me this was out of a can I would have tried to administer you to a mental institution. At first it's very robust...the roasted malt dances on your tongue like a rendition of Riverdance. The sweetness of caramel and molasses are vaguely present. It finishes with an espresso-like aftertaste.  M/D - It is very velvety on the palate and quite smooth. Not much carbonation which I kind of expected. I gave it a low drinkability score because I don't think anybody needs more than one of these a night.  After many recommendations about Ten Fidy I am stoked I bought one.

2681,34483,DoubleJ,3.96,"The mystique of Oskar Blues rolls on. Part of a 4 pack I bought at Total Wine, on to the beer:  Tanned caramel heads are sexy, better when they can hold their lids. Shine the beer through a light and no change in color, pitch black body. The aroma is mild for an impy stout, charred wood is dominant here. Undertones of unsweetened chocolate. The flavor is sweeter than the aroma, but the charred and wood flavors remain dominant. Hops are moderate in intensity, found mostly on the middle of the palate. Slightly sweet. Hints of the can remain throughout the beer. The body is big and viscous, carbonation is low. Chocolate brownie notes remains in the aftertaste with a charred and astringent flavor.  It's a tasty imperial stout...from a can. And you can bring it beaches that allow alcohol. Not too expensive for an out-of-state RIS, $8.99 for a four pack of 12 ounce cans.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,avalon07,4.08,"A: Poured from a can to a pint glass. Had a coal black color and a thick texture. There was a thin layer of tan-colored head and some OK lacing.  S: Smelled of chocolate, coffee and roasted malt.  T: A well done taste of bitter dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. The alcohol is pretty noticable at first, but you get used to it.  M: A well carbonated beer with a smooth finish. Medium- to full-bodied.  D: This is a drinkable, well made and easy to drink beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SilentSabre,4.58,"Poured from its can absolutely jet black and incredibly thick. Nice. No head to speak of. Smell is big baker's chocolate with maybe a pinch of coffee and little else. Taste is dominated by dark malts with some nice hop bitterness showing up at the end. Very heavy, almost oily in the mouth. The 10%abv is very well concealed, too. A very, very solid stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Metalmonk,3.96,"I'd been wanting to try this for quite some time. No problem finding Dale's or Old Chub, but this one hasn't made it to these parts as far as I know. Many thanks to coldmeat23 for hooking it up.  The pour is like cracking open one of those old school oil cans and throwing it in a snifter. Completely pitch black, with a colony of bubbles nesting at the bottom of the snifter, probably too suffocated in thick viscosity to climb up. The head is a gorgeous brown, smooth and thick like melted chocolate ice cream, and it stays put a good while before thinning to a crown. Pouring this kind of thing out of a can felt like total novelty. I love it.  Unlike other Oskar Blues stuff, and pretty much all other canned crafts I've had, there seems to be a layer to the aroma that is, well, ""can."" We'll just call it earth/mineral. But some deep roasted characteristics do emerge, as does some chocolate. Not really ""all that,"" in terms of aroma--certainly not as big and bold as others of the style.  While bringing the snifter to the mouth, I still get that mineral/earth element, but it's pretty well buried by the roasty goodness once liquid hits tongue. Good dark roast coffee qualities merge with a creamy milk-chocolate flavor, while a nutty aspect rounds it out. Faint whispers of cola, dark berry and steamed milk in the background--and into the finish, where the roast/nut characteristics dominate. Hops? Maybe, but only well-mingled--they definitely don't run the show.  Slick, round and uber-creamy in the mouth, although thick/gooey it is not. Just the right balance of weight and glide, and quite dry, certainly more so than many in the style category.  9.5% ABV (that's what it says on the can) is superbly well-hidden, lending only the most minor sensation of alcohol warmth. Makes it dangerously drinkable. I'll hunt this down again and see what happens. This hit the spot and has plenty to recommend it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,0110x011,4.36,"A - pours motor oil thick and midnight black. Thick, tight, bark brown two finger head. Major staying power. Surprisingly, not too much in the way of lacing. As pretty a RIS as I've ever seen.  S - major chocolate on the nose. Smells like a liquid Hershey bar. Caramel, raisin, and fig notes pull through. On the sweet side.  T - the chocolate and dark fruit flavors intermingle quite harmoniously. More of a raisinette kind of vibe. A solid roasty bitterness. Dash of alcohol. More roasty and chocolate as it warms.  M - thick, slick, rich and creamy. Smooth as silk.  D - one can is enough, but you don't want that can to end.  One of the best commonly available RISs out there. Not complex enough to be among the upper echelon, but still very, very tasty.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SykDoc,4.35,"Had this courtesy of stoutsnipas, as well as brdc. Poured from a can into a flute, it pours like an opaque black motor oil with brown edges when held to the light. A minimal mocha colored head forms to about an inch and then leaves minimal lacing at the edges.  The aroma is quite complex with the standard of dark chocolate. However, there are also strong components of bourbon and brown sugar, as well as a dark cherry hint.  The taste is similar to the aroma with dark malty flavor, as well as a fair level of bourbon. Hops do sneak there way in at the finish. It gives off a large flavor of chocolate and does not seem to be just dark chocolate, which adds a nice sweetness.  The mouthfeel in farily heavy with a good amount of carbonation. It is quite viscous and smooth with a sticky finish.  I still can't believe it comes in a can. This is an very good beer to enjoy and savor. It will leave you satisfied if you like good stouts.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,goatgoat,3.95,"Pours like motor oil. Absolutely opaque black. An aggressive pour shows no initial head. Just after pouring a thin cap of mocha cream appears and then disappears. No lacing. Aroma is heavy dark fruits, berries and chocolate. First taste is smooth and creamy, an underlying roast note ends with a slight alcohol taste. As it warms chocolate and roast become more prominent. The main detractor to this brew is that the alcohol is more noticeable than I would like. Generally I prefer more roast character as well.  And the ""pack it in, pack it out"" slogan on the can warms the heart of this backpacker. It would be an excellent backcountry brew. Pika, meet Ten FIDY. Ten FIDY, Pika.  Initial review on 2/5/09. After a few more RISs under my belt I revisited it. The above is the newer review. It's fairly similar though I reduced the scores a bit, I was a bit starry eyed with this brew since it was one of my first RISs.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S-Chocolate with some fruity esters. coffee. A bit weak compared to the flavor.  T- Chocolate brownies with a ton of bitter coffee. Really roasty, huge bitterness both from roasted grains and hops. Really nice  M- medium bodied. Medium carbonation.  D- Nice beer for a cold snowy night. Probably wouldnt' be a good choice come spring.

2681,34483,dwpiercetx,3.98,"With all the hype, I was expecting a knock out with a smooth feel that would hide the alcohol under the stoutiness. I was wrong. I am not saying this was bad at all, just didn't live up to the BA hype put on it. I will buy more next time it comes around. It's a beer that I'll drink if I want beer and it's too late to make a session. Dark..couldn't see through it. Roasted choc and coffee malts with lingering alcohol taste...the only bummer.

2681,34483,dblipajunkie,4.51,"Canned on 12-22-08.  Maybe the best beer I've had in a can ahead of OB's Gordon. Right off the bat the first characteristics which impress me most are:  - Color - Drinkability - Taste  Plenty of chocolate, coffee and dark fruit present. Amazingly well balanced for drinkability. I expected a better head, but it could be the condition of the glass.  I'll have to let it warm up to assess the smell, overall I'm knocked back in my shoes impressed. I've sent out for more to enjoy with the game.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,DavoleBomb,4.2,"Poured into a snifter.  4.0 A: Opaque deep purple/black color. One finger of thick medium brown head. Average retention and plenty of lacing.  4.0 S: Dark fruit stands out the most, especially prune. Then medium roasted coffee and semi-sweet chocolate. A little bit of floral hop. Very nice.  4.5 T: It has everything that is good in an RIS and none of the bad. Everything in the nose is also in the taste. Dark fruits (PRUNE BOMB!), chocolate (still going with semi-sweet) and medium roast coffee. There is also a buttery diacetyl aspect from molasses I assume. There is no solvent-like taste or overly harsh burnt taste. Very very nice.  4.0 M: Full bodied. Plenty creamy, but a little undercarbonated for my liking.  4.0 D: Damn good. Best RIS I've had thus far. Also BY FAR the best beer I've had from a can (I've also had Old Chub).",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,mattcrill,4.21,"Much thanks to Hardtarget for the gift and the chance to sample this tasty treat!  Aroma: Sharp roasted grains, grassy, and floral hop notes. Light dark fruit notes and some alcohol heat warms the nose. More dark fruit and leafy hops as the beer warms up.  Appearance: Jet black pour with a thick sudsy head.  Flavor: Dark fruity esters, moderate chocolate notes, and big grassy hop flavors. The hops are definitely in charge until it warms up a bit and my palate gets used to this flavor onslaught. Finish is bitter and dry.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, moderately low carbonation, a slight roasted grain astringency, and alcohol warming on the palate.  Overall impression: A big, hoppy, American slant on an RIS. I would have this in my regular rotation if it were available. The hops and alcohol would make this something I'd only have once in a session but this is a full flavored palate pleaser.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,roopy40,4.35,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a snifter.  A - Can you say, ""I just got inked by an octopus.""? Black and ink-like in appearance and color. Dropped this into a pint glass without holding back much on the pour. This allowed for a decent head to form which I didn't get much of when I had this the first time. Dungeony lace formed all around the glass.  S - Smell of dark, rich roasted coffee, marvelous chocolate and anise.  T - Coffee! Dark roasted malt! Necco wafers.  M - Smooth and silky at first, then a slap of carbonation, hop bitterness and alcohol at the end. Full-bodied.  D - Not by any means a session beer (10 ABV), but I end up buying a 4 pack every time I pick it up because one isn't enough. Do yourself a favor and spread these out and savor them. You'll enjoy it more and not fall down enjoying one too many. Great beer for the price and ABV.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Bung,4.42,"Poured black, very opaque with ruby around the top edge. Just about zero head, just a few brown bubbles. Roasted malt, roasty coffee, chocolate and port aromas, excellent. Real nice full body, forms a film on the sides of the glass as I tilt it. Roasty malt, coffee and bakers chocolate flavors, the smell doesn't lie. Finish clean with some lingering cafe mocha. Drinkable, with the alcohol non-existant. A big beer with a nice balance of malt and hops. The only thing I would say could improve this would be slightly more carbonation, which could make it more creamy than oily. Still deserving of the good reviews. In the top 10 non-barrel aged Imperial Stouts.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Expertly charred malts, chocolate galore, heavy roast coffee, and hints of pine. There are nice undertones of vanilla spice and roasted nuts.  Flavor doesn't dissapoint. Massive dark malt complexity of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, dark caramel, scorched sugar, raisin and dried plum. There's ample hop bitterness with a pleasant pine and earthy herbal/balsalm finish. Very complex and rich.  The body is massive and thick. Viscous even. Uber creamy and slick on the palate. Chewy and dense. Drinkability is good for a beer this powerful because I want more!

No doubt a quality, very flavorful, super creamy mouth feel Stout. The review can pretty much end there.  That said, could there possibly be a hint of ""can"" in it? I mean, is it scientifically, chemically possible for the beer to pick up some essences of metalic flavor from the aluminum can, or would it merely be mind over matter? As with other reviewers, I am only left wondering if there would be any discernable difference (i.e. improvement if there's room for any) if this brew came from a glass bottle.

Taste is a little bitter up front like drinking straight chocolate syrup followed by coffee undertones. Very thick beer, possibly the thickest I've ever had. Covers up the alcohol very well. I don't think I could drink more than one or two of these because of the thickness but it's flavor is so good I'd love to try.

2681,34483,argock,4.38,"Poured from 12oz can into a clear pint glass. Single purchased from Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $3.10.  A: As black as any RIS I have had and pours thicker than any other beer I have had. Head is 2-finger thick with a tan, baking German chocolate cake appearance with good retention and formations of lace are present down the glass.  S: Strong scents of dark bittersweet chocolate, espresso, black licorice, molasses, and leafy hops  T: Definitely allow plenty of warming prior to tasting, but this is an extremely thick, chewy, flavorful RIS. Roasted dark malts are met with big flavors of bitter dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, licorice, and molasses with punch of leafy, earthy hops with a citrus zest. A light metallic, mineral aftertaste is present when a little cool and fades when more warming occurs.  M: Thick and chewy with low carbonation and surprisingly lush feel.  D: The drinkability is exceptional for its ABV and IBUs. Warming is important to avoid the metallic aftertaste, but with patience, this is a complex, full-flavored RIS.

I have been hearing good things about this brew and has been told that I must get into it soon. Love the can concept and was very excited to see a pitch black motor oil come pouring out to leave a nice head that only stuck around for a bit. I should have known from the dark as night look that I was in for a sensational ride. A slightly bitter, great hoppiness, smooth & creamy sip was one I dragged out as long as I could. The beer got better as it warmed up a bit and the last sip was greatly missed. Slight alcohol grab at the finish which lets you know that it is not just dark chocolate and caramel that lace this brew.

Had it on tap at Father's Office, once the Deschutes Abyss tap ran out, but not to worry, this one can, and did, hold a candle to that fine libation.  A - Thick black, not unlike motor oil, with brown hues, and a standard tan head that holds very well.  S - Roasted coffee beans, chocolate, dates  T - Incredibly creamy, especially the first few sips, combined with the dense head. Beautiful coffee flavor, with hints of mocha, and definitely cinnamon.

The color and head is similar to other russian imperial stouts that I have had, however, this seemed a bit over-carbonated at first.  The smell and taste are both surprisingly sweet, smooth, well-balanced and not-so-subtle with flavors of heavy roast, malt, cherry, and chocolate. The Ten FIDY has a great balance between the sweetness and the high ABV and is unapologetically complex.  The Ten FIDY finishes rather smoky and carbonated.

Aroma is very sweet, consisting of chocolate, coffee and caramel.  Taste follows the aroma...lots of chocolate and coffee with some caramel and toffee notes in the background. An amazingly sweet beer but not overwhelming in any regard.  Creamy and exceptionally smooth, a thick beer that coats the palate nicely. My apologies for ever saying that good beer can't possibly come from a can...clearly there are exceptions. I never would have imagined this would have been so good but I am pleasantly surprised.

A velvety smooth chocolate flavor, perhaps chocolate liquor, mixed with roasted malt, a viscous old ale sweetness, and rust. Very bold flavors. The feel is very smooth and chewy, big malty sweetness and a noticable alcohol kick.

2681,34483,ThirdLap,4.21,"Liberated this from Macktbone's (the guy four reviews below this one) fridge after he was suitably liquored up. Told him it was necessary that I review it immediately.  This is probably my tenth or twelfth Ten FIDY in the last year. Pouring it into my ever-faithful Stone IRS goblet it shows off a massively thick inch-and-a-half dark brown head that recedes after a few minutes, leaving heavy lacing and a thin foam coating that remains for some time.  Nothing really screams out on the nose, save for perhaps some dark malt. I get some coffee and sweet dark chocolate, but in all honesty I don't think anything is as pronounced as many of the other reviews would have you believe. Everything seems rather subtle and subdued.  There was nothing subdued about the taste, however. Thick, rich dark chocolate, roasty coffee notes, with a bit of dark fruits. Hops are present but not intrusive. Mrs. ThirdLap stated that she enjoys this more than Rasputin mainly due to their absence.  Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, viscous, and oily. Low to medium carbonation, and it leaves the mouth exactly the way you would expect from a chewy, viscous, and oily beer. I'm still tasting everything minutes later. Takes on a more creamy feel as it warms.  The abv is very well-hidden. I could drink these all night.  While I prefer the more hop-forward character of Old Rasputin, Ten FIDY holds its own very well. This is a very good example of the style, and the best beer I've tasted from Oskar Blues.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,dqderrick,4.5,"First off, my wife and I both loved this beer. She liked the caramel smells and flavor.  A Black with nice 1/4"" head.  S Smells sweet. Caramel. Smells amazing but light. Caramel is definitely there.  T Carmel, candy and more. I taste more candy than toasty oats. But it definitely tastes like an Imperial Stout. However, Ted Fiddy has a sweeter candy flavor that offers a distinctive caramel characteristic.  D I would drink 2, 3 or 4 of these easily. The caramel character in the flavor is amazing. I liked it as did my wife. My wife is a beer review enabler if I position it just right and this review saw some benefit of a dual input system. Cheers to Ten Fiddy fans and my wife!

Pours dark blackish oil giving the name some meaning.  The nose gives off hops dipped in chocolate; (good visual) and will be my next years christmas cookies.  I empty the glass with a vision of lace only compared to the unmentioned possibilities on the ""first night of the rest of our lives"".  The milk chocolate colored head centers itself in the glass like an ameoba weaiting to glom pseudopods onto the tongue of the unsuspecting victim of happiness and imperial joy. Mouthfeel is closer to a rich hot chocolate. Though the alcohol is present it fills the open space in your mouth rather than laying on the tongue. Noticable hops are well balanced with the baker's chocolate, malt, and molases.  This can is way more than a pack it in, pack it out novelty, it holds it's own.  The taste sits on the back of your tongue and waits for your to catch up...but when you do, you're glad you took the trip. Moments after you finish your swallow, you will notice the sweet reminents familiar to a nice square of chocolate.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The smallish tan head leaves a nice amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is rich, black/burnt malts, chocolate, coffee, licorice all come to mind with a warming and welcoming alcohol scent. The first sip shows off an astringency that is a little bit of a surprise as the aroma did not prepare me for it, it is good though! The feel is thick, slightly syrupy but does have a slick property till the end then the astringency really comes to the forefront as a charcoal feel. Flavors of burnt malt, coffee up in front of the chocolate flavors, some fruit. As it warms here alcohol seems to come out, but it mixes nicely with everything. While drinking this brew I am unaware of the alcohol% but feel it must be up there a bit, but with that being said it drinks quite well for a big beer. Very good showing for the style and overall an excellent brew.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The color of this beer in the glass is black, no light gets through this beer at all. Good head retention with moderate lacing.  S- This beer has many complex aromas. Coffee, Dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, ginger bread. Some alcohol is present as well even through the dark sweetness.  T- Dark chocolate, roasted barley and molasses. This beer is very roasty, at times its almost like eating burnt toast. There is some good sweetness up front then a wave of roasted barley then again sweet then the roasted barley comes back and sticks to your tongue. Some hops come through at the end and there is also some alcohol warmth.  M- It is not as thick as I thought it would be based on the pour. This is still a full bodied beer, quite thick, little oily. Good carbonation and hops give it some bite at the end.  Overall- This is a pretty good imperial stout. Maybe a little rough around the edges but it is still pretty good.

2681,34483,imagineiii,4.65,"Poured into my trusty DFH snifter. Black as hell at night coming out of the can. Head is almost as dark as some barleywines. Holy cow this is a DARK beer. Head has decent retention.  Smells of sweet alcohol, alot of alcohol. slight hop bitterness way at the back. chocolate malts are obvious but sweet alcohol makes it smell more like milk choc.  Smooth, creamy and thick. Wonderfully FULL bodied. Carbonation and hops really come alive in the mouth tho. some chocolate but not as much as the scent lets you believe. warming alcohol is pleasing. exceptional.  mouthfeel is wonderful if its what your expecting. this is a very full bodied and complex beer.  Not so drinkable at 10%, but amazingly smooth.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,mbunje,4.43,"12oz can poured into my trusty Sam Adams high tech glass. Can, that is right. I have heard about this many times but never realized it was in a can. As soon as I realized that I read ""Ten Fidy"" when I passed right buy, I stopped, did a double take and immediately dropped $12 for a 4 pack. Expensive? Not really considering I'll drop $7.50 for half the oz. on a high end IIPA. Enough talking....(My can says 9.5% BTW)  A - Black. Sooo Black. Head is brown. Not tan or beige. Brown. About a 1/3"" max and then recedes to a thin layer on top. Very little lacing. This thing pours thick like oil from the can. Looks serious.  S - It is serious. Coffee/chocolate/cedar....a bit of damp forest in there and hops. Slight scent of alcohol.  T - I literally took a bite of this and chewed on it a bit before swallowing. Sweet in the front, but not too much. Now I taste the roasted, earthy wood. Closing bitterness and a bit of hop derived fruit. Wow, complex.  MF - Did I mention thick? It is thick and smooth but with a nice touch of carbonation to it. Nice dry finish. A bit of alcohol burn, but less than expected at 9.5%  D - Well, at 9.5% not too many of these. But the fact it comes in a can and is so damn good at $0.40 per oz, I say it is pretty drinkable for the style.  Honestly, first time I have ever had this one. One of the best Imperial Stouts I have come across....get it if you can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Nipitato,4.28,"Purchased a can at Marty's in Newton, MA.  A: This beer pours like motor oil. Thick and dense do not accurately describe its opaqueness. Thin dark tan head.  S: Mild roast. All sorts of chocolate. Caramel malt. Not very hoppy. Dark fruits - raisins and plums. Alcohol aromas start popping as beer warms.  T: An intensely bold flavor. Slightly roasted. Some huskiness/grain on the end. Nice full bitterness throughout. Sweet with lots of dark fruits.  MF: This beer is massively thick and smooth. Alcohol warming. Lightly carbonated.  D, notes: Ten Fidy is another beer that helps cement Oskar Blues as one of the standout breweries in the United States.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,craytonic,3.5,"Appearance: Black oil. Nice lace & head. Why is it in a can?  Smell: Coffee, chocolate, roasted malt.  Taste: I did not notice any hoppy bitterness. Mostly coffee, with some chocolate (more like milk chocolate) and malt. A tad acidic.  Mouthfeel: Somehow full but thin. Something was a tad off, a tad thin for what I expected.  Drinkability: Its decent, but nothing special.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,smanders,3.88,"Served out of a dented can - 9.5%ABV  Appearance - black gold, Texas tea. Crema from a latte for a head.  Smell - I must have a cold. I didn't get too many distinctive aromas from this. I was expecting a more potent sniff.  Taste - I only wish I put a scoop of Breyer's in it. This is a malty explosion of sweetness. You'll enjoy everything from Whoppers candy, coffee, and even a little bitterness from the slightest inclusion of hops. Did I mention the warming effect from the high alcohol content. BTW BA, the can now says 9.5% instead of 10%.  Mouthfeel - almost chewy. Could be served as an appetizer because it's so rich and filling.  Drinkability - In lieu of dinner, I could easily enjoy a few of these. Fine example of an Imperial Stout...and out of a can, no less.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,rhinos00,4.32,"Poured from a 12 oz. can into a snifter.  A- Straight up looked like I was pouring motor oil out of a can. Jet black with a fingers width of tan head.  S- Combination of subtle vanilla, chocolate, sugared malts, and roasted coffee beans.  T- I was a little worried at first because the first few sips left an aluminum after taste in the mouth. However, this eventually disappeared, revealing a great tasting brew. Chocolates, molasses, and sugared malts were definitely prevalent. There was a grainy, roasted coffee finish to each sip.  M- Exactly what I look for in this style of beer. Creamy, smooth texture that is viscous by nature. Thick and chewy with all the perfect elements.  D- Highly drinkable. Not much more to add.  Overall, very impressed with the RIS out of a can. The real stand out for me was the mouthfeel. I can't remember having many RIS that had something as close as what this beer had to offer. Just a solid RIS.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bigkahunas4,4.27,"Poured from the can into a goblet. Can cracked with nearly a sound, and poured a dark chocolate black body - with no signs of any head. A molasses colored film emerged and then ran to the sides of the glass. Some better lacing than expected. Nose is fairly strong with primary notes of vanilla and a medium roast of coffee.  Brew is very creamy - certainly the first thing I noticed when it hit my lips. This isn't overly sweet, but you can taste some chocolate milk upfront - more milk than chocolate. Finish is bitter dark chocolate. While being more on the bitter side - it was very well constructed. Some like stickiness on the way down with this guy, really leaving your lips smacking for more.  Not my favorite RIS - but nonetheless very tasty. Well constructed, and I like the fact it's on the bitter side of the equation.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,brantadid,4.39,"Poured black with some dark brown/ruby highlights into a tulip. A one finger brown head formed. Not much in the way of head retention and some lacing.  Smell of burnt malt, dark fruit (cherry, fig, and dates) with a slight hop profile. A sherry like quality in the nose.  Big maltly sweetness upfront follow by big maltly sweetness. Chocolate, burnt coffee, dark fruit, and hops. Hops only bitter the beer.  Mouthfeel is heavy. Lower carbonation only lends to it. Viscous body and well masked alcohol makes this one of the more drinkable RIS.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Bittersweet, vanilla, and a bite of alcohol with a touch of hops that finishes nicely.  Smooth and creamy this is definitely my kind of stout.  One to keep coming back to.

2681,34483,Ezekiel81923,3.91,"Found single cans at Capone's in Norristown.  Appearance: Normal pour into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass yielded a small, 1/2 finger tan head with little retention. Decent lacing. The blackest of black that let through no light.  Smell: Not much aroma to it, unless you really get your nose up in it. Some chocolate notes, a touch of vanilla as well.  Taste: Some dark fruit notes, as well as chocolate notes, dark roasted malt notes, vanilla, maybe a little coffee bean flavor. Some sweetness to it that builds as it warms but is pretty well balanced with the roasted coffee backbone.  Mouthfeel: Very very smooth. Creamy. Thick. The best part of this particular beer.  Drinkability: As with most, if not all stouts, its a sipper. Pretty filling, but I could definitely have more than one in a sitting.  My first taste of what Oskar Blues has to offer, and I'm impressed. One of the better RIS's i've had.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,omnigrits,4.4,"Wow. I thought I'd found all I could ever find in a stout or a porter until I tried this one. When I see it coming out of the tap it reminds me of The Beverly Hillbillies - ""Black gold, Texas tea. Well the next thing you know old Jed's a millionaire"". This stuff is black, black, black!!! Very dark brown head that subsides quickly but leaves plenty of lacing. It shouts ROASTED MALT at you from ten feet away. It's like drinking an old ash tray, but in a good way. Somewhat sweet. Almost no carbonation. It really is like motor oil. Liquid engineering. I couldn't drink more than one of these in a session, but that's the way it should be. You don't drink port all night, you finish off the evening with it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,PDXHops,3.57,"Thanks to the generous LIF from jasonjlewis, I'm getting to give this one a try.  A very aggressive pour straight into the middle of my tulip glass yields about a finger's worth of dark tan head that disappears to a skim in short order, but still leaves pretty decent lacing. Underneath is an imposing body the color of used motor oil- dark as hell.  The smell isn't very powerful, but there's a nice blend of chocolate chip cookies, vanilla and dark roasted malts. Incredibly viscous and velvety mouthfeel, and it's pretty tasty, too. Dark roasted malt, big chocolate flavors, bit of vanilla, bit of coffee, dark fruits and a lingering alcohol warmth. Increasing sweetness as it warms is probably the only thing that will keep me from seeking this out on a repeat basis.  Overall impression: The crazy mouthfeel alone makes this an easy recommendation.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,JayQue,4.38,"Wow!!! A very impressive RIS. Pours like well used motor oil, black with no hint of light coming through. A hard pour gives a nice size dark tan head that hangs in there about average for a 10% beer. Huge sheets of lacing down the glass. The lacing holds the same color as the head, dark tan.  Smell is pretty good, sweet, malty with a hint of vanilla.  Taste is outstanding: malt, sweet milk chocolate, toffee, vanilla and roasted coffee finish. There is no hint of the high abv. The sweetness merges into the overall rich and slightly oily mouthfeel, so the sweetness is never too much. The coffee in the finish adds a little bitterness.  The rich, creamy mouthfeel with a bit of slickness adds as much as the taste to the overall quality of this beer.  Drinkability is very good. I have had this beer before but have always opted for a second one, which made a review a moot point!!!  An excellent RIS...a must-have experience.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SteveO1231,4.88,"Picked up a can at Table & Vine in West Springfield, Mass. I had seen craft beers in can but never really took them seriously. I'd been hearing all about this Ten Fidy business and decided to check it out.  Pours a Wesley Snipes with a thick as balls mocha colored foamy head that leaves excellent lacing. Beautiful wall of cascading microscopic bubbles flow to the top of the glass.  Aroma of charr, dark chocolate, roasted malts, dark roasted crystal malts, dark fruit (prunes) a touch of black coffee and a hint of dry oak.  Mouthfeel is full bodied with a slick texture, very smooth.  Very nice flavor in this beer, sweet caramel/toffee flavor up from briefly with an overwhelming flavor in roasted malts, & creamy milk chocolate (Hershey's Kisses). The finish is nice, black patent (charred marshmallow) that is very subtle and not overpowering accompanied by a sting from the ABV. Dry with a black coffee after taste.  Overall this brew is OUTSTANDING! extremely smooth and drinkable Impy Stout despite high ABV.  Cheers!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,schroederm,4.38,"A - very dark, nice dark tan head S - full bodied smell, a little nutmeg, a little oak, plenty of chocolate and coffee T - great maltiness, finishes into a really nice hoppy bitter. i would have enjoyed a little more chocolate in the taste, but what was there was nice M - good carbonation, thick, silky... D - quite drinkable, above average for the style  Overall: Ten TIDY is a great beer, especially for the price. Don't let the can fool you - this RIS competes with the best of them.

D: I've got to enjoy Ten Fidy a couple times before but just scored a 4 pack from bhalter8 (thanks again Ben!) and thought I should review it. I wish I could get this stuff around here.

2681,34483,sonicdescent,3.97,"One of the few out of region brews that we are lucky enough to have in the Pittsburgh area.  Appearance is a very dark and viscous looking brew. Carbonation was not present when opening the can, but managed to pour it into a small head anyway that gave way to a crown with decent lacing.  Nose is a lot of chocolate up front, toffee, caramel, and cream. Very nice in hiding the alcohol.  Taste is pretty good, disguising the alcohol well but surprisngly not very bold. The same tastes are what was present in the scents.  Mouth is great, pretty heavy in body and light in carbonation.  Drinkability is good as I would have this again, and it's novel to have a high quality brew in a can, however for your Russian imperial stouts, I may shop around a bit.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,discovolante65,4.5,"First of all, this nasty SOB slapped me across the face with ink when I cracked it open. Sprayed my counter and my keyboard with its contents. I guess I've never cared because I haven't had something leave a stain so noticeable before.  Truly aggressive pour, like dumping out an ab from last summer that was left there by your brother in law when he borrowed your cooler. I was ignorant because I think the Duvel bulb allows you to be. I wanted to slam the gas pedal on this one as soon as I saw a 10% ABV RIS in a can. As if someone threw you the keys to their Camaro after they somehow managed to wedge a Ferrari under the hood. I was daring this fucker to make a move.  I know the appearance on this is none other than oil can contents, its no coincidence. I got a good inch and a half head on it that retreated within a minute or so. nice bubbles. reminds me of making barbeque sauce and forgetting to stir after you put in the molasses. it has some nice lacing, it looks like the curtains were dyed with buckets of coffee. Sumatran or Jamaican brewed strong. smell is at first chocolate and then some caramel, burnt/malty smell at the end of the snuff. Coffee grounds in a handful of milkduds.  For the chocolate smell you get up front, it's really non-existent in the taste. The taste is strong coffee with a little burned something or other. I have to say that I somehow get licorice as it falls off my tongue. Right near the back of my tongue, and before I swallow, I can sense black licorice. Odd. I have either never detected that or couldn't put my finger on it from a RIS before, but that's what it is. I still get some milk dud, but its on the third sip and its surrounded by coffee and whispers the word ""alcohol"" on the way down my throat.  Not as heavy as I anticipated, but this didn't disappoint me. For everything else this was, it went down really easy. I was quite shocked at how delightfully thin it was.  Drinkability? you bet your ass. this stuff is an instant favorite. I got it in a mixer because a friend purchased a four-pack, raved about it, and then the douchenozzle never shared one. I could see myself having more than one. Shit ,I drank half of it writing this, oops. I truly can't decide if two is too much, or if I can go for another. I have a solution, I only purchased one because I wanted to try some other winter ales that I hadn't seen before. oh well, I will be buying more.  How in world do they get this level of deliciousness into a can on a consistent basis? I have had Dale's and Old Chub before, and now this. I am truly blown away by OBB. Thank you for letting me enjoy more than a hockey game on a cold Tuesday night.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bluemoonswoon,4.44,"Thanks to xpimptastikx for including this in our trade. 12oz can poured into my Duvel tulip.  Scary to see such a thick beer come out of a can, really threw me for a loop. Looks much like the Founders Imperial Stout, though the head remains a bit thicker but lasts just as long as the previous beer did. Not bad by itself, but there are so many prettier RISs out there.  Smell is a bit of phenols, cinnamon appears to be a player in this boquet. Not as hoppy as I was anticipating from a semi west-coast beer. Large amounts of caramel and butterscotch candy, so much so that the chocolaty aromas appear to be more of a compliment, rather than the main focus.  I'm really taken back by how absurdly malty this beer is. Yes it does display some characteristic hop fruitiness in the first few sips but they quickly die off and are replaced by a smooth and coating chocolate malt sweetness. I swear there is even a bit of pumkin pie spicy and sweetness mixed in with all the chocolate and caramel and butterscotch as well. One of the milder (so to speak) imperial stouts I've had recently. Much more malt focused than I ever would have anticipated.  I'm just glad that smell doesn't factor in that highly when compared with the overall score because this beer has a lot more to offer than looks. The aroma sort of reminds me of a dopplebock mixed with an imperial stout, the maltiness is that pronoucned. The alcohol is well hidden at 10% really only comes through in a mild warmth toward the middle and end of each sip. Meanwhile the intense roastiness, balanced by an epic malt sweetness make this an intensly quaffable brew. Glad I have more than one, but sadly only one left.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,DwnTwnBwn,4,"Appearance - Poured into a goblet out of a can. Black as coal, 1 finger head fell quickly. Beautiful  Smell - Very Sweet smell, hints of chocolate and coffee.  Taste - Very strong stout flavors. Starts very sweet then rushes into roasted chocolate and coffee. Very dark roasted flavors almost burnt flavors. Leaves a Toffee sweetness lingering. If there is any bitterness, it is not perceived.  Mouth feel - Thick. Very Smooth. Buttery but not enough to let the flavors pass bye. Leaves a brown hue on the glass after each sip.  Overall -This is a was a very complex and strong Stout. Its a sipper through and through. The flavors are almost to much, and it seems that time would be in its favor. But nothing is overpowering. Very Good Russian Imperial Stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ColForbinBC,4.3,"On-tap at TJ's in Paoli, served in a snifter  Appears an almost midnight black with a thick chocolate color head. No light is getting through this guy. It looks awesome in a snifter. A very little bit of lace is left behind.  A very pungent nose of cocoa powder, dark Belgian chocolate, coffee beans, and very mild grassy hops. A large overhang of alcohol leads me to believe this is going to be a huge beer.  Yup, just what I thought. A big huge beer that is surprisingly well-balanced. Roasted, slightly charred malt profile, chocolate and caramel. A small amount of dark fruits and a decently strong grassy, earthy hop profile. A long, lingering alcohol burn is noticeable.  Thick and creamy. A very huge beer.  This was one of the slowest beers I have ever drank. A nightcap indeed. The 10% abv is big and omnipresent throughout this experience.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,aeminter,3.73,"OMG! For a second I thought I was changing the oil in my old farm truck. This stuff is so black you can see time and space bend around the glass. There is a dark tan almost chocolate brown head that flattens quickly.  The aroma is very rich and inviting at first pour, but it calms far too fast. There is little to no lingering aroma to get a hold of, but my first impression was of something rich, decadent and almost Christmasy (brown sugar and spice).  The taste is smoky (almost a Rauchbier quality), mild hop, and a little licorice.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,sevopie,4.7,"Appearance - I totally agree with what others have stated, this looks like motor oil coming out of a beer can. Black with the slightest hints of brown on the edge. Darkest head I have ever seen in a thick brown mess - though there's very little of it even with an aggressive pour.  Smell - Smells a bit like a sweet rum mixed with some Chocolate. There's a tiny bit of coffee and even something I can only think is raisins.  Taste - Hmm... Chocolate, coffee, licorice, raisins, and toffee jump out you, and even the rum makes a slight appearance in flavor (perhaps I have rum on the mind or something... I sware its there though!) The bitter is very well masked in this one by the wide array of flavors, its only when you try to describe it to someone to you realize you have to include the bitter in there. (I let my girlfriend try it... bad idea.)  Mouthfeel - Viscous. Thick. Motor Oil? Despite there being very little in the way of a head, the carbonation is definitely present, though properly subdued.  Drinkability - If it wasn't for the in your face alcohol kick, this would get straight 5s. Its just a little too much to make this an ""easy-drinking"" beer. That being said, its still a very approachable RIS, and one that needs no help in finishing (unless you are trying to finish the whole 4-pack.) I'm not the biggest RIS fan, but this is one helluva brew.  Note: Check out your glass after you take a sip. This brew turns the side of the glass brown for a minute. Talk about thick. If there was such a term to describe it, I would borrow one from wine-lingo: legs.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Onibubba,4.68,"Finally got a chance to try this beer and it does not dissappoint. Pours with a gorgeous head so dark creamy and luxurious it is had to distinguish from the black oily body. Smell is dark chocolate with some coffee notes and this is echoed in the taste. No bitterness nor soy sauce offness detected at all. The body is pure Oskar Blues goodness - crushed black velvet in a glass. The alcohol becomes more than appearant as it warms, but this is a 10% impy stout - that is to be expected. An oily film is left in the glass as a testimony to the power contained within. All I was hoping for and more. A contender with Speedway Stout for the best Imperial Stout I have ever tried. Simply amazing",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,IrishRedRock,4.43,"I laughed just a little as I poured this...a RIS in a can? I hope this trend continues. The top pops with little, if any, hints at carbonation. Upon pouring though, a frothy, brown head develops atop this viscous, black liquid. It's black, and the head is one of the darkest ones I've seen. After a few sips it yields to a ring of lace around the glass.  I get a lot of coffee in the aroma, charred malt and plums, raisins as well. The flavor has got all of that, in addition to layers of bittersweet dark chocolate and a resinous hop bitterness. Damn. Chocolate/dark fruit sweet leads to a lot of hop bitterness that lingers in the finish with the alcohol. A really stellar Imperial Stout.  Oksar Blues continues to impress me with their beers. This is now their fourth beer I've sampled from a can, and every one of them has been excellent. Strong stout lovers should seek this out.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MacDomer,4.37,"Got this one in a trade with fellow BA brewandbbq - big thanks for this one!  Poured this into my Duvel tulip. I like the bowl size on this glass for a stout, but I really need a snifter...  Love the can. Cracked it open and poured out motor oil. Wow this is thick. Dark black, with a minimal burnt brown sugar colored head, even with an aggressive pour. A few swirls and again, this is nice and thick.  The aromas coming from the glass can be smelled from several feet away. This has an awesome and strong nose. Loads of espresso, licorice, and toffee, and tons of dark roasted malts, followed by a nice boozy quality. Man, this smells great. I might just sit here with my nose in the glass all night! Post beer comment: I actually found the aroma rather overwhelming by the end of the beer.  Taste is not as much of a wow for me as the nose, but it's damn good! Great, even. Big roastiness, dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, and a hint of licorice to finish things up. Light on the boozy quality, actually, relative to the nose.  Mouthfeel on this is quite nice. Very smooth and creamy. Light carbonation. Long finish.  This has been a real treat. I couldn't drink a lot of these in a session, but I will certainly seek it out to get more. In fact, I have a trip to L.A. in a few days and I've already checked out Beerfly and found a spot to get more of this one. Looking forward to drinking two and letting two sit for a year or so to see what happens.  An odd note on this one, to finish my review. On my third sip, I caught a bit of this thick, gooey, dark black sludge right on my lower lip but it squirted out onto my shirt. What the hell? This was like some slimey black snot that must have come out of the dredges of the can. Honestly, for about a quarter of the beer, this weired me out, and I even thought about pouring the rest through a seive to make sure it was the last bit of it, but after a while I just forgot about it and just carried on. Looking back, pretty funnny, especially the nice spot on my shirt...",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Cyberkedi,4.2,"Pours a deep, opaque sable with minimal, fine-bubbled tan head. Rich, mocha-like aroma is just a bit sweet and a little smoky, and very appetizing. Superb coffee and chocolate flavor is mouth-filling and delicious, smoky and lively. Texture is thick and tingly so it satisfies on the way down the pipes.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,taylorhamrick,4.51,"Pours ink black, with a bit of a satin sheen. The head is dense and dark brown. Great lacing and retention. This looks just perfect. Smells like sweet chocolate and alcohol. Good smells for an RIS, nothing outstanding or out of the ordinary. Oftentimes a good thing. The taste is great. The first taste is a bit harsh, but then the sweetness comes forward. You get the bitter roasted barley taste, the sweet chocolate taste, and a kick of alcohol. Again, there aren't really many out of the ordinary tastes, like licorice or fruit, at least not in the obvious places. You can find them if you search. The flavor is really well executed for the style, and the alcohol and any harsh flavors it may carry along are held in check. Really great complexity. I would never call this one-dimensional, but it doesn't try too hard or get muddled. I could really sit and savor this beer, but I just want to go back for more. I feel lucky to have another can, and can't wait for it to finally hit the shelves in Charleston full-time.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,badbeer,3.74,"Black color with a brown head that retains well and has excellent lacing. Smell has plenty of molasses and hops. Quite roasty in the nose as well.

I could see myself getting more of this.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,misterdmac,3.9,"Poured from the can into my 16oz. snifter at around 54 degrees.  A: This beer pours as thick as any I've seen, literally has the appearance of low viscosity motor oil. Thick 1-finger head leaves a light lacing.  S: Nose is a delicate, sweet dark and chocolate maltiness, with a faint alcohol. Robust aeration releases some dark fruits.  T: Sweet chocolatiness up front with a dark, bitter finish. I don't know if that's an anise spice in there toward the back, but the transition from sweet to bitter is REALLY nice.  M+D: I frankly was very surprised after the pour at how drinkable this beer was. That's not to say, however, that it's at all quaffable. Thick and syrupy on the tongue but not on the back of the throat. Thin carbonation propagates the viscous flavors nicely, but I'm probably looking to move on after twelve ounces of this bad boy.  Overall a great selection for the start of a Christmas evening. Drink it slow, and it opens up in some style as it warms.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,angelmonster,4.08,"Poured into a snifter at the flying saucer. Nice dark chocolate inch head with a pitch black body. Very good lacing through out.  Smells mostly of roasted, chocolate malts , faint hops and bits of alcohol. Expected more of an alcohol smell since its 10 % abv but it smells very sweet  Taste is a rich, sweet, chocolate cream with low medium bitterness. Alcohol is also present but not over powering.  Mouth feel is a nice balance of carbonation. Some bitterness is present but the creamy head does balance it out a bit.  Ten fidy does a nice job of masking the alcohol while keeping true to the IBU's of an imperial stout , while also providing a rich flavor to balance it all out. Would buy again , especially in the winter. I love this beer",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Smell: Loads of dark roasted coffee and chocolate. Some minty hops and touch of molasses in the background.  Taste: Roast coffee upfront, followed by dark chocolate. Behind the Roast - dark fruit flavors. Black Currant and raisin flavors show up. In the finish - sweet roastiness, minty hops,and liquorice in the background.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, viscous, with a low carbonization.  This is one heck of a complex beer. This may go down as my favorite Russian Imperial Stout to date.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,EPICAC,3.96,"Pours a viscous, deep, opaque black. Topped by a half-inch, dark brown head that fades to a film, leaving good lace. The aroma is fairly light overall. Roasted malt aromas, chocolate, dark fruit, and a hint of molasses.  Sweet and chocolate tinged malts upfront. The center is dominated by dark fruit, with notes of raisins and prunes, over a sharp molasses and boozy backbone. There's a nice roasted bitterness in the finish, as well as an alcoholic spiciness. Thick and full-bodied, with prickly carbonation.  Maybe it's been awhile since I had a RIS, but this seems a bit sweeter than most. Still a good beer, and a great dessert beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SkeeterHawk,3.77,"Appearance: After a relatively aggressive pour, there was a very small head of reddish tan bubbles. There are some bubbles rising, but the beer is thick and it seems to be a tough journey for the little bubbles.  Aroma: Lots of chocolate and dark roast along with tons of toasty notes that seem to be Munich malt derived. The dark roast malts make the nose think that this beer is going to be somewhat acidic when drank. There is definitely a good bit of hops in this beer with some green, almost grassy notes deep within the beer, but the malt is in charge of the aroma.  Taste: The flavor is bold, and this is my first beer of the evening. It has a whole lot of fruitiness that I didn't get so much in the nose. There is some dark fruit, like plums, in particular. The alcohol is definitely present, and the beer warms you up from the first sip. The alcohol isn't hidden all that well as is quite warming. It is some far off recollection, but it is reminding me of some of the liqueurs, like Jaegermeiser with the fruitiness from the fermentation, and the spiciness and warmth from the alcohol. It is quite the bold beer.  Opinion: As I mentioned above, this beer is quite bold. It has a whole lot of flavor and big alcohol, so this one is hard to miss. This can isn't all that carbonated, so it would be good to try this beer on tap when properly served. So far, it is a pretty good beer, but it could definitely use some more carbonation to soften the overall presentation. Either way, a good beer, and I would drink it again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,AustinBeerLvr,4.1,"Tried this on tap at the Draught House here in Austin, Texas.  This brew poured to a beautiful deep black color with a very dark tannish head. Excellent lacing on the glass. I asked the bartender what temperature they serve their beer, and he said all beers are served at 42 degrees. Because of this, my first sniff of this brew was a lot of alcohol, as the cold temperature numbed the flavors. I took one sip and it reaffirmed my expectation that it would be way too cold for the style....  I let it warm up a good 10 minutes before my next sip (in other words, as cold as anybody should drink a Russian Imperial Stout).  S: Nose of this brew is a very potent blend of cocoa, chocolate, a little caramel, and nice dose of well blended alcohol. Hop bitterness is definitely there, but I couldn't exactly pinpoint what hints they were giving off.  T&M: Huge complex malt character up front, comprised of dark chocolate, caramel, molasses, some burnt smoky hints. Alcohol is very present, but at 10% ABV, blends very nicely with the huge malt character of this huge brew. Some lightly fruit like esters make there way through, before a very pleasantly surprising silky smooth malt flavor proceeds the bite of the hops and alcohol at the end. As expected, mouthfeel is very thick and creamy, but at the same time very silky smooth.  D&Notes: I think this is the biggest beer I have ever polished off one pint of. Indeed, this one awesome brew, meant to be consumed very slowly, with small, thoughtful sips (I took one hour to finish the pint). Obviously, at 10%ABV, one of these is plenty, but this beer is by no means just another big beer to try to satisfy beer geeks. Yes, it's a huge beer in every aspect, but it is superbly balanced, especially when taking its ABV into consideration, and as warming as can be. That said, a word of caution, as this brew definitely sneaks up on you in a hurry!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,sweetbrew82,4.4,"Poured from a 12 oz. can into my pint glass: No freshness date to be found  P: Evacuates the can an almost inky black color that doesn't let much light through upon pour. As expected, the dangerous-looking liquid sits opaque black in the glass. An aggressive pour produces a 3 fingered head of thick, dark brown head that fades to a thin ring of bubbles around the top of the glass, with some nice lace on the sides of the glass.  A: Smells of roasted malts; mainly chocolate, coffee, nuts, slight caramel, burnt sugar, a nice helping of vanilla, and alcohol. This smells damn good for what I'm assuming is a really fresh RIS. It packs quite the potent punch that strikes my nostrils with power and strength to spare!  T: Wow! This is a fucking sugar bomb! Hits the palate with boatloads of sweetness from the roasted malts that scream flavors of creamy fudge & coffee, while the vanilla intertwines nicely with the molasses. Also, a subdued, but noticeable alcoholic flavor comes through at the midway point, along with roasted nuts and dark fruits. It does a good job of staying in balance, and warms up the throat and chest with each and every swallow. Subtle notes of caramel join the mix in the dry finish that leaves pools of vanilla and chocolate soaking on the tongue for quite a long while. Pretty damn tasty!  M: Ten Fidy is full-bodied for sure. It feels viscous in the mouth, yet manages to pull off a silky-smooth touch. Slick, oil-like, and bordering on syrupy without crossing the line.  D: Let's just say that I wish these cans came in six-packs instead of four. I surprised myself at how fast 12 oz. of this stuff disappeared. I was starting to think that someone was siphoning beer out of my glass.  Notes: A very solid RIS, for sure. Very tasty and easy drinking for a high ABV beer. But, the best part of this beer, in my opinion, is the mouthfeel. It feels so damn good that you just can't wait to treat your tongue to some more! Sorry Old Rasputin, but you've just been replaced as the RIS that will be regularly stocked in my fridge.

Full, velvety mouthfeel. Taste is unbelievably good. Loads of dark and milk chocolate blended perfectly with strong, black coffee. Its tempered by the sweeter caramel malt and roasted oats. Its like eating a rich chocolate cake, while having a strong coffee and finishing it with a nice single-malt. I'm in love with this beer.

S - Very potent nose - noticeable traces of roasted and chocolate malts. There is some phenolic notes in the background.  T - Starts off light and smooth. Some bitterness, but primarily it is a roasted malt flavor. Finishes with a hard flourish of chocolate. A sweet finish. A hair of alcohol bite in the aftertaste.  M - Thick and creamy. Coats the mouth - very clingy. The carbonation is light, resulting in a smooth texture.  D - This beer can knock your socks off if you aren't paying attention - I've been there. It is an excellent end of the night beer, or as a desert beer. Or perhaps in a single beer sitting. Flavors and ""fillingness"" are not overwhelming.  An incredible beer.

2681,34483,jbphoto88,3.88,"Interesting, I've never had a stout in a can let alone an imperial one. It starts with the familiar sound of a can of beer opening but without the CO2 psshhtt, it's just the can seal cracking. The beer pours like piping hot melted dark chocolate. The appearance is like used motor oil and despite the lack of psshhtt there is still a nice head that lasts for a little while. It scatters to nothing but a thin collar of milky coffee around the edge of the glass.  The smell is interesting but not as impressive as I was hoping. It smells slightly muted for being an imperial stout. There is a dark malt scent with a bittersweet cocoa aroma. Still slightly indistinct for being such a big beer and it doesn't really improve that much as it warms.  Taste is ok for a stout. There is a smooth feel with a mix of dark beer flavors that range from chocolate to coffee and beyond. There is an excellent bitterness that really works with the malts. I find this big beer a little lacking in the flavor department, however where it shines is the aftertaste. After the liquid goes down there is a fine roasted malt flavor that is nicely smoked with a bright bitterness after the fact. I am not a fan of the initial flavor but it ends fantastically.  Amazing feeling to this brew. It is thick and smooth with a subdued carbonation that really lets the darker flavors shine and doesn't strip the taste off your tongue. The aftertaste of this beer is all that I love in beer. It is better then the actual flavor of the liquid and its due to the viscus nature of this one. It sticks to your palate and coats with a lasting flavor that really redeems the beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,birchstick,4.25,"I picked this up at Liquor Max this summer and have been hoarding it since.  A - poured black with the brownest head I have seen on a beer  S - very heavy chocolate tones with a little burnt malt character.  T - as the nose suggested, this is chocolaty--tastes like a mix of very rich bakers and dark chocolate. On the finish there are burnt malts and coffee, but they are not as dominate as the chocolate taste. Also, this thing started off really hot and the alcohol noticeably subsided after the first couple of drinks. Once Ten Fidy warmed, it became one of the better RIS's I have had, however it is extremely rich in the chocolate department.  M - medium-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation  D - once Ten Fidy warmed a bit it became quite delicious. Although I gave it a 4 for drinkability, it is hard to have more than a couple if you want to stay sober. One of the better RIS's I have tried.

Poured into a Duval tulip a pitch black, almost brown, with a two-finger cocoa brown cap. Good head retention with mild carbonation. When the head goes, it's gone.  The smell is roasty dark malts, coffee and chocolatte...and I do mean Latte. The alcohol comes through just a teeny bit as it warms.  The taste is great, lots of roasty coffee, some licorice, burnt wood, and soothing chocolate with pleasant sweetness. A little push from the alcohol, from start to finish, keeps things rolling along and adds to the balance. For the potency of this brew, the alcohol fits in well and doesn't seem hot. I could see this brew ageing just fine however.  The body is medium, the carbonation subtle...for having an ABV of 9.5%, this stuff drinks like a champ. Thoroughly enjoyable!

Anyhow, this is the awesome can ever. Pours nearly as excellent as it's packaged, deep dark completely opaque blackness with a respectable, but short-lived, head.  Smells great, easily among the premier RISes. Heavy esters of wood, light chemical ethanol, raisins, dark red wine, cacoa, and burnt malt.  Tastes great, not quite as smooth and well-rounded as it smells but still great. Starts with lightly sweet, pleasantly mushroomy taste (odd, I know, but good). This moves into a woody middle with lots of raw porter malt and bitter dark chocolate, which slides into an end of alcohol zing and dry red wine. The hops are huge but not really present until the aftertaste. I'm drinking this at room temp but my guess is that it'd seem hoppier chilled.  It's a wonderful party going on inside this glass but you might not want to park your car right out front, if you get my drift.

A two finger dark tan head erupts then subsides to a sticky foam lacing in a few minutes.  Aroma is mainly metallic (sorry, Oskar Blues, but all your beers smell metallic to me when they come out of the can). There is a slight sweet roast malt smell as well.  Thick as a milkshake and a little prickly from carbonation. Nice.  Flavors: deep roasted malt. Slight smoke. Some coffee style bitterness on the finish. A little granular and chocolatey as well. ABV not a significant component of the flavor.  This beer is almost undone by a nasty metallic taste. What's up with that? I'd love to have this on draft for comparison, as it seems to be a really good beer aside from this metallic issue (that is shared with Old Chubb and Dale's Pale Ale as well). Luckily, this faded as the beer sat in the glass a little while. It never fully went away, though.

So dark that it's black liquid with a massive head of chocolate colored foam, produced from a medium pour. Amazing retention and great lacing.  Big chocolate and coffee notes mixing with sweet maltiness make this one truly inviting nose. Mild woody notes and a slight hoppiness. Hints of leather and caramel.  Lots of dark chocolate flavor combines with dark roasted coffee beans. Bite of liquorice. Taste/smoothness of oatmeal. Leather shows up in the taste, also. Hint of vanilla and some charred oak. Slight hoppy bite at the end.  Big, thick and oily in the mouth. As an Imperial Stout should be. Excellent.  This is an excellent brew.

At 98 ibu's it has incredibaly smooth bitterness, not harsh or up in your face.  Since it has 10% abv you can't have more than a couple of these so although it is smooth, it is potent!

The deep brown liquid spewed forth and stained my carpet, provoking me to cuss and say some things I shouldn't have said. I grab the Spot Shot and take care of business before the wife gets home.  Now the pour...  Holy GOD! This beer pours blacker than any liquid I've ever seen come from a bottle or can. It's literally *jet* black, supporting a two finger crown the color of cocoa powder. It settles over time, and laces mildly.  Smell- If hops came in a chocolate scent, I mean really fresh, wet West Coast hops, then this would be the benchmark beer. It's loaded with aromas of coffeebeans, chocolate, hops, and what seems like spearmint. Outrageous.  Taste- A big, roasted malt profile plays along with the terrific hop character that begins right at the outset and last well after the swallow. The concentrated presentation is supremely balanced, a meal in itself.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Chewy and active, just enough to engage the palate and demonstrate the effectivenes of this beer's overall bigness.

2681,34483,LilBeerDoctor,3.88,"Reviewed on 3/18/08. Can. Poured oily black with hardly any head. The aroma was not very strong, but I got some chocolate, roast, and alcohol. Flavor strong in roast and citrusy hops. At some points, it tasted like I was having a stronger/thicker Gordon. This was a thick and hearty beer, definitely a slow sipper. I liked it, but it had a little too much roast/bitterness than I cared for. Also a very strong alcohol presence.  UPDATE: Had on tap at Plan B (suspect it was on nitro). It had a much larger and creamier head than from the can. Much smoother and easier to drink and there was less roastiness/bitterness than I had detected previously. Definitely prefered the on tap version, so sample on tap if you can! 7/4/8/4/16 (3.9/5)",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,CoolJosh,3.86,"Premium beer at of a can, who'd a thought?  A Magic 8 ball black, no light coming through. Pours unbelievably thick. Ring of caramel brown head which was slightly disappointing, but not enough to complain.  S Tons of Oats come through to produce a Whole Milk scent. Light scents of coffee, chocolate, and a slight bit of alcohol come through.  T Incredible oats from start to finish, With beautiful matured dark fruits. Bitter coffee and chocolate to finish. As my tasting buddy pointed out, it has a leather smokey feel and taste to it. A little bit hot.  Didn't think it was all it was cracked up to be. Have another one but I don't know how well a can will age...",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jasonjlewis,4,Had a sample of this beer.  Pours a dark dark black color with nice head and lacing.  Smell is of lots of chocolate malts with a moderate roasted characteristic.  Taste is bitter with hops to balance the intense sweetness. The chocolate malt and roasted characteristic are balanced with a minty hop aroma.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth.  The 10 % abv is not overwhelming. This is a nice RIS that I could easily drink again.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bifrostguard,3.96,"A - This is one seriously dark, sludgy thick beer. Just pouring it I am already worried about surviving putting this into my system. Tall and frothy dark tan head that hangs around for awhile. Pure black and highly viscous. Looks like something meant to be in machines not humans.  S - Surprisingly, hops are the first thing that come to mind. Chocolate, roasted malts and a slight metallic aroma.  T - Inversely to the smell, hops are no where in sight until the aftertaste and they are minimal at that. Still a very smooth and well balanced flavor. This is about as sweet as I can take with a slight alcohol presence. Roastiness, chocolate and coffee are all mild. Not an overpowering flavor but dense.  M - Very smooth and milky. It does leave a sticky sweet film and I would like a little more carbonation, but I'm coming to the realization that this is supposed to be how a highly ranked stout should feel.  D - A calorie dense beverage that feels sweeter than it is. I like this one a lot but it is a bit too much after a couple. Increasing the abv and the bitterness and I would stick with this one all night.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Chelsea1905,4.02,"Really dark with a chocolate off white head  Smells really chocolatey, with dark malt and a little bit of bourbon or alcohol in the background  Tasted like a good porter, smokey, chocolate, and then you get a hit as if you've just chased it with some shot of bourbon  Feels fine, smooth like guiness  Couldn't have much more than the pint I had!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,gabrielsyme,4.26,"Can poured in a pint glass.  Wow, this beer is intense. Pours very thick dark brown/block with chocolate brown head. It tastes almost like a cafe mocha at first, getting more bitter as the beer warms. The alcohol is differently hidden well in the taste (although i definately felt it), and i don't get as strong a roasted malt taste as i do with other stouts.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,corby112,4.44,"Served on tap at Bridgids in the Fairmount section of Philadelphia during Philadelphia Beer Week 2007.  Pours pitch black with huge foamy beige head. Malty aroma of roasted coffee, chcolate and toffee. Excellent easy drinking stout. ABV very well masked. Very complex with lots of roasted coffee and chocolate maltiness, oatmeal, toffee, caramel and a nice bitter hop finish.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JISurfer,3.81,"To quote my mother-in-law, this beer is very ""beery"". I guess that means it'll grow hair on your chest... or that other place, huh huh. Very thick malty presence, hardly any hops, but a warming feel of alcohol as it goes down your throat. You could say it's like pure dark chocolate in a bottle. Very nice on these cold nights in the VA mountains.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Strix,4.58,"Pours pitch black, small chocolate-colored head.  Smells of roasted malt.  Tastes of roasted malt with a hint of burned wood and aftertaste of dark chocolate. A big beer, yet the bitterness doesn't run away with the show. Alcohol is well masked.  Silky smooth mouthfeel, coats the mouth nicely.  Easily the best beer I've had from a can. Right up there with other great imperial stouts.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Tolnik,4.32,"When pouring this deep dark oilish looking beer into a pint glass the brown head given is quite appeasing. When it reduces to a great amount of lingerence of lacing. The aroma of cooking chocolate, smokeyness and licorice great the nose and tantilize it. While this beer has a bold and flavorful taste of cooking chocolate, toffees, and smoke. The aftertaste of alcohol stays on the tongue and roasted malts.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,vacax,4.23,"Can purchased from Ken's Pacific Park market in Aliso Viejo.  Appearance: Glop glop glop, it pours out like motor oil. Black as night The head rises rapidly toward the end of my pour in a gorgeously rich shade of milk chocolatey brown. Around half a centimeter of residual head remains clinging to the top of the beer, with dashes of lacing strewn about my glass. A beautiful beer.  Smell: Bitter chocolate, licorice, traces of alcohol, and a hint of smoke. Subdued compared to the rest of this beer.  Taste: Bold yet balanced. Chocolate and coffee are present but mild. Mildly bready and smokey. Hints of dark fruit. Lingering warming effect. Bitterness dances between hops and roastiness. Big flavors, but little stands out beyond a large roasty presence.  Mouthfeel: Chewing on silk. The epitome of lusciousness.  Drinkability: Many flavors, but none dominates. Surprisingly mild aftertaste for such a big beer makes drinking easy. This is an extreme beer, but still is quite drinkable. Works better with food though. Highly drinkable, though I wish it had something in it that made me want to savor it just a bit more.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BretSikkink,4.28,"Super dark, oily black color. Head includes large brown bubbles over a chocolate-milk colored foam. This is as dark as they come. Looks great, and the head has wonderful stick to boot.  Heavily oily, pungent, roasted nose. Definitely some chocolate, but I'm going with coffee roast for the winner here. Some piney hop resins to round it out.  As the FIDY warms, this damn thing gets to be a hell of a brew. Boom goes the chocolate; boom go the hops. All over the tongue, back and front, to the sides, stuck in the throat, backing up my nose. Tons of hop bitterness keeps the similarly large malt bill in check.  Characteristics of the flavor: chocolate-fudge, anise, tobacco, espresso, pine sap, grapefruit peel.  Solid, smooth, and hefty mouthfeel is the perfect way to impart all these delectable flavors on the palate.  It's a keeper.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Ruslanchik,4.11,"This beer came in a 12oz can with a clearly marked canning date on the bottom. (10-28-08.)  I have been to Oskar's Blues in Lyons, CO. I don't remember having this beer there. This was years ago, before they started putting their beer in cans. It's an awesome town close to Boulder and the bar is comfortable and has great live music. A good place to cool down in the middle of summer.  Anyways, the beer pours heavy and thick. (For all I know Ten Fidy is the final gravity of the beer.) It hit my glass with a plop sound. No head formed at first so I gave it a strong pour. Then, when the beer was all in the glass, the head began to overtake the beer from the top down. Very interesting behavior. The beer is dark as an overcast new-moon night and has thick, fluffy caramel colored head. Head retention is awesome and lace coats every centimeter of the glass with seemingly permanent brown fuzz. It is hard to imagine a better looking beer in this style.  The aroma is not as strong as I expected. There is no trace of alcohol and definitely no hops. There is a sweet chocolate smell, but that is about it. I'm a little disappointed in this aspect of the beer.  The taste is of lots of roasted barley. There is a pronounced burnt flavor here that leads into hop bitterness. A little more sweetness would have been nice to balance the flavor a bit. As it is, the burnt notes overpower the rest of the flavors. There is no alcohol flavor, with leaves me a little disappointed. I like for RISs to have a discernible alcohol warmth to them.  With such a heavy beer you expect that it will lay across your tongue thickly and coat your mouth with a long-lasting flavor. In this case, Ten Fidy lives up to expectations and more. There's no need to take a drink more than every few minutes because you will still be tasting it from your last drink.  There's not much need to have more than one of these. In fact, halfway through I'm already looking forward to something lighter. This beer is perfect for the winter season.  Overall, Ten Fidy is a great beer, but it is surpassed in its style by others.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ZimZamZoom,4.47,"Looked forward to trying this from a can, after unexpectedly having it on tap a couple years ago at the Brick Store. I poured the can into a chalice.  This stuff defines used motor oil. I mean it comes out thick and black. The tan head looks nice and creamy but alas does not last very long. There is a thin tan ring where beer meets glass, but no lacing at all.  There is a huge chocolate aroma to this RIS. A fair dose of alcohol warmth accompanies the chocolate. Dark roasted malt with some residual sweetness and rich dark coffee. This is all very interesting out of a can. The taste is rich with darkness, dark fruits, dark malt, dark coffee, dark bitter chocolate. Not much alcohol, and what is there blends nicely with all the other flavors. There is a wicked dryness in the finish, with bitter hops taking over along with the roasty flavors. Really I have eaten some gourmet dark chocolate that dries the mouth out in a similar fashion.  Big bodied, thick smooth and creamy. A great sipper on a cold not-yet-winter night.  There are a lot of flavors working here, it's complex and interesting and warrants some attention while drinking. I will save the remainders for special occasions, and get some more as well.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MrHungryMonkey,4.35,"Can is like 99% full - there's almost no air space. Crazy. Poured into a sniffer. This is scary-looking stuff coming out of a can. If I didn't know this was a beer there's no way I'd drink it; it looks like black motor oil... with a small light-brown head.  Nose is highly malty and full of dark fruit. Smells like a good, strong Stout.  Thick and daunting. Nice roasted notes take center stage with espresso, chocolate, bread crust, and something that tastes savory like a pot roast or some heavily-cooked beef, especially near the finish. Not very sweet, but a definite fruity/sugary sweetness is present. Nice warming smoky and woody tones linger near the finish. Very thick, very full bodied. Mild carbonation. Smoothness stops just short of velvety. Finishes slightly dry and woody.  Good, solid Imperial Stout. Delicate yet strong sweetness. Heavy emphasis on roasted malt without detrimental over-roasted sideflavors. Lighter fruit and floral notes than I typically find in strong stouts, which is a nice change of pace. No alcohol noticable; I would like to see a little more heat to dry it up and pin down the finish. Overall, Ten Fidy is an exceptional experience. I will definitely buy the next 4-pack I see.  I am so glad Oskar Blues moved into my beer-turf. Ten Fidy is amazing. I bought this can in Boston at the BBF and flew it home to find that a month later Ten Fidy was available locally. I wish more beers came in cans. The airplane-loader guys would have to outdo themselves to detriment a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jkendrick,4.58,"Appearance: Absolutely black. It ours from the can looking like it came up from the ground a bubblin' crude. This is so black that not even light escapes. The head is tight and creamy and very dark brown. There is plenty of lacing.  Aroma: Chocolate and and coffee predominate, but there is some smokiness and a bit of licorice.  Mouthfeel: Extremely thick and creamy with light to moderate carbonation.  Taste: There is a bitter chocolate taste right up front. The bitterness builds as you savor the coffee, chocolate and licorice flavors. As the primary tastes fade, the bitterness persists with a light smokiness. The alcohol warms without being overpowering.  Overall impression: This is a very bitter stout, but in a good way. The bitterness never overshadows the complexity of flavors. I want my stouts thick and this is one of the thickest, creamiest stouts I've had. Of course the 10% abv contributes to this being a sipping stout.

Toffee... Raisins... An all around great aroma...  T - Roasted and smoky characteristics are potent at the start... Those dissipate to lead in a brief sweetness that is following by the arrival of alcohol and hoppy bitterness... Quick to develop and complex...  M - Thick and syrupy... Chewy... The slightest of carbonation on the tongue... An aggressive stout that isn't afraid to show it's 10% ABV... Bitterness lingers...  D - A sipper... This is a very nice RIS...

2681,34483,allengarvin,4.47,"Just arrived in Dallas. I popped the can and poured it into a New Belgium chalice. The beer is so dark one could easily mistake it for motor oil--old oil at that, coming from the can. The nose is rich with dark, roasty chocolate notes. Now this is a beer to be savored on a cold night! A wonderful combination of malts, a good amount of chocolate, nutty toffee, a light roasty acridness. Bitterness is high but hops don't make a substantial flavor component. It's all about the malt here.  This is definitely my Christmas night beer this year, when I save something special to enjoy (hopefully in front of the gas fire, if it's cold).",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,fostwal,3.82,"This is a pretty strong beer. Now doubt about it. This is a pitch black brew. Evan the foam is bark. It has a heavy roasted chocolate and caramel odor to it. The taste is very harsh at first. Though it really mellowed out while drinking it. Not sure if it needed to breath or just warm up. Similar to a red wine. In the end, it was a heavily malted, coffee tasting beer. The mouthfeel is ok.  Overall, this is a goodbeer. Definitely better after it breathed some.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,CrellMoset,4.33,"Can from Wine Warehouse, Charlottesville, VA. Poured into a 10 oz. brandy snifter.  Appearance: Pours a thick, nasty black mess with a really dark cocoa-colored head with above-average retention - perhaps average, only, but still, very nice - that leaves similarly nice, sticky, frothy lacing. A fierce, deep, intense looking beer, mysterious almost.  Aroma: Smoke is intense on this one, charcoal-like almost, with most other notes taking a backseat. There's still plenty of coffee roast, dirty, earthy, raisins, and a faint warming alcohol note that's only released upon agitation.  Taste: Milky chocolate (with some distinct lactose-like notes), smoky toast, roasted astringencies, deep coffee with plenty of char on the roast - the malt profile on this one is through the roof complex, and it's amazing. There are hints of fruit, dark obviously, and a mild hop bitterness, and the alcohol is very well-hidden. I get a lot of ""meaty"" notes here, and as a vegetarian, that weirds me out, though I won't take off any points for that.  Mouthfeel: Ooooo, so thick, chewy, smooth, meaty. It's incredibly smooth and milky, thick without being cloying, perfectly carbonated ... everything an RIS should be.  Drinkability: Slightly better out of the can than on tap, in my opinion, much smokier and more intense. Plus, it's out of a can! I wonder how much that's factored into the various reviews. Anyway. This one's good, very good, very drinkable, very flavorful, creamy, milky, smooth, aromatic, pleasant to look at, and though the alcohol's double digits, it's expertly hidden. Highly recommended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jeffthecheff,4.63,"Poured from can into a small snifter. Darkest beer ever? Black, with a dark tan head that formed late but came up quickly when it did. One of the prettiest beers out there.  Smell is of the dark malts that make the beer, a lot of chocolate aromas going on.  Taste is straightforward: dark and heavy. The balance is great, I tasted some chocolate flavors, and there was also a bit of a hop presence that I wasn't expecting. Very sweet, this would make a great dessert.  Mouthfeel was impressive, carbonation was fitting with the style. As far as drinkability, I have to say this was perfect. Its 10%, but if I weren't rationing these beers due to its availibiltiy and cost, I could have 2-3, maybe 4. I was craving another can after this, but I restrained myself.

2681,34483,spointon,4.33,"I poured this stout from a 12oz can into a tulip pint glass.  A= This one poured a heavy jet black color with a few ruby highlights around the edges. With an aggressive pour, the light brown head started at 3/4"" and slowly settled down to nothing. Some light sheets of spotty lace down my glass.  S= Aromas of sweet malts, mild bittering hops, nutella, and lots of alcohol.  T= Similar to the smell. Lots of malty sweetness, roasty coffee, some chickory, carob, and ripe dark cherries. Smooth earthy hop presence in the middle, followed by a long mildly astringent finish. Bitter coffee aftertaste.  MF= Heavy body, slick oily mouthfeel. Carbonation was decently high despite the density of this beer.  D= An excellent Russian Imperial Stout, one of my favorites for sure.

Taste and Mouthfeel- Very nice taste overall. Just the right amount of bitterness from hops and roasted grains. Overall impression is sweet and chocolatey, but not overly so.

Head comes alive from deep within the beer mountaining up to build a three finger head. As the head falls, a thick sheet of head remains on the glass, legs for days. Smell is sweet, very fruity. Dark fruit dominates, raspberry, fig, plum covered in burnt brown sugar, mollasses and some roasty smoke. So sweet. Taste is so smooth! Begins with the tiniest bit of burnt toast before giving way to dark fruits... raspberry covered in syrup, chocolate covered raisins, old red grapes. Beautifully drinkable. A bit thin compared to some of the top RIS's but almost sessionable (nevermind your head swimming!).

The nose is thick roasty malts, dark chocolate, slight alcohol warmth. Wow! Such a full bodied malt taste rolling through my mouth, subtle smoothe hops give just enough of a bitter bite, dark chocolate, notes of coffee in the finish.

Crazy....",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JeffV,3.98,"This beer looks like motor oil as I pour it into my glass. The head is reluctant and I find myself trying to pour in such a way as to accentuate it. However, the head that does emerge is unrelenting and caps the beer from start to finish.  In the nose this beer has a nice chocolatey-coffee smell augmented by a touch of hops and a great malt spine.  The beer's taste is robust and indulgent. Chocolate. Coffee. A little pumpernickel maybe. Some piney hops in the back of the throat.  The one problem I have with it is that at 10.5% this beer has a little too much alcohol bite. I want the alcohol to serve as a crisp way to end a mouthful not as a sterile swab of vodka. This beer is the latter. Its a nitpick because when you buy a beer that is named for its alcohol content (ten fidy) you get what you paid for...  The beer has a delightfully heavy feel in the mouth and you can tell you're drinking an imperial. This isn't a sissy's beer and it does not feel like one.  With that said, it would be tough to choke down many of these in one sitting.

2681,34483,itcomesnpints,4.85,"No need to worry about an exploding can as you open. This stuff is just too damn thick. Pitch black oil glugs out of the can. A hard pour created a big muddy head. A regular black hole in the glass. Cool.  Smells like sweet roasted malt, and lots of it. Coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Light hop oils on the nose.  Chocolate fudge, sweet malt, espresso and hop spice on the palate. Don't think this could taste any better.  A full-bodied RIS that is ridiculously smooth and creamy. Just enough pep from the carbonation to keep all that malt weight from falling flat. Best mouthfeel i've found in an RIS.  After being very underwhelmed by Oskar Blues' Gordon's DIPA, I was a rigid skeptic of Ten FIDY's hype...until I popped the top.

2681,34483,BEERchitect,4.23,"Undoubtedly the best Russian Imperial Stout ever poured from a can. For some reason I feel dirty just admitting that. The beer slowly crawls out of the can and carefully eases itself into the glass with a more-viscous-than-most appearance. Low on carbonation, but releases an firm yet terse foamstand that laced and retained quite well. The beer is as dark and opaque as they come. The motor oil comparison that others have used is a good descriptor. Bold aromas of roasted barley malt, espresso, cocoa beans, and sweet alcohols garner attention from the nose. The flavor profile is much the same, but with the major emphasis on the roasted malts and espresso notes that just dominate the beer. Light hoppiness goes largely unnoticed, as do the esters, phenols, and any other delicate yeast qualities. Not overly complex, they have given this stout very few jobs to accomplish, but to do so larger and bolder than anyone else. They've largely succeeded. The beer is heavy, thick, and nearly syrupy. The light carbonation gives just enough lift to make the beer palatable. Finishes as you could imagine with a long lingering of espresso, cocoa, and warming alcohols.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,HalfFull,3.65,"Served up on tap in a pint glass, this brew pours an oily black in the dim light of the cantina. The depth of the color is a bit difficult to ascertain, but the rich mocha color of the head is a good hint. Said head is thin and fleeting however, yielding some early lacing yet surrendering such things as time moves along.  Smells of deep chocolate, carob, and roasted malts. Not much for hops yet pretty inviting, and with a notable alcohol volatility.  Tastes nice with chocolate, coffee and a bit of toasted caramel. A light bitter finish lingers given a well placed carbonation level. Offers a nice feel and drink. Alcohol is well hidden on the tongue yet notable on the nose. Not a lot of variety on the taste, but what is there is pretty good.  An Oskar Blues brew I would recommend, vs. condemn, what a concept! Not an outstanding RIS, yet decent, and worth a try. Might be better in the can if it holds the carbonation better, will pick up if I can find a single...",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

I swear, if I didnt knwo this was beer, I would think it is Valvoline or something. A creamy, light chocolate colored head forms and generous lacing is present as well.  Aroma was licorice and molasses and figs and raisins. I didnt get a lot of hop aroma here. A great deal of chocolate and oaky vanilla bring the nose around fully.  Chocolate up front with vanilla in the finish. Tons of raisins and figs in the flavor profile. Not as much molasses but lots of vanilla and oak.  Smooth as hell and full bodied. Perfect carbonation and smoothness make this an easy sipper and an easy drinker. Another winner from Oskar Blues.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,caminiti,4.38,"An exceptional beer at an exceptionally high price, but worth it. Pours dark, thick, and slow into my favorite stolen pint glass, almost no head, but leaves a deep lacing that is still present at the end of the glass. A beer to be drank occasionally, tastes of a dark roasted malt with a hint of alcohol that can not be hid, due the high content, smells as it tastss, with a bit of an aftertaste that does not really fade away, smooth in the mouth, a very nice beer all around, and if you can pick it up for under $13 a four pack, you are doing well",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

It had ruby red hints at the top of the glass and its small, tan, creamy head.  S - It smelled of sweet malt, dark chocolate, caramel and molassess.  T - It tasted of sweet, sweet malt. Roasted maltiness and some bitter hops balanced out the sweetness. Also, some boozy alcohol taste.  M - It was soft, smooth and creamy. A medium to full-bodied beer.  D - This is an outstanding brew. Really one of the finest beers around.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Mauerhan,4.23,"thanks to patronwizard for tossing me this bad boy.  i crack the can and am shocked. i just see a black void inside. i pour it into a pint glass and i my shock continues. this is the darkest fucking beer ive ever seen. darker than old motor oil mixed with mud. a thick one finger chocolate brown head stays for a minute then falls to a slight ring around the edge of my glass.  smell is awesome. i get a big hit of chocolate, really thats all i get. chocolate chocolate and more chocolate...this is a 10% ill believe it when im buzzed.  taste is awesome. i would say this gets filed as a smile beer. i am greeted by a warm array of chocolate malts, still not detecting any of the booze.  creamy and smooth. this beer goes down easy. not much carbonation to speak of. i am left with a great aftertaste.  this is the definition of easy drinker. i have finally found the alcohol in this beer as my belly is nice and warm. i love you ten fidy. come back to me again soon.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,oakbluff,4.47,"Can sample- very viscous pour, really lives up to the name. Dark stuff. Reasonable tan head. Nose- licorice, oats and dark chocolate. Taste- incredibly thick bodied. You could cut it with a knife. Very well melded flavours lap over the tongue, big chocoalte and licorce flavour, extra kick from the oats. Surprised to see this is 98 ibu, hops seem to swallowed by the black hole of beautiful malts. Finishes nicely.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,brewdlyhooked13,4.85,"Appearance - uncaps without a noise. Pours an inky, oily thick black, a finger of chocolate mocha head piecing together. Thick and creamy, thin sticky waves of lace make an even ring around the glass.  Aroma - heavy roasted malts, lots of coffee aroma. I dig.  Taste - huge roasted malts. Mmmm, sweetness, bitter espresso-like coffee. The swallow shows some bitterness, via either the roasted malts or balancing hops. It really doesn't matter, the show is in the roast and coffee flavor of the malts. And a fine show it is. Some abv warmth before long, the finish provides sustained roastiness post-swallow, just a delicious beer to enjoy.  Mouthfeel - heavy, thick, moderately carbonated. 'You can use a fork, but you'll want to use a spoon to catch every drop'...remember that one?? ;-) It's like that...  Drinkability - super stuff, that it's in a can just adds to the convenience and aura that is Oskar. Kudos to Yesac for pushing me to put this can in the fridge and check 'er out.

2681,34483,OlieIPA,4.13,"I give it a ten out of fidy...haha...just kidding...stupid joke anyways.  A: Dark and black with a one to two finger brown head. Lacing is amazing as well.  S: Rich chocolate and roasted coffee...similar to Alesmith's Speedway stout. I also get hints of dark fruits perhaps...raisins to be more specific.  T: Coffee, caramel, chocolate...and a nice alcoholic finish on it. All the flavors are rich as well...a blend perfectly together.  M: Hands down..the best mouthfeel I've had with any beer. Thick and coats the palate, along with a gentle carbonation. Perfect!  D: You can taste the alcohol, but its not overwhelming...very east to drink.  Overall: One of the best RIS's around; I want to have a 6-pack in my fridge all the time now!!! This is truly an amazing beer, and one that I will seek out and obtain.

2681,34483,SaucyA,4.34,"A - Opened the can with a crack and no hiss. Hm.. doesn't sound very carbonated. Poured BLACK with a 1/2 finger brown head into da snifta. Looks appetizing, but nothing terribly standout. No lacing.  S - Killer smelling brew. Super roasty, super chocolatey, super brownie...eee. It's just a fudgey brew. Slight hop profile underlying. Quite reminescent of Expedition.  T - Coffee up front, without really being coffee. Chocolate... milk chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, baker's chocolate... just choco wonderfulness. Bitter hoppy backend, that leaves a nice oily coating.  M - Thick, oily, syrupy, viscous, low carbonation. If this were a TOUCH more carbonated I'd be more apt to bump it to a five.  D - It's a sipper, but a damned good one. This deserves all the praise it gets.  Notes: Glad I'm sitting on a couple more of these. I don't think it'd replace Expedition if it were available here, but I'd sure as hell buy more of them. Totally worth finding/buying.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,albern,4.01,"The pour on this beer says it all. It is like thick, black, inpenetrable sludge with a creamy dark brown head that retains and laces. It looks a bit like a chocolate milk shake. This beer is full bodied and loaded with character. If you like Russian Imperial Stouts, this is the real deal. Not a style that I'm crazy about because it is just too roasted, charred, and heavily laden with alcohol. The aroma on the beer is roasted malts, alcohol, and thick florals.  The beer is prodigious, complex, and loaded with character. It is chocolately, has thick roasted coffee malts, charred cherry flavors, and a strong ABV backbone that tastes like a roasted liqueur. There are some hoppy notes towards the finish, a throaty ABV burn, and a really oily mouthfeel coupled with the ABV presence. The aftertaste is quite pronounced. For me, this is a sipping beer and that's it. I can't handle the strength of this beer, but for what it is, it is a great representation of the style.

2681,34483,hreb,4.16,"Cold 12 oz aluminum can poured into pint glass. Beer explodes with motor-oil / cola-black liquid with a beautiful hazelnut-caramel brown head on top which sparkles a moment before falling back into what seems to be a glass of black coffee. I don't get much aroma however -- perhaps it is too cold? Or just too dense? (nope, after warming up, I just don't get much aroma off this)  First sip is immediately rich, creamy, and toasty. Burnt. But it rapidly explodes on the back of the palate with an intense bitterness. The flavor then switches to nutty, but still with a slightly astringent bitterness. Feels pleasantly thick on the tongue.  Overall the Russian Imperial Stout in a can is big, complex, and heady. It's worth it -- I'm impressed.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,glid02,4.62,"Got this on-tap at Trappeze in Athens, GA.  Pours completely black with a dark brown head complete with big bubbles. The head dissipates into a wispy layer of bubbles on an oily film and a thin ring around the glass. There's not very much lacing.  Smells very good. Lots of dark chocolate and coffee with mild roasted malt aromas.  Tastes even better than it smells. Lots of dark chocolate and roasted malt up front, followed by molasses and ending with a coffee bitterness. No hint of the alcohol except for the warming.  Mouthfeel is amazing. Very thick with subtle carbonation that goes down incredibly smooth. It's like drinking a milkshake.  Drinkability is great. Everything about this beer makes me want to drink more.

2681,34483,umtox,4.5,"What a great example of this style.  Had on tap and appropriately served in a small snifter. Pours pitch black with a dark toffee thin head of small bubbles. A lot of chocolate and coffee here, but everything in balance. Also a hint of vanilla that tastes very natural-not the artificial taste that is often present in many stouts. Drinkability is on par for the style--it is rather heavy in body, but the 10%ABV is not as apparent as expected. Great with a chocolate based dessert or as a dessert by itself.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bkilpatr,4.11,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. 10/08/08.  Pours pitch black with a thin finger of chocolaty brown head. The head dropped to a thin layer, no lacing on the glass. Aroma is plenty of roasted malt with a mix of sweet milk chocolate and bitter dark chocolate, with light hints of roasted coffee and vanilla.  Taste starts with some very sweet chocolate malt and milk chocolate flavors. That slowly turns into more of a bitter dark chocolate taste and a nice hop profile. Plenty of roasted malt all around. Slight vanilla and a decent amount of roasted coffee. The alcohol is nowhere to be found in the taste.  Feel is somewhat thick, smooth, and creamy with ample carbonation. The body is rather full. The finish is dry and has an aftertaste that lasts forever. Drinkability is alright. The sweetness is a bit much for me, but the alcohol is very well hidden.  Very good for an imperial stout. Not my favorite, but close. One of the best beers I've had out of a can. Try it if you can find it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S: A nice blend of caramel and chocolate and crusty / bready grain goodness. Just a hint of alcohol presence in the scent.  T: Deep and malty with nice bready overtones. Like eating a nice piece of pumpernickel. As it warms the breadyness becomes much more pronounced. For a strong beer, the alcohol flavor is quite masked.  MF: I expected more body, but I like what they are doing here. Stouts are often too think for my liking.  D: On a cold night by a campfire, hell yes. My favorite Oscar beer by far.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S - Chocolate malts up front, grassy hints and a earthy overtone  T - Thick frothy and rich chocolate malts hit you first, a coffee overtone, sharp but subtle bitterness (like cocoa) that stays throughout with a hop like bitter finish. The 10% ABV is hidden fairly well.  M - Thick!  D - Not the easiest to have back to back to drink due to it's thickness and effects of 10% ABV. But this is a great stout to sip on next to the fire.

2681,34483,biegaman,4.52,"Seemingly regurgitated out in chunks, the rich full character of Oskar Blues' Ten Fidy can be observed first by the eyes. A rusted ebony of frosting would unfold first along its outskirts and fiercely storm the center of the glass. A graphite stitched charcoal black; it is capable of completely eclipsing light.  It is as rich and awakening to the senses as a heavily roast morning espresso; in fact it smells a lot like one too. Its aroma is paradoxically rousing and relaxing. Bitter espresso is glazed over by vanilla beans and the presence of a tannic Port wine. I love this smell.  Milk chocolate and bitter cocoa are finally introduced with the first sip. The supporting cast includes coffee beans, fudge, dark caramel, biscuit, and vanilla bean accompany, all in good proportion. The flavours don't compete, they blend into one another. The taste deviates slightly from the aroma, although the two share much of the same attributes.  I am slow and appreciative with every sip. I feel a tad indulgent - you should feel indulgent drinking an Imperial Stout! Unexpectedly there is a near absence of bitterness which allows tannic flavours of espresso and vanilla bean to grace the tongue without harshness. The utter absence of alcohol is nothing short of a delusion, but I can't sense any indication of it.  I don't think Oskar Blues' Ten Fidy is my favourite RIS, but it makes a very convincing case. It is stupendously tasty and absurdly drinkable. As good as it is on its own, I really recommend pairing this with dessert, chocolate brownies make a marvelous match.

2681,34483,ThreeWiseMen,4.38,"Appearance: Pours a dirty motor oil color (black with a hint of brown if that makes any sense). A head slowly coagulates on top, taking on the same color as the liquid before fading (yes fading) to a dark brown. I have never seen a head so dark in my entire life. After rising to about two fingers, the tight, creamy head seems to have leveled off around half-finger height. Creamy, blanket-like lacing. Looks absolutely sinister.  Smell: Cigar, molasses, oak, mocha, cocoa powder, and burnt malts. Alcohol hides beneath the surface, taking quick stabs at the nostrils without warning. This beer scares me.  Taste: Dark chocolate and burnt malts coat the entire mouth. Ok, i just found some sort of sugary, hairy-looking blob. BM me if you ever find one of these things - it was rather gross. EDIT: just found another in can #3. Moving on - oak, molasses, and tobacco make their presence known, along with French roast coffee and some oily hops. Dry, burnt, aftertaste hangs around forever. Pretty good masking, however alcohol peeks through in aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly milky, sticky, heavy, and warm. Only light carbonation. Tremendous mouth-coating. This is a beast!

Black licorice scent. Hint of alcohol.  Taste is what I've come to think of as 'stoutish', though this one is heavier on the coffee flavor and nicely done at that. I like it.

As dark as night, absolutely beautifully dark. I got a small tan head, that reduced to coating the top of the beer. This beast is impenetreble to light.  Smells of dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, espresso. Very nice.  Holy moly Batman, this tastes fanTASTIC!! Nice and creamy, with hints of dark choclate and espresso from the dark roast malts. I'm also getting a hint of hops in there. This is very balanced.  This has a great mouthfeel. Even though I pick up some alcohol in the smell, as it sits in my mouth, it's so smooth. This is dangerously good, I am loving it!  Drinkability is great, especially for an RIS. It just goes down so nicely, and I'm crying inside because this was my one and only Ten Fidy. I will definately seek this out in the future. A fabulous brew. Even though Surly is my first love, Oskar Blues fricking rocks!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,khiasmus,4.5,"I've had several cans of this already. This being my last can, I figured it'd be good for my 250th review.  Pours the inky black of used motor oil with a finger of rich, heavy tan head. A bit of mahogany highlights, only if held to the light... otherwise pitch black. Nose is of sweet rich malt, black patent, roasted barley, a hint of bittering hops in the back. Smells heavy and rich, as though it will be a treat to enjoy. Flavor is much the same as the nose, but with added alcohol in the finish. Starts with rich, dark malt, charred wood, strong roast, alcohol, and finishes syrupy with heavy malt sweetness and intense grain bitterness with some alcohol. Flavor remains long after each swallow. Mouthfeel is dense and heavy, syrupy, low carbonation, and a very dry and smooth finish with alcohol warming. An excellent brew, possibly the best in a can. Highly recommended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MinorThreat,4.53,"Served from a can.. with pride.  A-Used motor oil is as close as it comes to describe how dark this beer is. Nice coco head with great lacing  S-Dark chocolate, roasted malt, esspresso, coffee, some booze  T-Unreal, bitter roasted coffee paired with layers of chocolate, from rich milk chocolate to dark bitter chocolate. WOW!  M-How can something that looks so thick be somewhat light to the palate? Very nice  D-Highly, for the ABV and style",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Pencible,4.28,"This poured (from a can) totally opaque, pitch black with dark tan head. It smelled like alcohol, roasted coffee beans, licorice hops, and milk chocolate malt. It tasted like very bitter burnt coffee with strong licorice hops, and a bit of roasted chocolate malt, with sour alcohol taste. It was thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a very bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very flavorful and potent beer. I would typically suggest aging to mellow out the character, but I'm not sure if that would work for this beer, since it comes in a can? Regardless, it was very clean and complex, with great flavor and body.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JMBSH,4.78,"A - Black doesn't even seem to fully describe how dark this beer looks. Has a nice light brown head. Even held against a strong direct light, all I see is black. As I drank a complete covering of lace is left on the glass surrounding the black gold. I like it!  S - Faintly of dark chocolate. Almost like baker's chocolate (cocoa). Also reminds me of some dark coffee roasts.  T - Very chocolate in taste. A bit of a hop bite in the aftertaste but it seems hidden a bit from the smooth creamy body. I know the alcohol (10.50 hense 10 FIDY) is up there but I really can't detect it. The dark roasted malts are smoothed with the use of flaked oats.  M - Smooth, rich, but mostly THICK. The beer's website says it is 98 IBUs. I am still learning but I checked Wikipedia about IBUs and it said 100 was the top. I would never have guessed this beer was that hopped.  D - Dangerously deceitful. I could have more then one without thinking. I know that the alcohol would sooner or later rear it's ugly head on me but this was great.  A couple extra notes. Open the can carefully. I write this review as it is the last of the 4 pack I bought to drink right away. Each can, no matter how slow and careful I was, was so full that I always got some on my hand. They filled these babies to the top and then some. Also, since they are in cans, I will start cellaring them to see what happens after aging them a bit.

2681,34483,JasonA,4.18,"Upon cracking this can, it doesnt seem like there will be any carbonation. Nice pour provides amble dark mocha, almost wood color head. Boy does it look thick. I would give this a 5, but the head doesnt seem to quite stay long enough. I might be getting picky here. Oil slick black, no light getting through this thing. Exciting.  Deep roasted malt, almost burnt but it a good way. Some coffee/espresso present. Some stout hops.  Amazingly creamy. Wow, how did they do that? Fairly dry and hoppy. Espresso, malt.  Really dry, but in a good way. I can say I have never tasted a beer like this before. I think its the hops component, but I cant be certain.  There is something a little out of balance here, not exactly sure. It might just be this beer is extremely different from any norm, even RIS standards.  I would love to have a 6r of this.  cheers",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,johnd513,3.98,"Big thanks to stevemcqueenjr for this one. This beer pours oily pitch black in the glass with a carmel colored head that quickly disapears.

2681,34483,JoeMayo,4.45,"A- Pours black as night and as thick as used motor oil. A thin, brown head forms and quickly recedes to a small ring around the glass. The beer is so thick that it leaves a slight film on the glass.  S- Very much a true RIS: Roasted malts, chocolate, dark Italian-roasted coffee, espresso, and notes of raisin, rounding out the smell.  T- It's bitter without being difficult to drink. The dark chocolate notes and bitter coffee flavors are accented by a surprising hop bitterness. Roasted malts with notes of caramel and raisin add a little sweetness.  M- Looking at the beer, you would think it's going to be completely flat, yet there's just enough carbonation to give the beer a little life. It's also incredibly rich, thick, and creamy.  D- Almost no hotness from the alcohol comes through. It's a sipper because of it's massive consistency. Overall, a really nice, classic example of what a Russian Imperial Stout should be.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Reino,4.45,"12oz can received in a trade from my man everetends. Thanks Gilly.  Appearance- Pours black with a slow rising, mocha-tan monster of a head. It looks tasty as fuck. Good lacing, but could be a smidgen better.  Smell- Dark roasted malts, dark bitter coffee and chocolate, and floral hops. There's also some dark fruits and baked cracker lingering in there that reminds me of AK MAK. I don't have to strain to find the different smells, which is beautiful.  Taste- Wow! What a shit ton of bitter chocolate, roasted malt and dark, dark coffee. As if that bitterness wasn't enough, there are bitter hops that show up next. They are soon completely wiped out by the ensuing heat. A second ""Wow!"" goes out to this beers ability to be fresh out of the oven hot with alcohol without it being unpleasant. It was a fairly warm day here in the central valley of Oregon, and for a bit I was literally sweating from drinking this beer, and that is A-OK with this guy. Big chocolate, big coffee, big hops, and big heat. This beers gets the job done. It's the John McClane of the RIS world.  Mouthfeel- Creamy, smooth, lush, rich...go thesaurus crazy with the word creamy and you get the point. Low carbonation and a better body than a young Pamela Anderson.  Drinkability- The abv and heat keep the drinkability down a bit, but only because I don't want to sweat off 10lbs and do something to get me arrested. The flavor never gets old and doesn't ware on the tongue.

Good strong nose, heavy on the coffee, supported by chocolate, dark fruits, and a bit of licorice.  Taste begins with a tasty coffee shot, an undercurrent of dark fruit, a solid hop bite at the swallow and finishes with a huge lucisous burst of rich chocolate syrup - wow!  Mouthfeel is full, somewhat rich, but short of oily slick. Drinkability is terrific - only hampered by the $5.99/can price tag.  If this doesn't end the ""no good craft beer can be in a can"" argument, nothing will.

I've never seen anything like this beer, it was like pouring 2'oclock in the morning somewhere far from city lights into a glass. I've never seen a milk shake made with Ghirardelli, but that's exactly what I thought of when I saw the head form.  Smells of sweet chocolate, malts and coffee. Damn I want to try this beer.  My God, what an amazing beer. Chocolate, coffee, rich and creamy. Instantly one of my favorite beers, and definitely upper echelon of Imperial Stouts.

Covering this is a 1 1/2 finger, dark tan/coffee colored head that's very creamy and rich and sports excellent retention. It slowly recedes to a slight skim and leaves an ornate lattice-work of lace in the glass.  S: Huge aromas of dark fruit, coffee, dark chocolate, burnt/blackened malt, booze, toffee, and hops. Smells very sweet with a distinct bitter edge.  T: Tastes much like it smells. Burnt malt, dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruit, toffee, rum raisin bread pudding, chocolate covered cherry, spices, and a touch of citrus and pine. Very nice and slightly hot boozy flavor.  M: So thick, oily, and incredibly coating. Huge sweet fruit, dry/roasty malt, and spicy/bitter hops make for such an interesting adventure. Finish lingers forever and continues to evolve, running the gamut from sweet, dry, bitter, spicy, and back again.  D: I drank this on an empty stomach and was surprised at how ""non-invasive"" the alcohol was.

I was picking up some beer to-go tonight and figured it would be worth it to get a can and write up a few lines about it. First off, I LOVE CRAFT BEER IN A CAN!!!! There is something almost romantic about a can of beer and now that I can get good beer in a can, it makes that romance even hotter. I poured this bad boy into a 16 ounce pint glass. There was a little head straight outta the can, a milky chocolate color, which slowly dissipated. The aroma was full of dark roasted malts with dark chocolate. The taste was mellow...no bite for a beer that boasts a 10.5% ABV. If you get the chance to try a can of this EPIC brew, don't put it off...this dog will hunt!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,gmcfarre,4.35,"12 oz can poured into an imperial pint glass  A - Pours a pitch black sludge with a nice one inch dark tan head. Head lasts well and leaves a fine layer of lacing as it disappears.  S - A very strong dry and roasted flavor presents itself immediately. Dark chocolate and coffee are the obvious checkpoints. An undercurrent of dark fruit floats below the dominant dryness. Just a hint of floral hops.  T - Starts with the same intense roasted dry flavor as the scent. Slightly sweet, but it works well with the bitter dark chocolate and more-subdued espresso flavors. Dark fruit gets lost in the strong bitter dry flavor.  M - Dry and very full bodied yet rather smooth. Bitter dryness at the end complements the roasted dryness of the early mouthfeel.  D - A huge stout that should not be taken lightly. Certainly worth picking up, and perfect for that first cold night of fall.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BrewMan13,4.53,"I'll probably say what has alerady been said countless times, but this is one incredible stout and hands down the best beer ever to come in a can. Pours really black and really smooth into a Stone RIS glass. You can just tell this is one viscous brew. I must say, there is something very satisfying about pouring a beer this black and thick from a can. A small, creamy dark tan head slowly develops. The head looks like, if you could scoop it off and put it in a glass by itself, it would be somethign someone would pay $6 for at starbucks. Alas, it does not last terribly long before reducing to a small coat on the top of the black hole that is the beer. Smell is mostly of roasted malts with a nice whiff of hops. Taste is out of this world. As a big fan of the style, I've had my share of RIS's, and this is the 1st one in a while that has really exceeded my expectations. Very intense onslaught on the taste buds of dark roasted malts, dark bitter chocolate and enough hops to notice, but not enough to overpower the brew, as some American interpretations of the style do. Hop bitterness lingers in the finish, mingling for awhile with some leftover roastiness. This is no beginner RIS, thats for sure. Mouthfeel is smooth as silk and very heavy on the palate. Perfect for the style, IMO. Drinkablity? Well, I cant wait for the next sip. All in all a very impressive stout...damn its good.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,engisch,4.25,"Opened the can and it made almost no sound. Just the sound of the aluminum scraping, as there was no hiss from carbonation. Pours black with a little dark brown head. Very thick pour that resembles syrup. Smells of roasted malts, hops, coffee, and alcohol. I can not wait to take a sip. The taste is fairly typical of an imperial stout. It has strong flavors of coffee and chocolate from the malts with a nice bitterness from the hops. Quite a heavy feeling beer with light carbonation.  Exceptional brew! I am very glad that I recently picked up a whole case of this. That will be a well enjoyed case. I cannot believe how all these good beers from Oskar Blues come from a can. Great job!

2681,34483,kbnooshay,4.83,"This poured an awesome pitch black! The super frothy head is a very dirty dark brown. Aroma is potently alcoholic but in a good way. Roasted coffee, sweet malt and very bitter chocolate are standouts in the nose. The taste is more of the same but the alcohol isn't as noticeable as in the smell.  Most impressive here is the multiple waves of delicious bitter chocolate and roasted malt. Moderately drying. Alcohol warms in the belly. The feel is syrupy and coating but at the same time creamy. Just to point out, at this time in the session almost all of the empty glass is coated in a generous sheet of brown lacing. This is WAYYY to drinkable for a 10% abv. It is a delight to drink but it will bite back!.  These guys make fucking awesome beer then they put it in a can!

Poured a sticky and bubbly tan head, with a little green tint to it (hop resin?). The lacing in the glass dries incredibly sticky, almost to the point where you need a brush to scrape them off after the session, as a hot water rinse is not sufficient.  S: Coffee, bitter chocolate, malt, grass.  T: Stong bitter coffee flavor from the dark roasted malts. A nice sweetness follows the initial bitterness. Damn good.  M: This is a substantial beer. Chewy and thick. You pretty much eat this one, not drink it. Unbelieveable.  D: At 10%, and with the heavy body of this beer, I could not drink more than one of these in a session. It probably didn't help that this was the conclustion to a session that included (2) Stone Ruination, ABA, RIS, and Green Flash IPA.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The taste was a smooth blend of roasted malts, fresh ground coffee beans, bitter chocolate and slight molasses.

S: So complex with mostly coffee, fresh roasted black malts, cherries, and a touch of alcohol.  T: Black and roasted malts really take it away here, along with dark cocoa. There is a huge complexity in the taste though of dark fruits, and bitter chocolate. Bittering hops come in nicely as well.  M,D. The mouthfeel is extremely chewy and lacking some carbonation.

Maybe a little coffee, slight but not much.  T - Tastes of sweet roasted malt up front then a bitter chocolate taste. Somewhat of a bitter earthy hop taste and some bitter roasted coffee.

2681,34483,ryrust5301,4.2,"Been waiting to try this one for a long while. It's time to coat the taste buds and see what's behind the can.  Appearance - Black as licorice with a very thin tan line of head. Looks like chocolate syrup when it's poured into the glass. Very thin and oily looking. Lacing is top notch for an impy stout, with tiny dots hanging to the side of the glass. A faint whirlpool of tan mist swirls on top.  Smell - A thick layer of spicy alcohol blends in with a coffee bitterness. Oh yeah, a bit of chocolate in there too.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Ever so gentle carbonation bite, but this one turns as smooth as silk very quickly. The tiny bit of carbonation gives it a bit of life from the slick coating on the tongue. Don't get the really deep chocolate taste everyone is talking about. Yeah it has chocolate but it's a very bitter chocolate and not as sweet as I was hoping. The hops play a huge roll in the bitterness, but the coffee taste contributes as well.  Drinkability - I love the IPA's from Oskar Blues, and this is another good offering as well. Not my favorite from them, but definitely worthy of it's following.

The first shocking revelation is that wow this beer is like black molassas and motor oil after about 15,000 miles. I cannot believe the depth of color. Mine was poured into a trappist glass. As you swirl the beer a greenish tan head forms. This beer absolutely sticks to the sides of the glass!  The shock does end with the appearance. The smell confirms that the green tint was in fact hop resins. That hop bite cannot be felt as a result of the huge malt character and overwelming mouth feel.

More coffee in the flavor, mingled with chocolate and malt. A perfect example of an RIS. Even at 10% abv, it still seemed smooth enough to drink a few.

2681,34483,daythree16,4.55,"Big thanks to phil7568 for this one!  Upon opening the can, there is no hiss of carbonation escaping. It's strange and unfamiliar to only hear the metal tab scraping the sides of the mouth as it's being pulled back. It definitely doesn't smell like any other beer I've had out of the can. Poured into my snifter, it looks like motor oil: dark black, thick, and absolutely no carbonation.  Swirling the glass around produces a small amount of head and releases a little more of the bouquet. The smell is of chocolate, raisins, and a little spicy alcohol. Takes a couple of sips just to sort all the complex flavors. Bitter, dark chocolate up front, then a bit of mild caramel sweetness followed by a bitter finish that seems to be more hop-induced than the chocolate malt. It also fades into a really nice caramel aftertaste.  As far as mouthfeel is concerned, it feels like it looks: thick and syrupy. Also, it's very lightly carbonated. This is a fairly big beer, so I doubt I'd have more than two, but I'd certainly enjoy the hell out of those two.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,GilGarp,4.51,"I noticed Ten Fidy was getting scarce so I snagged up a 4 pack before it went extinct.  Pop the can and pour it gently into a pint glass. It's as thick as any other beer I can remember and has great head. This is a truly black beer. Most imperial stouts let light through on just the edges. This one is completely opaque. The bubbles fight their way to the top through the ultra viscous stout. Lacing is outstanding.  Aroma is malty, rich, and roasty. There's coffee and chocolate too.  The flavor is truly exceptional. It's creamy and chocolatey. It's sweet yet bitter. It's definately roasted. Holy cow.  Mouthfeel is velvety, creamy, smooth as hell. It's thick too but in a good way, coating my mouth and throat.  Drinkability is high but that's all relative. You'd have to be brave to tackle all four in a night. One is good, two is almost too much.  This is an incredible beer and deserves to be held in high regard. Please, Oskar Blues, don't let this one go retired.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TrevorGW,4.5,"Good Lord!  An amazingly balanced, yet super strong, Imperial Stout. And it comes in a beauty of a can.  Dark as night in the glass. Thin tan head with little to no lacing on the glass.  Aroma of Cocoa and Soy Sauce.  Tastes of dark chocolate, coffee, smores. Everything you could want from an R.I.S., without the raisin/liquorice flavor that I despise.  Creamy mouthfeel with a bitter finish. Big hop center like all Oskar Blues beers.  A killer beer that you can really savor for at least 40 minutes.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Enola,3.95,"This beer is a dark black with a small tan head. The smell is a nice blend of chocolate, oatmeal, coffee and more. The taste had some sort of funky medicinal taste that detracted from the brew somewhat. the abv show and there is a nice roasted aftertaste. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. This is a slow sipper and a very filling brew that is a unique find in a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,medic25,4.61,"Served from the can into a snifter. The first thing I notice is the total blackness of this beer. It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none. None more black. Aroma is a sweet malty chocolate. The taste is a fantastic balance if malt and hop, with great hints of coffee, fruit, and burnt malt. Very little carbonation (almost silent when I popped the tab), this is a thick, syrupy delicious meal of a beer. A little pricey, but this would make a fantastic treat of a beer on a cold night.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,phil7568,4.63,"I've been waiting to try this beer forever.  I thought about chugging from the can but I managed to take just a sip. nice.  This looks great in a glass. Jet black body with a nice thick head.  What a great imperial stout! This stuff is smooth and buttery. Cocoa and coffee dominate.  I've had two and I could go for another but I won't, I'm already a little tipsy.  Awesome Imperial stout. I will be getting more.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Doomcifer,4.38,"Pours a jet-black, no light through on this one, with a big, thick, dark caramel brown colored head that just sits there, clinging to the edges of the pint glass. Smells of LOADS of dark baking chocolate, extreme roastiness, coffee, caramel, really intense. As is the flavor. Extreeeemely roasty, burnt toast, charred meat, bitter, dark chocolate, cocoa, espresso beans, black licorice/anise, burnt figs, raisins. Some hop bitterness in the finish, as well as some alcohol heat. Extremely viscous, oily, thick & slick body that completely coats the mouth. Perfect amount of carbonation. Tons of flavors and depth on this one. Tremendous beer. We have a winner.  Old Chub is easily one of my favorite scottish ales, and Dale's Pale Ale is pretty damn good when I had it on tap too. Looks like Im gonna have to try their Gordon!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,NeroFiddled,4.38,"From notes taken at Lenora's Way in Brooklyn, NYC. 26 July 2008:  Whoa! This little can packs a punch! Quite possibly, no... without question, the darkest beer I've ever seen! BLACK. No light gets through. Creamy dark brown head. Exceptional retention given the strength. Nice lacing. Dark malt aroma. Some dark fruit. Some cocoa. Some background 'spent' hop. Mainly just dark malt. Coffee-like. Black coffee like. And that carries over into the flavor. More black coffee. Rich. Blanketing. Somewhat acidic, but not too much acidic. Solid mouthfeel. Firm and oily smooth. Flavors become more apparent as it warms, revealing more fruitiness (fig, burnt currant - which means dark berry-like fruitiness but with a bit of a tang, raisin, prune), lots of bittersweet chocolate, more coffee in a less roasty/acidic vein, more 'spent' and earthy/leafy hops, black licorice, burnt sugar, and alcohol. Solid bitterness. Quite the beast! Impressive. My fellow drinkers are satiated at one sip... ... I, however, could have another! Drinkable in the summer heat in Brooklyn? Yeah, with air conditioning! I'll have to grab some of this to enjoy as the leaves fall or the snow sets. Wonderfully super-rich libation! WHOAH!!! DAMN, I just looked at the receipt - $8 a can!!!?? Better make that just a 'few' cans for the entire winter season ;)",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,CamuMahubah,4.53,Very nice Russian Imperial Stout. Perhaps the hoppiest RIS I have ever sampled. Pours as black as my heart! Absolutely gorgeous!  Characteristic Imperial Stout smell. Malt and chocolate.  Delicous roasted malt appeals to the tongue while the hop profile is amazing for the style!  Maybe the thickest beer I have ever seen!  Hard to believe beer from a can is this good! Bravo! Oskar Blues has a winner with this one!,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A bit stale. chocolate, coffie and maybe even burnt malts present.  A thin mouthfeel for this style..  This was a decent beer but did not want to finish it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MiScusi,3.43,"Pours super thick as you would expect, pretty dark tan head. Smell is thick and roasty, alcohol, chocolate but nothing really sweet. The taste is just a soup of roastiness and bitter chocolate but it's really masked by the alcohol and slickness of the body. It's pretty flavor and not so in your face, except that it's like drinking sludge. This would be hard to drink a whole glass of, and I probably would never want to do it. There are other Imperial Russian Stouts that I have drank whole glasses of and have loved, so Ten Fidy gets marked down in that area.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TexIndy,4.06,"Poured from a 12oz can (no dating info) that my buddy shipped me from Colorado. I let it warm up to proper temp before popping it open. It poured out like motor oil into the pint glass. It was pitch black and thick. It had a 2 finger dark brown head that slowly settled into a constant foam. No visible carb but great lacing that stuck around till it was finished. The smell was coffee, roasted choc malts and alcohol. It had a bit too much of an alcohol smell for me to rate higher. The taste was also impacted by the high alcohol. I had other RIS with same or higher ABV that masked it better. Not bad but kept me from really enjoying it. The rest of the taste was really good. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy but the alcohol left an oily feeling on the tongue. Overall, a good but not great beer from OB. Will need to try again to make sure the sample was proper. Also would love to try on tap again. I had it in a sampler at the brewery/restaurant and seem to remember it being better.+",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,rhoadsrage,4.25,"(Served in a dimple mug) It just seemed wrong to pour from a can to a chalice.  A- This beer pours an obsidian black body that looks almost like a nitrogen pour. There is a thick chocolate milkshake head that is creamy and could be spread like frosting. It last for much of the beer. There are a few odd, tiny bubbles stuck to the glass but no light exited.  S- The smell of black roasted malt has a slight sweet dark chocolate smell and a hint of creamy that came through when it warmed.  T- The big taste of black diesel exhaust quickly gave way to a black roasted malt flavor with a soft fusel taste and some dark prune notes. There was a bit of cream flavor to the prunes as the beer warmed and the finish was a nice black malt bitterness. There was a soft spicy note that came through the roasted finish aswell.  M- This beer had a full mouthfeel with a creamy texture but no real alcohol heat.  D- This is a big engine oil body with a dark roast smooth and creamy flavor.

Nose is fairly mild, with a nice milk chocolate aroma, some coffee and cream and faint brown sugar. Taste is a nice, hefty roastiness, balanced by chocolatey sweetness, a hint of smoke, and an appropriate level of hop bitterness. Drier than other stouts in its class. The mouthfeel on this one is really exceptional for a non-oatmeal stout. It's quite weighty without being too sweet or sticky, and the high ABV is nearly invisible.

Two finger head, poured like oil into my car. Dark black and tan head then dropped to a thin head after a few moments. Lacing on the glass is great, a constant coat around the glass. Complex smell and taste. Coffee, chocolates, and sweet smells, lots of roasting here. Sweet at the front, bitter on the sides of the tongue, good mild hop profile with the roasted malts. Not tasting the alcohol on the palette or in the nose, deceptive in hiding, could cause trouble robocop style. Lots of bittering notes and dark malts in this one. Excellent caned brew.

Dark as satan's poo, with a thick viscous stickiness on the sides of my glass. The dark head tops off the pint. I accidently spilled a few drops onto the top of the cooler (we were camping), which I can only assume the lid will be forever stained.  Fairly sweet cocoa and bittersweet chocolate at first, then into a deep bitter coffee aroma. The high ABV is nicely hidden.  Big flavors from this tiny can. Rich chocolate and cocoa, espresso, and deep tobacco.  A real good smooth drinker. One can can last you a good long while.

Dark coffee grounds, pine boughs, smoke, burnt wood, a couple hints of bacon grease. Rauchbier Impy Stout?  Mouthfeel is simply huge. Thick viscosity makes me think that the brewers could barely squeeze anything else in.  Everything else pales to the smoky hellfire found here.

Taste is creamy, smooth, with a hint of hoppy nuttiness thrown in, & the cool wash of cocoa. It slides down easily enough, with some nice alchohol heat.  Pretty decent RIS.

Never seen anything like this before. Oozes from the can. Looks like used motor oil, both in color and viscosity. Pitch black with one of the darker heads I've ever seen. Now this looks like a stout!  Smell is lots of cocoa with a healthy dose of espresso.  This is a big thick beer, no doubt about it. Tons of cocoa, coffee, and licorice/anise. The hops come in at the finish, and I'm guessing its pretty heavily hopped, but its overwhelmed by everything else. Mouthful is thick and luscious.  Definitely very warm, but not outright boozy.

Nose is a very nice mix of dark chocolate, dark roasted espresso beans, milk chocolate with some mild roasted grain smells as well. Very strong and very inviting.  Taste is medium full to full bodied. Dark over roasted, bitter espresso beans.dark chocolate, a dark metallic bitterness. There's a strong medicinal, chalky, earthy taste as well that flows from beginning to end. There's really not much more to it. Dark burnt espresso, dark chocolate, bitterness and chalkiness. It ends with a long lingering chalky bitterness. .  It smells and looks amazing, but taste wise it's VERY much out of balance.

2681,34483,jmalex,4.13,"I got to try this on tap a few months ago in Arizona and now I'm thrilled to see it in cans all over PA. Nothing like an Imperial Stout on a hot day.  APPEARANCE: Pours into a Delirium tulip a deep, deep motor oil black with a latte brown head. It starts at about a finger high and drops fairly quickly to a full collar and full hazy surface covering.  SMELL: Huge, huge aromas of the full Imperial Stout spectrum. Caramel to loads of dark chocolate to espresso with a nice dose of bourbon and vanilla. Not terribly fruity and not much of a hop note. A little jolt of alcohol tops it off.  TASTE: It's not anywhere near as complex as in the nose, but it's still a flavor bomb. Much more fruity (plums, dates) along with the chocolate. It finishes with a slightly astringent roasted note which provides plenty of bitterness to the beer and lasts long after the swallow.  MOUTHFEEL: A beer can't possibly be thicker than this one. Wonderful all around and coupled with a lower carbonation level. Despite all this, it manages to stay away from being too slick.  DRINKABILITY: A complete beast of a beer, Ten Fidy is definitely for sipping. Alcohol doesn't get in the way at all though, so it's something I'm begging for another sip of.  Very, very nice. This is a beer absolutely deserving of it's spot among the elite Imperial Stouts in the world.

Strong odor of coffee, dark chocolate, and oats. Tastes about how it smells with a little booze kick added. The chocolate and the oats seemed to dominate at first with the coffee and moleasses flavors coming out stronger as the glass warms a bit to room temperature. Thick and chewy feel in the mouth. Overall a solid RIS and another hit from Oscar Blues. Also, it comes in a can... how can you go wrong there.

Poured into a tulip glass the beer was a black color with a medium-sized orange/tan head. The aroma was chocolate, coffee/roasted malt, a little vanilla. The taste followed aroma. I thought the coffee dominated, as well as showing some late, espresso-like bitterness. The beer filled me up, and was maybe a little on the harsh side.

2681,34483,Kendo,4.47,"Purchased at Julio's in MA. . . .  A: Poured from the can into a pint glass -- a thick, slow, viscous glub-glub-glub of a pour. Body is black with a small brown head that settles quickly, leaving behind some lace. A filmy chunk (chunky film?) glob, about a quarter inch long, sits on top of the head -- not sure what it is, but it happened the first time I had one of these too. I took away from the appearance score as a result. . . .  S: Roasty malt, coffee and chocolate -- more chocolate is evident as it warms. Good strong nose hits the spots you want for an imperial stout, with the emphasis on the roasted malt and chocolate.  T: First impression is that it's like the nose: coffee, malt and chocolate are all abundantly evident. Malt flavors are both sweet (I get molasses and even dark fruit) and roasted (plenty of coffee and roasted coffee beans). Some heat is apparent on the back end of the sip, not surprisingly given the 10% ABV. Even reminds me of dark rum a little. In spite of the initial dominance of malt in the profile, it finishes with a lingering dry, almost woodsy bitterness, for a nicely balanced imperial stout.  M: Definitely full bodied but slightly creamy too.  D: Very good, especially for a beer of this strength.  Notes: Excellent. One of my favorite imperial stouts to date. Very glad I bought two 4-packs, even at not-so-cheap prices (I think it was $14 per 4-pack). . . . Worth seeking out.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Just thick black syrup in your glass. Smells of rich milk chocolate and black strap molassas. Taste like a rich milk chocolate candy bar. Hints of coffee, roasted malts, earthy hops but this is all about the sweet chocolate flavors. It's just chocolaty enough to be good with out being overdone. This beer coats your mouth like a chocolate milkshake. Very drinkable for the style and being in a can adds to the drinkability imo, b/c cans are more friendly to certain drinking situations.

2681,34483,Getinthevan,4.65,"Poured straight out of the can and man was this stuff incredibly dark.  For starters, the appearance was very dark, almost black with a nice frothy, light brown head. From the get go, this stuff clung to the side of the glass and never outshined its color...a very thick treat waiting to be taken!  Smell was very rich in roasted malts and cocoa. Needless to say, there was a very strong aroma to go along with the froth and thickness this stout carried.  Taste was magnificient. The aroma of freshly roasted malts, coffe and cocoa were the primary flavors that came throughout my serving and yeah, this stuff was very top notch. An excellent bargain.  Mouthfeel was very thick, very complex, and very satisfying. I can't get enough of this stuff, as it goes down nice for a thick stout, but either way, the flavors are a must with the overall thickness as well. Very pleasantly surprised to say the least.

Aromas of cocoa, expresso, and hearty grains stood out for me. The subtle sweet aroma was quite interesting. The taste is just incredible with hints of chocolate, baked bread, and roasted coffee beans coming out at different moments.

2681,34483,aubuc1,4.28,"Poured from a can in to a goblet.  Pours black as night witha brown thin head that leaves heavy lacing.  Smells of roasted goodness- not burned but roasted. If I had ever smelled peat, I think it would be like this. Chocolate hidden in the back.  Less roasty taste, more char. Not quite a coffee taste, but a bitter, rich malt. Alcohol is masked very well in the back. If I liked coffee/char this would rank higher, but I still like the taste.  The mouthfeel of this beer really shines. It is a great thick, oily swallow.  A great beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Phyl21ca,3.73,Bottle courtesy of Gford217: Poured a deep pitch-black color stout with a huge deep brown color head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of roasted malt with some vinous notes and some sweet notes. Taste is a mix between some vinous notes with some roasted malt and a quite sweet finish. I could not detect much coffee or black chocolate notes that I usually associated with the style. Full body with average carbonation and no discernable alcohol. Interesting sipper but I am not sure what the hype was all about really.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Bierguy5,3.78,"12 oz. can. Pours a jet black color. No highlights at all. Thick mocha head. Great head retention, especially for the size of this beast. Just a great looking beer.  Dark chocolate comes across first in the nose. Lots of fresh roasted coffee, a fair amount of alcohol, and some cream.  Very roasty up front, with a good blast of warming alcohol. Hints of dark fruit, but nothing seems to get through the roasty aspect. Long lingering bitter finish, not sure if it is from the roasty flavor, or some hops working in.  Full body, almost creamy. Seems a bit too dry for me. Alcohol is very much evident. I liked this, but maybe not as much as others. If nothing else, then love this for being an imperial stout in a can!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,cokes,4.35,"The novelty of watching something this black and viscous ooze out of a can is worth the price of admission. But this doesn't need any gimmicky help in the looks department. The combination of inky absolute blackness and sizable milk chocolate suds always wins me over. Aromatic of burnt beef, dark chocolate, espresso, tawny port, Islay Scotch (with the requisite peat smoke, salt, and earth), and fir trees. It greets the tongue with a duffel bag of malt, and it's immediately clear that it plans on staying a while. Dark fudge and prunes and port enter first. It then turns powerfully smoky, with cigar ash, spent espresso grounds, peat, and beef brisket. There's a moment of saltiness that, when mixed with the smoke tones, again suggests a peat-rich coastal Scotch. Fudge and espresso hues resume dominance and carry it toward a hop conclusion full of mint of pepper and pine needles. There's a good deal of bitterness as it lingers in the entrance to the throat with peppermint and cedar. It carries a full body, but it seems to thin across the mouth. The power of it flavors make it so that anything less than a gel-like consistency seems insufficient. Nevertheless, it coats the mouth, and flavors drips down long after the gulp is swallowed. This is intense above all else. The smokiness quotient is raised above any stout I've had, and pushes towards Rauch-status. It's like a mouthful of grill-scrapings chased with a Laphroaig 10 YO Scotch with an double black espresso sidecar. I love it, but one can at a time and slowly.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,tedpeer,4.25,"extra in a trade from hophobo, thanks.  12 ounce can poured into a chalice.  A - Pours black. 3/8 inch mocha colored head. Settled to a thin layer and ring around. Wall of lacing around the glass.  S - coffee and sweetness from malt  T - chocolate, coffee. Slight alcohol warming in the finish.  M - smooth and thick.  D - a couple of these would go down very well. -- Reason for update:  Did a blind tasting of 7 RISs.  Night Tripper, Czar, and Stone RIS tied for First. Siberian Night and Old Rasputin tied for 4th, and Ten FIDY and Expedition tied for 6th. Based on these results I've changed my numbers.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JToad,3.98,"Thanks to cpferris for sharing this with me..  Poured out of the can straight into a Michelob Celebrate chalice.  Pours a dark viscous, like motor oil. Nice large head, with great lacing on the side.  Smells of chocolate, tobacco.  Tastes of chocolate, raisins. Slight tobacco undertones, mixed with coffee and hops. A bitterness not usually found in a lot of stouts.  Sips well, not overally as thick as it looks, goes down smoothe. The 10% ABV is well masked but I""m not sure i could do more than of these. It compares well to Darklord, but do not like it as much as I do the GI Bourbon County Stout. Very interesting for my first craft beer in a can. I enjoyed this beer alot, just had a few issues with the raisins, and some of the tastes on the front of the tongue.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,rudylaw,4.5,"I first had a sample of this at DLD... and I liked it, but didn't go gaga over it.  I decided to give it another whirl and it's really paying off for me this time.  As you can imagine, it pours pitch black with a nice 1-finger chocolate head. It smells of chocolate malt. The taste is like sinking your teeth into a moist chocolate cake with some hoppy bite at the back end. The mouthfeel is smooth and chewy... like the best RIS' are. So god damn tasty. It's like liking the batter bowl when you're not supposed to and not getting caught!  Oskar Blues has done what most thought impossible... they put a delicious RIS in a flipping can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,joeysmokedporter,4.2,"Poured from a 12 oz can into small glass.  A: Pours dark, opaque, deep black color without any signs of a highlight. Tan head that dissipates quickly.  S: A roasty, coffee aroma with some malt sweetness and a slight amount of spicy hop.  T: Starts with the coffee flavor, molasses, a hint of chocolate, moves into a spicy hop bitter flavor, ends with a roasty punch that does not approach charred but is quite enjoyable. Very restrained chocolate flavor for an imperial stout.  M: Somewhat thick and viscous, about average carbonation  D: For an imperial stout this is quite drinkable. Could easily have a few of these. Would pair well with a nice chocolate dessert.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,saintwarrick,4.87,"Dark deep black brew with a definite thin brown head. Oil-like consistency with this brew, thick and creamy, almost chunky. Smell is sweet, dark chocolate, chocolate chip cookies, fudge cake but a significant blast of hops there as well, more pronounced than in others I have tried from this style. Taste is thick but restrained. Very dark chocolatey sweet and bitter but not cloying thanks to a strong kick from the hops, which are very piney but complement the beer so well.  This is one of the most balanced RIS's I have ever had. Most have an big sweetness to them, this is the first I have had that throws the hops in your face. A tremendous brew, easily the best RIS in a can and one of the best out there period.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BeardedBoffin,4.35,"I finally got my hands on this stuff. The famous Ten Fidy in a black and sliver can. Beery goodness splattered everywhere when I popped the top. Pouring it into the glass revealed a black viscous brew with a half inch of head the color of chocolate milk. Coffee, rummy dark fruit, chocolate fill out a slightly spirituous aroma. Strong and full on the palate. Chocolate, sweet ripe fruit, and espresso all reveal themselves in the flavor. This lacks that dark roasted malty bite that some stouts have. The beer finishes with a blend of espresso, hops and a mild metallic alcohol character.  A solid imperial stout. I am still adjusting to the fact that this came from a can. Seek and Savor.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,yemenmocha,4.23,"Edit: retasted after 6 mos. age. much better!  Can opened with too much vigor and it was as if motor oil spewed all over my hand and the counter.  Pours black as black can get, with deep rich dark brown head.  Nose reminds me of burnt eggo waffles, cherry-vanilla soda fountain, and SKOR candy bar.  Thick & full bodied on the palate. A roasted dark chocolate with espresso monster. Not a lot of balance. Hops are sharp and unpleasantly bitter. Not a pleasant complement to the roasty flavors.  This is an ""in your face"" beer but falls short in balance & drinkability.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Smells fruity and chocolatey, thick malt and alcohol odor. Massive burnt malt and dark chocolate flavor. rich and creamy. roastiness fairly intense, bordering on bitter or metallic. Almost fruity, but not quite, if that makes sense. thick to the point where im expecting lumps, but no lumps appear. huge, as a good RIS should be. A big beast of a beer...in a can! Not as supremely awesome as Gordon, but still awesome.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Buebie,4.48,"Got this in a trade. thanks gford217!  Poured from a 12 oz can, into a larg brandi snifter. Black as night in color with a thick syrupy inky cream texture. Formed a dark brown 2 finger head. Which fizzled down to some medium retention. Laceing is present and very frothy and sticky in a syrupy cling.  Smell is chocolate malt grain with a subtle tinge of coffee. Some sweatness, no presence of alcahol to the nose.  Taste is very dark in a charred barrel sort of way. Deep rich chocolate malt character. Bittersweet chocolate. Black licorice at the swallow, very small hints of it though. Smokey notes before and after the swallow. Some bitter hops after the swallow that linger. Still, no alchahol warming. I would not have guessed this was 10% This is like a thick beer milkshake. Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy. Very little carbonation present in the mouthfeel catagory. I really enjoyed this one, very dangerously easy to drink.  My first can was enjoyed 3 nights ago on a camping trip with 2 of my buddies. I shoulda brought more then one can, it went down to quick. Was a colder rainy night around the campfire.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

There is a very thick mouthfeel. The hops are barely noticeable, this one is all about the malt, dark chocolate and hints of coffee abound. Not particularly complex, but very tasty.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,245Trioxin,4.51,"Unbelievable that this came from a can. An unremarkable looking can at that, save a few interesting bits of text.  12 oz can poured into a Budweiser / Phillies pint glass, 'cept for the Angel's share put into a juice glass for the wife's taste.  Appearance: Stealth black, head of 2% chocolate milk that takes me back to second grade. The head was 2 finger high, and thick like a fluidized bed! I'd take a pull, and watch the brew bubble down back through that head. Most be some serious proteins to do something like that. Lacing down the glass that gives the tell tale size of my gulps.  Smell: Great aroma, but seemed to missing something. Could be that I had grilled earlier, could be the pint glass, but it was just shy. Definitely roasty, some malt, didn't really note any hops. A little bit of coffee grounds as well.  Taste: This came from a can, right? My - my - my, this is good stuff. Roast, and a nice roast at that. No astringency that can follow too much roast at times. Hop bitterness gets you at the end, but its welcome in this style. The taste is fresh - could aging really help this? I'm not so sure it'd benefit. Well balanced for what it is, and delicious it is! As it warms, it gets only better, but I like it just out of the fridge cold. Little bit of Starbucks coffee in there. Very nice. I think the palate would need to rest awhile after enjoyment.  Mouthfeel: a bit thick - in a good way. Right amount of carbonation, pretty good for the style.  Drinkability: This is scary. I imagine myself with the two best buds sitting around the campfire in the woods enjoying this straight from the can. At 10%, it goes down easy. I think I could handle more than one of these in a row. Doesn't seem desert-ie like an imperial stout/RIS often feels. Great stuff.  Big thanks to Gleix for bringing this back for me. Glad to see that OB is making its appearance here in PA - I'll be on the look out for this!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,cjgator3,4.57,"12oz can poured into a pint glass. Pours an extremely thick, pitch black color with a nice tan head. The aroma is dark and roasty with a lot of chocolate. The taste starts out smooth and creamy with some sweet malt and chocolate. Then, BAM! The hops kick in to make a very bitter finish. The mouthfeel is the best part of the beer in my opinion. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and chewy, one of the better textures in a beer that I have had. This is a sipper for sure, but I could see myself enjoying a couple cans on a cold evening. Despite it being June and balls hot in Florida, I enjoyed this beer thoroughly. Overall, Ten Fidy is another kick ass offering from Oskar Blues that is highly recommended!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Douglas14,4.63,"Pours out a deep, dark black color with a dark brown, thick head. This is an extremely viscous liquid. Roasted coffee, espresso and dark chocolate in the nose. The taste is incredible, burnt coffee beans, dark chocolate, cherries, bananas, and oak. It is heavy in the mouth and has a very full body. This beer is hands down the most fun beer to drink. I think it has to do with the fact that it comes in a can and it's an incredible beer. I can't stop drinking these things. They're so good and fun. It's weird, but I feel that's the only way to explain it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Pleepleus,4.06,"They made one minor error when packaging this beer, the got the name wrong. It should not be Ten Fidy but 10-W-50. Poured from a can to a pint glass like dirty motor oil out of an '87 Cadillac Brougham. It stained the glass with it's blackness. Had a sweet roasted malt, chocolate, coffee smell. The taste was sweet coffee, toffee, roasted malts, syrupy deliciousness. This drank like a muddy maple syrup. Wow I can't believe that was just poured out of a can. This is a slow sipper but very good. I look forward to introducing this one to friends.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,shbobdb,4.65,"Wow. Way to shatter all the stereotypes that exist about canned beer! This beer blubs out of the can like a thick sludge. Wow.  My first impression of the appearance is that this beer is *dark*. Even at the thin parts of my SA glass, no light comes through. Pitch-black. The head is a very nice deep chocolate.  The smell of the beer is fairly muted. Plenty of bready grains, and a nice bit of chocolate and roast. Good stuff.  But it is the taste where it really shines. Despite being as dark as it is, the beer isn't overly acidic. There is just a nice soft roastiness to it, coupled with truckloads of anise. They had to have put licorice in this beer, the taste is just too knock-your-socks-off for them not to have. Since I really like licorice/anise, I'm happy with that. A nice bit of milk chocolate makes its way through as well. Mmmmm. Good stuff.  Mildily tongue-numbing, mildly carbonated, the mouthfeel is full but not too full. It could be over-the-top crazy, but instead of a gooey mess it drinks more like a nice glass of milk. Certainly full, but you could pound it if you were so inclined.  Wow, thanks ColoradoBobs. Great, great stuff.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Dark think looking motor oil with 1 inch brown head that dissipated quickly. S-Great espresso chocolate smell. No vegetal smells. Not super compelx but really nice. T-So thick, bitter espresso, chocolate, light dark fruit taste as warms, some alcohol burn and astringency on the end. M-So full in the mouth, undercarbonated, the astringency causes not to be totally smooth. D-This is a sipper for sure. I could put down one more on a cold night.

Very roasted malts, and I mean roasted. Charred might even be a better term. Full, creamy and very velvety on the mouthfeel. This has a close feel as a weak milkshake as you can get. This would be very complimentary to a good dark dessert. Can't get over the amount of roast, chocolate and coffee that is here. Over the top, but good beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,McDiddyPop,3.73,"I was excited to try this for my first time today at the World of Beer in Tampa.  I poured a 12oz can into a pint glass. It poured a very viscous, opaque BLACk. They may as well call it 10-W Fidy because it looks like used motor oil. Very thin brown head left a small amount of lacing on the glass. It smelled of roasted coffee, molasses and a mild hoppiness. It tased a bit sweet with caramel and coffee and a slight alcohol warmth on the back of the throat. It was a very sticky beer that was a bit much for me. I am glad to have had it, but I am not in any hurry for more.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Homerbag,4.32,"Looks and pours like motor oil with 5000 miles on it. Thin mocha head.  Big notes of roasted coffee, bittersweat chocolates, roaste malt, and dark fruits. Tastes of fine roasted coffee with a date sweetness that is very faint. Malts are strong but not unbalanced. Alcohol is there but not in the taste, or aftertaste, but in the effects. Feel is thick and smooth.  Hard to believe this came in a can. Very impressed with this one.

Anyways, this ""oil"" can empties out a very dark imperial stout brown. Thick finger of tight, dark cocoa brown head. Very nice lacing up the tulip glass. Nose of roasted barley, with some dark fruit sweetness (currants, figs, raisins), and some bittersweet dark chocolate notes. Also pick up some herbal hops.  Strong roasted barley and coffee flavors up front. Numbing herbal hop bitterness as well. Some dark fruits get lost among the intense bitterness and roasted malts/coffee. Aggressive alcohol bite and very warming. Lingering dark candy sugar and plum sweetness. Did I mention warming? Full-bodied with a thick, creamy feel.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Oxymoron,4.36,"A staple favorite of mine for sure. Pours a jet black color. The first thing I notice is the viscosity on this sucker. Great legs, has the consistency of motor oil. Even when you are finished the glass has a tinted color. A soft darker tan head with good retention and lacing throughout.  The nose is complex with malt notes but soft with a limited quality. Some notes of chocolate and roast. Noticeable lacto notes with some silkiness almost consistent of a oatmeal stout. Very soft with lighter notes of coffee. I would have liked to see more astringency but ok. There are lighter ester notes in the back ground, cherries, raspberries and some rose characteristics. Noticeable solvent/alcohol notes but blended nicely.  The taste is more distinct than the nose indicated. Still a good complexity but more distinct chocolate, roast and coffee notes. Some lacto/silk textures remain with hints of oat like flavors. The esters are toned down as well, which helps the maltiness come out more. Feint cherries and figs mostly. Noticeable alcohol as well. There is a light red wine like finish that leaves a odd aftertaste.  The body is big. Full palate for sure. A lot going on here but with the silkiness makes it easy to drink. A definite must for stout lovers.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The aroma is chocolate, caramel, earthy hops, but pretty weak nose.  The taste starts with citrus bitter hops, then has a soft floural essence, with a sweet caramel feel that finishes again bitter hoppy dark chocolate syrupy mouthfeel. Decent imperial stout something I might visit again overall a bit sloppy and not what I expect from a great brewery like Oskar Blues.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,HardcoreKeith,3.92,"Like sludge. Gurgling sounds emanated from the can. I think there was a tire and a boot in there as well. Not really. Smells like caramel and molasses. Some chocolate and coffee in there too. Up front on the taste is those 98 IBUs, but they actually fit pretty well here. The alcohol taste is also a little prominent. Then there's the taste of roasted barley and chocolate malt. Mouthfeel is thick and appropriate, with low carbonation. This one's a slow sipper.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Flavor inititally of dark chocolate, but the hops quickly present, and the finish is seriously bitter. Great mouth feel. A really good, huge Imperial Stout. Note: I had a second tasting on 3/27 and let it breathe for a while (15-20 minutes). The bitterness still lasts, but all that chocolatey, malty goodness presented right up front and went along for the ride.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,ThatWineGuy,4.23,"Courtesy of Karen and Jeremy, thanks, shared amongst the gathering at biegaman's Saison tasting. Poured motor oil black, opaque with a thin brown head. Bubbles are miniscule, observed at the edges of the glass. Smell of coffee beans and cocoa. Astringent in the mouth, tastes of overpowering bitter dark chocolate, I found it bone dry with sharp edges and with a lingering astringency that was almost annoying in its dryness. The alcohol was cleverly hidden. The finish was extremely long. Altogether, this is a really nice example of an Imperial Stout and I'd love to try it again sometime.  Update June 1, 2009, the same beer sampled from a can. My notes would be almost the same but there is a molasses smell in the mix and I would rate the drinkability and mouthfeel a half-point higher as the astringency is not quite so dominant without sacrificing the full flavours. Again, a very long finish and the alcohol again is well handled. Cheers!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,nkruback,4.51,"One of my favorite beers of all time. I would love to see what Ten Fidy would be like cellared, but I just don't see that happening.  Pours darker than a black steer's tuckus on a moonless prarie night (B.L.). The lack of carbonation only helps out the originality of this fine brew.  Viscous, intimidating, and always sought after, Ten Fidy is a thing of beauty. I never drink more than two, always trying to curtail moderation in fine things.  Lack of carbo hurts the smell-score, but I just can't bring myself to give it lower than a 4, on anything. Creosote, toffee, leather, briquettes, gear oil, and all other delicious dark liquids find their way into the flavor profile of this beer. It's just that complex.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ewright,3.56,"A: This can issues forth inky blackness that absorbs all light that falls on its surface. A thin layer of espresso-like head forms on top and slowly dissipates to a ring around the glass.  S: Faint hints of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate. I love the aroma, but it could be stronger. I'd rate this .5 - 1 point higher if the nose was more prominent.  T: Too much alcohol burn up front. Behind the burn I sense flavors of prune and burnt sugar. Late EDIT: The burn diminishes as the beer warms up. Some coffee notes are obvious. Bumping +.5  M: Thick, chewy, creamy ... carbonation is light and very fine. The only drawback is the strength of the alcoholic aftertaste.  D: This is such a mixed bag ... it looks and feels great. It could smell great if it was more pronounced. The taste ... hard to say, but the alcohol burn is just too prominent to mark this very high.

2681,34483,AgingWarrior,4.43,"Poured as black as motor oil. Absolutely no light coming through this drink. Topped off by a finger of reddish brown foamy head that provided plenty of lacing.  Smeill is chocolate and raisins, in a great mixture. The first whiff of Ten Fidy I knew it was going to be a winner.  Taste is heavily weighted with coffee, but very smooth and unlike a lot of other brews in the class you don't really taste the alcohol. There is no astringent alcohol taste that usually turns me off to a RIS.  Mouth feel is smooth ans creamy, full bodied and very drinkable.  This may be the finest example in the style that I've ever sampled. I simply love this one.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Seanibus,4.68,"This is an astonishingly rich beer, remarkable in many ways, but its very size probably works against it as a drinkable beer. Only the heartiest of souls will want more than one of these in a session. In fact, this might be the only beer you can take in a day.  Pours incredibly black, with a slow-developing black-to-brown head that froths like a well-poured stout out of a nitro tap. The smell is powerfully woody and chocolaty and noticeable inches away from the glass. The taste is everything an Imperial Stout should should be - charred wood, bourbon, chocolate, raisins, coffee. It has a lingering bitter, smoky finish that clings to the tongue. The mouthfeel is amazing - rich, clingy, and luxurious. This is a beer to sip and enjoy over a long period. The beer's vast character, however, hurts its overall drinkability. Not everyone is going to want such a beer and even die-hard stout fans might find it too heavy under many circumstances.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Smell: Sweet licorice, vanilla, and caramel were most prominent for me. Some chocolate and wood undertones. The aroma of licorice snaps was very pleasing.  Taste: Vanilla and dark chocolate were quite demonstrative. A great compromise of sweetness and bitterness. Not overly sweet, but no bitter after-bite either. Chocolate and caramel played a larger role in the latter half of this beer. It's a powerhouse without smacking you in the face.  Mouthfeel: Smoother than silk. Words may not do its smoothness justice in my opinion. Smooth and powerful like a well-made triple-shot mocha. Did I mention it was smooth?  Drinkability: If you appreciate a solid RIS, this is a must drink. I wish it was readily available in my area. Finishing off my pint was like the end of a roller coaster ride - I was satisfied, relaxed, but mostly disappointed it was over and damn thankful I had the experience. This beer doesn't leave you wanting, just wanting more.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,woodychandler,5,"This is one of the original CANQuest (tm) reviews. I am loathe to amend it, but there are a couple of things that need done.  From the CAN: ""Cross-eyed. Cyclopean. Cancupiscent.""; ""Half-Baked. Fully Roasted Ale""; ""this dog'll hunt.""; ""Pack It In, Pack It Out""; ""CANS Infinitely Recyclable"".  CAN you dig it, man?  I am giving myself over to hedonism in support of the troops on Memorial Day weekend. I am joining a nudist colony, the '70's show about swingers has reopened people's eyes to the lifestyle, some ganja is on the menu ...  And now - Ten Fidy at 1103 (Local, EDT). In cracking open the top of the can, it was filled to the brim! Holy microbrew, Batman! I had beer everywhere, as though the can could barely contain its contents. This would NOT be the canned beer to drink on the Schuyllkill Expressway headed to Wachovia Center. What a friggin' mess!  The viscosity of this beer is what immediately jumped out. Thick, full, motor oil, you name it, as long as its black and thick, you got it. Hey, wasn't there a '70's era porn star who might apply? You get the idea.  The head, which was easily two fingers of mocha brown, actually cascaded. The retention was low, but the lacing was mad nice, yo!  I just laughed at the appearance. ""Would monsieur care for a nice glass of motor oil?"" or ""You're going to put THAT in ME?!?"" (squealing with a joy usually unheard). F**ksake! Deep, dark brown, black, really. Viscous, unforgiving.  The nose was all of it. Chocolate, coffee, raisins, anything deep, dark, and bitter.  Mouthfeel? Is this beer?!? I've eaten fudge that was less thick!  Drinkability: 10% in a CAN?!? I'll down a sixer at my local. Sweet!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ckeegan04,4.22,A - Black as oil an pours like it as well. Thin dark brown head with almost no retention. Excellent lacing.  S - Espresso and alcohol. Very strong coffee smell.  T - Dominated by the coffee taste but also a hint of chocolate. Super malty but enough hop bite to provide a good balance. Has to be a ton of hops to balance out the malt. Be sure to let this one warm a little as it is rather bland if too cold but comes to life as it warms.  M/D - Full bodied and super smooth. Just a little carbonation. Very drinkable RIS.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,wagenvolks,4.29,"Thanks to rtratzlaff for the local hook-up...enjoy that ruination!  12 oz. can into a Duvel chalice.  Pours an opaque, seal brown body with a tall, creamy, dark brown head. The foam is so dark that swirling the glass blends the outer reaches of the head into a blackened, oily mass. Retention is phenomenal, and some nice lacing gets left behind. I've smelled better RIS's, but the aroma is still good: roasted milk chocolate malts, espresso, vanilla, and some nuttiness.  Huge roasted notes picked up immediately in the flavor: burnt coffee & cocoa. Resinous hoppy bite on the finish is balanced by a syrupy alcohol warmth. One of the better usage of hops you'll find in an RIS. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, creamy, uber-thick and well-carbonated. Lingering burnt malts and hops last a bit too long on the finish...I'm still tasting this beer fifteen minutes later. All in all, Oskar Blues delivers yet another enjoyable brew. The alcohol is noticable, but at 10%, I'm suprised that it doesn't detract from the experience. Definately worth seeking out again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,brdc,4.5,"Thanks SPLITGRIN for this one. Can poured into a snifter.  Pitch black, with a nice, fluffy cocoa colored head, with good retention and lots of lacing. Very nice, strong aroma of roasted malts; chocolate; coffee, molasses, and even some dark fruits make an appearance. Quite full on the palate, a deep flavor that resonates the aroma, and it matched my late night chocolate quite well. Finishes dry/bitter. Drinkability is quite good for such a tasty, full bodied stout. Impressive, and very worthwhile. Not a lot of beers tating like this out of a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,marcpal,3.06,"Had this one alongside a Storm King to see if I could pick up differences. This one was good but came up short.  12oz can poured into snifter.  A: This thing looks like motor oil. Thats all there is too it- intimidating from a can.  N: Roasted chocolate and malts. I do detect some licorice on this one but an absence of hop flavors.  T: Roasted coffee, espresso and raisins. As it warmed, I actually didnt like the flavor as much and tasted more of the alcohol and burn. Far from put off tasting, but not great. Something I cant pinpoint here but the strength of roast is not pleasant.  M: Coatingly thick, a bit too much. Some bitterness would have been helpful to balance this one out.  D: High alcohol detection, overly thick oily feel leads this to lower ratings. I far favor the Storm King and may not just be my style here.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,israel,4.68,"What can you say about Ten Fidy that hasn't already be said. This beer pours like used motor oil, and is only ever recognizable as beer when the espresso colored head forms. The head clings to the sides of the glass, but never really sticks around. The aroma is big with it's notes of coffee and dark chocolates. The flavor certainly follows suit with the aroma, but the chocolate notes really seem to dominate the initial flavors. The mouthfeel is really deceiving as initially the beer goes down smooth, but leaves a sensation of the back of your throat being coated with syrup. This may sound unappealing but only adds to the experience with an intense after tast that hangs around for quite some time. This beer comes across as immensely drinkable, but with the high ABV. it is wise to refrain. Overall this beer deserves any hype that it may receive, and I am always on the look out for it. This beer has really opened my eyes to what an imperial stout can taste like, and has got me even more excited about whats next.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,mhewes,4.28,A : Pours a thick black motor oil with a nice brown head that stuck around.  S : Roasted malts with some chocolate and alcohol notes. Pretty much what I would expect from an Imperial Stout  T : Wow. It's got roasted malts with some coffee flavors. It's got some chocolate flavors also. It finishes with a nice hop bitterness that just rounds out the flavor.  M : Creamy and smooth. It's a meal in a glass  D : It's a sipper but one I plan on getting more of to drink.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,claytri,4.41,"The beer poured coal black with a good bit of light brown head that stayed throughout. The smell was of roasted malt with a hint of sweetness. The taste was of toasted malt a little sweetness on the back end and bit of coffee mixed in. The feel was heavy and dry.

2681,34483,WanderingFool,4.27,"Ten Fidy pours a deep black color with a small, creamy tan head on top. A fair amount of lace clings to the glass as the foam dissolves.  The aroma is rich roasted malt and chocolate. Each sip of this full bodied beer is very smooth, but a little bit thin. A mild tingle on the top of the tongue lets you know some carbonation is present. The flavor is malty sweet with lots of roasted malt, chocolate, and toffee. Towards the end some nutty notes and a hint of bitterness poke through. It finishes with a taste of alcohol and leaves behind flavors of chocolate and roasted malt when gone.  This is a very easy to drink, full flavored stout. It hides its 10% abv very well.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Goliath,4.3,"Pours black and completely opaque making no head even with a more aggressive pour. As you move the beer around the glass, the sides develope a brown tinge reminiscient of Sam Adams Triple Bock.  The aroma is familiar, pretty typical Imperial Stout. Roasted malts showing some chocolate, caramel, and a bit of alcohol. Also a subtle hoppiness in the background.  Taste is very good. Strong roasted malt boasting chocolate, and a little coffee. A gentle bitter hop bite lingers on the finish. Alcohol is well hidden  Mouthfeel is thick yet creamy and is seemingly still as the carbonation is very delicate. It's quite perfect in my opinion.  Drinkability is moderate. Great flavors are easy to consume, however they are too strong to down in large quantities. A well crafted stout, and I love the canning idea.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,FleeVT,3.91,"12oz black label can with the motto ""Half-Baked, Fully Roasted"". Not dates, poured into a snifter.  A: An extremely dark (read black) thick beer with a dark tan head that really sticks to the glass.  S: Chocolate milk, seriously. Not an overpowering nose, but malty sweetness in the form of milk chocolate. Mild crisp hops balance it out.  T/M: Thick and rich. Palate is dominated by the roasted coffee beans with a chocolate backdrop and the finishes with a nice little hoppy bitterness and smokey fullness. Hints of dark berries contribute to the chocolate sweetness. Alcohol is detectable throughout but not in an obscene way. This is a heavy beer with more carbonation than I expected considering the style. Nice warming effect with the alcohol.

A slow sipper but a good one.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,barefootbrewer,4.25,A - This beer poured like motor oil out of the can. In the glass it is opaque with a thick brown head....very inviting.  S - Roasted and malty. There is also a bit of a currant note?  T - Wow! Malty and roasted. Perhaps a touch of licorice. This is what an RIS should be - malty and dark and compelling.  M - Full and creamy.  D - I'm impressed. Quite smooth and drinkable.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,zdk9,4.01,"A- Pours a deep dark rich motor oil liquid into my pint. This stuff is black and not the full light of day penetrates an inch into it. A small finger of dark cocoa colored head covers the oil. At first there are very strong sheet-rings of lacing, but after drinking a third of the beer these dissapear. (So close to a 5, and for a catagory I rarely give much thought to.)  S- Coffee, chocolate, woody bourbon. There is a good complexity to the smell, but it isn't strong enough to leave up to the strength of the taste.  T- Chocolate flavors, coffee flavors, a touch of maple syrup. There's a bit of hops citrus, though hardly detectable. Mostly roasted malts dominate this one, but I'm not dissapointed by it- these are great flavors. There's also a decent clip of alcohol flavor.  M- Increadibly milk and smooth. The alcohol burns just a bit in the back of my throat, but overall the mouthfeel on this is amazing.  D- Wow! My first canned craft beer, and I have to say it was a good choice. This must have some great ingredients to have the smoothness, and blackness that it does. My only qualm was with the strengh of the smell, but even that was delicious. Highly reccomended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Slatetank,4.43,"Poured from the 12oz can into a snifter and half pint slightly chilled. A - An opaque black that allows only a sliver of light through. The head is like chocolate milk w/ a rocky surface and a thickness of about 1 1/2 fingers. The bead is ultra fine and the head seems to condense on itself  S - Rich, earthy and an almost minty hop aroma is nestled in to a tobacco and chocolate note that is accented by plenty of caramel, vanilla bean and bready yeast aromas. Herbal and nutty w/ a clean malt fragrance and slightly smokey tinge mingled w/ the pine hint in the hops  M - Thick and rich like A1 steak sauce - mostly malt, but plenty of hop spice and fruitiness in the feel . There is an aspect of booziness in the warming end of this viscous stick-to-the-cheeks stout. The mild carbonation allows the smoky, highly roasted element to become more pronounced  T - Rich and sweet w/ caramel and cocoa at the first taste. The smoky black malt taste is bittersweet chocolate w/ a french roast and intense blackberry sweetness w/ seeded bitter flavor. The malt is roasted, but mostly sweet. The hops get pinier as it warms and the intensity is gradually fuller, but even more satisfying. Plum, currant, and hints of blueberry w/ a hint of cinnamon and high cocoa content chocolate bar w/ a light pepper note. The hops are balancing but not overly bitter, more herbal and they add to the sweet malt layers. The flavor has bean - vanilla and coffee are both there w/ a subtle citrus/floral element. The bitterness of the malt w/ creamy caramel is oh-so pleasant 1/2 way in w/ even more spice and fruit contrast. The toastiness is the anchor w/ spice cake and cocoa adding to the round fullness.  D - A great Imperial Stout so full and complex w/ a boozy spicey edge and a drinkable beer in relation to the style and excellent Imperial Stout in a can that you are encouraged to try",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,crookedhalo,4.13,"This is my second review from the can, and no, I'm not sitting on the toilet. Had to wipe off the lip of the can because it had all kinds of dust and crud that I didn't want in my beer.  Anyhow, it pours up looking like Texas crude, black as night with a nice chocolate milk brown head. I chose my Duvel tulip for this one. The head is two-fingered and lasting, leaving good lacing behind. Wonderful aromas of dark chocolate, black patent and chocolate malts, some vinous notes, a touch of espresso, and a hint of cashew or shelled pistachio. Really viscous at first sip, with a full-on roasty character, some astringency, floweriness and smokiness in the finish. Again, really thick, yet soft on the palate, slick on the tongue. A nice change of pace is that it's pretty hoppy, very bold for an IS. I was expecting a tinge of metallic taste from the can but I'm not really picking up on that, and there are just bonus points for said lack of metallic taste. I'm just amazed that some significant hops came through in this viscous mass of a stout. A very nice slow sipper.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

T - Slightly sweet chocolate/lactose flavor upfront followed by a smokey/bitter finish.  MF&D - A thick and creamy full bodied RIS. The alcohol warmth makes this one a sipper.

2681,34483,phisig137,3.71,"A- Pours a ""none more black"" that doesn't let any light though, even around the thinnest edges. A very deep milk chocolate colored, two finger head has phenomenal retention, and leaves great lacing behind. Very viscous, scary, and beautiful.  S- Heavy amounts of roast and toast here, with little else present. Molasses, chocolate, espresso, brown sugar, burnt caramel, and a heavy mocha latte aroma make this very malt forward.  F- Again, heavily toasted/roasted malts take the front line in this. Chocolate especially dominates the flavor with a heavy coffee presence as well. After the first sip though, this turn downward a bit. The roasted malt character is a bit overpowering, leading to a burnt/metallic type flavor. Finish is astringent and acrid from the heavily roasted malts. A touch of hops are apparent on the finish, but are overshadowed.  M- Thick, heavy, sticky, and full  D- decent at best. This is definitely a sipper for many reasons.  Overall, this is a solid RIS, but could be a bit better. Spinal Tap references aside, this could use a little less roasted malt. It simply tasted burnt. That being said, it is an impressive beer, and well worth picking up for $3 a can. I'll hold onto a couple of these for a year or two, and they should do quite well. Until then, this is just a little unbalanced. Oskar Blues usually does a great job of ""overdoing"" beers, but this is just a little too far to the burnt end of the spectrum.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A nice black, thick pour that oozed into the glass. Had a nice tan head that left some lacing. As you tip the glass, the beer leaves a dark yellow residue on the glass. Very impressive.  S: Smells of smoke, heavily roasted malts, caramel, coffee, toffee, nuts and alcohol. Wanted to jump right in.  T: Just as good as it smelled. The roasted malt hits you, but tastes of cream, coffee, nuts, smokiness, and chocolate finish it off. Even with all of this, still has some hops to it. Lots of flavor.  M: Got a low carbonation and very heavy. Sticks to your mouth just as it did to the glass. Makes it extra enjoyable because the flavors linger for quite some time.  D: Very drinkable.

Smell is super malty with dominant aromas of fresh ground coffee, espresso beans and roasted malt. Also some dark chocolate which gives a bit of sweetness.  Taste is an awesome, rich combo of coffee, espresso and roasted malt. They are the dominant flavors. It's amply bitter but has some sweetness, too, with some dark chocolate flavor.

2681,34483,GClarkage,4.4,"05/09/08- Received as a gift from BA member Talisker.  Presentation- 12oz can with no freshness info. Poured into a random pint glass.  Appearance- Deep black and thick used motor oil pour. Starts off with a good 3/4 inch brown head and shrinks to the slightest rim upon consumption. Leaves moderate lace patches.  Smell- Notes off chocolate, coffee, deep malt and a bit of alcohol. Kind of restrained though.  Taste- At first it seems like a random good RIS until the end of the taste. The flavor hits you about 3 seconds after you swallow. Massive chocolate and a mild coffee taste swill around each other...not to mention the considerable hop flavors as well. Like a chocolate grapefruit soda.  Mouthfeel- Brisk and tight carbonation with a tremendous hoppy-chocolate aftertaste. Thick and chewy as well.  Drinkability- Even with the great aftertaste, it doesn't quite reach the heights of Stone, Speedway or some of the other top notch RIS's I've had.

2681,34483,AltBock,4.37,"12 oz. can that has a picture of...Wait a minute! Did I say can? I sure did! It's more than likely the only Imperial Stout that's available in a can. It's a black and silver colored can with the name of the beer in front of the Colorado Rockies. All over the can are some funny and stuipd quotes. Those quotes escape me right now. The only other stuff on this can is the US Government warning and the barcode. No date anywhere on the can. Not even a stamped date on the bottom.  Appearance: Who's the funny man who replaced the beer with a thick motor oil. It's not funny because I really wanted to try this beer. Wait a minute! This thick black liquid is the frickin' beer! It's so thick and black that no light can even come close to penatrating this beer's solid black body. The only down point to the appearance is the head of tan colored foam. It started off at the 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch mark, but from there, it quickly dissiapted into a few tan rings along the edge and one single solitary spot of tan lace. So sad it couldn't leave more lace, but it was still a great solid black appearance.  Smell: The aroma to this beer is a bit on the overpowering side. The aroma is chock full of the darkest roasted flavors you can ever find in a beer. Some of the dark aromas that I found in this beer are; roasted coffee beans, dark roasted malts, black cherries, plums, bitter dark chocolate, black raspberries, more roasted coffee beans, very subtle caramel, a pinch of dark roasted hops, and plenty of alcohol. Just a woderfully strong dark aroma that will more than likely overwhelm your sense of smell.  Taste: After all of these dark flavors, the taste was light and fluffy with toasted malts...Who am I kidding? The taste was like everything else in this beer, powerful and dark. It starts off with some bitter dark chocolate and dark roasted malts. Then all of a sudden, in comes this overwhelming taste of roasted coffee beans and bitter dark roasted hops. If you're not ready for it, you will almost gag on those dark flavors. The taste is that powerful! After the big hit of dark roasted flavors, it settles down with black cherries, plums, more dark chocolate, and a big bite of alcohol. Just be warned! Make sure your taste buds are up to the challenge and can handle a taste this big!  Mouthfeel: If I could go above saying that this beer is full bodied I would. It's an overwhelming powerful full bodied beer that just so happened to have a full flavored dark and bitter aftertaste of roasted coffee beans, roasted malt, dark chocolate, roasted hops, and tons of alcohol. Not so much alcohol that it took over everything else. It was just there to make its presense known to the consumer. This aftertaste will linger on in your mouth for about an hour. It takes alot of water to clean your palate.  Drinkability: Ten Fidy is definitely one of those sipping beers and one of those once in a while brews. It's far to overpowering to drink on a daily basis. Not a beginner beer! If you want some Ten Fidy, make sure your tastebuds are up to the challenge.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Looked dark as hell with a rusty brown looking small head with a subtle aroma of coffee beans.

2681,34483,justinmartz,3.98,"Let me preface this review by saying that I had this at the Falling Rock Tap House in Denver and they charged me NINE FUCKING DOLLARS for ONE CAN. Since then I've been able to buy a four-pack for $8.49.  Hubba hubba, this is one pretty looker! This thing pours an impenetrable blackness for which there is no escape but the tan head ensconced above it. The color and viscosity are near that of a warm balsamic reduction. The Whoppers and ice cream used in the brew come through in the aroma, along with some alcohol. After all, this is an imperial stout. With its low carbonation and medium body it drinks easier than others in the style. The roasted barley hits up front with a hop bitterness towards the back, while the finish is mildly dry and pleasantly bitter.  Were it not for the persistent alcohol I would have rated it higher. I know this is partly what typifies the style but I wish it could have been covered up more.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Lnedrive14,4.29,"2 general comments:  1) just because it is actually a pretty decent beer in a can, does not make it the best beer ever just because it is in a can 2) if there ever was a beer to drink for dessert, this is clearly it  A: Pours like motor oil. Only thing saving its aesthetics was that it poured with a pretty nice head, which was incredibly dark, like tree bark. S: PRetty amazing here. Instantly upon pouring aroma fills the entire room. Complex, overpowering, but in a good way. T: It's good. Really dark chocolate (like 85% cocoa), roasted malts, bitter coffee. M: I think it was the mouthfeel that ruined the taste a little for me. had it been a bit more full bodied it could have handled the extreme bitterness better. perhaps more malts would have been better. D: Pretty damn drinkable, but for the love of god, don't drink it out of the can!  also, really tough to clean the glass afterwards - an intense beer!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Donnie2112,4.49,"appearance: black with a typical chocolate brown head and lacing  smell: very rich and rummy on the nose, plenty of vanilla, cocoa and coffee on the nose  taste: the coffee really comes out on the tongue, very toasty, a nice light sweetness and actually a bit of citrus from the hops on the finish.  mouthfeel: rather heavy on the pallet, very creamy, not too much carbonation.  drinkability: very nice, you want another sip but you probably wouldn't be able to drink a whole ton of these just because of how heavy they are. I really like it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Backer2004,4.1,"This was the one beer I was looking forward to trying on my trip to denver. It only took me one stop at falling rock tap house, where they had one left for $5. Dark as oil and almost as thick. Nice tan head, almost too easy to consume to watch out! Alcohol is not noticeable, some raisins and plums. I have enjoyed better imperial stouts, but never in a can. Worth it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Pauly2X,3.83,"A- Pitch black, 1 1/2 finger brown head.  S- Strong roasted malt with strong earthy hop aromas.  T- Strong roasted malt flavor dances with a slight sweetness in the begining. The bitterness of the roasted malt which comes through in the middle lends way nicely to the strong but not too overpowering hop finish.  M- No complaints.  D- I'll have to try it again, eventually.  Altough a little over the top for me, this would be a must try if you're an Imperial Stout fan.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Atron67,4.13,"thanks wolfsblood for the trade  A- poured a dead black with a clear body with a big brown frothy head on top that rose slowly but stayed for awhile. light to decent lacing was left around the glass as it slowly fell down  S- very strong chocolate character with a bit of roasted body to it as well. smooth very light alcohol presence. malty character  t_ as the last review noted there is some pretty noticable hop character wihch i didnt notice in the nose, but was pretty evident at that point right before you taste it on your tongue. i woudlnt say it detracts all that much cuz to me it was swallowed pretty quickly by the malts and became really a malt machine where the hops were more balance than character. very creamy and smooth and I wouldnt expect a 10% to be like this. very smooth roasted body to it.  M- extremely creamy and very light carbonation, thick as hell body.  D- pretty damn good,",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SQNfan,3.02,"Poured from can. This was black in color with very fine brown bubbles that dissipate quickly. The nose is quite hoppy with grapefruit clearly poking out along with dark chocolate. The grapefuit edge makes this very strange for me. There is more of the same in the mouth with the grapefruit, sour cherry and dark chocolate lingering to a bitter finish.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,tempest,4,"Wow, it does pour like oil from a can. It's sitting pitch black and viscus in my glass with a short tan head.  The aroma is hoppy at first then I'm pulling out cracker and toasted biscuit with a light note of dark roasted grains. It tastes a lot like slightly watered down chocolate syrup in that its got a lot of cocoa with sweet sugary feel. The aftertaste has a hit of roasted brley along with citrus rind and grapefruit hops.  Overall, the flavor profile and aroma are different than the average RIS. And for a 10% beer, it's pretty drinkable and the alcohol is well hidden. However, for such a big beer, I'd expect bigger flavor.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Traquairlover,3.68,"12-oz can poured into a pint glass.  A = Pours like old engine oil, thick and so dark brown it is pretty much indistinguishable from black. Forms small dark brown head which dissipates slowly, leaves medium lacing on glass.  S = Strong bitterness and hops flavors mixed Turkish coffee, evaporated milk, flowers. Interesting smells, but frankly a little too hoppy and flowery for my tastes in an imperial stout.  T = Strong coffee tastes mix with both bitterness and pine tastes from hops. As with the smell, the pine and floral tastes of the hops just don't meet my expectations. It's not bad, but it's not my cup of tea. I'd prefer an RIS with perhaps some of the bitterness of hops, but not the strong flavors. Tastes too much like I mixed a coffee stout with an IPA. There's not inherently wrong with doing that, but it's not what I'm looking for in an RIS.  M = Heavy, heavy body, luscious creamy feel, great mouthcoating. One of the best mouthfeels I've ever experienced in a beer.  D = This is a drinkable beer but with the ABV and the mixed tastes of RIS and IPA, I think this is one where I really have to be in the right mood.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TheEremite,4.01,"Received as a gift from metallitone1. Thanks again.  Poors black with a dark tan/light brown head. Coffee, malty and carbonic aroma. Smells a little soy saucy, like it's going to be super syrupy. Tastes very dry though. Lots of chocolate and coffee flavor, not too sweet. Very drinkable. The roasted malt is a little biting, but I could still drink it all night. I'm really glad I got to try this beer. If it were local, I'd stock it regularly.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ommegangpbr,4.03,"Russian Imperial Stout in a can? Yes, please. Pours a very pretty pour. opaque black with a deep brown head... hard not to like the look of it. Scents are varied, strong and deep. Chocolate is the first thing to hit and after a bit I get some whiskey. I tasted a whiskey not long ago called Peat Monster and there are some strong similarities. Roasty, toasty scents, roasty, toasty flavors. A bit of chimney. Dark, bitter chocolate with some notes of smooth milk chocolate piping in here and there. I think I can taste the connection to this and Dale's Pale ale in the hop character. Maybe coffee with citrus rind thrown into the mix? That's what the hops seem to do in here. The first comparison that comes to my mind is Brooklyn's Black Chocolate stout. For the money I'd say I'd have to choose the Brooklyn version, but for a more definitive comparison I'd have to do a head to head taste test.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bobbinalong,4.13,"A: Dark as night on the far side of Pluto. Not much head with very sticky lacing. S: Burnt malt dominates but chocolate holds it own. T:Nice balance at first that quickly gives way to malt and more malt. Finish is hops dipped in chocolate. M:To call this creamy is an understatement. It's like taking a scoop of Haagen Daus chocolate and letting it melt in your mouth. D:Slowed me to a crawl. Overall: A ""dessert"" beer that if given a little more finishing hops would be perfectly balanced. It's production probably explains the high price of grain right now!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,throwitallaway,3.48,"Fuck I already forgot who sent this to me. Thank you just the same! Poured from can into snifter. Very dark with a small brown head that fades quickly. Smells like an RIS, roasted malts, a little chocolate, and alcohol. Tastes similar, a pleasant roasted bitterness hits you first, with chocolate and alcohol following. Mouthfeel is right in middle and a little creamy. Drinkability is hurt by the alcohol being too prevalent. Not really my thing unfortunately, but tasty enough",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,DHGranstrand,4.31,"Thanks to lightindarkness for the TenFidy!! I have had two great trades with 'the man'!  Pours jet black with prodigious dark creamy head.  Nose of burnt chocolate, strong espresso and malt.  Strong espresso and burnt chocolate hit the tongue followed by anise and malt.  Very creamy but just a tad thin for such a strong flavored stout.  This is an incredible flavor rush. Very well balanced for a 10% abv. Just a little burnt for me but it is a strong contender.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,therica,4.26,"Amazing.  A= pours like old motor-oil out of a can, both of which are black. Little head, and of course looking more like foamed-chocolate. Entirely dense.  S= nice but not as powerful as the beer itself. Complex herbal hops scents, burnt everything you can think of, especially chocolate and coffee with a little rust-hint.  T= as bold as it appears. ""The kitchen-sink of beers"" I suspect. Burnt chocolates, malts, various hops that blend bitters and burnt tastes nicely. Coffee, no licorice or anise as I find frequently in these darker artist-craft beers, thankfully. Great from top to bottom.  M= burnt chocolate and mild bitters, a little sweet residue but not much.  D= great for maybe 1 or 2, a definite must-try for beer affectionados.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,InsolublePancake,4.35,"A- Well, this is pretty much black. I can't really imagine it getting much darker than this. It has a nice coffee-colored head too, along with decent lacing. This is quite an attractive beer.  S- Straight-up roasted malt here. Classic burnt malt aromas of bitter chocolate and espresso are present, forming a fantastic bittersweet character.  T- The taste is just as I would have expected given the smell. It's sweet upfront, with a chocolaty, brownie batter-like taste. The finish is bitter with coffee and a bit of piney hops.  M- Smooth and a little creamy with a medium-full body. Carbonation isn't too high, which is good for a beer like this.  D- I certainly wouldn't want more than a single can of this in a sitting. Even though the alcohol isn't really noticeable, it's still a very rich beer that I wouldn't want too much of at a time. Of course, it's not meant to be consumed in mass quantities, so I can't really hold that against it.  This is a great beer. I give it props for having a classic roasted malt profile. Those flavors are more prominent in this beer than in any other Imperial Stout I've had. The only thing keeping this from the very top of my list is a slight lack of complexity. The roasted malt flavors are great, but they're all this beer has to offer. It lacks some of the fruity character present in some of my favorite example of the style. Anyway, that's just a personal preference, and I'm really nitpicking at this point. Bottom line: if you like stouts, seek this one out. Highly recommended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,IPAcraig,4.77,"Pours out of the can like motor oil. Small brown head atop the massive black body.  Smells like cascade hop crusted dark chocolate. Bravo!  I was expecting the taste to blow my tastebuds away (like yeti), but that wasnt the case. Every flavor you want in a stout comes together near perfectly in this brew without being overpowering. Complex and drinkable. Very nice, indeed.  Rich and indulgent mouthfeel. Enveloping.  One of the best stouts I have had. Near perfection in a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BucBasil,4.05,"Appearance: Poured from the 12oz can into a goblet. The beer is thick and black, and absolutely no light escapes from it. Dark brown head grew to one finger thick with very poor retention.  Smell: Dark chocolate and black coffee with a slight of vanilla in the back.  Taste: Rich coffee on the introduction. Dark chocolate in the midpalate with a hint of roasted nuts, maybe hazelnut. Things stay pretty bitter through to the finish, which is a nice creamy chocolate note.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy, with a bit of carbonation. Smooth all the way through.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Proteus93,4.32,"A: Midnight black... this stuff is filthy motor oil black. A puffy medium to darker brown head, nice 'n sticky.  S: Something of a French roast coffee, some of the toffee characteristics of the style... this one has the black currant that I tend not to notice in many others. A light whiff of liquorice on the back end.  T: Deep roasted malts, bitter coffee beans, some dark fruit notes. Unsweetened chocolate, and a hoppy presence. I might try aging a couple cans to see what happens with that.  M: Creamy feel throughout the mouth, and leaving a sticky reminder behind post-finish. Fairly smooth and nice.  D: It's a pretty easy one, considering the ABV... the flavour can start to seem a little big after a while, but until that point, it's quite smooth and sexy.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,prototypic,4.41,"Many thanks to csmiley for his generosity.  Appearance: I'm floored. After cracking open the can and pouring it into a glass, the blackest beer I've ever seen sits before. It's an opaque onyx. Not one speck of light's getting through. It's truly a sight to behold. The head was also among the brownest I've seen. Very dark and imposing. It was somewhat minimal and dissipated relatively quickly. Light lacing lined the glass. But, this is an amazing beer to see. Truly top notch.  Smell: It's a little less vibrant here than I would've liked. Don't get me wrong. There's plenty of roasted and chocolate malt to go around. There's a nice coffee/espresso aroma that blends well. A bit of a lactose smell comes across which is interesting and a nice touch. Hops are much more apparent than I expected (which bumps it up to a ""4""). But, it still comes across as just a little weak in this department.  Taste: It's as good as advertised and picks up tremendously here. Chocolate and roasted malts create a very tasty flavor though the chocolate certainly tastes stronger. Great for a little chocolate fix. It does have a very interesting lactose flavor which is fantastic and gives it a creamy feel. I'll come back to that. The coffee flavor complements the other flavors well and plays its role perfectly. It's not overpowering, but certainly makes its presence known. I wasn't really expecting this to be hoppy, but it's got a nice bitter taste to it. The hop presence really elevates it to greatness. It finishes, bittersweet and dry.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It feels medium bodied. Carbonation is extremely low, but it works perfectly. It's extremely smooth. The lactose element really adds a lot in this regard and gives it an incredibly silky feel. It might be 10% abv, but you'd never know. Alcohol is not noticeable in any way and makes it incredibly drinkable.  Ten FIDY is quite the beer. One can only chuckle at the thought of an RIS this tasty being canned. But, Oskar Blues has pulled it off and crafted an extremely fine beer. It's every bit as good as advertised and perhaps a little better.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,orbitalr0x,3.58,"12oz can! Finally got some cans of this after trying it on tap and bourbon aged many times before. Pours into my glass a deep, brooding black, the most viscous beer pour from a can I've ever experienced. A small dark tan head shows up and settles to a ring around the top. Aromas start off with big deeply roasted malts alongside a mix of bittersweet chocolate and coffee tones. Weak brewed coffee with a cream accent. Big malty and chocolaty.  First sip brings a rich, big dark roasted malt body upfront. Bittersweet chocolate moves in along with somewhat of a creaminess. Brewed coffee makes an appearance. The oats provide a nice slick, creaminess as well. It finishes with a long, lingering roasted flavor and a subtle sweetness. Only a slight hint of noticeable alcohol.  Mouthfeel is rich, dense and viscous. It coats the palate as it goes down and the oats lend a smooth creaminess to each sip. Mellow carbonation works well here too. Overall, this is a solid, tasty imperial stout, but there are still plenty of others I'd grab first. This just doesn't have the depth of flavor I normally enjoy in a rich imperial stout. Thanks to warriorsoul for the cans.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SacoDeToro,4,"Served at the 2008 CBC in SD.  The beer poured a deep coal black with a nice dark brown head.  The aroma of the beer was full of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and ash. Some notes of coffee and dark fruits were in the background.  The flavor of the beer was focussed on roasty malts to the point of being a touch ashen. Mid-palate could've used a little more molasses/dark fruit sweetness. The hops seemed slightly citrusy and pretty up front. This can was pretty fresh and I'm sure this beer will age out well.  The mouthfeel was full, but was not too heavy. It finished pretty dry for a RIS. The carbonation seemed dialed in well.  A very solid RIS that's forcussed more on the ashen roasty end, but restrained enough so that it doesn't go overboard like The Abysss IMO. Very drinkable and accessable.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,czechsaaz,4.83,"Lots of chocolate aroma. Big roast malt and tons of base malt. Almost smells a little like candy.  Deep dark with a big thick head of tan foam. Very nice. Lost of brownish lacing sticks, almost like syrup to the sides of the glass.  First sip is mostly sweet malt flavors and some maple and caramelized sugar, deep dark rich sugar flavors. Then the roast kicks in. It's not big roast flavor but enough to give it some tartness. Hops are present for bittering and are at a nice level to do that job, but mostly the hops are an afterthought. Big yeast esters of ripe fruit and black cherry. It finishes with a lot of chocolate flavor. Yum...  Big thick mouthfeel. Very apprpriate for the style. Slight warming from the high alcohol level. Almost chewy.  Big huge sipper. A very worthy beer to put among the better impy stouts.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,peabody,4.8,This one pours out like motor oil. Rich fine brown foam that laces the pint glass. Aroma is smoke and peat and dark chocolate with rich yeast strains. Almost a fruitiness that I can't put my finger on. Taste is tobacco and chocolate burnt malts. Really good RIS here. Mouthfeel is very clean for such an oily concotion. Drinkability is still high here despite the 10% alcohol. mmm good.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BeerBelcher,4.1,"This was a good imperial stout, and by far the most drinkable one I can remember ever having. Thanks to SurlySober for bringing some cans back from VA in his wooden leg. As he surmised, if you were going to drink an imperial stout every day, this would be the one to have. I'd add that if you were looking for an imperial stout that got close to ""sessionable,"" this would be it.  Appearance was black and thick with a minimal tan head. Aroma was surprisingly floral to me; in addition to the usual aromas for this style (roastiness, coffee, etc) I got something that approached lavender. Flavor was hoppy and roasty and good, but not all that unusual - chalk this criticism up to how much I've heard about this beer prior to having. Mouthfeel was smooth and slick but a bit flat.  This is a really nice and drinkable beer. I would highly recommend it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,UnionMade,4.3,"Inky black, with a scarce, brown head. The head alone is darker than most beers, including craft ale. High marks on viscosity alone. It's intimidating to even look at. Despite the lack of a blooming head, lace sheets down the glass quite nicely. The head disappears, save a very thin collar clinging to the glass, before the beer starts to warm up. The aroma is heavily roasty, but overall sweet. Jammy dark fruits, slabs of dark chocolate and heaps of coffee. Molasses sticking to the lot. Maybe a little tree bark and charcoal as the beer warms. The flavor opens surprisingly mellow, given what my other senses are telling me. Rather than punishing my palate, I'm greeted with an extraordinarily silky smoothness that carries the bold flavors with elegance. Very round, without any sharp edges or angles. Very full bodied. Heavy roastiness comes across mostly as a dark chocolate with very high cocoa percentage. Lots of caramel providing an undercarraige of sweetness. Gummy molasses and berry flavors, leading into a balanced finish. Leans a bit towards bitter, evening out the oily sweetness up front. Strong, roasty bittersweetness, with pine-like hops maintaining a strong presence. A bit of alcohol to round things out. A very long, drawn out finish, roasty chocolate sticking around what seems like forever. Hi-test! Very happy to spot this one on tap at the local watering hole. I hope to see it again.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Foxman,4.58,"It pours as black as a moonless ebon night on a far-flung heath. Two fingers of velvety brownish tan head settle to a soft scoop of pillowy foam. A sheer wall of lacing scarps the inside of the glass.  The aroma graces with long and deeply roasted malt that's darkly earthy with dates, black cherry, cocoa, black coffee, and chocolate. A low-key toss of hop spice precedes a surprisingly soft blush of alcohol.  Upon sipping, the malt is singed artfully, teasing out bitter espresso, sweet toffee, and dried dark fruit, a light bite of black cherry and unsweetened chocolate. Hops spice moderately and play off a twist of licorice. The alcohol is much warmer here, but it's still craftily incorporated. Burnt biscuit bottom begins a very crisp and dry finish that slides easily into a long low hum of lingering bitterness. This is a glass full of inky black flavor excellence.  Full bodied, it flows thick and sticky like 40W mixed with syrup, and the glow it leaves is marked and homey.  If it's dark, earthy, and deeply brewed, it seems to be in here, like rich loam in a can. It's wickedly complex, it's deceptively well blended, and it can't help but inspire a warm smile with every eager sip. And speaking of warm, the ABV is present but still slightly subversive. Yet, it drinks especially well because it tastes so damned good, and feels awesome going down. For my money, it is well wirth the $3.50 a can it cost me, and I'll be buying it again, and gladly at that.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bosco7,4.3,"Scary looking. Pitch black, I can't recall a darker brew. The thin head is a few shades lighter than black.  Smells of chocolate and bread. There are some roasty aromas as well.  Starts sweet with a ton of dark chocolate. Some berry and cherry flavors follow. The finish is full of coffee and roasty flavors. Very dry finish to balance the sweet start. There is a lingering roastiness on the tongue.  The mouthfeel is luxurious, thick, and chewy. Amazing.  I am impressed with this brew. Flavors are great and the mouthfeel is unearthly. If you can find this consider yourself lucky. Highly recommended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,illidurit,4.55,"Can courtesy of peabody. Poured into a snifter. Pitch black with no highlights and a super dark brown head of about 2 fingers. Great retention with some solid lace.  Aroma is a really rich, bright, milky chocolate, with almost a graham cracker sweetness to it. No roastiness or booze, just delightful chocolate.  Taste leads you to believe it is similar to the aroma for about a millisecond before slamming the tongue with roasted coffee. A nice herbal hop bitterness melds well with the roasty bitterness to create a dry, lingering finish that has a bit of anise to it.  Mouthfeel is huge and chewy yet soft, with the perfect amount of carbonation. A very drinkable RIS.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A small tan head over top that dissolves down to a fine film fairly quickly.  Nose is pretty huge. Enormouse cookies, chocolate, molasses, some prunes, maybe cherry liqueur.  Flavor is likewise monstrous. Huge cookies, roasted malt, coffee. Rolls into chocolate. A touch of dried fruit. Light hops in the aftertaste. Maybe a hint of butter.  Body is thick and full. Lightly creamy. Mild to very mild carbonation, but it works well.  Excellent beer. Don't really recall many differences from my initial tasting, but it's fantastic nonetheless.  ORIGINAL: 4/19/08- 4.5/5/4.5/4.5/5 This beer is amazing, so I'll just start off with that. Pours a motor oil pitch-black with a deep amber/brown head. Mediocre looking lacing that drips the whole way through. Looks excellent. Nose is all over the place. First off lots of roasted malt, then a crazy hit of drying hops. Loads of cookies, chocolate, and some swirling dried fruit. Light spiciness. Incredibly sweet and delicious. Flavor's a lot hoppier; tons of coffee, crazy roasted malt. Dried fruit, very light alcohol flavors that come on stronger as it warms. Body is thick, although a little thinner than some other RISs I've had. hen I don't care that it's 10% ABV.

It even looks a little purple (Maybe it's the lighting in my kitchen).  S- Amazing! Dark chocolate & Mocha. Maybe even a little chocolate mousse nuances.  T- Very very nice. Lots of chocolate & lots of coffee.  M- Very well rounded. It actually has some soft characteristics to it.

Head is three fingers of rocky chocolate colored head with great retention. Leaves lots of lace. Nose is just as big with smoked malt, toasted bread crust, and even a hint of black licorice and vanilla. A big bitter toassted malt feel coats the entire mouth on first sip. Dark burnt blackness really drives the palate of this brew. A bit of a nutty feel develops twords the end along with a bit of warm Belgium waffles dripped in molases. This Impy really does lack sweetness that would balance it out and score even better with me. It drinks best quite warm. Alchol is well hidden but warms the belly well.

Roasted malts. Roasted coffee bean. Oatmeal.  T: Big flavors of dark bitter chocolate and deep roasted coffee are followed by a soft hop presence. Roasted caramel malts give off a pleasant astrigent bite. The sweetness of oats with a warming alcohol sensation.  M: Slick and slightly thin for an RIS. Minimal carbination. Dry and warming.

2681,34483,Gavage,4.23,"Appearance: pours a black color with a long lasting and creamy 3"" tan colored head.  Smell: roasted malt aromas are big and easy to pull out of the glass.  Taste: big roasted malts, prunes, raisins, molasses, and a nice bitterness makes a great RIS. The toasted tones linger throughout the swallow. Alcohol provides some mild warming.  Mouthfeel: smooth at the start with it becoming almost syrupy and dry at the finish. Heavy in body. Super long aftertaste as the flavors glue themselves to your tongue.  Drinkability: a totally satisfying RIS. Having this style available in a can is great. Easy to drink and enjoyable despite the high cost for it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MiguelMandingo,4.35,"This is a really great beer. I am really happy that OB is finally coming to Texas.  Poured a 12oz. can into a snifter.  Appearance - This beer is BLACK - one of the deepest colored RISs I have ever sampled. It looks like this could stain the glass I have it in. It produced a deep brown 1/2 finger head and left behind a minimal amount of lacing.  Smell - Roasty with a huge cocoa component with a sweet hue. Very powdery and dusty smelling, like actual cocoa powder. There is a distant cherry scent in there as well. The smell isn't overly complex, it is very one sided - though it is a very enticing scent.  Taste - Heavy chocolate, but it sort of runs the chocolate gambit. There is a heavy dark chocolate edge, with a bitter cocoa powder tinge that is closely tied to the hops. It is pretty roasty, but also contains a hint of cherry. The hop profile rounds it all out with a nice bitter finish. The ABV is extremely well hidden for it being 10%. This is very tasty.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, but fairly thin for the style - though this is not to its disadvantage. It definitely has enough carbonation to keep it interesting. It is pretty slick and oily textured, and this makes for a really easy drinking RIS.  Drinkability - This is a really well crafted beer. I have found that some RISs need some time to develop, and need to be cellared for a while, but this is excellent as it is. It is easy drinking, and certainly not overpowering. Since it comes in a aluminum can and is able travel to where glass bottles sometimes can't, and its ABV is so well hidden, I can see how this could easily be a very dangerous beer - in a good way.  Perhaps the best beer I have ever had out of a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Derek,4.33,"A: Black with a dark tan head, very little retention (not surprising for its strength), leaves a nice leg on the glass.  S: Dark molasses, booze, dark bread and a light fruitiness.  T: Dark molasses, rye bread, booze, coffee, dark chocolate, plenty of hop bitterness, light roasted acidity (undoubtedly smoothed by some oats).  M: Thick with a dry alcohol finish.  D: Remarkably drinkable for something this big & bitter.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,thickerfreakness,4.28,"Ordered from Liquor Max in Co. Thanks Nick.  I definitely wowed some friends pouring this amazing beer from a can. Pours motor oil black with a thick, mocha colored head. Smells of dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. Taste is very similar with a majority coming from the chocolate and roasted malt taste and then a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is very thick and expected of an RIS. The alcohol is hidden very well in the smell and taste for a 10%ABV beer thus it is pretty drinkable but I can't see having more than a couple in a session.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,RedHaze,4.05,"Thanks to bditty187 and smellysell for this beer.  Pours an inky black, with a dense one finger head that fades very slowly to a thick cap. The foam leaves behind a solid sheet on the glass.  Smell; a little charred malts, coffee, black licorice and molasses all swirling together in the nose. Chocolate along with some piney hops as present as well. The warmer this thing gets the more pronounced the aromas become.  Taste; dense chocolate and molasses give this a very rich flavor initailly. Some coffee, a touch of licorice and a bit of char fill out the middle, while piney/citric hops and a hint of alcohol finish it off. As a matter of fact, I'm surprised there's not more of an alochol presence here with 10% ABV.  Mouthfeel is massive yet smooth, and the drinkability is pretty good consider the high alcohol and the huge flavors.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

M-heavy slightly carbonated D-A great representation of an imperial stout. Of course everyone knows its from a can, but I don't really care. I love Gordons and Dales, and this one is no exception.

Black as night. Absolutely no light comes through...the brewery couldn't have said it better...""this dog'll hunt""  Aroma: Not too bad, some chocolate and coffie, nothing exceptional though.  Taste: Very nice. Starts out roasted and cocoa, chocolate....coffee...everything roasty and malty. Stouty goodness! But wait, leave this sit in the glass for a while, and suddenly you get a delicious, sweet, candy-like finish. DELICIOUS!  Mouthfeel: Is it possible to chew a beer? This one is close. Nice-thick/syrupy body, slides down the throat wayyyy to easy.  Drinkability: This beer is very drinkeable. RIS are generally not that drinkable by nature (1-max), but this one is very...very smooth.

2681,34483,beerking1,2.96,"I REALLY want to like this beer more. The look is AWESOME, with a dark brown head, about 1/2 inch high, leaving a cap and lace all the way down. Darkest head I have ever seen on any beer. Pours thicker than any beer I have ever had before, much like a 30W oil, AFTER months in the engine. Aroma is great, EXTREMELY roasty, with burnt notes. There is some notes of higher alcohols in the nose, but they blend well with the roast. Flavor is where this beer falls apart. HUGE notes of fusel alcohols, and I am expecting a big headache from this. The higher alcohols form a hot, astringent character on the tongue, very slightly overwhelming. The roastiness and malt is great, but the fusels are too much. I recommend sharing this, as 12 oz seems way too much.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BigJTrucker,4.45,"Thanks to BA ""Turbine2475"" for this delicious brew.  Poured a thick dark black color, with a creamy deep brown head that settled very quickly. Smell is a combination of roasted smell of chocolate, malt, some woodsy aroma as well. Taste is a bit stronger of roasted coffee, cocoa, vanilla, tobacco, even a faint ""peat"" flavor. Mouthfeel is very thick and smooth all at the same time. A very good, flavorful HIGHLY drinkable RIS. Fans of the style won't be disappointed.

2681,34483,Kegatron,4.23,"12 oz can into a snifter.  Pours a motor oil black (which is what it looks like coming out of a can) with a 1/2 finger of burnt tan colored creamy head. It retains nicely into a thin layer that lies across the surface and leaves some pretty impressive lace behind but it unfortuantley doesn't stick around long, opting to leave a slick, brown coating down the sides of the glass. The aroma is burnt oats right off the bat, along with zippy coffee notes, a rich chocolate stickiness, and a fairly prominant presence of dark fruit tartness that shines through.  The taste is a dark roasted mix of malt and coffee bitterness to start things off with a generally overall feel of oats to it. That's balanced out by a big chocolate sweetness and hints of dark fruits. The finish is bitter, hot and sticky. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a wonderful creamy and sometimes slick texture to it. As full as the flavors are though, it seems like the body could go even a little deeper. A beefy heat is present but doesn't become stinging, more like adding some extra toughness to the overall feel.  A solid RIS from Oskar Blues and a decent deal at around $3 a can for what you get. It's not quite up there with some other top ones in the style but the uniqueness of a RIS out of a can has to earn it some brownie points too right?",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

It pours with a big, frothy, super dark, mocha colored head that has good retention and great lace.  s: Heavily roasted malt aromas that border on charred. Mild alcohol notes as well, along with some very faint cherries.  t: This is certainly big and satisfying, but it lacks subtlety and complexity. Huge, roasted to within an inch of becoming ash, malt flavors absolutely dominate up front. Some creamy chocolate flavors come next. The finish is a burned bitter malt that includes some alcoholic heat and lingers for quite a while.  m: This is very thick and hearty, like hot chocolate made with whole milk. It is superbly carbonated.  d: Ten Fidy is to impy stout fans what an absolute hop-bomb is to a hop-head. Big, delicious and flavorful, but a bit one-dimensional.

I have no idea about the carbonation. Smells of deep roasted chocolate, dark candied fruit (raisins, figs), and a little alcohol is noticable. Big oily mouthfeel. An impressive bitterness actually shines through. Dark candied fruit is buried by the roasted malts and high AA hops. Nice and burned, almost smokey. Aftertaste is burned and the bitterness really starts to grows. Booziness also in the aftertaste. A huge, superb beer that live up to its hype.

2681,34483,currysage1,4.28,"Darkest beer to ever be poured from a can.  Little head, quickly dissipates to just whisps on the surface, has a good viscosity just like a wine.  Smell is of french roast coffee, oily and strong, with dark fruits and a slight alcohol.  Taste is of bakers chocolate, strong coffee, raisins and figs, some alcohol towards the end.  Mouthfeel was slick with not so much in the carbonation front. Very to the style, full bodied in every way.  Drinkability is high because while it is somewhat bitter, the alcohol is hardly noticeable, which is odd for a 10%.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BeerSox,5,"12oz can into 8oz snifter.  Deep dark opaque black. As it poured out of the can it reminded me of dirty oil coming out of the bottom of the oil pan on an engine (this tastes better though, trust me). The pour is restricted because of the shape of the mouth of the can, which created a smooth steady pour that created a quarter inch chocolate brown head that slowly transforms into a thin rim. Spotty and stringy lacing is left along the glass.  Thick and heavy bitter malts set up the base which leads way to a spicy hop aroma (which is barely detected behind the malts). Along with the two anchor aromas is a light smokiness which pairs well with sweet molassees. Some dry alcohol comes in as the beer warms.  The bitterness of the malts rivals a strong black coffee (and there is some of that flavor in there as well) along with a citrusy hop flavor hiding in the background. Mild chocolate comes into the middle to balance the overall bitterness. Some mild dried fruit finds its way in there. Full bodied with a good amount of carbonation. The feel is thick and sticks in the mouth after each sip. The alcohol is buried under the bold flavors, but sneaks out a little as the beer warms. The finish is the everlasting roasty malts, along with a little bit of hops.  This is a very robust RIS that probably tops them all in terms of bitterness and mouthfeel. The can seems to be a perfect fit for this one. The glass just seems to ""designer"", too classy, too delicate for this beer. It was a bit of a search for this one, but I feel it was worth it. It dumps the malts on you with still allowing for the hops to join in. After all that, there is still room for dry fruit and chocolate to add to the complexity. After reviewing 522 beers, some better than others, this one finally wins a perfect score from me. If you ever run into the brewers at the Oksar Blues grill, tell them Chris said, ""Thanks.""",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A: The beer is a deep black color, short head that almost the same color as the beer itself, it fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of dark chocolate, roasted malts and black coffee.  T: The taste has very strong malty flavors of dark chocolate and roasted coffee. The dark chocolate flavor brings a bitter bite as well. There's a very mild hops presence as you would expect from a big stout. The after-taste is bitter-sweet.  M: Crisp and smooth, heavy body, medium carbonation, sticky finish.  D: Tasty, goes down easy, pretty filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a good stout to drink for a while until you get too full, but I think it's very over-hyped.

Smell is super malty, and very good. Lots going on, wood, dark fruits, anise, and a fair amount of smoke. Nicely complex and very well-blended.  Taste is much like the smell, very malty, but with a surprising bitter kick. Not as complex as the smell, and a little boozy on the finish.  Mouthfeel is good, maybe a little thin, but the carbonation is spot-on.  Drinkability is decent, the malt flavors are very strong and the bitterness adds up.  Overall, good, but not as good as I hoped. Still, it's the best beer-from-a-can I've ever had.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,woemad,4.25,"12oz can from a 4-pk purchased for $12.99 at Enoteca in Post Falls, Idaho. Why I can't find this in a city of nearly 200,000, but can drive 20 miles east and pick it up in a somewhat small town in northern Idaho cannot be explained.  Poured a viscous black, with a tight tan head that hung around for several minutes. Lots of lace initially, but that's receeded to spottiness.  The nose was chocolaty, with roasted malts, hops and booze cutting through.  The taste starts out chocolaty but with bitter hops forming a flavor undercurrent. Not as fruity as other RIS's I've known, though there's a slightly pruny taste in the background, along with a warming alcohol sensation.  Full bodied, with a coating, stick-to-yer-ribs texture to the mouthfeel.  A tasty addition to the ranks of those beers of the style I've managed to drink. This would make an excellent nightcap. Still, after sampling it, I think I prefer the Abyss. This is certainly no slouch, however, and I'm glad I've got three more for later consumption.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BuckeyeNation,4.68,"Oily anthracite with no highlights whatsoever (not even with blindingly bright sunlight behind the glass). The fudge milkshake-colored crown looks more dense than a fudge milkshake and looks fantastic as it slooowly melts. A serrated band of thick lace is just beginning to appear. No hesitation here. This is a picture-perfect RIS.  The snifter is undoubtedly helping, but the aroma is both powerful and pungent. I'm sure that massive amounts of chocolate and roasted malt are the reason why. Rich chocolate fudge actually describes the nose pretty well. Roasted coffee bean and spruce-like hops are noted as well. Given the stated 98 IBUs, the hoppiness isn't a bit surprising.  Although it's still a little cool, the flavor doesn't have the intensity that was expected after the eyeball and nose tests. It's good, it just isn't extraspecialsuperduperamazinglyfantastic good. I spoke a few minutes too soon. A few more degrees make all the difference in what is now a muffled explosion of flavor that oozes into every nook and cranny of my tongue.  Bittersweet chocolate leads the way. A stout with this much malt (let's call it gargantuan) needs a considerable amount of hops (let's call it withering) to maintain some degree of balance and to stay on the drinkable side of cloying. Mission accomplished. This isn't the hoppiest RIS that I've ever had, but it's in the top-5.  Other than Hershey kisses, the flavor profile contains the same roasted coffee beans and pine sap that was noted in the nose. Let's throw in anise, blackstrap molasses and several pounds of white grapefruit zest as well. For hopheads who like massive stouts almost as much as DIPAs (like me) this stuff is manna from heaven.  Like appearance, mouthfeel is a no-brainer. The first ounce told me all I needed to know. It's huger than huge, smoother than smooth and plusher than plush. How in the world did the brewers manage to pack so much malt into such a small can? There are just enough bubbles floating around to keep the beer from feeling flat. Again... perfection.  Now, a word about the beer's name. My first thought was that Ten FIDY was a slang way of saying 'ten fifty', whatever that's supposed to mean. The fact that FIDY is capitalized made me dig deeper. I now believe that it's a recognized acronym meaning (F)*** the (I)ndusty, (D)o it (Y)ourself. Tell me I'm wrong, Oskar Blues. Thanks to SkinnyElvis for the best toss-in ever.  I used to think that Oscar Blues brewed the best canned beer in the universe... until Surly Furious, Bender and CynicAle came along. Ten FIDY, however, can stand toe-to-toe with some of the best RISs out there. Since Surly Darkness will most likely never see the inside of a can, this brew seems destined to be the finest canned Russian Imperial stout the planet Earth has ever known.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Somewhat ringed and dimpled lacing with above average strength.  Dark chocolate aroma; rich, roasted malts with hints of oatmeal. Intense, fresh espresso with a rather nutty profile. Mild whaffs of peat along-side a slight sherry-like alcohol presence.  Rich, roasted malts with an immediate, rough floral hop bite. Smokey peat lingers from the initial sip. Dark chocolate, roasted hazlenut, very floral hops all cut by a slick, hefty alcohol flavor. Very robust flavors, yet balanced with one another.  Full in body; intensely slick but also very chewy.

I'm used to slamming PBR and never seeing what comes out of the mouth so seeing this thick sludge flowing was an odd experience. Poured the black liquid vigorously into a Duvel Tulip (thick enough that it didn't splash at all!) creating a deep brown thick, creamy head. Black body that light has no chance getting through. Awesome aromas of chocolate, coffee and tobacco. Flavor is wonderful! I had no idea this was almost 100 IBU because there was SO much malt. Incredible!

A fruitiness lingers throughout. The body is full and creamy with subtle carbonation; fantastically smooth. This is a great imperial stout. The draw is only greater due to the can. The high amounts of roast and possibly hops impart a significant amount of bitterness to this beer, if it were a bit sweeter, it might be more drinkable, but regardless I would love to have this one again, and will certainly pick it up again in the future.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Nesued,3.95,"Sampled at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur, Georgia. Have been looking for this beer for a while and finally came upon this on a recent visit to Atlanta.  Appearance - Black as midnight at the bottom of a coal mine. Little to no head forming upon the initial pour from the traditional Oskar can. Unable to determine the impact of carbonation, but I can estimate it to be slight. The head that is present is a dark tan in coloring.  Smell - Strong roasted grain and coffee nose. Breath deeply and you will enjoy. I was suprised by a bit of a grapefruit nose as contributed by the (I'm sure) single hop bloom they added (just kidding..). The nose expands a bit as the beer warmed in my hands. I did want to delay drinking this until it warmed from the refrigerator temp  Taste - Dense is the best way I can describe this beer. I was expecting a very mellow finish but was suprised by a bite at the end that otherwise marred an outstanding experience.  Mouthfeel - Did I mention dense? Was able to finally feel the impact the carbonation had on this beer. A coffee-flavor-related bite announced it's presence and provided a basis upon which to build upon.  Drinkability - I enjoy RIS offerings. If left on an island with only one style of beer, it would be an RIS. In my opinion, this is a good Russian Imperial Stout. I very much wanted to try it due to the reviews present on this site, and was glad I did. In my heart of hearts, I was expecting more. I purchased two four-packs to further review at a later time. I've heard it ages well.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Jmamay22,3.63,"Pours black as can be. Thick rich motor oil looking beer with very little carbonation. The thin brown sugar colored head quickly disappears leaving only a slight collar. A very imposing looking brew.  Smells of bitter chocolate foremost. In the background lurks a slight roasted quality and alcohol. There is a slight astringent essence that seems to come and go. Not as deep and complex of a nose as some, but tempting nonetheless.  Taste is less complex and quite honestly disappointing given the hype behind the beer. Comes off overly roasted and acidic for my tastes. The sweetness of the beer is not cloying, but lacks any depth of flavor. I expected some chocolate, coffee, or dark fruit characteristics, but found them to be limited.  Mouthfeel is syrupy and lacks, in my opinion, the proper level of carbonation. This is coming from someone who prefers lower levels of carbonation for the style. Overall this beer is not bad and certainly above average, but not one of my top Russian Imperial Stouts. Overpriced for my tastes.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,breity,4.11,"You know it's going to be an interesting experience when your first instinct is that you've been tricked into pouring motor oil into a cup. No fizz at all when pouring out of the can, though a slim chocolaty head develops once it's in the glass, which then dissipates quickly. The smell is very enticing.  The beer itself coats your mouth (and the glass), complementing the taste which is a cross between espresso and hops. The taste was constant even when the beer warmed up. I quite frankly had to sip this beer -- it was overwhelming to drink any more than that and I'd waste the mouthful by swallowing it in a hurry. In fact, I had to have a glass of water with me to help out at times.  I would never be able to drink more than one in a sitting, and my palette would be (as it is now) destroyed afterwards, but I truly respect what Oskar Blues accomplished and can appreciate it. This is a once-in-a-while brew, and it would be a dynamite choice for those occasions.

2681,34483,BittRnessabounds,3.91,"It's fair to say this is the darkest beer I've ever poured out of a can.  The pop-top crack is not followed by the usual canned beer fizz. Instead slowly rising from the depths of the can a very fine layer of deep brown bubbles emerge. Of course once poured into a glass these bubbles transform into a beautiful fine layer of head that retains quite well floating atop a pitch black base.  The sweet aroma produced from this glass is a mix of malt and alcohol. The taste and mouthfeel are difficult to parse as Ten Fidy thoroughly coats your mouth and the malty sweetness is balanced by dry dark malts and a touch of bitterness. One sip leaves an almost syrupy coat over your tongue. If you open your mouth you will be greeted by a hint of alcohol as you inhale.  All in all this is a very tasty Stout and well worth trying should you cross paths with one. While there are hints to the potent nature of the alcohol in this brew, while drinking one it's hard to believe it is 10%..until you've managed to have a few.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Also notable were coffee and oats - all balanced by a noticable hop bitterness. Excellent.  M: Medium+ body with very low carbonation. Super smooth. Coats the mouth, resulting in a lasting aftertaste with a slight warming.  D: Well hidden alcohol (well, for 10% abv) with loads of flavor. As balanced as an RIS can be, and very drinkable. You'll have to slow yourself to keep from having your $14 four-pack disappear too quickly.  Oh - one more thing: if you live in a state where this is unavailable, happen to fall ass-backwards into a 4-pack, then share it with friends, you may regret it later.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,IBUnit63,4.13,"Deep, dark, Texas Tea espresso/Jolt cola-color with thick, compact dark maple walnut/praline head and great lacing.  Heavy alcoholic tinge with tinny tones of earth, slate, grassy hops and double-roasted coffee and malt - a little unbalanced; not quite beautiful chemistry but blown away nonetheless  Wow. Burnt espresso, heavy ring of bitterness from coffee and hops. Mild sweetness - abundance of everything and way over the top.  Finishes very thick with nice, harsh coffee tingle.  This one's for quality, not quantity. Sip, savor and enjoy in moderation.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,jwc215,4.31,"Had on-tap at the Gingerman in Manhatten:  Pours pitch-black with a thick light brown, creamy head. Awesome retention, esp. for abv level.  The smell is of dark roasted maltiness - chocolate and coffee. A bit milder than expected, but nice.  The taste is almost explosive. Chocolate and deep roasted coffee with a hint of citric/piney hop support. Beautiful balance of sweet, bitter and roast. Warming alcohol is present, but fairly soft on the palate and non-interfering. It has a very long, roasty finish.  Just about hits full-bodied, it is rich and creamy without being too sticky or syrupy.  Good drinkability for such a high abv. Very rich and tasty - a work of brewing art!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,gford217,4.38,"A: Wow is this stuff dark. Pours pitch black with a thick 1-finger tan head that quickly dissipates with a little lacing. Damn fine looking beer.  S: Strong roasty aroma of primarily chocolate with coffee to compliment. A hint of hops and alcohol starts to emerge as it warms up.  T: Quite a bit going on in this one. Chocolate and coffee dominate the initial taste, but a couple more sips bring out some caramel and molasses. Taste seems to evolve as the beer warms a bit. Quite nice actually.  M: Thick and syrupy. Completely coats the mouth and sticks around a while. A little bit of a dry roasted finish which is surprising given the thick, syrupy nature of the beer. The bitterness lingers a bit along with the chocolate. Top notch.  D: Very drinkable and well balanced for a big stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,joepais,4.12,"Thanks to Jw347 for this one. Can poured into a sniffer glass produced a fingers worth of coco colored head On top of a thick black body .The head goes to a nice layer of lace  Aromas' of chocolate, grains (cereal), coffee and smoke fill your nose  Taste is somewhat typical stout you get the roasted malts, chocolate, coffee thing going on but the hop presence is a bit more robust than the ordinary  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy and goes down smooth  A good RIS the hoppiest I've ever had. Drinkable as a RIS can get, you better be sipping this at 10%.Not the best I've had but not the worst either .I would recommend it.

2681,34483,CualityC,4.58,"A review by two roommates, one a beer salesman, the other a layman.  Appearance Beer salesman: The brew poured opaque, menacing, no light could pierce this darkness, an ominous first impresssion. Layman: That sh*t was dark.  Smell: Beer Salesman: Pure roasted goodness, a fine monte-cristo rolled with world's best coffee. Layman: Smelled of beer... expensive beer? I don't know.  Taste: Beer Salesman: Wow, can a beer this big also be this balanced? Apparently. Huge malt nose up front lends way to a drenched slightly bitter finish. This is like 2 parts Stone Russian Imperial Stout, one part Guinness. Layman: It's like this beer ice cream I had once... but that was bad, and frozen. This was good.  Mouthfeel: Beer Salesman: Viscous, full bodied, coats the entire mouth and takes its sweet time getting out. Layman: ::BUURRP!!::  Drinkability: Beer Salesman: 10% ABV? Guess I shouldn't have the third one... Honestly, I didn't notice. Sure I can't ""pound"" these, but name a Russian Imperial Stout that is appropriate for chugging. Layman: Yeah, I can drink it!

2681,34483,Ave,4.63,"Ten Fidy 12 oz can  With no carbonation fizz on opening, a dark blood amber pour stream falls into a pool of blackest of black stout. Thin set mocha colored head of tiny bubbles settles in. An unpronounced, delicate yet very pleasing aroma of espresso, toffee, beef and smoky chocolate. Head dissipated to a frothy ring, lovely. Mouthfeel is luscious and full, soft and bitter in the back that lingers over more espresso and smoke. Alcohol is noticeable but surprisingly balanced with full uber dark malt flavor. It's a sipper of pleasure for sure, one to be lingered over. A wonderfully massive stout, that over powers you with hug.  Thank you Oskar Blues!

Smelled of strong black malt and spicy hops. Strong espresso and toffee sweetness smell and taste. Great hops presence that was really interesting and fun to drink. Nice medium mouthfeel. Not too coating, but let's you know you just took a sip.  Overall a very enjoyable beer and very drinkable.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,DrDogbeer,3.93,"Extremely excited to finally try this one out! Pourd from a can into a shaker pint. Pours out like good maple syrup, slow and steady. Produces a wonderful looking creamy tan/brown head that looks like you could float a quarter on. Smells of burnt malts, smoke and some vanilla light at the end. Taste is sharp for a syruppy beer. Nice chocolate and molasses flavor with a bite. Not my favorite style, but this one can grow on me. Beer mellows a bit as it warms- I think it took my 45 minutes to down this one.

S:The reason I found this exceptional is I picked up a smokey vanilla coffee bean. That vanilla really popped for me, which I love. Light sweet milk chocolate as well. T:Thick rich chocolate cake. That vanilla smell is ever so light in the taste, but it is there. The chocolate gives way on the back pallat to a bright hoppiness. M:Like thick rich melted choclate.

Pours a thick oil black without the soy sauce mouthfeel. Jumps to a finger to a finger and 1/2 chocolate beautiful head...Hmm all I can say is I want this to be a staple in my fridge for sure!

I haven't had beer from a can and was sort of skeptical. Pours a deep dark brown, with a long-lasting brown head. I had it in my recently acquired tulip. There was a quarter-inch of head and loads of lacing when I finished the glass. This smells awesome, burnt malt, caramal and slight chocolate...just a hint of alcohol. Taste matches the look and scent. Lots of caramel flavor, it's like a burnt toffee. There is a nice hop presence, but not so much that it starts seeming like some sort of weird US interpretation of a hop stout monster. Balanced, is key. This is creamy and smooth. Should probably sip this in moderation, but seriously, it's hard not to just slurp it down. I could easily drink a few of these.  It's so wonderful I want everyone to try it, and yet, so wonderful I'm not sure I can bring myself to share these other 2 cans.

S- Strong smell of coffee and chocolate, very inviting.  T- Very powerful taste of thick coffee, chocolate, and licorice. Hops are muted, but balance the flavor nicely.  M- Very thick on the tongue, almost oily. Velvety smooth, the alcohol is muted, but cannot be missed.  D- At 10% alcohol I wouldn't drink many, but the sweet, thickness of this beer would fill me before I had too awful many.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Wonka,4.12,"can 12 FL.OZ no dates  To cap off my stout's transfer to keg, I grabbed a recently purchased can from the 4-pack. The can was popped with minimal feedback.  Appearance - body is as black as black gets; tan head starts a bit short of an inch and didn't have much of a life; lace is below average; the oiliness can be witnessed as it is retained on the glass  Smell - dark malts with chocolate pulling through; molasses; vanilla; bit of alcohol laced throughout  Taste - roasted malts enter strong and hold until mid/late; pleasant balance for a big stout at the close; bitterness pushes out the sweetness for the aftertaste  Mouthfeel - carbonation tries to fight through the oily base and both sides are rather satisfying; bit of a hop/alc zing; close is oily; carbonation really flattened out late  Drinkability - I wish the carbonation was handled differently. It could have a bit more push. The flavor profile pulled through.  I love the big stouts. Oskar Blues Ten Fidy has a road to run to catch the best but its good nonetheless.  3/23 - I'm still disappointed by the carbonation, but this sample turned away my doubts about delivering a 4.5 for taste. With a stronger pour, the head was of course bigger and it held a bit longer but it was gone after a third of the beer left the glass. Lacing however improved markedly. It could have been victim of a less-than-perfectly-clean glass. Appearance could be bumped up to a 4.0.

2681,34483,sleazo,3.83,"A_Wow I got sprayed in the face by this one like an Aurora Snow video. This just exploded out of the can. The pour was a glug glug of thick viscous liquid which resulted in a dark black hue. Nice sized head and very sticky lace.  S_Clean smelling, rich roasted malt aroma mixes with a slight coffee aroma.  T-Not as overwhelming as I expected. Nice very bitter roasted malts mingle with a slightly sweet taste. Good coffee flavours here alonwith a bit of an alcohol kick on the end.  M_Mostly syrupy with a middle of the road carbonation. This pushes the liquid around the mouth.  D_This is a very tasty stout. The alcohol makes its presence known but doesnt detract too much from the overall appeal.

2681,34483,deltatauhobbit,4.11,"Thanks to RustyDiamond for the chance to try this. What a strange brew to be coming out of a can.  Whoa, this pours jet black with no light being able to penetrate, large foamy tan head that leaves a great deal of lacing, a bit viscous too.  Smell is mostly roasted malt with a dark fruit presence as well, bit reserved in the aroma though.  Taste is of roasted malt, good coffee-like bitterness with some associated ""burnt"" notes, very very creamy which makes it go down so easily, I couldn't tell that this was 10% until after when my stomach started to warm up, I ended up enjoying the can a little too fast because of the smoothness.  Overall, felt it was a bit hyped up though, as the taste was not as assertive as it could have been and didn't really go beyond some of the other RIS I've had, but the can doesn't lie, ""Half-Baked. Fully Roasted"".",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,FreeEagle,4.57,"When this came in the delivery drivers put the Beer Advocate rating and information on the shelf with it. Very helpful, otherwise I would of never bought this beer.

2681,34483,asabreed,4.43,"Can poured into a pint glass. Who replaced the beer with honey?  Appearance: Opaque body of course, but a nicely billowing and ridiculously indefatigable head that sticks all over the place in rings and circles and smears of lacing on the glass.  Smell: Visceral all the way, with charred, roasted, burned, conflagration-like characteristics all the way through in the nose. Bitter coffee comes through as it warms, along with some bitter chocolate. A bit of sweetness and dark berries is evident, but this beer doesn't want to be coy about its intensity.  Taste: Roasted, burned, and charred everything, from wood, to charcoal, to tar. This is probably the most unapologetically visceral brew I've ever had the pleasure to taste. As it warms, mocha sweetness and bitter coffee come through, along with the assumed dark berry sweetness, with some oats, some scotch, and finishing semi-dry with a bit of citrus, balanced extremely well, and lingering for a hell of a long time.  Mouthfeel: Pure silk on all accounts. There are milkshakes that can't produce a smoothness like this.  Drinkability: An RIS to seek out, though don't if you can't handle it, because this thing's insane. This is the Arrogant Bastard of RIS, and I'm surprised they don't have a lengthy sermon on the can or website, because it deserves one. I picked up a 4-pack, and I have 2 cans left. I can't see the brew holding up for a while in the can, so those will probably see the light of day soon.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,brewandbbq,4.32,"Pours opaque black with a half-inch head of tan. Enough foam to leave some rings and strings of lacework. The nose is chock full of RIS goodness. Fudgy chocolate, espresso, cocoa nubs, and black forest cake batter. A mild resinous hop note is also present. The mouthfeel is big, chewy, and thick. Creamy and drying. Dark chocolate, kona roast, charred malt, and fudge batter fill the bill on the pallet nicely. A slightly green hop note is underlying and barely beats the warming alcohol as it finishes. The alcohol builds a bit, and stops short of being hot. Faintly numbing on the back of the tongue and throat though.  This must be the ""year of the big, bad stout"", as this monster will help testify. My only gripe is the lame can. A beer as good as this should be in a wax-sealed 750, ready for a ten-year nap on it's side.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Absolutely opaque, black body with a huge soapy tan head and excellent retention. Lacing was extraordinary. The aroma was excellent as well, with coffee and chocolate leading the way but dark fruits and toffee in there as well. Very comlpex. The taste was much of the same; coffee and espresso, chocolate and caramel malts. Very good. The mouthfeel was a little on the bitter side for my tastes; the coffee acidity came out, as did the feel/taste of alcohol (no surprise since its 10%). The bitterness seemed to be at odds with the sweet and ultimately overtook that feling. Very full bodied and almost chewy. This is a meal. Overall this was a fantastic beer and worth the hype.

2681,34483,Phillyduke,4.63,"Thanks to BA'ers smellysell & session1979 for hooking me up with a few cans of the Original Release of this beer.  Appearance: Can opened with barely a pop of C02. Poured briskly into a Riedel stemless wineglass. Beer is as black as onyx and as viscous as motor oil. A beautiful 2 to 3 finger head of dense, pillowy tan foam that resembles hot cocoa slowly recedes to a thick top layer, leaving a trail of lacing down the side of the glass. Excellent retention.  Smell: At first the nose is hard to discern. Hints of burnt malt give way to cocoa, coffee, and a strong alcohol scent as the beer approaches room temperature.  Taste: What a world of flavors! The ABV here is well-masked by the strong flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee, complimented by hints of caramel. A pleasing bitterness that goes perfectly with the other flavors rewards each sip. Outstanding.  Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy and syrupy. Coats the mouth with velvety smoothness and leaves a sticky residue behind. Nary a hint of carbonation. Warming alcohol sensation greets the stomach.  Drinkability/Overall Impression: Wow. This is quite a concoction. The ABV here will definitely catch up with you before long, so I don't know how many of these you could have in one sitting before becoming completely incapacitated. It's definitely a sipper, but quite exceptional for the style. Perfect for a cold winter night, or when you need to feel warm all over. The beer definitely has a ""sweet spot"", however, as the last few sips of warmest beer couldn't stand up to the earlier, cooler draws. Definitely a keeper!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Was impressesd with how well this beer coated. Each Successive sip left a thick coating that left a darkened yellow hue down the glass. S - Dark chocolates and Roasted coffee with a light hint of dark sugars like prunes and maple that had been in a reduction. T - Lots of coffee and chocolate with the roasted nature being the predominate theme and the fruity sweet that I detected earlier gave way to the presence of light hops. M - Creamy and deep with a good balance of carbonation that has a thick coating. D - Execelent beer that I would love to have access to here in Texas but sadly is not so.

2681,34483,joezak5,3.87,"Purchased as a 4 pack at Joe Canals in Lawrenceville, NJ for $10.99. I do have to believe that $10.50 would have been the more appropriate price.  Appearance: Minus for the can. The lady ringing me up took one look at the $11.76 price and said that it couldn't be right. The wide mouth can opened to a weak sound and splashed a few drops on the counter. One in the Duvel sniffter is was a beautiful pitch black with thick cocoa head.  Smell: Very rich roasted malt with a slight spicy background.  Mouthfeel: Suprisingly inviscid and uncarbonated. The warmth of the alcohol starts to slide in with a very smooth swish.  Taste: Fairly straightforward roasted malt but without the bite at the end. The alcohol is very well hidden. The hops kick in on the swallow and the finishing exhale is a very mild roast.

The head is brown and thin like the top of hardcore espresso (when you can see the caffeine!). It smells heavenly, like rich, roasted coffee, dark malts and even a bit like burnt toast and teriyaki. It's a great fresh smell that I'm thinking is preserved extremely well by it being canned.  Ten Fidy goes down smooth. Way smoother than I was thinking it would. The rich malty taste is complex and the high alcohol content is extremely well hidden.

2681,34483,Lupe,4.16,"Pours a sinister looking thick black liquid from the can - looks thick and syrupy during the pour. Liquid is capped by a thick and frothy brown head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves lots of sticky lace.  Roasty aroma of dark roast coffee and chocolate. Faint hint of dark fruit and alcohol. Fairly straight-forward scents.  Flavor is similar to the aroma - big roasted character of dark roast coffee, chocolate, and some dark fruit. A little molasses and caramel are present as well. The roasted bitterness helps to balance the sweet malty flavors. Finishes with linger roast and a touch of alcohol (rum-raisin).  Wonderful mouthfeel. Full bodied, thick, smooth, and a little chewy. Not cloying or sticky, which was a little surprising. Perfect carbonation, which I am growing to expect from Oskar Blues.  Good drinkability, but defiantly a big sipper that's more of a nightcap. Lacking somewhat in complexity, but has great straight-forward flavors. Very nice.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

No light was making it through the stream pouring out of the can. Wow. The aroma is ashy burnt roasted maltwith some sweet molasses notes and just a hint of chocolate. This one smells promising. The first sip brings a strong burnt malt backbone that moves to a light molasses sweetness, followed by a solid pine hop that brings notes of coffee to the party as it mingles with the burnt notes. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on my tongue well after swallowing the beer. I'm pretty impressed with this one. It pulls all the flavors together; I had it on draft and was not at all impressed, so this is a pleasant surprise. Mouthfeel is very thick, with just a hint of carbonation. This certainly fits the brew. Overall, this brew delivers. I think the deepness of the burnt malt really works well with the hop profile of the brew to bring new flavors from the marriage that would not otherwise develop.

2681,34483,Brad007,5,"Thanks to RutgersBeerGuy for this one.  Color: The color of motor oil. Pitch black beyond all return. Very thin head that's brown in color.  Aroma: Strong chocolate aroma with creaminess. Roasty. A decent whiff of coffee. Rich. Malty.  (best to let this bad boy warm up and then detect aroma)  Taste: Smooth and creamy upfront. Rich. Lots and lots of roastiness in the middle. The hops show through well. Chocolate and dark fruits galore. A second sip just confirms this one. The roastiness is what makes this such a great example of an imperial stout. The alcohol is well-hidden as well.  Mouthfeel: Dry and roasty. Creamy. Smooth.  Verdict: A beautiful, marvelous example of a RIS...but in a can! Who thought that such malty, roasty goodness could come from a can? I'm in love with this beer. I must have more. Apparently, I'm not alone either. Honestly, I just have to give this beer high props because  1. I've never had such a good beer out of a can 2. Russian Imperial Stouts are my favorite style and honestly, I don't see that many where I'm from. I always have to import the best stuff by trade or by travel. 3. It's such a brilliant idea.

2681,34483,DarkerTheBetter,4.01,"This looked amazing coming out of the can. The black against AL was impressive. Once in my Darkness tulip, dark patches of black settled between bubbles. This then fell to an impenetrable blackness with an inch of cocoa creamy foam. Looked a lot like milk froth even. Very nice.  Smells of dry dark fruits that intermingle with a sappy green wood. This sadly rounds out into a touch of cough syrup and a hint of celery. Beneath it all there's a dark chocolate backed by a boozy sting. There are some less than desirable aromas here, but the overall blend is quite nice.  Tastes very subdued at first with only pricks of dryness on the edges of my tongue and a faint cherry sweetness but then blossoms with a toasty coffee and dark chocolate. That green sappy wood is back too. This just sorta stops here and the sting on my tongue just gets amplified in the finish lingering along with some burnt coffee and smokey wood. Not bad at all, but rather monochromatic.  Feels really slick and quite small. The carbonation is present but seems to be hiding.  A nice take on the style, but far from my favorite. That being said, if you're an Old Rasputin fan, you just may go nuts for this beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TheodorHerzl,4.63,"Pours an opaque black with one finer of dark mocha/tan head on it. It is very strange seeing a black beer pouring out of a can, and also not getting the canned ""hiss"" when opened. I rather like pouring this beer from can to glass. There is a ton of bittersweet chocolate in the nose with secondary scents of roasted coffee, molassas, hops, and some dark fruit. Quite the impressive nose on an imperial stout. The roasted coffee flavors come through at first sip, but other flavors intermingle quite well like powdered bitter cocoa, roasted grain, and burnt currants/plums. You notice all the flavors, but the bitter coffee/chocolate flavor comes through in every drink. I can barely detect any alcohol on the palate as well. This beer is velvety smooth and full bodied. The carbination is low as it should be. The drinkability is top-notch for this beer, and I would stock my house with it if I could find it locally, but I would have to be in the mood for this beer and wouldn't drink it on all occassions.  Overall I am pretty damned impressed by this beer. Personally it goes in my top 10 of all time.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,rowew,4.28,"Presentation: Great looking silver and black can with a mountain scene above the Ten Fidy logo. Would be nice to have date information, but obviously that won't be an issue with this for a while.  Appearance: Pours from the can very thick, completely black with a very dark brown colored good sized head. Nice retention and lacing.  Smell: Alcohol, lots of bitter and roasted aromas. Some dark chocolate and coffee.  Taste: Thick and creamy mouthfeel, very bitter in flavor. The bitterness is a nice combination of hops and espresso. Tons of roasted flavors, and the coffee and chocolate definitely shows up too.  Overall impression: Wow - this is definitely going to be a staple for camping this summer. Amazing to get this quality of beer in a can, and it seems to be readily available on the shelves in Colorado now.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,irishevans,4.68,"pours pitch black with a thin medium brown head, smells like a floral chocolate milk, an inviting one anyway. nice thick mouth-feel, and a flavor of chocolate malt, minor hop flavor, and a hint of caramel. the scary thing about it, is it drinks like milk, skim milk, in other words far, far too easy for it's abv. wonderful brew don't pass it up.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,WesWes,4.08,"The beer pours motor oil black with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich, black and chocolate malt scent that's bitter and roasted. Some hops sneak through the darkness. The taste is good. It has a very bitter, black malt and hop flavor. It's got a nice roasted character also, but the black malts prevail. The mouthfeel is excellent. It is a FULL bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I have to say that it's a bit over-hyped. It's about as black as a beer gets. But where is the complexity? All in all, I'm glad I finally got a chance to try this one. Thanks JJ.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,auxiliary,4,"appearance - Looked like oil when poured. Nice tan head formed that left some nice lace.  smell - Java beans, and dark chocolate.  taste - Dark chocolate taste with a bitterness to it.  mouthfeel - Full body.  drinkability - Pretty good beer, I would buy this again, seems like a hot little item.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,abankovich,4.23,"Poured out of a can filled completely up to the brim. It's funny opening a can and not getting the hiss that you'd normally expect from the carbonation in pop.  Actually very little head at all on this one. Poured aggressively into my snifter, this beer looks like oil while it's pouring out. Completely black, no light is able to get through when I hold it up in the air. The very thin head that did form was a nice brown color while it lasted. There is definitely a lot that clings to the sides of the glass when I swirl it or take a drink.  Smells of chocolate and java are hitting my nose but not overwhelming at all.  This beer is delicious. I love it and wish I lived in a state that sold it. Smooth chocolate is what I notice up front, it even feels like I'm drinking thick chocolate milk and I want to chew what's in my mouth. There is a quick hint of the alcohol in the middle that fades away to a very toasty flavor that lingers for awhile. Definitely warming as it goes down, and filling.  Again, I would love to have access to this beer. Very rich, filling, smooth, full and flavorful. Thanks again to RustyDiamond for the trade.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Left heavy lacing throughout. One of the best looking beers I have seen.  S-Some liight chocolate and burnt malt. Not as intense as I would have expected.  T-Chocolate, burnt malts and a slight bourbonesque tatse. Really nice tatse throughout.  M-Smooth and creamy. This has a serious good mouthfeel. So big and rich....ends with an odd alcoholic finish...keeping this from getting a 5.  D-Very nice but a bit too big to have many of. Glad to have had it on tap.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,flexabull,4.03,"Can courtesy of Jdiddy, thanks again.  Funny, when I grabbed this can from the fridge, I went looking for my bottle opener. Yet another benefit of canned beer, no need for one!  I have to say, it looks very cool, and also very odd seeing a black brew pouring out of a can. But it sure looks great, and matches well with the black and silver can.  Beer is a dark flat black color, with a great tan head.  Aromas are very nice, dark bitter chocolates, nutty, and creamy.  Taste is strong. This beer doesn't have any subtleness to it. This is a big black brew. There is a big dark malt presence, some coffee, nutty flavors, and very bitter dark chocolates. Alcohol is present, and gives the beer a warm feeling. While the finish is dry with some very bitter mineral flavors from the hops.  Mouthfeel is ok. Seems too thin for the style.  Drinkability is pretty good. This is a tasty and a quite good Russian Imperial Stout. It's not great though, I can think of a few others in the style that I prefer.  Kudos to Oskar Blues for continuing to put out very good beers in my favorite vessel, the can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,erosier,3.8,Pours a deep black color with a thick tan head that laces the glass all the way down. This beer smells of deep roasted malts and some hop bitterness and a little bit of alcohol. It tastes of sweet deep roasted malts but there is a slight burnt taste along with some hoppy bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel is good - very thick rich and creamy. The drinkability is good as I could have more than one of these in a night.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

A - black, with a coffee colored head that remained as a layer the entire time, leaving brown globs of lacing on the glass.  S - 'cocoa puffs' chocolatey aroma.  T - better than cocoa puffs, semi-sweet chocolate flavor gets a bitter kick in the pants on the finish.  M - thick, rich, smooth and creamy.  D - a yummy treat.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,DrJay,4.85,"Imperial stout in a can... cool. Thanks to Oxymoron for sending this in a recent trade. Pretty much black with faint brown edges, looked pretty thick during the pour. Fine, dark brown foam that left some streaky lacing on the glass. Though there isn't a lot there, it had good head retention. Chocolate/toffee aroma, some licorice, roasty, with faint fruity hops. Spicy? Super malty with solid, balanced bitterness. Lots of bready malts, bittersweet chocolate, slightly burnt, with citrusy hops hiding in the middle and lingering with toffee in the finish. There's a dark, ripe fruit character hiding in there too. Roast was milder than expected, letting the richness of the malt stay in the forefront, but it did manage to fill out the finish. Delicious. Awesome mouthfeel. Thick and creamy, silky texture, fine carbonation. Chewy and very heavy. Luxurious. Wow. No hint of alcohol at all, making this an insanely drinkable (and dangerous) imperial stout. Highly recommended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,letsgopens,4.7,"This fantastically unique RIS pours a completely opaque, ink black body with a luscious, dark brown, 1/2 inch of foam perched on top. The incredibly attractive head lasts good and long as well. This is essentially what an RIS should look like in my opinion. I can't imagine how I would improve it.  Wow, the aroma is just plain surprising; and in a good way. I expected a big, chocolaty, coffee, roast bomb (and don't get me wrong, those flavors are in there), but the primarily contributor to aroma is definitely the big leafy, bitter hops. I've never had an RIS that's been hopped this well while still maintaining such a fantastic texture. The hops are certainly something to behold but beyond that there is tons of deep, roasty notes and a hint of vanilla. Ridiculously unique.  The flavor is super creamy and formidable with smoke, strong black coffee, bitter baking cocoa, and even more of those delicious, pungent hops. Earthy, deep and roasty. So complex and satisfying. I've heard good things about this selection, but I wasn't expecting it to be this fantastic.  What a mouthfeel. Thick and creamy with a juicy, dense, syrup feel. It's essentially like sipping extremely tasty, aromatic motor oil but with a slight fluffy feel in the finish. This is one to savor, especially on a chilly, snowy nigh like tonight.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,AKBelgianBeast,4.88,"Holy God!!  Thanks to gkatsoris for the trade.  Pours pitch black, impenetrable to light. The beautiful head is what gets me right away. Nice thick mocha foam on top with incredible retention and great lace. My this smells good. Roasty and toasty. Just the way I like it. The taste on this is simply divine. Roasty toasty malts, nice coffee and chocolate flavors through the middle. followed by (IMO) the PERFECT amount of hop bitterness on the finish. This is one wonderful stout. The mouthfeel is flawlessly viscous and creamy. Drinkability cannot be beaten. I strongly recommend this stout to everyone. Anyone who doesn't think great beer can come out of a can, this beer will change your mind GUARANTEED!!!! (If you like impy stouts that is). Defenitely one of my favorite beers. This four pack is not going to last long. I'm going to Colorado. Honey! feed the dogs!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,largadeer,3.93,"Appearance - Pitch black. Even when thinned, it's black. The head is practically black. Quite easily one of the darkest beers I've ever seen.  Smell - Roasty and dough-like, almost burnt, with just a touch of sweet molasses. Almost smells like burnt coffee with a few sugars in it when it warms up a bit.  Taste - Dark roasted coffee, chocolate cookies and burnt toast immediately spring to mind. Not much sweetness here, with earthy hops providing even more bitterness. Sharp, burnt bitterness remains on the palate long after you've swallowed. While this is easily one of the most imbalanced imperial stouts I've had, it's damn good. The dryness is almost refreshing, making this one dangerously drinkable beer.  Mouthfeel - Full-bodied, viscous, moderate carbonation. Definitely not lacking in texture.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,nlmartin,4.17,This beer came my way from Beer Power Ball Week 2. Cant remember who sent it but big thanks to you!...  The beer was lightly chilled and poured from the can into an Imperial Pint glass.  Appearance: The beer pours pitch black with no opaqueness to light. The head is the color of lightly creamed coffee. The head quickly resolves to a ring of foam.  Smell: The beer delivers an aroma of very well roasted coffee. Bitter sweet chocolate notes raise up from the glass in counter point to the roasted and charred malts. This beer is very promising.  Taste: The beer delivers the expected well roasted coffee flavors. This is accompanied by nutty dry cocoa flavors. I can just barely taste the ghost of dark fruits prunes and raisins. This gives way to warming peppery alcohol and flash of bitterness.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The body of the beer is medium. The carbonation is low but appropriate. The has a pleasant smooth oilyness. This is a dam fine RIS. I enjoyed the beer from the moment I poured it into the glass. Well played Oskar Blues.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bassmantin,4.1,"Pours a very dark brown/black with fine, thick brown head into a wine glass. Very nice appearance. I am reviewing this beer without knowing what it is, so I hope I can provide an unbiased opinion.  Smell is nice and thick, rosty, with lots of chocolate. Fairly subdued, though. I like it. The initial taste is tame, with a good balance of chocolate and roasty malts. I like it quite a bit. The aftertaste hits with a brutal alcohol punch that last for quite some time. Now that my palate has been destroyed, I don't expect to ever taste those subtle malts again.  On second taste, the malts on this one have a very intricate sweetness. I almost taste bubblegum. Very intriguing. This is a great stout.  Overall: I don't know what it is yet, but I hope I get the chance to buy more. Just for kicks, I am going to guess what I think this one is before looking. Ok, I think it is the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout... Ok, I was way off. This one isn't nearly as intense. I forgot I had this one in the back of the fridge. Wow, what a great beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Ego,4.23,"obtained from oak tree buy rite (of course)  eyes... from a can (oooohhh ahhh) ""impressive, most impressive"" - darth vader a good full finger of head (cocoa colored) rises up and clings to the sides of the glass not wanting to let go. no light penetrates this beast, lacing is excellent, the head is made up of a nice pack of microbubbles on the surface/glass edge. the head is sticking around while I type all this BS. hell.. yeah..  nose... dark bitter chocolate mixed with dark bitter coffee (no sugar or cream), I also get some prune/raisin notes, whew.. the odor is BRINGIN' it. not the most complex thing to pass under the schnoz but it is assertive. this reminds me Rogue's imp, and that is impressive.. can vs ceramic bomber.. wow...  taste etc... the same bitterness in the aroma is there.. really walking the line between coffee and chocolate, the flavor is deep, this has such a nice punch flavor wise that you might miss the body being a bit too light for the style, this drinks wayyy too easy for that reason.. and also the alcohol is completely behind the curtain, the flavor is very rich, I am digging it, despite the body not being what I want it is hard to complain about this beer... man the flavor is deep as rosie o'donnel's .. nevermind...  verdict? a really good beer (really), recommended. it wasn't cheap, I would probably still default to Old Rasputin given availability/price but this one is worth seeking out if you like the style. I really enjoyed this beer and almost feel guilty for nit picking it's bad points. The bad points here are almost an afterthought really.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Monkeyknife,4.65,"Thanks to RoBotGod for this beauty.  Poured from a can a none-more-black with a thick rich chocolate malt head.  Aroma of chocolate, dark fruits, molasses, nuts, and booze.  Tastes of dark chocolate, dark fruit, and roasted malts. Noted lots of hops in the finish. The alcohol is in there and it shows.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, slightly slick, and mildly carbonated.  This is quite the enjoyable RIS from Oskar Blues and perfect for a cold snowy night. I'll definitely have this one again when given the chance.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,dickieb,4.48,"Pours pitch black, completely opaque with a good size dirty brown head. The lacing is apparent throughout and a darker shade of brown. The smell is nutty with dark malts and some light chocolate and some spent coffee beans. The flavor is again heavy with the dark and chocolate malts, and the coffee is a bit more evident here. I catch the smallest hint of some bittering hops, but one of the things this beer dose well is hide the heat. I would think it was 8% if I diddnt know better. The carbonation is light. making the mouthfeel light for the style, and the drinkability is right up their fro the RIS. This is without a doubt the best beer I have ever had out of a can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,MICAMD,4.26,"A- Pours absolutely pitch black... this is one of the darkest beers I have ever encountered. A very thick, creamy brown head forms and has wonderful retention. This is a mean looking beer.  S- Chocolate, some coffee, and nutty. Am I nuts, or do I get hints of raspberry in there too? Good, but not terribly complex.  T- Smokey, chocolate, coffee, nutty. Bitter, but not in a hoppy sense. Not all that intense, which is not a bad thing. Pretty subdued and subtle- which seems to be one of this breweries stronger points.  M- Wickedly smooth. This is wonderfully done. This almost seems as if it was half nitro/ half CO2. This really helps the drinkability.  D- Rich, but very smooth and tasty. Very impressive for the style. Not the best I have had, but thoroughly enjoyable.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,paulthebeerguru,4.35,"Poured into a snifter. Ten Fidy poured a deep black, like old motor oil, with a nice rich tan head that lingers for a little bit, with some light lacing. Aromas are of molasses, sweet malts, caramel, toffee, coffee and dark cocoa. Tastes are of coffee, rich chocolate, strong alcohol tons also linger. Some hop characteristics, but the malts just take over. Very complex. Mouthfeel smooth, creamy, and a little thick. Mild to low carbonation level. Outstanding stout, not a session beer by any means, but I could drink this consistently.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,3leggeddub,4,"Poured from can into Duvel tulip snifter.  Appearance: I know it's overused, but this stuff really does look like the aftermath of a long overdue oil change. Black brown that swallows light and allows none to penetrate. Very thin cocoa head.  Smell: Nutty. Roasted coffee. A hint of burnt chocolate. Not very strong though.  Taste: Lots of earthy bitterness like unsweetened chocolate. Alcohol. Finishes bone dry. Flies in the face of a lot of imperial stouts in that there isn't the creaminess and sweetness at the finish. There's lots of bitter and burnt here along with hops hiding away. Somehow given all that it's still appealling.  Mouthfeel: Oily and thick. Carbonation not really a presence. Covers the palate, but then disappears with that dry finish.  Drinkability: Given the boldness of the taste and high ABV one Ten Fidy will be enough for a sitting.  Overall: It's a compelling beer but definitely not for everyone. There will be plenty of RIS fans who will take a pass on this one, but you should at least try it once. In all honesty it could use something extra, maybe a touch of sweetness, to balance out the bitterness and sharp edges.  I picked up a 4 pack and the other 3 will last me a long, long time. It's a bit like a really strong rauchbier in that respect; even though it's good you need it only on occasion.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,KiltedCulinarian,4.26,"Served in a smallish goblet, presented a dark black color with a finger of dark chocolate brown foam. Lacing splotched all over the glass, and lasted for as long as I nursed this drink. Rich smell, which carried over into the flavor. Almost a little too bitter, but in a good way; I would compare it to a really well made espresso. Thick on the tongue with a full body. Not an everyday beer, but nice as a dessert. Quintessential stout.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,objectivemonkey,4.21,"...pauses... *did I just open up a can of motor oil?*  Nope. Out of a black and silver can, pours thick as sludge, dark and viscous as oil, no head, a few bubbles, looks menacing. Then, slowly, a head forms to half an inch, a very dark frothy one at that, one of the darkest heads I've ever seen. Lacing is left in large splotches all up and down the glass.  The aroma isn't as intense as I'd imagined it, but still loads of roasted malt, molasses, dark chocolates, slight bit of alcohol is evident.  The taste is also not as intense as I'd imagined, but still damn good. Actually, I've had a spate of RIS's of the not-so-in-your-face persuasion, and I""m liking it. Again, darkly roasted grains take it out of the gate, molasses and chocolates in collusion, some nicely roast coffee notes coupled with kind of a woody campfire feel, like sm'ores, minus the marshmallow. This is all with a smooth as velvet body with a full feel and fine carbonation, a very nice mouth to it.  In sum, I wish there were more umph to this beer, I really had to focus to get everything, which isn't in character with the style, imo. On the other hand, I could probably sit down with a sixer of this beer as if it were a hefe in June. An impressive feat for the style, and a very tasty beer.  Thanks to shuajw for this one.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JDV,4.38,"Big thanks to drmatt, miketd, tytoanderso and BlackForestCo for cans. I made sure to spread the love among friends! Pours black as oil with a small brown head in a snifter. Oats, chocolate, cocoa powder and something creamy almost like peanut butter, in the nose. Taste was dry baking chocolate, bittersweet cocoa powder, some creamy oats, but drying. Body was thick, creamy and oily, yet quite drying in the finish making for a unique experience on the palate. Mild bitterness, alcohol was very well hidden, and a slight chalky aftertaste. A great roasty big beer all around.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,dnichols,4.23,"I poured a 12 ounce (355 ml) can, received in a trade from iconoklaztor, into a mug.  A: It poured a thick, black as ink body with a two finger sticky head that as it receded suppored a beautiful, rich full curtain of lace.  S: It had aromas a dark roasted malts, bitter chocolates, expresso, dark spices, and piny hops. The aroma were pleasant but not as pronounced as I expected  T: It had a bitter-sweet chocolate flavor followed by a bold coffee flavor driven by sharp and bitter hops. There were hints of licorice, molasses, and dark fruits and spices.  M: It was full-bodied with a burnt malt and espresso coffee sweet and bitter profile. It finished dry and clean with only a small sour aftertaste.  D: It was too rich and full-bodied to be a session drink, however, it is a great one and out brew worthy of repeated sampling.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,udubdawg,4.24,"12 oz can  pours nicely viscous and black, no evidence of light at the edges of my Stone IRS glass. The head is quite dark brown and looks beautiful, tall and sticky, leaving exceptional rings of lace on one side, and spots with every sip on the side I'm drinking out of. Eventually it fades to a quarter inch of edge-clinging foam before refusing to die completely.  Nose falls short of the beauty of the pour, the complexity of the taste, and the creaminess of the mouthfeel, but enticing and reasonably full, just short of some of the aroma-heavy big stouts. Plenty of heavily roasted and charred malt here, heavy coffee aroma, some chocolate, hints of dark fruit. Sweetness is very dark molasses. Almost smoky. Not quite my favorite, but there's nothing to dislike here. Alcohol noted here only as it warmed to room temp. Well put-together.  Can't decide whether the taste or mouthfeel is better. So creamy and full bodied - very dense! Carbonation is soft, the herbal hops and charred malt adding sizeable bitterness that sticks around on the palate but falls short of obtrusive. Not quite dry, but well short of sticky. So full of heavily roasted goodness. Chocolate sticks out a bit more here than in the aroma; fruit remains light, almost an afterthought compared to the roastiness. Alcohol heat not noted on the palate or throat, but the stomach is notably warmed by midglass.  A sipper to be sure...one I must have more of. With just a bit more of the dark fruit coming through here I'd be tempted to give this a 5 for taste. Excellent and highly recommended!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,alysmith4,2.08,"This beer pours thick like gasoline, and I must say it tasted like it as well. Way to syrupy and bitter for my taste. Couldn't detect any distinct flavors.. just thick and bitter.  The level of carbonation was not great either. Just a thick, cloudy, syrupy mess. I would not have this beer again, and I would definitely not suggest this beer to anyone.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

There is a nice deep brown head that lingers leaving a dirty looking lacing down the glass. The aroma is dominated by deep chocolate and roasted malt, with just a hint of caramel. The flavor is just a bit sweet with tons more dark and black malts. There is some hop bitterness but its hard to differentiate from the astringency from the dark malts. The carbonation is light but fine for the style. This is all around a great imperial stout and a good deal too.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,dedrinker,4,"All good. Black with very little dark reddish areas under light. Thin tan head. Aroma of roasted malts, hops and alcohol in good balance. Combined it produces a licorice smell that I get in my more preferred Imperial stouts. Flavor is a repeat of the aroma which is good - I love when beer tastes as good as it smells (when it smells good that is). Full body that is at the same time easy going in the drinkability dept. Roasty finish with a dash of coffee, chocolate and hops. Yes yes ya'll, very nice.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S - Nice smell of sweet malts.  T - Taste is of roasted malt all the way. A great dark malt taste. Tiny tinge of sweetness then a black coffee/espresso flavor kicks up. Some hops noticeable on the background. Coffee aftertaste lingers.  M - A very full, heavy bodied beer which is the only way to go for a stout so full of black coffee bitterness.  D - A nice sloooow sipper, but a brew that keeps you coming back. Great after dinner drink.

A: pours a murky jet black thick and creamy sounding as it hits the bottom of my Dogfish Head snifter. Very little carbonation as a thing dark brown head forms and dissapears quickly leaving thin lacing.  S: Wow! This is one of the most aromatic smelling brews I have had in a while. Strong smell of chocolate coffee with cherries in the background. A little bitter coffee hop aroma ties it together.  T/M: This thing just keeps getting better! Wow! I feel like I am drinking a slightly melted milk shake flavored with a heavy amount of espresso shots and added flavor shots of chocolate and cherries and dark fruit. Thick and velvety with just a wee touch of carbonation to keep it from being overly sticky in the mouth. Don't get me wrong, your palate is still covered in oily tasty chocolate and cherries, but just not overly so.  D: This is delicious. I could drink them all day.

2681,34483,CharlesRiver,4.08,"I love the fact that this high end offering comes in a can. Perfect for places that don't allow bottles in.  I have been through Lyons a couple of times but never noticed this brewery. I will have to look it up next time.  Can pops with nearly no sound at all. Like a flat soda. Pours like motor oil. Completely black with a small brown head that seems to linger. Smell isn't as big as I expected. Chalk and chocolate combine with a touch of grassy hops.  First thing that I notice about the taste is that it isn't as big as I expected. Very smooth overall. Hops are present through out. The ending is a big blending of roasted malt and hops. Taste lasts for a good 25-30 seconds after the fact. Very little carbonation overall. This is a sipper. Thick, mouth coating feel to it.  More traditional in style and much different than others I have tried of late.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JackWeizen,4.55,"A black ink-like spit comes out of the can as I crack it, splattering the top of the can and my finger. Cool. This stuff pours out as black as the label. Creamy chocolate milk head forms and slowly fades while clinging to the side of the glass as is sits. It smells of charcoal and deeply roasted coffee beans.  Thick lacing forms after each sip and then thins out a bit down the glass. It tastes great. Bitter, and dry. Roasted barley leaves gooey sensation on the tongue. The roasted malt character is strong and well balanced against the bitterness from the hops. I taste things like espresso, chocolate, charred oak, cherry and brandy. Alcohol is subtle in flavor, but quickly warming.  I really wonder of thats roasted barley, or oatmeal leaving this gooey sensation. I'm going to have to try an oatmeal stout soon. It makes the beer seem thick, but its more like an amped up dry stout, than a sweet stout. The carbonation is perfect.  This stuff is really worth trying if you find it. I could drink it for breakfast, but its great after dinner. It is very intense, so if you prefer beer that is easy on the palette, beware.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ccrida,3.87,"Poured into my New Belgium Goblet, Ten FIDY is pitch black with a medium sized, tight bubbled head that is a very dark tan and leaves heavy lace. It is rather still, without even a crack of carbonation when I popped the tab. Served about 60F.  Smell is extreamly fruity, sweet caramel with only a hint of roast lingering in the background. Yummy.  Taste is the total opposite of the smell, in that it is massively roasty and woody, barely bittersweet and lacking the esters on the nose. The aftertaste is astrigent and burnt, and *really* lingers in the back of my throat, in-spite of which there is a noticably clean balance that makes it more enjoyable then I've probably made it sound. There is also a hint of sweetness on the finish that reminds me of lactose. First sip was a little dissapointing, mainly from the difference of the aroma, but also b/c it seems to roasty. After a few sips, I was begining to become convert, although even by then end I though it a bit to roasty for my taste.  Mouthfeel is smooth and luscious. Body is medium for the style.  Drinkability is pretty good, but not bananas, like this beer. Still a bit more roasty then I'd prefer, which seems to hinder it's depth, but still very nice and enjoyable. Worth seeking out, particularly for the novelty of such a big beer in a can being so good (e.g. once it's poured you'll never be able to tell it was canned).",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,beerthulhu,4.5,"A: Pours a very opaque reddish-black with a 1 finger dark chocolate/cherry bubbly head that was moderately lasting, leaving a great sticky film lacing behind all down the sides of the glass.  S: a rich, dark burnt roasted malt, dark rich, chocolate, pine and a lightly charred woodiness along with coffee.  T: The initial flavor was rich dark roasted coffee flavor that was very smooth and refined. There was a rich, dark, slightly burnt chocolate nature along with some dark licorice notes as well. A roasted burnt woodiness, deep roasted cocoa beans all add to the dark nature of this beer without adding any acrid bitterness. The flavor was very smooth and rounded.  M: warming, lightly roasted burnt malt and woodiness to it providing a silky, thick coating on the tongue along with some dark chocolate.  D: A rich, delicious treat that makes you wish you could have more. Case worthy for future enjoyment.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,session1979,4.45,"Setting: Stuck on the couch watching American Idol with the wife so I went to the fridge to find something that could take the edge off, Ten FIDY it was..  Appearance: Poured this into my DFH snifter. Pours with the color and viscosity of used old black engine oil but with an amazing depth and clarity. The can burps as it releases this amazing beer. Once poured a thick 3 finger dark milk chocolate head sits atop the liquid and lasts for quite a while.  Nose: The nose is full and rich with chewy dark chocolate brownies, fresh brewed espresso, roasted barley, oats and molasses. The alcohol is noticeable and almost like a warning shot across the bow to remind you this is a big badass beer....  Taste: Wow, so freaking good. Big bold flavors, coffee, dark roasted malts, creamy caramel, slightly bitter chocolate. The ominous nose that warned of dominate alcohol was indeed misleading as the ABV is buried nicely under a flavor barrage of all that is good.  Mouthfeel: You know from the moment you pour this beer that the mouthfeel is going to be more like a heavy cream then a beer, and indeed it is. Moderate carbonation and the creamy texture make this a party in your mouth.  Drinkability: I would call this moderately drinkable and that is based much more on the fact that it is a full flavor powerhouse as the ABV presence isn't all that noticeable.  Overall: I have had this several times now and each time it has just gotten better and better. The first time I had it was 2 days after canning and it was very bitter and phenolic, almost like eating powdered aspirin. That was a one time taste as it has now become one of my favorite Imperial Stouts.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,far333,3.92,"On tap at Plan B, Simsbury, CT. Served in a chalice. Inky black and opaque. Nearly no head, but I believe that's a result of a bad pour rather than a deficiency of the beer.  Low aroma of cocoa, smoke and molasses. Sharp initial flavor of burnt espresso, dark chocolate and molasses. Some bits of marshmallow come through, followed by a charred oak finish. The ABV is relatively hidden except for some warming of the mouth and cheeks mid sip, and some vapors that make their way slowly up the back of the nose.  Moderate to low carbonation, smooth mouthfeel but not too bubbly, not a great deal of body. This is a tasty beer and pretty drinkable, but IMO it's being elevated a bit by the hype it's been generating.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,triplecoil,4.43,"Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter.  Extremely dark pour with a thin and quickly dissipating brown head. Nose of roasted malt, molasses, and beef jerky. Taste is bitter coffee and chocolate, some sweetness from the heavy malt, somewhat spicy aftertaste (the beef jerky again?), and a little alcohol. Mouthfeel is viscous with some nice carbonation.  This is definitely a premium imperial stout.

Nice creamy, pillowy head with good retention. S: Semi-sweet/dark chocolate, tobacco, tiniest hint of alcohol that increases as it warms. Not much coffee aroma, which I've smelled a lot of in other RISs. Nice for a change! T: Bitter and roasty. Bitter like bakers cocoa. A sweet cherry flavor comes through with some raisiny sweetness. I wish it were a tad sweeter/played with the middle of my tongue more. M: Terribly smooth! Where is the heat?! So creamy due to phenomenal head retention. D: I feel the alcohol after 1/4 pint!

S - molasses, espresso, roasted grains dark sweet malts.  T - similar to the nose with a nice hop left undercut. Rich sweet balance of flavors but a definite lean towards roasted / acrid burnt flavors.  M - full bodied, rich smooth and enticingly put together to leave the mouth with a nice residual roast impression  D - did this really pour from a can? I have to get over that.

2681,34483,Zorro,4.03,"Sampled through a trade with Northertimber.  Pours a thick black colored beer with a thin brown head.  Smell is sweet with a trace of hops giving it a scent best described as 'carrot sticks."" Caramel candy and chocolate syrup aromas and a hint of smoke. Faint fig Newton cookie aroma.  The taste starts out thick chocolate with a lot of patent malt and smoke and roast flavor. Gets more bitter as you drink it with a long lasting roast malt and smoke aftertaste. Faint berry and vanilla flavors but this beer is all about the roast.  Mouthfeel is quite thick.  Not bad at all but I may have had my expectations a little to high for this beer based upon word of mouth. Nice and very smooth what it lacks it that extra layer of complexity that the best Russian Imperial Stouts posses.

2681,34483,NCSUdo,4.45,"Poured from a 12 oz can, from Oxymoron  A: Pours a deep dark black under a inch and half dark brown head. Some good lace and retention.  S: Smells of a sweet but roasted malt. A bit of mocha, dark fruit and hint of cream. Very appealing to the nose.  T: Very nice. Sweet and roasted, a little bit of anise flavor, good bitterness from the roasted malt, some dark coffee and chocolate hints. Alcohol is there with some warmth, but it can't be tasted.  M/D: Big, full bodied, extremely velvety on the tongue. Drinkability only hampered by the big ABV. This one is very, very smooth and extremely tasty.

2681,34483,dreadnatty08,4.65,"Pours, well black as hell, completely opaque, with a solid quarter inch of dirty brown head, and some nice tracing. Gorgeous so far. Aroma's are not as strong as expected: cocoa, roasted coffee, black patent, creamy bourbon (if there was such a thing), and quite a bit of citrusy hops. On the palate, the roasted barley tumbles the tongue, chocolate malts develop finishing with some high alcohols and those west coast hops. It finishes almost minty and vodka like. Incredibly chewy in the mouth with moderate carbonation and heavy mouthfeel. Very refreshing after recently having Storm King and Black Bear stouts finding them just way too hoppy. Hops here are quite evident but very balanced. Not much bitterness from the malts, I imagine a low percent of black and roasted malts, making it very smooth. This is a very enjoyable RIS from a brewery who has such a solid lineup.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,TurdFurgison,4.11,"Big thanks to Dev (BuckeyeSox) for this can. I poured it into a standard pint glass, and admired it's looks for a while. Honestly this is one of the most appetizing looking beers, dark dark brown with a thick frothy foam colored like chocolate milk. Really good lacing on the glass too. The aroma is roasted malt, very rich smelling. The flavor is roasty with just a touch of sweetness, and quite a bit of bitterness in the after-taste. The mouthfeel is thick, giving a nice match to the rich flavor. I recommend this beer, but the only drawback is that I'd prefer a little less burnt bitterness in the taste.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,NBake,4.08,"Ten Fidy  The can is interesting, like all of the Oskar Blues clan, with goofy quotes and a simple yet appealing graphic in the background. I'm excited for this one.  I pop the top, hear that little fizz of delight and ceremoniously pour Ten Fidy into my big mug. I am rewarded for my effort with a black body, capped with 3 fingers of beautiful brown head.  The nose is unexpectedly hoppy, with notes of chocolate and general roastiness mixed in.  First taste brings lots of roasty and hop filled bitterness with some dark fruits and cocoa, followed by some alcohol and rebounding back into bitter dark chocolate flavors. The alcohol and chocolate stick to the roof of your mouth, begging you for another sip. I'll oblige. I'll admit, there is a lot of sweet malt flavor going on here as well, but this one is really about the roasted barley, and an assertive hop profile. I dig it.  Ten Fidy goes down smooth. It is viscous, with low carbonation and right on for the style, as far as I'm concerned. It isn't too syrupy or sickly sweet.  Overall, this is a great beer. Many of the Imperial Stouts out there are very sweet, which is ok, but this one is dry enough to session, if you can handle the booze. It brings a flavor that is hard to get tired of and I would recommend it to all that are unafraid of dark beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BattleRoadBrewer,4.27,"Served cool in a nonick pint. Reviewed blind against Abyss, KtG, DL, Ky BS, P. Mortel, Stone IRS, B. Albert.  Pours thick, black and with great clarity. Nice foamy dark brown head leaving heavy lacing.  Aroma is surprisingly mild, a blend of chocolate, dark fruitiness and roastiness.  Taste is complex and perfectly balanced between roastiness, chocolate, and hops. Unexpected hop burp at the finish.  Mouthfeel is creamy smooth and perfectly bittered. Light in a good way with a hint of lingering oiliness. Feels like it would have good ABV but with no alcoholic bite--perfectly balanced.  Drinkability is just great. Glad this came to Massachusetts so I could buy a bunch of it and drink it regularly, instead of having to trade for it. Down with rare beers--this is a great one. But rare beers aren't reviewed by the macro-swilling masses, so this one's overall rating is being pulled down by people who don't like imperial stouts.

2681,34483,bigeyedfish,3.83,"12 oz can courtesy of Johnny Med poured into a rodenbach grand cru tulip.  pitch black body, which looks even more reminiscent of motor oil when it comes from a can, with a thin layer of milk-chocolate-colored head. the head fades pretty quickly, save for a burnt-red layer around the outer rim; some nice lacing.  not as strong a smell as i expected it to be; some roasted malt and some dark cocoa, some tobacco, even a tad bit of smoked meat. so yeah, it smells like an imperial stout. one of the more subdued russian imperials, at least based on smell- nothing really blows you away with this one.  interesting taste. the mid-palate is a lot of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cocoa powder. the finish is a little bit of hop bitterness, which is unexpected, but with the recent interpretations of the style, not totally unexpected. but the finishing part of the finish is a little hot, a little metallic and a little almost unpleasant. it's kind of comparable to the taste of salt. really sweet beginning taste though- a little butterscotch-like.  for an imperial stout actually pretty lacking in body. there's some carbonation/sensation that develops in the back of the mouth around the mid-palate and lingers till the finish, so that's mildly unpleasant. yeah, the most noticeable mouthfeel characteristic is the astringency on the finish. there isn't a whole lot of palate coating, it's not a super rich body.  this is a lot smoother than a lot of other russian imperials; it does not have a huge hop presence, and there is not an abundance of flavor that might make you feel full; it doesn't have that huge pallet coating that keeps the taste of the beer fresh in your mind for hours and it isn't out of this worldly alcoholic. and yet, for each of those categories it's easy to envision a beer that fits the description. with this one? it's from a can. sometimes its good to be average. right?",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JMH_,4.1,"Pours an oily black colour with a much smaller than expected mid-sized to small dark tan head that quickly fades to a thin lace and leaves minor amounts of residue on the glass.  The aroma is nice but is not nearly as pronounced as I would have expected: chocolate, coffee, roasted malt and perhaps a slight touch of fruit sweetness. There's definitely a hint of noticeable alcohol here as well.  Flavour basically hits on all of the notes from the aroma: there is a big roasted malt presence throughout along with a much bolder coffee flavour than was to be expected from the aroma. Any chocolate/cocoa and sweetness is more subdued, although still present. Alcohol flavour creeps in mostly at the finish of each sip to provide for a nice bite. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a good amount of creaminess to it. There is also a fair share of hotness here from the alcohol.  This was a very nice brew overall, but it just didn't live up to the hype that has been built around it. I was expecting to try something that would rank amongst the best beer I've ever had, which is always difficult to live up to for any beer and for anyone. Instead, I got a rock-solid excellent example of the style that just couldn't get to that tip-top level for me.

The stout is dark and black, its event horizon absorbs all light.  S: The nose is an intense amalgum of chocolate, burnt toast, coffee, molasses and dark alefruits. All this from a can? Awesome!  T: The stout packs a big hoppy bite up front. Somewhat surprising because it really didn't register in the nose. The citrus is in contrast to the dark roasted stout body. Coffee and chocolate, mixed with dark fruits and molasses, nicely define the post-hops body. A sugary sweet chocolate flavor lingers in the palate long after the sip is gone.  M: The mouthfeel, despite the abundance of different flavors, really comes together nicely. The acrid burnt flavor is a nice sendoff.  D: At 10% this is a whopper.

If it's in such short supply I've got to get back to the store from which I purchased it and purchase as much as they'll let me have. Yes I did like it. The pour at first gives no indication of the head that will first endear you to this interesting rendition of an imperial stout. The pour at first seems to produce no head to speak of with a pour so slow and with a viscosity to mirror that your heaviest of black gold (choose what weight of oil you will), in the end from the gathering of bubbles in the glass appears a thick medimum brown head (a good half inch in a conventional pint glass). The head allow for the perfect lace to form on the glass with each sip. The head does however disapate into a fine brown ring a each sip bring you closer to the bottom of the glass. The nose is of alcohol and deeply roasted grain. The taste is a wonderful roast and, chocolate flavor with an aftertaste who lingering roasted nutty flavor sits on the back of your tongue wishing for more. While I did detect a slight alcohol nose the drinkability is not impaired by the 10% ABV, yes that the scary part I could have turned this into a sessions beer very easily. Oh! Yea one after another. Yes it has the ability to make you forget that you are drinking a 10% ABV beer and visiting the far side of the moon.

Taste is much like the aroma. At first I am hit by a sticky sweetness which is followed by the arrival of roasted malts and, towards the finish, some dark chocolate and hop bitterness. The dark fruits don't appear until after the bitterness. In the late finish I get some alcohol, not hot or overwhelming, but noticeable. Mouthfeel is ok, it was a bit too thin IMO. This brew is medium, maybe medium-full, in body and has low carbonation. Drinkability is good, there was a nice alcohol warmth (a good thing) but overall I just wasn't that impressed. Its a solid brew and one that I'll revisit (since I have a few more cans) in the hope that tonight was just a bad night for FIDY.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

2681,34483,manleyphoto,4.31,"At any given time I have about ten different beers that I consider my white whales. Beers that based on reputation are must-try, but for whatever reason are not widely distributed, or are one-offs, or only available at the brewery. Until this week, Ten FIDY was one of those beers. I have pursued this beer with an Ahab-like fervor and unlike the fateful sea captain my search has been satisfied.   Ten FIDY is like a black hole. A vortex of malt and flavor that seems hardly contained in its unassuming can. This beer lives up to its vehicular namesake and pours as thick and rich as motor oil. It is so dense and so dark that the small bit of foamy head that manages to make it up through the liquid is as dark brown as cocoa powder. The smell alone told me that my search for this beer was not in vain, and the fist sip confirmed that fact. This is a slow drinker with loads of slightly sweet and roasty malt, coffee, and dark chocolate, with the slightest touch of root beer near the end of the taste. Ten FIDY is not as sticky-sweet as other versions of the style and the right amount of hops, coupled with a mild-drying astringency from the roasted malts make this really fun to drink.   Often when searching out elusive beer, the result tends to be disappointing. Ten FIDY lives up to expectations, and then some. This is a seasonal brew from Oskar Blues, with an unknown availability. Luckily it is brand new in the area, and there should be enough supply, at least for now. Don't let this one be your white whale, cast off the bow lines and sail over to the store and pick up as much of this as you can get your hands on. This is definitely one of the best beers I have had this year.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S - This smells pretty alcoholic to me... snifters are supposed to bring out aromas, but I really don't smell much else.  T - Taste more than makes up for the smell. There is almost no alcohol flavor in the beer, and it has a wonderful roasted flavor.  M - Thick and smooth, with only slight carbonation. Great overall balance, it is a pleasure in your mouth.

They formed a head so dense and thick it looked like a chocolate milkshake float. Thick doily like lace clung to the sides of my glass with each sip forming intricate patterns. This is one of the best looking brews I've ever seen.  Big espresso notes on the nose followed by dark cocoa and burnt molasses. Big roasted malt aroma in the finish with a hint of smoke and alcohol.  Upfront notes of burnt molasses and caramel. Followed by burnt sugar sweetness and caramelized dark fruits and licorice. Dark roasted espresso notes lead into unsweetened dark baking cocoa. Hops come up in the finish with a slight citrus rind twang and some alcohol vapors.  The mouthfeel is like liquid silk, and although it displayed a serious head, the carbonation is low and it goes down very smooth. Very drinkable despite the high abv.

Which worked good in the long run because I enjoyed the malts even more as the beer wormed to room temp.Intimidating at first glance, but opens up nicely as reaches room temp, and becomes very inviting. Up front on the taste is a bold burnt malt taste which follows the beer down. Just when you think the beer is done, the alcohol comes back on the finish with reckless abandon, with a hint of hops.

I got my one and only four-pack two days ago at 3 Sons in Wexford -- something I had been dying to try since reading about it in BA mag a couple of months back. That kind of anticipation is often hard to equal once you finally get your hands on the beer.  I'm happy to say that in this case, Ten Fidy was as good as I had hoped -- and maybe better.  A -- darkest, thickest beer I've ever seen. Saying it pours like oil is not an exaggeration. Thin, dark brown head forms after a hard pour. And stays. And stays. And stays.  S -- maybe the only thing about this beer that's close to pedestrian. Big roasted aroma, with coffee up front and chocolate and tobacco in the background.  T -- Wow. Chocolate is bigger than the aroma would suggest, but not sweet at all. Coffee and other roasted flavors swirl around the chocolate, and there's a nice, dry, hoppy tinge at the end. What you don't get much of is the alcohol; a remarkable job of masking for a 10-percenter.  M -- Luscious. Rich. Thick. Smooth. Holy crap.  D -- Rated high, because of the exceptional complexity and off-the-hook mouthfeel. Easy to forget this beer's ABV.  OK. If you have a chance to try this, don't pass it up.

A smokey and hopped finish with a slight alcohol heat. Full bodied, low in carbonation, smooth and creamy with a nice bite.

2681,34483,jaxon53,3.98,"Couldn't wait to try a canned RIS. Served at just about cellar temperature, in a snifter, from yes, a can! Let's see if it lives up to the hype.  Appearance: Pours out a deep inky, spent motor oil black. Possibly the blackest I've seen. Not a single ray of light could pass through this tar colored liquid. A vigorous pour yielded about a half inch of thinnish, dark, coffee colored head. Head receded rather quickly, leaving some thin streaks of dark lace.  Smell: A bit of a faint nose on this one. Nice roasted malt aroma with some prominent chocolate notes. Maybe a little molasses or brown sugar sweetness with some underlying dark fruits and black licorice. Almost a warm, freshly baked cookie in there as well. Pretty good so far.  Taste: Wow! A bit different. Quite bitter and dry in my opinion. A little coffee, a bit of dark chocolate, and an almost oaky flavor. A little dark fruit, maybe a raisin flavor. Tons of roasted malts with a mild hop bite. Finishes pretty smooth, with a little molasses and some noticeable booze. Not bad at all.  Mouthfeel. A bit dissapointed in this part of the brew. A little bit thinner than I would like but decent. Comes up just short of chewey. A moderate amount of carbonation is felt on the tongue and throat.  Drinkability: Pretty good drinkability despite the high ABV.

2681,34483,kkipple,3.99,"On-tap at the legendary Brick Store Pub in Decatur. Thanks Dave & Co.  Served in a goblet. Ten Fidy is: deep. Black. Deep black. Spotty, red-dark small head. Low retention. No complaints here.  Wait till it warms and you'll be rewarded with a rich malt-heavy nose that sports dense roasted grain, coffee, loads of cocoa, tobacco, vanilla and earth. Delicious, but subdued compared to some in the style. Alcohol is easy to pick out.  Now we're talking! Bitter coffee and burnt grain up front, followed quickly by chocolate and even more espresso. Large amounts of earthy hops shine through all the black mess; it's all very intense and in your face. Booze is noticeable. A sipper for sure. Unreal that this comes in canned form.  Carbonation is medium-hi off the keg; all quite acceptable. Mouthfeel is dense and slick, finishes roasty and earthy with a big coffee and hop bitterness.  Ten Fidy isn't awfully drinkable, but then it's a 10% Russian Stout. In a can. A can I say! Goodness. Perhaps the most intense beer to ever see the inside of an aluminum cage, Ten Fidy is something you should seek out and release.

S: Chocolate and coffee. I could also smell a hint of alcohol.  T: Coffee is the first taste my mouth has and then gradually it changes to chocolate. There is a slight hop taste which I love but the heavy malt is the most recognizable taste. I can barely taste the alcohol despite it being 10% ABV. Tasty indeed.  M: Smooth with very little carbonation. Goes down like water.  D: So I had read that this was a sneaky beer. I didn't realize it while drinking, but a short while later after finishing..POW!

2681,34483,Overlord,4.25,"I am disappointed to see that this beer has been retired for many reasons. It was pretty good. The novelty of drinking a canned RIS was intriguing. And, as I continue on my quest to drink BA's top 100, this has now been knocked out.  It pours like motor oil out of the can. Actually rather difficult to pour it evenly into a glass. About a two inch tan head thast settled down quickly. But, the head didn't go completely away, which was a welcome surprise.  Great thick mouthfeel. Smells like roasted malt, chocolate, and a strong whiff of roasted currant or some perhaps sour cherries. Taste is more of the same; big roast malt, big chocolate, sour cherries/currant, and not too much coffee (Speedway Stout is probably the only heavily ""coffee-ed"" stout that I love).  This was good stuff. Sorry to see it retired.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,nickfl,3.99,"A - A half finger of cinnamon colored head appears on a thoroughly black body that looks like motor oil coming out of the can. The head quickly shrinks to a thin film and leaves behind little lace.  S - Lots of dark, roasty malt notes. Coffee, roasted tea leaves. There is a bit of chocolate as well, but the character is mostly roast, with low hop aroma.  T - Strong, coffee like bitterness along with herbal hop flavor. Lots of tannic, earthy roast flavors follow along with a strange mint/ licorice note. The finish is full of lingering bitterness as well as a bit of alcoholic warmth that is the only time the beer reveals its significant ABV.  M - Heavy, oily body with moderate carbonation. Slightly tannic mouthfeel and mildly sweet finish.  D - Obviously not a session beer, but a bit hard to drink even for a 10% ABV stout. The aroma is very nice, but the overwhelming malt bitterness in the taste is a bit out of proportion despite the heavy body and residual sweetness. A very complex and interesting beer, but a bit over the top on roast character, in my opinion.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Body was beautiful and opaque black. The whole thing looked like spent motor oil as I poured it from the can. Lacing left on the sides of the glass was sticky, brown and muddy.  S- Smells like strong dark french roast coffee, espresso and a hint of licorice and strong alcohol. Very inviting and fairly strong for an RIS.  T- Exactly what an RIS should taste like- Dark roasted malts, coffee and strong alcohol backed with a pleasant hop bit and a hint of sweet black licorice in the finish. Aftertaste leaves me dreaming of dark roasted malts and wishing I had grabbed a whole bunch more of these when I had the chance. Absolutely phenomenal flavor profile, and this one came from a can!!  M- Viscous and oily while remaining smooth and creamy. Mouth and tongue coating is very pleasant and lingers the way an Imperial Stout should. A tribute to the style.  D- This one works best as a slow sipper, but the taste is such that I want to sip over and over again, even once the beer is finished.

2681,34483,Gueuzedude,4.05,"First Canned Batch; Sampled February 2008 Pours with a very tightly beaded, creamy, darkly browned, tan colored head that starts out about a finger in height. The beer is black and no amount of holding up to the light makes it anything but opaque. The aroma is dominated by roast grain notes from the get go; aromas of dark chocolate, smooth espresso, concentrated chocolate malt ball candies, sweet malted grain. When you go in for a really deep sniff of the nose, the sweeter dark grain notes yield to a dry, amply toasted, browned bread crust notes and a blackened biscuit character. Touches of roasted, tart cherries provide a nice fruity character here, though at times it is overwhelmed by the more dominant, yet overall quite smooth, roast character. Quite a nice aroma, this Imperial Stout has escaped the harsher, roasted grain notes and hot booziness that any others have.  Thick, rich, chewy, this is really a meal in a sip. This viscous brew coats the mouth enough that it provides nourishment even after the beer has passed down my throat. Dark, sweet malt notes coat the mouth for at least a minute after my first sip, after which, sharp, roasted grain notes reminiscent of a dark, but well roasted, gourmet coffee take hold and provide a bit of a drying effect. The texture of this brew is quite nice, it starts out a little light, but quickly picks up a rich, creamy texture and a velvet-like feeling that coats the mouth. Sweet grain character provides an interesting dark cherry and bright berry note here that is offset by a nicely roasted dark chocolate note, a touch of chalky blackened grain, some light espresso acidity and a woody charcoal note. An appropriate carbonation struggles to be noticed through the viscous body of this brew. The hop character is fairly mellow, except for a biting bitterness that just cuts through the thick body of this brew, but is noticeable from start to finish.  As the beer warms up I get a touch of that vegetal note (more in the aroma than anything) that I had noticed the first time I had this brew. It is not nearly as noticeable or distracting as it was the first go round though. The alcohol becomes a bit more noticeable as does the sharper roast & perhaps the acidity notes, though not overly so. This still remains a nicely rounded example of an Imperial Stout.  I would definitely recommend this beer to be sampled around 50°F / 10°C as this allows the roast to be well mellowed & integrated; as it warms up towards 60°F / 15°C it becomes a touch more harsh, though still quite tasty. While this brew is has an amped up roast character, it never becomes overwhelming; the sweet malt base is able to hold it in check and allows the mellower dark malt notes of chocolate, roast fruit and woody coffee notes to come through quite well. This is much more engaging and interesting than my first experience with this brew. A really nice sipping brew and a perfect way to end the night.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,trumpetego,4.5,"Picked up a four pack of this at Bauer in Boston on 2/8/08. Pours thick and jet black, with a thin brown head. The head goes away quickly but provides some lacing. Smell is of coffee, dark chocolate, and a bit of hops. Sweet smoke. Everything an RIS should be. Strong coffee and chocolate taste, but with a sharp bitterness to balance out the sweetness. Finish is more bitter coffee - something like good Italian espresso. Very nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the style. It still has some heft, but (despite the appearance) it isn't like drinking motor oil. I'm sampling this reasonably warm (it was purchased about an hour and a half ago and has not been refrigerated since), and I could see it being a bit heavier if it were colder. Although I'm a bit fan of RIS's with dessert, I think this one is best by itself.

Nose of sweet cocoa, espresso, slight caramel, and a bit of dark fruit. A tad earthy with a slight grassy hop presence.  Roasty flavor up front falls quickly into a bitterness that stings the tongue. Intermingled are bitter nestle cocoa, sweet molasses, and a sharp bitter coffee bean flavor that reminds me of dunkin donuts crappy iced coffee. Bitterness is fucking acrid and quite unpleasant. I was hoping this to have a lot more lactic smoothness, but there is no milkiness here, only a sharp bitterness. Roasty coffee flavors take over the aftertaste and leave the palate quite dry. Hints of caramel as you exhale strongly through the nose.  I'm not sure all the hype surrounding this beer is warranted.

I thought the smell was reserved at first, but the aroma is nice. A kind of creamy RIS without all of the sharp edges. Lightly roasted creamy maltiness. The mouth feel is adequately carbonated, medium bodied and again quite creamy. The flavor is quite good also. Not a lot of sharp flavored edges from the ingredients. Funny, how I was thinking how easy this is to drink! Then the ten little fidos sank their teeth into me. I also noticed that the bottom of the can smelled more like alcohol too.

2681,34483,rajendra82,4.41,"The pour of Ten Fidy, the long awaited Oscar Blues Imperial Stout, started out like a can of motor oil. The body was pitch black, and the head was small, brown, and short lived. The smell was burnt and smoky and full of coffee that has thickened due to having the pot left on the burner for too long. Some bakers chocolate in the smell as well. The taste was a full on roast fest. The bitter, acrid, and astringent taste was much closer to a American Double Stout the the sweet and prune like flavors I typically see in a Russian Imperial Stout. Not too many hops, but the dried up body didn't need many anyway. Quite soft and oily on the palette, and avoided the harshness than some of the style sometimes display. Quite warming, but otherwise not flaunting the high ABV.

Very sticky in the mouth leaving a film on the tongue.  D- Of course, this style is not for sessioning. But, this beer drinks as well as any I have had as a stand-alone drink.  Overall- I have read and heard the hype, and I must say that this beer is worth every bit of it! Very nice representation of the style and one of my top beers I have ever had. I love it and it is great!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,GratefulBeerGuy,4.73,"Big props to Oxymoron for this can! 12oz can> 12 oz Postel chalice glass. (This dog'll hunt)  pours out black as a moonless night, very thick pour, looks like used-up motor oil, which is exactly what I like. The head is very impressive, one full finger deep, very dark brown color that's solid and even...one of the darkest, stickiest heads I've seen. The lacing is long and the dissipation slow, but eventually settles down to a thin covering with a solid, dense ring around the edge. If looks could kill...  The aroma is sweet/smokey chocolate scent, latte with vanilla, toasted marshmellow's, nutmeg and a slight tinge of heat with a subtle herbalness way down deep.  This is the way ""robust"" should taste, Huge malt complexity which includes: Smokey and sweet chocolate, vanilla, tangy fruits such as, sour green grapes and wild blueberries. The malt is quickly challenged by a big, acrorn-like bitterness from the hops. A cascade-ish leafy, earthy bitter that hijacks the flavor spectrum, but then it all melds together again and proves the balance is right on for RIS. The massive malt flavors is worth savoring in every sip. This one finishes with an earthy bittermness and black coffee flavor.  This one is just perfect feel-wise IMO, as heavy and thick as possible, Dense-full body that is smooth and creamy. The tell-tale factor...sticky lips!  This is my kinda brew, Bad-ass brew in a 12 oz can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,IntriqKen,4.58,"I am sorry. This is like ""not right"". A high class quality craft dark RIS in a CAN? Tell me I'm dreaming.  Pours beautifully for an RIS...almost jet black...thick as used motor oil....heavy half finger coffee colored head that leaves a very very heavy map in it's wake on the side of the glass.  Aroma is heavy with sweet dark molassis, espresso, dark sugar and dark, sweet candy.  Taste? There is something really, really smokey going on in here. Wow. Smokes, caramel...smoke...slightly bitter finish. This isn't like any RIS I've ever had. Maybe I should have read some of the other reviews first, but I just can't get past the smokey flavors here. Now that I've tasted it, my nose is full of the smoke.  And I love it. Don't know how it rates as a RIS, but...yum. Rich, warm, satisfying. --- Ok...I'm crazy. I just read some of the other reviews and none of the ones I saw said anything about ""smoke"". Smoke is the predomident thing I get from this beer. I still like it. Damn. I must be crazy. Let it warm... Ok...warm there is more candy sweetness in the aromas. Taste goes beyond the smokey. I've got caramel...dark and almost burnt. Espresso coffee...again..almost burnt...sweet dark, dark brown sugar.... Aroma is moving more towards brown sugar without the burnt aromas and a touch of vanilla. Flavor profile has more vanilla and creamyness to it as it warms as well. Bitterness and burnt flavors mellow and disappear.  I give up...there is a lot of personality as well as a lot of personalities in this beer. Wonderful and a true pleasure to drink and discover.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,geexploitation,4.28,"From the can, this beer pours extremely thick and basically opaque, with a small, very dark tan head. Relatively little on the nose aside from roasted malts, a splash of chocolate and vague milky-sweet smells. On the palate, however, things get more interesting. Very smooth, with a quick rush of hop bitterness and raw alcohol, alongside plenty of roasted malts and a bit of caramelized flavors. There's a bit of spiciness in the background, but little in the way of fruitiness or other esters. It's a rather straightforward beer. This isn't to say it's mediocre; quite to the contrary. While the malts are relatively straightforward, they strike no wrong notes, and instead envelope the tongue with rich, really huge, malt flavors that are perfectly balanced by hops. It's an uncomplex but satisfying, comforting and hugely enjoyable beer. Very well done.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,markgugs,4.48,"poured from a 12oz. can into a Sam Adams Beer glass  A: This beer is insanely dark, almost jet black, and absolutely no light has a chance of penetrating it in the glass. A gorgeous dark brown, creamy head rises the height of 2 fingers and leaves behind an ample amount of spider-web sticky lacing.  S: Smells are all of the sweet variety: sweetbread, milk chocolate, cocoa, and dark breads & grains dominate.  T/M: A sharp hop bite up front, and then all the dark flavors take over. Beer develops into rich, roasted char & a very chocolatey body. Sweet, dark fruits - mostly cherry - make their presence known as the beer warms. And then an intensely bitter charcoal finish, almost ashy, creeps up on you, delivering a very noticeable alcohol warming on the backside. Feels slick & oily, coating the tongue with ease, until a minor aspirin dryness finishes things off.  D: Given the 10% ABV & the massive charred finish, it's not as drinkable as other monster stouts, yet it's still an amazing representation of style and well worth seeking out.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,sacfly,4.46,"12oz. can (love that!) No date. Pours a... good lord this is dark... Completely opaque. Some of the darkest brown bubbles in the head I have ever seen. Smell is of blackstrap molasses, cookie dough, and a hint of charcoal. Creamy mouthfeel. Great meld of flavors that were in the nose, with none really standing out too much until the finish. A touch of hops gives way to 70%+ dark chocolate and charcoal. Never thought I would describe a charcoal flavor or finish in a good way, but here it is. Great beer, and one of the best imp. stouts out there.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S - Dark chocolate, caramel, alcohol and a whiff of dark fruit (plum, maybe black cherry)  T - Front is luxurious dark chocolate and roasted coffee with some caramel and smoke in the middle with a bit of molasses like sweetness followed by a slightly burnt bitter and a wee bit of alcohol and bitter fruit in the back.  M - Very smooth, creamy and thick. Slight carbonation.  D - If it weren't for the high ABV I could have quite a few of these. As is anything more than two or three would be pushing it.

2681,34483,jamie2dope,3.84,"Drove to Marty's in Newton Mass to grab a four pack of this stuff today. Have had it twice on tap so far, but never out of the can. Liquid comes spilling forth from the can a pitch black, with a lovely big brown head. It almost looks like the can is spewing this stuff from its mouth. Smell has traces of roasted coffee, earth tones, and a bit of fudge. Flavor is dominated by the roasted coffee, with lots of dark chocolate bitterness in the background. Mouthfeel is slick and thick on the palate. This one seems harsh at first from all the bitterness, but becomes more easy to drink with each sip. All in all, I wouldn't say this is one the top IMP stouts I have had, but certainly enjoyable, and interesting for a number of reasons (the fact that its a can being one of them). Good job to Oscar Blues.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

S - Roasted malts, chocolate, coffee  T - Wow, that is delicious. Dark chocolate, burnt coffee, a slight hop kick, and warming alcohol as it goes down.  M - THICK! This has the mouthfeel of slightly carbonated whole milk. Very smooth.  D - I think 2 would be my limit on this one because of the ABV and the density of this.  I am very impressed by this beer.

(where can i get more?!?!)  I rank this higher than Victory's storm king or rogue's shakespeare stout or north coast's old rasputin to name a few.  It pours perfectly black out of the can, not looking too syrupy. just perfect. the head was a nice tan/brown color that was about 1 finger. Great lacing left all over the glass.  It smells and tastes great! Very roasted, chocolate, slightly caramel. Great hop presence for a stout, with a slightly sweet finish, at least for the first few sips. Great carbonation and not too syrupy, just the perfect consistency.  Overall a great beer, and VERY drinkable for a stout. The 10% was very well hidden. I can confidently say its one of the best stouts i've tried to date, and its out of a can!

2681,34483,jdubjacket,4.48,"Why does Oskar Blues do this to me? They create some of the best beers I've ever had but they're only limited releases. Case in point: Big Poppa Cherry and Ten Fidy.  Picked up a few four-packs of these at Green's on Buford Highway in Atlanta.  I still think it's hilarious to drink IPA's, Scottish Ales, Pale Ales, and now Imperial Stouts from a can.  Poured from a can into a Sweetwater pint glass. Looks like motor oil from a can. It's pitch black and looks delicious.  The aroma is one of dark chocolate, a little bit of coffee and roasted malts.  The taste reflects the smell. The chocolate and coffee undertones are very well balanced.  The mouthfeel is quite exceptional. It's smooth as silk.  The drinkability is outstanding. It goes down smooth, and the alcohol is masked very well. The only issue is the alcohol packs a punch, so it's tought to drink more than one.  Overall, an outstanding brew.

There is a burnt coffee / roasted cashew aroma . Did I tell you I love all of the Oskar Blues brews . Taste is where this is just a hint better than Old Rasputin , Choklat and Brooklyn Black .

2681,34483,Jwale73,4.38,"Served in a standard pint glass (thanks msubulldog25). Can opened with a slight spurt that my dog Sonny was happy to lick up off the adjacent couch. Poured an extremely dark brown with red highlights noticeable when backlit during the pour. Only way I knew it was brown was by looking at the liquid immediately below the rim of foam. Quarter-inch coffee-colored head quickly dissipated into a murky skim of light brown beer algae; plentiful sticky lacing throughout the tasting. Tremendous aromas of chocolate and malt. First sip was truly a beautiful experience. Sweet and chocolatey with a hint of coffee. Silky smooth, full mouthfeel culminated in a slightly astringent alcohol finish, while the fading memory of chocolate and malt lingered until the next sip.

2681,34483,pokesbeerdude,4.4,"Imperial Stout in a can. Had to try it, if for nothing than the sheer comic value.  A: Black, this looks like a black hole in my glass, just a little bit of head, very dark brown, looks like used motor oil. Awesome.  S: A big hit of chocolate, followed by some coffee, some alcohol, kind of a funky fruit smell, and each time I take a drink something new pops out, buttery almost, can't really describe it.  T: Coffee is the first impression, then chocolate, then burnt malts, lingering hop bitterness, but not too much actual hop taste, quite overpowered by everything else. Very tast though, just a little kick of alcohol, definitely has a warming effect.  M: Creamy, filmy, and sticky, very smooth with little carbonation, all in all a very pleasant mouth experience.  D: In no way is this offensive, but it will catch up to ya, quickly that alcohol is a sneaky devil. I'd limit it at one to actually enjoy it, two would be pushing it. Very good brew though!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,SwillBilly,4.75,"Brought back east from my Brother-in-Law in Denver.  Appearance: Pours thick and deep black like used motor oil. Not a bit of light gets through the pitch black stout. A light brown head tops the beer and fades fairly quickly to a thin coating.  Smell: Hints of bittersweet chocolate, over ripe dark fruit, toasted raisin bread. A little alcohol comes through as it warms.  Taste: Starts mildly sweet with dark fruit and chocolate. The middle is where the dark roasted malts make an appearance with a nice roasty bitterness, very smooth until the finish wich is full of roasted malt and a big time hop bite that lingers long after the swallow. Alcohol dangerously hidden in the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel: Thick, luscious, creamy, encompasses the entire mouth, velvety. This is what a big stout should feel like in the mouth.  Drinkability/Notes: Definitely one of the better Impy Stouts I've had in a long while. The malts play a balancing act between fruity and chocolatey sweetness and dark roasted bitterness with the hops playing the encore in the finish with a big dose of hop bitterness. Dangerously drinkable at 10% abv. Fantastic in the mouth with a very good aroma profile. The best beer I've had in a can for sure, but also one of the best Impy Stouts I've had regardless of serving vessel. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on it. Thankfully Oskar Blues will be distributing this beyond Colorado in the near future. Seek and Enjoy.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,joe1510,4.32,"12oz Can  I'm lucky enough to get to try Ten Fidy thanks to my Secret Santa Tayner. Ten Fidy gurgles from the can and appeared like black coffee when poured but black when in the glass. No light peeks through the body. A dark half finger velvety brown head formed on the pour. The head was so dark in fact it appeared to have a purple tint to it. Leaves sheet lacing that eventually cascades into the body.  The smell is big on the roasty side with a hefty dose bittersweet chocolate as well. I'm pretty surprised to find a moderate helping of hazelnut something I don't come across very often in Imperial Stouts. The roastiness is really what dominates though from front to back, everything else is just complimentary.  There is a huge amount of roastiness present. This roastiness kick starts things and is joined mid-palate by slightly bitter coffee grounds. There's a flash of baker's chocolate here and there but as a vein running through the roastiness. The finish brings a slight bitterness from the heavily roasted grains.  The body is lush with a nice velvety texture. There's a touch of heat on the swallow but it's barely noticeable.  This is an easy sipping Imperial Stout that will help keep you warm on a cold Winter's night. It will sneak up on you if you don't take it easy though.  Ten Fidy is a solid Imperial Stout from the guys over at Oskar Blues. They know how to make good beer and this is no exception.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The head is insane. At least three fingers of thick bubbly goodness. It does die down, but this one laces as good as any beer I have ever seen. Add all this up with the fact that is comes in a can....makes it an absolute thing of beauty.  S: Nice roasted aromas with hints of dark coffee, and bitter chocolate. To be honest not the best smelling RIS, but I can't wait to taste.  T: Touchdown! This is a world class brew. The flavors are actually fairly simple and forthright. Tons of dark roasted bitter coffee, with hint of dark chocolate. A tinge of hops can be felt in the end along with a kind of tobacco taste. The taste of this one is not all clouded. It comes straight at you big and bold all chocolate and coffee and I have to say that I love it.  M: Absolutely wonderful. Big and thick and as smooth and creamy as any RIS you will every find. In one word Velvet!  D: No sign of the ABV here. I just wish I had more than one can.  Overall: I reaalllly liked this beer. Nice straightforward flavors that are big and bold like I like them. Add in the touch of hops and you have a masterpiece. Younger35 sent me two others that got lost in the ABYSS between here and Idaho. I would give my left hand to have them right now.

I'm beginning to think that this is all it's cracked up to be. I've been hearing the hype and I am beginning to believe it.  Oh, baby, is this thing smooth! Rich dark chocolate taste without even a sniff of the 10%. This is one dangerous brew! As far as strictly taste goes, this is the best tasting RIS that I've ever had. Simply amazing!

One of two acquired in trade - this one's from Wasatch (credit vwcraig for the other) - thanks, guys.  ""Cross-eyed. Cyclopean. Cancupiscent"" [?]  A: Pours thick and perfectly black, remarkable-looking whether from a can, a bottle or a tap (but from a can is pretty cool). A roil of creamy effervescence builds a sizable puff of a head, nearly two fingers at it's peak, it's toasty orange, the color of cinnamon and graham crackers. And drops v-e-r-y slowly to a goopy film. Lace coats in satiny sheets, slipping a little but eventually gripping in neat bands. Gorgeous and nearly flawless in appearance.  S: Very dark chocolate aroma, burnt grains. A spicy tickle of dark fruit and dried raisins, a little meaty jerky/leather. Modest bitter coffee...I let warm for a long time and never got a huge aroma from it. Pleasant, yes. Captivating - hardly.  T: There's the bittering - wham! Bitter chocolate, espresso coffee, an indiscernible hopping. Sweeter cocoa in the middle. Trace of vanilla. Big flavor, but his one is just very dry and harsh in its sharp/burnt/sooty bittering - maybe my 4.0 is generous.  M: A medium bodied RIS, nothing too thick. That big bittering does grab hold firmly in the middle of the tongue and sticks like peanut butter to the roof of the mouth. Stickier malts stay on the lips. Creamy mouthfeel, unnoticeable carbonation.  D: I do love my Imperial Stouts and this surprised me in that I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. The hype here may be justified, but my personal experience = less than 'wow'. Besides that gorgeous appearance, this fell somewhere in the middle for other categories.

2681,34483,mikesgroove,4.46,"12oz can poured into an Imperial Pint Glass and served at cellar Temperature  A  Poured the thickest darkest oil looking liquid I have ever seen. This stuff literally poured out of the can like it was an oil slick, thick and syrup like and a drop fell on the counter, I thought it would stain forever. A huge four finger high head of thick dark colored foam rose up ever so slowly from the bottom of the glass and almost peaked its head up over the top. It had a nice cascading settling effect that really just added to the whole appearance and made look as though it was really a big time player here. Huge amounts of side glass lace were common here as this was just a monster. I would have to say appearance wise this was just perfect.  S  The aroma was thick, but not too overpowering as to be a put off. The deep dark chocolate was the first wave to hit you and this melded seamlessly into a big splash of roasted coffee. Very dark aromas here in general with hints of caramel and possibly some lactose or vanilla swirling around in there, but the overall heavy feel of this one was just getting itself started.  T  The flavor was huge and very dry even from the first sip. As I started I knew it was going to be big. The first thing I could taste was a nice amount of dark chocolate. Not a ton of it, but enough that there was some in there. This was balanced by some nice coffee like flavors and a ton of dry roasted malts. This was a very dark stout, even for the style. Some nice alcohol warming notes were present as well, and were actual welcomed here as it added some depth. The finish was very dry almost unusually so with a big time drawn out finish. Some subtle hoppiness was present in the finish, however nothing that would let you know that from the start, and in fact it took a good long time for that to even come around. There was another tiny little hint of vanilla in and around a sugary bit at the end, but this was mostly a bitter dry stout.  M  Very very full bodied. This was one of the thickest drinks I have ever had. It had the feel and consistency of an oil milk shake. Very big bodied and very filling this was easily something to cap off the night with. The carbonation was very nice as I would have thought for being so thick that it would have gone flat rather quickly, but this was not the case, it actually had a very nice and creamy consistency and the silk like feeling you can get from tiny carbonation bubbles.  D  This was defiantly a sipper, just due to the shear thickness of it. The alcohol content itself was very well hidden and in fact only trace amounts could really be picked up. This was just so filling there was just no way were you going to be able to take down huge gulps of this.  Overall I really thought this was pretty good. Now I will admit I have had better stouts, but I would say this was still more then decent and really showed off what this brewery can do. I would have to say it is more then deserving of its high ranking and is a nice contrast to a lot of the sweeter stouts I have had as of late. A solid effort and a really nice example definitely go out and get this one.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,JohnGalt1,4.2,"From notes taken Friday night at The Front Door.. Draft into a Chimay goblet.. LOOKS THICK... Creamy brown 3/4"" head... lacing lasts not really long... Aroma is Deep roasted malts and dark chocolate .. dark fruits and significant alcohol. Chocolate covered raisins and roasted barley.. smells great. Flavor is huge lingering roasted malts.. good sweetness.. This brew is thick for sure, but I am sipping and definately not complaining. Coffee and dark chocolate battle it out with the fruity notes.. ultimately it's a draw... chewy... lingers forever... hop bitterness ties perfectly to the black malts.. balanced alcohol and suprisingly smooth.  This in only the 5th time I've had this brew ... twice on tap at the Front Door (those were bourbon aged) ... latter two were from Younger35, Dan truly hooked me up and is an exceptional trader.. I give him the highest regards and suggest any trader check him out.  Edit: Why and the hell can I get Ten Fidy and Gordon (both wood aged) on tap yet not get a can of either in Boise? Distributors aren't giving Boise the credit it deserves ... we ""should"" be able to get them.. damn it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,mentor,4.41,"Pours like motor oil, hard, to get a one finger fine-bubbled dark brown head over a pitch liquid. Smells coffee, some grassiness from hops, chocolate espresso, molasses, with a nice clean alcohol sting. Fruits are present in minimal quantities, more like sawdust from a fresh sweet wood.  Tastes potent roast with a rich milky cream malt sweetness underneath Chocolate-covered coffee bean. Way under is almost a caramel sweetness...something dark and candi-like in that sort of vein...nutty? Drying finish becomes drier in the aftertaste. Grassiness and ashy dark grain character. Amazing they can get hop bitter and grassiness to show amid the intense dark grains.  Md-thick body and creamy smooth silky mouthfeel. Alcohol helps clean the palette. Needs a bit of time for the alcohol sting to settle and the dark grain flavors to blend. Great cellaring potential.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Bitterbill,4.72,"I got this can in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John!  It pours from 12oz can a pitch black with a small and quickly shrinking head of tannish foam.  The smell is roasted malt to the nth degree but I also can get some coffee and some chocolate.  The taste is strong and complex with notes of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and a touch of caramel malt that slightly takes off the edge of the roasty goodness. The body is very thick and chewy and it's carbonation is light. What a sipper!! The finish has a nice hot cocoa kind of bitterness to it that really ends the session on a high note. Wow. I know it's 10%abv and it does give me a slight warming during and after the swallow but that doesn't hurt the drinkability of this RIS much at all. Oskar Blues....you've done it yet again!! My hat's off to you.  Thanks again, John, for including this in our trade!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Vancer,4.34,"Thanks to my secret Santa cartdan for the huge effort to get this for me.  Good grief, this is the blackest pour Ive ever seen in a brew, and Ive seen the Dark One. Even with the 10%, a rich and pillowy tan head, and no sh!t, its sticking to the sides 1/16 thick.  Aroma is a chocolate malt smore, dipped from a dark fruit barrel. Burnt toast coated with raison jam, tangy and not the least bit cloying. An excellent RIS, from a can  thats a huge thumbs up.  Thick and rich body, this one has to have 300 calories in the can  another couple miles to walk tomorrow.  It was worth it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,bennetj17,4.18,"This is the thickest, blackest thing I've ever seen pouring out of an aluminum can. Dark brown foam atop the beer settles into a nice ring. Smells of sweet chocolate and a bourbon-like vanilla note with only mild suggestions of roast. The aroma seems a bit muted, and trying to get more I have to stick my nose far into the glass.  The beer has a strong flavor of dark chocolate, with a hearty bitter and roasted character. Lightly drying, with a hint of cherry in the finish. The alcohol doesn't show itself really. The mouthfeel comes out less chewy than it would appear to be, plus there is decent carbonation which is much appreciated. It coats the palate nicely.  I thought this beer was very good, and quite easy to drink for a heavy stout. It wasn't amazing in it's complexity but it doesn't really have to be. I like the fact that it wasn't too cloying or alcoholic. I would love some more of this, too bad that was my only can...",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ppoitras,3.94,"12oz can obtained via trade with autumnaldave. Thanks for the opportunity...  Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" dark brown (almost purply black) head above the opaque black brew. Head hangs on, with average lace, which actually is pretty good for the style. Aroma is surprisingly minimal, but what is present is the expected dark maltiness with ample hops. Taste starts with sweet darkness, but quickly goes almost acrid bitter, in a good way, then giving way to sharp hoppiness, and closing with gradual warmth. Mouthfeel smooth and creamy, but the acridness does hamper things a bit, and drinkability reflects the same, but still very good overall. I'm really being picky here, but that's just me. Regardless, way kudos for Oskar Blues for continuing to be on the cutting edge on putting new style in the can.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ncvbc,4.25,"Pours a deep dark black. Looks pretty crazy coming from a can. A nice tan head rises from beneath the abyss and rests atop it for a decent amount of time, leaving a little lacing down my glass. Smells of nice roasty malts. Chocolate and an underlying nutty scent. Taste is pretty much the same but not quite as good. Half baked? Sure, I smell some toasted bread. Fully roasted? I'm not so convinced. While this beer definitely has a roasty smell, the flavor isn't quite so bold. It's actually got some sweetness to it. Chocolate, not so dark and more milk chocolate like and again a nutty taste. In the finish you get some roasted coffee grounds. Still, I think it's good. Mouthfeel attempts full bodied but doesn't quite reach it. Velvety smooth with low carbonation, though not as lasting. Drinkability is excellent. While it doesn't have that fully roasted character that it states, this one proves to be a winner. An easy drinking RIS that doesn't show it's high alcohol but doesn't explode on the taste buds at the same time. It was gone before I knew it...  Thanks to tayner for including this in a trade!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Imstillthegman,4.15,"12oz can.  Pours a pitch black with a big, thick looking dark brown head. Nice lacing reminds you what was once there.  The aroma is extremely dark roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, molasses, and this scent that reminds me of caramelized sugar left on the burner a bit too long.  The flavor falls off a bit from the scent. Same characteristics, but not as pronounced. Having had this on-tap before I gotta say the draft version is better...but this is far from bad. There is a toasted nut / burnt oat flavor up front. The coffee is in there, too. Chocolate isn't strong as I thought it would be. Finishes with some charcoal and dark coffee. Nice.  Mouthfeel is not as creamy or full bodied as I had hoped. Some dryness. Very good stout that comes in a can. If you see it on-tap don't pass it up. If someone offers you a can, take it. You won't be disappointed. Another fabulous job by Oskar Blues.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Patchy lacing.  S: Weak bitter coffee is over taken by burnt malts and a sweet molasses character. Just a hint of burnt nuts.  T/M: Burnt malts and burnt brown sugar. Small underlying coffee notes. Hops give a very dry bitterness throughout the entire drink. Feels almost chalky at times. Very dry finish. A touch of alcohol comes in, strengthening in the finish. Full bodied with limited carbonation.  D: Not a bad RIS. Not sure if it lives up to the hype or not.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BeerTruth,4.58,"Thanks to the younger35 for this treat, you're a good man Dan, cheers!  12 oz. can poured into a nonic.  What an amazing looking brew. Complete onyx black with not a single bit of light making its way through. Huge 2.5 finger dark brown thick head with lots of crazy bubbles on top. I have a feeling it's gonna take a while before the head on this one dies down. Stickiness is all over the place on the sides, holds on like molasses. Perfect looking brew, can't say much else. On to the nose. Big chocolate malt and toasted oat up front, almost like an Oatmeal Stout, that's a huge plus in my books. Scents of molasses, brown sugar, roasted barley, caramel malt, and a hint of wheat bread appear as well. Not nearly as smokey as I thought it would be, but my god is this a good smelling beer. Ok, time to take a sip of this monster. First taste I get is smoked almonds, and I love it. Roasted barley and chocolate malt slide over the tongue midway through. French roast coffee flavors in the aftertaste with a hint of charred wood. There is a tiny bit of alcohol on the tongue, but for 10% abv, I'm not complaining. Mouthfeel is huge and creamy with an almost non-existant carbonation. Wow, this beer is incredible. I have two cans left, one I have to age and the other I'm sure I'll drink pretty soon. I'll have to drink the Dark Lord soon to see how they compare.

2681,34483,ColoradoBobs,4.13,"12-ounce can at 12.99 for a four-pack. Is it worth it? We'll see.  Moderate pour into a chalice yields a huge chocolate-brown head over a an opaque black body. Looks oily and thick as it pours. Can't get the whole 12 ounces into this half-liter chalice -- too much head. I little bit of reverse cascading. Lovely, lovely beer.  Smell is chocolate, malt, burnt malt, coffee, pepper, burned raisin bread, molasses, toffee, sweet cherries, charred sugar. Mmmmm. Nice smell, and even better as it warms.  Taste is similar to the smell, only not quite as intense in the chocolate and sweet flavors. Lots of burned flavors. Good, but not quite what I was anticipating from the smell. Just pretty much one note -- the burned-bitter-malt note -- dominates.  Mouthfeel was actually a bit of a let-down. Looked really thick and chewy, but didn't feel that way. There is some thickness here, but not enough.  Drinkability is quite high. I can't detect the alcohol at all. Easy to quaff.  All in all, it's marginally worth $13 for four of these: that's $3.25 apiece.

How cool. The beer is suid ink black with an abnormally dark brown head. Even cooler. Is doesn't get too high or stick around too long but swirling leaves some lacing on the sides.  Smell: Chocolate malt, dark cherry, alcohol, raisin and caramel. The aromas aren't very strong but they are discernable. The beer has almost a fresh, perfume like aroma to it.  Taste: Molasses, heavy black patent malt and chocolate malt, coffe, espresso and raw espresso beans. Earthy tobacco. There is an alcohol presence that stick with you long after swallowing. There isn't much sugar in this beer, like you would think. This beer is certainly a malt bomb. Pretty deep and tasty.  Mouthfeel: Big body and a bitter maltiness that is on the verge of espresso. Moderate booziness and plenty of warmth. Smoothe to swallow, with little carbonation in the mouth. Lingering coffee-bitter finish.  Drinkability: This one is a beast to tackle. It is quite tasty, but I don't think it is as good as some people seem to tout. A better aroma, perhaps with a bit of dark fruit would put this one closer to perfection. Certainly worth obtaining, but not at all costs.

The smell is ok kind of sweet with a bit of char, some espresso but not the kind I like.  The taste is better, chard malt, bits of licorice, coffee and a hint of chocolate.

Slightly sweet aroma dominated by charred black malt.  Big chocolate presence, espresso hint, small note of smoked jerky in the first sips. Hops are there, laying some bitterness over the long roast notes in the finish. A mild sweetness of dusty cocoa is also present. Mild level of astringency attributed to the hop content, and the ninja skills of a 10% abv.  Mouthfeel is creamy and velvety, medium to full, but not sticky or syrupy at all.

Lots of lace as the head finally dissipates. I'm still looking at this beer in amazement.  S - Sweetness that isn't hard to find even with the glass still at the table. There's certainly caramel in the air with this beer. Big coffee smell as well. This is only going to get better as it warms up. I'd like to be wrapped up in this beer as if it were a warm blanket.  T - Sweet up front. Alcohol back bite. There's a fruity aspect of the sweetness that is not the usual citrus you find in many beers. There's also a bitterness that is not your typical hops. All is very good, but difficult to identify.  M - Smooth and thick, almost syrup-y. Not surprising considering the appearance. Definitely a heavy bodied beer.  D - I'm happy I have more in the fridge, but I think I'll have to savor them for a later date. I will cherish this beer.

2681,34483,younger35,4.45,"Received this little guy in a trade with Domingo. This will be my second go around with Ten Fidy as the first was the Bourbon Barrel Aged Ten Fidy on tap. Drank from my Rogue Kells Irish Lager pint glass.  Appearance- When you pour this bad boy out of its can you almost need a rubber spatula to get it all out. Thick as tar and just as black, it forms a nice fluffy one finger head that recedes slowly leaving a spotty cap and thin collar. Light spotty lacing is also present. Smell- Loads of chocolate and caramel leave this bad boy smelling more like a fancy desert than a beer. Soft rum and vanilla show through leaving a barrel aged like smell. Lots of espresso and a soft dark cherry are also present. Taste- The roasted malt dominates this (as youd expect) and is loaded with chocolate and French roast. There is a very sweet vanilla like character to this brew as well. This is all balanced nicely with a subtle citrus bite from the hops. Finishes with a lingering sweetness and a bit of alcohol. Mouthfeel- As thick in my mouth as it looked in the glass. Smooth and velvety with a bit of carbonation but not much. Drinkability- Well for having a 10% ABV, Id say this bad boy is about as drinkable as its going to get. I dont remember it being this thick but damn, it is!

Aromas of chocolate, coffee, caramel, and raisins; along with some higher alcohol waft from the glass. Flavor is a blend of roast and chocolate with some licorice as well. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and full - very nice.  Overall, another solid offering from OB.

2681,34483,RoBotGod,5,"This might be one of the thickest beers Ive ever drank. When I opened it out of the can I almost thought it was flat and then a dark brown head formed. It had that raw coffee smell with a little of black liquorish mixed in. It drank like a chocolate malt. It taste like dark chocolate and a little hazelnut to it. I m not sure how it would age in a can, but this would be great sitting it down for about 2 years. It was the best beer Ive ever had in a can, period.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Domingo,4.17,"You've got to love an imperial stout in a can. Pours a murky brown/block color. Not the darkest I've seen, but there's no doubt about what style it is immediately. Forms a salt and pepper brown/white head that arrives without need of an aggressive pour. Lacing? Yup - it sticks around like sugar. Smell is of roasted coffee, cocoa, dark bread baking, almonds, and a little sweetness from the citrus-like hops. The initial flavor starts as a little sweet, but becomes dry with a strong roast flavor. I tend to like my imperials a little bit sweeter, BUT this is the best of the drier ones. The strongest flavors are espresso and roasted nuts, but this brew actually does have some hops...which you would probably expect from Oskar Blues. Mouthfeel is typical for the style, and fits nicely in the middle of the ultra thick offerings (like Abyss) and thinner ones (like Storm King or Yeti). I actually like my imperials a little thinner, so this works for me. Drinkability is actually not that bad. I finished one and probably could've cracked another an hour later. I recommend actually drinking this one chilled at first so you can see how the beer gets drier and more potent as it warms. That's actually somewhat unique.  The one thing that has to be mentioned is price. A 4-pack of this is $12. That's more than pretty much any other imperial stout on the market ($ per Oz). Is it worth it? Maybe, but it's a tough call. It's a wonderful beer, and there's something really nice about having a killer beer and the convenience of a can. It's another big success from OB, but that price is a knock on it.  EDIT: Recent cannings of this have been much more aligned to my personal tastes. The most recent I had (#4, canned in 12/08) was unbelievably malty and the roastiness had been toned down to work as a balancing element. It was every bit as good as any other RIS on the market. Another new wrinkle is that the price has been dropped to $8 for a 4-pack. That's essentially the same price as offerings from Stone, Great Divide, Founders, etc. Ten Fidy has gone from being good to wonderful, but I'll keep my original scores up there just for reference.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

However, with every swirl of the glass brings a reddish, brown tinted head. Once this one warmed up I could smell some Molasses, and sugar with some strong roasted coffee scent. Honey and toffee are also present. Delicious rich, dark coffee flavor that is intially sweet, then a heavy bitter finish lingers on the tongue.

2681,34483,rye726,4.6,"12oz Can poured at 45F into a goblet.  This is a very sound looking beer. Pitch black with no presence of light. Dark brown head which seems to be characteristic of some of the finest brews in the world.  The nose is very dark and roasty. There are so many good aromas here. I sense a smoky sweetness accompanied by piney and floral hops. There are also hints of vanilla, chocolate, espresso and ripe berries.  The taste is as complex as the smell. A very full body and thick mouthfeel, but still quite drinkable. There are so many flavors going on here with nothing out of balance. It is strong of roasted or nearly burnt espresso and chocolate. The fruitiness is powered by cherries, plums and berries. There is the nice piney and floral hop character that balances out the sweet flavors. Slight notes of caramel, butterscotch, molasses and vanilla round everything out. A very good beer that stands up against some of the best imperial stouts around.  On another note, the use of cans by Surly and Oskar Blues is pure genius. Cans prevent spoiling from light, are durable, portable, crushable and more environmentally friendly than bottles. Glass was first manufactured in 3000 BC, support the canning revolution.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,blakesell,4.33,"Thanks to Mcallister for sharing this fine can with me.  Poured from 12oz can into a plastic tasting vessel, (yes, I know, plastic, but it is odorless. If you hate me for it, I'm not too hard to hunt down and stab and/or shoot).  Appearance- Pours black like my soul, a solid brown head, dissapates fairly quickly to splotchy that fades into an oil slick on the top.  Smell- Dark roasty malts, chocolate, fig, prune, coffee, a bit of toffee, and black licorice. Hops are subdued but there is something else in there that I can't quite place my finger upon.  Taste- Chocolate, coffee, cocoa, fig, dates, brown sugar, glucose, black licorice, motor oil, twigs? Only after taking a sip of water and coming back to it do I realize what that other missing flavor is from various scotch tastings. Peat malt is in here as well. A strange flavor to find in your RIS indeed.  Mouthfeel- Gluey, thick, excellent carbonation, warming, and very full-bodied.  Drinkability- Oh my god yes! I could drink this baby all day. Sadly, this just wasn't meant to be, but Ten Fidy, I will always fondly remember the times we had. The opening, the smelling, the drinking. I hope we can have those days again. But now you are gone. And I will have to live with that until our paths cross again. Or your burbon aged sister comes over to visit.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,LittleBreeze,4.17,"11/4/2007 Thanks drseamus. Pitch black. Creamy almost intrusive mud colored head.  Smell was ""dark"" earthy. Lots of coffee, roasted malt and chocolate. Hints of smoke.  This is an outstanding beer. So many simply flavors creating a complex treat. It is thick...oily.  Exceptional beer experience.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,BlindPig,4.68,"A- Nice creamy dark mocha 1-2"" head on a bitch black body. It is weird seeing such a thick black stout being poured out of a can. S- Sweet chocolate malt, hints of dark fruits, light burnt grains, grass hops, light citrus parts, light smoke, and coffee. T- Blend of coffee, chocolate, sweet caramel, burnt grains, some smoke, hints of citrus, hints of dark fruits, and some grass. The bitter malt and hops linger in the mouth with a light warming from alcohol and some burnt notes. M- Nice thick chewy body with a creamy smoothness to it. Leaves a really big dry note. D- I think this is a great beer. I would try finding this again and thank you to Franksnbeans for this in a great thank you package.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Dansting,4.43,"Can. Poured a murky dark brown/black color with a medium brown head. Strong lacing. Strong aroma of dark, roasted malt. Mouthfeel is awesome. Flavor is rich and roasted-malty. Strong aftertaste of coffee. This is an amazing beer. Glad I got my hands on some.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,kirok1999,4.25,"I'm used to a can fizzing when you pop the top. No such activity here. Now I have to get used to pouring from a can again. Seems easy...put can to glass, tip can, pour beer. I tried a gentle pour and put the opening too close to the rim and spilled a bit down the side. How the hell hard can it be to pour a beer?! Dense black in the glass with a thin brown head. Laces pretty nicely. Smell is all dark chocolate and coffee. Some slight hints of raisin and other fruits. Taste is massive and dark. Chocolate is first, like cake batter, followed by the coffee and a thin note of dark fruit. Alcohol is well hidden by the depth of taste. A nice bitter chocolate aftertaste hangs around quite a while. Feels thick and rich. A nice winter sipper on a cool night, very welcome and inviting.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,WeisGuy,4.3,"Big thanks to ArrogantB for this can.  a - pour viscous and black as night, big dark tan head with retention around the edges and good lacing  s - very strong aroma as soon as the can is opened, deep roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate dominate, slight hoppiness in there with hints of alcohol  t - big burnt malt flavor up front with the mid-palate dominated by bittersweet chocolate, some bright hops in the background, finish is pretty bitter with alcohol notes  m - full-bodied, medium carbonation, coats the palate pretty well, very dry finish, nice warming  d - very good beer, but it wears out the palate with the bitter dry finish, alcohol is there but not overwhelming  Very good beer all around. For some reason, the first few drinks were phenomenal and after that, the flavors started to get a little muddled. Not quite on the level of the ""elite"" Impy stouts (ie Dark Lord, The Abyss, KY Breakfast, Speedway), but not far behind. Well worth seeking a can or two of this out.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,drseamus,4.33,"Just like a RIS should look. Jet black body with a thich dark mocha head. It seems pretty rare to see a head like this on a beer with this much ABV. It also looks wrong to pour a beer this dark from a can. It literally looks like oil pouring from a can.  Tons of chocolate, tons of coffee, and tons of roasted malt. It is pretty sweet smelling in both the literal and metaphorical senses. There is another aroma in there that I think might be maple syrup but I can't be sure.  BAM!!! Huge flavor blasts from this one. It is slightly bitter and the primary flavor is dark chocolate. It reminds me of those 90% cocoa chocolate bars. There is some coffee hiding in the background and it is pretty smooth.  The body isn't as heavy as it sounds but it's still on the heavier side. This is a great beer and I'm glad they finally decided to can it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,mcallister,4.2,"This is a black stallion of a beer and damn near perfect. Midnight colored with a creamy thick mocha tan head with sparse bubbles that molten here and there that fades modestly into a layer that sits upon this heavanly elixir.  Complexity is what comes to mind upon the first smell. Smokey hints with roasty afterthoughts, with a very gamey feel. Black licorice, rye bread, used motor oil, earth, burnt caramel, old coffee, and other black fruits, round out the nose with a touch of mollasses. New aromas pop up here and there.  Very bitter tannic coffee notes on the finish, which I will add is quite long. Again very roasty in flavor which actually seems to drown out many of the flavors. Some anise and burnt caramel, with a hint of dark chocolate. Thick, creamy rich delectable mouthfeel. Smokey and earthy and huge. A beer that I think could use some time, but how will time in a can deter the aging process?",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,franksnbeans,4.53,"Looks just awesome glugging out like pitch black motor oil out of a can. Big chocolate milk head that goes absolutely nowhere. Smells very roasty, little chocolate and coffee. Taste is huge on roast, coffee grounds and a hint of chocolate. Perfect bitter finish. A little thin in the mouth making this feel almost like a porter. Insane drinkability, I dont see how this is 10% ABV. A must try.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,DaPeculierDane,3.86,"Many thanks to xmarcnolanx for trading this to me. It's surprisingly fun to watch a jet black and oily beer with a mega huge brown head pour from a can. Truly. Ten Fiddy's appearance is nearly unbeatable. Carbonation is relatively light but the head remains an inch or more thick for several minutes before coming to rest at about a 1/4 inch. Aroma is deeply roasted with faint cherry and vanilla notes. Caramel malt is also present in the aroma but coffee and chocolate are both mysteriously absent. The flavor changes things up a bit as that intense roasted malt character leans towards coffee. I emphasize leans because coffee character in this beer is subtle at best. Chocolate too is minimal if present at all in the taste. Again , however, cherry is quite pronounced with some vanilla as well. Creamy is an understatement as to mouthfeel. As stated, carbonation level is low, and the bubbles that are around just seem to roll of the tongue. Nice bitterness in the finish. Extremely smooth, creamy, and luscious. Not as depthful as I would like and lacking a couple of those key RIS atributes, but...this is still a wonderful beer. It's so easy to drink, looks and feels great, and taste pretty decent. If this becomes available around here I could see picking up a 4-pack with some regularity.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,shivtim,4.01,"Had this one at the Brick Store. Served in a chalice. Deep black with maybe the slightest brown highlights, and a dense, creamy, lasting brown head. Looks spectacular. Nose is heavily roasted malts, sweet and sugary, with bits of cocoa. Taste is a heavy fire-burnt malts implosion, some sweet dark chocolate, and alcohol on the finish. Mouthfeel is great; very full and foamy. Drinkability is about average; this one is a sipper. Definitely recommended for those of you who love a toasted malt-bomb of a beer.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,seaoflament,4.21,"Thanks to Oxymoron for the trade!  One of the darkest pours I have seen.  Subtle coffee, more chocolate malts and some grain aromas. A bit of alcohol heat hiding behind the malt. As it warms up there is a bit more sweet chocolate, cherry, and some toasted qualities. This stout smells dry, somewhat like cocoa powder.  Taste begins with coffee, chocolate, roasted barley and some bitterness in the finish. I was a bit disappointed at first as I was expecting something bigger but it really improves with a few degrees warmer. Lots of roasted malt flavors, it's a big malt beer.  Mouthfeel is good to very good. Really? 10% alcohol? Didn't even notice it until I checked; it is dangerously drinkable.  Turned out to be a delicious Imperial Stout, great roasted and chocolate malt profile.  ---update 10/15/09--- Ten Fidy at about 2yrs old. This can is from the first canned release back in Oct. 2007  The color of this beer is just as impressive as the first time, deep black used motor oil color with a creamy inch of foam that has a color between mocha and rusty copper. The head sinks down fairly quickly to a thick ring and maintains throughout the drinking session. (4)  Milk chocolate aromas, softly roasted grains, hints of vanilla, chocolate graham cracker, and fruity esters. Brown sugar coated raisins and plums combine with a rich chocolate aroma. The burnt and almost charred character of the beer when fresh has definitely toned down. Hints of cocoa and a bit ""meaty."" Reminds me a bit of chocolate oatmeal. Later on it takes on a vanilla flavored bread, almost like a vanilla pound cake. (4.5)  Smooth roasted flavors upfront, intense toast, soft chocolate, cocoa, a bit of graininess, and a finish of raisins and plums. I do get a little bit of alcohol in the finish but extremely well hidden throughout. A bit of a smoky flavor in the finish. As it warms up the roasted bitterness becomes more apparent in the finish and helps balance out the beer but it's not a sweet beer at all. Good attenuation gives a dry finish with just the right amount of sweetness and then the roasted grains take over in the finish. Light roasted coffee flavor in the finish and aftertaste. Definitely a richer coffee and roasted flavor as it gets above cellar temp. I'm also tasting some toasted almonds in the last 4oz of the beer. Pretty darn good. (4)  Smooth and creamy with a low amount of carbonation that's just enough to lift the beer from the palate. Heavy and full bodied but easy drinking. (4)  Doesn't seem like much has changed with being aged 2 years, the aroma and flavors certainly mellowed out and I really liked the aroma, but I think this one is still going strong.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ERASE21,3.43,Got a can from a friend who bought one of the last cases from the brewery. I was exited. Love the silver can with the simple one color black print. Smelled like cappuccino and chocolate hiding behind fresh cream. Tasted the same but the first aftertaste was home-brewed coffee that had been sitting in the pot all day. Final thoughts - burnt buttered popcorn that you can't stop eating.,Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Beaver13,4.03,"12 oz can. Pours a thick opaque black with a creamy dark brown head (after a vigorous pour) that recedes to a thin film that leaves some lacing.  The aroma is a little subdued compared to on draft - sweet lactic chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, and a little vinous fruitiness.  The flavor is roasted chocolate malts, coffee and black licorice with a little dark fruit sour twang. It has a decent roasted bitter finish. The alcohol is well hidden. The mouthfeel is medium to full and a little watery.  Overall, an excellent impy stout. It was even better on tap though.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,ArrogantB,4.27,"I have had this beer exactly one time before which was on tap at the brewpub. This is straight from the new can which is mostly black and silver, Raiders colors, not fucking cool. The beer really looks like oil pouring from the can. The head was dark brown and the beer was obviously pitch black. The smell is excellent, roasty dark chocolates maybe a coffee bean as well and powdered cocoa. The taste is very nice, oaty for some reason, burnt, the smell is the best part. This stuff is definitely strong but i can not get over how good it smells. Buy this when you see it.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,drumrboy22,4.4,"Tasted on tap at the brewery in Lyons, CO.  Pours all black with a small, dark brown head. Good lacing around the edges, with a light carbonation.  Aroma was espresso, chocolate and moderate alcohol. Taste was awesome. Strong and fairly sweet, with some oak flavor and vanilla present. Finish was slightly bitter and long.  Amazing beer. Highly recommended.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
2681,34483,Damian,3.57,"Drank on-tap at Sunset Grill & Tap, Allston, MA  Poured an opaque pitch black with no head. A resilient, coffee-colored ring of lace clung to the edge of the liquid and left small droplets of lacing along the glass.  The aroma was rich and roasty. Bittersweet chocolate, roasted malts and black coffee came through strong along with subtle hints of brown sugar.  The taste was far darker and roastier than the nose. Intensely charred malts were apparent up front along with a noticeable rummy alcohol quality that became more intense as it moved along the palate. (The roast character of this beer was really over the top.) Bitter espresso notes came through strong mid-palate, along with super minty and citrusy hops that crescendoed into the palate shredding finish. Like the finish, the aftertaste was outrageously hoppy and puckeringly bitter. I felt like the hop bitterness was going to linger on forever.  As for body, the beer was thick and rather chewy with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a fine, mild carbonation.  Drinkability was moderate. While this beer was quite good in some aspects, I found the combination of deep, charred roastiness, alcohol sharpness and intense hoppiness to be quite overwhelming.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

The smell featured an upfront sweet caramel with background noted of coffee, dark chocolate and smoke.  The flavor consisted of a rich burnt grain with sweet malts, coffee and cocoa. Some good dark fruits detected as well.  The mouthfeel was very heavy and chewy with a slight warming alcohol.  Overall a very tasty RIS.

2681,34483,CharlesDarwin,4.1,"Originally reviewed on March 21, 2007. On draft at the brewpub and from a fresh growler. Nice somber cherry and wicking Cascade aroma, over creamy pine malt. Lots of dusky hops present in the aroma. Pour is a weird milky brown soap, with the darkest brown heap Ive ever seen! Flavor is a sweep of mid-roasted malts, lots of nuts, toasted caramels, sweet orange candies and fat almonds. Mingling of dry malt and high hops works surprisingly well. Palate and smack are most impressive. A smooth, quenchable pour, with nice attenuation and astounding drinakbility amongst a deftly concealed 9.4%. Dry, yet fulfilling smack, with quafs of light crisp piney grass over an effervescent nut oil character. Pecan skins and cherry pits lingering in the higher alcohols that rise to the nostrils. Well-balanced, however somewhat middle-of-the-road, somehow. It doesnt have a singular, unique character, aside from its entire build, that makes it a unique Imperial Stout. However, its beautifully built and brewed and certainly the most drinkable of ANY Imperial Stout. This strays from the classic sippers of the style to a near sessionable big beer. Mightly delicious.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Roasted malt, coffee, toffee, some dark chocolate, dark soft fruit, raisins...perhaps a bit of caramel. Taste; one of the best RIS I've had. Those aromas melt well into the taste.

2681,34483,jeffbearer,5,"I don't often review beers on BA, often because I can't say something that hasn't already been said for me. But I just can't let Ten Fidy go by without saluting it.  Ten Fidy pours jet black with a coca colored head. Aroma is full of Roast, Coca, and Dark Fruit, Flavor washes your senses with roast, coffee, rasins and prunes. The alcohol is present as it is in all my favorite imperial stouts, but it is not obtrusive, subtle actually when you consider that it is 10% ABV. Superbly drinkable this beer could get you into trouble if you are not paying attention.  Comparing this beer to others in the style I have to put it at the top, de-throning others such as Avery's Czar, Bell's Expedition, and Old Rasputin. Even the perennial #2 beer can take some lessons away from Ten Fidy.  I don't want to rate this beer perfect, but I can't mark it down in any of the categories in good conscience. At $8 for 12 ounces that is a bit steep, but I'll gladly pay for a couple of snifters full to revisit this gem every winter.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Nice thick lace that clings to the side of the glass.  Smell: Burnt malt, espresso, slight alcohol.  Taste: The first thing I taste is the huge chocolate malts followed by the dry oak. I also taste a cordial liquor, maybe brandy? This beer has a nice balanced sweetness with a slightly harsh espresso finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy in body. Very light carbonation. A little warming in the finish.  Drinkability: Occasional, This is a perfect example of a Russian Imperial Stout!

2681,34483,ddarden,4.5,"Had this on tap at the Brick Store in Decatur GA over lunch. Served in a 10oz tulip glass (I believe). It was completely black with no light penetrating this bad boy and a beautiful chocolate colored head that sat around a while. The smell was a very rich roasted dark malt, chocolate, java, pepper and hops. The hops had a hard time muscling past the malt side of this beer though.  The first sip was thick and follows through with the smell. Dark roasted malt and coffee. The chocolate comes in the middle and finished with bitter from the hops. The alcohol warming is almost completely hidden and well done. Also, there is oak and cherries hidden just beneath the surface of this beer. They are not strong flavors, but very subtle. The coffee flavor starts to overrun the more subtle flavors of the beer as I finish it up.  The mouthfeel is viscous and chewy. Just what I like in an RIS. I could definitely have had more than one of these with the exception that I was there for lunch. Excellent beer and one of the best RIS I have tried. Worth seeking out!",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

Tastes of bittersweet chocolate, alcohol, roasted coffee, and bitter citrus peel. Finish is bone dry and bitter with a medium alcohol burn on the tongue and throat.

2681,34483,hoppymeal,4.11,"Pours a dark black, thick, with a pumpkin pie colored thick head that slowly recedes. A nice bourbony alcohol aroma, some swirling produces a ripe fruitiness, cherries, with a mild chocolate in the background. Roastiness come through much stronger in the taste, silky and smooth chocolate slides behind the acidic roasty tanginess. The roastiness hits up front then briefly subsides to the sweet and soft chocolate maltiness, then comes back stronger and smokier in the finish and blends with a burnt bitter hoppiness in a drying finish. A small amount of alcohol hits the back of the throat and gives a nice warming feeling. Definitely big in body, this beer is fairly thick and chewy, but is also cut nicely by the alcohol as well as a very good amount of hop bitterness. If only this beer were available in bottles it would be a great cellar candidate with these big hoppy qualities and alc content but it drinks very well fresh.

2681,34483,bigman147,4.45,"Counter pressure filled bottle from Beer tade:  Appearance: Pours very rich and thick black. Head is very dense and is deep orangish brown. As some have mentioned, it looks like espresso in the glass.  Aroma: Sweet dark fruit aromas which are balanced by a pleasant coffee and slight toffee note. A hint of citrus hops which help bring out the sweetness.  Taste: The taste is like that of lightly sweetened coffee. There is a thickness and syrupy quality that is mouth coating. Roasted malts and slight burnt black malt flavors. Minimal chocolate flavors come out. Alcohol is present but hidden by the thick syrupy nature of this beer.  Mouthfeel: As I have already stated, this is very thick and syrupy. Not cloyingly sweet. Its heavy and the coffee bitterness is lingering and slightly drying.  Drinkability: Like most beers in this style, it lacks drinkability in that I could not see having more than one of these in an evening. The alcohol is present and also makes this less sessionable.

Pitch black body with a dark chocolate head. 1"" thick to start and then reduced to a quarter inch which held on 'til the bottom. Beautiful lacing.  Aroma is of dark toffee and milk chocolate with a touch of caramel sweetness. I dont seem to be as into the aroma as others, I found it kinda light overall.  Big roasted body with toffee and milk chocolate again. Finishes with a bit of expresso and some char. A touch of biting alcohol and harshness after the swallow. Very good though.

I love the name and it happened to remind me of one of my favorite imperial stouts from Southern Tier their IS from the long long ago Blackwater Series. Appearance is opaque literally black eats all light with a two fingered sized dark moccha tan head leaving behind fine lacing unevenly around the glass. Aroma is full of deep dark chocolate mild butterscotch undertones, cocoa, and an espresso coffee barrage. Other subtle notes found were some soft edges a touch of vanilla and oat grains maybe some molassess and the herbal pine hop bite definitely expresses itself with a bang. The flavor brings huge hop bitterness among waves of dark roast espresso bursts, dark chocolate, herbal pine hop flavors and succulently sweet butterscotch, molasses, and oatmeal with vanilla notes. Huge impy stout worthy of any hype this low distributed beer may bring, I hope it makes it on the canning line. Mouthfeel is huge engulfs the palate even slow chugging carbonation barely can handle all this malt with a sticky mildly chewy character about it also noted were some streaks of hop oils.

The aroma is apparent right off the bat, coffee, chocolate, all the usuals of the stout. The taste was awsome, and very much like it smelled. A bit of an alchohol bite but nothing too much.  I'm not an expert on imperial stouts, but this one was incredible. I only hope I can enjoy this one again sometime.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97

This is a truly pitch black liquid. The head looks like a dark chocolate milk cloud floating on the coal dark sea of beer on this one. I lean in for a sniff and am greeted with loads of chocolate, toffee, and espresso over a lurking bit of grapefruit hops. I take a sip and am shocked not by the flavor, which was precisely what the aroma had suggested, but by the mouthfeel, which was more like whole milk or a thin chocolate malt than a beer. A truly creamy mouthfeel, yet this wasnt cloyingly sweet. This was heaven.",Oskar Blues Grill & Brew,"Colorado, United States",American Imperial Stout,97
