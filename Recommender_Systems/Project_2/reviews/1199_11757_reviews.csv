1199,11757,travis1108,4.71,My favorite founders. Goes down smooth with just a hint of warmth (alcohol) on the finish. Rich dark and chocolatey. Really easy to overindulge on this one!,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,kflorence,4.84,"Pours an opaque black with a creamy finger thick light brown head which lasts for quite some time. Plenty of lacing as you drink. Carbonation looks average and more on the sudsy side with smaller bubbles (my fav). With a little bit more head retention this would be perfect. It's a beautiful beer on the pour.  Lots of coffee and cacao on the nose with a hint of brown sugar and an excellent floral hop background. A touch of alcohol as well. Excellent.  Taste is very in line with the aroma. Lots of burnt malts, espresso and cacao up front with spicy, floral and pine hoppiness coming through as it sits on the tongue. Bitter toasted cacao nibs after the swallow, along with some burnt oak notes. Very rich and ultimately bitter but with subtle sweetness to balance it out. Love the hop presence which makes itself known but kind of stays out of the way. A true pleasure.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of body. Very creamy and smooth with subtle carbonation. Highly drinkable at 8.3% ABV. A bit of a tongue coater with a little bit if a syrupy feel after the swallow which I think is spot on for the style.  I love a good oatmeal stout and this is one of the best I've ever had, right up there with Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout. I'd have to do another review of both side by side to truly compare as I originally reviewed that one quite a long time ago. Needless to say, this is a pleasure to drink and a must have if you're a fan of the style. Surprised it took me so long. Cheers!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,thedad57,4.86,"This is one of my favorite beers. Everything from the time it’s poured to the last drink, this beer only gets better. Mouth feel, poured head (great color), nose, color are all exactly what a fella wants from a stout. I was also pleasantly surprised to find this beer at Saltgrass Steakhouses!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Martin194,4.46,"Look: Opaque black with a light brown head.  Smell: Dark chocolate, coffee, maybe some brown sugar? Lots of bitter and sweet.  Taste: Follows smell, leans toward the bitter side; espresso and earthy hops alongside the sweeter undertones.  Feel: Medium full body, normal carbonation, leaves a dry, bitter mouthfeel.  Overall: Excellent stout!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,jbolger,4.54,"1/23/23 This could be the perfect stout. Chocolate, espresso, malt & hops in perfect harmony. Delicious.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,pulse,4.24,"Quite black with a short, tan head. Small amount lingering. Very roasty aroma with scents of coffee and chocolate. Taste is rich, a blend of coffee and chocolate. Pleasant bitterness, fullness. Small amount of sweetness. Very smooth, silken, delicious. Could be breakfast, could be dessert. Both would be great. It is reminiscent of a coffee drink, like a mochachino or whatever the right goofy name is. It is strong and toasty, almost burned. Mild to modernate carbonation, very well-balanced.  This was a 4-pack gift for Christmas. I always meant to pick this one up, since it's very affordable for the quality, but never found the time. It's a Founders stout, so you know what you're getting.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,TooManyGlasses,4.34,"Not sure how I have not reviewed this before - had many times and always a treat. Pours clear black with slight reddish highlights and two fingers of mocha head. Aroma of roast coffee, dark chocolate, chocolate cake. Tastes of espresso - slightly bitter coffee, dark chocolate, hint of vanilla, a bit of earthy hops. Smooth full mouthfeel with a lingering bittersweet finish. Simple and superb.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,thin_mint,4.74,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Look: near black with a nice tan head. Smell: dark chocolate and roasted coffee. Smells like dessert! Taste: much like the smell - bitter dark chocolate with a nice mocha finish. Hops are present and well balanced with the other flavors. Feel: smooth, creamy, rich. Really nice balance with the carbonation. Overall: this is a great example of an oatmeal stout. Smooth, roasty, chocolaty. Like a high powered cold brew mocha tempered with the smooth creaminess of oats. Fairly moderate alcohol content, but its really well hidden. I don't know about breakfast, but this is a perfect dessert.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Neelbeer,4.35,"Look: very black, sizable head, recedes slowly (regenerates a little with swirling) Smell: This is my second bottle (not in one day); milk and coffee, but for some reason this second 12 oz bottle has a definite olive smell to me (is it an off flavor from the coffee or from malt? not sure); slightly sweet chocolate, burnt smores Taste: More bitterness than you'd expect (mine was bottled two weeks ago); expresso and cappuccino, chocolate, bonfire, finishes bittersweet; I do get that strange olive thing (tried it the next day, seems to have been a fluke); toasted oats, delicious milky froth Feel: Creamy, but I like it even thicker; it's kind of a coffee stout/ oatmeal stout cross Overall: It's quite delicious, though I think I was expecting something smoother. Don't drink on an empty stomach; the alcohol really creeps up on you! Great with dessert, like fried bananas",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,dano213,4.4,"12oz bottle purchased off the shelf from my local grocery store as a single for $2.99. Bottled on 09.15.22, so this is just over three months old.  Look: Pours a rich, very dark brown bordering on black. There is a nice light brown colored head with very fine bubbles that is about an eight of a finger tall. The head regenerates nicely after swirling the glass. It looks very nice.  Smell: The aromas of this beer are laden with chocolate and coffee. It's all the spectrums of chocolate - from lighter cocoa powder to rich, dark baker's chocolate. And there's a constant coffee note that expresses a bit of sweetness as well as a bit of fruity acidity. Some earthy hop notes after swirling the glass. I feel like there are some subtle dark fruit aromas like dark dried cherries that are trying to make their way through the mocha madness. Smells very nice.  Taste: It's really delicious. Very drinkable also. The taste basically mirrors the nose. Up front, it's rich chocolate and coffee that have some sweetness but are overall dry. The finish is dry with bitter, astringent coffee roast along with bitter chocolate malts and roasted barley malts. The finish lingers long. Even though this beer is very dark and bitter, it drinks like a dessert within a glass. I also like that there is some hop expression in this oatmeal stout, but not so much that the beer would be considered ""hoppy.""  Feel: The mouthfeel is nice, it has a smooth, velvety, silky texture. It's medium to full bodied. Soft, gentle carbonation at just the right level.  Overall: It's hard to believe that I have never had this before. Of course, I have had Founder's KBS before yet I guess that I had not been aware of nearly as much hype around this beer. It's a really delicious, drinkable oatmeal stout with tons of chocolate and coffee flavor. It's not sweet, yet could skip dessert and just drink this beer because it's deliciously full, rich, and decadent.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,AzfromOz,4.43,"Received in a proxy/trade hybrid from @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in November of that year.  L: It looks like a stout. It's jet black. There's a coffee-coloured collar of foam. What can I say - it looks like it's meant to look!  S: The aroma is bitter chocolate, milky coffee, and burnt charcoal. That burnt note is really enticing and took me a while to work out what it was.  T: That burnt, bitter note comes through in the taste. It's like sticking your nose into a cooling, coal-fired bbq (a Webber briquette kettle bbq for the Aussies out there). The bitter note combines with burnt chocolate and a hint of coffee and comes out creamy and moreish. This is really enjoyable!  M: Mouthfeel is smooth and silky but there's also a moderate amount of carbonation that rounds the mouthfeel out perfectly.  O: This is an excellent beer! It hides its 8.5% ABV really well and belongs firmly in that Belgian category of strong beers that trick you into thinking otherwise. I want another one, but I'm not going to do that to myself just now!  Cheers! #148",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Hooded,4.36,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Pint glass. Appearance is dark brown and almost black with 3 fingers of tan head. Retention is very good. Smell is somewhat above medium. It smells like great strong coffee, a hint of chocolate and spicy hops. Taste is medium-high in strength. It tastes like strong black coffee, some dark chocolate, a little caramel and a long moderately bitter hop finish. There's a little warming from the 8.3% ABV. Feel is thick, very velvety and quite creamy. Carbonation and astringency are low. Overall, it's an outstanding beer with world class qualities. The aroma and velvety mouth feel are enough to get me to purchase it again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Parmesan,4.5,"L: Pours a dark black brown with a small tan head and a little lacing on the glass.  S: A strong earthy coffee, mixes with a nice hint of chocolate.  T: Earthy rich coffee, mixes roasted malt and some bittersweet chocolate.  F: Smooth and larger body.  O: This beer is a classic stout and always enjoyable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,crazyspicychef,2.96,"My least favorite oatmeal stout I've had. It's probably the coffee I dislike. I hate coffee in beer! I get it, the whole breakfast thing, probably good they didn't put eggs in it & dry hop it with bacon. Smells delicious, looks delicious, taste not delicious. I will not be drinking this one again. Not my kind of beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Mainehawk,4.23,Poured from the usual bottle- dated 08/19/22- consuming on 10/9/22. Minimal head…not the firm head seen with Guinness. Great dark chocolate color. Smells of coffee and chocolate- no real oatmeal taste was evident.  Goes down easy- shocked to see the 8.3% ABV. Not bitter. No hop signature. Very rich and smooth. Very enjoyable. Breakfast? Maybe at deer camp.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,German-Helles,4.54,"I poured a 12oz. bottle into a 20oz. weizen glass and have ended up with two fingers of beautiful, frothy, dark tan foam. It slowly recedes but does not disappear as advertised! Typical stout look, very dark, one could say black. There is very thick lacing left all the way down the glass as I consume this one. The aroma is malt first, sweet chocolate, and a little of coffee. The sip offers a bit of sweetness, then it is quickly covered with the roasted coffee bitter bite and a bit dry to the finish. There is not an alcohol bite here, but this one is a belly warmer. This is very thick creamy stuff with very light carbonation. Good stuff, I do not take much time between sips, this one keeps calling me back. Be careful, at 8.3ABV this bowl of oatmeal may sneak up on you!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,DrOfGolf,4.5,"Yay!! Finally got a chance to taste this one.  Poured a blackish-brown color with a small head that quickly dissipates. The smell was of coffee and chocolate. The taste was of very strong coffee and chocolate, but mostly coffee. Definitely a good morning starter.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,IvoryBilledWoodpecker,4,"Moderately sized head when poured bottle to glass, dissipates but remains at lower levels for some time, creamy appearance and lots of lacing. Beer itself looks like black coffee, no light may be permitted to pass through. Coffee and chocolate present on nose, coffee more so. Sweet bready characterstics as well. In flavor the coffee is much stronger, almost overpowering but not too extreme. Finishes long and remains on lips. Nice and creamy feel, when swishing, movement of liquid is difficult to perceive, almost envelops the tongue. Pretty nice, wish I liked coffee.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,hman43,4.31,Look: It pours black with a brown head. Head retention is very good.  Smell: The strong smell of coffee and chocolate dominates the aroma.  Taste: It has a dominant coffee taste with a decent deal of bitterness going down. There are roasted elements as well.  Feel: It has a full body and a good amount of bitterness in the finish.  Overall: This is a great coffee brew.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,md3kcn,4.49,"Drank early this morning, and wrote this on a napkin. Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $4.00. Poured into a nonic pint glass.  L - Motor oil brownish-black, with a fluffy and viscous two-finger khaki head. Lacing is excellent. S - Reminds me of the coffee from Dynamite Roasting. Bittersweet chocolate. Roasted oat. T - Matches nose, with a bit more complexity. Definite ethanol presence, but the flavor of it never comes through (a good thing). Super toasty. Bittersweet throughout. More coffee-heavy than chocolate-heavy. F - Thick. Heavy. Full-bodied, with little carbonation (if any). A sipper. O - Probably not the best idea to have this for breakfast. A prime example for an oatmeal stout. Definitely recommend trying this one, but I won't purchase one again (not too into heavy beers).",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,timobkg,4.68,"Pours almost black with a thick cream colored head that diminishes with time but never disappears.  Aroma of rich coffee with a hint of dark chocolate.  The taste is coffee tempered with a splash of milk and sweetened with dark chocolate just enough to take the edge off on top of a bed of dark roasted grains.  Every sip is rich and full.  Overall, it's a great coffee stout - one of the best, the benchmark by which other coffee stouts are judged. It hits the perfect coffee / stout balance to highlight the coffee without making it taste like you're drinking black coffee and with a rich, dark stout as the base that holds up nicely to the coffee. Other coffee stouts often have too little coffee flavor, or sometimes too much, but this one nails the balance.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Infinity,4.68,"A little bit too sugary and carbonated for my tastes, but a world-class drink nonetheless. It will definitely be my go-to if I'm in the mood for a coffee/oatmeal-style beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,BitteNochEinWeissbier,4.47,"12 oz bottle Glass: snifter Serving Temp: room temperature (approx 71 F)   Look: Black with huge 2.5-finger khaki head that pretty much fills out the snifter. The head dissipates slowly to leave a slight but consistent khaki coating. Lacing is all the way down the glass.  Smell: Dark-roasted Columbian coffee with a large dose of bittersweet chocolate.  Taste: Pretty much the same as it smells. Coffee. Lots of coffee. With notes of bittersweet chocolate and some earthy bitterness. The coffee and earthiness linger into the aftertaste. The alcohol is not noticed.  Feel: Creamy and smooth with medium body.  Overall: A fantastic stout that has been one of my favorites since I first had it back in 2013 or 2014. I try to keep a couple on hand at all times. This one is a bit more bitter than I remember, but that's likely because this is the freshest Breakfast Stout that I have had in a while. I have mostly been having them at 1+ years old. At that age, the chocolate takes center stage and the coffee is the supporting act.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Coffee roast and chooclate char dominate this beer from start to finish along with some coffee bean and Espresso underneath. Ends with a lingering chocolate coffee char on the back side with some toast cocoa popping up at the very back end.  M - Big medium to full body with just a slight bit of thinness around the edges.  O - This beer continues to be fantastic, not sure what took me so long to review this after drinking it for years. (As I scratch my head.)",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Perioddicals,3.87,"L - June 2021 batch poured in January 2022 from a bottle into a standard pint glass at roughly 50- 55 degrees. 3/4ths of a finger light tan head. The beer is extremely dark and opaque. The head leaves a nice lacing that lasts for longer than most.  S - Disclaimer. I actively dislike coffee. (Yes, even the smell.) This beer hits with coffee up front, but I knew that going into it and wanted to try a well-regarded beer anyway. Then I get a dark bitter chocolate. There are some oats in there, and finally just a general roast smell.  T - Coffee is first, with some bitter dark chocolate next. I get a hint of a cola flavor. Interestingly enough, the coffee fades and the flavors just smooth out into each other. Then there's a small coffee finish. Absolutely not hoppy bitterness. The only bitter flavor is from the coffee/cocoa flavor. There is a little roastiness in the finish as well.  F - This is a medium feel, but a little thinner than expected from such a dark beer. Decent carbonation. Actually, there is a nice mild fizz in there. Exquisitely smooth.  O - Again, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors. I don't see myself seeking this out in the future, but I'm glad I tried it, and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to any coffee-loving friends in the future.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,TheMatts,4.27,"There is a time and a place for this beer. It is fantastic though. Higher ABV and you can taste that. Jet black color, with a short mocha colored head. Coffee, dark chocolate, and oatmeal flavors, maybe even some slight slight notes of turmeric. Had some bitterness.

Lacing left behind as it dissolves back into liquid form. S: Aromas of chocolate, coffee, dark malts, molasses, dark fruit, brown sugar. T: Same as the smell follows here - chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, molasses, dark fruit. Very good! F: Medium bodied, easy to drink, ABV well hidden. O: This is my go to for a stronger stout because of the complexity and greatness of taste in the stout. Would highly recommend.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Knoght5191,5,"For a non barrel aged beer this one is incredible. The best best barrel aged beer I had so far was tweak from Avery brewing. Surely Tweak is better than this beer but that is because it was aged in Bourbon barrels and it costs a lot more. But still, these two beers are similar in many ways on how it coats your mouth and the taste lingering long after even a small sip. I can’t believe this is just a stout. Absolutely incredible!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Coffee, chocolate, light roast malt aromas. Coffee, cocoa, light hop fruitiness, cinnamon flavors . Smooth full mouthfeel, no alcohol heat, light sweet fruit aftertaste. Flavors bloom slightly as the glass warms. Ticks all the boxes for a coffee stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,AcidCatfish,4.15,"I was itching to try a good stout recently. I heard that Founders Breakfast Stout was fantastic. I decided to give it a shot.  Poured from the bottle into a wide-mouth tulip.  Looks - Like coffee. Medium roast cold-brew is very much what this looks like. Has a light brown head, very creamy and soft looking. Nice and thick  Smell - Like various coffee roasts, dried fruits (stone fruits, cherries), and a lighter dark cocoa scent come through.  Taste - A bit underwhelming, I'll say. It isn't bad...but it comes through with a strong coffee flavor..however, it is more in line with the after-taste of coffee which comes across as more bitter than I'd want. Some dried fruits come through as well which is more enjoyable before cascading into deep dark chocolate that is almost exactly like eating a 100% cocoa chocolate bar. A bit of alcohol burn on the finish that isn't too strong and easy to miss. Some spiciness in the beer as well that is hard to place.  Feel - Thick, creamy, smooth. A very nice mouthfeel.  Overall, I think I expected more than I got from this. While it was good, I was missing some more hutzpa to this. I appreciated the cocoa, but I think the coffee notes were too bitter and didn't pair well with the already bitter cocoa. The mouthfeel was absolutely spectacular though. I have three more bottles of this and I will try this brew in a proper stout glass next to see if the taste improves. I'm also not too much of a fan of oatmeal mash brew. I've always been underwhelmed when trying beers brewed with oatmeal, so this could be the culprit. I did enjoy it thoroughly though!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,eatsluggs,5,"Pours a thick long lasting foan that caps a most black stout. Medium carbonation. Toasted cocoa and coffee beans notes, with prevalent charred grains flavors. Heavy on the palate. Sweet and bitter aftertaste. Pairs wonderfully with meat pies, game or red meat roasts and of course with a German Chocolate Cake.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Rapscullion,3.75,"Pours jet black with a thin tan head that rapidly evaporates - contrary to the back label description. Nose is French roast coffee that almost completely overpowers the roast malt and dark chocolate beneath. Hints of fig and crushed walnut. Palate follows with burnt coffee dominating. Grahm cracker, maple, dark chocolate and nutmeg. Medium mouthfeel and creaminess imparted by the oatmeal. Way too much coffee for my palate, dominates the beer and lends an unpleasant bitterness from the dark roast. Not a balanced or integrated brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Feel: Mouthfeel is not as thick as some imperial stouts but there is body here.  Overall: A good easy drinking stout. A nice balance. Dominant flavors are from the added ingredients, like the chocolate and coffee. Almost a desert beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Bierschenker,4.65,"Bought at AH Wezenberg Antwerp. They do try to get some rare new brews on a regular basis. Served in my usual tumbler. Colour is black. Head never really develloped. Same brown lacing. Scent is mellow and rich: lot's of cold coffee, fruit (pear, grapes and dates), cereals (oat and mais), sigar ashes and chocolate cake. Flavour again is rich and mellow. strong and silky smooth at the same time. Smoked grain, coffee ground and dark chocolate, full cream with maple syrip poured over. Not a lot of carbonation present. The aftertaste gives some more dry and bitter hops. Astringant chocolate, with granola with full cream. resembles more liquor. Thinking of Sheridans and Amarula.  My best sweet stout to date.

1199,11757,davisdahlberg6,4.55,"Canned on date 12/22/20 and enjoyed in a 16oz Founders snifter on 10/15/21. Appearance: Pours a dark brown almost black with a finger of khaki medium brown colored foam. Great head retention and nice lacing as the foam dissipates Smell: Deep complex roasted coffee malts with associated bitterness. The bitterness is balanced out with lovely notes of chocolate and earthiness and a bit of oat flavor. Subtle bourbon flavors of vanilla and oak as well. I will admit that it’s frustrating to get these complex coffee chocolate aromas and not be able to describe but I’ll leave it at that.  Taste: Coffee bitterness with subtle notes of chocolate and earthy notes. The oats and chocolate really help balance and support the coffee flavors. Bourbon flavors are more present in the nose but subtle in the taste along with some caramel.  Feel: Minimal carbonation and its hard to over-estimate the creamy smooth mouth-feel. Slight alcohol warmness, but it helps bring out the bourbon flavors and it’s kinda expected considering the above average abv of 8.3%.  Overall: A bit more bitter than I remember, but I appreciate a beer that doesn’t over-rely on sweet desert taste to mask the higher abv disappear. Would definitely buy again!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ZeroHero,4.24,"Look: Black in color with a thin head that quickly dissipates. Relatively minimal lacing on the glass.  Smell: Coffee and roasted malt dominate the smell, with chocolate lurking in the background.  Taste: Dark coffee forward, malt, and a touch of chocolate, but mostly coffee and malt. Even though this is 60 IBU's and has a higher ABV, the taste and finish is surprisingly low on bitterness, and is much more sweet than I was expecting which was a pleasant surprise.  Feel: Relatively smooth with some very light carbonation.  Overall: This is one of the best stouts I have had to date. Founder's really knocked it out of the park with this one, and I was pleasantly surprised by the low bitterness. Only things I would change would be a larger and creamier head, along with a more chocolate forward taste instead of coffee; however that's just my preference. Definitely a stout I'd recommend to others!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,RadMan18,4.53,"Founders Breakfast Stout is an amazing beer that luckily can be found widely.  Poured from a bottle in a 4 pack into a traditional pint glass, the stout pours deep black with a slight umber cast around the margins. A head barely forms before disappearing to the edges creating a ring of light cream that lasted until around half way through the drink. The edge thins to create a dark umber ring as I tip the glass back for a drink.  The stout smells mainly of coffee and dark chocolate with slight hints of caramel and malt. The taste is supremely balanced which is why this beer is highly rated. Immediately the coffee and chocolate hit on the front. I was anticipating a bitter or alcohol taste (due to the higher than average alcohol content) when the flavor moved back but that never happened. The coffee, roast, and chocolate continued all the way through and left a slightly spiced aftertaste.  The stout feels medium thickness but not creamy due to its low carbonation. Swooshing the the beer in my mouth it does have a creamier feel as the little amount of carbonation in the beer comes out.  Overall, this beer is packed with flavor and has nearly no negatives as long as one enjoys coffee and chocolate! The only thing that could potentially be better is a creamy head, but that may mess up the balance Founders has struck with this gem.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T: Coffee, sweet chocolate, oak cask, raisins, oats, bitter chocolate, cinnamon, earthy char, burned coffee, charred bread crust. F: It has a rich, lightly syrupy heavy mouthfeel with ample bitterness and a medium length finish. It does not go wide nor is it too dynamic. For the most part the mouthfeel is centralized. O: A bittersweet oatmeal stout with profoundly deep columns of flavors. Poured, over time the beer has subtle changes in it's taste which help lead to it's overall deliciousness.

Taste: Hits with coffee first then dark chocolate follows. Bitterness as expected but not too bitter. Feel: Coats the tongue, bubbles give nice tickle.

Taste is rich, full-bodied, and slightly sticky sweet with a bitterness that lingers on the palate for quite a while after each sip. Notes are similar to smell.. with coffee, dark chocolate and toffee at the helm. I'm not picking up on th oatmeal, but it could be because the other flavors are dominant. Alcohol is hidden well at 8.3%, but still noticeable.  Mouth feel is full bodied and syrupy, but not sickeningly so.  Definitely drinking this one slowly.  I'm really enjoying this stout.

1199,11757,Jeez,3.89,"Bottled 3/11/21. This is the perfect time for a summer spring winter beer.  The description on the back of the bottle pretty much tells it all. It pours dark brown with a small tan head, much like the coffee types it emulates. Smell and taste are almost identical: black coffee and unsweetened chocolate. There is a bit of mild oat sweetness that I get on the nose, but not on the tongue. The chocolate is a bit more pronounced in the taste. There is a particular roasted quality in the aftertaste that I like. It's a cup of joe that makes you feel even better. It's very smooth, which may be attributed to the addition of oatmeal (I'm just reading BA's description of the style at this point). No alcohol heat either.  I enjoy it, even if it is a bit on the bitter side. There just isn't anything that really grabs me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,eameslover,3.28,A decent stout that I forgot to log when I drank it. I could get the coffee and chocolate but it still lacked the thickness that I was looking for.

1199,11757,BigIronH,3.84,"Definitely has a raisin type smell. The flavor follows suit but you can distinguish the chocolate initially and the coffee on the backend. I like this beer but it’s not as complex as some of the other Founders which some may appreciate but I for one enjoy the mirage of flavors. Not a bad beer, just simple.

1199,11757,JohnniEMc,4.78,"Previously consumed and often, this review will be perfunctory. It's undeniably one of the best in the world. Out from the 12 ounce bottle into a clear Imperial pint glass, it's a richly deep and dark brown with a modest tan head. The roasted malt, chocolate and oat aroma can't be surpassed by any in this style. It just might be the smoothest and richest brew you can find. The taste overall is complexly bittersweet. There's so much good going on, but the prominent flavors are roasted, not burnt nor overly roasted barley malt, then coffee, then chocolate. If that's not enough for the taste buds to discern, there's some sort of mild spiciness created by the infusion of the major contributors.

Taste: Coffee, no chocolate, no coffee, ... well choco-coffee it is, but medium to full, not at all like a sweet mocha-java. Just the echo of sweetness. Hops are perfect - you couldn't enjoy this with too little and you couldn't experience the choco-coffee with too much. Perfect balance. Zero booziness for a heavy ABV beer. Look: cross between motor oil & espresso, but not as thick as the stuff left in the coffee pot for 3-4 hours. Overall: Has to be one of my faves for cool weather beers. Can stand up to a cigar but also good alone. Must be awesome out of the tap; maybe worth a trip to Grand Rapids.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,BillAfromSoCal,4.53,"Brew date of 6/6/2020. Purchased off a room temp shelf about July 6, stored in the fridge for about 7 weeks. Poured into two pint glasses to share L: black with dark tan somewhat persistent head roughly 3/4 inch thick consisting of a myriad of bubble sizes, not quite as creamy as some stout examples but still quite thick and relatively creamy. minimal lacing on the sides of the glass as I drink it. No head left by the time I am 1/2 way through the glass. S: mix of roasted oats, bitter chocolate and coffee; probably would be less subtle if I let it warm up a pit before pouring T: like a concentrated version of the smell. Probably a bit more of the bitter chocolate flavor than the coffee flavor. F: world class; somewhat viscous, smooth and creamy but with the carbonation providing a bit of fine tingle on the tongue. It becomes obvious from the feel that this is a real calorie bomb. O: This is the benchmark by which I compare other stouts. Not because it is the best, but because it is a world class example of its kind that is consistent quality and pretty readily available.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The look of this beer while pouring it is that of iced black coffee, it leaves a small creamy colored head. Smells rich of chocolate & good coffee, slight hint of malts. The black coffee taste is what initially hits you, then it ends with that nice, sweet, chocolatey aftertaste. The feel is pretty flat, as expected of a good stout, but goes down exceptionally smooth.

1199,11757,just1cho,4.54,"*Poured a 12oz bottle into a Teku glass at 55F*  This stout poured a predictable deep brown color with a bit of a mocha colored head and little retention. It had nice rocky bubbles which settled into a thin lace around my glass.  Predictably, the stout smelled of cold-brew coffee, very cacao heavy dark chocolate, and just straight up dutch processed cocoa powder. There was a hint of roasted malt character to the aroma, but this was super covered up by the intense smell of coffee and chocolate.  Tasting it, I was immediately hit with a rich cocoa powder bitterness, then mellowing out to a dark chocolate and some Sumatra dark coffee (coffee with earthy and herbal notes) towards the middle. Then towards the back of the throat, I picked up some of the roasted malt characteristics that I got from the aroma while also getting a bit of lingering cocoa powder/espresso bitterness. Very rich, and very good.  By far my favorite aspect of this beer was its mouthfeel and how it gave me the sensation that I was drinking straight up liquid chocolate. With little to no carbonation, it felt silky smooth and was medium to full bodied. It left an oily coating inside of my mouth, and that could be a positive or a negative to some. But if it's a negative, then you're probably not drinking oatmeal stouts anyways.

Damn passable, but I wasn’t expecting the coffee to be so bitter.

The smell is amazing, dark and rich and full of chocolate and coffee. The taste is a great stout with a strong finish of coffee, chocolate, and.. smoke? Yes.

1199,11757,PathofChaos,4.91,"Appearance: A burgeoning bouquet of mocha foam blooms to the surface of this jet black beer. Like a display of fireworks, the head bursts over night-sky blackness, then dissipates until it vanishes, leaving fragments of speckled lacing that drift down and disappear as the drink finishes.  Bouquet: Roasted caramel coffee beans, Belgian milk chocolate, and bittersweet toffee make for an astonishing introduction of aromatics.  Feel: Cloud-like smoothness drifts around the palate, enveloping it in a cozy, pillowy medium body. A low-volume lullaby of carbonation hums gently under the tongue and lingers not a second after the stout washes down.  Taste: Milk chocolate cookie dunked in espresso, then adorned with alternating layers of fluffy vanilla mousse and creamy bread pudding. Inundated with chocolate throughout: deep cocoa nibs upfront, an intermittent nibble of dark chocolate chips phases in and out at the midpoint, then dusting of cocoa powder sneaks in during the aftertaste. It's like biting into a forkful of Tiramisu, substituting the mascarpone and rum for a brimful bounty of gourmet chocolates.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,defunksta,4.26,"Appearance: Pours a nearly jet black color with an ashen, cinnamon, medium-colored tan head that is surprisingly small in size. (3.75)  Aroma: Strong aromas of dark roast coffee w/ hints of cinnamon and red chili spice. There's dark Belgian chocolate and cacao nibs jump in the mix to make it evolve into a mocha type of aroma in the middle. A slight cream and oat aromas on the back end to round out the aroma and make it smooth. (4.00  Flavor: Huge, complex flavors upfront of espresso, cacao nibs, dark chocolate. Then hints of tiramisu, bread pudding, and chocolate cake. Hard to pin down exactly. There's some dark molasses malts mixed with coffee and dark chocolate with some spices to give it an incredibly complex flavor. Overall similar to the nose, it start with a strong roasted coffee flavor, followed by an evolution into a mocha and dark chocolate cake middle that is decently bitter. Then oatmeal and dark chocolate cake and roastienss to balance out the chocolate and actually finishes dryer than I expected. (4.50)  Feel: Medium bodied. Lighter than I expected. A strong alcohol bite in the middle. Moderate carbonation. Finishes roasty and much cleaner than I expected. (4.25)  Compared to Founders' Dirty Bastard 1/23/22: Pours a darker color with a darker head. Stronger aromas of coffee. More coffee roast, chocolate, and oats. Less caramel, tiramasu, toffee, and strudel.  Compared to Northcoast Old Rasputin 2/13/22: Pours a similar color, milder head. Stronger aromas. More milk chocolate and coffee. Less roasted barley and bitter black malt. More smooth malt and milk chocolate.  Compared to More Hush of Night 2/2023: Pours similar, milder head. Stronger aromas. More coffee roast.

Less rich dark chocolate. More roasted balance and less sweet.  Overall: A Hall of Fame beer and World Class beer here. Tons of chocolate balanced by a robust coffee flavor. The coffee is bright, light, and not too bitter. Just enough, but not too much to allow some spices flavor to develop. Cleans the palate well.

1199,11757,QMobs,5,"Wow. Just amazing. I try not to throw the word ""perfect"" or ""masterpiece"" around liberally, because the overuse of those words definitely diminish the value of its description, but this is honestly one of those few exceptions I must allow.  This beer has everything. Rich, balanced-bitterness, dark, delicious, with a nice delectable coffee overtone throughout. This is honestly a treat. The beer's title certainly makes sense to me, because it's so pleasing and coffee-augmented that I could truly have it for breakfast (if it weren't for the 8% ABV at least).  For anyone who enjoys stouts, or just beer in general at this point, this is ABSOLUTELY a must-have.

It's labeled as double chocolate, but the coffee taste comes out on top. Not necessarily a complaint. The chocolate is mainly in the aftertaste. Bitter, but not horribly so. The feel is a little thinner than I'd like, but thick enough to satisfy. Overall very good. For my tastes, it's easy drinking, but this style of beer is right up my alley.

1199,11757,RaymondMillbrae,3.91,"Ok, so let me start-off with a preface. My wifey brings home a lot of, free, dark chocolates...which we always end up giving away.  Now back to the review.  I always drink my stouts a little cooler than room temperature. I do this because I love the head, and because I get the best aromas off the head this way.  First-off...the color was spectacular. The oats gave it a super full body/richness, which also made it super thick and dark.  I grabbed a 350-lumen flashlight, and I could FAINTLY see a dark tan around the very edges of the glass. With a regular flashlight, I could not see any light at all.  Awesome! I love my stouts super dark and full-bodied.  The head was also thick. (I tilt the glass 45° and fill it half way. Then I straighten the glass and slam the rest of the bottle/can into the glass for a nice head).  The bubbles were super small and tight. And it also left a super nice lace.  Mind you, this is a smidgen cooler than room temps. I’m guessing at around 65° F.  As for the smell...it was also great. But sadly (like I started with my preface), I dislike dark chocolate. And the smell was very prevalent with dark chocolate.  The taste was fantastic. I loved that it was not overly bitter at all. As a matter of fact, it was creamy and smooth.  But that dark chocolate taste was extremely prevalent...which I did not like.  Mind you, this is just me. If you like the dark chocolate smell and taste, this might be for you.  But it wasn’t for me.  May I also add that it had a high 8.3. ABV. But both me and my wifey did not feel that it was that high at all.  We both agreed that it felt less than Founders regular porter (my favorite), which is only 6.5 ABV.  So the ABV on our 4-pack was weaker than marked.  Weird.  Anyhoo...it was a bit expensive at $11.00 (BevMo) for only 4 bottles.  I guess it had extra ingredients. But I could not get past the dark chocolate taste.  I’m looking around for a clone recipe of this, and I’ll substitute the dark chocolate with cocoa nibs (or maybe caramel), and it’ll probably rock.  But that’s just me.  Great oat stout otherwise.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,sjdevel,4.76,"Look - Dark Dark Dark Black.... light does not stand a chance getting through this one. I got a 1 finger head upon pouring from a Founders squatty 12 oz bottle. The head receded slowly and the lacing and foam ring stuck around the whole time. I can't imagine this one looking any better for a Imperial Stout.  Smell - Nice rich blast of coffee - not too dark of a roast of coffee it seems, but more of a caramelly medium roast. Smells sweet and dessert-like. A lot of Chocolate and a bit of caramel also come through.  Taste - There is a bit of a bite at first but I can't really determine if any come from hops or if it is from the heavily roasted grains and coffee. Somewhat sweet towards the middle, but dries out and gets more 'stout-like' towards the end. Pretty strong chocolate flavor - which is great as most 'chocolate' beers barely show hints of it. Coffee flavor is quite forward here, but not so overpowering that you don't get other flavors - this is very well balanced. Very complex - some wood, nutty, campfire notes fade in and out and increase towards the end. Awesome beer here!  Feel - This is a full bodied beer, but I was expecting it to be a bit thicker. I like my stronger stouts chewy. Can't fault them too much though, it is still pretty thick and rich - carbonation never completely gives out.  Overall - This beer is one that must be tried. Founders recently started distributing this way westward (Colorado) and this one was on my beer bucketlist.

Luxurious coffee flavor with a kick of spice, followed by an intense chocolate creaminess, roasty malt, a lick of dark currant, and warm hops. A myriad of bold flavors, all in perfect balance.

1199,11757,SierraNevallagash,4.27,"Founders Breakfast Stout - 8.8%ABV- 60 IBUs. 12oz bottle dated 7/30/18 - poured into a snifter at slightly too chill.  Pours a pitch black, opaque shade. A hard pour yeilds a finger of cinnamon colored head, receding fairly quickly. Edit: Now that it's mostly gone (the beer), I can see that it's truly a dark dark brown. It looks like coffee concentrate. Deep brownish black, a brilliant sheen, and slick.  Nose is dark chocolate and a heavy hit of cayanne chili. Subtle notes of ground coffee beans and maybe some vanilla. The chili pepper is big though. There's a slight acidity that I'm guessing might be from the coffee that's in here.  Palate is huge bittersweet cocoa and java. Mocha. Finishing much more coffee than chocolate. I'm also getting a touch of that chili pepper, but not nearly as much as the nose would indicate. That hint of acidity translates, to a minor degree, to the palate. Like oily black coffee. It's sweet upfront, and then the roasty toasty comes in and cuts that sweetness in half. There is a slight bitterness to it that is a byproduct from the huge amount of dark roasted malts, rather than from hopping. The big sweet kick keeps that bitterness in check, and helps keep it moving without becoming unpleasant. For an imperial stout, I'd actually say the bitterness is on the lower side, but definitely expect a little more than your favourite 6ABV milk stout. Warming up, that chili is coming back out, and it truly reminds me of Mexican hot cocoa with a pinch of coffee in it.  The mouthfeel is soft and silky. Rich, slightly viscous, with a nice mouthcoating quality. Thick outmeal character. Carbonation is low, naturally, having to fight through the heft and viscosity of this beer. It's nice and thick and chewy, as the style calls for.  Overall, this is very good. The alcohol is well hidden. The chili pepper note throws me off a tiny bit, but the sweetness works to its benefit. It's well rounded, and not too much of anything. There are stouts I much prefer, but all in all, this is definitely one of the better ones I've had. I'm glad I got to try this one, and it has quite a bit going for it (mouthfeel), but I cannot justify buying a 4 pack, and I can't quite call it world class. This is all subjective. I can see it being the holy grail for some, I guess I just prefer lighter milk stouts. Cheers.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,woodychandler,4.44,"I am frankly incredulous that I have not previously reviewed & rated this beer! How did I allow it to pass me by for so long? I sought this one out even though it only comes in a Bottle while I am trying to eradicate my backlog. That is indicative of how important it is to me to get this one in.  From the Bottle: ""Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout""; ""60 IBUs""; ""The coffee lover's consummate beer. Brewed with an abundance of flaked oats, bitter and imported chocolates, and two types of coffee, this Stout has an intense fresh-roasted java nose topped with a frothy, cinnamon-colored head that goes forever.""  I began by Pop!ping the cap & knowing that it was a very fresh bottle, I proceeded with a C-Line pour. Man, it came up quickly with a pseudo-cascade that formed two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head with excellent retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled like my morning coffee - a mélange of deeply roasted beans from different locales that I blend together each day & fill the basket to the point that the water has to be coaxed through the filter. Rich, strong coffee with hints of chocolate & smoke. Mmm. Mouthfeel was thick, full, rich & creamy, like a dollop of coffee-chocolate ice cream had been scooped onto my tongue. Mmm. The taste was at once chocolaty and coffee-like with a hint of smoke. Mmm. I have had this many times over, but always out in town, where I rarely do field reviews any more. It is always a treat, just like it was tonight. Loads of lacing formed as I drank through the beer, savoring every sip. I guess that I have taken it for granted in the past since my time with it for this review makes me feel like a born-again virgin. It was like I had never experienced it before, while I know that such was not the case. Finish was more chocolaty than coffee, so I am going to say that it was semi-sweet, but if you want to go with semi-dry, I am not going to put up much of a fight.

Loses it's head pretty soon. S- Chocolate, vanilla bean, molasses, caramel, oatmeal, and coffee all melded together. Wonderful combination of aromas. T- I get notes of bitter dark chocolate, sweet vanilla bean, creamy oatmeal, caramel, candied yams, and bitter roasted coffee. A slight alcoholic bite is also noted. F- Decently thick bodied beer. Wholesome with slight carbonation. Pretty much what you'd expect. O- Overall an extremely well made stout. What did I expect?

Some stouts have one adjunct in it like oatmeal, chocolate, or coffee while this stout manages to cram all 3 adjuncts into one stout. I like this beer better than the bourbon barrel aged KBS by the way. The oatmeal gives it a creamy frothy head. I am tasting some chocolate but the main thing that I am tasting is the sumatra coffee. I would not age a stout that has adjunct like coffee or chocolate because both flavors will dissipate over time, matter of fact this beer is better when consumed fresh.

The addition of Nitrogen to a beer gives way to much smaller bubbles, creating a smoother, creamier experience. Beyond mouthfeel, there are variances in appearance and smell as well. Because of that, this has a much more defined taste! Poured a dark tan, thick head that lasted! I let it sit for about 10 minutes before tasting. The nose is ALL roasted malt and coffee with dark or baker’s chocolate. My mouth watered just from the smell! The taste was exactly what the head precluded it would be. The right amount of bitterness with the coffee up front. Smokiness from the roasted malt and I caught a bit of vanilla on the back. Drinking it cold and right from the tap, I doubt the vanilla note would show itself. So much flavor!

As the beer warms the coffee starts to come out a bit more. Still that chocolate is pushing the front of the taste. Stone fruits like raisins show upin the far background.  Mouth feel is on the heavy end of medium yet very smooth. The oatmeal makes the mouth a bit heavier but adds a luscious creaminess.  This is a pretty complex stout. I like the addition of the oatmeal for the wonderful mouth and a touch more sweet. For fans and advocates of the darker beers Founders does these so well and this is a very good example. There is a slight touch of alcohol warming to it that I like. This tells you this is a big guy and would also work while sitting around a fire at the ski lodge to take off the chill from the slopes.

One of the most opaque stouts I have seen, with a rich burgundy red head to boot, which had dissipated within minutes, leaving behind a ebony jewel. A truly bold example, and a textbook stout aesthectic.  Smell Chocolate! Creamy, succulent, mouth-watering cocoa hit me immediately, followed by coffee, some nutmeg, oats, concluding with a roasted hoppiness. Truth be told, it is the most dynamic smelling stout I have tried! Aeration brought the coffee front and center, revieling what seemed that of dark fruits (blackberries, black cherries, etc.)  Taste My goodness, we have a winner! This stout is remarkable! A frighteningly dynamic pallet hits you with haste; the most outstanding flavors being chocolate and roasted coffee, with almost the consistency of cappuccino. Slight aeration within the mouth dug up overtones of blackberries, honey, and nutmeg, which was a wonderful surprise. With a pallete as varied as this, the breakfast stout could please just about anyone. Given its ABV rating, the taste of alcohol was far down on my list.  Feel Incredible, and thick! An amalgamtion of creams and soups - almost as rich as steamed machiato. No alcohol burn at all, going down easily. The warmth of this stout is strong, sitting heavily in the stomach.

1199,11757,Fading2black,4.29,"Breakfast YUM! This beer pours a dark mahogany brown with a light brown head that dissipates quickly to a ring around glass until finished. Almost no lacing. Full, lasting, head and thick lacing would boost the score higher, but personally I place 80% of my opinion on taste, and this tastes great Tastes of chocolate and coffee, and the finish is moist, alcohol with a hint of bitterness, but not overbearing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Aftertaste is gone quickly and leaves no lingering bitterness which is really nice. There is way less bitterness than the 60 IBU would indicate. The ABV is 8.30% which is pretty high. The beer doesn't taste that alcoholic, but you definitely feel that alcohol after a glass. (Well, at least I do). Overall a great beer, with my only wish being a lesser price than the $12 I had to pay for a 4-pack.

1199,11757,Dr_Gonzo,4.73,"Poured into a tall clear glass. Has a dark reddish brown color, almost the appearance of cola. Thick fluffy tan head on top about the size of a thumb.  I smell a strong scent of roasted coffee beans, toffee, molasses, vanilla, dark chocolate, and oats.  The taste has a strong espresso composition. Oddly I taste black olives but it's welcoming. Along with that, there are notes of molasses, vanilla, raisins, prunes, roasted nuts, and dark chocolate. Altogether pretty bitter, but excellent. Feel delicately creamy.  A great treat.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,edc20,4.21,Extremely thick and dark stout. Low carbonation and viscous mouthfeel. Coffee and chocolatey taste is strong.

1199,11757,Ahypercube,4.49,"It seem quite silly, in my opinion, to drink this beer cold. I had one at fridge temp yesterday and I was profoundly disappointed. I have basically been saving the experience of trying this beer for later in my life since two years ago. Trying it for a second time now at room temperature and it is considerably more complex and balanced, but idk, just not blown away. I think I'd like KBS or CBS much more.  L: Incredibly dark. Just a trace of reddish cola color can be noted at the edges of the body when held to light, but it's as dark as espresso. A thin film of cappuccino foam lingers on top, and leaves sticky waves of lacing on the glass.  S: Roast coffee, espresso, black olives, dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, toffee, prunes, raisins, vanilla, milk, oatmeal, cloves, and coffee. The coffee don't quit. It's a fantastic aroma, but if you wish to appreciate it, I hope you like coffee.  T: Salty as hell. Oddly enough, there is just an edge of oatmeal flavor right before the anticipatedly huge coffee note, which dances around the vanilla, dark chocolate, molasses, toffee, dried fruit, and black olives, all the way to the finish. It ends in almost entirely plain charcoal with a touch of unsweetened chocolate and coffee acidity. Alcohol is difficult to make out in all of that. If it was flat, you could easily mistake it for a mildly sweetened cold brew. Btw, when cold, the only detectable flavors are the chocolate, coffee and olives.  F: Super drinkable. Nice thickness. To my taste, it could be just a smidge thicker and more syrupy, but that's probably exactly how KBS is.  O: This brew reminds me very much of my first ever Russian Imperial Stout, Old Rasputin by North Coast. A touch less salty and with much more coffee flavor, it is also a delectable offering, but not one that I see as superior at all. If anything, I think I prefer Old Rasputin. In my honest opinion, BCBS, Narwhal, Victory at Sea, and even Founders' own porter all blow this out of the water. I'm still eager to try the barrel-aged editions, but thus far, I don't see what all the hype is about.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,thehyperduck,4.38,"355 mL bottle from an LCBO 4-pack; best before July 8 2018 and served barely chilled. First 'had' in 2015, though I've re-sampled it roughly a half-dozen times since then. Needless to say, It's long overdue for a review.  This jet black stout comes equipped with a quarter-inch of frothy, tan-coloured head that fades away within 90 seconds; the only significant remnants are a tight, creamy collar and some foamy patches of bubbles floating upon the surface. Smells quite rich and rather sweet - I'm getting subtle notes of prune and date underneath a torrent of roasted malt goodness. Dark chocolate, treacle and toffee are more prominent than notes of earthy coffee grounds; there are also minor aspects of ethanol, vanilla, coffee cake and herbal licorice.  Seriously yummy stuff - there's an array of competing flavours, but that's fine by me because they melt together perfectly. Flavours of dark chocolate, cocoa powder and oatmeal sweetness come through at first, along with some molasses and caramelized malts. This is followed closely by fruity hints of fig and date - an important inclusion, because we all know that fruit is a vital component of any balanced breakfast. The coffee grounds start to kick in towards the back end, offering up an earthy bitterness as well as a pleasant roasted quality that will bring a smile to the face of any coffee addict. Coffee and chocolate both linger into the aftertaste, almost completely masking the alcohol content. If I didn't need to drive to work in the morning, I think I would actually be tempted to substitute this for my usual 8 AM java. In the vicinity of full-bodied, with light carbonation that meekly nudges the surfaces of the palate, to little effect - feels silky-smooth and soft in the mouth. I can't think of any other imperial stouts I've tried that went down the hatch with such sublime ease.  Final Grade: 4.38, a superlative A grade. Founders Breakfast Stout lives up to its hype. This is an excellent imperial stout with deep, complex, well-integrated flavour combinations - yet it's also one that I could drink on the regular. Ontario BAs should probably buy this one in bulk while it's still available - there really aren't any genuinely comparable alternatives (domestic or otherwise) at the LCBO right now.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,TagForKeeps,3.76,"Look: Not quite a Guinness dark, but certainly reminiscent of dark chocolate with a tannish head that lingers evenly over the surface.  Smell: For such a complex flavor the smell is very light. Some sharp sweet tones with a very subtle under tone of chocolate and oats.  Taste: This beer is probably my new second favorite under the locally brewed West O CocO stout for its bold and incredibly rich taste alone. The oats, coffee and dark chocolate mix perfectly giving it a balance between sweet and bitter without being over powering. There's even a whisper of hopps in the mix, but for those who dislike IPAs or overly bitter tastes this may not be a good beer to test the waters with. The after taste is, on its own, a unique feature and reminds me of biting into a piece of a Dove dark chocolate bar or taking a sip of Zak Wilde's Death Wish coffee.  Feel: The feel is heavier than your typical milk/cream stouts, but not like chugging a bottle of maple syrup.  Overall: This beer is fantastic and pairs well with a bowl of actual oatmeal or toast; however, light weights be ware of the 8.3% ABV and save this brew for after work. With the balance of sweet and bitter, roasty oats and dark chocolate, with just a touch of hopps and latte, this brew is more than likely not for the beginner stout connoisseur, but can easily become a favorite, and coffee drinkers are sure to love this stout.

1199,11757,Fear4Beer,3.9,"Poured out into a glass mug.  Inky black with a nice khaki colored head. What is impressive to me is that it is 8.3% ABV. It is very well hidden. I guess I'm not a big fan of stouts (my highest rated beer is a stout.. go figure! I'm confused too). I can respect what is being down in this beer but it just doesn't suit my palette that much. Every time I sip this beer it reminds me of another beer I've had that I really disliked but this tastes better than that. I think it was Oskar Blues' Ten Fidy. I'm going off memory I think it tastes like that minus the ridiculous amount of hops. I can imagine this beer being really enjoyed by stout drinkers who also like hops. There is some bitterness in this beer. I think that's where it loses me a bit. If it was boringly smooth (malty with much less hops) I'd probably love this stuff.  One word that keeps on coming into my head when I sip this beard is ""tangy"". Not exactly sour, but I sort of want to do a salsa dance for some reason. haha.  When I taste this beer I taste coffee first. It is certainly coffee dominate, then a little bit of cocoa, hops, and a tangy/acidic (probably from the coffee since coffee is very acidic) like after taste.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Pure jet black appearance and spawns a fine, flat beige head that lingers for a minute or two after hitting the glass.  The nose is dominated by unsweetened espresso followed by extra dark chocolate and yeast. The aromas are not overbearing but pleasantly noticeable during each sip.  For the taste, the dark chocolate begins to shine through along with the roasty espresso. As the beer warms after a few minutes, notes of heavy cream and minute spikes of smoke and salt can be detected at the tip of your tongue.

Yes, it smells of coffee. Yes, it is malty. Yes, there is chocolate. But the overall taste is of very bitter, extremely dark chocolate that kind of bites at the back of the throat. Obviously, from the reviews, that kind of flavor appeals to many.  It looks lovely, though. Oil black - viscous. The smell is... kind of acrid. It sure is not lacking in flavor.

Bitterness from whatever source is a bit more pronounced at the finish and in the aftertaste.  Full texture with balancing carbonation.  This one is better put together than most Stouts I've tasted. The flavors are simple but so well knit together it gives off a sense of complexity even though it relies on simple flavors. IBU is listed as 60 but I really don't taste that level of hopping present. Brewer mentions imported chocolate which to me means dark, bitter chocolate in the European style and while I don't actually taste that in this brew there is decidedly something extra in the overall flavor.

October is still a bit warm and this would be perfect to drink in the winter morning watching the snow fall but by the time that happens it's no longer fresh and therefore won't taste as delicious.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Great looking beer.  .Aroma: Powerful scent of roasted coffee/freshly ground coffee. Notes of toffee, carmalized sugar, caramel, molasses, but mostly just a beautifully rich scent of gourmet coffee.  .Taste: Roasted coffee, raw coffee bean, molasses and a slight malt sweetness upfront. A complex combination of flavor all giving way to an earthy, smokey finish. A nice subtle bitterness towards the end really adds beautiful balance. The finish is long and lingering, with a warm alcohol exhale.  .Palate: Luxurious cream like texture, velvety, rich, sticky. Medium to full body. Subtle carbonation, just right.  .Overall: A  .This beer is something else. A coffee lovers dream, but so much more.

Heavy overtones of deep, dark roast coffee and smokey roasted bean. Ends with a sensational dark cacao sweetness that lingers. Feel: Sticky and dry. Bitter dryness sticks to tongue with each sip.

Beer is dark as FUCK. Nice mocha colored head, fell pretty rapidly. Lazy lacing throughout session.  Aroma: tons of chocolate. Dark fruits. Plums. Hint of dust.  Flavor: heavy chocolate notes. Medium heavy slightly stale coffee notes. Medium sweetness. Just a touch of booze.  Medium bodied beer, slightly warming alcohol sensation. Moderate carbonation.  Overall: Ironically I had the KBS over a decade ago, and I'm just now getting around to trying the basebeer. It was pretty underwhelming. One dimensional chalky chocolate and stale coffee flavors dominate. This might have been mind blowing 10 years ago, but there are some serious coffee stout and porter contenders now that this thing pales in comparison to. Still have love for Founders, but in 2017 this beer doesn't deserve a second look.

Aroma is sweet, some chocolate and even a syrupy bourbon linger in the nose; not detecting any coffee... flavor may have faded during aging. Flavor and mouthfeel follow the aroma and over-carbonation. Not picking up any coffee flavor again, other than the stouts dark nature granting similarity. Not a bad stout. ~7.5/10  9/26/17: Pours just as dark, much less carbonation with less head. Aroma is COFFEE. I am amazed that these beers are the same. Coffee dominates and chocolate is quick to mix in giving me the impression of mocha. First sips are congratulated by an awesome rich dark chocolate and coffee blend. A masterpiece! 10/10!  In the end, I am tempted to dump the rest of the older product as it seems to have much less character; not well aged I suppose? The 2017 release seems to have captured the coffee and chocolate more than I remember - having consumed these for a few years now.

No light penetrates this beer at any angle. The head recedes to a thin ring and paper thin island. Aroma is as advertised. Chocolate, coffee, and roast malt abound. Taste is slightly tangy sweetish malt and chocolate giving way to a bitter coffee finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied, adequately carbonated, creamy and dry. To pull of a perfect tasty dry finish in a beer like this is somewhat magical. Overall, great. This beer is really good but anyone adverse to coffee or bitterness might want to wade in gently.

The aroma had some sweet to grainy oatmeal then a mix of chocolate/coffee blend underscored by an earthy hop base, then a moderate roast. The flavor was a lively blend of the sweetness of the oatmeal to chocolate to coffee and subsequently lead into the aftertaste with a fine smooth roast. Hops seem to be extremely faint. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with some sessionable traits to it. Semi-dry finish with a good carbonation about it. ABV felt as projected.

1199,11757,MaltsOfGlory,4.43,"12 oz bottle  I guess this is hard to find fresh. Recently purchased from a reliable source, this was bottled 7 months ago, hopefully it’s ok at 8.3 percent. Pours a hearty, two finger, milk chocolate colored head into my can-style glass. The body is completely black, with an odd amount of carbonation sticking to the side of the glass. Looks beefy so far.  Yeah I mean the nose doesn’t get much better than this. Huge coffee, and enough chocolate to keep my mouth watering. Fresh, dry, roasty, bitter coffee is the dominating aroma on the nose, but there is a sweet backbone to it. It smells amazing.  The flavor is huge. Coffee flavor is even more in your face on the flavor than in the aroma. Not what I would call a sweet beer for the most part, bitter coffee definitely dominates. Finishes with a slight cinnamon flavor, almost reminds me of mexican spiced coffee. Chocolate is just barely here. It’s a fantastic flavor, though I would have hoped for something slightly more balanced, as the aroma was suggesting.  The mouthfeel is alright. The body is honestly a little thin for a beer that is supposed to be your breakfast. Carbonation is just a tad below medium. It works, but something more chewy would be preferred.  The drinkability is very high for an 8.3% beer, you don’t get any heat at all, and it tastes fantastic.  Overall this is a pretty simple beer to review, it’s loaded with coffee, and not a lot else. Again, I would have hoped for something slightly more balanced, and maybe a little more complex, but what it does, it does well. Anyways, it’s still a fantastic beer.

Aroma of dark toasted malt, coffee, molasses and cocoa. Flavor is dark toasted malt with light char, baking chocolate, drip coffee, light hop bitterness in the finish. Excellent creamy body with obvious oat contribution. A rich, coffee forward stout with a dry profile that is more like a foreign export stout than an American one. Good chocolate flavor in the high cacao style, drier and more bitter.

1199,11757,Mindcrime1000,4.71,"Poured from single serve  This beer looks fantastic. I can't justify anything less than a top-notch number. Pours a nearly-opaque black with a fantastic three-finger head that slowly dissipates first to an inch of tan foam, then to perfect foamy lacing all of the way down the glass. This looks like a root-beer float head in a beer. Terrific.  The aroma is subdued compared to some others of the style, but it is all there for the smelling. Roasted malts up front with coffee and chocolate right behind. There is just a touch of spice and booze in the background.  This stout tastes fantastic, and follows its nose, but with more flavor than its aroma suggested would follow. It delivers an unapologetic roasted malt-bomb, balanced with bitter chocolate and coffee that is simply spot on. The booze is there, but it delivers a mixture of bite and sweetness, not burn. Then, at the very end, spice notes of cinnamon and anise tickle the back of the throat to complete the package.  Malt-bombs can be sticky messes. This one isn't. The bitterness and spice helps keep it from getting weighed down. Meanwhile, this thing is a paragon of full bodied chewiness. One more tick of carbonation would have made the mouth perfect.  Overall, I cannot think of an imperial stout that I would say I've tried and found clearly superior. If you prefer the drier end of the spectrum, you may not put this at the top of your list, but by any objective measure, this is simply fantastic, especially for the price.

There is vanilla too, as well as, dark bread, licorice, burnt wood, charred nuttiness, and roasted profiles while hop same time provides notes of earthy, citrus, and subtle spice. The aroma is more open with prominent quality of coffee when the beer warmed.  The taste of espresso, americano, and mocha is in the lead with nicely sweet milky chocolate followed shortly. Then it is roasted malt with some astringency together with dark bread, burnt wood, charred nuttiness, and some vanilla. Thanks to oat for the sweet, soft, and smooth. Those coffee flavors become much bolder and coat the taste buds before hop trying to add in its citric, slight spice, and earthy. Some bitterness and some astringency at the finish, in which mostly derive from the roasted and coffee profiles.

Prior review (12/4/16): Look 4.5, Smell 4.25, Taste 4.5, Feel 4.5, Overall 4.25 More sour than most stouts, this beer's high level of carbonation plays well against the dark flavor of cocoa. It is thick and almost pitch black, the head a rich tan. Very delicious beer that gets better every time.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,HipCzech,4.47,"Serving: 12 fl oz bottle (""bottled on 09/02/16"") poured into a 9 oz Libbey Embassy snifter.  Appearance: Deep and inky with dark brown fringes - doesn't allow much light through. A short, foamy head of tan foam recedes to spotty lacing.  Smell: Full nose of pleasantly roasting coffee beans and chocolate.  Taste: Big but balanced flavors of coffee (more pour over than espresso), both milk and dark chocolate, molasses, and hints of balancing bitter, savory and tart notes through to the finish.  Mouthfeel: Velvety smooth, slightly viscous and full bodied. Moderately carbonated with soft bubbles.  Overall: Amazingly balanced and flavorful.

Beautiful black, rich brown head, scents of chocolate and coffee, tastes bitter and sweet, feels thick like a bowl of oatmeal. It's great in just about every way.  But something is missing. Maybe it's been hyped too much. Maybe the price is just too high for me to feel comfortable buying it. Maybe I feel there are other great beers that do the thick, high ABV stout/porter thing equally as good if not better, generally for half the price.  Maybe something's just wrong with me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Red5StandingBy,4.94,"Poured from 12oz bottle into standard pint glass. Bottled on August 5th 2016.  L: Pure black, finger width tan head with incredible retention and solid lacing.  S: Wondrous on the nose, roasted coffee and chocolate that just makes you want to dive in.  T: The oatmeal in this makes it slightly chewy in a way (not that that is a bad thing at all). Dark roasted malts, Herbal hop presence is enough to balance with the astringency. Chocolates and coffee, oatmeal flavors. Just a wondrous experience to take a whiff and then a swallow of this delectable brew.  F: Full bodied and warming.  O: My favorite beer ever and I don't know what could possibly be better than this.  Update: KBS 2017  UPDATE 2017 RELEASE: Poured from a nice little short bottle into my Spiegelau Stout glass. Bottled on August 25th, 2017 not that really matters with this style. Super excited to taste this again.  L: Well this glass always seems to pronounce the head, so I got a big three finger tan one on this pour, I will be more gentle with the remaining three. As expected this pours a completely black color. The head retains very very well. Lcing is quite nice.  S: Not much more than coffee here, maybe some faint sherry, with a faint chocolate and smokiness. Have to drop the smell value down some as I wish this was a touch more complex on the nose. -.25 from last review.  T: Ohhh it's just as good as I remember. Just an explosion of flavor, richly roasted and earthy coffee, semisweetness from the chocolate, a slight oaty flavor, some sherry, wood smoke. Hot damn this is just delectable. You can.t beat the flavor of this beer. Raise Taste .25 to a perfect 5.  F: Full bodied, decent carbonation levels but the IT factor other than the flavor for this beer is the velvety smooth creaminess coming from the oats. Unbeatable mouth feel. Raise .25 on feel.  O: This is hands down, the greatest beer I have ever had. I love KBS and I don't know how I can try to decide between the two, but the simple elegance of this beer outdoes it.

S - Coffee and chocolate prominent. T - Chocolate flavor prominent on the palette initially, then the coffee flavor settles in if left to linger and absorb all the flavors of the beer. The aftertaste is slightly hoppy/bitter with prominent coffee notes. F - Delightfully balanced. The carbonation is just there enough to remind you it's a stout, but is never overwhelming and attributes to the smoothness of this brew.

But I give it a 4 because similar brews like dirty bastard ale and dragon milk beat it. But one thing I love about this beer is the coffee notes tied in with a strong bold alcohol bite and the dark coffee texture that fits perfect during a cold winter. However it tastes more potent than it is so it's missing the smoothness and it's almost priced too high to be considered a 5.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

When Its good, its thick, creamy and soft and has an abundance of coffee flavor. Its bigger beer at 8% but I find it sessionable. While KBS is also a great beer, I tend to enjoy Breakfast stout more.

One that I had was a perfect balance of chocolate, stout, and coffee, and tasted fresh and crisp. The more recent one I drank had strong overtones of this really off flavor. I think the coffee they used for this second yucky batch had gone stale... It's also possible the shelf life isn't so great (maybe the CO2 in carbonation can eventually cause the dissolved coffee to change composition and ""go stale""? I'm no expert in this, but it makes sense, C02 will stale beans so maybe...). It's also possible I was tasting tannins from cocoa nibs that had been steeped too long, but the taste and smell was so much like stale coffee, that's my primary hypothesis.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Bitter coffee is in the forefront of the nose, with bittersweet chocolate riding on it's coat tails. You get a lot of roast in the nose, promising great thing ahead.  Right out of the gates you are hit with loads of malt and black coffee bitterness. It's rich and a deep flavor that really coats your tongue, staying for quite a while. On the tail end you get the bittersweet chocolate notes, with hints of plums adding a very slight sweetness to the bitter, roasty beer. The roasted character comes roaring back in the final seconds of the beer, drying the finish somewhat, leaving you wanting more. Not once is the beers high ABV ever detected.  This is possibly the most viscous beer I've ever had the pleasure of partaking in. It's sticky, it fills the mouth and assaults your taste buds in a war of attrition like no other beer I've ever had.

Aroma: Smells like bitter dark chocolate, light roast coffee, mild cinnamon and malted grains. A gentle creamy, oatmeal smell blankets the entire aroma.  Taste: Bitter and dry upfront with flavors of black espresso, smokey, burnt toast, dark chocolate fudge, connecticut tobacco and hazelnut. There's a gentle resinous, spicy hop flavor in the background. Things gradually get sweeter as you work your way through the beer, as notes of oatmeal, vanilla beans, dairy creamer and caramel become more pronounced - however don't be mistaken, it is still quite a bitter beer - and at no time does the sweetness become dominant over the other bitter flavors.  Feel: Very filling and satisfying. Thick and viscous yet still paradoxically slugabble and drinkable. Hearty, very much like a meal in a glass. Low carbonation, heavy body. Alcoholic heat is slightly noticeable, but understated and actually very pleasant, providing a nice warming sensation as the beer goes down.  Overall Comments: Very enjoyable. A really nice presentation of flavors here ranging from nuts, to grains, to coffee, to chocolate, to hops, to spices... although it packs big flavor, it's intensity never really becomes taxing or exacerbating to the palate.

The beer poured with a nice tan head that dissipated quickly. The beer was almost black. It's a very appealing beer, looks wise. It smells of oak, chocolate, and bourbon. The more and more I smell this beer, bourbon just keeps popping out at me. I cannot really taste the coffee like most say they can. I can really taste chocolate, malt, and the light bitterness of bourbon as it is going down. An overall pleasant tasting beer with a smooth finish. The 8.3ABV helps the feels as well!

This one is good but overpowered by coffee and I am having to knock the rating down a bit from the lofty heights I was expecting to give this.   L: Pours a solid dark body, a little light does pass through so it is not as inky black as some. S: So, I am getting a strong coffee flavor - almost to the point of an espresso bean. If coffee isn't your cup of tea you aren't going to love this batch. Again I remember more depth of character in the last one I had. I enjoy the coffee smell. T: strong coffee and some oats. Alcohol is hidden in the beer very nicely. F: Really a well balanced feel to this beer. Medium carbonation that compliments the style well. O: A good stout. It just doesn't seem to be the world beater that I remember from the first batch that I had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

I then restrained myself to let it warm up to get all the flavors.  Bottled 8/12/2016.  Poured into a Tulip glass.  Smooth dark pour, a finger’s worth of head, khaki color. After diminishing, rim head lasted throughout the tasting. Rim head? Is that accepted terminology? ha.  Smells are coffee, malts, and cocoa.  Taste of bitter sweet chocolate, coffee, malts, and caramel upfront. Finishes/lingers with bitter coffee and chocolate  Mouth is a full bodied feel, smooth, and light carbonation.

1199,11757,jaketaz,4.53,"I got to drink this within a few days of AleSmith Speedway Stout, and taste-wise the Speedway was the winner. They're both very fine and I'd be happy to have either one, but Speedway edges this one out in terms of flavor. Founders is heavier on roasted malt flavor and less chocolate or coffee, Speedway is heavier on chocolate/coffee, and sweeter, all made doubly impressive by the fact that it's 12% abv yet tastes smoother than this Founder's to my palate. They're dead even in terms of feel and appearance, the Founder's is the clear winner for aroma though. Speedway is bitter and metallic, whereas Founders has maybe the best coffee stout aroma of any beer I've ever experienced. This is definitely a top-tier stout and worthy of all the accolades, also cheaper than Speedway, but on taste alone I prefer the AleSmith.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Whosonfirst,3.31,What happened to my favorite beer! Just bought the newest release of Founders Breakfast stout from my local total wine. Bottling date on the case was 8/12/2016. It's not breakfast stout. I don't know what they did to this but somebody got way too heavy handed with the Expresso in this batch. I had just finished up a Founders Sumatra coffee stout and was excited to crack open the new breakfast out. This batch tastes nothing like the breakfast stout I know and love! It taste more like an espresso roast stout heavy on the espresso. The Sumatra coffee has a very nice balance flavor. This batch of breakfast stout has an overwhelming coffee flavor that blocks out most of the rest of the taste of the beer and leaves a strong espresso aftertaste. I bought an entire case at total wine and it's all going back. Hopefully somebody at the brewery is paying attention to their knitting and won't repeat this mistake in subsequent batches.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,m_hall,4.77,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (dated 9/8/15) into a Tulip. Inky-black, topped by a 1-finger tall khaki head with good retention. Lacing all the way down the glass is very good.  Nose has prominent notes of black coffee, cocoa, and sweet malts.  Flavors feature sweet caramel malts, molasses, and brown sugar, balanced extremely well with bittersweet chocolate up front. Coffee bitterness, toasted nuts and earthy notes come in later on, leading to a finish that lingers with coffee and cocoa on the palate.  Mouth-feel is medium heavy, a big beer but surprisingly easy to drink. Full-bodied but not quite as crushingly weighty as other stouts; very smooth and satisfying without being overwhelming. Carbonation is fairly light, and the alcohol provides a pleasantly soothing warmth without ever being boozy.  A much-ballyhooed beer that delivers on the hype, big time. All the flavors are remarkably balanced, with different notes coming in and out of focus as the beer warms, and the nutty undertones and smooth body from the oatmeal only make this even more appealing. I suppose if someone didn't like coffee, or chocolate, or big malty stouts one might not be pleased with this one, but if any of those things are to your liking this might be in your wheelhouse.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The finish is of lingering coffee/chocolate with a mild alcohol hit but very very pleasant.

Flavors of roasted coffee, chocolate, dark roasted malts, and molasses-like sugars dance about and trade places with each sip. While it's mouthfeel is soft and velvety, it's not quite as heavy bodied as I would expect it to be.  To me, this beer has long been a trail-blazer, perhaps pioneer of it's time, and definitely a game-changer in the beginning years of the craft beer boom. It's still a solid offering, the only difference between now and 10 or so years ago is there is now a lot of competition, some better than this.

1199,11757,911CROFT,4.4,"355ml bottle into an oversized tulip. Paid £4.00 for a single bottle.  Pours an opaque, black, oily body, that audibly glugs from the bottle, revealing slight glimmers of ruby as it catches the light. A dense, one-finger in height, dark tan coloured, creamy head fades quickly to a thin cap and sturdy collar, leaving behind light, soapy lace.  The nose is dominated by freshly ground, dark roasted espresso beans. Underneath, a robust mixture of dark roasted malts, milk and dark chocolate, hints of oats and traces of creamy vanilla are prominent, but play only supporting roles in comparison to the coffee. Taste roughly follows suit, leading with intense, full-bodied, dark roasted coffee profiles upfront, sweetened slightly by milk chocolate and light oatmeal impressions. Around the mid-palate, roasted barley, darker bittersweet chocolate and hints of vaguely fruity malt follow, before coffee builds once again towards the finish. In the mouth, a medium to full-body and appropriately low levels of fine carbonation give a luxuriously rich and slick feel, with the addition of oatmeal noticeably assisting a wonderfully silky-smooth, creamy texture. Towards the end, suggestions of earthy, woody hops are swallowed by plenty of bittersweet dark chocolate, espresso beans and dark roasted malts to finish dry on the palate, with only a hint of alcohol warmth.  Overall this is a fantastic beer. Undoubtedly the majority of the flavour is dominated by that of the coffee and chocolate it is brewed with, but, both additions are incredibly well-balanced and neither one is allowed to step too far above the other. The roasted malt profile underneath may not be hugely complex, but it's dark, rich and robust enough to provide a fantastic background for the two main elements to shine.

Maybe some 90%+ dark chocolate, but that's its olfactory neighbor.  Whoa. The taste is intense. I literally licked down in front of my teeth to make sure there weren't any coffee grounds stuck in my gums. Just a reaction. Unfortunately, I'm struggling to get anything but slightly bitter coffee, even as it warms up. It's not burnt, which brews like this can sometimes be. And it's certainly good, but I'm only going to go for the rest of the bottles in the four-pack when I'm in the mood.  Feel is pretty smooth for an eight-percenter.

The strong hoppy, molasses taste was not my favorite. Though the coofee flavors were good it left a bitter aftertaste for me.

Not being a fan of very bitter beers I was very pleasantly surprised that in spite of it being toward the higher IBU range there was a nice balance, probably due to the oats used, so the bitterness didn't overshadow all the other marvelous flavors.

Go figure.  Nose is faint but rich coffee and dark chocolate come through. Good flavours, just wouldn't mind them asserting themselves a little better.  Flavour takes those notes and runs. Rich creamy dark chocolate and silky black coffee drive this whole thing, weaving in and out of one another wonderfully. Body is just the light side of heavy and oily/silky smoothe.  This is what it says it is, that is if it says that it is good shit. Because this is good shit. From @WesMantooth's awesome NBS BIF #3 box.

I think the hops and roasted malts do a great job hiding the 8.3 abv. Not overly sweet and surprisingly easy to drink for the high alcohol content.

1199,11757,captaincoffee,4.25,"10 oz pour at Craft Beer Co, Covent Garden. Key, not cask. Pours pretty much black with a super-solid tan head. I could have placed a pound coin on this head and it would have held for a couple minutes. Lacing sticking all over. Nose is very mild compared to expectations. A bit fruity...like the fruity coffee notes from varietals like Kenya AA and Ethiopian Yirgacheffe...and some ice coffee. Bit not a lot. Taste is better, with the initial feeling of sweetness (probably more from the heavy mouthfeel) fading to dry, almost ashy, with lots of coffee on the finish. Coffee/ashy notes last a while. Mouthfeel is heavy. Carbonation is a bit high for the style IMO. Overall, a very good beer, but I don't rate it quite as high as some. It is extremely close to a homebrew I make, which may make it less exciting/different to me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Terpinator,4.79,"Breakfast of champions! Looks as thick as a milkshake. Very aromatic with complex coffee, chocolate, and oat smell and taste.

1199,11757,MichaelT86,5,"So, this beer and you are going to have a good relationship if you both go into it with a good understanding of what each is bringing. This is not a beer to pound back on a hot summer day after mowing the lawn, it is not hoppy, it is not light nor bright. Those things are at times great, and if that's what you're looking for you're going to likely hate this beer. HOWEVER, if you want a thick cloudy, unctuous stout that packs a ton of flavor, then you're in for a good time. It's thick, velvety on the tongue and incredibly flavorful. It's at that ""border-line meal replacement"" level for a beer.  If you're doing breakfast for dinner it makes a nice replacement for a cup of coffee. That should give you a good idea of the intensity of the drink.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,mgwagman,5,"Easy to find and reasonably priced unlike 3 Floyds here. Grocery stores have it even. Pours a dark coffee color with excellent lacing. Most times will just drink it from the bottle and drink it fast as I cannot get enough. Tastes like excellent coffee, and dark chocolate (slight toffee and caramel notes with a little oatmeal). Predominately coffee and chocolate. I honestly could drink this when I wake up! Have to say this is one of the best beers I have ever had.  Frankly this is the cat's meow, the shizzle for my nizzle, or a like a great lay. Usually I will drink one to two of these beers at a time always wanting to drink more of it. Once and only once did I drink four in rapid succession going into the City of Chicago on Metra (yes they let you drink on the train which is strange since I am from Indiana and even though I left that state 15 years ago I still feel like I might get arrested for drinking on Metra it just still feels strange). After four of these beers I felt absolutely fantastic. My buzz or drunken haze was perfect. My burps were chocolate and coffee notes and a wonderful full feeling as if I had a great meal when I did't eat much that day. It also isn't overly filling for a Stout. This is probably one of the best beers made by anyone, and that I have had or will have (I just cannot say anything about his beer is wrong. It's liquid courage or a complete diet.  My father who never really drank in 72 years of life, who I have only seen drunk 2 times (with one large Sapporo in Las Vegas (the first time) and a strong Irish Coffee the second time (I am 42 and I have only seem drink a handful of times) drank this beer in 5 minutes and immediately wanted more. He was begging me to find out where to buy this and immediately ran out and bought some. Mind you this is a person who rarely if ever drinks.

The palate smacks of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, baking cocoa, caramel, burnt toast, oats, and dark roasted coffee, lingering long into the finish of wood smoke, dark chocolate, and heavily roasted coffee.

Initially a thick two finger coffee brown head that dissipates to about a half finger then sticks around. Tons of brown lacing on the glass.  Smell is a pungent aroma of coffee and bakers chocolate. Some cocoa, plain oatmeal and alcohol undertones.  Sip. ... Taste is initially coffee - but its a thick coffee flavor like an espresso or cubano. Then as the flavors start to develop in your mouth it tastes like you took a bite of fresh oatmeal with chocolate and molasses in it. Rich, thick, decadent. There is a mild acidic bitterness at the end of the sip like black coffee. Bit of spice and alcohol on the aftertaste before you get that left with a rich chocolate oatmeal chip cookie flavor. ... Savor. Repeat.  Feel is incredible. Medium carbonation provides a tingle on the tongue initially. The beer itself - thick, roasty, and decadent.  This beer is amazing and it never gets old.

Bitterness offset by thick carmel malts, with chocolate and coffee mingling pleasantly.  Mouthfeel: thick, lasting, carbonation dissipates (but not fully) nicely after swishing. Sweet aftertaste of bitter chocolate, cocoa beans, bitter dark coffee beans in a newly-opened coffee bag.  Very smooth. 60 IBUs? Tastes like <30.

Well balanced beer, it never ceases to be bittersweet at the same time, but it starts mostly sweet and it finishes mostly bitter. Lots of roasted malts. A little boozy, vanilla, hints of molasses and prune. The aftertaste is very long, and chocolate-predominant. Thick mouthfeel, chewy, smooth, silky.

Highly savory and bitter, offset by a creamy, sweet undercurrent that fills the mouth and leaves a lingering, milky sweetness. The smoke flavor is a bit stronger than I'd like it, on an otherwise well-balanced and delicious beer.  F: Silky and thick with tightly structured bubbles.  O: Really big, bold and tasty.

Now I get some malts too, maybe a sweet dark fruit component. My problem with this is that I hate cold coffee. And I don't want to boil this beer. What can I say about it?

1199,11757,Sirwootalot,4.45,"Pours an oily almost-black, with a tinge of dark mahogany under bright light and a barely-there thin, oily cappuccino head. Smells like freshly-toasted split oatmeal, a pot of fresh coffee, and chocolate hazelnut candy.  There's a lot going on here, and it's all astoundingly tasty. The main flavor is thick, creamy, and heavy like a Vietnamese iced coffee, and the oats dominate the body. The finish is a riptide of blackstrap molasses with notes of potato starch, nutmeg, and a little black pepper giving way to an aftertaste of bitter cappuccino foam, nutella, and hashbrowns. The balance on this is just about perfect - no single element dominates, and each flavor is thick and hearty enough to make not one bit about this beer be underwhelming or watery.  This has been one of my favorites for a long time, but it's also been a while since I've had one. Yep, still freakin' awesome. It pairs well with all kinds of heavy high-calorie food, but right now I'm having it with Texas jalapeno chili and it's just stupid how well they work together.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,TheStoutLord,4.67,"L: Smooth pour, little head that thickens after you finish pouring the bottle. Head has a brownish coloration, very appealing for a stout. Solid black, can't see through this beer in the least bit.  S: The smell is a little unremarkable. You can get hints of the chocolate/coffee flavor, but its mostly the roasted malts that come through. A good smell, subtle, but nothing that jumps out to grab you at first. This is probably one of the few beers that has its looks get your attention more than the smell.  T: What can I say. The roasted combination of the classic stout flavors is second to none. Chocolate and coffee and cereal malt all work together in the brew to create the quintessential stout. Truly the best in class. Flavor is consistent and powerful from front to back, from first sip to last.  F: Smooth as anything, but certainly not a beer to drink quickly. Its thick enough to float a spoon on and it feels like that in your mouth. The smooth, slightly alcoholic element sticks in your mouth, but not in a bad way at all.  O: My favorite beer. I save it for special occasions, mostly in the winter.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Harrison8,4.52,"Pours black with a medium-thin dark creme/motor oil head. Little to no lacing. Notes of cocoa nibs and coffee in the head of the aroma with an alcohol smell base. Roasted malts notes open up the flavor palette, and then flow into a series of cocoa nibs and coffee. Great ebb and flow of flavors. Each flavor can be picked up quite easily compared to some beers. Mouth feel is fantastic. Very rich and smooth. It's a pleasure to drink. Overall, this is a phenomenal beer (as the ratings show). I first had it some time ago when I was asking around for the ""best coffee stouts"". I'm revisiting it a year later, and I'm glad I did. Plenty of great things going on with each sip.  Served in a 12oz snifter.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,SovereignGood,4.73,"Picked this up from WF as soon as it hit CA.  L: Deep, dark brown that is approaching pitch black with a nice half finger espresso colored head. Lacing is left on the glass as you sip. Looks like a full glass of freshly brewed coffee.  S: Immediately hit with coffee, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malt, maybe some caramel.  T: Really full black coffee flavor followed by a nice chocolate bitterness - some vanilla in there also. A roasty, dry-ish finish.  F: Nice, full bodied beer that suits a stout perfectly. Feels like silk.  Overall, this beer is awesome. There are few beers that I would comfortably buy a case of, but I just may have to go out and get one! Cheers.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,JMD,4.76,"A: Deep black with a small tan head that dissipated quickly even after a fairly aggressive pour.  S: Smells amazing! Rich and malty with big notes of chocolate and fresh ground coffee  T: Big toasted malt flavor. Chocolate and espresso are prominent with hints of tobacco and dark fruits. Just enough hops to balance it out.  T: Smooth and creamy, full bodied. Maybe a little light for the style  O: Fantastic beer! Not much more to say. There is a reason why its so highly rated, its one of the best beers around.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Thomas_Wikman,4.68,"I had it in a Trappist Goblet this evening. I like it very much.  (L) Very dark almost black with a thin tan head.  (A) Pleasant aroma coffee and chocolate  (T) Taste is dark chocolate, some coffee and some oat, and a hint of alcohol. Not too bitter.  (F) Nice moderate carbonation, a tad creamy, smooth and easy drinking.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,mynamewastakendamnit,4.57,"L: Pours very dark, almost a motor oil black but in the light you can see a slight red tinge to it while it pours. But once it's in the glass, it's just an impenetrable black. Only about a quarter of a finger of brown head, even after a pour down the middle. It dissipates pretty quickly too, but an outer ring remains that offers pretty decent lacing.  S: Coffee and malts mostly. A small bit of alcohol in there as the head dissipates.  T: Heavy on the coffee and the dark chocolate up front. Towards the back end, buscuity malts and a really nice hint of oats. Alcohol is also definitely present, it's not overpowering or anything but it's there. Flavors are very pronounced and very delicious.  M: Medium mouthfeel, really smooth. Very light carbonation. As you swirl it around and the head comes back a little it gets noticeably creamier for me. Really well balanced on this end.  O: Solid beer. Very good taste, not too overwhelming but pretty strong and forward. Balanced and smooth mouthfeel. Aside from the head which goes away too soon, it's really nice looking in a glass. A bit alcoholic at times (on some sips more than others) but for such a high ABV beer it's not so bad. Definitely a high quality and easy drinking beer, I'd recommend this for anybody who enjoys stouts.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Mike_Aguirre,4.91,"Pours deep black, with a brown foam head, almost no retention. Aroma is of roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruits, alcohol.

I can see the potential, but for now I'll stick with Old Rasputin as my stout of choice.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BrokenEdge,4.54,"Poured into a pint glass. Beer pours super thick and dark, almost like maple syrup, and settles in the glass black with a tan head. Head dissipated fairly quickly but left a thin ring of foam that never fully went away and TONS of thick, heavy lacing. Smell and taste both have huge flavors of dark coffee, some bitter chocolate, and faint alcohol. Feel is especially impressive; it's super smooth, creamy, and thick. Very easy to drink despite the big, bold flavors. Definitely one of the best stouts I've tried yet.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smells of cold brew coffee, dark chocolate, a slight alcohol scent, along with a pleasant mocha scent. Taste reflects the smell. Coffee and dark chocolate galore! Initial coffee flavor and bitterness leads into dark chocolate flavors that finish with a lingering chocolate bitterness. Feel is thick, creamy, which works great with the heavy flavors.

1199,11757,vikinggary28,4.34,"I've heard or read nothing but good reviews about this stout so when seeking it out and eventually finding it here in California's central valley I tried not to let preconceived ideas cloud my judgment of this brew. That being said it pours a very dark, dark brown, practically black with a thin light brown head and some lacing. The aroma hits you of dark coffee with every other imaginable malt character. Chocolate, oatmeal, and biscuits are also prevalent in the taste but so does the alcahol aftertaste that does not last. This is a great after dinner sipping beer in my opinion or one that can be enjoyed with a heavy BBQ especially with beef or pork. You could even enjoy this with a ice cream dessert. I'm glad I finally found this and the baby on the label rivals the Gerber baby as the best in all the history of product marketing.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Czequershuus,3.92,"This beer pours a solid black with a modest head. The aroma that hits first is the smell of fresh ground coffee, like walking into a coffee shop early in the morning. There are also notes of oak, smoke, cinnamon, and burnt toast. The flavor starts with coffee grounds as well, with smokey, roasty notes rounding out the flavor with a subtle bitterness. The mouthfeel is full but not overly thick. This was not my first time trying this beer, and I must say I liked it much more this time, but it is still not beer I would go out of my way for. In terms of strenght of coffee flavor, this one is up there, and the dryness of the flavor is excellent, but it is not a very moreish beer for me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

If side pour than head is barely noticeable. S- chocolate and coffee. Strong smell. T- distinct chocolate, coffee and malt in that order. Chocolate more than anything and lots of it along with lots of coffee. Aftertaste is all chocolate. F- syrupy and mildly heavy. Not as heavy as I was expecting, but its still a double chocolate oatmeal stout so don't expect to need more than 2. It will fill you up. O- excellent beer one of my all-time favorite.

Two finger head with decent retention, leaves slight lacing and a cap.  S: Coffee, cocoa, malt but can't really pull oats out of it.  T: Taste tends to follow nose: Coffee is dominant, followed by unsweetened chocolate. Malt backbone. A tiny bit of alcohol at end, but not offputting.  F: Medium bodied, light carbonation. Neither sticky nor overly dry. Very well balanced.  O: As always, this is very, very solid.

1199,11757,charlzm,3.71,"Consumed on January 19th, 2016. Poured from a bottle dated 09/04/15 into a tulip at 55 degrees F.  Moderate pour produces a three finger tan head. Settles down soon into a thick skin with plenty of lacing. Beer itself is deep opaque brown, bordering on black.  Aroma is coffee grounds and wet pennies. Something went wrong, it seems.  Flavor is slightly lactic with a dash of sourness up front. Coffee comes on strong along with bitter chocolate. Slightly acidic finish with a hint of oatmeal (more in the mouthfeel than on the palate). A little alcohol heat and flavor as well.  Speaking of mouthfeel, this beer is medium-bodied with an acrid bite, offset by oatmeal smoothness. That sharp edge fades soon, but is unpleasant on the first few sips.

Regardless, it was a nice thick, black, full bodied stout with a nice balanced flavor. Chocolate and coffee were delicious, and there's almost no sign of the alcohol.  Update: Just opened a bottle with 6 months on it that was aged in less than ideal conditions. The result is an odd smell that is kind of soapy. However, the taste is still very good. Tons of chocolate, coffee and its bitterness arriving later, good creamy oatmeal base.  The body is not huge, but its oily and smooth.

I have had this stout before and am a big fan. I decided it was time for a review.  It is very dark, almost black, with a nice dark tan head.  To my nose, it had a heavy coffee aroma, which is not a bad thing at all.  Taste: Wonderful. Taste of chocolate, coffee, just the right amount of sweetness, that has just a touch of bitterness that suits this brew well.  It is nice and smooth with an ample body. It is one of my top oatmeal stouts.

Smell: Heavy, bitter roast. Coffee and oat-forward. Darkness pervades. Coffee is really prominent on the nose.  Taste: Roasty, sweet arrival, transitions to a somewhat sweet and surprisingly resinous hop-driven bitterness almost immediately, then a robust malt-driven bitterness of roasted barley, oats, coffee and baking chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Lighter side of full-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Only slightly slick.  Overall: Wow. This is a really excellent coffee and oat-forward roasty stout. It definitely lives up to the hype. Alcohol is totally hidden. 4-pack worthy. This is to stouts what Sumatra is to coffees - dark and dirty - but in a good way. Had they not said this was Sumatra in this, it probably would have been my first or second guess. Layers of dark roastiness with a really surprising layer of hop presence.

1199,11757,Sabtos,4.03,"Black with a thick, fluffy tan head.  Big coffee and chocolate aromas waft off this brew when fresh. Fresh is key, because the coffee dies off quickly with older bottles--I learned this the hard way: do not age this beer unless you want a sub-par, plain and bitter stout.  Taste of coffee comes through powerfully, with some bitterness, but also a smooth texture with a rounding sweet, dark chocolate element.  FBS is nicely dry, with heavily roasted malt that gets more powerful as it warms, almost becoming smokey. With a fresh, perfect mix of chocolate, coffee and roastiness, and a round, soft tangy body, this is quite a tasty classic.

In fact, his is really good because it is so balanced. Not too sweet or bitter, refreshing. It is still heavy and has a desertish after-taste, but it is, for what it is, as good as it should be (and maybe could be).

I think I have to agree with dkanakis that there was a slight metallic taste and could be a batching issue.  However the 4th bottle I had was absolutely lovely. Soon as I popped it open I instantly got hit with cocoa, and a pleasant burnt coffee smell and the taste and feel was vastly improved. Sadly being the odd one out in the batch I have to rate off of the other three. If the entire batch had been like that one would have likely given this a 4.75 if not a 5 overall.  All four had a similar look pouring extremely black with a finger sized creamy caramel colored head with very heavy lacing.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

This is not like drinking motor oil, which the majority of stouts are leaning towards these days. It is rather crisp, with moderate amount of carbonation and an underlying bitterness. The taste is all about the coffee! It's toasty, citrusy, roasted, and almost creamy. Unsweetened chocolate notes as well as some of the oatmeal can be found to round out the sip.  Again, I am a little surprised on the rather light feel and citrus notes playing through on this one. It's a very solid stout and drinks very easily. Always worth a taste each year.

1199,11757,OldManMetal,4.47,"This imperial stout is brewed with chocolate, oats and coffee; it is black as sin and completely impervious to light, showing dark chocolate highlights only at the very edges. The thin, slightly-pebbly brown head quickly decays to a collar and a haze, but it leaves excellent sheets and ladders of the most finely-grained lacing imaginable. On the nose, it is very assertive: a whiff of oatmeal up front, then a strong, luxuriously complex dark chocolate with hints of toffee and more than a hint of alcohol. The palate is slightly sweet dark malt goodness; again, the chocolate is the star, every bit as nuanced as it is on the nose, with toffee playing a supporting role. The finish is boozy toffee, followed by a slightly bitter chocolatey roasted flavor that lingers for a few minutes. The big mouthfeel matches the full body, and the texture is stickily creamy and very slightly peppery from the relatively soft carbonation. This is how chocolate stout is done.

Hints of chocolate hiding behind that. So much complexity. Smells like it belongs with breakfast. Taste: Bitter, dark coffee again at the front, with chocolate and roasty flavors behind it, even a little maple.

1199,11757,thebeers,4.3,"Near black with a finger of mocha-colored head that dissipates quickly, but leaves vertical columns of lacing. Strong aroma of coffee and milk chocolate. This year's (2015) has a more coffee-forward taste than I remember, with big roasted flavors and just a little cream and chocolate in the background, as well as a bitter finish that manages to avoid being acerbic. The flavors meld and the whole thing becomes much more smooth as it warms. Creamy mouthfeel with just enough carbonation. Amazing beer. A classic.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Pours a thick, jet back color with a tan colored, 1 finger head.  Smells of dark roasted malts, chocolate, coffee... if only it taste as good as it smells...  ... AND IT DOES. The COFFEE!!! and chocolate roasted malts (and oats to boot!) float around in your mouth while a bit of bitterness from the hops bites the back of your tongue.  This beer is thick in feel and flavor!  Worth a four pack... or a case or two!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,HiWire,4.25,Pours deep black. 1 finger head of tan that receeds quickly. Smells malty and strong coffee bean with some chocolate. I'm not a coffee drinker but this tastes like what I imagine a delicious coffee tastes like at Starbucks. Strong on the coffee taste but sweeter elements balance it. mouthfeel is thin but intense leaving bitterness. Smooth carbonation. I get it.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,taxandbeerguy,4.57,"12 oz bottle served just above fridge temperature into a tulip.  Appearance - black as night and covered with a thick finger of tan head. Retention is good but not great. Some lacing left behind.  Smell - so much coffee! Hints of oatmeal, dark chocolate, some light smokey aromas, but in the end it comes back to coffee. Like freshly used coffee grains right after making a pot of it. Nose is so aromatic I can almost taste coffee before my first sip. Spectacular.  Taste - again the coffee shows up in ridiculous force, but it is accompanied by a little bit of chocolate and oat like flavor. The bitterness is strong but not overwhelming, just right in its delivery.  Mouthfeel - so smooth and incredibly creamy, silky like velvet rolling down your throat. Body is thick, but not overwhelmingly so and finish is succulent. Great feel.  Overall - Ok so I admit I was curious about all the hype for Founders Breakfast Stout. It's not accessible in Ontario and usually beers with this much hype do deliver, but for some reason, I just wasn't sure. So glad I picked up a 4 pack and may need to come back and pick up another back for a ""breakfast for dinner"" themed party coming up soon. Just an awesome beer and the coffee explosion is real with this one.  Edit - April 2, 2017. I don't often go across the border to venture in the States. But when I do, I damn well make sure to get a 4 pack of this, because well, life is better with coffee stouts that have this much flavor and deliciousness, this much intensity yet every sip leaves you wanting to drink more and more and... well ""beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy"" quote that is attributed (rightly or wrongly to Ben Franklin) certainly applies here. I can't think of a reason to be unhappy while sipping on one of these glorious coffee stouts. Just try it; unless you hate coffee you won't be let down. And as a a final reminder; there's a reason why as of this writing more than 16,000 enthusiasts have endorsed this beer as as one of the best in the world, more than any other on this site. Surely 16,000 individuals who love and care about beer couldn't be wrong about this one, could they?",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Bonkinishwa,4.46,"Founders Brewing Company - Breakfast Stout. 8.3% ABV. 12oz bottle poured into duvel glass.  Look: Pitch black, like used motor oil, allowing no light to pass through. Non aggressive pour yielded small dark tan head, that dissipated fairly quickly, leaving thick lacing of the same color that remained throughout.  Smell: Strong roast coffee, dark bitter chocolate, and toasted oats. Very strong smelling, but not overpowering.  Feel: Rich and creamy all the way, balanced by carbonation.  Taste: Bitter coffee and toasty flavor, accompanied by hints of dark chocolate. Back end tastes strongly of rich coffee. As it warms up, the alcohol taste is noticeable, but blends well with the rich flavors; the burn is very minor.  Overall: I have heard a lot of great things about this beer, so I picked up a 4-pack to try. I was not disappointed. Great tasting, not overpowering, and a rich and creamy feel makes it live up to its reputation of being great. However the batch I got was very fresh, and I have heard that its a little better aged a few months. After trying some aged, I will update the review accordingly.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,SD-Alefan,4.56,"Pours a deep, dark, opaque brown with a dark tan head. The aroma is loaded with dark chocolate, a hint of coffee and vanilla and some char. On my tongue, the chocolate flavors lead the way, deep and dark, followed by a rather sweet middle and a slightly acidic roast coffee finish. A nice lingering bitter with a bit of nuttiness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium-thick and fairly smooth. Outstanding.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Chris_Huston,4.65,"This 2015 bottle release pours near-black color and foams up a modest, light-leather head. The smell is like super-coffee -- strong, but also sophisticated. Couldn't really detect the chocolate or any oatiness, but they add dimension and richness. Still, it's that slightly-smokey coffee that dominates, making it not only an easy ""breakfast""/morning celebration, but ironically smells and tastes like it'd be at home at an evening dinner/table party.  If I'm going to nitpick, the feel is maybe not as heavy or creamy as I would like or expect -- slight wateriness keeps it from being perfect, though not detracting. One could also ask for more distinct presence in the attending flavors, being a ""Breakfast"" stout, but I'd hate to mess with this coffee showcase. ABV hits quick, too! and harder than its ~8% suggests. Absolutely in my cellar of fame beers.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Poured into a tulip with a nice ~2 inch head, pitch black brew and a dark tan head like the crema on an espresso that leaves a ring around the liquid. Smells of dark roasted coffee, malt, baker's chocolate, with coffee ruling them all. As to be expected of an imperial stout, it's got a big body and sticky mouth feel, but not too big, and not too sticky. The finish sticks in your mouth just long enough to remind you why you want another sip. There's a brief sharpness on the tongue near the finish that might just be hop, but it's hard to say. Whatever that is, it keeps this stout from becoming sickeningly sticky, and the immense coffee prevents it from getting too sweet. Great brew that deserves at least some of the hype surrounding it.

1199,11757,Zaktcc,4.44,"A - Pours a beautiful dark brown/black color with 2 1/2 finger, coffee colored head. Great head retention with a lot of lacing present.  S - Smells like the bottle preaches. Coffee, chocolate and even a mild note of oatmeal. Of the three, I feel coffee is the most prominent aroma.  T - To start, I'm not a huge coffee fan though I am a huge stout fan. I was expecting an overwhelming taste of chocolate yet was surprised that coffee was the dominant flavoring; yet in a good way. The coffee flavoring is well subdued by the chocolate though. The stout lives up to its name and overall I'm very pleased!  M - Full bodied, thick and creamy beer. Fairly bitter feel due to the coffee bean. Alcohol is present but very very mild. Very pleasant.

Smell: Some coffee but the nose is nothing special. Taste: Dominated by chocolate with some coffee. Whatever coffee they used it's nothing like the beans used by Drakes (Blue bottle in their Jolly Rodgers) and Cellarmaker (Sightglass in their Coffee and Cigarettes), or even Modern times who source and roast their own beans. Feel: It's carbonated right and has almost the perfect mouthful. Overall: As an old school stout, pretty good.

Dark roast malt is huge and coffee is there too.  Flavor is dominated by coffee with chocolate less present than expected.

T -- Coffee and chocolate are the major players, as to be expected. They push and pull at each other, alternating who leads, sometimes dancing together in mocha unison. The chocolate is sometimes quite bitter, other times smooth and embraces the tongue.  F -- Luscious and decadent. Full bodied, light carbonation. The alcohol provides a warmth that is welcomed and pleasant. Chewy, velvety, I mean damn, just pick a word. The feel is absurd and exactly what I'd want from a stout.  O -- I understand why this one is rated so highly. It's a very well developed stout that hits many of the spots I want from one.

O: One of my all-time favorite imperial stouts. It’s got a very nice aroma and a heavenly mouthfeel, all at a relatively moderate abv making it very drinkable for the style.

1199,11757,LAp,4.53,"12oz bottle. Pours a dark brown/black with a mocha head. Coffee and chocolate on the nose that carry though on the palate. In terms of imperial stouts, this one leans more heavily into a consistent flavor profile of chocolate and coffee and avoids the variance/complexity of those that add more dark fruit and bitterness.

The nose was heavy coffee and roasted malts.  Flavor was intensely bitter early, but the coffee flavor was like wet grounds with peppery vegetal notes. I'm waiting for this to warm a bit.  As the glass warms, it opens up. Rich espresso with some faint cacao on the finish. Was expecting more chocolate, as it seems the coffee overpowered it. A good beer, but slightly disappointed considering the hype.

1199,11757,jmasher85,4.62,"Drank this one at cellar temperature (taking advantage of the first beer brought up from cellar in my new house I just moved into!...hell yeah!!) Sadly, I am drinking this one in the shadow of KBS and CBS, which were both awesomer versions of the same thing, albeit a hell of a lot harder to come by, so this one gets extra points for availability. Pours black as mud and tastes like it means business, as it should. Picture a hot coffee and toast breakfast with some fancy chocolate-covered raisins or something for dessert on a winter day, and this is what that would taste like in beer form...really boozy beer. Lacking the overwhelming sweetness of CBS and that addicting gritty texture and oaky taste of KBS, but featuring the boozy strength and basic flavor profiles of both, this is a fantastic mid-range stout. Easily delicious enough to be worth spending a few bucks more on a 4-pack, compared to a sixer of something less amazing. Seriously, if it weren't for my insatiable quest to drink every beer I can, this would be one of my go-to regular buys. Total desert island beer, except that it would probably kill me by the end of the 3rd day on that island. Only complaint is that I think a heavier carbonation and thick head would go quite nicely with this one - it's virtually fizzless.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Aroma bitter coffee and chocolate, 2014 keg but very fresh and pungent. Taste follows, coffee, chocolate, very bitter. Thin but appropriate for the abv level. Smooth finish.  My only complaint is the last 8 oz of 32 gets very palate weary, and frankly, a bit annoying. Still a great beer, but I generally prefer just one 12 oz bottle. And I definitely prefer fresh Wake n Bake which I'll drink all winter and into early spring. But sometimes you just gotta have a Breakfast Stout. Now that thinking about it, I want another.

I find that waiting another month or two helps to bring some of the other flavors more to the fore.

No syrupy flavor, it maintains the same bite as any 5% alcohol stout. That burnt grain taste is so tasty that you just can't stop drinking it.

Smell- Roasted dark chocolate. Roasted coffee beans.  Taste- Freshly roasted coffee first hits the palate, retaining coffee like bitterness early on in the flavor profile. Next comes a layer of dark chocolate with a roasted/smoked quality as well. Finishes sweet with a molasses/syrup flavor carrying along some residual bitterness from the coffee and chocolate undertones.  Mouthfeel- Heavy in body, low carbonation but fresh to the palate. Thick.  Overall- A fine stout. A bit lacking in the chocolate flavor considering it says ""double chocolate"" on the label. This is more of a coffee forward stout.

1199,11757,woemad,4.4,"12oz bottle courtesy of LehighAce06. My first Founders beer. According to the label, it was bottled on October 27, 2014.  Poured into a Jones Radiator nonic pint glass, the pour was a viscous dark brown, and gave up nothing when held up to direct light. Big, creamy mocha-colored head that took it’s time dropping. There was a beer-neglige style band of thin foam around the top of the glass, with spotty and streaky lace scattered about pell-mell.  There was dark roast coffee, mollasses and chocolate in the nose, in that order.  Coffee, chocolate and molasses combine for a deep, velvety smooth embrace of the taste buds. While there is bitterness (60 IBUs worth, per the neck label), it’s more of a coffee bitterness, with hoppy bitterness seemingly way out on the periphery.  Full bodied, with a creamy, coating, velvety mouthfeel.  This is a decadent beer. If available in my neck of the woods, this would be a regular part of the cold weather lineup, and a nice dessert beer just about any time.

Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toasted oats, dark bread, light smoke/char, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee/chocolate, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toasted oats, dark bread, light smoke/char, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Good amount of roasted coffee and herbal hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toasted oats, dark bread, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee/chocolate, and earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible imperial coffee stout.

Flavor: Coffee flavor initially which transitions to milk chocolate and then back into coffee. There is a slight bit of alcoholic warmth. Roast flavors come through late and leaves a dry sensation. I imagine this is what coffee with a scoop of chocolate ice cream would taste like.  Mouthfeel: Medium. I expected slightly more body.  Overall: This was an enjoyable beer.

The feel is thick, but doesn't coat; it is smooth, but not nitro smooth. I've tried this a few times now and it just doesn't float my boat. The FBS is just a little too middle of the road for me.

Appearance: the standard dark black body that dares one to find daylight; brown, slushy head that settles quickly to a boggish texture; lacing forms in strong smears that hold steady.... Aroma: a welcoming brash punch of alcoholic spirits--bourbon, rum--with fresh hops pushing up earthy peat with strength...some cherry, cola, and dampened wood...the chocolate and coffee come late but round the experience nicely.... Palate: full-bodied and mega creamy; tickles the teeth with some happiness, only to crash the throat with a brick-like weight that doesn’t disturb the taste buds; for a stout, a lively amount of carbonation; reasonable, warm, slightly alcoholic finish....Taste: the chocolate mellows the coffee bean enough to make the two a happy marriage, with slightly citric fruits peaking at the start, in and amongst the malty, earthy aspects...rewarding and warming--again, a fitting beer to be had at the start (or the end of) a day--versatile in its power...Overall: a formidable, forceful beer that challenges the taste buds and rewards the palate; Founders continues to produce upper tier beers; this one from the break pack box leftovers--quite a find at $13.99 a twelve pack at Hope Liquors!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Myotus,4.32,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (bottled on 27Oct14) into a Spiegelau stout glass. Pours with a finger's worth of brown foam that dissipates into a line of khaki foam (nice color change in head) within 20 seconds. Black in color with ruby tint. Bubbles are subtle. Lacing is moderate. Has strong aromas of alcohol and coffee that combine with mild bitter and earthy chocolate aromas along with subtle oat ones. Initial taste is of mild coffee and subtle alcohol flavors (I'm glad the alcohol isn't as strong as it smells). Mild bittersweet chocolate flavors enter within about 3 seconds of initial taste along with subtle oat flavors however, both the flavors of the initial taste gradually grow stronger and persist well into the aftertaste. Light bodied, not very creamy for a stout, very little carbonation, but has a crisp finish.

S: Coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, oats, sweet bread, earthy hops, and hints of tobacco.  T: Chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts, oatmeal, tobacco. Earthy almost dirty hops provide a nice bitterness on the back end, and there is just enough of an alcohol burn to gently warm your insides.

This is just the most magnificently done stout you could ever hope for. Every time I enjoy one I fall in love with it even more.

1199,11757,porter_collie,4.69,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into brandy snifter  A - Pours a deep, rich mahogany. The head is thin and leaving little bits of lacing down the sides of the glass. Bits of taupe bubbles swirl on top of the beer like an oil slick.  S - Roasted perfection, though not overpowering. The notes of cocoa and espresso meld perfectly with root beer and caramel.  T - As opposed to the restrained nose, the flavor is robust as hell. However, it is also remarkably nuanced. The cold-press coffee smoothly blends with dark chocolate. The malt is reasonably sweet but not cloying - almost like a really, really good chocolate doughnut. There is also earthy spice similar to cinnamon, caramel richness, and a slight rum kick on the end. The lingering taste is smooth and full of sumptuous coffee and cocoa.  M - As with KBS, the mouthfeel is liquid perfection. The oatmeal lends an impeccable silky mouthfeel that envelopes the palate in a glutinous bear hug. Carbonation is light and spot-on.  O - Founders proves they are one of the world's masters of dark malty beers. One of the best coffee beers going. So supremely balanced it stymies the senses into blissful chocolate and coffee submission. However, I must say I like Founders' Porter and KBS (duh) better. It's probably a deadheat between this and their Imperial Stout, too. But that is not meant as a slight - this is an awesome beer.

Mouthfeel: This is a big, sturdy stout with a lot of body to it, but it's also viscous and smooth, possibly owing to the oatmeal. Perfect depth for a big stout.  Overall: A triumph! That's hardly an overstatement. This beer rules.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,LagerCognoscenti,4.51,"355ml bottle into duvel tulip. First time I've seen this in the UK. Have seen it so often on WBAYDN thread that I had to buy it.  Jet black with a thin head leaving decent lacing.  Aroma is of leather, coffee and roasted malt.  The taste has hints of bitter chocolate, coffee and lots of sweetness. There is some black treacle and toffee in there. This one really coats the tongue and the taste lingers for quite a while. It a very complex and strong tasting beer. There is some warming alcohol and the 8.3% makes its presence felt. This reminded me of Great Divide Yeti - pretty much the only other American stout of this type I've tried.  The feel is very creamy and rich. The oatmeal may be responsible for this.  Overall this is really an outstanding beer. It's very tasty and could have you appreciating different elements of its quality every time you try it. Truly satisfying.  94/100",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,do_ob,4.42,"Bottle marked ""Bottled 09/02/2014"". Sampled and reviewed on March 6, 2015.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Pours pitch black with a fizzy 1 finger head of light brown foam. Head quickly dissipates into a streaked film across the top of the beer. Smells of chocolate, dark fruit, coffee, ginger, and caramel. Nice, heavy body on this one. Feels very thick and creamy. I get chocolate, maple syrup, grapes, butterscotch, and loads of malt. Very sweet and smooth all the way through. Aftertaste is pretty much the same as the initial taste. This beer lingers for a while.  Overall..f'ing amazing brew. As delicious as anything I've ever had. This beer has everything and everything you could ask for in an imperial stout. This is tied with Blot Out the Sun for the best beer I've ever had. They taste very similar so I can't decide which is better. But this beer is far easier to get, for me at least. I'll be buying these every chance I get and cellaring quite a few to enjoy next winter. -------------------------- Update 10/02/2015. After months of searching, I tracked down a couple 4 packs of this mofo to enjoy once again, and to revisit. It's been nearly 6 months since I've had this one, so let's see if it's as good as I remember...  A: Pours an incredibly dark, rustic brown. 1 finger of dense, creamy tan colored foam. Black as coal in the glass.  S: Chocolate, roasted malt, HUGE oat aroma, dark fruit, coffee, vanilla..damn. Smells like heaven. Better than I remember.  T: Charred/roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, oats, vanilla..What complexity. Choclatey coffee grounds initially, which quickly fades into a sweet, roasty malt. This, in turn, transitions into a soft, chewy oat/vanilla/lactose flavor.  F: Infinitely creamy. Smooth as silk and as dense as tar. Ok, maybe not, but this beer is incredibly chewy and satisfying. Perfect weight for the 8% -10% range of beers. Finishes so smooth it's not even funny.  O: I honestly wanted to re-review this one because my initial assessment was written only weeks after I'd 'gotten into' craft beer, so to speak. Surely my score was overly-biased. No way. And while I'm not claiming to be a veteran in this ever-changing beer world, I can say this: 7 months and 208 beer reviews later, this beer is still worthy of the score I gave it the first time around.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,hoptheology,4.12,"Edit : After having a couple dozen of these, I feel I'm well acquainted with the beer. My general opinion is this : If you are a coffee lover, drink it fresh.  If you prefer the chocolate and oatmeal, age it AT LEAST 10 months, if not a year. Between 12-14 months is the PRIME, PRIME time to have this beer if that's what you're looking for. The following is after 12 months of careful aging in the dark, upright.  Aromas of sweet milk chocolate, chocolate covered prunes, and cooked oatmeal.  Flavors are of bitter and milk chocolates, lactose, and oats.  Feel is syrupy and thick.  Age it in the dark for best results. I have adjusted the scores to reflect aging it a year.   ------------------------------------------------------ Oh my. A 100/100? Had to try this.  It looks : used motor oil coming out of the sump, or crude oil even, just beautifully black and obsidian. The head is a measles 1 finger but has a nice almond color to it. The body is completely a black hole, no light escaping.  It smells : Lots of coffee, some french silk pie, and cappuccino aromas. Lots of burnt malts as well.  It tastes : tons of dark burnt coffee with a backbone of scorched chocolate. This is very heavy on coffee and burnt roast malts, much less exciting than last years batch which had more chocolate, cookie dough, and oatmeal.  It feels : medium to heavy bodied but still easy to drink. The carbonation is buzzing and alive, but is still kept in check by the heavy roasted malt body which provides the creamy backbone.  Overall : A worthwhile stout and if you haven't tried it, you owe it to yourself. It's a nice stout, although not really one of my absolute favorites. I recently scored some 4 packs for $6.99 so that was worth purchasing. To be honest I Wouldn't be purchasing this left and right at full price, but if I ran out, I'd probably keep four on hand.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,maedhros09,4.76,"Look: Deep black with about an inch of fine dark tan frothy head that settles to a film and lacing.  Smell: Complex; organic (topsoil?), roasted malt, chocolate, vaguely metallic (iron oxide?), boozy  Taste: Following the smell, complex and mysterious. Moderate sweetness with roasty malt, metallic, murky chocolate, boozy, with bitter background that doesn't linger too long. Thick body with smooth mouthfeel.  Overall: Not the straightforward coffee and chocolate stout I was expecting. Rather it is a very distinctive and perplexing brew, with flavors that go beyond its breakfast ingredients. Earthy and pungent, sweet and smooth, it is certainly delicious. A beer to ponder over. Also I would note that I much prefer this to the Founders Imperial Stout, which suffers from excessive sweetness and bitterness.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,StoneTSR,4.31,"APPEARANCE: Very dark with only traces of red and brown light getting through at the very edges when held up to the light. The light brown head is stronger than expected, rising to a full finger and staying intact for a good 30 seconds. When it falls, though, it falls hard and leaves only a few traces; a ring of foam around the edges and a small mound that will not go away right in the middle. The etching on the bottom of the glass is enough to keep a bubble geyser flowing strong enough to keep a little lump mid-glass.  SMELL: The roast is apparent immediately and it overwhelms the hints of dark chocolate, tobacco and dark fruit.  TASTE: That roast is still all over this beer, but it is not overwhelming. Some aggressive hopping adds to the bitterness, but as the beer warms a big and delicious dark chocolate flavor becomes evident, as does a lot of caramel.  MOUTHFEEL: This is not a complex beer. It is a straight forward, in your face, big stout…and it is delicious. I can’t quite say this is medium in body, but it is on the lighter side of big than most stouts in this category. There is very little sparkle, but that adds to the creamy, smooth feel that allows it to go down incredibly easy.  OVERALL: What more can be said about this beer that hasn’t been already?

T - Absolutely amazing. Flavor development is sweet cream, caramel and chocolate, this fades into bittersweet baker's chocolate, finally, this fades into bitter, smokey malt and coffee. Fantastic.

More carbonation than I expected, which detracts from its smoothness. The sweetness of the chocolate flavor helps neutralize the bitterness of the coffee, but the bitterness wins out. Overall: A special beer and a great stout. My hat's off to somebody who starts his day with this one; for me, I'll save it for after dinner. Drink at closer to room temperature.

Smell - 4.5/5 Strong smells of coffee and cherry-flavored chocolate. Perhaps a tiny hint of alcohol and/or hops. Slightly sweet aroma.  Taste - 4/5 Earthy coffee, chocolate, hints of smokiness and hoppiness. A little bit of alcohol taste as well. I was expecting an amazing taste from this beer, and while it's very good, I think it may be a bit overhyped (but aren't most things in life?). I appreciate the discernable and possibly primary earthy coffee flavor (Sumatra coffeee tends to be more earthy if I remember correctly).  Mouthfeel - 4/5 Medium to full bodied. Very smooth, fairly creamy. There is a light to moderate amount of light to moderate carbonation.  Overall - 4/5 Given all the hype, I wanted to like this more that I actually did.

1199,11757,CoffeePorter,4.68,"As I was strolling down the aisle of my local package store I was startled when I came across this beer. I am a big fan of coffee porters and knew that Founders Breakfast Stout was rated as #1 and had a perfect 100 score.  I poured the beer into a 12 ounce glass and could observe no visible light pass through as it is completely black. Swirling the liquid around the glass it has a red amber like color on the bottom. There is a coffee tan in color lace around the edges.  Upon smelling it I detected traces of coffee and some notes of chocolate.  It tastes like a Doppelbock as it has a very full bodied flavor. I was expecting stronger coffee notes, but I was left somewhat disappointed. I can detect a slight coffee aftertaste with a hint of chocolate. One thing that immediately struck me was the alcohol as it left me feeling warm and wanting to dive in for another sip.  The beer is very smooth and almost silk like. There wasn't that much carbonation which made it easier to drink.  UPDATE: I've had this beer a few times since my original review and I have to bump it up a few points. It seems to be one of those beers that grows on you.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The first sip was loaded with flavor– very dark & bittersweet chocolate with oats in the background. A nice, subtle use of bready/doughy malts. Wow, there's a dark roast coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy and carbonated. Overall, I like the bitter and creamy qualities of this stout– a contrast to the many syrupy/sweet stouts out there. The control of the coffee flavor is incredible. In my opinion, much better than this year's BCBCS. Go Founders!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T: Immediately taste chocolate and coffee, and after it goes down it leaves very very strong oatmeal flavor with hints of maple syrup. F: Moderate carbonation, I was expecting it to be smoother, like a milky froth, but does not take away from the quality of the beer. O: 4.25. Great treating beer.

Creamy, sticky like syrup.  Overall: A good go to stout becoming more available in the Midwest.

The beer opens with dark chocolate and roasted flavors and a mild bitterness.

1199,11757,Buck1,4.76,"Christmas eve , got off work early , stopped at store for a bottle of wine and found 4 -4 packs of Breakfast Stout on sale. Boom , bought all . Merry Christmas to me. My favorite stout, had it before. Look: dark as a bottomless pit Smell: Coffee with dark chocolate, oak and maybe some fig Taste: dark slightly bitter chocolate to start, then some quality coffee, toasted malts and a little hop bitterness at the end, alcohol warmth is there but well hidden Feel: oats make it silky smooth but not to thick. Overall: a great sit by the fire on a winter day sipper that gets better as it warms up. And that is what I am doing now writing this review on a crappy cold day. I would like to cellar a couple of bottles for a year but I doubt I have the will power to not drink it. Best stout I have had.

Taste -Coffee and toasted malts up front, dark unsweetened chocolate, significant alcohol and fairly clean finish..  Mouthfeel – Medium body (close to whole milk), strong alcohol cleanses the palate and provides some twang and warmth.  Overall: If you enjoy coffee, you will enjoy this, complex and enjoyable.

Creamy mouthfeel and a powerful yet delicate balance of coffee and roasted malts. This beer certainly holds its own. You can drink the strongest IPA known to man, crack this Breakfast Stout open, and forget what Cascade or Citra hops even taste like… And by this I mean, it is powerful enough to look right in the face of an overly hopped beer and tell it to shut up and sit down. Don't get me wrong, I love a good IPA, but the powerful taste this beer brings is unforgettable and undeniable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Sleepy_Conscience,5,"Normally I don't like declaring one thing my ""favorite,"" be it a movie, a song, a book or whatever. My tastes just vary so much from year to year and even day to day. That said, Founders Breakfast Stout is my favorite beer. Hands down. It is the beer that got me into stouts. It is the beer that got me away from that devil drink called wine. It rekindled my love affair with craft brews, coffee and even the diseased whore's mitten that is the state of Michigan, a perpetual thorn in the side of common decency and God's favorite state in the Union, my home, the Buckeye state of Ohio.  Breakfast Stout saved my life.  Well no, not really, but it is very good. Every fall my girlfriend and I call up the local liquor store every few days until they say it's in.. Then we go and buy it pretty much every time we get beer until it runs out (so like once a week). Lately we've been buying multiple four-packs at a time because it seems to get more popular and run out quicker every year. I would implore Founders to make this a year round thing, though that might take away from the ""specialness"" of it. Really, I'd just hope they make more next year.  So what is the actual experience like?  Ineffable.  You'll just have to go out and try it for yourself. The only things I can really say are that it's thick like crude oil with a strong-but-not-too-strong coffee flavor. It will coat your mouth and warm you heart. Honestly, it's just that good. It will open your eyes. It will change your mind, your life, your very soul. It was. It is. It will always be. It is the alpha and the omega. It was there at my first love of stouts, and it will be there at the end of my liver.  Breakfast Stout is one of those rare drinks that pleases everyone. My girlfriend and I have very different beer tastes, but we can both agree that this is the best beer human beings have yet to offer. I feel like high school me, modern me, my mom, my grandfather, my grandmother, my dad, Barack Obama and Rush Limbaugh could all love this beer.  There is no other. Thou shalt put no other beers before me (if it's in season and the bar serves it, of course).  My local bar gets a single keg of KBS a single time per year. Much to my chagrin and eternal shame, I have yet to try it because it sells out in literally two hours, which is pretty much how long it takes to drain a keg by just holding down the tap. I shit you not, this year my girlfriend and I are taking off work and camping out at the bar to ensure we are a part of that two hours. I know it sounds crazy, but you just haven't tried the dream, the vision, the spiritual experience that is Breakfast Stout. Like the crack cocaine, one taste and you'll be hooked. Just try it. Everybody's doing it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Bottle dated 09/2014  Appearance: dark brown to black, medium brown head that has staying power, poured thick and viscous  Nose: coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, no hops  Taste: bitter, medium mouth feel, no alcohol, fresh coffee, very bitter bakers chocolate, no hop flavor (weird for 60 IBUs)  I was ok with this stout. I thought it was a bit too high on the bitterness and lacked the great malty character I want to see in a double stout. The chocolate notes were very nice and I thought the coffee was well balanced. I have a few more to see how they do with some cellaring on them.   Second review; cellared bottle. Bottle is dated 9/3/2014 so I'm getting to it at 7 months old. Served at cellar temps in a snifter.  Appearance: poured thick and black with a nice tight bubble brown head that sank to a thin ring around the glass. This is a laser etched glass that produces a small head with the carbonation.  Nose: intense dark chocolate, small strong coffee notes, no hops aroma, complex vanilla or spicy character.  Taste: medium carbonation, slight alcohol bite, chocolate, coffee, low roasted malt character, smooth finish with a lingering vanilla note. Slightly warming.  Overall: well I think this one has benefited from some age. I would like to see those fusal alcohols drop off and develop into something more pleasing. The absence of hop aroma is not surprising. I do like the chocolate forward nature of this beer and will purchase more to cellar.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T: The lack of strength in the smell is more then made up for in taste! Deep roasted malt & chocolate are big up front. Followed by coffee & a bit of alcohol heat. Finish is bittersweet, like a good stout should be. F: Thick and chewy, coating the mouth in its oaty goodness. O: An outstanding Stout well deserved of its reputation.

Or they will correct the price.  A: Black. Its dark. Its so dark. Wesley Snipes. No head, light tan colored bubbles rise to the rim of the glass. No head hardly. Coffee color bubbles.  S: I smell smoke, coffee and chocolate. It smells like a burned up Starbucks and it smells delicious.  T: Smells like it tastes. I taste strong notes of coffee bean, and chocolate. I also get a hint of the smokey flavor. Ends sort of bitter like coffee too. Much better after it sits a bit and warms up. Very nice. No noticeable high alcohol brew taste. Its delicious.  M: Oily and slick. Low carbonation.  Overall, this beer hits the head of the nail I think. Its not extremely complicated but it does all the right things.

I usually don't disagree this much with the other BA ratings. No roasty flavors. No hoppy taste or aftertaste (even for a stout).  F (3.75) - Meh. Not especially thick. Not very carbonated, which is proper.  O (3.5) - Underwhelming for me. The only thing I can think of is that I am not using a snifter to drink from.

T: Follows the nose with huge flavors of fresh dark roasted coffee, espresso, touch of dark chocolate, espresso-like bitterness with roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate lingering in the finish, coffee is the most prevalent note.  M: Full bodied, smooth, slightly dry espresso-like finish, amazingly drinkable, I wouldn't think it is an 8.3% ABV beer.  O: One of my favorite beers, love the addition of coffee and chocolate to the base beer. I think this beer is best enjoyed fresh or within a year as the coffee and chocolate will fade over time.

Smell: Coffey beans, roasted malts and lots of chocolate and oddly enough borracho beans with lots of cilantro.  Taste: Strong coffee bitterness and chocolate flavors, mild oatmeal. There are plenty of earthy and herbal flavors mixed in with some spices as it flows through your mouth. The aftertaste is just as great, roasted coffee beans, brown sugar and a little caramel to top it off.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and it just envelopes your mouth with warmth and flavor.

T: Again, dark chocolate aand high quality coffee, almost an espresso feel. It's sweet, rich, and malty. slight hoppy bite can be found, but it is weak. The alcohol is not evident at this point.  F: Perfect in every way. It's creamy and smooth, and it sticks to the inside of your mouth. A tiny bit of carbonation compliments it all.

It just doesn't get much better then this. There are a lot of decent-to-good stouts on the market, this is much more then that.

I love stouts, especially oatmeal stouts, so this seemed like something I was gonna be really into. However, the beer was so boozey tasting, it kinda ruined all the other flavors for me. The alcoholic flavor was way stronger than even an 8.3% ABV would suggest, and it was a bit of a struggle to get through it.  Appearance: Really nice. A beautiful, completely opaque black stout, with a thin, creamy head.  Smell: Strong. This was my first indication that perhaps this beer was gonna be heavy on the booze flavor. Though the traditional malt and chocolate smells were present, they were already being overshadowed by the warm smell of alcohol.  Taste: Not really my thing. Very, very strong. A bit like drinking a heavily roasted Irish coffee or something, it was very dark, very smokey, very alcoholic, and not very sweet. The chocolate is present, but again, tastes roasty rather than sweet. the overwhelming bitterness of all the combined heavy flavors is really a bit much.  Mouthfeel: Not as smooth as most oatmeal stouts, but still very nice. A definite warm booze effect in the finish.  If you're really into heavy, boozey beers, you'll probably enjoy this one a lot. However, I found the intensity of all the flavors kind of off-putting and I wasn't really able to get in to the beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Whatrabbit,5,Simply amazing. One of the best beers of my days. Only problems is that it is seasonal. I would drink this year round if possible. At first smell it wins you over. Solid pour - dies down slowly with good lacing. Smells strongly of malts and chocolate with some coffee tones. Taste lingers just right. Full bodied with tons of great flavors. Chocolate/oats/malts to start with a solid coffee finish. Amazing beer. Can not recommend this more.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,dryndantheman,4.75,"First interview I've ever bothered to do - I am fond of stouts, but they are not my favorite style. This drink may have changed that, by far the best stout I've ever had.  in a wine glass and a Delirium glass - It pours black as thatchers heart, with a tiny tanned head which diminishes to a trace around the rim almost immediately.  The nose is all coffee, particularly when colder, leave it to warm up and you'll get a little bit of the oatmeal and even a little something like treacle coming through, trying to break the sea of coffee coming through your nose.  The taste is a perfect blend of bitter-sweetness coming from the chocolates and just the right amount of coffee + cocoa on the tongue. The roasted malts come through after a while (warm this baby up to room temp.) as do the subtle hoppy aftertaste which helps add another dimension to this stout, distancing it from the competition.  The texture matches the taste perfectly, its full bodied and chewy as with the other interviewers have said: viscous.  This is a fireside stout, drink it slowly and leave it to warm up, it only gets better! A good single pot still sherry-cask whiskey after this would be the perfect complement on a cold winter evening!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,1000lbgrizzly,4.04,"A: Black, slightly oily, light tan head with a thin layer and big bubbles. Agitation reinvigorates this layer. Thick broken webs of sticky lace. Funny bottle art (+.25).  S: To be succinct, Reese's Cups. Peanut butter and chocolate, moderate sweetness. Roasted malt and a bit of hop bitterness. The realistic peanut butter is a new experience, and appreciated.  T: Chocolate, residual nut notes, some disappointing typical American Stout elements, like soapiness. Moderately long finish of coffee and its acidity. Pretty good, but the off-notes detract considerably.  M: Thick-ish, strong carbonation for a stout. Slight astringency.  O: Impressive, especially for a year-round brew. Everything is great, even incredible, except for that damn floral/soapy note in the taste. God, do I hate that in my IPAs and stouts.

1199,11757,Gajo74,4.77,"Wow! What a gorgeous almost pitch black and thick liquid it pours. Coming out the bottle it looks syrupy and viscous. A nice thick brown and white head subsides into a creamy lace that clings to the side of the glass like a Saturn ring. Smells of roasted, slightly burnt (not in a bad way) coffee and chocolate. Taste is coffee like, milky, chocolatey, malty sweet and oatmeal. A nice slightly bitter hops finish balances it out. I had this with chocolate (obviously) and it goes great together. I could alsosee it going with a creamy and less salty cheese like brie as a counterpoint. Feel is creamy with low carbonation but full bodied and viscous. As the name suggests, it really feels like something you could have for breakfast.(Not that I would recommend this, but perhaps if you are on vacation) would also make a great dessert drink or go with mussels.

1199,11757,roubaixnorth,4,"A solid brew for sure. I had this last year and remember it as being a pretty simple stout, flavors of chocolate and coffee. Heavy on the coffee.  Took this out of the cellar at I would say 60 degrees.  Aggressive pour gives me a nice 1-2 finger head that quickly fades to thin head, then nothing.  Smell is that of coffee first and foremost and chocolate.  Very smooth mouth feel.  This beer is going down very smoothly but really all I can get is the coffee. Reading other reviews I was afraid this is how it would end up. I was pleasantly surprised by the end and maybe it was because my hand was warming the glass but some really outstanding flavors started to come out.  I was really getting into the smell of this beer and could pick up on some malts and some nice warming booze smell that I was really getting into.  This beer comes out this time each year and I will keep on purchasing it until it's gone and I will save some for my cellar, if it was a bit more complex I think I might enjoy it a bit more.

A - No head at all even with a hard pour - looks like cold black coffee with thick legs and fine lacing S - Coffee is still dominant but the malt and roast characteristics are coming though. Compared to fresh the coffee aromas are much more integrated and softer T - Again coffee is still there but soft and integrated into a rich malt backbone. Some tartness on the finish that has an estery thing I would more usually associate with a Belgian stout (like dark truth). The coffee wanders back in on the finish to say hi, but there is not much of the bitterness left on the back end compared to fresh M - Creamy and soft, but a little thinner - again probably due to aging.  O - Awesome experiment that will definitely be repeated with a fresh 4 pack from this year! Fresh breakfast stout screams WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE, but with a year on it all the edges soften and it whispers coffee while gently wafting.

Stunning aromas of fresh pressed coffee, creating a fantastic, intense nose. Also, sweeter malts and bitter chocolate are recognizable, but in no way comparable to the inviting, beer-defining coffee aroma.  Taste is much more complex, with subtle hints of smoke among bread, toasted malts with sweeter chocolate and bitter, complex coffee, coated up by a generous amount of cream. This leads to an enjoyable, medium-body. The whole taste impression is very harmonic from the first moment it hits the palate. Carbonation fits great, adds a subtle freshness, which sweetens the chocolate in the midst of a whole lot of cream. Uprising chocolate-sweetness gets perfectly quenched by a coffee bitterness, which has the exact same intensity, leading to an outstanding balance. The finish is defined by bready malts, and fresh coffee beans, resulting in an enjoyable, earthy bitterness, which sticks for a long time.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Below is is a pitch-black body that looks as close to coffee as you're going to get. 5  Dark coffee with sweet creamer punctuates the nose and there's that spicy aroma that sometimes comes with the aggressive coffee beers. Toffee, caramel and other sweet delights add some richness to this great-smelling beer. 4.25  The coffee hasn't gone anywhere in a year; it's still robust, dark, and has a tad of bite.

I'm impressed by how much the coffee holds sway over this brew, even after a year. 4.25  Slight astringency aside, this beer hit's all the right spots on drinkability.

A - Nice black color. Pours somewhat thick with khaki head with light lacing.  S - Strong roasted malt smell with complimentary chocolate, coffee, and some caramel and grain mingling afterwards. No distinct alcohol or hops but smells just as an oatmeal stout should smell.  T - Lots of flavor with a very robust character dominated by roast, chocolate, coffee, and that distinct oats character that I really enjoy. Not as much coffee flavor as I expected but there is some that compliments the black malt and the sweetness of the overall stout. There is some faint bitterness from the roasted malt but is malt forward and overall to the sweeter side. Not as sweet or as chocolaty as some stouts of this style but it is very balanced and delicious.  M - Medium to high mouth-feel with low carbonation. Silky feel and a lightly lingering sweetness that makes it a great winter beer. Not too cloying but not thin.  Overall, a great ""Imperial"" Oatmeal stout. It isn't as heavy as some RIS's but it is a tasty brew. It has everything for the dark beer drinker.

1199,11757,TheItalianStallion,4.91,"Finally found this beer at Half Time in Mamaroneck, NY after looking everywhere for it. $15 for a 4 pack.  Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Duvel tulip glass.  A: Pours a pure black onyx color with a 1 inch head of tan foam that settles to a thin collar. Moderate head retention that doesn't leave much lacing behind.  S: The smell of this beer practically jumps out of the glass. There is a major aroma of roasted coffee beans, with some roasted malts and dark chocolate also there. Oats are there but not as prevalent as the coffee and chocolate. Alcohol is very faintly detectable on the nose as the beer warms.  T: Wow. The label on the 4 pack describes this as ""the coffee lover's consumate beer"" and they really are not kidding. Rich, sweet flavors of perfectly roasted coffee, cocoa, and bitter chocolate perfectly compliment each other. One sip you get coffee, the next sip you get chocolate, and the sip after that you get a perfect combination of the two. There is a lingering biterness on the finish that almost perfectly mimics the bitterness you get when drinking black coffee. A very intresting, espresso like flavor to this beer. Alcohol is masked very well, hidden beneath the depths of the massive coffee and chocolate flavors.  M: Wow again. This beer has a full body and an amazingly creamy, luscious mouthfeel. It has low carbonation and is unbelievably smooth. By far the best mouthfeel of any beer i've drank to date.  O: I had my doubts, but after finally trying this beer, I can tell you its the real deal. It is without a doubt worthy of all the praise and high ratings it receives. Massive aromas and flavors of coffee, with some chocolate mixed in too. If you really like coffee, you will absolutely love this beer. However if you are not a coffee drinker, I could see how you wouldn't be a huge fan of it. I'm having a hard time trying to find a fault with this beer, it really is that good. My two favorite beverages, coffee and beer, had an affair and this is their love child. Truly something special, I will be stocking up on this for the winter!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,EvoRich,4.89,"I've been waiting all year to review this since I've had it last. I don't like reviewing from memory.  Look: Very little head when poured, but pitch black, and thick like oil.  Smell: Chocolate and coffee are very dominant. Has a slight oat aroma behind the chocolate.  Taste: Coffee upfront, with a chocolate malty flavor finish. Just the small hint of alcohol at the end. This stuff it amazing!  Feel: Thick and creamy as they come! Carbonation is mild and smooth.  Overall: I don't have much to say, as I'm too busy drinking. This is definitely an all time favorite for sure. There are beers out there that are rare and expensive. Beers that you'd be lucky to even try once. Some of those beers are only JUST as good as Breakfast Stout. And this is readily available almost anywhere.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Meyers1023,4.9,"Pours black with a good amount of creamy tan head. Smell is roasted coffee with a chocolate background. Taste follows suit. The coffee is very present and you get a hint of chocolate with a bit of hop bitterness as it finished. These flavors improve as the beer warms. The feel is very creamy with very little carbonation.

1199,11757,TCJ0100,5,"Thought I would knock two big ones out for tonight. Poured the 2014 edition into a cognac snifter and off I go. It pours a small brown head and is inky black.  The smell is dominated by coffee. Its smells almost like a cold mocha or one of those iced coffees that the pour chocolate syrup in. If I smelled this without knowing what it was, I would assume that it was not a beer. It really smells rich and full without being overbearing. The smell is one of the best parts of this beer.  When I started to taste this beer, and it took a couple, I really can appreciate just what a job Founders has done with it. This blows much heavier stouts out of the water, and I feel that this should be drank as fresh as possible, because the coffee is just right. The predominant taste is chocoloate coffee with hints smoky dark roasted malts. It's warming, refreshing, and just excellent.  Founders is my favorite brewery for a reason, and honestly it held that title before I ever tasted this beer. I think they have gotten dark beers just right. Between this, their always excellent porter (a go-to), and KBS, I don't think any other brewery makes such excellent darker beers. These aren't the biggest and boldest of beers, but there excellent balance is precisely why I think they excel past any over-hyped IPA or stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,orcrist_cleaver,4.91,"Everyone needs to drink this beer at some point. It can substitute for coffee; it's lush and roasty. It would be a substitute for milk to go with my count chocula; it's slightly acrid and has an elegant chocolatey bittersweetness with the smoothness of oatmeal flakes.  Seriously one can get lost within oneself as they drink this beer as they slowly realize that nothing else really matters...  A: Dark brown when tilted to pour, but fades to black as you hold this glass upward. Retains a nice medium mocha head.  S: This aroma will wake you up from any hangover and make any blackened soul sing to the heavens. Rich Sumatran coffee decadence with just a hint of chocolate. The overall sensation is as if you're in the forests of Hawaii, you can smell the vulcan heat as it warms up the coffee beans nearby. Definitely some light tropical elements here.  M: Pretty warm and full welcoming. Slight chewy and soft and above all creamy.  T/O: Layered components well. Bright acidic coffee notes, bittersweet chocolates, robust and fluttering fruit sweetness. Soft peat and roasted elements fill out the flavor profile. Gets 5 for breakfast stouts, but in the overarching category of stouts, I prefer sweeter RIS versions.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,enjambed,3.75,"Extremely excited to finally try this! Fridge temperature bottle, bottled on 9/24/2014 , consumed 10/10/2014. This stuff is fresh!  Appearance: pitch black with a dark brown/khaki head  Smell: Dark ripe fruits, chocolate, coffee, and something else that's hard to pick out but reminds me of hard alcohol  Taste: medium roast coffee stands out the most, with dark malts standard for a stout and some biting acidity. I'm a little disappointed that I can't find any chocolate in here, maybe my palate is off today. The alcohol is definitely present, but isn't in the way.  As it warms toward room temperature the coffee and maybe a bit of the bitter chocolate becomes apparent.  Feel: Rich and full, but velvety smooth. In fact, I'm tempted to say this is the best part of the beer.  Overall:  Founders Breakfast Stout is a well-done, unique and enjoyable double stout. It's the first coffee stout that I have tried so far. With that said, I was honestly a little disappointed that I didn't find it to my tastes. I enjoy black, dark roast coffee all the time, but this just wasn't for me. The acidity was a little too much for me to enjoy it fully.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,CTbrew32,4.58,"Appearance- Pitch black with a three finger mocha head produced from an aggressive pour.  Aroma- Roasted Coffee dominates the aroma, and some sweet chocolate is noticeable as well.  Taste- In the front coffee dominates with smooth chocolate flavors that help balance the bitter coffee and create a creamy feel at first. Then the oatmeal kicks in and adds a dry finish with cookie flavors as well.  Feel- Creamy mouthfeel at first that leads into a dry finish. Full bodied with a pretty dense malt base.  Overall- Not quite a 100 for me, but pretty damn close. Only one minor drawback is the finish is a little sweet, going back to that cookie flavor. However, the coffee and chocolate flavors are amazing and the creamy/dry mouthfeel combo is great as well. Big plus for me is the abv and drinkability, as this drinks like a 5% brew, but matches the depth of a 12% stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Auraan,5,"Poured a deep, gorgeous black body with no light shining through at all and a one finger thick tan stout head. A very good looking stout, perfect for the style. Scents of rich black coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa powder and roast malt. Coffee is the most abundant aroma and is simply wonderful. Overall impression of aroma is of a rich, deep, wonderfully coffee-forward stout. Flavor begins with a strong flavor of dark roast coffee, with just a touch of cream and flavors of rich dark chocolate and cocoa. This moves into a middle that is even more coffee-forward, strongly reminiscent of dark roasted beans before being brewed, with lesser notes of cream, roast malt and hints of cocoa. Finish is coffee-forward, with notes of roast malt, cocoa powder and very dark chocolate and faint alcohol. Aftertaste is rich dark chocolate, strong notes of black coffee and dark roasted malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a nicely coffee-forward stout that keeps from being one note with the wonderful cocoa, dark chocolate and cocoa. Mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation and smooth, creamy feel. Overall impression mouthfeel is of a nicely rich and creamy Imperial stout that is full bodied, yet not overwhelming and is vey pleasant to drink. Overall this is an excellent Imperial stout that has a wonderful aroma and flavor that are both rich, full and coffee-forward and are not too rich, but perfectly balanced. The mouthfeel aids drinkability and the entire beer is simply wonderful.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,mnredsoxfan69,4.51,"Amazing brew, just amazing.  It pours a thick, deep brown, almost black, but not quite, with a two finger creamy, tan head that quickly disapates to a thin cover of foam leaving lots of sticky splotches on the glass.  The smell is redolent of coffee and bready malt with any hoppiness buried beneath.  The taste is rich, lightly sweet, lightly roasty with overtones of both the coffee and chocolate. Again, the malt is at the front with the hops well hidden along with the alcohol.  This is one full bodied beer thanks to the oatmeal, thick and creamy on the tongue with a medium finish and no alcohol burn. Light on the carbonation after the initial pour.  Overall, this is the best stout I've ever had that didn't come out of a bourbon barrel, thick, creamy, not too sweet with a complex nose and tongue. I would have liked the smell to be a little stronger, but I won't complain.

On a second whiff I pick up more of the chocolate. This is heaven for a coffee lover.  T: 5 - This is spectacular. Absolutely spectacular.

1199,11757,JJKBeerLvr,4.84,"Poured from a bottle into pint glass.  Appearance: Very dark with nice thick brown head.  Smell: Pleasant, and can smell both some hops, but the aroma is dominated by coffee and some roasted malts. Comparing this to Founder's Imperial Stout, it has less of an alcohol aroma, more coffee, and sweetness.  Taste: Excellent taste. There is a strong coffee influence with some sweetness from the malts and balanced with a little hops. It is a great balance that is not too bitter, nor too sweet. The balance between the flavors is great. Comparing this to Founder's Imperial Stout, it has a stronger coffee flavor, less bite from the hops, and sweetness from the oats.  Mouth-feel: This beer is very smooth with a nice aftertaste that is not too bitter. Not quite as strong or powerful as Founder's Imperial Stout.  This is one of the best breakfast stouts I've tasted. You will enjoy it if you like a bold stout with coffee flavors. It is complex, and every time I drink it, I get something new. Definitely a beer to drink again. The more I drink it, the more I like it. One of my favorites, and a nice contrast to Founder's Imperial Stout.  EDIT 1/3/2017: Compared Founders Breakfast Stout with Weyerbacher Sunday Mole Stout. These are 2 of my favorite stouts and very similar, so it is an interesting side-by-side comparison. - Both are black and almost totally opaque. - FBS has a larger head that remains longer than the SMS. - FBS has a stronger coffee aroma. I do not get much aroma other than mostly coffee and a little chocolate from either of these. - SMS has a bigger body, probably due to the higher alcohol content - Both have strong coffee flavors. - FBS is a little smoother and creamier. - SMS has more of a bite, probably from more or different hops. - FBS is a little more sweet with more chocolate flavors than SMS.  Summary: I love them both and they are 2 of my favorites. FBS is a little sweeter with more chocolate flavors, and the SMS has more bite from hops. I will continue to drink both of these often, based on whether I am in the mood for a sweeter or want a more hoppy stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Decadent roasted malts with huge chocolate flavor, with hints of smoke like a cigar. Was expecting a dominant Kona coffee flavor, but this was more subtle. The ABV of 8.3% is a little low for a stout, but the pure decadence makes up for this. This beer is currently rated as #28 out of Beer advocate ' s Top 250 beers, and I feel like it should be higher.

1199,11757,MasterfulIdiot,5,"Poured into an Ikea snifter. The liquid is pitch black, and the pour kicks up a modest head that fades quickly to a film but leaves lots of lace.  Aroma is really nice coffee, chocolate, and hints of dark fruit and a slight warming character, with a bit of lactic tartness. The coffee aromas are really great - perfect amount of roast character without being charred.  Flavor is, again, really great coffee and chocolate. The coffee brings with it some really nice dark fruit and almost vinous flavors, and the chocolate is fairly dark, but the lactic tartness brings out some sweetness from it too, becoming a really nice blend of dark and milk chocolate. There are also some weird wheat bread flavors, becoming kind of brownie-ish. Finish is slightly bitter, and the aftertaste brings out some caramel in addition to the coffee and chocolate.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a high amount of carbonation - really nicely silky.  Overall, my absolute favorite readily-available coffee beer. The coffee flavors are absolutely perfect, and even better than most coffee products out there! Coffee is the beverage I cheat on beer with during the day, so I loooove when beers incorporate good coffee flavors (instead of the usual overly-roasted mess), and this one is the best of the best. The balance of bitterness and sweetness is perfect, and there is absolutely nothing I would change about this. This is a staple that I wait all spring and summer for.

1199,11757,SHDoyle,4.49,"Description: Deep, dark brown, borderline black appearance with virtually no head when poured into a snifter. The smell is a rich blend of dark chocolate, coffee and maybe some dark fruit, maybe dark cherry. Taste is consistent with the smell as chocolate, cocoa and dark fruit dominates on the front but gives way to a coffee heavy finish. The flavors meld well and truly complement one another. Feel is exactly what you want in a stout: thick, rich and creamy with minimal carbonation.  Suggested food pairing: It's a breakfast stout...you pair it with breakfast.  If you like this beer then you should also try: 30th Anniversary Ale  Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again) A beer that lives up to its reputation. This might get overshadowed at times by its Kentucky and Canadian cousins but that's not because it isn't oustanding; the others are just more outstanding.

Until trying this stout I had never had anything coffee-flavored that was less than warm that I liked. Coffee icecream, iced coffee, coffee liquors, etc are just not my thing. This beer did not change that opinion. Anything coffee-ed needs to be hot for me, and hot beer is, well, not my thing either.  That said, it has a great mouthfeel, and if the coffee aspect of it wasn't there, I reckon I'd enjoy the rest of the flavors.

Despite the strength the alcohol is masked by the chocolate & dark malts.  Strong chocolate, subtly sweet with light bitterness & strong coffee, some oatmeal too. There is some espresso like flavours & lots of cocoa with roasted malts & darker fruits, sugar & vanilla. Complex & great tasting.  Full bodied & smooth, the alcohol content is almost completely hidden with only the slightly warming feel giving an indication as to the strength of this one. Strong sweetness with the occasional bit of bitterness; frighteningly easy to drink too.

A light brown head quickly dissolves to a thin ring. No noticeable carbonation. Decent lacing and light legging.  Aroma: Rich, bitter chocolate and cocoa nibs up front backed by thick notes of roasted coffee. Hints of molasses. Not a lot to speak of beyond that, but it is very pleasing.  Taste: Bitter chocolate hits you first with a subtle smoke character. Gobs of roasted malt and coffee ride out each sip. Light notes of molasses and vanilla. Roasted coffee aftertaste. Alcohol is well masked - I'd never guess this one at 8%.  Mouthfeel: This is a full-bodied beer that will fill you up. Again, no noticeable carbonation. Smooth exit with a nice aftertaste.

Rather than go through the usual A-S-T-M review that a thousand other BA's have done before me, I just want to talk about how important it is to age this beer for approx. 8-12 months. I realize that it's only 8.3% abv and not bourbon barelled, but when you drink this beer fresh right off the shelf it has a bit of a hop bite that doesn't blend well with the malt and the mouthfeel isn't smooth and creamy. At six months it still isn't quite right but starting around eight months it becomes a great beer. Now here's the strange part, I age the bottles at 36 degrees. I don't know why it works (all my higher abv imperial stouts are aged at 68 degrees) it just does.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

It has oatmeal, coffee, and chocolate in it and you taste all of those. Its a beer you drink slowly to enjoy the flavor. Goes perfect with great meal as the drink. Its a very filling beer and I wouldn't be surprised if it had 200 calories or more per 12 oz bottle (never bothered to look it up since I don't care about that). Only available Late October, November, and December so thats a big disappointment. A 4 pack of 12 oz bottles cost $12 so its very pricey but worth it. This hands down is my favorite stout.

Overall: Considering the ratings and hype, this is somewhat of a let down to me. At fridge temperature I get nothing but coffee in the taste and aroma.

I've been told about it, heard rumours, news reports on CCN/BBC and Chinese whispers about the greatness of this beer, so much so that I was shocked to see it sitting quietly on a shelf in The Archive next door cellars... I had to have it and review it immediately, and here faithful reader(s) we are *sniff*.  Poured from a 355ml bottle into the sacred Chimay chalice, sorry the simple nonic pint was too lowly to behold this brew.  A: Black as Satan's publicist (hey Satan is an equal opportunity lord of terror) this brew presents with a Texas tea coloured body (that's oil son!) and no head, just a ring of tan lace around the edge, mmm.  S: Cant really smell anything apart from that Kona coffee bean, this literally has the aroma of a cold press coffee, delicious but one-dimensional (sorry Founders). I even agitated the hell out of it with anecdotes about my day, but nothing/nada/zip - just Kona cold press coffee.  T: Holy shit this beer rocks. The taste is like the richest coffee flavour my tongue has ever encountered. There are notes of roast chicory, dark chocolate and earthy/herbal hops impart a bitter finish. Damn this is tasty. Something about it keeps me sipping on it, it's difficult to put down. There is some smokiness in there as well. Maybe a hint of prune... I can't stop sipping!  M: First thought that springs to mind is ""Man my tongue is totally coated in sticky coffee goodness"". Heavy bodied and smooth, Marvin Gaye smooth. The viscosity is one of the most remarkable parts of this brew - it's soooo chewy and sticky, like a coffee Stout flavoured honey.  D: Wait I'm not done praising this beer yet; it gets better as it gets warmer, more flavours come out of the wood works - hints of brandy with some rich toffee too. That is truly a sign of a great beer: it gets better as it gets warmer. Which is why the English drink their beers at room temperature. I think I've found it - the best Stout ever. Period.  Food match: They call it a breakfast Stout but I think it is more a dessert Stout, our an after-dinner cigar Stout.

Really nice concentrated syrupy nose that oozes black licorice, chocolate, cherry and black coffee. Serious dark fruit presence. This one is old enough where there's not much hops left on the nose, instead it's much sweeter than I recall.  Taste has also been transformed a bit, with a healthy amount of sweetness to balance the roasty, bitter coffee and hops. Nice dry notes of black coffee balanced by black cherries and chocolate, also a touch of fennel. This beer still has that x factor -- some sort of bitter umami -- that keeps you coming back for more and more.  Mouthfeel is on the light side for an imperial stout but coats the palate nicely with its sweetness and leaves a dry, almost chalky finish. Nice.  Overall, it's amazing what a year and a half has done to this beer. I sort of miss the big hop bitterness, but the dark fruit sweetness is a nice replacement. Coffee remains either way. I've made an effort to judge this beer based on both the current bottle in front of me and my memory of fresh tastings.

That doesn't mean that I would abandon my IPA's for this, but, every once in a while this one is nice to shake things up.  Appearance: Black as night, no light coming through that I could detect. I poured it with a medium aggressiveness but the head remained pretty much the same about a half an inch or maybe a bit less.  Smell: Not a strong burst of coffee or that nasty licorice but some chocolate and malty notes, sweet but not overly cloying.  Taste: I really enjoyed the flavor profile,that was my favorite part really, It had a bit of that Manhattan Special thing going on, but not as sweet. Chocolate was there but in a mild cocoa form, no syrupy sweet molasses or anise flavors, which I really liked about this one.

Everything comes together pretty well  Taste is with the nose pretty well, strong upfront coffee and dark chocolate along with figs, cherry, and other dark fruits. Vanilla and toffee on the finish, ending with a splash of alcohol  Feel is moderately bitter with a heavy body. Finishes pretty dry, alcohol concealed well but enjoyably present  Overall glad I got to try this.

1199,11757,Swongler,3.69,"I LOVE stouts. I'm not, however, quite sure why this beer is rated so highly. I absolutely love other Founders offerings, but this one falls short... maybe it was just high expectations. The first bottle I had, I thought maybe was just bad luck - maybe it was served too cold, maybe it was too fresh or too old.... but the second bottle was cared for perfectly and tasted exactly the same. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer, just not in my top 10... or 20... or maybe even 30.  A - Looks gorgeous. Perfect shade of brown/black. Just dark with a fluffy, creamy, tan-colored head (about a finger and a half or so).  S - Coffee and chocolate are obvious. Both bright and dark berries/cherries in the mix as well. Definitely smells like breakfast.  T - Huh? But it looked so beautiful and smelled so good. First thing I notice: the water. Water? I was expecting the beer to take over, but it tasted a little watered down. Chocolate and coffee were apparent. Espresso and earthy minerals as well - had that Guinness metallic taste to it. I'm told the metallic taste is a characteristic of bad water, but I am particularly sensitive to its taste. Dark, ripe berries are hidden a little, but there.  M - Feels light - almost like a session ale, but it finishes nice and creamy. Doesn't coat my mouth too much, but feels good.  O - I was a little let down by this beer. Not once, but twice. It IS certainly good - just not 100 rating good. I'll wait for KBS to obtain a Founders stout. Until then, I think I'd stick with a Speedway Stout over this, any day.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T/M- extremely creamy mouthfeel leaving a luscious dark chocolate, sweet espresso, light grain, and just a touch of dark fruit. Finish is long, relatively dry, bitter and a touch ashy with lingering hop and coffee bitterness covering the tongue.  O- an indisputably good beer with lots of components blending nicely. A touch lower bitterness may have made this more drinkable but at 8+% abv maybe that wouldn't be such a good thing.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Sweet heavy chocolate and oatmeal undertones. Reminded me of Grant's Perfect Porter circa 1996. My saliva glands started to weep waiting to taste.  T - Surprisingly not as sweet as the smell. Super dark chocolate and a forward roasted oatmeal grain taste. The finish is all bitter coffee. Slow to mellow  M - There was an interesting play here. Creamy and toothy like a stout, but more carbonated than expected. With little to no head at pour, I was not expecting much carbonation, yet there it was  O - It was as advertised. A great beer. Unlike my everyday breakfast coffee, this is not a daily drinker. Great for a treat or to share with a friend.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Chocolate are there in the background, with brown sugar or molasses faintly there. Smells great!  T- Follows the nose. Very strong coffee notes at first and chocolate follows. Nice and roasty taste, although I find it to lean more towards the bitter side i feel as if it use a bit more sweetness. Overall it's fantastic.  M- Light carbonation with decent amount of body. Almost perfect here.  O- This beer is phenominal. Id say if the body was a bit more heavy and just somewhat sweeter this would be perfect. The strong coffee taste is amazing with the chocolate playing as a supporting role. I find this an almost impeccable beer.

1199,11757,BeerZombies1,4,"Breakfast Stout - Founders Brewing  Imperial stout 8.3% ABV  APPEARANCE: Poured a deep dark, day old coffee black. Very little head appeared what was there dissipated into a mocha halo pretty quickly.  AROMA: Like fresh ground coffee beans sprinkled with dark chocolate chips. Very in your face aroma, under that first layer the alcohol is present with some nice earthy graininess.  TASTE: Truthfully the first taste I was disappointed. I felt like all I got was huge coffee and bitterness. I actually went back to smell a bit more and let it sit. When I went back for the second taste I really got to taste more of the layers hidden, chocolate, dark fruit and roasted malts.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium carbonation body I felt was a bit thin. It did have a lingering finish that was interesting.  OVERALL: It took me about a quarter of the beer to really start to enjoy it. Once it warmed and I got into it, it was very solid.

I'm kinda going off memory here, cause it was a few weeks ago, but a couple aspects of the beer you truly will not forget. Pours dark with thin creamy head that stays and sticks to the glass. I would encourage it to not be served too cold because the flavors burst as it warms. Thick oat, complex coffee almost chocolate. Hard to put your finger on all flavors.

T: more like coffee with alcohol. The coffee is not too overpronounced and the bittersweetness from the chocolate balances nicely any spikes in flavor that the coffee might bring. There's a great amount of balance and harmony going on in between these two ingredients and together they are making this an even better beer.  M: full bodied with some astringency, light carbonation as to be expected, no lingering flavors expect for the harshness of the roast bite which is incredibly subtle compared to other brews, but it washes down silently and adequetly.  O: i actually don't have any complaints expect that i would enjoy seeing the vanilla a bit more present in the palate, aside from that it's another excellent world class beer from Founder's!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,ThePaintedGrey,4.55,"12oz. bottle poured into snifter.  A: Abysmal, and I don't mean that in a negative connotation. I mean it in the sense that this brew absolutely resembles the abyss. All semblances of color are shrouded by the blackness. All traces of light devoured. There aren't even highlights along the sides as it's held up to direct sun. This beer is black; I'm talking the depths of the Mariana Trench black. As for the head... admittedly, my pour was pretty weak and it still resulted in about an inch and a half of toasted caramel colored creamy excellence. The retention leaves a little to be desired, but there's currently still a nice creamy cap sitting afloat the blackness and some respectable traces of khaki lacing scattered along the sides of the glass.  S: Gourmet roasted coffee (bordering medium and dark roast) and rich pure cocoa. Coffee tends to dominate here, as it squelches out the cocoa towards the end of the sniff. A simple aroma, but it's oh-so-satisfying. It smells like waking up to a fresh pot of coffee brewing.  T: A bit too chilled, initially... Taste was exclusively pure cocoa and some oaked alcohol. After leaving it untouched for about 20 minutes to warm up, the flavors have finally come out to play. The dark chocolate notes lose their bitter characteristics and begin to resemble semi-sweet chocolate chips. A huge roasted profile resembling some of the finest black coffee ever brewed. Underneath the coffee and cocoa are some real complex notes of molasses, oak barreled booze, and burnt caramel. A little bit of an herbal flash comes through in the finish that doesn't linger, but certainly makes itself apparently. A bit of alcoholic burn in the finish that warms the throat. Aftertaste is bitter roasted coffee. Superb.  M: A huge body! The texture is thick, creamy, and moderately chewy—all thanks to the oatmeal, one would assume. Velvety smooth and is a pure delight on the tongue. 8.3% you say? Strange... I'm not feeling it.  O: FBS' reputation honestly speaks for itself. There's nothing I can say here that hasn't been said a thousand times (or 3,100 times...) before. This is surely stout perfection in a bottle and you'd have your work cut out for you trying to find a better example.

The head dies down quickly but lacing is solid and it sticks down the glass.  S: Lots of coffee up front along with dark roasted malts and bitter dark chocolate. You can almost smell the creaminess of the beer through the aroma. It's hard to explain but you'll know what I mean with one good whiff.  T: Everything present in the aroma is present in the taste and that's no small feat. A slight bitterness from the dark roasted malts is probably the most pronounced flavor but you also get a nice touch of coffee and hint of chocolate in the finish. There's nothing not to like here, very well balanced and expertly crafted. At 8.3% ABV is deceptively drinkable as it invites you back for just another sip.  M: Very smooth, very creamy, very full bodied and very good. Carbonation seems to be on the low side but it could just be the insane amount of body over-powering it and that's not a bad thing at all.  O: I'm super impressed with this beer. The aromas and flavors are fantastic, pull no punches and leave no questions on the table. What you smell is what you taste and that, to me, is the sign of a well crafted beer.

This ale pours a deep dark almost black color with a very slight tan head that quickly dissipates to a light film and very little lacing. The nose is packed with coffee notes highlighted by some burnt dried fruits and cacao. The mouthfeel is the best thing about this beer. It is so silky and creamy and smooth; an utter delight to swirl around your mouth and slowly swallow. The flavor is quite simple for a beer of this caliber. Lots of coffee, a little dark chocolate, a pleasantly bitter bite towards the end, and just a little sting and taste of alcohol on the tail. Simple and awesome.

The rich, dark color and the head are great after pouring from bottle, as expected from a stout-but the rich, bold flavors I expect from a stout are just not there. There is a coffee, oatmeal flavor with very slight hints of chocolate, but none of these flavors are strong. The flavors are good and are balanced, just not much there.

It pours heavy, no head and minimal lacing, into a tulip glass (next time I'll use a snifter).

Taste the same as it smells. Coffe is dominant, but not overwhelming. No bitterness or acidity from the coffee. Can tell it is a very high quality coffee, so it's dominance is happily welcomed. The fullness from the chocolately malt rounds it out very well. Nice, heavy mouthfeel without being to syrupy. Very clean aftertaste, not one single off flavor. Just a lingering, mouth watering savoryness, making me want more. Definately much better than last years. Possibly due to the freshness of this one. Perhaps the best beer I have ever had.

T: yep it's awesome. Perfect balance of coffee, malt, slight hops, and chocolate. So well balanced. Nothing is overwhelming. Other coffe stouts are too burnt or too roasted. Not this.

Awesome.  Updated Review: This is still one of the best stouts out there. It's easily accessible, which makes it a go to beer for me. Most prefer to drink this one fresh because of the coffee, but it's still drinking good with over 5 months of age on it. I do think the coffee has mellowed a bit, so I would rather have it fresh. The mouthfeel to this beer is amazing; so smooth and creamy (thanks to the oats). This beer is really a work of art. The flavors are so well integrated, and it's an easy to drink brew. I do think I prefer founders imperial stout over this one, but that might be my favorite beer ever..

It works in a bottle on tap or in this case in my mini-growler jar, and it is always outstanding.  What could be better. It looks like the ideal stout with loads of lacing. The aroma is pronounced and enticing. The taste is out of this world. The bitterness offsets the malt perfectly. The balance is perfect. The aftertaste is more like an afterglow.  This is a great brew. It is very close to perfect, and defines the style. You could say it is a little understated compared to many over the top American stouts that have followed, but it has a refinement that keeps it ahead of the rest.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Possibly because it is a bitter dark beer and recently I have been falling out of love with stouts and porters, possibly because the whole craft beer palate is moving along onto new pastures. Call me a band wagoner or a migrating bird, but stouts and porters are losing real estate in my fridge.  That said, I did taste the outstanding coffee, Kona and Sumatra, very distinctive. Also, I tasted the chocolate, and felt the acidity of dark chocolate. If you ask me, on the other hand, about the oatmeal, I just didn't taste it.  This stout is thick, but not syrupy, not very carbonated, and very fragrant. It is a great beer, but like I said, I'm moving on.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Although I really enjoyed this beer, the hype and praise is nowhere near what this beer delivered. Quite basic and the depth is nowhere near many other stouts, especially barrel aged stouts. During a month where I had 2012 Parabola, Old Raspy XV, Berserker, Black Butte XXIII, 2010 Abyss, 2012 Black Tuesday, etc. This beer isnt even close when it comes to depth, mouthfeel, complexity, etc. If it was available at my store, I would probably drink this a lot because of the price point and the quality it delivers, but from a 1-100 rating it just does not stand up to the barrel aged big boys.

Taste: Flavours are a wonderful mix of bitter coffee and dark chocolate and a slight sweetness, with the oatmeal lending more to a smooth and creamy feel in my mouth than flavour.

Not the taste bulldozer I was expecting, however this meant it wasn't overbearing a nice coffee level instead of almost gagging on imaginary grind that has leaked through a tattered cafetiere.

Smells of malt, roast, coffee, prunes, yeast, and hops. Wonderfully inviting aroma.  Sweet and bitter at the same time. Malt richness and hop bite with some smoke flavors along with coffee, chocolate, and some dark grain bitterness. Complex and very tasty. Aftertaste as good as the front, but where the front is more bitter the back is more balance. Can not detect the alcohol even at over 8%.  Full bodied, but not overpowering, smooth, rich and creamy, but with an effervescent fizz. This is what stout should be.  Inviting, refreshing, interesting and intriguing all at the same time.

S - Gritty French-pressed coffee awakens the senses while dark chocolate-covered raisins melt in warm brown sugar-sprinkled oatmeal with vanilla bean ice cream. Smells like breakfast in a glass!  T - Black, heavily roasted coffee strikes bitterness at the heart of the milk chocolate under body while morsels of molasses coated oats, sticky raisins, and notes of burnt brown sugar trail through the background.  M - Bitter, black coffee thins out Breakfast Stout's otherwise viscous body, adding a gritty feel and dryness to the finish but the oats counteract and give the medium-full body a lush smoothness that leaves a lasting impression on the palate.  O - Breakfast Stout awakens the senses with a burst of French-pressed coffee backed by chocolate-covered raisins and warm oatmeal but the beer's viscosity isn't quite as rich as it might smell. The coffee addition works to thin things out with some dry bitterness leaving the beer a bit more drinkable as opposed to a throat-coating, sweet stout, at any rate, minus the bacon and eggs, this is breakfast in a glass.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

I do. But, nothing can ever reach that high. Its about the chase, man. A- Black. I hold it up to the light and I can barely get a redish color at the very bottom peaking through. Great lacing. Odd colored head, well, I guess just not what I was expecting...Its a tannish gray color. (thats not a bad thing) S- Ahhh.... breath-taking. Coffee, roastiness, chocolate... I find myself wanting to invent words. If I take a very long inhale through the nose of this beast, I can begin to detect the alcohol. But man is it just begging me to slam it down. I refuse! I MUST sip slowly and chew each mouthfull, to make it last as long as possible. Love. T- As I said before, this beer is a piece of cake. Chocolate cake with hints of coffee. Again I want to invent words to describe it. You know the best dark chocolate youve ever had? The best Italian dark roast coffee you ever had? Best chocolate cake you ever had? Well, imagine a blend of that made into a beer, your other favorite thing. Thats actually a horrible description, as it is lacking in even beginning on how to project how great this really is... M- I had to change it from 4.25 to 4.5. This is my ideal mouthfeel for this style. Other stouts bow down to its full chewyness. This brew is thick in the way that shes got T n A that are fat but in the best way and you love it. Can we just replace coffee with this beer? Lets replace her, too.

The coffee is the dominant flavor on the palate and compliments the rest of the beer nicely. Chocolate sweetness comes in after the initial coffee blast, followed by a mellow, semi-dry finish. Warming alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Nice malt backbone and oatmeal give this beer nice body. Good carbonation- not too overpowering, but not exactly silky smooth either.

A very clever marketing campaign seems to have overwhelmed people's sensibilities, if not the 8%+ alcohol content.

1199,11757,JasonLovesBeer,4.19,"Thanks to my friend Ashley for bringing this back from Philly, no such thing as Founders around here.  A: Inky black with brown edges, head is small and disappears to a ring fairly quick.  S: Bitter chocolate meets a powerful aroma of medium roast coffee grounds. Smells like I freshly ground a bunch and took a whiff. I'm used to just picking up generic coffee in beers but this stuff you can get much further into, picking out the roast quality and flavour of the coffee beans themselves. Strikes me as a light roast, which is perhaps less common than dark roasts in beer.  T: While I smell the coffee as I take a sip, the taste is almost exclusively baker's chocolate and granola bar to start things off for me. Only after a few seconds does the coffee come back. I get much better resolution on the coffee in the nose. Coffee comes across as a nutty medium roast to me.  M: Thinner than I expected from such a highly acclaimed stout. Compared to BCBCS or Ten Fidy, this stuff feels like water. But it IS creamy and rich, just not thick.  O: This stuff has powerful flavour all around, from the coffee to the chocolate and even the oats. I was surprised to find no detectable hop flavour really, but then again, there isn't any sweetness that it needs to counteract. This stuff is huge dark chocolate, huge coffee, and huge oatmeal. And almost nothing else at all.

Just like a Starbucks at first whiff, a nice deep roasty smell hanging subtly underneath.  T: I love it.

Missing the musty, leathery taste that downgrades other stouts for me, which is awesome.  M: Very pleasant.  O: Really a great beer. Makes the exact point that (I think) it is intending to.

This poured a deep black with some tan head. Held to a desk lamp the light does not penetrate this brew. Smell is very nice, Chocolate and coffee dominate the nose here, (Smells like what the label says it should).

But maybe with a double bottle serving instead of one, lace would appear and head would be thicker. Still, a dark beauty of a beer.  S-Dark cold coffee. Cocoa bean. Hot cereal. Oats. Milk. Leather. Tobacco. Ink. Brownie batter. Resinous. Hemp. Dark chocolate. Chocolate pretzels. Smoked meats. So many possibilities of smell detecting here. A litany can be compiled.  T-Tag team of coffee & chocolate wrestle on the palate. Molasses. Toffee. Charcoal smoke. Plum even. Cream of Wheat. Oatmeal. Cocoa Rice Krispies. Wheat grain. Ink. Resin. Hemp. Tobacco. Dark sour dried fruits: prunes and raisins. I think the beginning, middle and end is a uniform sip. You can take your time and pluck out multiple flavors one by one. The aftertaste is a mild sour. With inky vapors on the breath.  M-Perfect medium body. Spritz-y, bright low-medium carbonation is a constant. Always sizzles from start to finish. Goodness, this beer warms you when it is ICE COLD. That is the definition of perfect carbonation. Not a typical dead feeling stout, Breakfast Stout has life. Root beer float and/or milkshake sudsy feel is present, and yet is fluid enough to be soft and velvety. Nice sour alkaline aftertaste, gentle. Bitter resins on the after as well. The body does thin out though, feeling liqueur like with time. But the carbonation gives a consistent sizzle down your chest, like boiling sugar. Sticky. If the beer was thicker, consistently, this would be the best feeling beer around.  O-Possibly the best four-pack of beer you can buy. I like experimenting with the pours on this beer. Slow pour and it becomes a flavorful dark liqueur with no head. Hard pour and you get more of a stout look, with better head retention and lacing possibilities. This beer must be in a snifter or an oversized wine glass at all times, to impart better smells and expand better tastes. Top shelf. This beer doesn't have to be improved, but if the body were thicker and the head were as well, Breakfast Stout would be literally perfect. But what is perfect in life?

The flavor follows with a pop of espresso bitterness. Big roasted malt. It’s aggressive and opens the palate immediately. Flavor follows with a bittersweet/milk chocolate.

I get a little bit of chocolate in there as well. Flavors of caramel and roasted malts and coffee are the strongest up front. Chocolate plays very much a supporting role. Slight roasty bitterness is apparent, but the 60 ibus go unnoticed. I don't pick up any hop flavor, really. Kind of sweet for me. Carbonation is great in this: smooth yet lively. I could take this a little more viscous, however. This is a good stout, but nothing mindblowing. A bit too sweet for my liking overall.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,James773,4.04,"Smells warm and vaguely like coffee, but more like chocolate as the beer warms up. Tastes like velvety chocolate, coffee, oats, and just the slightest hint of bitterness. Very slightly effervescent and not too thick. Can't taste the alcohol at first but it very subtly warms your tongue and throat. A solid stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,jbwimer,4.27,"Last bottle. Apparently I had forgotten about it as I found it behind some ketchup and Italian dressing. Good find! Bottled 9/28/13.  A- Aggressive pour yielded a finger of dark brown head. Doesn't retain very well. Ring of brown around the edge of the glass. This beer is a dark shade of black. Only light getting through is on the outermost edges. Hardly and lacing left on the glass.  S- Mmmm... This beer is pungent. I wish all of my breakfasts smelled like this. Dark roast coffee and dark chocolate dominate this one. A BOLD aroma here, and I like it. Not super complex, but incredibly enticing.  A- Almost as good as the nose. Really roasty. Coffee and dark chocolate flavors start off the sip and are washed down with a somewhat smooth sweetness. Feels a little empty. Roasty, but not as rich as I would like. Still, really good.  M- Medium carbonation with a thinner mouthfeel. Would love some more body to this beer. While it's not the strongpoint of this beer, it's good enough.  O- Lovely offering from Founders. Don't think it's as amazing as most people do, but it's still a damn good beer. I won't hesitate to buy this beer with regularity.

Fresh tobacco maybe. Hint of bitter dark chocolate. Found myself sniffing this before every sip. Really great.  T - to me the coffee dominates. Absolutely delicious. Thought I picked up some dark fruit as well. There's enough bitterness to offset the alcohol but the bitterness did not linger. Just enough to sneak that 8% in under the radar.  M - creamy. What you'd expect from a good stout. Slight carbonation. Excellent.  O - intoxicating!

Larger carbonation bubbles in the middle, smaller bubbles on the edges and reappear with agitation.  S- Roasted coffee. Toasted almond. Deep, dark and rich  T- Toasted almond, coffee, and chocolate notes. Lots of dark chocolate.  M- Full, thick. No carbonation here.

1199,11757,BeerEngineer,5,"General: Again found in a tiny beer store, thrilled to find it so I picked up 8 of them. Even at $8 a bottle (I’m in California), it’s worth every penny.  Appearance: Blacker than pitch with a magical tan head. The head is quick diminishing but it leaves lovely lace on the glass.  Aroma: Every ingredient on the label you can tell is in the glass by smell alone. The most pronounced scents are coffee and chocolate but there is a slight oatmeal heartiness that you can detect. Amazing!  Mouthfeel: So good I can’t describe it differently than “perfect”. This is what a stout should be as far as mouthfeel. It’s a little thick with a perfect carbonation.  Taste: Breakfast stout is the perfect name for this beer, it is breakfast in a glass. Tomorrow I’m actually going to have one when I wake up, the coffee and chocolate in it are a great combination and the oatmeal gives it great texture and smooths out the taste.  Overall: One of the best stouts that I’ve ever had. I really enjoy this one.

Tons of coffee and chocolate aromas on top of ashy/charred grains.  Tastes like a combonation of dark and milk chocloate along with a cocoa powder sweetness. Soooo much coffee and soooo much chocolate. They both tango with the deep roasted malt flavors that are packed with oats. A deep, lingering bitter, and ashy aftertaste. Like licking an ashtray in a good way.  Full, silky, chewy. Carbonation gives it a little bit of crispness.  To me, this is like a threesome with Cheerios, Herseys, and Starbucks.

1199,11757,TheFizzinator,4.46,The roasted coffee beans is the overwhelming smell and taste here along with dark chocolate. The appearance is a midnight black stout with a darkish tan head. But along with those flavors and notes there is a whole oat taste that melds ever so slightly with the delicious malt in the brew. The mouthfeel is a deliciously light syrup with light carbonation that has a slight lingering of licorice and dark chocolate in the finish.

Super sweet but not cloying, moderate coffee bitterness, with the coffee flavor done to perfection. The coffee is more of a dark roast with a hint of espresso. The chocolate/coffee/oat combo is really outstanding.  M - Moderately thick and chewy with low carbonation. This isn't quite as viscous as other stouts, but the mouthfeel is still great.

Luckily for me, not many people at the party had one, so I was left with a few laying around the house and it took me about a year to finish drinking it, but every time I went to the well, I would pickup on different flavors budding or mellowing. After a year in my cellar, the taste was knock out. Any bitter notes were wiped away and it was drinking more like a hearty chocolate stout, but the coffee notes prevented it from being too sweet.

Some lacing is left behind, but not a lot.  S: Gotta love how coffee-forward this one is. Coffee-forward anything is going to get me excited, and this pulls that off brilliantly. More and more chocolate appears when allowed to warm up. I pick up hints of oatmeal, too. God this smells great.  T: Tastes great, too. A healthy wisp of dark chocolate appears right before all the coffee hits the palate. Oatmeal and even a faint kiss of hops appear on the back end, too. It's not the complexity, it's the way every flavor coalesces with each other that makes this so damn delicious.  M: This isn't a particularly dry coffee stout. I mean, I suppose it isn't the most drinkable. The finish is very wet and lingering, if not SWEET per se. It's just such a joy to savor this.  O: I've been reading threads saying how Founders sucks...SERIOUSLY?

T: Astringent coffee, anise, pepper, maybe even some smoked meat, rounded out by maple, cinnamon, and oatmeal flavor imparted by the malt. Coffee bitterness sticks around but is tempered by that sweet and smooth flavor of the oats.  M: Carbonation is alive and adds a nice lightness to otherwise heavy bodied beer. Great creamy texture and the warming sensation on the throat from the booze is a great touch.  O: The only breakfast staple missing from this epic stout are eggs. It's the breakfast of champions - coffee, oats / cereal, smoked meat, and even a splash of booze.

Among the most intense aromas of any beer I've smelled.  T- The taste perfectly reflects the aroma. Chocolate, vanilla, coffee, caramel and molasses laced with a smoky character are pronounced, start to finish. Slightly bitter in a way that offsets the extreme sweetness a beer with 8% abv carries, brings incredible balance to the flavors.

Creamy feel with a a clear oiliness, nearly perfect example of an oatmeal stout.  O- This is a perfect oatmeal stout.

If I still lived in Ohio, then this would be my winter beer. Every ingredient is blended perfectly to balance the alcohol content.  The fullness of this stout is only rivaled by some of the Russian Imperial Stouts I have had the pleasure to try. The oatmeal characteristic really shines on the nose and on the palate, but its chocolate characteristics are exquisite.

Incredible how raw and intense the chocolate and coffee bean aromas are – hard to imagine a more intense aroma.  (4.5) T: Loads of dark chocolate and espresso, molasses, herbal qualities, some vanilla, and caramel. Bitter with just enough sweetness to provide a nicely balanced finish. Pleasantly dry throughout.

The oatmeal adds a thick mealy texture. Alcohol presence is non-existent.  O: An increasingly delicious offering that will not disappoint.

1199,11757,mick303,4.51,"Founder’s Breakfast Stout. Poured a thick black colour, with a soapy light tan lace and film, with nice retention. Head died fairly quickly but film retention was great. 4.25 S – phenolic coffee and dark malts, dark chocolate, some of the oats have a perceived presence as well, or maybe its just very easy to visualize a bowl of oatmeal and coffee from the smell. Bitter roasty coffee, not much creaminess detected. Solid. 4.5 T – strong bitter coffee has a huge role initially, then more chocolate notes come in, dark cocoa powder, toast, dark molasses, coffee is really dominant in a good way, blends over and with the chocolate and oats. Malt body is quite solid. Finish is full of coffee and chocolate notes mashed together and a dryness that lingers. Hops are nicely present to give some earthy and herbal qualities, it has a slight licorice character, and it works together nicely. 4.25 F – big and slick, but a pleasant presence while on the palate, espresso-like quality. Slight/moderate carbonation, gives it a syrupy and big feel. Smoothness from oats and chocolate help balance out the significant bitterness. A hint of alcohol spice but worked nicely. 4.75 An excellent breakfast stout with amped up coffee flavours, but still allows the constituent ingredients to shine. This worked well together to provide a unique and pleasing experience, might have to try to brew a batch. This beer might not be for the unexpecting but its bigness is a bit tempered by the subtle creaminess and smooth black coffee finish. As it warms more of the chocolate and oats come through really fleshing out a nice balance. Delicious.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,titty_mcbitty,4.8,"This beer pours jet black with a thin dark-tan head.  And it smells wonderful. Chocolate, toffee, and malt.  So this tastes perfect, in the sense that it's creamy at such a perfect degree, and the chocolate and oats are mixed in so well that I get every bit of them without any imbalance. Coffee hints itself from beginning to end through the chocolaty goodness.  Mouth feel is creamy and incredibly smooth. It's not a light beer, but not heavy. It's perfect.  Overall this is a world-class beer and it deserves its title as such. It's the closest thing to perfect for a double stout that any beer can get (with the possible exception of Speedway Stout). I've bought four of them in three weeks because I can't stop drinking them. Cheers!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

It pours a jet black untranslucent liquid, thick and oily in appearence, a 3-4 fingers of chocolate colored foam formed, medium to light belgian lacing left behind, medium head retention. As soon as poured it emanated a sweet, boozy, and extremely inviting aroma consisting of roasted specialty malts and sweetness. the nose was absolutely amazing, very very complex, tightly packed nuances creating an homogeneous matrix, hard to isolate one by one. had to explore (smell) several times to get used to it and then to start defragmenting it: very dark roasted malts upfront, sweet alcohol precence, a mix of bitter and sweet chocolate, and at last coffee are the main features. Taste is the same as the aroma, bitter sweet heavily roasted malts, alcohol, chocolate and coffee in that order, very very homogeneous. and somewhat bitter aftertaste, like the one following a bite of a bitter chocolate chunk and the residual fumes of sip of hot coffee. Mouthfeel is very very smooth and full heavy body, sticky in the lips amd rim of the chalice, adequate little to medium carbonation, alcohol present but not overwhelming. Overall a boozy, rich chocolate-coffee double stout, thick, silky and chewy. very malt forward, bitterness is present but is not as promiment as other stouts like old rasputin or tenfidy (maybe due to ageing), coffee as well might have lost the fresh grounded aroma and flavor because although present now is definitely at a secondary or even tertiary plane.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,ZagZagg,4.14,"Bottle poured into pint glass  A: Deep deep black. Notable carbonation with a thin head, which dissipates quickly. No substantial lacing. Resembles a flat cola or cold coffee. Its obsidian character allows no light to pass. The surface bubbles with a slight shimmer. The meniscus carries a bit of a birch beer looking ruby.  S: Crisp malts, chocolates and coffee aromas dominate the nose. Can’t place this certain spiciness, could be a sort of burnt smell, not sure I’m getting much of the oats/oatmeal. Definitely rich and powerful, it almost smells heavy.  T: The burnt element is evident in the initial taste. The chocolate is a dark chocolate, lacking real sweetness. Like a dark straight Columbian coffee. The bitterness is well balanced (especially for 60 IBU). Still not picking up much of the oatmeal or essence of oats. The aftertaste is akin to the lingering flavor after the last sip of a morning coffee, a bit dry.  M: Carbonation doesn’t play as much as much as expected from the appearance. Smooth, sort of slippery. Very similar to the way it looks. Becomes a bit creamy as it sits on the tongue.  O: I haven’t tried my hand at oatmeal stout before, but this is tasty. I don’t know if complex is the term I would use, but certainly rich and full of chocolate malty flavor. I could see myself enjoying one of these in the morning, but not too many.

The taste follows suit; strong coffee, rich chocolate and a touch of hops. Mouthfeel is great, but could be a little creamier in my opinion.

1199,11757,biegaman,4.57,"Breakfast has been burnt! This stout has a complexion of char and an ink-black coloured body. If you squint hard enough you can see little white flakes of bubbles fluttering up to the top where they contribute to a thick frothing of foam. At rest, this head has a light cappuccino stain but swirling awakens an intimidatingly deep, rustic brown colour and nearly doubles it in size.  The aroma does indeed bring one to the breakfast table; the smell, unmistakably, is coffee. Freshly ground beans served pipping hot. And they are complimented by a dab of chocolate truffle, a hint of rye bread, and what must be a boatload of roasted (nearly burnt) malts. It's both breakfast and dessert. It jolts your head back, flaring up the nostrils, while at the same time eases the neck and narrows the eyelids.  The flavours are simple but they are abundant; in order: coffee, roasted malts, coffee, roasted malts. Oh, and then coffee. Sure, I could be more creative - it doesn't take much imagination to equate this with all kinds of rich, decadent, tasty desserts (crème brûlée or dark chocolate truffles) - but I think ""Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout"" is a flavour in and of itself.  You'd might think somewhere between the 8.3% alcohol, the boatload of coffee beans and the heavily roasted malts, that something along the way might become a tad obnoxious, a tad astringent, or, let's face it, a tad too much ... but no. No, no and not at all. This beer defines the term ""creamy smooth"" and let's on but a hint of its actual strength.  So far as I'm concerned the two authorities on stouts in America - and the world, for that matter - are pretty much 50 miles in a straight line apart, in Kalamazoo (Bells) and Grand Rapids, Michigan (Founders). This brewery was certainly not the first to add coffee to their Imperial Stout.

Smell is complex, mocha coffee chocolate is most often noted, but on different sniffs I noted more coffee at times, more chocolate at times, and a smokey cigarette smell at others. When tasting, the nose is ever present, and that's when I notice the smokiness the most.  The taste itself is not as impressive as the nose, in my opinion. Roasted malt reigns, mocha in nature at heart. The bitterness that is there is a coffee bitterness, and the mouthfeel is a coating of roasted coffee feel.  The average rating gives away the quality of the beer. The taste for me wasn't overly special if detached from the smell, which is not something one should necessarily deconstruct, they say.

Minor grainy notes break through as well, most likely from the oats.  Taste: Coffee is the dominant flavor here. It is rich, the dark roast really holds its form against good showings from other flavors. Creamy chocolate attempts to even out the strong coffee. The oats and grains start to break through as the beer warms. The alcohol creates a tart and dry finish.  Overall: Took me awhile to get around to this one but boy, it did not disappoint.

A small tan head lingers for a time with minimal lacing.  Aroma: a great nose also - some heavy chocolate / cocoa with roast coffee as well. Not all that much else, but the chocolate and coffee are so well-rounded and reaking of quality that it doesn't matter.  Taste: here it drops away a bit for me - far too much coffee for my liking. I will admit I am not a coffee fan but generally I still like stouts which are coffee-centric. This one is dominated by coffee far too much - I was expecting more chocolate to come with it considering it was a 'double chocolate coffee oatmeal', not simply a 'Coffee Stout'.  Mouth feel: a heavy mouth feel with moderate carbonation. Just enough to bring the flavour through nicely. Slightly dry on the finish.  Overall: a very well constructed piece of brewmastery. Whilst the profile may have been dominated by roast coffee, I can't be hating too much as I am not a big fan of coffee at all.

1199,11757,BenjaminStout,5,I obviously really enjoy this beer. I drink stout beer every chance I get and I find myself comparing a lot of them to this beer. The right amount of coffee with the light nuance of dark chocolate makes me a happy beer drinker. I can detect the taste of a fine stout with a smoky undertone.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,woodchipper,5,"I am revising a 3 year-old rating on this beer (no prose on previous rating). Slowly but surely this has become my favorite beer. Sure, I like other styles, actually NE IPA is the best. But really, Founders OMBS is the best of everything. I look forward to it every year. It is never too sweet like some other stouts. Great mouth feel. Love the coffee. Love the baby on the bottle! I can never say I have a favorite son (I have 3) but this beer really is super dependable for me.

1199,11757,beatenbyjacks,4.52,"Appearance - Tar black with very little lacing or head on this beer.  Smell - Lots of roasted malts. Hints of vanilla and dark chocolate with a slight quirky scent on the end  Taste - After letting this one warm up this was great! Dark dark dark chocolate. Nice strong malt build. Subtle oaky flavor as well.  Feel - smoky flavor stays on your tongue for a bit of time. rich and strong, but very easy to drink.

1199,11757,MikeG304,4.73,"Poured from bottle to pint glass. Was waiting for this one and saved it for Thanksgiving dessert.  Poured Dark brown to total black. No light coming through at all. Very slight dark tan head that did not hang around long. As soon as I finished the pour the aroma of chocolate hit me. My wife even noticed standing next to me. Awesome nose. I just sat and sniffed for a couple of minutes. I expected more chocolate than coffee taste but the coffee was dominant, with a little sweetness at the start, with the cocoa flavor along with espresso as it finished. Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth with very little carbonation. Overall one of my favorite stouts so far. Definitely lived up to its billing. Can't wait to try the KBS.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Tonmeister,4.16,"Bottle Served in Snifter  Appearance: very dark, black, no light goes through the glass. Surprisingly has a thin brownish head, but that may be due to how it was poured.  Aroma: dark roasted malts, sweet chocolate, sweet dark roasted coffee. It has a balanced aroma you get both the bitterness of the malt and the spices and the sweetness of the coffee and the chocolate. The biggest aroma would have to be the dark chocolate.  Taste: bitter on the front end and the complexity of the beer changes in the middle leaving you with a sweet wet finish. The chocolate definitely cuts through towards the end. The spices are the first thing to hit the palate. It's not really bitter but its not really sweet. I can't taste the alcohol at all.  Mouthfeel: Its moderate for a stout. It's not really thick, which is what I expected, but it still is syrupy. leaves a sweet wet finish.  Overall: This is a great Imperial stout. Definitely not what I expected, I guess I had a pre conceived notion on how this beer would taste. Honestly, It's nothing special. It goes down fairly smooth and it doesn't have a chocolate/coffee explosion, but it does have a unique taste. I would definitely buy this again. I will take some time to drink it again and re-review it since my sinus aren't up to par, this re-view may be a little biased since I cant taste the full effect.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Mises85,4.71,"Served in a snifter about 55 degrees.  Appearance and Aroma: Pure black with 1.5 inch head. Initially spicy at first but develops into light cocoa, dark roast/espresso coffee, malt, dark chocolate.  Taste: I thought it was going to have a big hop backbone but the taste was all espresso and dark chocolate. Touch of roastiness. Some malt but not too much.  Mouthfeel: medium to thick. The mouthfeel was excellent and very balanced.  This beer is definitely in my top 5 easily. Not #1. That goes to Bigfoot.

Intense, burnt, spicy espresso, but more so, with a big kick to the gonads to get you up and about. Spicy, rich, earthy. Not much else though. More would make this a huge winner.  Taste is kind of similar. Big choco-malt flavour upfront and on the back as well. Touch of espresso as well, but more meek and feeble. Roasty, a bit spicy, kind of vegetative more than anything though. Like a coffee beer but underroasted.  Smooth body, has a bite on the back from the bitterness though.  Not hugely enamoured of this. It kind of sleepwalks a little through the coffee bear territory without ever enlivening the senses.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,EliotTruelove,4.29,"Very lovely.  Appearance: Although it pours thick like a stout it seems to look as if it sits in the glass a bit more liquidy and thin than other stouts. Not a criticism, just an observation.  Smell: Steel is what I initially thought of, followed by a strong coffe smell and hints of other chocolate stouts i know and love. I have a clogged nose however so I cant judge this category too well.  Taste: This beer seems to be hit or near miss for me. Sometimes i'll love it and other times I'll only like it. Tonight was one of the latter nights. It was good, but perhaps my tongue wasnt in the mood for a stout tonight and it skewed my perception. Tonight was great, but nothing to brag about; whereas other times ive had it I sing its praises from the rooftops. I wonder why that is, why the differing quality between bottles and batches. It has Coffee, Dark Chocolate, and a distinct grain flavor to it.  Mouthfeel: very positive, always balanced from the tip of the tongue, into the middle, then down the backof the tongue into the throat. Not predominant in any one area, very balanced throughout.  Overall: This is a beer i come back to often, and im always surprised at the differing ways i feel about it. Sometimes its ""meh"" and other times its ""legendary"". The legendary times make me endure the ""meh"" times and keep me coming back for more.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S: nose gets better and more church-like (wood, incense, spice) as it warms. It's crushed coffee beans and bitter dark chocolate. As an espresso drinker, this is my home style.  T: But the flavor is explosively following the nose. Bittersweet chocolate along with espresso. Then citric hops play a central role in transitioning to the long, dry, resonating bitter finish. Great finish. Great meditation beer.  As an honored review wrote: ""Sweet and bitter vie for supremacy, with bitter winning in the end. The finish is more than long, it's downright obstinate.""

1199,11757,eddibilderback,4.95,"I think this is the perfect stout. I know many out there would argue some of the bigger bolder (harder to get) stouts are superior, but I think this is just right in many ways. While the likes of Founders KBS and CBS are of course delicious, they can be a bit overpowering in taste, abv, and price. Not to mention nearly impossible to find. I find that stout's are often too thin, bordering on a porter or too big and just a bit too much to truly enjoy. At 8.30 the alcohol is barely noticeable, not even a hint of booze. The smell is of roasted coffee and dark chocolate, flawless as is the pitch black appearance with light brown foamy head. I've chased all the big stouts and after a few years of experimenting, I've come back to this as my all time favorite. The best part is the price, at $9.99 and readily available you can't beat it. If it were in large format (22 oz) that would translate to about $4.50 for a bomber for a world class beer. Considering you can't find a decent large format stout for under $8, that works out to be a tremendous value. Cheers!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Leaves a bitter coffee aftertaste. Understandably a breakfast stout.  Mouthfeel- Maybe the highlight of this beer. Smooth and creamy, this beer travels down the throat as smooth as any other.

The heads last a little while before dying down to a half finger, leaving light lacing behind.  Aroma: (4.5) Gigantic waves of robust, dark roasted coffee waft up towards your nostrils as soon as you raise the glass to your lips. The coffee smells very fresh and rich. Beneath the burnt beans is a light, herbal hop spiciness. Fresh oats and rich, semi-sweet baker's chocolate peek through the wall of coffee more and more as the beer warms. The coffee really balances out of the sweet smelling chocolate and oats.  Taste: (4.5) Right away, your palate is assaulted by dark roasted coffee beans that sustain through out of the taste. Just as in the nose, some leafy, herbal hop spiciness rises alongside the coffee's bitter astringency. Middle of the taste, a strong, firm dark chocolate presence and creamy oats coat your palate thoroughly. The beer finishes fairly dry, leaving tons of long lingering notes of coffee, rich chocolate and oats on your tongue.  Mouthfeel: (4.75) Full and thick creamy body with moderate to high carbonation. The creamy, full texture of this stout really sets itself apart from other oatmeal stouts.  Overall: (4.5) Wow, this is just a pitch perfect example of both an oatmeal stout and a coffee stout; The coffee presence isn't overbearing and the creamy, silky texture of the body just really sends this stout a cut or two above it's competition.

1199,11757,BrownNut,4.19,"2012 release aged one year (one year from when I bought it anyway - don't know how old it was already). Served just cool in a tulip.  A - 4.0 - Black with tan head. Not too much head even with a moderately aggressive pour, and it doesn't last long.  S - 4.25 - So aromatic even when at pouring distance. Serious coffee aroma with something underneath it that is a balanced mix of not too sweet cake, bittersweet chocolate, and some culinary cousin of cardboard, but not in a bad way! Sort of related to that used coffee grounds in a wet paper filter smell. Also a hint of caramelly malt bordering on steely. I'm surprised the coffee smell lasted a year. Later in the glass we start to approach a partially sweet brownie liqueur note and the metal smell is gone.  T - 4.25 - A chocolate falling between bittersweet dark and baker's. A hint of brownie. But overall not particularly sweet in that way. A hint of steely metal, which I don't recall from last time. I taste the coffee less than I smell it but it's in the mix. I get zero booze, and just a hint of booze fumes wafting up the throat afterwards. Later in the glass I get more of a baked goods note, of a chocolate variety but again not all that sweet, and the metal note has faded to a vagueness where you can't really identify it as that anymore. Towards the end of the glass is the most coffee-ish it has tasted, surprisingly. I'm definitely left with coffee breath at the end of it, more like mocha breath.  M - 3.75 - Thinner than I remember. I'd call it medium bodied. I'm not really getting that silky oatmeal feel. Leaves a very slight abrasion and slight tingle on the tongue.  O - 4.25 - Yep, it's a top stout for sure. Very flavorful yet not too sweet. I'm not sure if aging it a year necessarily changed it in any memorable way.

1199,11757,JackMcAwesome,4.77,"Bought the four pack finally. (I'm not sure how I feel about four packs...)  When I think of Beer, I think of a kid gobbling up breakfast, and so does Founders apparently. They put a very ambitious looking youngster on the bottle chowing down on some breakfast, already making me regret not pouring this into a bowl of Cheerios.  Look: It pours an awesome black void. The head is one finger in thickness, and it's a brown pillow of awesomeness. The lacing is optimal. So with all that being said, I can't imagine this being ""improved upon"". So it gets a very rare 5 from me. Just a solid looking beer.  Smell: I love the complexity of this. For a few basic ingredients you can detect right off the bat, it still has a lot else going on. Those basic few being Chocolate, Coffee, and Oats. It combines to create a cappuccino like smell, and the alcohol compounded on that, creates a near perfect aroma, that as far as I can tell, never falls off. That is the one thing I look for the most, whether the smell tapers off. This one doesn't.  Taste: Follows the nose completely. Once you taste it, you are able to identify the chocolate as the bitter kind, not the sweet kind. (This is a good thing)  Feel: Medium/Heavy in texture, like a good stout should. Carbonation seems to be on the low end, which just gives more attention to the taste in my opinion. The ABV is non-detectable to me. Very well hidden, and to me, that's what makes this something you can have any time of day.  Overall: I have heard things about this one from time to time on these very forums, but I never really took it to heart. I love stouts, and knew I would have to try it some day. MY GOD I'M GLAD I DID. This is one beer that lives up to the hype. It's just so balanced and tasty, and you can smell the very last sip. It's really good, and probably my new favorite. I'm hesitant to give 5's across the board, but this one is as close as it gets.

The aroma on this is fantastic, lots of espresso and chocolate up front with hints of dark fruit underneath. The roasted quality alone is great. The taste kicks it up a notch, even more espresso, even more chocolate wrapped up in a neat bitter bow. Both the chocolate and espresso lean more to the bitter side, not a whole lot of sweetness here. Lighter side of full bodied, with a completly hidden ABV.

1199,11757,BBThunderbolt,3.49,"Thanks to CaveDave for this one. Poured into 10oz goblet. Poured a solid black color, as expected, with less tan 1/4 inch of light brown head that very low (almost zero) retention, and very light lace.  Coffee was certainly the dominant scent, it took lots of sniffing to find any underlying malt or grain. I didn't pick up any chocolate in the nose either. On the tongue, coffee was still the major force of this beer. The chocolate did show up, put it wasn't enough to balance out the roast, almost burnt, taste of the coffee. The malt and grains played a cameo role in this act.  The body was far too thin for a big stout, it washed over the palate too quickly, leaving just an increasingly burnt taste at the back. Drinkability was OK, which is saying something as I am a confirmed coffee hater. Overall, a pretty good beer, certainly worth trying, and the more you like coffee, the more you'll like this.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Unlike some beers that smell like coffee but don't taste like it, the coffee still comes through, along with tons of chocolate. Big and thick, scrumptious. There may be good food pairings with this beer, but I would not want to distract one iota from the beer by having any food with it.  I enjoyed Sam Adams Imperial Stout, which was the first ""bigger"" stout I came across.

Conceive of the richest, biggest oatmeal stout you can. Then double it, without it getting hot. The key to this beer is its balance of flavors and its presence. It is an Imperial stout, only moreso. It lacks the precious raisiny/licorice flavors that seem to predominate in other big stouts (I'm thinking of you, Sam Adams); instead, it hints at those characteristics.  If you like stouts, you will like this one. If you don't like stouts, you should try this one. It hits the golden mean of Imperial stouts.

Coffee is the most obvious factor in the nose. Some notes of chocolate as well. Almost smells like an iced mocha. Can smell a hint of booze.  Tastes chocolatey on the front end, and bitterness builds to the back end into a dark chocolate and coffee taste. Finish is really nutty. Does not taste boozy per se, but some how I can just tell this is a high ABV brew based on its intense flavor.  Velvety and smooth in the mouth, little carbonation.  I do not often drink stouts, so I feel a little out of place here rating a ""world-class"" version of the style. That being said, this beer really makes me want to explore the style more.

Appearance: Oil..thick, black motor oil with a very thin brownish colored head. My wife thought it looked gross, but to me there was something very appealing about this one. That dark, rich tones gave away that it is going to be packed with flavor.  Smell: Coffee, coffee, some more coffee and a slight hint of some alcohol. As it sat for a few minutes I was then able to pick up slight hints of chocolate, but coffee was the dominant scent.  Taste: COFFEE!!!! Like a nice, rich cup of iced coffee with just enough chocolate to make this feel like an after dinner drink or dessert. Absolutely delicious.  Mouthfeel: It was smooth and silky on the tongue. A velvety texture making it feel all the more like a dessert than an actual beer.  Overall: I can say I definitely see the hype behind this beer and it absolutely deserves all the praise. As I have said before I have tried a few stouts but was never truly a fan of any of them.

Smell - Malts, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, roasted nuts  Taste & Mouth - There is a below average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, chocolate, and vanila. There is also a bit of coffee and some roasted/burnt nuts.  Overall - A great smelling beer and a very solid taste as well. It does seem a little muted so I will have to give this a try fresh.

Very much like coffee with the crema on top.  Smell was predominantly coffee, a slight hint of alcohol, and some chocolate on the bittersweet/baker's chocolate side. A hint of vanilla.  Taste of dark roasted, but rather generic, coffee very nicely melded with a chocolate flavor that was sweeter than expected from the aroma - not quite milk chocolate, but not intensely bitter or harsh. Nicely balanced malts with some hints of caramel. Did get an extra hit of bitter on the finish but it was not objectionable. More or less what I would expect from black coffee mixed with slightly sweet hot chocolate. Very nicely balanced.  Mouthfeel was silky smooth, no burn from the alcohol, very slightly astringent. Very low carbonation as expected for the style. Big fan of the smoothness oats add to a stout, and this was no exception.  Overall a truly outstanding brew. Smooth and delicious with an almost decadent feel about it - something to be experienced and savored.

1199,11757,gr0g,4.32,"Adapted from Pintley notes written 10/24/2011. Pours black, like, coffee black, with a thin head. Just wisps of lacing. Coffee grinds dominate the nose. Totally smells like freshly ground coffee. I've got no problem with that. Notes of dark cocoa and charred toast to a lesser extent.  First few sips are while the beer is probably somewhat overchilled, certainly below 50 deg. F. As expected, a solid coffee note comes to the forefront, black coffee (as opposed to coffee with cream or milk). Equally solid bitterness as the advertised 60 IBUs show up, but it seems ""just right,"" and it's more of a coffee-like rather than hop-like bitterness. As the brew warms, more flavor notes can be picked out: cocoa powder and a touch of sweetness. Hardly any discernible alcohol note. The smooth mouthfeel of an oatmeal stout complements the flavor very well; the carbonation is spot-on. While I recall previous releases being almost silky, the 2013 release doesn't quite get there, the carbonation being more prickly.

T - Taste seems different each time. Sometimes it is dominated by coffee flavor sometimes it is a chocolate flavor. Sometimes it just tastes roasty. The coffee flavor seems like run of the mill coffee(Like drinking coffee at work or waffle house). M - Seems watery and thin to me for a coffee stout. Would like it to be thicker and stick around.

1199,11757,artoolemomo,4.24,"Appearance- Pours up about a finger's worth of head which doesn't seem to have much retention. The head is a medium to dark beige while the body is an opaque, dark chocolate black.  Nose- Very heavy on the coffee. I hope the flavor profile doesn't reflect it too much but there are lots of roasted malt notes here. They don't hide the chocolate and the small amount of fudge but it pretty much obscures any other aromas.  Taste- Plenty of coffee but it is much more seductive and accessible than that of the nose. Some chocolate but this really is a breakfast stout- even more than KBS which I like better. This is a coffee drinker's delight and one that I enjoy as well. The dry finish makes for a very neat and clean flavor profile. Some chocolate and oatmeal but coffee really is the star of the show. A bit simplistic but still pretty good because coffee used is very well rounded to the extent that it's almost exquisite. The chocolate, while not very explicit, helps to smooth it so that it has none of those woody or sour notes you get with some coffee stouts. I wish I could say more but this is just a really good beer that doesn't muck it up with a lot of complexity. Presence, balance, and integration- it's got all of those but complexity? Not so much.  Mouthfeel- Medium bodied with light carbonation. Somewhat of a dry finish.  Drinkability- Very deceptive despite its lack of nuance. Rich but smooth coffee. I think I could dump this on ice and a coffee drinker wouldn't know the difference. The 2.50 to 3 bucks it usually goes for seems like a bargain. What I paid for it, is not.  Overall- Really good beer that is almost great. A little too simplistic for my tastes. This is not to say that the coffee used isn't complex, just that other notes aren't prominent enough. Definitely worth a try but you probably already know that. Not as amazing as advertised and I won't be going through the trouble to get this again. I would drink it all the time if it were easily accessible and around 3 bucks a bottle. But I'm on the West Coast and that ain't happening.

1199,11757,Deanosaurus,4.36,"I've been hunting for coffee beers and this was recommended to me by the guy at Friar Tuck's. I bought a 6 pack and have been enjoying it all week long.  - Appearance (4.25/5) Nice dark color. Nothing really pops out of it on the edge or head, although the head does have a unique texture to it. As far as color during pouring or around the edge though it doesn't have much, it's just plain dark. I like that.  - Smell (4.5/5) Strong coffee scent that isn't reflected in the taste which was sort of disappointing, but it was nice none the less. Maybe it's a subconscious connection between coffee and warmth but the smell did make me feel warm.  - Taste (4.25/5) Like liquid chocolate; dark chocolate, but not bitter. The was a mild coffee undertone, but as I said it was not reflective of the smell. Of course that is how coffee tends to be on its own, does NOT taste like it smells. Good malty finish though. The chocolate stays with you for a while but that nice because whatever they used to make that flavor is high quality.  - Mouthfeel (4.75/5) Super thick and yet smooth at the same time. It actually does feel as though I ate a piece of chocolate by the end of it, which typically makes me want water.  - Overall This beer is what the label says, ""Breakfast Stout"". For some reason it would just taste better in the morning with some bacon or sausage or one of those Jimmy Dean skillet breakfasts with potatoes and peppers and onions and eggs.

1199,11757,Benish,4.24,"Poured into snifter glass.  Appearance: the beer looked insanely thick as I was pouring. Pitch black in color - can't really expand on that. A short brown head built up while pouring but it wasn't anything crazy thick or large.  Smell: smelled the bottle and it was instantly coffee. I mean straight up coffee and no chocolate. When smelling from the glass, the roasted coffee is still intense but also picked up some sweet chocolate. For some reason, the aroma reminds me of those coffee beans coated in chocolate that you eat . Eating those, you get the woodsy bitterness of the coffee bean but than the chocolate blends in as you chew it.  Taste: the bold coffee flavor instantly comes in; you might have to like coffee to appreciate this. I myself enjoy good coffee and I have to say I'm really enjoying this. I pick up bitterness from both coffee and chocolate. The bitter coffee is more up front but there is also that subtle earthy bitterness that leans toward unsweetened baking chocolate. I cannot emphasize enough, this beer is all coffee and well....beer. I do however wish there is a bit more depth in the beer. It taste pretty much the same from start to finish.  Mouthfeel: creamy, thick, full bodied.  Overall: the best non-barrel aged coffee stout I've had. I seriously would love drinking this in the morning.

Subtle hints of dark fruit and sweeter malt elements of burnt caramel. Also, a dash of tobacco and ash.  T - The coffee comes in first, but is coupled with chocolate nibs and roasted grains. The middle gets more bitter, as the hint of ash comes into the taste from heavily roasted grains, closing with a bitter thread that lingers. It is the bitterness of coffee, though, over a more standard hop finish, added to a roasted note that holds for a minute or more.  M - Silky smooth, with a certain weight, but not cloying or heavy. Easy to drink if it isn't gulped, this is a mighty sipper that rewards the time it is given.  O - This is among the best stouts in the business. It has a wide range of elements that work together to create a very drinkable beer. The alcohol is not so much hidden away as incorporated to make a more harmonious whole. The best thing is the incredible accessibility of this beer, in contrast to some of the other high water marks of the imperial stout.

1199,11757,tillmac62,4.68,"Bottled 9/13. Pours burnt motor oil black with a nice tall tan head with excellent lacing. The nose is of roast with chocolate and coffee notes. Full bodied with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Roast malt flavor is exceptionally well balanced with coffee coupled with dark chocolate and a sweet undertone. The coffee is quite detectable, but not overpowering such as Bell’s Java Stout. Hops are only detectable on the finish as a bitter compliment to the roast and coffee. Well carbonated. In short, Heaven in a Bottle. I bought 4 cases and will do some aging / cellaring evaluations. Needless to say, this is my favorite beer!  6 months age - The coffee has mellowed and the flavor profile is much more chocolate oriented. Some yeast has flocculated. Still magnificent.  9 months age - The coffee continues to fade and the roast is more noticeable against the chocolate. Most noticeable is the diminished head and lacing - only a finger and a half with poor lace retention.  12 months age - Lacing is, again, excellent, while the head is not as full as when fresh. The flavor profile is approaching a blend of coffee, roast and chocolate.  9/13 vs. 9/14.  Approximately 80% loss of head volume. Approximately 55% loss in retention time. Very severe loss in lacing.  The nose is much more intense in the 2013, especially in regards to alcohol notes. This is surprising, I would have expected the 2014 to be more intense. It suggests that aging produces enhanced aroma from chemical decay.  The body is heavier in the 2014 and has much more texture. The 2013 is heavy medium and smooth, the 2014 is full and creamy. Oddly, as they warm to room temperature (66 degrees), the 2013 almost becomes as viscous.  The 2013 flavor profile is more blended, less intense, less complex and has a flavor of being ""off"" a slight bit. The 2014 is rich with quite discernible coffee and chocolate aspects. Carbonation levels are identical. The 2013 has no distinct roast notes.  My conclusions, it's better at 4 months of age rather than at 15 months.  The final installment 0.5 years (2015) vs. 2.5 years (2013). I shall refer to them as aged and fresh.  Appearance - Identical head volume and retention. World class lacing fresh vs. poor for aged.  Aroma - Vastly superior nose for the fresh - rich coffee, chocolate and roast. Very little aroma when aged, just light chocolate and a very subtle stale note.  Mouthfeel - Dramatic difference in mouthfeel with fresh being full bodied and creamy with a finely bubbled prickly finish. Aged produces a medium body that is smooth with hints of creaminess and a slightly lower level of carbonation resulting in a finish that hints at being prickly.  Taste - Again the clear winner is fresh. Aging has reduced the coffee aspect precipitously to a mere hint while fresh is robust and complete with that coffee bite. Roast influence is also greatly diminished from aging by roughly 60 - 75%. Aging shifts the flavor profile towards chocolate, but not very sweet nor bakers bitter. Honestly, 2.5 year old FBS is better than many fresh stouts I've had; however, the result is inferior by a wide margin when compared to fresh. Aging 2.5 years has produced a subtle stale cardboard note that lurks underneath and comes forward in the finish and also allows alcohol to become briefly uncovered. Bear in mind that ""fresh"" in this case has been aged 6 months and honestly is not as good as it was when less than 30 days old.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Infiniteingest,4.24,"Generally: So, this a cellared 2012 BS, procured from Bayview Liquors here in Southie, where Rick is doing a fine job curating craft beers. I've been drinking this year's BS and have been smitten from one glass to the next. While I still see stars with the 2012, they are ever so slightly less scintillating. I can't say a word about how this 4 pack was cellared, so my critique has to avoid specifics, but this is not nearly as sexy as the fresh Breakfast Stouts I have been drinking.  The Pour: Black beauty with exceptionally fine (champagne fine) carbonation, and a nice cacao colored head. Looks positively scrumptious.  Face in the glass: Chocolate and coffee. Bright and well hopped, but it's all sweet roasty malts up front.  Temperature: Perfect at 50 degrees, but it warms well.  With Regard to Taste: Rather than concentrating with the time in the cellar, this 2012 tastes less bright and assertive than the 2013s I've been drinking. It's still delicious, but I've enjoyed the beer fresh a lot more than this older beer. It is not bottle conditioned, so there's that. I don't think it should be, per se, but I was hoping time would effect some interesting changes; not the case here.  Epitoma: Drink the Breakfast Stout fresh!

1199,11757,majorbase2,4.55,"Pours a black color with a big, thick foam head that has a silkiness resemblant of chocolate milk. Head dissipates to a thin layer across the top. A ring of lacing around the edges. Swishing the glass results in some nice lacing on the sides as well.  Aroma is sensational and complex. Smokiness and booze lead off. Soon after the heavily roasted coffee and chocolates hit. The coffee is one of the most vivid and genuine aromas I've ever seen (or smelled) in a beer.  Taste follows the nose. Chocolate features a little bit more strongly than the coffee, now. Similar to the aroma, the featured tastes in this brew are some of the strongest, most identifiable tastes I've ever tasted. The coffee and chocolate are so accurate, I would believe I was actually eating/drinking them. The booze does not distract from the flavor, despite the higher %. Some sweetness is present as well, and really takes over as it warms, layering the tongue with a sweet chocolate.  Medium-heavy bodied. Surprisingly little bite from the alcohol, and goes down very smooth if you let it warm a bit.  Overall, a sensational beer that is almost criminally easy to attain. For how good this beer is to find, it should be hard to find. A beer that is suitable for almost any occasion. You won't find many easier drinkers at this ABV, nor ones with this much taste.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,rdilauro,5,"01/26/15 Tasting: Right before the alleged snow storm of the century for the Northeast. While I prepared our house for heavy snows, potential electrical outages, I decided to sit down with the Breakfast Stout. I've been tasting so many different states this past month and have been loving them!. But just one aroma, one sip of Breakfast Stout and I was up in heaven again! The Sweet, but too sweet burnt chocolate taste blended amazing with coffee, strong, smooth, rich, powerful  So you get these two intense flavors blended together with a full bodied stout. Here is when I would vote 10 even when 5 is the highest.     It didnt take much more than holding the bottle. Right then I knew I was in for a total great experience. Once the cap was taken off, the chocolate, the coffee, the mocha, everything just filled the room. The pour was this jet black magic OIL.... Sliding down the glass with just enough of a white creamy head. Once my nose was into the glass, all of my senses started to kick in. The aroma, the hops, the malt, everything you can possible think as being good or better was there! Then the TASTE. Better than the smell or look. It was rich, it was full, it was balanced, it had chocolate, it had enough hops, it had enough carbonation, it held up to the very end. The finish was almost as GREAT as the Start.  If you have read some of my other reviews, you will know I am a big fan of stouts, even more so with chocolate stouts. I have been fortunate to taste a number of them, but this one will remain at the TOP.  03/16/13 Another tasting of the Breakfast Stout. After tasting many other really super stouts, this one still shines at the top. Right from the start its hard to find fault with this stout. The glassy oil like pour with its relatively small, but not the typical light brown head looks so inviting in the glass. Coffee, or almost espresso is the dominant nose before tasting. Closing my eyes , taking real deep whiffs from the glass, it could really be a cup of espresso. The taste is real big and bold, but soft and round. The espresso decreases a little here and I start to pick up hint of chocolate along with a roasted malt flavor. I really appreciate the little carbonation here, to me it helps balance this one. The mouth feel of this one reminds me of a big California Red Zinfandel, ones around 15% alcohol. Rich, full coats your entire mouth and just slides down your throat for the perfect finish. This Founders does pretty much the same. Left on a deserted Island with only allowed to have 3 different beers, this one would surely make it.  10/22/13 Had a 10/05/13 brewed Breakfast Stout. Can it get any better. I am beginning to think so",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Ryan_Graham,4.77,"I was pleased to learn that I could find a top-25 beer right down the street from me. I bought a four pack and I'm glad I did.  Pours black and opaque. Light brown head rests on top. Great lacing. The smell of this beer alone will blow you away. I get so many flavors from one whiff. Chocolate, coffee, caramel, oats. This is as full-bodied as it gets. The flavor is complex. Starts warm with a coffee flavor, goes down smooth, and ends with a chocolaty aftertaste. Great balance.  This beer definitely deserves its high rating. It's very unique. It brings such a complex flavor to the table. Even though I'm not a huge fan of coffee, I still love this beer's taste. Great job Founders, round of applause.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,JohnG190,4.63,"Pours inky black with a thin brown head. Nice lacing. Strong chocolate and coffee aroma. Taste follows nose - lots of coffee, dark roasted malt, with bitter chocolate coming on the back end. No hop flavor at all, finishes dry and slightly bitter. Full bodied with light carbonation. Very smooth. Overall, this is one well crafted stout! It's the Starbucks of coffee stouts!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Ranz,4.6,"A: Pours a luxurious, black and creamy without a ton of head in my whiskey snifter.  S: The aroma has a slightly over-roasted, Ethiopian coffee character. You could also argue it has South American coffee notes because of the nuttiness. This has perhaps the best nose of any coffee beer I've experienced.  T: Hints of the chocolate are there, and the coffee is rather pronounced with a bold alcohol presence like a cudgel. You can certainly taste the 60 IBUs, for it has a pleasant spiciness. The aftertaste has dense malt profile; this paired with a rich 80% or higher cocoa would be marvelous.  M: Some alcohol singe comes through, but it has a subtle finish with the malt and coffee profiles.  O: People go completely nuts for this, and to a degree, I can understand. This is no KBS, but it is an excellent coffee-style brew. Plus, my amazing girl got me the four-pack, so it has a special place in my heart. Out of my four-pack, one is left for at least a year of aging, so I'm excited to see where this goes.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Pegasus,4.75,"Appearance; Deep mahogany brown body, impenetrable to light, crowned by a small, dense tan head, which retains quite well. Thin, fine-beaded lacing coats the glass walls.  Aroma: Roasted malt, dark roasted coffee, and bitter cocoa dominate the aroma. The high alcohol presence (8.3% ABV) is utterly imperceptible in the aroma. The coffee aroma utterly dominates the aroma.  Taste: Opens with a massive surge of cold coffee. As the taste progresses, bitter cocoa and sweet alcohol are notable, but serve as mere foils to the cold coffee flavors, which dominate the taste from start to finish. As the taste draws to a close some modest, at least in comparison to the over-the-top coffee flavors, present themselves. While the hops are presented at a very respective 60 IBUs, they seem but a mere afterthought against the staggering wave of coffee malt.  Mouth feel: Rich, smooth and velvety, with just a hint of carbonation.  Drinkability/notes: Staggering in its grandeur, it is difficult to overstate just how superb Founders Breakfast Stout is. If ever there was a ""bucket list beer"", this is it.  Presentation: Packaged in a stubby twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Jacobier10,3.86,"Appearance: Opaque black, small tan head with not much retention  Smell: Tons of coffee with dark chocolate overtones  Taste: The coffee is up front and in your face, dominating the flavor.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, full-bodied, and lightly carbonated.  I don't mind notes of coffee in a stout, but this was too overpowering for my tastes. Almost a wreckless use of coffee in my opinion. I would have liked a little more chocolate to come through in the flavor. I know this is one of the classic brews of all time but it just doesn't do it for me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,dexterk1,4.77,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is dark black and flows is viscous. Head is about an inch and has some staying power. Odor is complete with malt and coffee. Also sweet. Taste is of chocolate, malt and coffee. Dark chocolate near middle end and a pretty smooth finish. Alcohol is only slightly detectable which is good considering the abv. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy. Not as heavy as I though considering the look.

1199,11757,Abbbp,4.49,"I really wanted to side by side this with KBS so that I could really taste the difference, but the fact that it's so readily available now in DFW, heck I couldn't wait. In fact my people were telling me that they had so much of this that people were mixing it with pumpkin and old summer fruit beers... Heathens I say, but here we go..  The appearance is darn near perfect, unlike KBS which was so dark it was brown, this was so dark it was purple. Thin head, the most fragile of lacing, just a gorgeous brew.  The smell was dark burnt cocoa beans, roasted coffee beans, ground down, heated, cooled, then barreled to perfection and allowed to just grow with one another in a symphony of midnight burnt darkness. Just awesome!  That leads to a taste a bit strong for my palate though: taste and smoothness are my 2 factors that make something drinkable, but nonetheless this was still just a bit strong. Let this sit though, let it warm a bit, and it just gets that much more delicious.  All and all, I ain't sayin anything new here, but really this and KBS are the only 2 reasons I wanted, needed Founders in TX. The fact they set the table with all day, dirty bastard, centennial, and rubaeus (minus that lil KBS mistake/surprise in May ;) ) is all just gravy.  The western most state to get Founders is happy to have ya. Seek it, trade for it, any year in the past 3 will do.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Sludgeman,4.39,"Poured into a chalice. Served too cold, allowed to warm. A review of a rating originally down on 12/5/12.  My tastes must have changed in the past year or maybe I have just had the opportunity to taste more beer, but this review lowered my previous rating from 4.75 down to about 4.39. This is a top tier imperial stout but not my #1. Make sure you allow this one to warm up to really get all the flavors. Definitely take time to savior this beer as it warms. I like the idea of serving a bit too cold and then taking in the changing taste and aromas as it warms.  A – Pours a slightly viscous black with a dark tan one-finger rocky head that dissipates quickly. Some minor lacing.  S – Sweet, chocolate, roasty, coffee, rich, no alcohol, a whiff of tobacco.  T – Roasted malts then coffee, slight sweetness, definite bitterness in the finish.  MF – Thinner mouth feel than expected.

Ok lacing.  S: Smells like freshly ground dark roast coffee or a just opened high % dark chocolate bar. Bitter smelling.  T: It tastes like it smells. It almost doesn't taste like a stout. I get almost no malt. All that I get is coffee with some chocolate roastiness to it. Maybe this is much better with age on it after the strong flavors die down and mellow. It is all burnt coffee and roast flavors.  M: Smooth with almost no coarseness.  O: It smells great but I find the taste lacking something. I don't really get too much body here, it seems quite thin to me. This is much better mixed with Rubaeus. I like coffee to a certain point, but this one is overpowering. I prefer more subtle coffee flavors. I poured it into some Butter Crunch ice cream and it made the alcohol really pop, not in a good way. It was still good though.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S- Roasted malt, heavy coffee and chocolate, even a hint of booziness too. Gorgeous smell. Almost lightly burnt bread like.  T- Just incredible. Breakfast really is the perfect name for this stout. It's deep, rich coffee flavor is very espresso in nature. The chocolate gives it just the right amount of slight sweetness.  M- Smooth. Like black velvet. Not viscous like a Ten Fidy. Silky, smooth, oily.  O- Probably the best everyday stout in the US right now. It's perfectly balanced in every way. It feels like a treat every time I sit down and have one.

Smells toasty and roasty mostly of coffee with background smells of bittersweet and milk chocolate. Taste is full bodied coffee flavor that's very complex. Hints of chocolate and a creamy mouthfeel from the oatmeal make this a superb stout. There is just a tinge of alcohol flavor and its perfectly bitter. A sipper for sure.

Some dark malts, but mostly just chocolate and coffee in the smell. I'm not complaining. It smells amazing. Taste is similar to the smell, but surprisingly balanced for the type of beer it is. Not too sweet, it has some bitterness to back it up. Full bodied but not thick. This is not a huge RIS. It is a balanced coffee/chocolate stout with a high ABV.

S: A massive nose of rich coffee and chocolate; molasses, dark roasted malts, boozy (but not overly or off-putting).  T: Wow, a big hit of dark roast coffee dominates the palate, but also lots of roasted malt. The big grain bill is present as well with lots of sweet malt and rich, dark chocolate.  M: Medium-high body and medium-low carbonation; smooth, round, silky.  O: A delicious beer, great richness and tons of coffee and malt flavors (a minor criticism is that the coffee can be a bit overpowering).

1199,11757,JRPuffNStuff,4.34,"Pours thick and much less heady when chilled. It's super dark like a cup of Hershey's Syrup and deliciously creamy. There are very heavy dark coffee notes and pretty prominent dark chocolate/cocoa undertones.  I found this to be a great Stout as is noted by the score and plenty of users already. If you don't like Espresso you'll outright hate this beer, however, if you like a nice hot cup of coffee in the morning, this brew will certainly take a spot in your heart once you taste it. It truly is a perfect blend of rich coffee flavor without going overboard or heavily bitter. For me personally, it's not an everyday beer, but it's great for an after dinner wind down and I totally understand people saying they could drink this forever. As far as Stouts go, this one is on the money. I plan on getting a pack for after Thanksgiving dinner, which is kind of a perfect time for it, with a big ol slice of Pumpkin or Carrot Cake. For some reason this beer kinda had the feel of sitting in a 1940's wooden rocking chair listening to the am radio or something. Kind of odd, since I'm no where near old enough to know what that felt like, and I doubt many people reading this are, but I don't know, maybe you'll understand when you taste it, haha.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Huge sweet chocolate flavor, along with fresh roasted coffee, mild oats, and a sort of ice cream flavor. Super sweet but not cloying, moderate coffee bitterness, with the coffee flavor done to perfection. The coffee is more of a dark roast with a hint of espresso. The chocolate/coffee/oat combo is really outstanding.  M - Moderately thick and chewy with low carbonation. This isn't quite as viscous as other stouts, but the mouthfeel is still great.

T: Following the nose, huge roasted notes, chocolate, coffee, toffee and some mild almost indistinct bready yeast nose.  M: Creamy bubbles break into a huge malty thickness and espresso fumes like a surf bound, creamy, coffee-colored wave breaking onto a chocolate sand beach.  O: Ridiculously good. Drive 50 goddamn miles...no,100 goddamn miles to find this brew. It's fantastic, complex and exactly what you would want in a big coffee stout.  As it stands, this is a big tasty stout.

The mouthfeel is full bodied, but it is always on the lower side of carbonation, like pouring from a cask.  Awesome beer!  Edited 10/13/13:  2013 Batch  Taste this year is totally unbalanced bitter coffee and ashtray. The creamyness and smoothness from the oatmeal is completely hidden.

A: Pours like used motor oil, looks extremely thick, bordering on syrupy, when pouring. When poured aggressively into a tulip glass you get a nice finger and a half or so of extremely thick, dense, fluffy mocha head that hangs around for about five minutes before leaving stunning lacing. I just wish that head stuck around longer!  S: Like dark chocolate covered, espresso rolled vanilla, caramel and coffee chocolate balls. Someone compared it to the Cubano Style Espresso Brown from Cigar City, but I think that was more one note, while this opens up to be more complex and layered. Just a touch of heat on the very back end belies the 8.3% ABV.  T: Exactly like the smell, espresso, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, chocolate covered dark fruits with just the slightest warmth from the booze, which is complementary. I only wish it was even more intense and overwhelming.  M: Thick, chewy, but yields with the alcohol, though it still leaves a sticky film across your whole mouth.  O: Outstanding, delicious.

Roasty fresh brewed coffee and tons of chocolate and cocoa totally dominate. Also getting hints of warm milk, espresso, and just a touch of booze. The taste is just as big and just as bold as the nose! Huge amounts of roasty coffee and crazy intense chocolate are the stars. Toasted oats emerge as it warms along with hints of fresh cream, mocha, vanilla, and just a touch of cinnamon. The mouthfeel is unbelievably thick and creamy and absolutely smooth as silk. The balance is nearly perfect with malty sweetness up front and a subtle bitterness on the finish. Overall, I'm totally blown away. I've had this beer once before and remember really liking it, but not to this extent.

1199,11757,Duane_Opfer,4.6,"12 oz. beer poured into a pint glass. Bottled on 8/30. Consumed on 10/7.  A - Brown, approaching black in color. Gentle pour yielded a light amount of head, light brown in color. Moderate carbonation as observed from the top. Formed classic heavy layered lacing as beer receded.  S - Absolutely decadent. Reminded me of high-grade crumbled dark chocolate with vanilla, condensed milk, and nutmeg. Smell did not quickly dissipate.  T - Again, dark chocolate up front, with roasted coffee/espresso and condensed milk. The roasted coffee flavor included a slight tart acidity that intensified in the finish. Even now, 10 min removed from my last sip, I still taste the tartness on the back of my tongue. The higher ABV is not at the forefront of the beer, but complement the beer well, providing an overall warming feeling.  M - Creamy decadence. Had the creamy characteristics of a café au lait (think French Quarter/fresh Café Du Monde), yet also well carbonated, but not to the point where it affects the creaminess. Rather, they are mutual complementary, but I also get the nice tingle on the tongue. Also, has a kind of stickiness from condensed milk or a good milkshake.  O - I am not normally a stout fan, but I can appreciate the complexity and richness of this beer. I can't help but grade it highly based on its own merits. The only detractor for me was the lasting tartness on the back of the tongue which downgrade the taste and overall ratings from a 4.75 to 4.5. Still a phenomenal beer. Can't wait to try this with a nice cigar.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,HumanCarBomb,4.4,"12oz bottle  This beer pours black with a beautiful, thick mocha head. The smell reminds me of Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale from Cigar City. I know the chocolate is in there somewhere, but the intoxicating smell of burnt, roasted coffee grinds takes front row. Oats are present as well.  Tastes of freshly ground coffee, roasted oats and chocolate. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Drinkability is amazing considering this beer weighs in at over 8% ABV. This went down effortlessly!  In conclusion: This is a phenomenal stout! There's a reason why it's currently #22 on BA's top 250 beers. As far as oatmeal stouts are concerned, I rank this right up there with Stone's 12th Anniversary Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Can you say coffee?...Fresh roasted coffee dominates the nose. The taste buds are hit with black coffee, dark chocolate and toasted oats. There is a nice mild hop presence that provides a nice balance. The mouth feel is; smooth, thick, and a little chewy. The body is medium-heavy with a lighter carbonation.  For such a full flavor Breakfast Stout goes down easy, not filling, and is very satisfying. Another impressive Founders brew!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S - Chocolate, malt, toffee and some coffee.  T - Delightful coffee with some mocha. Deep, dark, rich maltiness. Really can't find any hoppiness in here. Bitterness seems to come from the coffee and chocolate notes rather than from the hops.  M - Heavy body yet smooth and very light carbonation.  O - Hands down, my favorite stout. Smooth but rich and thick. Full flavored with light bitterness. Brewers did a great job balancing the oatmeal, chocolate, and coffee.

Light lacing. Body is great, but a bit more head would be welcome.  S: Strongly of coffee. Chocolate. Mocha. Sweet. I can catch a whiff of booze. Pretty much what I was expecting! I was not disappointed.  T: Sweet, dark. Some malt. Appropriately rich. Finishes with nice bitter coffee flavors and a touch of mocha. A touch of warmth from the 8% ABV, but sits nicely in the mix. Coffee is a bit dominant.  M: Not bad, but I think the carbonation is a bit too pronounced. Not quite as smooth or full-bodied as I'd expected. Still, nothing to scoff at.  O: Tasty beer that I would gladly have for breakfast. Oatmeal? Check. Coffee? Check. Chocolate? Sure, why not. FWIW My wife reports it satisfied her ""sweet tooth"".

1199,11757,magictacosinus,4.75,"This is one of my favorite beers, but it's so delicious that a) I've always downed it and shared with others so not to seem greedy, and b) it's never received a proper review after all of this time. The bottle I'm reviewing is nearly a year old, to my knowledge, but I do know how this is fresh and therefore will be adjusting my scores properly. Thanks to everyone who's provided me a bottle over the course of the past year. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Pours a blackened treacle of a stout, appearing as opaque as the thickest ones in the style, and yet retains a humble appearance that is appealing and accessible. Amazingly, this looks a lot like freshly brewed coffee, with black tones, as well as a mocha head that coats the top in a foamy and long-lasting manner. Leaves a ton of lacing in its wake, which also is very coffee-like. Head retention is excellent, as always, and lasts a good long while. The alcohol legs are slightly intense, and leave behind coatings of foam along with the tears. It's an unmistakable beer in its category already in the appearance, that's for sure.  Smells of vibrant coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit notes, with a combination of sweetened and bitter phenols that is unbelievably appealing. At first, you get an immediate roasted character from the coffee that imparts bitterness, roasted notes, and fruity, slightly tropical notes (as found often in Kona and Sumatra) that resembles juicy plums, prunes, and peaberries. At the finish, there are notes of dark cocoa nibs and vanilla, as well as roasted barley and oats that impart the very feeling of walking into a room where a hearty breakfast is being cooked. The final result is uncanny - bitter and roasted, but sweet and chocolate-y with a robust, fresh edge. World-class stuff right here.  The flavor is by far the highlight right here - it is, simply put, an explosion of roasted freshly ground coffee, chocolate, barley, and fruity notes right at the front of the palate. At first, there's coffee, espresso ground notes that impart an appealing bitterness and flavor that is also fruity, with dank tropical and herbal notes. The chocolate soon follows, with incredible vanilla, nutty, and cinnamon notes, and perhaps a bit of syrup (maple?). Not sweet by any means, but extremely balanced in light of the coffee bitterness. Soon after, there are wonderful bready roasted notes from the barley, as well as a sharp zest and grassy sensation from the hops. The oats provide a more robust and breakfast-like flavor, but also a ton of creaminess that makes this wonderfully easy to drink. Goes down silky smooth, and I think stouts of this nature should always be this way. Come to think of it, I can see why I never got around to reviewing this until now - it's creamy, well carbonated, robust, velvety, dessert-like, and hearty. Absolute perfection.  One of the best stouts on the planet by default. I want this in my house year-round, and just like a great slice of pie, it works for any time of the day, any temperature, or any occasion. Brilliant stuff, and without a doubt Founders crowning achievement. I love this so much that I actually brewed a clone of this, but my copy did not reach the level of robustness that this hold even this late since it was bottled. The only off aroma may be a bit of soy saucy flavors while it's older, but it's still ridiculously flavorful. Recommended to the max. A masterpiece of a stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Gryphon69,4.53,"12oz bottle no date  A- Dark molasses brown. Not much of a head, what is there is a lighter tan in color. Some light visable carbonation.  S- From bottle, chocolate, espresso, nice deep roasted smell. Glass getting all that with stronger coffee than the bottle, more oats and some slightly bready, hints of vanilla and slight dark fruit sweetness. Smell is deep, dark and lingering alcohol.  T- Coffee, with a certain sweetness. Coffee is throughout and lingers into the finish. Chocolate and malts are pretty balanced in the middle and finish. Some alcohol in the middle and stronger on the finish. About half way down the bottle and the alcohol burn dies down considerably and the flavor really balances out.  M- Creamy and smooth, full body and fairly thick feeling. Carbonation was less pronounced in the feel.  O- I was actually expecting much more complexity in the flavor with all the higher reviews. I found the smell very good and keeps you interested, the flavor is deep, thick and very well balanced. More alcohol burn than I was expecting out of a 8.3 oatmeal stout, but still very drinkable. I was pleased with the full creamy feel. Plan on stocking up on this one and recommend it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,PaulyB83,4.48,"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip glass  A- Pours a pitch black with a small medium brown head that quickly dissipates, medium-heavy visible viscosity  S- Lots of coffee, and a medium chocolate sweetness with a faint sense of the alcohol. As it warms that classic Founders dark beer profile starts to poke through a bit and the coffee and chocolate are more in balance.  T- Very similar to the aroma, lots of coffee throughout and on the aftertaste, less sweetness of chocolate than the nose but more alcohol than the nose  M- Lighter mouthfeel than I was expecting but still a pretty heavy beer but with a relatively dry finish, like you find with drinking a nice cold pressed coffee.  O- This is an amazing coffee/chocolate stout! I would have liked a little more chocolate like that of the Samuel Smith Chocolate Stout but the coffee is the star here. Alcohol comes through as it warms up. This drinks like a perfect chilled espresso, delicious!  Note: Had a bottle dated on 9/28/13 on 11/27/13 and noticed a considerable difference in the pronounced coffee flavor of the fresh bottle. The ABV really comes through more in this one.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ludachris,4.42,"The beer going into the glass is a rich and deep hue of brown, but as a whole the body is black with the slightest tinge of chestnut brown coming through on the upper edges of the glass. Just shy of a finger's worth of creamy and dense mocha brown head slowly folds in on itself and stays neatly as a thin cap. Every sip leaves behind a thick strip of sticky lace.  Freshly roasted coffee beans are the first thing I pull out of this rich and rounded nose. The more whiffs I take the more I notice just how fresh it smells. The coffee character is cushioned by notes of dark chocolate, tiramisu, and a pinch of sweet tobacco. This is beautifully rounded with an enticing softness. Nothing is over pronounced but everything is rich and all of it goes without a hint of alcohol.  Coffee, coffee, and more coffee coat all corners of the mouth. Its impression is just as sweet as it is roasty and that makes it more tasty than overwhelming. A quick kick of alcohol and roasty bitterness runs along the back of the palate and leaves just as quickly as it came. Biscotti and a smudge of hazelnut filling nestle themselves on the middle of the tongue as the coffee leans over them. Bitter cocoa comes in the finish.  Where do I begin on the feel. It's luscious, creamy, and smooth as silk. It's so tasty you can't help but take sip after sip and the mouthfeel just encourages this. The only sign of its higher ABV comes how you feel after drinking a bottle of this quickly.  Peche Mortel move out of the way, this is the best coffee infused stout I've had to date. The use of oats does wonders for this beer in both the flavour and feel. This stout has it all and is dangerously easy to drink. All I can say is thank you Founders!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BalancingBrooms,4.5,"Pitch black with cappuccino 2 finger head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma is of dark chocolate and roasted black coffee with a subtle hint of plum. Taste follows the nose with a wonderful dark chocolate/deep cacao up front, that folds into a roasted black coffee and transitions towards a lighter bakers chocolate with hints of some red fruit that you'd find in a nice coffee. Ends very dry with a full/creamy medium body. Overall a wonderful stout, and one of my favorites because it hits on every character so boldly and is well balanced. Does not age well in my opinion, you loose that bright coffee and get a stale coffee instead, 6 months max imo.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,jonrx,4.56,"A - Extremely black with a lovely head. Not overly carbonated, but certainly not flat.  S -- Super heavy coffee smell. And not garbage coffee. Smells very high class. The chocolate and cream really comes out.  T -- Intense hit of coffee, but it is very sweet. You can really get a sense of how the brewer likes his coffee, I'd say! It resonates with me, since I drink mine in a similar fashion. But I digress. Pleasant aftertaste whereas the taste of chocolates and coffee really sits on the tongue.  M -- As someone who is not a general stout fan, this beer really took me by surprise. It's not heavy like mud, but it is certainly quite substantial. The stout is incredibly smooth and the alcohol is substantial, but it's hidden away nicely behind the coffee and cream tastes.  O -- Just a fantastic beer all around.

1199,11757,lacqueredmouse,4.25,"12oz bottle purchased from Slowbeer in Melbourne. Shared with Sam and Rich in Sydney.  Pours a solid deep brown, with a slightly pocked head of beige across the top of the glass which settles into a firm ring. Lace only forms dots, and the beer itself is less full and heavy as it might have been. Looks good though.  Smell is exceptional: big cocoa roasted characters, but hit with a huge, pleasant, boozy, slightly astringent and slightly spicy capsaicin character. Slight coffee notes, but not as much as they might have been. Instead, the raw cocoa bitterness comes through much more. It's surprisingly fresh: big and tasty.  Taste is much more integrated, and extremely pleasant, although for some reason it feels less aggressive and intense. Instead, the coffee works its way in pleasantly with some of the roasty oatmeal characters providing a broad and supple conglomeration of flavours. Feel is smooth and fine, perhaps lacking a little richness, but providing a broad basis for the interplay of flavours.  Overall, this is an extremely pleasant and well-integrated beer. It seems to have an almost fanatical following that I can't quite subscribe to, but it is indeed a lovely beer.

Was able to get very little head on it and the bit that I did is a nice, medium tan color. Excellent lacing, seems to really cling to the glass.  S - Bittersweet chocolate. Plenty of fresh roasted coffee. I also get a slight burnt/smokey aroma as well. Smells great overall but it's not very overpowering.  T - Tastes just like it smells, only more pronounced. I get a lot of fresh coffee right off the bat. Coffee gives way to drying, bittersweet chocolate that lingers on my tongue. There's a slight smokiness mixed in with the chocolate which is quite pleasant. Detecting just a hint of the alcohol but overall it's very well hidden. Great taste overall...it has everything I'd expect from a great stout.  M - Smooth, creamy and silky is the best I could describe it. Medium to medium-low carbonation.

The sweetness is balanced by a very strong coffee flavor. There's chocolate in there too, but to me, coffee is the defining flavor of this drink. They say it has caffeine...well, I believe it.

I didn't think they'd sell growlers of Breakfast Stout but, lucky me, they did. Poured midnight black with an extremely dark brown head with tinges of purple. Left sheet lacing down the glass after each sip. One of the best heads I've seen on a big stout like this.  There's a solid presence of roasted malts and a ghost like alcohol presence. You have a feeling it's there but can't put your finger on it. Anyways, all that's in the background. What steals the show is high quality freshly pressed coffee.  Flavor is identical to the aroma. The coffee is of the highest quality and quite intense. There's not as much noticeable bittersweet chocolate as the bottled version exhibits. The coffee produces a bitter component on the finish along with a, mild in flavor but noticeable in bitterness, hop presence.  Creamy heavy but silky smooth body leads into a moderate dryness on the finish. The carbonation is on the lower end of the spectrum but massages the tongue as it works through.  I could sip this beer all night long until I was unable to sip anymore. It's a slow drinking beer but immensly enjoyable.  I've already reviewed this beer in bottled form. I actually prefer the bottled version but this is spectacular none-the-less.

1199,11757,AmishLightning,4.53,"Founders does it again. Wonderful stout that I had at a beer tasting bash on 8/14.2013. I really had been looking forward to having this one ever since I heard about it. Glad to check it off my list.  Appearance: Black as black can be. Almost looks like motor oil when I poured it in my glass. However, it wasn't to oily to stick to the sides of the glass as I have seen in other stouts. FOur fingered head that was darker than most other beers. You know you're drinking a good stout when the head is darker than most Brown Ales.  Smell: Bittering hops, bitter coffee, and a slight metallic scent dominate the nose. I am not a huge fan of the coffee smells. However, even though I am not a fan of the style I know others were loving the smell. So overall, I can appreciate what Founders was going after here with this one.  Taste: Wow, this knocks your socks off for sure. Huge coffee flavors stand out with hints of dark chocolate sweetness dancing in the background. Traces of oatmeal earth flavors are somewhat identifiable if you really pay attention. The aftertaste is the nice coffee bitter that settles down to a nice bittersweet on the tongue.  Mouthfeel: Smooth as a calm creek and thick like molasses. A bit slimy between the tongue and cheek along with little carbonation keeps the mouthfeel from being perfect.  Overall: I can't recommend this beer enough. This one lived up to my expectations in every aspect. I know it has a high ABV which keeps it from being a session beer, but I could easily down four bottles in a night without even noticing.

1199,11757,MikeWard,4.57,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into Fullers ESB Goblet. Bottled on 11/10/12, so 9 months old. Have had this beer many times over the past year or so, thought it was about time I reviewed it.  Beer pours black, with a few brown highlights. Head is small, creamy coffee color. The head eventually dissipates to a small ring, which retains all the way down. Lacing is faint.  Aroma is just wonderful, really gets the mouth watering. Strong of coffee, some sweetness of the cocoa, with just a faint whiff of the 8.3 booze. Aroma of roasted malt is not overpowering  Taste is probably as close to perfect as it comes. Whereas with the beer being fresh, the roasted flavor can come off as a little burnt, the age has mellowed the edge off, and it goes down smoothly, with all of the aromas remaining intact.  Mouth is a little on the plus side of medium, rolls around the tongue really nicely, leaving a faint alcohol warmness in the back of the mouth.  Overall, a top class beer, not over hyped at all. Will continue to seek this one out, and let it age up to a year. Can't buy it fresh and cellar it, as I have little to no self control. One of the best beers I have ever had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Taste - Dark chocolate, coffee, maple syrup? A bit of earthy hops and coffee linger.  Mouthfeel - Thick, syrupy, and perfectly carbonated.  Overall - I cannot wait to get more of this.

1199,11757,leroybrown10,4.56,"Pours black with a small tan head. Shows as a deep chocolate when held up to the light.  Nose is rich espresso with mild bitterness. Chocolate, heavy roast malt, and mild vanilla are noticeable as well. Some caramel and toffee, perhaps, as well.  Tastes of rich dark coffee and bitter dark chocolate. Vanilla, some hazelnut and a mild sweetness(from the oats?) come through at the end. All this is held together by a smooth malt backbone.  Thick feel on the tongue with a creamy smoothness as with most beers brewed with oats. Mild carbonation.  Overall, a tremendous beer. Rich coffee that balances well with chocolate and malt. The bitterness from the coffee and chocolate is balanced by the creaminess from the oats.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Dope,4.49,"Dated 9/17/12. Almost a year old.  A: Pours a dark brown. Good sized and dense medium brown head. Head fades lowly, leaving small walls of lacing here and there. Great head retention.  S: Heavy, heavenly coffee beans and chocolate. Grainy oatmeal and a bit of char. Great aroma even after a year. Bet it's divine fresh.  T: Lots of coffee up front with quite a bit of chocolate backing it up. Coffee is a little subdued, again probably due to the age. Chocolate is strong and melds wonderfully, giving this a great mocha flavor. Oatmeal kicks in with a creamy sort of sweet graininess. Finish is all bittersweet chocolate and coffee beans with a hint of oatmeal.  M: Medium body but viscous and creamy. Smooth. Nice.  O: Great breakfast stout. One of the very best in fact. Strong coffee and chocolate flavors, they pretty much stand alone. Oatmeal serves to smooth it all out and give it a nice creamy flavor and mouthfeel. Easy drinking.

1199,11757,Stevedore,4.43,"12oz bottle from November 2012, poured into a Goose Island mini-pint glass today 7/29/2013- making it about 8 months old. I've also had multiples of this vintage over the past 8 months so while this review is based on this bottle, I'll be drawing from other previous experiences too. I don't know why I haven't reviewed this beer sooner.  This beer pours a silky dark cola brown, nearly black body that is more or less opaque. It comes with a large 1.5cm mocha head that dissipates slowly over the course of a few minutes into a thick mocha collar. The lacing here has been sporadic, nothing too special. It's pretty much a typical big stout in appearance. [4.25]  Smelling the nose throughout makes me smile. I still smell a lot of dark cold-pressed coffee aromas along with hints of chocolate, toffee and roast malts. It smells sweet yet bitter. It is a very powerful nose that yells out ""breakfast"". [4.25]  The beer itself is delicious. So creamy, full-bodied, smooth and easy drinking to go along with a delicious flavour profile of black coffee bitterness, dark chocolate bitter sweetness, faint roasted marshmallows and nuts along with a slight mild smokiness that isn't too overwhelming. Its so incredibly easy to drink and the flavour profile is very pleasing and balanced with the bitterness and roasty sweetness. Goes down very well, no booziness at all. The aftertaste is a faint smoky coffee and chocolate combination. [4.5, 4.5]  I'm so glad this is a shelf turd for at least 3-4 months of the year. It is incredibly delicious, smooth and goes down so well. This is one of the best imperial stouts out there, no question about it. Its too bad it doesn't come in six packs, but I'll take it in whatever form it comes in. Highly recommend to anyone who likes stouts.. and those who don't- this might just convert you. [4.5]  Final score: 4.44",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Rope,4.74,"Appearance- Darkness, with brown ridges in the light. The hop oils dance nicely when pouring, but the head was non-existent after a few seconds.  Smell- Coffee notes mixed with a peppery nose. Then comes the smooth sweetness of the chocolate, which strikes a perfect balance to the opening bitter.  Taste- The coffee bean first hits, and then between the total transition to a chocolate sweetness a slight dried berry influence is present.  Mouthfeel- Smooth, as an oatmeal stout tends to be. The carbonation is present, but subdued by the thick coating of the mouth. You can roll the flavor in your mouth, after you swallow, like cigar smoke.  Overall- Chocolate, coffee, and oatmeal make for a daunting amount of extra ingredients in one beer, but they come together for a simply enjoyable taste. The bourbon barrel variant is more rare, but I find the coffee notes in this the winning flavor.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

I’d gotten it based on the bartender’s recommendation. I don’t drink coffee and it tasted like a cup of Starbucks. I tried it again only recently.

1199,11757,LambicPentameter,4.42,"Enjoyed as part of a Founders tap takeover at Bier Station in Kansas City. Poured into a small, bulbous tulip-style glass.  Appearance - Dark, opaque body that's brown on the verge of pitch black. Head is thin and toffee colored with moderate to light lacing.  Smell - Straight up roasted coffee beans, with some semisweet chocolate and even elements of the oatmeal. Second and third whiffs reveal that wonderful fresh-ground espresso smell. Aroma certainly seems to live up to the massive hype of this beer and has me quite excited to soak my taste buds with it.  Taste - The coffee and oats are now front of stage, with caramelized bitterness and cocoa nibs coming through on the finish balanced with the reappearance of the espresso.  Mouthfeel - Decadent and rich with moderate to low carbonation and a viscous, lingering taste long after the liquid has passed to my stomach.  Overall a beer that deserves every bit of the praise I regularly see for it. Not just a part of your recommended daily breakfast, but the whole dang meal in a bottle.

I remember it well, but thought it best to purchase a new 4 pack It pours an oily pitch black. When held up to light, a bit of dark chocolate brown peeks through. The head is tan and very firm, although the lacing slides faster than expected. Big booming smells of ground coffee and chocolate liquor roll out at first pour. Smells of roasted malt, rye, burnt sugar, dark rum and hay follow as it warms. A smell of dried wild flowers is noticed in the distance. The taste at first gulp, reminds me of an iced espresso with sugar. Then the flavors begin to get deeply complex. Dark chocolate, brown barley, rye crackers, rum, plums and mild citrus roll in. There's a bit of an astringent tang in the aftertaste. Interesting! The body is almost oily and very full (perhaps a tad too heavy...but sort of expected).

Dark chocolate, still alot of booze on the nose, which leaves it with a sweet smell. Roasted malts are competing with the booze.  The chocolate is much more present in the taste than the coffee, which is opposite of the nose, but its not sweet chocolate, bitter dark chocolate.  The beer has thinned out with age.

S - The smell is boozy from across the room. Up close, bitter dark chocolate hides a hint of coffee. Just a hint of overripe dark fruit. I'm a little intimidated.  T - First, slight bitterness on the tongue (it is 60 IBUs). Then, extremely dark chocolate everywhere all at once. A little flat on the flavor past the chocolate, though; huge dose of coffee, as well. Classic roasted barley and oats are clearly 2nd fiddle.  M - Oily and thick. Not thick enough to chew, but it really clings to your mouth.  O - This is a big, bold, flavorful stout. It hits on every cylinder, completely uncompromising. If you like its ilk, it's delicious.

Label gives a small description of the beer, web info, a bit of brewery info. Neck label has ABV and IBU info.  Appearance: Allowed to warm for 15min before pouring from its 12oz home into a 16oz snifter. An aggressive pour lead to a 2 finger tightly packed mocha head of medium density atop a thick jet black beer that allows no light through. Head retention was 3min 54sec before fading to a thick coating and ring with excellent lacing.  Smell/Aroma: Smells of deep milk chocolate and fresh roasted coffee along with slight hints of earthy hops as well. Excellent.  Flavor/Taste: Tastes of milk chocolate on the front end along with a fresh roasted coffee malt flavor. The oat comes through next with a light earthy sweetness that tams the strong coffee flavor. The midpoint is dark chocolate bitterness with the dark coffee flavors returning for a bitter finish and aftertaste. A slight hoppiness is detected throughout.  MouthFeel/Drinkability: Full bodied and thick with a smooth velvety mouthfeel. This is extremely drinkable.  Overall/Comments: Wow!!

1199,11757,MistahBeah,4.72,"Appearance: Pitch black with a thin layer of soft mocha-colored head. Very little retention. The head becomes a pencil thin outline around the glass and some swirls in the center. Very little visible carbonation and lacing. Looks like a tall glass of black coffee  Aroma: Rich milk and dark chocolate. Freshly roasted coffee. Some lactose sugar. A subtle earthy hop background. Smells fantastic. More like dessert than breakfast  Taste: Roasted coffee bitterness takes the reigns here. Chocolate shines through occasionally - sometimes sweet, sometimes bittersweet. The oats provide some sweetness but this is more of a bitter brew than the nose would lead me to believe. Not overly bitter just more than I was expecting. Some earthiness, but hard to put my finger on. A little smoky. Faint citrusy hops in the background that are almost completely hidden by the coffee flavor. Really nice. I think it just about lives up to the hype  Mouthfeel: Very smooth with only the littlest bit of alcohol warmth. Rich and silky. Robust and full-bodied.  Overall: This is a fantastic stout.

Raul just finished a Founders Imperial Stout and that bad sucker was rich and robust like a Dr. Phil therapy session. Breakfast stout? Good, but like the Hindenburg, it's too big for its britches and it goes down in a hail of flames!  Raul says, ""ok,"" but pumped? No. Not at all.  *Raulsky has changed his opinion, a bit.

A half-finger's worth of dark khaki head recedes quickly to leave a thin halo of carbonation. A very small amount of lacing.  Smell: The aroma of coffee dominates with hints of bitter dark chocolate, roasted malts, some sweetness from the alcohol, and what I can only describe as a burnt toast note.  Taste: A taste that matches the flavor; coffee, bitter chocolate, roasted malts, and a wonderfully balanced bitterness on the finish. Delicious.  Mouth: Full body with moderate to light carbonation. It leaves a chewy feeling on the teeth.  A tremendous breakfast stout that'll kickstart your day. Yum.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,tvl89,5,"Served from a bottle at around 55 degrees. This is my first founders breakfast stout so my expectations were really really high. Oh god I wasn't disappointed at all! The appearance is just like a typical imperial stout; pitch black with a decent head that dissipates in about 3 minutes. The smell is just awesome, coffee, heavy chocolate, roasted malts and more chocolate. The taste is just like the smell very delicious, very creamy. The first flavor you palate detects is the rich coffee, followed by tons and tones of dark chocolate, ending in a pleasant bitterness. This could be perhaps the best Russian stout out there. I highly recommend!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,patre_tim,3.88,"A: Dark brown, almost black opaque with a half head of deep brown mocha colour with a slight rusty tinge. When held to the light you can see a deep brown rusty amber tinge a half cm into the body.  S: Dark chocolate, coffee, toffee, mostly a sweet dark coffee scent, coffee liqueur.  T: Coffee, dark chocolate, snow or freezer burn, then a sour almost watery quality that then turns into a rusty metallic taste, and a finnish of black coffee. Very complex. As I drink it, the metallic disappears, and becomes more of a black licorice taste. There is a sweetness to it, but its not overwhelming, and remains more in the background.  M: Medium heavy body, somewhat lighter than some American Doubles, medium low carbonation. Syrupy.  O: I like it, but was certainly disappointed based on the high ratings this one has. Certainly does not add up to 100 for me. I much prefer the taste of Peche Mortal to this.

Just a wonderful bouquet of cold press, dark roasted coffee with semi sweet chocolate in the background. Just awesome  T-A little lackluster compared to the wonderful smell, but still does a good job of conveying the dark roasted coffee and semi sweet chocolate,  M- This is where I could use a little less carbonation or perhaps it is just simply too thin, but relative to other Imperial Stouts, the mouthfeel is lacking, is more American Stout than Imperial.  O- I have a bias because this is one of the beers that got me enamored with craft/micro/nano/artisanal whatever we call it now; beer.

One of my favorites and I'm surprised I haven't rated it yet.  A: Dark and pretty as ever. With an aggressive pour, a small khaki head forms, but it fades quickly and leaves a very thin halo along the edge of the glass and some very nice lacing.  S: Coffee up front with a good amount of dark, bitter chocolate. Amazing that the coffee has held up as strongly as this, as I remember the chocolate starting to take over last time I had it. Maybe I was wrong...it has happened before.  T: God I love this beer. I'm definitely picking up on more chocolate on the palate than I did in the nose, but the coffee is certainly still there. I have never noticed this before, but there's a bit of a brownie with nuts going on as well. The dark chocolate lasts forever at the back of my tongue.  M: The viscosity of this beer is spot on, but the carbonation is just a bit too high the more I think of it. It doesn't detract from my enjoying the beer that much, but if I'm looking for a flaw, I've found it. Overall, still solid, however.  O: I have one more from this batch that I think I might sit on a bit longer to see what it develops into. I imagine that the coffee will continue to fade, but that all other aspects of the beer will remain strong. I never hesitate to grab a 4-pack of this, and am excited to hear it'll be coming out in 6ers in the near future.

As I drew closer to the glass, getting nearer to the tulip. the most amazing and perfect smell of coffee with hints of dark chocolate arise. Perfectly roasted beans tantalize the nose!  Taste - this is where it all comes together - nice dark and roasted malts hit you first, sliding over the palate where it dances on your tongue where bitter and dark chocolate flavors meet and combine into this fantastic brew.  Mouthfeel - a bit more on the medium to heavy side, the carbonation is perfect for the style.  Overall - this is my favorite stout, I have yet to have a better stout than this one.

Alcohol leaves an impression and removes these flavors quickly  M: Low carbonation. Medium bodied. Alcohol gives dry finish  O: I enjoyed this beer a lot. I think the hype around it, from BA and friends, was too high. I would like to give it another go with a fresher bottling date and see if that helps the Apperance and mouth feel.

Everything just balances out so well with it, though non-coffee drinkers might be understandably put off a bit.

That sounds like it has a lot going on, and I was right. The color is deep brown. It has a great aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. The taste is right on.

1199,11757,MisSigsFan,4.38,"Pours a jet black color with a 1.5 finger thick tan head. Head leaves plenty of lacing and doesn't dissipate until about half way through. It seems like every time I go for a sip and put the glass back down a bit of the head comes back. Nose has a lot of chocolate and coffee in it, as well as a hint of grain. Taste is similar, but with more coffee than chocolate. Hints of oatmeal and grain and smoked malt. Just a bit of alcohol in the finish. Good amount of bitterness to it. Mouthfeel is actually quite thin for a stout, but I like it. About average carbonation. Overall, this is a great stout. I think it's a bit ridiculous to rate this at 100. BA seems to have a big Founders bias. It's very very good, but to say it's perfect is crazy. I'd love to get my hands on KBS. I hear it's a completely different beast.  Re-review 10/19/2014  Pours jet black with a frothy 2 finger head. Just a bit of lacing around the glass. Nose is very roasty. A lot of coffee and chocolate. Taste follows the nose for the most part, but I get some dark fruits in there too. Alcohol covered up very nicely and a good bitterness from, what I'm assuming, is a combination of hops and coffee. I also noticed a weird metallic taste as well. The oatmeal really gives this beer a nice smooth mouthfeel. Carbonation is pretty low but fits the style well. Overall, I still think this is a great stout, but is it a 100? Probably not. Also, I'm not sure how much the coffee and chocolate actually add to the taste. I've had plenty of imperial stouts that didn't have coffee or chocolate added but had just as much flavor.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,CMUbrew,4.55,"Bottle dated 09/04/12 poured into a Founders snifter  A: Pours midnight black, with a finger's worth of dark brown head from an aggressive pour. Head is quick to fade to traces of bubbles and foam. No light is getting through the oil black body.  S: Even after eight months, coffee is still the biggest player in the nose. Roasted coffee is noticed first and is followed by rich dark malts and a bready malt toastiness. Bitter chocolate is there too.  T: In a word: delicious. Breakfast blend coffee is evident, although it has toned down with age. Bitter, dark, and sweet chocolate flavors combine with heavy malt flavors and toasted bread. A bitterness I believe I can still attribute to hops is just barely perceiveable. Lingering roast and dark chocolate flavors in the aftertaste. If it was not for the slight warming feeling, I would not know there was alcohol in here. It is indeed the beer I would want to have with breakfast, given a choice.  M: Fairly viscous, slightly oily-slick, and creamy smooth. Exactly how you want a stout of this ABV to feel.  O: Just fantastic. Comparing this older bottle to my experience with it fresh, I can assuredly say the coffee has toned down some, thus allowing the chocolate to play a bigger role. I would guess between six and twelve months is when this beer is in great balance. My preference would have to go to an aged breakfast stout.

The taste all coffee up front and rather bitter to slightly astringent due to some of the black malts. Unsweetened dark chocolate is next along with a great mix of some spicy hops, a touch of yeast and warming alcohol. If I had to criticize, I think I'd say that I wish this had a bit more sweetness to balance the bittering character of the dark malts and moderate IBUs. This is a thickly chewy heavy beer. Low carbonation with added body as a result of the oatmeal make this really pleasant in the mouth. I can't believe I've taken this long to give this beer a try.

S- Fresh ground coffee, dark fruits, dark chocolate, roasted malt, burnt toast. Smells amazing.

Absolutely delicious.  M- Thick, creamy, low carbonation, silky.  I'm glad I re-reviewed this beer and gave it the justice it deserves. Every flavor is perfectly balanced, the chocolate compliments the coffee and the heavily roasted malt. For such a thick beer, it's super smooth, creamy, and drinkable.

1199,11757,aefbjo,4.73,"Pours with a gigantic head into a Ball jar. Opaque brown. Huge, stiff, resilient head.  So much coffee in the aroma. Just really good coffee and a bit of dark chocolate. Not getting any hops or barley off the aroma.  Taste is largely gigantic coffee and dark chocolate off the bat. Slight hints of oatmeal on the back end. As it warms up it might change a bit, but this is a huge coffee/chocolate bomb. With a bit of time the piney hops come out. There are actually a fair amount of damn hops in this beer. They give the chocolate a perfect bitter unsweeteneed chocolate balance.  Medium to heavy body. Very nicely balanced here.  Overall one of my favorite beers from the Midwest. Don't front.

1199,11757,Immortale25,4.45,"Thanks to Slvrmon82 for allowing me to finally try this. Bottleneck says Bottled On 09/07/12  A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/2 inch brown head that retains a bit before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and random patches of surface foam. Sticky lacing trickles down the glass slowly.  S- Deeply roasted chocolate malt aroma with some molasses and coffee in the back. Slight alcohol fume brings to mind an Irish coffee cocktail with hints of mocha, cocoa and caramel.  T- The coffee becomes a bit more apparent in the flavor bringing a great roast quality to counter the sweetness of the chocolate. Some alcohol twang blends in nicely keeping things intense but still very drinkable. In fact, this might be the most drinkable impy stout I've ever had. Charry aftertaste and a hint of black licorice.  M- Robust and magnificently creamy with a silky smoothness that's nearly unrivaled. Thick, chewy body and medium-low carbonation.

1199,11757,BeerTheater,4.75,"A serious stout. nobody should pass up a breakfast stout. An eye opener and belly expander of a beer. This has all the flavor you would expect and then doubles it until you feel completely satisfied. Chocolate, coffee, oatmeal and stout all perfectly balanced yet strong, and worth sharing if the need arises because you should buy as much as you can, just so you can dish out the goods and get all the credit; or just drink it to the head daily because you're worth it. Nice texture goes down like melted butter and chocolate roasted over an open fire. If you've gotten through all that truth and fluff I just wrote you should know this is a great beer that shouldn't get better by making it stronger in abv. or aged in barrels; because some things are better left alone. I've had some stout with more coffee or more chocolate or roast but this one succeeds in making them all come together well without one characteristic taking over completely, except perhaps the coffee. Then again the chocolate malt flavor comes out so well throughout the entire beer too with the coffee and some hops keeping it from being overly sweet. it's drink ability-- just about flawless. As I've already said in so many words: smooth, flavorful and good carbonation. You'd want to drink this all day but to do so I recommend spending it at a barbeque or some big, big breakfast.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

My first ever Founders Breakfast Stout, and excited to try it considering how well received this beer seems to be.  Poured into a Firestone Walker pint glass.  A - Pours the most greasy blackest motor oil looking beer I have ever seen. Thick and opaque, with the tiniest mocha colored foam struggling itself into existence and then fading away.  S - Deep dark chocolate, and dark roasted coffee beans. Not as impressive as I was hoping. Dark candied fruits, burnt brown sugar, and oats emerge as the beer begins to warm.  T - Bitter roasted coffee bean goodness, silky dark chocolate, vague buried hops. Smooth, creamy, and chocolatey. Perfectly balanced, highly drinkable, masks it's 8.30% abv deceptively well, this is a beer I could easily drink excessively.  M - Creamy, smooth, sweet, little bit of coffee bean bitterness. An all around pleasant beer.  Overall, a great beer from Founders, probably the best I have had from them yet, although I have had other stouts that blew me away more or just as much as this beer. I just very recently tried Bear Republic Big Bear Black Stout, and I have to say I was more impressed with that one than I was with Founders Breakfast Stout. Definitely a beer I would have again, maybe a bit fresher next time. A must try beer, either way.

1199,11757,Rick_K,5,"For years I was entrenched in European beers like Guinness and Newcastle, until some friends of mine stared introducing me to smaller Midwestern breweries that I started to realise that there was more to beer than what was being imported.  This is one such beer. It's chocolate smell and flavor, mixed with the Sumatra and Kona beans and it's rich and smooth texture makes it a delight to drink. I was amazed at the first sip and couldn't put down my glass until it was empty. This is one beer that most definitely deserves it's ""Imperial"" stout designation.  If this beer was available to me in the late 80's/early 90's, I would have picked it over the other 2 I was accustomed to drinking. I am adding this to my permanent list of ""must drink"" beer and would recommend anyone who enjoys an imperial stout to try this one as soon as they can.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Taste- Milk chocolate and peanuts, tiny bit of alcohol. After taste is a bitter coffee taste with lingering mocha sweetness.  Mouthfeel- Light carbonation. Fills your mouth up with a warm alcohol taste that is gone as fast as it arrived, replaced with smooth and creamy chocolate.  Overall- I was ready to be disappointed given all the hype around this beer. After tasting it I am happy to say that the hype was totally validated.

1199,11757,Jake_Ramrod,4.75,"I won't go into too much depth on this beer because its all been said before. IMO, this is the quintessential easily available Stout on the market today. It pours quickly with very little head, but what is there has a nice coffee color. Huge coffe and chocolate influence in all aspects of this rich, yet easy to drink beer. I love taking a big whiff of it as I toss it back. Dark as night and slick going down. No hint of the high ABV. Not as earthy as it could be, but still so hearty. I can drink one after another and keep going back for more. This one of those highly ranked beers that really delivers everytime. I've spent the last couple of months drinking highly rated stout after stout. And, everytime I always think about how good the Breakfast Stout is in comparison. I wonder how these taste with a little age on it. Can't wait to find out.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

This is actually an extremely drinkable rep of this style. Dark roasted kona is definitely up front in the aroma and taste, I don't really get much chocolate at first, but as this beer warms a litte! Whoa! Huge mocha flavor just turns on and it gets a lot more complex. I do love love the fact that there is not a bitter after taste that most other coffee infused stouts seem to come with. Much thanks to mpayne5 and Nuckbuck for the hook-up! This little gem is making me rethink my whole attitude on coffee stouts for sure.

Excellent bitter, dark chocolate finish. Very smooth and desirable for being 8.30% ABV. Lacks any alcoholic taste.  Overall: One of the best beers I have had. I would drink it with any type of meal, or even as a dessert. Very easy to drink and doesn't leave any undesirable aftertaste.

Smell: Highly caffeinated caramel Frappucino. Very similar to Goose Island Resolutions.  Taste/Mouthfeel: I have to say...the mouthfeel is out of this world. It has that strong coffee sensastion that perks you up. There's also plenty of malty backbone to soak this up, almost as if it's a bowl of oatmeal. The chocolate balances everything. What surprises me about Founders Breakfast is the lack of an aftertaste, given the fact that it's an 8.3% stout.

Inviting mocha and semi-sweet chocolates. I don't get any alcohol on the nose. The chocolate's heavier than I expected, but is definitely welcome. Very faint roast character. Pungent.  T - Dark roasted coffee dominates the show. Light cocoa is present, but unobtrusive. Chocolates and less prominent then on the nose. Roasted malts are present near the end. It's significantly more bitter than I'd have guessed, but far from imbalanced. Evocative of black coffee. No alcohol is detectable. God, that's tasty.  M - Incredibly smooth. Full bodied but far from thick. Could be a little creamier, but it works well with the coffee.  D - Definitely lives up to the hype. I could down this all day.

Nice bitter bite with hops and coffee at the finish...mmm  O: really like this beer. One of the best dark beers I have had.

1199,11757,rickyleepotts,4.56,"I am SO excited to be drinking this beer. You don't understand… we could get this beer with ease when we lived in Indiana. Now that we are in Arizona, we can't get ANYTHING from Founders. They don't distribute here. Not. Fair. But never fear… thanks to a recent obsession with RateBeer, I have started some pretty serious beer trading. I traded for this beer, actually with a guy in Fishers, Indiana and he sent us two cans of 3BEANS, 2 bottles of this, and 2 bottles of Alpha King. That is also on our list. Oh, and he sent us two bottles of the Founders Imperial Stout.  I have to blame Dakine for my obsession with RateBeer. He said it was good… and he was right. I have since traded with a guy in Chicago, a guy in Virginia, and a guy in the Russian River Valley. He is actually sending us all of the beers on the list from the Valley. I am even working on a trade with my buddy Jake back home. I'm hooked!  It's time to start drinking… I can remember what this beer tastes like, but I haven't had it in a couple of years now. I can't wait to smell this, let alone drink it. Let's drink!  In the Glass: It is darker than I remember. It poured somewhat thick, and I could smell it before I was finished pouring. We are both really excited about this beer. I blame Founders for NOT shipping to the west coast. The beer also produced a nice dark tan head, while thin, still leaves me excited to drink. If you have never had the Founders Breakfast Stout… do yourself a favor. Get a bottle. It's worth every penny and always good to the last drop.  Nose: It smells like an imperial stout. It has a little copper note to it, but that is because of how cold it is. I just grabbed this from the fridge, so I am going to let it sit for a little bit before I drink it. I will probably drink half now, and half later. I like letting beers like this get to room temperature for the full enjoyment of the flavor. They call it Breakfast Stout, but they could easily call this Dessert Stout. This truly is a meal in a glass!  Flavor: This is the moment we have all been waiting for… at least the moment I have been waiting for. It is as good as I remember! It seems a little hotter than I remember, but that is probably because of how cold it is. It has an incredible mouthfeel and aftertaste, but we will get there. If you have ever had an imperial stout before, those are the same flavors that rush the palate. Then, as you swallow, a little dryness kicks in, and you get the soft subtle Irish stout flavor that we have all come to expect from a Guinness. Not the best beer in the world, but one that deserves our attention.  Mouthfeel: I have been on a stout kick lately. It's getting warmer, so I should be moving away from those… but I like the mouthfeel and the aftertaste of a good thick stout. This stout is just that… thick. It is easy to drink, but the beer coats the tongue with a nice layer of awesome! Every time I swallow I am getting those same flavors, and while I want to drink more, I want to savor this as long as I can! Very few bubbles here.  Aftertaste: I swallows my first drink 5 minutes ago, and the aftertaste is still there. It becomes increasingly dryer as you continue to swallow, but the aftertaste might be the best part of this beer. I don't usually care for Guinness, at least chilled Guinness, but the aftertaste is similar. Not as boring as Guinness, but the same drying sensation that I am experiencing with this.  Founders is a great brewing company, and I miss them. In the trade that I am working with Jake, he is going to send me some Founders beers. One that he is sending I have never heard of… so I am excited for that. I didn't request any more Breakfast Stout, as we already have one more bottle in the fridge. There is only so much time to drink beer! This bottle came a long way, but tastes as good as I remember. Maybe we will make pancakes and bacon the next time we drink this… a TRUE breakfast beer!

Also detected a hint of oatmeal and some chocolate as well.  T- Coffee, coffee, and more coffee up front. Definitely some oatmeal and hints of chocolate leading into a subtle bitterness at the end. I tasted a slight alcohol bite on the end as well but nothing crazy. Has a nice sweetness to it. Thick but not as thick as I expected from seeing the pitch black color.  M- Thick, viscous, but smooth as butter. Goes down easy and the flavors leave you longing for the next sip. Coffee flavor lingers for a while for sure.  O- Not a huge coffee drinker but I enjoy it from time to time. I was very impressed by the way founders pulled this one off. The 8% ABV is hidden quite well. Gotta hand it to them because I almost feel more awake after drinking it. Definitely not something I could drink more than 1 of in a sitting but a nice treat on a cold weekend.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T- Taste follows nose to a perfect t. Notes of chocolate and oatmeal, then a powerful wave of roasted coffee, followed by a warm finish that has a touch of alcohol bite to it, but nothing that takes away from the flavor of the beer. Maybe even a caramel residual flavor.  M- Full bodied. Thick, but oh so smooth. Perfect carbonation. Not very dry at all. Did I mention smooth?  O- Honestly, I am not a coffee drinker. I don’t even like coffee. But damn it, I respect the hell out of this beer and Founder's effort put into this breakfast stout. I love it when a beer is brewed with a bold, powerful aroma and then matches the taste perfectly with the smell. Well done.

Chocolate hits you right away, the coffee is there, but its sweet.. not bitter, very sweet but its not a bad thing. The alcohol is very very well hidden.  M: Perfect in my opinion. its very smooth, its silky but not too thick. For such a flavorful brew, its Very drinkable.  O: amazing stout its great in my opinion, it is bold, yet sweet, strong yet subtle. It has flavor! Its crafted with quality ingredients. I understand sweetness in a beer isnt everyones cup of tea, but this is a grade A quality beer. A 12oz bottle ran me $2.75 and i had it on tap at barleys taproom in greenville for $5. Its affordable.

1199,11757,teromous,3.52,"A: Dark black body, with barely any head at all. The non-head is light tan colored. No lacing.  S: I get subtle notes of coffee, and a slight oak character to the scent.  T: Coffee flavors dominate. No alcohol flavors. There's a huge roasted bitterness in the back of my mouth. Some oak-like flavor as well. A bit of cherry character but not fruity.  M: There is a slight warming sensation from the alcohol. The beer is very full bodied. It is a beer that I had to take a little time to drink. There's enough body, flavor, and bitterness going on that makes it a slow drink.  O: Overall I liked the bitterness and roast characters of the beer. The label states that it is a ""Double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout."" I really didn't get much slickness from the oatmeal, or any flavor from it either. I got a lot of coffee flavors, but the chocolate didn't come through for me. I would have liked to at least see these flavors in the beer.

Probably the darkest beer I have seen.  S: Strong coffee smell, with some complex malt aromas. Some subtle chocolate and oatmeal.  T: The coffee taste is most prominent by far, but there is also a nice malty flavor underneath that lets you know that while this is probably mostly a coffee stout, it is more than that.  M: Thinner mouthfeel than I thought. Looks thicker on pouring than it feels when you drink it. Low-medium carbonation. This is probably the only aspect that didn't blow me out of the water, but still just fine.  O: Really outstanding beer. This is one I like to drink and savor, and once its gone, would love nothing more than to drink another (though I never do).

1199,11757,jondeelee,4.58,"Breakfast Stout opens to a heavily ashy aroma, full of black malt, ash, tobacco, fresh-ground oily coffee, cocoa, and roasted pecans. These are countered by a runnel of heavy cream and toffee, mixed with blackstrap molasses. Dark fruit esters, including prune, date, and black cherry, add nuance to the sugars. An earthy base of blackened toast crust, yeasty wheat dough, and heavy brown breads keeps everything grounded. Only a slight touch of pine resin and grapefruit rind from the hops. As a whole, this is a fantastic aroma, offering almost everything that could be desired in a stout, lacking perhaps only a barrel-aged bourbon overtone. Not that it really needs the latter, however; there’s already more aroma in the bottle than seems possible, and it practically oozes from the open mouth.  On the tongue, the beer starts out with a double shot of fresh ground oily espresso and baker’s cocoa, quickly followed by tobacco ash, black malt, blackened toast crust, and deeply roasted pecans. The dark fruit esters from the nose are still present, but less noticeable against the black onslaught, but there are touches of molasses, toffee, heavy cream, and vanilla bean to add a bit of texture and sweetness. Thick black breads and rising wheat dough add further texture, joined by a few lighter grains as well, including Grape Nuts cereal and fresh wheat, the latter providing a nice fresh counterpoint to the blackness. Only faint touches of pine resin and grapefruit rind from the hops; they’re mostly here to add bitterness, not flavor. The flavors are strong enough that they continue largely unabated in subsequent mouthfuls, though the ash and black coffee ground notes are slightly larger, and the sugars slightly smaller. The ashy notes grow as the beer is held on the tongue, and largely dominate the aftertaste, though some of the lighter grain notes and small bits of sugar do stay around to help counter things, and at least the ash lingers on the tongue for a very long time. Mouthfeel is an oily medium, and carbonation is medium.  Overall, this is a fantastic stout, and offers almost everything one could expect and hope for. Only a bit of barrel aging, or perhaps a larger cream and toffee presence, could improve the flavor, and a slightly more viscous mouthfeel would be nice. These are, however, picky notes, and should be largely disregarded; the beer is excellent as-is. Well worth trying.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smells wonderful, chocalate and coffee notes are immediate  Great chocalate and coffee blend where the two flavors battle it out to a draw Hard to believe this is an 8% beer as the alcohol melds with the other flavors to be nearly undetectable. Sweet chocalate after taste lingers on the pallet  Great mouth feel, not too thick, just right amount of sturdiness  I've had other coffee flavored beers and was always underwhelmed, this one gets everything right, its just flat out delicious.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Jadjunk,4.31,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to my Founder's Snifter. Served above 51º Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a dark brown creamy head over an inky, viscous near black body. The head is short lived, however and surface cover is thin and specked. Carbonation is mild and relaxed. A decent looking beer in terms of body depth, but the head quality was surprisingly shallow. 3.5  (Smell) The aroma is certainly complex. Semi-bitter coffee and dark chocolate malt up front with a fainter black patent malt pairing as well. Coffee beans trail into the midst of the aroma as well as roasted malt blends. Oatmeal is milder, focusing instead on the former chocolate and bitter coffee aromas, although it compliments some body to the remaining flavors. Hop bitterness is certainly notable, although hop character is faint- earthy and resinous are two hop notes I pick out directly from the aroma. The yeast profile adds some notable characters too with some dark fruit notes, the beer has a mild tartness as well, possibly from the coffee. Despite its complexity, the beer has a general balance for the style, and both bitter and sweet characters come through equally. Potency is medium+. 4.25  (Taste) Up front is coffee, followed by chocolate and roasted caramel husk malt presence finishing with an oatmeal thickness on a earthy black coffee bean bitterness. The flavors are enjoyably complex, and the balance maintains a near 50/50 representation of bitter and sweet notes, although the bitterness is a bit more notable in colder temperatures, consider holding out on opening a bottle until the mid-late 50ºs for best balance and flavor. The flavor as it stands is very enjoyable. I don't know if its the very best of its style, but it's certainly excellent and worth trying. 4.5  (Mouthfeel) Mild, sticky flavor with a faint oatmeal chewiness. Carbonation is mild, exempting an airy note on the finish. Mild creaminess from the oatmeal, although a touch less than anticipated- oatmeal doesn't contribute much to the beer overall. Coffee bean bitter, very mild dry finish. Body is medium+ for the style and heavy overall. Alcohol presence is low. 4.25  (Overall) There's no doubt that Breakfast Stout is worth a try. It's a very complex and enjoyable beer for the stout crowd. There are some minor tweaks that would balance the flavor even more, although the flavor as it stands is largely successful. A touch more sweetness over balance would be the ideal fix, although I'm likely to age a bottle or two to see if some age holds up the quality of this beer. I'll certainly be making return visits to this beer every year. 4.25  Founders Brewing Company's Founders Breakfast Stout 4.33/5.00",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

On the palate, the flavors are rich and creamy with roasted malt, coffee, caramel making the headlines, with cream rounding everything out into a highly drinkable, rich and thick stout. The mouthfeel if smooth, soft and creamy with the alcohol, malts and hops not fighting for dominance. Everything knows its place and acts accordingly. Overall, this beer was worth the wait.

T - Day-old strong coffee, but not quite as bitter as coffee. A bit one-noted on the taste to be honest. I searched and searched for other flavors. Absolutely no chocolate flavor like the bottle says, a mild breadiness that might be reminiscent of a bland oatmeal and coffee breakfast. You wouldn't know there's any alcohol in here.

It isn't jet black, but damn close! Very minimal light coming through when I held it up. Dark brown/black body with a fluffy mocha head. Somewhat unusual to be so heady seeing as though it a double stout.

It's full flavored, sticky, robust and I can't taste the 8% abv this beer clocks in at.  M: After several sips the mouthfeel on this beer is quite nice. You definitely know you're drinking a big stout, but it really leans more to the side of medium bodied. It goes down scary smooth with just a touch of hop bitterness at the finish.

Despite the high ABV, you cant really get any alcohol in the flavor, so thats always a good thing.  O: Like everyone says, its a world-class stout.

The scent is smokey and chocolatey but it does have an oatey, coffee scent. Slightly sweet it has a burnt graininess.  The taste is very smokey, burnt grains with a hint of powdered chocolate. There is an earthy tone to it but is an excellent example of any type of stout.

Color is a deep dark brownish/black  Aroma - coffee and chocolate dominate, some dark fruits  Taste - deep roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate, mocha coffee, slightly bitter finish  Mouthfeel - medium body, low carbonation, smooth  Overall - best tasting (non-BA) coffee beer IMO.

M: Full bodied, but not chewy, very smooth, carbonation is a touch too high on the front end but settles out nicely, wet finish  O: A favorite readily-available coffee stout that I have drank too often to remember.

Wow...coffee roasts, through and through...aroma of the Kona and Sumatra coffee influences prevail.  T - Some burnt coffee notes, complimented by a sweetening hop backing; earthy grains...then, more of the ash and espresso...strong coffee presence!  M - Medium heavy body, more effervescent than is suggested by the low-lying head on the pour. The texture is NOT thick...not chewy or sticky.  O - Extremely drinkable at 8.3% abv. If you're into coffee flavored stouts, this one's for you. I favor the flavor. I'm not really a ""sweetish, mapley malt"" kind of stouter.

Laser beams, solar flares and atomic flashes couldn't penetrate this level of darkness. The cappuccino colored head was surprisingly meager but still hung on for the duration. Espresso comes on strong in the aroma, along with my Grandfathers pipe tobacco, dark chocolate, wet leather, booze and roasted barley. The taste is dominated with coffee, and chocolate, but what also stands out are the malty toffee notes, and oatmeal smothered in dark brown sugar. The mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth. Overall, a fantastic beer, absolutely world class. One should believe the hype about this brew.--it is that good.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The thickness makes it taste like a meal, the flavor makes it enjoyable. You get intense dark chocolate and amazing smooth coffee. Most coffee stouts have a bitter flavor from the beans but this is the gold standard. You get a great smoothness from the oatmeal to balance it out perfectly.

1199,11757,THANAT0PSIS,4.75,"Founders Breakfast Stout  Appearance: Founders’ famous stout pours black as night with a nice finger of creamy tan head reminiscent of espresso crema. A dark amber is just visible on the edges of the pour. The head has nice retention and the lacing is impressive, as is the carbonation. This is a masterpiece.  Aroma: Heavy hits of coffee are followed immediately by sweet oatmeal and dark toffee. Roasted malts dominate, with no hop presence whatsoever. Disappointingly, there is not much chocolate here, but a pleasant tobacco smell adds to the complexity. The aroma is great, but a bit coffee-centric.  Taste: Coffee, as it did in the aroma, takes over the taste, and brilliantly so. The coffee itself has great complexity between toffee, chocolate, and of course, coffee. The malts compliment these flavors, but add more dark chocolate, dark fruits (particularly figs), and further levels of roastiness. Tobacco and leather also make an appearance at the end of each drink. Of course, oatmeal is noted throughout, imparting a superb creaminess and sweetness. The taste is a brilliant improvement on the aroma, and is a wonderfully complex and unique gem.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is slightly slick, but is balanced by the creamy oatmeal and perfectly adequate carbonation. Somehow, the mouthfeel remains a bit thin for an imperial stout. Still, that is essentially a nitpick. The mouthfeel is a testament of a well-crafted beer, and this one hardly disappoints.  Overall: This beer completely lives up to the hype. Next year it will be essential to pick up a case (or two) of this for winter. The balance is incredible, the drinkability is fantastic, and it always pushes you to drink another. This is also a go-to coffee beer; I could wake up and start my day with one of these, no problem. As such, it could be a great conversion beer for fans of coffee. This is one of the premier stouts of the craft beer world. 18.5/20",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Tobacco aftertaste in my mouth. Very complex.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, standard carbonation  Overall: This thing is so complex. I honestly like it served room temperature opposed to chilled.

Complex and close to perfection. taste: All that the nose offers and dialed in perfectly. Balanced, complex, it has it all. overall: This is a go to beer, one that I could enjoy everyday. Drinking for 3 years, probably have 4 or 5 cases drained over that time. Tried it aged and still awesome - even with the coffee waned still a superior brew. Pick your superlative.

1199,11757,Raven3464,4.48,"Appearance: The beer pours a pitch black body with a tan one-finger head. Sticky lacing is apparent and very attractive.  Smell: Freshly brewed coffee is noticed early and followed by a sweet milk chocolate aroma. It is not quite as complex as I remembered but the coffee bean aroma permeates the room.  Taste: This is a well balanced Imperial Stout. The initial sip is pure coffee. This fades nicely into a sweet chocolate taste complemented with oatmeal notes. There is an acidic touch with some hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Alcohol is nowhere to be found. In fact, I cannot remember the last time I had a beer with an ABV over 8% in which the alcohol was so well hidden.  Mouth feel: Rich, creamy, and smooth are all good adjectives to describe this brew. It is not the heaviest stout out there but it is definitely full bodied.  Overall: The strong coffee taste and subtle oatmeal notes make it easy to understand why this is called a ""breakfast"" stout. It is not my favorite brew within the style but it is certainly up there.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,CraftBeerTastic,4.57,"Ba Review #249 Served On: 1/9/2013 Glassware: Duvel Glass Labeled ABV: 8.3% Date/ Code: 9/17/12  Ran into a whole case of this yesterday at North York Beverage in York, PA ($72.99). There were only a few cases left. I still can't believe they had any at all.  Look: An aggressive pour formed a 1-finger of dirty tan head comprised of random sized bubbles. It was a very black and viscous brew. Some sticky head lacing formed but the head dissipated quickly. Alcohol legs were definitely present.  Smell: Strong roasted coffee and rich dark unsweetened chocolate. Some lactose or vanilla sweetness seemed to be lingering around. A hoppy herbal quality also came through in the nose suggesting the 60 IBU’s.  Taste: First up was a coffee bitterness that was quickly overtaken by a sweet chocolate creaminess. The middle had the coffee, chocolate and oatmeal components blending together with unbelievable balance. Things seemed to fade quickly towards the end with a slightly bitter finish and sweet notes returning for the aftertaste. The 8.3% ABV was completely hidden with no dryness whatsoever. The mouth-feel was creamy, but a little thinner than the color and body suggested. Very drinkable with extreme balance.  This was a very enjoyable Stout that offered some unique qualities. I guess I’ll be forced to join all the hype on this one.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,KFBR392,4.96,"Appearance: Dark with a slight lacing on after the pour. Poured into a snifter. Thin lacing stuck on the sides and slowly snuck down the glass.  Smell: Yep, this is perfect. Strong coffee aroma but the chocolate, oatmeal, toffee, and caramel accents are there. Bursts out of the bottle, but is not overpowering. Everything that the smell brings is exactly replicated in the taste. Like I said before, perfection.  Taste: Once again, perfection. The coffee flavors burst through which magnificently yields to the malty oatmeal and chocolate flavors. There is no break between transition of flavors in this beer. This beer is so complex and layered it isn't funny. 8.3 abv?? If I tasted this beer without knowing the abv I would say around 4%. Simply wonderful. It is almost ridiculous that a beer this masterful has been so widely available this year. Thank you Founders, this is a true and unbridled masterpiece.  Mouthfeel: What more do you want from me? This beer is perfect! Smooth caramel coating sticks on the palette. Chewy texture that refuses to leave long after drinking this beer. The flavor simply refuses to leave your tongue.  Overall: This beer can only be appreciated by those who truly appreciate beer. If you do not like this beer, go buy a 30 rack of yellow garbage fizzy beer and have a solid night. In my opinion, this is the best beer so widely available. Are there better beers then this? Yeah probably, but not many. And for any beers better then this you are going to pay $20+ for a bomber. I have not seen a beer more widely available then Founders Breakfast Stout that can hold a candle to this beer. Just go buy this beer now, and continue to buy it while its there.

You can tell as it pours out that it is going to be a very chewy and viscous beer.  S- The smell was chocolaty and delicious but not very powerful. Coffee notes also come through.  T- The taste is absolutely delicious. Strong coffee and chocolate flavors are prominent. The sweetness is well balanced with hops. I don't like beers that are overly sweet, but this was not a problem with the breakfast stout. Alcohol is also well covered with combination of sweet flavors and hops.  M- This is a full bodied beer that has a heavy, creamy mouthfeel. Probably one of the more viscous stouts that I have ever had.

Metallic scent as well.  T - Milk chocolate on the tip of my tongue, some black coffee along with its bitterness. Dark chocolate as well. Possible oakiness. Aftertaste closely resembles drinking coffee, slight bitterness and acidity.  M - Medium body and carbonation.  O - A very good stout.

1199,11757,Ivegotmule,4.96,"This is a 2012 at right at about a year of age. I bought 3 cases last year and I'm drinking my last one tonight as I get 3 more cases tomorrow. It is poured freely into a huge balloon wine glass, no head, slight brown edges with pitch black 95%. The coffee and hops have faded slightly over the year, but honestly not that much as it has been in the garage beer fridge since it was about 3 weeks old. The chocolate layers are just exquisite with the age. Mouthfeel is on the thin side for the style, but the dryness from the bitter chocolate and hops and perfect carbonation make it an easy drinker. Cliche or not, I could totally drink this for breakfast. This is my second favorite coffee forward non barreled imperial stout. Just short of a Alesmith Speedway Stout. And that's not even a good comparison considering the huge abv difference. I absolutely recommend buying as much of this as you can find/afford. But I must say, it is best around 3 months of age, just as Founders recommends ""drink all of our beer fresh"". The hops and coffee fade and they are the highlights of the beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Chas58,4.72,"Poured from a growler filled at Joe Canal's Iselin into my Firestone Walker Nonic Pint Glass  Appearance - This pours a thick inky black. The head appears and grows quickly and forms an inch high brownish fluffy head. The lacing remains long after the beer and head have subsided and clings to the glass. Smell - the first aroma is that of freshly ground coffee, rich and flavorful with beautiful floral scents that you get from fresh coffee beans. The aroma makes you want to stick your head deep into the glass and just inhale. This is such a rich and beautiful aroma, especially for a coffee lover.  Taste - the first taste is heavenly, it is rich, coffee laced and with a hop back that adds a nice kick to the smoothness of this beer. The taste is incredibly complex and with each sip additional rich tastes appear including cocoa, hints of vanilla and other ""umami"" like flavors. Each sip makes you think of some other rich, slightly bitter flavor you have experienced.  Mouthfeel - the very light initial carbonation combined with the thick and soft mouthfeel, make this delightful. It is silky smooth, and then additional carbonation seems to appear and make this even better. Like with the way the head build in the glass, the carbonation builds from initially almost non-existent to a very healthy level. The smoothness and thickness, can only be compared to a milk shake.  Overall - this is a great beer. I look forward to seeing it on tap at either a growler station or a pub. There really is no stout that is as complex, tasteful and drinkable. If you have never tried this, do so. I find the tap version smoother and silkier in texture, but a bottle is also really good.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,jettjon,4.4,"Discovered a 4-pack quite unexpectedly on a trip to Birmingham, AL. Never had this particular gem, so I approach this review with great antici…pation.  From a 12 oz bottle stamped 9/17/12, into my Sam Adams glass (thanks, guys!). Engine oil black with no light penetration. Thin cap of brown foam is a bit disappointing. Good retention with lacing down to bottom of the glass. Nose of toast, milk chocolate, and burnt and sweet malts.  On the palate, chocolate and lots of coffee, loaded with semisweet malt up front. Hints of warm alcohol. Hops assert toward the end. Finishes on a mild acidic coffee note. Great balance of sweet and bitter. Very coffee-like.  Mouth is semi-viscous, perhaps a touch thinner than I’d expect but quite complementary.  Overall: Is this an epic, 99% beer? To me, no. Maybe it’s just that I’m not a tremendous fan of the style. It’s certainly an outstanding example of a double stout, and the wife and I both agree that it’s delicious in its own right. However for me, it’s just another check box and not one I’d go out of my way for again. Just too many good beers in styles I like better. YMMV.

Aroma is darkly roasted barley, sweetish chocolate, and mild coffee and just a little lettuce-y hops. First hit is unexpectedly not sweet, alot more coffee flavor than chocolate. The chocolate begins to dominate with warming: bittersweet chocolate, more bitter than sweet with the hop twang finish adding to the bitterness.

The oats add a dry/bready note to the mix, the nose is really nice!  taste etc... the nose is but a tease, all the flavors detected in the nose explode in the mouth, it is thick enough, the carbonation is married perfectly, the alcohol just lets you know it is there... man this is tasty, you get the deep and dark coffee burnt taste (not smoky or ash-y), the flavor really stays with you for some time but yet ... you want more. This drinks way too easy for the ABV so watch (or don't, heh). This is worth savoring.

The chocolate and sugars from the oats give it a nice sweetness,some great dark roast coffee beans and roasted barley offer some great roastiness. A touch of unoffensive alcohol is there too. I will add that as it warms up the coffee really comes alive. Flavor is everything I hoped it would be. Huge dark roasted coffee, chocolate that starts off on the bitter end of the spectrum but quickly transitions into sweeter chocolate alongside the sugars from the oats, on top of a nice roasted malt foundation and with a nice slightly bitter char finish. Beautiful. A medium bodied, silky mouthfeel. Overall, loved it and I was not let down one bit. Everything I hoped it would be and totally worth all the hype/love it gets.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Exactly what you'd expect.  T - Much like the smell, but better! The coffee slighlty dominates the chocolate, which I prefer, but this is a well-balanced beer. Sweet and bitter. Roasted malts. An awesome breakfast stout!  M - Creamy, thick body with little carbonation. Perfect for the style.  O - One of the best!

Appearance: Dark, dark amber, nearly black with 2 fingers of soft sandy/tan colored head, recedes quickly leaving some loose lacing which remains as spotting for a while Had it in a tulip chalice.  Smell: Coffee, oats, and cereal grains are most noticeable, with strong notes of cacao as well. Vanilla, dates and almonds in there too.  Taste: Yum yum yum- So much dark coffee (like a Sumatran or French Roast) and roasted malt upfront, with more coffee and cocoa bitterness at the end. Almost no alcohol detected, but don’t be fooled, it’s over 8%. Aftertaste is pleasantly sweet cocoa that never really goes away haha.  Mouthfeel: Fairly full bodied, low carbonation and relatively low acidity, super smooth (need I add more adjectives: silky, velvety, etc.?)  Overall: What can I say? I don’t feel worthy. Almost pooped myself when I saw this on the shelves in CT- I had almost given up waiting. A perfect beer for the last day on Earth.

1199,11757,Radin,4.42,"Got this beer at a ""craft your own six pack"" station at my local Wegmans. Didn't have any food with it. Drank in a typical glass mug.  Appearance: Poured a beautiful dark brown/black. Color has never been my strong suit. Head was 1.5 fingers thick and light brown, as expected. Didn't retain well but lacing stuck around for a little while.  Smell: Roasty. Chocolate and coffee more than anything.  Taste: Expected more flavor to come out than did. Chocolate covered coffee beans is the best way to describe it. As i swallowed, the chocolate stayed and there was a coffee smelling type sensation in my nose. Very enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: low-medium carbonation which i tend to like, so satisfying for me. Silky and smooth.  Overall: Cannot complain at all. I expected it to be slightly better, but it is still one of the best stouts i've had. Smooth and tasty. Enjoyed every sip.  Enjoyable beer. Will have again and definitely recommend.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,CowsandBeer,4.44,"4 pack purchased in KC for $10. Glad to finally be able to try this. Served in a snifter.  Appearance: One finger head which quickly recedes to a small ring around the glass. Thin splotches of lacing remain after swirling the glass.  Smell: Beautiful aroma of roasted coffee and malts. To sum up it up briefly: imagine opening a bag of freshly ground coffee.  Taste: Like a fresh cup of coffee with a dark chocolate smoothness towards the end. Leaves a nice molasses and vanilla flavor in the mouth. Oatmeal becomes more noticeable as it warms. Maybe even a snickers bar? Only a small mention of alcohol. Notes of an acidic bitterness that is common in all coffee beers that I've had, though it's not as prominent here as with other beers. I keep thinking that if I look at the bottom of the glass I'll see coffee grounds or little flakes of chocolate.  Mouthfeel: The body is a little thinner that I would have preferred but not bad overall. Nice and velvety from the oats. Very creamy.  Overall an amazing beer that lives up to the hype (but you know this, man). I can only imagine what pairing this alongside sausage, bacon, eggs and toast would taste like. Or even some cheesecake. Incredibly creamy and well balanced; the coffee is never overpowering. Highly drinkable and memorable. 4.0",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,hagbergl,4.92,"Ah, Founders Breakfast Stout, one of my favorite beers in all the world and the beer I've had more of in the last several months than any other. I'm glad to finally be reviewing this black beauty. I bought a four-pack of Breakfast Stout at Kimbark Wine & Liquors in Hyde Park, Chicago, IL. It was enjoyed in my Chimay goblet.  Appearance (4.5/5): Breakfast Stout is pitch black and is topped by a gorgeous bubbly, light brown 1.5 finger head of foam that recedes slowly and leaves behind a bit of tan lacing and sudsy residue.  Smell (5/5): This beer smells like...well, BREAKFAST. Big notes of coffee, dark chocolate and cacao nibs jump from the glass. Some subtler notes of grain and oatmeal are worked in there, as well. Though booze would be an appropriate odor for a big imperial stout, this has no boozy odor to speak of and I can't complain. This lets the coffee and chocolate aromas to really stand out and assert their considerable strength. This is a phenomenal smelling imperial stout. It takes all of my willpower to not dive in and continue taking notes.  Taste (5/5): A hit of coffee bitterness hits in the foretaste, recedes, and gives way to some nice chocolate and oatmeal/cereal flavors, as well as some sweet raisin notes, before coming back and finishing bitter. More sweetness is mixed in at the end, but this is not one of those cloyingly sweet beers. Very assertive, incredibly flavorful. The huge dose of coffee is balanced by the chocolate and oat undertones. Wonderfully complex flavor that's even better than drinking a mocha in October. Breakfast Stout opens up as it warms. Very little alcohol presence to be noticed.  Mouthfeel (4.5/5): Velvet smooth feel; low carbonation (as expected), quite drinkable. When the flavor is this good, and nothing in the mouthfeel stands in its way, you can't help but go back to the well often. Gets creamier as it warms.  Overall: Breakfast Stout is one of the finest imperial stouts around; it's my personal favorite because it's relatively lower in alcohol and more drinkable than most beers in the style. Its extraordinary mix of coffee, chocolate, and oatmeal stout characteristics is impressive. This is a decadent treat that is also very reasonably priced (I bought my 4-pack for $11.99 at the local liquor store in Hyde Park). Great stuff. Don't be fooled into thinking Breakfast Stout is a lesser beer next to Founders' other stouts, especially the ""white whales"" in the stable–Kentucky Breakfast and Canadian Breakfast stouts. It's wonderful in its own right! Go buy some before the weather warms up.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Most of the usual players here. Coffee, chocolate, a slight spice, and sweetness from the oatmeal to round it out. Delicious!  T- Big hits of roasty malt and chocolate/coffe. Ever so slight hint of alcohol. Very delicious.  M- Fairly thick. low-med carbonation. All the flavors coat the tongue on this one. Truly lives up to the billing of a Breakfast Stout!!

Mouthfeel: Not quite as viscous as BCBS or Founders Imperial Stout but still damn tasty.  Overall: Before I understood dark beer, I tried this once and wasn't too impressed.

1199,11757,hctap00,4.45,"Pours black with a hint of brown and transparency at the edges. Thin head with lingering tan lacing, that also has a hint of red when poured. Founders makes sexy beers.  Damn near a 5 on the aroma. Coffee is noticeable before I even get my nose into it. Dark chocolate, roasted malt. Some vanilla as it warms. Layered aroma, very nice.  Coffee and a fair amount of bitterness initially, mostly from the roasted malt, but perhaps from earthy hops. Chocolate and malt follow with some sweetness that balance it out nicely. Then more coffee and roastiness. My one gripe about this beer is the finish. Something always seems a bit off. (EDIT: Now I can place it. The taste of slightly burned oatmeal off the bottom of the pan.) The finish and the beer overall improves a lot as it warms, if I can be patient enough. The aftertaste is very nice, a blend of all the flavors that sticks around for a while.  Lovely mouthfeel. Creamy and smooth. Coats the insides of the mouth. Lingers forever.  I would give the taste a 4.25 if I could. The bitterness at the finish is never enjoyable for me, though I am getting used to it. Tastes a bit burnt. Love everything else about the beer.

Head is about two fingers thick brown tan colored fluffy head. Excellent retention shown by the head. Awesome lacing on the sides left by each sip as well as by the slowly receding head. Opaque.  Aroma is just phenomenal and more complex than i could decipher. Abundant coffee is the first thing that you notice. In a blind smell test this could be mistaken for a cup of ground coffee. Strong charred and burnt up roasted dark malts. Some cocoa and chocolate. No booze whatsoever.  Taste is just brilliant. Enters with a burst of coffee. Roasted malts then takeover and provide the bitter and burnt up taste. A good amount of hop bitterness as well. Chocolate, chicory and oatmeal notes. Finish is dry with subtle bitterness.  Mouth feel is full bodied. Slightly medium thick. Well rounded. Warm. Creamy. Bitter. Low to moderate carbonation.

S- Burnt grain is dominant, with some baker's chocolate.  T- Forward tastes of coffee, then some burnt grain, and finally the chocolate. Coffee and grain meld together to add lots of bitterness to this brew.  M- Thick and viscous, probably added from the oatmeal. Moderate carbonation and you can taste some of the booze.  O- This is a must try for anyone that loves stouts. A tasty beer that sets the mark for double stouts, In my opinion they could mellow out on the chocolate malt as it tastes a little too much like coffee grounds.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,scootsmal,4.45,"Very tasty beer. Picked this up at my local Bev Center purely because of its hype. Im not much of a stout person, but this is very good. The initial sniff off the bottle wasnt all that amazing, but once poured into a glass it came alive. Powerful notes of chocolate and coffee, and it tastes just as good as it smells.

1199,11757,emyers,4.62,"Coffee stouts have always been my favorite style, and Founders Breakfast Stout is quite frankly on another level than all the others I've had. I will note that you really have to let this beer warm up - if you drink it straight out of the fridge you won't get the full experience.  A - Dark brown with tan lacing, minimal head.  S - A delicious mix of coffee and dark chocolate. The coffee is definitely assertive and stands out as the dominant player, but the chocolate complements it perfectly. The two most common issues I have with coffee beers is either not enough coffee or not enough other components to back up the coffee. Not the case here.  T - Once again, like espresso beans dipped in dark chocolate. Truly phenomenal. You get that in-your-face coffee flavor, but it's backed up by rich dark chocolate and a hint of caramel. There's a nice bitterness (likely from the coffee and chocolate, it's not quite the same as hop bitterness) that works perfectly with the flavors of the beer. No alcohol heat.  F - Medium to full, very nice silkiness. Coats the tongue nicely.  O - Truly a world-class example of a coffee stout. It has an addictive quality that makes it almost impossible to put down once you start drinking it. I've had dreams about drinking this beer - It's that good.  What really makes this stand out above other quality coffee stouts is that the base beer is great even without the coffee - when aged at least a year the coffee fades out and the chocolate takes center stage, leaving an imperial chocolate stout that is still a phenomenal beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ChrisPratz,4.53,"A: Pours a very dark, espresso black coloring to about an inch of milk chocolate colored head. This dissipates slowly to a very nice veil of head that lingers for awhile but doesn't cling much on the way down.  S: Some coffee notes and dark chocolate aromas up front, make way to a nice roasted malt air with hints of lighter milk chocolate as well. Very very nice.  T: Roasted malt and smokyness up front, leads to a mild espresso flavor with alot of dark chocolate mixed in. Theres also some hops bitterness midway thru the palette but its barely noticeable. No burn or alcohol bite at all.  M: Very nice carbonation level for the style, def an oatmeal stout with a nice chewy/creaminess ud expect.  O: Very nice stout right here.

Taste is just outstanding slight bitterness but a fresh coffee taste. I think that the bitterness is coming from the bittersweet cocoa tones i got in the smell. No alcohol burn at all. Mouthfeel is just right, perfect richness. Creamy you can feel that this beer is loaded with flavor. All in all, so worth the wait. Really seemed to bring alot of qualities out.

Starts off with biting acidity, a slight sweetness, and floral hops. Moves up in acidity, peaking with hop bitterness that is a little piney, right as there is a warming booziness, but then the toasted malt comes in full force for the finish. Savory, almost smoked malt and coffee lingers in the mouth.  I'm not huge on the acidity in the front, but the finish is sublime (thus splitting my taste score; 5 for finish, 3 for the onset).

1199,11757,actinphishy,4.92,"I love beer of all kinds! I love the hoppy, the malty, the dark, the light, the thick, the smooth, the strong, and the refreshing. I love beer, and Founder's Breakfast Stout is hands down the finest beer I have ever had. Ever. This is the kind of beer that will please almost anyone, except those who prefer mild, light beer. I imagine this will describe almost no one who is on this site. This beer presents as a super dark chocolate stout, which might lead you to expect something thick, like Guinness. However, the mouthfeel is much thinner than you might expect, and pleasantly refreshing for a stout. And while there are overtones of chocolate in the palate, the taste is largely that of a malty coffee. Many coffee flavored beers come off bitter, which for us hop heads is not always bad, but Founder's Breakfast Stout is remarkably balanced. I have tried this beer both from the bottle and on-tap. Both retain the integrity of this exemplary brew. And unlike most beers with this high of alcohol content, Breakfast Stout finishes smooth. It is good on the morning, as its name implies, it is good in the afternoon (the time I am currently enjoying it), and it is good late at night (my personal favorite time to enjoy it). Grand Rapids has been voted the best beer city in America, Founders Brewery is widely seen as the best brewery in the city, and for my money Breakfast Stout is the best of the many great beers they brew. It only comes around for a short time toward the end of the fall, so if you see this brew available at your local pub or in your local beer case, do yourself a favor and grab a few. You won't regret it!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Getting lots of dark chocolate upfront followed by coffee and roasted malts.  T: Tastes just like it smells. Wonderfully smooth, creamy, chocolaty, malty, and a slight caramel flavor on the backend. Amazing balance going on. Moderate carbonation which is perfect for this style. Could easily drink this for breakfast with some scrambled eggs, a side of bacon, over some maple syrup.  O: This is a very well done stout. You can taste the dedication and effort that founders puts into this beer. Awesome aroma and flavor. Not bitter at all.

1199,11757,Bouleboubier,4.65,"So far, I haven't been much of a fan of (actual) coffee in beers. Usually pass them over. This one, however, is awesome - in the true sense of the word.  Pouring out into the glass, I first marveled at the dense-frothy and spider-webby stickiness and rich, dark shade of mocha brown head. Sticky mess all over - love it.  Superb and surprising rich, dark-roasty mocha aroma - almost cappuccino - with an underlying hi-grade bitter chocolate. Oh so inviting.  Immediate mouth impressions - fine Italian espresso with an initial creamy, rich body - not terribly bitter, though a medium-mellow, but pleasing, roasty bitterness does establish itself and lingers long after each sip.  The coffee is way out front, but balanced beautifully against a chocolaty-roasted-nutty background - almost, but not quite as sweet or flavored similarly to coffee cake. While dropping off clean, it does also give off some alcohol warmth but, thankfully, not the flavors/aromatics of it. If it does, it's been woven in well.  Just mildly mind-blowing. Love it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,BigRob329,4.58,"A - Great look to it when served in a tulip. Very dark black with a little less than a finger of head. Almost looked creamy.  S - Immediate smell of coffee, but definitely mixed with a balance of chocolate and a stronger espresso smell. Smelled very appetizing, even after eating a big dinner.  T - Maybe the best taste I've found in a beer. Perfect balance of chocolate and espresso, making it smell almost of an unsweetened chocolate coffee. Slight sweetness, I'd say a hint of mocha.  M - One of the smoothest beers I've ever had. Heavy and somewhat creamy, and perfect for this beer. Definitely compliments the smell and taste.  Overall, this is a first ballot HOF beer for me. Every aspect of this beer was near perfect, every sip was a mouthful of greatness. The lower and lower it got in the glass, the more and more I savored it. Will definitely have this beer again whenever I see it on tap, and will have to buy it soon in bottles.

1199,11757,MaximalC,4.33,"Pours seal brown with a decent amount of mocha foam. Aroma smells strongly of fresh roasted coffee and dark chocolate. The roasted malt dominates the flavor profile, lending a coffee flavor that is smooth and slightly bitter. The coffee actually tastes a bit blacker than I recall, which is a slight detraction. Dark chocolate is present as well, but it struggles some to assert itself. The mouthfeel is smooth and luxurious, reinforcing a rather decadent vibe overall. A malty stickiness lingers on the lips after each sip. My lone complaint here is that I wish there was a bit more balance between the coffee and the chocolate. As is, the coffee becomes a bit too astringent as the beer warms, but this is undoubtedly a fine brew regardless.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Mouthfeel is heavy but not chokingly thick. Carbonation is sharp on the tongue and creamy on the swallow. It starts sweet and and semi-sweet. Sweetness is nice but I'm pretty sure two of these would get sickening sweet. Alcohol is masked very well. It's my first for the style so I can't really compare.

Can smell, dark chocolate and milk chocolate, toffee, barley, oats, wheat, very rich, smells very sweet and sugary, like a fresh chocolate bar.  T: Very complex and enriched flavor, coffee, chocolate, barley, oats, wheat, toffee, its pretty sweet and balanced, its kind of smoky and woody as well, has a strong hop presence as well as alcohol at the finish, gives heat to it.  M: Has lower levels of carbonation, a plus for me, it has a really balanced mouth feel, its rich, balanced, creamy, fulfilling, has a stronger aftertaste from the hops and booze, but it complements the sweetness and smoky flavors.  O: Yeah, It's really good, as the hype would make you expect, It is good, its very well balanced, has a great aroma to it, taste is good, I was sort of expecting better, don't get me wrong it it is very good, but it didn't blow me away, as has happened with other high class beers, but it is really good, it has low carbonation, its smooth, rich, thick, good volume to it, its pretty expensive, $10 for a 4 pack, but I'd say its worth it, great depth to it, almost as rewarding as a good meal but in a bottle, of course, I recommend everyone to try this, Pure Michigan.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Groenebeor,4.47,"I had this beer on tap at the Beer Kitchen in Kansas City, Missouri. Both my girlfriend and I sampled this beer, poured into a small, 5 oz. glass.  The appearance is well above average, with a dark, entirely opaque, rich dark brown body and a tan, almost pecan colored head. The head lasted for a significant amount of time, with great lacing down the side of the glass - I enjoyed every little sip, the lacing is indeed noticeable.  The nose of this beer is really great - all the typical smells of a breakfast stout. Vanilla, coffee, some caramel, it's all great, and really can best be compared to a really fresh made coffee. Indeed, a full blown Italian roast.  The taste of this beer is nothing short of perfect. The nose delivered a great preview into the actual taste of this beer, and in some ways held back on just how strong the coffee flavor was. I'm not talking a deep, roasted coffee flavor, but some of those floral notes you get with a great, fresh, light roast coffee really shine in this beer.  The drinkability is considerable - especially knowing this beer isn't exactly low ABV.  Overall it's near perfect. Some better showings in all categories would put this into the perfect arena, and I have a feeling a really fresh sample at the brewery itself would hit that.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The head pours light brown with a reddish hue, one finger thick and with average retention.  Smell - Aroma is of fresh coffee grounds, earthy and with hints of chocolate.  Taste - Dominant coffee character from start to finish. Hits on subtle notes of sweet and bitter chocolate. Earthy. There's a trace element of leaf or mint freshness mid-taste. Finishes bittersweet with just a hint of heat.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, with fair carbonation. Smooth and easy drinking.  Overall - One hell of a stout. Lacks ideal body, but it's far from a problem. Hops are scaled back, relying on strong roasted malt character. It works, and it works well.

S: Can I say coffee enough to described this roasty, toasty masterpiece? The smell is coffee, chocolate, and just generally roasted. Ever since I've had this beer, I think of it everytime I smell strong, dark coffee.  T: Let's talk about coffee again. The taste is deliciously coffee, with a touch of that chocolate and that roast. Not too complex because it doesn't have to be. It's a double coffee chocolate imperial stout and it damn well taste like it. Also, the alcohol is pretty well masked considering its over 8%.  M: Rather full mouthfeel, with mild carbonation.  O: This coffee stout has easily become one of my favorites. It sticks to its name and doesn't look back.

Taste - Dark Chocolate, Oatmeal, Cocoa, Coffee, and Burnt Malts. The Oatmeal and Chocolate blend together very well along with the other flavors, which are all very rich.  Mouthfeel - It's heavier feel to it without feeling thick and the carbonation is rather mild, not really creamy like I was expecting though. Still, it's a very easy beer to drink.

Nice bits of lacing drip and stick to the edge of the glass while a thin bit of foam settles in on the darkness.  S- Coffee, coffee, and more coffee! Some hints of really dark bitter chocolate and a hint of sweet whipped cream. Little touches of the alcohol open the nasal passages. Not really alot of depth or flavors other than really nice black coffee notes going on. Nothing stellar, but one of the better smelling coffee stouts out there.  T- I do like my coffee black, and this is a nice, rich deep cup of coffee! Little notes of cocoa, but not too chocolatey. It has a subtle sweetness hiding, yet somehow shining thru. Nice bitterness and a decent chewy mouthfeel. Barely any alcohol in the finish.  M- Bitter, sweet and chewy. Probably the best mouthfeel of any coffee stout I've had ( other than GI BCBCS). Really nice creaminess and bitter roasted coffee. I love the fact that it's not overly sweet. Well done Founders!  O- A top coffee stout for sure! Really nice blend of bitter black coffee, rich chocolate, and sweet cream! I'll definately be grabbing more of this while it's around.

It's mid September and the temperature is in the 90's. Perfect ipa weather but breakfast stout is on draft and I've never had it on draft and couldn't turn it down. This is by far my favorite stout.  Poured into a tulip glass. Dark as night with a creamy dark beige head. Nice lacing. Looks like it should. Perfect.  Smell is chocolate and strong coffee. Maybe a little malt but the coffee and chocolate dominate.  The taste will bring a tear to the eye of a stout lover. Coffee to start followed by chocolate and malt. Lingering coffee aftertaste. Love the bitterness from the dark chocolate and dark coffee. This is the taste that all other stouts strive for.  Mouthfeel is perfect. The oatmeal base makes this super smooth and full bodied. All stouts should be this smooth. Perfect.  Overall the quintessential stout. So far there is no other stout that comes close. Prairie Bomb is close but the mouthfeel doesn't compare. After a fall or winter hike this is the ultimate beer. Mid September and 90 degrees it's still great.  Like most stouts, the beer improves as it warms. That is exponentially true of Breakfast Stout.

T: Coffee, dark fruit (that, at the end, has an almost sour hint), sharp roast that compliments the coffee. A hint of booze on the end.  M: Thick and smooth. Nice.

Very nice. I'm not a coffee drinker or fan, so, personally, I'd have preferred less coffee, but still delicious.  M: Absolutely perfect!!!

Colder, the flavors blend well of chocolate, malts, hint of coffee and a fine sweetness. The warmer is gets, the black coffee dominates and becomes rather distracting as the cocoa fades.  Very thin feel on the tongue. Appearance would suggest otherwise.  I've had this in the bottle and I am disappointed. So I see this on-tap and figured it would be better---not. Extreme hype and a waste of money. Earlier years may have been great, I don't know.

It’s sweet enough to rouse your taste buds in the morning, and should you fail to drink the entire supply, it doubles as a dessert beer.

The head quickly disappeared into a thin ring around the rim of the glass. There was no appearance of carbonation with very few bubbles at the top. Pretty much no lacing or retention to speak of as well.  Smell - This is a great smelling stout. A combination of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts come through strong right off the bat.  Taste - This is simply amazing. Again, the combination of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts blend perfectly together for a well balanced beer. As the beer warms, a slight bit of alcohol shines through, but it is not overpowering at all.  Mouthfeel - This is a thick, full-bodied beer with very little carbonation. It is silky smooth all the way through with a bit of stickiness throughout. A slight bitterness lingers in at the end, but it is not overwhelming.  Overall - I absolutely love this beer!

Extreme roasty malt dominates; can’t detect much if any hop aroma.  Holy moly. I can’t imagine a darker tasting beer. I don’t know if I can imagine a beer this dark even after tasting it. Like a chocolate covered burned-up charcoal briquette. Can't taste the hops, just that intense malitness. Mouthfeel has the thickness that’s obviously characteristic of the style, but not quite as extreme as some others. There’s a bitter aftertaste, but in comparison to that briquette flavor, the aftertaste is almost sweet by comparison.  Seems like the logical conclusion of an imperial stout.

Retains shortly and fades after a few minutes. Color is pretty close to black. Holding to the light lets little, if anything through. Some dark brown around the edges. Not sure what more you can ask for from a stout. Looks great.  S - big on chocolate, roast, coffee. Smells delicious  T - One of the best tasting beers I have had. This beer drank like two different beers as it warmed over 20 minutes (it was a task to let it sit there to see what it would do as it warmed!!)  First sip is huge chocolate note. Most well done chocolate I've had in any beer. Tastes of sweet dark chocolate, as opposed to the sweet milk chocolate or bitter bakers chocolate in other beers. This taste like a bite of gourmet dark chocolate. There is some very smooth vanilla and then then creamy coffee overtones. Finishes with some slight bitterness and chocolate notes that fades slowly.  As the beer warms, it almost transitions to a completely different beer. The last third of the glass is heavy coffee grounds coming to the forefront with chocolate moving to the back seat. I have to say, I liked the first character better, but, even still, the beer has moved to an excellent coffee stout. Really really great.  M - Perfect thickness, light carbonation, feels creamy and rich. Like a great oatmeal stout should be.  O - I wish I would not have known the hype behind this beer before I tried it. I found myself nit picking the brew trying to find holes in the facade. That being said, I couldnt find any. Perhaps my favorite stout I've tried to date. Just absolute perfect balance. The chocolate, coffee vanilla flavors complemented each other, with no one element fighting against the others. Great beer, very much deserves the acclaim.

T - ...And tastes delicious too. Strong mocha, coffee, and chocolate flavors in this stout. Not a hint of the 8.3 ABV comes through. They call it breakfast in a bottle, but it's more like dessert. Tastes like coffee ice cream with chocolate syrup on top. Absolutely amazing.  M - Creamy with the slightest touch of carbonation on the tongue. It's a heavy, full-bodied beer and tastes very thick going down, almost like chocolate syrup or a mocha latte.  This is one of my favorite beers of all time from one of my favorite brewers.

Bitter, dark, and roasted coffee starts off the flavor, with the sweeter, dark chocolate notes hitting shortly thereafter.

Very thick and chewy, and extremely dry.  Overall, an excellent stout worthy of the hype it receives.

1199,11757,Beer_Runner,4.35,"Bottled on 08/01/12 (aged about three months before opening).  A: A slow pour into a standard pint glass produces about one finger of dark mocha colored head that is dense and a little clumpy. The heads dissipates slowly and managed to last about half the session. The brew is a very dark brown to almost black and is absolutely opaque.  S: The aroma is a blend of dark roasted barley, coffee, unsweetened chocolate, and roasted grains combined with bready yeast.  T: The taste has a good shot of charred barley along with toasted grain and chocolate that is all complimented by a malty sweetness.  M: The body is medium-heavy and there is only a small amount of carbonation, which is just right for this beer.  O: This is a different and very cool variation on the stout style. The charred flavor is prominent but not overwhelming. It is a very complex beer with flavors of oatmeal, coffee, and bready yeast combining with the char; and then there is a malty sweetness that underlines everything, balances the different flavors and holds them all together. For beer drinker who appreciate coffee stouts, oatmeal stouts, and chocolate stouts, this beer manages to combine the best aspects of these styles into one very pleasing beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,keeganfrank,4.78,"This might be the best-looking beer I've ever seen. It's a pitch-black stout with a soft, foamy head the color of milk chocolate. The aroma, where to begin...chocolate, fruit, molasses, oatmeal. Founders put breakfast in a beer the way Willy Wonka put dinner in chewing gum. I taste sweet coffee, chocolate chip pancakes with syrup and oatmeal with berries. What a sensational brew!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,wd40,4.7,"This is such a tasty beer that I can't believe it's relatively easy to get! Pour is a very dark brown with no transparency. The smell is of coffee with some chocolate in the background. The taste is a complex interplay of coffee, chocolate, and caramel without being too sweet or too bitter. It is smooth and easy to drink and yet it has a lot going on. I love this beer. It is one of my new favorites.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,cfrobrew,4.2,"Pours like it doesn't have much carbonation but has plenty in the mouth feel. Nice thickness but not overly thick because of the carbonation. Smell is indicative of roasted coffee/barley. Nice roasted flavor smoothed out by a nice sweet smell. Very delicious imperial stout, not too strong at all. The only down side is that it came in a 12 ounce bottle and I've only got one... Can't wait to try some of the other versions! Overall I would say its excellent, a very bright imperial stout with natural coffee flavors.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Jugs_McGhee,4,"Oh boy. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle acquired at a beer store near my work and served into a New Belgium goblet in Los Feliz, California. I had never seen this in the LA area until recently. 8.3% confirmed. Expectations are through the roof; I had Kentucky Breakfast Stout and loved it. I'm hoping this lives up to the hype. Cost was $6.99 (people on the East Cost are probably cringing).  Served straight from the refrigerator and allowed to warm considerably over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  As I poured, no head was forming so I upped the vigor considerably.  A: Pours a beautiful rich dark tan colour head half a finger thick with excellent cream. Retention is abysmal (maybe 20 seconds). Colour is a solid nontransparent jet black. It looks as it should for the style, but I would like to see better retention. It's a minor gripe. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Appears undercarbonated.  Sm: Heavy rich coffee java notes. Heavy coffee bitterness. It really slaps you upside the head. I get minor chocolate, roast, and oatmeal notes - sure. But strong coffee is dominant. An aggressive strong aroma that goes for the jugular. Dark malts. It's very assertive and bold.  No hops are detectable. No yeast or alcohol comes through.  T: Heavy coffee, with some bitterness there at the finish. Chocolate malts and a bit of chocolate alongside dark malts comprises the foundation. I'm a bit surprised actually; it lacks a substantial body. Not a usual characteristic of beers in the style. Oats are there smoothening it through and through. No real cream. No yeast or alcohol comes through. The coffee notes are rich and biting. Hopping is minimal and floral but barely detectable (just as it should be). A light undertone of warm sherry throughout. I imagine this will improve as it warms. Some raisin, even some molasses sure. I don't get any herbal notes as some have reported. A touch viney. No real caramel. No nuts here. It isn't ""that kind"" of imperial stout. Very delicately balanced and built. They knew what they were doing when they put this treat together. As it warms, I get more true milk chocolate notes (not merely chocolate malt).  Mf: I'm a bit taken aback at the blatant undercarbonation. It's naturally smooth from the oats, nicely wet, and quite chewy. Suits the flavours quite well, and it really evokes a clean breakfast beer - because who really wants carbonation in the morning. I understand the intentionality behind the choice, but that said I still think I'd prefer it creamier, thicker, and even a bit coarser and dryer. I like it as is, though; I'm just identifying personal preference.  Dr: I can definitely see myself having this for breakfast. Boy that'd be good. Very drinkable; I imagine the caffeine zing from the coffee could keep you steadily drinking it for some time. It's not at all in the creamy heavy thick arena of imperial stouts. It's more a sharp coffee imperial stout, and in that it's quite a success. I'm not disappointed with it, but I will say that I remember enjoying KBS far more than this offering. Still, Founders seems to always deliver - at least based on the few beers I've had from them. At $6.99, I wouldn't get this again, but would at $3.99 or better. A must-try for fans of the style; great for the style. It doesn't quite join the ranks of something like Brunch Weasel or Speedway stout in terms of coffee-centric imperial stouts, but it flirts with that level; pretty impressive at this price point. Hides its ABV delightfully well. I'll definitely be having this again, ideally aged or on draught. An understated, elegant beer. Bravo, Founders.  I initially gave it a B+, but changed it up to an A- because as it warmed, it got noticeably better. Give her some time once you pull her out of the fridge. It's worth it.  A-  -  Bottle from Duff27. Adding some brief notes; served into stemware.  A: Retention is better than the first review - a good 4 minutes. I think the glassware makes a big difference; I poured pretty lightly. Creamy, dark, appealing.  Sm: Strong black coffee. Evident bitterness. Very assertive. Evocative oatmeal too; oats are usually undetectable and contribute mainly to mouthfeel but they're evident here. I like that.  T: Heavy coffee with accompanying bitterness and roast. The coffee here is really genuine; it doesn't shy away from the raw coffee bean character.  Mf: Creamy, chewy, coarse. Perfect dryness.  Dr: A solid brew; lives up to its well earned reputation. Possibly the best value beer of its quality.  A-.  - 10/09/13 (Fresh FBS):  A: Soft complexion. Even lacing coats glass.  Sm: Sinful coffee w/ roasty, creamy, and espresso notes. Rich and decadent.  No hops/yeast.  Could use more roast. Coffee gets a bit too bitter. Room for more complexity/subtlety.  Above avg depth of flavour. Avg flavour intensity/duration for style.

I can barely taste the alcohol.  M: I'd say its on the heavier side of medium bodied. It is thick and coats the mouth but it feels light. Very smooth and just a very small hint of bitterness.  O:This beer is great and very much worthy of the rating it gets. It's flavors are very well blended. It has all the great qualities of a stout and none of the negative ones.

1199,11757,Marinelliniv2014,4.65,"Recently, a close friend of mine, also a fellow beer admirer, bought me two four packs of Founders Breakfast Stout. To say the least, I was surprised and absolutely amazed that this rare stout had fallen right into my lap.  At first glimmer, the stout portrays a certain coffee-like appearance with a medium-sized head. However, I cannot stop there for this stout holds much more to its appearance than meets the eye. The head is not clean and it's as if the kona coffee brewed into the mix has diluted the stout. That's not all; held up to the light, one can see zero transparency, a darkness is held within of which I have never seen in any other stout. With such a thick and dark body, it's a mystery of what is contained in the depths of a properly poured double chocolate stout just by appearance.  It's obvious at first that this special brew is somewhat dominated by the aroma of the coffee blend. However, a deeper smell reveals the chocolate and oatmeal blended in as well. You can sense the dark aroma instantly and is apparent by the immediate aroma of its ABV (8.4%).  As with most stouts and lighter brews alike, the taste reveals what the sight and scent did not. At first, the sight of the brew was very intimidating. I had felt that enjoying a stout as a primarily IPA driven consumer would be tough, especially with all the high expectations of this being one of the best out there. Least to say, the sight of the stout as well as the smell of it did not live up to the taste.  With a full body and peak taste, Founders Breakfast Stout is by far the best stout I have had to date. I've had my fair share of stouts and really, nothing can prepare. A triple chocolate stout here, a fellow breakfast stout there. The Breakfast Stout by Founders takes the chocolate cake.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Poured from a 12 oz bottle:  A: This one pours a motor oil black with a thin rich mocha coloured head. The head retained for a bit, although there was no lacing to be found. Despite this the sight of the beer is definitely appetizing.  S: Aroma of roasted malt and coffee dominate. I get a bit of the chocolate and some subtle notes of cinnamon as it warmed  T: Absolutely delicious. This beer is pretty much all you could want from a breakfast stout. Roasted malt and rich coffee follow along with the smell. Long finish of coffee and dark chocolate, which was pleasantly bitter.  M: Remains medium bodied despite the full range of flavours. This beer is rather smooth and creamy for all that it brings to the palette.  O: This is certainly one of my favorite stouts I've had so far.

Aroma of is rich coffee and chocolate like a cappuccino. Some roasted character along with caramel and toffee. Also a touch of vanilla; a very inviting aroma.  The flavor is even better. Coffee and caramel up front along with a hint of whipped cream and brown sugar. Some espresso roast and bitterness compliments the sweetness perfectly. Some vanilla and maple syrup comes in but everything leads to a moderately dry, coffee-like finish. Mouthfeel is full and slick but it is never too sweet.  Overall, an absolutely world-class beer.

Absolutely no lacing to be found on the side of the class S – smells like coffee beans and espresso. Can definitely smell the chocolate malts used in this brew. Some scent very reminiscent of a milk stout lingers in the background. T – The first time I had this a month or so ago I really didn’t like it…I’m not sure why. I’ve started to drink a lot more stouts lately and have really learned to appreciate what they bring to the table. Sweet chocolate hits the tongue at first and fades into espresso bitterness. Tastes like a smoky and sweet roast. A bitter taste lingers like baking chocolate. Alcohol taste completely hidden. M – very low carbonation with a smooth silky feel. I like the feel of this beer O – Glad I decided to save some of this to drink later. I really didn’t like it at first and now have grown to appreciate it. Well down Founders! I guess I am spoiled…while some people seek this out, I think I know 5-10 places within a quick drive of my house where I can just go and buy it.

Taste: An excellent, complex taste that more than lived up to the aroma of the beer. Roasted malt, chocolate, and caramel flavors all supported the overall espresso flavor that dominated.

T: This year, 2012, is smoother than previous years. Almost to the point where the 8.3% ABV is muted making it a dangerous delicacy.

A thin layer of tan foam forms for a second, and then disappears quickly.  S: When it's cold, the smells are pretty muted. Decent-smelling at best, but nothing mindblowing. But once this gets warm, watch out. Big, heavy notes of dark roasted coffee, burnt wood, black licorice, some faint cooked oats and a lot of dark chocolate. Stellar.  T: Opens with a nice velvety smoothness and some soft notes of roasted malt and oats. Then explodes into flavors of rich dark coffee, burnt coffee grounds, baking chocolate and some faint cola nut. Finishes of a heavy roasted malt and acrid coffee note. The oats lend a nice smoothness, but I kind of wish the mouthfeel was a bit heavier. A top notch stout nonetheless.

Lots of coffee aromas give a roasted quality to the beer. The is also an undercurrent of sweetness from the chocolate.  As I taste the initial coffee flavors aren't as strong as the aroma, but after I swallow, coffee bitterness lingers on, as well as the taste of roasted whole coffee beans. Chocolate flavors are mellow and not overly sweet. It is incredibly tasty.  The beer is very smooth and easy drinking (but so much darker and more flavorful than any major brand that uses those two phrases as selling points). The alcohol is completely hidden. It isn't all that sticky, and though a coat is left behind in my mouth that is fairly flavorful, I have no desire to counter the beer with a glass of water as I sometimes want to do with other imperial stouts.  This is a really great coffee stout. The addition of chocolate makes it even better. I'll admit that I couldn't discern any of contributions the oatmeal made, but that's ok.

A: Pours jet-black with a thin ring of dark, coffee-colored foam that leaves some nice sheets of tan lacing on the glass. Deep, rich and inviting looking.  S: The aroma of fresh-brewed coffee, flaked rye and bittersweet cocoa can be smelled from a slight distance from the glass. The nose is filled with a sweet, herbal and roasty malt character backed with some spicy, floral notes.  T: Deep, roasted bittersweet chocolate malts and wet, boozy tobacco leaf hits the palate first, producing initial sweet malts that segue from tangy rye, sweet, grainy oatmeal and chocolate cake donuts to the transition into herbal, boozy, licorice flavors that round out the palate.

O: A very impressive, flavorful and balanced imperial stout clocking in at a lofty 8.3% ABV. I know it's been said et naseum, but this beer could truly replace the customary hot beverage in a beer geek's breakfast.

M -Smooth medium/heavy bodied. moderate carbonation... Carpet of refreshing silk on the tongue. outstanding  O- An outstanding stout, Founders definitely puts some excellent beers out... As the name implies I absolutely could drink this for breakfast, but im afraid coffee will need to suffice. The thing that i love with this beer is the mouth feel and deep intense flavor that works hand in hand.  Also compared this side by side to a bottle from last years batch that I aged a year over...

1199,11757,PolishSensation,4.18,"Serving-bottle  Appearance-Hints of dark brown under a creamy, tan head  Smell-This beer has a lot going on, but the oatmeal bite and the chocolate notes are what hit me first  Taste-Excellent. Flavors play off of one another nicely. With the oatmeal, coffee, and chocolate hints its actually not overly sweet. Very nice aftertaste.  Mouthfeel-Not very carbonated, but not as thick as I like my stouts.

M - More of a tingle in the mouth than I anticipated based on the appearance. Heavy but smooth and slightly creamy on the tongue.  O - One of my favorite stouts so far. I've enjoyed everything that I've had from Founders, and this has been the best so far. I haven't had the KBS or the CBS yet, so I can't compare them to this but the regular Breakfast Stout should certainly not be missed.

I also get hints of chocolate and espresso.  T- Starts off smooth and sweet. Like the smell, huge coffee notes on the taste as well. Chocolate and toffee are notable in the taste as well.

1199,11757,troegaarden,5,"It's really, really hard for me to find something about this beer that I don't like! Definitely my favorite stout if not my favorite craft brew.  A: Fairly vigorous pour into a snifter. Creates a very dark head. Closer to a light brown rather than just tan. The beer itself is very dark. It holds almost an oil-like quality in its color.  S: It smells of coffee, chocolate, and malty goodness. Although this beer is 60 IBUs, I feel like the hop presence is not as strong as the two coffee blends and chocolate that are brewed with this beer. I would love to try these coffees individually as I am a coffee drinker.  T: This epic Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout tastes, well, EPIC. The coffee notes are easily recognizable first, followed by a smooth finish thanks to the coffee and oatmeal. This beer is very smooth and pretty drinkable for an 8.3% abv brew.You can also get the hops out of this beer towards the end of each sip. I like hoppy stouts and this one seems to utilize the hops well. Not too overbearing of course, but nonetheless, this beer certainly packs some hops.  M: The mouthfeel is very solid! Very creamy and smooth in nature. Not too much bite to this beer. Of course the hoppiness adds some bite at the end, but overall, this beer is creamy and gentle in its mouthfeel.  O: Like I said at the beginning, this is definitely my favorite stout, if not my favorite beer. Really well balanced with the ingredients and very uniform and smooth in its taste and mouthfeel. I would highly recommend this brew to all. Cheers!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Theres maybe 1 small finger of dark tan khaki colored head that does not linger very long and quickly dissipates to a ring at the edge of the glass.  S- Smells like chocolate covered expresso beans. Lots of rich chocolate, and dark roasted coffee. Strong amount of dark roasted malt, with hints of toasted oats.  T- A fresh eye-opening dose of dark roasted coffee hits you in the face, followed quickly by a wonderful amount of dark chocolate.

I find the label image a little disconcerting....  Poured into a Delirium chalice. Blacker than an event horizon - revealed as a very dark brown while pouring. Produces a decent head of creamy light brown foam that lasts for a while before subsiding. Aroma of rich, dark coffee with a hint of sweetness. Notes of ground coffee beans, burnt grain, roasted malt, cocoa, mild chocolate and faint brown sugar. A lactose sweetness in the background. Intense and perfectly blended - fantastic!  Tastes of freshly ground coffee beans with a deep, satisfyingly bitter finish. Notes of roasted coffee, burnt grain, dark malt, cocoa, subtle chocolate, molasses and faint yeast. A mild sweetness underlies the darker character. A strident yet balanced bitterness upon swallowing, accompanied by a slight background hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, dry and mildly tingly. Lovely body - neither too thick nor too thin. Lightly astringent, with a aftertaste of strong coffee and sweet chocolate notes.  Fantastic. Despite its age this has held up well. A dominant coffee character is superbly blended with hints of chocolate and dark malt to yield a well-balanced breakfast stout. Now I understand why people choose to have this in the morning! Great aroma and flavour - the intensity is mitigated by the beautiful equivalence between its sweet and bitter qualities.

Really knocks it out of the park with the black coffee smell. LIke a fresh brewed cup of joe. The combination of roasted malt, oat and coffee are delicious, add in some chocolate and its a perfect harmony.  T: Rocks you with a bitter coffee right off the bat, follows up with some sweet chocolate and a roasted malt. Has ample hopping in there which compliment the coffee while the malts/oatmeal and coffee work great together too.  M: Very creamy and velvety, not too thick and certainly not watery.

Sadly I had a bottle of this rather than on tap but it was still solid. Of course it's better on tap but it's great beet and you should grab it for sure!  For a stout this really shows some unique characteristics. The coffee flavor is light but it has that acidity that really helps to drive it. That's really the key for me here.

Smell is of fine dark chocolate and coffee, but it's not as aromatic as I would've thought. Taste is outstanding, you can just taste the quality. Some beers use chocolate and coffee that tastes cheap. I felt like I was having good coffee with Ghirardelli dark chocolate in it. It's more dark and roasted in flavor than sweet. Mouthfeel was perfect considering this is over 8% abv. I have had the experience where beers in this category are so sugary sweet they leave my mouth feeling like I had coke, but not with this.

Loads of layering between the strong hit of coffee that is softened by both the chocolate and sweet oatmeal. The beer smells like breakfast on your birthday and you could only hope it tastes the same.  M-Smart move on the part of founders here. Given the fact that it's a breakfast stout, the body is not as thick as a number of other stouts. This helps the feel to meld with the flavors in a way that's almost like a perfect cup of coffee. I wish I had this for breakfast.  T- Wow. As a disclaimer, in order for one to enjoy this stout fully, he or she must enjoy the taste of coffee on its own. Not coffee with sweetener or milk, but just complex bitter and delicious coffee. This flavor is mixed elegantly with both the chocolate and oatmeal, all while still having a hint of bitter hops and sweet malts indicative of beer. The beer is so complex that each sip is different and wonderful.  O-Breakfast stouts are what founders does best. And when it comes to this style they are the best in the business.

Good smell of roast coffee, good strong nose is apparent as soon as I opened it.  Good thick 2 finger head. Nice retention, very nice appearance. I'm excited for this one.  First sip, mouthfeel is a little thin, not at all what I was expecting. Tastes very one dimensional of coffee, not terrible, just not what I had hoped for in an Imperial Stout, not much malt and not at all sweet. Nose lasts and is very pleasant, although misleading since the taste is just not the same.  This was my first time having anything by Founders, I was excited due to the other reviews, but this beer definitely did not live up to the hype. Hopefully this was just a bad batch or bottle.  EDIT: I had my second bottle this past weekend, about 2 weeks after the first bottle. I feel instantly different about this. The taste is much better than before, still not what I would call a sweet stout, but they are obviously not going for that.

A little caramel in there too. No prolonged aftertaste which is a pleasant surprise. You really could drink this stuff for breakfast and it wouldn't seem out of place.  Feel: a touch of carbonation, but not overly carbonated. Just enough to give you a little bite and remind you what you're drinking.  Overall: Not much to criticize on this one.

1199,11757,deathpulse42,4.62,"This is my first review! :) Hello to everyone in the Beeradvocate community!  Appearance (4.5) - Dark as the night sky. Good one-and-a-half to two-finger head. Decent lacing.  Smell (5.0) - Amazing. Dark chocolate and roasted coffee.  Taste (4.5) - Very pleasant. I get the dark chocolate first and then the coffee. The high ABV is nearly undetectable. To be honest, I would like there to be a liiiittle more alcohol ""bite"" at the end. But really, it's exceptional all around. TRY IT!  Mouthfeel (4.5) - Excellent. Medium heaviness. I would like it to be a bit heavier though. Its mouthfeel is TOO similar to, well...simply coffee and dark chocolate.  Overall (4.5) - This is a great beer and an equally great stout. As a college student, I am, of course, always cognizant of price and the value that I get for said price. I paid $11 for a 4-pack of this beer at a local liquor store, and I would gladly buy another 4-pack again for that price. Also, I think that the lower-than-expected heaviness of this beer would make it a good introductory stout for those wishing to expand their palate.

1199,11757,fmccormi,4.02,"Straight pour from 12oz pry-off bottle to a 25cl Duvel Single tulip; bottling date of August 15, 2012 printed in yellow ink on the neck of the bottle (“BOTTLED 08/15/12”)  Appearance (3.5): Pours with one finger of mocha-brown head, a nice mix of fine and coarse bubbles—pretty tight head. The body is pitch black, unsurprisingly, and the lacing is very modest but spotty.  Smell (4.0): The coffee and chocolate are there all right, but the malt richness behind them comes off kind of like cola and rootbeer syrup (not cloying like that, though)—more like iced coffee with some sweetener. It’s nice that the coffee and chocolate scents are definitely discernible though, which is good—unsweetened chocolate and cold coffee.  Taste (4.0): The coffee is much more well-defined here, and is more pronounced and bitter when the beer’s cooler; as it warms, it smooths over and blends with the chocolate flavor, which feels less and less bitter as it warms, and the oats make for a smooth body that ties them together. 60 IBUs? The hops are surprisingly underrepresented here. No trace of the alcohol whatsoever, a very smooth blend.  Mouthfeel (4.5): Silky smooth, tingles lightly just at the end but is very smooth in between. The body is surprisingly light, but definitely on the heavy side of medium—I was expecting something thicker, but am not disappointed by this. The bitterness helps it finish almost dry, but it’s really just smooth all over.  Overall (4.0): Four all around sounds about right. Very well rounded, well-put together stout. It’s not as heavy as I was expecting, maybe not as fragrant, and definitely not as much chocolate as I was expecting, but it’s incredibly smooth as it warms and in the end is a very easy drinker. Very nice beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,JamesMN,4.02,"Bottled on 9/07/12  Appearance: Completely opaque black. Gave it a vigorous pour but only a very thin film of light brown head appeared. Regenerates nicely though.  Aroma: Heavy on the chocolate syrup with hints of the coffee and oatmeal mentioned on the bottle.  Taste: Bittersweet chocolate that lasts from beginning to end on your palate. A bit of black coffee that blends well with the chocolate. Very little sweetness at all in this. The 60 IBUs from the hops are no where to be found, but the bitterness from the chocolate and coffee additions really lingers. Not quite as robust as I was expecting. It's as if there is an element missing that would really take this to a whole new level. No hint of alcohol at all in the taste but then again 8.3% isn't that high.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy. Upper end of medium bodied and easy to drink. A little thinner than I was expecting.  Final Thoughts: I'm a little disappointed in this one but it is definitely a good beer. It basically drinks like cold black coffee which is thinner and less robust than I was thought it would be. I will be cellaring a few bottles so it will be interesting to see how it ages. Definitely pick this one up if you are a fan of chocolate/coffee stouts.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Bigredbeerdrinker,4.7,First craft beer I tried after a friend turned me on. Been waiting for almost a year and FINALLY got my hands on a case and a half. So I will make this my first beer review.  The pour produced a small tan head and is as dark as the shady side of batmans ass. Smell was more chocolate than coffee although there's plenty of roasted scents hitting the nose. The taste on the other hand is all coffee all the way! This was the first stout I had tried as well and would recommend it to ANYONE who likes beer in the slightest. But if you don't like coffee you won't like this. Probably the best beer I've had thus far. Good job founders on this one along with most of your other beers.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,brewdude1982,4.29,"This was a 12 oz bottle poured into a tulip.  It pours dark with great clarity and a thick head with frothy bubbles. It smells a tad hoppy and nothing but roasted malts and a tad boozey. It has a very pleasing taste initially and a great mouth feel. I get roasted malts, coffee, and a slight sweet taste maybe toffee. I love the mouth feel when I take a big pull off of this one. I typically rate beers lower on mouthfeel but this is one that delivers. Beer is not just for lunch anymore people. Great carbonation. Big body.

1199,11757,mattbk,4.2,"Truthfully - this is the most I've looked forward to a beer in a long time. Here we go.  A: Looks very heavy. Dark head. Deep brown, black, no light getting through. The bottle is a bit sticky - docking slightly for that. S: Coffee, chocolate, roast. Maybe a bit of tobacco also. T: Same as the nose, the coffee is far more dominant than the chocolate, and the roast and tobacco are more forward. Just a little bit of residual sweetness at the end, this beer seems well attenuated. A bit of alcohol going down, but barely there. This is very good, and full of flavor, but not too heavy either. I would have liked a little more sweetness, to balance the roast and coffee. M: The mouthfeel is - medium. Was expecting a bit more for an imperial stout. This doesn't bother me a lot, just not what I was expecting. It makes it drinkable, but slightly lower in body than I expect for an imperial stout. O: A very nice imperial stout, with strong coffee flavors, very interesting aroma, and I like the tobacco contribution. A bit more mouthfeel, added by residual sugars, would have bumped it up a bit for me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,tectactoe,4.37,"FBS pours a deep black color with dark, dark brown shining around the edges with very little light able to shine through it. The head is creamy and a nice shade of tan. Low carbonation in the beer required a more direct pour to get a nice, thick head. The smell is absolutely incredible and complex, filled with so many amazing things: coffee, espresso, cocoa beans, mocha, toasted oats, malts, grains - it's absolutely wonderful. The taste is even better. Upon the first sip, the thing that hits you right away is the mocha and chocolate flavors. Sometime around the middle, the coffee beans really start to pull through, along with the toasted grains and malts. The ending finishes with an incredible oatmeal flavor.  The wonderful thing about this beer is that the flavor profile changes so much as it warms up. The coffee beans turn more and more into espresso, the mocha flavor heads from sweet to bittersweet, and the oatmeal becomes more prominent. At 8.3% ABV, the alcohol is masked pretty well, but provides a nice, warming feeling that meshes well with everything else. The body is is pretty big, although maybe a bit thinner than I'd like for being a 8.3% ABV, coffee-centric brew.  Seriously, this is a TOP NOTCH brew. A wonderful compilation of incredible flavors that is constantly changing. I recommend drinking this beer over the course of 40-50 minutes to let it really warm up and develop right in front of your palette. Absolutely wonderful.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,JamesShoemaker,3.78,"Growler fill from Horrock's, Lansing, MI. Consumed three hours after fill, 10/4/14.  A - jet black, deep brown on the periphery where the beer thins. Too dark to determine the opacity, but appears to be relatively clear where the beer thins near the top when swirled or held askew. Big, persistent 1 3/4 finger head, medium tan. Slight foam remains on the surface.  S - big creaminess at the front, complemented by some bitterness from the grain bill, maybe some hops, but it's difficult to determine their character. There's not much evidence of sweetness or coffee bitterness. Just a little roast, a bit watery, and some very low fruity esters.  T - chocolate is the first part of the character, followed by some light graininess, oatmeal, and some bitterness. The bitterness is characterized by some coffee and the dark grains. Surprisingly, the roast doesn't really create much body, so the bitterness dominates and lingers. This contributes to an imbalance in the flavor profile. There's just a bit of sweetness that starts and ends the taste from the chocolate. Some milkiness is evident, which contributes to the sweetness. Little to no hop profile, but what's there creates some bitterness.  M - very smooth with just a bit of roasty/coffee bitterness at the end which lightens the body a bit. Low carbonation, medium body. Alcohol is barely evident and isn't warming at all.  O - tasty, but a little light of body for a stout with a high ABV. The creaminess is nice, but it waffles between being characterized by smoothness and wateriness. I wish the oats stood out more.

Nice quarter-inch caramel/toasted marshmallow colored head. It SMELLS even better - rich, robust fresh ground coffee beans and dark chocolate. There is also a slight nuttiness. The TASTE is superb - lots of coffee bean up front as well as a thickness akin to melted dark chocolate. There is a wonderful clinging MOUTHFEEL; the beer coats the inside of your mouth and leaves a memorable after taste.  Breakfast stout is an excellent beer.

1199,11757,HattedClassic,4.64,"The beer pours a pretty nice dark tan and creamy head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is an opaque black that has a nice slightly oily sheen that gives it a nice shine and look.  The beer smell is a divine combination of dark chocolate and cocoa. The beer also has a slight hoppy note as well that adds some nice hop bitterness to the roast flavors of the coffee notes. The coffee notes come into distinct notes. The first one has a more traditional dark roasted chocolate smell and the other has a more acidic and sharp cocoa smell. The dark chocolate sweetness mixes very well with the distinct coffee notes. The oatmeal adds a nice bready sweet smell to contrast the roasted chocolate.  The beer taste is also very good but more on the coffee side than the sweet dark chocolate side. The sweet dark chocolate still takes the edge off of the coffee and the oatmeal flavor brings all the different notes together. The beer also has a slight bitter hop taste to it in order to counterbalance the coffee and chocolate. The coffee is also present but gives a stronger preference for the Sumatra over the Kona.  The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with biting carbonation in order to give it a crisper and lighter feel. The beer goes down smooth with a slight thickness to it.  Overall, a fantastic beer and one that I look forward to getting every year when it comes out.

1199,11757,SerialTicker,4.5,"Ahh.. I finally got my grubby mitts on a four-pack earlier today and have had Founders Breakfast Stout for my first time.  Bottled 9/4/12 and poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Like Founders' description, it has a really nice cinnamon colored head that quickly dissipates, leaving minimal lacing. After just a few minutes, the brew has a bunch of tiny nitro looking bubbles as a thin head until you finish the glass. The beer itself is pitch black. Looks pretty much like a standard stout or porter.  Smell: Best thing I've ever smelled from a beer. It's essentially just coffee with loads of chocolate, but it smells better than that. Truthfully the best part about the experience of FBS.  Taste/Feel: I was actually a bit let down. It has a lot of coffee and chocolate, with a nice, slight bitterness on the finish. Oatmeal? I don't get that anywhere at all. Not even a trace. If I taste anything other than coffee or chocolate, it's almost a woody taste, with the warming and slight taste of alcohol, but it's pretty well hidden, overall. The feel is really nice though -- it leaves the roof of my mouth slick and coated, has a pleasant, mild carbonation, and has a medium thickness.  Overall, FBS is a great beer, although it doesn't come cheap. At about $11-$12 for a four-pack, you may be tempted to resist. DON'T. I don't see myself buying more than a four-pack a year (mainly because stouts and porters aren't my favorite types of beer to drink frequently), but the rich, coffee and chocolate flavor, along with the unbelievable smell and mouth feel, make this among the best beers I have ever tasted.. just be sure to sip it slowly, as you'll want to experience it both cold, and a bit warmed up.  10/12/13 EDIT: Wow. This is better than I remember it being. The alcohol is slightly more pronounced than I remember it being, which isn't quite what I was hoping for, but that chocolate and coffee is as strong as ever.

Hold it up to whatever light you have lighting your particular hovel-hole and you can't see anything through it. Some might even dare to compare it to black coffee, which brings us to....  Smell: A hint of coffee, but a lot more cream-and-sugary. Certainly some oats in there too.  Taste: Holy smokes- creaminess up front, followed by a transition through milk and then dark chocolate, finally ending up at somewhere between a fine, $7 espresso beverage and that swill that the boys down at the office call coffee. You even get that bitter, sort of gross aftertaste that most crummy coffee has. In this case, however, what is crummy in a coffee is quite incredible in a beer. Don't taste that 8% either.

One finger of tan head dissipated fairly quickly to leave a cappuccino-like lacing and ring around the edge. A couple strong swirls creates a frothy, brown ring that eventually fades to tan again.  Smell: Espresso, but in no way does it dominate the aroma as it does with other coffee-infused stouts. Balancing it is roasted malts, dark chocolate, and smooth oatmeal grain. It smells like a convenience store on Sunday morning: coffee and hot pastries.  Taste: It is a heavenly mélange of espresso, dark chocolate, roasted grains, and oatmeal.

1199,11757,BWHD,4.35,"Founders Breakfast Stout (Original Review 12 Sept. 2012)  Poured into a large brandy snifter at cellar temp.  A: Dark brown to black. A very faint ring of cola-colored light peeks through at the edge, but then plunges into a deep darkness. A thin head of an orange-tinged kahki color struggles to appear when the glass is swirled. It fights to stay present, floats a little, but then dissipates quickly. It seems light and not oily in the glass. Looks medium bodied and not to dissimilar to Coca-Cola. Tight but inconsistent lacing, below average retention.  S: Roasty and acidic milk chocolate. If you swirl it and bring the head back, the head has a more pleasant, creamy chocolate aroma. I’m getting a little graininess from the oatmeal. White sugar peeks through along with a little bit of alcohol and some dry roast bitterness. The coffee is faint for me, but I will disclaim that statement by saying I am a MASSIVE coffee nerd – it might be more prevalent to someone who drinks less coffee than I do! This brew had an almost artificial nose at first, but that seemed to go away as I played around with it.  T: A round, creamy but slightly light flavor of milk chocolate gives way to a dry, dark chocolate finish. This brew doesn’t display much on the attack - it does not attack my taste buds when it hits - but the mid plate and finish display some complex and tasty notes of bitter, pleasant, and roasty dark chocolate. There is definitely some flavor of luke warm coffee on the back end as well. If I aerate a sip as soon as it touches my tongue, I get a sugared, lightly creamed coffee flavor… but I really have to work for it. No alcohol really gets through in the taste which surprises me because I could detect in the nose.  M: The oatmeal gives this brew a delightful “roundness” in the mouth without being too syrupy, oily, or heavy. Medium viscosity and medium bodied in my opinion. Remarkably drinkable.  O: Very solid stout. Not my favorite oatmeal stout (that honor still belongs to that amazing hybrid B.O.R.I.S.), but an absolute delight to sip on… this is almost the definition of a sipper. I enjoyed tasting and observing how this brew evolved over the course of my review. I think this is a great beer geek beer as well as a delicious way to introduce others to the delights of craft beer. Very elegantly crafted and superbly well made. Subtle, intricate, and most importantly, delicious. This beer actually reminded me of some of the better crafted wines I have had – not one aspect of this beer stands out over another, instead each aspect plays well with the next to create a perfectly crafted beer.  UPDATE: (21 Sept. 2012)  Had this beer again today, this time on tap in a standard pint glass from a large format (keg) at the Founders Breakfast Stout release event at Kellehers Irish Pub in Peoria. Tasted coffee like crazy! Served at a slightly colder temp than I reviewed it the first time. Tonight, it has a great balance; not overly thick as some oatmeal stouts, with an awesome, roasty coffee finish. Large format serving was definitely better than the bottle serving I reviewed earlier this month. If you have the chance to try this one on tap, DO IT! Still didn't even get a hint of this brew's 8.3% ABV. Tonight's taste reaffirmed my initial impression: ""Remarkably drinkable.""",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smells of milked coffee, oatmeal chcolate cookie, and dark chocolate.  I taste milk chocolate, significant coffee, faint oats, and some alcohol strength is sensed. Little earthy hop bitterness flash on the finish, but the finish returns to slick chocolate. I wish there was more of a dry powdery oatmeal note and less of a syrup feel. Heat is a little noticeable. This doesn't hide it's ABV too well.  Mouthfeel is a little slick and thin. Wish it was drier. I would think the oats would help provide a drier, and more full bodied beer.  Overall, this is a very tasty. I just don't see the oatmeal in this that it claims on the bottle, but I still enjoy it.

Smell - Wow - rich fresh ground french roast coffee beans, semi-sweet dark chocolate, rich roasted malts, just an incredibly rich nose on this!  Taste - Much like the nose, starts rich french roast coffee, barely sweetened dark chocolate, full bodied rich roasted malts, and then into the finish I get just a lick of licorice, and some toasted pumpernickel breadcrust. There is such a nice drying bitter finish that incorporates all of the rich wonderful flavors mentioned above - so blanced and complex!  Mouthfeel - This is medium to full, creamy and mouthcoating without being heavy - like a lite mousse. Carb is low, soft and silky. All the characteristics of this beer are incredible, but few beers have a mouthfeel like this - must be experienced, it is perfect.  Overall - Just a fantastic coffee chocolate oatmeal stout. Big rich flavors, perfect balance and quite complex, an indescribably smooth and silky mouthfeel w/out being heavy or syrupy, no sign of alcohol, believe the hype (VERY well deserved) and try this beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,eclipse54,4.22,"Re-reviewing on 9/8/2012. Bottle dated 08/02/12 into a tulip.  Pours black with a thin veil of tan head; not a lot of head volume per se, but a healthy ring surrounding the surface and a good quantity of legs darting out from a small central patch of bubbles. Moderate fibrous lacing on the glass.  The aroma is of coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, oatmeal, and a bit of raisin. Not a whole lot of raw sugar in the nose, which is nice.  Flavor starts with black coffee and leads into some dark chocolate, oatmeal, and a bit of cane sugar. Some candied plum, caramel, toffee, and molasses comes through as well.  Mouthfeel is thick, rich, and roasty, a great feeling for a beer that could be a delicious substitue for breakfast. Finish is dry and leaves an almost """"gritty"""" coffee impression, as the coffee and bitter dark chocolate flavors seem to linger a bit longer than the others.  Overall, a great stout that I'm always happy to come back to. The coffee is prominent, but not overwhelming as it strikes a great balance with the rest of the flavors. Just a well put together brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Pours standard black, mocha head, just ok. Aroma is very nice, rich sweet mix of chocolate and coffee. Taste follows, chocolate, medium bitter, medium roast bittersweet black coffee. Hops in the dry finish for balance.  Smooth and creamy, drinkable, actually had a second one today. An afternoon cup of coffee.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,martyl1000,4.14,"I've had this a dozen times before, half of those in controlled environments (quiet evening, tulip glass, no hurry or distractions), yet only now am I stopping to review it. That it's taken so long to write anything down is a measure of the disappointment I've experienced each time. It's hard not to feel it a let down, it being the legend that it is. It's such a towering reputation that I guess I've always mistrusted my own senses and have always thought I'd better reboot and try again.  The aroma is the most disappointing thing about it. There's coffee and drift wood. That's about it. Poured into a tulip glass, the visual appeal ranks up there with the most beautiful imperial stouts, black depths, brown head, sticky lacing.  Flavor roars to a fast start on the tongue. Roasted malt, burnt coffee, grassy hop bitterness. The alcohol is somewhat evident in some unripe berry tartness. But there's no sweetness to speak of. And the finish is a major let down, tinny like a porter, a bit watery, even. This of course spoils the mouth feel.  It's still better than 90% of the imperial stouts in my past. But its distance to the upper echelon (KBS, Peruvian Morning, Mikkeller Black Hole) is vast.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,RichD,4.9,"Finally decided to give this one it's due justice and review it. Poured into a snifter.  A: Pours a midnight black with a small mocha colored head. Looks like a black coffee that was poured a little vigorously. Awesome.  This leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass as the contents in my glass dwindle.  S: A heavy roasted malt and java scent overpower my nose. Chocolate is picked up as well. Smells like morning.  T: A huge coffee and roasted malt backbone. The initial intensity is mind blowing. The oats/oatmeal aspect of this isn't really picked up on the tongue but more in the consistency, which will be discussed in just a moment. Chocolate is also another goodie that Founders has packed into this brew. I can definitely tell that a lot of time was taken into brewing this.  M: A medium to full bodied brew. This is exactly how I would expect this brew to feel. The oatmeal makes this exceptionally smooth.  Overall: This is my favorite brew and I don't see there being a better seasonal brew out there right now. I can't wait to try the variants as I know they could very well take the crown in my book. There's a reason why this is a top 15 beer in the whole world. Upon first learning that Founders had a beer with all these elements, I knew that the second I tasted it that it would be my favorite beer of all time. I'm extremely happy that Founders delivered. They may not have thousands of offerings like some other breweries but the 10 or so that they do compete with the best any brewery has to offer. I'm giving this 5's across the board but as I taste the variants I may have to revisit this. But as of right now, this is the perfect brew for me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The smell is amazing, roasted coffee and esspresso, bitter dark chocolate that wafts into more of a vanilla-ish milk chocolate. Just tons and tons of chocolate and coffee balanced so perfectly. On the tongue, smokey roasted coffee, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, subtle vanilla, just very sweet all around. Full bodied beer here, smooth and creamy, rich and delicious, touches of bitterness, strong coffee after taste. Overall; this beer was worth the wait for me, and absolutely lives up to the hype, its so ridiculously rich and sweet and complex. This is a total winner in my book.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

(hops are noticed at the end as well, but only to balance the delicious sweet dark malt flavor).  M - Smooth and mild, At 8+abv it's hard to say less then full bodied, but it tends to lean toward the thin side and is closer to medium for me. Low carbonation has something to do with this obviously  O - Such a wonder beer. I enjoy this release every year. It does tend to get even better with a little age. I recommend it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smell- If I closed my eyes it would be difficult to tell the difference between this and my morning coffee.  Taste- This is a perfect coffee stout in my opinion. Starts off with a with a touch of bitterness before turning into pure coffee. Despite being pretty strong there is no sign of booze to be found.  Mouthfeel- Not exceptionally thick but it coats the tounge nicely and is incredibly smooth. Nothing lingers and it is actually kind of refreshing.  Overall- I love this beer.

Forms a thin dark tan head with only a small amount of visible carbonation.  S: Coffee, cacao, sweet roasted malt, burnt brown sugar.  T: Follows the nose, and it's really really good...coffee flavors dominate, but some spices (cinnamon?) and some hops do come through as well. Molasses & dark sugar, but isn't a cloying sweetness at all. Coffee bitterness & dark chocolate in the hang.  M: Thinner mouthfeel for a double stout. Low carbonation but adequate for style.

S: I get a nice big espresso character right up front with a smokey note along with it . Behind the espresso is dark chocolate, a very very slight hint of hops. But much else really going on here. Even though the coffee aspect is strong and very dominant here, it is actually quite nice.  T: The espresso really dies down here in comparison to the smell, but this allows the dark fruits and big bitter dark chocolate to really shine through and make this one very well balanced. I also pick up on just a touch of hops, which are mostly noticed far into the finish and they are accompanied by a very nice sweet creamy finish.  M: Fitting for this beer, its full bodied but slightly chewy, but it has a great feel and leaves a nice coffee and dark cocoa feel on the teeth and the palate.  O: As far as I’m concerned, this is an excellent representation of the style and an absolute most have during the fall and winter. I really find the mouth-feel particularly great as it leaves a longing dark chocolate note, which make this an excellent brew during or after a heart steak dinner.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Creamy chocolate nibs with a fresh coffee presence. Roasty this, roasty that... smells delicious.  Serves a shock of flavor to the taste buds. After that first sip, your mouth is coated with a film of the stuff. Bitter chocolate, fresh java and tons of bittersweet loveliness. I've enjoyed this beer at many ages and am convinced that it is very, very best fresh. With a considerable amount of age, the adjuncts become muddled and indiscernible. But fresh... it's stupendous.

With that ringing endorsement I threw it in the fridge and cracked it open with some burritos tonight.  As I poured the stout into a pint glass it took the appearance of molasses that was mixed in with some motor oil, but in a delicious way.  I took my first sip and literally said, ""WOW!"" to my wife, who could care less. I haven't been WOW'd by a beer in a while. The second sip brought me a taste of chocolate followed quickly by a slightly bitter coffee flavor. I couldn't taste any oatmeal in the brew, but I'm perfectly OK with that.  The smell and mouthfeel was typical of a stout. In those two aspects it reminded me of Murphy's.  If you're lucky enough to have a friend hand you one of these just like I did.

Flavors are rich and heavy coffee forward, with smokey and chocolatey undertones that smooth out the bitter characteristics. Extremely smooth and rich in mouth, with a roasted, bitter aftertaste.

S: Loads and loads of freshly brewed, dark roasted coffee grounds and espresso beans, light bittersweet dark chocolate/mocha/jahva, heavily roasted barley.  T: Super rich coffee beans, fresh brewed espresso flavors. Very roasty, malted milk, dark chocolate are there, but the strong coffee is predominant. Theres also a light caramel sweetness that comes through as it warms. Would pair perfect with danish, a breakfast spread, or streudel in the a.m.  M: Lower end of full bodied, its super creamy and slick from the addition of the oats. It is however slightly thinner than I was expecting. I think had the body been a little fuller, this beer would be nealry perfect. Carbonation is soft and light. Drinkability is surprisingly good for a relatively big beer like this as it goes down very smooth. Alcohol is very well hidden, just a slight warmth on the throat as the beer warms but nothing major.  O: Absolutely fantastic, just an incredibly rich, complex and flavorful imperial stout. Warms the soul up and would be perfect for a cold winter night or more fitting, a morning. Sip this over time, as flavors come through as it warms.

1199,11757,Maxwell,4.65,"The beer pours like a browned overcast midnight with a very thin tanned head on top that can leave lovely walls of sticky lacing down the side. In the middle of the skim of head there is a maelstrom of steady bubbles pounding to the surface in order to replenish the slight head, but other than that, nothing of the insides of this beer can be discerned. This beer is dark. The beer has a wonderfully heavy dark roasted coffee smell with hints of dark chocolate and some slight smooth oatmeal rounding out the edges of the smell. The beer’s taste follows suit with the smell, delivering a terrific wallop of dark roast coffee and slight dark chocolate and smooth oatmeal. The middle brings forward the chocolate more, reminiscent of a dark chocolate candy bar. The after taste is a lovely linger of black coffee and a slight sweet bite of chocolate. The mouthfeel begins with very faint pinpricks of carbonation which immediately dissipate to leave the beer velvety smooth and thickly chewy on the tongue, it leaves the mouth fat with drizzling saliva that wants more, and the roasty dry reverberations that you get after drinking coffee. Overall, this is a tremendous representation of the imperial stout, and a phenomenal drink to have for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert. It masks its alcohol wonderfully, only leaving a hint of it in the warming that it gives the stomach. This beer could practically serve as a meal in and of itself.

It did have a half finger tan color head that disappeared quickly to leave what looks like a glass of flat cola.  Smell: Coffee, coffee and more coffee! Love the coffee smell on this one. Actually don't pick up too much else except for some bitter chocolate and malty notes.  Taste: Well the year has not faded the coffee at all. I get a strong coffee taste with the chocolate too. Vanilla notes and a roasted nut quality come through. This beer NEVER disappoints me!  Mouthfeel: Silky comes to mind first. It just glides down with each sip and is so very easy to drink. Not viscous but not thin either. Seems perfect IMO.  Overall: Like I said this beer is never a let down. I picked up some extras last year and glad I did because I love this beer.

Taste doesn't quite live up to the nose, but goes hard on the coffee and chocolate, with just wisps of licorice. End is a bit boozy, with a fairly substantial bitterness.

Chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla wafers, toasted nuts. Toward the very end, freshly ground sumatra coffee beans and condensed milk interplay.

Tastes: as the nose insists. there is mellow hop bite through the beautiful abundance of chocolate malts and a generous helping of some flavorful coffee.  Mouthfeel: I absolutely enjoy this beer. at a touch above 8% there is little burn, in fact the smooth milky chocolate notes are quite enjoyable and comforting.  Overall: I picked up a few packs when it was in season last year and was curious if it changed much with time. I didn't notice to much of a change at all besides a little bit of the coffee faded but still very enjoyable.

1199,11757,kagent777,4.37,"12 oz bottle courtesy of a trade with Sonofalime. Thanks! Poured into my beer goblet.  Appearance:Very dark brown, almost black beer with a whisp of a head that leaves a touch of lacing as I drink.  Smell: The nose has roasted grains along with bakers chocolate and old coffee grounds. A hint of alcohol as well.  Taste: Roastiness all along the way. The chocolate kicks in in the middle with the coffee bringing up the rear. Intense bitterness in the finish. Char along with some dried fruit make a bit of an appearance. The flavors are all tamed with a touch of sweetness that keeps this from being dominated by bitterness. The alcohol is well hidden for 8.3 ABV.  Mouthfeel: The body is very full and creamy, very nice. The carbonation is also on the higher side  Overall: A great example of a chocolate/coffee stout.

Slight sense of malt, and certainly has a breakfast feel to it.  M. Smooth, very nice as I let it warm after pouring for over an hour. Somewhat of a bitter aftertaste.  O. Love this beer.

I immediately smelled roasted malt and chocolate and they complement each other flawlessly.  T - just like the smell; roasted malt and chocolate and a coffee-like taste as well accompanies those two flavors...  M - no overpowering alcoholic presence or any other intimidating feel, its balanced very well and tastes amazing while leaving a mocha aftertaste.  O - Glorious...I wasnt prepared for it to taste this good honestly..I had gotten this from a friend in New York and put off trying it for so long that I actually forgot about it at one point. This is just what I needed tonight despite being a ""breakfast stout"" but who's complaining? This is what I think a stout should taste like or be compared to. Its so well balanced and its taste even made my roommate (who dislikes beer) appreciate it and want more....but tonight Im not sharing.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The taste is heavy coffee with just a tinge of hop bitterness hidden behind notes of chocolate and a chewy oatmeal mouthfeel. This is a damn good stout. Very consistent, but in my opinion a little too strong on the coffee end. I'd definitely rank it high on the list though. I'm very glad I got a chance to try it out.

Head drops to a flimsy cap and collar after a minute or two. Relatively clear, but dark.  Smell: Oats, burnt malts, roasty sweet. A touch of char. Fresh brewed coffee and a huge layer of bitter chocolate. Some sweeter chocolate notes. Super sweet, but the roasted burnt Malta counter it. Almost no hops to be found. It's an homage to the malt and it never lets up. A bit of fudge and brownie batter. Crazy chocolate depth. Hints of espresso.  Taste: Far more roasted. Bitter espresso and coffee bean. Baker's chocolate. Burnt and charred malts in abundance. Touches of oats. Milk chocolate sweetness. Loads of chocolate. Some chocolate malts as well. Slightly overcooked brownie. Burnt cookies. It's like someone torched a baked good and it's so worth it. Lingering sweetness. Roasted in to oblivion.  Mouthfeel: Borders on full, but doesn't quite get there. Solid carbonation adds a creamy note. So smooth and creamy.  Overall: Age doesn't benefit this beer at all. Fresh it's damn near magic. Age pushes the coffee down and ups the roasted malts. Regardless, it's worth drinking and buying every year. It's dessert or breakfast or both. Definitely both.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Intimidating.  S: Immensely beautiful. Smells like a mocha, but heavier on coffee than chocolate. Smooth, sweet, and full of milk (oatmeal, actually) chocolate.  T: Mmm, impressive. I'm not entirely sure the ageing has helped things. It's more mellow, less hoppy, less carbonated. Still, the smoothness ads another dimension to things. Milk chocolate, trace coffee, and smooth, bitter, mocha endtaste.  M: A bit, not flat, but dull. Still, appropriate heaviness.  O: Excellent! Highly recommended.

Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are big malt dark roasted malt aromas along with coffee and chocolate. It's mildly sweet and it comes across as roasty to the nose. The taste follows the nose. There are dark roasted barley malts, coffee, and chocolate as well as oats and dark fruits. The flavors are big, but also well balanced. The 8.3% ABV is well hidden in the taste. I can barely taste the alcohol. The body is full with light carbonation. It is smooth thanks to the oats.

Very thin, brown head on an aggressive pour, dissipated quickly. A picturesque Imperial Stout.  Smell: A huge aroma to this one, coffee is what first hits the nose, balanced with a nice milk chocolate. Some roasted barley astringency noticeable, but it does not come up to much in the aroma. Some dark fruit is there as well in the form of yeast character. One of those beers whose aromas seem to have more texture than just regular air, like your drinking through your nose.  Taste: Like the aroma, but a little more action going on with the roasted malts. The coffee seems to play in with the similar, slightly sweeter characteristics given off by those dark malts. The chocolate on the other hand really reaches around and holds in all those flavors, making way for a bittersweet cherry-like fruitiness and a slightly puckering hop bitterness that come in on the finish. Throughout the sip, you can also pick up some of the oatmeal flavors, light though they are, but still provide some balance by contributing a smooth graininess.  Mouthfeel: A light carbonation sting up front, and a huge robust smoothness that fills the mouth. The oatmeal stout in this beer really shines through in the mouthfeel, even after you swallow the beers presence is not lost.  Overall: An absolutely superb stout, from start to finish this ale is a treat. Huge coffee and chocolate presence define this beer, but what separates it from the others is the superb craftsmanship that the men at founders did with the other characteristics. Any homebrewer can come up with the idea to brew a stout with a bunch of chocolate and coffee, but it takes a truly talented brewer to make it this damn good.

Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, like chocolate pudding, with just a hint of carbonation. Dry finish with a lingering coffee-like bitter aftertaste.  Overall, this is an amazing beer. The first beers I enjoyed were stouts and it's long been my favorite style. This is the best regular drinker I've had. As great as many Russian Imperial Stouts are, they're not something I'm going to drink on a regular basis. Others may be more complex, or with more alcohol, or have something else that makes them a little better, but Founders Breakfast Stout has a great balance.

The foam goes away quickly and leaves a really nice scum.  The smell is amazing. I get a bunch of cocoa and coffee roast. I really enjoy breathing this in. The bouquet is very rich.  The flavor is equally rich. It has a really good coffee taste. I like the chocolate notes in the background. The malt and hops really balance it all out.  This beer is amazing.

Body is extremely dark brown, practically black. Periodic swirling is required to keep a decent crown going. Spotty lacing.  S- Out the neck, it smells of roasted coffee and chocolate and a little sweet. Once poured, coffee and a little boozy, can't really get any chocolate. Some burnt notes towards the end of the warm glass.  T- Coffee dominates. Some dark roasted grains and a little chocolate. Slightly boozy. Finish is slightly sweet but slowly dries out into a nice roastiness. Coffee and roast linger on the palate, maybe even a slight toastiness. As it warms some more cocoa notes emerge as well as some burnt notes.  M- Medium body. Medium carbonation. Attempts to coat the mouth but not quite as much as I'd like. Not quite as creamy and full as I prefer in the style.  O- I've sat on this bottle for a few months now in hopes that the coffee would mellow and allow the chocolate and other flavors to emerge into a more prominent role. The coffee has mellowed slightly but nothing else has really came forward. I'll crack another one at the 1 year mark.

1199,11757,mtlasley,4.2,"Appearance: A black thickness pours from the bottle to glass and almost took on a velvet quality filling my tulip. There's a small finger head of deep beige that disappears as quickly as it bubbles up. The beer is black as night and incredibly ""solid"" looking. The lacing here slides down the sides of the glass with a slow smugness giving the beer real legs. It stick solidly to the glass. Smell: The first thing that hits the olfactory is the coffee and it sets in nicely. There's a powerful smokiness to the java scent. It's rich, it's heavy, it's bad ass. There's a creamy sweetness lurking in the background that has a strong caramel character. The oats here help impart the strong sweetness and that helps carry the bitter coffee. Rick dark chocolate and roasty smokiness close the smell. Mouthfeel: Breakfast Stout is rich and thick without being overbearing. It lays on the tongue slighty but the carbonation still makes it light. It's delightful. There's a creaminess here that reminds me of Left Hand Milk Stout. The ""Imperial"" really shines here. Taste: The top here is dominated by coffee with a thick dark chocolate backing. The pair play well together to produce a sublimely rich bitterness. As it passes the center of the mouth, a creamy oatmeal starts to peek out with a caramel malt backing it up. The transfer from the front to the center of the mouth is quite abrupt and this beer requires a little study to get everything out of it. As you finish, roasty caramel, malt and dark chocolate come together to compliment each other quite nicely. The oatmeal really stands tall here too. The whole tasting experience has a deep smokiness from the coffee that holds the beer together well. Overall: This beer deserves the praise it recieves. Everything from the coffee, oatmeal and chocolate to the malt, carbonation and velvety thickness come together to make for an incredibly drinkable beer. Founder's has really outdone themselves here.

The beer pours a blackish brown color with good head retention and lacing. The nose on this beer is really just incredible, as I get a huge, intense blast of coffee grounds, vanilla and dark chocolate. The flavor profile replicates the nose, though once again the coffee flavor really dominates here. Also, on the nitro, I thought the hoppy bitterness was toned down a bit more than normal, and mouthfeel was a bit smoother. Finish was very long, with a lovely wash of coffee and chocolate. The beer comes across as no more than moderately sweet, and was very smooth on the palate. Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, and really seemed no more than an after thought.

Cocoa coloured head, decent retention, lots of lacing. Looks terrific. Enjoyed with a piece of 70% dark chocolate.  I actually just finished a bag of Kona coffee, and I have to say, that is what I smelled, along with dark chocolate and chocolate malt. Very invigorating - would that I could wake up in the morning to a brew like this.  The coffee flavor is very rich and bitter, there's a sweet chocolate malt character, and mild hopped bitterness to the finish, but the bitterness tended to take over the brew. Don't get me wrong, the coffee and chocolate flavors are delightful and work brilliantly with the brew, but I was expecting a bit more depth. Again, I cannot stress this enough - this was a damned tasty brew.  Rich, silky, very smooth, great mouthfeel. A pleasure to sip and ponder.  Glad to finally get a chance to enjoy this.

Ground coffee bean flavor is present, but in the background. I really need to get a fresh bottle of this. I love the light fruitiness that the yeast contributes to the beer. It blends really well with the acidity of the coffee. Finish is long and dry with cocoa powder, grassy hops, roasty grain husks, and tangy coffee grounds. Just a hint of fruity esters in the aftertaste.  M- Full bodied, chewy, moderate carbonation, with a long dry, tangy, fruity finish.  O- I would love to try this beer fresh. With some age, it's got a nice complexity between the chocolate malt, roasted grains, tangy coffee grounds, and fruity esters. Everything comes together in a complimentary way. Definitely worth seeking out.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Firkin-Bunghole,4.58,"10/14/11 bottled date  Appearance - Black, with small dark brown head that receded after 15 seconds.  Smell - Intense chocolate smell (similar to premium dark chocolate). Not picking up any of the coffee smell--probably due to the bottled date.  Taste - Chocolate throughout-drinks exceptionally smooth. Also, pick up on the oats & the slightest bit of vanilla. Alcohol and IBU's were only noticeable after the beer warmed a bit.

The beer is quite cold and so aromas are quite difficult to find. Wisps of coffee, burnt chocolate and lots of nose. I don't smell alcohol at all.  Taste is creamy smooth. It is not sweet chocolate, but the chocolate is there. The coffee is not overpowering which I expected after reading several other reviews. The coffee balances well the chocolate. The finish is all bittering hops.  Mouthfeel is perfect. I like the thinkness of it. It is a malty thick.  Overall, I like this beer better than its cousin KBS. I realize that will have me stoned on this site, but the KBS was thin and overly oaky while this balances more flavors with the malty thickness I expect from a big stout. Delicious.

Roasted coffee beans, milk chocolate, and oats which give the beer a full texture.  O - I've aged this beer for up to a year in the past, but that's probably because I've never had it this fresh.

A fine layer of head is retained throughout, and an all around beautiful beer.  Smell: Rich coffee, hint of chocolate, and a robust smokiness make up a nose that you must smell for yourself to get the full effect. Words can't do it justice.

As the beer warms, the chocolate begins to pull through more, and all the while I'm thinking ""why didn't I have this for breakfast this morning?""  Mouthfeel: Velvety smooth, very thick, rich, luscious mouthfeel. Truly a regal feel to the beer that is absolutely outstanding.  Overall: A superb beer that is worth going out of your way for. Probably my favorite seasonal release of all time. An excellent beer that will not disappoint.

Mocha foam slowly arises at the top of the glass and just as slowly retreats. Even the edges of the glass give off a slight ruby hue just to make it interesting  S- black coffee, dark chocolate, and stong ties to the oatmeal flavors mentioned on the bottle. What's missing? The alcohol is hidden and I am totally ok with that (although it is definitely present at 8.3%)! This a true cup of joe! Chocolate shines through more evident that a coffee bender, but the oatmeal flavors are more evident than a wake n bake. Good scent profile!  T- the dark chocolate, coffee taste, and oatmeal are more in sync than I have ever experienced before. All three flavors are presented simultaneously making for an excellent cup of coffee taste. Breakfast stout does not have the overwhelming sweetness that you can usually find out there. They just have a good of coffee brew that is absolutely amazing  M- great carbonation and layering of flavor all over. The feel is spot on for a flavorful coffee brew  O- Founders, you continue to be who I thought you are. This was my first breakfast stout and I am so fixated on this that I can't wait to buy cases of this stuff!

1199,11757,paulginva,4.52,"APPEARANCE: This beer, poured from a tap into a pint glass, produced a gratifying dark tan creamy 1/2"" head that dissipated slowly leaving virtually no head lacing. Carbonation was soft in a nearly opaque dark brown body.  AROMA: A dazzling, fragrant, heavy roasted black coffee aroma with moderate burnt oatmeal and dark chocolate, some light floral hops, a hint of dark fruits of some sort (cherry?) and a moderate alcohol profile.  TASTE: A stronger dark cherry taste than I thought there would be on the first sip. Moderate espresso flavor together with a bit heavier dark chocolate tang than I had anticipated. There is a sweetness here that balances out the coffee bitterness well. A light bit of floral hops and alcohol warmth comes through toward the end. This is a complex, delightful taste profile. Everything works together in a way that I was a little surprised at. It's almost like a symphony of flavors playing in your mouth.  MOUTHFEEL: This beer had a full body with a thick texture, soft carbonation and thin body lacing that dissipated slowly. The initial flavor was a moderate coffee bitterness together with a little sweetness, with a lightly bitter finish that lasted for a moderate length of time.  DRINKABILITY: This is definitely a sipping beer. Because of the alcohol content, I'd recommend only two or three in an evening unless you have a designated driver handy. It is a memorable beer with a definitely ""wow"" factor. The price point on it -- for the quality of the brew -- is exceptional. I plan on having this one again and again.

M - Full bodied smooth and creamy mouthfeel, with just enough carbonation to excite the tongue. Flavors persist in the mouth for quite a long time.  O - This is an outstanding stout, without unnecessary hopiness. The bitters are offset perfectly with the full warmth of the oats. The coffee and chocolate flavors co-mingle nicely without becoming a cloying mocha. This is the champion of breakfast stouts.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,PorterLambic,4.45,"Pours as near black as is possible. Small, espresso-colored, creamy head lasts a lot longer than I every expected though as just a thick film. Decent lacing though not extensive. Smell is toasted malt, dark chocolate, wet cardboard, hints of molasses and coffee. Taste is richer with the aforementioned toasted, almost burnt, malts, coffee, bittersweet chocolate with a hint of spice. Fairly rich and smooth with a slightly drying, astringent-y finish. Warming from tongue to stomach. And it only gets better as it warms. Full-bodied with a crisp, tight effervescence.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,dwesh,4.85,"Appearance: Pours an opaque black out of the bottle. Smallish tan colored head which doesn't hang around for long.  Aroma: Initial impression is strongly coffee with subtle hints of chocolate apparent. The chocolate notes become more pronounced as this one warms.  Taste: Complex. Following the smell, coffee is the first flavor noticed on the tongue. This is followed up with hints of dark chocolate in the aftertaste. The oats provide a nice counterpoint to the coffee/chocolate flavors. All wrapped up by a pleasant overall bitterness. The flavors really become more pronounced as the beer has a chance to warm.  Mouth feel: Smooth. Creamy. Decadence in a bottle.  Overall: This is the best stout I have come across so far. It is one of the most satisfying beers I have had the privilege to try in a long time. I wish this was available year round. Do yourself a favor, try this beer if at all possible.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,MCDuhamel,4.7,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle at cellar temp into a tulip. A fairly small, tan head collapses to an espresso-like crema on top of a completely black, opaque liquid. The somewhat restrained nose is of roasted cocoa. Flavors explode on the tongue: coffee, cocoa, and roasted grain, supported by a nice bitterness that does not distract from the smooth chocolate notes. The finish is simultaneously dry and sweet. There is no cloying character; the mouthfeel, while full, does not coat. This is an absolutely outstanding stout, and very little could be done to improve it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BMMillsy,4.04,"Hands down, my favorite stout out there. Excellent both in the bottle and on tap. Deep black, with mocha head. Strong coffee, with some slight chocolate hints, then more earthy spicy coffee. Goes down easy. While many imperial stouts come off syrupy, this is incredibly drinkable and smooth. Perfect carbonation and a nice bitterness that goes well with the roasty flavor here, massive coffee, and the perfect amount of chocolate sweetness. Not overly sweet. Honestly, I find this to be better than the heralded KBS by a good margin. Excellent beer! (4.74)  Rerating this now a while later. 2015 bottle, and something seems wrong here. Rather thing, very little of the big rich chocolate and coffee flavors I had come to love in this beer. Getting a downgrade, as this isn't worth buying ever again if it stays like this. Still meeting in the middle. (This rating a 3.25).",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Celt44,4.8,Finally broke the bank and picked up a four-pack of this highly touted brew - at $12.99 not an easy buy.  Appearance - poured a pitch silky black - almost like liquid dark chocolate. Nice frothy brown head with lacing throughout. Great looking brew.  Aroma - Cocoa - Chocolate - Espresso - nice...  Taste - Chocolately-sweet strong coffee...oatmeal hints hit toward the end. Awesome.  Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth - but thickness conveys itself if you keep it there long enough. Slight burn for good measure.  My first taste of Founders brews. This is an awesome beer for the developed palate. Nice and a keeper. Now I know what all the hype was about.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,JohnnyHopps,4.58,"I have enjoyed Breakfast Stout many times, including on tap at Founders. When I was not much of a stout drinker, I did not have as much appreciation for this beer as I do now. Every autumn, I horde a few 4 packs to get me through the year. Few beers are better on a cold winter night.  The pitch black of this stout is an impressive sight. Producing a slight tan head after being poured, it is almost too pretty to drink. The thickness of the stout borders on oil as it is difficult to see light through a glass. The thickness also leaves a generous coat on the tongue. Initially, the stout produces a flavor of strong coffee bitterness with dark chocolate yielding to hints of bread and malt. The chocolate becomes slightly sweeter in the aftertaste. If I were to offer one criticism to Breakfast Stout, I would love to taste a little more sweetness hidden in the aftertaste. It would be close to perfect at that point.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Arborescence,4.79,"Appearance: Black, came to the table with remains of a chocolate coloured head, but clearly the head doesn't last.  Aroma: Strong but delicate mixture of roasted coffee aromas; proper dark chocolate!  Taste: Earthy, dark roasted coffee; the hops kick in a little bit afterwards and create some bitterness, especially mixed with the bitterness of the coffee. It's demanding, but surprisingly easy to drink! The chocolate flavours are not predominant, but they do come through a little bit -- the impression is of very, very dark, bitter chocolate. Exquisite!  Mouthfeel: The flaked oats give this stout a nice smoothness to compensate for the heavyish body, very nice mouthfeel.  Overall: Excellent stout, brave mixture of strong coffee flavours, but the beer has such a strong body anyway that the roasted coffee does not dominate too much, and the characteristics of the stout are well balanced. I'm not sure if I'd have this for breakfast, but I'd happily drink it all day long!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Tasting notes follow:  A: Dark, deep black with a dark broen/black foam head S: Chocalates, more chocolate, coffee, malts and some more chocolate T: Really smooth, milk chocolate, thick and creamy M: Great! Tastes really nice..starts with bits of coffee and chocolate and ends with a smooth malty milky flavor... O: An exquisite stout! So glad the local beer store has this brew available in quantity!  I have already stocked 2 cases of this beers stocked for future reference!. One of my favorites.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Treyliff,4.77,"Finally was able to find this one so I picked up 8 bottles. My first sampling of Founders.  A- pours a pitch black, almost purple with zero light coming through on this one. About a two inch dark tan fizzy head that shrinks to skim the surface with very little lacing down the side.  S- robust coffee up front, followed by milk chocolate chocolate. Undertone by an oat and malty backbone. Also a smokiness coming through.  T- intense smoky coffee comes through immediately, followed by a bitter-sweet chocolate, balanced out by the oatiness backbone. Sweet malts and finishes just slightly bitter with a coffe and chocolate taste lingering on the palate long after sipping. As the beer warms up, I also pick up a bit of fig and molasses.  M- syrupy, milky, viscous, velvety and smooth. Low carbonation but enough to give it a kick. Heavy bodied, but goes down easily.  O- for me, this one llved up to the hype. Definitely one of the most pronounced flavors I've had on a stout, yet everything balances out perfectly. This is the definition of a sipping beer, the 8.3% alcohol is masked brilliantly. Instantly one of my favorites.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,DocJitsu,4.31,"Pours out of the bottle like used motor oil out of the catch pan when the drain plug's removed. Very dark brown colored opaque viscous liquid. Not much of a head forms, but the one that does is a medium-shade mocha color. Aromas of smoke, coffee, and dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is heavy on the tongue initially, but as it is swallowed, it thins out quite a bit. A lot of olive flavor. Some griddle smokiness. Quite a bit of strong, black coffee. There's a peculiar flavor that I'm not able to put my finger on that emerges late. It's not necessarily an absolutely unique flavor, but it is so misplaced in a beer like this that I can't determine what it is. Smoky olive bitterness at the finish. Pretty good breakfast stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The coffee was noticable right at the begninning but very subtle.  perfect carbonation for a stout and the abv was well hidden. A very drinkable stout, I had no issues going through the whole 4 back upon first trial.  Overall a fantastic beer and worth the hype.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

But the reviews were so good, I had to give it a shot. Then found it at the local store. So far so good.  Drank mostly from a Bottle.  Appearance - pours black, like the sky when you're off in the middle of nowhere like Joshua Tree or Durango. Imagine the sky at midnight with no light pollution. This is like that. Off-White/Champagne colored head, disappears quickly.  Smell - explosive. Absolutely reeks of coffee, chocolate, smells like a cold mocha, and noticeably thick scent  Taste - OH. MY. tangy, milk chocolate and bittersweet chocolate combination, coffee explosions. Its filling but HIGHLY drinkable. First sip is all you need to convince you.  Mouthfeel - fantastic, smooth, good carbonation level, the drinkablity vs the complexity / smoothness of flavors is really unparalleled in my experience. the 8.3% is masked so well you cannot even taste it.

Taste – Tastes even better than it smells. Chocolate, dark roasted coffee and a touch of molasses. Finishes with an oatmeal taste. Don’t drink this too cold – it's much better as it approaches room temp. Delicious!  Mouthfeel – Creamy, well carbonated, and very smooth.

1199,11757,zac16125,4.42,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter Bottled 10/22/2011 Written from notes taken Nov. 2011  A: Pours an opaque black with some browning on the edges when held to light. Gives about ½ fingers width of dark mocha colored head which dissipates down quickly to an outer ring. Leaves slight spotty lacing.  S: Strong bold roast black coffee aroma, some floral hops, a relatively subtle bakers chocolate scent, a hint of dark fruits (maybe cherry), and an astringent component that I can’t particularly place. There are a decent amount of subtleties in the scent but far and away its mainly about the coffee aroma and boy is it strong and delicious.  T: At first sip there is more of a dark fruit presence than I anticipated, along with a strong coffee flavor and some hop bitterness on the back end. The dark chocolate flavor comes out strong too. There is a significant sweetness that balances out well with the strong coffee and bitter character. The black bold roast coffee on the backend is quite delicious and lingers for a while after each sip. As I drink it, the dark fruits and sweetness die down to leave the dominating flavors of black coffee and dark chocolate. A well balanced and relatively complex palate profile that makes for a beer that’s quite good.  M/D: Pretty heavily carbonated (too much for my liking) and a little hot going down, but it has a nice slick mouth feel and full body. The alcohol is noticeable but doesn’t interfere with the flavor profile. Even with the heat and relatively heavy carbonation it still remains pretty easy to drink and I could certainly have more than 1. This beer is fresh out of the brewery, less than 2 weeks. I’m going to sit on a couple bottles and see if it takes off the heat and smooths it out.  O: Overall a great beer with a wonderful aroma and good strong flavor profile. Its not my favorite stout, but its certainly one of the better ones I’ve had. I definitely recommend.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,phisigben,4.42,"Pours black with a nice dark mocha colored head that leaves quickly but leaves a nice ring of lacing. Coffee smell hits you in the face this is like a cold cup of coffee, the funny thing is I dont like coffee (hot drink) but I love the flavor and smell besides the coffee there is a little chocolate but its very hard to pick up and a slight sweetness form the malt. The taste is great nice punch of coffee like in the nose but the chocolate comes through a lot more and a nice sweetness from the malt to balance out the roasted coffee flavor. It coats my mouth very well but not as viscous as other beers in this style, very little carbonation but again that is very similar to others in this style. Overall this is a great coffee beer if you don't like coffee flavor you will hate this beer. When this beer comes out I always buy at least 2-3 four packs of this every year.

1199,11757,brystmar,4.55,"Re-reviewing this 1.5 years later with a more refined palate. Bottled 10/22/2011, and opened for a head-to-head comparison with Terrapin Wake-n-Bake.  Pours a viscous, jet black in my pint glass. More accurately, it ""glugged"" out of the bottle with an almost Zhukov-like pour consistency. Plenty of tan head, good retention, strong lace.  Huge aroma of freshly roasted coffee beans mingles with bittersweet chocolate. Smells just like ordering a coffee ""black"" with a touch of malty sweetness lurking closely behind. By contrast, the Terrapin's coffee aroma was reminiscent of a ""blonde"" roast with plenty of caramel & bittersweet chocolate alongside.  Deep, roasted coffee & chocolate blend perfectly with malty sweetness and traces of caramel, leaving a bittersweet coffee aftertaste behind in my throat. Perfect amount of alcoholic warmth lingers alongside the bitterness. FBS' taste is smooth and refined, showcasing an impressively crafted flavor profile that few can duplicate. For an inexpensive, off-the-shelf stout, it doesn't get better than this.  Body is another area where Breakfast Stout truly shines: oatmeal does wonders for this beer's mouthfeel. Huge, creamy, and smooth with minimal interference from carbonation. WnB feels medium-bodied by comparison.  All in all, Founders Breakfast Stout remains a home-run in my book. The Terrapin is a worthy adversary, but falls short of being considered its peer. FBS is simply on another level of craftsmanship (brewmanship?) when push comes to shove. And at $12.50 for a 4-pack (in NYC -- gets as cheap as $8 in the midwest!), Breakfast Stout is unquestionably one of the best values in beer today.

Head was about 1/2 an inch of chestnut colored head. Although head did not last long, ended up with light ring around the glass. Head laced beautifully from start to finish all the way down the glass.  S- Very very upfront coffee smell, with hints of bittersweet chocolate. Reminded me a very good espresso. You could smell hints of oats and and an almost cream smell. Very pleasant.  T- Wow!! Anyone who's had this beer will agree that coffee and toffee hits you from the start.

Rich, creamy, and very exciting to taste.  M- Full-bodied, rich, creamy, and lingers after its gone. Begging you to taste just a little more. Not over bearing like other stouts I've had, and very pleasing to the mouth  O- A world class stout, no other way to say it. All around this is one of my favorite beers, and if your a stout fan grab one please. Bottle was equally as good, please please drink out of a tulip glass to really enjoy this beer. I also recommend around a 55 degrees to really enjoy this beer. If its your first time a little colder wouldn't hurt.

1199,11757,Darkmagus82,4.52,"Poured from bottle into snifter  Appearance – Pours a deep-deep brown, if not black, color with little to no light seeping through the brew. There was a thin brown had that formed and lasted about 1 min before fading to give some nice lacing.  Smell – Sweet chocolate is heavy in the nose. This mixes in with a bit of roasted coffee and an ever so slight bit of vanilla toward the middle of the taste. While the chocolate is there throughout, it changes it aroma ever so slightly as it mixed with other aromas. Initially in the nose it is of sweet chocolate, but toward the end it becomes more bitter cocoa with an ever so slight boozy finish. Very nice.  Taste –At first a bit of roasted bitter coffee and dark chocolate are detected. A nice oatmeal backbone then starts to mix with a little bit of sweet vanilla. This seems to sweeten the dark chocolate/cocoa flavor bringing it more to the realm of a sweet chocolate flavor. The bitter is not lost, however, and at the end of the taste sweet and bitter chocolate seem to mingle with a light alcohol flavor.  Mouthfeel – If there is any disappointing point to this beer, it would be that the mouthfeel (which really isn’t disappointing) which doesn’t live up to the taste, aroma, or look. It’s creamy but could actually use an ever so slight boost in creaminess; a little more tongue clinging smooth. The carbonation seems an ever so bit too much also. It is a nice feel overall, but in comparison to its other attributes (taste, smell and look) it is a bit weak.  Overall – This is a very nice beer to sit back with and sip. The complexity of aroma and flavor are truly astounding, both of which transition very nicely.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BradtheGreat7,4.88,"12 oz stubby Founders style brown bottle with a very interesting and catchy label with maybe the best and most talked about names for a stout in the world. Poured into a nonic style imperial pint glass.  A - black as a moonless night. Small hints of brown find their way on the bottom edges in the light. An even darker brown syrupy molasses like effect in the head from the body slipping back down the glass. I've noticed that every dark founders beer is able to accomplish this due to the thickness they provide. The tan head is fluffy and does indeed appear cinnamon in color. Amazing retention and lasted the entire time. Produces some fine lace with plenty of stickiness.  S - rich and hearty aroma. Roasted black coffee beans. Bitter dark chocolate with a sweet cocoa/expresso character along with a touch of vanilla present but deep within.  T - wow. is a word to describe it. Roasted malts. Dark chocolate provide some bitterness with hearty oats within. Sweetness of vanilla, faint cream, and roasted cocoa all are down deep. Bold coffee flavors are roasty and rock every inch of the mouth. Finish is a rich and smooth roastiness that lingers around in a very nice manner.  M - full bodied and thick as hell. The thickness makes for a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is present, but the body and flavor are too damn good to notice any at all.  O - a true world class stout. I've yet to have the KBS or CBS, so as of now this is the best stout I've ever had. Founders brew with so much class and quality and this dandy of a brew speaks for itself. I loved everything it had to offer. I've long awaited the Breakfast Stout from Founders and nothing disappointed. It deserves the hype it gets and if anything is underrated.

1199,11757,SLeffler27,3.78,"A thick, creamy, dark chestnut head reaches half an inch before quickly dropping out. The stout is black with dark brown highlights and leaves a film on the Dogfish Head snifter while rings of fine lace mark progress.  The aroma of roasted malt borders on a burnt quality with baker’s chocolate immediately following. This one is a bit earthy and all in all akin to an oatmeal stout. Coffee aromas come out with warmth and, unfortunately, so does a soapy aroma.  The flavor profile initially follows the nose then leans towards coffee and chocolate. Overall, the balance between sweet and bitter is intact until the long finish emphasizes bitterness.  This offering from Founders is creamy smooth again, similar to an oatmeal stout, with full body, light carbonation and no hint of alcohol.  A fine beer with stew or chili, however, it is best at cooler temperatures and not suitable as a sipping beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Lawl3ss,4.13,"Lightly chilled 12 oz. stubby poured into a tulip pint. Bottling date 11.19.11.  Look- Lives up to the hype so far. Completely opaque with brilliant ruby cordial glints around the edges. Starts off with two-and-a-half fingers of dense chocolate milk colored head that leaves lace almost as opaque as the beer, despite settling fairly quickly. If it's half as hearty as it looks, this is going to be a treat.  Smell- Not as bold as I figured it would be, but rich nonetheless and tastefully done. Big dose of mocha and fresh ground espresso beans, obviously, along with a solid showing of caramel and a hint of granola-like toasty/roasty grains, but nothing I wasn't expecting. Smells fairly sweet.  Taste- Tastes like I like my coffee, you'd hardly know it was beer. Dark, bitter chocolate and you guessed it... black coffee. The bitterness is just like... black coffee. It's also got a hint of London-style sticky sweetness and touches of lighter roasted oats and barley. Aftertaste is once again coffee, this time coupled with a pinch of peat and a light alcohol burn. There's a bit of woody something buried in there somewhere, but I can't really put my finger on where it pokes its nose out. There are touches of intrigue here and there, but for the most part its like a bullet train of flavor - powerful but one-dimensional. In other words, you know where it ends up as soon as you step on.  Mouthfeel- Mmm-mm. Full and thick, almost sludgy. Light to moderate carbonation. Mild warming on the back end. It really drinks like that uber-caffeinated stuff that you get out of the bottom of the coffee pot after it's been on ""warm"" all day... well, that's my thing and so is this. Hearty. One's probably enough, but that's as it should be.  Overall- These guys really know what they were going for, and did it. It might be sacrilege, but I was hoping for something a bit more complex. It's a big beer, and well balanced, but in the end it's about what you would expect when you consider the ingredients. Double up the well-above-standard recipe, throw in some coffee and cocoa, and voila! I'm big into stouts, but this had little of the complex spicy, woody, and dark fruit character I've seen in some of my favorites. Well worth the $10 I dropped on the four-pack, but not what the hype would lead you to think. As a stand-alone beer, it’s great, but you wouldn’t want more than one or two, and it kills the palate. I don't really see it going with food. I might pick it up once in a while, but it's not going to make my go-to list in the near future.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,falloutsnow,3.52,"Bottles brought back from St. Louis for me by A. Much thanks. Bottled 12/14/2011. Poured into a New Belgium globe glass.  Founders' Breakfast Stout is an intensely coffee-forward double stout that is, in my opinion, unbalanced and overrated. The coffee aroma and taste overwhelms most of what else the beer tries to offer. Further, the coffee isn't a particularly good flavor, anyway, at least compared to what freshly brewed coffee can offer. While I'm glad I was able to finally try this beer, it's clearly not something I think highly of relative to many others. I will probably not seek this out again.  The pour produces a 1cm tall head of dark tan to light brown foam, mostly composed of small bubbles, though there are a few large, yielding a very dense appearance. Head fades over a minute or two to a thin ring around the glass with a very fine membrane of bubbles atop the body. Leaves some excellent lacing, which is renewed and augmented with each swirl. Body is an impenetrable dark brown or black, with the slightest highlight of lighter brown when held to the lights. I can't make out anything going on inside the beer, so no idea what carbonation is like. An excellent looking beer.  The dominant aroma is coffee, and not particularly good, fresh coffee, but day-old, stale coffee and coffee grounds. I'm kind of amazed that Founders got Sumatra coffee to come across as mediocre. The other major scent is heavily roasted malt, bordering on char or ash. As I pointed out to a friend, ""kind of like someone stuck a burnt-out cigarette in your beer."" I do not find this a particularly enjoyable-smelling beer, and think those of you who can ""smell the oats"" or other such nonsense, are imaging things. This isn't the aroma of a stout, it's more the aroma of a bad, old cup of coffee. Very little complexity or depth even.  Taste fairs better than aroma, with coffee notes hitting the front of the tongue, then progressing to some chocolate and roasted malt notes mixed in with the coffee flavors. Ends with continued bitterness, cacoa nibs, coffee, and ethanol. Lingering aftertaste of some bitterness and roasted malt. Again, I don't think the addition of the coffee improved this beer at all: the flavor isn't all that good (again, has an old coffee flavor, which is basically expected because by now the beer contains old coffee), it has depth that is masked by the coffee, and really misses out on other things that stouts can be (a bit of cream flavor, perhaps a bit spicy, etc).  Medium to medium-heavy bodied with a bit of wateriness around the edges. Somewhat surprising, really, given the ethanol and probably malt content of this beer. Carbonation is modest, producing a pleasing, initially crisp, then smooth feel as the beer lingers on the palate. Ethanol is felt in the nosrils and back of palate. Finish is semi-dry.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,anth0ny,4.44,"Deep, dark pour with a very thin cinnamon colored head. Never really seem to get a decent head or lacing from this beer. Anyways, the aroma is just blasting from the glass. It's mostly chocolate and alcohol, with some oatmeal. Smells really nice. Just from the smell you can imagine the creaminess you're about to experience. Tastes like hot cocoa mixed with an oatmeal stout. Delicious. Very smooth and creamy. There is a presence of alcohol, but it seems more present when it's colder. I'm also getting a bitter touch from the hops in the middle, and the aftertaste is a smooth coffee flavor that lingers for a minute. Nice full, creamy body. Low carbonation. You can drink this beer warm or cold. Definitely a must try from Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Produced a dense, acorn-colored head at about 1cm in thickness. Laces the glass with a delicate white sheet of foam.  S: This one threw me off a little. Was expecting a big blast of chocolate and coffee to assualt my olfactory nerve, but instead got a very subtle aroma of burnt toast and yeast.  T: Dark, bitter chocolate upfront, followed by earthy, piney hops in the middle, and finishes with the sharpness of a deep, dark espresso. Slight heat warms the belly with each sip.  M: Smooth and velvety. Perfect carbonation allows this brew to feel lighter than it actually is while maintaining it's viscosity.  O: IMO, this brew is very one-dimensional and lacks complexity.

I always expect a much more full body from the aromas.  Taste is where this beer could improve just a little. Just like the aroma, you get a lot of coffee! The oatmeal gives it a very pleasant smoothness that almost completely hides the alcohol. I really got no chocolate on my palate though. It has a nice bitterness to it, but I would attribute that more to coffee bitterness than chocolate.  Overall, this is one of my favorite seasonal stouts.

Lots of large bubbles remain after most of the head dissipates.  Taste: Mild, sweet coffee, lactose as in a milk stout, mild anise, oats and grains, chocolate, some bitter piney hops mixed in with the alcohol?  Mouthfeel: Medium body. Mildly syrupy. Just a bit of drying from the coffee flavor. Very little carbonation. A little chalky.  Overall: Delicious, but just a tad too sweet for me.

For me it's best when fresh and coffee forward. As the coffee fades the beer loses some of it's edge, in my opinion.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,tvanr,4.25,"Split a bottle with my dad, surprisingly he enjoyed this beer.  Appearance: A thin pour compared to Founders Imperial Stout. Black body with a khaki colored head that lingers. Nice lacing.  Smell: Loads of roasted coffee, bitter chocolate and some toffee.  Taste: Roasted coffee up front followed by some of that bittersweet chocolate. A bit of earthiness probably from the oat flakes.  Mouthfeel: Founders has the recipe for great mouthfeels in all of their stouts. Rich and creamy that leaves a velvety coating.  Overall: Another damn fine beer from Founders. Nuff' said.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S: The nose is big coffee, big chocolate, some roasted malt notes, and a bit of earthiness. If you are into coffee beers, this has the nose you're looking for.  T: The taste follows the nose almost spot on. Huge blasts of coffee, huge blasts of chocolate, some really great roasted and qualities, some burnt toast, and some slight earthiness.  M: Full bodied beer. The carbonation is high for a stout, but this beer is silky and smooth. All of the flavors envelop the palate nicely and linger of just the right amount of time. Drinkability is high for this brew.  O: A fantastic offering from Founders. It's basically the industry standard for coffee stouts.

1199,11757,IPA35,4.55,"Bottled: 10/22/2011  A nearly pitch black beer with a light tan head. Looked very thick.  Big coffee aroma. Wow. Dark chocolate with coffee. Roasted malts come through but they are overpowered by the coffee. A slight sweetness and prehaps the hops. I am not sure if I am going to like this but it smells great. Unfortunatly coffee smells great too but tastes bad.  Oh wow. How do I describe this? Wonderfully complex. The coffee and chocolate dominate the taste and when it sits in your mouth after a few seconds the coffee bitterness rolls in but never becomes too overpowering (this coming from a person who never drinks coffee). It is also quite sweet because of the chocolate. And I do get the oats, I recently had Samuel Smith's oatmeal Stout and I get that same distinct taste from the grain. Slight dark fruits, vanilla and roast. The hops are there, they give a minimal, faint citric, herbal taste on the background. A very balanced beer. The alcohol is hidden.  Quite a thick mouthfeel with rather low carbonation.  Remarkably easy to drink and very good. Worth the price.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Small off white bubbles showed up for about 15 seconds and then subsided. Sitting in my glass for 1 hour coming to a nice temperature  Nose is pure chocolate to me! Rich, bitter dark chocolate. There are hints of coffee and alcohol in the background. I was surprised how little toffee character there was, since brews like this often carry that note.  Taste was really something special. Immediately hit by the heavy chocolate flavor that honestly reminds me of being a kid and having some hot cocoa on a cold day. Transitions to a coffee flavor. Alcohol not absent, but I really like that. Slightest coconut note in there too. Lingering flavor is really nice.  After a long day at the office, a brew with the complexity of this really puts a smile on my face!  Cheers!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,SirWalkAbout,3.7,"Poured a dark black. Nice tan head.  Strong chocolate smell.  Taste is coffee dominated, but it has a sharp bite that lingers. It's a bitter taste imo, and for me, this is why it does not deserve a higher rating. I think there is room to improve.  All our palates are different, and for me, this one is good but not outstanding.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,asabreed,4.53,"12 oz. bottle into a Samuel Smith 12 oz. nonic.  Appearance: As black and opaque as it could be, with a head and retention that won't quit: a dark mocha-color with even darker bubbles in the mix, and big sheets of lacing on the glass. There's not a lot of dissipation here in the least, and it's one of the best-looking versions of an Imperial Stout I've ever seen.  Smell: The first thing that hits the nose is chocolate, and a lot of it, a good amalgam of bitter and sweet chocolate, and a lot of chocolate malt type aromas too, even to the point of what you'd find in, well, a chocolate malt at a good, privately owned ice cream shop. Then the coffee creeps in as it warms, from the black acrid aroma of coffee just into a mug from the pot, to the aroma of a coffee with three creams and three sugars: the balance here is always pretty astounding. And as it warms you can get some of the grain and oats mixing with everything, and whatever hops that are here aren't really in the aroma. Some tar and char comes through when it warms also. With each drop of temperature new combinations start to form.  Taste: What's wild about this beer is the layers that keep changing as the temperature changes. Initially the chocolate and coffee combination works wonders, with a lot of nice char and acridity mixing together with the heavy sense of chocolate, and it becomes less sweet (not that it's all that sweet to begin with, but it's there and present) as it warms. On the back-end there's some nice char and berry and dark fruit flavors that come through also. And the finish is char, acrid coffee, and lingering bitter chocolate, with some flutter of sweetness around for good measure.  Mouthfeel: Beautifully thick all around, with a sense of both creaminess and a velvet-like softness to round everything out. It's certainly a heavy-bodied beer, but there's enough carbonation to get the creaminess out of it so it becomes coating instead of cloying.  Drinkability: I'm thinking of keeping one around for a year or two to see if the char and roasted back-end quality dissipates to a sweeter brew, but I'm not sure I can wait that long, to be honest. I paid $11.99 for the 4-pack, and thankfully, this was the last one. Had there been more, I would've bought them, I mean. And if there had been none, I wouldn't have been too thrilled. So it worked out. This is my first chance finally reviewing it in the bottle, since I haven't found it in a long time and finally recently stumbled upon it, and it seems like nothing has changed. An intense, balanced, beautifully crafted Imperial Stout from one of my favorite breweries. It'll always be a staple for me if I can ever find it enough to make it one.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Dense tan head which good retention and excellent lacing.  S: Freshly brewed dark roast coffee dominates the nose with notes of dark and sweet chocolate. Slight oats and a touch of alcohol as well.  T: Dark roast coffee dominates up front followed by the sweet and bitter chocolates. Slight oats towards the end with the coffee and chocolates blending together for the finish. Deliciously roasty and bitter. The high alcohol is also well hidden as well.  M: Smooth as silk, creamy, and thick. Feels like a stout. Very dirnkable.

Taste / Mouthfeel: Chocolate covered coffee beans followed by espresso, dark chocolate, slight vanilla and charred wood. Extremely smooth, with creamy almost silky mouthfeel. Slight bitterness in the finish. As it warms coffee notes and smokiness become even more pronounced. Alcohol is well hidden, almost non existent.  Overall: Amazing, a coffee lovers dream.

The taste is of a light coffee; not too much bitterness and the mellow oatmeal. There is also a hint of vanilla. Mouthfeel is lowcarb and surprisingly light for something this dark.  Overall, this is the best stout I have ever had and what I always wanted a coffee stout to taste like. Drinkability is extremely high and surprisingly mellow.

1199,11757,fvernon,4.45,"2011 edition. Poured at 55 degrees into a Deschutes tulip; it came out a viscous cinnamon chocolate with a 1/2 inch of cinnamon butter head that left beautiful lacing on the sides of the glass. Aroma of milk chocolate, pumpernickel, and mocha with a hint of chocolate frosting in the background.  The initial sip is thick - more chocolate, a muted coffee, oatmeal, and hops, and a slight burn of licorice at the end on the exhale. It's a delicious combination (and I'm usually not one for licorice), and the back of my throat has a happy heat to it after a minute of coating through sips. There is something slightly coating in the mouthfeel that isn't quite my thing, but I can't place my finger on what it is about it - maybe it's the licorice finish.  Overall this beer, as many know, is superb and sublime - there are a few chocolate/coffee stouts out there that may be more delicious, but not by much, and none with such a drinkable ABV (I'm looking at you, Mokah!).

It left a nice head with good lacing.  It smelled great. Caramel maltiness with a strong coffee overtone.  The first taste was solid. Coffee dominates the palate, but other roasts are present. Then it gets bitter. The bitterness doesn't go away; it just lingers on the back of your tongue. In contrast to every other stout that I've had, it got worse as it got warmer.  The alcohol was relatively present for a beer with only (only?) 8.3 ABV.  If it weren't for the lingering bitterness that left my mouth feeling dirty, this would be a solid brew. But just like every other bitter beer, it gave me a headache and a want for something other than more beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S-Dark roasted coffee, chocolate is evident, and so much more.  T-Heavy dark chocolately heavy malt taste. Long satisfying non bitter, yet hoppy finish. Hops carry the significant malt character really nicely.  M-Thick, yet smooth. Little carbonation. Really enjoyable.  D-Way too high.  O-An outstanding beer. Probably the top stout I've ever had. At over 8% ABV, this is the bomb. Great flavor and mouthfeel.  On 10/25/12: Evaluated a fresh one (8/15/12 or maybe it's 9/15 the first number is tough to read) with one in the cellar (11/14/11) since last year.  A-The newer beer has a little more head, otherwise they look the same. No difference in head retention or lacing.  S-2011:tons of chocolate with a surprising amount of coffee aroma still present 2012: weaker aroma, much less chocolate with more of the coffee in the nose I prefer chocolate so I like the aroma of the year old beer better.  T-2012: A bit green in the taste, not how I remembered last year's version. 2011: A lot more chocolate and coffee in the taste, tastes a lot like how I remember it tasting last year (i.e. it has not faded as much as I'd expect-especially the coffee taste). The big difference is it has gotten a little sweeter. This batch from 2012 seems to be missing quite a bit from last year. It is much earthier tasting (coffee from a different location?). There is also a bit of a meaty roasted beef taste. Strange.  M:2012: This is where I think the biggest difference lies from how 2011 tasted fresh as well as today. The body is quite a bit weaker. 2011: The body and taste has now transformed a bit from a big stout to more of a dubbel where the malt is not only chocolately but also you get some hints of fermented fruit (rum raisin) which was not present fresh. A little cloying but still very drinkable. Starting to take on the moutfeel characteristics of a RIS. Carbonation is comparable for both versions. Alcohol is non-existant for both years.  O-I definitely think this year's first batch of FBS isn't as good as any FBS I had last year. If I was scoring this year's it would be much lower. The taste has too much of a green earthy coffee taste and the body is thin. Anyway, the year old FBS still is quite outstanding. I wondered how it would hold up and it has much better than I expected. I suspect it wouldn't do well for that much longer. But I would trade the rest of the FBS I bought for last year's. I wonder if subsequent batches from this year are tasting the same.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smell - This was the only part about the beer I rated under a 4.5, of course it was a 4, which is still pretty high. Smelled of roasted coffee, coffee beans, etc. I think the coffee smell really overpowered anything else.  Taste - Impressive. A coffee sensation up front, but you can certainly pick up on chocolate in the middle and finish of the drink. Extremely well balanced between the coffee and chocolate. The 8.3 ABV is totally masked.  Mouthfeel - Nice, thick brew. Excellent coating, leaves nothing to be desired  Overall - This is likely one of the best beers I have ever had. To be able to overcome my prejudice against coffee is impressive enough, but the overwhelming manner in which is did so was Jordan-esque.

S: Robust, full bodied coffee aroma.  T: Fantastic combination of coffee and chocolate. Can't say enough about the balance to this beer, just struck a perfect chord.  M: Lingering and a bit chewy, absolutely no carbonation.  With everyone around me fawning over the food, I was having a moment with my beer. That was awesome; I need to find more.

1199,11757,Gatch,4.47,"Finally got my hands on this beer. It's been a few years of hoping to find it but not really searching it out. Picked up a 4-pack from Granite Liquors in Weymouth, MA. Let me say right away, I wish I drank the fourth one that I'm currently reviewing a few weeks ago when I drank the first three with my brother. It was no doubt the greatest beer I'd had to date but now seems a bit too boozy and dark. The balance was lost somehow.  A - Black as a stout can be. Medium-brown head that bubbles into a thick, fluffy layer but fades quickly. No lacing.  S - Dark, boozy fruits mainly. Dark chocolate, roasted malt, and roasted coffee come through. There isn't much until the beer warms toward room temperature. Alcohol is present more than I expected.  T - Dark, bitter chocolate. Dark, roasted malt and coffee & espresso. There's even some oat flavors. You really get all the listed ingredients in this beer. Waiting until this beer warms makes it exponentially better.  M - Smooth with no carbonation. Delicious roasted flavors fill the mouth and cling to the palate. Awesome feel and drinkability for the style and ABV.  My palate may be worn out from all the stouts I've had over the past few weeks but this doesn't feel the same. A few weeks ago, all the flavors were stronger and the body was perfect. And there was no alcohol presence. I thought it deserved all 5's. Oh well, I'm sure I'll have the opportunity to try it again.  EDIT: on-tap it is exceptional! One of the most enjoyable stouts I've ever had!  October 2018: I’ve been craving this beer lately for some reason so I picked up a 12oz bottle. Glad I didn’t get a 4-pack bc I’m still a bit disappointed. It’s great, no doubt, but maybe I was putting it on a pedestal. Flavorful and smooth but just above average to me, not outstanding.  June 2022: paired with some homemade fluffy buttermilk pancakes and lemme tell ya, wow what a beer! Shines as an actual breakfast stout. Top notch flavor. Scores bumped way up.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

So smooth and full of warmth. I have a couple four packs left and cannot wait to enjoy them all. I just cannot believe this beer is mixed so perfect.

Excellent balance between the two smells.  T- Smooth, very dominant in coffee with chocolate definitely there. Masks the alcohol extremely well.  M- Feels like no carbonation, smooth, goes down very easily.  O- One of the best beers I have had. I do not drink coffee, but have heard a lot about this beer and decided to give it a try. Very heavy beer but overall an excellent beer. Not sure I would have more than 1 in a sitting, but well worth having. Probably the best stout I have ever had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

So I poured directly at the bottom and got a thick creamy head which I allowed to settle. The 8.3 was so well hidden by the complex smooth mouth and taste that I ""almost"" missed the alcohol. Over 30 minutes, the outstanding balance shifted from chocolate to chocolate tinged coffee. All the while the oatmeal background made the transition as sooth as silk with a constant mouth throughout. Absolutely loved the head laces on the glass when it was empty.  If you enjoy this type beer don't miss it.

1199,11757,Ghenna,3.52,"Inky color, quickly dissipating milk choco head. A roll in the glass shows that the beer has some serious legs.  Nose is burned malt, coffee, and some dark chocolate.  Taste is basically the same. Lots of bitterness- black coffee, burned malt. A little unpleasant truth be told- just too much for me. A bit thick in terms of MF, which suits the style.  Seeing the 98 and 100 lingering atop the reviews page for this beer makes it a little bit daunting for me to be completly honest and not pad my opinion. That said, this is just too much of a roasty bomb for me, way too excessive with the roast sourced bitterness/astringency. Meh.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,TrappistJohnMD,4.97,Extremely dark (almost black) with a tan head. Not a very thick head and dissipates pretty quickly in my snifter. The smell is of bitter-sweet chocolate and coffee. Taste is all rich bitter-sweet chocolate with perfect bitter finish that blends well. This is like a liquid form of the cooking chocolate my mom kept around the house 30 years ago when I was a kid. Good carbonation and fun to swirl and sip. This is a complex brew that seems to get better and better as you drink it. I suppose more complexity comes out as it warms up. This brew is perfect for sitting around a campfire and talking with friends or family. Overall this stuff is fantastic and I understand what the hype is about now. Will definitely buy again.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,TheDinger,4.62,"Had to travel to Asheville to score this, as Founders is not sold here in SC. And let me say, it was worth the trip. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beautiful jet black with a bold 2 finger tan head that stuck around for a bit with good lacing. Smell is huge coffee, roasted malts, figs, toffee and perhaps some chocolate. Taste follows the nose, but what was surprising was the balance and complex taste. Starts off coffee and then the chocolate hits with the hops and malts. Sweet but bold on the finish and just difficult to put down. Excellent sipping beer on a cold night. Breakfast Stout is the perfect name for this. Feel is thick and creamy with good carbonation. Silky and pleasant on the tongue. Overall- Top notch for the style and my favorite to date. Complex and full with excellet taste and smell. Huge coffee and mocca with perfect balance.

1199,11757,otto251068,4.36,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Westmalle chalice. 08/15/11 printed on the bottle neck making this beer four and a half months old.  Appearance: It pours an extremely dark brown, bordering black, but when held up to the light the chestnut brown color becomes more evident. The head takes some coaxing (a very hard pour) to make itself present, but a half finger's worth of head is a nice reward. The head itself is a nice light brown, dark tan color. The bubbles are very densely packed with a few larger bubbles hovering in the middle. It fades quickly to a ring that hugs the glass and a few splotches.  Smell: Sharp, freshly brewed coffee. By sharp I mean lively, full, energetic, active, or any other word opposite of ""dull."" This beer's coffee aroma completely takes over. Simply stunning. As it warms some bittersweet chocolate comes out.  Taste: Tastes just like it smells. The coffee is obviously very present. The coffee flavor is similar to a very dark roast. Again, the coffee flavor is very lively, bold, not flat at all. The bittersweet chocolate is there as well, making itself more present as the drink warms. There is a bit of bitterness at the end (similar to a cup of coffee), and then a touch of alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Big body, medium carbonation. The consistency is very pleasant. Silky smooth and carbonation level compliments it nicely. The carbonation really jumps starts these flavors. Coffee flavors are great, but are quickly gone after the swallow.  Overall: Very easily drinkable. The coffee flavor is huge, but it's hard to take my time drinking this one. The faint, bitter chocolate provides a great balance. There is so much to love about this beer. World class.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Sachsenfreude,4.36,"appearance; pours an opaque, black motor oil with a brown head. Dissipation is fairly rapid, leaving just enough of a surface film to leave rings of sparce lacing.  smell; definite notes of dark roasted coffee beans and cocoa oils. Very powerful but some resiny hop aromas are powerful enough to hold up against the other ingredients as well. Very nice balance.  taste; upfront bitter burnt coffee beans blend nicely with citrus rind hops. The balance is so very delicate and works nicely to hold back any cloying qualities of the rich chocolate and malt. Coffee flavors are most dominant and the oily, roasted goodness remains on the palate long after drinking with dark chocolate and milk chocolate left on the breath.  mouthfeel; heavy bodied but smooth. Somewhat of an acrid puckering coats the mouth and toungue. Considering the big flavors and high alcohol, this is a surprisingly easy drink, with a very crisp, refreshing, and dry finish that begs to be enjoyed further.  overall; this is a wonderful drink and is worth the price it demands.

A - black, with finger thick khaki head that settles into what looks like a bubbling pancake that's ready to flip.  S - Coffee, coffee, and more coffee. Smells like fresh-ground, dark roasted beans. High quality coffee, too - the ""Don't f'ing 'Jimmy' me, Jules!"" kind.  T - High quality, fresh brewed coffee up front and hangs around. Alcohol is noticeable on the finish. A tart sweetness I can't quite place, but not unenjoyable.Hops play a quick game of Whack-a-Mole, popping in and out. There's a nice sweetness somewhere in there but it's buried by the coffee and alcohol.  M - Light-medium body balanced with medium carbonation. Tingly, tacky finish.  O - Finally got to pop my FBS cherry and glad I did, although with all that coffee presence it's the wrong stout for drinking after midnight like I did.

A - Dark as night with a great half-inch coffee-colored head that hung around forever. S - Well that's just awesome; roasty malts, a hint of coffee (though not much chocolate) and a decent amount of sweetness as well (perhaps that's the chocolate?). T - Just so smooth...sweetness from the malts and a bit of bitter chocolate up front. Bitterness from the coffee and hops comes in mid-palate and dries things out a bit. Not a hint of alcohol in the flavor, though you do feel it after just a few sips. Battle between wanting to drink this quickly and savor each and every sip.

There’s a big cocoa aroma with a thick roastiness to it. Flavors of French roast coffee, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and some dark roast Italian coffee come at me in waves. It’s thick and creamy with a long, lingering finish that just coats the mouth. Seriously fantastic, it’s everything I ask for in an ‘everyday’ stout.

From two feet away I can already smell chocolate and espresso coming out of the glass from the vigorous pour. The intense aroma permeates the glass. The chocolate/espresso tones only get richer as I lean in, and there is bready maltiness to it backing up the aroma.  Gentle bitterness slips into roasted coffee bean flavor as I take the first sip. Coffee and chocolate spin together in this heady concoction, neither one coming forward too much before the other pulls it away. The hop bitterness is the supporting cast, ensuring the decedent flavors don't become cloying or too sweet.  Silky smooth full body is thick on the tongue but isn't sticky on roof of mouth. Heavy when its there, but when it's gone it takes everything with it. Roasted aftertaste flirts with an acrid flavor but hop bitterness comes in to clean it up.  Truly an outstanding beer, knocking the taste and aroma out of the park and delivered in a silky, rich package that makes you want to close your eyes and just savor the moment.

The roasty, alcohol, vanilla notes, but then of course... COFFEE.  T: what a great coffee stout. This is done right. Perfect coffee bitterness, just the right amount of roasted malt and a good alcohol balance. It hits bitter like coffee, warms quickly and then you get all of that flavor, like from your favorite beans. As it leaves, you get a brighter tang and that ale aftertaste.  M: smooth, with perhaps a bit more carbonation than it needs... What I'd give to try this on nitro...  You have a dilemma. Drink it fresh and get all of the coffee, or let it age and get the improved mouth feel. A couple of months doesn't do much to help a coffee stout in my opinion, but I've experienced near complete beer transformation after a year on a coffee stout, so I'll be trying that with a couple of bottles this year.

O: I love this beer and I always enjoy it when I have it. This is easily one of the best stouts I have ever had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,2378GCGTG,4.35,"Poured this 12 oz into a tulip glass at 53 degrees, with a fairly agressive pour  Appearance: 3 inch head with a dark tan/mocha colored creamy head, excellent retention with some lacing  Smell: I smell the alcohol to start but quickly get the coffee, roasted malts, coffee, vanilla and a slightly hoppy finish. The nose is complex and an excellent example of the style  Taste: Choclate, heavy coffee then the roasted malt and grain, peanuts, vanilla and maybe a bit of spice.  Mouthfeel: VERY soft and subtle, almost too soft/thin (but I suppose a breakfast stout should be a bit thinner) to start and then I get a bit of an acerbic taste, likely from the coffee, but it's a bit too much for my liking.  Overall: This is an excellent breakfast stout, a bit heavy on the coffee but other than that well balanced and complex enought to make me want to buy it again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

A little chocolate in the background. Bitter roasted malt aroma.  Taste: Follows the nose. Slightly less coffee and slightly more chocolate than the nose. Very good. Definitely a breakfast stout if I've ever had one!  Mouthfeel: Low carbonation. Fairly smooth. The coffee taste leaves acidic notes in the finish. Makes you feel like you are actually drinking some joe.  Overall: This is just a great beer. A real American classic if I do say so myself. I highly recommend this beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Bob96358Biese,4.85,"My first review ever but this beer was so good I had to say something.  Poured the color of chocolate tar. Used a pilsner glass and the head started thinly. So I poured directly at the bottom and got a thick creamy head which I allowed to settle. The 8.3 was so well hidden by the complex smooth mouth and taste that I ""almost"" missed the alcohol. Over 30 minutes, the outstanding balance shifted from chocolate to chocolate tinged coffee. All the while the oatmeal background made the transition as sooth as silk with a constant mouth throughout. Absolutely loved the head laces on the glass when it was empty.  If you enjoy this type beer don't miss it. Simply among, if not the best of its type I've ever had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T - certainly taste the rich coffee and chocolate flavors, but they are well balanced. Has a very smooth coffee finish. Although I noticed a little bit of alcohol in the smell, it's not present at all in the taste.  M - very smooth and creamy.  O - it was an enjoyable beer. I don't drink many of this style, but this is one I will certainly come back to.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,RedneckBeerz,4.7,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass and the brew produced a dark brown color that light failed to penetrate. A 1/2"" mocha brown head hung around for just a bit and it had nice whipy lacing on the the glass.  The initial smell is heavy (double) chocolate with some minor notes of oats in the background. The flavor follows the nose on the first few sips, but as it begins to warm some the coffee enters the game and the heavy chocolate flavor fades somewhat to produce a well balanced chocolate, coffee, and oat medley. There is a slight dark roasted malt bitterness, perhaps aided by the 60 ibu's of hops, but which ever it is just enough to keep this brew from being to sweet.  Medium mouth feel, in my opinion; not to thin and not to thick.  The alcohol is well hidden, especially for an 8%+ abv. This is a great beer from top to bottom, a definate A+ brew that I'll continue enjoy as long as I can find it and squirrel some away.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,willseph,4.38,"Poured from bottle into a snifter (thanks KickInTheChalice for the snifter!). This gem pours jet black and thick, no head to speak of save for a chestnut brown ring around the glass. Just a little bit of lazy lacing after each sip.  The nose is rich with coffee grinds, dark chocolate, and a hint of booze. This beer smells better the warmer it gets. The first several tastes were all coffee, all the time. But as it warmed, a few more flavors came out, mainly booze and a touch of cream. The last few sips were downright boozy.  Mouthfeel was just ok for me, it was nice and smooth but the carbonation kinda tickles the tongue. Pretty thick and chewy, but not in a bad way. Overall, I thought it was outstanding. Bar none, the best stout I've had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T: I am a beginner at this but I have never had a beer quite like this one. To be honest, I do not like coffee. However, I loved this beer. Its smooth and well balanced. The chocolate/coffee is not overwhelming and is just slightly bitter.  M: This beer is a mouthful. Goes down like silk, very creamy.  O: This beer is a style I have never tried before but I am really glad that I did. I was so sold I think I might even give real coffee another try. Its not an every day beer but I certainly recommend it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S - I didn't catch much of smell, maybe a bit of oatmeal, again not that strong.  T - Taste was a completely different matter all together.

Finishes with some oatmeal and a touch of alchohol.  T- smooth creamy dark chocolate hits the palate at first. Oily coffee bean and robust esspresso is showcased in the midtones that continues long into the aftertaste. Roasty malt and oatmeal gives some great texture and smoothness on the finish with a lingering coating coffee flavor.  MF- viscous smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and good fine carbonation.

Pouring into a FiftyFifty Eclipse snifter, this is pitch black with a 1-2 finger dark tan head that partially retains and leaves an attractive lace on the sides of the glass.  Intense, dark roasted malt aroma. Prominent full city roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate. Charcoal.  Dark roasted, strongly brewed coffee standing tall and mightily on palette. Very swift touch of caramel sweetness. Charcoal-like smokiness lingers long into the dry finish. Subtle blackberry fruitiness.  Medium-full in body, chewy/oily. Moderate-low level of carbonation.

1199,11757,BeerDocT,3.57,"Poured into a chilled pint glass.  -Appearance 3.5: Very little head to speak of. Black, but has a slight red tint around the edges of the glass. What head there was was a vanilla color rather than the khaki I am accustomed to seeing in these dark stouts.  -Smell 4.0: Wow, very nice. Bouquet of dark chocolate and coffee along with a smoky hint of toasted grains.  -Taste 3.5: Fist taste is of a subtle sweet/sour and the middle is strangely dry. The finish is where the meat is on this beer: coffee, hops, bittersweet chocolate and smoked grains. Finish is long and sour and hoppy. Good, but I don't understand why the finish is jammed up with so much flavor and the other aspects are left barren.  -Mouthfeel 3.0: The lack of carbonation was distracting in this brew. More bubbles would have enhanced the taste of different aspects of the beer, notably the beginning and the middle of this beer.  -Overall 3.5: Good stout, but not excellent. I would certainly recommend trying it if you are a stout fan, but it is not one of my favorites.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,TTAmod,4.35,"Finally found some of this around (all the stores around here only order one case and it's gone immediately usually.)  Poured into pint glass.  A: Pours pitch black and develops a small tan head. I poured it maybe a tad too cold and with a tad bit of water in it, which most likely hindered head development.  S: Smells of a nice iced coffee with some chocolate, toffee, and vanilla.  T: Wow. This is what the Sam Adams Black and Brew (which I reviewed earlier) wish it could be. Starts of with a bit of subtle coffee enveloped in a luscious dark chocolate. A bit of roasted malt, coffee, and cream come after that. Finishes slightly bitter. Perfect meld of all flavors. Really amazing.  M: Creamy, but not terribly thick. Has about the consistency of coffee and cream.  O: This is amazing to me. Such a perfectly balanced combination of flavors.

S: Not the strongest smell but a really nice one, sweet and roasty.  T/M: So delicious and creamy. Coffee dominates the flavor up front, with hints of chocolate and malt as well. There's just the slightest touch of bitterness and the finish betrays a hint of the alcohol. This goes down real easy and smooth.  O: A near-perfect stout, with a really big, delicious flavor.

1199,11757,papat444,4.19,"Picked this up on a trip to Philly last year.  Poured from a 12oz. bottle.  Appearance: Very black body, even under the light there is not but blackness. Nice healthy foam the color of dark chocolate milk. Thick and lasts an average amount of time.  Smell: Wow, if i thought others smelled like coffee, this one is in a class of its own. Strong, pleasant coffee mixed with oats and chocolate. Insistent and great.  Taste: Hate to say the old cliché but it tastes like it smells with maybe the intensity dialed down a bit. Chocolate oats, reminiscent of a cross between oatmeal, cocoa chocolate bars and corn flakes. Yeah, there's some coffee also in there :)  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, carbonation a bit higher than i would have liked but still quite pleasant.  Overall: An excellent stout.

1199,11757,mikem0487,3.65,Appearance-This is as black as a stout can get. Very little head formed with minor retention when I poured it into my pint glass. What head there is left from my pour is a light brown. Basically the same color as the labeling on the bottle.  Smell-I get some dark chocolate notes surrounding the pronounced coffee smell. Slight floral hop aroma tries to break out but the coffee dominates.  Taste-At first this beer has a great smooth taste to it. Love the dark chocolate taste that dominates the initial tasting of this beer but than here comes the coffee. The coffee might be just a little to much for my taste. The coffee taste lingers with a slight bitterness for the after taste.  Mouthfeel-Mouthfeel is good for this beer. Smooth and creamy and not to thick for it containing oatmeal. Slightly carbonated which is what I look for in this style of beer.  Overall-My overall impressions of this beer is good and enjoyable. However I am not a huge coffee fan and rarely drink it so that is what is holding me back from really loving this beer. To much coffee for my personal preference.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,mjvos,4.67,"Pours very dark, near black with very little head to it, although what was there stuck around for the ride.  Smells fairly sweet of malts and a good amount of coffee (it's called Breakfast Stout for a reason). After warming a little some more hoppy smells begin to show themselves.  As with the smell the taste is fairly sweet with big malty and roasted flavors with the additional coffee and some chocolate. Again, as it warms the hops show up on the back end with a subtle bitterness that I found really enjoyable.  It is a thick beer that had just the right amount of carbonation and went down smoothly.  Overall, a very high quality stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

It was expensive ($12.99 for a 4-pack), but I knew I'd regret it if I didn't grab it, and I don't, though I don't understand why it's so expensive. Could the ingredients be that much better than what the other guys use? Maybe the Belgian Chocolate or coffee? Maybe the hype?  Pours pretty much jet black with a 2-3 finger head. Nice lacing.  Aroma is malty, sour, a little bit of coffee. Not huge but good.  Tons of roasted barley, chocolate and coffee flavor. It's deep, layered and complex though, not too sweet or bitter. Enough bitterness to balance it, though it could almost use a drop more to balance the sweetness. The flavors linger on the tongue and palate for a long time.  Mouthfeel is big, smooth, syrupy but not heavy if that makes sense. Good amount of carbonation  This beer is definitely hyped, not as much as it's Canadian and Kentuckian cousins, but I was not disappointed. This is one of the best American Stouts (or Imperials Stouts) I've had. It's got everything I look for in the style.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The flavor leaves a good bitter which gives way to a nutty finish that smacks of spiced bread with some slight herbal tones. Alcohol is present but by not means overwhelming.  M - Great carbonation for the style and a nice coating mouthfeel without too much stickiness.  O - A great ICS!

S- Rich, coffee with sweet chocolate undertones, the kind of aroma you would expect in a chocolate, coffee oatmeal stout lol. The aroma is deep though...very, very rich coffee with slight caramel and toffee with a touch of a roasted quality.  T- Dark chocolate takes a front seat. It's a bitter dark chocolate with perhaps some bitterness comming from the hops. Roasted coffee does come through but the bitterness makes it seem more like espresso. Some hop flavor does manage to shine through as well. There is a bit of a grassy hop flavor hidden in there.  M- Perfection. Full bodied with perfect carbonation. So smooth but finishes perfectly bitter from the combo of coffee and hops. Velvety, very smooth, and extremely drinkable for almost 9% alcohol.  O- Really well crafted beer. Very drinkable and all of the flavors are so well balanced. As it warms everything really comes through.

Smells like rich coffee and dark chocolate followed by a little fruitiness. Smokey and sweet  If a mocha milkshake had a baby with beer, this would be it. I would easily pass chocolate cake up for this anytime. So rich, bitter and sweet. Hops are present and compliment the coffee flavor nicely.  One of the nicest mouth feels in a beer I've had!

1199,11757,QuentinCall,3.02,"Appearance is no more remarkable than any other Imperial Stout I've experienced: jet mahogany with an exuberant, oatmeal colored head that quickly fades to a thin blanket of lace. There is certainly coffee in the nose and while it is the defining aspect, alongside it there is a pronounced alcohol note and an aroma somewhat reminiscent of old books: must and wood and wet rot. Taste follows logically - upfront booze and coffee ballasted by roasted and chocolate malts. Unfortunately, it's monochromatic and hampered by a too-prominent alcohol profile. It finishes with an alternative and, ultimately, unwelcome facet of the coffee - bright and acidic and maybe even possessive of an espresso-like grit. With regards to the style, the feel seems thin, lacking the heft to ably support it. Overall, it's a nice, but particularly unexciting, beer. Unfortunately acidic and boozy, lacking the depth of character I've come to believe an Imperial Stout can embody. Nonetheless, you should try it. I honestly feel like you should. All these people can't be wrong can they? My perfectly average 3 rating does'nt nullify the fact that this is a really important beer, a benchmark even, to a significant population.

I had heard that this beer was great, that if you were a coffee drinker you would love it etc. etc. I was really excited to try it because not only do I love coffee but Central Waters Brewhouse Coffee Stout is my highest rated beer on this site. I figured that if anything could top that beer then it was really going to be worth drinking. Like I said, I was good but I was let down a little bit.  Appearance-Like a good stout should look, it was dark and thick looking in the glass with a dark, tan head. Good start.  Smell-Hoped for more hear. I smelled the coffee but it wasn't overpowering.  Taste-Coffee, baking chocolate and malts. Very bitter. I thought I had read that it was a little sweeter. Very good but not something I would replace my morning coffee with. At best, as it warmed, it maybe tasted about the same as the CW coffee stout I mentioned but I don't think it was quite up to that level.  Mouthfeel- Very solid and thick. Probably a better mouthfeel then CW so this was a strong aspect of this beer.  Very good but probably not a top 10 overall beer for me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

A deep, dark roast coffee. I thought Starbucks made this at first. Underlying dark chocolate scent. Hints of sweetness. Overall, just dark, delicious coffee roast.  T- Holy mother of coffee. Exactly how it smells. Coffee roasts all the way through. Hints of dark chocolate. Underlying grainy base is the oatmeal. Finises with a hint of burn from the alcohol content, but masked very well.  M- Very thick and creamy. Smooth going down. A little more carbonation than is necessary, but that is really nit-picky. Perfect weight on the palate for a winter night of sitting around the fire with some friends.  Overall, best beer I've had so far. If you're a strong coffee drinker, you'll love this.

Heavy scents and flavors in the mouth. Bit of a lingering finish. Solid carbonatino, a little high but its nice. Good little stout.  Overall-I like it. Its simple, fun, strong, mellow.

I guess if you are looking for a breakfast stout, coffee is a part of breakfast and this smells like a good coffee.  T: Well, the taste is very similar to the smell. I am not a coffee drinker so I have trouble enjoying this beer. However, if I were a coffee drinker, I think this would be an excellent beer.

The roles reverse in the taste, with roasted coffee flavors up front and a sweet chocolate in the background. Mouthfeel wasn't as full as I expected from the viscous appearance, but still very nice. This is definitely a coffee lover's stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,FattyJLE,4.42,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.  S - Wonderful aroma of coffee and chocolate. Slight hint of alcohol as it warms.  A - Pitch black with a healthy tan head. Delicate, sticky lacing.  T - Dark chocolate and coffee up front. The low hop bitterness definitely tips the balance towards the flavorful malts, but a roasty bitterness evens it out. Surprisingly dry finish with a pleasant lingering chocolaty, coffee aftertaste. As the beer warms to room temperature, alcohol emerges just enough to make its presence known, before being overwhelmed by the flavors already described.  M - More carbonation than expected. Medium body. Very creamy, presumably from the oatmeal.  O - An extremely impressive Stout. The brewers perfectly crafted the malt profile to create a rich flavorful beer with just the right amounts of chocolate, coffee, roast and body.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Adamostella,4.5,"Wanted to review the draft poured version of this beer which I feel is a whole other level of experience for this brew.  Pours out an almost pure obsidian with a thin touch of bronze head around the top.  Everyone raves about the smell on this one and I am in full agreement. Its a fantastic blend of dark roast coffee and the tiniest bit of chocolate.  Drinks extremely smooth, you get the coffee and roast on the front end with an almost surprising bit of sweetness on the finish.  This beer is awesome in any form, but the extra smoothness you get from the keg is unparalleled!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,unclejazz,4.46,"A-jet black, no light is able to pass through this baby. One finger of carmel-hued head and noticable carbonation.  S-I was actually disappointed with the lack of odor, but this might be a result of serving the beer at too cold of a temperature. I smell the coffee and really little else.  T-I was really assaulted by the power of this beer's many flavors, especially after missing alot in the smell. The predominant tastes are dark-chocolate, kona(and being a fan of this type of bean, i can tell the difference) coffee, and burnt toffee. I would have said just toffee, but there is really very little sweet tasting note in this very dark imperial stout.  M-for a stout is was less creamy and much more crisp, reminiscent of the Aussie stout put out by Coopers, which I would reccomend to any fans of this one. This notes left behind from this one are heavy oak and very earthy.  O-This is a pretty hyped beer and probably the flagship selection from Founders. I had it once before on tap at Brouwerij Lane and remember that being a bit sweeter than this experience in a bottle. This is a beer whose flavor really stays with you and is an exceptional way to end November.

1199,11757,Krakistophales,4.42,"A: Pours jet black with just a finger of chocolate colored head that recedes pretty quickly but leaves nice lacing and a thick, frothy top anyway.  S: Huge hits of dark roasted coffee and espresso, cinnamon, a sweet bready maltiness, sweet spiciness, almost caramel or burnt sugar sweetness, and just overall touches of roast and breakfast. Amazing.  T: Lots of dark roast coffee up front which transitions into a french toast combination of sweet, bready, and malty, turning into an almost cinnamon oatmeal like consistency and flavor towards the end, and a dry espresso-esque finish. Just like the taste.  O: This is an amazing breakfast stout, probably the best I've ever had.

Warm milk chocolate sweetness and toffee come through with some toasted grain slight herbal hop aroma  This really is the coffee lovers beer. Robust java, dark chocolate, some roasted caramelized dried fruit, and a subtle amount of roasted bitterness complement a slight introduction of earthy hops.  Smooth, creamy, chewy, delicious.

If they brewed this all year long and was always on the shelf, I probably wouldn't have to spend so much time at my local Friar Tucks looking for something new and interesting.

1199,11757,ScruffySouthpaw,4.63,"Poured into a goblet.  Appearance: Pours a superior dark brown (pretty much black) with a 1/2 inch dark tan head. Semi bubbly settled after my first sip.  Smell: Pure coffee beans with aroma and I do mean aroma of chocolate. It is an aroma you will not forget.  Taste: I honestly am at a standstill should I smell or drink. Seriously it's a tough decision. I am feeling intense flavor of the espresso and chocolate. Slight bitterness but just enough to reflect on such greatness.  Mouth: Medium carbonation which is little bubbly in the back of your tongue.  Overall: Best dark beer I have had in a VERY long time. This is undoubtedly going to be a steady in my fridge (and hopefully yours).

The nose is super complex and delightful. Coffee, chocolate, malt, bitterness. Incredible. One of the best stout noses around. Perfect. Masterful. Taste follows up with more awesomeness. Bitter with a solid backbone of sweetness. Well balanced too. This is an absolutely amazing beer. Mouthfeel could be a little more energetic, although my pour was pretty aggressive. I might revise the mouthfeel up after my second glass.

Another retrospect review, as I have been lucky enough to have had this in bottle form a few times.  Pours dark like a black hole and with a head that bubbles to the top and disperses quickly. I think I keep my beer too cold so the nose on this is always pretty muted right off the bat but livens up as it sits in the glass. Taste is coffee, burnt almonds, and then more coffee. Thanks god I love coffee. Average length of finish that gives, wait for it....more coffee and some carmel/toffee flavors.

The nose has notes of chocolate and coffee. The intense coffee definitely has me thinking breakfast. The taste is rich, deep roasted malts with incredible chocolate and coffee flavors too. After a few sips I notice a little anise or licorice as well. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes noticeable, but it only warms and doesn't detract from flavor. The mouthfeel is rich, full bodied, and well carbonated.  This is a robust, rich, delicious stout. The flavors are complex and well balanced.

Its really really flavorful and the really stout roasted flavors mixed with the coffee makes for an insanely delicious pairing.  I'm not too into the style of coffee beer but this definitely makes them more appealing and so flavorful.

T - This beer is like a thin Yeti RIS (from Great Divide)! This beer is actually quite refreshing for a stout of this magnitude. There is a good presence of coffee, vanilla and chocolate, all blended into this wonderful body.  M - Some good soft to medium carbonation and a real bitter finish, not unpleasant though. The body however is more fluid like, than I had expected.  O - A good Stout, but I expected more body, more sweetness and some more spices.

T: First thing this does is remind me of my daily morning black, french press coffee. Huge, beautiful bitter coffee flavor. This is immediately balanced by some of the residual sugars and the rich maltiness. This turns into some milk chocolate. Finish is long and bitter that's mostly dark chocolate but does have a hint of hop bitterness.  M: Huge body that's incredibly smooth.  O: Totally lives up to the hype!

Again, this is normal for Imperial Stouts.  T - The roasted malts impart a strong, coffee-ish taste (however, this bitterness is eased somewhat by the presence of residual sugars). One can also detect dark chocolate, another flavor imparted from the roasted malts. Like most Imperial Stouts, the presence of alcohol is very noticeable.  M - Rich and creamy. Like most beers with a high malt-hop ratio, the beer is syrupy owing to the presence of many residual sugars.  O - Great beer. It's one of my favorite Imperial Stouts.

Deep and dark roast coffee ground flavor that is nicely held in check by a fair amount of sweetness. Coffee bitterness and acidity are there but are delivered with a creamy smoothness and subtle carbonation.

Look: Oily black with a large, fluffy tan head. Leaves lots of lacing.  Smell: Like fresh coffee grinds, honey, and brown oats.  Taste: Roasted barley, black coffee, hints of chocolate and a kiss of earthy hops. I don't remember it being quite this bitter up front, although the malt sweetness emerges after the first few sips. After it's warmed and flattened, it becomes smooth and chocolatey.  Feel: Medium-bodied. More carbonation than I prefer at first, kind of masks the finish for me.  Overall: A terrific stout, but maybe not quite as other-worldly as when I first had it as a relatively novice beer drinker.

1199,11757,jegross2,4.7,"Reviewing Founders Breakfast Stout by Founders Brewing Company. Score: 96  2011 bottle served in a snifter glass.  Appearance: Pitch black used motor oil. Completely opaque. Even with maybe three sips left in the beer, the body stubbornly keeps out light. Pours maybe one finger of tan head, but it doesn't stick around for long. Tan lace coats the side of the glass as you drink. 4.5/5  Smell: Prominent bitter/roasted coffee and roasted oat flavors (someone left the percolator running!) mask a lot of the beer's aromatic subtleties, but swirling helps to bring some of the other smells out of hiding. Some silky milk chocolate, a little oaky and and a touch of ethanol. The nose is interesting because it is simultaneously acrid from the coffee and creamy from the chocolate. Most stouts tend to be one or the other in my experience. 4.5/5  Taste: Bitter black coffee dominates the flavor. Dark chocolate quite noticeable as well. A little acidic, but smooth. Also has some cooked spice/oak flavors that I may be be mistaking for what is really the oatmeal character of the beer. Some earthy hop presence. Finishes dry with malty coffee breath and a little alcohol sting as the beer warms. 5/5  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, slightly oily, with very little carbonation. Malty/bitter finish. 4.5/5  Overall: Incredibly drinkable, and aggressively coffee flavored, Breakfast Stout lives up to its hype as one of America's best stouts. Founders is my favorite brewery, and this is my favorite of their seasonal (I'm omitting their limited/rare release beers from this definition) releases. It is probably the best stout you can get a hold of without have to stalk a distribution truck, though Old Rasputin and Peche Mortel certainly give this beer a run for it's money as a top tier easy-access beer. I feel sorry for the people outside the Founders distribution network! 5/5  Recommendation: This is about as close to perfect as beers come. I'd probably recommend that casual drinkers sip this one a little colder, but the flavors in this beer get really complex and robust at room temperature.  Pairings: Brownies, Coffee Cake, Oatmeal. Might make a great after dinner dessert for BBQ. Pretty much anything you'd pair coffee with would work here.

Appearance: Served in my Lost Abbey chalice, Breakfast pours thick and muthafuckin’ black like Biggie’s flow. Two fingers of mocha-colored head just above the Abbey’s cross that soon recede into one and just a rim. Not much retention then, but great lacing and always a hefty presence.  Smell: Coffee! And then some… lots of acrid, bitter coffee. Good or bad coffee, I’m not sure… makes me think of that “Kopi Luwak” coffee made with animal droppings. There is barnyard funk in this nose! Milk chocolate at the end, plus booze and dryness. A tad of cola-flavored chewing gum. Strong but overwhelming and one-dimensional nose.  Taste: More coffee, all bitterness and dryness. Smoothness comes through after the first wave of brutal coffee via some milk chocolate. A taste of farm-like funk again, as in the nose, dank hops. Cow pen and monkey droppings. Strange and slightly off-putting.  Mouthfeel: A little too thin for the style. Watery at the end, bitterness all around… not exactly balanced, but good carbonation. Dry, has got me reaching for water! Grainy feeling at the end, like being around those corn silos in Central Illinois. Paired with a raw New Jersey U-10 scallop, this puppy gained some nice brininess and dimension.  Overall: 4.0: I’ve long had issues with the “cult” status of this beer. It is good, sure enough. Very good indeed. But amazing? Not quite. I mean, I love coffee and coffee beers, but Breakfast is like drinking cold coffee straight up. No nuances here, not much chocolate or oatmeal. Goes down well, though, good drinkability. A note about the new description: “Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout”. WTF?

T: Silky smooth rich chocolate and mild dark coffee & milk mixing with bits of spice and hop bite. Finishes just a little bitter, lactic, and dry.  M: Incredible, full bodied, chewy, smooth as silk.

Big aroma of coffee is upfront, alongside sweet chocolate, toffee, and caramel. Taste is all coffee at first, rich and bold with a nice bitterness that coats the tongue. Touch of pine breaks through and blends with the coffee, while chocolate and tobacco mingle around on the tastebuds. Slight bitterness, roasted malts, and touch of alcohol arrive at the end of the sip, confirming to the brain that this is in fact a beer, not a cup of extra bold coffee.

Tastes just like it smells. It doesn't bowl me over. It's not as complex, at least at this point, for my tastes.  Its mouthfeel creamy. One can get a milk stout feel from what must be a lactose sugar or maltodextrine. There's a nice chocolate pudding thing going on here.  Overall this is one of Founders better offerings. I think it will get better and deeper with some aging.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,powellmg,4.42,"Black with a tan head. Strong aroma of dark coffee. Full, intense taste of coffee, creamy mouthfeel, lasting bitterness on the finish.  This is almost more coffee than beer. I've been a home coffee roaster for quite a while, and have had my share of excellent coffees. What impresses me most about this beer is the quality of coffee in the aroma and taste--rich and complex.  A very impressive offering.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Pintofbrown,4.47,"This beer was served into a glass stein. Big thanks to Geneseohawk for this one!  Appearance- This beer is completely opaque and dark. I can see some carbonation columns at the side of the glass. The head grew to about two fingers and appears really frothy, color of milk chocolate. The retention is good, not really any lace.  Smell- The head is full of milk chocolate. There are distinct coffee notes and a little bit of cream. It smells very good!  Taste- There are lots of roasted malt that mingles with cooked oatmeal. The milk chocolate comes through huge mid-drink and into the finish. There is also molasses that adds to the sweet profile. There is just a little bit of spicy hop and some coffee in there.  Mouth feel- This one is a nice full body. It is very creamy for having these complex, roasted notes. The oatmeal in here does a very nice job of smoothing this out.  Overall- This is a very interesting stout with fantastic flavors. The coffee and chocolate notes are well done. Definitely sip this one slowly and let it warm.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,climax,3.91,"Brewed 10/22/11 Sampled 11/12/11 Poured into a tulip, next time.... a coffee mug.  Up to the light, very little of anything other than black is detected. A Brazilian tan head forms and sticks, period. Only agitating the beer causes it to drop, and even then a sheet of lace is left behind. It's really a welcome sight.  Smoke and black coffee bean dominate the aroma. Dark roasty flavors and astringency definitely overpower any sweetness. If I take a quick vague whiff of the beer, I hate to say it reminds me of coffee/smoker breath. Leafy hop flavors begin to sneak they're way in as it warms, 60 IBU's will do that.  This definitely is the coffee lovers beer. Maybe just a dash of caramel and vanilla accent the assertive coffee flavor. Just the scarcest amount of chocolatey sweetness is evident in the finish, as well as a dash of astringency. One thing that certainly doesn't make it's presence known is alcohol. It's simply non-existent start to finish.  The mild but ample carbonation and overall smoothness of the feel is very good. I've had more viscous Imperial Stouts, but this one almost does match the consistency of a cup of joe.  The coffee lover will dig this beer. If you aren't such, I think you may find the complexity and overall character a bit of a let down for such a popular stout. For me, the coffee just dominates the other flavors a bit too much.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Appearance: Jet black with a finger of fluffy foam the color of good chocolate mousse  Aroma: amazing bittersweet mocha aroma...I almost literally feel like I'm smelling/drinking a delicious mocha, but with more toffee/caramel malt depth to it  Taste: you know how coffee beans smell so amazing and as good as coffee is it will never taste as good as it smells? yeah that's not a problem here. amazing roasty coffee character, tons of bittersweet chocolate flavor, and lots of nice bitterness to round it out. far from cloyingly sweet...the sweetness is actually pretty minimal given a beer this big, but it's just enough to round the whole thing out.  Mouthfeel: silky and delightful, full and chewy but refreshing  Overall: wow, what a wonderful imperial stout, and amazingly easy to drink given the ABV and bitterness. an amazing dessert beer that I feel privileged to try. will definitely try to brew the published clone recipe of this sometime down the road",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Amazingly balanced. So many layers of flavors. There must be an immense amount of malts and hops in this one, all of which blend together beautifully. Thick, chewy, and huge in body. Tastes of coffee, chocolate, caramel and toffee up front. Surprisingly though, there is very little sweetness. A bittering citric and herbal hop presence stings the back of the tongue just in time to wash away any flavor that would try to overstay its visit in your mouth.

S: Big deep roasted malt notes, coffee, oats, and chocolate. A touch of hops comes off as well.  T: Huge coffee, oat, chocolate and malt notes. Alcohol is minimally noticed. Hops are noticable on the secondary palate. Aftertaste is roasted malt, slightly bitter chocolate, coffee and oats.  M: Malt and oats give a heavier, chewy sensation.

The next I poured more vigorously and the head was perfect. It smells of strong coffee. The taste is incredible on this one and the coffee, chocolate and roasted malts come together nicely.

1199,11757,ChiHophead13,4.73,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Dogfish snifter.  A - midnight black with the consistency of Castrol motor oil. Thick, creamy head the color of milk chocolate. Ton of lacing on the glass.  S - burnt coffee, espresso, and dark chocolate pouring out of this one. Hard to find any hop presence due to the overwhelming nature of the coffee.  T - bitter chocolate and fresh ground espresso roast. Some malty and toffee with a wonderfully long chocolate finish. Not all all boozy at 8+%.  M - full bodied, mild carbonation, extremely well balanced and drinkable.  O - this is what a coffee stout should be. Although the coffee and chocolate are intense, they're not overwhelming. There's nothing ""one note"" about the flavor profile as everything works well together.

1199,11757,ccarney2,4.35,"Appearance - black as night with a 2 finger tan head that lingers for a short time, but leaves good lacing throughout the glass.  Smell - Sweet, lots of toasted malt with a bitter coffee smell coming though. Not too much alcohol in the nose.  Taste - Sweet start with a quick transition to some of the bitterness. The malts and hops work really well together, the sweetness of the grain fade nicely into a bitter roasted coffee flavor. You get a little more of the alcohol here than in the nose.  Mouthfeel - Wonderful for me. A little more carbonation than most stouts I've had recently, but the silky smooth texture is still there and it surrounds the tongue.  Overall - This beer is fantastic. It is something that i could literally drink for breakfast, and would work especially work well with some buttered toast and eggs. The taste is rather mild and lingering, but incredibly complex. One of the best stouts I've ever had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,demuzik,4.89,"This is very much an exceptional beer; the way they manage to cram all the coffee notes of espresso, chocolate, and roasted grain, yet keep it balanced and gentle - this is by no means a harsh or bitter stout... hence the breakfast reference. Both the aroma and taste are heavily espresso/coffee oriented; the mouthfeel is creamy, yet light - not overbearing.  Not a session beer, by any means, too complex and interesting - but worth a visit each Fall as it comes available - if you haven't tried it yet, do so... its a Stout worth writing home about.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ThePorterSorter,4.45,"Appearance: Gawd this beer looks heavenly with it's pitch black soul and hearty tan muffin top. The stickiness of the lacing is world class and it's pretty generously carbonated.  Smell: Oh man, this is such a delicious smelling beer. It's strong notes of milk chocolate, toasted coconut and coffee with a little bit of oat graininess. A touch of spice is also detected, but almost no alcohol (which is a big difference between this beer and KBS).  Taste: I remember why I love this beer. It's absolutely incredible and a delightful stout. Its got just the right amount of bold flavors offset by a light spice. There are no issues of balance and there is a slightly tart, roasty aftertaste that leaves me satiated after each sip.  Mouthfeel: Big, bold beer with tons of flavor and a full body. Exactly what I'm looking for in a stout. There is a lingering aftertaste that is slightly roasty and well mannered. It's still quite pleasant when warmed up.  Overall: Damn delicious beer with lots of rich flavors. It definitely hit the spot and would likely be a good cellar-ing candidate.

Fresh ground coffee beans. Chocolate is barely noticeable.  I taste chocolate first, then coffee. Burnt malt. To call this one flavorful would be an understatement...this thing packs a punch. Its an explosion of flavor. All chocolate and coffee.  Being that I'm a relative newby, this is by far the most robust stout I have personally had. Thick.

Smooth, chocolatey and coffe, vanilla undertones. You can barely notice the high ABV. I think I should start re-thinking my take on stouts. With a stout this good, there are bound to me more.

Fast forward 4 years later. Bottled 11-04-2011. Coffee taste and smell is stronger and more pleasing than in any other stout I have drank, including Mikkeller Brunch Weasel (which I would never have thought possible).

Not a hint of alcohol on the nose.  T: Coffee comes out strongly up front, followed by some weaker chocolate notes afterward. The finish is just like black coffee. While the oats don't come through as strongly, they help to round out the other flavors. Not a hint of alcohol comes through here, either.  M: Full-bodied, creamy and smooth with a bit of carbonation. Couldn't ask much more of a stout.  D: This beer is exceptionally easy to drink, especially considering the ABV.

An aggressive pour leads to a huge head into a snifter.  Smells like coffee from a mile away. Dark roasted coffee with very slight hints of dark chocolate. Hints of oaty smoothness.  The taste isnt as full of coffee dominated as you would think. Yes the coffee dominates, but in not the proportions you would expect. The coffee beans come out through the exhale. The mouth is full of a lactose-like smoothness with hints of caramel sweetness and semi-sweet chocolate. In spite of that, the coffee is there. Its more bitter than the smell might lead you to believe.  Al that being said, its definitely a breakfast stout. Coffee is everywhere, and everything else just accents that dark roast coffee.

1199,11757,stckhndlr,4.7,A- Pours very dark. Black. Only when using a flashlight held right up to the glass can a hint of red be seen just barely at the very edge of the glass. A full thick dark tan two finger head settled on top. Lots of sediment floating around in the dark abyss as well. As I drink this one down there is some of the best lacing left behind that I have seen in a beer yet.  S- HUGE chocolate and coffee flavors can be smelled from a distance while pouring this one. Malty notes get even stronger when you really get into it. What better smells for breakfast than roasted coffee and chocolate.  T- I start first with the coffee and roasted malt flavor. Tastes like a rich chocolate espresso. But as I swallow I get my first taste of the oatmeal coming through. Some burnt dark chocolate bitters linger on my tongue for several minutes after I swallow. Super long finish.  M- A bit watery thin at first but as is sits on the tongue it thickens just a bit to reveal a more full body to it. Comes out to smooth finish. Super easy to drink.  O- I have read so many reviews and heard so many great things about this beer. After a long wait I can now say that the anticipation that built up before now was not in vein.

1199,11757,bkrueger,4.62,"Thanks to Zeller1 for sending this my way. I'll do this the honor of being my first beer review after spending the last year or so reviewing hundreds and hundreds of bottles of wine.  Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Russian River ""tion"" glass. It looks like it was bottled 08/05/11 but the bottle on date is mostly worn off and it is hard to be exact.  The appearance is pitch black with around 1/8 of an inch of light creamy brown head that quickly dissipates to leave a ring of lacing around the edge of the glass.  The smell is one of the best aromatic experiences I have ever had with any beer. It is sweet chocolate, burnt brown sugars, sweet cream, slight hints of alcohol, and loads upon loads of espresso beans with undertones of brown sugar oatmeal.  The taste hits my tongue with smooth espresso flakes upon the first sip, slightly bitter watery dark burnt chocolate then takes hold before leaving a full on espresso after taste. Espresso is the most pronounced characteristic with bitter chocolates coming in behind as I slowly drink.  The mouthfeel is watery with chewy espresso and dark bitter chocolate kicking in to leave a long bitter and lasting impression. The carbonation is good and present letting you know this beer is alive and well.  Overall this is a great beer and one that I would drink again and again if this were available. The smell is pretty much perfect with sweet creaminess and lush chocolate that belie the first couple of sips that instead give me a more bitter background. As the beer warms the bitterness mellows out and gives a sweet chocolate and cream mouthfeel and taste, picking up more cream and less water as the dominant characteristic in mouthfeel. I would drink this at any time of the day and also have a couple in a row because it is highly drinkable and delicious. The taste noticeably improves as the beer warms so don't drink it too fast.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,mullenpc,4.82,"Bottle (11/4/2011) served in a Stone 15th Anniversary Glass  Poured vigorously which produced a fairly thick finger-width tan/cinnamon colored head. Looks like it will stick around forever. As expected, the beer is pitch black, and as I can already smell it, it looks like the world's best black coffee.  This bottle is super fresh so I expected the coffee to overwhelm, but the quality of the chocolate used in this beer is evident. The coffee aroma is dominant and almost smells like the taste you get from biting into a great fresh, quality bean, but I can definitely smell a quality chocolate behind the coffee.  Taste is perfect. It's not overly salty or sweet like some of the ST Blackwater series. The overwhelming taste of a freshly brewed cup of Kona coffee is spot on, followed by a chocolate creaminess on the finish. This bottle is incredibly fresh, so I am still getting a lingering hop bite on the finish, but it's nothing more than a complementary nod to the incredible flavors that came before.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a beer of this style and ABV, but the carbonation level is right on and the finish is very smooth.  FBS is a very iconic beer and it's easy to see why. The label brands the beer as a double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout, and that is exactly what it is. In my mind it is an almost perfect example of the coffee/chocolate stout.

1199,11757,ewright,4.57,"OK, I've complained about the FBS shortage (until now) in NC long enough. I guess I better review this one. Case had a packaged date of 11/4/2011. This is only 4 days old!  The only knock on appearance is that I didn't get very much head... just a lingering ring of bubbles around the edge and a thin layer on top. Beer is black as night as befits a beer of this stature.  The aroma is fan-freaking-tastic. I can get a caffeine buzz just from the smell. Kona and Sumatra are two of my favorite varietals of coffee and they really make this beer stand out, even cutting through a mild bit of congestion. Dark chocolate notes hide underneath the coffee, smells like fine cocoa.  Taste lives up to the aroma. Coffee and cocoa merge together like a nice mocha, hops are present enough to give balance and a bit of bite on the tongue, but nothing overwhelming.  The only drawback (and it's slight) is that I'd like just a bit more body to this beer... it's slightly too thin on the tongue. Don't want too much more sweetness, just a slight bit more of that tongue-coating quality great impy stouts can have.

T: Jesus is this fresh: the coffee wrecks immediate havoc on my poor palate. It's like the best damn diner coffee you've ever had, but in beer form. Unsweetened dark chocolate slams across the mid, and the two parts equal an epic whole, as they wash over the finish, hand in hand. This is absolutely fantastic.  M: Liquid chocolate. It coats my mouth, my throat and I'm sure my tummy too.  O: I really can't believe it took me this long to review Founders Breakfast Stout. I've bought cases of this stuff and never once laid down a review? Fail, Rhettroactive.  It goes without saying that this is one of my favorite, easily accessible beers.

1199,11757,CFHMagnet,4.85,"A bottle from the 2010 batch I saved for a year to try my hand at cellaring. Poured into a Founder's snifter.  I poured this one aggressively and still didn't get half a finger of head. The little I got was mocha colored, body is deep brown to the point of being almost black. The little bit of head I got left me with nothing but a pencil thin ring.  Smells like coffee, a hint of dark chocolate, raisins and something slightly burnt.  The taste is where this puppy really stands out. It comes on strong with the coffee, then swings into raisin and malt before finishing out slightly dry with a nice dark chocolate flavor. The year of aging it went through really helped stretch and develop the flavor profile. Delicious!  For as dark and complex as this beer is, it has no trouble going down. It's a medium to full bodied brew, but has kept enough carbonation so that it doesn't get bogged down in your mouth. I'm drinking it for a late brunch.  I love this stout. It is one of my all time favorite beers. It has been a go-to brew in suggestions for friends who are interested in trying stouts for the first time.

Smell is a *lot* of dark-roasted coffee, with a hint of sweetness. Taste starts off creamy, and like nutty, roasted beans with a dollop of sweeter dark chocolate. But this quickly morphs into a bitter, drying cacao. A *lot* of bittering hops for this one, and they overshadow the roast & chocolate. Finishes intensely dry. Has a fair amount of complexity going for it, but I just did not get the amount of chocolate I was hoping for. Or oats. The heat is noticeable.

1199,11757,beerismysavior,3.77,"8.3 % ABV 60 IBUs  Notes: This would be considered a double oatmeal stout based on the ABV. Traditional oatmeal stout that is recognized by the Brewer's Association and the BJCP often falls between 4 - 6% ABV with a profile of 20 - 40 IBUs. On a technical basis, this beer would suffer from difficult classification as one specific style. In reality it is a double oatmeal stout, but this is not recognized as a formal style by any governing body with enough clout to classify styles that we all use today. Interesting fact.  Bottle: Light coat of sediment on the bottom  Date: Bottled on 10/06/2011  Glass: Small red wine glass with very slight taper  Drank: Drank on 11/02/2011  Appearance: Black in color, completely opaque, a deep rich tan colored head, reminiscent of a long-black (Australian espresso drink) or espresso served in a clear shot glass.  Aroma: Definite coffee nose, reminds me of a really tasty mildly roasted bean. Aroma mellows into a somewhat more chocolate nose after sitting for a few moments.  Taste: Surprisingly bitter taste, smells like a mild roast, tastes like a dark roast coffee. Somewhere inbetween a sweet and dry stout as expected. No alcohol astringency (good thing) with a definitive coffee profile. I was expecting to pick up more on the oatmeal.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly thick and smooth at the same time. Medium carbonation. Lingering bitterness isn't terrible, not totally pleasant either.  Overall: My expectations led me to believe this would be a creamier beer. The higher IBU and alcoholic content + presence of bottle sediment lead me to believe this beer would benefit significantly from aging. If I could intuit another brewer's mindset, the 60 IBUs is a preservation technique, not so much a flavor effort. That being said, this beer should begin ripening in approximately 6 months and continue to grow over an indefinite number of months.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Nugganooch,4.22,I owe a big thanks to 2 very awesome traders (Mid & mdfb79)for this because I actually received a bottle from each. Cheers fellas!  Notes from 10-31-11 after a long night of trickin’ *Pour into a 10oz PizzaPort fest sampler nonic.  A: Founders Breakfast Stout pours a super dark cola colored ale with some lighter edges to it. It’s not that viscous in appearance at all or not as viscous as I was expecting I guess. A thin rim of brown sugar foam formed and faded rather quickly. Only some spots of lace.  S: Smells of roasted grains with some earthy oak like aromas. Ground coffee and cocoa powder. Sweet with a chocolate syrup likeness.  T: Tastes of sweet toasted cereals with an almost smoky dry roasted coffee bean flav. Has an earthy hop spice and rich roasted bitter chocolates give a bit of tart. Not a ton of chocolate or coffee. Both are subtle and really well balanced overall. Not overly sweet in any way. Some alcohol flavors but not hot. Rather smooth and quite tasty actually.  M: Thinner than expected mouthfeel that manages to still be somewhat viscous across the palate. Makes for better sessionability IMO. Creamy. Medium body. Good carbonation gives a nice dry crisp finish.  D: Overall a very nice and approachable Stout with some subtle chocolate and coffee character. Nothing too intense really but quite well balanced and delicious. Would definitely like to receive again.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Many stouts come close but you can still see some light around the edges of the glass when you hold it up to the light. Not FBS. Cocoa head leaves nice lacing.  S: Roasted, bitter coffee grounds dominate, with rolled oats, a hint of chocolate, and a somewhat acrid vegetable aroma, like that of mashed peas.  T: Bitter coffee, dark chocolate, oatmeal, earthy hops. Definitely gets better as it warms. Exceptionally bold.  M: Viscous but somewhat thin compared to what I expected. A nice, lingering bitterness from the coffee and hops without drying the mouth out.  O: I was a little disappointed, as I bit on the massive hype surrounding FBS and its brethren.

S: Wow! It smelled like a cup of mocha plus some hops. Normally I prefer something less sweet and malty but the smell was enticing.  T: For someone who isn't huge on stouts/porters, this was a treat. The menu called it ""liquid devil's food cake,"" and they were partially right. Lots of espresso and chocolate flavors with a substantial hop character.

1199,11757,robboyd,4.8,"This is an exceptional beer by every stretch of the imagination. I was fortunate enough to have a fairly regular supply so I've been drinking it steadily over the past few months and it impresses me each time I crack open a bottle. It pours black with the most invitingly attractive head that is caramel in color. The head fades quickly, almost too quickly but leaves behind some nice spots.  It smells like a stout should in my opinion. It's hearty, slightly boozy, with delicious roasted coffee, toffee, and malt notes.  The taste backs up the smell. It's so complex and yet so simple in it's presentation. All the flavors that you have on the nose greet you with every sip. There isn't anything buried here and the taste is consistent throughout every sip. It leaves you with a fine coffee finish that lingers until you take another taste. It's almost punishment at this point.

T The taste follows the nose with lots of chocolate but again not much coffee which seems to have faded. Still pretty good though.  M Very thick and viscous mouth feel.

Excluding the CBS and to be tasted soon, KBS. This thing pours with a bit of tan head; amazing coffee and chocolate smell that lasts the entire time. It only get better as it warm. I could drink this right out of the package no refrigeration at all. The oatmeal seems to add just the right amount of feel to this stout to make this a nice slow drinker but the alcohol is just in the right proportion that i want to drink this all night.

There were also some very present roasted malt notes and a slight hop presence.  Wonderful taste, wonderful mouthfeel. Everything to be expected, chocolate, roastiness, coffee.

The lace clings in a spotty fashion. The aroma is full of coffee, very mild caramel with slight cocoa accents and a roasty overall nose. The feel is dry and roasty, but has a mild bitterness with slight fruitiness and silky feel that the oats give with medium body and gentle acidity.  The taste begins slightly nutty and sweet w/ mild caramel malt and launches into a roasty coffee flavor which is both earthy, spicy and slight bitter with mild burnt elements, but very mild char with the yeast giving an almost creamy and fruity tanginess which compliments the tannin from the dark grain well. The hop spice and roasted malt character is not too far to come off as harsh, just enough to let the beans contribute their delightful flavor with a very mild alcohol compliment in the semi-dry roasty finish. Overall a classic coffee stout, simple hones to goodness and you get the added benefit of a little cocoa for an all around mocha-like Imperial stout.

1199,11757,EnkiduBrew,4.38,"Appearance is jet black with no light able to come through. Very little head (dark tan in color) with some lacing.  Smells primarily of coffee beans followed closely by chocolate. I cannot detect any hop aroma at all; meeting the style guidelines as far as I know.  Taste is dominated (like the smell) by coffee and chocolate. This is new bottle and as of right now, more chocolate comes through than any other flavor. Perhaps after some proper aging the chocolate would mellow a little and the malt to shine through more. A rounded bitterness is balanced by some malt sweetness. The 8.3% abv is unnoticeable unlike some beers of this gravity. No hop flavor presence.  Mouthfeel is exceptional. Full bodied and velvety just like what we should expect from an Oatmeal Stout. Carbonation has been kept to a minimum, which prevents that acidic feeling that some higher carbonated beers have.  Overall impression. Probably the best representation of the style I have had thus far. I am drinking this as I type and can't help but wonder how this beer would be as a cask ale.

Appearance: Pours an opaque black motor oil that is the deepest dark mahogany at the curves and when held up to the light. Head consists of some light khaki fizz that dissipates in seconds. Looks like a very good stout.  Nose: Wonderfully complex. Its difficult to deconstruct this one because the blend is so well executed on this one. Up front are some fairly powerful espresso and chocolate notes that intertwine quite well. In the middle are some very creamy oat notes supported by an earthy note. No alcohol and a dark roasty malt.  Taste: Yeah...this is masterful. On the front is a semi-sweet chocolate closely followed by a big, creamy chocolate coffee supported by oat flakes and dark roasted malts. On the finish is an ever so slight hint of hop bitterness.

Seems like this aspect may be as much from, if not more so, from the coffee than the actual hops themselves. I almost mistake this bitterness for a sourness at time, like drinking coffee black. Overall, get a coffee-forward flavor with notes of roastiness, and cocoa. Also, get the faintest more peppery, citrus (lemon) bitterness from hops; this is very sutble.  There is not a strong sweetness to this beer at all. I find this quite suprising. Also this is not a overly heavy, sticky flavor beer. That all being said, it’s still quite enjoyable. Just different than many other stouts I’ve had before.  Mouthfeel: 3.5  Milder thickness, with a moderate carbonation. Seems to be just a bit thin for my liking, but not too much though. Do get some initial sweetness, but then a more definitive dry finish  Overall: 4 Different than I expected because significantly more bitter than sweet. Obviously, this was the aim of the beer, but I guess I didn’t realize this beforehand. It does have a nice coffee, cocoa roasty taste that I enough. I just tend to enjoy a bit more sweetness in my stouts. However, I could see many people who don’t like the more standard sweeter RIS beers liking this a lot.  Also, at the end, I tried this beer with a chocolate cookie and it did pair quite well. The sweet, sugary cookie softed the bitterness of the beer, and I found the beer, in turn, had richer flavors of cocoa and coffee. I understand how this could be a great java-breakfast substitute beverage.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Black as a desert night. A nice finger of tan head formed and continued to come together after the pour. I could smell it in the pour. Dark chocolate, black malt, alcohol and milk chocolate. Strong and rich. Tastes black; bitter chocolate, alcohol and burnt grain. Super smooth, a little creamy, medium body and moderate carbonation. I was surprised by the alcohol smell and taste. It does not have an exceptionally high ABV. Still, the smell was perfect: big and bold. The taste was incredible.

Chocolate coming through.  First sip is coffee, again. Slight chocolate bitter rises, with roasted barley holding strong while oaty, toffee breaks through. Finish is bitter oat though. Yummy oat all day! Vanilla starts coming into the mix as it warms.  Carbonation is high. Tingles well into middle of taste, but delightful, nevertheless. Thick as you would expect it to be upon first glance, but settles nicely. Thins nicely but lingers long, making me anxious for another sip.  Overall, WOW. This one never gets old. Finish the night with this one. Roasted (sweet) coffee, substantial balanced bitter against the roasted malty notes, with savory oat and toffee to boot!

S - My bottle was kind of old, so I did not get a full aroma out of this beer. I did get some chocolate, a bit of coffee, and slight vanilla notes, though.  T - This is like a flavour explosion in my mouth! The beer's taste is a marvellous blend of iced coffee, dark chocolate, caramel and vanilla. The oatmeal gives it a nice smooth texture, while the abundance of roasted malts provide some noticeable bitterness. Balanced sweetness. Constant improvement and expansion of the flavour profile call for taking your time while savouring every sip.  M - The mouthfeel is quite massive, with plenty of body and viscosity to it. The alcohol content is masked pretty well. The texture is smooth and silky.  O - Wow, what a great stout to savour! The fact that the brewer had made it a chocolate, oatmeal, and coffee stout at the same time is simply astonishing, as is the way these ingredients all work out together.

The nose is smooth coffee with hints of cocoa roasted malts a ever so slight hint of alcohol at the end.  The taste, well let me start by saying I don't like coffee or atleast the american version. This is not like american coffee. The flavor is sweet to start very sweet but as the sweet begin to get to be to much the bitter roasted malts and the flavor of coffee come in. The coffee taste lingers and never turns burnt. Slight creamy taste with real cocoa finish with a dry taste as bakers chocolate would. The moutch is nice low carbonation tickle the tip of the tongue while the bitterness coats the middle...as this beer sits, open in my glass not a celler, it tend more toward cloying as the carbonation fades but the cocoa remains.

1199,11757,justiceavocado,3.41,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Inappropriate? I don't care. I'm at the moment convinced a snifter is great for any style.  A – Opaque black with essentially no head. Just a few islands of bubbles, a few of which stick to the glass in a weak trace of lacing. Looks flat and sad, really. If I didn't already know this was THE Founders Breakfast Stout, I would be disappointed. But I suppose that's typical of these more imperial stouts.  S – Well, coffee, yeah. That's definitely happening. Also, burnt caramel. Kind of like something from Starbucks? My nose is searching for chocolate, but I'm not finding it. Should I be? This is disorienting. The balance is great. In fact, I'm smelling it too much. It's becoming my brain's default smell, so maybe I should just get to drinkin, eh!  T – Coffee beans. Not the drink, the actual beans, after you've sucked all the chocolate off of them. A good kind of bitterness, and not balanced with as much sweetness on top as you'd expect. It is this unexpectedness that I appreciate. This is a bitter stout, but not hoppy really at all.. Despite the novelty, it is still coming across as two-dimensional.  M – It doth sit heavily on the tongue. As the appearance indicated, not too much carbonation. But it does tickle the tongue, to a degree. I'd say very appropriate for the style, anyway.  O – No more than once per sitting, for me, thanks. I'm a fan of coffee things (but not hot coffee itself, I add irrelevantly), and this falls into that category, but I don't know if I'm going to be going after it with equal anticipation next fall. I'm sure I'll get a four pack, if I see it, but that might be where it starts and stops. (That's actually not true.

Bittersweet chocolate is in the background compared to the coffee. Earthy. Really nice.  T: Out of this world flavor. Think of the aroma but much more pronounced. Loads of coffee, I even get that distinctive coffee acidity and bitterness. Bitter chocolate covered espresso bean aftertaste. Beautifully balanced and with loads of flavor. Alcohol is nowhere in sight. The chocolate lingers for a long time.  M: Full. Coasts the mouth extremely well. Feels thick, rich and luxurious. Leaves a nice chocolate layer in my mouth. Soft carbonation. Creamy. Can it get any better?  Wow, this beer is the whole package for me. It looks great, smells great, tastes world class, and has a soft, creamy mouthfeel.

Bittersweet coffee can be smelled from feet away. Some roastiness, dark chocolate, and hop bitterness can be smelled, as well. A bit bitter for me, but good for the style.  T: A bit of a surprise after the smell. There is significantly less coffee in the taste. Much more roast, fairly significant hop bitterness, with some bitter coffee. The bitterness is a bit much for me, but overall very good.  M: Thick with good carbonation. Very good.  O: The coffee and chocolate flavors in this beer are wonderful.

Taste is similar to nose - lots of roasty, chocolatey, coffee-ness. Super intense. Dark chocolate bitterness lingers, with a hint of coffee.  Not very carbonated, but perfectly carbonated. The flavor from one sip of this lasts like two minutes. Such an intense brew.  This was my first time with the breakfast stout - now I understand what all the talk is about!

Even get a little malted milk ball character at the end (which I like a lot). Perfectly balanced. Outstanding.  M: Almost like drinking a thick, rich, iced coffee shake. Definitely a sipper. Coats the tongue and mouth beautifully, not cloyingly. Because it is heavy, 1-2 tops per sitting (if I could get that many) would do it for me.  Overall, like everyone else, I love this beer.

Complex coffee, oatmeal, and earthy notes behind the more obvious chocolate.  T - Heavy amount of coffee in the very front. Swiftly followed by a rush of dark and bittersweet chocolates. A twang of bitterness is in there but it is unclear if it belongs to the roasted barley or a hop bitterness. Alcohol is very well hidden and only a slight trace remains.  M - Heaviest bodied beer I've ever had. Very thick and sludgy. A medium low amount of carbonation.  D - One of the best beers I've ever tried. Certainly the best stout I've ever had.

1199,11757,ryguy210375,4.5,"Appearance - Pours a ""dark coffee"" black with a small but respectable head. Head appears off white with cinnamon color mixed it. Frothy and slightly murky.  Smell - Strong Expresso, Coffee, with bits of dark chocoloate/cocoa.  Taste - Excellent. Immediately hit by the expresso/coffee bitterness. However, it quickly fades into a smooth, silky, bittersweet chocolate with noticeable hints of cream and vanilla. Finish is expected; that of lingering coffee and cocoa. FBS finds that perfect middleground of sweetness where it's present and just enough, yet not anywhere near cloying. Perfect amount of sweetness to balance out the coffee biterness mid palate without being overdone. Alcohol is barely noticeable (and what is noticeable blends into the coffee/chocolate very complimentary), and I was having it at room temperature instead of chilled which would probably take it right out.  Mouthfeel- Smooth as silk. I would say it's a rich, medium mouthfeel. Not as thick as I was expecting (a plus for me personally), but it definitely feels like there is a bit of melted chocolate that provides smoothness and just a tad of stickiness.  Overall - Superb. It goes without saying though, that you must be a fan coffee/expresso flavors. The chocolate and hints of cream and vanilla are clearly noticeable, but the coffee dominates.

1199,11757,gigaknight,4.62,"A- Poured hard and optimistically into a pint glass (didn't feel like scrubbing a snifter later), presenting a dissipating film of peanut-butter colored head. Little lacing to speak of, however the brew is still rather cold, so I'm sure it'll get stickier as it approaches room temperature.  S- I've enjoyed Breakfast Stout several times now, but this bouquet never gets old. Rich torrents of sweet espresso and milky chocolate greet the nose even while relatively cold. As the beer warms, the coffee stands out even more, and a bit of toasty vanilla peeks out as well.  T- As expected, coffee dominates the front end of the palate, followed by the unfolding sweetness of rich chocolate and a well measured bit of lactic tang. The coffee notes here lack any tone of oxidization (as lesser breakfast stouts may), and the balanced nature of the beer's sweetness is without compare. Not even approaching cloying, the complexity of this brew allows every element of its palate to emerge and blend gracefully.  M- Rich and silky with just enough carbonation so as to not let the robust flavors accumulate too heavily on the tongue. Chews well, and is remarkably sessionable despite the lofty alcoholic content.  O- It's no secret that this is world class beer, and I feel like it's become much more readily available in the midwest during its seasonal run, thus spoiling me towards just about any other stouts I bring home in its place. I honestly haven't had actual coffee this smooth and well-defined, and that goes double for any stout that regulates its own sweetness so well.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,HossMcGraw,3.77,"Mixed feelings on this one; I've been anxiously awaiting to try it and found it to be a well-made beer, but not something I would actively seek out. Pours thick and viscous with no head or lacing to speak of. Nose is coffee that's been sitting around for a while, bakers chocolate and something a bit sour. Not overwhelmingly so; some may call it dark fruit but it comes off as a bit sour to me. Taste is quite bold; follows the nose with a super dark chocolate and lingering espresso on the tongue. Mouthfeel was a huge letdown. No carbonation (not that it was expected), and quite thin. Despite the thick appearance, mouthfeel is surprisingly thin which feels strange considering the bold flavors. So..kinda conflicted about this. It tastes delicious but isn't particularly attractive and feels weird in the mouth which makes it difficult to enjoy. Just overall kinda let down. I think maybe I just need massive tongue-numbing hops to balance this. I've been a fiend for hops as of late.

1199,11757,orangesol,4.21,"Served on nitro-tap at The Fridge on their opening day.  A - Pours dark as night black with a nice creamy one and a half finger tall khaki colored head leaving thick rings of lace down the glass. The cascade effect caused by the nitro-pour was a thing of beauty.  S - Smells of rich espresso, bakers chocolate, and vanilla. Good balance of dark roast to sweetness. While all the flavors are there I think the nitro dulled them down a bit.  T - Starts off with a huge espresso kick that never really fades away. Hints of sweet bakers chocolate, vanilla, and the dark roasted malts help to keep the coffee in check as much as they can but that is next to impossible with this beer. The finish is a mix of dark roast and light sweetness, lingering on the pallet for some time. Like the nose, I believe the nitro may have dulled the flavors a tiny bit.  M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. The rich, creamy, feel was nearly perfect for this beer. It got a tiny bit watery at the very end tho.  O - Still one of my all time favorite stouts. The nitro pour, while offering amazing looks and feels, does hurt the smell and taste a tiny bit.

Smell: The coffee is definitely upfront, with the chocolate working its magic in the background. Definitely one of the best-smelling beers I've had.  Taste: Stays true to the smell. The chocolate comes more into play here, but as the beer warms, it is balanced nicely by the hops, which add to the bitter coffee flavor. Though I love big malty flavors in a stout, I think this brew stays true to its concept of being a coffee/espresso stout.  Mouthfeel: Somewhat creamy (could've used a bit more), but with just the right amount of carbonation. The alcohol is hidden very well.

Smells of roasted coffee beans, chocolate and vanilla. The coffee is aromatic like a extra bold blend. Fantastic balance between sweet, bitter and roasty.  Extra bold espresso flavor with a milky sweetness. Chocolate and vanilla are both present and provide excellent compliments. The finish is bittersweet like a chocolate coffee bean. I can't say enough about the flavor profile. It is the King of coffee stouts.  Creamy and smooth, viscous and bold. Medium carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden under the rich coffee and chocolate.

1199,11757,beagle75,3.92,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  A: Opaque black color with a quickly diminishing residue of beige foam. Light lacing remains on the glass.  S: At its coldest this beer smells overwhelmingly of coffee, like freshly ground beans. As it warms it develops deeper, more mocha-leaning qualities that suggest unctuousness. No alcohol is detected.  T: Begins off-dry, with early roasted malt that is slightly bitter and astringent. When combined with the coffee nose, the qualities of coffee are maintained here. Acidity is present but does not detract, remaining at an acceptable level. The middle displays a woody chicory quality, some mild cocoa, and cardboard. Honest coffee aromatics are abundant in the finish, where bitterness is closely tied to the coffee qualities, rather than possessing the herbaceous qualities indicative of hops. No alcohol is detected.  M: Medium to thick viscosity, slightly syrupy without being cloying, with moderate carbonation.  D/O: This double stout seems to have all the bases covered, but like its peers that also occupy the range of 8-9% abv, it would be so much more impressive if it were not as strong. Hops are apparently not for breakfast, leaving this beer to gather its aromatic qualities almost entirely from the coffee that is quite bold in its sensory profile. It is able to be more than just a one-note coffee bomb, even though coffee is the single most intense quality present. Oddly, there is too much cardboard present for a strong stout that is this fresh.

Creamy, dark, potent, and relaxing.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Head retained perfectly after many sips and stuck to the side as drank.  S: A mellow aroma of chocolate, coffee and oatmeal comes through very nice and balanced. Slight hops smell and a milk smell also make an appearance.  T: Fantastic. Oat foretaste into chocolate into fresh coffee flavor. Extremely well balanced with slight hops.

The most prominent smell is a strong java smell of coffee, with bitter chocolate  T- very strong taste of coffee with some flavors of oatmeal and chocolate as well. Nothing stands out too much other than the coffee flavor, but overall the taste is really good  M- thick, smooth, creamy sums it up.  O- a really good Imperial Stout that isn't too strong like some cough syrup tasting Imperials, but isn't too weak either. Very smooth, very delicious, very strong... it's ma go to brew!

T/M: The creamy oats makes this beer smooth drinking. Wonderful notes of cocoa, coffee and milk, mocha, chocolate chip muffin, buttery notes, cookie dough; balance is present with hoppy suggestions in the finish along with an espresso-like bitterness, as a matter of fact that is dead on the aftertaste in an espresso. Some burnt sugar, pie crust, rum bread.

This beer was less creamy then I expected, although one could not exactly call it thin either. Coffee dominates the taste, although chocolate notes creep in the finish, especially as the beer warms.

Poured with vigor to a snifter glass this thick motor oil black beer generated a one inch tan head that lasted about a minute then disappeared leaving behind a very light lacing. Lots of roasted coffee in the nose, a little bit of chocolate, not much to find as far as the oat. Big coffee flavors, there are some oat flavors now, and the finish has a nice bitter sweet dark chocolate flavor. Coco flavors stick around after the swallow, the body is on the heavier side of medium, with more carbonation than I expected. That was a great stout, tons of coffee.

Smells like a campfire, freshly ground coffee, and confection. Lots of toasty malt goodness floats up as well.  Initially super-smooth on the palate, with the malts hitting up front. This succumbs to a huge, delightful slap in the face with semisweet chocolate, espresso, chicory, and some delicate dairy sweetness. Continues to display these notes proudly as it warms, with perhaps a bit more coffee towards the end.  A winner, this one.

Smell: this stout has a very strong coffee aroma.. smells like a fresh cup of French roast.  Taste: lots of dark roasted coffee with some bittersweet chocolate.. alcohol and oat flavors are present in the finish.  Mouthfeel: like many well crafted oatmeal stouts, the mouthfeel is smooth and slick. Full bodied with a little more carbonation than I was expecting.

The coffee aroma is dominate with a sweet aroma mixed in.  T - A top-notch stout. The coffee taste is dominate initially but as it warms up a mix of chocolate and hops come through. Really creamy. The alcohol is barely noticeable. Not a beer that you want to rush through. Just savor it's goodness.  M - A lightly carbonated beer. On the heavier side in regards to consistency. A creamy goodness coats the mouth.  O - I really liked this beer. This ranks up there with the Terrapin Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout, which I also loved for it's coffee taste.

Rich, but not too much  Full bodied with a really polished and smooth feel. The flavors are deep with more of a focus on the malts and dark chocolate  This was as a great beer.

S: Rich coffee notes are extremely dominant in the nose. Very sharp aroma from a mix of dark chocolate and coffee.  T: Starts off with an incredible touch of oatmeal, then sharp almost bitter chocolate taste, followed up by a lingering coffee bubbly sensation. Yummy! Bitter tasting is balanced out by a milk chocolate taste you would find in a bowl of coco puffs.  M: Wow! Above moderate carbonation makes it really easy to enjoy. Not a dark chocolate lover but can really appreciate how the taste is implemented into the beer for an overall calming balance between the oatmeal and chocolate.  O: Sad this beer is not distributed to Florida. Breakfast stout is in a class of its own. I have not encountered a beer that incorporates oatmeal, multiple chocolate notes, and coffee in such a balanced way.

1199,11757,bramsdell,4.38,"Bought this at a small liquor store in the Capitol area of DC. Popped in to grab a decent 6er for a friend I was visiting and saw this, knew it was meant to be.  A: Rich, creamy. Very dark body with a thick, yet fluffy, white head. When people talk of Guinness as a beer-milkshake, they have clearly never encountered a FBS.  S: Coffee. Chocolate. This is an oatmeal stout, technically, but it's all coffee and chocolate. If mochas smelled like this, I would spend all my money at Starbucks.  T: Better than the aroma. It is truly a breakfast itself. All coffee to begin with, then all chocolate at the end. Honestly, this is the perfect balance for someone who loves both flavors (as I do). The coffee provides a deep roasted flavor, but no bitterness. Then the chocolate swoops in to counter that deep roasted flavor with a sweet - but not sugary - chocolate.  M: Perfect. It is thick and fulfilling, but not so thick as to prevent one from having more than one. There is a thickness in feel but a lightness on the tongue. Another perfect balance struck. It's over 8%, but there's not booze to it.  O: There isn't anything else to say about this beer.

T: A very nice fresh ground coffee flavor with some roasted malt and then a slight chocolate flavor. There is a perfect amount of hop in the finish that lingers with the chocolate and coffee.  M: About as good as it gets. So velvety smooth. Just enough carbonation to give it a little kick. I'd like to try this on a nitro tap.  O: One of the best imperial stouts I've had.

M- The carbonation has died down and this has become more silky.

Smell is deep, rich coffee, oats, roasted malts. Yum. Taste is pretty nice, but maybe a touch below the smell. The oatmeal overpowers the coffee a touch, and it melds into a really, good, but just slightly acrid. The mouthfeel is big, but not quite as creamy as I would have hoped, but I am being picky.

I get whiffs of chocolate as well but this is very forward on the coffee. I'm now understanding why, amongst other reasons, they call this a breakfast stout.  T -- The chocolate comes through more on the taste than in the smell which works perfectly with the coffee. There's no alcohol here whatsoever.  M -- Not syrupy like some impys but not watery either...I like the balance.  O -- This is an absolutely fantastic beer.

It doesn't gain much height and settles to a thick film and ring leaving a bit of lacing behind on the edges.   S: A really nice semisweet aroma comprised of semisweet chocolate and toffee that is balanced by ground coffee beans and roasted dark malt.  Not unexpected and pretty typical, but really well done.    T: The coffee is certainly dominant in the flavor, but the bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt are not far behind.  It starts out slightly bitter from the coffee grounds and the roastiness, and slowly transitions to a slightly sweet finish with chocolate, toffee, and hints of dark fruit.  A touch of alcohol is evident at the very back end, but it's complementary to the flavors of the beer itself.   M: Pretty fully-bodied.  Thick and creamy with a good amount of carbonation.  Really coats the mouth and tongue and leaves them slightly dry after each sip.  D: Really well made beer that shines above a lot of the rest that have the same qualities and complexity.  I imagine it is above others due to the quality of ingredients used, but also due to the balance.  Incredibly smooth and delicious beer that is always a pleasure to have.

Tastes just like an iced coffee.  M- Full bodied and creamy. The taste just coats the palate. No alcohol flavor. Amazing.  O- Certainly a favorite. While it isn't complex, this beer does everything right. It's very much like Speedway Stout in that matter: doesn't do anything revolutionary, but everything it does is done perfectly.

Even on the pour you can see how black it is - maybe the slightest hint of very dark brown during the pour. Dark tan head (1/8"") upon pouring, which lasted for about half the glass before becoming just a ring at the edge. Tiny islands of lace here and there. May be the blackest imperial stout I've ever had.  Smell: Dark roast coffee, piney hops, espresso beans, and maybe just a hint of bittersweet chocolate.  Taste: Dark roast coffee, wonderful malt sweetness to counter the bitter finish, but coffee coffee coffee is the theme of this beer. Like a iced sweetened coffee with a hint of cream, but with all of that rich coffee bitterness shouting out.

Oh man this stuff is smooth and good.  Overall / Drinkability: Well, maybe I should have this for breakfast some day with that very strong coffee flavor. Otherwise, a great after-dinner beer (went well with a few pieces of dark chocolate) but I would bet that this would be really good with diner food or a burger. Or...well - breakfast.

In addition to these odors so special, there are also chocolate milk and some spices.  The freshly ground coffee flavor consists mainly of beer - with also a bit of dark chocolate in the palace - and he gives a good bitterness to the beverage remains in the mouth of a nice way but without making it intrusive. Moreover, the use of oats in brewing the mixture softens and makes it smooth as desired. Making it one of the most imperial stouts easy to drink and enjoy.

As advertized the overall taste is coffee, but not super complex. Like with the smell it’s a very nice black coffee bitterness but not as much toward the finish. It becomes more sweet (like a caramel sweet taste) as the beer warm. It’s a very drinkable stout. A bit warming on the way down, but not in the belly. Very rich and creamy, full bodied, low carbonation. Tastes like it should have a higher avb.

While the coffee is dominant, I get a nice chocolate aroma and a distinctly different roasted malt. I didn't give this beer enough credit the first time I had it.  Taste - Coffee in the front, of course, followed by chocolate primarily. It has a strong coffee bitterness throughout, but finishes pretty clean.  Mouthfeel - Surprisingly light bodied for the ABV. 8.3% isn't that high, I suppose, but still it drinks nicely. High carbonation in this bottle. So high that it almost feels dry in the finish.

Poured into a Dogfish Head Snifter  Pours a pitch black opaque color with a deep tan head which unfortunately does not last long and quickly reduces to a this film. Easily revived with a swirl, this stout is alive, and an occasional swirl keeps everything going. Some lace.  Huge, aggressive, in your face blast of fresh ground coffee beans is the first thing you smell, it’s absolutely intense, then you get the dark unsweetened chocolate, followed by very rich roasted malt, and dark bread yeast. A very complex aroma as the coffee and chocolate battle for dominance.  The flavor is an intense attack of roasted coffee malt, deep rich unsweetened chocolate, thick mouth feel, crisp acidity, just flat out delicious. I want to drink gallons of this. The 8.3% ABV is completely unnoticeable.  Long, extremely rich, mouth coating finish of coffee, dark unsweetened chocolate, and roasted malt.  The overall impression is one of unbelievable richness and intensity, it really doesn’t get much better than this. As always Founders excels in producing dark black ales and stouts. As this stout warms all the aromas and flavors juggle for lead position, and in the end no one element dominates. What a wonderfully complex stout. Tastes like a freshly poured draft.

The bitterness of which coats your tongue on the back corners and makes you beg for more. Great bitter chocolate playing backup to the coffee and some subtle booze in the finish.  Full body and chewy! This is very viscous, velvety smooth and chewy thanks to the oatmeal. Coats the tongue heavily with each sip. Smooth burn on the finish from the booze.  Well done Founders, well done! Once again I wish Founders would come to Texas. This is one of the best stouts I've had to date.

A dark tan , creamy head builds about one finger high. It leaves little lacing after dissipating. The smell is an abundance of coffee, chocolate and roasted malt. Very complex and inviting. The taste is grand! Up front the rich coffee flavors begin a great journey. In the middle dark chocolate adds to the coffee and the roasted malt flavors bring a great balance into this whole composition. There us so much more to this beer than words can describe. Find out for yourself, this is a must drink beer! Very nice viscosity, it runs like oil and is smooth as can be. Now my favorite!!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Chocolate, coffee, ....I even feel like I could smell an aged whiskey.  T - Smooth combination of sweet chocolate a nice bitterness that finishes on the tongue.  M - Thick and viscous feel.  O - I tried this for the first time at about noon just before the start of a football game. I loved it so much that I had to drive to the store to get some more ( I bought a solo to give it a try). This is an incredible stout with so much going on. I would recommend this to anyone...and try it for breakfast!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Rutager,4.72,"Killer extra that was on my wants. Thanks Mikeyv35!  Appearance. Pours black with half a finger of deep tan head.  Smell. Roasty coffee beans and unsweetened baking chocolate. A little molasses too. Smells great.  Taste. Semi-sweet baking chocolate and roasty coffee in a BIG way. A little molasses and a hint of smoke in finish. Really nice.  Mouthfeel. Medium-full body with low, ultra-smooth carbonation.  Overall. Just a fantastic big stout.

1199,11757,Northsider,2.26,"Had this in bottle. I was super excited to try this because of all the great reviews I've heard about it.  Holy jesus christ... ""double chocolate, coffee, oatmeal stout""?! I don't think that's enough...let's try to cram some more crap into this beer! What a flavor overload, and not in a good way. This beer was just way overwhelming for me, and as usual, way over hyped by snob-, erm, beer advocates. This was the most bitter thing I've ever tasted in my life...the taste alone made me almost gag and puke, and subsequent smells from from the glass tickled my gag reflex.  It's just too much of everything in this beer. PASS.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Humulus85,4.67,"Breakfast stout for dinner!  Poured from a 12oz bottle into my snifter. The viscous liquid produced a very nice, khaki, two-finger head. Moderated retention with excellent lacing. Opaque, black color; no light able to get through. Hits all the notes for a great American Double Stout, very nice.  Honestly the best smelling stout I've had. I don't like giving 5s, but I think this one earned it (at least for me). Yes, it has a slightly atypical nose due to the pronounced coffee notes, but I seem to find most Imperial Stouts lacking in something, and I think the coffee filled that gap for me. Some say that the coffee is to much. I think it is perfectly balanced with the rich cocoa and burnt malt. Superb.  The taste is exceptional but I couldn't do a 5. Loads of chocolate and coffee upfront meet with very nice roasted malt in the middle, and all is rounded out with some surprisingly floral hops and nice, warming booze.  Medium bodied, but I would venture to say it's light for the style. Moderately carbonated and silky smooth. Drinks more like a 6.00% than 8.30%. The most drinkable American Double Stout I've had, and I don't see how one could exceed it.  Overall this a truly exceptional beer and probably my favorite Double stout yet (Russian or American). The coffee totally makes it for me, and maybe that is because I am an avid fan of Surly Coffee Bender, but whatever. I really like this beer and Double Stouts aren't my go to style. Totally lives up to the hype and the price, and I now see why they sell out so damn quick. I look forward to Sunday, when I can have one for breakfast.

1199,11757,amcmaho1,4.49,"Big thanks to bpfrush and dudabide for both providing me with fresh bottles of this through separate trades. Fresh 2011 bottle poured into ""Darkness"" snifter...  Appearance: Really beautiful color, obviously very reminiscent of a cup of black coffee...pitch black. It pours with a great mocha colored head, though it dissipates a little quicker than i'd like, but there's some nice lacing going on with that great mocha/khaki coloration. I mainly marked it down to a 4 for the lack of head retention, solely on an aesthetic basis.  Smell: Wow!! HUGE coffee notes right off the bat, along with some powdered cocoa, lots of roast, some tobacco, and a slight sweetness which underlies the more predominant aromas. Very nice integration of different elements here, a lot going on but still a nice coherence to keep the nose focused.  Taste: SO MUCH COFFEE!!! This is exceptional, it holds a great roasted and balanced coffee flavor which is very dominant, with some other coffee-related flavors, like the aforementioned scents on the nose (i.e. tobacco, roast/burnt beans), and showcases the coffee and oatmeal really nicely. I'm simply enthralled with this beer, it epitomizes Founder's ability to construct really complex beers while giving them balance and coherence.  Mouthfeel: Truth be told, I feel the mouthfeel to be a bit thinner than I would have otherwise liked. Like the creepy ""Benjamin Button"" character on the bottle, I wanted something viscous, chewy, and thick. It is those things to an extent, but I still feel it to be lacking a bit; just my personal opinion though. The finish is quite dry too, but that aspect seems to work in the beer's favor.  Overall: Worthy of the hype following it, without any doubt. I've yet to be let down by Founders, and this beer certainly stands out as one worthy of spending some time with. I can't wait to see how this pairs with some french toast...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

This Breakfast Stout, which will now be consumed as a ""good night"" stout, pours very dark, pretty much black with a finger of dark tan head that slowly recedes leaving just traces behind...  I'm trying to dig deeper than just saying ""the beer smells like coffee"" but I am really at a loss for what else to say...this beer just smells like coffee. Not bad but nothing outstanding...  First sip, surprise, coffee! Maybe my palette is not as refined as I had thought, but I can't find any descriptors for taste or aroma, hell even feel and look, than plain old coffee.

The aroma is of coffee, with a bit of a chocolate in the back. It tastes sweet like chocolate and followed by a awesome coffee finish.

1199,11757,Uhlikm,4.15,"Appearance -Jet black with a light chocolate head. The froth dissipates quickly, leaving little to no lacing.  Smell - Sweet, roasty, with subtle chocolate accents.  Taste - A really nice balance of roasted malt with chocolate undertones. A pleasamt bitterness stays on the palate well after the swallow. Every sip is like a piece of melted dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel - Not quite as full-bodied as I would have expected given the appearrance. The thinness of this stout leaves me a little wanting, wishing it could live up to the full and rich roasty, chocolatey flavors.  Overall - A great stout with complex flavors...the front, middle, and backend flavors are well-aligned and flow very well together. Sweetness and bitterness are extremely well-banced. However, the lack of a more silky texture keeps this from being an upper echelon stout...although it is 8.3% ABV, it drinks as a more pedestrian oatmeal stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BizzyQU,4.67,"Wow... bottle poured into Chimay goblet A - A big black stout, small head, good lacing, not important S - a great blend of vanilla, chocolate, and coffee T - Black coffee with dark chocolate syrup, really creamy flavor that lingers in a great way. M - Thick and creamy that goes great with the taste of the stout D - There's how much alcohol in this? really not boozy at all especially when considering the 8.3% abv, all of it is pushed aside by the great chocolate and coffee flavors which only get better as it warms.  One of the best stouts I have ever had, I would love to try this along side DFH Bitches Brew and decide which I really prefer.

A tan head tops it off and fizzles away pretty quick leaving its lacing behind it in a decent supply.  S: Columbian coffee, milk chocolate and granola oh my.  T: This is pretty freaking great stuff. Layers of chocolate but predominantly dark chocolate blend into a fairly potent coffee flavor which carries a good deal of bitterness. The coffee like finish lingers for a very long time sort of the way actual coffee does. Good carbonation helps to divide flavors and makes this stuff dangerously easy to drink.  M: Oil slick with some small carbonation bubbles keeping it lively.  O: Very very good stout, everything about this is pretty much right albeit fairly simple.

1199,11757,DCon,4.72,"Bought 12 fl oz bottle of this from Hair of the Dog on Washington Ave (St. Louis), MO for $6. Poured from the bottle with a Baby on it labeled ""DOUBLE CHOCOLATE COFFEE OATMEAL STOUT"" into a 16oz CockTail Glass and does not have a freshness date like almost all Founder's brews.  Aroma- Double rich and 3X the amount of complexity of any other Double Stout! Starts with a ton of oat and cocoa hitting the nose. Espresso then finishes the aroma with strength that takes you to the coffee house! Slight burnt aroma here but almost all pure coffee/roasted malt characteristics. Can't even begin to understand how they made this aroma happen!  Appearance- Pours almost no head but the ring around the glass is a dark brown color. The body is viscous and a jet black color with no room to see anything in the glass. Great lacing on the sides of the glass.  Flavor- Has a huge cocoa chocolate taste and a light-medium espresso taste mixed in. Very complexed once again but almost too thick and rich to tell much more to qualify as attributes of this stout. Has a bittersweet taste and the dark chocolate is the most interesting part of the flavor.  Mouthfeel- Medium-Full Bodied, Lower Carbonation, Medium amount of Chewiness, and leaves tons of coffee in the mouth. Very viscous in the pour but more velvety and light textured in the mouthfeel.  Overall Impression- Talk about a stout you could pour on top of your Cheerios in the morning! This one is what I was looking for! While still having one in my cellar from my cousin, I'm glad I found this one (and grabbing one of the last 6 they had) to see what this one was all about. So complexed, you could drink this over and over and still get new attributes!

I would definitely recommend this one!!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,TheBeerAlmanac,4.33,"Bottle poured into a tulip  A: Pours a very dark black and lets no light through at all. Medium sized bubbles form a light brown head which barely lingers. It looks incredibly viscous; rising bubbles seem to be fighting gravity just to reach the top, almost like they're moving in slow motion.  S: Smells gratifyingly overbearing: strong wafts of bitter coffee followed up by sweet chocolate and cocoa and just a hint of alcohol.  T/M: Taste is a lot like a great cup of iced coffee: a little bitter and strong with coffee beans, very thick consistency, low carbonation, dark and bitter roasted malts become almost smoky, hints of chocolate near the end and some nuttiness lingering in the finish. There's just enough indiscernable hop bitterness to keep the sweet maltiness from going over the edge. Sweetness is all from chocolate and malt, not fruit, which is very welcome.  It's a great stout and could actually benefit from a bit more strength, but this does just fine.  TheBeerAlmanac.com",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,deadonhisfeet,4.33,"The beer is a sinister-looking pitch black syrupy liquid with a light brown head. The nose has roasted notes, coffee, and chocolate and reminds me of those little chocolate-coated espresso beans people munch on.  Strong, roasted malt flavors with wonderful attributes of bittersweet chocolate and coffee. Super smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a nice faint zing of hops. The coffee and chocolate flavors are very nicely balanced - I don't think either predominates. I also detect a bit of spiciness underneath all that toasted malt - possibly allspice. It is reminiscent of Southern Tier's Mokah, but not nearly as sweet.  Overall, a wonderful drinking experience. Every sip seems to taste a little bit different. As the beer warms a bit, the coffee flavors seem to develop and strengthen a bit, but they never become overly bitter and unpleasant. I cracked open the growler Saturday afternoon and finished it Sunday morning with breakfast. Awesome!  Further notes - I recently had the latest release of this beer (bottled) and realized I had forgotten just how bitter it can be when fresh. What's remarkable is that despite the bitterness, it is still incredibly delicious. It is as if Founders has accomplished with coffee and chocolate in this beer what the great IIPAs accomplish with hop selection and yeast treatment.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S - Chocolate notes hit you up front immediately, then the coffee follows. However, after letting it sit for about ten minutes, the coffee really starts to take over.  T - despite the aroma, I actually got hit with coffee immediately, with bitter dark chocolate finish. As this warmed, the flavors seemed to reverse.  M - I completely expected a full bodied beer, but found the it was medium at best (not that I'm complaining, drinking this beer is always an experience)  One of my favorite beers, and always a pleasure to have.

1199,11757,jsprain1,4.72,"A- Pours a very dark brown. It approaches but does not quite reach black. Head is one finger of espresso-colored foam. Fades somewhat quickly leaving whispy lacing. S- The smell leans more toward dark chocolate than coffee, but both are there in force. There is an underlying earthyness in there as well. T- Whereas in the nose the chocolate was a bit more noticable than the coffee, on the tongue I would reverse it. Dark chocolate (with a lighter but noticable milk chocolate) are definitely strong flavors, but the roasted coffee flavor has a bigger kick. The roasted malt/roasted coffee flavor is extremely powerful on the tongue, and my personal preference is more coffee flavor than chocolate, but that's me. There is a noticable spicy note in the finish, as well as a bit of a hazelnut espresso type note. M- The mouthfeel is rich and full bodied, but it seems to lighten up a bit midsip. The finish and aftertaste are long. O- This is just a tremendous beer that I'm glad I finally got to try. One of the very best stouts, and beers, I've experienced.

Some slight lacing remains on the side of the glass.  S: The nose consists of espresso, cocoa nibs, and roasted malt. There are slight estery alcohol notes present as well.  T: Bitterness of espresso and dark chocolate hit the tongue at the beginning of the sip. The bitterness mellows into a sweet milk chocolate and latte in the middle. There is some slight vanilla flavor towards the end of the sip as some hop bitterness creeps in ever so slightly.  M: This is a full bodied beer with a smooth creamy feel in the mouth.

T/M: Big espresso bite and bittersweet chocolate flavors on the initial sip. Bitter hop-like and chocolate malt flavors. Sweetness comes from caramel and molasses, and the bitterness is from a bittersweet dark chocolate flavor. Nice heavy cream flavors illuminate the light carbonation.

1199,11757,amphion1065,4.46,"12 oz. bottle from 9/6/11 into a Duvel tulip. I popped into a liquor store by my office after getting out of work on Friday, and lo and behold a shipment of FBS had just arrived - how fortuitous. Reviewed from notes.  Pour is a very dark shade of brown, bordering on black. A half-finger dark brown, chocolate-colored head dissipates quickly. Minimal lacing.  The smell is incredibly balanced and supremely well-rounded. There is a lot of coffee, but not the burnt overly roasted espresso aroma evident in many coffee-forward stouts. Instead, this smells much more like a cup of coffee with sweetener and milk. There's a very strong note of milk chocolate, which further rounds out that bitterness. A touch of alcoholic astringency, too.  In order of descending prominence, I can taste: coffee; oatmeal; milk chocolate; vanilla; and caramel. This is a sweet stout, rich with malt and a delicious combination of chocolate and coffee. But while this could easily veer off into ""sickly sweet"" territory, the bitterness of the coffee provides an excellent counterbalance. Delicious.  Per the norm, Founders nails the mouthfeel. FBS coats the mouth, like rich and thick syrup. This is so damn smooth, a real treat.  It's pretty tough to dislike this beer, and it's sad that it's becoming increasingly difficult to find in Boston. I couldn't imagine sitting on these bottles for too long, as the flavors are pretty perfectly integrated right out of the gate and I'd hate to lost that delicious coffee character.

Absolutely love it.  T-Tastes like a dark roasted coffee/dark chocolate combo. Mild hope bitterness comes through in the after taste. Not too bad.  M-Super smooth and easy to drink for an imperial stout. Very nice mouthfeel.  O-This is hands down the best stout I have ever had. Super complex yet easy to drink.

A very dark brown/ black body presented itself throughout the entire poor.  S: I smell a good morning dessert sitting in my glass. Strong aromas of coffee and rich chocolate. Alcohol smell nearly nonexistent. Can practically taste it just from the smell.  T: Just as it smells. Upfront the coffee hits the palate followed with a smooth transition into chocolate. As the beer warms up the intensity and complexity of the chocolate, coffee, and malts become richer and stronger.  M: Light carbonation really makes this beer put forth its richness and smoothness. Leaves the mouth covered in a velvety layer of deliciousness.  O: Another outstanding beer from Founders. Not just the flavors, but the entire drinking experience is enjoyable.

I didn't get the dark chocolates much in the nose, but they are much more present in the taste and feel. Yes, you can vaguely ""taste the smell"" of uncooked cut oatmeal. Definitely has the acidity of dark coffee, tinges the finish a bit; small negative.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the style and has a carbonation bite. I want it to have just a nip more body.

The taste has a strong coffee flavor, but not like most stouts. The coffee flavor isn't like a soft, dessert Frappuccino. It is a fresh, black cup of coffee. Roasted heat, coffee bitterness, with a sweet caramel for balance. The finish has a slight sourness, then fades into a hoppy bitterness; different than the earlier coffee bitterness.  The mouthfeel is smooth and crunchy with thorough carbonation.  Overall, this beer is a gamechanger.

1199,11757,ahq514,4.27,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter. Had this beer twice before, and now finally reviewing.  Pours a jet black color with a solid one finger tan head. Seems to have low carbonation, average for a stout. Decent clumps of lacing stick on the glass.  Ahh, this is what heaven probably smells like. Everything that is advertised on the bottle is present. Strong oats are at the fore of the aroma. This is nicely complimented by the big roasty grains that have a good coffee and slight chocolate component.  Everything in this beer works so well together. A dry, slightly bitter roastiness comes through first which transitions into a smooth, creamy, chocolate, coffee goodness. As it warms, it becomes more delicious. The coffee and chocolate are drawn out even more when it warms. Can taste the coffee minutes after I've taken a sip.  The mouthfeel is pretty good, would love a little bit more body. I've noticed lately that I would like more body on most of the beers I've had, maybe one extremely viscous beer spoiled it for me. Good low carbonation. Very drinkable for over 8%.  Overall this is a really good beer. Not as good as I remember it being the last two times I had it. I remember it being absolutely sublime on tap at Founders. You pretty much have to like coffee to like this beer, good thing I do. Would like a little more thickness in the body. Otherwise its awesome.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Slyjoker87,4.38,"A - Pours out as a dark brown / black. As the last drop comes out, you'll notice a moderate head - maybe a half inch. The lacing is fantastic and clean.  S - Strong chocolate and coffee sent that isn't to harsh. It is a nice opener to the flavor that you're about to experience.  T - Huge coffee and chocolate flavor bursts in the opening. It's like drinking a high quality iced coffee, but with a hint of hoppiness towards the finish to remind you that this - in fact - is beer. If it weren't for the hops, I'd have no idea; the alcohol is pretty much undetectable!  M - Full, flavorful, and thick body makes this smart, very smart. The carbonation is spot on being on the lower side which helps not to distract from the bold flavor.  O - A magnificent stout that is fit for a king.

1199,11757,Jesse14,4.2,Just picked up a 4-pack today. First time trying this beer. The bottles are dated 9/6/11. I don't typically go for a stout but had to jump at the chance to try a highly rated beer.  I don't know all the nuances of a great stout but I know a good beer when I drink it. This is lived up to the hype. It has a strong coffee flavor up front then fades to the chocolate. Finishes with a slight bitterness and lingering flavors. All the flavors are well balanced making it very drinkable.  As you would expect the flavors got richer as it warmed up. I would definitely drink it slow and enjoy how it changes. Whether you're a big stout fan or not this is worth trying. I'll look forward to trying to get my hands on some every year.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,busterthecat,4.42,"Picked up a 4pk for ~13. Bottled date of 9/06/2011. Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  A- Pours a deep velvety brown from bottle. Sits a dark brown in glass. A little mocha head starts to form, but leaves only a slim ring of tiny bubbles. A very gentle whispering of foam stays around.  S- Lots of freshly brewed coffee upfront. Some roasted dark malts and smokey notes give it depth and more substance. A crisp aroma of bittersweet chocolate is in the background. The coffee aroma is quite bold and smells better then what I often drink in the morning.  T- Heavy roasted dark coffee & bittersweet chocolate upfront. A solid smokey quality. The coffee quality is in great harmony with the other flavors. A slight burnt note peaks through in the finish. The flavors really linger well and still have some complexity.  M- medium- big bodied. Robust, but not overpowering. Strong roasted quality and some mellow bitter that lingers on the tongue. Wet, until the very end, then dries. A good feel for a 8.3% stout. Some tingly fizzy feel. Could have a bit more depth.  O- A great coffee stout. Another solid offering from Founders. Been waiting a year to try this brew.

1199,11757,biboergosum,4.15,"A 16oz, Yankee 'pint', on-tap at the splendiferous Oak Cafe in Wyandotte, Michigan.  This beer appears a solid black abyss, with no edges, and one flabby finger of puffy, finely foamy, and somewhat creamy brown head, which leaves a nice array of layered hanging frilly lace around the glass in its rather lazy wake.  It smells of roasted, gritty and grainy caramel malt, bittersweet cocoa powder, day-old exotic coffee grounds, a hint of black licorice spice, and some mild earthy, musty, and floral green hops. The taste is medium dark chocolate wafers, grainy and crackery cereal malt, fairly acrid cuppa Joe, ethereal sour cream, smoked chicory, and some tame leafy, earthy, and herbal hoppiness.  The carbonation is average in its palate-satisfying frothiness, the body a stoic medium weight, and actually quite smooth, with a hint of creaminess evolving as things quickly warm up around here. It finishes off-dry, just, with a neat Coffee Crisp note, and tinted by some lurking and edgy hop character.  Overall - a lovely coffee-forward eye-opener of a big-boy stout, this practically begs for another. Wait, 9% ABV - really? Good god! There will be enough drinking with the extended family later in the day, so perhaps I will reluctantly stop at the one. Sigh.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,MidnightWatch,4.5,"A - Motor oil black, head is very thin, almost non-existant.  S - Coffee, chocolate.  T - Interesting the taste proceeded to get creamier as I got farther along in the beer. It wasn't until the final 4 or 5 sips that I finally understood this beer's genius. Taste was extremely flavorful, yet those final sips felt heavenly. ROASTED malts throughout.  M - This is a sipper. Very thick on the body, as is this style.

The taste and smell are really consistent. It gives you exactly what it promises, a lot of chocolate and a lot of coffee. I'm a fan of stouts, but oatmeal stouts are not my first choice.

I am glad I took the advice. This beer was amazing.  Ap- Looks thick. Motor oil (used) in color. Nice thick creamy head about 1.5 fingers thick. Nice creamy light brown color on the head. This beer looks freaking tasty...can't wait to dive in.  Ar- Coffee and toffee. Some chocolate too. Smells sweet.  T- Sweetness, I am assuming from the oats. Mild chocolate flavor and lots of coffee flavor, especially at the end. Delicous and wonderfully creamy.  M- A little thicker than a medium body but not too thick. Good carbonation.  O- Wow, amazing beer. Delicous, creamy and smooth. Almost makes we wonder how a FBS float would taste with vanilla ice cream??? This beer makes me an instant fan of stouts.

1199,11757,pagejohn,4.95,"Pitch black, very hard pour gets a one-finger amazing looking mocha head.  Coffee, coffee, coffee, chocolate, a bit of roasted malts. Fantastic smelling stout.  Chocolate up front with a very strong coffee aftertaste. A tad bitter but if you are a coffee lover there will be no other beer you want to drink. Scary good.  A little thin, but the taste really makes this beer so no problems.  I wish it was a tad sweeter, but I really shouldn't complain. This is the best beer I've had. I have had KBS & CBS but couldn't get used to the bourbon flavor. To me this just combines coffee and chocolate in an extraordinary way.

1199,11757,jaheussner,4.47,"A: 12oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Even with a hard pour, only 1/2 to 1 finger head forms, pleasantly cafe-au-lait in color. Deep black color. No light comes through whatsoever. No lacing to speak of.  S: Coffee overwhelms everything. Small, small amounts of chocolate, but dark chocolate if anything. A perfect smell for a stout.  T: Again, a ton of coffee with a slight sweetness coming through. Hops are prevalent, but not overwhelming, as is alcohol. The flavor lingers, burnt malt and coffee most of all.  M: Thick, creamy, but pleasantly drinkable. Definitely covers your tongue, targeting the taste buds toward the back.  O: Fabulous. As a Michigander, I'm ashamed to say that this is my first time experiencing this beer. A revelation, truly a gold standard for stouts produced today. If one drawback, the chocolate doesn't come through quite enough, but I suppose I'm just nit picking.

1199,11757,drtth,4.38,"Served in a tulip glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. The 2009 version.  Appearance: As served the beer has a ¾” light brown creamy head that leaves sheets of foam on the sides of the glass as it slowly recedes. Sipping produces some patches of lacing but most of the side of the glass is covered with a sticky layer of foam. By midway through the beer all the foam is gone and the only lacing on the glass is the speckles and legs left behind as the head receded.  Smell: The aromal is filled with the dark chocolate and coffee smells I expected from the name and style.  Taste: The flavors are dark chocolate, dark molasses, and some strong black coffee, all intertwingled with none of them truly dominating the blend.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is full bodied and smooth with light persistent carbonation. The finish is on the long side of medium and begins with the bitterness of the coffee and dark chocolate fading away to nicely dry bitter ending that fills the mouth.  Drinkability and Overall Impression: As for drinkability this is definitely a sipping beer which one wants to spend time with and savor. Each sip follows easily from the last gradually the level of the liquid lowers with never a moment during which one thinks, “I’ve had enough of this one.” My overall impression is that this beer deserves its recognition as an outstanding example of the class. That said, however, I must confess that I’m coming to prefer my stouts with just a touch more sweetness to add to the complexity. I'm also not 100% sold on strong coffee flavors in a stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

This beer has had a lot of hype...had it in the past, but don't remember it very well...  A: Dark, opaque beer with minimal head from a fairly agressive pour. What little bit that's there is tan/mocha in color and there are some legs on it from the alcohol.  S: massive aroma of coffee...black bitter coffee with plenty of bittersweet chocolate to go along with it. Minimal hoppiness and even less of an alcohol presence.  T: Man, VERY tasty beer...high on the coffee/espresso taste...ends dry with a nice bitterness. Good amount of hops actually, but they're nice. This is a phenomenal tasting beer. That coffee/dark chocolate bittersweet taste lingers forever at the end...so pleasing on the palate.  M: full bodied beer, well carbonated for the style...very creamy and frothy...coats the mouth nicely and hugs your taste buds.  O: Awesome beer. definitely lived up to the hype. The hopping in this was actully quite noticable and surprisingly added a lot to the overall enjoyment for me. It complemented that bitterness in the coffee tastes so well. While the sweetness from the chocolate and malts balanced it out perfectly. Other than the average appearance, this was a top notch beer for me...would definitely drink again...now I have to find the KBS and CBS.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Powerful aroma of coffee, roasted malts, and some mild chocolate.

It's wonderful.  The coffee flavors and delicious roasted malts present again and the chocolate is far more accessible in the flavor than the aroma.

I ran around town trying to find as much as I could and was able to stock up on three four packs, and I just recently finished off my last bottle in time for the new batch that just came out. I always kept putting off writing this review until I was able to try a fresh bottle.  The bottle I am writing this review off of is dated September 6, so this bottle is only 11 days ""young"". I poured this one into my DFH snifter to find a body that was black as night with nice one inch tan colored head. The aroma was just outstanding with coffee, semi sweet chocolate and roasted malts, did I mention more coffee and chocolate???  The taste is just exceptional chocolate & coffee upfront balanced well with malt but the chocolate has the upper-hand over the two. The balanced flavors mellow out to a nice bitter aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is great, this one is on the heavy side but it is smooth with the right amount of carbonation as well.  I don't know what else I can say about this beer that hasn't been said already.

T: Not nearly as bitter as something like Peche Mortel, but it's still very coffee-forward. Some dark malts help balance it out, but it's definitely not a sweet stout. Bittersweet chocolate and molasses undertones, with coffee as the center stage.  M: So silky and smooth. Not ridiculously thick like BORIS, but still quite dense, as you can see from the moment you start pouring it. Good level of carbonation - above average for the style.

1199,11757,Smakawhat,4.97,"Poured on tap into a snifter at ChurchKey DC. Listed as brewed with Chocolate, Sumatra and Kona coffee (Aug 2011).  A foamy dark brown dark chocolate big head is produced that sits on a jet black body. It sits... and sits.. and sits. There it is with big retention and aggressiveness in all it's creamy glory. While drinking giant circular sticky rings of lace just coat the glass, leaving a few chocolate looking marshmallow caps in the middle. Just a fantastic looking beer.  Nose just gives the goods. Giant fresh ground ripped coffee beans with dark chocolate notes. Intensely coffee forward, cream, and other glory. Blurs the line for beer, just a mix of impressive creation and hint of greatness to come.  Taste is all that and still a bag of chips. Morning ritual espresso with typical silky texture and creaminess. Chocolate maintains some dark bitter hints that flow without the beers malt, but gets whipped up, almost frothy. Malt backbone almost completely masked in a frenzy of milky thick coffee and chocolate.  I just love this beer to death, and it is more coffee dominant on tap it seems than its bottled brother.

1199,11757,plfahey,4.7,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance-Not inky black, but pretty damn dark, and totally impermeable to light. Head is a deep brown color and forms a smooth, dense cream atop the beer which laces beautifully.  Aroma-Not to be cliche, but it smells like Breakfast. This is the scent that permeates the air when you get out of bed and stroll down to the kitchen to find that someone's put coffee on. So many stouts with coffee added take on a vegetal, green pepper character, but not this-the aroma leads with premium roast black coffee, and a dusting of bittersweet cocoa powder. In the background lies more roasted malt, light hops, and faintest whiff of fruity esters-kind of an earthy fruitiness like some chocolate has.  Flavor-Coffee is quite pronounced, though not as powerful as in the nose, which allows other characteristics to shine through. Roasty coffee blends seamlessly with bittersweet chocolate truffles and cocoa liqueur. Roasted malt and a lightly citrus American hops swing through in the midpalate. Dry coffee grounds and chocolate linger on into the finish with just a dash of peppery alcohol thrown in for good measure.  Mouthfeel-Medium full body with soft, moderate carbonation. Smooth and excellent. Slight warmth on the palate.  I'm not huge coffee fan, but I appreciate good coffee flavors in beer, and this truly takes the cake as far as beers flavored with coffee go.

Previous experience is a thick tight chocolaty brown head. From the time I popped the cap it's been nothing but coffee. After sticking my nose in the glass, I get a hint of bitter chocolate with overtones of oatmeal...but mainly a shit-ton of awesome coffee. The flavor follows the nose well, big sweet oatmeal upfront, with a nice transition to a smooth chocolate flavor fading into bitter chocolate and huge dark roasted slightly bitter coffee.

Dark roasted malt flavors up front that slowly allow dark roasted coffee flavors thru the middle to end. A nice even bitter dark chocolate and herbal hopines from beginning to end that lingers after the finish. Similar to the aroma, mellow vanilla and dark chocolate flavors intensify as the beer warms a bit. The higher abv is only apparent in the warmth of this beer as the intense flavors squash the potetnial booziness. Delicate textures and complex flavor and aromas made this very enjoyable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ridglens,4.4,"Poured from a fresh 2011 bottle. I'll write a quick review, as i've had this many times, and am just surprised i haven't reviewed it yet...  A- Great looking beer. pours super dark black, tiny hints of brown around the edges, but mostly all black. Thick, very dark brown head that leaves an enticing lacing around the rim of the Portsmith snifter. S- damn, founders knows how to put coffee in a beer. tons of roasted dark coffee and loads of chocolate. T- Follows the smell wonderfully, thick malts and deep rich profile.... Loads of super dark chocolate and coffee, damn smooth for the amount of flavor. reminds me of a cool breakfast in November. M- Not the thickest stout, but definitely not thin. I would personally prefer more body, but i like motor oil beers. could hold onto it's car a little better, too, but these are nit-picky (trying hard to find faults in this guy) O- Damn work of art, FBS is incredible, especially in the amount they make every single year. Well done founders, thanks for the brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,cavedave,4.42,"The last of the Founders Breakfast series for me. Mmmm.  A thin light brown head sits atop dark and opaque, black beer. It has a thick look, but not so thick as its cousins. Soon the head relaxes to an almost bare skin and floating bubbly amoebae. A swirl leaves oily bubblets on the snifter.  Semi sweet chocolate, medium roast coffee, and caramel lead a charge up my nose that features lesser undertones of herbal bitter, and roasty goodness. My gosh this smells wonderful.  Woaaahhh, alcohol is front and center in this cellar temp. mustang. It leads a stampede of flavors, bitter chocolate, very roasted coffee, light roast malt, dark roast malt, some clean bittering full of herb and light spice, and a sweet burnt caramel that lasts to the bitter end. Magnificent, what a clean and brutal blast of delicious exuberance!  For style the mouth is a bit thin, but for the flavor profile it is perfect. Any more cling to this bad boy would leave too much roast and coffee on the palate between sips. Not as creamy as CBS (nor as fine and complex a finish), not as strongly bitter as KBS.  What a great beer. Aging might disarm the alcohol a bit, but it also would lessen the coffee. I think 2 things. 1. This is a beer to enjoy fresh. 2. Get some of this immediately. A must try.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Brianjames16,5,"A- Pours a beautiful dark dark brown with a very small amount of head. The lack of head may be because it was sitting in the growler for a few days. Still a great looking beer.  S- The aroma is amazing on this brew! HUGE notes of coco, coffe and roasted malts hit the nose right away. The alcohol seems to be hidden under all these delicious notes.  T- Perfect balance of warm flavors and hop bitterness in the finish. Robust dark coffe blended with delicate subtilties make this big brew a pleasesnt drinker. In the finish im getting some decent hop bitterness. The amazing flavors coat the mouth and hang around. The high ABV is well hidden.  M- This is a big bodied beer with a huge appetizing flavor.  O- A similar experience that I had with KBS but with different characteristics. All positive. Nothing negative. Way to go Founders! Again!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Pours a pitch black with a 1 finger, chocolate head. Amazing lacing left on the sides of the glass. Smells of strong espresso and a mild, sweet chocolate. This beer smells like a coffee shop. Taste strong notes of coffee, complemented with bitterness from the hops and is balanced out by the sweetness from the chocolate. All of the flavors mesh together perfectly.

Mouthfeel is creamy but not too thick, very easy to drink for the style. Taste is smooth and chocolatey upfront giving way to a massive blast of rich coffee flavor and bitterness. Hardly any alcohol is detectable. Overall, one of my all time favorites. Have been drinking it for years but haven't reviewed it until now. Pretty much nails the idea of a breakfast stout and what it should be. Exceptional balance of flavors makes this one utterly delectable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Eriktheipaman,4.55,Pours pitch black with great brown head.  I want to forewarn that some beers with a strong coffee on the nose aren't my favorite. This smells like a cup of strong black coffee that's gotten cold. Breakfast for sure.  The taste is along the same lines. Not as much chocolate as I expected but still makes a small appearance while the coffee takes the forefront.  Overall it is a kick ass beer and think I will go pick up another 4 pack if I'm able to.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Great looking beer here.  S - Good amount of roasted coffee, not that burnt coffee smell that a lot of stouts protrude. This is Grade A premium coffee. Good notes of dark chocolate, some subtle dark fruits, but overall just a great, roasty smelling beer.  T - Oh wow, this beer just has such a robust fullness to it. Tons of that roasted coffee, just like drinking a coffee from a coffee shop. The dark chocolate comes in and provides a little bit of balanced sweetness, it finished with the perfect amount of bitter hops. I'm just blown away by this beer.  M - It's silky smooth, it leaves a little bit on the lips as you drink, even a bit sticky. The bitterness from the coffee and hops ever so slightly dries the mouth, the alcohol is completely masked.  Overall - Superb. Outstanding. I've been blown away by this beer. I have literally nothing negative to say about this beer. Perhaps the mouthfeel was a bit less, but it was miniscule. This is truly a world class beer and perhaps the finest beer I've had the pleasure of having.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,jmarsh123,4.53,"Pours pitch black with a small tan head that dissipates quickly.  Smell is coffee coffee bitter dark chocolate then some coffee and finally some roasted malt.  So yeah it's named breakfast stout for a reason. I happen to like coffee so I love this beer and it's definitely the main component. That's where most of the bitterness comes from, but there is still some roasted malt, chocolate, earthiness and a touch of vanilla to this as well.  The oatmeal makes it almost chewy but it's not overwhelming. Fairly low carbonation.  I look forward to this release every year as it's much easier to grab a hold of than KBS.

1199,11757,MittenBeer,5,"A - The appearance of FBS is exactly what you'd expect from a coffee/oatmeal imperial stout. You could pour this into a coffee mug and it would look like you're drinking black coffee.  S - Coffee, coffee, vanilla, coffee, roasted malt and coffee.  T - Lovely, complex roasted malts and coffees with a bit of vanilla. Taste develops as it warms. I prefer this beer after letting it sit for about 15 minutes. Fridge cold isn't the way to enjoy it. This is low in ABV for an imperial, so there isn't much boozy burn.  M - Very silky. Think about licking a cone of premium dark chocolate ice cream and you're in the ballpark. This isn't like motor oil in your mouth, but it has a nice, light creaminess to it.  O - There is a reason I bought 3 4-packs of this stuff.

Visibly viscous. Smells beautifully of coffee. I looove coffee so this was just a pleasure to stick my nose in. Taste follows wonderfully, body is wonderful in that it is viscous however not syrupy.

T - Has a rich roasty malt flavor with a strong coffee flavor. Also, has this acidic twang to it that I can only guess is from the coffee. Also has hints of chocolate and oatmeal.

1199,11757,nandemo1,4.52,"Poured a deep dark brown with minimal head. As the beer recedes, leaves a small amount of lacing.  Smell and taste are both coffee-centric with a small amount of dark chocolate. Seriously, it's like drinking a somewhat chilled cup of black coffee. Not very sweet, more on the bitter side of the spectrum. Didn't find there to be any alcohol taste or burn, but it did warm me up noticeably after about 3/4 of the glass.  Mouthfeel is somewhat thin for a big stout but it's understandable. If you're waking up and grabbing a beer for breakfast, you probably don't want anything too thick. This isn't your full bodied dessert beer.  Overall, a very tasty brew.

Brew has a bitterness from the dark coffee and chocolate, apparently Founders use Sumatra and Kona coffee in this brew. There really is no oatmeal ""flavor"" that is present.

Founders Breakfast Stout has an agreeable bitterness from the dark coffee and chocolate. Apparently Founders use Sumatra and Kona coffee in their Breakfast Stout. This has a pleasant sweetness that is perfect for mid-morning on Labor Day weekend. The oatmeal taste isn't as prevalent as the coffee making this seem more of a java stout than an oatmeal stout.

Playing: Dan Auerbach–Keep It Hid  A: Pours a deep dark brown, near black and presents a thick espresso head with some sticky lacy bubbles. The head dissipates pretty quickly but leaves an overall beautiful beer to look at. Some tight tan carbonation churning.  S: First smell is a large roasted coffee nose right up front, bitter baking chocolate, sweet, nutty malt and slight charred wood.  T: I wish I could turn the clock back a few hours today and drink this at breakfast. The coffee is so well integrated into this stout, the drinkability is astounding for how heavy it looks. Wonderful aromatic roasted coffee supported by sweet chocolate and well-chosen subtle, yet complimentary hops. Balanced, with just the right amount of sweetness, slightly smoky and smooth. The 8.3% ABV is pretty tough to detect. A quintessential breakfast beer and a pleasure to drink.  M: Medium bodied, and creamy yet bold mouthfeel. Bitterness and sweetness are balanced and the effect of the oats on the overall smoothness of the beer is noticeable.

Alcohol seems very subdued.  M: Moderately dense, rich and very creamy, with moderate carbonation. Leaves a pleasant dry, slightly chalky texture.  O: FBS makes a big impression in all ways. It is intense, very complex and lasting. It helps me understand why there is so much interest in this style and this particular brew.

Has a bitter after taste that is consistent with espresso.  IT taste like bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and a wonderful creamy stout. It has a little too much carbonation for this style. I have had this many times and finally decided to review and for the first time this carbonation issue has shown up. The chocolate and coffee notes dominate though.

A: Pours black with tan head that recedes slowly and leaves above-average lacing. The head itself is shot through with various sized bubbles, giving it the appearance of risen dough.   S: Smells like a cup of coffee made with freshly ground beans and through a French press. Additional aromas include chocolate, roast, rolled oats, and earth.   T: Taste begins with malty sweetness, with chocolate following close behind.  Next comes the fresh coffee, whose roastiness seems to amplify through the finish.  Medium-high bitterness.  Oats are somewhat obfuscated by roasted malt and coffee onslaught. Earthy, rich and organic are words I keep reaching for.   M: Medium-heavy body and medium-light carbonation. The beer flows like velvet across the palate. Gorgeous mouthfeel. May be the highlight of this beer.   O: I took a pass on this beer last year after drinking myself silly on it in 2008 and 2009. I now find Breakfast Stout to be shockingly delicious and drinkable. It is also cheap at $8.99 a four-pack and readily available, when in season. Let the silliness begin again.

Tons of roasted coffee, toasted grains, dark chocolate, and a sweet milky background. Not really picking up any alcohol in the nose. Sweet caramel and roasted bittersweet coffee up front.

Coffee also carries the day in terms of taste, supported by oatmeal and malt. Chocolate is a little hard to pick up on.  As with most Founders beers, the consistency is a bullseye. Smooth, bordering on viscous and syrupy.  Another great drinking experience from Founders. Must get hands on CBS and KBS.  EDIT: Had another Breakfast Stout.

S: Coffee and dark chocolate, some syrup. Smells very sweet and desert like.  T: Really good tasting coffee stout here. I was a bit surprised by the lack of hoppiness in this as I am more familiar with their RIS. This tastes like a bit watered down and sweeter, less hoppy version, I suppose it was a tad disappointing due to the excellence of their RIS. However, it isnt quite fair to make the review a critique based on another Founders brew. Overall, a very sweet coffee based stout. It is very tasty but to me a bit sweet and flat.  M: Syrupy , medium bodied, a tad light and watery compared to what I expected. It really could use some more carbonation to liven it up.  O: Overall, a little flat and sweet for my tastes, but still, a very good beer. A wonderful brunch companion I am sure.

Lacing is great, just sticks to the side of the glass and stays there.  Smell. Huge burst of coffee right up front; the coffee itself is very earthy in nature. Below this there is a nice roasted malt character that gives the smell a nice sort of body. In addition there is an underlying sweetness to this all.  Taste. Starts with a long, lingering, sweet bitterness, that is very similar to a cappuccino. After this there is a burst of sweetness that is kind of like a nice fresh sugar cookie, but still with the coffee overtones. Just before the finish there is a slightly tart element that is added to the sweetness and bitterness. This lingers through the finish.  Mouthfeel. Quite possibly the creamyest beer that I have ever tasted. The mouthfeel melds so well with the flavors that it feels like you are, very literally, eating a full breakfast.  Quite possibly the most accurately named beer that I have ever tasted. Each flavor builds on the palate and becomes the course in your breakfast in a bottle.

S: Like a coffee oatmeal mush with cocoa powder lightly sprinkled on top. Coffee and oatmeal come through much more definitively than anything else. Some black pepper also lays in the background.  T: The nose is pretty much exactly what I get. None of the flavors are as sharp as the nose, though. I'm surprised by how oatmeal dominated this is, I really expected to get a big chocolate punch. Regardless, all of the flavors slide between one another effectively and I find myself frequently reaching for the next sip.  M: Full bodied for the ABV, but the carbonation is less than creamy. Theres a tad of coffee bitter burn on the inner sides of the tongue and the beer seems to hang around a bit in the mouth but I dont find it unpleasant.

Aroma is that of black coffee up front with hints of dark chocolate, roasted malts, and oat. Smelled absolutely immaculate.  Wow! The taste follows the nose. Black coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, and some oatiness. Little bit of bitterness too on the back end. This is just amazing. At 8.3% ABV, there is no hint of alcohol whatsoever. If you like coffee, this is right down your alley. Breakfast in a bottle...  One word...rich. The mouthfeel is creamy, thick, and velvety smooth going down. Definitely a full-bodied brew, but it offers superb drinkability. I had to stop myself from drinking this heavenly nectar too fast so I could savor it, but its just that friggin' good!  Overall this is the best stout, and to date, the best beer I have ever had, period. I have never given a perfect score to a beer on here before, but this one gets it from me. Very refreshing to see a much ballyhooed beer live up to its enormous hype. If you like stouts, drink this. It will change your life forever. Its that good. Thank you to Founders for this amazing take on an imperial stout. Now if I could only score some KBS and CBS...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,MicroBeerMan1980,4.5,"A: Dark black. Head is tan/brown with mild retention and decent lacing around the glass.  S: Miles of malt, milk chocolate, and roasted malts. Wonderful toasted sweet and rich character. A little leather in there.  T: Carob chips and roasted malts are prominent. There's a bright, but subtle coffee flavor. Fine leather and clean malts on the finish. This beer would go very well with a complex cigar like a Padron or a La Flor Dominicana.  M: It's full bodied and rich. It's not chalky or over bearing though. There is a distinct stout aftertaste on the roof of the mouth and back of the tongue.  D: It's about as drinkable as an 8.3% abv beer can be. Smells and tastes great, but will catch up to you after a few rounds. I love it though.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Good amount of lacing.  smell: primarily chocolate with hints of coffee.  taste: very rich, deep dark chocolate taste with the oatmeal texture coming out more as the beer warms up. good carbonation that fuels the mixture of wide palate of tastes. Specifically, the combination of coffee and chocolate is done perfectly.  mouthfeel: can start to feel a little soapy (I imagine because of the strong chocolate presence). for a high-alcohol stout, this is a mild complaint as the beer goes down very gently.  overall: excellent beer all-around. hard to imagine this plays third fiddle to KBS and CBS.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T: Just as the beer is described: double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout. Nothing more needs to be said.  M: Medium carbonation and body.  O: An old, good friend. One of my annual favorites.

I just opened a bottle that could possibly had some age to it. The pour is a beautiful black as night color with a thick brown colored head. The lacing is very nice on this beer. The smell is roasted and super chocolatey! The coffee kind of blends in with the malts and chocolate. The taste is so nice, the flavors are just balanced so well. Chocolate, coffee, sweet dark roasted malts and oats. The mouthfeel is silky smooth with a really nice thickness with a subtle carbonation.

Lacing is clinging for dear life. Full on roast coffee. It's making love to my face. I keep diving in for more. Bakers chocolate is present. A nice sip. Chocolate and oatmeal rounded out with a large amount of roast coffee notes. The chocolate has a bitter finish. A lovely touch.I find myself sipping over and over to keep the flavors in my mouth.

1199,11757,Agold,4.55,"One of my all time favorites. Founders breakfast stout is probably the best readily available affordable stout on the market.  Very dark beer. Pours with a bit of head and leaves some sparse lacing. Very attractive beer. The aroma is huge coffee up front with coco. Mocha coffee aroma on this beer. Could be a little bigger, but I'm not complaining. The beer tastes like a coffee chocolate mild caramel beer. The alcohol lightens the flavors a bit, which is not the greatest, but I am really just nitpicking here. This beer tastes great. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth and viscous. Light carbonation.  Overall, this is an amazing affordable delicious beer. Founders does an amazing job making widely available delicious beers.

Taste: rich coffee with a slight burnt taste that is pleasant. the alcohol isnt as noticeable as the KBS. consistent taste as you move it around your mouth. chocolate comes out a bit later.

1199,11757,spicelab,4.5,"Thanks to Mr Kennedy for sharing this.  Black with a heaving dense coffee-coloured head. Great retention.  Clean and nicely refined roasty aromas of brewed coffee and dark chocolate with a touch of sweet esters.  Much the same but better. Sweetened dark chocolate, used coffee grounds and a Tia Maria liquer character (kudos to bluebetty for nailing that).  Divinely creamy but not at all heavy. Great.  Great stuff. The additions are proportioned so that they complement the base beer without hogging the limelight.  Only had a 100mL sample of this so will certainly do a re-review when I can hook up some more.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Aroma: Fresh coffee, maple and dark chocolate. I'm not sure I pick up on the Kona, but the Sumatra is pretty evident.  Taste: Rich dark chocolate blended with robust coffee and roasted malt. Interestingly, I think the Kona is more evident in the taste. I can't taste the hops but they bite my tongue at the finish.  Mouthfeel: This beer has creamy, thick mouthfeel making for a good sipping beer.  Overall: Breakfast Stout is one of my very favorite stouts. I look forward to it when it comes out each season and I buy enough to last a while.  Eis Igian, Randall",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,polisanl,4.37,Espresso type dark with thin tan lacing around the glass edge. Smells of pure coffee. In the taste you find more coffee and the usual supsects found in oatmeal stouts. The after tatse is huge. I think this is where this stands alone from other coffee stouts that are one-dimensional. A mix of bitter-sweet dark chocolate and espresso style (darker roast) coffee comes out it in the back of the palate. Decent carbonation throughout. Medium mouth on the mouth.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

M-Creamy, smooth, not much carbonation  O-I think this is much better than the fresh on tap I had at DLD.

A creamy, 2 finger chocolate-milk colored head dissipates after a few minutes but leaves a foamy ring around the glass. Nice lacing.  The nose fairly explodes with fresh coffee, big roasted notes, and chocolate. Smells amazing.  And tastes even better. Big roasted malts and a milk chocolate sweetness at the front of the tongue, then in the middle of the palette I get espresso, bitter bakers chocolate, and some floral hops. The flavors just coat the tongue. Finishes with a coffee/hop medley of mild bitterness. Just delicious.  This beer is definitely on the fuller side of medium bodied and coats the palette with big flavors. Low carbonation is fitting for the style. Velvety smooth.  Long has this been my favorite stout. I have not been lucky enough to get my hands on a KBS yet, but it's honestly pretty hard for me to imagine a stout any better than this. A world class beer through and through.

Poured into my duvel tulip at around 50 degrees.  A: Easy pour down the center of the glass provides a finger and half of beautiful tan mocha colored head quickly receding to a finger or less. Very tight bubbles after two minutes a thin head remains. Beer is very dark zero light shines through. 4.0  S: Good god! A coffee/espresso bomb. Super roasty with some chocolate notes behind it. However, the coffee smell takes over and is simply awesome! 5.0  T: This is super smooth getting those strong coffee notes as pronounced in the smell. A little chocolate quite bitter, but very nice. No hint of alcohol. Really I think you could drink this with your morning eggs/breakfast with no problem.

1199,11757,ShanePB,4.05,"Just hitting shelves, I found myself picking up a 4-pack of this already. Today is a surprisingly cooler day, so with dinner I cracked open the iconic 12 ounce bottle. Poured into a globe glass.  A: Deep black body with dark brown hues around the top edges. Creamy, bubbly light mocha head sits atop and leaves a thin retention ring around the perimeter. Some quite sporadic, patchy lacing is left around the glass walls. Imperial Stouts should absolutely look like this, kudos.  S: Bitter roasted coffee beans, bakers dark chocolate, dark chocolate malts, caramel and a dash of cocoa powder towards the end. It doesn't seem overdone on either the coffee or chocolate aspect, nor do the oats impart any dominating characteristic. Just like I'd hope a balanced Breakfast stout would smell like. Founders is on a roll!  T: Immediate but reserved bitter coffee notes come through, followed by a rich chocolate cake flavor. Dark chocolate cocoa nibs and a sweet butter cream frosting elements are more towards the finish of the beer. It's an interesting and really well done play on flavors, however throughout the entire sip you can sense the coffee being a bit too dominating over the other flavors. If the coffee would have receded a bit after its initial presence this beer would be nearly untouchable.  M: Well carbonated, perhaps overly so, but it remains medium bodied. It's not as thick or chewy like I like my Imperial Stouts, so overall for me this is a moderately week mouth feel for the style.  For what it is, Founders Breakfast Stout combines the oatmeal stout base with chocolate and coffee beans quite well. I'm trying not to be too jaded with KBS but I find myself almost craving that little extra something to set apartment another coffee stout from the rest.

1199,11757,zaphodchak,4.2,"Finger of cocoa-cream head with both cream and foam with opaque black body. Not much lacing, but some interesting swirls in the surface memory.  Smells like bitter coffee and super-cacao chocolate, kinda earthy.  Taste has a lot of coffee as well, much more than KBS. That, and the sort of vegetal hop bitterness. Oatmeal rounds off the finish, along with alcohol warmth. Seriously-- all that's missing is bacon and eggs.  Mouthfeel is fine-grained and complementary to the style.  More bitter than its barrel-aged counterpart-- since this is out of season, I imagine it has both developed and toned down the edge of the coffee and any hop presence. Still great.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Appropriately enough, I'm going to enjoy this reasonably early in the afternoon, but what the hell, it is called Breakfast Stout after all.  Pour is tenaciously thick, syrupy and dark. Opaque black with a finger's worth of espresso colored head that exhibits plenty of clinging ability and retention.  Nose possesses heaping helpings of bitter chocolate, coffee, oatmeal and a slight zing of wood chips. The year or so of aging on this has completely nullified any scents of alcohol that might have once been present.  A meal in a glass: creamy milk chocolate, dark roasted coffee, some smokiness, savory oats and a lingering mild citric note. All are able to coincide together, creating a complex, yet delectable balance. The favors' nuances become even more pronounced as it warms.  Monumentally thick and chewy, full bodied and viscous, velvety and buttery smooth, this is what an American stout is all about. Absolutely phenomenal!  All I can say is that I was not disappointed by this beer in the least. For a change, this is a beer that actually lives up to all the hype that has been bestowed upon it.

It displays good retention and leaves some nice lacing.  Smell: The nose here is just fantastic. There is a ton roasted coffee, alongside dark chocolate, cocoa, oatmeal, sweet dark caramel, some dark fruit and a touch of liquorice.  Taste: The flavour is not quite a full as the nose. Dark, roasted coffee beans dominate the flavour, with chocolate, cocoa and some roasted notes also present. Dark fruits, dark caramel and some molasses become apparent as the beer warms. The finish is quite roasted, with a distinct coffee character and a light dryness.

Very sticky lacing.  S: Deep dark roasted coffee. Light notes of dark chocolate. A light smokiness. No burnt aromas which is pretty nice. Some vanilla notes. Very light oats. And yes, I do detect some freshly tanned leather.  T: Sweet chocolate upfront. Then taken over by the bitter dark roast coffee. Big roastiness, with that light smokiness. Oats and vanilla in the aftertaste. Sort of hot for only 8.3%.  M: Full bodied. Very thick and creamy, no doubt about that. The alcohol burn fades fairly quickly, leaving just a hint in the back of the throat. But the oaty, vanilla, coffee roastiness lingers for a while longer, allowing you to enjoy between sips.

Dark Roast coffee, slightly smokey, dark chocolate and an ever so slight hint of leather. This is what heaven must smell like.  The taste is unbelievable. So many flavors, heavy on the coffee and chocolate, with that smokiness again. There's a little black licorice in the background. Every sip intensifies the flavors as this elixir of the Gods coats the tongue.  The mouthfeel is very pleasant. Slightly peppery from the carbonation, but mouth-coating as any viscous RIS I've ever had.  This is hands down the best beer I've ever tasted.

1199,11757,SubpoenaDeuces,4.25,"Founder’s Breakfast Stout 8.3% abv  A: This beer has a great gentle coating to it with minimal lacing. It seems to impart the message that, “hey fellas, I will be here for a lil bit, don’t mind me,“ and then resigns itself to a deep cedar blackness, waiting to be beckoned. The oats in the stout gives it a great stickiness and foamy character without excessive carbonation.  S: The smell feels like a gentleman’s breakfast: initially you get some nice smoky notes from a bacon or charred grist if you are a yeoman farmer, then comes coffee with a great mild nature, it isn’t that jerk coffee from Surly, this is more understated. The coffee notes are like jokes on Arrested Development. Ultimately, the chocolate notes emerge and as your mouth forms a tight “o”, the Nickelodeon prophecy comes true: COFFEE, BACON, and CHOCOLATE FOR BREAKFAST.  T: except you are an adult and you, hopefully, don’t drink this as your breakfast shake. If you do, don’t let me judge, alas I digress. This has an amazing silky mouthfeel with ::coughsatincough::: chocolate notes upfront nice and nice coffee notes to round it out.  M: There is a nice, albeit, mild sticky lacing with great coating and the oats give it this awesome maltiness that makes it a force to be trifled with. Get your trifle on, become trifling. But seriously, this aspect gives old KBS a serious run for his money if only for how pleasant it reclines and makes itself at home. The mouthfeel is like a Shins albums and a warm blanket wrapped around you. It is hella comfy.  D: Let’s just get right down to it. This beer has no abv present that I cant detect.

I have not been let down by anything I have tried from Founders.  A & S- Dark and decadent. Nice mocha colored head. The smell is outstanding with dark rich chocolate and coffee and vanilla notes.  T- Wow, this is an amazing beer. A little more coffee forward than I usually like but so well balanced that it really blends together well. Great coffee, chocolate, vanilla and tobacco.

Nice silky looking pour, jet black in appearance with a tan coloured head of foam that builds up after the pour and sat at half a finger in height and settles as film pretty quickly.  Amazing ever-changing aroma, starts off which cereal and oat with even a touch of milk which made me pretty well beside myself. Coffee then comes through and chocolate is the last to make an appearance.  Taste is mainly coffee upfront with chocolate working well with it later on to balance it out well. So a bit of bite early from the coffee and the smoothness which follows is a real treat.  Booze is very well hidden in this, lovely velvety mouthfeel at the finish, while a bit of spark earlier helps ensure that this is no one-trick pony in this regard.

1199,11757,Moon2Goddess,3.16,"Color:Identical to a dark roast coffee, deep mahogany, completely opaque.  Head:The second pour at a warmer temperature elicited a better head an inch or more high. Texture is incredibly creamy, like half-n-half.  Aroma: Pleasant, but weak. Mostly vanilla, coffee and chocolate.  Texture: Sexy. A truly viscous consistency, ultra smooth nicely coating your mouth, the silky layer lingers on the roof of your mouth long after you have finished. If it were not so bitter, it would seem luxurious. If only the bitterness did not force me to swallow, I would hold it in my mouth forever!  Flavor & Balance: Flavor is divergent; coffee to whiskey to licorice to beer to coffee again and finally oatmeal a full minute after swallow. As it warms, however, it is like drinking a cold, double batch of over-roasted, bitter coffee. If I paid for a cup of coffee, I would want it to taste better than this. Completely lacks any butter-nut or rich, warm qualities, it is bitter through and through. The chocolate additives separate from the beer and seem to settle to the bottom, like an unstirred espresso drink. Tasted best when it was freshly cold and exhibited pronounced licorice accents.  Sustained Taste: Loses varied flavors over time and becomes simply coffee and very dark chocolate--chocolate flavor does not even vary. Would probably be best with a cookie or biscotti to offset the bitterness. Not a good stand alone beer. Wish it had a more pronounced beer flavor, or a higher alcohol content to make it worth drinking the whole bottle. I don't even feel a buzz and I am looking for a piece of gum.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,mulder1010,4.25,"Year old Breakfast Stout. Bought last year at Binny's in Chicago and been in my Denver cellar.  355 ML bottle into a wine glass  A-- Poured black, maybe a hint of red here or there. Looked fairly oily in the pour as well. Excellent looking head. Looks like a root beer float. Brown Sugar and mocha colored head. Good texture to the head. Settled to under a finger of head but left a huge ring of lacing on the side of the glass.  S-- Sweet smelling roasted coffee, brown sugar, rolled oats, and molasses. has the smell KBS has of old and cold cowboy coffee that was excellent, just no bourbon and oak. Closer to Speedway Stout but toned down.  T-- Oatmeal, molasses, and brown sugar. Highly carbonated and very tingly in the taste. Coffee is more apparent in the back of the mouth.  M-- Coffee comes out in the back and in the feel. Very large coffee taste in the back. Molasses, oatmeal and sugar front. Very carbonated and lively but smooths out and carbonation does drop some in the back. Finishes very oat dry like eating oatmeal out of the can. Could use a touch of vanilla.  O-- Honestly was not fond of this last year so left my last two in Denver. Age has helped this immensely. Far more rounded and has so much character it is crazy. No booze at all to this. Taste the ingredients and the balance between them all is excellent. I gave my other one away??",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,DrewV,4.35,"4-8-12 Review update: After almost a year of age on this brew, the flavors have melded with precision, yielding an amazingly well-balanced malange of coffee and roasty malts. None of the off-putting armoas remain; there is only a deep, dark roastiness left to support the somewhat thin body. Adequate carbonation washes the palate with waves of dark flavors. Still a big beer, but a bit more restrained after some age. I almost wish I hadn't drank as many of these last year when they were still ""unripe"". Now, with some age on the bottle, this brew is simply spectacular.  ---  Original review:  Poured from a bottle (no date) at around 50 degrees into a snifter.  A: Charcoal black with a 2-finger mocha-tan head. Looks delicious.  S: Whoa! Where to begin with this one? Heavy with some sort of sweet-ish coffee aroma (Kona/Sumatra??) which could be the oats as well, I'm not really sure. Not offensive, but it is slightly off-putting. I can detect some chocolate in there, as well. Lowest marks here, not due to offensive aromas, but rather aromas that just don't smell good to me personally. Sorry guys.  T: Much better than the aroma. A solid roast coffee, chocolate, and some molasses flavors hit the palate. Extremely dark roasty flavors. The chocolate/oaty flavors penetrate through the coffee to provide complexity. Just huge flavors here.  M: Creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel. Fine carbonation adds to the creaminess. Semi-oily mouthfeel suits the beer well.  O: This is one huge stout. The 8.3% ABV shows up early and sticks around for a while. The deep roast coffee/chocolate flavors attack the palate with unrelenting abandon. One of the heaviest Imperial stouts I've ever had. Well done, Founders! A solid A-rated brew here, brought down a notch only by the wierd aromas.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Poured deep black with a thin layer of brown head that cascaded just a bit. Minimal lacing on the glass. Smelled strongly of mocha with a hint of fruity sweetness. Tasted chocolately sweet with a large dose of coffee bitterness. Didn't have a very heavy mouthfeel- a little watery with little carbonation. Bitter finish with a slight lingering sweetness.  This may be one of the shortest reviews I've written, but it's simply too good for words. IMO, a perfect beer in a style that I consider to be my favorite.

I love Kona coffee, and although I like to think I can pick out the characteristics of the Kona beans in this beer. It was delicious, and the chocolate steps up to back the coffee well.

Possibly the most present (and pleasant) coffee/chocolate aroma of any beer I’ve had. I want to drink it NOW!  T: Wow…amazing! Where's the alcohol?

1199,11757,axeman9182,3.74,"On tap at the Rattle n Hum's Founders event. This one was served in an 8oz goblet.  Founder's Breakfast Stout pours an unflinching black. The tan head is on the small side, and the foam leaves a little bit of lacing stuck to the inside of the glass. The nose smells like I'm at work (candy shop) and just too a whiff of the jar of chocolate covered coffee beans, it's a spot on blend between coffee and milk chocolate. That balance isn't maintained though, as drinking the beer I have a hard time finding much chocolate at all. It's not quite drinking cold coffee, but it's disappointingly close. The mouthfeel is everything I've come to expect from Founder's Breakfast Stout beers. The beer's got a supremely rich and full body, with the smooth texture that oats contribute, and it's paired with a perfectly subdued carbonation that manages to stay out of the beer's way. I don't know if it was just being consumed at the same time as KBS and CBS, but FBS just didn't impress me as much as those two (and the imperial stout) did. As far as breakfast stouts go.

1199,11757,ExtraStout,4.62,"12oz stubby screw-top brown bottle, cryptic notch indicating an October bottling date.  Pitch black body - even when held up directly to a light. Not quite 1/2"" thick head, almost black, certainly one of the darkest heads I've ever seen. I'd dare say there's even some purple highlights to it. Retention is poor - after a couple minutes there's nothing left but a paper-thin sheet of bubbles. But surprisingly, this leaves gorgeous solid sheets of lacing all over the place. One of the strongest-smelling beers I can remember - easily noticable across the room. Assloads of chocolate, make that dark chocolate, none of that wussy milk chocolate here. Dark roasted malt, and a bit of coffee in there as well but it's not as prominent as I remember.  Starts innocently enough, with a light sweetness and soft chocolate notes. But soon enough, it gets big and bad. Intense coffee bitterness in the finish. Moderately-high hoppiness, of the earthy/herbal type shows up in the finish as well, and meshes with the coffee quite nicely. Malts are super thick - only a few sips and already my lips are sticky sweet. It's really an amazing beer - starts with all that malt and chocolate sweetness, and then seamlessly transitions to a big coffee/hop bitterness. A bit of that oatmeal smoothness as well, which really brings everything together and keeps this from going ""too far"" into the extreme beer world.

1199,11757,matttttYCE,4.67,"12oz bottle poured into my Deschutes snifer glass. Another thanks to azdback for this one. This is one that I've definitely been wanting to try. Normally I won't review two beers in a night, but since both tonight are coffee oatmeal stouts I figured it would be good.  Appearance - Aggressive pour yelids a beautiful pitch black beer with an inch high tan /light brown head. Bubbles are nice and smooth/creamy looking almost as if it were nitro. Head recedes fairly quickly but leaves a thin film of a bubbles on top and a good ring around the edges. Some decent lace left on the glass but not a lot.  Smell - Mostly of light, sweet chocolate and roast malts but then I get that coffee smell and I'm wondering how I didn't notice it initially. It's definitely there. Seems like the Kona coffee has a bit more of a distinctive smell and I like the combo of the Kona and Sumatra in this brew. The smell makes me want to eat lots of rich chocolate and I'm not even a big chocolate/sweets person. I think if this didn't have the chocolate in there, it wouldn't be nearly as fantastic smelling. This warrants a 4.5 smell rating!  Taste - Impressive right off the bat! Very much as the smell suggests, but the first thing that pops out to me is the chocolate. Again, if this beer hadn't been brewed with chocolate I think it would be severly lacking. With that said it tastes balanced like its a near perfect blend of the ingredients for a ""double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout"". Next I'm getting the roast and chocolate malt flavor and the coffee is good with a little of that coffee bitterness. Also in there is smoke and a bit of smooth nut flavor and a little bit of smooth oak or vanilla (as others have suggested) that I get the finish. I was hesitant at first, but after sipping on this more I had to edit my review. This one deserves a 5.0 out of 5.0 for the taste!!  Mouthfeel - Very smooth drinking. Is it silky smooth? No, but that's expected for a Double/Imperial Stout. Nowhere near chewy but it's a bit syrupy and coats the mouth oh so well, leaving you with the taste in your mouth for a good while that either allows you to drink it very slowly or makes you want to sip faster to keep that mouth completely coated and enjoying it all! Mouthfeel rating? If you didn't look alraedy, you could probably guess what I feel it warrants.  Overall - The name is PERFECTLY fitting. If I had better access to Fouders stuff, I would actually be really likely to drink this for breakfast every Saturday or Sunday morning! And I'm hardly a coffee person or one who really ever thinks about drinking beer/alcohol in the morning. So I think all I have to say is kudos Founders and I can't wait to try KBS!

1199,11757,BarryMFBurton,4.57,"I feel like it’s been too long since I’ve had a Founders. Oh wait, now that I check, I actually drank and reviewed their Porter eleven days ago. Well, too long in my book! At any rate, this one has been long overdue. Founders was my first craft love, and it’s a shame it’s taken me so long to have their famous Breakfast Stout. It's all good now, though; I just cracked a bottle, and I'm pumped.  A: Extraordinarily syrupy, pouring almost exactly like black coffee. The head is dark reddish-brown – thin and barely there, with some sexy lacing. Looks thick and bold.  S: Wow; smells like coffee, too. Roasted malts are huge, throwing bitter, smoky tones straight to your sinuses. Dark chocolate is big as well, sending the nose to a striking alcohol finish. This just screams aggressive, forward, and complex.  T: That roasted malt flavor – it’s remarkable. The smoky and bitter tones blend perfectly with the chocolate, giving it a very coffee-like feel. Ah, and the great hop quality I have always appreciated from the boys in Grand Rapids – earthy, yet enjoyably bitter. A vanilla and hazelnut presence ups the sweetness factor a touch, just as a bit of alcohol swoops in with even more intricacy. The finish is dry and oaky, but not so much that it’s unsatisfying.  M: A good feel – smoothly drinkable. Not as velvety smooth as the pour implied, but still good for the style.  O: Now for the moment of truth: was Founders Breakfast Stout everything I thought it would be? Well, it wasn't a life-changing experience, but it was definitely a good drink – I especially enjoyed the mellow hop notes mixing with the bitter roasts. Nice and complex, with even better balance as it warms. Still not my favorite Founders offering, but a superb example of what an American Double Stout can be with careful attention. Can't wait to try CBS and KBS!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,philly224,5,"A: Very dark color, lets no light through. Head dissipates fairly quick.  S: Strong coffee and chocolate scent. One of the best smelling beers I have ever had.  T: Coffee, coffee and more coffee! Even after 5 months the coffee flavor is still very strong.  M: Very thick, taste lingers for a while after each sip.

Very nutty, little dried fruit presence. T: So much coffee and toasted nuttiness. Very roasted, very malty. Almost too much of a coffee flavor. M: Leaves throat fairly easily. Does not stick to mouth very much. D: Very good - drank with a slice of apple pie, which helped tame the coffee taste.

Toasted coffee & touches of chocolate on nose. Gentle upfront, dry nut bitterness & subtle sweetness. Coffee & traces of chocolate, once again, on the aftertaste. High carbonated, repeats on. Unfortunately froth doesn´t last, quickly dissipated lacing. Final sensation is a little disapointing.Fairly bland overall.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,CharlieMurphy,4.52,"Big thanks to nhindian for including this as an extra. Really looking forward to it.  A: opaque brown tinted black with just a coin of brown head.  S: Smells of booze, oak? (almost a hint of bourbon) from afar. Getting in close and it's strong coffee and some really delicious smelling cream, and roasted malts, but still a significant amount of booze.  T: Lighter and more balanced taste than I was expecting, not a bad thing just not what I was expecting. You can taste the oatmeal that you couldn't smell. Probably easily the most well balanced and smooth stout of this nature I've had yet. Slightly sweet on the finish, and less coffee (not strong either) than in the nose. The longer I let it linger before I sip again, the more enamored I become with this beer.  M: This is like drinking silk. So so good.  O: Perma-want.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,bylerteck,4.54,"Bottle at Beer Temple in Amsterdam. From notes.  A - Poured black of course. One finger tan head on top with no visible carbonation. Sweet foamy lacing on the sides and a film of retention going down.  S - Smells EXACTLY like coffee. This is cool. Extremely roasty and some chocolate notes there too but that coffee is what dominates in a huge way. It's not like coffee has been added though. It's a rich, coffee bean aroma like smelling a big bag of them. So nice.  T - Probably the best coffee stout I've ever had, or close to it at least. Captures the coffee flavour perfectly so it's like I'm tasting the aroma of a coffee bean. Perfectly roasty and lot's of chocolate in the finish. The coffee element is so stunning and lovely. Well done Founders.  M - Mild to medium carbonation with a full body and the chocolate finish that turns to a nice bitterness that isn't too aggressive.  O/D - What can I say. This was a great beer. Very well crafted and made to be what they planned for. Tons of coffee and chocolate on purpose and it works well.

Thick rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of robust coffee, dark chocolate, and some roasted oats. Taste starts with rich coffee followed by cocoa powder and the oats. Slight cocoa nib bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer is on the thicker side with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel even with a low level of carbonation.

1199,11757,pmarlowe,3.95,"Tulip glass.  Pours like a darkly roasted coffee. A finger and a half of dark tan foam, with decent lacing. Smells like roasted malts plus breakfast: coffee, creamy oatmeal, a tinge of chocolate. Chocolate is more prominent on the palate, with more coffee. Carbonation is medium, body is medium-light with some creaminess from the oatmeal, with the alcohol barely noticeable. Overall, a tasty everyday stout.

1199,11757,4DAloveofSTOUT,4.25,"had this on tap at Oasis Micropub in Rockford; review from naotes on 5/5/2011.  poured into a mug by bartender.  Appearance: dark black with a tanish brown head. Thick and sticky lacing clings to glass.  Smell: Super fresh premium roasted coffee and oatmeal.  Taste: A nice rich and deep coffee note with dark chocolates and oatmeal blending so subtly with this beer. Mild bitterness imparted in the aftertaste from the coffee notes that carry through from beginning of taste through to the end.  Mouthfeel: Thick, viscous, and chewy. Carbonation is on the low end of moderate. Excellent brew here that they pegged the mouthfeel!  Overall: Another fantasic stout from Founders, the high expectations from this brewery are kept intact with ease.

1199,11757,TenHornsProud,4.37,"Pours like sludge, pitch black with a tiny amber head that dissipates instantly (probably from the coffee).  Smells of coffee and dark malt. Really though, the coffee takes over here. Like coffee mixed with sweet oatmeal, almost chocolate milk esque.  Tastes like quality coffee with hints of dark chocolate, some grain/oatmeal character in the back...small dark-malt astringency. Slight hop spice adds a layer of complexity. Overall the taste is all about the coffee and accenting it.  The mouthfeel is fantastic here. This beer is viscous and creamy, almost milk-like.  This is a great stout that really emphasizes the coffee flavor. The other, complexities are subtle (chocolate/oats) that only emphasize the creamy-coffee aspects of the beer. I've had more complex and interesting stouts, but this beer really is unique and all too drinkable.

The smell is intensely coffee heavy. I get more of that than anything else. The roasted malts and chocolate seep through afterwards. I picked up some booze and vanilla as well.  This beer tastes like alcoholic coffee, and I can tell there was a lot of love put into the making of this thing.

S - Coffee and chocolate dominate the nose. Just what a coffee stout should smell like.  T - A benchmark beer for me in regards to the style. Coffee, chocolate, a tiny bit of caramel, and a great malt forwardness. I could see myself literally having this for breakfast with a stack of Belgian waffles and maple syrup.  M - Great medium/full mouthful & carbonation. The coffee is the star and really sticks around in your mouth once consumed.

Thing clingy ring of bubbles around the outer edge with a tiny bit of lace.  S-&gt; Whoooosuh! Sinus clearing alcoholic dark chocolate and roasted grains with some toffee. Bouquet is rather complex and very bold.  T-&gt;Wanted to let this warm up and breathe a bit before I tried it but the first few sips are extremely dark, velvety chocolate with some bitter coffee and roasted malts/grains. Flavor really seems to linger on the tongue and throat with a slight blend of bitter burn that is by no means unpleasant. Really a lot going on here with the chocolate and malt sweetness, not too much of the flaked oats as they are likely overpowered by the coffee and bitter chocolate. Bit of warming alcohol and a slightly acidic (hop?) bite. Delicious balance of everything that is happening in here. Getting some oak-ish flavors and some molasses hints as well. Still discovering more and more as this gets warmer and warmer...  M-&gt; Full-bodied for sure. Like bitter chocolate velvet going down with a nice coffee aftertaste that hangs around pretty extensively. Creamy, velvety, smooth, sweet, bit of carbonation but the perfect subtle amount makes this a wonderfully balanced stout.  O-&gt; 2x chocolate + coffee + oatmeal = one amazing concoction. It's as if a new layer of flavor complexity is peeled back as this progressively breathes and gets warmer. A fascinating spectacle to experience.

The body is an oil black with no noticeable traces of color even when held to light. Thick lacing attaches itself to the glass like barnacles to a sunken ship.  Dark chocolate and roasted coffee bean aromas jump off this beer as soon as the cap is removed from the bottle. The smell is both bold and enticing.  The flavors follow the nose well. Dark chocolate and roasted coffee jump at you first. Then a dark roasted malt comes out of hiding. A nutty, dry coffee aftertaste finishes each sip nicely.

I got to say this is some very fine beer. The pour resulted in a medium brown two finger head with lots of clinging lace. The color of this brew is black, a 40 on the SRM beer color chart. I think this is the darkest beer I have had. Sort of looks like used motor oil, and has some of the clinging effect. Smell...wow, almost like a chocolate bar in liquid. There are aromas of chocolate, coffee, molasses, toffee, and cooked oats. Flavor is intoxication at room temperature. I taste milk chocolate, caramel, coffee, toffee, malt, molasses, and chocolate... oh I said that. Mouthfeel is like heavy cream and silk. Very rich and thick, with zing.

More semi sweet chocolate than bitter on the tongue, slightly bitter and slightly sweet, a bit of coffee, light roasted malts. Finishes with more chocolate on the tongue and a bit of alcohol warmth.

It takes a couple of minutes for the head to fall and leaves a small crown floating on top of the beer.  Smell is coffee and dark bitter chocolate. There is a faint roasty malt smell lying underneath, but it is difficult to detect.  Taste is much the same as the smell, roasted coffee, roasted malt, and dark bitter chocolate. The flavors blend very well together and compliment each other. The malt backbone is present, but the coffee and chocolate really come through. The finish is much the same as a cup of good black coffee.  The mouthfeel is excellent, rich, creamy, and smooth. The carbonation is there, but it is very subtle. The consistency is thick, just like a stout should be. Very nice beer to sit and sip.  Overall, this is a very good beer. Smooth, silky, creamy, coffee, and chocolate. The only downside, in my opinion, is the bitterness. I feel that the beer is a little too bitter. It's not a hop bitterness, it's a acidic bitterness from the coffee and the dark chocolate. Remove that bitterness and this is a better beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S - Unlike the KBS in which chocolate and bourbon dominate, coffee and slight chocolate undertones are at work here.  T - Very smooth for a stout. Similar to the aroma, coffee beans and dark chocolate are the stars of the show. Slight sweetness is present, but it is overwhelmed by the coffee and hoppy bitterness.  M - Uh...feels great in my mouth! The coffee and chocolate really soothe and coat the tongue in a way that most stouts don't. The aftertaste fades pretty fast making you all the more eager for more.

1199,11757,OddNotion,3.7,"Decided to pick up a 4 pack I saw in a dark fridge, wanted to see how it was with a little age on it. Bottled on: 9/24/2010  Appearance: Poured into my Sierra Nevada 30th Anniversary bulb glass. Pours with a 1 finger frothy looking khaki colored head. During the pour the beer looks more brown and ruby than black but once it is in the glass no light can penetrate.  Smell: As soon as I popped the cap on the bottle, about 3 feet from my face I could smell the coffee! It was very pungent. Upon further sniffing I catch the chocolate. The strength of the scents is a little subdued compared to fresh Breakfast Stout, but they are really not shy here.  Taste: A lot of the coffee flavor has disappeared, as compared to it fresh. More noticable chocolate but most likely only because of how much coffee flavor has disappeared. There is a very slight sourness on the back end of the sip, I dont want to call it sour, maybe a little tart? Very subtle. I will certainly re-review this one fresh next year.  Mouthfeel: Nice and smooth and creamy. The creaminess is a great feeling and perfect given the style.  Overall: More chocolaty then when fresh, and I love chocolate stouts, moreso than coffee stouts. However, I think this beer is best enjoyed when fresh, or at least within the first 3 months after the brew date.

Drinkability: This is a very delicious brew, and could easy drink a couple of these.  Notes: This is a seasonal brew (Sept-Dec) from Founders which I was fortunate enough to try both in the bottle and on tap. Brewed with imported chocolates along with kona and sumatra coffee, this is a coffee-lovers stout. This is a pretty easy to find brew in the South Bend-Mishawaka-Elkhart area, and certainly worth giving a try.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

A. Black no light through this one at all,1 finger light tan head that dissapates rather quickly.Leaves no lacing on my glass.Carbonation is decent with agressive pour but leaves quickly.  S. Coffee bomb! Tons of coffee that fills the nose,also lots of milk chocolate after the extreme coffee. Getting some oats in the back,I don't get much more in this one.  T. What you smell is what you get here. Spot on with the smell,lots of coffee,chocolate,oats and some biterness in the end.Alchohol is very well hidden.  M. Nice medium feel very smooth,nice semi heavy feel on the tounge,little carbonation stings the pallet.  Overall I love this beer! It's one of my favorite easy abtained beers.I just can't get enough of the over the top coffee and chocolate in this.I will say between the two,Breakfast stout and Wake and bake,Both the two best I have tried in there class, Founders is the one I prefer.I recommend doing the side by side if you can.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S: Tons of perfect coffee and dark chocolate. Oats and a mild sweetness that I cant identify - maybe molasses?  T: An excellent ride that begins with a smooth but powerful roasted coffee flavor. Huge dark chocolate and more coffee. The sweetness really comes through in the middle and I get flavors of oatmeal and roasted malts then back to coffee. Dry finish with a nice mild alcohol warmth.  M: Full and bordering on chewy but not there.  O: Excellent execution. Nearly perfect. I liked how dark and roasty this beer was.

Definitely a reason to make you want to get up and have a beer.  M: Thick and smooth - just as you'd expect. Almost creamy.  O: One of my favorite beers in a while. Really great flavor and smoothness.

1199,11757,azdback,4.3,"Thanks to BgThang for this extra. Poured into my Surly pint glass. Deepest of space black. No highlights at all. I tried to pour this a little aggressive but sill only ended up with a one finger coco colored head. Didn't stay around long either.  The smell is dark roasted malts that come out as a coffee smell (imagine that!!??) Some sweetness and I kinda just caught a hint of ash or smoke? No alcohol really present. As it warmed I was able to get some dark chocolate smells.  Oh the taste is definitely smokey. The coffee flavor is so roasted I think I'm getting just smoke. Don't get me wrong, the coffee taste is good but I think a little over roasted. I can't get much chocolate, or anything else to be blunt. Wow.. as this warms it is becoming much better. Mellows out quite a bit. Roast calms down a ton. Getting a bit of a tart taste too. Warmth is good!!  The mouth is very silky and luscious. Quite soft and full, but like the rest of the review, this one is much better left alone for 20 or so minutes. After it warmed up a bit it became even more rich and silky. Alcohol warms the throat and belly.  I was initially not very happy with this and could only think of how over hyped this beer was. As it warmed thought it became a bit more complex and enjoyable but still isn't the great beer I expected it to be. It is though pretty damn good and is surely worth a try!!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Pours very dark with just a very slight amber edge when held up to the light. Creamish tan head about a finger and half thick that fades to a halo around the this beauty. Leaves a foam residue around the edge of the glass for the entire life of this joy in my tulip.  S - Smelling coffee and chocolate right off the bat, quite a bit of alcohol on the nose.  T - Closely related to the smell, coffee and a chocolate with a refreshing bitterness, slight oatmeal that wasn't picked up on the nose. Not tasting any of the alcohol burn I expected to get from the smell of her.  M - This was perhaps my favorite part of the beer other then the apperance. The mouthfeel of this beer represents the style almost perfectly to me. It has a thickness to it but is extremely drinkable. Enjoying for dessert right now but I could easily drink this with dinner, for dessert or with breakfast.  O - See above, I would drink this with every meal.

The nose is coffee dominant with bitter chocolate resonating throughout. A light hop smell along with a bit of booze is almoat hidden underneath the breakfast aromas.  The taste of this brew is outstandingly balanced first off. Coffee and bitter dark chocolate meld together nicely with some sweet malt and a crisp bitter finish. Delicious to say the least.  The mouth feel is very pleasant and coats the palate with a velvety breakfast smackdown. Just enough carbonation makes this brew mouth friendly and pretty damn comfy :)  Overall, i love this brew more each time I have one and find its chracteristics to be not only tasty, but satisfying and sophisticated as well",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ambluhm,3.77,"I was very excited to try this for the first time, and to be honest, it wasn't entirely my bag.  The beer poured thick and very dark brown (almost black) with a gorgeous frothy tan head with big bubbles.  The nose was the winning feature for me. It was a stunning coffee and chocolate explosion. It almost reminded me of a warm bowl of oatmeal with mocha covering it. Really pretty and right on the money with what I was hoping for.  The taste was a little disappointing for me. Perhaps it was the hype that everyone has for this beer, but it wasn't amazing for me. It had a thick, goopy mouthfeel that felt a little off balance for me. It was a little too bitter and I really tasted the alcohol. The carbonation was great, really helping to cut the bitterness, but it still felt too hot for me.  Overall, I was not super impressed. I get why people like the beer, but it's not my thing. I don't think I'll be buying this again, but I wouldn't fight it if I had to drink it again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Both scents are rather bitter  The taste is just like the smell. Mainly coffee, but with generous amounts of chocolate present as well. The coffee is most noticeable at the beginning, with the chocolate occupying the finish. Oatmeal is noticeable as well, not surprisingly. The chocolate flavour is not particularly sweet- think dark chocolate. Very nice.  Mouthfeel is great. Fairly full bodied, but lighter than I would have expected from an imperial stout. Very moderate carbonation, pretty perfect.  Very drinkable beer. The alcohol is quite hidden and it tastes great.

1199,11757,duffcalifornia,4.42,"2010 vintage courtesy of beerbeerbeerbeer (who sent me one out of the blue just because I said I hadn't had it yet!), poured into a pint glass.  A: Absolutely pitch black with no translucence whatsoever. Poured with a 1"" mocha colored head that faded but provided some sheet lacing.  S: This may be the best smelling beer I've ever had. Initial smells alternate between chocolate, roasted oatmeal, and coffee. Covering the glass, swirling about, uncovering and then smelling makes it smell like coffee flavored fudge. Absolutely can't wait to taste this beer.  T: While the coffee may have faded out of this a bit, it's still fairly present in the initial taste. Followed up by dark chocolate, oats, roasted malts, and more coffee. As you swallow, the chocolate and coffee fight over your taste buds for what seems like forever. That being said, I'm not detecting *huge* differences between this and the Terrapin WnB I had last night - a fact I'm writing up to the fact that both have aged a bit, meaning the impressive coffee flavors I hear about in FBS have probably faded.  M: Almost oil-like in it's viscosity, with low carbonation. Literally pours down your throat, with impressive flavor the whole way.  O: I have to say, this is a beer that lives up to the hype - and that's with some of it's flavor fading due to age. Even if this tastes extremely comparably to WnB, this will probably become my go-to Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout simply due to the fact that I can buy it locally when it's in season. The fact that it's 8% ABV and you can't taste or smell any of that heat is impresive. For $10/4 pack, you really can't go wrong. This may be my new go-to beer for the winter.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BeerMaverick,4.13,"Tasted with KBS...  A - Pretty much the same as KBS with slightly paler head. The brew is completely black with no translucency. 1/4"" tan/off-white head with moderate retention.  S - Unlike the KBS in which chocolate and bourbon dominate, coffee and slight chocolate undertones are at work here.  T - Very smooth for a stout. Similar to the aroma, coffee beans and dark chocolate are the stars of the show. Slight sweetness is present, but it is overwhelmed by the coffee and hoppy bitterness.  M - Uh...feels great in my mouth! The coffee and chocolate really soothe and coat the tongue in a way that most stouts don't. The aftertaste fades pretty fast making you all the more eager for more.  O - A fantastic stout and definitely one of the best I've had.

1199,11757,Nesued,4.17,"Refrigerated and then brought back to just about room temp for the tasting. I would recommend this tactic.  Appearance - Poured a jet black motor oil. No way to see through this beer. A moderate head formed that left a small ring with slight lacing. Inviting.  Smell - Big coffee bean nose with some dark chocolate components as well. The bitterness of the hop presence is evident as well.  Taste - Big full-bodied beer. Rich with coffee and bittersweet chocolate components. Some of the boozy qualities come through at the end of the sip. Not as complex and I would have hoped, but a good quality offering not to be overlooked. As previously mentioned, the after-taste is enjoyable.  Mouthfeel - To me, surprisingly smooth for such a coffee-forward offering. I was expecting a much more bitter linger. Not the case. Dense, with an aftertaste that will make you know you have just had a Breakfast stout. I think the oatmeal very much adds to the overall body of this beer, as expected. Also gives it a smoothing quality. The carbonation really doesn't provide much of an addition, this appears to be ""all beer"".  Drinkability - A solid offering. Put this over a barrel and you have a damn fine offering. On it's own, I think it's a good example of the style on par with other newcomers.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,crnipeter,2.93,"cit: ""Brewed with ...bitter and sweetened imported chocolates, Sumatra and Kona coffee.""  355 ml bottle (bottled 11/05/10) into 180 ml baby-Chimay chalice. Pours viscous, opaque dark reddish-brown body with well formed yet small tan head with low retention, leaving walls of lace on the glass-sides before fading out to a soapy film. Aroma is overpowering bourbon-like alcohol with milk-chocolate richness, intense roasted coffee beans and mild malty sweetness. The texture is silky due to oats used while the flavor is a blend of quite aggressive hot alcohol, milk-chocolate, roasted coffee and molasses. Both chocolate and coffee seems chemical, artificial-flavors alike rather than achieved by combination of roasted grains and malt-sweetness. There's a touch of herbal hops towards the medium-dry finish with lingering roastiness and hop-bitterness. Full bodied with moderate, fine carbonation.  In short: An artificially tasting, alcoholic Imperial Stout without any esters of fruit, lacking complexity and subtleness.  This is a marriage of sweet, oatmeal and imperial stout. Equal results (i.e. a rich chocolate & coffee) could be obtained solely from the grain but some like to take shortcuts compensating lack of skills and such brewing-techniques are called »creativity« then.

It pours a deep, opaque coffee brown-black, but the pour didn't yield much of a head so I can't comment on that. I'm sure a proper pour would yield some good foam, though. Coffee dominates the scrumptuous flavor - quality coffee, worthy of a fine restaurant. There are also hints of unsweet chocolate and molasses. Texture is smooth and fairly fizzy.

1199,11757,Preismj,4.19,"a: Heavy black look to it, thin head (though an admittedly soft pour). Stays around long enough and has nice lacing that slowly pulls down the glass. Very attractive, but scary how dark it truly is. Intimidating.  s: quite a bit like the KBS, though without the heat of the bourbon. I get a lot of chocolate up front, hints of roasted coffee and a whiff of grains right at the end. The Oat isn't popping out in the mix of grain in the smell, which is dissapointing, though that is likely because of how powerful the smell of chocolate is.  t: again, quite a familiar taste here when compared to KBS, though no heat in this brew. Tremendous as sometimes, depending on your mood, the heat in KBS can be offputting. This is strictly cocoa and a lot of it when you get that first sip in your mouth. there is something in the background of toasty almonds and coffee. there is a sweetness in here that would have to be from some sort of maple flavor. Only getting flashes of oat in an aftertaste, which is a bit sad...but I enjoy it when it creeps in.  m: very smooth and creamy. very little carbonation in this which is fitting for the brew...and it just glides right down.  d: a tad heavy, I don't need another one but i would certainly pick these up again. One at a time is enough...and for the type of beer that it is, this would be what you'd expect. It is thick, it is tasty, it is meant to be had over the course of a meal and that should do ya nicely.

Maybe some toffee or caramel too.  Very rich and complex taste. The chocolate hits first then coffee. Like eating a very sweet chocolate-covered espresso bean. There's also an oaty dryness and big load of malt sweetness: pumpernickel, caramel, toffee, very faint licorice. Yum.  The taste comes across as bigger than the beer is.

Smell: Coffee. A touch of booze almost like it was aged in bourbon barrels. Just a little bit of bakers chocolate.  Taste: This is almost exclusively coffee flavored. It's nice, as a non-coffee drinker this is actually pretty decent. It's pleasant and somewhat rich. The bitterness is perfect, present enough to notice, small enough to appreciate it not getting in the way. The chocolate really blends with the coffee and only offers a generic sweetness. There is a grassy component early in the finish with a nice roasty coffee quality that stats for a while. I really like it when beers have a long finish and this beer delivers. Taste would be a 3.0 if not for the finish.  Mouthfeel: Much lighter than expected but still full bodied. Carbonation is right on with the body, which again is more than I expected but it fits.  Drinkability: I feel like this beer is well tempered but somewhat 1 dimensional. It comes from one direction and offers little texture. It's more or less coffee front to back.

1199,11757,MarcatGSB,4.77,"Poured from a bottle into a La Fin du Monde tulip. No bottled on date. Purchased from The Pines Gas Station in Baraga, Michigan.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful black color with a nice brown/cream 1 finger head. Lacing is all over this glass. Looks amazing, but nothing compared to the smell...  Smell: Even the nose is creamy. Lots of coffee, mocha, roasted malt, oatmeal, and a creamy finish. It's a great nose, honestly. One of the better noses out of any variety I have experienced in a while.  Taste: The taste is amazing. Hints of vanilla follow a great roasted mouth, and coffee front.  Mouth: This beer is lovely...and lively. The mouth is explosive. Lots of flavor, and a great feeling. Not oppressive, just right.  Drink and overall: Great beer. Very drinkable for the style, and as much character as you can pack into the bottle. Probably my favorite of the style, makes the Nightstalker look overbearing.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,PDXHops,2.99,"2008 vintage on tap in December 2010 in a shaker pint. Appropriately dark body with a modest head and a bit of lacing.  A nice beer, but also a decent argument that coffee stouts aren't meant to be aged. While the nose is quite pleasant, the coffee flavor has faded to the point of staleness. It makes for an odd marriage with the also faded, yet smooth chocolate and roasted malts. The body is thinner than expected. Honestly, not a beer I'd recommend aging based on this sampling. It seems to be at its peak fresh.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smells of dark chocolate, dark roast coffee and espresso.  This beer pretty much tastes exactly as it smells. There is a dark malt/dark chocolate tasted up front that is quickly followed by the dark roast coffee and espresso. Low carbonation and not much hop presence. Slight alcohol presence.  The mouthfeel is thick and viscous.  This is a very nice beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ryantho00,4.68,"12 oz bottle poured black opaque into a snifter.  A deep inhale gives me smells of coffee, chocolate, cocoa,slight hops, and a caramely malt smell. Perfectly blended smell.  Coffee and chocolate hits me instantly and then some mocha flavors and a small taste of hops. Has a slight oak hint to it and then the oatmeal takes over....then gives way to a maltiness that hides the alcohol very well. Nicely balanced.  Awesome full body of coffee and chocolate....really close to drinking a chocolate milk...which is dangerous considering the high octane of this wonderful beer. This one is up there with dragons milk for me. Really really delicious in my humble opinion.  I could literally drink this beer for breakfast it is that good.

Thanks for the dating Founders  Pours jet black into a Brooklyn snifter with about a finger of caramel colored head that fades quickly. A small amount of lacing as it goes down.  Smell is of equal parts coffee and chocolate. Coffee smell comes through in the form of roasted coffee beans. Milk chocolate with a slightly bitter edge form the other half of the nose.  No surprises on the palate. Coffee and Chocolate. It's not the flavors in this brew that are surprising, it's the way they are perfectly balanced and so easily palatable while still being quite strong. Milk chocolate on the front of the tongue transitions perfectly into bitter coffee and roasted beans on the back. Some residual hop bitterness on the sides.  Body isn't the thickest of the style but is more than adequate. Flavor coats your palate nicely after each sip. Flavors of chocolate and coffee seem to linger forever allowing you to really enjoy this one for a while. Absolutely no hint of the higher %ABV makes this very drinkable. All around a very well executed coffee/chocolate stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Pours a viscous black with almost no head despite my pouring, but what i did get (about a quarter of a finger dark brown head) leaves lacing on the edges of the glass with a very thin ring. Smells very strong of coffee despite being a 2009 bottle (i would have expected the coffee to taper off). Coffee, burnt and toasted malts that make the chocolate flavor apparent. Tastes like exactly what the bottle describes, smooth, smooth, smooth dark chocolates, roasted malts bind together to form a very ominous delicious beer. No hop flavor or aroma really apparent, makes sense considering it's age but man is it good, and not too sweet. Carbonation is low and mouthfeel is sticky and viscous but not too sweet making this beer much easier to drink, considering it's alcohol you would never know it.

1199,11757,zeledonia,4.92,"2010 bottling, reviewed from notes (January 2011). Pours thick and black, no light at the edges, with a solid brown one-finger head that lingers and leaves a nice layer that persists. Smell is heavy on the chocolate malt, with some coffee in the background and a whole jumble of niceness. The smell is really one of the highlights of this beer. Taste is awesome; this is one of those beers where the flavors come in waves. Chocolate roasted malt and coffee up front, with some richness and sweetness behind it, and a nice gentle bitter hop finish. Just a really complex, delicious flavor. Mouthfeel is heavy and smooth, just a bit too syrupy for my tastes. An absolutely fantastic stout. Best enjoyed in small quantities; it's heavy and strong, so I found it tough to even finish a 12 oz. bottle!  Edit: just had a 2009 bottle, a year and 5 months old, and it didn't measure up to the fresher 2010 described above. A lot of the subtler flavors (from the chocolate, oats, and hops) were missing or weak, so that the flavor didn't have that ""full"" feeling. I didn't have the 2009 when it came out, so I can't be sure if it's variation between years or the age of the bottle, but I suspect that, as others have said, this beer does not get better with age.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Janderson91,4.77,"Bottled on 08/12/10. Enjoyed on 02/23/11. Very excited to try this one.  A - Pours an absolutely opaque pitch black with a one finger tan head. Light doesn't stand a chance of getting through this thing. A very thin head remains for the duration and leaves very little lacing.  S - Wow, this has to be the best smelling stout I've encountered. A very natural, freshly ground coffee aroma. Roasted malts and chocolate as well. Fantastic.  T - Incredibly complex taste. Begins roasty with a slight coffee flavor and some oatmeal sweetness. Gives way to some dark chocolate. Finish is a great coffee and roasted malt flavor that lingers for a bit. Some coffee stouts have a somewhat synthetic coffee flavor but this is so natural, it's great.  M/D - Mouthfeel is perfect for an imperial stout, nice and thick yet somehow I'm downing this 12 oz bottle rather quickly. It tastes too good to put down!  This is definitely one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of sampling, if not the best. A great offering from Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,kellertrumpet,4.84,Pours a completely opaque black. Can't even see highlights when held directly up to light in my Ommegang chalice. Very thin chocolate milk like head that dissipates quickly. I think the small head was due to a rather weak pour. My bad.  Despite the weak pour the smell is fantastic. Great coffee aromas as well as dark roasted malt. Some nice sweet lactose notes and a hint of hop bitterness. What a great smelling beer. I would gladly wake up to this every morning.  Wow. Just wow. Just as amazing as I remembered it to be. Huge chocolate taste mixes with a hint of med-dark roast coffee. The most impressive taste is the coffee as it does not taste like a cheap ground coffee like many other coffee stouts I have had. Nice vanilla and lactose tones make the whole thing sooo smooth and then there is a generous aftertaste of fresh ground coffee. Almost like the last few sips of my morning coffee when I use my french press. Without any of the grounds of course. There is a slight hop bitterness but it is hidden very well with the roasty bitterness from the malt which is how I prefer my stouts. I am trying to drink this slower so that it has time to warm up but it is really hard to stop drinking.  The mouthfeel might be my favorite part of this beer. It is so thick it is almost milkshake like. Why can't all stouts possess this viscosity. Just coats your mouth with wonderfulness.  I can see myself getting full drinking a few of these in a row but now as I am almost finished I am really wishing that it was not my only one in the cellar. If you ever get a chance to have this beer please do.  PS. It gets even better as it warms.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,arktos,4.97,"02/22/11 - A few month's late in reviewing this, but hard to find in the local area. Born on date of 08/24/10  12oz to Snifter  A: Black with a nice compact, pillow-like, finger thick tan head and decent lacing.  S: Yup, this is what I want to wake up to from now on. Freshly brewed dark roast coffee (could be biased as I love real Kona coffee), a nice chocolate creaminess and a good dose of oats. This one is quite easy and delightful to describe.  T: Taste follows the nose and I am thankful it does. Starts off with a nice big dose of dark coffee upfront overlapped quickly by semi-dark chocolate and finishing with a bit of nice roasty and slightly smokey dryness  M: Dirty as it may sound; I am in love with this mouthfeel. Leaving a tingle on the tongue, it's a perfectly carbonated, thick & creamy, silky smooth, big sipper... the upfront bitterness fades seamlessly into a belly warming bit of well hidden alcohol candy.  This needs to be put on a stick. I would skip down the sidewalk with a lollipop of this in my mouth and wouldn't give two sh*ts what anybody said.

1199,11757,Morey,4.05,"***Note*** I'm currently sipping a fresh bottle, and I'm getting a little more coffee than I did in the original review. Still, after reading through it as I sip on this, I pretty much stand by the review below. Cheers!  Poured an opaque pitch black color. No light gets through this one...period. Topped with a golden-brown head that stands about one finger tall following a med-aggressive pour. Head has settled to a mere ring around the outside of the glass, yet the beer still leaves some nice lacing behind as you drink it.  Coffee comes through nicely in the aroma. Some roasted malts and dark chocolate in there as well. Overall, it's a little more mellow than I had anticipated.  Coffee comes through in the taste as well. Not so much that one forgets that he's drinking a beer though. There's also a nice smoothness that I usually associate with Oatmeal Stouts. I get a bit of chocolate towards the middle, but it's in the background for sure. Coffee leaves a pleasant bitterness on the back-end of this one.  Medium pushing towards full-bodied mouthfeel with a low lying carbonation level that allows you to taste all of the flavors that this stout has to offer.  Goes down incredibly easy for the style and alcohol. I could do 4 no problem.  Morey's Bottom Line: A good stout without question. I'm not quite sure that this lived up to it's reputation for me though. It's my first time having it, and this isn't a super fresh sample either, but I expected just a bit more. That being said, I will definitely buy some next year and try to get it a bit on the earlier side.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,321jeff,4.25,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Founders pint glass. 2010 batch.  Pours a deep dark nearly black, like a cup of coffee with about a finger of mocha colored head. The head quickly fades to a thin layer and a thicker ring around the top.  Right of the bat the aroma is bitter burnt coffee and dark chocolate. There is also an almost creamy milky smell and some hints of hops in there, but the coffee is what dominates.  The taste follows suit and is quite chocolately mixed with a very earthy coffee that was just a little over-roasted. There's also a sweet creamy taste that really is reminiscent of an creamy cup of coffee.  The mouthfeel is pretty thick and viscous, it's not the thickest beer I've ever had, but it's noticeably thicker than the average brew. There's also a good bit of prickly carbonation, almost too much so for a heavy stout like this. Overall, another great beer from Founders that I look forward to tracking down every Fall. It's another one that would fade into the background for me if it were available year round, but since it is seasonal, I can look forward to it every year.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The cocoa travels first and then the coffee just hits you. Almost like smelling freshly ground coffee in the bag with cocoa.  T - A slightly sweet cocoa sensation with a coffee explosion. Some oats on the aftertaste as well as an earthy bite. Taste actually got a little better as the temperature increased.  M - Good smooth texture with little carbonation.

Looks fantastic.  Smell is tons of coffee, though without the burnt aroma of some coffee heavy beers. After the wave of coffee passes, chocolate comes through, along with some earthy roasted malts, but this is clearly about the coffee.  Taste is similar to smell. I am a coffee lover, so this tastes fantastic to me, but might not be for everyone. In addition to coffee, there is a mix blend of dark chocolate, roasted malt.  Mouthfeel is simply luxurious. A nice full smooth brew that coats the palate.  I could drink this all day, starting with breakfast.

Some dark chocolate and roasted malt come through. But then it all goes back to roasted cofee beans.  The coffee is really delivered in the taste. The oats seem to smooth it out and lets the chocolate add a subtle touch of bitter sweetness. I wouldn't say this is complex but it doesn't need to be. It's great the way it is.  Mouthfeel is surprising. It's not as heavy as would have thought. That does change some as it warms. Drinkability is decent. I could see the coffee being a little overwhelming after one and a half.

1199,11757,JimLetson,4.42,"Got this in a trade with BruChef. Thanks, Derek!  Poured into my goblet.  Appearance - almost completely opaque black. There's a big of light coming through round the edges, which makes the beer look like black stained glass.  Smell - strong coffee, also some chocolate. It smells like a Péché Mortel, but more substantial, if that makes sense. It's as though the smell of Péché Mortel has been distilled and put in here. Very, very nice! As I continue to sniff it, some black malt nudges its way in. It makes me remember the vanilla porter I homebrewed, when I used a coffee grinder to crush the black malt, and I kicked a bunch of malt dust into the air. My kitchen smelled a lot like this.  Taste - yum! Lots of coffee, but the edge of the bitterness is rounded a little by the inclusion of the oats. It gets sweeter as you continue to drink it, and the coffee steps aside to include some bittersweet chocolate and black malt. As you progress through the bottle, it takes on more of a fudgy chocolate brownie taste.  Mouthfeel - luxurious. It's rich, it's flavourful, it's complex, but without being overwhelming. Decadent is probably the best word I could use. As for carbonation, it's minimal.  Drinkability - it hides the higher alcohol well, and the mix of tastes is appealing in the extreme. The only thing I can think of that detracts is the richness of it. Like a heavy chocolate cake, you'll want a second helping, but it's a question of whether you'll be able to handle it.  This is a big, strong beer, but it never overdoes it. It's an outstanding balance, and if you like coffee at all, it's one not to pass up. Having it makes me wish I lived closer to Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,nhindian,4.49,"12oz bottle poured into a large snifter.  A - This was another one of those beers that pours a thick, syrupy, black and just erases all sense of light. I poured it into the glass and all I could see were the thick bubbles; no light at all to be seen. Builds a fairly nice, creamy head that seems to last a very long time. As it fades it leaves a wispy trail and some moderate lacing.  S - It has a very overwhelming bouquet of coffee. Like, I just put a pot of coffee on. Beneath that is bitter chocolate and a hint of oatmeal. As an avid coffee drinker, this smell is amazing. If you could combine coffee and beer any better than this, I'd honestly be pretty surprised. It just has a reminiscence of cold coffee without the extreme bitterness.  T - Although it poured kind of thick, I didn't feel much heaviness when I was drinking it. It certainly is a dark beer, but feels nice in the mouth with a touch of carbonation. Upon swallowing you get a huge rush of the coffee flavor and a bit of bitter alcohol flavor. The malt bill goes a long way in supplying a bittersweet chocolate quality that meshes perfectly with the coffee. It's certainly tasty, but I could see people who don't really enjoy coffee having a hard time with this one as that's the predominant, punch-you-in-the-face flavor. Very tasty however!  M - Moderately heavy with incredibly creamy mouthfeel. Bitter finish laced heavily with chocolate and coffee. Low carbonation.  D - High. Easily one of the best coffee stouts I've had and the oats in this make the feel heavenly.

Brewed with flakes oats, imported and bitter-sweet chocolates, and Kona and Sumatra coffee, this stout has an intense nose and frothy cinnamon-colored head that goes forever. 8.3% ABV 60 IBUs.  Well... I gave this one a B from a bottle... And I assure you, this review will be higher. This beer on tap looks incredible. Jet black, dark brown sugar colored head is thick and creamy.

1199,11757,veinless,4.88,"Shoutout to my main man Buddha22 for this, got it in a trade with him. Pours a deep, dark brownish black that is 100% opaque. Half finger head with aggressive pouring that is tan, very finely bubbled, and resembles the foam on top of black coffee when it is mixed via pouring. Lacing is excellent and ample, leaving a dispersed coat on the side of the glass. Dissapation is slow, and also leaves behind beautiful mahogany edges of bubbles.  Smell is awesome, with lots of clean coffee that isn't too black and bitter, as it is balanced by some oatmealy character and dark chocolate. All three are in perfect harmony in this one, giving it a rich, earthy morning smell that I'd love to wake up to instead of my annoying and loud alarm clock.  Taste follows suit and lives up to every aroma, and then some. Starts with an earthy dark, dark chocolate that blends into black, roasted coffee. The oatmeal earthy character accents both the cocoa and coffee ridiculously well. The beer then moves to a roasted coffee bean finish, as if you are sucking on a raw bean.  Gritty feel on the teeth after each sip is awesome. Mouth is thoroughly coated in mocha coffee flavor after each gulp as well. Silky smooth texture is thick at times, creamy at others, and coffee-like in parts as well. Superb. Drinkability is probably the best I've ever encountered in a beer, as the entire experience from start to finish is slick as ice, and the slightly bitter coffee finish leads into the next sip. The fact this is an oatmeal stout as well adds to the flavor so much, as that earthy feel is just unmatched in a beer of this kind, and really adds depth that lends still more to the drinkability.

Very nice, pleasant and mouth watering. t - exceeds the nose. Delicious blend of chocolate, coffee, molasses, brown sugar, cream and so smooth and creamy. Top notch. m - mouthfeel is great!

Elements can make a drink different but in this case, not better IMO. There may be some that find this to be a bit sweet, maybe a little too coffeeish... but to this reviewer, only keeping this on hand year round for a treat would be the goal.

I would be curious to know how I might have liked this beer if I hadn't already tried the Kentucky Breakfast Stout, which is one of my all time favorites. It is not as good as the KBS but very reminiscent of it and it definitely shares many of the great characteristics.  The color is a dark amber brown with a very dark brown head. Aroma is quite complex with hints of coffee, oats, malt and hops. The coffee and oat also comes through in the flavor and, at a lower abv than the KBS, it's actually a little more drinkable.

It starts off with a smooth yet bitter espresso flavor and then mellows with a taste of chocolate. Slightly hoppy on the finish but not too much or too little, its just right. Once the hops finish subsides, the coffee flavor sticks around for a while. This is one seriously good stout.  M- Thicker than many Imperial stouts I've had, almost drooly and I mean that in a good way. Carbonation is low. The oils from the hops and malts leave your lips slightly sticky. Mmmm, delicious.

Taste, however, was a little disappointing ... coffee and bittersweet chocolate flavors but nothing that sets it apart flavorwise from countless other stouts on the market. The hop bitterness detracts from the overall experience. Borders on sour. Lacks carbonation.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Zodijackyl,4.72,"Pitch black with a thin, coffee-colored head. Head minimizes fairly quickly, but swirls around the top of the glass all the way down. Exceptional lacing all the way down the glass.  Aroma of medium roast coffee, brewed medium-heavy, dutch chocolate with a touch of farm-fresh milk creaminess, and clean and aromatic oatmeal - more pleasing than your regular breakfast cereal. A hint of caramel also emanates from the roast of the grain, along with the heavier coffee and chocolate notes.  Taste shows the bitterness of coffee and cocoa up front, smoothing out with the mealy taste of oats. The oatmeal has the smooth and slightly sweet taste of oats, a very fresh carbohydrate character only found in flavorful grains. The malt taste also displays the roasted character of the grains paired with the separate chocolate and coffee. Very little alcohol shows through even as it warms up, though it provides a somewhat warming feel in the stomach.  Mouthfeel is great, the oatmeal is almost chewy despite being liquid, and it almost feels like a bready pastry because of the chocolate and oat mix. Extremely drinkable considering the gravity and ABV.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,tsatem,4.25,"12 oz bottle, with an unreadable date into a snifter. Thanks to calbertb2.  A: 1 finger tan colored head recedes very quickly but with extremely thick lacing already. Body is extremely dark brown, a shade away from being black. Though it's not the blackest beer I've ever seen, no light at all is coming through until I tilt the glass to drink.  S: Well - chocolate, coffee, and oatmeal. The coffee dominates - really smokey and bitter, blending with some roasted malt aromas. Chocolate provides a subtle sweetness that balances out the coffee a little bit. Great earthy aroma that I imagine is coming from the oats.  T: Balanced the same as the nose, but with additional flavors. Coffee is still predominant but is more coffee-like than the nose, and not just smokey and bitter. Really tastes like chocolate covered espresso beans. Great oatmeal stout like malt backbone. Absolutely delicious, but perhaps a little bit too coffee dominant - I wonder what it would taste like if the other flavors were a little more present. Very slight, but pleasant, alcohol presence.  M: I actually wanted this to be a little bit thicker, but the carbonation is very nice and the flavors linger for a long time. Slightly chewy.  D: As a big coffee fan, this is really drinkable. For someone who doesn't like coffee, it wouldn't be. That being said, I love the flavors so much that it improves the drinkability for me. The ABV is complimentary to everything that's going on. I could get into trouble by wanting to drink this with breakfast on a regular basis...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Fades quickly, leaves traces of attractive soapy lacing.  S-Loads of chocolate and coffee bean, just like the label says.  T/M-Really solid. Heavier on the coffee than the chocolate, but the combination of flavors is expertly achieved. Surprisingly this beer is not as heavy as you might expect given the style. Medium bodied with a lush, silky mouthfeel. This beer rolls off the tongue, leaving behind delicate, simple flavors of coffee, chocolate, and oats.  D-Another killer beer from Founders, on par with some of the best coffee/chocolate imperials on the market.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Color is deep dark brown, almost completely opaque.  Smell- on the nose, I got tobacco leaves (almost reminds me of a faint whiff of chewing tobacco), cinnamon, some faint chocolate.  Taste- cinnamon again, tobacco leaf, chocolate, a lot going on here, very unique. It finishes with a slick dark chocolate resin on the end.  Mouthfeel: I LOVE the carbonation- very carbonated, small bubbles. Perfect thickness, nice and chewy.

Big thanks to DannyKelly for including this bottle as an extra in a recent trade.  A - Pours a deep thick black with a 1-finger dark tan colored head. Quickly dissipated to a small rim on the surface. Little to no lacing. Beautiful looking beer.  S - Dark roasty malts. Strong notes of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. No presence of alcohol in the nose.  T - Ahhh, this is what keeps me coming back. Smooth bittersweet chocolate hits you up front with a nice bitter coffee taste on the finish. As expected, the coffee notes are a bit muted compared to fresh FBS, but they are still very prevalent. Alcohol only begins to show as the beer warms, other than that it's hidden very well. All of the flavors seem to mend extremely well together.  M - A very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. With this bottle being from '09, it seems to have thinned a bit from the full and thick body I'm used to. Carbonation seems to be in check.  D - Super drinkable beer. The alcohol is masked well, but definitely noticeable after a few.  Founders has got it right with this beer and it's easily one of my all-time favorites.

T - Immediately a bitter coffee flavor is present. It is followed by berrylike coffee notes (dark cherry) almost. It is followed by dark chocolate and fruits. Cocoa flavors are very abundant. Oatmeal too, perhaps? MF - Quite viscous, goes down nice and smooth. Limited alcohol presence. DB - 2 beers or three would be great. High drinkability at this ABV.

1199,11757,scubasteve04,4.53,"First thing I noticed about this beer, gifted to me by a good buddy, was the incredible viscosity as I emptied the bottle into my Duvel Tulip. It could easily have been Penzoil, and he was playing a really mean trick on me... Turned out to be the opposite.  Let it be known that I did, in fact, have this beer from breakfast. It is 830 am. Poured and first imbibed ~ 20 min after removing from fridge.  A: The foam reached the top of my Duvel Tulip with ease, not even an aggressive pour. The full 2.5 inches of deep mocha head persisted for several minutes before beginning to settle into a thin, dark tan protective blanket covering the virtually opaque, black liquid. I held the glass directly in front of the 65 W (equivalent CFL) bulb lighting the room, and none of it made it through this beastly beer. Impressive.  S: As advertised by the label on the bottle, a noseful of this beer is like being inside of a barrel of dark chocolate while drinking the world's freshest, most flavorful coffee. I didn't detect much hop, if any, nor did I care. It's breakfast.  T: FLAVOR-town, bitches. This brew kicks you in the mouth with all kinds of rich, palpable flavor, from coffee to chocolate to deep roasted malt, with dark fruits and a subtle, balanced hop bitterness (and did I catch a 9-er in there? Were you callin from a walkie-talkie?). Once the liquid itself has moved on to your innards, your whole throat warms with smooth alcohol, and a complex array of lovely flavors lingers in your mouth and nose. Superb.  M: Incredibly full body, but not gooey or chewy like a sauce. It is of the ideal consistency to coat the whole mouth and deliver a steady dose of robust flavor with every sip. A light tinge of dissolved CO2 livens the flavors as well, and keeps it fresh and drinkable...on that note.  D: Significantly more drinkable than I had anticipated. The incredible balance of sweet and bitter, and the excellent mouthfeel make this beer rich, but not overly heavy, and no doubt more drinkable than it should be. That being said, I would probably have to call it quits after two 12s. My hat is off to Founders for this one. Hell, I'd even give em my hat if they wanted it.  Notes: It being breakfast time when I decided to drink this wonderful gift, I conjured up a delicious turkey, egg, and smoked swiss melt on dark buttered, toast. The pairing was delightful, and the richness of the sandwich slightly muted the sweetness of the FBS, revealing some nice hop character to the beer maybe not otherwise noticed.

Black, I mean its black. DEEP black!  S - Rich chocolate, dark coffee, earthy dirt scents. Maybe some roasted nuts?  T - Bittersweet chocolate seems to be the prevalent flavor making for a delicious initial tasting. Coffee, more earthy flavors. Slight hop flavors are present at times. Alcohol shows itself at the end, though its minor on the pallet (though this may be due to the beer getting warmer). The complexities are abound and its going to take a number of sips to deduce all the flavors. Pace thy selves though!  M - Thick full body. The alcohol is present, but doesn't hurt the beer. Carbonation is in check. Smooth.  D - Quite a complex beer, full of all sorts of layers. You can spend all day trying to pick this thing apart. I won't say its drinkable, both because of its full body and its boastful alcohol content. But you'll certainly keep coming back for more, as you should!

M- very fleeting on the front end with a light slightly syrupy feel, which dissipates to the very dry almost tannin like back end.  D- This is a very tasty brew.

Pours a gorgeous dark chocolate brown, almost black with a whipped frothy dark tan head. A side note, I wouldn't mind scraping off mass portions of the frothy creamy head and eating/drinking them.  Delicious coffee and chocolate aroma with a subtle bitterness and dryness, reminiscent of the coffee/chocolate themselves.  The taste is directly inline with the aromas in that they are full of a smooth coffee bean and dark chocolates, perfectly balanced. And when I say perfectly balanced, I mean Perfect! Mild ABV allows for a couple samplings if desired without ever knowing that there is alcohol present.  Mouth feel is an integral piece of the balance between nose and taste, the creamy richness and frothy whipped topping has a perfect texture throughout the entire pallet.

The coffee aroma is like a hot fresh cup, like burying your head in a bag, or like walking by the bulk coffee beans in the grocery store.  T - Lots of dark chocolate and intense roast. Dark roasted coffee that is one of the best roasts I've had. Chocolate lingers for ages in a really great way. Coffee is also present, weaker at first but growing as you reach the finish.

1199,11757,weizenbob,4.41,"""Double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout"" boasts the Norman Rockwell-esque label of this 12 ounce bottle of Founders Breakfast Stout (dated 08/12/10). This was poured into an oversized wine glass. The pour yields half a finger of brown head that quickly disappears. Traces of sticky lace appear down the sides of the glass. The brew is nearly black.  Breakfast Stout is one aromatic beer. Even before the glass is in close proximity to the nose, strong aromas waft in all directions. Up close I can distinctly identify all of ingredients listed on the label. First there's a very literal scent of strong coffee. Some stouts imply coffee in their aroma; Breakfast Stout really smells like it. The coffee aroma is attached to the strong scent of dark baker's chocolate. There is an oatmeal stout quality that is detectable as well as a strong alcohol presence. This stout is truly awesome on the nose.  The flavor follows the scent, but with a different balance. Alcohol is pretty far forward in the mix, bringing a little bit of heat. The oats provide a nice thick malt base. Rich sweet chocolate floats around the mouth. Coffee is more subtle, but certainly present. There is a bitter hop finish (this is 60 IBU after all) but the oily hops are felt more than they are tasted. For the most part the bitterness is well-covered by the sweetness of chocolate and alcohol.  In the mouth, Breakfast Stout has a heavier body and a thick and velvety alcoholic texture with little carbonation to lighten the load. The 8.3% alcohol is not so much hidden as it is shown up by all of the distinctly intense flavors of this beer. In the midst of it all you still get the impression that you're drinking a boozy stout (there's definitely a little fire breathing going on). Thankfully this brew is malty enough to compensate for all of the alcohol in the mouth.  As far as the drinkability is concerned, this is a sipper; but boy is it an easy drinking sipper. It tastes like it's a little bigger than 8.3% ABV, but it doesn't seem too boozy to reasonably handle. I probably wouldn't drink two of them back to back, due simply to the flavor intensity and alcohol content. However, if you have superhuman alcohol tolerance this is not only a fantastic stout, but a pretty good value to boot.  I happened to grab a four-pack of these bad boys. A couple of bottles will no doubt be going into the cellar for an extended stay. I anticipate this turning into a mocha espresso after the hops disappear and the alcohol mellows. I'll report back in a year.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) I give two Schlitz for Breakfast Stout, and two more for lunch.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Nice deep malt aroma. T: big dark malt taste that matches the look and smell wonderfully. No surprise with how it turns out. Oats are there giving it an earthy like tase along with chocolate malts.

1199,11757,Shrews629,4.8,"Appearance - Extremely dark brown/black color. Only the faintest ruby highlights at the very bottom. A creamy brown/tan head was present and it has very strong retention and superb lacing. The head settled to a smooth film across the top after starting about 2-fingers thick.  Smell - What a wonderful smell of deep, dark, roasted and burnt coffee. It's like I stuck my head into a bag of freshly ground coffee beans. Some sweet chocolate notes are present and nice, but the coffee is the star of the show here. Not detecting any alcohol in the nose, which is nice.  Taste - A rich, dry, burnt coffee flavor jumps out at me with the first sip. Followed by a touch of bitterness. The chocolate is once again a role player that fits in nicely. A subtle alcohol burn right at the back of the throat. Feels great.  Mouthfeel - Medium to full mouthfeel that really coated the palate. Left a nice, inviting warm burn at the back of the throat. It was nicely dry and remarkably smooth for this strong a coffee flavor. I really like it.  Drinkability - I wish I had picked up a couple more bottles of this. What a super brew. Very well made. Very easily drinkable. Perfect for late night, cold weather warming. The alcohol is practically non-existent, so drinking this is a breeze. I could sip on this all night.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Dreadnaught33,4.5,"This is one beer that I'm rating better out of the bottle than on tap. This bottle is about 6 months old, for me that time has cut out a little of the raw coffee that you get in a fresh keg, and I like that.  Pours a great silky smooth but thick black with some great lacing.  Smells awesome with huge espresso notes, chocolate/fudge, charred malt, confection sugar, black licorice and more. An outstanding aroma that is so well designed.  The taste follows suit and has a beautiful chocolate covered espresso bean thing about it, like the candy choclate coating and bean melted and put in a glass, yet with a nice clean filtered water taste and some hop esters, plus a charred smoky malt character as well. Nice.  Mouth is great. The drinkability is great too. Founders does great stuff.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,tobin,4.65,"Pours a very dark color with a small tan head that quickly disappears and lots of lacing on the glass.  The aroma was big and filled with expresso and chocolate - dark malts.  The flavor was not at all what I was expecting. The first thing that hits you is a very strong dark coffee flavor, as this is the predominant thing. Next there is a bitter coffee and dark roasted malts.  Incredibly smooth and creamy mouthfeel.  4 packs do not last long enough and it's even better on tap",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,GarrettMD,4.77,"A - Thick pitch black with an equally thick creamy tan head. 4 finger head. Not an aggressive pour at all, it just foamed up as if I poured it straight down.  S - First thing I smell is coffee and a lot of it. Smells like the raw bean. Chocolate comes up behind it. Lacing is amazing. It coats the glass with the same color bubbles as the head. You can't see through the glass anywhere.  T - The taste of the head is pure roasted malts. Doesn't taste like the aroma as the head usually does. The beer itself tastes similar to the head with roasted malts being the base, rich bitter dark chocolate follows it up nicely. Coffee blends with the chocolate well. Can't taste oatmeal, but the smoothness shows it's there.  M - Thick, smooth, perfect carbonation, sticks to the inside of your mouth leaving a nice coffee aftertaste. Finish is creamy and slightly sweet.  D - Extremely drinkable. Alcohol isn't noticeable. This beer is too thick to have that come through. Not a beer you could pound a few back, but so smooth you don't care.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,gps2388,3.34,"Appearance- Perfectly opaque, not a real high head even with a down the middle pour but I don't put much into that, nice beige color  Smell- Even as this beer warms up I can't get past the spent coffee grounds smell, and not fresh coffee grounds, more like the next morning when you go to make another pot and the grounds from yesterday are still there. I can barely detect some oat/chocolate behind it but the coffee grounds are just too much. As it warms I think there's some toffee coming out too  Taste- As this beer warms up I am warming up to it, even though I started around 50 degrees it still needed to get warmer to get anything but the coffee grounds out of it. Now the oats, some cocoa and just a small bit of the lactose are coming out. The lactose sweetness is interestingly laid over the coffee bitterness for some very nice complex flavors but again, you have to really search to get past the initial old grounds taste which hurts this beer. This beer does have amazingly complex flavors but it really needs to be about room temp (64 degrees in here in the winter) to get them to come out.  Mouthfeel- Nice long, lingering finish, the coffee tannins are hanging with me almost like a good dry red wine would leave an astringent feel on your cheeks and tongue  Drinkability- High alcohol so take your time, you should want to with all of the different things to think about. Again, if you don't like tannin (like old coffee or tea) you may not like the astringent quality of this beer but it's something that I typically enjoy though don't necessarily look for it in a beer  I had really high hopes for this beer as it was rated so high by BA but I don't know that it is worth the high price tag. I appreciate all the fine ingredients but the fatal flaw is the coffee tones even though I am an avid coffee guy... I think a slower darker more oily roast of the coffee beans would help and perhaps lose the Sumatra which I have never liked much.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ElGallo,4.33,"12 oz. bottle poured into a balloon glass. Aggressive pour produces a nice mocha head on an opaque beer that is beautiful... just like me.  Smell hits you right away: super strong roasted coffee notes. Some cocoa and oats in there too, but the coffee grind scent dominates... just like the Patriots.  Mouthfeel is a bit warming and bitter at first, but if you let this one come up in temp, it is fun to spend some time with... just like you.  Only had one bottle but I wish I had a sixer, because this is a unique and phenomenal beer. One of my favorite stouts by far.

1199,11757,mltobin,4.22,"I picked up a bottle of FBS at Yankee Spirits in Swansea, MA.  Appearance is an opaque black color with a one finger mocha head. Smell is a mix of oats, coffee, caramel, chocolate. Its taste has similar characteristics and is sweet. Perhaps similar to consuming some oatmeal drizzled with chocolate syrup and some coffee. MF is medium. Drinkability is way too easy on a beer with this ABV, do remember to sip. It is a very enjoyable beer after all.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Aroma- Loads and Loads of chocolate and coffee. Some roasted aromas are in the background, but the coffee and chocolate are definitely the dominant aromas. Amazing smelling! Taste is spot on with the smell. Coffee, Bitter chocolate as a finish, a touch of sweetness, roasted malts. Overall an outstanding taste. Awesome palate. Thick and rich. Very low carbonation, which is how a double stout should taste like. Coats your mouth and seems to stay with you for a few minutes afterwards. You've got to love coffee to fully appreciate the beer.

Aroma is of black coffee chocolate roasted maybe even burnt malts and a touch of vinilla creaminess Dark black coffee and chocolate are the predominate taste here, followed by smokey and roasted malts. You can pick-up a sutle vinilla flavor too. A full bodied beer here no doubt which coats the mouth with a sweet smoothness. A bit bitter at end that leaves a coffee aftertaste.

The smell was not showing particularly strong on this, got little coffee, more milk chocolate. However the taste was much more upfront on the milk chocolate notes with the coffee much more in the background. The aftertaste had very little bitterness. The mouthfeel was viscous and heavy.  Later reviewed on tap. Mostly the same with muted chocolate flavors and more coffee and bitterness.

At $10 for a 4 pack, purchased at Delock's Liquors in Munster, IN on a Thanksgiving weekend road trip, I have enjoyed two already, gave one to my nephew as part of an assorted 6 pack for Christmas, and now I've got this one to enjoy.  Poured into a chalice, aggressively poured I might add, there is a very minimal tan head that dissipates rather quickly.  Smell is my favorite part of beer reviewing. Smell on this Founders brew is intoxicating.  Taste comes next and wow, what a bitter stout -- I love cold coffee, so this one is right up my alley. This one features the coffee bitterness of a classic stout.  Mouthful and drinkability also get high marks. The breakfast stout and the porter are my two favorites from Founders.

1199,11757,mechamifune,4.55,"This is one of my go-to beers so i figured I ought to actually give it a proper review.  Pours pitch black from the bottle, looks to have an oily kind of body from the pour. About a half inch brown head rises up and goes away in relatively short time. A very pleasant looking stout.  Smell is strong coffee and subtle sweetness, dark chocolate notes in there is well, but this is very much a coffee beer.  The taste is in line with the smell, coffee forward in the initial tasting, but it mellows a little over time. Finishes slightly bitter but not astringently so. Just a great tasting beer, though obviously if you are not a coffee fan you will have some issues with this one.  Mouthfeel is very smooth, creamy, and somewhat thick. Less so than say, 10-50, but more so than Brooklyn CS. For me, just about a perfect mouthfeel.  The smoothness makes this a very drinkable beer.... heavy yes, but the flavor works so well in hand with the texture that I feel I could just keep drinking it. The minimal to no sense of alcohol aids in this as well. One of my favorites, get it if you can.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,cccarson,4.7,"(2010) 12 oz bottle aged approximately 4 months, poured into a pint glass  A - Jet black body, no light escapes through this beer; frothy cinnamon colored head, excellent lacing immediately starts to appear after the first few sips and continues throughout the entire experience.  S - Strong roasted coffee and chocolaty malts.  T - Bitter (but not too bitter) chocolate flavor washed away by coffee beans; hop presence is felt (makes sense at 60 IBUs), but is there for a reason - the hops do not overpower the wonderful malt flavors and there is just enough to complement the bitter chocolate taste. It's nitpicking, but perhaps a bit too much coffee. I would have liked the slightest bit less coffee flavor.  M - Thick, chewy and smooth - almost oil-like consistency.  O - Phenomenal American imperial stout. At the top of its class, and sets the bar for what other imperial stouts should be aiming for. The ABV is just about perfect (not too strong, not too weak) at 8.3%. A near perfect beer, and one of my favorites.

1199,11757,rand,4.62,"From 12 oz bottle to pint glass  Pours out a jet-black with a chocolate-brown, 1-inch head. Nice cavernous head with good retention, lots of sticky lacing. It smells of dark-roasted malts and unsweetened chocolate. Nice coffee notes combine with freshly baked bread. Faint trails of alcohol linger in the backdrop.  As it hits the palate, the rich chewy mouthfeel is first noticed. Silky-smooth and viscous, this ale leaves no doubt that 'beer is food'. The taste follows the smell with roasted, bready malts up front. Smooth and not overly grainy. Oatmeal adds to the robust and expansive flavor profile, proving that this beer is aptly named. Bittersweet chocolate notes combine with slightly drying hops. Malts bend to an toasty, bread crust flavor towards the finish, as alcohol is just enough to round things out. The toasty notes really stand out as the beer warms. Flavors work in perfect balance, leaving a slightly astringent, bittersweet and satisfying finish. Amazing.  This beer has everything you'd look for in a stout - creamy and full-bodied in complexion with a hearty and balanced flavor profile. I don't usually drink beer in the morning, but with the added coffee I'm finding this a great way to start my Sunday.

Minimal lacing, though...  S - Raw coffee beans with traces of dark chocolate. Huge wave of scent hits the nose. Very mocha-like in character. It's a thick, rich aroma.

Unsweetened chocolate hovers in the background the whole way through to give it a good, rounded character.  M - Creamy and rich. The carbonation is very laidback...

Very viscous as it comes out, and it leaves a thick one finger head of tan bubbles. Lots of spotty lacing.  Smells like a coffee shop and a chocolate factory had sex. Gorgeous and effusive coffee aromas combined with espresso beans dance in my snifter and mingle with dark chocolate. Slight roastiness to it and I catch some hops when warm.  Mmmm. This is great stuff. Like the nose, potent espresso mixes with a deliciously sweet and smooth chocolate. Bordering dark chocolate but not too dark. Finishes with a nice bitter hop note that gets edged out by the roastiness. Exceptional stuff here.  Nice and smooth, thick.

T - The coffee and roasted malt flavors dominate up front, with a strong supporting turn on the back end from the dark chocolate, the anise, and a pinch of molasses and brown sugar. I am beginning to understand and appreciate FBS' reputation.  M and D - Doesn't sit quite as thick as it originally appears, but does right by the style nonetheless.

S - At first the nose was very light, however once I drank a bit the glass was able to help concentrate the smell which brought out the distinct smell of coffee with some subtle hints of grape. Overall very pleasing and exactly what you'd expect out of something called ""Breakfast Stout"" T - The taste is coffee all the way, dark, black coffee. There's just enough malt sweetness to offset the bitterness of the coffee, but overall the taste is dry and lets the coffee come though. M - Mouthfeel is heavy, but lighter than you'd expect for such a dark beer. This doesn't coat the tongue like some sweeter Imperial or oatmeal stouts, and isn't creamy like Guinness. It is almost porter like. This helps it go down like a cup of coffee. If it was heavier it would detract from the coffee/beer experience. D - This beer is very drinkable for a stout, but it's still a big, heavy beer. A couple of these would be very filing. The high alcohol content also would probably stop me from having more than one or two at a time.

Absolute black beer with a gorgeous, bubbly dark tan head. The foam crown in this snifter is by far one of the best I've ever seen in my 10+ years of drinking good beer. Barely visible carbonation can be seen if you look hard into the liquid. Amazing looks, utterly perfect. Smell, too, is simply perfect. Huge coffee notes, creamy dark chocolate, very dark, almost burnt malts, vanilla, that indefinable oatmeal smell, creamy, rich, decadent. I am floored by the smell. Taste is not exactly what I was anticipating, but still a world class American Imperial Stout. Flavors meld seamlessly into a big creamy, chocolaty gob of awesomeness. Not much sweetness, just hearty flavors anyone from the most naive Bud Light drinker to the most jaded beer hound can appreciate fully. Absolutely great finish of French roast coffee and bittersweet cocoa. The only fault I can find is there is a distinct tinny-flavor, which might be the hops trying their best to come to the surface under the overwhelming malt/coffee/chocolates in this. Not quite perfect, but about as close as it comes as a 4.5. Mouthfeel is exceptional, too. Very bodied and thicker than all get out. Smooth with subdued carbonation.  Wow! This is the definition of world class beer! Immensely enjoyable, each sip is a joy and abounds with flavor! Crazy good drinkability, this beer just begs to be slowly sipped savored, pondered, meditated on, analyzed and broken down, just to be built back up in time for the next sip.

Sort of a chalky cocoa flavor, but not too chalky. Good clean finish.  M - Bold throughout the sip  D - The only reason I rated this a 4.5 is because the beer gets heavy, you can definatley only have one or two of these before your tastebuds die of happiness.

So I'm sitting down tonight with a bottle (bottled 9/3/2010) and writing a review!  Pours jet black with a thin mocha colored head that dissipates relatively quickly.  The nose is full of dark roasted coffee and chocolate. It's difficult to pick up much else in the nose because of the strength of these two scents, but those are enough to make me want to take a sip.  Just like the nose, the taste is loaded with coffee. The coffee flavor is slightly bitter, but certainly not bitter enough to be a turn-off. There are hints of chocolate, roasted malts, and hops, but the coffee is the main attraction.  Mouth feel is smooth and creamy as a result of the oats. Fairly thick body and low carbonation.  Drinkability is high.

Perhaps a bit more of a semi-sweet chocolate on the tongue, but this is certainly all about the coffee. I really don't taste much, if any, of the alcohol in this Stout. Nice and creamy, with a pleasant carbonation level. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting, but prefer it for a dessert, or even to kick off an early session.

1199,11757,TheBrewo,4.75,"As we pour this brew into our snifters it appears as a syrupy, black liquid. It produces a one finger head of medium brown that retains for a short time. Spotty lacing punctuates the glass. Carbonation looks to be standard, but it, along with sediment, is hard to judge. The aroma is very rich, with dark coffee beans and chocolate, smokiness from char blackened malts, and an earthiness, as of spicy peppers. There is also a hint of cool vanilla. As we sip, the taste explodes up front with coffee and roasty malts. There is also a fine sweetness clinging to the edges. The sweetness disappears through the middle, while the other flavors ride on. They crash into the charred smoke at the end for a bitter, coffee-laden finish. We breathe an aftertaste that is not dissimilar to that after drinking a cup of creamy, dark coffee. The body here is full, and the carbonation is light to medium. The sip is very smooth and creamy, and coats the mouth nicely. The heavy coffee tends to dry the mouth after a while, but the mouth is happy. The abv is appropriate and entirely elusive in both aroma and taste.  Overall, what we like best about this brew was how bold the flavoring was, and the feel to it. As advertised, the coffee dominates a good portion of this session, but leaves room for some complexity throughout. As you sip the smoothness and creaminess of the beer are of another world. If any beer could produce a beer mustache, this would be it. Simply put, we could sip this all day long.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The drink, though, supplies the brilliance, big floral fruitiness (like blueberries?), nutty, definitely feeling the macadamia vibe here, chocolate coffee. Alcohol is more hidden in flavor than in song. Some bit of roast. Excellent vibe with this whole thing.

T- I am biased here- I bought a case of this brew recently and have decided it's my favorite stout. Coffee and chocolate superbly blended with malt and hop- a flavor combination that is befitting the winter storm that is blowing snow outside as I type this!

Weak, one finger head that leaves virtually no lacing down the side of the glass.  S - COFFEE. I don't get much else, maybe a hint of oats and a little chocolate, but the coffee is too far out of balance, probably because it gets a big old boost by the roasted malts.  T - Again, Coffee immediately followed by a little astringency from the malts, back into coffee. And the coffee seems to have a lot more acidity to it than espresso even. Almost no semblance of chocolate at all. I really can't believe how out of balance this seems.  M - Slightly oily, but not cloying at all, which is quite nice. The chewiness is enjoyable as well especially in the throat. I didn't feel ruined for the night from this beer, which I worry about with such strong flavors in this style.

Drinkability- The finish knocks it down, but the way it hides the abv deserves note.  Glad I picked up two, instead of a four-pack. Not my favorite beer. I think I'd need to be more of a coffee fan.

1199,11757,TheKtulu7,4.46,"I took this out of the fridge about 15 minutes before opening it. I'm going to spend quite some time with it and write the review as I do.  Appearance: Pours matte black. I can't hold the glass to the light at any angle to see burgundy or brown or anything. Initially a good two-finger cocoa-colored head that slowly fades to a frothy film that remains for quite some time and ensure the beer looks just as appetizing as time goes by. The head leaves partial rings of lace that slowly disappear. If you look down into the glass as you drink it, and watch it slowly wave back and forth, you can see how full-bodied it is. I tried this after nearly an hour, so that thin film of head was finally gone, and it looked like sludge. Dirty oil. But in a completely appealing way.  Smell: What can I say? The beer is dark chocolate all the way. Very dark. I can barely smell something like alcohol throughout--I want to actually say I can smell the warmth of the alcohol. A bit of roast coffee beans too.  Taste: Tastes like it smells: dark chocolate. A bit of black coffee, too. A bit more bitter than ""moderately bitter."" It doesn't taste like alcohol at all but it leaves the tongue warm as a reminder of the heat this thing is packin'. The beer sweetens up a bit as it warms. We're not progressing into milk chocolate territory here by a long shot, but we're out of the 90% cacao range. Maybe 70 or 80. I've seen some reviews that get super complex with the taste of this beer, but all I can detect is dark chocolate. I suppose dark chocolate, real good dark chocolate, is itself kind of complex, so I guess that's it. The beer definitely tastes its best at room temperature, when it's at the perfect balance of bitter and sweet.  Mouthfeel: Not too thick, but a bit creamy. Usually velvet smooth, but sometimes slightly rough from the alcohol warming the tongue. Then it does get thicker as it gets near room temperature, and even creamier.  Drinkability: Velvet smooth. Dark chocolate. Creamy. You tell me. The only drawback I can imagine is the warmth of this thing.

1199,11757,enfield249,4.28,"A - Very dark black, no highlights. Try to shine my 100 lumen LED through it reveals that it absorbs light, and is made of dark matter. Head is dark khaki in color.  S - Roast, coffee, brown sugar, and dark fruits.  T - First thing I get is malt, then followed by some strong roast coffee flavors. Great!  M - Full to very full, not much CO2 to speak of. Lingering roast astringency, but very nice  D - Almost too drinkable for a stout. So very tasty.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,JayS2629,4.15,"A- Deep, dark, solid black motor oil with a medium cappachino colored head with nice rings of sea foam lace. Almost a five, but would like a creamier head.  S- Strong, bold black coffee, hints of cocoa in the back. Something boozy in the back too, but faint. Very good smell.  T- Bold and aggressive quality coffee. Initially its just iced coffee, but as it warms you find the subtle hints of bitter cocoa, and roasted malts. For what they tried to do they did it spot on. As a chocolate lover I'd like a bit more of that profile to come out instead of having to hunt for it.  M- Thick and creamy. The oatmeal adds a great body to this. A little warm, but very well masked on the alcohol.  D- If you love coffee and stouts you will love this one. If you can drink bold, strong coffee then this will be heaven. Its very easy to drink. Its a sipper though.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,dfclav,4.55,"A - Poured into snifter. Pours a jet black with a nice creamy looking cappuccino head that leaves a lot of lacing and retains for a good while.  S - You can actually smell both the coffees in this brew. They used big, full bodied coffees and they smell great when combined with the roasted malts and chocolate. I smell a slight bit of sherry in the mix too.  T - Big on coffee and even if you aren't a coffee lover it's a pleasant flavor with roasted malts and rich chocolate that isn't off putting at all. Beautiful twang with a noticeable but not overpowering hop presence, the taste even stimulates what seems like every taste bud on your tongue.  M - The addition of oatmeal here makes this beer incredibly smooth and creamy. This is the perfect mouthfeel in a stout in my opinion and not many others do it right but Founders nails it.  D - This beer is very good but also very filling. Despite a slight bit of the warmth you wouldn't even know this had alcohol in it. It's an excellently crafted brew and i'll be drinking another with Christmas breakfast next week.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Black with a surviving caramel colored lace.  S: Fresh coffee grounds, some dark chocolate, roasted malts.  T: Initially it's iced coffee with a touch of sweetness. It finishes with smooth, dry, dark chocolate and a rising bitterness.  M: Nicely carbonated which carries the goodness throughout the palate.  D: This a superb beer for drinking one...or four.

Looks like coffee mixed with cherry coke. LOTS of roasted coffee on the nose. Burnt coffee grounds even. But in a good way. Light chocolate and some roasted malt. A light caramel sweetness is the first taste to hit my tongue and then a blast of lower cacao dark chocolate. Really rich roasty burnt toasty coffee. Flavor to spare. Mouthfeel is really thin for all the flavor and scent. Almost could knock out a whole 6 pack of this though I think. Dangerous! Great stuff.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Lerxst,4.42,"Acquired via trade with arvjunk. Thanks man!  12 oz bottle poured into a tulip. No bottled on date to be found.  A-Pours black with a 1/2"" mocha colored head that has good retention and leaves wisps of lace as you drink.  S-Coffee/espresso is most prominent along with roasted malt and dark chocolate.  T-Semi sweet chocolate followed by a strong coffee kick. Hints of leafy/earthy hops sneak in, but they are understated (in a good way) as more a complement to the coffee, chocolate and malt. Some roasted malt comes in the middle and finish, but the finish is dominated by a bitter coffee bite (not a bad thing).  M-Full bodied, slick, creamy. The carb is a tad stinging and could be a touch lower for my tastes.  D-A bold beer that announces its presence with an assault on your palate but still remains very drinkable because its so darn good.  This was my first FBS. I sure am glad I have a few more to savor. I'll be really curious to see what happens with some age.  Overall, a great job by Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,myatomicpolygon,4.5,"Appearance- poured a dark black into a snifter with about a half finger of tan head that quickly dissipates and leaves a thin layer and good lacing  Smell- smells of roasty chocolate malt, coffee, oatmeal  Taste- first a slighty sweet bitter coffee which quickly turned to smooth chocolate that just coated the lips and inside of my mouth and lingered for a while  Mouthfeel- creamy and smooth like chocolate milk with slight tinge of carbonation coming through  Drinkability- wow. This is a good one. Normally I can't drink too many stouts in a sitting but this one I could go back to a few times in one sitting and at 8.3 % the alcohol is very well masked  Overall- Great beer worth the hype...love the chocolate and coffee notes",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,sugit,4.85,"A: Pitch black pour with a massive mocha colored head. Beautiful. Head slowly disappears, wish it would stick around a bit longer. Not much lacing.  S: Coffee and espresso in the beginning. Milk chocolate rounds out the smell.  T: Very rich flavor. Chocolate, coffee and espresso beans. Coffee is very full bodied with is exacly how I like my coffee. Slight bitterness.  With each sip you realize that no one flavor outshines the other, they all blend together perfectly.  M: Med to full body. Nice dry finish. Very creamy. Great carbonation.  D: Amazing. I could drink a case of this. It goes down just so darn smooth. Excellent price point for such a good beer.

1199,11757,Satchboogie,4.4,"From notes reviewed on 12/5/10: 12oz bottle poured into a Duvel glass bottled on 11/5/10  A: Pours pitch black, completely opaque, 1/2 inch brown frothy head that disappears quickly. Leaves a little lacing. Looks like motor oil!  S: Espresso, coffee, and chocolate come through strong on the nose, along with the oats behind them. Alcohol is noticeable but not obtrusive. Dark roasted malt mixes with the oats, hop presence is pretty strong (only a month old).  T: The first thing to hit the tongue seems to be strong bittersweet chocolate, espresso, and coffee (like a blend of medium roast drip brew and espresso). It then runs smoothly to the oats, rich caramel sweetness, and a nice helping of bright, somewhat spicy hops. Alcohol is noticeable but well blended in the oat flavor. Everything blends together perfectly to form and incredibly complex and balanced beer. Finishes dry and warm.  M: Very full body, quite viscous, really crisp medium carbonation that leads perfectly into the rounded out melody of flavors. Chewy and sticky, bone dry finish that warms. The finish reminds me of a cabernet.  D: Alcohol hits right about where I'd expect, but I can't put the glass down.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Kinsman,4.54,"Pours an absolutely pitch black as expected and a nice mokah colored creamy head which unfortunately did not last as long as I would have liked.  Aroma is outstanding, permeating the entire area around me at first. Coffee is upfront with just the right amount of wonderful roasted aromas. The chocolate also comes through with a nice sweet aroma but it is mostly overpowered by the coffee  After an outstanding aroma, the taste was almost disappointing at first. However, as it warms a bit, it opens up more. Aptly named Breakfast Stout, with all this coffee and unlike some other coffee stouts, the coffee seems to be the right blend in the recipe. Not a bitter burnt coffee flavor, but a nice java-lovers flavor.  Plenty of body to carry this much flavor without being to alcoholic. Overall, this beer deserves just about all the praise it gets.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,TheSupremeAJ,4.92,"Poured from 12oz bottle into standard pint glass. Bought from Abe's 6-pack of Bethlehem, PA.  A- Dark and opaque like motor oil. A dark thin tan head similar to espresso crema in color.  S- Coffee, dark roasted barley  T- Very good coffee and dark toffee notes from the barley. Bittersweet chocolate undertones. The earthy characteristics of the Sumatran coffee beans really shine through into this balanced stout.  M- Perfect carbonation. Very balanced with a near-perfect astringency that begs for another sip  D- Very good beer and I could drink these all night long. My favorite non-beer beverage is black coffee... and this satisfies not only my beer cravings but also my coffee cravings.

Smells strongly of coffee with malty undertones and a hint of chocolate sweetness  Taste mirrors the smell - massive coffee taste, yet finishes incredibly smooth, creamy and malty. The coffee carries through, but there is no additional bitterness.  Mouthfeel is perfect. Thick, but not syrupy, incredibly creamy, nicely carbonated.

1199,11757,MuddyMcGinny,4.73,"64 oz. Growler into a English nonic.  Whoa! Pours Black Sabbath black, firm and syrupy with little head that forms slowly. Minimal froth is espresso red/brown with little carbonation. Very subtle dark ruby ring at the crown. Smell of rich dark coffee, malt and some smoke.  Coffee bitterness and chocolate with a really nice bite on first sip, Sumatra/Kona combo makes for a real robust flavor without much lingering bitter in the aftertaste... but the second pour is off the charts! Once the buds adjust the bite gives way to a smooth creaminess that makes this puppy extremely drinkable.  Lots o' muscle. Brings me back to my old Brooklyn days of a Manhattan Special without the extreme bitterness and carbonation. The two growlers I scored from Joe Canals Woodbridge NJ was a gift from the beer gods. Lashed it back while groovin' the Macpodz! Real good stuff coming out of Michigan!!

1199,11757,birdyone,3.73,"Pours like old engine oil, and not the beer, real engine oil from a car that's way past due on an oil change. It's a thick creamy black, with a slight brown foam. Really no carbonation to speak of. Really dense, while on the topic of engine oil, it would fail the air filter test; hold it up to light and you cannot see through it. So to me, it's a very appealing looking beer!  First wiff from the bottle before I poured was awesome. After pouring and it mixed with more air, it's really more average for good stout. It does have a certain uniqueness that's opened up once in the glass. I can't put my finger on it, but it's intriguing.  Taste is better than average for a stout, but not up to they hype. I read about this beer here on BA, and got really excited when I found it locally. I mean it is good, but not as special as it sounded.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and balanced. Very pleasant. Not the best, but better than most.  This beer has reasonable drinkability. Better than average definitely, but it's not cheap (not expensive either). It's good enough to off set the price, but like all stronger stouts the weather needs to be on your side. Somehow a good lager is good in the cold or the hot, but a stout is really only good in the cold (at least for a ""session"").  I do not regret buying the beer at all, and I probably would have given it higher marks if I hadn't developed a preconceived notion based on the hype.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S- just some roasted malt blended perfectly with some chocolate. really nice.  T- just how it smells but with a weird creamy taste (hard to explain). the alcohol is just a tad bit noticable but for 8.3abv what would you expect? the coffee makes more of an appearence as an aftertaste but very lightly.  M- solid medium bodied. good carbonation. really silky (prolly from the oats).  D- this should be a year around brew!  Overall- i can't believe this is the first time i've finally had this brew. it really holds up to its reputation. this stout alone should be up there with the best stouts of america. appreciate it while it's here!,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,FosterJM,4.83,102nd review on BA Bottle to Pint  12 oz bottle.  App- Its dark and viscous and did I mention dark? Great looking stout in the glass with a minimal head on it but wonderful to look at.  Smell- Big chocolate and malt. It for me was like smelling a dark choclate bar upwards of the dark 70% variety with some coffee mixed in.  Taste- You get this roast sensation but its capped off with a chocolate sweetness that plays with the tastebuds and makes them stand up and dance for more.  Mouth- Its very full and a bit chewy but that was to be expected.  Drink- Hand's down best stout I have had.

Smell: This beer smells of a lot of roasted malt and coffee. Underneath it all I can get notes of chocolate and perhaps a bit of oat sweetness. It's a nice smell, but a bit one-dimensional.  Taste: Roasted malts and coffee/expresso form the backbone of this beer. Also quite a bit of bitter chocolate and a touch of sweetness from the oats. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Very thick and viscous.

1199,11757,Beerisheaven,4.2,"I can't believe that I have never rated this one. For a time, this was a really difficult beer to acquire, now it is available everywhere and pretty much a staple on tap at good beer bars.  A - Sinister looking pour with a nice mocha colored head that pulls back after a reasonable time in the glass.  S/T - Pretty much what you would expect. Coffee and chocolate dominate. The taste follows similar to the nose. The one thing that I reduce the score for is that both the coffee and chocolate make this somewhat bitter and ashy. Bitter chocolate and coffee grinds. If they used the oat a little more to smooth this out, I think the beer would really benefit from it.  M - Rich, chewy, and somewhat slick make this a real treat.  D - Very enjoyable, but I normally let go after 2. Not something that I normally have more than one of. Again, the slight bitter profile makes this a beer that I am glad to have one of and then move on to something different.  A great beer from an outstanding brewery.

1199,11757,imn2it,4.3,"I have a 1/2 barrel of this on tap in my home. Founders packaged my particular keg on Oct 11, 2010 and I took possession of it on Nov 19, 2010. This is the most expensive keg I've EVER had! After tax and 0 waste, this stout cost me $2.15 per pint. So no matter how good my review, chances are that I will never pay this much again for home beer.  Appears as a beautiful stout should. Pours marvelous at 15psi with 1"" of foam on full speed pours through 1/8"" lines, stainless couplers, shanks and Perlick faucets. I have never had a beer so well behaved.  The smell is coffee mainly. Wonderful, amazing coffee like I've never smelled before. I am not a coffee fan, but adore coffee beer. Very faint chocolate odor might exist and maybe subtle, dark fruit....prune? I really expected to smell much more.  The taste is amazing. From the tip of my tongue to the back, there's no t-bud left unsatisfied. But mainly, I'm still getting almost exclusively coffee. I think if this beer were allowed to age the chocolate would eventually emerge.  Mouthfeel is great. The beer is a treat and a novelty and I'll enjoy every last pint. It's amazing and I'm so grateful to have the luxury of enjoying an entire keg.  The drinkability for me is high. I could easily consume 6 or 7 pints of this (And not be worth a sh!t), but have an amazing time (I'm sure). To be honest, for 8.3% abv, this beer is far too drinkable. I wish I could give it a 6.  In conclusion, Thank God for Founders. Every beer they brew is fantastic and their normal Breakfast Stout is certainly no exception. But again, the price per pint is so excessive that I cannot in good faith justify buying this for home consumption.

S(mell) - Not as vibrant as I expected. Hints of coffee and roasted chocolate, but not overpowering. Needed to get right onto the glass to really get it.  T(aste) - Like a dream of a perfect woman in your embrace just before waking in the morning. Which is to say, utterly divine. VERY full flavored, like a meal in a glass. None of the breakfasty flavors are way up front, though. You don't taste strong chocolate or coffee; they're just hints in an impressive weave of roasty, malty flavors. It's perfectly balanced so that it tastes like a complex stout with some smokey nuances and a smoothness (probably brought on by the chocolate) that belies its bitterness. I'm impressed. Hyped beers often don't live up to it. This one does.  M(outhfeel)- Heavy mouthfeel, yet went down more easily than stouts of similar consistency. Only slightly as dry on the mouth as, say, an imperial stout. Very pleasant considering its potency.  D- Stupidly good stout that really *would* make a good breakfast if it weren't for the alcohol. Offers a complex yet not challenging taste. None of the boasted flavored (chocolate, coffee, oatmeal) are prominent, instead mixing into a pleasing and heady beverage. Considering it's a high ABV and very complex stout, it's surprisingly drinkable. Believe the hype.  Serving type: bottle, into standard pint glass.

T - Rich, robust, flavorful, complex. Coffee and roasted malts are pretty strong, earthy taste in the background, alcohol is apparent throughout but not to strong.  M - Consistent, not to thick but just right, definitely nice consistency for a stout. More carbonation than some stouts but nice.  D - Lets just say i am definitely glad i got a 4 pack.

This review isn't going to be the greatest: In my beer nerd-dom, I seem to have misplaced the napkin that I wrote down all the particulars about this beer on.  I will say, I've had this brew out of the bottle, and the difference between the bottle and the tap version are night and day--or should I say night and night, given the color of this brew: As dark as midnight, without a single ray of penetration. Granted, it's dark in the Peel, but even as I held it up to the lamp on my table, I couldn't get anything. Sweeet.  Smells delicious, like a fresh cup of iced coffee mixed with some melted chocolate and then spiked with a little bit of Wild Turkey. I love the aroma.  Taste is (dare I say it) slightly underwhelming. Definitely better than it was in the bottle, and fresh as can be. But...I'm not sure. I've had KBS, and I guess that'll permanently ruin a man if he tries to downgrade from there.  Nonetheless, a very solid brew for a winter evening. It's the perfect time of year for a breakfast stout. Wind down the day with it...or top off your glass in the morning before heading out to the daily grind. Either way, you'll definitely enjoy this one.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T: You can taste the coffee right out the get go followed by the richness of the chocolate. Some nuttiness in the back rounds things off a bit. Very complex beer, still needs to warm just a tad and looking forward to see how this one plays out.  M: Full in body, chewy, abv noticeable without worry, just enough carbonation to give it a little action.  D: One great sipper if there ever was one.

A solid looking stout, but not quite the lasting head I really like to see.  Smell - Coffee dominates the nose with a hint of chocolate in the background (as far as I can tell, no discernible hop presence)  Taste - Coffee again dominates, but there is a fair amount of chocolate presence (like a dark bittersweet chocolate). There is a slight bitterness on the back end. It reminds me of taking a sip of black coffee and then having a bite of dark chocolate. Very nice.

Very little head, unless you pour the beer from a slightly raised height, which dissipates quickly.  S: Outstanding roasted expresso coffee aroma. This is a beer you'll want to breathe in, as I did, with each and every sip.  T: Tastes just like it smells. An initial roasted expresso coffee bitterness, that gently fades to a smooth, light chocolate-malty finish. This definitely tasted better as it warmed up in the glass.

This time I decided to have one while eating a slice of my Bourbon Pecan Pie (If I only had a KBS...) so my drinkability description will be two fold. !. The beer on it's own, and 2. The beer paired with a tasty, rich dessert.  A - Very much black. Not any head to speak of, with exception to some slight foaming atop the beer around the edges.  S - Coffee, with hints of molasses and caramelized malts. No real hint of teh alcohol - very well hidden at 8.3%  T - Much like the nose, but add in a bitter dark chocolate presence as well. Not overly sweet at all, but very well balanced.  M - Creamy with a touch of aftertaste. As evidenced by the lack of head, no real carbonation going on  D - As I mentioned, I had this with a very rich dessert. Before I began eating the dessert, I drank about 1/3 of the beer to get a sense of what it was all about before I damaged my palate with such a rich dessert. What I noticed was everything in the tasting notes. A very good and extremely drinkable stout that finishes quite pleasantly.  Once I began eating the pie, I noticed that the sweetness of the pie brought out even more of the bitter chocolate taste. The well balanced beer became a perfect accessory for such a sweet dessert. It seemed as if both items infused with each other as I ate, drank. I'd say this becomes even more drinkable when paired with sweet, dark desserts.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Coffee and some sugar. Mostly coffee though.  T - Bitter coffee roast, then burnt sugar, molasses and hints of chocolate in the back. The bitter coffee lingers but its not overwhelming. I can see why people love this beer, especially coffee drinkers. It's very appraochable considering this is 8%+ ABV and all the subtle flavors.

That super dark, pitch black, thick beer with very little head hints at the interesting experience about to take place.  The smell of chocolate comes through almost as strongly as the coffee smell. The taste is a heavy rich coffee, significant chocolate flavors, with some definite bitter notes--must have significant hopping to keep this beer from being super sweet. This beer is definitely full-bodied and thick, but there isn't a great deal of carbonation. Still, it's a smooth beer with a nice finish.

Taste: Smooth taste. Slight hint of coffee. Not watered down or overly carbonated.  Mouthfeel: Swirling it around you really get the coffee taste. Black and bitter, but not gross. Warming on the inside as it goes down. Not quite like bourbon (which I imagine the KBS will be like once I get to try it), but good enough on a winter night.  Drinkability: Very easy drinking beer, but probably too strong both in ABV and bitterness to drink more than one in a sitting.

Chocolate tastes switch intermittently between bitter dark chocolate and sweet creamy milk chocolate flavors. Coffee flavors turn a little acidic and bitter, but in a pleasing way. Nutty tastes pull through at times, along with cocoa powder and just a hint of earthy starchiness. Hops add bitterness, but no real flavor.

Although it recedes, there are spots of lacing left on the glass.  Smell: Roasted and chocolate malt, espresso, chocolate, vanilla, and a touch of alcohol. Overall a very pleasant aroma.  Taste: The taste starts out with sweet chocolate, which is balanced out nicely by the oatmeal. Roasted malt flavors push through, eventually releasing a flood of coffee and more chocolate flavors. The bitterness does not seem to be due to the herbal hops so much as the ever-present coffee flavor. The flavors expand as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: A very creamy beer that coats each taste bud with flavor. Slightly acidic from the coffee additions. Definitely a full body, although it is still reasonable.  Drinkability: There is less coffee in here than I was anticipating, but I really enjoy the balance of chocolate and coffee flavors.

Thick, silky milk chocolate almost completely masks the 8.3% abv, which is now starting to come out now as the beers warms to room temperature.  D- Incredible. I could drink another of these almost too easily. I would love to try it next to a bowl of maple oats one morning.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,mjn5036,4.5,"I have had this one before a while ago and am finally getting around to reviewing a bottle. This one pours jet black. At first there is virtually no head. Towards the end of the pour a two finger head cascades upward and settles upon the surface; mocha colored and viscous looking. Decent amount of sticky lacing remains as the level lowers. The nose on this beast is dominated by strong, dark roasted coffee and chocolate and malts. Simple in many ways, but greatness nonetheless. Taste is bitter dark roast coffee, baker's chocolate and fine maltyness and a bitterness that seems like it could be contributed to hops. All these flavors are exasperated as the beer warms up. A lot of chocolate and coffee flavors playing off of one another in this particular beer; the sweet chocolate complimenting the bitter coffee flavors. Prior to this, Terrapins Coffee Oatmeal stout took the cake for the most coffee forward beer. This one wins by a landslide. Not quite as thick and chewy as I thought this one was going to be but that just helps me drink more. Very drinkable and there is no alcohol to be noted, despite it boasting a near 9%. Nice carbonation as this one seems to just roll over the tongue. This is a truly fantastic offering from Founders, one that I will continue to go out of my way to seek out every year. Damn near perfection in my opinion.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Walken,4.84,"Appearance: Black is the new black. Nice mocha head, ok initial head, good retention. Odor: Hands down, the best coffee aroma to come wafting out of a beer that I can remember. Earthy and nutty, fresh out-the-roaster Sumatran, slightly floral with a full, rich malty backing of roast and chocolate. Consistency: Full bodied, velvety, smooth, oats certainly add an unmistakable slickness. Low carbonation keeps the tongue on it's toes without pushing any buttons. Taste: Whoa. Perfect. Malt throws roast & chocolate, chocolate and coffee add concurrent layers of sweetness and bitterness. coffee beans burst in mid-palate, complimenting the roasted malt flavors. As if there weren't enough going on, oats add a back-end to the coffee and chocolate, akin to chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. Finish shows all of the above flashing in and out, it's hard to tell with the dizzying array of well-integrated flavors going on in my mouth right now. I might cry my little eyes out. Oh, there's some hop bitterness too, it works in tandem with the roast to balance this beast.  That's all I've got. I love it when beers are perfect.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,wahhmaster,4.46,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass.  Appearance: Pours a deep black color with a large, foamy, black head that dissipates slowly and leaves impressive lacing. Truly a sight...  Smell: Smells strongly of roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate.  Taste: Sharply bitter up front. That recedes into an aggressive sweetness (presumably from the oatmeal) backed by intense coffee, chocolate, molasses, and other flavors. Has a bit of a lingering alcohol bite as well.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy. Nice.  Drinkability: An exceptional stout, perhaps the best I've had. Stouts typically don't appeal to me that much (I like them but I don't LOVE them like many people on this site do) but this one is a real treat. I would be hard to classify this beer as anything other than a dessert.

Living in an area that isn't flooded with Founder's Brewing Company is indeed a drawback... but drinking this beer makes it all worth it when I finally get my hands on some.  Pours a thick motor oil black with virtually no head... a very thin copper on top.  This beer drinks smooth and with every sip I taste a new layer, whether the roasted coffee, chocolate, or the grains.  I know BeerAdvocate frowns upon all 5's, but this beer is worth it. If there is a drawback to the Breakfast Stout, it's that I can't easily get my hands on it (only one Distributor in MA).

1199,11757,bnes09,4.89,"Being that this is my highest rated beer so far I had to try it again when I saw it at the liquor store. I wanted to see if the bottled version was as good as on tap and I'm proud to say that it is.  Deep black, viscous and completely opaque. Beautiful whole wheat colored head forms then disappears fairly quickly leaving minimal lacing.  Gorgeous aromas of coffee, chocolate, roasted almond, piney hops and vanilla flood the nose and intrugue the senses.  The roasted flavor in this brew will not quit. It is a complex and delicate dance of dark chocolate, rich coffee and a roasted nutty flavor which leaves any drinker speechless. The hops are highly assertive too with a spicy pine-like character in perfect balance with the roasted bitterness. Some smooth oatmeal and sweet molasses round out the whole experience. These flavors are so complex and assertive yet get along so well in the same glass. It's like putting ten angry bull dogs in the same pen without hearing so much as a growl.  Full-bodied brew yet not syrupy and no sticky texture. Just a lot of smoothness from the oats. Carbonation is very low which is a slight disappointment.  As for drinkability, if you are able to sit and savor this for longer than 30 minutes, you have a much stronger will power than I do. Each sip adds to the brilliant flavor and just leaves me wanting more.  A truly awesome brew! Well done Founders!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Thick, viscous, and dense. Wow, what an aroma. Coffee, oatmeal, roasted grains, hops, barley, booze, and wet earth. Nice, very nice. The taste is similarly intense. Full and rich, with a notable warming. It's bitter and dry, with a slightly slick oat note. Full and heafty mouthfeel.

T - On my very first swig I get a rush to my tastebuds of delicious chocolate, carmel, sweet notes, followed by lots of coffee. I really enjoyed drinking this whole thing.  M - Mouthfeel is really smooth, like silky delicious chocolate milk. Little bubbles hit the tounge and I really need to go out and buy some more of this.  D - Simply put, this beer goes on my top 10.

1199,11757,brewski09,4.21,"On tap into a 4oz. sample glass.  A. Arrived with minimal tan head from bar with nice lacing. Very, very dark, even pitch black color.  S. Smells of roasted malts. Not a lot of spices noticed with only a minor coffee aroma that built as the glass warmed and was consumed. The aroma leads you to expect a heavy, dark stout with a good complexity. No aroma of alcohol noted.  T. The taste was initially of dark malts and chocolate malts were dominating. Then the coffee showed through and mellowed the bitterness. The sweetness of this stout is hidden, but balances the profile well. The sweetness, coffee tones, and bitterness will last a while if you sit there and allow them to. Well balanced into the end though.  M. The mouthfeel is heavy and full as expected, but not thick. The promise was delivered exactly as expected.  D. Had I not noted this was an Imperial Stout before consuming it, I likely would not have known. There was no real alcohol tones to this beer because of all the other flavors masking it out. I was led to believe this was a spiced stout more like a Christmas stout, but was happily surprised by the ""coffee spicing"" noted. I was pleased with this beer and would drink it again if I were in the mood for a stout.

Smell is a big old Imperial Stout. Coffee, chocolate, dark malt. Some bitterness mixed with sweetness. Smells like you expect an Imperial Stout to smell.  T. Taste is big on the coffee flavors. Chocolate. A little bit of sweet malt flavors balance out the bitter coffee and hop flavors.  M. Very nice creamy mouthfeel. Full bodied. Not super thick, but nice mouthfeel. Has a bit of lingering bitterness and sweetness.  D. Very drinkable Imperial Stout. I would say that I probably prefer KBS to FBS but this is pretty close to the definition of the style in my opinion for a coffee Imperial Stout. Very smooth beer. Not super in your face like other Imperials. Balanced and well rounded is how I describe it.

This beer smells of coffee beans, cacao beans, butter, hints of dark dryed fruits, figs and some grains.  It is dry from the roasted malts. A sourness hits you up front, the figs and maybe some raisins i guess. There's also a sweetness from those two. Then it feels like chewing on some coffee beans followed by a chocolate and buttery taste. The balance is excelent, but I can't help but feeling that there's something missing...  The mouthfeel is very nice. It is smooth and gentle with very low carbonation and a thick feel to it. Just what i want in a beer like this.

May as well start sampling the sundry imperial stouts I have acquired over the summer. No date, poured into a large wine glass. Served around 8-10C, let warm through the serving.  A: Pours a viscous black with a nice 1 cm tall mocha head. Descends quickly leaving a thin, non lacing ring around the edge.  S: Very boozy to my nose. Some sweet malt aromas that are dominated by molasses and a touch of coffee. Later a bit of toffee comes through.  T: A thick malt body that is dominated by the bitter edge of the coffee. Not bad, though not up my alley. Some of the molasses plays through, and thankfully none of the booze on the nose. A bit of roasted barley comes in too. Over time, the edge of the coffee mutes itself and allows some of the other flavours to play through. If this was the beer start to finish we're looking at a 4.5  M: Low carbonation, Finishes cleanly for a heavy beer.  D: Gets better over time.

Follows up with a strong Chocolate Milk flavor that quickly transitions into the alcohol warmth/balancing hop bitterness. This is seriously well balanced and really, really delicious.  M: Really creamy, thick, and chewy., and what all good stouts should be  O: Yeah, I can only have one at a shot, but this is the stuff.

The pour is pitch black with about three fingers of creamy looking mocha colored head that leaves sticking lacing along the side. The first smell into this one is full of dark fruits right away. Another dive in reveals a ton of chocolate aromas with hints of coarsely ground coffee. The aroma is spot on for this, everything I could want from an imperial stout; coffee, chocolate, dark fruits and good roasted malts. The taste mirrors the aroma perfectly. It starts with dark fruits and undertones of chocolate and coffee finish nicely. Again, everything I could want. The mouthfeel seems a bit light and the abv peers through ever so slightly.

T - Up front it is roasty, and then the sweetness of the chocolate comes in. The coffee taste then comes in and dominates the taste. There is a slight bitterness also. This is a really great breakfast stout.  M - The body of this is on the heavier side of medium. The carbonation is nice, and the beer seems to coat the mouth very nicely. It also has a creamy quality to it.  D - I think this is a pretty drinkable beer. It took me a little while to finish the whole bottle, but I never lost interest in it for a second.

I surprised myself at ordering this, as I'm not usually an imperial stout person, but I definitely did not regret it.  A: FBS pours a dark, opaque black. The head dissipated very quickly to a thin, brown ring. I was a little disappointed by the head retention on this beer, although I've seen poor heads on imperial stouts before. Maybe it's just me, but the appearance isn't that appealing. S: The nose on this beer was the kind that gets you excited right off the bat. Prominent, enticing aromas of coffee and chocolate jumped out at me. T: The flavors of the beer lived up to the expectations set by the wonderful aroma. Rich, coffee flavors, followed by malt and coffee bitterness, balanced by a solid malt base, and accompanied by chocolate notes. The flavor was intense but still well balanced and very enjoyable. The bitterness wasn't over the top as I expected. I thought that the majority of the bitterness was a coffee bitterness rather than a roasted malt bitterness. M: Though the mouthfeel could have been smoother, it was satisfying nonetheless. D: This is surprisingly drinkable for an imperial stout, probably thanks to the balance of bitterness and malts. I really could see having this for breakfast.  This was the most enjoyable imperial stout I've ever had. I was ready to give up on the imperial stout style, as some of these are way too heavy in roasted malt bitterness for me, but I've changed my mind thanks to Founders Breakfast Stout.

Taste pretty much follows the nose with heavy dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, oats and espresso coffee. It ends a little astringent and slightly bitter. Aftertaste is coffee, coffee and more coffee with just a tad of bitterness.  Body is medium to heavy and carbonation is medium and just perfect for the style. Alcohol is totally hidden here.

1199,11757,Tucquan,4.32,"Had this on 2010-10-31 at Bulls Head Public House in Lititz, PA. I've had it many times since this initial review. As of the 2013 batch, I lowered my rating a little bit because I've had so many great beers since this initial review that it was necessary. Some additional comments were added on 2013-11-09 to reflect the reasons for the slightly-decreased ratings. Had this many times since; most recently on 2023-03-11 near Pittsburgh, PA.  A - Midnight black with a thick, coffee-hued head.  S - Complex but mild aromas of roasted coffee and grain, chocolate, dried fruit and spice.  T - Wonderful. I've had this in the bottle and it is even better on-tap. The smells are reflected in the taste plus some roasted and hop bitterness. Not cloyingly sweet, thankfully. When fresh, the 2013 version is very coffee-forward and I think it will improve with age as the coffee diminishes. I just had a year-old 2012 release and actually preferred it to the fresh 2013 version.  M - Thick/viscous body with just the right amount of carbonation for the style.  O - A perennial favorite for me. I like to stock up with enough of this to savor now-and-again throughout the year until it is released again in the fall. Very satisfying stuff.  Notes from 2023-03-11 Still a favorite. Had this alongside a Terrapin Wake-n-Bake and prefer this because it is smoother with less alcohol heat. You just can't go wrong with this beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smell- The roasted coffee smell is unbelievable, you also get a hint of chocolate.

S-Initially,I got lots of charred malts,some burnt toast and a small amount of high grade coffee but as the beer warmed more notes of bittersweet chocolate,strong dark roast Kona coffee and a little citric hop hint crept in.  T-Big flavors of coffee and dark malts dominate at first with some sweet chocolate,scalded milk and lemon zest becoming apparent as the beer warmed.The combination of strong coffee and slight citrus reminded me of an Espresso Romano(espresso served with a lemon twist).Good multilayered bitterness.  M-Full,thick and creamy.Coffee,chocolate and hop bitterness partnered with a starchy creaminess from the oatmeal and an alcohol sweetness that was only tasted but not felt.

The lace is magnificient; lively carbonation foam holds the side after a swirl and leave a curtain of tiny bubbles in its wake.  S: It features mouth-watering aromas of intense oatmeal, milk and dark chocolate, and delicious, medium-roast Columbian coffee.  T: The taste is every bit as lovely as I'd imagined and better. It has the same oatmeal, chocolate, and coffee tastes that were promised and features some dark fruitiness and sweet alcohol tastes as a fitting finale.  M: It is acidic early and finishes lighter than the color, flavors, and thickness might indicate.  D: What an unbelievable beer.

1199,11757,mjrod2142,4.53,"Had on tap at American Craft in Brookline, MA as part of a late brunch. The tap was not a nitrous tap.  This beer was pitch black with a creamy, light brown and thick head that was very slow to dissipate. I picked up a deep and dense coffee aroma that was very pleasant. Before taking a sip, I sensed this was a beer you could really chew on.  At 8.1% ABV, the first sip packed a punch, but still had an exceptionally creamy mouthfeel and went down easy. I enjoyed the coffee flavor, which almost made me think I was drinking a spiked coffee. This is definitely a fantastic beer to have with brunch.  An excellent coffee aftertaste lingered for a long time. Fans of stout styles should find this very drinkable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,cbak999,4.72,"A - pours a very carbonated, black with lots of head, at least 3/4"" thick, tan head.  S - the smell is mostly roasted malt, with hints of coffee and chocolate.  T - wow!! I can taste so many tastes in this very complex beer. Molasses, brown sugar, and bitterness in the background. Coffee, chocolate dominate. Even hints of vanilla.  D - Very well carbonated...all most too much. But this is a great sipper on a cool evening. Enjoying during a football game. A treat.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,zapato,4.85,"A - Pours a jet black just like what you would expect from an Imperial Stout. For those that like dark brews, this is about as dark as they come. Develops a thick head with good lacing as you drink it down.  S - Strong roasted aromas, primarily coffee with undertones of chocolate, but not overpowering. I always take a good whiff of a beer before it try it for the first time, and this one left my taste buds tingling before I even took a sip.  T - Absolutely superb blend of flavors here. Its very well balanced, but still maintains a unique personality. While coffee is the prevailing flavor, you can certainly taste several additional flavors I am yet to identify. They ever so slightly soften the strong roasted flavor resulting in a clean finish.  M - Thick. If you can call cheap beer ""watery"" then this is the opposite of that.  D - Excellent drinkablility. It does well to hide its ABV and I can easily see myself going through a few of these pretty quick. I can think of no occasion where drinking this would be an unpleasant experience.  Over all, this is a wold class brew. As my first Founders product, it has done well to establish my faith in the company.

1199,11757,CHickman,4.74,"Pours opaque black in color with a 1/2 inch creamy tan that faded slowly and left great lacing and rings of foam on the glass and a ring of tan foam around the top of the brew; this beer looked like left over motor oil, like a spoon would stand up in it.  Wow, it smells hardy...the nose is so strong it smells like cake mix in the bowl. Smells of chocolate, molasses and coffee up front with caramel, grains (oats based on the label), cocoa, vanilla, a rum sweetness like it was barrel aged, and some light alcohol. This smells so tasty that it's almost like frappuccino and hot chocolate mixed in a wine barrel, which is just an excellent aroma.  Tastes like it smells, with chocolate, molasses, coffee (coffee grinds, coffee beans, espresso, etc.), syrup, caramel, toasted grains/oats, cocoa, vanilla, charcoal, rum, sweet malt, bitter citrus hops, grass or hay, and a barrel aged bourbon like flavor that has hints of light alcohol. Dry, bitter aftertaste with a combo of coffee, vanilla, burnt wood and faint hops, which is really nice.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with basically no carbonation, and watery flow that made this exceptional to drink; the body is heavy and chewy, yet this flows down easy. Good to drink or to sip and savor like a desert beer.  I will shy away from saying ""high"" drinkability, as this would be a two beer limit for me because while it is a very tasty brew and the alcohol does not show at all, it is still quite a heavy and complex beer that just would be wasteful to pound and not savor. I will say it is quite drinkable; high drinkability for any stout lovers out there.  Overall the flavor is excellent and I will try this for breakfast one day to honor the title. I highly recommend this beer, which lived up to the hype and review accolades. This is a very impressive beer in every way, which got better as it warmed up.

1199,11757,StoutHunter,4.45,"Well i finally made it to my 50th review, so i decided to pull out something special from the fridge to celebrate with. Picked up a 4 pack of this last week, so lets see if it lives up to its #8 in the world hype. Poured from a 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass.  A- This beer pours a thick pitch black with a fingers worth of head that turned into a small bubbly ring that stayed till the end. Looks like used motor oil.  S- This beer smells exactly like a cup of cold black coffee with a little bit of chocolate lingering in the background.  T- Wow, this brew is truly the beer equivalent of coffee. Coffee steals the show in this brew but it isn't overpowering and is balanced well with the base oatmeal stout flavor and the bitter chocolate presence on the finish. One of the best balanced stouts I have ever had. A little boozy but not offensive.  M- Thick and chewy just like it should be, with perfect carbonation.  D- For it's style this beer has major drinkability. If i had the beer to blow i would have not problem drinking a few of these on a cold night or cold morning. This brew does a great job at hiding it's alcohol.  Overall this is a world class brew that lives up to all the hype. This was the perfect beer to sit back and relax with and a great beer to mark my 50th review. If I could change anything about this beer I would make it year round so i could have this in my fridge at all times.

1199,11757,RankRefugee88,4.67,"Poured from bottle into a nice sifter glass.  A - Very dark. Even when shone through light you can not see anything but black. Beautiful. Small tan head that dissipates to a very thin layer but leaves some lacing along the glass.  S - Just an extremely inviting smell. Coffee, coffee, chocolate, oatmeal, and did I mention coffee? Nothing bad about the nose whatsoever.  T - I'm not gonna lie, I was hesitant about drinking this in the morning, and even after my first sip I thought I wasn't ready for this, but a couple sips down, and, wow! The coffee flavor is so robust and warming. You can feel the alcohol presence, but for the most part it is disguised by that chocolate and coffee flavor, so be careful with this 8.3%. I can also taste the traces of oatmeal, just perfect. What is also great about this beer is although it is a stout with very strong coffee bean flavor, you can taste the hops too, making it one of the best balanced stouts I've ever had.  M - Mouthfeel is up there too, it has a nice texture to it, not coarse whatsoever. As smooth as it gets. Very nicely carbonated for this style, almost perfect carbonation. Something I like about the mouth feel is that it's not too thick, but thick enough to coat your palate with love.  D - One of the easiest beers to drink that I've ever had in my life. And with and 8.3% ABV! Unbelievably drinkable. Unfortunately this is my last one from the 4-pack I picked up the other day but I will damn sure be getting more of this.  Wow, just awesome. I didn't know a beer could be so near perfect like this. Every sip is just so savory. When you take a sip of this beer everything just feels right.

T - So many big flavors - the coffee is leading the charge. It isn't an intense bitter coffee, but something like a light roast without any stray coffee grounds to add any bitter. Chocolate and oatmeal pair together to create smooth, silky dessert like texture and flavor that gets me all hot and bothered. Citrusey hops bust out in the finish, showcasing lemony and orangey goodness.  M - Milky, creamy, smooth mouthfeel. I absolutely love it.

Great retention and lacing. Aroma is almost all coffee. Smells amazing. Definitely chocolate as well. At this point I already knew I loved this beer. Strong coffee and chocolate flavors. The coffee in this beer tastes better than any coffee I've ever had. Just all around tastey. Both milk and dark chocolate flavors but predominantly dark. Its medium/heavy bodied with a bit of creaminess. A very drinkable stout. Goes down very easy especially considering the amount of bold flavors and body it has to it.

The nose comprises chocolate (both dark and milk), coffee, roasted malts, and molasses. The taste follows this pre-beaten path, though the molasses is diminished, the chocolate seems entirely dark, and the coffee lends a nice bit o' bitterness with its roastedness.

A: Darkness, brown head that doesn't stick around for a long time, but laces nicely as I drink. 4  S: Really smells like I'm about to drink some coffee with a little chocolate in it. Earthy tones as well. 4.5  T: I was ready to hate the taste. I really was. But wow, I get the hype. Smooth chocolate starts it off, like a melted candy bar. Then it takes a backseat to the coffee, which isn't too dry or too much like coffee, its just an enjoyable flavor. Then it all subsides to a wonderful aftertaste. 4.5  MF: Full bodied and heavy. Creamy, but smooth. 4.5  D: Very high for a stout. This beer should be enjoyed as long as possible. 5  A LOT has changed since the review above. This was one of my ""gateway"" stouts, which are now my absolute favorite. I am now reviewing a 1 year old bottle, dated ""9/10/10"". I should get around to re-reviewing a fresh one as well!  A: The appearance is pretty much the same. Deep, dark brown pour with a light brown head. Not a great retention, but the lacing is great. 4  S: The coffee, as expected, has really stepped back. This has become a chocolate bomb with hints of vanilla and molasses. 4  T: Gotta say the taste has stepped back already on this guy. I remember fresh FBS being absolutely top notch, this taste is ordinary. Chocolate, molasses, a bit watery. Reminds me a lot of their Imperial Stout, but not quite as good. The defining characteristics that made this a great beer have gone. 3  MF: Not quite as full bodied, certainly still creamy. Carbonation is still fine but the finish is not as dry. 4  O: This category has changed since last time!

I plan to review it again fresh and compare.  **FRESH TASTING RESULTS** It seems to taste a little less harsh than I remember from last years brew. The 2009 seemed to be a bit more assertive. 2010's didn't seem as bitter to me either. I'd have rated this brew the same in all regards though, as the aged 2009 bottles I had a couple months ago.

Gradually, it faded into a light head and then just lace. Light carbonation.  S- Smelled strong of coffee with hints of chocolate and a light alcohol after smell.  T- The taste was exactly what I had hoped for, it smells like it looks. Amazing. Coffee with chocolate is all I can say.  M- Swirling it around in the mouth, its not too heavy, not too light. A little carbonation. it feels like coffee!  D- The drinkability of this fine brew is almost scary.

1199,11757,Cheesemoose,4.62,"Thanks to given2flybrewing for this one!  Drank this from a tulip on while brewing my first beer. Pitch black with brown edges and a nice khaki head. No lacing, very little head.  Coffee in the forefront on the nose. Bittersweet chocolate and the smell of dried fruit and nuts in the background. Very intriguing.  Coffee flavors well pronounced. Mild chocolate flavors with a good bit of nuttiness. Oatmeal is in the background, providing a good bit of balancing. Sweet finish, bittersweet chocolate returns and good fruity flavor, raisins or dried plums come to mind.  Very mild carbonation with a great mouthfeel that lingers. Alcohol is very well masked, but the thickness would make me only try one at a time.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Awesome stout - it hardly gets better than this.  M - Light-to-medium body, yet creamy, yet easy going down. Very nicely carbonated. Feels great to swish back and forth, enjoying all of the flavors.

Taste, so smooth, thank you oats, massively chocolately. Massive. Coffee is there, but subdued in terms of its astringency and bitterness from the smooth oats. Remarkably straight forward. So much chocolate. Great as it warms, never a challenge, just pure enjoyment.  This stuff is so easy to drink. Easily in my top 5 favorite non bbl aged stouts.

1199,11757,rtepiak,4.25,i'm surprised i hadn't put my two cents on this one. A nice ender and that would work well as your only beer for the night as it is decadent yet balanced in the face of sweet and grounded savor notes. Sour is as it should be with a healthy head of rather dark foam. Nose is a one dimensional but solid toast coffee malt wonderful. Boozy warm with a coffee grounds grit. I've had doubles with more latitude but this is a feeling of camping out there somewhere with nothing but a sleeping bag and a pot of cowboy coffee. A close friends cabin sipper.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,alpineclimber,4.3,"Thanks to TheSevenDuffs for this bottle.  The brew pours pitch black with a mocha head.  Smells of coffee, that's pretty much the nose for me on this one.  Interesting taste on this stout. I can taste bitter coffee, mocha, chocolate, there is a slight astringent taste from the coffee. There is a light hop bitterness in the finish. I am not a fan of hopped imperial stouts, this beer has the perfect amount of hop bitterness. The alcohol has a presence, a little much for a brew that is just over 8%.  A nice medium mouthfeel, a fairly full bodied brew.  This is a good beer. I had this beer a little hyped up in my mind because it is my first Founder's brew. I would definitely grab some more if I had the chance. Can't wait to try their other offerings.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S - A touch of grassy hops, but then its all rich roasted coffee with a touch of dark chocolate.  T - Rich dark chocolate, then milk chocolate, and finishes with a big blast of roasted coffee.  M - Full body, delicate low carbonation, super smooth and creamy across the palate with a touch of dark chocolate bitterness in the aftertaste.  D - Turns into a sipper after a glass, but the taste and mouthfeel are excellent. Full body, but it never gets ""chewy"" or syrupy. Well done.

1199,11757,BuckyFresh,4.4,"Appearance: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a large wine glass. The beer pours like jet-black oil out of the bottle. A chocolate colored one-finger head results from the pour. The bubbles in the head are quite large and makes the froth look like what happens after you blow into chocolate milk with a straw. Great retention and lacing.  Smell: Toasted malt, chocolate, tobacco, molasses, brown sugar, and coffee are just some of the scents vying for my attention. I would describe the aroma as more bitter than sweet, which I like. The oatmeal is definitely in the background, but not as up-front as the other scents. Could be due to the age of the bottle; I think it's only a couple of months old, so I would be interested to see this thing after several months of aging.  Taste: There's definitely substantial body, but not nearly as heavy as I thought it would be, given the oily pour and all. Lots of bitter coffee and tobacco up front. All the elements found in the aroma are there and no one thing is overpowering; however, I fell like a lot of the deeper, sweeter elements aren't as prominent as they were in the smell. Again, probably should have let this one sit a little longer before enjoying.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full-bodied, bitter, and delicious. The alcohol is also hidden very well.  Drinkability: Goes down fairly easy. I think this particular bottle was a tad green, and many of the bitter characteristics could become a bit persistent after a couple of these.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S: Coffee, dark chocolate, and plenty of roastiness. T: Espresso up front with bitter chocolate and roasted malts in the middle and sweet chocolate and more coffee on the finish. M: Heavy body with medium carbonation, feels almost as if it is cloying. D: It's an imperial stout, but not as heavy as some other 10%+ abv monsters are, so easy drinking for what it is.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,revolt914,4.72,"I enjoyed this much more than the KBS but it's a different drink without the bourbon.  A: Poured damn near black and had about an inch of chocolate colored head, nice brown shade. Exactly the same look as the KBS side by side.  S: This is the brews strongest feature... everything good at breakfast is in every smell you get... mmm chocolate, coffee, and oatmeal for breakfast anyone, you can enjoy this by just smelling it.  T: Mainly a smoky coffee taste with a bit of a chocolate background with a little bit of an ending taste of maple oatmeal.  M: Unlike the KBS you can't really taste the alcohol but it's good to know it's there. It's extremely smooth and gives you a creamy espresso feel as it runs over your tongue.

1199,11757,ZacharyJ,4.89,"A- Pours a pitch black with a toasted brown head. Kind of like, (surprise, surprise) A nice strong cup of coffee.  S- One of this beers strongest features. Sweet chocolaty oatmeal smell. Make sure to take a good sniff before each sip.  T- Chocolate and oatmeal again. With a strong coffee aftertaste, that lingers for awhile. Which is great, because you do not want this beer to end.  M- Feels wonderful on the palate. Not overpowering. Can't really taste the alcohol. Definitely a beer I could drink in the morning.  D. Originally had this rated lower then a 5, but had to bump it up as I continued to drink. Careful though the ABV, (8.5) and price (cost me $13 for the four pack.) will make you think twice about throwing these back to freely.

Upon tasting, initial flavor was expresso with slight hints of chocolate. More Expresso towards the end. Very hearty. Oddly similar to Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout. Mouth feel was mostly smooth, and lacing was still at top of my glass when I was finished.  Overall...an excellent brew. Worth $20 for 4? No way!! I'd rate Old Rasputin Russian Imperial above this one and it's 1/2 the price.  I'd certainly drink again...but not on my dime!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Arbitrator,4.92,"Lightly chilled bottle into a glass. I didn't like this all that much the first time I had it (B+), since I wasn't a coffee beer guy. But it kept gradually popping up as extras, then I traded for it, then I bought it online. I'm officially a fan.  A: Pours an opaque black color with 1.5 fingers of dark mocha head. Retention is outstanding for an 8% beer; it coats the glass with sticky lace on its way down. Fine, but not active, bubbles noticed at the edges and in a film across the brew.  S: Dark chocolate is strong in this one, along with coffee, roasted malt, nuts, and grain. It's very pungent and avoids that strange vegetal note that many coffee beers seem to have.  T: A silky blend of dark chocolate and coffee bitter at first. It segues into a base of toast and roasted malt. The finish sees an evolution of bitter hops -- just enough to balance the flavor -- and a grainy flavor (oats, I suppose). I detect a light nuttiness that I really enjoy. As noted in the aroma, it extracts the coffee flavor without that weird vegetal bitterness I sometimes get. Well done. Very much a breakfast vibe here; this is solid.  M: Silky... Chewy. Fairly hefty, though it could stand to be slightly thicker. I have a hard time criticizing this on mouthfeel. It delivers the flavor pretty well with an appropriate level of carbonation.  D: I'm not a huge fan of coffee stouts, but I keep going after this one. Enough said. I bought a case of the 2010 (mailorder).",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,surlytheduff,4.77,"Poured into a snifter, because I had one out of cupboard and it was clean.  A: Impermeable brown. Not blackness, but a incredibly dark and rich brown. Very light brown 1in head. Nice lacing as it settled.  S: A not-quite dark chocolate (like a bar that you were convinced was dark but had a very subtle rich milk chocolate taste) and cold, rich smelling coffee.  T: Enshrouds tongue with a comforting velvety blanket of chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. An incredible creaminess to every drink.  M: The mouthfeel is entwined with the taste. It's hard not to smile after taking a sip, and just letting this pass through and around your mouth. Rich, velvety, creamy, smoothliness - it's an adjective orgy!  D: This beer is on my shortlist of beers that I'd be happy being stranded on a desert isle with.

Nose- Huge roasted coffee aroma with some chocolate, but mnostly coffee  Palate- Coffee is dominant here as well, but the chocolate steps up and the citrus hops make there first appearance. Kinda reminds me of the chocolate oranges you smack to break into slices. I could see myself drinking this with breakfast. The alcohol is well hidden.

1199,11757,BamaViper1,4.48,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  This stout pours motor oil black into the glass. As it settles, a caramel brown head forms that's about a half inch thick. This head leaves gorgeous lacing along the sides of the glass. It's a beautiful glass of beer.  This beer is pretty straightforward, but in the best possible way. The aroma is great and simple: milk and dark chocolates with hints of coffee and a rich malty sweetness.  The taste is just as straightforward. Full flavored, this beer opens with a dense milk chocolate and malt flavor with a coffee/espresso accent. The finish lingers, with sweeter milk chocolate and coffee fading into bitter dark chocolate balanced with malt. One of the best stouts I've tasted, hands down.  The mouthfeel is full bodied, but not super dense. This is a well balanced beer, especially in terms of weight and amount of carbonation. The carbonation opens up the beer on the tongue, dissipating to allow the flavor to come through fully.  I could drink a lot of this stout. A lot.  Founders, please start distributing in Alabama. Please.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,clarkm04,4.7,"Appearance- Fairly dark almost midnight appearance. A nice tan head retention with left over lacing.  Smell- Very inviting. A mixture of coffee, chocolate with hints of alcohol, and malts. Not as inviting as some stouts but definitely up there.  Taste- This beer is perfection for a big stout. All the flavors come through but nothing is over the top. There does not seem to be any flaws with the taste profile and the balance is absolutely divine. It's rare to drink a beer with so many flavors with such texture that is balanced from start to finish but this one is. I love our rich and creamy it is and how smooth it is on the palate.  Mouthfeel- Outstanding for a heavy stout. A lot of imperial stouts have a heavy feeling on the palate or have a overpowering flavor note or carbonation, not this beer. Despite all the ingredients and complexity on my palate, it is very silky and smooth.  Drinkability- Very high for an imperial stout. I could easily drink 3 or 4 of these. Very stunning for a beer over 8% ABV but despite being thick, it sits delicately and goes down absolutely smoothly.  Overall- I can't recommend this beer enough. Easily the best coffee beer out there and outstanding with the oatmeal and chocolate. The key killer about this beer is the balance. Other beers have stronger notes but nothing I've had is this balanced. Truly a brewing masterpiece.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Pahn,4.18,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Moderate pour yields a one and a half inch frothy tan head that dissipates slowly leaving a shiny wall of legs. Pours a solid brownish black and leaves swatches of lacing.  Smell: Strong coffee, roasted malt, dark chocolate. An airy, cola-like characteristic to the smell. There aren't many distinct notes to point out, but that's not a weakness; the smell is huge and inviting. I could make an argument for giving this a 5 in virtue of it just being straight ahead, potent imperial stout aroma, perfect in its simplicity. However, I'll give it a 4 since I like a bit more complexity, and I've been much more enticed by the smells of other stouts. The folly of user reviews.  Taste: Dark chocolate up front, coffee and roasted malt in the middle, then a somewhat dry, rather hot finish. The wow factor here (and there is a wow factor; the first thing in my notes under ""taste"" is: 'wow') is the creamy balance. This beer manages to be very robust, very subtle, yet very simple, all at the same time (logically, I can't see how that works). The flavors don't develop, but rather are perfectly balanced from the first sip to the last.  As with the smell, the story here isn't how much is packed into the beer, but how perfected each aspect and the overall balance are. The individual notes (especially the dark chocolate) are all very good, and they combine to make one rich, decadent flavor that fits the silky mouthfeel just right.  Mouthfeel: Lighter side of full bodied, moderately carbonated. Very creamy.  Drinkability: This is a great stout. It's noticeably alcoholic definitely (though in the form of warmth rather than solvent flavor), but it's a good winter's night sipper. Unfortunately, as good as they are, the flavors don't particularly excite me.  For me, this is a very good but overpriced beer. It tastes like a better version of Great Divide's Yeti. While the quality is very high and I can appreciate that, I'm usually looking for endless complexity in big stouts. I do have a large coffee every day, but I can't finish a bar of dark chocolate on its own, if the analogy makes sense. Further, I wouldn't pay $7 for this again, considering how much else I could get for that.  I can see easily how this beer might be a holy grail or a 5.0 for many stout lovers. For what it is, it's almost flawless.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The like someone dipped coffee beans in dark chocolate. Brown sugar and molasses hop aboard. A mild bitterness adds to the complexity. The 8.3% is masked excellently yet still comes up just a tiny bit which is by no means a detractor.  M-Thick but not super thick. More slick and slippery.

A bit more of a head would have been nice, but that's my only real quarrel with this beer.  Smell is a wall of roasted espresso in your nose. Seriously, it smells like putting your nose over a pot of coffee. There's some burnt and roasted malts in there as well, but the coffee dominates.  Hits the tongue with a thick and full mouthfeel that is full of, among other things, espresso, dark baking chocolate, and roasted malt. It's certainly a huge flavor, and it comes in waves, with the espresso dominating on the front end, but the chocolate really pulling through in the finish and lingering for quite some time.

Tastes very good but i think I expected more. the coffee somewhat dominates relative to KBS where many things were balanced,so I got a LOT of complexity.

1199,11757,TheSarge,4.06,"Pours pitch black with a choclolate looking foamy head, with great retention. The body is blacks as hell with no hues showing through.  The aroma's roasty with coffee upfront, and slight hints of metallic hops.  Rich with flavor. Lots of coffee, dark chocolate. Oily slickness and warming to the palate with a fair amount of carbonation. I'd love to try this one off a nitro tap if available.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,SkunkWorks,4.3,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. As a side note, I had this with breakfast for extra fun.  Look: very black with no highlights even when held up to the light. There's almost no head at all but what little head it has is a deep brown. There's some lacing but not all that much.  Smell: roasted grains and a big coffee scent is what I get. Smells like a good cup of coffee, living up to the name.  Taste: coffee and bittersweet chocolate are the two tastes I get the most. Very delicious. Tastes like a cup of coffee. There's no alcohol taste at all and its generally just very pleasant to drink. Not challenging in any way.  Feel: fairly thin for a double stout. I think if anything is a weak point of the beer it would be this. Its on the thin side of medium bodied. There's no bitterness at all present so I'm surprised to see it at 60IBU.  Drink: very, very high. If I hadn't intentionally paced myself I would've finished my glass very quickly. Its very easy to drink and could definitely be sessioned if you wanted to go that route. This is especially true in light of the alcohol content.  Overall, I dunno if this beer is worthy of a top 10 spot but it certainly deserves to be up there somewhere. This is one of the better stouts I've had and I wholeheartedly recommend it. I'll be having again. Good job, Founders!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,mfunk9786,5,"This is almost as good, if not better, than Kentucky Breakfast Stout. The fact that it's easier to find and about half the price, well... that seals the deal in making this Founders' best beer, period.  A: Completely opaque, pitch black. There's about a finger of chocolate mousse head that laces nearly as nicely as a sticky IPA throughout. Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous. Doesn't get any better than this.  S: The oatmeal character is immediately noticeable in the form of a roasty grain aroma, and the finish is a big-time coffee punch. Chocolate is definitely there but it doesn't assert itself (as it shouldn't). Smelling this beer is one of its joys - it really does live up to its name. I could easily see waking up from a particularly nice weekend sleep to a glass of this and a grand slam breakfast.  T: Tastes absolutely delicious. Bittersweet chocolate, gourmet coffee, and roasty, toasty oatmeal. It's not missing anything. The mouthfeel is appropriately thick and tongue-coating. There's nothing about this beer that is remotely compromising, and for a beer that's less than 8.5% alcohol, it is remarkably full-bodied. Absolutely lives up to its delicious name and intriguing label. Founders should always consider this to be its flagship beer and should never take it for granted, it's all right there in the taste.  M: The mouthfeel is thick, the thing that a lot of rookie beer drinkers complain about when it comes to dark beer. Each of those people should be handed a glass of this - I'd like to hear someone's explanation as to why this should be any thinner than it is - it's got a lot of body to jive with a lot of flavor and a lot of character.  D: I would dock this beer for being so BIG, but if price and self-esteem weren't an issue, I could easily down about six of these a day. This is how Slim Fast should taste. It's the sort of thing that feels like a meal in and of itself, that completely defies logic when you remind yourself that it's still beer.  Another perfect beer from Founders. Still holding out hope that I'll be able to try Canadian Breakfast Stout one day.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Onenote81,4.47,"Had this beer on-tap at Duckworth's in Charlotte on 9/22/10. Reviewed from notes.  Poured into a tall stemmed-glass. Very thick dark black, with a finger-width mocha colored head on top. Decent globby lacing left behind. The nose was roasted with notes of chocolate powder, coffee, light booze, oatmeal.  Spectacular melding of sweet chocolate and cold coffee. The oats smooth this out. Light hop bitterness on the back end. Excellent mouthfeel. Coats the mouth and palate so thoroughly. Drinkability was extremely high, even given the ABV%. This was such a treat to drink, I happily finished the glass, and would have had another, had I not had to drive back to my hotel later. Amazing beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,dubinsky,4.63,"Poured into my cognac snifter.  A- Pours pitch black with a 1 finger toffee, caramel colored head. Very viscous pouring out of the bottle. Beautiful swirl on the cap eventually covers the top, leaving very nice lacing.  S - Makes me immediately think of summer camp as a little kid, the smells from the campfire and s'mores. Strong smoke and dark chocolate in the smell, with a hint of molasses. A tiny hint of alcohol esters emanate if i breathe in really deeply.  T - Wow! The taste follows the smell very closely. Smokey and chocolaty. Excellent blend of coffee as well in the flavor. This is close to what i remember the KBS to be like, but less complex in my opinion. Lots of molasses and oats. Sweetness is offset with the right dose of bitterness.  M - Mouthfeel doesn't follow the pour. Rather it's silky and really smooth. Not as heavy and thick as i expected it to be. Light to medium carbonation. Great warming effect.  D - Very easy to drink for a beer with this high an ABV. Founders, you did it again. Cant wait to enjoy it again soon. Just wish it was more readily available to me in California.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,mynameisbuzz,4.68,"Pours a deep, tar black, with a healthy brown head. Good lacing on the glass as well.  Smells like chocolate covered oatmeal with a hot coffee.  Great balance for a stout. Real heavy with tastes of chocolate and coffee dominating. Ends with an acidic hop bite, which was surprising and welcomed.  Real thick feel in the mouth and the oatmeal presence is most felt in the mouthfeel.  Overall, one of the most drinkable imperial stouts I've ever had.

1199,11757,MrIncognito,4.25,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass  A - Deep, dark brown but basically black. Looks just like really old engine oil. Hardly any head to speak of and I poured this relatively sturdy. Very tiny tan cap for a head that subsides quickly but leaves nice lacing on the glass.  S - Coffee and sugary sweetness that almost comes off as maple syrup. A bit of dark chocolate as it warms up a bit. Nice touch of alcohol in the aroma provides a little spice and heat.  T&M - Very strong dark roasted coffee with bittersweet chocolate for sweetness. Alcohol is evident in a warming way and adds a nice bite. Great flavors going on this beer and it's quite complex. Robust, sweet, and lightly bitter all at the sae time. Thick mouthfeel which you'd expect from the engine oil-like appearance.  D - A great sipper for a rainy evening but I don't think I could do more than one due to the alcohol.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smell- There is a lot going on here. Dark chocolate and coffee immediatly hit the nose. Some smokeyness as well.  Taste- Sweet up front with a bitter finish, not a hoppy bitter but the coffee bitter. Chocolate is deffinitly there but not overly sweet. Roasted malts and oats. A hint of vanilla and also some cocoa powder. A ton of flavor, yet not cloying at all! Better yet, no alcohol!  Mouthfeel- low carbonation, thick, and chewy, SMOOTH going down. Perfect!!! Founders does it again!  Overall- I dont know why I have passed on this for so long. For an imperial stout, this has exceptional drinkability. Deffintly getting my hands on as much of this as I can.

S- Lots of coffee with a bit of roasted malt and a hint of chocolate.  T- Wow, first though is complex but in a perfectly balanced way. Coffee, chocolate, burnt malt, cream, vanilla, and even some hop character comes out in this, never have had this big of a beer with so many different, noticeable flavors before  M- BIG, but smooth with a light amount of carbonation. Creamy in the mouth and goes down easily while coating everything on the way with all of its goodness  D- Well this beer is definitely what is is made out to be, its a great brew from a great brewery.

A: Pours an opaque, glossy black / brown; thick; there's about a half-finger of brown head on this one that dissipates quickly to a thin ring of foam with some intermittent hazy patches floating around the surface; a few thin strands of lace adorn the glass as this one is imbibed.  S: Rich coffee aroma; roasted, perhaps charred, malt; chocolate; also, that bit of character that's indicative of an oatmeal stout.  T: Mmmm... complex roasted malt flavor... coffee, dark chocolate; some sweet, even darker cocoa and maybe a touch of molasses in the finish; a nice hop bitterness that is quite noticeable, yet not overpowering or in your face - nice; some espresso towards the finish, too.  M: Full-bodied and silky smooth; chewy; this has such a great, velvety mouthfeel... unmatched!  D: Very drinkable for an 8.3% stout; delicious and highly enjoyable from start to finish.  This one ranks as one of my favorite stouts (and beers in general, for that matter).

M: Thick yet smooth due to minute carbonation bubbles. Mild dryness after each sip.  D: Excellent drinkable beer. I could easily have a couple at a sitting.

Smells of dark chocolate, coffee and cream. Wonderful.  T - Smooth, dark coffee up front. This is followed by notes of dark chocolate, cream and burnt malts. Very bold, but each flavor is pronounced exceptionally well. One of the best tasting stouts I've had.  M - So incredibly smooth. Nice and thick but goes down with ease. If I could give the mouthfeel a 6 I would. Exceptional.  D - When it tastes great and goes down smooth, you will have good drinkability.

The aroma was comprised of roasted malt and coffee beans. The flavor was of roasted malt, coffee, subtle vanilla, and cream. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation.

1199,11757,soze47,4.67,"I've been looking forward to trying this one for a while. This style seems to usually please, but not surprise me, so I'm hoping that Breakfast Stout gives me a unique experience.  Appearance: Ruby brown at first pour that accumulates into a luscious looking black pool. Thin auburn/light brown foam layer bubbles up and settles quickly in less than 5 seconds.  Aroma: The combination of the milk chocolate and coffee brings baking chocolate or pure cocoa to mind first. At subsequent sniffs, you can smell the coffee and chocolate as separate elements. Unique in that it smells like bitter coffee without crossing into espresso territory, which is what most other DS or RIS trend towards.  Taste: MMMmmm. The nose translates and blooms in the mouth. The milky chocolate sweet is the perfect counterpoint to the coffee bitterness. One of the most well-balanced stouts I've ever had. As it warms, the boozy warmth comes out to play. Rather than muddle or overwhelm the flavors, it compliments them and opens them up. Wow is this tasty.  MF: Velvety richness makes for a great experience. It is viscous, but in a non-cloying, positive way. The oatmeal becomes more apparent as it warms. That gives it a chewiness that is appropriate for the great, robust flavors.  Drinkability: Having one of these for breakfast would be appropriate, as it has a rich, belly-filling quality similar to a big bowl of oatmeal or plate of pancakes. On my second pour of this, I ate some organic, creamy chocolate ice cream along side of it. This was a perfect night cap/dessert.  Overall: I now understand the hype. Unique for the style as it has an overt sweetness from milk chocolate, but a perfect partner in coffee bitterness. Both are delicate when compared to the espresso/dark chocolate flavors present in others in this style. Founder's does a great job a creating a robust brew without overwhelming or smothering the flavors they are playing with. The best of the style I've ever had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Not much carbonation is perceptible. D: This beer is very easy to drink and is the perfect accompaniment to a weekend brunch.

1199,11757,Blanco,4.84,"pours a very, very, very dark brown. Almost black, but not quite. Head is thick and a solid brown color that almost disappears completely by the end. Some definite lacing going on here. Smell is of coffee and, more strongly, dark chocolate. The taste is incredibly smooth. I expected something bitter, but it's actually very smooth. The chocolate really comes out but it's not as complex as I would have expected. There isn't even a hint of the alcohol in this one. Mouthfeel is much thinner than the beer looks. In a way, this is a good thing, but I would have liked it a biiit thicker. It slides right on down, hardly coats the mouth and leaves almost no aftertaste.

1199,11757,feelmefoam,4.8,"I was very surprised when I saw this at my local store... I've never really had an opportunity to try this beer before, but I picked up a 4 pack as soon as I spotted it today. Breakfast stout pours an amazing blackened ruby color as it goes into the glass, but as soon as it settles in there are absolutely no highlights to be seen whatsoever... pitch black even when held up to the brightest light in my apartment. I did a soft pour and only got a half finger of head, but it didn't leave too quickly and left some pretty nice lacing around the glass.  The nose is big and fragrant, just how I like them. Dark chocolate and roasted malts eagerly jump out of the glass, followed by tons of coffee. Tons. The bottle doesn't lie when it says its a coffee oatmeal stout. A little earthiness in there too? This thing is complex and fragrant, two things I love.  Equally as assertive on the tongue. Bittersweet chocolate mixed with a little graininess (possibly the oatmeal?), and a lot of coffee grounds over some more fudgy chocolate. Some earthy hoppiness, but it's slight. Most of the bitterness is coffee-derived, and I love it. Such a solid flavor on this.  The mouthfeel is amazing as well. Thick and creamy, just how I like my stouts. There's a bit of carbonation, but it's just enough to let you know it's there. The beer is thick and smooth and creamy that works so well with the chocolatey-coffee idea. Mmmm.  Overall, this beer is excellent. I'm actually upset that they only come in 4 packs. It definitely lives up to the hype. Not only is it obscenely drinkable for an 8%+ ABV beer, but it hides the alcohol amazingly well. I'm so glad this showed up at my local store, and I only hope others don't discover the secret too soon.

Super strong and brilliant  T- I hope you like coffee, because that's what you're getting out of this one. Tons upon tons upon tons of coffee, and almost nothing but. Getting hints of roasted malts, but no real sweetness as I'd want from some chocolate...a little bit of a disappointment there  M- its actually not thick and syrupy at all, which took me by surprise a little bit.

Poured into snifter a dark brown nearly black with tan head that dissipated moderately quickly but with nice lacing left on my glass.

Nice oily feel on the mouth and tongue and finish is coffee and chocolate. Breakfast my ass, I could drink this one anytime and if it weren't for the high ABV, I would.

1199,11757,haazer,4.32,"Been waiting to try this one for awhile. Fairly excited to see what all the noise is about. Poured it into my pint glass.  A- Pours a very dark brown, caramel edges. Orange hues around the sides and throughout the beer. Pours a 2 finger thick beige, tan head. Refuses to go down easy. Leaves lacing down the sides.  S- One of if not the best smelling stout I've had. Very strong coffee and boozy scent dominates. Hints of chocolate, carmel, and very dark roasted malts.  T- Wow, very interesting stout. The list of flavors goes on and on. Coffee, chocolate, bread, HOPS(even somewhat citrusy), a slight hint of spicy alcohol, A malt baseball bat hits you in the throat as you transition the beer down. Then leaves a nutty aftertaste.  M- I didn't know what to expect with this. It felt light at first, but I ends up being medium to full bodied. Smooth. Becomes chewy and soft in the mouth.  D- I will get myself in trouble with this one. I could drink this, for awhile, but would hit the floor quickly. So flavorful and attractive. The high abv is dangerous though. God its hard to decide this one. IMO the taste outweighs the drinkability, but the abv is hard to ignore.  Verdict: I'd have to say I'm going to make this beer a mandatory case beer. Since it's seasonal and available now I will be getting one soon. Definitely lives up to its hype. The coffee aftertaste is phenomenal.

1199,11757,Lauthaha,4.88,"What can I really say about this beer that hasn't already been said? :-P  Poured from a single-serving bottle into a half-liter piece of glassware.  Appearance: It pours the color and consistency of motor oil; while pouring, there is some visible brown but once the beer is in the glass, it's pitch black. Rich tan head leaves moderate-to-heavy lacing as it recedes.  Smell: Just like a mocha-latte. The coffee is heavy here, with chocolate and alcohol tying for second. It really seems like this should be a cup of coffee, not a beer! That being said, there are some faint hop aromas detectable within the onslaught of coffee/chocolate/malt.  Taste: Espresso beans soaked in malted barley and floral hops, drizzled with chocolate syrup. Totally full-flavor, nothing subtle about this. Perhaps a touch of berry and/or grape and/or plum flavor in here. Luckily, the flavor is well-rounded, and nothing supersedes anything else.  Mouthfeel: Very, very rich and full. The beer gently expands on the tongue, aided by mellow carbonation. As it does so, it reveals numerous flavors within. Goes down smoothly without resistance, and leaves behind a definite coffee feeling on the inside of the mouth.  Drinkability: I could easily drink one...every morning :-P  Amazing beer here. Could possibly beat my favorite, the Stone Imperial Russian Stout. Perhaps I'll have to pit the two against each other some day in a battle royale.

1199,11757,Chico1985,4.7,"Having my first Founders Breakfast Stout of the season with breakfast. Picked up 2 4-packs in NYC for $10.50 a piece, great deal. Bottle date is 8-27-10, fresh!  Pours black with a 2-finger tan head, very creamy and bubbly. A swirly cap eventually covers the top, leaves very nice lacing.  Excellent strong coffee and chocolate in the smell, notes of molasses and smoke. Truly breakfast-y.  Taste follows the nose very closely, an excellent marriage of coffee and chocolate, they're pretty evenly distributed but coffee gets the slight upper hand. Lots of molasses and oats. The slightest hints of smoke, grassy hops and warming alcohol. Sweetness is kept in check nicely with bitterness, never over the top. Truly shines in the taste/scent as it warms.  Mouthfeel is silky smooth rather than hefty and thick, works perfectly for this beer. Medium carbonation. Tastes linger long afterwords, very easy to drink for an imperial stout.  One of those beers that make me look forward to fall. A truly solid beer, perfect for the season, one of my favorites.  Note: After having a few more bottles this year, I have to say it is imperative that it be around room/cellar temperature when drinking, or at most slightly chilled. To me this is a whole different beer when cold, much more enjoyable when it's served on the warmer side.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,glazeman,4.19,"12 ounce bottle taken out of the fridge, allowed to warm for about 15 minutes and then poured into a snifter  A: This beer pours black in color with a ¼ finger cappuccino colored head. Actually there's barley any head at all, rather, this has a swirl of bubbles that collect around the edge of the glass. Only a tiny bit of lacing on this beer. The bubbles that did exist lasted for the duration of the drink.  S: Toasted malt, oatmeal, and a tiny bit of mocha. Overall a nice smelling beer, although the smells aren't quite as intense as in top notch stouts.  T: Pretty good flavor here. The taste is pretty in line with the smell, as there is a lot of toasted malt up front with some toffee as well. Toward the finish of the beer there is a little coffee and chocolate.  M: Probably the best aspect of the beer in my opinion. There's a wonderful viscosity, nice level of carbonation, and a great aftertaste in this beer. It really sits well on the palate.  D: I know this is a different base beer than KBS, but the two are indeed very similar. Overall, I like KBS better. Breakfast stout has more toasted malt in the flavor whearas KBS has more coffee. This beer reminds me of a vintage car. Probably one of the best of its time (when it first came out) and still pretty good, although no longer top of the line. I feel it's status in the top 10 is more of a historic level than current. Probably still worthy of the top 100 though and by no means bad.

There is also a nice sweetness that finishes the nose.  T: Rich, bitter coffe, dark and lucious. There is also dark chocolate, alcohol notes, and a nice smokey finish.

Some roasted malts and dark chocolate are in the background, but the nose is overwhelmingly full of coffee.  T: Be sure to let this warm for a while before drinking - it gets much better. As with the nose, coffee is dominant in the flavor. You could even say coffee with sweetener in it. A little oat comes through in the mid palate before a strong finish of slightly bitter, dark roast coffee. As the brew warms, notes of chocolate begin to emerge, providing nice balance and changing the overall flavor profile to more of a mocha.  M: Full bodied, but just barely. A little booze comes through in the finish.  D: A very enjoyable imperial stout. I think it wold be even better if it reigned in the huge coffee presence just a little. But very good nonetheless.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Chaney,4.7,"I look forward to this brew coming out every September...The time has come in 2010. Wahoo!  A: Pours a thick, black oil that resembles nothing less than liquified coffee grounds. A small trail of bubbles for a head adds to the sight.  S: Coffee, coffee, COFFEE! Did I mention I smell coffee? Not of the Maxwell House variety, but something much, much more enticing. No chocolate, fruit, oatmeal, or anything like that has yet to poke it's sinister head.  T: Strong coffee taste at first, with the coffee spice staining the tongue with taste and just staying there for the duration of the session. The chocolate then makes an appearance, first texturally, then mixed into the coffee bean mayhem. This particular brand of chocolate really reminds me of Scharffen Berger dark chocolate.  M: Here is where the oatmeal make it's contribution. The texture of the beer is like a slick, slimy chocolate milk, with a little bit of rye-like aftertaste (oatmeal). The carbonation lightly sizzles the tongue. Sure the beer coats, but oh what a damn good coat!  D: As I'm sure the brewers at Founders would agree: This one is a sipper. Not just because the ABV is 8.3% (which I guess is not THAT bad), but because the beer is so flooded with taste, it's best enjoyed by savoring every drop.

Flavor follows the aroma quite closely but with the malts and slight bitterness from the hops really making their presence felt.  I'd say its a little bit more carbonated and bubbly than I prefer - I think the mouthfeel could be better if it was just a bit more syrupy and thick, but as it stands, still excellent.  Potent flavors make this one a bit tough to drink more than one of, but considering the high ABV its very drinkable.

The cacao nibs increased the chocolate aroma (duh!) and brought forth a bittersweet bite at the front of the tongue. The stout melded very nicely with the cacao nibs, carrying the bitter sweetness throughout the tongue and mouth. It finished with an almost bark-like dryness.

One finger head that retreated very fast. Lacing was very little, if anything at all through out the tulip.  S: What a delicious smell. The word 'Breakfast Stout' perfectly describes this! A great overwhelming smell of Coffee, followed by chocolate and malts. As my friend described it (and I agree): It's almost a coffee Coolatta smell from Dunkin' Donuts.  T: Great tasting stout! Taste of coffee, which then introduces you to the chocolate and malts in a delicious manner. The taste of alcohol is very well hidden in this beer. This blend works well with me and almost tastes like the coffee (with a kick) that is brewed to me in the morning for breakfast.  M: Medium bodied feel with medium carbonation. Though I expected a more heavy bodied feel with this beer, it still can not take away from the delicious taste and it is something that I can willfully ignore.  D: Took me a whole hour to finish one beer. Only because I wanted to savor this beer to its last drop. If I had many more on stock, I'm sure I would be able to finish one within 5-10min easily.

Looks amazing.  s - Smells of coffee, roasted malts, cocoa, vanilla, and chocolate.  t - Tastes of coffee, roasted malts, both bitter and sweet chocolate, and vanilla.  m - Medium body and low carbonation. Rich and very smooth; very easy to drink considering it's over 8% ABV.  d - I think this may be my favorite stout that is widely available and I'm able to buy straight off the shelf. Coffee is the front runner in the smell and taste, but it is very well balanced in both. I enjoy how the taste has both sweet chocolate and bitter chocolate/coffee balanced very well.

Actually, it's espresso strong. Oddly I've never noticed this before as I've had this beer 3-4 times before. Thank you Delirium glass! Some malt and maybe some roasted coco in there as well?  Finishes with the coffee flavor. Burnt malt opens this beer. There's a touch of coco but hardly anything strong here. A touch cool we'll let this bad boy warm. Room temp now and to be honest it's just sweeter and perhaps not as good. The chocolate might be more pronounced but the coffee/espresso flavor is far less impressive. Drink under 65 degrees I think is the rule here, not to say you should have this nearly frozen like a macro!  This is a thick stout but FAR FAR from a monster stout expectation. Truly amazing how drinkable this is.  The mouth is great. Silky, thin for a stout, but thick otherwise. Carbonation is still here, but not over powering. A truly DRINKABLE sipper.  OK this isn't a top 10 beer (are you kidding me?) but it's amazing stuff and at 10 for a 4 pack it might be a top 10 value beer.

Rich chocolate coffee flavors up front, a litte vanilla. Bitter but clean on the back end. A little thinner in the mouth than anticipated but still very rich. Not cloying nor tiresome to the palate.

M- somewhat thin for an imperial stout, the oats in this brew definitely gave it a smooth creamy texture, its not viciously thick which in this case was welcome. D- very very tasty and drinkable Does it live up to the hype? i think its an amazing brew definitely worth the 21 bucks i paid for a 4 pack initially i thought it was a lighter peche mortel but as i went through a couple of bottles i appreciated the double chocolate character which peche doesnt offer and in this case offsets the bitterness typical of coffee stouts and creates quite an amazing experience go out and get some!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The chocolate is the forerunner of flavor. Sweet and malty. Coffee notes with a bit of a nutty aftertaste.  It's a thick and hefty beer but its smooth. You almost want to chew it.

It amazes me how much coffee I was missing out on when I had this out of the bottle. Coffee up front with some soothing chocolate pulling through near the end. The bitter aftertaste makes my mouth beg for more. This is one of the best-tasting beers I've had.  M: Medium-bodied and smooth. More carbonation than I would like, but not overkill either.

S - Intense coffee and espresso mixed in with some bitter dark chocolate. A hint of sweet roasted malt is also notable.  T - Same flavors in order of the smell. Get a nice bang of coffee/espresso up front with a nice bitter chocolate to end things. The roasted flavors carry throughout. Don't get much alcohol, although when it was cold, I felt it was more apparent. The coffee and chocolate flavors explode when it warms. This one is a treat from the second you take it out of the fridge. I try to let mine warm up to close to room temperature, but it is so hard with such a great beer.  M - Well let's just say this doesn't feel like an 8% beer. You get a tad of alcohol coating the mouth, but not much. Stellar. This one feels low-medium bodied to me for an imperial stout, which is all the more appealing. Medium carbonation, just about right.  D - If you don't like coffee in your stout you won't probably care for this one. I personally don't drink coffee, but this is an awesome beer. I'd drink one in place of a cup of coffee every morning if it wouldn't be so wrong. Oh yea, drinkability... This one is great.

It is far better in early spring after the winter. Right now it seems a bit more disjointed and spicy as the flavors are moving through their paces after you swallow, but are each too ""raw"" and are tuned to a cedar-like intensity.

Looks viscous coming out of the bottle.  The taste follows the aroma pretty closely. Carbonation is a bit higher than I figured an imperial stout would be. Taste is predominately of powerful coffee notes, with some pretty bitter chocolate paired with it. The oats give this a bit of creaminess that's welcomed. There's a minimal amount of hop bitterness on the backend but it's pretty inconsequential. After the swallow, bitter coffee lingers for a while...like just having taken a swig of cold coffee.  Going in, I questioned if I'd like this beer. Coming out, I can't fault it for what it is, since it's labeled as a ""double chocolate oatmeal coffee stout"".

Nicely bitter espresso with cream, along with some bacon, steak, charcoal and oats.  Tastes: charred. Along with the flavors described above, we have steak gristle, black coffee and a tiny amount of sweet cream.  Feels: foamy.

S: Lots of chocolate, coffee, vanilla with a small amount of alcohol. Extremely sweet smelling.  T: The malt sweetness is tremendous. The coffee flavor blends nicely with the chocolate and vanilla so that sweetness is not as overpowering. Great balance! This was extremely delicious.

American Double/Imperial Stout 8.3% ABV OG? 60 IBUs 12 oz bottle, bottled August 30, 2010, poured into a New Belgium snifter on September 11, 2010.  Appearance 5/5 Pours impenetrable black with a big, creamy, dark mocha colored head, that stays throughout the course of the beer; although the head did recede from its initial glory, it left an excellent lacing. No beer is actually black and this one was clear dark brown at the edges. Looks the way a stout ought to look.  Aroma 4/5 Intense coffee and some malty sweetness; thing smells more like coffee than coffee itself. No hops. Very fitting name. Some alcohol is notable at room temperature.  Taste 4/5 Firmly coffee-bitter, with some accompanying malty sweetness. Slight coffee-ish acidity, that is enhanced as the beer warms up, and plays well with the understated malty sweetness. A powdered chocolate-ish finish with a lingering bitterness, right into the throat. Doesn't linger for too long though which brings the drinkability to maximum. Overall, the finish is medium with some residual sweetness, and *none* of the ashtray character of over-roasted coffee. Hops are mute in this one, which is probably good. To me, this is an style by itself, so the idea of having any hop aroma or taste seems out of accord. No booziness at all at any temperature even though I could sense some in aroma when the beer was warm. This is coffee in a stout: I don't detect much roast or any hops; everything about this stout seems like coffee riding over a solid beer, and very well integrated. The only reason this doesn't get a full score is because I am comparing it to the elder brother, KBS.  Mouthfeel 5/5 It's probably the oatmeal, but this one has the silkiness of a stout on cask. Medium carbonation, which is fitting. It is warming. I have had too many ""big"" beers to call the body huge, but in all honesty, this is above average in general, and fitting for a stout, if not exceptionally ""imperial"".  Drinkability 5/5 Very very good. For this body and this ABV, this beer goes down very easy. It can be had fast, which is dangerous! It's like the ""hard"" version of some coffee based drink (can't name because I like my coffee black and don't have much experience)  Other I haven't given this one a straight 5, although I think it is exceptional.

The coffee is backed up with a smooth smelling chocolate base. Toasty oats keep this brew well balanced.  T: As with the nose, coffee is the main flavor note, but is well refined and not harsh. Dark chocolate matched with a hopped bitterness make this brew something special.  MF/D: The mouthfeel is medium, but a little on the light side. I would have liked something a little more viscous. The drinkability, however, is superior. Impossibly flavorful and smooth, I feel like I can really drink this one for breakfast.  Overall, I want to thank lurchingbeast for this trade. I've had KBS before, and unfortunately didn't have the chance to review it yet. KBS, by the way, is the ultimate stout. Lurchingbeast secured me 4 of these babys and and another 3 KBS'.

1199,11757,optimistictour,4.88,"After a half year wait I've finally got my hands on the legendary Breakfast Stout and I'll say right off the bat that I'm highly impressed and will recommend this beer to any and everyone I consider a friend. It's not only that good - it's accessible as hell too.  Approach the bottle, marvel at the inky blackness pouring into the glass, the subtle head which quickly recedes into a beautiful lace, and the absolute lack of color playing in the light. For the style, this is an above-exceptional look and the prime motivator for anyone in the vicinity to ask that I share. They can buy their own.  One of the best smelling beers I've discovered, it's almost all iced-coffee and super dark chocolate at first, expanding to hint at nearly everything in the bottle with a deep breath. This is what I'd consider majorly inviting.  As the bottle says straightforwardly: ""double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout,"" this one hits those notes precisely, if not exactly in that order. First off is sharp coffee on the tip of the tongue - but a good coffee. I've tried at least a dozen ""java"" or otherwise coffee-themed beers and almost all have a gas-station ""espresso"" taste to them - ie. not really coffee. This one tastes like the real deal and satisfies accordingly. Next comes the chocolate and it comes on solidly but never overwhelming. This is no milkshake. Finally everything is tied together with the true smoothness of an oatmeal stout like Samuel Smith's or another of it's ilk - this aspect really solidifies the taste on a level above most of its peers.  Mouthfeel is a total knockout with the Breakfast Stout. Coating the tongue and working its way outward, every taste receptor feels stood to attention. Smooth yet full, thick but never even close to overwhelming... this brew goes down so easily I'm almost tempted to gulp my way to the next glass. But that would be robbing me of the exquisite experience of savoring the beer and inevitably lead to a morning headache since the 8.3% abv is completely subverted and masked. As I said to a friend after a couple of them, ""Children could drink this!"" Please note that 'could' is very different from 'should' - thank you.  All in all I must say that despite any skepticism I held, Founders Breakfast Stout delivers wholeheartedly on its promise (and hype) as one of the best beers around. The only downside is its limited availability so be sure to grab a few packs this fall and thoroughly enjoy yourself. Just be sure to cellar a few as every indication is that this one ages brilliantly.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Usually that's fairly off-putting but somehow it works with this flavor profile.  M: Not much carbonation, thick but not very sticky. Feels lighter than most beers that are this dark.  D: Really great. I couldn't drink more than one or two in a sitting, but I could probably drink no other beer for the rest of my life and die a happy man.

Strong chocolate and molasses components. Smells like a freshly baked molasses cookie with warm chocolate chips in it. Also some slight coffee and toasted bread character at the end. Really fantastic in its depth and richness.  First taste is rich a sweet, not cloying but definitely sweet. This actual dries out pretty quickly then when the carbonation, roasted flavors, and bitterness hit the palate. There's chocolate in the taste, but less than would be expected from the aroma. More coffee character comes through -- I suspect the decent amount of hop bitterness helps enhance this coffee character.  Mouthfeel is somewhat lighter than I expected (and this is a good thing). There's quite good carbonation here that lightens the body of the beer nicely making it not feel heavy or cloying. Surprising how dry it finishes.

It didn't take long for me to find this one, just like it didn't take long for me to fall in love with the Lost Dog Cafe.  Pours an incredibly viscous, opaque black with a one-finger tan head that dissipates slightly but maintains a nice rim around the glass until the beer is finished. Leaves some lacing down the glass, but not a ton.  Smell is dominated by coffee, with notes of bittersweet chocolate, milk chocolate, caramel, and vanilla making themselves noticed. Nice smell.  Taste follows suit with the aroma, but the coffee dominates even a little bit more. HUGE notes of roast coffee linger throughout the tasting notes, with the same chocolate and caramel notes making themselves noticed. A slight hop spice also helps keep the flavor interesting. I have never had a stout with this level of coffee flavor. I enjoyed it, but think I need to have a couple more over the next couple nights to really decide whether it is something I would actively seek out again. I thought the strong coffee notes were actually a bit off putting at first, but they really grew on me the more and more I went through.  Amazing mouthfeel, creamy and viscous, with a perfect level of carbonation.  EDIT: Just had my second bottle of the four pack, and it has already begun to grow on me.

Some stouts of this nature can be flawed by having one flavor dominate all others, therefore leading to a one-dimensional taste. This beer does have a lot of roasty coffee going on but it is not quite to the point of no return. Overall very good.  Mouthfeel isn't bad, not as thick as I thought it would be.

1199,11757,LiquidCucumber,4.32,"A - Pitch black with a small mocha head that looks nice and creamy. I kind of want to grab a spoon.  S - The first thing is a strong hit of coffee to the nose, followed by chocolate, floral hops, and mellow malts.  T - Sweet creamy chocolate mixed with bitterness from both the coffee and hops, it's really what coffee should always taste like...  M - Like I said above, creamy and sweet, coats your mouth with a pleasant layer of malty chocolate which tingles on the tongue. A very excellent brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,GDBEERMAN,4.45,"12oz bottle (bottled on 08.27.10) poured into snifter. A: A deep black body, that of a fresh pot of strong coffee, great sign and a head of rich caramel, that rises and falls into a thin layer. Lacing is spares and left in a foamy, unordered fashion. S: Roasted notes of dark, black coffee are welcoming and pleasant. A bold medium to full bodied aroma. A mellow finish on the aroma that denotes chocolate. As brew warms the notes of coffee and chocolate great even more intense. T/M: Tart is on the complete other end of the spectrum of this beer and bold, rich flavors are all that dominate. Coffee off the nose give way to a rich chocolate experience that is very worth the while. Mouthfeel is a rich and creamy, silky sensation. D: The ABV is hidden so well that I cannot find any boozy aspects to this brew. taste like coffee with chocolate is a perfect carbonation form. I could drink this one every time I crave coffee, every morning??

Darts of dark bitter chocolate peak through the cereal.  I half expected to withhold the last 1/2"" or so from the bottle, looking for a thick yeast cake, it's so thick.  If only breakfast was this good every day...  edit: I have also had this on tap. I prefer the bottle. The tap felt thinner and less creamy.

1199,11757,Khazadum,3.14,"Ahh, what a couple months. From the start of my craft brew career to my current status this beer has haunted me. I started with it and now I hit it up again after educating myself for quite some time. Poured into my brandy snifter once more, a fresh batch versus a few months old.  Vision Pitch black void body with dual toned froth. Not much carbonation and head as I would have liked, but a bit did develop. Most of the cream and mocha bubbles have floated away, but a nice noodle thin bracelet hugs the edge of my glass. Decent lacing can be noted with a few patches of bubbles holding on to dear life around the edges. With a bit more carbonation this would be good to look at.  Bouquet Intensely smoky. I feel like a cigarette was blown into my face, unfortunately. It isn't campfire or burnt grain. It is nicotinic in nature for my nostrils. Overwhelming to the point that I almost missed the chocolate. The coffee is melded into the initial aromas. It takes quite a bit of effort to weasel out what is the cigarette and what is the coffee.  Flavor Profile Just like the nose, the flavor opens up intensely smoky. It isn't as carcinogenic in taste, but still reminds me of a cigarette. The coffee is extremely faint. It comes through in the common bitterness of black coffee, but the other flavors I normally find in coffee stouts are missing.  I would say it is more a chocolate and smoke beer than anything else. The finish is quite lovely, though, reminiscent of quality dark chocolate melted in my mouth five minutes ago.  Oral Sensations This is probably where this beer shines the most. It floats into my mouth like a tongue snuggy. Its full bodied presence leaves interesting resides on my palate, lips, and teeth. They are the evolved molecules of the liquid. Positively enjoyable and with little drawbacks.  When sipping this beer, I find it to be one of the smoothest stouts I have had to date. It has minimal tingling due to carbonation, and flows with the greatest of ease around my mouth and esophagus.  Conclusions An interesting beer. It is almost exactly like I remembered from months ago. The flavors are quite underwhelming, although unique. The aromas are nauseating in a health perspective sense and yet... I still find myself feeling like I may drink another in the future.  A side note really quick, the 8.3% alcohol seems to be a lie. I feel this alcohol in both mind and body faster than beers labeled at a higher alcohol than this. It is definitely a strong buzz forming from a single bottle of this brew.  It is not a beer I would want anytime soon again, but I feel that is a lie. Maybe it really does have nicotine in this bad boy. My brain tells me I shouldn't want another, but my body craves it. I know it is not good, but I find I can't say no to another sip.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,AaronHomoya,4.75,"Mmmm... beer for breakfast. Love this on a Saturday morning with some biscuits and bear-sausage gravy!  This is a great stout. Near-black color with a fine lacing of tan head on top. Smells like coffee, dark chocolate and a bit of earthy hops. Taste is so good and smooth! Full of the same flavors and a satisfying roastiness. The mouthfeel I feel is a slight bit thin, but overall this is such a great, drinkable beer.

Completely brown head. Crazy lacing  S: Chocolate undertones, but this smells like a Starbucks more than a beer. Like freshly ground arabica beans. Hoppy, and creamy like mocha. Extremely fresh. Delicious  T: Deep black freshly brewed coffee. Like a cold mocha from Starbucks. Pure deliciousness. What a stout should be. Even though it's a little lacking in the other categories of what a stout should be, its still damn good.  M: Very boozy. Almost not at all carbonated. Heavy on the mouthfeel, but delicious.  D: Fan-effing-tastic. Probably the best stout I've had to this point.

When held up to the light there was no way to see through it.  S - Very rich chocolate and coffee notes. A whiff of this makes you feel like you are sitting next to the river of chocolate at Willy Wonka's.  T - Hints of sweetness with the bitterness of chocolate and coffee. The smoothness of the oats combines all of the flavors together in a very balanced way.  M - Thick yet smooth. If I were going to make a beer milkshake I would definitely use this.

A - Slightly hazy, very dark rubyish brown with a short, long-lived creamy mocha head.  S - Chocolate and coffee, a slight earthy hop aroma. Little bit of alcohol.  F/M - Dark bitter chocolate with a big wallop of coffee, too. Dark fruity pruney/raisiny esters and melanoidin flavors. Firm bitterness leads to a very smooth and clean finish. Very low earthy hops detected. Creamy, medium-full bodied with a moderately-low carbonation; perfect. Clean aftertaste with a slight lingering chocolate flavor.  D - Excellent drinkability especially for such a bold beer. The flavors are all balanced so well, and the hoppy bitterness really helps this beer go down smoothly.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,psychotia,3.35,"Bottled 08/14/09  A: Great pour with a large 3 finger head that slowly settled to lace the glass after a few minutes. Oh it is black.  S: Nice blend of roasted coffee and chocolate. Probably my favorite part of this beer.  T: This is where I wasn't too happy. At this point, I'm not surprised that the coffee is almost completely gone (being over a year old), but I was quite overwhelmed with the sweetness from the chocolate/sugar. I wonder if they used any lactose (pure or in the chocolate)... regardless, it was too sweet for me and I would have preferred more balance.  M: Good. I like a slightly thicker mouthfeel, but I have no big qualms with this medium-bodied stout.  D: Well, I was ready to be done with it halfway through, but I did finish the bottle. Again, it was just too sweet. Alcohol was very well hidden though. Would never guess it was &gt;8%.  While let down by all the hype, I realize this bottle is a year old.

It's excellent.  The pour is viscous and thick as you would expect. You can smell the chocolate in the nose. The taste is sharp, yet it has that sweetness that makes it taste so great. The consistency is just about what you would want from a stout.  I also love that this beer is available in 12 oz bottles, so that you can enjoy one without having to finish a whole 22oz.

S: Light, slightly metallic notes of roasted coffee and dark toasted malt. T: Tastes like creamy coffee ice-cream. Loads of milk chocolate comes through as well. Upon warming notes of oatmeal and roasted grains poke through, along with some faint grassy hops and molasses. Finish has some subtle dark chocolate bitterness and coffee acidity to it. A bitter-sweet aftertaste lingers for a very long time. M: Full bodied with a very creamy mouthfeel due to the delicate soft carbonation. Alcohol is barely noticeable against the onslaught of flavor. Mouthfeel is really soft and wonderful. D: Very well crafted combination of ingredients in this one.

1199,11757,zoso1967,4.5,"For my 200th review I wanted to do a special beer enjoyed on a memorable night. Thanks to my good friend TCgoalie for being the guide on my first trip to Founders Tap Room!  This fresh 2010 breakfast stout arrived at our table looking as pitch black as always with a nice frothy tan head. The head sticks to my glass and leaves wonderful lacing as I partake of its yummy goodness. The aroma has a full on coffee kung-fu grip on my nostrils and I am loving it. Dark roasted malts and bitter cocoa fight to stand out against the beans, but despite their best effort, they only managed to add support and depth. The flavor is superb with more of the fresh coffee beans from the nose, bitter chocolate, astringent roasted dark malts and, what's this? Herbal, grassy and slightly skunky hops somehow make their way through the pitch black madness. This is one of those stouts that it is easy to close your eyes and imagine you are eating some sort of delicious dessert. The body is full, but not crushingly heavy or chewy. It has a great smoothness to it and a finish that is a mile long. The ABV is totally hidden and I could drink quite a few of these and still want more. I wish I could get this on tap more often.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,claspada,4.02,"Pours a soild, dark carbonated black pour, creating a thick, toffee head.  Aroma of stale, cold coffee; which isnt a bad thing like. This is truly a coffee lovers beer and if you don't like coffee, you just made the wrong choice.  Tastes like a strong cup of coffee with a mouthfeel of chocolate and maybe a spike of alcohol as well. Hops may contribute to the bitterness but there is no way of knowing for sure. Very well thought out and well put together. All the flavors of the chocolate, coffee, oatmeal and caramel malts come together harmoniously. As the beer warms up, more of the same; the stronger flavors becoming more prevalent.  The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy; you need to be in the mood for this sort of beer. Not a hot weather or daytime beer, for me at least. Winter after a nice meal on a Friday night, cuddled up with a loved one, is more my style.  The high ABV is the only negative and causes the drinkability level to hault at one for me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Spider889,4.8,"Damn, I need to stock up on this whenever I see bottles from now on. This is definitely a beer I underestimated. Had on tap at Buckeye Beer Engine in Lakewood last weekend.  The beer is an excellent black with a dark toffee-colored head that leaves a super thick blanket of lacing down my snifter. (I took pictures it was so beautiful)  Smells of coffee, chocolate malts, and has a nice sweetness underlying it all.  The taste begins with lots of well-made coffee, but it is not overbearing like some coffee stouts can be. It's sweet enough to be extremely palatable, but also dry and bitter enough for balance. There's a smidgen of dark fruit underlying the coffee and lots of creamy, bready roasted malts. I would honestly drink this every day with breakfast if it were possible (and socially acceptable!)  Medium bodied and goes down smoothly with absolutely no hint of alcohol at all.  I found Breakfast Stout to be extremely drinkable. Ultimately I smelled more alcohol than I tasted. I had been wanting to check out Buckeye Beer Engine for some time, and finally getting my wish, I only ordered this since it was on tap. I ordered one, was very impressed, and ordered a second. I would have likely gotten a third but we had to go. I think I could sit down with a 4-pack of this and not think twice about drinking the whole thing myself in a single sitting. A sessionable Imperial Stout? Maybe it's the oats (which I'm a sucker for), but this is one of my new favorite beers.  &lt;edit&gt; I have ordered as many as four in a sitting on tap. Really is a wonderfully sessionable beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Keffa,3.84,"Poured into a standard pint glass.  A: Pours dark black, with a small, tan head that dissipated quickly and leaves only a small ring around the top. No lacing, and not surprising, given the ABV and style.  S: Chocolate, coffee, smoke, a little bit of a fresh made caramel, a little bit of a spicy, almost hop like character. I like this aroma a lot. Hopefully I'm not let down...  T: Nice. Chocolate and coffee are the two main components to this one, with them playing tug of war with your tastebuds. A little hop bitterness, along with the dark roast bitterness play off the sweetness of the chocolate quite well. Nice clean finish.  M: THICK. Only word to describe it. A little oily as well, and coats your mouth completely.  D: Not too shabby. I prefer the Blackout to this, but I can see why so many like it. It's not bad, by any means at all. I might try to get a fresher bottle and see if it changes my opinion of it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,TheStove,4.35,"I knew nothing about this beforehand but I love this beer. I've been out and started drinking before noon and this would be the perfect starter to any such session.  Nice big pour of black as night goodness into a snifter with a solid finger of foam.  Tons of coffee, true to the ""Breakfast"" motif. Like your morning cup o' joe this one cuts through the haze. Nice strong coffee flavor with slight cream notes through the swallow. Coffee and chocolate sit on the tongue between sips. Again, like coffee at times the bitterness can just cut through everything but that isn't bad. As you get further down the glass it all settles nicely on your palette and again like your morning coffee you're ready for another.  Great beer and in my opinion better than the somewhat comparable Bell's Java Stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,EricCioe,4.25,"This stuff is thick and real dark. It pours and looks like spent motor oil. I consider that a positive.  The first thing I got on the nose was brussel sprouts. Really. It must be some peculiar combination of the oatmeal, chocolate, and coffee, combined with my own particular body chemistry. But it wasn't just the first whiff of the first one. It's been all the way to the bottom of both glasses I've had. It's shocking.  The taste is lots of oatmeal with a hint of coffee to me. I'm not getting much chocolate, so I'm guessing that it's one of those things like bass in a metal band, that you'd notice if it were gone, but can't point to it in particular.  The mouthfeel is huge, like a creamy soup. Love it.  It's not super boozy, but it feels like eating a meal. I could drink maybe two of these most nights.  Big fan of the beer, even with the bizarre nose, which seems to be something with me and not with the beer.  EDIT - After drinking a couple hundred brews between loving this one and not, I've found the coffee to be a little on the stale side. It's still a world-class stout, but after having this and Expedition on back to back nights, I had to shift around the ratings to reflect the change in my tastes.  EDIT 2 - Had 2010 and 2011 vintages at a Founders brunch in our tasting group. Both of them had a strange vegetal off flavor. I know, coffee beers have to be enjoyed fresh, but 6 months should not turn an otherwise good beer into a drainpour.

1199,11757,HitokiriNate85,4.4,"2009 bottle.  A - Pitch black with a dark tan head that looks nearly identical to a chocolate milkshake. It also clings to the glass in every direction, something uncommon in the realm of imperial stouts.  S - If you made chocolate chocolate chip cookies with coffee, this is what they would smell like. The coffee isn't nearly as prominent as in a fresh bottle, but it has given way to something that smells just as good. It smells like an awesome mix of milk and dark chocolates.  T - I think the earlier analogy still applies, but the taste presents the sweetness and bitterness in succession instead of simultaneously. I remember fresh bottles having much more bitterness, though, and a slightly noticeable hop flavor, which has definitely stepped down at this point. There's just a ton of chocolate oatmeal notes with the coffee providing more of an undertone now than a dominating flavor. The finish is almost fudgey, with the alcohol and coffee giving the chocolate flavors the oomph to provide that kind of richness.  MF - Incredibly silky smooth with a carbonation level that just peeks in to help the whole process without hindering the richness of it. Leaves the mouth feeling creamy and a bit sticky.  D - It does really well here, but I'm still glad it comes in 12 oz. bottles. When I was first trying coffee stouts, I remember wanting them to taste basically like an iced coffee, but having this aged does a lot to change my mind. The flavors meld in such an great way that it's hard to argue with what's in front of me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The background is roasted malts and some slight, slight vanilla presence there as well.  T - Delicious mix of chocolate and dark chocolate. Nice bitterness from both, but it is nicely rounded out from the hops and the oats that are present. Some brown sugary flavor as well that adds a little needed sweetness to a bitter beer. Extremely well rounded beer.  M - Silky smooth on the palate. Slightly carbonated which makes it a nice smooth, silky feeling. Nice and robust feeling and flavor that is quite perfect.

Mouthfeel/ Drinkability - Coats the glass and your mouth very well. Balanced by the sweetness of the sugary and syrupy notes and the bitterness and alcohol flavors.

One of the best chocolate scents I have ever smelled in a beer. Rich milky chocolate, coffee, burnt malts, just a delicious smell. The taste is somewhat the reverse of the scent. Strong coffee upfront, somewhat bitter with a rich chocolate backbone. You can pick up some of the bitterness from the burnt malts in the backend of the palate. Great balance and not a hint of the 8.3 ABV. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Not as thick as I would have expected but very nice.

1199,11757,Swill5786,4.73,"A - Beautiful. Opaque black, one finger brownish mocha head. Fades rather quickly but I can't hold that against this amazing little Coffee Stout.  S - Alcohol with sweet, dark fruits, vanilla, and an almond-liquor-like essence. Coffee and chocolate undertones. Can't wait to taste!  T - Chocolatey start is quickly joined by an alcohol kick intensified by a brilliant coffee bitterness. I lose the rich, smooth Kona flavor altogether in the blend of the alcohol and powerful Sumatra. It is fantastic, however - nearly as strong a coffee flavor as the brew from a pound of unadulterated, full-strength Sumatran coffee a friend brought me directly from Aceh, Indonesia - traditionally prepared by filtering through a sock. Awesome flavor!!  M - Super heavy in a good way. Close to the famed Rochefort 10. Dryish finish.  D - Just one will satisfy... Could get too mug of this good thing. But worth drinking right up to that line!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Lacing is there but not clinging to the glass like most Imperial's do.  S- Dark roasted coffee, just shy of burnt roasts. Brown sugar, vanilla, oak earthy smell, raisins, caramel and a hint of molasses.  T- Roasted coffee, vanilla, raisins not reallygetting the chocolate out of this one. I know it's there but not nearly as prevelant to deem it a ""Double chocolate stout"" the bitter coffee lingers on the palate for a while which makes you start craving the next sip.  M- It's thinner than you would come to expect in a Imperial Stout which is kind of a nice change of pace. Makes the idea of having more than one in a night a possibility  D- If your a coffee lover like me you'll be craving every single sip.

1199,11757,donniecuffs,4.18,"Poured black into a snifter, with nearly three fingers of brown head, visibly modest carbonation, good head retention, and very good lacing. The nose revealed coffee, bittersweet chocolate, oak, and roasted malt. The taste was even more pronounced, beginning on a coffee note, then progressing to a woody slight-chocolate note, and then finishing on a dry roasted note. Very nice flavor progression. Surprisingly very thin...probably the only glaring knock that I have on this beer. If I really feel like being picky, I'd say maybe a little more chocolate would be cool, but again that's being picky. This is a great (session?) stout as it is.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,CHL,4.06,"Very amusing beer to pour. Tall, thick, smooth brown head over a viscous opaque black body. The head persists for some time, clinging to the glass.  The smell is heavy coffee with noticeable hops, and a dark fruit kind of punch.  It's an outstandingly thick beer with some complexity. It has coffee, of course, and velvety dark chocolate (presumably smoothed by the oats), there are noticeable hops rounding it out as well, although the bitterness comes through heavy roasted notes.  Feels thick and satisfying in the mouth--about as thick as they come--but too rich for me to drink more than one of them.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,JackieTH,4.63,"Wow. Right away, this is an excellent brew.  I really enjoy the Founder's bottle artwork, excellent as usual.  Pours a rich, smooth, dark chocolaty brown almost black into a chilled pint glass with a finger of deep thick looking mocha brown head. Where's my spoon when I need it?  Inhaling deeply over the rich brown foam brings inviting wafts of chocolaty infused oatmeal, roasted malts, and coffee.  The first mouthful is spectacular. Creamy thick velveteen texture is just right. Chocolaty. Oatmeal and roasted malts. Robust coffee but not espresso strength. More rich chocolate following. Perfectly balanced with a bit of bitterness. The second pull quickly leads to a third, and then an empty glass this brew is simply fantastic. Again, wow! More please.  Is there any alcohol in this?

1199,11757,djmichaelk,4.12,"12oz bottle into a snifter. Courtesy of BucketBoy (thanks, Joe!)  A - Dark brown to black pour, with a milk-chocolate colored head that rises a couple fingers high. It died down pretty quickly, leaving a solid cap that's thicker toward the edges. Some lacing, but not a lot.  S - This won't be a shock, exactly, but COFFEE!! I love coffee beers, and this one doesn't let me down. There's some chocolate and cocoa, and hops are in the background just enough to let me know.  T - Coffee and vanilla are the dominant flavors up front. Creme brulee and cake-iness are there midpalate, followed by a bit of dark sugar and the bitterness of the hops. Nice, but not overwhelming.  M - Thick and velvety, but the carbonation tends to make it fade a bit too quickly. The coffee gives it a dryness that I wasn't expecting.  D - It's actually a pretty high abv, although for the style it's average or less than most. I could see me having a few of these every morning.  O - How do I get more of these out here?

Palate is thick. Thick finish with some extent of bitter chocolate and breakfast food (a slight sense of hot sauce and omelet). A complex flavor and a very good beer.

It smells and tastes like my favorite beverage (coffee) it is easy to find in a bottle and on tap. It is inexpensive and has a good abv so that it does not get you too drunk. This beer tastes like heaven. It smells and tastes just like coffee. I have had this beer so much and it has never disappointed me. It has a nice thick jet black body with a brown head.

So chocolatey and so much coffee. The beer smells absolutely delicious and just so robust and flavorful. Hints of burnt malts...but just mainly coffee and dark chocolate. This beer tastes SO WELL BALANCED. I love it! Initially, I get such a soothing taste of espresso, followed by a very tasty chocolate that just makes my palate extremely happy. I then get some very sweet notes that linger on my palate (kinda like sweet coffee ice cream). I must also add, that as this beer warms up, the scents sort of blend together to make a sort of chocolate cake scent. The alcohol is scary how well hidden it is. The mouthfeel is almost perfect.

T: a distinct coffee taste, nearly overwhelming the chocolate, though it lingers during the aftertaste, reminded me of eating chocolate pancakes at breakfast with black coffee to wash it down.

That film of a head disappears quickly, however, likely a victim of the 8.3% ABV. No lace left behind.  S: First impression, not surprisingly, is of the coffee. Roasted coffee beans and just plain coffee. As it warms I get more of a chocolatey smell, but coffee is the dominant scent throughout.  T: Roasted, even slightly burnt, coffee. Husky roasted cereal grains. As I drink it more, the roasted acidity subsides and I begin to get more chocolate -- both dark chocolate, with the commensurate bitterness, and milk chocolate, with its sweetness. The chocolate becomes more pronounced as it warms, though the coffee and roasted barley-like bitterness never entirely subsides. Bitterness on the finish and lingering afterwards.

Slick, creamy, oily with a medium amount of carbonation.  The drinkablility of this beer is really good. I barely can taste the alcohol. It's almost like a chocolate milkshake.

1199,11757,TCHopCraver,4.69,"Reviewed from notes on 5/19/10. Served in a snifter at just above room temperature.  A: This brew pours black with a slight brown tinge. Its beige-brown head begins at 1/2 a finger and disappears almost immediately, leaving a whispy cloud look with one big bubbly patch floating on the body. The lacing is attractive and reminds me of stylistic A.W. Tillinghast bunkers.  S: I detect a heavy dose of oatmeal at first smell. A deeper intake reveals massive coffee and dark chocolate notes. I also smell brown sugar, toffee, and a hint of dark fruits. This would serve well as breakfast and dessert. Heavenly.  T: A flavor bonanza has erupted in my mouth. Astrigent, bitter coffee hits the sides of my tongue, which is then cascaded upon by a delicious semi-sweet chocolate and oat wave. Bittering hops kick in at the end and are supported all the while by the lovely coffee flavor. I've had this on tap at Founders and in bottles - on tap has been better balanced, while the bitterness of the beer just barely overbalances the sweetness in bottle form.  M: There is a great play between the bitterness of coffee and hops on the sides of my palate and the full sweetness and chewiness that disperses over the entirety of my mouth. It is rich and acidic at the same time.  D: Breakfast Stout is immensely drinkable. I have had this many a time and I will continue to enjoy its flavorful complexities through the years of my life. Of the Founders Breakfast Stouts, I like CBS slightly more than this beer, with KBS bringing up the rear by a nose in a three horse photo finish.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Very dark, very thick, I got almost no head on the pour, but the look of the jet black beer was nice.  The first sip was intense, alot of strong flavor coming out at you.  The taste lived up to the look, very potent thick, and strong, I could taste the chocolate/coffee taste pretty well, almost to the point of reminding me of tobacco. Sounds weird but that is what crossed my mind, but it was not in a negative way. I let it warm up a little and as I continued with the beer I liked it more and more. Very smooth for how dark and thick it is, I could easily down a few of these. Tasted slightly, complex beer, alot going on in the taste department.  My only complaint about it, is it tastes a bit too much like a milkshake or a Starbucks drink, and not a beer. Too much chocolate/coffee taste in my opinion.

1199,11757,ktrillionaire,4.65,"A - Perfect huge blackness with a giant frothy deep mocha head, with massive lace  S - Big coffee and chocolate aroma from the get-go, with some slight booze. Good roasted tones, and sweet chocolate-y maltiness remain in focus throughout. This is basically the essence of what a Double Stout can and perhaps should be all about.  T - Good-to-great taste, though slightly underperforming, due to several factors including drinking a bit hot, especially given the 8%. The characteristics, in a raw sense, are undeniably superb; it is in apportionment and cohesion that imperfections occur. It gets much nicer as it warms and airs out, as most stouts do. There are huge dark chocolate flavors, especially lingering into the finish. Some oat is discernible, but balanced well enough to avoid any semblance of oat chalkiness; it mostly gives it a grainy quality which underperforms because of relatively low viscosity. The coffee flavors are present in respectable, and dare I say sublimely reserved levels; the java notes seem to meld with the hop bitterness.  M - A tad thin, I think the oat is the culprit, as it gives it a general Brown Ale feel.  D - The look is pure paradigm, the smell is outstanding, and the taste is very good. These factors are listed in descending order, and I would rather see the order reversed; taste is more than 40% of the equation in my book.

The head is a brown chocolate and coffee black; it is humongous and blankets the outside of the glass all the way down giving life to this viscous black delectable fluid.  Smell: When I picked this beer up and it's essence assaulted my nostrils for the first time I finally understood why it was call the ""breakfast stout"". Suddenly memories of breakfast past raced through my mind, black coffee, sausage, eggs, toast ...and strawberries? Dark chocolate, and coffee first assault the nostrils, followed by a sweeter fruity flavour of strawberries and finally malted barley and oatmeal finish this beer off. Then, I notice something else harkening me to many an early morning, thick strong black coffee pronounced again and again manifesting itself in this beer's aroma.  Taste: I have been overwhelmed with flavour! The noseful does not pay homage to the actual flavours inherent in this stout. First and foremost is the intense but not overwhelming coffee essence, it is in perfect balance with the rest of this masterpiece. A dark chocolate flavour with an oatmeal texture introduces itself with a sweet hint, milk chocolate covered cherries; this balances well against an equally strong critic bitterness of hops finally a strong cup of coffee finishes this beer off, lingering for what seems ages. Absolutely astounding! The oatmeal texture/flavour is what makes this beer a God among men.  Mouthful: An extraordinary mouthful of beer with a smooth oatmeal flavour and black coffee finish, with the viscosity of melted chocolate.

'10 a - black like oil, small thick head. looks heavy. s - smoke and coffee t - bitter, roasted coffee. very smokey. m - heavier body, still good carbonation. overall - good flavor, but has a bitterness that lingers. too smokey.  '08 a - same s - much less smokey, much more caramel. coffee. t - much cleaner flavor with age. bitterness dies down. still strong in coffee. m - same overall - IMO its a lot better with age.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S-Coffee, dark chocolate,sweet molasses and roasted malt aromas are pleasingly sensed. T-Expresso coffee taste with chocolate hints. There is some bitterness but it has a nice smokey mocha finish. M-Creamy and thick with minimal carbonation. The bitterness at the swallow gives way to nice oaky afternotes. D-This is a very good stout that could easily be enjoyed often. It does not have the syrupy taste that some beers of this class do, nor the dryness of others. Well balanced, well done!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,skullsplitter,4.45,It's been a long time since I have had this. I can't believe I forgot how great this beer really is.  It poured pitch black and somewhat syrupy from the bottle. It looked a lot thicker than it actually was. There wasn't a head and there was barely any lacing. Right away I could smell the chocolate aroma as well as nice coffee notes. It reminded me of Young's double chocolate in terms of smell. A nice balance.  The taste was creamy and surprisingly rich. Nice body. The roasted taste really takes over. You get a little bit of the booze in the aftertaste. For almost 9% these go down pretty easily. Its dangerous. The toasted oatmeal caught my attention. It really gave the drink a unique feel and taste. It has a slightly chewy mouthfeel.  This is right up there as a favorite. Everything I have tried from Founders has really been unbelievable.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,SeasonalBrew,4.52,"A: Pours pitch black with a dark brown head. Some retention which leaves a nice sticky lacing on the glass.  S: Amazing combo of sweet and dark chocolate! A nice balance of coffee in there, too.. maybe even some hazelnut.  T: Delicious chocolate, toasted oats, and a strong coffee finish. It's all so well balanced.  M: Slightly thick and chewy.  D: For 8.3%, it is damn good. I took my time and enjoyed every drink.  I had the opportunity to have KBS before this, and I gotta say, this is one hell of a base beer. I'm going to see what a few more months of aging does to my other one. There was only a slight burn to this one.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,camp0474,4.23,"A: Pours a thick black with a dark tan head.  S: Strong smells of toasted malt and coffee. Faint smells of oats and chocolate. Complex to the nose, this has to be good.  T: Coffee hits strong then toasted malts reappear. More coffee flavor than I could detect from the smell...Tasty! Flavor of bitter chocolate mix in with the coffee.  M/D: Thick, rich, and smooth texture. Lots of fine carbonation. Coffee makes the finish a bit dry as you would expect. But very drinkable.  Had this after my first KBS, I see where the greatness begins. Solid beer, having this again for sure.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Kallessin,4.78,"Pours black with a huge dark tan cocoa colored head. The glass was filled with foam with more than half the beer still left in the bottle. It took forever to settle and as portions of the foam collapsed, it left a big dollop of foam.  Has a very strong dark bittersweet chocolate aroma with deep roasted malt and layers of sweet milk chocolate underneath. There is also a deep roasted coffee bean aroma along with it with hints of hop aroma.  The flavor is very much like the aroma with a blend of dark bittersweet chocolate and sweet milk chocolate with strong roasted coffee underneath. It has a wonderful bitter roastiness with light burned malt flavors. I get a little astringency in the background but is very fleeting and some hop bitterness on the finish. A dry roasted aftertaste.  Its full bodied with a fantastic smooth and creamy texture with moderate carbonation. There's a also a little pepperiness to it and it leaves a dry sticky feeling.  This is a very rich and hearty beer, but not filling. The chocolate and coffee blend perfect together with a texture that ties it all together. A truly exceptional beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,stangski83,4.4,"Pours jet black and with a brownish foam that reminds me of used motor oil. The biggest difference in that comparison would be viscosity of the two - as this one pours fairly watery. Breakfast Stout does not leave a bunch of lacing on the sides of my glass, and the smell/taste are definitely reminiscent of black coffee. I detect a hint of vanilla (not sure if this is correct?) and definitely some heavy tones of dark chocolate. Beautifully roasted malt action here to be sure. I wouldn't say this is my all time favorite stout, but it's darn close. I'm impressed that the alcohol isn't terribly noticeable despite checking in at 8.3%, but then again many brewers seem to be hiding the ABV well these days. This is my first time sampling from the bottle as I have only previously enjoyed this one on tap. I still prefer the tap version, but this is an impressive imperial stout and another impressive offering from the genius brewers at Founders. Yum!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,cratez,4.3,"Bottle sample courtesy of Adil. Pours a dense black hue with two fingers of bubbly tan head and globs of lacing on the snifter. Smell and taste are roasted malts, strong black coffee, dark bitter chocolate, cocoa power, oatmeal, and creamy espresso. ABV is untraceable. I can see why they call this a ""Breakfast Stout,"" as the coffee/espresso flavours are massive. Mouthfeel is rich and silky, full side of medium, long drying finish with a lingering hop bitterness and toasted-coffee afters. A divine imperial stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,emmasdad,4.1,"Pours a deep opaque black, with a nice lingering inch of tan foam. On the nose, I get mostly coffee, but also some roasted malt and dark chocolate.

Amazing.  T: Sweet oats, vanilla and toasted malt up front, then the roasted coffee and chocolate take center stage. Long coffee and bittersweet chocolate finish. Very rich and dark, strong flavors.  M/D: Full bodied, very velvety smooth mouthfeel. Carbonation is surprisingly a little high. Drinkability is decent, huge bold flavors and coffee is very apparent.  A little too much coffee taste for my liking, but still excellent. Very much like KBS minus the 1+ year of aged bourbon amazingness.

1199,11757,kylehayworth,4.8,"This was my first true, Imperial Stout, and what a good one. This beer blew my mind, and made me want to experience all the craft beer world had to offer, thank you Breakfast Stout!  A: Pours a nice motor oil color, and forms an intense dark tan head.  S: Bitter cocoa chocolate and deep roasted coffee.  T: This is such a well balanced beer, the bitter chocolate and roasted coffee play so well with each other. There is also a slight sweetness that plays referee to these two flavors.  M: Rich, creamy, and smooth.  D: This is extremely drinkable. I think this beer is vastly under rated, and holds a top place in Founder's beer line up. If it wasn't for KBS, this would be their most talked about beer.

1199,11757,bwiechmann,4.5,"I have been coveting this brew for a little while and scored some along with some KBS. I tried this first and was not disappointed. Poured from the 12oz bottle with some awesome artwork on the label into an over-sized snifter. Served at around 55-60 degrees.  Appearance- Poured a thick- impenetrable, light-sucking black. The mocha-colored head is a thick, boiling substance which seems as though it will linger forever. It settles down into a 1/4 inch thick shield against oxygen- beer's evil-foe.  Smell- Pure olfactory bliss here. Incredibly complex- yet somewhat predictable based on the beers description as a 'double-chocolate oatmeal stout.' Coffee is present first and foremost and is prominent throughout the whiff. As a coffee-lover this is heaven in a scent. The coffee carries roasted, dark chocolate on its back along with roasted barley and oats.  Taste- Coffee does not dominate here as it did in the nose. Instead, the dark, bitter-sweet chocolate notes walk hand-in-hand with the dark espresso beans. Incredibly rich and complex and an absolute treat. The bitterness from the hops add another dimension to this beer that really capult it into the ranks of the elite. Awesome.  Mouthfeel- Full bodied beer and again, incredibly rich with perfectly mild carbonation.  Drinkability- An excellent sipping brew. While you probably could drink a few I believe they should be savored throughout the night and enjoyed for the amazingness it truly is.  Founders scores huge here and crafts one of my all-time favorites. This brew would have scored a few 5's had I not followed it up by a KBS- after that I had to leave room for improvement. Believe the hype and seek this out!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,GeezLynn,4.32,"A: Black, with the slightest brown glow around the edges. Head is a lighter brown with average retention.  S: Rich aroma of freshly ground espresso that is well-integrated with a deep chocolate malt. I also get a little vanilla, licorice and earthiness.  T: Lots of bitter coffee flavor up front. Underneath the coffee there's a slightly sweet, roasted malt body accompanied by finishing dark chocolate and licorice and a slight alcohol burn.  M: Pretty smooth with a medium level of carbonation. Could be slightly thicker for my preferences, but it's a minor complaint.  One of the many outstanding brews in the Founders stable. I like this as a nice medium between the coffee of Peche Mortel and chocolate flavors of Brooklyn BCS.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,femALEist,3.95,"Had this out of the bottle from a bottle trade.  This poured a dark brown, almost black with some red highlights.  It had a huge nose, with roasted malt, toasted cereal, vanilla and espresso.  It tasted of bitter coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, toasted malts and left your tongue bitter and dry.  It was a little light in mouthfeel, it seemed more of a porter than a stout to me. Not sure if it's worth all the hype it gets, but it's pretty good.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,bobsy,3.88,"Bottle tasted side by side with KBS.  Pours a pitch black with a quickly rising khaki head that catches me by surprise, and results in a two-stage pour. The head slowly drops to a finger of foam and leaves some nice sticky lace on the glass. I prefer them creamier, but this is a solid appearance. Good dark roast aromas - coffee, black chocolate, tobacco and a touch of molasses.  The flavour reveals this to be a very satisfying and well-constructed imperial stout, though I don't come across anything that outs it into the truly exceptional category you would expect for a beer that BAs currently view as the 27th best in the world. Nice coffee roast throughout provides a smooth bitterness and is expertly complimented by dark chocolate notes. A smoky, tobacco middle eventually gives way to the reassertion of coffee in the finish. Now we come to my gripe with this beer - the carbonation is simply way too high. Perhaps this batch wasn't as well done as others because it lacks the silky complexity others have mentioned. Instead, it's a medium-bodied beer with medium-high carbonation, which is remedied by some agitation. I prefer my imperial stouts ot be thicker and smoother than this bottle.  Carbonation aside, you can tell this is a very good beer, but I prefer the regular Founders Imperial Stout to this, and KBS blows it out of the water. Its certainly very well made, but at no point exceptional, and its place in the top 100 seems unjustified.

1199,11757,elvisnj,3.43,"12oz bottle poured into a Sam Smith's beer glass.  Pitch black with slight brown colored head (It was a careful pour).  Strong coffee nose with a chocolate undertone. Caught some hops in the aroma as well. Smells and looks pretty good.  Pretty smooth brew but with a coffee blast on the back of the tongue. I think that the coffee overtook the hops as the source of bitterness. Taste was a bit too much on the black coffee and dark chocolate, and not enough on the beer/hops. The oatmeal is evident, and smoothed it out some, but not enough.  I know its a double coffee chocolate stout and I get that but I cant agree with all the A ratings for this beer. Maybe I just prefer more dark malt and hops in my stouts over chocolate and coffee.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Brettster,4.25,"Poured dark black, somewhat thick. Did not produce much of a head but left a nice ring around the beer. I can definitely smell the chocolate malts and coffee in this, maybe some vanilla. Starts off with a nice coffee and chocolate flavor and ends with a little hop flavor and bitter coffee. This is very well balanced and deliciously smooth. The outmeal definitely smooths this out and makes it a pretty drinkable breakfast stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,scooter231,3.78,"wow. this is pretty. pours like motor oil- dark, slick, opaque. no light getting through this baby. a pretty milk chocolate colored head stick around for a bit, then fades away, leaving a ring around the glass.  the nose is verrrry inviting. coffee-ed yoohoo, some nice bitter espresso notes. a hint of vanilla. rich hoppy and roasted notes coming through. there's also a smokey bbq kinda thing going on. in short- it smells good.  starts out with a big roasty bitter espresso hit, lots of bitter hoppyness, and that oatmealy flavor you'd expect, followed by, again, a yoohoo sweet malty little burst, and finishes very bitter. alcohol content is notable, but not overwhelming. this falls a liiittle flat for me, to be honest. it's got loads of potential, but it's just not what it could be.  mouthfeel is chewy and wet, a little sudsy.  overall, this is tasty, and i definitely prefer stouts to be bitter rather than on the sweet side- but i'd rather have southern tier's Choklat.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,jsanford,4.5,"This is my 1st official BA review, so I wanted to choose a good one. Poured into my trusty New Belgium globe glass from a CBX-filled growler. Right around 55 degrees.  A - Dark inky black, 3/4 inch milk-chocolate mousse head with good retention. Leaves a nice swirl in the center and a foamy ring around the edge of the glass  S - Sweet roasted coffee and bitter chocolate, slight oatmeal, slight vanilla. Wonderful.  T - Spot on with the nose. Bold roasted coffee. Cocoa powder. No real hop flavor but there's a definite bitterness. Great balance between some very strong aspects.  M - Chewy. Slightly thin with a wonderful carbonation that tickles the back of your throat as it goes down. Smooth.  D - Could easily drink this all night/day if not for the ABV. Definitely gets better as it warms up, much of the bitterness fades and the flavors meld together nicely.  This is one of my favorite beers from my absolute favorite brewery. Obviously doesn't get the hype that its cousins get but where KBS is a special-occasion beer, I never feel bad about pulling out one of these on a whim (especially with some bacon and eggs)!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,thisisxxmyIPA,4.38,"A- Dark stout, obviously. Head is the most impressive in this one. Thick foamy tan/brown head with tons and tons of lacing and good retention.  S- Heavy roasted notes, malt, oatmeal, and a little bit of chocolate. Heavy spicy hop notes as well.  T- Odd beer. Heavy chocolate notes, the tiniest bit too much roasted barley, heavy oatmeal. Not much hop flavor. A very good beer, the roastyness does dissipate and the whole concoction becomes a very smooth delicious beast.  M- Best part about the beer. Low carbonation and thick feel literally make the ""breakfast"" part make sense. Awesome.  D- Quite drinkable after the roastyness faded with temperature. ABV is not apparent.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,yeahnatenelson,4.3,"Appearance - Pours a jet black with hardly a trace of carbonation. No head to speak of.  Smell - Dark chocolate, bitter coffee, mild hop presence, malty sweetness. Overall pretty acrid and acidic, like a mean cup of coffee.  Taste - Much like the smell, but more balanced and smoothed out. Dark chocolate, mildly acidic coffee, slight hop bitterness, malty sweetness with some mellowing from the oats. Finish is nearly all coffee.  Mouthfeel - everything you'd expect from a double stout: oily, viscous, a little heavy on the tongue. Also, this beer was incredibly smooth.  Drinkability - Now I understand the massive appeal of this beer. Wow. A really balanced, delicious double stout. It may lack all of the flash of its barrel-aged brothers, and perhaps a little bit of their complexity, but this beer absolutely pleases.

Smell: Wow. Smells like sticking your nose into a box of chocolate covered coffee beans. Smells sweet and very roasty. The nose on this really blew me away.  Taste: Bitter coffee is strongest, and chocolate is almost as powerful. Both are intense flavors. The oatmeal adds something real nice. The alcohol is detectable.  Mouthfeel: I could eat (not drink) this for breakfast. Oatmeal adds a lot to thicken the beer, and its ultra creamy and thick.  Drinkability: Good, but with a high ABV and such a huge body, not great - I expect that from an imperial though.  Coffee, chocolate and oatmeal are three items I eat just about every day.

T: More of a heavy dark chocolate flavour on the tongue as compared to the nose. Minor coffee - it's chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. Secondary notes of anise and licorice. Very good flavour overall.  M: Medium/full-bodied, very smooth, silky.  D: It's hard not to compare this to KBS and CBS, both of which blew me away.

The alcohol is hidden well but there is definitely a little heat at the finish.  M - Rich and creamy, but not too heavy. Moderate carbonation.  D - Quite drinkable though at 8.3% there are limits.

I love this smell. if it were a bit more complex it would be a definite 5. damn you BA ratings. Why no 4.75?  T- the coffee really has a nice deep roasted character and doesn't come off at all astringent. again, the chocolate battles the roasted character. the chocolate is more evident in the taste. besides the two huge main characters there is plenty of bitterness that has to at least partly thank the hop profile. lands on the bitter side of the sweet/bitter spectrum. the finish is mainly bready, bitter, roasty, with a hint of alcohol coming out near room temp.  M- probably the only real ""flaw"" of the beer. it could be a bit more thick/creamy considering it is an oatmeal stout. it's still what I would consider full bodied with a very pleasant carbonation level, but the viscosity just seems a bit lacking  D- a beer that you could take down quite quickly but it really demands that you savor the sweet espresso goodness. at $10 or under per 4pk I could see my self splitting a case with a friend every year if it were available in my market",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Some alcohol warmth in back of the mouth. One of my top Stouts...Only if Young's Oatmeal Stout was still available.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BostonBrewins,4.28,"Lucky enough to pick up the last 4 pack at my local package store.  A - Black as night with a very, very frothy brown head. Excellent head retention and alot of lacing. Nice looking beer.  S - Smells primarily of chocolate. Can definitely smell the coffee too. At times I thought it smelled strongly of hops, but perhaps that was just the coffee. What I smelled was great, but a little more muted than I expected. Some cinamon notes in there as well.  T - Flavors are big, bold, and very rich. Just like with the smell, the chocolate is the big player here but the coffee undertones provide some nice contrast. Sweetness from the chocolate is balanced off nicely with bitterness from the coffee and roasted barley.  M - Full bodied and very creamy. Very similar to the mouth feel from a chocolate milkshake. Perhaps a little too sticky/syrupy though.  D - Wow this is so rich I think I could only drink one of these in a session. But I would like to have one every day, preferably at breakfast.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S- Chocolate, charred malts, coffee beans, and a hint of vanilla.  T- Follows the nose. Milk chocolate and coffee up front. Roasted malts.... then I get the bitterness of dark chocolate. As it warms the flavors seem to intensify and I get a little of the warmth from the alcohol. I believe I like it better right around room temp.  M- Nice, thick, and creamy.

1199,11757,jokelahoma,4.38,"Poured into a Gulden Drak snifter.  Pours a nice opaque black with a large, fluffy tan colored head that recedes at a moderate pace.  Smell is full of coffee and chocolate. There's a hint of alcohol, but not much. Barely perceptible hop notes sneak in, but run away quickly. A slight bit of roasted malt char aroma is here too, but it hides among the coffee and cocoa as well. Nice intermingling of aromas here. Enticing.  Taste mirrors the aroma. Up front you get a good hit of coffee, though not as strong as some coffee stouts I've had in the past. The chocolate comes right behind, sweet at first, then trailing off toward bittersweet. No real hop flavor to speak of, but there is an underlying malt flavor that supports the other flavors extremely well. Again, the interplay between everything that is going on here is very nice, and the sum is definitely greater than the whole of the parts.  The mouthfeel is very rich and creamy, as befitting an oatmeal stout. It's satisfying without making you work to drink it.  Overall this is a nice beer. All the flavors listed (coffee, chocolate, oatmeal, etc.) are present, with none overwhelming any of the others. That balance can be hard to pull off, but Founders has done an excellent job. Not as intriguing as its bigger cousin, the Kentucky Breakfast Stout, but a fine beer in its own right. Highly recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,tippebrewcrew2,4.3,"I love you founders. Pours a silky black with dark red highlights. It has a large 3 finger creamy brown head. The nose is beautiful. Lots of coffee, dark chocolate, and an oatmeal sweetness. The nose really comes through on the palate with coffee upfront that blends into a deep tart sweet ester finish that leaves a long dark coffee tartness in your mouth. This is a great non-session beer. I feel that its brother (KBS) often overshadows it (respectively). This is a different beast and will take the chill out of winter. It hides its 8.3% very well through the bitter and tartness and the BA is left with a warming feel that seems to sooth over the day.

1199,11757,sohio,4.72,"Founders Breakfast Stout  Serving type: Bottle, poured into a DFH glass.  Ah, Founders BS. THE beer. The one that introduced me to craft beer, the one that I bring out and share with friends and family, the beer that let me know the difference between every other beer and craft beer. Motherfucker, its time to let the world know of your greatness. I'll explain why  My BS pours a soild, carbonated black pour, creating a thick, mocha head that rised up for a good two inches. After letting it settle for a minute, it takes on the apperance of a strong black coffee.  And it smells like that; old, cold coffee. Which I like. This is truly a coffee lovers beer and if you don't like coffee, you just made the wrong choice.  Tastes like a strong cup of joe with a mouthfeel of chocolate. Very well thought out and well put together. All the flavors of the chocolate, coffee, oatmeal and malts come together in line with each other. This is beer making at it's finest level.  The mouthfeel is more of the same, with the stronger flavors becoming more prevalent as it warms. You're gonna wanna brush your teeth after this beer.  The drinkability stands to be the only weak point of this. At 8.3% it's usually too late when you find out you've had enough. I can see why they sell this in 4 packs.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,rawthar,3.35,"I've been really looking forward to trying this, mainly based on the name alone.  A- Red tinged black with a very tiny head of coffee with cream that fizzles out early - presumably from the alcohol content. Like the color a lot, but I have to ding this beer for its unimpressive head. An enthusiastic swirl does however bring out a pretty milk chocolate head for a brief moment.  S- Iced coffee, sweet and bitter, maybe a very subtle hint of hops. Seems like the coffee could have been roasted a little toastier.  T- Iced coffee again, with the same raw bean characteristic as in the nose. The booze comes through to give you a little smack at the end. Really wish there was a bit more going on in this beer, but the coffee pretty much pushes any other complexities out of the way.  M- Slick and oily, creamy and buttery.  D- The intense coffee preoccupation makes this one tough for me, as I'm not a coffee drinker.  I know I'm an outlier in my opinion of this beer, but I really felt a bit let down. I guess I though the 'breakfast' angle was derived more from oatmeal content than coffee. I really wish there was more going on in this beer. Maybe I'll have to review again with a warm one.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The consistency is very thick and oily but the viscosity remains throughout the drink.  S: Wonderful coffee and nutty dark chocolate aroma. The overall smell is not incredibly strong, but definitely inviting.  T: Deep chocolate infused with a robust coffee flavor with hints of oatmeal and nutmeg. It is very complex, and there are probably a dozen other flavors going on here, I just can't put my finger on them though.  M: Very big feel to it. Covers the mouth well and goes down smooth.  D: Although being a very full-bodied stout with a hefty ABV, the smooth taste and feel to it makes it a great selection for a session beer. I recommend splitting a pitcher for a perfect amount.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,CharlatanSin,4.28,"Thanks to zoolzoo for trading this one to me. Will serve as a great preview for what to expect when Founders starts pouring in NYC shortly!  A: Pours a jet black with brown around the edges. The pour creates a dark tan head which doesn't stick around, but does leave some lacing as it goes. Everything an imperial stout should be.  S: Mostly chocolate up front, with some coffee. It actually smells more like coffee extract, the stuff they use to make iced coffee. There's some sort of vegetable or leafy scent that I can't place at all.  T: Definitely more complex and better than the smell (not that the smell was bad). Milk chocolate, definitely milder than the more bitter chocolate kick I'm used to in stouts. The coffee's good. There's just a hint of spice, which adds a nice level of complexity without being overdone. Alcohol comes out a bit as it warms. It's sweet up front, and has a nice bitter finish with a little hoppy hint.  M: Really sticky, and a little too syruppy. Carbonation's almost nonexistent. There's something a bit off about it.  D: Can't say it's my favorite, but it's definitely one of if not the most complex stout I've had.

1199,11757,wescj,4.43,"Glad to finally get the highly acclaimed breakfast stout in GA.  12oz bottle poured into pint glass.  Jet black in color, with a nice chocolate mousse head.  Aroma is a bit more subtle than I expected. Coffee is definately present, but the chocolate is somewhere in the shadows. There's a solid hop foundation, bit it too is hidden.  The individual tastes are easier to pick out in the flavor than in the aroma. The chocolate gets some character- specifically a darker quality. The coffee is also of a darker variety. The oatmeal texture smooths out these bold flavores, leaving a bold, roasty flavor without being overly dry. Very good, overall.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smell - Smells like chocolate flavored coffee, not that i have ever had that, but thats how it smells.  Taste - The coffee, and chocolate that exists in the nose follows with the first taste as well. The coffee flavor isn't some crap coffee you get at the gas station either. Its the high quality stuff you would get at some gourmet shop. Really excellent flavors.  Mouthfeel - very full bodied. This is a BIG American beer. Fantastic stuff!  Drinkability - Evene though it has a fairly high ABV i feel like i could drink a few of these in a sitting (2-3 probably). The only problem is you tend to become a little sleepy while drinking this.  Overall, another excellent beer from Founders.

Smells strongly of cold coffee, middle roast, backed up by some bitter cocoa and dark bread with flaked oats on top, and i dont know if its me having oatmeal porridge for breakfast, but I seem to detect a hint of that in the beer aswell.  Intially the coffee is pretty dominant, but as the beer warms up a bit, a pronounced sweeter than expected bitter dark chocolate enters my palate. There isn't very much mor too it to be honest, it is an oat-smooth orgy of chocolate and coffee, with no overly heavy roasted notes, and it is pretty yummy.

1199,11757,Flashsp2,4.47,"Founders Breakfast Stout (aged around 7 months)  Poured into slender tulip. Generated a quarter inch medium brown head, which was short lived. Thinned down to a small ring. Body is intensely dark and thick, almost pitch black, with dark brown opaque highlights.  Aroma is big, big roasted espresso, intensely roasty and almost acrid. Some faint cooked oats, and some bitter chocolate lingers in the back. Great aroma, even though the ABV isn't that high, the nose is quite intense.  Taste is a huge roasted espresso hit, some bakers chocolate, and some hop bitter. So creamy smooth and super chewy, the oats add immense body to this beer. Some floral hop in there as well, which is nice to see even with the aging. The finish is super long, with lots of coffee and baker's cocoa in there, and some faint cooked oat. Taste is slightly burnt around the edges, but not in a bad way. Taste is a bit malty sweet toward the center as it warms.  Mouthfeel is super chunky and chewy, like a chocolate-oatmeal snack bar. A nice carbonation cuts through about midway and brings forth more of the roasted flavor.  This is the kind of beer that I could (and would, if it were more available). Drinkability is superb, and this beer has it's ABV so well hidden that you don't realize how quickly it starts to fuzz the memory.

Totally opaque.  Nutty, burnt sugars, coffee aroma. Really pounds you with a earthy woodsiness, and the smoke from a dead ember. Just awesome.  Flavor is so heavily smoky, and thick with oily nuts, like brazil nuts and walnut. Bitter finish, but not overly done, in fact it is so balanced it may be the most sneakily flavorful stout I've ever had.  Sticky, viscous oily feel, thick and slick. Very heavy. And did I mention sticky? The one sticky shortcoming to this beer.  One of the finest stouts around. Period. Highly drinkable due to it not racking you over the head with a sack full of quarters and bitterness. The flavor, while substantial, is balanced and even.

A thin tan head accompanies it.  Smells of rich, creamy chocolate and a bit of roasted coffee. Nothing new to stouts, but the quality just seems to be a step above most of the rest.  Once again nothing new, but the quality of the taste is just a step above the rest. It hits the tip of my tongue sweet and chocolaty, but the bitter coffee taste takes over and fills the rest of my mouth. It finishes creamy around my mouth and bitter on my tongue.  An appropriate feel. The feel is creamy and thick with only the slightest hint of carbonation.

1199,11757,y2j2280,4.68,"A - Very dark (black), with a head resembling a root beer float. Upon first pour its a bit like when you drain oil from your late 80s british roadster.  S - Enigmatic.. complex nose, like a heavily used coffee filter from an italian espresso shop colliding with the aromas wafting from kitchen of a master belgian chocolatier  T - The flavor profile of this stout has several distinct stages, as opposed to some that seem to squeeze to much into a confined space. The initial flavor of milky chocolate and its delightful creaminess transitions elegantly to a flavor that makes one recall their vacation experience of enjoying a cup of espresso prepared by a beautiful dark-haired Italian barista whilst overlooking St. Peter's square in Rome. The advertised 60 IBUs of this malt beverage become more apparent in the finish as the previous notes have all but faded to a mellow and delightful bitterness.  M - The first thoughts upon imbibing are that of sipping from a half-pint of heavy cream. The ensuing experience is what I can only imagine as what one would feel if they were to attempt to ingest water-based paint. This is a welcome sensation.  D - For a beer of this ABV (8.3%) and stature it is remarkably easy to drink. As long as one is not in a rush and allows ample time to fully appreciate the splendor of this fine beverage, I would argue that there is no limit to the amount of this beer that one could drink (within the limits of human morality).",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

In your face alcohol and coffee flavors. (a good thing). The background has chocolate milk creaminess. Smooth brew, too smooth! Mouthfeel is semi chewey but yet so smooth.

1199,11757,ChadQuest,4.55,"Man let me say this first off.  I am REALLY picky when it comes to coffee stouts. As a huge coffee nerd, when the coffee profile is off, i notice, and i am harsh on it. Java Stout is one example, Surly Coffee Bender is a bit lesser example.  And then as soon as i rethink the entire style(withholding the mighty Peche Mortel), Founders comes out and makes a fantastic brew like FBS, and i no longer need to lose faith in the style.  With a beautiful balance off surprisingly well done roasty coffee flavors, strong Coco, earthyness, and vanilla, this one doesn't have that offensive stale coffee taste so common to the Coffee Stout style. The finish lets some of the coffee flavors linger a bit longer, and stand out just a bit more from the coco it shared the stage with at the start, but never reaches that cloyingly annoying level.  This one has quality flavors balanced with an excellent mouthfeel.  Yea, an excellent mouthfeel, i think this is one of the real keys of this beer, and partially how it tromps the others of same style. The Oatmeal gives this one a fantastic creamy and smooth palatte coating mouthfeel, that is essential for the style and unfortunately often goes overlooked. Thankfully Founders knows what they are doing, they are ever impressive and sometimes make others look like amateurs.  With as balanced and rewarding as this beer is it would be so easy to reach for another. The lingering brown lacing of the glass once full just begs for another, and the still present coffee notes kissing the palette whisper out to continue.  Aside from Dieu Du Ciel, Founders has been the only brewery able to make a Coffee Stout i've been able to highly recommend.

1199,11757,Wd2048,3.83,"With the pour, there was not a lot of head. Probably to be expected with the alcohol content. Head was a dark tan.  Beer was black, typical of a stout. No seeing through this one.  I had a slight alcohol aroma. Other than that quite roasty, slight chocolate undertones, and almost earthy. This explained a lot when I first tasted it.  My first reaction to the taste was ""dirt"". I'm not sure how to explain that. The bitterness jumped out at the beginning and then gave way to an almost dark-chocolaty smoothness. That earthiness stayed with me through the entire beer. It was definitely a shock to my taste buds. It wasn't as sweet as most stouts are to me. It was a pleasant, lingering, surprise.  Overall mouthfeel was good. It coated the taste buds. This one will stick with you for a while.  While I liked this beer, it's not one that I would probably order up all night. At 8.3%ABV I couldn't hold up that long. Too, with this being one of the more bitter stouts that I've tried, it's not one that would be refreshing to me in large quantities.

S: Tobacco, wet coffee grounds, molasses, licorice, roasted malts, cocoa, and a hint of vanilla. The tobacco-coffee ground aroma is a little overly earthy for me.  T: Roasted malt is upfront, then it is balanced by a hint of bittering hops. Molasses, licorice, chocolate, vanilla, and the hint of coffee are also rather dominate flavors. Subtle complexities are overshadowed by the coffee flavor. As usual with coffee stouts, the coffee doesn't taste ""fresh brewed"".  M: Ever so syrupy yet has a tad of creaminess.

1199,11757,Ryan011235,4.27,"Poured into a snifter on 2/21/10  Pours a dark, inky brown & settles just shy of black. Dark brown highlights. A deliberately slow & aggressive pour yields one finger of hot chocolate-colored foam. Said foam thins quickly to a patch of bubbles covering 50% of the surface area. Modest retention. Decent lacing at first, but gets thin quickly.  Breakfast Stout has a potent aroma of roasted coffee & espresso beans which act as a supportive pillar for the rest of the malty sweetness which is manifest in the form of milk & dark chocolate as well as dark sugars. The nose is rounded out with notes of oatmeal.  While the aromas seem to have their own distinct place, the flavor of this beer is rather well-integrated. I suppose it's fair to say it's slightly biased toward dry, roasted coffee bitterness. However, that would imply the chocolate & roasted dark malts to be less than apparent, which simply isn't the case. In fact, with the exception of oatmeal smoothness, most everything comes across as very roasted - about as close as you get without calling it burnt. A few earthy hop notes meander about but I'm not sure of the bottle's age; I think they make have broken down some.  Full bodied & chewy with just a tad more than low carbonation. Subtle prickly carbonation hits accentuate the bitterness of the coffee. Once these subside it's mostly smooth & creamy. Lots, lots, lots of bitter, roasted residuals linger on the finish & take their merry time in leaving. Come to think of it, the residuals seem kind of burnt, which is fine by me.  For whatever reason, whilst pondering which beer I'd drink tonight, I imagined that Breakfast Stout would be far sweeter than it actually is. Though somewhat surprising, I found the tilt towards coffee quite befitting. In any case, I have few complaints. If anything, I could go for a bit more robustness in respect to the flavor profile (a minor point of contention). It's plenty easy to drink & at 8.3% abv it won't floor you.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T- Coffee upfront, then comes the bitter sweet chocolate, then back to a coffee finish, with a slight smokiness. I love the Sumatran coffee, it adds a nice earthiness.  M- Full body with a nice tiny amount of carbonation. Dry but not overly dry. Coats the tongue with rich flavors.  D- This is a sipper, with every sip leaving you wanting another.

This beer tastes pretty much like black coffee with some dark chocolate flavor. I didn't find it too overly bitter, and the high level of alcohol is hidden nicely.

Everybody else seems to have found the oatmeal in the flavor but I never located it. A high amount of bitterness at the finish, but not overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Somewhat thick and chewy, yet still a little oily and slick. A bit of a carbonation bite up front.  Drinkability: Great drinkability for a higher ABV beer.

The palate was not what I had expected, exactly. Clearly I knew that this was going to be a very full coffee-brewed, powerful beer. It didn't quite pack the complexity wollop I was hoping for.  Basically, the beer was good. I let it sit in the glass and it didn't change. It didn't evolve. I wasn't getting layers of flavor coming at me in waves.  I was getting a one-note coffee kick, yes. But there was something lacking. Coffee can be sweet, earthy, dark roasted, light roasted - it can taste a little herbal - I really wasn't getting any of these nuances from the beer.  The one-note I did get was very good, but it reminded me a lot of Manhattan Special. I think I'm missing something when it comes to this beer.  Mouthfeel was good and I found the beer very drinkable.

It smelled heavily of dark roasted black coffee. It was very dominating and I couldn't pick up much else.  The oatmeal in the beer was actually present in the taste which was nice. After the smooth chewy oatmeal taste the bitter black coffee and dark dark chocolate came in. There was a ton of roastiness. It seemed to strike a good balance between too bitter and not enough coffee. The roasted aftertaste seemed to linger a little too long for my liking. There was also a healthy amount of residual sugar in order to counteract the coffee bitterness.  There was a nice level of carbonation and a soft mouthfeel despite the roasted bitter coffee. It had a ok drinkability for a double stout.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

A bit of an alcohol kick in the end. Unbelievable.  M- Thick, with a perfect amount of carbonation. This beer is hearty enough that it could be breakfast in and of itself. And I don't mean a bowl of Cheerios in the morning. This is hearty like biscuits and gravy, an omelet, bacon, sausage, toast, a muffin, cornbread, quiche, orange juice, and a big glass of milk.

T - Strong roasted malt taste to start with coffee and mocha hints all over my mouth. Delicious. Some hints of oats as well. The roasted charter is strong and full but doesn't overwhelm the palate.

Looks like the creamy head from root beer out of a soda fountain. Stays around a few minutes, giving way to a small ring which leaves a sticky lacing all around the glass. Impressive lacing left down the glass as you drink.  S: Sweet malts. Touches of coffee and bitter chocolate. Smell doesn't seem to last very long.  T: A sweet front which gives way to a bit of alcohol as you swallow. Black coffee comes in at the very end and lingers until your next sip. As it warms, the coffee comes in sooner and more aggressively. Even to the point of hiding the alcohol bite i experienced in the first few sips. Much more noticeable coffee tones and much less alcohol bite than the Founder's imperial stout. I'm enjoying it even more as it comes to temperature.  M: A pretty hefty beer. Coats your mouth pretty well and leaves it sticky for the next sip...in an enjoyable way.  D: Much more friendly than the Founder's Imperial Stout. I'm not a stout fan in general...i could probably have another one of these but it wouldn't be my first choice in a beer to drink multiple of. A little heavy for me to comfortably have two.

I don't detect much chocolate, but that isn't disappointing. Some other things coming through, but it's in the world of these two flavors. A hint of toffee, some chemical smell that is related to the alcohol.  Several layers of coffee - espresso and several dark roasts. Chocolate is tame and slightly sweet. There's the same chemical flavor - something like the ""paintbos"" in pinotage wines. Hints of spice - allspice and cinnamon.  I actually wanted this to be more dense.

Leaves mocha whisps on the top of this beer. No real lacing to speak of but it coats the glass in a light brown liquid.  S- The coffee notes really make themselves more apparent with a little age on it. These come through quite brightly on the front end of the aroma. Roasted malts come through next with a bitter darker chocolate in the back end of this. It's not really all too complex but the nose has many layers to it coming one right after the other. Nothing really blends into another but each have their seperate stop and go motions.  T- Roasted malts make a light run for the front of this beer with darker chocolate undertones. After a little age on this one the coffee is the most in your face with flavor. It kind of takes over from the ending front all the way to the end. Even with all this coffee going on it is for the most part balanced with the darker chocolate coming through the rest of the beer in hints and mellows the coffee sting out a bit.  M- Heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation was a little on the light side. Nice creamy mouthfeel with this beer. I enjoyed the fresh roasted coffee taste it left on the palate. This combined with a nice duo of roasted malt and coffee brings the aftertaste something to look forward to. This beer coated everything it touched in it's roasted coffee image.  D- This beer was almost too easy to drink. I personally wanted to jump back into my cellar and bust out the rest of them. Luckly, I didn't and I think it will pay off in the end.

Flavor is bitter, tangy and coffee-like. I like how this beer isn't sweet or timid. Roasty. Some chocolate comes through, but this brew really focuses on coffee and does it well. Oats could be more present and contribute more to the mouthfeel, which is a bit lacking for a stout on the bigger end of the spectrum.  This is a great coffee stout, and I respect it, but I don't see it as a top-25 beer, which is how it's rated (#22) on ""Best of BA"" as of this review. I'm not even sure it's top-50.

Drinkability is amazing considering the ABV... could drink this all night!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T: Definitely some bitter chocolate and coffee, slightly oaky, but balanced with enough malt that it's very drinkable. Oh yeah, there's the alcohol burn I was waiting for. As it warms the flavors really stand out.  M: Thick but enough carbonation to make it very drinkable. Wow, it's perfect.  D: I really like coffee stouts, and this is one of the best. I could see drinking myself stupid with this one.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,hopsbreath,4.3,"The label shows a little kid in a bib eating a bowl of oatmeal. It also states it contains 60 IBU's and 8.3% alcohol by volume (ABV). Founders only offers this beer November through January and it is fairly difficult to find. This particular batch was bottled 11-6-2009 as evidenced by the born on date. After an aggressive pour, 3 fingers of espresso foam colored head formed which gradually receded to a thin top layer that never dissipated. The beer itself was jet black and completely opaque even to direct light. The lacing on this beer was wonderful. It built up at every level the beer was left after every gulp the whole way down the glass like growth rings on a tree. Fantastic aroma gave off the smell of stale coffee, grainy hops, and sweet roasted malts. Flavors ranged from bitter sweet chocolate, to strong brewed iced coffee, to the aggressive bitters of the 60 IBU's derived from the hops. Rather high for IBU's in a stout but it worked very well without a distinct floral hop essence. Extremely creamy and smooth texture is probably due to the oatmeal they used in the brewing process and gives the perfect not-to-thin not-to-thick mouth feel. For the ABV this is a scary easy to drink beer with a slightly sessionable feel to it. The only significant sign of the size of this beer is the slightly sticky feeling it leaves on your lips after a swig. This is the third founder's beer I have tried in just over a week and have to say this is a top notch brewery! The Breakfast Stout clearly stands out as an upper tier offering and I highly recommend it. Worth the search.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Jeffo,4.7,"Found this at The Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam.  From a bottle into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours a thick and tight looking one finger chocolate brown head with good retention. Black in color with no carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a thin wisp and a ring. A ring remains and leaves some good looking lacing down the sides. A fine looking Imperial Stout.  SMELL: Roasted malts and hints of dark chocolate, though the pure black coffee is more prominent. Notes of fudge and brownies as well. Bold enough and quite enticing.  TASTE: Roasted malts and a great balance between the pure bitter dark chocolate and black coffee; more balanced than the nose. Very roasted and burnt the whole way through, leading to a bitter chocolate and coffee finish. Bold and long lasting aftertaste is plenty roasted with lots of coffee and burnt cocoa flavors. One of the best out there.  PALATE: Full body with lower amounts of light carbonation. Very creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth with a little alcohol bite at the finish. The oatmeal has definitely given this a soft and creamy feel. Finish is slightly mouth-coating.  OVERALL: This stuff is what people write home to their mothers about. Fantastic stuff and well worth the hype. By far the best coffee flavored stout I've had so far, and the flavors mesh excellently with the chocolate and oatmeal. Very enjoyable, though the bold flavors do start to get a little overwhelming after a glass or two. Non-the-less, this one is a real treat of the brewing industry and I hope it continues to find its way overseas.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T: Loads of coffee and bitter cocoa, roasted malt slips in after the initial burst of coffee, Hop and chocolate bitterness really lingers on the tongue.  M: Nice full bodied stout, very smooth and creamy, understated carbination is spot on. Bitter coffee and chocolate and malt sweetness are nicely balanced.  D: A very good stout, you probably need to like coffee to really enjoy this beer.

1199,11757,teovaldi,4.9,"Pours a deep deep brown, probably the darkest beer I've ever seen, with a deep brown/tan head that doesn't last very long but while its there it looks amazing.  The nose on this one is roasted COFFEE, COFFEE, and MORE COFFEE as well as rich dark chocolate.  The taste is a total in your face coffee outburst with dark chocolate in there finishing off with a slight bitterness.  The mouthfeel on this sucker while on tap is so velvety smooth its like chocolate milk. Hardly any carbonation noticed in this monster.  This is one beer that improves as it warms up so if served very cold make sure to let this sucker warm up. The first one was so good I had to have another and pissed off my girlfriend in the process having to make her wait another 1/2 hour to finish my ""mini-beer"" as she called it (10 oz snifter, lol).",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,brewerburgundy,4.53,"12oz bottle, goblet, no freshness date to be found. Edit: ""Bottled 10/23/09"" found on the bottle neck.  Like Ten Fidy, like dirty obsidian. At first no head formed but I poured straight down and got a lovely cappuccino head of about an inch. Looks to leave good rings of lace. We have no highlights.  My morning coffee! Better than my morning coffee because a 70 to 80 percent cacao dark chocolate square has been melted into it. Some background spicy hop behind the supple espresso, dark chocolate nose. Dark malts.  This is a taste and olfactory climax for those who love stout, coffee, and chocolate. The mimicry of a cup of coffee or mocha by this beer is astounding. The beginning and end of the sip do this, while the middle gives you chocolate milkshake, oreo, dark roasted malt, rain wetted earth, hop bitterness and earthy white pepper. I can find nothing lacking. The finish is like that of black coffee with only the addition of hop bitterness.  Here I could nitpick but the mouth is great. Unlike the Schlafly Coffee Stout from last night, it hasn't been fermented out too far. Worthy.  There is not a trace of the moderate (for an imperial stout these days) alcohol content. As it warms things only seem to tighten up, to become more consolidated, a cohesive whole. I think I could finish the four-pack tonight but I must cherish this.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,pdoran10,4.82,"Happy to be reviewing this after enjoying many of these since drinking my first a few months ago.  Poured into a standard pint glass, nothing too different from other stouts here. I get a good amount of head and a standard dark brown black color. Still looks exciting. Smell is mainly of very good coffee. Taste follows the smell, and you get very tasty coffee right away. I get a perfect blend of a bit of hops, toasted malt and a hint of chocolate too. The most harmonious blend of tastes I've ever had in a stout. They blend perfectly. Mouthfeel is great. Not too thick or syrupy, but has substance. A solid dark beer. Drinkability is just right for an imperial stout. It's a big beer that I could drink all day.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,zoso493,4.92,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a straight-sided pint glass.  Appearance: Man, this is a dark beer. Pours a deep, deep coffee color that seems to absorb all the light around it. A very slight, one-finger, tan head emerges, which leaves little to no lacing on the glass.  Smell: Beautiful scent of coffee, chocolate and roasted malts. I couldn't do it justice with just a written description. Coffee is probably the prevailing scent, but it interplays so well with the dark chocolate and burnt malts. It also has another sweet quality to it, that might be toffee or some other sweet.  Taste: This is just a superb beer. I've never had a beer that showcased each of the flavors contained within it so separately. As you was it around in your mouth, you get hit by the coffee, then the cream, the dark chocolate and the long finish of roasted malt. In the end, the bittering malts prevail, but the sweet stuff has its say, as well. This is such a complex brew and the flavors are intertwined absolutely perfectly.  Mouthfeel: This one is on the thicker side of things with a reasonably amount of carbonation. It's not chewy by any means but the body is very adequate for the style.  Drinkability: There is absolutely no trace of alcohol in this beer. All you get from this is the wonderful flavoring. The huge flavor doesn't prevent this from being a drinkable beer, either. This is a really nice drinking beer.  Overall, this is an outstanding beer. For me, the two most important facets of a brew are the complexity and boldness of flavor - and how smoothly these are combined. With that criteria in mind, this is an almost flawless beer. There are so many different things going on in the smell and taste that each assert themselves boldly and clearly. When you couple that with a beer that also extremely smooth and drinkable, you have a really exceptional brew. This is a pleasure to drink and easily ranks among one of the better beers I've had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,goldbot,4.22,"12 oz. bottle. Bottled on 9/18/2009.  Pours black and opaque with thin brown head tht quickly dissipates to almost nothing. Slight lacing on the glass.  Smells somewhat sweet - mostly dark chocolate and some coffee. A bit if hop presence as well and the alcohol is barely detectable at the end.  There is a nice bitter hop presence up front, quickly backed by strong dark chocolate. The finish is smooth, with more chocolate and coffee. The alcohol is very slightly detectable at the end, and the beer leaves a somewhat bitter chocolate aftertaste.  Feel is creamy with a medium to full body and good carbonation. Overall great complexity in taste and aroma, but a touch too bitter and hoppy in my opinion.

Hoppier than the bottle, if I recall the bottle correctly.  On the palate it's more of the same, with the addition of a malted milkball note. Seems to be drier than the bottled version, but a bit softer all around. Flavors are well integrated, and just plain tasty.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S- Has a cocoa coffee smell to it with a hint of hops with a strong tinge of roasted malts, a little sweeter smelling than many stouts.  T- Not very strong, yet at the same time it is. The taste is pretty much a convergence of the smell with a nice roast chocolate coffee smoothness and bitterness with an aftertaste of those roasted malts right after it goes down.  M- Its a really smooth drinkable beer with a feeling reminiscent of a warm glass of coffee leaving the palate and it doesn't bite really hard so that one would have to force it down.  D- Just take my word for it, you could probably drink this beer all night if you wanted without a problem especially if you were in a stout mood.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Malts are balanced nicely with some faint hop smell. T: Hit with a lot of coffee and dark chocolate right off the bat. The malts are sweet, but it does give way to a bitterness due to the hops and dark chocolate. It is tasty. M: Medium carbonation and not quite as thick as I thought it would be. The bitter taste at the end doesn't hang around long. It's not a crisp finish, so the tastiness stays with you. Well done here.

Aroma is gourmet coffee beans, chocolate and dark roasted malts.  Flavor is very chocolaty, big time coffee, especially in the finish, along with a touch of acidity.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy thanks to the oats, a little thin compared to the competition, with low to medium carbonation.  A very, very nice coffee stout, gets a slight bump due to being the best bargain in the category. There are a few that are better, but cost twice as much or more.

1199,11757,DanOLeary,4.29,"Aroma: First up in the aroma is a gritty cold-press coffee nose with a background of sweet chocolate. Dark roasted malt presence is subtle, but helps to round out the predominately roasted coffee notes.  Appearance: Pours an opaque black with a rich almond brown head. A very well retained head with good lacing sticking to the edge of the glass.  Flavor: Burnt coffee and dark chocolate flavors hit your tongue immediately with a creamy sweet backdrop. This follows with a peppery presence as well through the middle that is almost burning. This spice backs up the coffee and chocolate sweetness well. Finish is of bitter dark chocolate and is probably the only area where an earthy hop bitterness is present.  Mouthfeel: Full body with low carbonation. While the beer has a drying and bitter quality,  the coffee and chocolate have such an intensity that the flavors attach themselves to your palate with an oily consistency.  Overall: A stouty-stout with rich body and a flavor profile that is very focused on coffee and deep 80% dark chocolate. The aroma isn't as rich as I expected from this beer and is surprisingly similar to Surly's Coffee Bender. I suspect they use the same process to add the coffee.

It's nice looking, but without better retention or lacing, it's short of exceptional.  The aroma and taste are phenomenal. Rich coffee notes with generous helpings of chocolate and cocoa - good malty sweetness. This is a truly delicious beer. Although I didn't pick up on it in the nose, there is an appearance of hops in the taste.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth and creamy. The carbonation is appropriate and takes a backseat. Alcohol is very well hidden - barely a hint of booziness. I generally rank stouts a bit lower on drinkability, but this thing is just so tasty and enjoyable.  Exceptional beer.

1199,11757,GilGarp,4.92,"Bottled 10/14/09.  Served cool in a chalice.  Breakfast stout has a very dark brown color with good clarity evident during the pour. The creamy fine head is short lived but some lace is left behind.  Aroma has a lot of roast to it - roasted malts, dark roasted coffee, even roasted nuts. There's some bitter chocolate in the nose as well but it's in the background. Hops are evident, moreso than in most versions of this style, but they still take a back seat to the dark malts and coffee.  Flavor is simply excellent. For someone who loves coffee, beer, and especially coffee stouts, this ranks up there with the best, which for me means espresso oak aged yeti. The coffee flavor is certainly not hidden in the beer. It comes on strong right from the start and lingers through the finish. There is a lot of great bitterness. It seems to be mostly from the malts but it's fairly hoppy too, for a stout. The chocolate is not as dominant considering it claims to be a double chocolate stout.  Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, full bodied, low carbonation. The flaked oats are certainly a factor here and really make the beer just that much better.  I knew this was going to be good but it's truly excellent.

Pours a moderately viscous black color with a creamy brown foam that is tight-bubbled and long lasting. Lacing is wonderful as well, stouts do not get much better looking than this.  Aroma is fairly coffee-centric but displays enough chocolate and Tootsie Roll maltiness to keep it from being one-dimensional. I like the fact that it is a very clean smelling stout, there is not much in the way of fruitiness or bready yeast to get in the way of the coffee and chocolatey goodness.  The coffee flavors are delicious and fresh...even though I do not normally drink the stuff, the flavor is very appealing. There is an oatmeal-esque smoothness and creaminess that works very well. Just enough sweetness to offset the bitter aspect of the roasty malts and hops. ABV is rediculously well hidden and the beer is dangerously drinkable.

The coffee, chocolate and oatmeal all come off at once. It's a wonderful mixture. As others have stated, the flavors come through much more as the beer warms to room temperature, so perhaps that is the best way to serve it.  M - Creamy and smooth without much booziness.

The smell is a really tight mix of coffee beans, sweet dark chocolate, roasted malts and subtle hop aromas.  The taste follows suit. It's somewhat sweet in the mouth with intense notes of coffee beans, freshly brewed coffee, sweet chocolate, bitter chocolate and roasted malts. It gets slightly tannic in the middle. Hints of hops. The finish is rather dry and has a nice coffee bitterness to it, and faiding notes of roasted malts and chocolate.  Smooth on palate with well balanced carbonation.

Rich dark brown head tops off this monster.  Smell: Dark roasted malts and coffee, but this beer has more of an intensely aromatic quality than simply a smell. The coffee gets in your nasal passage and lingers there.  Taste: All great stout flavors are here. Starts off with sweet oatmeal, gives way to dark chocolate, which then swirls with bitter coffee into a long aftertaste. All this is laid upon roasted, but I wouldn't call it burnt, malt.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly smooth and remarkably soft on the palette for such intense flavor. You won't find a more full-bodied stout.  Drinkability: Easy drinking, and leaves you wanting another, since the alcohol is so well hidden.  Notes: This has become one of my favorite stouts. It's great from the bottle but amazing on tap.

The aroma is predominantly of deep roast malt and coffee; there is some hop sourness and a slight bit of yeast.  The taste is a thick brew with the grassy sourness of the Sumatra coffee and Java coming through. It is exceptionally dry tasting with a bit of spice from the java and hops. The chocolate is definitely of the bitter variety; the chocolate malts add very little to no sweetness save for some very grainy sweetness in the finish. The lactose comes through very faintly like a strong espresso with the tiniest bit of cream added. There is a bit of residual floral taste presumably from the hops and yeast used. It is by far one of the most mult-faceted and complex tastes even through the heavy, dark coffee flavors.  Unlike most hops it is not a mellow, warming cushion like flavor but instead it is zingy and sharp. There is an alcohol taste  The mouthfeel is very a smooth oatsy texture plus a kind of slick thickness. The carbonation prevents it from becoming dull and flat.

Beautifully coats the mouth... and there's just enough soft carbonation present to pleasantly tickle the tongue.

It is, however, a very good beer and definitely worth having a four pack around for when you feel like something different from say a Belgium tripel.  It is a complex beer and I think I could imagine replacing Kahlua in a white russian with this beer and it would taste pretty good! It's very well balanced with chocolate, coffee, an oat sweetness, and alcohol.  In fact my only complaint about this beer is the thickness of it. It definitely seems like you are eating this viscous brew and I suspect the brewery acknowledges this based on the kid eating oatmeal on the label.

Dark tan head, fairly small and average retention. Minor amount of lacing. Aroma was good: coffee and mild semi-sweet chocolate.  Taste was great. Malty, slightly bitter cold coffee and semi-sweet chocolate served up in an incredibly smooth blend with a little bitterness at the end to finish it off.  Mouthfeel was rich and creamy and incredibly smooth (probably the oatmeal).  Drinkability is excellent. The 8.3% abv is hardly noticeable. It goes down smooth and rich.

1199,11757,jjboesen,5,"A perfect stout and the first beer I reveiwed at Churchkey DC (Reveiw Pending). It being savored at a ""world class"" beer bar, it was served at the correct temperture in a 10-ounce snifter. I cannot rate appearance at the intial pour since it occurred out of sight; however, upon being set before me, it boasted a pitch black hue that was as dark as night. The head was razor thin and the lacing permitted a modicum of clingage. It is your basic black beast that dares you on.  The nose is overwhelmed with an intense miasma of molasses and cocoa butter. Meanwhile, the palate is blanketed with a heavy dose of coffee bean warmth with a few dabs of dark chocolate sprinkled around like confetti. The mouthfeel is incredibly resinous, it being thick, chewy, doughy and in serious need of being accompanied by water.  Really ... this is your typical after dinner quaff, one demanding respect - but providing the discernable beer lover some blissful moments. Thanks to Churchkey for allowing me the pleasure of this one. And thanks to you Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

It pours a beautiful cocoa color with lacing throughout the drink. The smell on this is the best part. It has a great chocolate smell with the coffee underneath lingering in your nose.

Hints of sherry in the warming alcohol, with a low spice. Sweet malts and dry, bitter alcohol burn.  Breakfast Stout? One of the most interesting American Double Stouts on planet Earth. Absolutely delicious. I've tried this in the bottle previously and a special aged '08 the same night as this one. The fresher the better.

1199,11757,augustgarage,4.34,"Obtained in trade from monsterfat (thanks!). Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass.  Bistre liquid, approaching black with sienna highlights, topped by a thin layer of tan foam which recedes to a creamy collar with a island of slick skin in the center of the glass. Rapidly disintegrating lacing, though some remains glued to the thick oily legs.  Strong fresh black coffee galvanizes the senses upon first whiff. Earthy, nutty, with a hint of pepper - you can tell they used a high quality bean (though I can't discern what role Kona plays vs Sumatran). Light roast malt gently supports the coffee aromatics to remind you that this is still a beer.  Coffee-bomb palate entry offset by a bit of bittersweet chocolate and a hint of oats. Long dry finish with roast malt, cocoa, grain, and a touch of pepper.  Rich, smooth, not quite full-bodied mouthfeel with a lingering astringency that weds perfectly with the alcohol.  While not quite as lush as Péché Mortel, this is a subtle and rewarding take on the style. Very well crafted! Looking forward to trying Kentucky Breakfast Stout sometime as the bourbon barrel notes could potentially send this into the stratosphere assuming they don't overwhelm the underlying flavors.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Durge,4.15,"A solid black color with a modest tan head and full blanket of lacing. The aroma is a light, pleasant chocolate-coffee malt. My first impression upon a mouthful is a nice herbal hop and deep coffee malt. The hops don't hit you hard but it's a real nice blend with a fair alcohol note. It's fairly bitter while delivering malty sweetness and has a velvetty feel. The drinkability is probably marginal but boy it's tastey stuff.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,burnstar,4.55,Pours thick black with a medium sized brown head. Smell has notes of coffee and roasted malt but I think the dominant aroma is strong dark chocolate. Black coffee flavor up front with some roasted malt. Deep bitter chocolate flavors throughout blend nicely. Really nice. Some moderate bitterness throughout. Underneath there is a slight sweetness which provides some balance. Medium to full bodied but not as heavy as you might expect. Smooth. Pretty easily drinkable.

Big punch of coffee and roasted malt in the nose, I get a sense of hops but its out done by the roast and coffee. The taste repeats the smell and is big on black coffee and roasted malt. Bitterness is respectable and the hops are there. Its drinkable, which I must say, I really like. I love a huge 10% stout just as much as the next person but I really appreciate a stout with huge flavor and less alcohol because I always want a second.

A somewhat persistent coarse one finger head sits on top for a while, though it leaves a fair lacing.  S: WOAH. During the pour it almost bowled me over! HUGE burnt chocolate is predominant with a slightly sour hops and a certain earthiness. This is by far the most aromatic beer I have yet encountered.  T: WOAH. This beer is just bursting with flavor. I didn't know you could have this much flavor in a liquid! The flavors from each small sip stay with you for at least a minute, so it seems that one could drink it over the course of an hour. Now, concerning specific flavors... a biting edge of earthy hops hits you up front... this morphs, over the course of maybe 30 seconds, through a big, chewy malt body into a smoky charred cocoa aftertaste. General coffee flavor lurks around the whole time, and there is no alcohol to be found... impressive for a 8.3%.  M: Huge, creamy, and thick. What did you expect?  D: So big and so satisfying that one can sustain you for an entire evening. Does that mean it's not drinkable? No! I'm giving it a 5.  I can only imagine what this is like from the source...

1199,11757,mdawson,4.23,"12 oz bottle, allowed to warm up a bit from fridge temp before uncapping. This beer had been talked up a lot, so expectations were high! Poured in a snifter.  A - Pitch black with thin, fine-beaded tan had.  Sl - Nose is overpowering wet-processed dark roast Sumatra coffee supported by roast malt, chocolate, and ethanol.  Taste - One-dimensionally hop-bitter, boozy, and coffee-laden at first; as it warms in the glass, other flavors blossom. The coffee and hops recede and the chocolate comes forward with shades of bittersweet, baking chocolate, and cacao nibs. There's oatmeal in there but you can feel it more than you can taste that wholegrain cookie flavor. The finish gets much fatter and rounder with some balancing malt and a very warming, roasty aftertaste.  MF - Again, a bit thin at first but fattened up as the beer warmed. Chewy, viscous, dense, a tad astringent from the roast grain and coffee.  D - A very complex and very, very assertive stout. To be honest, I was unimpressed at first with the collision of unharmonized flavors I was witnessing, but it integrated, evolved, and improved drastically as it warmed in my hand -- lesson learned: don't serve this beer too cold. It seems like pairing this ale with food (a very rich dessert like chocolate mousse, cheesecake, or trifle) would enhance it even further.

1199,11757,SpdKilz,4.47,"A huge thanks to kzoobrew for this amazing extra. Cheers buddy!  Appearance - Pours a deep, opaque black color that show absolutely NO light when I hold it directly up against my lamp. About a finger of mocha colored foam that dissipates somewhat fast but is leaving big, bubbled lacing on the sides of my glass.  Smell - Instantaneously I get a rush of fresh coffee smell (other beers with coffee smells always seem to be like ""day old"" coffee...not this one!). Roasted malts, spicy chocolate, oatmeal, and a hint of hop bitterness on the end. This beer smells utterly delicious.  Taste - I had to take two sips to make sure I was drinking the right thing. A heavy presence of slightly bitter coffee up front which is followed by an excellent chocolate flavor which ends on a malty/sweet/milky flavor. I'm now going to force my fiancée to try a sip of this and see what she thinks. [two minutes later] Okay, not the best reaction but compared to her normally saying the craft beer I drink is the worst thing she has ever tasted, this reaction makes me think she actually somewhat enjoyed the sip she took :D  Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel (honestly not as thick as I would have thought) and decently carbonated. Very creamy and ends on a slight bitter-coffee note.  Drinkability - Definitely not a session beer but a great after dinner (or after breakfast?) beer. I'm about to go have a piece of chocolate peppermint bark (from William Sonoma...so good) and see how it matches up with this. I can honestly see why this beer is ranked where it is. A very good example of the style and I'm still amazed at how ""fresh"" the coffee taste/smell is in comparison to the other ""coffee"" beers I've tried in the past.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

You can tell this beer is going to be slightly bitter.  Tastes spicy. Has hints of dark chocolate (I'm talking about 90% real dark chocolate here) and some kind of spicy coffee.  I'm going to say this is medium bodied but on the thicker/heavier side. I really like the body of this beer.  This beer is excellent.

Strong scents of roasted coffee and malt conjure images of a cup of black coffee first thing in the morning. The flavor is that of roasted coffee beans but quickly changes into a dark chocolate bitterness with a faint bite of alcohol at the end.

Retention is relatively low and eventually goes to a thick ring around the outside the glass. Surprisingly good lacing all the way down the glass.  Aromas are dark roasted malts - bitter chocolate and coffee with the coffee taking center stage.  Flavors are creamy but bitter dark chocolate and espresso on a backbone of sweeter maltiness. As with the aromas, coffee is first and foremost here, almost leaving an expectation of coffee beans at the bottom of the glass. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy and a touch slick with very light carbonation. The finish is long with more bitter coffee lightening up to a cocoa linger.  Very good overall and highly enjoyable. Only on occasion did I get a hint of warmth from the higher gravity but overall it was well hidden with the heavier strong flavors in the brew.

I can't say enough about the big aroma of this beer. Very, very nice.  The flavor does not disappoint, a huge flavor, busting at the seams. I don't know what is most noticable the dark chocolate flavor or the coffee flavor. dark roasty malts start coming through as the beer warms. there is a slight hint of hops, but they are hardly noticable. the alcohol is completely hidden by all of the complex flavors fighting for dominance.

Not creamy dark chocolate, but rather the heavy cooking variety or specialty bar. Punchy combination of flavors that battle for harmony, but each is evident and raw in its own way.  Heavy mouthfeel, not so much from the body or carbonation, but from the weight of an onslaught of competing tastes. Beer improves upon warming.  Though less boozy and full than KBS, it's not nearly as pleasant a ride.

Superior malt/oatmeal sweetness in the foreground as well which helps balance out the coffee/hop bittering aroma. A hint of hot cocoa at the end as well.  T - Very much resembles the aroma but the ratio of espresso to chocolate flavors is much higher. It's a lot of coffee in the beginning and end but the chocolate flavors butt in the middle very nicely. Makes a great transition between the two and the pairing is wonderful. Even with 60 IBUs it's not present very much due to the overwhelming amount of malts used in this beer. Don't get a lot of the oatmeal sweetness but it is there in the beginning.  M/D - Pretty heavy body on this one but super smooth and velvet-like on the palate due to the very very low volumes of carbonation. Drinks as easy as can be but still a wonderful sipper...even if you're not drinking it for breakfast.

T- Same as the nose except with a roasty-oatmeal element as well. Very nicely balanced.  M- Medium to heavy bodied, very smooth and creamy.  D- This would be a great session stout! I'm so glad that even though Founders isnt available in MD yet, at least its made it to DC where I work. I'll be ready for the release next year!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BetterDarker,3.55,"A: Pours a dark black with a chocolate brown head that recedes to nice lacing. A great looking pour.  S: Smells of burnt coffee, cocoa, and dark roasted malt. Over all just a bad burn.  T: Very bitter, in a bad way. Can't tell if it's excessive hops, or burnt coffee or chocolate. This 'beer' is as balanced as a Tyson-McNeely fight, what a mess.  M: Very thin.  D: I was not impressed. Alcohol is hidden, but just way too much going on in here. I find it fitting that the label states ""malt beverage"" as I agree, this is not a beer. I have three left from the four pack, who wants 'em?  EDIT-  Okay, so two months later I decided to give this beer another crack. Glad I'm did, I'm still not crazy about the aroma, but the flavor is fantastic. I found FBS to be much easier on the palate and will definitely enjoy the remaining two from my four pack.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,cope0021,4.83,"Pours a rich, dark black with one inch of tan head that quickly subsided.  First smell was a combination of molasas and coffee.  First taste was of rich coffee and a great balance of bitterness and sweetness. Beer is thick and rich, but not super heavy. The more I drink the more I like. There is enough of everything, but not too much of anything. Perfectly balanced.  This is deffinitely a world class beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,mgbickel,4.43,"Poured into a snifter. Dark black body...light eating dark. Formed a two finger head that dissipated a little too fast. Some legs/lacing.  Chocolate, dark coffee, roasted malts and a hint of vanilla tackle the nose.  Black coffee hits your mouth first. This is followed by a wave of dark chocolate and caramel. Finished with a toasty bitterness that balances out the flavors nicely. This fades as the beer warms.  Medium mouth feel...creamy with little carbonation. Just what I expected/wanted from this beer.  Another quality beer from this brewer. Close to the perfect stout...robust and tasty. A great example and will keep these stocked for myself and to share.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BrewIndy,4.72,"Just found a 4 pack of this at Crown. It's been hidden away in the back but the guy let me buy it!  A: Dark black color with a nice tan head that dissipated.  S: Dark roast smell with some strong chocolate flavors. This one smells great. That yankee candle place should be making these candles!  T: Thick and tasty. That roast flavor hits you up front and then the chocolate that finishes with you is amazing. I slight hint of alcohol on the finish. This is really great! Almost wish I didn't let my wife have a bottle now. I'll be rationing my last two until this years batch comes out.  M: Thick creamy malty and bitter. All of which mix so well that this is one more reason this beer rocks!  D: I'd love to drink the whole four pack but this one seems best as a nice desert beer. *% or so ABV means you really only need drink the one anyway. This ones to good to drink a bunch of. Save them for later!  Ever review a beer and then realized you already did once. Well, here is my updated review: This is one of my favorite beers. I'm so happy to have it around in such large quantities this year! 5.0 in all categories!  A: Dark black with an awesome looking thick brown head. About a fingers worth that dispates to half a finger. Leaves great lacing down the glass.  S: Roasty, chocolaty, malty goodness! This beer makes my nose hairs dance! Perhaps that's not the most appealing sounding thing. Let's just say that that candle place my wife likes should make this into a candle. I'd love my house to smell like this!  T: Everything it smells like and so much more. Perfect balance of malts and bitterness. Chocolate comes through and goes so well with the bitterness.  M: Creamy creamy cream cream.... I wish I had better words to describe this but all I can say is it's amazing feeling to hold in your mouth.  D: Two or three of these on a cold night makes for a great evening in. I know before I said this was a desert beer but now that the cold weather has rolled in I'd say a four pack of this is not only totally appropriate but a good decision to boot ;)",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,sidetracked,4.3,"Pours dark black with a thin brown head. Light seems unable to pass through it.  Smells strongly of roasted coffee.  Tastes strongly of coffee as well with a slightly bitter quality reminiscent of unsweetened chocolate. There's a lot of flavor here for not being overly thick.

1199,11757,BuckeyeOne,4.6,"Oh man, this was as good an oatmeal stout as I've had. I'd read a number of reviews of this Founders offering before I found it in Minneapolis on a recent business trip. I picked up a 4-pack at Princeton Liquors and had a couple of these while watching a basketball game in my hotel room.  It didn't have the complex aroma that I've come to expect in a double stout, though. I was a little underwhelmed and thought I'd been snookered by the reviews. However, upon the first taste, I found this exceptionally good. It was smooth and chocolatey, with just a hint of alcohol and biscuity malt.  I had planned on having just one and carrying the rest of the plane with me, but it was so good that I wanted another. I let the second one warm up a bit and, inconceivably, it got better. The complexity I was expecting in the aroma I found in the taste as it warmed.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,JohnL9013,4.31,"A: When I poured this out, I literally said aloud, ""What ... the ... F***??"" This is black as night, and viscous like chocolate syrup. Almost no dead, almost no indication at all that it is, in fact, beer. What a presentation.  S: Oh what a nice stouty nose! Largely coffee and bittering hops. Not a huge smell, but a very good one.  T: When I tried the Southern Tier Java Stout, it gave me a terrible impression of coffee stouts because it was simply too sweet, overdone, and the coffee wasn't good. Founders gets it perfect, period. I love Sumatran coffee, so the coffee flavors are an absolutely delight. It's sweet, but doesn't cover up the flavors at all. The ""chocolate"" effect from the perfectly balanced coffee is very significant... and when I brew coffee myself, it tastes like chocolate when I get it right, so I have a high respect for the blending and homogeneity here. The taste isn't over the top, but it is definitely exceptional.  M: Low carbonation, silky smooth. Let this one roll around for a while and enjoy!  D: I'm really surprised by how drinkable this is. Like I mentioned, it's very full, but not totally over the top. Regardless, I would not drink more than one at once, but could if I was in the mood.  I didn't know why everyone was going ballistic over this stuff, but now I do. It's an exceptional brew that's well balanced and just has a ton of complexity. Pick up a small (or a bomber if they make it) at your local shop and enjoy.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,TheycallmeTim,4.3,"12 oz. bottle poured into a shaker pint.  A--Opaque pitch black body--looks like molasses. Pours out thickly, too--super viscous looking brew. Heavy. Head is tiny, maybe a finger tops, deep brown colored, and fades to skim quickly. Some spotty lacing.  S--Grown up chocolate milk. Dark chocolate followed by something silken and vinous you find in those $6 dollar bars you can buy in fancy NYC grocery stores. On top of that is a definite coffee bite.  T--Three distinct waves for me, none of them subtle. Wave one consists of a chocolate covered espresso coffee bean. Deep, dark, and bitter. A full opening flourish. Second wave is super smooth and mellows out the ride--behind all the huge coffee and chocolate flavors there lurks a very big oatmeal stout, and it's like waxing your butt and riding downhill on a mirror. Last wave is actually my favorite. First it's all bitter coffee grounds, like licking a basket filter, then rounds out to something very roasty, a big bitter melding of the coffee and the roasted malt. Satisfying finish.  M&D--Mouthfeel is perfect, and boosted considerably I would think from the oats. Silkier than Teddy Pendergast's pajamas. Absolute joy, especially as it warms. So massive, velvety--wow.  A sipper, and surprising--at first I hated it for its lack of subtlety. But in the course of my first bottle somewhere, maybe halfway through, it won me over. I couldn't turn my lips away from the glass. I'm more of a more with less kind of guy, but this beer is so distinctly huge that I can't refuse. Bummed I only got one bottle to sample, and that I drank that bottle /before/ dinner, rather than after.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Lunch,4.63,"Served from a 12oz. bottle, obtained via trade with jlindros (thanks man!), into my Bruery snifter (11/23/09) at cellar temperature.  A: Pours a thick and rich motor oil black with a 1.5 finger mocha colored head with decent retention. This is exactly what I want an Imperial Stout to look like.  S: An intense bouquet of rich roasted coffee, milk chocolate, bitter dark chocolate, roasted malt, and oats.  T: Layers of fresh roasted coffee and milk chocolate take center stage along with a wholesome oat character that certainly adds a breakfast characteristic. A bitter dark chocolate surrounds any of the layers leaving a slightly bitter finish. A true pleasure to drink and certainly deserving of the hype.  M: Full-bodied with low carbonation allow for a very rich and creamy feel with a touch of oiliness.  D: Exceptionally drinkable for any Imperial Stout lover as this beer keep creates such a splendid degree of complexity. The 8.3% is not detectable at all in the flavor or feel.  Overall this beer certainly lived up to hype and is certainly a heavyweight in the realm of Imperial Stouts. Thanks again Jared for this experience. My Highest Recommendation.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,hayesez,3.95,"Poured thick and dark into a standard goblet. A one-finger head formed and quickly dissipated leaving a small island of foam. A semi-sticky lace was left behind as I slowly drank this one down.  The smell is extremely heavy on the roasted coffee. Smells like grounds from an espresso. Some roasted malts and a hint of tobacco as well. I'm not getting much of the chocolate that is advertised on the label.  As usual, I let this warm up a bit before trying my first drink. A strong coffee taste upfront, followed by the chocolate that I missed when sticking my nose in there. As I get toward the middle of the cup, it seems to sweeten up a bit. But the taste of coffee bean is definitely where this beer makes it's money. A bit too much for my liking, but still a very good tasting beer.  Not quite as thick as I like my big stouts. The carbonation was low, so this was a fairly drinkable beer....as always, I recommend drinking it slowly to let some of the hidden flavors pop out.

S - Chocolate, oak, smoke, coffee, touches of leather and tobacco. This smells divine.  T - Dark bitter chocolate. Earthy qualities, probably from the oatmeal, and the dark roasted malt. Slight smoke characteristics. Little hints of leather and tobacco in the taste as well. Very dry bitter finish.  M - Not as thick as I would have thought, or liked. I usually like my stouts to be very thick and chewy, especially an imperial one. Feels full bodied, but not thick, very unusual. Moderate carbonation, that tickles the tongue. Finish is very dry and crisp.  D - Very very good stuff. Strong, robust and flavorful like a premium cup of coffee. Why didn't I have this for breakfast? Hmmm.

Chocolate, coffee and a slight hint of cream. Hints of a dryness.  Taste mimics the aroma. Chocolate and coffee! Bitter finish from the coffee. Sweet and bitter. Flavors meld together perfectly.  Mouthfeel is great for this amount of depth in flavor. Carbonation is spot on for flavor enhancement.  Drinkability is also good here. I could start and finish the night with this one. It may not be a good idea though with this amount of alcohol. I can't stop drinking this!  DELICIOUS!!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

I am definitely a fan of coffee brews, so this one does not disappoint me. Not overbearing scents, but not too faint. Good balance.  T: A little too hoppy for me. Aftertaste of chocolate and hints of coffee linger in the taste. Good, but not one of my faves.  M: Leaves a decent sticky taste in your mouth. Good Carbonation.  D: Goes down ok. Easy because of the flavors, but a little tough because of the hops and carbonation.

The huge aroma of milk chocolate, rich coffee, toasted and sweet malt waft from the glass. This is an enormous milk chocolate aroma, with big malt, yet a hint of earthy hops can be detected as it warms.  The flavor mirrors the aroma, absolutely delicious. Dark, sweet chocolate, rich coffee aftertaste, roasted malt, and oatmeal. The flavors are numerous yet consistent with every sip.  Rich, velvety mouthfeel, yet medium in body with a low to medium carbonation. This is smooth and creamy.  Whatever this beer is selling; I'm buying!

The first aroma is strong black coffee. As the beer warmed to room temperature, I got more of a chocolate smell but coffee was always the main aroma. The taste is expectedly black coffee, easily the most coffee-filled beer I have ever drank. You never get too much chocolate flavor, but you get bitterness from the chocolate which is nice. The oatmeal comes through in the mouthfeel, making the beer very thick and creamy.

1199,11757,Ineedabeerhere,4.52,"Did an 08 and 09 side by side recently, here are some notes I took.  They both pour black with small dark tan heads, subsiding to a film around the edge of the glass. Surprisingly, 08 had better head retention and lacing.  They both smell outstanding but are considerably different. 09 is pungent, freshly roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate. 08 is more integrated with the rest of the stout flavors, even allowing some fruity ale yeast flavors to come through.  The tastes are both wonderfully complex with chocolate and coffee playing nicely over the bed of roasted malts. the coffee is so strong in the 09, it borders on astringent. 08 is more in balance and not as much harshness from the coffee, but isn't that what you want in a breakfast stout?  Both are excellently creamy and silky smooth. Alcohol tastes are negligible and I will drink this for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Overall, this beer ages well, but for a coffee lover, I love the intensity of the fresh bottle and probably won't be aging this one too often.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Has a deep dark color to the beer, what little head there is has a redish/brown appearance.  A good sniff of this beer from a balloon goblet reveals a sweet and complex mixture of heavy chocolate and roasted coffee, the 8.5% alcohol is hidden very well, it smells rather appetizing.  A smooth/quasi-bubbly feel in mouth, the flavors are overpowering, rich, dark, sweet and complex. There is a strong chocolate taste that partners nice with the roasted coffee. Also, a hint of oatmeal and cinnamon. The alcohol is barely noticeable, there is a very appetizing coffee after taste that permeates. (Note: if you have ever had a javachip frap from starbucks, the smell and taste are analogous).  This is one of the best stouts, if not beers I have ever tried, worthy of my first review.

S: For some reason this beer has almost no smell at all, slight coffee smell  T: Not a whole lot of unique flavor to this one at fridge temp, but once it warms up it gets pretty tasty, a lot more coffee starts to show. Hides the 8.5% very well. Normal stout taste, coffee aftertaste. Again little to no carbonation  Summary: A little bit above average stout.. Very easy to drink but nothing spectacular (again might be due to the beer not being carbonated correctly.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The thick, chunky foam settles slowly and leaves thick, sticky lace.  S - Nutty caramel, toffee, and bittersweet chocolate. Notes of plum and coffee in the background.  T - Lots of caramel and toffee up front with thick, sweet oatmeal. Bittersweet chocolate in the middle with the medium caramel notes carrying on in the background. Finishes sweet and cola like with lots of woody, espresso like coffee notes and plenty of chocolate with a good dose of malt bitterness to balance. There is a hint of pine hop flavor in the aftertaste that is quickly covered over by chocolate and coffee with some light char notes.  M - Thick, silky body, moderate carbonation, and a somewhat sweet finish.  D - Breakfast stout is a really accurate description of this beer. The coffee essence is strong but not overwhelming and the chocolate oatmeal and thick malt might as well be a chocolate breakfast cereal, or better yet, oatmeal with a splash of Bailey's in it. The sweet characteristics border on overwhelming the palate, but there is definite malt bitterness to hold it off, and the hop presence in the finish (which is so subtle that it could easily be missed) is a nice contrast. Overall, this is a very nice beer, though it lacks a certain depth and vividness that prevents it from reaching the level of the very best Imperial stouts that I have had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T - bitter chocolate flashes first, then loads and loads of fresh black and strong coffee (how i like it). bitterness sticks around for a long time, joined by some more dark chocolate and bittering hops. oatmeal ads a nice underlying sweetness (and more toastiness).  M - very strong carbonation for the viscosity and higher ABV. i like to let it sit and warm, and also let the carbonation die a little to prevent distracting the impressive flavors.

Starts smoothly stout/chocolaty/coffee tasting then has a really harsh bite that doesn't really fit to me. Almost non-existent aftertaste.

If you're in the mood for a good heavy stout there isn't much better, but I couldn't drink it all the time.  Overall- As much as it was talked up, I was pretty disappointed as a stout lover.

1199,11757,mdcrouser,4.77,"My first Founders Breakfast Stout - really looking forward to it.  Strange, as this beer pours looking almost flat, but then once in the glass, it comes to life, finding its carbonation and head. Motor oil black - the opposite of breakfast milk. Even the head is dark, raising up a whole finger and then dying out, leaving a solid deep ring around the glass.  It smells like deep, dark, majestically incredible - obviously it's got coffee and plenty of it, but then heavy toffee and roasted everything. Really good - one of those smells you remember forever.  Coffee at the fore, and then a bit burnt on the tongue - but in a good way, like a toasted marshmallow - wow. It completely enfolds the tongue and stays with it for a long, long time.  For as huge as this beer is, it's not heavy in the mouth, until it's down the hatch, and then it explodes. It quickly turns a little thin - not a big detractor though.  Seriously a legacy beer - can't say enough about this one- if you enjoy a good hearty stout, buy it, enjoy it, cellar it.  Enjoying this eight months later - July 19, 2010 - the hottest day of the year so far with a heat index of 108. And all day I had a craving for this beer.

S- A nose full of dark chocolate and some espresso in there. Also there is a little bit of sweetness from the malt and a tad bit of licorice.

This leads to the espresso and some sweetness from the malt on the tail end.  M- A smooth drinker that is a little dry on the back end. The carbonation isn't very noticeable but that isn't a problem. I would have preferred this one to be a little thicker, for whatever reason it just seems a little too thin.  D- This one goes down pretty easy and fairly complex when you let it warm up a little bit. It has a dry finish and a little thinner than what I would have expected from a an Imp. stout. Good nonetheless and a must try. Another good stout from Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,DwnTwnBwn,4.2,"Thank you to abecall98 for the studying fuel.  A- Poured into a goblet, a soft pour revealed little head initially, after a few seconds a ring formed around the rim of the glass. Its a dark black liquid with a brown head that laces pretty good. Good looking otherwise.  S- The aroma is mainly coffee with hints of dark chocolate. As it starts to warm up there is a bit more oatmeal to the aroma.  T- First impression is lots of coffee. Then lots of mocha espresso taste. Through the middle the chocolate comes through more then the coffee. The aftertaste is predominately bitter chocolate, and seems to taper off too abruptly.  B- Its a full body beer with a good amount of carbonation. There is the definite oatmeal creaminess to this beer. Slight astringency/dryness to the end.  O- Very tasty beer there is a good complement between the coffee and the dark chocolate. Only complaint I would have is that there could be a touch more sweetness to this beer at least at the end where it falls pretty thin.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,auroracrisis,4.36,"Poured from a bottle into my Goose Island glass.  Poured pitch black with a very thin almost instantly dissipating head. Weird, I remember this one having a bit of a head but I guess I am wrong.  The smell is big coffee with chocolate smoothed out by oat and malts in the background. Absolutely intoxicating in the smell but also very pleasant. No booze in the smell either. Nice.  Taste is just as big. Roasted coffee and malts with chocolate. The coffee beans are the most forward in the flavor while the chocolate accompanies and compliments it. Malts are there but don't play a big role, and the oat just smooths everything out. Almost perfection in a coffee stout.  Mouthfeel is smooth. Nice and creamy with carbonation that just tickles the tip of your tongue. Not oily like a big RIS, and not on the thinner side like Abyss. Just right and it works great for the style. This is where this beer really shines.  As far as drinkability, I believe I could drink this all night but wouldn't allow myself since I could probably only throw back a four pack of these due to how heavy it is and the higher alcohol content.  Overall, this is an excellent beer. Definitely lives up to the hype that I heard about it before I could get my hands on some. Kind of disappointed in the lack of head in this bottle but I will revisit my review once I open my other bottles and probably change my score. A more aggressive pour might be needed on my part.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Thick and creamy with excellent retention; the head stays around forever. Very good lacing.  Smell: Smells of coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malts. Sweet and smoky as well.  Taste: The taste starts out with a very dark chocolate flavor, with coffee and smoky flavors. Roasted malts almost taste &#8220;burnt&#8221;, but in an appealing way. Molasses-like sweetness and some alcohol can be tasted, but not overally strong.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, but a little bit thin feeling for a stout. Still, incredibly smooth.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. Excellent appearance, smell, and flavor. Smooth and refreshing; very easy to drink. I plowed through my whole beer without realizing it, its so delicious and smooth.

Vaguely reminds me of a Dunkin Donuts Mocha Coolatta. I know it's sacrilegious to compare the two, but meh. Lots of coffee and roasted malt flavor.

Aroma of roasty malt and cocoa, faint notes of coffee bean.  Rich flavor of darkly roasted malt, charred bark, cocoa and espresso. Lots of other nuances like raisin, molasses, fig, bourbon, root beer, and licorice. Moderate bitterness complements. Coffee notes linger. ABV is well hidden.  Even mouthfeel, full with a thick feeling. Finishes slightly dry and tannic. Tasty beer, very drinkable.

1199,11757,abecall98,4.52,"A - pours a viscious dark black and a very small dissipating head. Looks great, just wish the head were bigger and lasted langer to keep the aroma alive.  S - Very coffee like. Smells like walking into the local coffee shop and having a fresh batch of espresso brewed right in your face.  T - This beeris amazing. Tastes start off high in coffee and espresso like flavors, then go into rich dark chocoalate, and finish with some dark malty goodness.  M - very lightly carbonated. A little soft, but creamy and goes down smoothly and pleasantly.  D - I love this beer, but after maybe 2 of these bad boys, I can't see myself wanting more. It is easy to drink, but the flavor can get over powering after too many.  This is one of my favorite brews. I wish Founder's was in California, so I don't have to keep paying high shipping prices for it. This is what all coffee stouts should aim for.

Hints of chocolate, with little malt or observable -OH.  A: Opaque brown to black body with a big loose head that gives way to noticeable ring lacing and a thin cover.  T: Again, coffee rules the day with a strong dose of bitter chocolate not far behind. The malt supports these tastes beautifully. 60 IBU's is masked by the intrinsic bitterness of both coffee and chocolate.  M: Medium body with medium carbonation. Smooth and creamy with a noticeable bitterness remaining on the tongue.  D: The beer sports an 8.3 abv. but goes down so smooth and easy you would never know. Great with a meal but stands alone beyond question.  O: Exceptional. I'll be giving this away at Christmas.

S - Coffee, coffee, coffee.  T- Coffee, chocolate, vanilla, the amount of hops is a nice surprise. Much more than most stouts.  M - Not as thick as I would like, hoping this changes with age. Still a nice chewy double.  D - I could drink a bunch of these, which is saying a lot for such a rich beer.

1199,11757,qchic,4.5,"As I was pouring this one, I thought it appeared the color of soy sauce, a black-brown that I can't get any light to pass through. The billowy head shows various shades of light brown and leaves nice lacing. Smells like good french roast coffee beans and bitter chocolate. Some tanginess from hops and smokiness. Tastes like it smells with some toffee, citrus, and dark fruits, especially as it warms a bit. Goes down way too easy, and I would have to make an effort not to drink too many of these if I had such a supply! Alcohol isn't detected at all, and the mouthfeel shows that oatmeal slickness.

A - Pitch black with seemingly no carbonation or head  S - Roasty, coffee, chocolate...awesome nose  T - First you're hit with a hint of sweetness and a little vanilla. This years is predominated by chocolate on the forefront, which I don't remember in last years. Delicious coffee bitterness mixes with subtle hop bitterness. The bitterness of 60 IBUs are cumulative paired with the bitter chocolate and coffee. Very well constructed this year. Super roastiness pairs well with the bitterness.  M - Very little carbonation and full in body with residual sweetness, bitterness, and body.  D - Extremely drinkable. Could definitely benefit from a little carbonation and some time to let the flavors meld, but both of those request might come in time.

1199,11757,mhoudeshell,4.46,Picked this one up at the Pace-Hi Carryout in Clintonville (Columbus). I have never seen a brew that stopped a nine-LED flashlight's beam completely. Not as thick as you'd think for a stout with this ABV. Lots of coffee taste but not overwhelming or bitter. Extra bonus points for the creepy spoon-waving urchin on the label.

1199,11757,abar22,4.35,"12 oz bottle in to a DFH Signature Glass.  Founders Breakfast Stout is completely black when held up to the light. A 2 finger caramel colored head that settle into a thin cap. Solid lacing circles the glass. The coffee/espresso scent that dominates this beer is the best of its kind. I usually prefer hints of chocolate or some hops in my Stouts but what's here is all that is required. It's not overly strong or roasted; just smooth, deep, and satisfying. I'm really torn on the taste. On the one hand I can't help but think there can be no better coffee dominated Imperial Stout than this. On the other hand I still prefer some of the chocolate notes I get from an RIS. While these may be listed as different styles they are just about impossible to separate. This is most definitely a breakfast stout, coffee through and through. If it were coffee it would be the best I've ever had. There's a little bitterness at the finish with a huge coffee bean aftertaste. As it warms I get a little more hop character coming through, standing up to the roasted malts. Solid smooth body, moderate carbonation but gets a bit thin in the finish. The ridiculously dominate coffee flavors hold the drinkability down on this one. While one 12 oz is easy enough to finish off I don't see moving on to a second one. This beer really does taste like breakfast time and is one hell of a beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,sisuspeed,4.5,"The first thing I noticed after cracking open a bottle of this stout was the huge coffee aroma emanating from the bottle. Wow, lots of roasted coffee beans coated in bittersweet dark chocolate. Smells delicious.  The appearance is that of a thick dark coffee with a thin brown head on top. Even though the head is thin, lots of lacing sticks to the sides of the glass and gives this stout an elegant appearance.  The flavor is exactly what you're expecting, except that its so smooth as well. Robust coffee flavor, rich bittersweet chocolates and a pinch of earthy hops mix to give you one hell of an incredible stout.  The mouthfeel is very smooth. This is where the oatmeal really comes in, giving the body some oomph and smoothing everything out. Carbonation is about perfect. Drinkability is also quite good. Some of the more bitter, dark malts help cut out any sweetness that might try to get out of hand, making this a very sessionable beer.  Overall, I highly recommend this beer, pretty much like the rest of Beer Advocate.

Smells a lot and basically like a chocolate-covered espresso bean mocha milkshake... which is awesome.  Tastes thick and bitter, like Italian coffee, with serious roast and nib action on the tongue. Texture is a little rough and chewy with a nice up-front carbonation that flares up and dies. The flavors are so intense that I'd be tempted to let it sit a year and try it then, but as it is I would enjoy sipping one instead of the more traditional breakfast brew. It's some serious flavor, though, and I couldn't take more than a bottle.  Overall a formidable offering.

1199,11757,nomomentwasted,4.53,"Had a bottle of this the other night and knew immediately that I was going to be sad that I couldn't have this on a regular basis.  Appearance: About what you'd expect from a stout. Dark brown-black pour with some tan-white crowning head. Laced pretty well, but nothing that blew me away either.  Smell: Rich chocolate notes come through with some toastiness as well, with the acidity of the coffee comes through more clearly as it warms up. Inviting, for sure.  Taste: Here is where it impressed me the most. Wow. Just a brilliant blend in just the right amounts of chocolate (both milk and dark), coffee, slight vanilla, and stouty darkness. Bitterness adds a little something extra, but this bottle has over a year on it and the hop present is just a little prickle on the front end. Totally, totally fantastic.  Mouthfeel: While creamy and nice, it felt just a little thinner than I would've hoped for. Still, finishes so, so smooth.  Drinkability: Up there with some of the best stouts.

Appeared pitch black coffee with a tan head that was small, but soon found the edges of the glass and hung out for a bit.  Tasted extremely strong of coffee, roasted malts, chocolate, toffee, burnt aftertaste. Very smooth, possibly smoother than Guiness, could it be? Bitter, almost acrid bite from the coffee, but smooth even after taking this into consideration. Chocolate really comes out with time and tastes stronger as it warms.

S: Forward coffee and chocolate notes. Very roasty, malty, and aromas laced with cocoa. T: Stonger malt and still very coffee rich. Chocolate flavor is well balanced with the other flavors. M: Complexity covers my mouth, as each drink hits takes you across the spectrum of flavors and aromas found in this treat. Not as viscous as KBS, but better IMO. D: Great beer!

1199,11757,woosterbill,4.78,"12 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: A thick, smooth stream of blackness issues forth as a pour from on high produces a towering 3-inch head of rich, dense brown foam that sticks around forever and leaves tons of sticky, tawny lace. This beer is as dark a a black steer's tuckus on a moonless prairie night, and is simply a perfect expression of an imperial stout. As solid a 5 as I'll ever give for appearance. I can't wait to dive into this beer.  S: Huge wave of black coffee up front, which eventually mellows into a rounder expression of roasted malt: a hint of chocolate joins the party, as well as the slightest suggestion of plum. A solid hop bitterness is also present, and blends beautifully with the coffee foreground. Great, but the coffee is just a little too dominant to garner a perfect score.  T: Wow. Just wow. This is beer heaven. The coffee from the nose is still dominant, but it's much, much smoother and just as beautifully satisfying as I could ever have imagined. More dark fruit than was apparent in the aroma, as well as some chocolate make this a fantastically mellow and balanced experience for a beer of this style. So good.  M: Closer to medium-bodied than I would have expected, with solid carbonation. Not as rich as I might expect for the style, but certainly pleasant.  D: Simply incredible for both the style and strength, I could drink this all night (or all morning, for that matter). So smooth, so rich, so balanced, I can't get enough.  Notes: Hands-down the best imperial stout I've ever had (although I have to admit I've yet to experience any of the really big names - Kate, Darkness, Abyss, Dark Lord, etc). It clearly edges out my prior favorite Old Raspy (although that beer's greater availability and lower price will always give it a place in my fridge), and it greatly whets my appetite for KBS and CBS, as well as impy stouts in general. Awesome stuff.  Cheers!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Some chocolate but it's dark and very creamy smelling. Taste is just mellow as it can be. Wonderful cherry and dark black bitterness with a sweet maltyness combines all at once. What is left is a bitter blackness that sticks around for a long time. Mouthfeel is very clean at first then a sticky bitter-sweet takes over till the end. Drinkability is just perfect here.

The bitterness still carries some sweet flavors with it thanks to the oatmeal and chocolate. This beer does taste more alcoholic as it warms to room temperature, but still retains that bittersweet deliciousness.

This stout has a wonderful, rich, roasty aroma. Strong notes of coffee beans are dominant, with subordinate notes of chocolate and hints of dark fruit. Swirling the beer enhances the dark fruit aromas.  There's a strong, roasty character present from start to finish in this beer. Upfront it serves as a counterpoint to chocolate sweetness, in the center it mellows allowing the chocolate flavors to blend with notes of dark fruit for a sweet kick, and in the finish the coffee used in this stout emerges and melds with the roasted flavors giving a lingering bitterness. This stout is full-bodied, moderately carbonated, and smooth and creamy.  I thought that this was a good, strong stout.

Not much retention but good lacing left from the remaining wisps of foam. The body is deep black, not any color even on the edges.  S- Strong nose! Big on coffee grounds. The coffee is like a punch in the face. Behind that trails some powdery notes of cocoa. The aroma is also quite leathery.  T- World class. Im really glad I can buy this locally. Like the nose the taste is big on coffee. There is a good deal of bitterness to this stout. Charcoal, bitter sweet chocolate and cola. The cola really comes out on the finish.  M- Medium carbonation.

S: Wet coffee grounds and bitter, semi-sweet dark chocolate are the prevailing aromas. Flat cola is the runner up and a great segue to the sweet maltiness that is around the corner.  T: When you order an imperial stout, this is what you want. I was not offended by the bitter finish at all. The finest example I have ever tried with plenty of character to spare.  M: Excellent. Thick and velvety smooth. Very balanced with great carbonation although mine was probably served colder than recommended.  D: Worth taking your time with, particularly so if served below 50 degrees.

Smells very strongly of coffee, it finally dawns on me that breakfast stout makes total sense. The Coffee is strong, but i do also set hints of chocolate, as if i'm about to drink a mocha beer-ccino. The taste is overpoweringly coffee, the chocolate that i smelled is now also fairly prevelant. The beer is also very heavy, to the point that after I had drank half of it, i no longer wanted to eat.

1199,11757,Minkybut,4,"I poured this exceptional beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a rich black color with a very nice thick tan head. It really looked good. The smell was heavy coffee dark roasted. The taste was the same, heavy dark roasted coffee with a smooth oatmeal cookie finish.

1199,11757,OldSchoolGamer,4.23,"I absolutely love Coffee Stouts, and this is one fine example of the style. I have yet to be disappointed with a Founders beer, and this one might be one of their best.  A: Pours a thick, pitch black color. No light penetration whatsoever. Head sticks around, but lacing is pretty minimal.  S/T: The aroma is full of rich coffee. Smells like a nice fresh pot of coffee. Very inviting aroma. The taste is even better than the aroma. I get a lot of fresh roasted coffee upfront. That leads way to a nice rich chocolate flavor in the finish. A great mix of coffee, chocolate and roast, with the coffee being the dominant flavor. Not the best Coffee Stout I have had, but easily in the top 5. Excellent.  M/D: Mouthfeel is very creamy and pretty full bodied. Not super thick, but still nice. I wish the finish lingered on a little more than it does. Drinks very well. Nothing harsh or offputting about this beer at all. Would be an excellent substitute for coffee in the morning. This will be a staple in the fridge all winter long.  Fantastic beer. Maybe a tad overrated, but still one excellent beer. I personally prefer Mikkeller Beer Geek, Brunch Weasel, Southern Tier Jah-Va, and Peche Mortel, but this one rounds out my top five Coffee Stouts.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Telix,4.55,"Poured from the bottle into a DFH Chalice.  A: A deep, deep, totally opaque dark chocolate brown with a nice brown head. There is seriously zero light transmission through this beer. The head doesn't stay around, but that's just fine with me.  S: Sweet roasted malts, ground coffee, ripe banana. Nice, fairly mild, inviting.  T: An awesomely complex brew - it hits the palate with a light creaminess and then opens up beautifully. A light, dryly sweet chocolate flavor is balanced by wonderfully integrated hop bitterness. As soon as the bitterness hits you, a fruity, honey sweetness coats your mouth to counteract the hops. The finish is long, with the hop bitterness re-entering the picture as a tingle on your tongue, but the sweetness still lingers. It fades perfectly with great balance even at that point...  M: Creamy, light, but thick enough to be satisfying. Mouth-coating without being gooey.

1199,11757,bmoney,4.25,"I believe this is last years release. Poured from bottle into pint glass.  A- dark dark brown almost black. Thin film of head that does leave scattered lacing.  S- Smell of espresso grounds and bitter dark chocolate.  T- dark (black) coffee, bitter sweet chocolate. Something syrupy in there. As it warms a little bit of hop and alcohol appears.

1199,11757,mbudner,4.55,"'09 release poured into a pint glass  A- Deep black with a very small/thin a dark tan/brown head. When glass is tipped, it is much more transparent and thinner than I expected.  S- Initially, aroma is heavily dominated by coffee with chocolate undertones. As it warms, I'm getting what I assume to be ""flaked oats"" due to the closest aroma I can compare this to is a contained of raw Quaker Oatmeal. When I really get my nose down in there, I pick up a bit of the heat, but this is the only evidence of alcohol that really comes through from start to finish and I have to try to find it. After it warms up even more, I'm getting ""wet dog"" scent out of nowhere (no I don't own a dog,) but at this point I'm loving it too much to let that get to me.  T- Burnt coffee with chocolate followed by a nuttiness that I can't really pin down to a specific nut. The flavors become more apparent as it warms, as one would expect, but this is a beer I enjoy from start to finish (even if I am impatient and start sipping when it is too cold and wait too long and finish when it is warmed than I would prefer.)  M- Starts off with a nice creaminess from the oatmeal with a nice zip of carbonation on the tip of he tongue and the back of the palate that I don't often experience with some of the thicker stouts. Finishes on the dry side when compared with other oatmeal stouts.  D- I can't say that I would want to drink more than one or two in a sitting, but I would love to have one every morning for the rest of the fall/winter. A true breakfast of champions.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,longdivision,4.15,"A - Poured a tan, caramel head that quickly dissipated. Espresso colored. No light gets in or out.  S - Smells like strong coffee grounds. I used to work in a coffeeshop, and this smells exactly like the leftover espresso grinds from the end of the night.  T - Robust, roasty coffee. Nicely sweet. Some lingering hop bitterness at the end.  M - Creamy, light carbonation, with a bite at the end.  Overall, I enjoy and recommend this, if you like coffee of course.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,aaronh,3.85,"Virtually black body is tinged with ruby highlights. The tan head fades to an island of foam. No lacing to speak of. Aroma is heavy on the roasted coffee notes with a hint of hops. The flavor follows - very strong on the coffee flavors - almost tastes like a shot of espresso in a decent stout. Some hints of dark chocolate start to poke through and a hint of sweetness eventually appears after several sips. Almost half the beer is gone before i really discern any hop flavors. Mouthfeel is decent, but perhaps a bit thin for the size of the beer. Drinkability is also good. After having this side-by-side with Goose Island Night Stalker and Bourbon County, this beer comes in third in my book. A good beer I will buy again, but not as great as some of the others.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Clydesdale,4.82,"A: This is an absolute midnight black color. Bright light does not shine through even on the edges. The moderately tall head is dark brown, frothy, dense, and creamy. Retention is nice, with some very attractive lacing.  S: Huge aromas of fresh coffee beans - I've had coffee that smelled less like coffee than this beer. Strong notes of dark chocolate and cocoa powder are also present. Dark roasted malts and some hints of nuts and lactic sweetness.  T: Dark, roasted, slightly blackened malt flavor up front. A huge rush of fresh coffee beans covered in dark chocolate. Some hints of cocoa powder as well. Overall, the flavor is of straight-up chocolate covered coffee beans. A mild underlying fruitiness recalling sweetened cherries. Some lactic sweetness and oatmeal flavor is also present. Hop bitterness is quite firm, with herbal/leafy flavors. Alcohol is well-hidden behind the extremely robust flavor profile.  M: Thick, chewy, strong. A long, finishing aftertaste of coffee and dark chocolate bitterness. Carbonation is mild and somewhat creamy. A roasted dryness is quite prevalent.  D: Well, this one certainly lived up to the hype. A huge, bombastic beer. Coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts - delicious. People probably lose sight of this beer as an oatmeal stout, a fact that only adds depth and character to a beer already full of it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smell- Upfront and amazing coffee aroma, a quarter of the way through I was able to dectect the hops, and again a above average.  Taste- This is the best ""breakfast"" stout I've had. Coffee is the dominate falvor you get, follow by chocolate, and the oats. You will get a slight hop profile at the finish, my guess is cascade.  Mouthfeel- This is a think and heavy beer, with the warming of alch at the end. Drinkability might suffer from the 8.3% abv but I've had other beers that have less where you can taste that more.

1199,11757,ShogoKawada,4.82,"Suprised to stumble across this one at the store. $12 a 4pk.  A- An aggressive pour into my snifter leaves a foamy, frothy head on top of an obsidian base of beer. Very nice pour, great head retention, lacing from the start. Head settles to a film a few minutes after pouring.  S- Deep, rich, bitter baking chocolate and a strong black coffee presence. Well, it is a ""double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout"", so that makes sense. Smells are intense... whoo!  T- Incredibly good. More chocolatey than I would have expected from the nose. Unlike Rouge's chocolate stout, which was more milky, this one is bitter, and I think I'm in love. The roasted coffee adds to this and what we have here is an incredible beer. Malts are incredibly smooth, perhaps the oatmeal? rounding out the bitterness from the coffee. At 60IBUs, I assume there's some serious hoppage going on, but don't really notice it. Incredible balance.  M- Fantastic. Thick, but not too heavy, glides across the tongue. Enough carbonation to keep things rolling at a leisurely pace. Wow. For all it's got going on, though, it is still a beer first. I just had a Peche Mortel and found it to be almost too much like coffee. This beer hits the bullseye. No sign of the ABV.  D- High. I've never had a beer so rich and powerful that went down so easily. I want more, and I will be getting more. @$4 a 12oz, not an everyday sipper, but I want to get 3-4 4pks and squirrel them away.

1199,11757,Knecht,4.6,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip pint glass. Pours a creamy single-finger head that retains nicely on a black-as-midnight ale. The aroma smells overwhelmingly of a dark coffee roast and thick malty goodness. I'm salivating already.  The taste does not disappoint. The flavor is dominated by coffee, but has rich undertones of malt, milk chocolate and oatmeal. The body is as heavy as it's appearance, chewy, and has just the right amount of carbonation. This is about as perfect as it gets.  I'm blown away by this beer; it is excessively rich and yet beautifully balanced. Now I wonder... could I replace my daily morning coffee with a glass of this instead?",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,jlindros,4.45,"Now THIS is a beer, a man's beer. It's what you grab in the morning that will get you through the day. It's the Wheaties for beer drinkers, already mixed with your coffee. That aside, is it just me, or does the weird lookin kid on the label give anyone else the creeps? He looks like a 45 year old baby spooning crack into his mouth... anyways, here's my review, hope you enjoy it.  Note, just popping the cap unlocked this huge aroma of coffee and chocolate making me salivate like one of Pavlov's dogs.  A: Pours with a luscious rich chocolate covered head that fades pretty quickly. Its super dark colored that barely lets any light through, and the few photons making it through have been so distorted they're forever stained with darkness and probably traveled through time somehow. It doesn't pour super thick, but is much thicker than most beers.  N: OOooohhh yeahhhh!!! It's like super coffee espresso mating with chocolate and popping out babies of light alcohol. The roasted malt on the nose is so rich I can feel it charring my nasal cavity. A huge dark chalky chocolate aroma dances as it mingles with the roasted malts and coffee. A light alcohol finds its way through the crazy malts, coffee, and chocolate, to tingle your nose a bit. I think I detect a slight oat as well, feeding back into that breakfast theme. If only I could pour buttloads of chocolate, coffee, alcohol, and essence of pour roastedness into my oatmeal in the morning.  T: A heavy stouty flavors starts the taste, but it quickly changes to roasted malts. Those things dominate the taste big time. Some bitter dark chocolate and earthy charred taste start to come through as well followed by some alcohol. Then some more oats, yes it is for breakfast. A slight sweet chocolate milk runs down the back of your mouth and is mostly masked by the crazy strong flavors up front. I get some coffee on the taste, but nothing like what I expected from the plethora that poured out on the nose.  M: Pretty thick, but still slightly watery, enough so that you can actually drink it instead of having to chew it. The alcohol tingles the mouth all over. Pretty light on the carbonation.  F: Finishes semi dry surprisingly, but still has some sweet undertones. The earthy charred roasted chocolate stout bitterness flavor &lt;taking a breath&gt; really stick around for a bit as the liquid coats the mouth. I can almost taste the black flavor and darkness that come from it. It's like the flavor of ""black"". I also get a slight oat taste long after its over.  Final thoughts: A very big heavy stout. Pretty thick on taste and mouth, but not so much you can't drink it. It has a nice alcohol taste, but not overbearing. Toooons of roasted malts, chocolate malts, dark roasted tasty goodness, oats, hay... wait not that, and the essence of pure darkness. A great drinking beer, and it gets much better with age as I have experienced before. I'll probably save most of the case I got, but drink one from time to time to help me through the cold winter coming.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

D - This beer is a bit on the heavier side and definately has tons of potent flavors. I cant see myself downing too many of these but a great experience nonetheless.

1199,11757,AndyAvalanche,4.62,"Had this about 3 weeks ago at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth but decided not to review it then, I had been waiting a long time to try it, I was a few beers in so I finally found it at Atlas Liquors in Quincy and decided to pick up a 4 pack. I'm liking it, I may have to pick up another 4 pack pretty soon.  Poured it into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass (after much debate as I do with many stouts). I've never seen a beer with this look before, incredibly impressive. It pours out completely jet black with a small dark brown head that is really more like a ring around the edges. When held up to the light there is still nothing but black the whole way around, it doesn't even get lighter on the edges, very impressive. There really isn't much lacing to it. The lace slides down the side back to the liquid, there are a couple of small patches that stay on the glass, but you can count them all on one hand. The smell is so complex but amazing. You can smell dark bittersweet chocolate, espresso and coffee. It's all pretty potent and even after all that you can smell hops. Yes, this is a well hopped brew which I found pretty intriguing. ***I had to let this beer warm up a bit, when it was cold it really compromises the taste and smell, I'd recommend only leaving it in the fridge for about a half and hour than drinking it, or maybe don't even put it in the fridge at all. When drinking it too cold it taste and smells a little more like a cheap coffee ingredient which I don't believe is the case.*** The taste was just as complex as the smell. You can taste the oatmeal, both bitter and sweet chocolate as well as espresso and coffee. All that is followed by some what tastes like dry hops which again goes after the bitter taste buds on the tongue. There also tastes like there area roasted and burned malts. The balance among all the flavors and tastes is quite incredible. The mouthfeel is obviously very full bodied, it's such a thick beer it's like drinking a thick hot chocolate when it's not so hot.

Smells of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and citrus hops, in that order. As it warms the roasted malt aromas fade a bit, giving the impression that the coffee and dark chocolate aromas strengthen.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Strong coffee and roasted malt flavors up front are joined by large amounts of smooth dark chocolate midway through the sip. Near the end of the sip very light amounts of citrus enter into things before a solidly bitter ending.  Mouthfeel is great. A very viscous thickness with soft carbonation.

Coffee and dark chocolate. Mocha beer! I could go on for days describing the fine nuances of the flavor of this beer. Coffee, of course. Dark roasted malt. Dark chocolate.

1199,11757,Daniellobo,2.69,"A decent, if overrated, burnt coffee stout.  Presentation: 12 oz bottle. Old fashion design around the illustration of a boy eating from a bowl, mixed with the Founders branding. Five word description: double chocolate oatmeal stout. Does not show date of bottling, but displays IBUs (60), and Alc. (8.3%) Poured into a snifter.  A - Almost opaque pour leaving a thick black color with a nice creamy head that shows good retention and leaves fine lacing.  S - Burnt coffee aromas (Espresso gone wrong, like a morning coffee maker that has been too long on the fire). Roasted malt that escapes-adds to the burnt coffee feeling, faint chocolate under the dryness of some oats. Strong and characteristic but not particularly pleasing.  T - A tone richer than the smell, the maltiness is capable of holding part of the burnt coffee closer to calling some part of the flavors ""roasted"" instead, but without much success. Luckily the malts don't hinder the coffee blend entirely and in fact may rescue some of that spoiled coffee taste with a distinct richness that lingers on an acidic note. Chocolate is buried under the exploded coffee wall but there is a faint semi-sweet note that embraces whatever is left struggling of that ingredient.  M - Full bodied, with smooth carbonation.  D - Hmmm, it can be drunk, but I'm feeling more and more disappointed as I progress through the beer. Unless you are passionate about the way the flavor unfolds, and also like the smell that takes a persistent front seat this is not going to be too easy to be had.  Notes: This is probably not my thing. I fear that this and others might be to some notion of style due to a discrepancy in the appreciation of coffee. This is critically burnt coffee and some aspects of the stout do rescue it, and emphatically it is not the other way around i.e. this is not coffee enhancing the brew. Now, there are brews out there doing it much better than this one (without being mind blowing Southern Tier's Jahva does it nicely, or the even their Mokah when it comes to pushing chocolate and coffee.) I have had my share of bad coffee, and this brings too many memories of it after a lifetime of enjoying straight up espresso. Then I also think that, all things considered, this is a decent brew (I do think that Founders work is typically top notch) but it suffers from over hype. Chocolate is subdued, coffee comes as burnt, and a good stout malty base does wonders in trying to rescue the attempt, unfortunately that might be the actual highlight.  As an update, I had another bottle at much colder temperature and while most of the general characteristics remain the same the burnt character that was so present the first time is not that unbearable in the second try, it has better drinkability but does not earn much in terms of memorability...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,jeffthecheff,4.82,"Founders Breakfast Stout is probably one of my favorite beers, so I decided it would be a good pick for my 100th review. Bottled 9/11/09  Poured into a shaped pint, this beer is black as a stout should be, with a dark tan head and lacing. It takes a while, but the head later becomes just a rim around the glass.  Being a ""double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout"", this beer has a lot going on. The nose has a complex mix of ale fruitiness behind a load of ""dark"" character. The first thing is the gooey, chocolaty character in the nose. Black, strong coffee shares equal strength in this beer, combining to make a coffee chocolate syrupy dessert mix. Very decadent. In this fresh of a bottle I'm also picking up some hops in the form of orange peel. I bet this would pair well with one of those chocolate orange candies.  The flavor of this beer is equally impressive, changing with the temperature. When cold, the black coffee bitterness comes through the most. And with 60 IBU's of hops, it feels like a pretty bitter stout. As it warms, the chocolate comes through, tasting like a bitter chocolate lava cake. The finish is all coffee and its bitterness. What really surprises me is that there is no heat from the alcohol, in spite of the 8.3% abv.  The mouthfeel of this beer just puts it over the top, if it wasn't already there. I've always loved oatmeal stouts, but this is the first I've had or know of that uses oatmeal is a big stout. The signature creamy mouthfeel from oats is successfully achieved, creating that gooey chocolate experience you would get from a fine chocolate dessert rather than some Herhsey's syrup. The finish is long lasting and bitter, with a medium thick coating lasting on the tongue.  Drinkability is outstanding on this beer. This doesn't have to be your typical sipper Imperial Stout. I can drink it out of a pint instead of stemware, and it's perfect on a cold morning tailgating a football game. This is also a unique Imperial Stout in that it tastes good cold and cool.  Notes from a 2008 bottle, aged one year: After a year in the bottle, the aroma is a lot more fruity. It has lost almost all of the coffee in the nose, softening it quite a bit, and bringing out more chocolate. I actually prefer the sharpness of a fresh bottle.  The flavor has become much more balanced, loosing a ton of bitterness from the coffee. Chocolate bar sweetness comes through much more, loosing some coffee flavor. In my opinion, this beer is good after a year but hasn't really improved. It became more fruity, and tasted more like a typical Imperial Stout. I don't think there's a reason to age this beer, and I don't have the willpower either.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,homebrew311,4.92,"Poured an '08 bottle in my Chimay chalice. None of my local stores seem to have this years version.  A: Pours a deep blackish brown as a frothy light brown head forms. The head quickly disappears as only a few bubbles stick to the velvety looking surface. Appears very thick.  S: heaps of deep roasted coffee notes with a sturdy roasted barley backing it up. Hints of dark chocolate compliment the robust coffee in the nose.  T: Like the nose, heaps of coffee roll around the tongue. Coffee bitterness fades in to a dark chocolate sweetness. The flavor left on the tongue begs you to take your next sip. This is truly an amazing beer.  M: chewy and thick. The texture matches the bold flavor profile. Excellent balance all around. This is a hearty beer, perfect for breakfast as the name suggests.  D: Everything about this beer is delicious. From the moment the bottle is opened, its presence is known. It looks great in the glass and smells even better. Words don't do justice to the flavor of this beer as it marries three of my favorite things (stouts, coffee, and chocolate) so perfectly.

Deep dark black with maybe a bit of brown on the edges, poured with 1/8th inch brown frothy head, receded quickly.  Smell - The oatmeal comes right through, very noticeable. After I can pick up coffee, chocolate and milk like qualities. Nothing in the nose of alcohol or hops. Smells very sweet and rich. A bit weaker in the nose than I remember or thought it would be.  Taste - This is a great beer, so rich and deep and silky smooth. The chocolate sweetness comes out right away with that coffee right there to greet it. The oatmeal ties in well on the end to give you that rich finish. A bit of bitterness on the end rounds this one out perfectly. Dark woods also tasted.  Mouthfeel - Exceptional, it is velvety smooth almost in the mouth, feels like milk and is just the right weight. This beer just gets it right.  Drinkablity - 8.3%? Couldn't have fooled me, this beer drinks like its 5% just perfect, I think I could knock down the entire 4 pack. Beers like this remind me why I love craft beer.

1199,11757,morimech,3.94,"I believe other beers have surpassed Founders Breakfast Stout in the coffee stout catagory. Still a good stout. Pours black with a small brown head that sadly goes away very quickly even with an aggressive pour. Just a few specks of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Has an aroma of roasted malt, coffee, and hints of chocolate. The malt really comes through in the flavor. If this was not marketed as a coffee infused beer, I would rate the flavor higher. The coffee and chocolate play in the background. Bitterness is moderate. Alcohol is not detected. Medium to full body with nice carbonation. Texture is a tad unremarkable.

1199,11757,Anthony1,4.8,"A: The stout is black and murky, mysterious in its darkness. Nothing escapes through the glass. Atop the body of the ale is a mocha-colored head that laces extensively.  S: The nose is rich, full of bitter coffee and sweeter chocolate notes. The aroma is quite strong, showing off more coffee than roasted malts.  T: Coffee flavors abound upfront, rich and robust they set the tone for the ale. Of all the coffee stouts that I've had, this does to coffee aspect nicely. Most are quite strong on the coffee grounds angle. This one is softer, not as bitter as a few that I've had. The roasted grains nicely compliment the coffee, adding a dark toasted flavor to the body. The combined body is sweet with an excellent flavor. To top it all off, the alcohol, which is pretty high, is nicely hidden.  M: The swirling flavors keep the mouth happy from first sip to last, especially when the ale warms up a bit. This is an excellent pairing of stout and coffee.  D: I had several snifters, allowing each to warm, and loved every one of 'em.

1199,11757,mdale13,4.68,"Let me preface this review by saying I am NOT a coffee drinker. I have tried a few other coffee beers and have not liked them. That is until now.  A- Poured from a 12oz pry-off bottle. Let it sit 10-15 minutes after taking it out of the fridge. Pours a dark black/brown. Totally opaque. No light coming through this bad-boy. I had it in a standard pint glass, and it initially created a 3 finger head, which slowly but surely deteriorated to a steady 1 finger head. Very beautiful beer.  S- Coffee. Freshly ground, sweet, bitter coffee. Hints of chocolate, but mostly coffee.  T- BAM! This beer may very well turn me into a coffee drinker. The taste explodes with a rush of coffee, followed closely by a dash of chocolate, and perhaps a hint of oatmeal, but its very subdued. Sweet, malty, so satisfying. As it warms up, the flavors reach a new level of kick-ass-ness.  M- Smooth. No other word for it. Coats the mouth with a wonderful sticky, somewhat bitter layer, leaving the lush taste of the coffee and chocolate lingering on your tongue.  D- Highly drinkable. The moderately high ABV is totally undetectable, and it finishes so smooth, you instantly want another.  Other- I was tentative to try this one, as a relatively new BA, and only entering the world of stouts in the past month, and as someone who has never had a great love of coffee or coffee beers, I was skeptical. I almost bought a single 12oz bottle, but I decided to trust the hype around this beer and grabbed a full 4-pack, and I am glad I did.

T -- A one - two punch of coffee and chocolate with a nice complement of what seems of spices and malt.  M -- Thick (but not too) and resinous. Just like a good stout should be.

1199,11757,jamescain,4.23,"When pouring this beer you can see how thick it is. Imperial stouts pour slowly and have the appearance of being very thick. As soon as you take the first sip you can feel what you see. It has a very dark color, even when held up to the light it is very dark. It creates a thing ring of head around the top that is brown in color.  The first thing you smell is the roasted malts. My problem was probably the glass I drank it from. It was not a proper glass for smelling the aroma of the beer.  The beer is very creamy and thick but very smooth. the flavor consist dark chocolate and espresso and tons of roasted malts. It is bitter for a stout, which I like but not everyone will like. There is the distinct aftertaste of alcohol; but what do you expect from a beer that is over 8%; however, it is still well hidden while tasting the beer.  This beer is not as filling as a more familiar stout, such as Guinness, and is not as creamy. There is still a nice pinch of carbonation, which adds a refreshing quality to the beer.  Overall the beer is a very good representation of an Imperial stout and for the price it is definitely recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Taste is bitter coffee and chocolate, malts, a small hops pinch on the end. Maybe a little too bitter.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style, but still a fairly solid, heavy beer, a little oily. Light carbonation.  Overall, pretty decent representation of the style. Not quite sure it's worth all the accolades that have been heaped on it, but still a good beer.

S - Roasted malt, bitter chocolate, and coffee are all present with a tint of hop aroma  T - Creamy rich and a meal in a glass. This is very smooth and rich but just right, not too thick. The 8.3% ABV alcohol is hidden very well. This stout had near perfect balance.  M - Creamy with light to carbonation.

1199,11757,FernMaster,3.97,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Founders Breakfast Stout, am I the only person who finds the label for this a tad frightening? The children of the corn kid kind of scares me, not enough to not buy the beer, but enough for me to not keep a bottle. I find this beer to have very little head. The beer I'm reviewing is the 4th from my 4pack and I've poured it into a couple different glasses to try and find the most head, twice now in a pint glass. The pint glass has the most satisfactory result, but the head quickly disappears and just barely laces the glass. I like that it does at least have some lacing though, not a lot of beer does that. Well, kinda. This beer is dark as night. This is a stout, you don't come for pretty colors. The smell has very definite coffee characteristics. It's very heavy, but I appreciate the smell of coffee and it works well in this beer. The taste is very complex and it's heavy in the mouth. (That's what she said) There's a lot of play between the coffee, a hint of chocolate, the malts all of which balance together perfectly so that sometimes a drink might finish different from another. Or more so you focus on different textures and elements each time. I quite love drinking this beer. I unwittingly nursed one for about two hours one time. It really is just a joy to take a small sip and sit and focus on each ingredient in the beer.

It's very nicely balanced by sweet dark malts, vanilla, and a hint of fruit. Not as complex as the amazing smell  Solid mouthfeel that is silky and smooth.

Just the mixture of a bounty of fantastic flavors contributing to the taste bud overload. The creamy endings that are giving this beer legs is just there in the background hiding in this beers greatness.  The feel is lighter than expected.

T- Roasted coffee once again jumps up on the forefront of the palate. Dark chocolate notes become the most prevalent taste and really lingers for quite some time. Not sure if it is from the chocolate or a presence from the hops, but there is a nice bitterness that comes in the taste as well (I am leaning towards more of a bitter chocolate, but there certainly is a hop presence). Taste of warm oatmeal comes across as well which is not surprising in a breakfast stout, but the oat taste is not as large as it would be in an oatmeal stout. Very small taste of alcohol in the taste, not very large considering this is 8.3%. Almost a warming liquor sensation at the end of this beer. Exceptional taste.

My nose is overwhelmed by coffee- I feel as if I'm about to drink some of my dad's favorite bottom of the pot farmer brothers joe. I hope there's more to this beer than this one flavor.  Great, thick and viscous mouthfeel. Almost reminiscent of drinking chocolate if not for the minimal carbonation.  What a truly enjoyable flavor. While there is an abundance of coffee notes in the brew, there's wonderful hints of bitter chocolate, hops, and heaps of toasted- no burnt- malts. This beer is also interesting in the sense that it starts big and finishes smooth, a quality I really appreciate in the world of big bodied stouts.  I sure couldn't drink too many of these, and as a matter of fact this one took me fifteen minutes to down as I wanted it to warm a little before finishing.

The aroma is definitely coffee-centered, but the flavor brings a lot more to the table. In addition to the roasted and bitter coffee flavor, a wonderfully subtle malt sweetness and the earthiness of the oatmeal brings a terrific balance. The overall experience is still very much like a blend of a good dry stout with some fresh brewed java, but with the combination being better than the sum of the parts.

If the glass is swirled with some generous vigor, the head will reemerge. Lacing is out of this world. The foam is gripped to the glass and remains to stick even after some swirling. I'm amazed at how delicious it is, just by looks alone. The smell is incredibly full of roasted coffee. Smells exactly like a cup of some French-pressed coffee I had this morning - so delicious. Underneath all the coffee, there are roasted malts and bittersweet chocolate. The oatmeal is not as pronounced as the others, but deep whiffs help identify it.  The taste is exactly like drinking a cup of black coffee. Roasted qualities throughout the flavor profile. Bittersweet dark chocolate then enters along with the roasted and toasted malts, as well as cooked oatmeal. A bit of the alcohol is evident, but not overpowering at all. The aftertaste is a bit bitter, probably from the roasted coffee beans. It is like that burnt coffee-type bitterness that lingers, not so much hop bitterness. This stout is - nonetheless - heavenly and mouthwatering. Founders really has a gem in this recipe. It's a total package: complex and gratifying in all aspects.  The mouthfeel is full-bodied, as it's very rich and thick in the mouth. The chewiness from the oatmeal is always a plus for me. The drinkability is a definite 5. I love my coffee and my beer. This pairing is a match made in heaven for me. I've got to get some more of this delectable brew for the winter and possibly set some off for aging. This breakfast stout has made its way as one of my favorite imperial stouts. For such a highly ranked beer, it's definitely worth all its hype. I had high expectations and it graciously satisfied all of them.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,diechipmunk,4.72,"Based on all the BA praise, I had high expectations for this beer. It lived up to them.  Had it poured into a snifter-like glass. pitch black, 2 fingers of chocolate whipped cream head.  The aroma was of pipe tobacco, dark roast coffee and a touch of chocolate.  The taste was surprising, I expected a sweet bomb. It is actually very dry, a rush of dark roast coffee and bitter chocolate up front mellowing into an rich oatmeal finish. The flavors are well blended, no drastic changes, all smooth transitions.  The mouthfeel is thick and rich; a stout smoothie.  This is a beer you could sip for hours. The abv is moderate, and and not intrusive, it's not too sweet, not too bitter just a very smooth, flavorful experience.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S: Smells like a strong coffee, not much else coming through.  T: Ok it smells like coffee and sure tastes like coffee, big ole cup of jet black kona baby! Lots of bitter flavor, but it's a coffee bitter and it is in the right amount to make it good and not overpowering. Not much of the chocolate coming through, it is hidden in the background.  M: Smooth. Smooth and thick, but the coffee seems to cut this brew enough to give it a rough edge so to speak.  Overall Wow big taste difference between a fresh bottle and a bottle with a year's age on it. Aging brings out the chocolate and mellows the coffee.

A- A jaw dropping jet black... not sure if you can get too much more beautiful that this... Wonderful one finger head that left a fantastic lace throughout the traditional tulip glass that it was served in.  S- Coffee, Chocolate, Booze. Three wonderful things in one glass.  T- This was actually my third FBS, and each time I have had this I am in awe of how wonderfully balanced, yet thoroughly complex this beer is... The Coffee and Chocolate as well as the somewhat pronounced feel of hops is combined in such a way that is simply orgasmic...  M- Full bodied is an understatement... You practically chew this beer...  D- The thing that astounds me maybe the most is the drinkability of this beer. Granted at 8% it isn't exactly the hardest hitter as Imperial Stouts go, but I could honestly drink this again and again and again...  One of the, if not the, best beers I have ever had...

1199,11757,heliosphann,3.35,"'09 release. 12oz stubby bottle (now with pry off caps!). Served in my Founders Black Party Pint glass. Seemed fitting...  A: Pours a Blacker than Black. Virtually no head. Some minimal lacing which leaves a clear film.  S: Strong roasted coffee. Lying underneath is some chocolate coco crispies. Not overly complex. If you like pungent coffee, this ones for you.  T: Just like it smells, HEAVY roasted coffee mixed with some smooth, dark chocolate. Rounding things out are some earthy hops, and roasted malts. The finish is strongly dominated by bitter coffee and a little bit of alcohol.  M: Medium bodied. Feels both heavy and light at points. Somewhat creamy and smooth, probably due to the Oatmeal. Despite the lack of head, carbonation is very solid and works with the style.  D: At 8.3%, you could probably knock back a few of these if you so desired. However, one 12oz is more than enough for me. The bitterness from the coffee is quite powerful, as that's all I can taste in my mouth now. Ugh...  I've always found Founders Breakfast Stout to be ho-hum, and never understood all the love for this brew. I've had much better coffee stouts that I feel deliver a much more satisfying and balanced experience. But then again what do I know?

1199,11757,r0nyn,4.5,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  I honestly thought I was pouring motor oil into my glass. Jet black and looking like it has the viscosity of the stuff that runs my car, it's definitely one of the most impressive, if intimidating brews I've ever laid eyes on. Tannish head is minimal and leaves a good amount of lacing. Smell is...just wow. Dark chocolate with a nice backing of coffee and roasted malts. Very rich and full smell.  The hops present themselves right off the bat, giving the first sip a bitter kick to start off. They give way to a different bitterness that somehow manages to find a balance, the coffee taste becoming rather evident after a few moments. Dark chocolate is there as well, bit more subdued than in the smell, but it mixes well with the coffee to give the brew a great flavoring that isn't too sweet, but just right. The maltiness from the smell is also there, just enough to provide some roasted flavor. The finish is big and chewy, with a return to bitterness towards the very end that lingers into the aftertaste for quite some time. The stout is full-bodied and a bit on the heavy side, with the medium amount of carbonation allowing the creamy feel to come through while also spreading the flavor around.  Drinkability is only slightly impaired by the 8.3% ABV, you can't really taste it, but it's there. Owing to it's fullness and big body, you probably won't get through more than one in a sitting, but if you want to, more power to you. This is defiintely one of the best stouts I've ever had it's certainly deserving of all the accolades bestowed upon it.

1199,11757,brokensail,4.47,"Big thanks to stubone for sending me this beer in a recent trade.  A: I poured this into my Arrogant Bastard pint glass and was struck by the absolute black, viscous nature of this beer. It has a thin layer of mocha foam on top.  S: A huge wave of coffee aroma hit me right in the face, followed by bitter chocolate. A lot of roasted malt character comes through on subsequent sniffs, but I do not get much, if any oat.  T: Just like the aroma, the taste is absolutely full of coffee. The chocolate and roast malt come through in force in the middle of the palate, and then the coffee comes back and lingers on the finish. The finish, besides being full of coffee flavor, also gives an excellent bitterness, probably from the coffee and chocolate.  M: As I said in the appearance portion, this beer is very viscous. Despite the thickness, it is very smooth and goes down quite easily. The carbonation is low, but that's to be expected.  D: I was expecting this to be a really tough to take down. While it is filling, it is such a complex and delicious beer I just couldn't help but drink this and finish wanting more.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,blackenmn,4.43,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass:  Appearance and Smell-It poured a nice thick black with just the slightest bit of a brown tone to it. Head was small but a great creamy tan one which left some serious lacing before disipating. Smell was very roasty, could smell sweet dark chocolate in there which really drew me in. Coffee took a bit of backseat to that one but was definitely present. Smell really came out as it warmed a bit, could tell this was going to be a sweet one.  Taste and Mouthfeel-Taste was even better than the smell somehow. The expected chocolate was wonderful. Smelled of dark chocolate and came through a nice sweet milk chocolate like flavor which trumped the even the very roasty initial malt scent. Coffee was very present in the nice feint hoppy finish which really balanced this thing to a level of greatness. Creamy sweet feel to this brew was really superb.  Drinkabilty:This was a great brew. Very little ABV present until the last warming sip. A very sweet, extremely chewy, and unique stout.

The black black bottom layer, the layer of bubbly head mixed with some more beer, and a layer of just liquidy foam, all racing for the bottom, defying the rules of physics. This beer is an obsidian black, no light comes through, not even from a maglight at point blank range. The head is dark tan and creamy, leaving a great lace as it goes down.  S: For all the mention of coffee, this beer doesn't have that much of a coffee smell, more just roasted malt, including maybe some black patent and unmalted barley? It smells great, but that coffee just isn't coming through. More chocolate, and I don't smell anything resembling oatmeal. It's a pretty standard smelling beer, powerful, but not too creative. About halfway down the bowl of my Sam Adams Perfect pint glass, I just got nailed with the coffee. As it warms up, I get more of it. Much more, I need to finish before it overwhelms.  T: Hmm, I get some try roastiness but also some sweet maltiness. And here is the coffee, but still not as strong as I first expected, but more in line with what I was expecting after the smell. Its a very clean bitter, though the more I drink the more it lingers. It almost has a little sourness to it as well. As it warms, the bitter coffee becomes MUCH more evident, though I'm just not sure I'm diggin the mesh of coffee and malt. And there aren't hops, which there shouldn't be.  M: Thin, too thin.

Not pungent at all, welcoming  Taste: Coffee-like flavor thats very pronounced, with not so subtle hints of nuts, just as the smell warns. Maybe some carmel/chocolate-esque tastes? Rich, but not overly rich. Higher alcohol content, but wouldn't know it.  Mouthfeel: thicker, smooth and easy going down. Feels a bit like milk (but in no way is that to be what one thinks of during this incredible beer!)  Drinkability: Definitely a food beer, accompanied my burger quite well.

1199,11757,cbutova,4.88,"Mini-tasting of greatness with atremains tonight, this and Sculpin = mouth orgasm. This is probably the fourth or fifth time I have had this baby, finally get the chance to review it. This is probably the way a stout should look, pitch black with a dark TAN two finger head that retains like a swimming pool evaporates, it sticks around for a while. This also has the thickest lacing I have ever seen, I love it, my glass is pretty much tan now instead of clear, the lacing also sticks of the glass about 1mm into the glass, crazy. Stouts should aim for this look. Smell is great here but it's probably the weakest part of the beer, somehow. It is mostly coffee and roasted malts, the chocolate doesn't really shine through for me and I would want it to more. Taste is absolutely orgasmic. You get lots of coffee, lots of oatmeal sweetness, some dark bitter chocolate and roasted malts also, there is some hoppiness in the end of the taste also, a great balance of many tastes that I love. I just picked up on a milky/vanilla flavor in the end of the taste. The mouthfeel is great for the style and this beer, it is thick like oil, has great carbonation, no real alcohol presence at all and leaves a great bitter coffee aftertaste on the tongue, another five. Drinkability is perfect for me also, the taste is enough for me to drink those one many times in the future, I don't think I would get sick of the flavors after one or two of these (would never session this one anyways), the price is fine for the amazing quality of this one, I will definitely buy this one again, thank you Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The lacing is intense on this one. Sticks to the glass like syrup, enticing to watch it slowly slide down the glass back into the brew. Pure coffee bean, chocolate in the nose. Huge coffee bitterness mellowed by a great balance of dark chocolate and oatmeal. The coffee taste on this one is great, compares the intensity of speedway or peche. Very well balanced flavors here. Very creamy on the tongue, full bodied and a nice heavy coat with the finish. The carbonation lays low here, and the alcohol is masked quite well. This is very drinkable for what it is.

Black coffee bitterness abounds. I was expecting a sweeter character. Just my expectations, so I was wrong. No wonder they call it ""breakfast stout"", this is cup of black Joe in beer form.  T: Stout it is! This beer is big in every way. The aromas carry over to the flavors. I'm not a coffee drinker (however I do like coffee ice cream), so I think I was wishing this had the coffee flavor but with a sweeter malt bill. Coffee bitterness for sure. Great after dinner coffee right here in beer form. Coffee and dessert all in one. I liked it more an more as I slowly drank through the whole glass.  M: Smooth. Bit of a creamy texture, but not overly. The coffee sort of cuts through the creaminess. Nice.  Overall: No doubt; a world class Stout. Not my first choice simply due to the abundance of coffee and more coffee. I prefer a Milk/Sweet Stout, I guess. Got to give this one props, though. And I will have it again.

Only the tiniest ruby hues show when held to the light. The thickness is almost menacing.  Smells are all coffee grounds up front. Fresh and nutty. Not overpowering. Chocolate pushes through as it warms. Muy excelente.  Tastes like coffee up front. Bitter and black. As it warms the coffee takes a side seat to the dark chocolate flavors. The coffee kicks in at the finish with a pleasing bitter roastiness.  Breakfast Stout is thick on the palate with low carbonation, and it really helps the experience.

1199,11757,DefenCorps,4.4,"At Pizzeria Paradiso yesterday.  As with all incarnations of the Breakfast Stout, this one's a stunner. Jet black, large creamy head that lasts for what seems to be an eternity, leaving tons of lace. On the nose, it's gorgeous, with a ton of chocolate and coffee. Not too sweet, and the coffee character is fantastic. On the palate, it opens up with a ton of chocolate and coffee, with the chocolate being more prominent than out of the bottle. The combination is just delectable. Some oatmeal flavor is present, adding to the wholesomeness of this beer. Medium bodied with an excellent finish with espresso and dark chocolate characteristics, it's awesome. The nitro-pour is a little disappointing, though - the first few sips are incredibly creamy, but as I wait for the beer to warm up, it turns to being a little flat and just a little watery.

1199,11757,afausser,4.5,"Poured into a cervoise.  Appearance: Pours an opaque dark chocolate, coffee-like color, almost black, letting no light through whatsoever save for the head. The consistency of the pour reminds me of two percent milk. There is about a finger of head which quickly disappears, but leaves nice lacing behind.  Smell: heavy coffee scent, and hints of dark chocolate, as well as raspberries, and wheat bread. To me, the coffee scent almost overwhelms the others, but it also blends well with the chocolate until they seem almost indistinguishable. It also gives off a smoky, charcoal scent as well as notes of tobacco.  Taste: The coffee taste is not too overwhelming--from the smell I was worried that it might be--and blends well. The coffee taste provides a little bitterness, but there is almost no alcohol-related bitter taste. There is some slight warming, which is nice on a beer with flavors this complex and heavy, but not really an alcohol taste. In fact, when chilled, it tastes almost like drinking a slightly heavier, very dark roast of ice coffee.  Mouthfeel: A decent amount of carbonation, but it lifts up the flavors. I honestly thought that this would not be as smooth as it is given the pour. I'm not exactly sure I like the carbonation, but I think that it's probably the best possible level. As it warms, the beer becomes almost creamy, and a little thicker going down.  Drinkability--Very smooth, especially for a dark beer. Like I said earlier, it's a lot like having ice coffee--a really chocolately, complex, delicious, alcoholic ice coffee, but...well, you get my drift. Very well done for the style and the ABV. I'm impressed.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ahalloin,4.26,"Reviewed today from a bottle from last year's release. I can tell because, it is a twist off cap and Founders has smartly moved to pry off. No freshness date, but I would bet this baby would age for a year just fine.  When I twisted off the cap, there was a resounding release of CO2. This was only confirmed by an incredibly active head even with a ginger pour of the bottle into a deep Hennepin glass. The head that formed was incredibly billowy. So much so that I had to wait 5 minutes to pour a bit more, then another 2 minutes to finish off the bottle. Pours an incredibly black fluid with only a slight hint of mahogony around the very edges. The previously mentioned billowy head took on a nice light brown color and left quite a froth atop the beer long after I was done pouring.  S: A whiff over the glass reveals an incredibly roasty coffee smell with hints of dates, chocolate, and melted caramel. The coffee tinge is dominant but not excessive.  T: Initial tastes reveal a strong roasty backbone with low-bitterness coffee and dark chocolate. As it warms the background allows hints of figs, cocoa, and singed toffee to shine through. The roasty finish is over powering and lingers long after your last sip.  Mouthfeel is somewhat slick but with ample carbonation to keep the beer dancing in your mouth.  D: This is a tough category. This beer doesn't shy away from full-frontal flavor (alliteration!). It grabs your taste buds and drags them through a bitter bath of 85% raw coffee grounds and 15% dark-a$$ chocolate. Then leaves you bleeding bitterness on your tongue for a good 95 seconds after you swallowed. I dig it. Apparently BAs dig it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Taste absolutely no alcohol, I double checked to make sure it said 8.3%  Mouthfeel is suprisingly smooth for the amount of flavor and the intense smell of this beer.

1199,11757,MasterSki,4.62,"Just picked up some of the new batch at Lakeview Binny's. Served in my trusty Surly pint glass.  A - Three fingers of medium-dark mocha foam that dissipates very slowly and leaves some patchy lacing. Black body with the tiniest sliver of dark brown at the bottom of the glass.  S - Dark roast coffee, baker's chocolate, roasted malts, light floral hoppiness, hint of tobacco and smoke, a little bit of dark fruits and vanilla. Pretty complex - it's what a coffee stout should taste like!  T - The taste has some pretty intense coffee bitterness, with more of a dark chocolate vibe happening. It's nicely balanced by sweet dark malts, vanilla, and a hint of fruit. Not as complex as the amazing smell (the light tobacco/smoke element is gone).  M - Low carbonation, super smooth and oatmealy, with a medium-thick body that's actually a little thinner than I remembered. It's like a slightly melted milkshake. Roasty and dry finish that I really like.  D - Damn, I put down most of this one in record time. The intense roastiness and slight coffee acidity might prevent me from having more than a few bottles, but this is super drinkable stuff.  This is one of those beers that I totally take for granted.

There's definitely some coffee in here, including a roasted / smoky aroma, but what's really gripping is an oak-like, surprisingly strong aroma of wood. There's some bitter cocoa in there as well. The first thing on the tongue is roasted coffee beans with a bit of an acrid, smoky edge complimented by rich dark chocolate with a woody undertone. Underneath are some hops that add a nice earthy, herbal flavor. Notes of cooked oatmeal are definitely in here, especially the finish. The ABV is very well hidden underneath the flavors.

If it involves coffee it's there. Sweet malty smell also. A hoppy and chocolaty delight. I still can't get over how good this stout smells.  T: Good thing the taste doesn't let up what so ever. Chocolate, bitter dark roast coffee, hops, smokey bitterness, and vanilla. This beer really reminds me of a straight shot of espresso. It starts smooth and finishes bitter. A creamy double imperial masterpiece.  M: Light medium to medium mouthfeel. Carbonation seems just right. Hell everything about this beer seems just right.  D: Oh can you say drinkability? For as bitter and bruising as this beer is, damn it goes down smooth. Absolutely perfect ABV in my opinion. Not too weak but not so high that you only drink one.

1199,11757,RyWill,4.4,"A beer I've had many times when I lived in Boston both on tap and in a bottle, but it definitely wasn't as fresh as this now that I live in Chicago.  Appearance: Jet black, pours incredibly thick with a coffee/chocolate colored head that sticks around.  Smell: Roasted coffee, chocolate, malt, with a slight bitterness throughout.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Coffee. If you don't like coffee this beer probably isn't for you. The chocolate and oatmeal help to mellow the bitterness out a bit and also add a lot to the thick, creamy texture. As it warms the mouthfeel gets thicker, creamier, and definitely more enjoyable. A reason in itself to get this beer out of the fridge and let it get to that 50-55 before you drink it.  Drinkability: Nothing resembling the 8.3% abv in the taste, but still its full bodied and the overwhelming coffee flavor often relegates it to an after dinner beer for me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,crossovert,4.18,"Here we go, my first FBS that is just a week or so old. A ""Malt beverage brewed with chocolate and coffee"", 60 IBUs, 8.3% alcohol. Comes in a stubby-ish 12 oz bottle with a pop off cap.  Pours into my american pint glass. Looks like syrup as it pours and forms a thick 2 finger burnt caramel sandy looking head that sticks around before receding and leaving behind some fine lacing. A thick layer of head stays on top. The beer it self is pitch black, and I mean 100% opacity even on the fringes.  Smell is heavy on coffee with that thick, fresh, bitter roasted coffee shoppe scent. Also hints of dark chocolate, dark fruit, and brown sugar. Coffee and malt madness for the most part.  Smell carries into taste in a massive way. Huge coffee bitterness up front with the decadent chocolate in the middle, finishing with coffee infused hop IBU's. Im not a coffee drinker but the taste of this one doesn't put me off one bit, especially with the huge sweet and roasty malt backbone. The subtle lemon hops can be found in the background with a concentrated taste and subtly accent the coffee superbly. Burps reveal more hops which mix beautifully with the bitter coffee.  Mouthfeel is decadent and super full bodied. There is a great amount of carbonation and a coffee-like smoothness that caresses the tongue.  The drinkablility suffers simply because this is such a big brew. The alcohol isn't completely hidden though it doesn't hinder the drinkablility, rather it accents the flavors and warms. I can't wait to try this again in winter. That being said the massiveness of this one gets you full with one bottle.  Overall one of my favorite stouts, for my personal tastes it doesn't make the top 20 but there is true quality in this stuff that isn't hidden even to someone like me who isn't into the big coffee flavor as much. The addition of hops and chocolate really help this one be more palatable for non coffee drinkers.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,movingtrain,4.57,"Picked up a growler of Breakfast Stout at Party Town in Florence, KY. Poured into a snifter.  Pours black, with a light creamy tan head.  Smells of coffee, bitter chocolate, molasses...some super dark malty notes here...and very coffee-like. Sweet on the nose, but not overly sweet smelling.  Taste is amazing...dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee. The alcohol is coming through, but not overpowering. Some hints of vanilla, pepper, and some other spices...  Overall, this stout is incredible. It's dry, but not too dry. It has some sweet notes, and the coffee flavor lingers for a long time.

There's a lot going on with the smell: semisweet dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses, oak, a subtle smokiness, and loads of rich black coffee. The taste is similar.. it is very sweet with a lot of vanilla and a little nuttiness. Mouthfeel is not as creamy as I was expecting, very carbonated and a little on the fizzy end.

1199,11757,Patrick999,4.51,"Finally, the acclaimed Breakfast Stout makes its way to my glass. Let's do it!  Poured into my Stone imperial pint kinda lazily. Thin head, requisite darkness.  I give it a few sniffs. Hell yeah. This is what I'm talking about. F'ing chocolate, hazelnut and of course coffee, with a minimum of roastiness.  Every now and again, it's great to have an imperial stout that isn't roasty to all hell. Indeed, the dark roast coffee flavors are at a minimum...hell, it's like drinking slightly less-sweetened coffee ice cream. Whatever coffee they use for this, it seems like a light, bright roast...dare I say it, a breakfast blend. OK, obviously there is a shitload of coffee in here, but the underlying beer isn't half bad either. Very smooth drinking, kinda creamy yet with a reasonably lively mouthfeel.  Name be damned, I honestly don't think I want this with my oatmeal at 7AM. It is 8%, after all. That said, for an 8% stout, I don't think you can get much better drinkability, as long as you like coffee. Reminds me of the Terrapin Wake N Bake.

The head receded relatively quickly to a thick collar.  S-Roasted coffee beans, chocolate, fresh-pressed coffee. The aroma was rich and inviting, but perhaps a bit one-dimensional.  T-Rich, heavy-roasted coffee *SMACK* right off the bat, and it keeps flying for the whole flavor. It doesn't give up. Earthiness appears in the middle and lingers into the finish. Roasty astringency pairs with a firm hop bitterness to keep things in line. Sweet, dar fruitiness emerges near the finish, providing some additional depth. The chocolate seemed absent in the flavor.  M-Medium to medium-full body, making a good presence on my palate. Medium-low carbonation is smooth, appropriate. Nothing spectacular, but surely above average.  D-For its size and ABV, this beer seems to be surprisingly drinkable. I'm glad that Founders is now in the Twin Cities, and that I have the opportunity to drink this scrumptious brew.

The head never leaves except for the part that sticks to you glass.  Smell: It smells very strongly of old-coffee-pot coffee. Bitter and roasty. Lots of dark roated malt and some chocolate hints. I could go for more chocolate and less coffee, but thats being too picky. It smells intense and delicious.  Taste: Like the smell, dominated by bitter coffee. If you really like the bitterness of plain iced coffee like I do, this is for you. The chocolate is again more subtle than I'd like, and I miss it more in the taste than I did in the smell. On the other hand, this is breakfast stout, not dessert stout. There's also some spiciness and some real hoppiness too. The finish is practically eternal and some nice sweetness comes through here too.  Mouthfeel: Quite full and smooth. A little foamy in your mouth. Almost chewy. It could be fuller, I guess, but not much.  Drinkability: This is awesome stuff. Intense coffee flavor. At 8%, you can still get away with having 2 for yourself when you're in the mood.

Even when served too cold it poured like motor oil with a small, brown head. There's not a drop of light shining through. Brilliant.  The smell is roasty-toasty malts, dark chocolate and coffee beans.  Oh, momma. Coffee, bittersweet chocolate and massive malts. FBS ain't nothin' to fuck with.

S: Plenty of dark chocolate and coffee but a ton of leafy, tobacco-ish hops come through with big toasted malts  T: The taste is very bitter but cut nicely with more sweet than bitter chocolate. The leafy hops still play a huge role in the slightly but not unpleasantly acrid finish.  M: The mouthfeel is smooth generally except that the finish is a bit astringent. Carbonation is really low and it has a really nice coating, viscous quality that is good but not too much.  D: Deadly good drinkability and superior quality.

Appearance: Vigorous pours yields a pitch black, opaque sludge with a finger of mocha brown head that slowly disappears leaving a thing film along the top of the beer, and tons of gorgeous lacing down the sides of the glass.  Smell: From far away, toasted malts of chocolate and grains reigns supreme. As the glass moves closer, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, toffee, and cream all make an appearance. Toasted oats are very faint, but the sweet malts are the most prevalent notes in the nose of this beer.  Taste: Sweet, chocolaty, malty, coffee goodness. At first, this beer seems like it's going to be a coffee stunner, but as it moves to the middle of the tongue, the bitterness recedes and the chocolate and toffee flavors jump forward. The finish is all sticky, toasted oats and grain malt flavors. There's a slight alcoholic taste that lingers as well, but the sheer variety of flavors and the smoothness of the transitions is amazing.  Mouthfeel: This beer has it all. Initially, the beer is perfectly carbonated, and slightly crisp. At the end, the beer is surprisingly sticky, coating the tongue with sweet, molasses yumminess.  Drinkability: This beer is frighteningly drinkable. The 8.3% ABV is well-hidden, but the beer still manages to pack a little bit of a punch. It certainly doesn't help that the beer is so tasty that you find yourself taking sip after sip just to enjoy another kaleidoscope of flavors.

Exceptional flavor with an intense, rounded coffee/chocolate flavor, a touch of nuttiness, and a bit of earthiness as well.  I don't feel that the hop structure is overwhelming, as many of my colleagues claim, largely because the temperment begins to round out on the back end. Certainly not thin in the mouth, but it does possess a softness reminiscent of the oats that balances the beer remarkably well. Again, the beer seems to come into its own and develop a more full-bodied structure as it warms.

1199,11757,MaltistLupulist,3.83,"I had tried this once before, but the bottle I had purchased was smothered in dust and might as well have been in a petrified state by the time I got to it. Despite its robust 8.3% abv, it is still a bit too weak to age gracefully, and it was clear that the flavor had been compromised, calling for a do-over. Some eighteen months later, with a bottle of freshly-released BS in my possession, the time has come.  Poured into an oversized snifter. Opaque black with a gray, maroon-tinged foam, which slowly settles into a quarter-finger of sustained head, yielding moderate, if patchy, lacing. It doesn't look particularly viscous, but no worries, flavor trumps mouthfeel any day, in my book at least.  The aroma consists of an interplay between coffee and chocolate, both bitter, minimally refined in the case of the chocolate (cacao nibs) and heavily refined/darkly roasted in the case of the coffee. I dunno....I'm starting to become a bit skeptical: I'm sort of a coffeegeek, so I'm very finicky about my a.m. beverage of choice, and while I like Indonesian coffee (BS is brewed with Sumatra), I detest dark roasts, as darkly-roasted beans will obscure the subtle (in this case, earthy) flavors of the coffee itself and yield only that roasty flavor with which those of us who have been conditioned by Starbucks have become so familiar. Oh, and I don't care much for chocolate, either. I rather abhor it, actually.  The flavor affirms my suspicions: acerbic, a bit too bitter for my taste. It's difficult to tell whether the chocolate or the coffee is to blame. They're certainly both culprits, but in the final analysis I think the chocolate, despite my diatribe about the evils of darkly-roasted coffee, is the senior offender of the grimace-inducing duo: that taste reminiscent of those natural chocolate bars you get at Whole Foods and natural foods stores that are like 70-80% raw cacao is unmistakable and, in my case at least, cringe-inducing. The coffee plays a role, too, for sure, but I may have unfairly impugned its function in my earlier rant: it may even be a quality medium roast that holds the harsh flavor of the cacao at bay, that is, this beer'd be a degree bitterer if it weren't for the coffee. On the other hand, though, perhaps only a dark roast has the fortitude to withstand the brewing process and to emerge as a peer of the other flavor characteristics at play. Speaking of which, there's also a subtle but noticeable hoppiness (Piney? Grassy? Horsy? Who knows-- it's there, but this isn't the kind of beer in which lupulin is the focus) which would have eluded detection if it weren't for my allergies (I's sneezin' like a m---f---).  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied (other reviewers say this is viscous, but I flirted with classifying it as ""light-to-medium-bodied""; standards differ, I suppose...) with a mild sticky sweetness; lightly carbonated.  Some alcohol is just barely apparent in the taste: if I were rating drinkability purely in terms of alcohol, this'd be a 5, but that acerbic cacao flavor knocks it down a ways.  In summary, I'm a coffee lover, and for a long time I was open to the notion that coffee and beer could mix well together in the same vessel, make bosom buddies. BS has made me rethink that position. Sure, this was better than the monstrosity that resulted the time I lobbed a shot of Counter Culture Toscano into a Stone RIS, but it nonetheless made me want to keep my coffee and my beer on polar opposite ends of the kitchen, with zero likelihood that they cross paths. To be sure, this is an impressive brew in many ways, for instance the manner in which the chocolate and the coffee interact with each other and present a united front to one's palate. However, to someone with as narrow a sense of taste as I, this is a beer which will be checked off and seldom revisited.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,sarigianis,4.15,"Pours deep inky black. The head resembles a chocolate milkshake.  Aroma reminds me of dark chocolate covered espresso beans. A creamy sweetness comes through.  At first sip it is very creamy, but it quickly turns to an overwhelming roasted bitterness, followed by a hop bite. The finish is warming and you can tell where the 8.3% is. Coffee bean bitterness takes control in this brew  This is an intense beverage.

1199,11757,Reaper16,4.33,"fresh 2009 bottle served into a tulip  Pours a deep brown that looks viscous and black coming out of the bottle. The shade of the head strikes me as mocha, but that might just be subliminal coffee thoughts talking. An easy-going pour yields a one and a half finger head that leaves nice notches of lace.  A predominance of coffee hits the nose first and foremost. Chocolate malt and generic grain scents peek through. As the beer warms, you can make out the oat presence. This is a beer that really opens up as it warms. What was initially a generic coffee bouquet that was lacking in complexity has turned into a rich, nutty smell that marks some quality brewing. Decent grade espresso smells shine through at the peak temperature.  Taste follows the nose. Let this beer warm up a bit. Once you do, you'll realize that this has to be one of (if not THE) best coffee stouts in the world. The roasted flavors and the light, fruity acidity make for a remarkable fully realized coffee flavor package. The chocolate isn't to be ignored, either, tempering the acidity with a certain degree of nuttiness. Some earthy hops on the back end provide welcome bitterness. This is all so well-crafted. I wouldn't call this a balanced beer, as the coffee is the focal point, but all of the flavors work together so well.  The mouthfeel is right on the money. A touch thinner than I expected, but the relative lightness works well with the flavor profile. I have no choice but to score the drinkability high. This is a stout that, if the flavor profile appeals to you, will have you thinking about seconds, thirds, and a trip to the liquor store to pick up a case. At only 8% ABV yet fully-loaded with flavor, this is a dream.  I'm glad that this is readily available where I live now. This is a seasonal beer to look forward to and to be cherished.

Big roasted malt and coffee smell and just a hint of chocolate. Big coffee up front followed by sweet roasted malt and chocolate. If you were going to taste the hops its at the end and in the after taste. This beer goes down like butta, perfect carbonation makes for easy drinking. At a little bit over 8% this beers hides it well and i could definitely drink more than one. I so happy Founders is available near me now one less awesome beer I have to trade for.

1199,11757,soupyman10,4.56,"Saw this one on tap at the fantastic new Pizza-P's in Dupont Circle and couldn't possibly pass it by. Pours a pitch black color with a beautiful tan foamy head that sits around for ever. Excellent lacing as it drains. Basically looks perfect. Nose is very nice, if a little milder than expected. Coffee (more than just about any other beer I've smelt), roasted malt, chocolate dominate. Maybe a touch of dried fruit in there. Taste is excellent - like the nose, but stronger. Chocolate all over the place, mixing with a dirty roasted malt and a quite but continual mix of coffee as well. Really an excellent flavor. Body is perfect, creamy and thick. Overall, a fantastic beer that, despite it's thickness and heaviness, I could legitimately drink all night.

1199,11757,Stunner97,4.25,"Appearance- Very dark black in color, pitch black for sure, nice bubbles stream nicely up the side of the glass, Nice tan foam head sits beautifully, very nice appearance  Smell- Strong coffee just dominates the nose, slight dark chocolate, but really just more then anything on the nose a strong blast of coffee, could easily fool someone that they were about to sip a nice warm coffee, smell is just so powerful,  Taste- overwhelmingly coffee flavors just destroy your palate up front, then your hit with a very slight chocolate finish but its short, then you taste a wallop of hops in the back end which provide a very nice balance to the initial up front coffee explosion, very extremely long finish that goes on and on, very little at least to me notice of alcohol on the finish, mostly just coffee and bitter hops, its a very tasty beer with a nice finish, i think it really does open up well to as it gets warmer  Mouthfeel- The mouthfeel on this beer is very unique and special, very thick almost feel like you could chew this beer down and a nice touch of carbonation on your tongue,  Drinkability- Extremely drinkable even though I am not truely a real big coffee lover though have become one more and more through enjoying the flavors of the stouts, funny I didnt come the other way came from beer to coffee not other way, Enjoyable but not sure i could ever have more then one of these in a single sitting and I gotta mark down a touch for that just too much coffee for me to drink more then one, One to try and seek out and probably one if your an absolute coffee lover you would love even more then i do,",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,SRossman,4.33,"This bottle has been sitting for a while. There isn't a date on the bottle but it's at least 6 months to a year old.  A: Opaque black color. Even while pouring, light isn't penetrating the stream as it falls into my glass. There's a brief mocha head that fades fairly quickly to a ring.  S: Chocolate is the first things coming through in the aroma. Dark rich cocoa. Very faint coffee just in the background and some underlying roasted malt.  T: Ahhh that's the stuff. Rich chocolate and malt characteristics, balanced out by bitter coffee roast. This beer tastes like chocolate cake and espresso.  MF/D: Very rich and slick on the palate, with the oatmeal helping keep the mouthfeel very smooth. Carbonation and body are right where they should; heavy on the body, low on the carbonation. The 8% ABV is well masked, I only get the faintest hint of booze on the finish. Again, this is balanced perfectly.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,WorldWideStout,4.5,"A: Very dark brown, though not the darkest I've seen. When I tilt my snifter to the side, the color lightens up a bit to a warm medium brown on the sides. I didn't get too much head out of the pour.  S: Perhaps the strongest-smelling beer I've ever had. Wonderful rich, dark coffee smell, as if I just opened a bag of coffee beans. I'm not a coffee drinker, but I spent about a minute just smelling the beer. A bit of chocolate and oatmeal as well, but coffee dominates.  T: Big notes of coffee right at the start, but it quickly recedes. Right after there is some milk chocolate, with a touch of sweetness. Towards the middle the oatmeal comes out, with a bit of coffee appearing again. The coffee flavor appears at the end again, with a bit more acidity this time. A little bitterness lingers as a not-unpleasant after taste, but doesn't stick around too long. I think that if I liked coffee more, I would have given taste a 5.  M: Fairly chewy and full, though not as thick and viscous as I was preparing for.  D: At only 8.3% and with a non-overwhelming mouthfeel, it's pretty drinkable, but the intense coffee flavor makes this one a beer I wouldn't have all the time.  All in all a quite impressive brew, and if I liked coffee more, would probably be my new favorite stout. With the acidity from the coffee bean flavors, it also seems like it would be an excellent beer to have a cigar with, if you are partial to those.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,WJVII,4.33,Thanks CDKrenz... Poured into a pint glass this brew was as thick as chocolate milk and silky smooth. A nice thick and creamy head slowly builds and leaves this nice foamy cap 1/4 inch thick. The smell is of roasted coffee and malts. There is a chocolate presence and some hazelnut. The taste is nice and creamy with a little burnt malt after taste. There is a nice slight bitter hop balance as you drink this and the lacing leaves a map of where you last sips were.

S - Very complex strong aroma of roasted malt, oatmeal, and chocolate. Just a taste of whats to come. Very inviting.  T - Strong coffee mocha flavor coats the palate, followed by a noticeable oatmeal flavor. The taste finishes with a nice cocoa finish. Very complex and highly delicious!  M - Somewhere between medium and heavy bodied. Low amount of carbonation and very very smooth.  D - The only thing that would keep me from having too many of these at one time is the ABV. The flavor is amazing and the mouthfeel incredibly smooth. Overall, just an amazing beer. I can see why there is so much hype over this beer.

1199,11757,vacax,4.13,"Black with a one-finger mocha head. Good retention, dies down to a carpet of fine bubbles that leaves a trail of lace. Aroma is full of black coffee, cocoa, sugar cookies, biscuits. The taste has an initial assault of dark roasted malts and loads of black coffee. Some sugar and only the faintest touch of dark fruit are detectable behind all of the coffee which comes close to overwhelming everything. Personally I can't really pick out the chocolate. This is a good stout that brings coffee in my in ridiculous quantities, but balances that with a sweet backbone and lots of roasty goodness. Long coffee and roast finish.  Sure I have had more coffee thrown in my face, but that can get undesirable, and this is fully desirable. Full body, but not thick, the slippery oatmeal quality comes out as it warms. Nice medium smooth carbonation level. The coffee makes me take my time drinking this, but it drinks well. A bottle can be done solo, or it could be shared, yet I am glad I do not have to drink a bomber of this by my lonesome. For me Breakfast Stout is worth drinking on occasion, but not something I would spend energy in seeking out. This costs me $8 a pop and the bottle I had before this one was infected.

Poured into an oversized wine glass jet black with a brownish-maroon ring. No head with an extremely minimal amount of lacing that doesn't coat the glass. It's 8:25p.m. and the OVERPOWERING coffee nose has me thinking I'm late for work! Chocolate and malt play the role of The Pips to the Gladys Knight that is the coffee nose. Very complimentary and one I could spend all night only taking giant whiffs of this beer and be content. Just as the coffee dominates the smell, it takes over the taste as well. I love a good cup or two of coffee each morning, but I was expecting the chocolate to come out differently in this - possibly sweeter? Don't get me wrong, the chocolate is present, but it reminds me of a baker's chocolate - very sharp. The malts do play off of the coffee well, however. Being surprised, actually very surprised, at the taste doesn't degrade this in my book as I now view it in a different yet positive light than my expectations going in. Mouthfeel is light, not chewy but coats the throat and leaves a noticeable aftertaste. I am only halfway through my beer and just like every morning 12 hours from now with my first large coffee, I find myself involuntarily wanting another.

Taste starts with strong roasted malts, cofee, chocolate, bitterness all in balance and harmony.  The flavors remain through the middle and ends with a nice dry bitterness.  The taste lingers and prompts me to take the next sip.  Drink it close to room temp 60 to 65 degrees to get all the flavors.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,katan,3.7,"12 oz bottle into a goblet  A - A black color with only the lightest amber hues around the edges. Opaque like motor oil. Little carbonation head forms, and only a film is retained.  S - A combination of roasted barley, coffee, and chocolate on the nose. Certainly a lean towards the coffee side, from something that seems cold steeped - strong. A caramel sweetness starts to become more apparent as the beer is decanted more.  T - Starts with an immediate bitter, astringent, acidic coffee bite. Nothing sweet on the start. Bitterness is strong in the mid-stream, without a hop note. Finishes with a more mild coffee bite which lightens the more its on the tongue, resulting in an interesting chocolate aftertaste.  M - Moderate body - not as thick as I would have thought from the appearance. Is very clinging, oily, coating on the tongue. Leaves behind a well defined resin.  D - A one time beer to say the least. Almost like I'm drinking coffee, with alcohol. Flavors are awfully direct, and the abv is a bit over the top.

The taste is strong and a big mouthful. You taste it all over your mouth and throat as you swallow. It tastes very bitter and my biggest thought is cold coffee the whole time.

Black as night. A trace of head. No lacing. The aroma is wonderful. Dark chocolate and coffee. So spot on with those two scents it's freaky. The flavor is intense smoked malt with chocolate coffee. It's like a mocha malt was melted and put in a bottle. Obviously this full bodied and robust. It's like a meal in a glass. Breakfast to be exact.... wait maybe that's why they call it... oh you know.

Head retention is above average and lacing is good  Smell is of bittersweet chocolate and fresh coffee grounds. The coffee and chocolate really overpower anything else in this beer. Hops and alcohol aren't detected at all, this smells like desert!  Taste is pretty similar to smell, first there is the bitter chocolate, then the bitter cold coffee taste is there. Hops are also present in the after taste, not like IPA hoppy, but just that bitterness of IBUs  Mouth feel is good, carbonation is well balanced. Body isnt as thick and rich as I was hoping for. Thats about the only downside I see to this beer. There isnt that thick creamy head I love from Imperial Stouts. It goes down pretty smooth though.  Drink ability is good. The 8.3 ABV is barely detected and this beer isnt really session able but I could easily go through 2 of these at a time. Bitterness from coffee and chocolate was definitely the main flavor in this beer and I didnt mind it one bit.

S - the smell was kind of all over the place - there is a lot going on in it. Dark, roasted malts, a boat load of burnt malts/coffee, dark fruits, chocolate, and booze.  T - Taste of dark chocolates, which were followed by burnt malt that dominates the palate on the finish and leaves a lingering coffee taste. Usually stouts can get kind of watery throughout its taste - this was full of flavor and very interesting throughout.  M - decently full and smooth. The high abv is very well-masked. I smelt the booze but didn't taste it.  D - excellent stout. I have been wanting to try this for a while now and was glad that I finally got to try it.

At first the head is medium brown, almost toffee colored, but as it settles, it turns more of a beige color. The head, while unspectacular to begin with, shrinks to a small ring around the outside of the glass. There is some sticky lacing leaving patterns on the glass.  The nose is very strong towards the coffee. Bakers chocolate and bitterness take a back seat to the Espresso in this one, and it's mouthwatering. Roasted malts and almost a chocolate milk like sweetness.  Coffee and earthy bitter hops. Bakers chocolate and malts. The alcohol isn't noticeable, but there is a friendly warming presence hidden amongst the intense flavors. This stuff is the consistency of chocolate milk, with the bitterness of iced coffee, and the velvety smoothness of a malt.  Creamy and smooth. Thats it. There is a slight bitter aftertaste, but other than that, I can't imagine it being more velvety smooth and creamy. Drinkability is excellent.  Definitely deserving of the spot in the Top 100.

This stout lived up to its ""breakfast"" moniker, with robust and sweet flavors of coffee and chocolate. The initial taste and feel is intense and crisp, laced with bitter hops and a hint of sweetness. This almost immediately gives way to a softer, more velvety feel, with huge flavors of chocolate. The warm aftertaste of chocolate and coffee makes this beer exceptionally drinkable, although it is definitely a sipping beer.

This beer poured an opaque black color with a thick, frothy, dark tan head. Great head retention with tons of thick sticky lacng that coated the glass. The coffee nose on this is far more intense on tap than in the bottle, some bitter chocolate and roasted malt notes dance in the background but it's all about the coffee with this one. The first go 'round I rated this beer as a 5 on the taste and having it on tap only solidifies the 5 stance. Insane coffee flavoring. It's prominent and in your face but not over the top. Roasted malt flavoring evens it out a bit in the middle and and creamy flavoring mixed with a deep bitter chocolate round this out at the end. The flavor on this baby was really, really intense. I you like coffee, you'll love this! Even though roasted coffee was the main flavor there was good balance here. I noticed some malts and some cream flavor and maybe some bittersweet chocolate in the finish. This is a full bodied, low carbonation, rich, silky and creamy body with a thick sticky finish to it. In this case, my 5 drinkability lends more to simply sitting and enjoying rather than sessionable. Though... in bottle form I've put a few back.

The aroma was rich and delicious, chocolate, pipe tobacco, roasted malt, molasses and alcohol. Totally on-point. The flavors were equally apropos to the style, lots of roasted malt and chocolate, both milk and dark along with some smoked notes and earth. The alcohol was surprisingly well-concealed yet the flavors still robust and rich - complex but dangerously drinkable! Oh my! The body was full, the carbonation perfect and the mouthfeel smooth.

1199,11757,taez555,4.12,"This beer poured a dark black body(somewhat coca cola-ish) with a small almost non existent head.  Nose is an extremely intense freshly cracked bitter coffee or espresso bean and extremely dark chocolate. Very faint touches of the oatmeal, but honestly this thing just screams coffee/chocolate without any sweetness at all. Dark and SUPER BITTER coffee or chocolate.  Taste is full bodied and immediately hits with the dark bitter chocolate and coffee flavors. It's strange because both the dark bitter unsweetened chocolate and extremely bitter espresso are equally present and yet sort of shuffle back and forth so you're never quite sure which one is the flavor you're experiencing at the moment. Bitterness isn't overly deadly, at least not when it comes to the hops. You can taste it's there, but it works perfectly in step with the bitter coffee and choclate flavors. Hop taste, again, it's there with some mild floral or even citrus notes, but for the most part it's just a compliment to the big burnt coffee. Ends with a beautiful long boot leather, coffee and dark unsweetened chocolate bitterness.  Founder's can't make a bad beer. I hate calling this a one trick pony. It's sooo coffee and unsweetened chocolate to the max, but... it works. I like the KBS a bit more, but this is damn good.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,kegger22,4.4,"Looks, pours and feels like used motor oil but in this case, its a good thing. Remember, this is breakfast and it is rich, rich, rich. The aroma is a good, strong coffee with a whiff of chocolate. The taste is coffee, but the chocolate becomes more prominent as an aftertaste on the back of the tongue. The feel is heavy, but hey, its a stout and it should. If you drank this all day, it would kill you, but you'd die happy.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,NittanyBeerFan,4.62,"I'll start by saying this...if you could drink this for breakfast every morning, you would never need to drink coffee again.  A: Pour is extremely smooth. The beer flows viscously in a creamy black stream. There is a thin layer of bubbles on top.  S: Smell has a ton going on in it. Coffee, dark chocolate, burnt malts, and some maple syrup/molasses that makes this 100% inviting.  T: Just like a Colombian dark roast. The molasses sits in the background and complements the roasted malts. There is a big coffee taste (obviously) to go with it. No sign of alcohol at all. I also make out some hazelnut-like notes in the finish.  M/D: Tingly light carbonation, extremely smooth finish. Great after dinner, where it replaced my coffee, and could be great in the morning with my bagel and eggs too. The aftertaste is better then that of my morning coffee. A great all-around beer. I could drink a few of these, even though it might take an hour or two...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,sweemzander,4.87,"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. No bottled date.  (A)- Pours thick, and black as night. Very little head formation, but had some serious light brown bubbles. Some lacing.  (S)- Lots of coffee and oatmeal! Combined with some sweet chocolate and molasses. Some bread nuances.  (T)- Super rich roasted malts. Tons of coffee within. Slight bread component from the oatmeal. Finalized by some cocoa.  (M)- Thick stuff in the mouth. Seriously roasted to the point of almost being bitter, yet the sweetness balances that out really well! Good carbonation level. Where is the 8.3% abv? Pretty damn smooth if you ask me! Incredible balance!  (D)- If I could get away with drinking this at breakfast every morning, I would ! It really reminds me of that early morning cup of coffee with some well-done toast spread with milk chocolate ! A sipper, yet an incredibly enjoyable one at that. If you let this get up to almost room temperature, it only gets better!

1199,11757,dude,4,"Thanks to my brother Brian for the surprise. I have been craving this one for a while. Plus I got to enjoy it during a phils game with a 1st inning grand slam! This pours like old motor oil, opaque and brown to black in color. No head formation and not much in the way of carbonation noted. Aroma is of coffee, some chocolate and a porterish bitter roasted maltiness. Taste is bitter sweet, chocolate, vinous fruit and tasty alcohol. Mouthfeel is syrupy, disappointing I guess as it was the only below average characteristic. Drinkability is good for double stout standards, whatever the hell that means.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,briman,4.42,"Pours very dark brown, essentially black, opaque, with a moderate dark brown head that retains well.  Aroma is moderate to strong ground coffee, with some dark chocolate lingering in the background.  Flavor falls right in line with the aroma, ground coffee, dark chocolate, with a roasty finish. Bitterness characteristic of what you might get after eating a square of premium dark chocolate fills the aftertaste.  Medium-full body, moderate carbonation. Slightly thick, a bit chewy. Alcohol evident only in the warming, as it is very well hidden in the aroma and taste. I think this is an outstanding beer, but can't help wondering what it would be like if it were a touch fuller in terms of body. Certainly one you want to drink again and again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,bfields4,4.57,Deep dark chocolate with a thin tight beautiful mocha head.  Dark bitter sweet chocolate malts rule the smell. A nice roasted coffee eske smell to boot.  Bould breakfast espresso tastes fade into a beautiful bitter velvet chocolate so smooth and well balanced nothing too overpowering.  as stated above a nice velvety smooth light carbonation.

1199,11757,0110x011,4.19,"Got this in a trade from... Somebody. Thanks!  A - Opaque black with dark brown edges. Tight, half finger brown head has medium retention, leaving a thin collar. Not much in the way of lacing.  S - The expected coffee rush hits first. Big, huge coffee aromas. Honestly smells more like coffee than beer. But in a good way. Some chocolatey and licorice aromas break it up.  T - Equally coffee-soaked, with the same chocolate and licorice background. Some plummy fruit flavors in there too.  M - On the softer side, but too prickly to be higher than a 4.  D - Very high. One of the most drinkable coffee stouts I've had.  Solid for sure, but lacking somewhat in depth. Perhaps if I had it a bit fresher, I'd get more complexity out of the coffee itself. But even without the depth I expected, it's still a fine beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Same for the taste. The taste has a nice balance between coffee bitterness and sweetness from the malt. The two strongest flavors are the coffee and the chocolate. Medium bodied, light carbonation, and very drinkable. I could drink this again and again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

This is absolutely the best stout I've tried yet.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Bubba83,4.97,"Huge thanks to Kegatron for trading me a bottle. Poured from a 12oz bottle at 50 degrees into a plain old snifter.  Poured it pretty darn quick in order to muster a 1 finger width medium tan head, composed of tiny bubbles. The head dissipates down to a thin ring rather quickly, and leaves some decent thin lacing along the sides of the glass. Once it settles to the thin ring of froth, it reminds me a lot of the froth on top of a freshly brewed shot of espresso. The beer itself is midnight black.  I get a lot of roasted barley in the nose, with some coffee and chocolate underneath. I also detect some faint tobacco, and a nutty quality that is hard to describe. There's some vanilla going on too, along with some toffee. Complex as hell and in your face.  Wow, where do I begin? The first thing I detect is toffee and vanilla, followed up quickly by a dry roastyness that is balanced out by a great coffee mid-range. Surprisingly, the chocolate shows up late to the party, and is prevelant mostly after the carbonation fades in your mouth just before the swallow, tastes a bit milk chocolate-like. I also get some tobacco leaf character at the swallow, along with other indescript leathery flavors.  Mouthfeel couldn't be better. It's everything I'm looking for: viscous, oily, smooth, vivacious, and is just the right thickness. Also has this kind of nice chewyness to it which is rare for a beer that isn't too thick.  Overall this is a masterpiece, and is one of the best beers I have ever had, if not the best beer I have ever had. I'm in absolute heaven. Really easy to enjoy, and the alcohol is kept in check which is awesome. I think I even dig this more than Peche Mortel, which is hard to believe coming from me.

I cooled it quickly after delivery. Very dark black body, milk chocolate enormous head.  Smell chocolatey with lots of oatmeal, very chocolatey, notes of coffee.  Tastes much the same. A lot of oatmeal in the taste. A fair amount of chocolate. Almost no coffee. Geeze the head is huge. Drinks rather well. Reminds me of Terrapins Wake 'n Bake. It also produces a spice that tingles on the tongue, which is so apparent in high-quality RISs. This is definitely worthy of the high marks.  Mouthfeel is perfectly milky, just like a stout should be.  Drinkabilty, for me is perfect. Not too alcoholic (8.3%), and easy to drink, smooth taste.

1199,11757,Soonami,4.72,"From a bottle I saved from this past winter that I shared with a friend.  The stout poured the archetypal pitch black with a sandy-brown layer of thin foam. The luscious scent hit me as I was pouring from the bottle! I could immediately smell everything that went into the beer, the oats, the rich chocolate, and the sweet distinct aroma of steeping coffee. On the palate, it was very creamy with tastes of burnt breakfast cereal, thick chocolate and the bitterness of coffee to finish. It tasted like cheerios, mixed with chocolate milk, with a cup of strong Italian roasted coffee in a pint glass. My mouth was exploding with flavor as the beer coated and clung every square inch of my mouth.

This stout really isn't too fruity its pure coffee and chocolate. Very good. Finish lasts forever and is pretty dry.  The mouthfeel to me is medium for a stout, and maybe I expected a fuller body.

1199,11757,DavoleBomb,4.09,"Poured into a snifter. 2008 vintage (I think).  4.0 A: Pitch black color. Agressive pour gave me one finger of dark tan head that fell quickly, but left a good ring of lacing.  4.5 S: Awesome aroma. Coffee dominates and I'm perfectly fine with that. The coffee meshes well with sweet milk chocolate and roasted barley.  4.5 T: This starts out like a very tasty espresso. Then it quickly transforms into a beer with espresso. Bitter espresso, bittersweet chocolate, and roasted barley. Healthy bitterness comes from the coffee and hops.  4.0 M: Heavy medium body. Good carbonation. Very creamy.  5.0 D: I could drink a whole 4-pack of these and still want more.  ***Re-Review from early 2011***  Since having many, many wonderful beers since my initial review of this beer, I have discovered this really isn't as wonderful as I once thought (or perhaps the beer itself isn't as good as it once was).

1199,11757,semihobo,4.22,"12 oz, bought in MI in March so probably the most recent batch. $3.99 for a single, whoa.  Pours a very thick sludgy dark brown, like motor oil. For all of the times I've said a stout was totally opaque black, I repent -- you could tell this was on another level of darkness as it left the bottle. Except for a tiny ring, no head at all.  Smells of rich, not-bitter coffee, hickory smoke, grass, double chocolate brownies. No off smells, no alcohol.  Mmm, dark chocolate coffee! Taste is exceptionally smooth, nice balance of roast / bitterness / medium sweetness. Serious dark chocolate and coffee here, to the point that you might be able to pass this one off as coffee if it went flat and you microwaved it... now I understand the name.  Soft, heavy mouthfeel. Just like how I put milk in my coffee, I'd like to take the edge off this finish, it is just a little too bitter.  Tasty, especially as a coffee lover, although by the end it was too much. Still, an entirely pleasant and welcome example of the style.  Note: I couldn't resist and tried pouring some vanilla soy milk into the last few sips... didn't really achieve the desired effect, sadly.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,lpayette,3.54,"Appearance- Pours jet black with about 3/4 a finger worth of head. Some lacing.  Smell- Intensely smokey/roasted to the point where it's almost overwhelming. Very dark and very rich chocolate similar to devil's foodcake. Strong, black coffee.  Taste- Intense roasted malts that are very rich, strong, and smokey. Sweetness is balanced by coffee bitterness first, followed by hop bitterness. Oatmeal shows up around mid sip but is mostly covered up by the other huge flavors going on. The finish is wood-like and a bit dry.  Mouthfeel- Thick yes, but not as thick as I was expecting based on the smell and taste. Low carbonation level works for this style.  Drinkability/Conclusion- I'm a little surprised that this one ranks as high as it does. That's not to say that this isn't good beer... it is. I just don't think it's ""A-worthy."" The balance for me is a bit off and the coffee too intense. About mid-bottle it hit me that this tastes nearly EXACTLY like one of my homebrews (muck and mire version #2, batch #12). I've still got a bunch of it because I just don't care for it too much. It hits the spot once in a while, but for the most part it's just not what I would normally go for.

No head either, just a tiny bit of tan potential. Perfect score.  S: Roasted malts, espresso, coffee, toffee, molasses, caramel, and hops!! Glad to see such a nice stout with a whole bunch of hops. Also, bitter-sweet chocolate is present and quite upfront  T: Roasted coffee beans, roasted malts, espresso, molasses, hops! Very nicely balanced (although the roastedness is definitely the strong arm here)...truly remarkable...the chocolate and coffee/espresso combination is amazing.

Aroma is very ester fruity from the malts. Dark cherries and chocolate with a bit of coffee.  Taste is sweet and fruity with hints of cocoa. Coffee comes out a bit more here than in the nose. Little bits of burnt notes.  Body is full and round but not as thick as the KBS or as I'd prefer. Acrid coffee on the tongue lasts a while giving this a pretty long finish.

Smell: Had a chocolate aroma with some coffee in the background.  Taste: The smell of coffee in the background really comes to the forefront in the taste. The chocolate is able to hold its own as well. It almost tasted like a carbonated mocha.  Mouthfeel: Very thick and rich. Quite robust.  Drinkability: Now, don't get me wrong...based on the taste alone, I could drink this beer non-stop. However, I found it to be so filling that I don't think I could drink more than two (or at most three) in one sitting.

1199,11757,originalsin,4.5,"Thanks to shuajw for another really great beer!  A: This beer pours almost jet black- opaque, with a nice tan head that formed very slowly. It was nice to watch.  S: It smells heavily of chocolate and flaked oats- it smells goood for a stout, that's all I can really say here. Maybe a little bit more subdued than I'd like but it's quite nice, really.  T: I've been drinking this over the past ten minutes or so and one thing I'll make note of- the alcohol notes in this brew start to come through as it warms. Those alcohol flavors only materialize as an afterthought, so they're very bearable and provide some depth here. The flavors that really show with this one are an amazing bittersweet chocolate flavor the I'm falling in love with and some notes of coffee and flaked oats.  M&D: The mouthfeel is a somewhat light for what I'm used to with stouts but I'm really loving it. It's lightly carbonated and, as a result, goes down very easily- drinkability is just about perfect. I may crack open the second bottle when I wake up in the morning (that's really not going to happen as I have to crawl out of bed into the shower and to the car lately but if I were half the morning person I used to be I might...). I'm really looking forward to getting myself on the Canadian and Kentucky Breakfast Stouts--from what I've heard they're a whole lot better than this one and isn't that exciting.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Shaon94,4.38,"Appearance Outstanding Appearance, Jet Black with Amber head about 1-2 fingers thick. Sticky lacing left behind throughout session.  Smell - Initial is coffee / toffee with a hint of spice. As it warmed the smell just kept getting better. Finally after about 30 minutes it leveled off with a nice coffee with a hint of liquor smell. The spices were more prominent when it warmed as well. This is a good smelling beer!  Taste - Coffee, roasted Oats, and just a hint of a alcohol in the back end to give it a nice warming flavor. As it warms the carbonation really brings out the alcohol flavor more. It brings out more flavors, now I am not tasting the oats anymore and it is giving way to a creamy, but dark, chocolate. All in all a great tasting beer. I like the hint of alcohol in this one. Much better than beers that just dump it in to increase the ABV.  Mouthfeel - Carbonation is more than I would like for a stout, but for some reason it works with the tastes in this beer. I usually server beer cool, and let the room naturally warm it as I drink. This beer has a better mouthfeel cool than warm. The warmer it gets the more the carbonation is released it seems, So I would recommend drinking this one cold / cool if you are not a fan of the carbonation. While cool it coats well, as a stout should, but warmer the carbonation takes over and does not do so well for me, but I am far from disappointed. Slight warming as you drink it down.  Drinkability - Kind of a strong beer, but definitely could have a couple of these in a sitting. There are some better stouts in general out there, but this one is a good one, and is something I like to keep on hand.

Excellent aroma--bold, complex, rich.  T&M: Explosive and complex flavors of dark chocolate, coffee, some light citrusy hop flavor to keep things interesting. There's a slightly dry cereal flavor from the oats, as well. Body is full and the feel is incredibly creamy and velvety. If it was a tad bigger it'd merit a 5, but still no complaints here. Well done, a delicious beer.  D: Very drinkable for such a big stout. I've taken this one down rather quickly.

Head took about 4 minutes to dissipate, leaving some nice lacing on the glass. Very frothy for any type of beer, but especially a stout.  S- Smelled like a cup of black coffee. Was hard to detect any chocolate in the head, likely due to the very strong coffee aroma.  T- Of all the stouts I have had, this was the best tasting to me. Chocolate covered coffee beans. Very rich, but definitely lacking that smokey, woody flavor that many stouts have (speedway). I liked the sweet, but not smokey flavor. However, some stout lovers might miss the true smokey flavor typical of stouts.  M-Mouthfeel was incredible. The oatmeal stout characteristics really came through, making it velvety smooth and creamy  D- I could drink this all day.

Coffee, coffee, and more coffee. Roasted malts, and some chocolate pierce through the strong coffee taste as well. Mouthfeel is thick and full. Great beer.

A- Pours a jet black motor oil style body with a creamy coffee colored foam head that leaves some good lacing.  S- Wow...this is one of the best/most aromatic coffee noses that I have ever come across. Roasted coffee (java or mocha?) and sweet chocolate scents completely dominate the nose. A light toasted malt and oatmeal can be detected as well. I could sit here smelling this all day. I wonder if Founders and Glade would team up to make a Breakfast Stout air freshener?  T- A huge rush of coffee taste initially with a roasted/burnt flavor of cocoa and bittersweet chocolate. A sweet malt backbone helps to balance the bitterness of the cocoa and coffee (definitely not a hoppy bitterness). Toasted flavors of grain and oatmeal are more apparent with warming. A fairly substantial alcohol presence can be detected as well.  M- Big and bold with a full body and velvety smooth feel. Medium/low carbonation but it works well with the style.  D- This is a palate smasher of a stout with tons of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors. The alcohol is fairly noticeable and turns this into a sipping beer. A fantastic brew that won't easily turn into a session.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Nice black coffee, the way it should be drank. As it sits for a while it becomes sweeter. The oatmeal makes a presence, not that is a bad thing by any means. Again, breakfast comes to mind.

1199,11757,DoubleJ,4.35,"Continuing the Third Unorganized Invitational is a beer I have longed for for a long time: Founders Breakfast Stout. It's not sold in SoCal, but I know a special store which carried a few bottles. And yes, I've going to have this beer with breakfast, so on to the beer:  It pours thick and black into a pint glass, where an espresso tanned head a 1/2 inch thick sits on top. Needless to say, the body is darker than night. The aroma is a good one, but very dominant in coffee. Lots of coffee with a little bit of chocolate and lactose.  This is damn tasty, it tastes like breakfast. Like the aroma, the taste is coffee dominantat first, but it slowly sweetened up, tasting like mocha. It certainly doesn't feel like it's advertised ABV of 8.3, pretty mellow if you ask me. Being a little light on the malt is the only thing that keeps this beer out of a higher score. The bitter coffee and chocolate linger long into the aftertaste.  This is a very good double coffee stout, but it's no Péché Mortel. Those who like coffee stouts will no doubt love Founders Breakfast Stout. Try it for breakfast like I am right now, trust me.  Anyway, that's another beer out of the queue in the T.U.I.

1199,11757,Casey10,4.35,"Aquired via trade from heliosphann. A strong beer with a lot of following so here is my review.  A - Dark with a tan head  S - Dark Chocolate, with dark chocolate coffe notes  T - Coffe dark, chocolate very good.  M - Low carbination, frothy chocalety  D - Very drinkable yet not dinkable as this is stong. Looking at the big picture if some one offered me one I would drink it !!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Jerico,4.38,"A - real real dark one here, no mistaking it. The head on my lightish pour isn't too large but it is dense and the carbonation leaves bubble marks on it that look like craters on the moon. I'm holding this one up to the light and there's not a whole lot coming through! It sticks nicely to the sides of the glass too.  S - a bit nutty, with that toast, mild coffee and chocolate smell that I love so much.  T/M/D - thick and dense after a few swirls around the gullet, with tastes of toasty and bitter chocolate and coffee (like biting a coffee bean or cocoa bit). It hides the alcohol well though. I can taste just a hint of oatmeal as the beer warms up a bit, but subtle.  After leaving the beer to sit for a few minutes and warm up, its character really comes out, and the subtle tastes become more noticeable yet the blend well, and the bitterness backs off a bit. A darn good beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,natelocc787,4.6,"Pours with a small one finger head.  Dark Brown, so dark that light cannot pass through it. The darkest brown can be before it becomes black. Very interesting, when the glass is tilted slowly back and forth, the bubbles cascade up and down the glass like shimmering gold dust. This beer is alive and unlike any other beer I have seen (appearance).  Nose is of roasted supreme coffee. It smells like a very complex coffee/chocolate stout. I can separately smell the oatmeal, chocolate, and coffee. Very powerful aroma. The kind that made me look weird because i continued to smell the beer before each sip.  Taste is of chocolate coffee, almonds, cocoa nibs, fudge and vanilla oatmeal. The oatmeal was a very nice touch and definitely helps complete the beer. Imagine a carbonated Triple Bock with Oatmeal and coffee at a 8.3 abv. No sediment of course.  Mouthfeel is silky-not chewy-hence the 4.5. (nitpicking a little) Bold bodied.  The alcohol isn't covered very well but I appreciate the way it comes together in the finish.  This came in the mail so it may not have been tasted under the best circumstances. Still gets high marks and even though i drank as a nightcap I can see how it would go well with a breakfast. Very tasty, complex and unique. Really everything I look for in a beer.  Highly recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,bulletrain76,4.3,"12oz bottle shared by photomike. Coffee stouts scare me because they can go so wrong depending on the quality of the coffee. This one definitely delivered. The darkest (almost) dark brown color with a small tan head. The aroma is a blast of coffee and dark chocolate, with some oats and roasted malt underneath, but mostly coffee goodness. Less sweet than many big stouts, with lots of coffee, light roasted malt, chocolate, and mild hops. Medium-full body with smooth texture. Nice balance of coffee and chocolate that isn't sticky or sweet. Very drinkable for an imperial stout. Great stuff.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The color alone looks evil that's so wonderful.  Aroma: Massive dark chocolate notes. Incredible dark roasted coffee and big wonderfully maltiness. The aromas from this beast attack the nostrils with lethal force.  Taste: The mouthfeel is remarkably silky. Huge dark roasted malts and dark roasted hops. The chocolate notes have a very big presence. The espreso and coffee flavors caress the palate so very well it's like a coating.  Notes: Wow what a stunning beer dark, sinister it's incredible.

1199,11757,BZero007,4.05,"Picked this beer up at the Piggly Wiggly at Common Market in Myrtle Beach, SC!! Great Store and will be back.  Poured from bottle in to my Portsmouth Tulip glass. The brew pours a motor oil black with no light penetrating the brew when held up to the light. The head is very minimal and I had to pour straight in to the glass and slap it around to get it. The aroma is good and carries strong coffe flavors with roast as well. The taste I had to say for me was mainly a roasted something flavor...I really could not put my finger on what it was. I could taste the Coffe easily and the sweet malt but to me there was something off a bit. Had this beer with my breakfast this morning and it complimented it very well. Drinkability was good for me as after breakfast I felt like I could keep drinking..evil. I enjoyed this brew but would probably pass on purchasing this in the future for my self.

1199,11757,ffejherb,4.97,"On tap at Capone's on 5/23/09. Served in a shaker pint.  A - Deep, dark coffee brown body with thick, one-finger burnt mocha head that retained fantastically and laced up extremely well.  S - Fresh ground coffee aroma with bittersweet chocolate notes. Some sweet caramel and toffee notes emerge eventually, as well as some subtle earthy hop notes. Simple yet effective, but one of the best coffee stout aromas ever.  T - Wonderful blend of fresh coffee, semi-sweet chocolate and subtle earthy hop notes that gain momentum as the liquid warmed up a bit. Alcohol is virtually undetectable.  M - Thick and luscious body with a smooth, creamy texture and subtle carbonation. Pretty assertive bitter finish with a touch of residual sweetness on the palate.  S - Possibly the best coffee stout out there. I can't imagine anything topping this phenominal beer. Breakfast Stout is definitely my benchmark for the style.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,ballewblake,4.15,"First beer in five weeks and I just got laid off so I decided to fall off the wagon for a day. Screw it.  Poured into your standard pint glass, viscus black body with a milk chocolate head that fades almost on pour. Lacing seems good initially, spores on the reminates of the faded head. Deep chocolate aromas, some coffee, just barely, defiantly a malt bomb. Chocolate attacks my starved tongue and rapes the pores, bringing this beer geeks lips to a smile. Great body and mouthfeel on this beer, it drinks well, almost like chocolate milk with a kick, hops are there, alcohol is too, but not in your face. Balanced well for the imp stout style.

1199,11757,mjl21,4.17,"Acquired via trade...thanks Josh! 12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter. No bottling info is given. Comes in at 8.3%.  A-Light sucking black with a one finger sandy head that receeds to a ring and an island of sandy foam. Nice streaks of lace are left on the glass.  S-Coffee, as expected, dominates. This one wins the prize as having the most coffee aroma out of all of the coffee stuts that I have tried. Roasted malt is definitely noticeable and as it warms a tad bit of sweet malt is also present. The oats used are noticeable towards the end of the glass.  T-Coffee is very upfront, along with the roasted malt, and dark chocolate. There is a nice level of hop bitterness that is detected.  M-Medium bodied and not as thick as I expected. It is creamy and smooth. It leaves a dry and roasty feel on the palate.  D-The higher abv is very well hidden. It is very drinkable for a big guy.  As someone who drinks way too much Peet's coffee everyday, I really enjoyed this one. They delivered on the promise of coffee.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Kadonny,4.32,"Poured from tap at Capones in Norristown into a tulip glass.  A: A jet black color with no light showing through. Minimal head on the tap pour and minimal glass lacing.  S: Coffee, dark coffee with chocolate and roasty flavors. Some mild sweetness.  T: More of the nose. Dark coffee flavors, sometimes tasting almost burnt, or burnt chars of wood. A nice creamy chocolate flavor stands up next to the coffee with roasted flavors. A bit of sweet fruits, maybe dark cherries with some sweetness. A bit of hops at the finish leads to a creamy but slightly bitter finish. Very nice.  M: Creamy smooth with a bit of alcohol detected.  D: Good, they go down easily for the abv. Still, you can't pound these all ngiht, but one or two is perfect.  Overall another great beer from Founders. This is not up to par with KBS, but what other stout really is? Not many.

1199,11757,PhxHorn,3.72,"Thanks to jwc215 for this one. Always nice to receive a Founders. This one pours a dark brown with a minimal head. I practically dumped the last half of the bottle and was able to generate a quarter-inch head. It smells mildly of coffee and chocolate, and tastes mildly of coffee, chocolate, a bit of roast, and not much more than a hint of oatmeal. The flavors are surprisingly mild for a stout, though they are a nicely balanced mix. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout--this one actually reminds me of Deschutes Black Butte porter. Very drinkable and well worth trying, but not as impressive as some of the other Founders beers.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Gmann,4.32,"Pours a black color, with a dense chocolate milk looking head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of mocha, moderate coffee and milk chocolate, some charred wood and hints of smoke. Big roasted malt flavor, bitter chocolate and strong coffee, some wet wood and smoke, a bit ashy, as well as some vinous flavors. The feel is starts off chewy but seems to get lighter towards the end, seems to tail off. Soft carbonation leads to a creamy feel; finishes bitter.

(unless mom and dad are supervising and cultivating a young craft beer palate)  Nice stout poor, brown head, nice carbonation, pretty dark. Looks like I want/expect it to look.  Smell is coffee and bitter chocolate. Some roasted character too.  Taste is coffee up front, some more toasted stout flavors follow. Creamy feel, not syrupy. not that sweet. Good balance, typical stout roast, with coffee and bitter chocolate dominating. Maybe could have been a little thicker. Tried to find some sweetness, dark fruits, leather/tobacco, spice, etc, but didn't find much. Which is ultimately OK in this coffee dominated tasty beverage.

Smell is full of coffee and oaky bourbon flavors. Slight hop pressence at the end that helps lighten the coffee notes. Some chocolate hints as well.  Taste smooth with chocolate mixed with mocha coffe and roasted malts. Tart bitterness at the end but mostly from the roasted malt and coffee and so much hops.  Mouthfeel is smooth an dcreamy. There's a little bite at the end if not savored.  Good to store and good for any malt crazy person. Not very everyone.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Taste: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, sweet roasted marshmallow, bitter burnt toast, with a nice malty flavor afterwards.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, nice amount of carbonation, leaves mouth dry.  Overall: Good drinkability, nice roasted flavors, very good basic stout! Nothing too exciting, but just what I want in a stout.

It pours a thick viscous black with little to no head and very slight carbonation.  The first taste is an explosion of rich coffee and caramel, followed after a brief swirl around the mouth by more subtle chocolate with a hint of vanilla.

There's mountainous retention and beautiful lacing.  S: Sweet malt on the pour. Roasted coffee and dark (bitter) cacao. Dark fruit malts and berry esters are also in the game.  T/M: Everything I expected from the aromas. I've heard a lot about this beer being huge on coffee, but it definitely has a great balance that holds its own against other big RIS names. Dark chocolate alternates with sweet milk chocolate. Carbonation bordering on crisp brings out spicy characteristics in the beer. There's something dark and interesting in the back of the aroma and flavor but I can't quite name it. Medium-bodied (one of the thinner imperial stouts I've had), but still great complexities and subtleties. The oatmeal also really comes out with warmth. The last sip ends in bitter chocolate oatmeal. It really holds up 'til the very end!  D: This is easily one of the best beers I've ever had. Dangerously drinkable.

1199,11757,Gosox8787,4.7,"As this is one of the best reviewed beers on BA, I did not hesitate at all to buy it when I saw it at the package store. Bottle came as part of a four pack and was reasonably priced, considering how hyped it is. Onto the beer.  Poured from the bottle into a glass with a dark brown, one finger head that quickly settles into a nice lacing. Lacing coats the glass for a few seconds after each sip. The aroma is strong with notes of sweet bourbon, vanilla, expresso, and chocolate all balancing quite well. The flavor is also exceptionally balanced. Sweet bourbon notes begin each sip and slow transition into a nice smokey, roasted flavor from the malts. Vanilla, chocolate and coffee/expresso notes all become apparent as well. The oatmeal does a really good job at offering a sweetness that this beer needs. Completely balanced flavor. The mouthfeel is thick. The first couple sips leave a dry, sticky mouthfeel that subsides soon after. The drinkability is good for this heavy a stout with this high an ABV. Actually makes you want more rather than getting bored of the flavor.  Overall, just a great stout with loads of flavor that is nicely balanced throughout the brew. A great start to the day if you so choose, but good at anytime. Just an enjoyable beer in every way. And a good value to boot.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ryrust5301,4.8,"Appearance - Black as night and almost looks like a cup of pure black coffee. Ever so thin layer of coco powder colored head shot up after pouring, but settled into a tan almost glowing ring.  Smell - So gentle and caressing that it's hard to believe. Coffee notes are so soft yet so bold, and it's all mixed together with a pinch of swirled vanilla. A brush of chocolate is dropped in to sweeten things up.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Oh my goodness, this tastes like a cup of coffee in beer form. The only thing that makes it different is that instead of the bitterness that overwhelms each sip of coffee, a sweet chocolate and vanilla flavor is there to take the edge off. This beer is blended to perfection. The aftertaste bursts with coffee bitter until it fades away. Not thick and big, but soft and gliding in the feel. The sweet creamy taste just helps it slide down the tongue. Unlike most big stouts the burn from the alcohol is nowhere to be found, and makes it dangerously drinkable.  Drinkability - I like this one even more than the KBS. Sublime to drink and maybe my favorite big stout out there.

O so smooth and velvety, full bodied. A deep roasted coffee flavor with a nice bite. Waves of bittersweet chocolate are interspersed with the coffee. Smokey, dark and bitter without being overly astringent; that is the beauty of this beer.  It closes out smooth, with a ghost hint of hops and an alcohol warming.  A quality brew to say the least.

1199,11757,MusicaleMike,3.83,"Here we have Founder's Breakfast Stout. It comes in these stubby 12 oz. bottles with a label portraying an equally stubby child scarfing down breakfast in some Rockwell-like painting. The beer is pegged as a ""double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout."" What a mouthful!  I turn up some Aphex Twin and pour my beer into a Founder's pint glass, noticing the very dark brown liquid as the bottle empties. The head takes a few seconds to settle down, finally culminating in a tight, two fingers worth of mocha-colored head sitting on a black stout body. The head surprisingly drops to a thing lace rather quickly, though it looks like it will be leaving a fine lace. Alas, by the end of the glass, there is very little trace of a head anywhere.  The strongest point of this beer, in my opinion, is the bouquet. ""Huge"" is one word to describe it. Immediately, there is coffee. It is very obvious and it stands out among the other aromas. But this smell is no ordinary coffee bean. We are talking about the aroma of a deeply roasted, rich and earthy coffee bean from Kona! I find it pleasant, while I can see this turning a lot of people off. Not surprisingly, under that aroma is a substantial dark chocolate smell, with the whole acrid 70% cacao thing going on for it. Semi-sweet raisin is there tucked underneath all this; and while I myself cannot pick out an ""oatmeal"" aroma per se, I would say that the smell is quite reminiscent of Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout, with an injection of coffee and chocolate. So I guess what I am saying is that this smells EXACTLY like a double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout!  The flavor profile is again dominated by coffee. This isn't Folgers coffee. This is serious coffee that is full-bodied and rich. Earthy and acidic. Oily mouthfeel. There are slight hop flavors, seen largely in the aftertaste. Occasionally, I thought I could taste sweet notes of chocolate, but now I think I may have been fooling myself. This is coffee beer, folks! If you don't like coffee, stay the hell away. I do like coffee personally, but I also wish that they would pull back on the coffee addition so that the chocolate and hops could shine through a bit more.  The carbonation is fairly intense and the mouthfeel is definitely full-bodied. It is almost to the point of being syrupy, but the sharp carbonation keeps it all in check. I harp here though because I think this beer is missing that signature oatmeal smoothness.  With all that being said, I think the drinkability factor is pretty piss poor. I would definitely have this again, and I think it would make for a good after dinner drink, you know, instead of coffee. But for breakfast? I dunno...I wanted to try, but I couldn't bring myself to do it ever. Also, I don't think this is much of a beer to drink multiple of in one sitting. Hence the low ""drink"" marks. Definitely worth a shot though if you see it around.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,BronYrAur,4.28,"A. Pitch black, not even a sign of any highlights around the edges. A dark tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves some nice rings around the edges. The perfect look?  S. Wow, this is the most coffee and chocolate I think I've ever smelled in a beer. The mocha scent is deep and very rich.  T. Unbelievably, this may be the weak point of this beer. It is labeled as an oatmeal stout but I'm not sure I get that. The bittersweetness of good oatmeal stouts like St. Ambroise, Barney Flats, and Sam Smith's is absent. It still tastes great, but just not quite like a proper oatmeal stout. Perhaps it's the absence of this that makes me slightly disappointed in the flavor. Still, this is a very nice tasting brew. Initially the mocha/chocolate flavors dominate. Very rich, dark, and quite good. The finish is marked by a drying bitterness that is much more reminiscent of the coffee than beer. Add that to the fact that the high alcohol content(8.3%) is hidden better than any other beer I've tasted of this strength and you really do have a fantastic ""breakfast stout.""  M. Thick, chewy, and almost devoid of carbonation. Not quite as creamy as I would've liked.  D. As mentioned, for such a strong beer in terms of alcohol, it is amazingly drinkable. I mean, I can't even perceive it. The roasted bitterness is also restrained just enough that it doesn't take a toll on your taste buds. Quite amazing to see a beer like this that is so drinkable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Liverpool08,4.65,"WOW! AMAZING! This is a truly great stout. Pours a super dark chocolate black with a light chocolate colored head that sits there all the way thru the drinking experience. Smells of rich mocha. Its aroma gives off a breakfast vibe, coffee, with a hint of chocolate and cream. The taste is even better. Rich and chewy coffee and chocolate flavors. Incredibly smooth, with a lovely coating in the mouth. This could be a breakfast as well as a dessert! Two or three of these would be the perfect way to end an evening.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,pokesbeerdude,4.4,"Extra special thanks goes out to DoctorDog for this one in a trade. I've been really excited for this beer for a long time, the only thing I'm more excited for is the KBS! Oh man...but that's gonna wait!  12oz Single  A: Thick and black, no light penetrates this one, sadly not a whole lot of head, but what did show up is dark tan, almost brown. A few spots of lacing when I swirl it. Spot on for the style.  S: Chocolate, like Hershey's syrup, milk, and a definite coffee presence, almost like having a cup of coffee in my hands, huge roasted malts, HUGE, some black patent smell in there too, but not overbearing, as its warming a little more I'm getting some boozey notes as well. Excellent!  T: Wow, coffee, big time, yeah, this is a breakfast stout if ever there was one, huge coffee flavor, very dark roasted coffee, definite coffee lingering bitterness, I don't think I can pick a true hop character out. Chocolate flavors are really strong in here too, nice dark chocolate character, it pairs quite nicely with the coffee. A faint hint of booze at the end. This is really something special. Excellent.  M: Nice thickness, velvety smoothness, surprisingly not a lot of alcohol heat at over 8%. Really a smooth sipper. Wow. Quite nice.  D: Too easy to drink for the style, a little on the sweet/rich side for me to be able to crack open another one though. This has made an excellent dessert. If I could get away with drinking one of these and going to work, I most definitely would. Really an excellent beer.  Thanks Ben!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,thirdeye11,4.6,"Thanks to Ktown67 for two of these bottles during an in person trade.  Presentation: Poured from 12oz bottle into Duvel tulip glass.  A: Pours a very dark brown color that is mostly opaque, but lets some light through. There is no head whatsoever even with a vigorous pour; the exception is just a layer of bubbles on top that dissipates quickly. Lacing on the glass is awesome.  S: When cold there isn't much here but coffee. As it warms though it's fairly complex. Coffee, dark chocolate, unsweetened cocoa, and at the very last of my glass as it's warmed toffee comes through. This is really nice.  T: I can't believe how good this is. I should state that I am not a stout drinker. In fact I've never bought one for myself to have in the fridge. I've drank many at beer tastings, but this beer tastes phenomenal. The coffee is right there and up front, but it's like any good coffee. Smooth as silk, dark chocolate without any bitterness, and there is absolutely no lingering bitterness I typically associate with stouts. This beer is perfection among all I've tried in the style. I have zero complaints. It's just that good. And may I state again it's so smooth, like a great cup of coffee! I think this is best beer I've drank that would make a good ice cream float. Never cloying either. Just right.  M: Absolute perfection. Carbonation is nice and not overbearing which it shouldn't be in a stout. Coats the mouth, but not heavy or thick at all. Creamy as well. I don't think this could be improved.  D: I wanted another one, but since I only have two I'm saving it for another night. I REALLY wanted to drink the second one though. I could have 2, 3, 4 of these? Who knows. It's insanely drinkable. No hints of alcohol whatsoever.  Being that I'm not a stout drinker and typically avoid them, I want to state that ANYONE who likes beer (stout drinker or not) should absolutely seek out a 4 pack of this beer. It's phenomenal.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Ragingbull,3.85,"I was at the point of inputting my 100th review on this site and decided it would be appropriate to seek out a special beer, i.e. one that is rated very high on this site. So, here it goes.  This beer pours a dark black color and looks almost like motor oil being poured from the bottle to the glass. The head is foamy and tan but doesn't completely cover the surface. Mild coffee and slightly smoky roasted malt mose. Perhaps a touch of oatmeal on the nose. Thick mouthfeel follows a mostly creamy initial attack. The flavor starts off clean and straightforward and the most noteworty feature at first blush is the creaminess. It seems to be a little bit ""boozy."" As it lingers in the mouth the roasted flavors start to come out towards the finish and the aftertaste. I can pick up chocolate very late and probably in fact in the aftertaste. The coffee flavors carry the day late in the flavor for sure. It actually causes me to flip back in my beer notes to a beer that I had a couple months ago from Flat Earth Brewing in Saint Paul, MN called Black Helicopter Coffee stout. I think that I had really hyped this beer up in my mind because of its reputation on this site, and its tough to live up to that much hype. Its good, but I have had stouts that I have enjoyed more. I actually thought it drank more like a porter. My wife and I had this together and she seemed to enjoy it more than I did. I just think it was the hype. Definitely a good beer and worth everyone giving it a try. I don't want to be too glum.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,DarbyOGill,4.35,"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  A: Pours very dark brown like coffee with about one finger of brown head. The lacing is really nice.  S: Strong notes of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt come through.  T: Wow, this is certainly different. Starts with a mixed taste of chocolate and chocolate, like a mocha latte. A slight flavor of alcohol hits the palette next, followed by a taste of roasted malt. The malt flavor is followed by some bitterness, not from hops, but of the coffee. It finishes very similarly to a cup of joe, it shares the same aftertaste as coffee, except the stout finishes with a bit of booze as well. I was kinda surprised how much coffee flavor was in this beer, it's almost as if I got it at Starbucks and ordered a stout latte (which would actually give me a reason to go to Starbucks).  D: As with all stouts of this type. I could maybe drink two before I'd have to move to something lighter.

1199,11757,Buschyfor3,4.57,"1000th Review for this beer... awesome!  Poured a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Seeing the kid eating oatmeal on the label is making me laugh, cause the guy at the liquor store thought the kid looked like the ""gerber baby"" so he kept calling it ""that baby beer."" If only...  A: Poured a jet black into my glass, sluggish, sloshing into the bottom. When you hold it up to the light you only get the faintest bit of a deep ruby color along the edges, otherwise, this beer is completely opaque. When the light reflects off the surface of the beer, it really does resemble motor oil or sludge.... Thick! Absolutely no head... not even a tease of a tan bubbles across the top. Slight lacing down the sides of the glass  S: Massive roasted coffee aromas fire the opening salvo on the nose - that of the deep, dark roast variety; through the rush of heavy roast, smoke and charred notes comes a fleeting moment of sweetness - I'm convinced it is vanilla; I'm also detecting an underlying sweetness akin to dark, bittersweet chocolate, as it tries to temper the huge roasted blast on the nose. Otherwise, this stout is as close to a warm mug of black coffee as that profile dominates from the outset.  T: Much like the nose, huge roasted notes right out of the gate; the bite from a heavy roast coffee bean flavor is front and center, followed by a rush of bittersweet baker's chocolate to lend some supporting sweetness. Mid sip the complexities kick into overdrive: the oats coming through provide a slightly sweet, creaminess that weaves into a charred/smoky flavor, like lingering cigar smoke; then there is a hint of dark fruit - like chocolate-covered cherries. A secondary wave of residual coffee bitterness rides long through the finish, which is slightly dry and gradually warming... obviously the alcohol is quickly making its presence known.  M: Full bodied. This beer has a low, but nicely measured, carbonation which leaves a slightly prickly sensation across the tongue - just enough to cut through the oily weight on the palate. Perhaps a bit chewy, but not nearly as thick as other imperial stouts I have tried.  D: At 8.3%, this beer does have some kick to it - a warming sensation without feeling overly boozy. The waves of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors try to hold off the alcohol as long as they can, but it slowly creeps in near the end of the glass to remind you that this is an imperial stout after all. Drinkability is quite nice for 8%+ ABV stout, but I think this is best enjoyed as a sipper. Top shelf this stout, one that deserves its praise and one I would definitely seek out again, even if a tad pricier than some competitors ($12+ for 4).",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,DannyS,4.42,"Acquired in my first trade, with theghost3. Served at cellar temp in a tulip glass, poured from a 12 oz. bottle.  A - A deep, powerful black with a thin, quick dissipating dark brown head. Leaves a decent bit of lacing.  S - Lots of fresh roasted coffee and chocolate with a backing of sweet & bitter toffee.  T - Less intense than I expected, but still nicely flavored. Once again, the coffee and chocolate are upfront in all their oily, dark glory. Tastes like more of the bitterness comes from the coffee, little hops on the aftertaste. The oatmeal seems to keep things balanced, with a nice hint of sweetness on the finish.  M - Surprisingly mild on body, with the fairly heavy weight and active carbonation balancing it to slightly syrupy with a smooth feel.  D - The 8% ABV is hidden well and the bitterness is no more rough on the palate than a cup of good, dark coffee. Could definitely have another of these if I had more; would be great for a Sunday breakfast or brunch.  Overall - I wanted to try this one before I went full bore and asked around for the big brother, KBS. I definitely enjoyed this brew though.

T--Tastes exactly like coffee that has been sitting cold in the pot for 8 hours. And I hate coffee. But you want to know what is weird? I love this beer. I love this style. It might be my favorite style. How can a guy who hates coffee love coffee beer so much, especially a beer that tastes like stale coffee? Its like I have the twilight zone of taste buds. Maybe I actually do like coffee but just haven't had a brand that I like yet. Perhaps I am akin to someone who says they hate beer but have only tried macro lagers. Who knows. This is great though, the only thing keeping it from a 5 is the one dimensional flavor. A great one dimension.  M--Medium to heavy bodied, absolutely delicious balance of creaminess and carbonation.

That's all I could think about because of the huge coffee notes that come through along with hints of bitter dark chocolate and some malty bready flavours in the background. It also has a hint of sweetness, like lactose or something. The beer is black as pitch, with a centimeter brown/tan head that dissipate rather quickly. I wanted it to stay around longer because it looked so god damned beautiful. So remember how I said wow when I smelled it? Well, fuck, it's just as much as a wow for the flavour. When I took a sip, there were loads and loads of flavours that jumped into my mouth, coffee, chocolate, oats, and roastiness. The flavour is absolutely stunning, it's balance and complexity are through the roof; at first there is a coffee flavour with a nice chocolate burst after, then after they started to linger off my tongue a slight oily slickness and oat flavour came through. There is also a nice bitterness that follows. The only downfall is that the coffee flavour is a bit to much in the front, but I'm assuming it fades when it ages.

1199,11757,br3wmeister,4.37,"A- An aggressive pour of this jet black liquid into an imperial pint glass produced a large brown head that stuck around for a while and left some nice lacing.  S- Dark chocolate, roasted barley, coffee and burnt toast are the most powerfully aromas in this beer. Sneaking through the roasted malt are some molasses, oats and and dark fruit aromas.  T- Some mild sweetness of dark fruit and brown sugar up front. Then some bitter coffee bite leads into a nice roasty flavor Like a thick piece of toast that is charred on the outside but has nice roasted nuts and barley on the inside. Drys out in the end and leaves your mouth with some mild sweetness and dry bitterness.  M- Thick chewy mouth feel with some nice alcohol warmth and bitter bite. Some people say Guinness is a meal... give them this beer to try.  Overall this is a very good stout. Great mouth feel and nice smell.

1199,11757,thehand,4.4,"Poured from bottle into Sam Smith pint glass. Looks like motor oil coming out of the bottle. Solid black in the glass, no light coming though. About 1/2"" brown head. Leaves a nice foamy cap after settling. Some spotty lacing. Aroma is very complex with lots of dark roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and roasted coffee. More of the coffee comes through on the taste, which is also nice and complex with dark chocolate and roasted dark malt. Finish is dry, roasted malt, with some hoppy bitterness. A little alcohol is present on the finish. Feels full and slick in the mouth, low carbonation adds to the smoothness. Very much a sipper, but a delicious one.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Hibernator,4.86,"Founders Breakfast Stout 12 oz brown bottle Served in a 20 oz tulip glass  I was super pumped to find this beer and the Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout at my local beer store.  Pours a jet black, completely opaque with a rustic brown head on top. Medium sized head, but unbelievable trails and just a great looking beer. Reminds me of dark ink.  The aroma here is awesome - whiffs of roasted coffee beans and chocolate. Roasted, mellow campfire notes in there too. A complex nose to say the least.  What we got here is a wonderful double stout. So good in fact that this beer just prompted me to change my favorite style in my profile.  A thick, yet chewy mouthfeel with a rich chocolate syrup that boasts a silky smooth blast. Burnt coffee and espresso notes with a speciality dark chocolate profile. A touch of dark fruit as well, perhaps cherries dipped in milk chocolate.  Gotta love the serious presence of quality hops on the finish. The hops are biting and acidic, but greatly help to balance out the beer.  An excellent beer - highly recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,photomike,4.2,"Poured insanely aggressively into my Orval chalice. I literally held the bottle a foot and a half over the glass and just let it fall in. Barely pulled out a half inch head. But I was kinda expecting this. It is a deep, deep brown which looks black except for the little ring of light showing around the edge when held to the light. Bubbles of all different sizes appear on the top of the beer after the head dies down (which it does in 30 seconds or so). Cool looking swirls and patches of bubbles of similar size. Kind of intimidating looking, but inviting when you know what to expect.  Smell is surprisingly un-coffeelike. I had heard all this talk about how coffeeish this beer is, and was expecting more on the nose. All I seem to be detecting is chocolate and licorice. Maybe a hint of cold coffee.  Taste: Ahhhh. Theeere it is. Big, big, big time coffee. Really, this tastes more like coffee than beer. I am getting all kinds of black coffee flavors here. I almost want to pour my standard touch of cream in there. Looking deeper, though, I detect that licorice and chocolate from the nose, more so the former than the latter, and that unmistakable bitter finish of hops. I catch a bit of alcohol as well, that melds well with the oatmeal flavors, chocolate and hops.  Mouthfeel is good for a stout of this size. This is a very smooth beer, and the ever so slight burn of alcohol makes for a nice touch, and a good reminder that this little guy has quite a bit of booze for a breakfast treat. My mouth is coated with velvety deliciousness. Quite chewy.  Drinkability, too, is pretty high, but who would want to session a beer like this? Savor this guy, and make that breakfast into a brunch.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Not much of a noes which is concerning.  EDIT: I know that ""odd"" taste now (after reading some other reviews) - liquorish.

The head quickly fades into a very thin lacing.  Aroma: Espresso & bitter chocolate aromas dominate the nose initially. Fainty boozy and malty-sweet aromas are present as well.  Taste: Bitter chocolatiness with a hint of hops. Very complex flavor. Sweeter, coffee-like flavors become more present as the beer warms closer to room temperature. The bitterness lingers on long after you finish.  Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy, almost chewy. Viscous, kinda looks like motor oil when you pour and if I had to guess what motor oil feels like if you drink it, it'd be very similar to this although nowhere near as tasty and quite frankly it'd probably be disgusting but I digress... Very light carbonation enhances the creamy quality. Very easy to drink for a beer of this complexity and alcohol level.  This beer is truly wonderful. I recommend it to any stout drinker.

Alcohol is mildly noticeable.  Mouthfeel: lightly crisp throughout. Medium-heavy in body. Aftertaste is long as the flavors linger on the tongue for a while.

Mouthfeel - Slightly carbonated with a nice medium to heavy mouthfeel.  Drinkability - After the first few sips this beer turned into a decent coffee stout.

Thsi beer is everything a double stout should be: medium-to-full bodied, smooth and creamy like butter, sweet with chocolate notes and yet has a dry backbite thanks to the roasted and coffee notes. Mixed well and also has some chewiness to it from some bread malt. Even has some minor molasses and/or maple syrup notes as it can get sticky at times.

The taste is bitter, which I expected from the toasted burnt coffee, but there is a slight hop bitterness as well. Oats, brown sugar, and dark chocolate are also present. Strong coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thick, slight carbonation.  This is a drinkable stout.

All in all, I think they're both amazing beers. Obviously, the KBS has better fanfare but this one holds it's own  A - Black - darkest beer I have ever seen. The head looked like frothy coffee. If you put this next to motor oil, you would probably get them confused - very dark  S - Coffee, chocolate, oats, hops - very inviting  T - Very complex - every sip seemed to bring some new flavors - tasted alcohol, vanialla, chocolate, oats, hops  M - This is where it gets good - the mouthfeel is extraodinary.

Also not a fan of how bitter this is on the finish. There's just something missing here.  D: A sipper for sure  Overall, I'm clearly against the consensus as I don't think this one lives up to the hype. I appreciate it's well integrated coffee flavors, but the weak mouthfeel (I want an imperial stout to be more intense) and lingering bitterness puts this a notch below most of the highly regarded IS.

The huge, healthy, 2 fingered mocha brown crown its sporting is gorgeous! It's very thick & creamy with outstanding retention. As it sinks, it reminds me of whipped root beer float foam. Very appetizing!  A: Damn! The aromatics just burst out like a genie who couldn't wait to be freed! The huge dark chocolate presence is only matched in strength by the coffee. There's also some oatmeal, roasted malts, and a hint of alcohol.  T: This tastes even better than it smells. Bitter-sweet chocolate and roasted malts greet the palate with the warmest of pleasantries, while oatmeal creeps in to perception, but prefers to lend some background flavor rather than stealing the spotlight. The coffee flavors are fantastic! It's sweet like espresso, but also has a slightly bitter edge that pleases. I also get some molasses and wood notes that are blended in as well. Finally, the hops. They're buried deep and stay pretty subtle throughout, but they do contribute some citrusy, slightly herbal notes that add great depth and complexity to what was already a great beer. The alcohol is masked just enough to lend some flavor without crashing the party. This is unbelievably tasty!  M & D: Maybe I'm nitpicking here, but Founders Breakfast Stout is not quite as full as I would have expected. It's still just a notch below being truly full-bodied. But, the velvety smoothness, luxurious richness, and supremely slick texture almost makes up for it. The drinkability is fantastic! It goes down so damn easily, and the everlasting aftertaste just nags you to fill your mouth with its goodness once again.  Notes: This is excellent, and I mean excellent brew! While I do find myself wishing it were a tad fuller and more chewy, it's a minor complaint for such a great beer. I wish to hell that Founders would distribute to SoCal. If they did, I have a feeling I would go broke drinking this all the time. Highly recommended",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Vonerichs,4.35,"This is perhaps one of the darkest beers I've ever seen. I've never described a beer as ""black,"" but there you go. There is a 1/2 finger of coffee colored head that doesn't last long.  Oh, what a smell. Heavy on the coffee and chocolate, with a little bit of nutty scent in there. Yeah, I can tell by the smell this is going to have strong flavor.  No subtlety here. Dark roast coffee, bitter dark chocolate, and just the right touch of hop bitterness. Liquid dessert.  The mouthfeel is one if the best I've ever had. Viscous, like 10W30 viscous. Rich, creamy, and chewy. The name ""breakfast"" stout just about sums it up better than I can.  Definitely a sipper. The alcohol is easily detectable and has a slight burn. Also, the richness and thickness makes me take it slow. As delicious as Founder's Breakfast Stout is, unfortunately this is more like a one and done for me.

1199,11757,marvin213,4.47,"The beer looks great. It's thick and black--indicative of the chocolate and coffee it features. Nice head, nice lacing. It looks like breakfast. The only thing preventing me from the perfect 5 is the syrupy pour--looks like it might be too thick.  Smell is great. Great coffee. Great chocolate. Great oatmeal. I'd like to try the coffee they make this with, eat oatmeal with the baby on the bottle label, and bite the chocolate bar from whence this beer came. This beer could be a Yankee Candle.  It tastes great. Everything it promises. I think the coffee makes perhaps the biggest impact, so maybe I question the double chocolate claim relative to everything else, but...who cares? I could drink this with eggs and grits at sunrise, eggs benedict at noon, steak and eggs at supper, you get the picture. Not that eggs would be an oh-so-appropriate food pairing, but this beer is appealing at any time like breakfast. AND it tastes like dessert.  The mouthfeel combines the beer's individual elements, but holding it within my mouth makes me lose that wonderful smell and I get a bit of a burnt roasted malt in the aftertaste that also provides a bit of an alcohol burn. I like it, but it's not as smooth as the beer's other characteristics.  I experience some difficulty rating the drinkability of a stout. Like good coffee, good chocolate, and (to a lesser extent) good oatmeal, you can enjoy them only to a certain extent. Like coffee, I most like the start of this beer. Like chocolate, the middle is so fulfilling. But like oatmeal, the best part is not at the end and the end doesn't really make it memorable and enjoyable like the initial experience.  This beer is great and available enough for folks to keep on hand.

1199,11757,johnmichael712,4.53,"Interestingly enough before I ever tried this beer I tasted some ice cream a friend of mine had used Founders Breakfast Stout in that he was touting as ""stout ice cream"". After trying it I told him it didn't taste anything like a stout, it only tasted like coffee ice cream. The other flavors had faded when mixed with so much else, but the coffee flavor stayed strong. After tasting and reviewing this beer I can see why!  Appearance: Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a Chimay goblet. This beer pours a dark, dark black that even when backlit with a lamp allows no light to pass though. There are absolutely no highlights in the glass, and this beer is blacker than any other I've had. It requires quite a vigorous pour to achieve a head from this beer, but when one does form it's a beautiful dark brown color (almost like cinnamon), with a soft, pillowy texture. The appearance of this beer definitely signifies to any stout lover that ""something delicious is in store for you"".  Smell: The nose of this beer hits like a truck, smelling of dark chocolate and, of course, coffee. Perhaps ""smell"" isn't a strong enough word for the coffee aroma, because there's enough coffee smell in this nose to make even the strongest cups of coffee feel a little self-conscious. Needless to say this is a coffee lovers beer, and I love coffee. I'm definitely looking forward to this one.  Taste: This beer starts off very sweet and tasting of chocolate, moves to a strong espresso taste, and finishes with a moderate amount of hop bitterness. Founders claims this beer is only 25 IBU's, but I would have guessed it at much higher. This beer tastes like the lovechild of a strong espresso and a sweet, smooth mocha; and Founders has done an incredible job of drawing every ounce of coffee flavor from those Sumatra and Kona beans.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is big and full-bodied and feels heavenly smooth on the tongue. It's a sign of a great beer when it manages to have such a full body and so many rich flavors and yet remain so incredibly creamy, and Founders Breakfast Stout is definitely in that category.  Drinkability: There is absolutely no taste of the 8.3% alcohol the bottle claims this beer has, and I could definitely see myself getting into trouble with this one. The flavors, the body, the nose, and the smoothness of this beer combine to make for one incredibly drinkable stout.  Notes: At the time of my review this beer is sitting at number sixteen on the Best of BA list (it's been moving back and forth between fifteen and sixteen for a few weeks now) and it definitely deserves to be up there. My only complaint is that this is a seasonal release, but God knows I'll be buying even more of it next year than I did this year. A phenomenal beer and a must try for any stout lover and especially any coffee lover!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Jekster,4.82,"Appearance: This beer pours an oily opaque onxy black with a thick beautifully dark brown luscious head.  Smell: Forward on the aroma of this beer is fresh brewed espresso and dark roasted coffee deans. There is a definite note of dark bitter chocolate and sweet caramel. There is a creamyness and fullness to the aroma of this beer. Something like I would associated with a fresh brewed and mixed cappuccino. There is a light ashy roast (think awaking to a snuffed camp fire in the morning) that comes across in the finish.  Taste: This beer has a heavy dark charred burnt bread component that is balanced nicely by notes of bittersweet chocolate. You get a slight hint of fresh brewed coffee, but this is highly overshadowed by the deep rich roasted flavors. There is an interesting caramelized dark fruit flavor along with a rich bread pudding component. The beer ends with a satisfying malt sweetness, slight notes of aged tobacco, and an ashy bitterness.  Mouthfeel: This beer is fulled bodied and coats your palette. It is thick and vicious, but amazingly finishes clean due to the medium carbonation. It does not overwhelm your palette for being such a heavy beer.  Drinkability: It would be an injustice to do anything but sip this wonderful beer. That being said, it's perfectly drinkable as a slow sipper. Yet, I could still be content to drink through 2 or three of these in an evening.  OVERALL IMPRESSION: Founder's really steps it up with their stouts and this is no exception. There is a wonderful balance between bitter roastyness and sweet malt character to make a wonderfully complex beer. The aroma and flavors are deep, complex and intriguing bringing me back sip and sip excited for what I might find. This is a fantastic beer and a must try for anyone who appreciates craft brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

I have to say that the first couple times I'd try FBS I wasn't super impressed, but for some reason this last bottle really upped the ante. Right from licking the bottle cap (a habit of mine) I could taste the awesome cocoa & coffee flavors. The beer conveyed the same great smells, like unsweetened cocoa powder.  The taste was great too, to say the least, adding to the complexity: dark chocolate, roast coffee, bitterness from the hops and the roasty-toasty malt, some pepper.  Maybe I'm buying into the ""breakfast"" motif too much, but this has a kind of milky aftertaste & mouthfeel (a good thing). Thick mouthfeel, chocolate stays on the tongue, dancing carbonation.

Head has decent retention. Opaque black liquid. S: Coffee, chocolate, I'm reminded of a frappuccino. A small amount of alcohol is there, but it is pleasant and fruity. T: Bitter chocolate, rich and very forward malt, a tad of alcohol. Delicious. A little sweet stab down the middle of my tongue becomes apparent halfway through. M: Silky opening which transitions into a warm pleasant alcohol. Ends a tad hot, but very nice. D: Way high for an Imperial Stout. This is one of the best of the style that I've had. This is tasty and brings me crawling back for more. Very enjoyable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,grayburn,4.23,"Dark chocolate sweetness that leaves a heavy lace on the glass. A light tan foam that sticks around to play for a while. Smells of bakers chocolate and coffee. A perfect breakfast in my humble opinion. Sweet chocolate with some coffee to bitter things up, just a touch of hops and a nice strong malty finish. A very well rounded beer. All of the flavors mix together perfectly. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, complimented by moderate carbonation. Easy to drown oneself in a few of these, thanks yet again Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,discovolante65,4.62,"I picked this up on a recent road trip through North Carolina. Poured into my Duvel Tulip. Black viscous pour with a reddish/brown head. I jammed a maglite on the side of this to see what I could find. The only thing I could find were some small bubbles choking their way to the surface. Thin head that yielded a small ring of little bubbles and had gorgeous lacing all the way down.  Smells of delicious dark chocolate, or cocoa nibs, and COFFEE. not just coffee, but good Sumatran coffee being brewed right under my nose. Sometimes, I go into my local coffee shop and they're making chocolate chip cookies and brewing strong, rich coffee and it smells like this. I have dreamed about beer smelling this good, but never realized it could.  Taste is dark roasted chocolate and strong coffee. I'm not sure if the oats lend to this or not, but it's a little bittersweet with something of a turkish fig flavor to it. I love the bitterness. There is a vanilla-bready sweetness to this which may also be the oats mixing with the other flavors.  Mouthfeel is silky and smooth. Not overly thick, but damn near chewable. It sticks to your ribs. Barely carbonated at all, which is fine with me.  Drinkability- This is truly a perfect representation of it's name. The name is carried in the smell AND the taste to precision. I am in love with this beer. It smells like a bakery and blows me away with every sip. I may have a new favorite on my hands, luckily, I bought a few four paks!!  Another fine beer from Founders!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,PeprSprYoFace,4.62,Got this one in a trade from DrDogbeer. Thanks.  Pours a very dark black. Although it doesn't look as viscous as the KBS. Thin tan head formed that dissapated fast but leaves some sticky lacing.  Smell is awesome. Lots of coffee with bitter sweet chocolate. Lots of toastyness.  Taste is awesome. Lots of coffee flavor and bitter sweet chocolate. The oats lend a smoothness that is much appreciated after the bitterness from the roasted malts and from the coffee. It tastes almost as if I'm biting down on a chocolate covered espresso bean. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel could be a little more viscous.

I should have waited until after our meal to order it, because it is so delicious on its own.  The coffee and chocolate tastes come through beautifully, but not overpoweringly.

Black and virtually opaque, with a thick, creamy brown topper that resists fade and holds true until the very end, leaving curtains of lace behind on the glass.  A big, mouth-watering aroma ascends into the nose, with hefty notes of sweet and bittersweet chocolate and roasted coffee.  Rich and smooth in body, coating the palate with dessert-like delicacy: dark chocolate seems to melt on the tongue, with roasty coffeeish notes filling in the middle along with a soft, oat-like bready impression that lasts through into the lingering sweet finish.  Delicious and rewarding, this beer's name is not far from what it seems to represent: a delicious, hearty, and sweet breakfast.

Coffee on the mouth, a chocolate bitterness, finishes with vanilla. None of the tart, dark fruits or licorice that often come with the strong stouts.

I enjoyed it but since it was the last brew of that quite enjoyable evening I wasn't exactly in reviewing shape. Suddenly, after years of just seeing it here on the site, Founders in readily available here in NC.  Well, I'm slightly disappointed in the head or lack thereof but the color is a spot on black and the nose is pure dark black coffee tone with hops as a wingman.  The taste is bitter and the oats and other whole grains match up well with the coffee tones, which are close to overwhelming. There is hop balance throughout but there is never any real doubt who's driving the bus. The texture is inordinately thick and oily and coats the throat like few beers I've ever quaffed.  Considering the ABV, this goes down extremely smooth and is well worth whatever extraordinary sum you must pay for it.

A: This pours jet black with a small head. It's completely opaque even when held to a bright light.  S: Smells like coffee and oatmeal with hints of blueberry. The roasted malts are strong and almost smell a bit burnt. If nothing else, this smell is unique.  T: Tastes like I'm drinking a mild version of an iced coffee. A weaker dark chocolate flavor hits the tongue first with a lingering coffee taste afterward. The only thing I can fault this beer on is not being a little more bitter, but it's still great.  M: A nice fullness to this beer. It is rich and smooth.  D: This beer is about as drinkable as a stout can be.

T- Coffee and cocoa dominate the palate at first, to be deliciously followed by the dry oat presence. Appropriately called a breakfast stout! M- Mmm, thick, creamy and chewy. The baby on the label has it right, you could serve this beer on a spoon. Pint glass suffices just fine for me though. D- Like a good and rich breakfast, just the right amount will satisfy perfectly.

1199,11757,JimmieFrisbee,4.59,"This beer comes with a lot of hype, so I'm trying to taper expectations as I pour this double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout into a pint glass from a 12 oz. bottle. [I let it sit for about 30 minutes out of the fridge before cracking the bottle open, but it still feels probably a little colder than I want it... but I want beer now.]  Pours a completely opaque black. No highlights shining through even when held up to the light. Very, very little head, just enough of a layer to cover the surface of the beer... maybe not quite a hard enough pour. Tan head dissipates quickly.  I can smell it from where it sits on the table, a foot or more away. Smells like chocolate malt. I stick my nose in there and there's just a feast of chocolate, or chocolate malt, or both. Wow, it smells great. I can detect even a bit of coffee mixed in, but I don't I'd have been able to identify it if I didn't know it were there.  Wow. Taste is great. All chocolate malt and actually chocolatiness up front, with just a hint of alcohol warming in the after taste. Even a couple seconds after that the coffee flavor really introduces itself and lingers on my palate. Each sip after doesn't hit with as much a rush of flavor as the first, but it is still damn good. Despite the slight warming, the over 8% ABV is well hidden.  Nice and thick and heavy in the feel. Absolutely nothing lacking in that department. Very drinkable, but the flavor is so strong I think one would be all I need. I can't see cracking another after this first one. Perfect beer to take your time on, and I think I could actually see drinking this with breakfast... especially with breakfast meats, like bacon, sausage, or a ham omelet.  Hype around a beer can do one of two things... it can set the bar too high, so the actual thing leaves you disappointed; or, it can make you think it is better than it really is. Definitely hasn't ruined the experience for me, and I think it would have been great even if I'd known nothing of this beer going in.

Dark coffee hits big like raw grinds up front and rides throughout. Roasted malt astringency to the point of burnt adds to the herbal coffee bite. Slight hint of dark bitter chocolate. A slight milky oat smoothness tries to break through the huge layer of coffee/malt bitterness for a split second but it loses. Slight warming alcohol in the finish.  M- A bit thick and chewy but not quite full bodied, lots of smoothness with a bit of carbonation.  D- Coffee is not my bag, so right off the bat this isn't really my kind of brew. That being said I still think this is a somewhat overrated brew. There isn't nearly enough balance with all of the twangy, resiny, astringency from the coffee/burnt malt flavors.

The alcohol is well hidden and pretty much impossible to detect, even as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel was a lot thinner than I was expecting, but about average for this style brew.  If you're into this style beer, and especially loads of coffee, this will make a nice sipper.

S - Coffee and bitter chocolate with a very slight burnt malt aroma. Alcohol is not detectable.  T - Coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Not nearly as sweet as I was expecting, or really at all. Very smooth flavor probably due to the oats and absolutely delicious.  M - Body is moderate. Full flavored, but slightly watery in feel around the edges. Very nice.

It's essentially all bitter coffee with faint chocolate notes. Burnt, bitter flavors dominate the taste with gobs of coffee and some dark cacao. Earthy character with an astringent finish. As hard as it is for an RIS to be unbalanced, this one is; a dry stout beefed up with spent Folger's grinds. It does have a thick feel, but it's too oily to be a real positive. Definitely a sipper.

Some chocolate, but not as strong as I was expecting. I also get molasses, some spiced gingerbread, and nuts.  T: Big coffee and espresso. Cocoa and oats are big as well. This is probably the best Double oatmeal stout I have come across. The roasted malts are huge, but you do get some earthy hop flavor also. The only downfall I can see is the slight watery hint on the back end.  M: Silky smooth, full bodied stout. Again just a touch watery when it finishes, but that does not distract from the overall greatness of this beer.

The burnt coffee flavor balances excellently with the toasted malts, oats, and chocolate flavors. All of these flavors balanced together perfectly.

1199,11757,remllof,4.42,"Finally time to review this one.Poured from a bottle. Pours with a decent brown head. Color is just plain jet black, light isnt excapting from the color of this. The carbination is fairly low. The smell is of coffee and a bit of chocolate which is just great. The taste at first is of cofffe and some chocolate. Followed up by a nice little bit of bitterness. The mouthfeel isnt as thick as i would thought this would be. but it has great smoothness to it. Overall this is a great beer which does a great job balancing out all the flavors it has going on.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ccrida,3.28,"12 oz. bottle poured into my Meantime snifter, Founders Breakfast Stout is an oily pitch black with a dark, bronze tinged tan head that leaves scattered, foamy lace. Served around 55-60F.  Smell is bitter bakers chocolate, over roasted coffee and dark crystal malts, light alcohol vapors, sweetening as it warms.  Taste is on the boozy side, more bitter chocolate, some acrid coffee grounds lingering on the finish. As it warmed, the sweetness of the dark crystals starts to come out more, but they have tanginess that I never care for.  Mouthfeel is fantastically smooth, a bit on the drier side, medium-heavy bodied.  Drinkability is ok, this isn't really my favorite style, and this one is to acrid and hot for my tastes. Nice mouthfeel though.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,chriskozma,4.37,"The beer pours a deep black with almost no head to speak of. Subtle coffee smell but the taste is packed with coffee up front but it seems to be a little more subdued towards the finish. Slight alcohol burn. The alcohol isn't as hidden as other big flavored stouts. The drinkability is good, not great.  Overall, this is a pretty good coffee stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ElGrecoVerde,4.41,"Black. Pitch black. And oh so tasty looking. Sometimes I feel appearance is an overrated attribute, but it's something worth noting this time.  This beer is a perfect blend of all my favorite flavors. Dark chocolate dominates, with near perfect balance between bitter and sweet flavors. Roasted coffee and toasted breads fit in nicely. This beer is starting to sound like it literally is for breakfast.  The aromas aren't quite as dominate as the flavor, but compare nicely.  Smooth, creamy, full mouthfeel. It hits every node on you tongue and lingers until your next sip. Very easy drinking Imperial Stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Thesoundandthefury,3.95,"I got this brew in a recent trade with BrewerB  A- Great appearance. Dark and thick, with about a finger of tan/light brown head. This is looking quite delicious.  S- Loads and Loads of chocolate and coffee. Some roasted aromas are in the background, but the coffee and chocolate are definitely the dominant aromas. Amazing smelling!  T- The smell is right in line with the taste. Coffee, Bitter chocolate as a finish, a touch of sweetness, roasted malts. Overall an outstanding taste.  M- Thick and rich. Very low carbonation, which is how I prefer a double stout. Coats your mouth and seems to stay with you for a few minutes afterwards.  D- While the flavors, appearance, and aromas are exquisite, I find it a bit too rich to drink more than 1, two TOPS.  For those who love the bold rich flavors of coffee/chocolate stouts, this is a brew for you.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,raoulduke37,4.43,"Got this in a trade from psunate in PA. Thanks again, Nate!  This beer pours a thick, viscous black, with a nice brown khaki head, which retains fairly well. Excellent lacing all around the glass as you drink this bad boy. Smell was quite interesting: once again I utilized my mom's nose to better distinguish it and she nailed it: smells smoky, but it has a distinct Greek olive smell. Those big Greek olives you get on your salad. Since I don't really like that smell, I had to knock it down a bit. Taste was fantastic - chocolatey, smokey, raisins, and black black coffee. Definitely not a taste for the faint-hearted. Mouthfeel was the strongest feature - creamy, smooth, and soft all the way down your throat. This isn't a session beer, but with its abv, I'd probably order two or three, especially on tap. Don't pass this one up, gents.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Creamy dark brown head the sticks to the glass the whole way down. The aroma was sweet with a lot of coffe tones. Heavy and smooth with a big coffee taste.

1199,11757,darklordlager,3.93,"Pitch black in colour, pours very thick with a light brown head that sits for a minute and then decides to duck underneath the liquid.  Smell is of a big French Roast coffee press that sat too long, extracting some bitterness-chocolate, nuts, and a lingering acidic smell. Light fusel alcohol smell lies in the background.  Taste is of slightly bitter coffee, roasty malts, dark chocolate. Roasty flavours and bitter coffee dominate this as it warms. (Not as complex as I was expecting) Alcohol still remains elusively hidden.  Mouthfeel- is creamy, not syrupy like the pour led me to believe.  Drinkability- Rich, to be taken one at a time.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,mugglesandhops,4.85,"Received this in trade. This is one of my favorite beers to date. Loved everything about it. It poured a dark brown almost black body with a 1-2 finger sandy brown head that had good retention and fair amounts of lacing. The smell was phenomenal, huge coffee, chocolate, roasted oat smell. The taste was just as good if not better, I take that back it was better. Again with the coffee and chocolate, more coffee than chocolate for sure though. Medium to full bodied . Overall this is an amazing beer. I just wish it was available around here.

1199,11757,colts9016,4.53,"Thanks to kels for this bottle.  This the beer that started my quest for finding craft beer 2 years ago. I have been trying to get this beer to see what the rave was about. Poured into a pint glass at 51 degrees.  Appearance: A very dark brown almost black color beer. There is a 3 finger head that is rocky and foamy, the head is a dark tan color. There is some effervescence in the beer. The clarity of the beer is opaque. There is a lot of lacing on the pint glass.  Nose: A rich roasted coffee, and dark malt. There is a nice bitter sweet chocolate, oats, molasses, burnt sugar, and vanilla. There is a floral esters in the background and it is very subtle.  Taste: A rich dark malt and a wonderful coffee flavor followed by a very nice bitter chocolate. There is a nice oat, molasses, burnt sugar, and a subtle floral esters. There is a touch of vanilla to finish this beer off.  Overall: The mouth feel is chewy, full body, and richly intense. The finish lingers wonderfully long on the palate. This beer is insanely wonderful. There is a great balance in the beer between the hops and malt and the other ingredients. The bitter sweet chocolate kicked it into overdrive. It is more than I could have dreamed. There is a slight burnt character in the beer that border on a slight harshness.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

M: Oily and thick, sticks with you..  D: Overall a very good beer. Is is it the best I have had.. No. But quite exceptional.. A great stout to go with food, or as a night cap.

1199,11757,magnj,3.7,"a - Really deep brown in color, like old motor oil to reuse the worn out comparison. 1-2 finger head from a very aggressive pour. Chunky head subsides pretty quickly to a thin film. Leaves nice chocolate colored lacing.  s - Bitter chocolate comes through more than the coffee for me, though it is there too. Really a unique smell.  t - Chocolate and coffee. Really would be drinkable for breakfast, though I doubt I'll ever manage that one. Call me crazy, but something like hot sauce comes through at the end in addition to bitter, almost harsh dark chocolate. No hop bite. Alcohol taste is not huge but there. Chocolate is real dark. Not bad, but a little heavy on the chocolate and roasted malts to the point that it's overpowering the coffee and this is a pretty fresh example.  m/d - Light feel but flavor covers the mouth. I feel like it should be thicker for the style. Carbonation is low, like I suspect it should be. Smooth. Drinkable for the style, complex and tasty. Of course at 8% it's a sipper and not a session beer. I'll consider putting some of these down for a year or two, I hear they do very well but I'm glad I only got one. The harsh end really ruins what could be a very complex and enjoyable brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smell- First to hit is obviously coffee, then some oatmeal and chocolate tones emerge.  Taste,Mouthfeel- Instant coffee upfront with a slight bitterness that only adds to the overall flavor, malts sneak up right behind it all but its hard to get past the abundant coffee flavor(not a bad thing).

1199,11757,kurlare,4.34,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours black, with a creamy tan head. A rush of carbonation after the pour gathers into a fine, whipped-looking head. Looks smooth and rich. Luxurious even!  Smell: Coffee, espresso... then a burst of hops... some chocolate. Quite a harmony of scents. Can't smell any malt or overt hop notes.. the most dominating scent is definitely coffee, then behind that are some hops and faint notes of chocolate. This is one of the best smelling stouts I've ever encountered.  Taste: Initially, bitter espresso and hops. The malts finally show up in roasty goodness in the middle, bringing some sweetness to the party. Bitterness from the hops lingers in the dry finish. I can't say I detect the chocolate in the taste, but it is there in the smell. Oh, this tastes excellent by the way. Not a single complaint in terms of flavor.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, rich, very nicely carbonated. Not as full bodied as some other stouts, but will satisfy your craving for a thick stout.  Drinkability: I feel like this is the one area in which this beer suffers a bit. At 8% ABV, I personally cannot have more than one of these beers in a session (or my session will be over before I know it). It is bursting with flavor, and by the time I've had a bottle I'm just ready to move on to something else.

1199,11757,applky,4.45,"A 12oz stubby bottle from a four pack  Completely opaque, tar-like body with very dark brown head. Lots of lacing up and down the glass. An impressive-looking beer.  A caustic coffee flavor up front in the nose. Toasted malts around the edges. This is one of the most aggressive-smelling beers I've ever encountered -- almost as if the alcohol is intent on burning your nose as well as your palate.  Thick, very viscous, coats your mouth with a rich coffee/chocolate/malt flavor. As the beer warms, you're able to pick apart some more component flavors: dried fruit, herbal spiciness, oakiness (?), and oats. This stout basically tries to be everything a stout can be and mostly succeeds. The one flavor I don't really detect is chocolate, unless you count chocolate as a round, full mouthfeel that lingers in the back of your mouth. Very much a sipper, but pretty easy going down -- the ABV is pretty low for an imperial stout.  Not a very smooth beer, but one of the most impressive I've tasted. One of those beers that goes for broke and succeeds.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,gory4d,4.45,"Pours like thinned molasses, with a dark brown head that fades to a skein of bubbles and finally a ring around the glass, leaving just a little lacing. The smell reminds me of sulphured molasses, actually, at once sweet and mineral, but with something rich and floral at the back of it, not unlike lilies. The taste is complex and inviting: the floral notes are forward, passing though to the savory robustness of mocha on through to a bitter finish with some drying but slight alcohol burn. The carbonation is very mild, and the body is thinner than you'd expect -- no sludge here. It's an easy one to drink, but a better one to savor.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Nose is replete with dark roasted coffee, a bit woody, more spent grounds than fresh java. Nice and intense but maybe just a bit coarse.  Taste is big on coffee up front, dark roasted and woody (like eating an espresso bean), with a light nuttiness from the oatmeal and a very dark chocolate presence in the finish, underneath the mega coffee presence. Rich and dark, with a light acidity present to add a bit of bite towards the finish.  Mouthfeel is low carbonation, full body, silky. Bit of bite towards the finish from the roasty acidity.  Nicely drinkable - alcohol largely hidden, with a big flavorful coffee character that should appeal to coffee lovers everywhere.

Tastes of everything the bottle advertises: chocolate, coffee, oatmeal stout.  Oatmeal stouts are my fave style, partially for mouthfeel; thick and rich.

1199,11757,Stimack,4.87,"I was so happy to stumble on this Founders brew, this is the first time that I have been able to locate any of their products, and thankfully it was the Breakfast Stout. This brew poured to a pitch black color with possibly some dark brown like highlights. The pour generated a full sized medium colored tan head of small bubbles that has very good retention. This retention gives great lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma, whoa, getting strong fresh coffee notes, almost like wet coffee grounds that is so inviting. Chocolate is also there, bitter sweet (?), that gives a fantastic mix. Also some roasty nut like aromas peak through. The flavor is intense, coffee flavor is clear from the start and then the end seems to give a coffee bitter finish. Chocolate is also there and that might be also playing into the bitter end that I notice. This is an amazing brew, such a fantastic flavor, this should be a sipper with the 8.3 %alcohol in it, which is not noticeable one bit, but is going down fast. The feel of this brew is nice and thick, yet smooth. The carbonation is on the lighter side which I like as its does not interfere with the rich malt flavors. This is one of the best brews that I have ever had, it packs so much into it and every part is simply spot on. I will never give a perfect score to a brew but this one is up there.

Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, almost ridiculously great for being 8.3% alcohol. Coats the mouth with bitter chocolate near swallow. Carbonation is perfect, smooth, 1-1 with this full bodied beer.

The pour resembled motor oil going into my car. Small head that quickly disappeared to no head.  The nose smells like a bag of crushed coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate. Smells like an excellent way to start the day. I don't particularly like coffee, but this smells awesome.  This thing is just bursting with flavor. Huge coffee taste, chocolate, and some citrus from the hops.  Full-bodied, deliciously smooth and creamy, leaves a little tingle on the tongue from the carbonation.

S - smells like a freshly ground bag of coffee with some bakers chocolate added in. the chocolate's bitterness becomes blended and less apparent, and blended in with the hardcore bitter espresso/coffee smell. but really: coffee, if anything, then coffee.  T - well, it tastes like an iced coffee already in my tasting process, simply phenomenal!. I know they use coffee in the brewing process but to get such a beautiful taste as this is amazing! it actually tastes like a NYC coffee soda for those ny jews like me that like those oddities from nyc. well back to point: formost it tastes like coffee, no alcohol or much else like that. for the finish: the coffee gets stronger and is checked by a strong bitterness different than the coffee, that of chocolate. the chocolate finally makes an appearance on my palate! with such wonderous effect it graces my buds and makes me want more, though I know my store has no more (I bought the last!). this is truly a beer among beer as far as taste goes. the aftertaste is like that of the highest gourmet chocolate covered espresso beans. I have never tasted something like this before in my life.  MF&D - the feel is a bit thin for something as big bodied as this, I would have to liked to see it as thick as the mikkeller geek. the drinkability as with many great beers is no great chalenge for me, I love it and I am going out to the store right now to get some of my father in law some.

Pours a deep dark brown with a dark tan head. Not a whole lot of head retention going on. Minimal lacing. A bit less viscous than I was expecting.  Smells like seriously strong coffee... the kind they serve at all-night diners that cater to truckers. Coffee, and a bit of roasted malt.  The first thing that comes to mind upon the first sip is cold coffee without cream and maybe a single cube of sugar. It toes the line of being an unbalanced beer, but somehow... it just works. What an absolutely delicious brew. There is a hint of dark chocolate and oatmeal, but you almost have to look for it amongst all that coffee.  I didn't think this was as full-bodied as some of the other reviewers, but this may be due to some of the beers I've been drinking lately. Carbonation is right in the middle, and right where it should be. Finish is slightly bitter, much like that cold coffee mentioned earlier. Despite this, drinkability does not suffer at all. I immediately wanted another.  I can see why these fly off the shelves in the areas where they are available.

S: Not highly strong scent but fairly complex and balanced with strong coffee and roasted malts with hints of chocolate.  T: Yum! Roasted malts/oatmeal upfront with chocolate and bitter coffee aftertaste. The alcohol comes out a bit at the end but not bad for around an 8.0%abv.

Great roasted malt aroma. Perfection for the style. Taste follows the nice precisely, bitter coffee and chocolate and a nice roastedness. A touch of hop bitterness keeps the malt nicely in check. Very chewy, sticky mouthfeel, with a dry finish. A notch below full-bodied for an imperial stout. An insatiable desire to luck your lips after each sip to pickup the residual flavors. Alcohol is perfectly positioned, giving you a warmth and umph, but not affecting the taste. To be a touch critical, i'd say a slight bump up in alcohol wouldnt hurt.

Poured a jet tar black with a nice milk chocolate colored head that disappeared into some badd asss lacing.  The smell was my favorite part of the brew. Lots of vanillia sweetness up front blending nicely with dark rich coffee and dark chocolate. I love the vanilia most of all!  Taste was much like the smell. The vanillia added a sweetness to it that I really enjoyed. Great balance though with the coffee  Slick mouthfeel, full bodied",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,macktbone,4.4,"Split this bottle with a BA member and poured into a low ball type glass.  Color is black with a small hint of red at the edges. The pour developes a medium brown head with a beautiful lace ring. Suprisingly low carbonation in this thick breakast treat.  Aroma gives off a strong sense of burnt coffee and bitersweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is thick but hard to get over the very low carbonation level. It actually takes away from this great taste. Searching for the carbonation takes time away from time enjoying the taste.  The drinkability on this beer is crazy easy, may as well be a doctored storebought coffee without cream. Tastes like yesterdays brew, mixed with a fresh pot and re-heated.  The alcohol is disquised as sweetness due to a good balance and you would never peg it for 8.3%. The lack of hops seperates it from other imperial stouts and may indear this beer to those who tend to stray from hop heads 1 minute after 4:19.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,halfP1NT,3.9,"This stout pours a thick, oily, opaque black. An aggressive pour yields a thin, dark tan head that leaves some thin lacing behind.  Smells just like fresh coffee grinds. Malty, chocolate, toasted malts.  Taste is toasted, burnt malts, bitter coffee, bitter cocoa. There's a bit of sweetness. Nice warming alcohol lingers a bit after the sip. This beer is very rich and robust, a slow sipper.  Medium amount of carbonation, full bodied brew. The burnt malts almost become a bit cloying after a while which hurts the drinkability. But I really do appreciate the way the malts present themselves in this beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,farrago,4.3,"Full onyx blackness in a glass, appears immaculately clean and unblemished. The brown head craters here and there, uneven, comes with a sticky thick lacing. The toasted chocolate and cocoa element in the nose outweighed by denser oatmeal and bitter chicory scents, the edginess even dampens the sweetness of the raisin, black grape, plum fruit, green coffee bean adds to the cut, does not lack for length in your nostrils. Full-bodied, smooth in mouthfeel with persistent carbonation for its weight. The grapey sweetness frames the attack, plum, raisin and raspberry fruit. Quite soon after the chicory, espresso bean, grilled nut, dark chocolate shades ratchet up the bitterness. The oatmeal and light caramel notes salve the wound. Oily texture develops at the end, extends presence. Fluidity deceptive, after third glass your gut feels a touch heavy.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Kegatron,4.41,"On tap at the Flying Saucer (Charlotte, NC) on 1/17/09. Served in a balloon style cervoise.  Pours a dense pitch black with a 1/2 finger of smooth and creamy burnt mocha colored head. Retention is quite awesome, with a most excellent flareup that leaves just a huge cascade of lacing and brown oils behind. I'm just loving the way this looks in the glass. Fantastic! The aroma is just lush with roasted coffee and espresso notes. Sweet supportive notes of chocolate and lactose balance out the nose. Some floral hops and light heat pull up the rear.  The taste starts with a nice roasted coffee bitterness that just blasts the palette. A thick tasting mix of chocolate and caramel sweeten things up some underneath. Finishes, well, bitter, bitter, and more bitter. I love the nice dry lingering bitterness this puts on the palette. Good stuff. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a big creamy feel that just loads the mouth with flavor and substance.  No matter how this is served, this is a certificable classic coffee beer. I never pass up a chance to try this on draft. Great stuff!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Stinkypuss,4.75,"a. A proper, hard pour provides a stout grainy yet rocky/milky mocha head. Little white star bubbles are noticed glistening off of the noon day light. Lacing is abundant.  s.Huge black coffee and espresso aromas, chocolate and malt, but Im pretty sure they are separate aromas, and not simply chocolate malt, though I am sure that was used too. Coffee and Barley aromatize the room.  T. A small sip yields an overwhelming complexity of delight. Chocolate is the first nip to the palate, quickly chased by some cappachino like coffee. Oatmeal is certainly here lending a subtle flavor. The earthy hop mingles with some bitter unsweetened chocolate to provide a mineral/bitter edge. Finishes chalky with a whiff of alcohal.  M. Mouthfeel is semi-vicious, semi-smooth. Oatmeal provided the smooth factor to the palate, the hop would add to the viscousity. The only room for improvement would be a nitro tap/cask to add to the smoothness of the mouthfeel.  D. This strong, meaty beer is a solid A+ stout. Any time of day one of these will be all you need.

1199,11757,damienblack,4.38,"Pours jet-black, thick like motor oil. Cocoa powder colored head, starts off thin but quickly billows out. Looks like chocolate milk, sticks to itself but still leaves some cool lacing. Smells like harsh instant coffee, coffee extract personified. Kind of a bran smell also, if bran had a real distinctive smell.  First impression: Lots and lots of coffee. When I burp it still tastes like coffee. Dark chocolate also is present, except it's not a real bitter dark chocolate, it's very in tune to the rest of the beer. A lot sweeter than I had imagined it would be. Just the barest hint of hops at the end, but this still trends towards the sweet side (for a big stout). has an oatmeal like smoothness to it, smooth but still a little sticky, doesn't quite have that velvety feel. Big, slick yet coating, without a ton of carbonation. In this case, it works. Maybe a little thin, not quite as all-enveloping that I had hoped. But it had big expectations to live up to. Super smooth and infinitely drinkable. Not hands down the greatest stout I've had so far, but it lives up to the hype. I could drink this forever.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Fresh coffee dominates the aroma along with a touch of dark chocolate.  There is some fruit flavor up front in this one along with a touch of dark chocolate, sort of like a chocolate raspberry creme candy. That gives way to fresh roasted coffee then giving way to more chocolate, this time much sweeter than whats up front. Mouthfeels is great. Smooth, perfect carbonation, and full-bodied. The 8% alcohol is virtually undetectible. This is a great coffee stout and just a great beer period.

1199,11757,GatorBeerNerd,4.41,"12 oz single purchased from Jungle Jim's by a friend during Thanksgiving. Poured into a standard pint glass.  A: A picture of this beer is perfection for me when it comes to stouts. Completely pitch black. No light comes through this one at all. A frothy thick brown head with excellent retention that leaves clumps of bubbles stuck to the side of the glass with each sip. Absolutely perfect appearance.  S: Coffee dominates the nose. There are hints of chocolate as well. I'm starting to wonder if it was a good idea to drink this one at this time of night. It smells nice, but would like a bit more depth than just the coffee bomb aroma.  T: The taste follows the aroma. It is a coffee bomb with hints of chocolate to add a little bit of balance to the bitterness of the coffee flavor. It is quite smooth compared to other beers I have had in the style. I really like this one, but would like just a bit more balance to give it a 5.  M: It is very thick and incredibly smooth. The word creamy doesn't do it justice.  D: This one is scary drinkable for a huge stout like this. The only reason I do not give this a 5 is because I have had a sample of COAST Blackbeerd to know there is another level of drinkability for big stouts.  I now understand why Founder's gets so much credit. An amazing beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

T: Chocolate up front, with coffee middle and a nice smooth powdery finish. The best stout I've ever tasted by a large margin  M: Smooth - not much carbonation which I think works well for this beer. not too sweet or sticky.

1199,11757,djeucalyptus,4.24,"a vigorous pour yields a meager ruddy brown head sitting atop a murky near-black body. Mahogany and garnet shine through when up to the light. The head fizzled away, leaving some decent lacing down the glass.  Aroma is purely blissful. Rich coffee beans mixed with freshly brewed coffee and rich bittersweet cocoa. Dark chocolate and pepper mix with vanilla and caramel. A bit of roasted malt to remind that this is beer.  Taste is solidly roasted malt with roasted coffee. Some heavy bitter coffee and twangy hop bittering follows the sweet coffee opening. Caramel and a bit of pepper stay through the finish, intermingling with the pine hops that become more powerful as it warms. A solidly roasty, coffee, oatmealy and pleasantly bitter brew. Maybe a bit high on the bitter, and a touch less chocolate than I was hoping for, but all in all a solid brew.  Mouthfeel is a touch thin given the flavor profiles. Carbonation as well is just a touch thin, yielding a slightly watery and slightly slick brew. smooth and fairly easy to drink.  Definitely a solid brew. the aroma is purely incredible. I wish the taste and mouth followed as closely to the aroma. Not bad, an interesting mix of bitter coffee and roasted cocoa. A bit more sweet to mellow out the bitter coffee, and a touch more carbonation and this one would be perfect.

Big, fresh roasted coffee. A little bittersweet chocolate provides just a little balance to the coffee. The faintest spicy hop taste lingers but is no match for the other tastes in this beer.

Just a great experience, considering I cannot get this on the west.  The appearance is really nice for a Stout, the only reason that I did not give it a perfect five is because it was not thick consistency wise. It poured dark brown, and held up to the light nothing comes through, but doesn't look like motor oil. Poured a great three finger head that had a caramel-brown color.  The smell is great, all I smell is overwhelming coffee with an incredibly bitter cocoa.  The taste is so crazy. It tastes like chocolate coffee, there is not doubt in that. It also has a really light mouthfeel, I cannot tell if it is the carbonation bouncing on my tongue or someother ingredient, maybe the yeast. I kind of wonder what this would taste like warm. Probably awesome.  The mouthfeel is really trippy because it almost seems ""light"" or really bounces on the palate like an IPA or overhop beer would.

A nice little coffee w/cream head finishes off a darn good looking beer. The smells take me to a Costa Rican plantation that grows both chocolate and coffee, this beer smells awesome. Better then awesome, they should bottle this smell and make a perfume out of it. The chocolate and coffee thunder through in the taste as well, yeah the alcohol is there, but it doesn't offend you at all. As the beer warms, the two notes of chocolate and coffee still dominate but they do make room for hints of spice and oatmeal to meander across your taste buds. I think I would drink this stuff through a straw I enjoyed myself so much. Typical stout in that it looks really thick but once you get it in your mouth it is pretty light.

Roasted malt, a bit of toffee-like sweetness and a bit of alcohol (but not at all boozy). Oatmeal is certainly in there, too!  Taste - Chocolate sweetness with a roasty Kona Coffee-like center. Much roasted flavor continues through the finish. A hint of bitterness from the roasted grain is kept in check with the smooth chocolate sweetness. Hops are there, but unobtrusive (unlike some over-hopped American stouts). The oatmeal comes through to help live up the the ""breakfast"" name.

1199,11757,CrellMoset,4.05,"Founders Breakfast Stout, on tap at the Flying Saucer, Charlotte, NC. Served in a traditional American pint glass.  Appearance: A solid black abyss of a beer surging underneath one tan finger of foamy head of indeterminate retention - not sure whether to blame that upon the beer or the somewhat slow bartendress/hostess (in a rather revealing schoolgirl outfit, though I'll try not to let that influence my review). The lacing is sparse, speckly, and erupts occasionally from the surface to creep up the sides of the glass.  Aroma: Smoke (or is that the bar?), toast, and wholesome malt notes, with sweet cocoa emerging upon agitation. Coffee becomes more prominent as it warms. ""Breakfasty"" sums it up in about word. Definitely improves as it warms, with toast and coffee coming through more strongly.  Taste: Slightly milky coffee, toast, wholesome oat notes, and cocoa come through strongly up front, very pleasantly balanced. Truly, each component here is about on equal footing, they're all pungent, authentic, and make for a great combination with one another.  Mouthfeel: Medium to big effervescence out of the keg, with a very medium-thickness body, though perhaps light for the style. The carbonation makes this one fluffy, smooth, and remarkably even. Best aspect of this beer, and the one improvement over the bottled version.  Drinkability: A little better out of the bottle, I think, which is unusual as I've heard this one is best fresh, straight out of the keg. Previous observations stand - alcohol is nowhere to be detected and isn't prohibitive for the style, and the flavors are nice and well-balanced, but there just seemed to be something lacking here.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BedetheVenerable,4.12,"12oz brown bottle with twist off cap...the label's awesome, it's got a kid with a massive bowl of oatmeal on the front and informs me that this is a double-chocolate stout with oats and coffee.  Appearance: Pitch black, utterly dense and viscous liquid with a thin dark tan soapy film on top.  Smell: FRESH brewed coffee, backed with light chocolate notes.  Taste: Fresh bitter coffee, sharp grainy roastiness, and notes of bittersweet chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and smooth from the oats.  Drinkability: HIGH for the abv.  Conclusion: This is a GREAT coffee stout...but there's not as much of the oats or the chocolate as I would have liked...that alone keeps this from being world class.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BARFLYB,4.17,"12oz bottle into a Penn Pilsner imperial pint glass. The label depicts a ugly child with an eating problem, he may need to hit the gym in a year or two though.  A- Founders Breakfast Stout pours out of the bottle with a mixture of jet black, and reddish/light brown highlights. Once fully in the glass, a pitch blach body is present with no light able to come through. The head is nothing much (1/2 finger) as dots of tan head are seen in the middle with a thin 360 degree circle around the glass. No lace.  S- Mucho coffee up front followed by more coffee. Once I got around that I smelled bittersweet chocolate and some oatmeal grainy goodness. some sweet chocolate is there but is masked by the scents.  T- I'm not a big coffee guy but FBS sure packs it in the taste with what I am sure to be many different coffee types. Good coffee too, not the cheap stuff in my lunchroom at work. Very pungent. To get the maximum chocolate from this, wait till warm temp and taste, as it melds seamlessly with the coffee. Much oat is also detected and a added bonus to this bouquet. A milky creaminess follows while the malt/hop factor is there but almost non existent. A nice change from a lot of beers i've had recently.  M- Thin in the beginning, thick towards the tail end. Not much carb. As FBS warms the mouth feel begins to become more pronounced. FBS feels like drinking a cold coffee in the beginning to me, but as it warms the chocolate and malts that are present remind me that i am in fact drinking beer, with a very slight alcohol burn, again very slight.  D- This is a very drinkable coffee stout and I could of had 30 oz in a sitting. I'm going to pour two into a huge glass next time. I can see this brew being very accessible to unsuspecting people at a party.  My 2nd favorite coffee stout right under Canada's Peche Mortel. A bit tastier on tap. I could drink this at any time during the day and come to think of it, I have, I think i have a problem !!!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,mrandypandy,4.03,"Served on-tap at Monk's Cafe, in Philadephia.  A- Pours jet black with a thick dark brown head that laces my glass. Very opaque, and no light escapes. S- Coffee. Lots of coffee with a bit of toffee sweetness. Smells just like breakfast, but better. T- More coffee and a lot of milkly sweetness. A bit of chocolate shines through as well. Very tasty. M- Silky smooth, almost creamy and lush. Not sure what else to say. D- Dear lord give me more. I could drink this all night long. I really wish I could get this in Georgia.  Overall, one of the better coffee Imperial Stouts I've had. I highly recommend this if you stumble across it. 5, 4.5, 5, 4, 5 **** EDIT **** After having an aged (6-8 months) bottle of this I feel the need to re-review. What was a delectible beer fresh, has now turned into a rather stale and bitter version of it's former self. Appearance is similar, but now with less head. Smell is not as sweet and the coffe has died down a bit. Taste has gown down quite a bit, and I get a pronounced coffee bitterness that wasn't there before. Mouthfeel isn't as creamy and smooth as it was before. Overall, a great fresh beer that hasn't aged gracefully. 4.5, 3.5, 3, 3.5, 3.5  ***I've updated my score to reflect an ""average"" of the two ratings.***",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,sonicdescent,4.77,"Thanks to vwcraig for the opportunity to try this.  Appearance is a thick, oily, viscous liquid. Dark as night. The head was about one finger, mocha colored, and thin, disappating into a few islands. When swirling the glass a little this liquid looks extremely thick.  The nose is roasted coffee up front and a creamy scent. No trace of alcohol. Very nice.  Taste is accurate to the name, a nice sip of a great amount roasted coffee beans, milk, and a medium sweet malty sensation in the background. Leaves a fantastic coffee aftertaste; I wish I had a real coffee that tasted this good.  Mouth is good, this isn't nearly as thick as it looks when pouring it. Carbonation is medium, body is medium. No heat feeling. Very creamy.  Drinkability is phenominal, I wish this were easier to get around this area.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,PerzentRizen,4.44,"I thought I had already reviewed this so when I realized I hadn't I dipped into my stash for this one.  Poured into a Duvel glass FBS pours a deep jet black with a dark full tan head. This beer looks much richer and thicker than it feels in the mouth.  The aroma is off roasted coffee, oats, and general roastiness. Smells like breakfast alright!  The taste is amazing. The coffee is first, there is little in the way of hops, but then an extremely rich malt background comes forth. Massive creaminess not felt in the mouthfeel sneak up and deliver a great finish.  The mouthfeel is very light compared to the appearance - at least until the finish. In the finish you can feel a much richer body. Also, as this beer warms from 45 to 55 degrees the body thickens and becomes much hardier.  I would call this very drinkable for the style. It is exactly like an oatmeal stout despite its potency this beer is very smooth (alcohol is very well hiden) and I think I could at least try to drink this all day.

A dark pour, good foam, deliciously complex nose, excellent taste with multiple undertones of fruit, nuts, and coffee. And a brickhouse of a body.

1199,11757,coldmeat23,4.27,"GLASS: Oversized Wine Glass TEMP: Cellared @ approx 50 degrees Ultra thanks to eddiebo for the hook-up with this one!  Black. Totally black. Slight touch of dark crimson at the extreme edges, when backlit. No head to speak of, just a slight filmy covering of loose, tiny bubbles. Lacing is actually okay, despite the lack of a head.  Fresh ground, fresh roasted, dark coffee beans. Nice notes of dark chocolate. Deep, dark roasted maltiness. Hints of vanilla sweetness.  Sweet maltiness out front. Dark chocolate in the middle. Finishes with the taste of ground coffee beans. Slight sweetness of vanilla and maple syrup. If you don't like black coffee, stay away.  Mouthfeel is sufficiently thick and almost oily. Not quite as 'big' as I was expecting, though. Not quite creamy enough, for me.  Taste wise, this is totally drinkable. The body is a minor letdown, as I'd gladly drink many more of these.

Immediate nose of coffee, vanilla, chocolate and toffee, all blended together. As the beer warms around mid-glass, the 8.3 abv rolls nicely into the mix as well. Mouthfeel is full and sweet, with a hint of spiciness. Taste is truly a pleasure, as each of the ingredients in the nose take turns dancing ont the tongue, with the alcohol rounding them all up for a long warming finish.  Most enjoyable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Paired with some vanilla bean ice cream, chocolate sauce and a chocolate cookie with Oreos.  Appearance: Pours dark black with a very small brown head. Not much light gets through this beer.  Smell: Coffee and sweet chocolate. Very nice smelling beer.  Taste: Just as the smell suggests, an excellent coffee and milk chocolate taste with a bitter coffee finish.

Aroma: Faint oat, coffee, and bitter chocolate notes... not too much to be honest.  Taste: Similar to the nose with oats and roasted malt up front. The ""double chocolate"" and coffee seemed like an after thought in the taste profile.... strange considering the name.  Mouthfeel: On the heavier side. Sticks to the tongue.  Overall: Its OK. The alcohol is very well hidden given the ABV. I was really expecting a lot more from this brew.

1199,11757,JMH_,4.69,"Pours a near black colour with a mid-sized to small tan head that has a bit of creaminess to it and quickly settles in to a thin lace that leaves a fair amount of residue on the glass.  The aroma is amongst the best that I have ever come across in a beer: it's a mind-bending mix of semi-sweet chocolate, subtle but powerful coffee notes, bits of oatmeal and general roasted malt. Awesome.  Flavour continues the onslaught of the aroma with coffee coming in first and quickly blending with the sweetness from the chocolate, all the while also giving off a sharp bitterness at the end of each sip, where it also blends with a bit of burnt/toasted malt. The coffee burps from this one are a nice bonus as well. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and not as chunky as expected but still pretty damn good. There a bit of smoothness here as well and a slight touch of hotness from the alcohol, although said alcohol is fairly well masked throughout overall.  This beer is well worth the price tag and certainly comes as advertised. I could enjoy this one all day every day and not grow tired of it.

It is pitch black, one of the darkest beers I have ever had. It smells like espresso, dark chocolate, and alcohol. At first this beer seems very espresso like as I taste mostly cofee notes. As it warms the chocolate notes are more pronounced. I think it gets better as it warms. It becomes more creamy and tastes much better. It is somewhat strong but I plan on having one more before the night is done.

With that said, they are hardly comparable. Either this is the best Stout I have ever had or my liking for Stouts is on the increase, or...Both perhaps?:  A: A nice thick black pour that blocks nearly all of the light. Perfect size white head appears sharply contrasting the bottom of the glass. Nice lacing and glass hugging. Was drooling before I tasted.  S: Some stouts smell overly bitter, this does not. Warm coffee overtones and smoky chocolate. Mocha cappucino comes to mind.  T: Blown away by the initial lack of bitterness. Insant taste of oatmeal, nuts, chocolate, followed by delayed alcohol with slightly bitter aftertaste, very smooth. Mouth swishing reproduced the whole cycle.  M: Exceptional mouthfeel, chewy, smooth, creamy.  D: Great drinkability for a stout. I could drink up to 3 of these in a sitting, but I will choose to use this as the dessert for future tastings.

Aroma is bitter dark chocolate and a hint of booze. The aroma could be more pronounced..kind of weak.  Taste is dark bitter chocolate, an oaty creaminess, and coffee. Very smooth, goes down easy.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: this beer acts like its going to finish clean, but then there is an unexpected delayed bitterness left on the tongue. 8.3%. The alcohol is well hidden.

1199,11757,everetends,4.43,"12 oz bottle thanks to the great IBUnit63. Been looking forward to this one for a while. Served up in my Terrapin snifter.  A: Poured a pretty nice and dark black. Very little light gets through but that which does comes out in the form of a very dark and deep red. A very thin line of mocha head develops and turns into a lasting ring. The ring creates some nice lacing that leaves some nice waves on the glass. The brew also leaves a this brown film on the glass as well. Very nice.  S: Smell is mostly of coffee, nicely roasted coffee beans. Chocolate comes out as well. Nice roasted caramel malts come out as well in the nose. Although it only has a few notes in the nose, they are very appetizing and enjoyable.  T: The first thing that comes out is the coffee in the taste as well. There are some really nice oatmeal notes as well. Kinda shocking how much oat comes out. Chocolate is rich and smooth. There is also some really nice lactose notes as well along with some really nice nuttiness. This brew is very well rounded and damned tasty.  M: Full bodied brew that is oily and thick. Really coats the mouth and leaves a lot of malt an oats in the aftertaste. ABV is not noticable at all.  D: This brew is great in the nose, taste and appearance. The crazy part about this beer is how easily it goes down for the style and ABV. This is truly a great beer and I am most thankful for getting the chance to drink this one.

1199,11757,taylorhamrick,4.33,"Poured with a huge brown head (I think the size will vary depending on when it was bottled, most Founders beers are bottle conditioned and though I can't see it I assume this one is no different). The head lasted the entire time, even though I was drinking slowly. There's some good lacing. The beer itself is black and very beautiful. The smell is primarily coffee, but you get quite a good roasted scent, dark malts, some sweetness, but it's limited by the coffee. The taste is smooth, a bit bitter from the coffee, but backed up well by a roasted sweetness. The taste is really hitting on something nice, a bit more tolerable than pure bitter black coffee. The mouthfeel is good, with a decent rush of carbonation. The aftertaste does not have as much of the acrid coffee taste, especially after a couple of months. It's pretty easy to drink for an 'imperial' stout, though many beers in the category have similar ABVs which are lower than a RIS, but they have pumped up flavors. This beer is really great, and I could have another. I can say that in the future, I will probably purchase more.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Poured into a snifter, the Breakfast Stout is pitch black with a thin dark tan head on top that doesn't last very long. Nice enough to look at, but nothing exceedingly special. But the aroma! Oh the aroma. The nose is dense, strong coffee, with a malty chocolate backup. Seriously, this is a phenomenal smelling brew. I almost get a buzz just smelling this beer. The taste follows suit accordingly, delivering delicious notes of milk chocolate and coffee, accented by dark cherry, oatmeal, malted milk balls, and a dry coffee bitter finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky soft with a super dry finish.  This beer has met every expectation and possibly exceeded a few. I hoped it would be good, but the aroma really gives this beer a leg up on other rich stouts I've had. The coffee presence, which I love, is so well pronounced it really adds so much to the overall character of the beer. This would go great with some vanilla ice cream for dessert.

T: Plenty of hop bitterness balances out the heavy malt sweetness. Malt is chocolate (dark) some vanilla character. Dark fruits - plum. Coffee but again not espresso like. Quite good all around.

Dark chocolate and oatmeal are the predominant smells. This is not as harsh as some Stouts, there's seems to be less black patent malt.  The flavor is something special: it is more ""dark"" than the smell would lead you to believe. Here, the black patent malt shows up in spades. The burnt flavors last throughout the taste long after the swallow. This is not a chewy beer; I'd describe it as rather thin for the style, but the carbonation is low, so it doesn't seem ""off"" to me.

1199,11757,Shiredave,4.36,"My first sample of this highly touted stout. This pours thick and syrupy - intensely black and completely opaque. A firm, dense brown head forms and stubbornly recedes to an ever present film leaving sheets of lace around the glass.  (By style guidelines, it CAN'T look better so 5 for appearance tho here on BA, 20% for appearance is far too high a % of an overall score IMHO and the reason why many of my scores are higher than they would be if judged by BJCP standards where appearance counts for approx. 6% of the overall score)  Aromas are all RIS - ripe fruit and chocolate - coffee and molasses with hints of baking bread and cherry Kool Aide. Very subdued scents and no trace of alcohol this beer doesnt ""wow"" me as it's just a bit too mellow - very nice just not amazing.  Flavors are rich and chewy - BIG coffee character with strong chocolate cake yumminess and great grain and oat flavors. Warm roasty notes and earthy hop bittering slide in towards the finish leaving a long, lingering hop/coffee aftertaste.  Body is doughy and full up front and then slips away at the end, dry and chalky. Just a little thin all around which makes this even more dangerously drinkable, forcing bigger mouthfuls.

Surprised that it was a twist off bottle, but had no affect on the taste. The mouthfeel is really light for a stout. Definitely one of the best beers I've ever had. I don't think I could drink more than two in a session, making drinkability the only not perfect score. I don't think I'll ever be able to rate a beer higher.  Side note- out one night drinking with some buddies and used it in place of guiness in an Irish car bomb, absolutely amazing( but instantly drunk).

1199,11757,Augustiner719,4.2,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Agressive pour yielded little to no head, almost as if there is no carbonation in this beer. After swirling i developed a small half finger mocha colored head that dissapated quickly. Very dark brown, almost black and opaque.  Smell: Smells of burnt chocolate, dark chocolate, espresso and caramel. I also get a hint of toasted marshmallow on the back end of the aromas.  Taste: Booze is very present, but in a good way as this beer is meant to be drank rather slowly. Tastes like espresso mixed with some dark chocolate and a touch of butterscotch. Not totally knocking me off my feet, but interesting and balanced.  Mouthfeel: very little carbonation to the eye is present, but on the mouthfeel, im getting a lot of carbonation and prickly sensations on my toungue.  Drinkability: this is definately an occaision beer for me. I wouldnt session this beer ever, but im glad I tried it and I believe its my first imperial stout. Its a good way to kick things off for me, but I would drink 1 and 1 only a night. I would try again, but I would only drink 1 at a time.  ****Re-Reviewing***  After letting it sit for about 20 minutes and a couple of sips here and there, the second half of this is simply amazing!  The alcohol burned down a lot, the taste is much smoother with less of the burnt espresso taste and more of a mocha cappicinno taste. I get a little bit of cinnimon and some faint oatmeal flavors now.  first review: A -4 S-4 T-4 M-3.5 D-3.5  Second review:  A-4 S-4 T-4.5 M-4 D-4",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,rmmm16,4.65,"This is the beer that got me into imperial and double stouts, I didn't realize what I was missing. The aroma is oatmeal, chocolate, caramel, a hint of cinnamon, and many other notes. The taste is intense, but not overpowering. Very multi-layered, and each layer is excellent. Cocao and coffee flavors give it a perfect bitterness at finish. There is a hint of alcohol warmness. This is definitely a beer for savoring, no more than two a day are necessary. It is one of Founder's several truly beautiful beers.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,cbros,4.7,Serving type- Bottle poured into a regular pint glass.  A- Pours a beautiful dark roasted black with a small dirty brown lace that is present througout the drink. Great color with no activity present and even if their was you would not be able to tell because of the dark rich color.  S- Strong hints of caffeine and roasted malt/ chocolate.  T- Great taste combination of roasted flavors of coffee beans and cocco. Smooth mellow oatmeal flavor that ends in a smooth finish.  Had the opportunity to try this at a local bar and from everything that I have read this is a great beer. I do not have alot of experience with Imperial Stouts but after reading great reviews from here I could not pass up the opportunity to have it. From what I have read Founders just recently became available here in NC and I have very happy because I will definately have this again.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,OtherShoe2,4.53,"Pours black with a tan/milk chocolate head that dissipates over time. I got incredible rings off of this one. Distinct full rings after each sip that stayed on the glass as I downed this one slowly. Beautiful.  Smells of malt, coffee, and cocoa. Very pleasant and not overpowering.  My first 5.0 for taste since I've been rating brews. This is downright exceptional. Deep roast malt/coffee, with a great chocolate undertone. The coffee flavors are there, but not overly bitter; no sour notes. Terrific balance. The toasty oatmeal lends a sweet grain element that balances out the bitterness perfectly. First sip out of the cold fridge gave me coffee then alcohol. This boozy flavor lessened as the beer warmed, or as I got used to it. This is absolutely first-rate stout.  Excellent body and smoothness, with a slight bitter coffee finish that is more of an aftertaste -- a rather clean note after a sip of a complex flavorful brew.  Overall, I could have more than one of these, but 2 would be a limit (really because pas that my appreciation would lessen as the alcohol kicked in). So glad I found this finally. If you are a stout drinker, this is one not to be missed. I might even stock up!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,WalrusJockey,4.27,"12oz bottles into Sam Smith pint glasses. Aww, a twist off? Weak, whatever.  Appearance- black. Real black. Light brown head which is thick and gives decent lacing.  Smell- chocolate, coffee, and malt. Lots of each, and nothing else. Sure is appetizing.  Taste- chocolate and malt enter the mouth, with a coffee taste following behind, the swallow is coffee and the after taste is coffee-malt-alcohol, all in one, with the most lingering flavor being a long drawn out coffee bean taste.  Mouthfeel- the oatmeal addition is very noticeable in this, the beer enters the mouth like a smooth velvet. While holding it on the palate it lightens noticeably, but then goes down silky smooth again.  Drinkability- this seems like a one-a-day beer, as strongly flavored as it is, I doubt I would have another tonight, but I could easily have one again tomorrow.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,daythree16,4.52,"Pours a dark brown to black color with a one-finger tan head.  Wow...this actually smells like oatmeal. Awesome coffee aromas as well as a good roasted malt backbone. Taste has some sweetness reminiscent of toffee with a bit of caramel and a great coffee bitterness on the finish.  Medium bodied with a nice silky mouthfeel. Really intense and robust flavors make this very tasty, but hinder the drinkability somewhat.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,hoppheadIPA,4.82,"Had to order this from a website since it's not available in FL. Let me tell you it was well worth it. I wish I got more than one 4 pack. Pours a jet black out of the bottle and produces a pillowy dark brown head. I'm instantly hit with the smell of roasted coffee and chocolate. Wow what a fine smelling beer. Tastes of rich coffee and creamy chocolate. Has a nice oat taste in the backround, followed by a fair but well balanced alcohol taste. Wow this beer is outstaning. Stick to the mouth perfectly as I drink. i could definatly drink this, even for breakfast. It's filling, but excellent.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Soneast,4.07,"Pours a coffee black color with about 1 finger width of a brown colored head, that recedes fairly quick leaving a creamy ring around the glass that deposits a butt load of suds on the glass. I can barely make them out due to the inky blackness of the beer, but there are a lot of bubbles riding the perimeter of the glass.  A very nice roasted coffee bean aroma. A hint of sweet caramel and a nice chocolate background.  The flavor is heavy up front with the roasted coffee flavor, a very nice milk chocolate background, a nice bitter chocolate end with some awesome acidic coffee flavors mingled in. A very thick brew, leaves a delicious milk chocolate bitter coffee flavor on the palate.  This is quite a heavy beer, with, what i feel to be just the right amount carbonation. Did I mention how thick this is? Almost like a meal in itself. Just a great Double Stout. While this is drinkable, it certainly isn't a session beer. I do however look forward to finishing my 4-pack on Christmas morning. I think this will be an awesome compliment to the holiday.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,garymuchow,4.23,"Pours thick and rich with certainly one of the darkest heads I've ever seen. Nice density to the head and it leaves lacing as it settles. Coffee black. Rich aroma of coffee noted initially. Holds an interesting sweetness, that I suppose could be the oatmeal, but also has a zip with the hops (grass, forest green). Wow what a whole lot of flavors. Excuse me if i neglect some of this cornucopia of taste. Starts with the coffee that shows a tad of sharp taste and bitterness but once it's gone all the traditional beery flavors show with hops making a strong presence in the acceptable bitterness and green wild grassy taste. There is the makings of a dark fruit (close to dark berry) in the making, but it doesn't come to fruition (so to speak). Incredibly long finish of bitterness, with coffee and hop flavors. Quite a bit of carbonation, especially for style. Seems to make it thinner than maybe it actually is. Drinks well enough for style. The strong full flavors lend it to wanting to take small drinks to savor the flavors. Glad I have a second bottle as I think aging will make this truly wonderful instead of merely very good. Rich flavors and body now holds a sharpness from its youth that I would prefer to not experience. Thanks S.H. for the trade.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Klgkenny,4.83,"I think that I probably poured this too passively resulting in the meager head. I will pour the next just a bit more aggressively.  Black. When held up to a 60 watt bulb, very little light penetrates, producing an earthy brown at the edges of the glass. Looking down at the surface of the beer, I can see bubbles of carbonation, but I can't see them from the sides of the glass. The inky darkness prevents it.  Smells like coffee brewed by angels poured into a mug made from charred wood. Complex aroma of charred wood is dominant and is followed by chocolate and coffee. Blends beautifully.  Once this stout reaches the mouth, the coffee takes over. It still maintains the aromatic integrity, but the charred wood takes a backseat. The tasted blend even better than the scents. This is easily the best tasting stout that I have had until this point.  This tasty beverage coats the mouth like coffee, leaving a bitter-sweet aftertaste. Beautiful feel in the mouth. Very thick. Light carbonation.  Although I would not ""session"" this beer, it is extremely drinkable. I can imagine that after a point, the coffee taste might become cloying, but I would be extremely happy to drink several of these, even for breakfast!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,WakeandBake,4.67,"Pours a thick opaque black with a creamy tan head.The aroma is packed with coffee chocolate nuts toffee and many more roasted malt scents. Taste Take a glass and fill if half full with rich melted milk chocolate, and fill the rest up with a gourmet coffee and add a healthy serving of whole cream. mmm. Oh there is a shot of booze in it too. That is the best I can describe the creamy chocolate sensational experience.

S: Strong, freshly brewed coffee with a dark chocolate background and a hint of caramel and oatmeal.  T: The dark chocolate and coffee flavors come out immediately in a slightly bitter fashion. There is a hint of sweetness in the middle that lasts into the aftertaste.  M: Thick and mildly heavy with the perfect amount of carbonation to compliment it's thickness.  D: A tad bitter for a stout, but I find that refreshing. Surprisingly easy to drink.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Deingeist,3.66,"A - Thick dark brown head that lingers for a short while before turning into thin coating. Dark brown, even looks heavy. Lots of lacing.  S - Coffee, Dark Chocolate, Molasses, Malt and tons of all four. Smells like a dark roast coffee.  T - Bitter the way that coffee and dark chocolate are bitter, rather malty but not too sweet. Some char-like roasty flavors, almost little sour actually. Can taste the alcohol on the finish and leaves a bitter aftertaste. Not bad but not the greatest.  M - Good. Heavy, creamy, with a slightly oily ending.  D - I know some people who could pound these suckers, and I do like stouts, but the flavors here are so bitter for a stout, and just...so much.

1199,11757,TMB0424,4.6,"12 fl oz bottle poured into pint glass.  Poured an intense, pitch black body with an inch thick muddy tan head. Creamy looking. Reduced somewhat quickly, leaving thick, delicious looking lacing. Very intriguing.  Smells of smoooth mocha, chocolate. FRESH, roasted coffee beans. Wow. Very sweet and grainy smelling. Nice.  Tastes of bitter, dark chocolate and the fresh coffee beans mentioned before. Roasted malts. Creamy oatmeal as well, adds a certain chewy feel to the body. The bitterness hit me first, then it finished immensely clean and sweet, with a tiny, slight dash of citrusy hops at the very end. Undeniably incredible brew. Carbonation is perfect... incredibly well balanced.  Mouthfeel is incredible. Thick, full bodied brew. But it maintains its smoothness throughout the entire bottle. So smooth. The little carbonation adds the perfect balance to an absolutely outstanding stout.  This is definitely a sipper. It's the only way to enjoy a brew of such caliber. I took the recommendation of allowing this beer to warm throughout the bottle, and god, was it a treat. This is 100% one of the best stouts out there. Highly recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ibbjamin,4.56,"Bought a four pack of 12 oz bottles from Discount Liquor in Milwaukee, WI. Poured into a large snifter. ""Double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout""  Poured very aggressive leaving a quarter inch of tan head that dissipated somewhat quickly and did not retain well at all. Black color, minimal carbonation.  Smell is clean and quality. Not overpowering like some beers in its style/class. Dark smooth chocolate mocha nose. Vanilla and creme. Sweet malts. Some lacing.  That first sip gets you right here **points toward right side of jowl** Really gets the tastebuds to wake up from their slumber. Quality ingredients used in great balance. Vanilla comes through more in the mouth. Still chocolate mocha with creme and sweet malts. This is a tasty stout.  Medium to full body. Dangerously easy to drink; I just keep wanting more.

Dark roasted grains, coffee, a hint of balancing sweetness. Intense at first, but the boldness dissipates quickly. Later, catching some chocolate. Sweetness stronger and overall aroma more balanced late in the sample.  Bitter chocolate and dark roasted grains taking the lead, but coffee also present. A hint of sweetness balances. There must be some hops adding to the bitterness, but none identifiable to me. Damned smooth and balanced, though definitely more bitter than most stouts.  Carbonation is low but perfect. Texture is smooth and creamy, with mild warming.  Lovely, to me, but a sipper. One to savor and share. Overall, a great beer.

1199,11757,Reagan1984,4.2,"This is a really wonderful beer. It is.. But why does this get all the press vs. Backwoods Bastard? Sorry, I'll be good.  Poured like a motor oil into my glass and created a wonderful active brown head that built up... dangled for a while, then settled back into the brew. There was a thin film of tan thick foam that remained. Insane lacing began to form on the side of the glass. The beer was literally black and you could not see anything in it or through it.  Aroma was of concentrated coffee syrup (Rhode Island) and of dark roasted malt. You could really detect the grains in the aroma.  I LOVE dark, black coffee. And therefore, I love this beer. I admit right away, it could stand one more tea spoon of sugar in the batch. (I never put sugar in my coffee) You almost get the acidic flavor first before the roasted burst of flavor. Then it settles to a VERY subtle sweet moment, before moving through some hop bitterness and then to a very dry roasted bitter finish. Never burnt, but always on the edge.  Mouth feel is big and bold. Beer is dry... very dry and somewhat acidic.  A sipper, that's for sure.

Slightly hoppy in the middle. Finishes clean.  Mouthfeel: Thick, low carbonation, low hops. Slightly chewy.  Drinkability: A very nice double stout.

Cocoa, fresh ground coffee, licorice, and roasty black malts fill the nose. hot chocolate sweetness, hop bitterness, pine, toffeeish malts and mildy acrid roasted barley add to the mix in the taste. The mouthfeel is extremely viscous and mouthcoating. It seems as though the carbonation is actually slowed down, having difficulty moving through the density. The finish is robust with espresso and chocolate lasting a long time. Alcohol is impeccably hidden for the strength.  This may be the thickest beer Ive ever had.

Oats supply a rich creamy character that is sweetened by fresh cream that is mixed with cooked oats drizzled with a touch of sugary molasses. This is a followed up by a lingering bitterness/dry character. Absolutely a huge beer! I am speechless with this beer...an outstanding amalgamation of flavors in great harmony  M: creamy, silky goodness! Maintains a zap of carbonation.

Loads of bitter black chocolate are the highlight, with a nice dose of chocolate in the background.  The taste is very nice. Again, big black coffee note up front with a slightly bitter finish. A load of dark chocolate comes through on the back end. Slightly milky as well.  Mouthfeel is just shy of full bodied. It's fairly creamy, and has relatively low levels of carbonation.

1199,11757,ncstateplaya,4.46,"First off, I absolutely love the label. Actually this is probably the best beer label I have ever seen.  Appearance: Pours extremely black, blacker than night. Very little head, maybe an 8th of an inch or so during a heavy handed pour. What little lacing produced was almost sheet like with cohesion. Nice!  Smell: The nose of this beer is very complex. Beides the coffee and chocolate malts I noted the alcohol - a fruity estery smell, looming smoke, and hints of burnt bread.  Taste: There is no doubt about it, coffee is the underlying flavor of this brew. A smokey coffee, almost Sumatra like (I decided to look it up, Sumatra and Kona). I impressed myself on that one. There was a distinct flavor that I had a hard time placing, I'm still swaying on this one, but I want to say graphite.  Mouthfeel: Much more carbonation than I was expecting. It is a medium bodied beer, which was very surprising - during the pour I just knew this was going to be one dense viscous treat. It also has a dry finish, enjoyable, keeping me going for another sip.  Drinkability: I think the amount of carbonation and the acidity detract from the drinkability of this well crafted beer. I would love to try this beer off nitrogen.  I like an early morning beer just as much as the next, but this may be a little too much for me at dawn.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,PhillyStyle,4.72,"Poured from a 12oz bottle:  To start, this is probably the best stout that I have ever had and certainly since being on BA.  A: Poured an opaque, black body with an thick dark tan head that took its time dissipating, ultimately leaving a nice ring once gone.  S: Reminded me of when I used to walk into my favorite coffee shop in Philly. The coffee aroma was practically spilling out of the glass. The aroma was dominated by the coffee, but followed with a hint of sweet chocolate.  T: Like I stated above, probably the best stout that I have ever had. Again, the coffee dominated the beer, but balanced really well with a very light hint of the chocolate and subtle malt flavors.  M/D: I was prepared for an overly thick beer, but was really surprised when it was not as thick as expected. Don't get me wrong it is thick but very easy to drink, smooth and the alcohol was not noticeable at all.

Big, solid black body under a two finger light brown head that slowly pops and releases smells of coffee, dark chocolate brownies, and a strong roastiness.  First sip says chocolate sweetness then moves to dark roast coffee with a strong roastiness in the finish. Mouthcoating malt leaves plenty of time to sit back and let the flavors really shine. This really is breakfast in a glass, assuming breakfast involves a cup of coffee.  The 8.3% isn't noticable at all. A thicker body and just enough carbonation creates a pretty good feel to this beer.

1199,11757,mightyjoemoon,4.47,"this is a monster of a double stout with chocolate, oatmeal, and coffee. honestly its complex enough that picking out the individual flavors is a bit daunting. it has alot of coffee on the nose; much more so on draft than out of the bottle. it also has a surprising smooth biscuit like richness thats probably thanks to the oatmeal. among double stouts founder's breakfast isn't the strongest at a mere 8.3%. in fact bell's expedition is 2% beastier... but this is where founder's breakfast shines. unlike the expedition which is delicious at first but nearly unbearably harsh after drinking 2/3's of a snifter, this stout becomes more smooth and more palatable as it warms. despite its 6$ price tag i often find myself drinking 2 of these and lusting after a third. that being said its definitely a palate crusher. once you've gone this dark and strong the only place to go is expedition or bourbon.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,dukedevil0,4.4,"Picked this 12 oz bottle in a 4-pack from some liquor store in Chicago as I can't remember which and it's been at most of the stores I've been to around here in recent weeks. Original bottle I bought was from West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, IL as a single.  A: Pours DARK black like motor oil into my pint glass with little head as it pours. The head developed slightly after the pour as a dark chocolate & copper color, then reduced to just a rim around the top of the brew. Lacing looks good around the glass.  S: Major coffee and roasted scents present. Couldn't tell if I was drinking beer or smelling the inside of a cafe.  T: Taste is similar to the smell; lots of coffee and roasted flavors along with a slight bitterness and bitter chocolate finish if you are looking for it.  M: Somewhat thick and heavy as expected, thin carbonation with small bubbles that made it very smooth to drink.  D: I could drink a lot of these, or just put a straw in a keg. Only reason to stop is that the coffee flavor became too much over time.

1199,11757,hwwty4,3.4,"Thanks to IBUnit63 for this one.  Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a thick India ink black with very little head, even with a pretty vigorous pour. As this beer resided it left no lacing. The aroma is of strong coffee, bitter chocolate, molasses, and just a bit of cream. The flavor reminds me of coffee that has been sitting on for a couple hours and boiled down to a really strong concentration. The flavor follows suit with coffee dominating the flavor profile but honestly it's not a good coffee flavor. This beer is really astringent and the astringency drowns out the milk chocolate and molasses that are slightly detectable in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is full and creamy. It definitely has that nice oatmeal-y mouthfeel. While I'm generally a person that absolutely loves coffee stouts, this one just doesn't really do it for me. I would much rather have a Schlafly coffee stout or a Peche Mortal.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Last night, I had the opportunity to try Founder's Breakfast Stout....and I was blown away!!  S = Wonderful nose of cocoa, chocolate, and roasted coffee beans.  T = Dry cocoa upfront, bitter dark chocolate in the middle, and a slight hop character near the end. The finish was incredible with roasted coffee bitterness mixing with semi-sweet cocoa flavors. In addition, the finish lasted forever. Alcohol was not detected at all in the taste.  MF = Very rich and thick body with low carbonation. Silky smooth and creamy.  Overall, this stout was balanced amazingly well and has shot to the top of my fave list.

1199,11757,beerthulhu,4.35,"A: Poured very silky in nature from the bottle producing a dark roasted bean color. A dark nutmeg colored head sits atop but dissipates rather quickly without so much of a trace of lacing.  S: The nose yielded a dark roasted coffee bean scent that was very dominant with some dark ripe fruit. Simple in execution yet very rich, fresh and aromatic.  T: very rich, smooth and refined with a dark roasted coffee bean nature accompanied by a dark chocolate helping. A nice earthy hopping (soil) with a dark bitterness was also well noted, but again was very smooth and refined. A light burnt woodiness finishes things out.  m: medium full with a very silky smooth texture. A extremely soft carbonation only adds to the slick and smoothness of the mouthful while it leaves a strong roasted coffee bitterness that lasted a good solid before finishing with a smooth charred fade.  D: very good, rich, dark and goes down very easily and smooth with a beautiful silkiness.

The java colored head is a thick mix of big bubbles suspended in a fine mesh of foam. Nice lacing too.  The smell is of crushed coffee beans and dark bittersweet chocolate. Lush, rich and full of robust roasted flavors. To say that this is a dark beer would be the understatement of the century.  Taste is a whole lot of wow. Deep sweetness with a smooth chocolate flavor. It has a feel of a bar chocolate that you hold in your mouth until it's melted. Thick and coating in the mouthfeel this big beer is heavy on the coffee tones, roasted dark malts, dried dark fruits and did I say chocolate. Damn this is a tasty beverage.  8.3%... really? The alcohol never surfaces, it's just an easy drinking beer. Nice creamy mouthfeel with a light touch of carbonation. Fantastic all around.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smells like dark coffee. Very powerful nose that stays until the last sip.  The taste is like strong coffee, dark malts and some bitter chocolate. Because this is an oatmeal stout, it has a creaminess to it that I also like. Mouth feel is very good as well but not highly carbonated tasting.  This is absolutely one of the best stouts I have had.

A black hole lets more light through and i want to bury my nose in that coffee foamed head. Smells like good dark chocolate melted into great dark roast coffee perfectly blended into a creamy smooth stout. I have to calm down. Nowhere to go but back down the quality chain from here.

Semi-sweet chocolate, mixed with bitter day old coffee - this doesn't make it sound good - but somehow it is. There is a lot more going on for this brew than I am qualified to describe, but the mouthfeel is near perfect, the taste is truly unique, and the drinkabilty is dangerous.  I was afraid all the talk about this brew would leave me feeling underwhelmed, but it certainly is worth all the fuss.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Dalem,4.62,"Dark brown/almost black in color with very little head and frosty lacing. Big French roast coffee aroma up front with whiff's of chocolate and, with a swirl or two in glass, hazelnut and vanilla character as well. The flavor is huge on the coffee tip. The flaked oats stand shoulder to shoulder with that and also pull together the semi sweet chocolate flavors in line. Every little flavor character in this brew compliments and bring a balance to each. It's finishes just a robust as it starts never once giving you the impression that this it's an 8.3% cuz it's crafted so well. Full and filling in texture this is a slow sipper but on a cold and windy winter night it's something great to spend some time enjoying while keeping warm.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Notes of chocolate, but coffee smell is huge.  T - Sweet taste of chocolate with bitterness of hops, followed by a coffee-like aftertaste. Another flavor that I can't really put a finger on...going to guess oatmeal? Very complex and very interesting. Definitely can taste the alcohol in this one as well.  M - Very lightly carbonated, very creamy.  D - Very good. Incredible taste and smoothness is a great combo...could certainly see this going great as dessert, or even with breakfast as the name suggests.

Im starting to think my glassware is the reason my beers dont hold a head for very long. lace is too thick to stick for long, but i like that about this beer so I wont take away for that.  S: Smells like coffee, burnt coffee, and coffee grinds. sweet alcohol.  T: Sweetness hits the tongue first, but dryness on the back of the palate balances it very well. Bitterness comes more from the roasted malts than the hops, very well done. Notes of dark chocolate, very bitter chocolate. Something very strange in the aftertaste, cant put my finger on it, could be the oatmeal?  M: Creamy, lightly carbonated, sweet then dry.  D: I certainly want another, good thing I have more. roasted coffee bitterness would be the first thing that would overpower the palate, but very well done for an imperial stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

But it is so damn good, I feel that this particular beer deserves all of the kudos that it has received.  Appearance: Thick, dark brown/near black and viscous -- ""glugged"" out of the bottle. I didn't get much of a head, despite trying to pour a little harder to see what I would get -- a very thin layer on the top that is dark brown and looking back at me as I type this. Even though it's thin, it just looks thick and chewy.  Smell: Nothing shy of amazing. Heavy chocolate, mocha; almost like a White Russian. A friend of mine says it smells/tastes like Hershey's syrup with alcohol, and that's a pretty accurate way of putting it.  Taste: Outstanding. Just like it smells -- chocolate, coffee, mocha -- all right up front just smacking you in the face. Also a strong presence of alcohol, which makes sense considering the ABV. I had it on tap a couple of months ago, and it's largely like I remember it right out of the bottle.  Mouthfeel: Thick. Coats your mouth so heavily. Even when you're finished with it, you tend to carry it with you for a while.  Drinkability: Well, I wish I could say that I could sit and drink these all night, but it's heavy and it packs a punch. It is by far one of the most amazing beers going. I don't think a lot of people can effectively argue that.

Great lacing on the glass.  Not an abundance of scent for me. Accrid like most porters ( i know this is a stout).  Taste was less like coffee and more like coffee grounds. A little more harsh. Some sweetness settles on the tongue in the aftertaste.  Smooth beer. I could drink a dozen for breakfast. this is a good time.

1199,11757,Gehrig,4.65,"Impenetrable black body, dense as a moonless night, with a sliver of mocha-berry colored head that, for so little froth, left ample lacing on the Yankees pint glass; a fabulous first impression. Espresso coffee, hazelnut, dark chocolate, and oatmeal jockey for position in the smell, truly one of the best noses on any beer I've ever enjoyed. I regularly grab coffee on campus and, while what I grab is unfailingly good, those don't hold a candle to the aroma of Breakfast Stout--no lie.  Really delicious taste, one that improves as it warms--which I'd recommend. The coffee taste has a definite hazelnut flavor, and the dark chocolate tastes like a rich, fudge mocha brownie. Just wow. The mouthfeel is no letdown, so smooth but conveying the duel between sweet and sour waged in every sip of Breakfast Stout. As it warms, it takes on a moderately sour flavor, but not in an overbearing way. That the drinkability is very good yet not one to quaff is for the best in various ways, including allowing the beer to warm a bit to allow all the flavors to breathe, to illustrate the complex genius of Breakfast Stout.  Yet again, Founders has created a masterpiece. This is every bit as good as the brilliant Red's Rye. Nothing short of outstanding, and is one of the very best Imperial Stouts around, hands down. It belongs in the class of Avery's Mephistopheles and Goose Island's Bourbon County. A tremendous accomplishment.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The inattentive dark-haired waitress wearing her ""I'm not getting paid enough to wear this ridiculous outfit in a warehouse full of frat"" expression plunked down a 10 ounce North Coast (??) goblet filled with the magic Founders BS.  A. Pitch-thick black, a lumpy 3cm dark red-tan head caps it. Sticky lace clings as I down this.  S. Huuuuge roast grain and coffee notes. Very earthy and ""raw"". Mexican cocoa, smooth, bitter, a little salty sea tang, earthy, dirty, mild sweetness peeks out but is lost in the big dark notes. Delicious and hearty smelling.  T. Massive mild espresso roast, earthy and oaty. Hard to believe this is 8.3%, drinks like a 6.5%. Thick and dense, but never cloying -- it's actually not even that sweet. Lingering coffee-dirt and bitter chocolate finish is pleasing and perfect for the cold night it was drunk on.  M. Adequate carbonation, semi-thick and manly. Not oily, but dense. Hop bitterness is restrained and complements the finish - cocoa, bitter-yet-smooth roast notes - nicely.  D. Not great, but boy is this easy going down. I think a few hairs just sprouted on my chest.

Tight and slightly vocal brown head. The coffee and chocolate aroma is dead on. Not too bitter, perfectly balanced with just the right amount of sweetness. Much is the same with its taste. The oatmeal used makes for an extremely light body for its style and adds a mellowing bitterness to the sweet and high quality chocolate malts. The slightest of grassy hop twangs just before the finish adds to the overall greatness. I cant say enough about this one. The only problem i have about this beer is that i drink it too fast.

The froathy/creamy slightly cinnamon colored 2 finger head fades into a nice thin layer on the top and a slightly thicker ring along the sides.  The direct keg version of this fine brew has more of a lactose flavor than the same brew out of the bottle. Nice SUPER dark and deep roasted coffee and slight mocha notes. No presence of chocolate in the aroma that is distinguishable from other aromas.  This, like many [or all] FOUDNERS beers are GARGANTUEN. If Dark Lord is a Gargantuan Imperial Russian Stout than this is the same for coffee & oatmeal. The flavors are so strong that I feel like I'm drinking an Ice Coffee (but obviously much better than mere coffee). There are really nice bittersweet chocolate notes that seem to intermingle with the lactose. The coffee and oatmeal aftertaste is so big is tends to sit so long that you actually want an ice java (black)!!!!  I loved this brew bottled and I love this brew even more on tap!

This is just inpenetrable to light. There isn't a huge head on this beer and it pours a little sludge like as well. The nose is deep, thick, prodigious coffee and some raisiny dark chocolate notes, and roasted dark sweet grains. The nose is mostly coffee as is the taste.  This beer is creamy and smooth as can be, and there are loads of complexity to it, but it is the coffee flavors which predominate. This is clearly an oatmeal stout and the consistency, mouthfeel, and milky underneath are dead ringers for the style. But then we return to that coffee flavor ... yes, there are some other items in there such as deep dark chocolates, some deep raisiny notes, maybe a touch of heavy fruits.

The head filled several fingers of the glass and retained a thick consistency throughout.  S: The nose is coffee, thick and acrid with a sweet chocolate undertone.  T: The nitro pour has added a distinct smoothness to the ale, softening the blow of the imperial stout. The result is chocolatey with an overroasted quality. The coffee, strong as it is, has also been toned down. The flavors are sharp, concentrated like a cup of Starbucks.  M: The creamy foam takes a great deal of the edge off of the ale, making it much more enjoyable even if some of the dominant coffee flavors have subsided.

1199,11757,1fastz28,4.43,"wow, i've never seen a liquid so black, its darker than oil. the head is a very dark brown which doesn't seem to bulge after it is done growing, doesn't even look like a beer. smell is very malty, has alot of chocolate aroma to it as well, even some bacon aroma. taste is crazy, each sip has something different in it, vanilla, sweet malt, chocolate, the smoke aroma also comes through in the taste. the alcohol content is present but not overpowering. mouthfeel is nice and thick, full and rich. a really unique beer, and a really really good one aswell",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,RblWthACoz,4.8,"Pours pitch black with a dark tan head. Nose is coffee, molasses. Flavor is oustanding. Unbelievably thick and complex. Loads of coffee. Good amount of molasses. Massive malts. It's like a meal in a bottle. Feel is smooth on liquid and with a minimal carbonation. This is a damn good beer. Simply amazing and much better than I recall it being on-tap.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,sgoodship,4.2,"Thoroughly enjoyed Backwoods Bastard and decided to branch out and see what else Founders had to offer. Found myself with this brew because it sounds so good. Oatmeal Stout - the breakfast of champions (and young children apparently).  A: Brown black with a tiny hint of ruby on the edges against the light. Without a very aggressive pour, I got a nice half finger dark coffee stained head. It dissipated to a thin ring, a gentle dusting and developed some artistic spotty lacing.  S: Very deep bready, oaty, roasted malt - kinda smokey with very strong freshly ground coffee turned up to 11. I almost felt like I picked up a slight sweet lactose type creaminess too.  T: Bold decadent espresso malt flavor. Smooth up front with a hint of sweetness but it falls headlong into an incredibly bitter coffee and dark chocolate finish. Hardly a hop in sight. Toward the end of the drink, it definitely took on more of a malt and smokey profile - really nice way to end the pint. I love it when a drink unfolds. Hard to believe the ABV on this one because the alcohol is incredibly well masked.  M: Medium carbonation added a slight prickliness to what would have otherwise been a very smooth mouth. Medium/full bodied.  D: A very tasty brew. I love coffee but the sheer power of the bitter coffee acidic aftertaste got to me a little at first. When the drink warmed up and the flavor profile balance changed, it all made more sense. My word, the folks at Founders know how to deliver a massive taste with masterful balance.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,alovesupreme,3.95,"Poured very dark into a small Samuel Smith glass, great head with fair retention.  Tons and tons of cofffee, the sumatra stands out. A little alcohol is also present.  Tons of bitter coffee. Very roasted taste, with some hops in the mix. A little chocolate and a bitter roasted aftertaste.  Not as much carbonation as I would like due to the oats, but the mouthfeel is very thick and syrupy.  Excellent beer due to its bold characteristics and complexities, But one beer is alot to handle.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,RThomas436,4.97,Holy shit this is incredible. Pours black and looks like thick syrup - saying it looks like oil is an understatement.  The nose has coffee some slight chocolate and more coffee.  Drinks like velvet - like literally drinking a glass of velvet smooth slightly bitter with a coffee finish.  This is a great beer for a chilly evening but not so heavy that you don't want to have any more.  This is what Willis was talking about i.e. What you talkin 'bout Willis?,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Big aroma of roasted malts, espresso, tobacco, and dark chocolate.  The taste presents dark chocolate, dark ripe fruit, vanilla, espresso, roasted malts, and oatmeal. Finish is a bit like burnt chocolate. The 8% alcohol is well hidden.  Heavy bodied, thick and creamy, and lightly carbonated.  This was my first Breakfast Stout from Founders. A great drinking Impy.

Slight notes of earthy/noble hops.  This is a thick beer to say the least. Huge creamy mouthfeel. No doubt from the oatmeal used in this. There are lots of chocolate tastes left on the tongue and a burnt feel that is no way unpleasant. Everything is so smooth and appealing.  The aftertaste is soothing and a bit spicy. There is a slight alcohol presence in the nose and taste as the beer warms. The chocolate and coffee become more apparent and the taste become smoother than I thought possible.

1199,11757,JerzDevl2000,4.5,"Picked this up as soon as I found out that this was back in stock in my neck of the woods. I heard a lot of good things about this beer, and have never seen, let alone tasted, a breakfast stout. After nearly downing most of my pint glass, I'm not sure if I'd have this for breakfast, but I'm sure that this is one of the most unique and delicious beers that I've had in quite some time!  This had a dark pour but not as thick as a Russian Imperial Stout. There was a little bit of head and practically no lacing to go along with this. The smell was a wonderful blend of dark chocolate, toffee, and of course, oatmeal, with the mouthfeel combining all of those notes with the thickness of the oatmeal and the alcoholic taste of fermented chocolate. It's basically a cross between the old Troegs Oatmael Stout and the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Yes, the alcohol can be felt here, especially in the aftertaste. Nevertheless, it's not overpowering and the roasted, espresso-like consistancy that wonderfully holds everything together!  This is a strong beer, but the alcohol is never overpowering. I don't think I'd specifically have this for breakfast, but there wouldn't be a time of day where I'd pass this up! This was well worth the wait and effort to find - Founders has carved a very unique niche with this beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ommegoose,3.7,"Pours out very thick and dark, and forms a creamy mocha colored head. Leaves a pretty good sheet of lacing.  Smells like milk chocolate. Some oat character. Smooth roastiness.  I really like how this one starts, but it falls apart at the end for me. Roasty flavors lead, backed by sweet and bittersweet chocolate. Coffee is inconspicuous, which is disappointing consider that's supposed to be a calling card of this brew. The back end and finish is messy. Acidic and surprisingly bitter with too much leafy hop. Finishes dry and more bitter than I would hope. Not a lot of alcohol presence, but it shows up from time to time.  Smooth body, with a nice amount of fullness. Not as smooth as Souther Tier Oat, probably the benchmark for mouthfeel for a stout. Carbonation is pleasantly low.  Drinks alright. I can't muster up all that much excitement about this. Did not meet my expectations, and is really not a very good value. Not something I'll run out to buy anytime soon. Lack of coffee was a major disappointment. Best enjoyed when I just took a few sips and didn't think about it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S: massive aromas of roasted malts, coffee, bitter chocolate, some burnt toffee. strong hop aroma.  T: huge roasted malt flavors, coffee and chocolate mostly. hints of black cherries in the back of the palate. definitely pulling some oatmeal, due to the smoothness of the beer.

Full flavor and not that bitter, though not sweet at all.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and viscous.  Drinkability: Extremely drinkable though &gt; 8 ABV.

A nice foamy, dark tan head about 1/2 inch that dissolves rapidly. Good lacing along the glass.  S - mostly smells of chocolate and coffee and is quite pleasant. Also plenty hints of roasted malts.  T - I think I stared at this beer for 10 minutes before I took my first sip. Initial taste is predominately burnt coffee. After taste is bitter and lots of chocolate. Some hints of malts that aren't as noticeable as coffee and chocolate.  M - Oh man is this a thick beverage. Not that I have ever had car oil in my mouth, but if I had to guess I would compare to this. I was actually T-Day stuffed after I finished.  D - Fairly high ABV that limits drinkability although the alcohol is well hidden with the other great flavors.

Smell is chocolate, wierdly it has a vegetable smell to it, honestly its like the canned peas I ate while growing up. Definate espresso.  Taste is where the hype comes in, this is some good shit! Espresso without a doubt, chocolate up the yin-yang. Some fruit presence as well. All of these are complete flavors and not little subtle pieces, this is the real deal.

1199,11757,LordofTime25,4.7,The blackest stout I have ever seen. Thin cream tan head that leaves good lacing on the glass.  Smells of strongly of chocolate and coffee.  You taste a strong coffee taste up front then it transition to a strong chocolate taste that finishes with a slight bitterness. Complex!  A creamy full bodied delight to your mouth.  Yummy! Delisous!

Chocolate, coffee, and strong roasted notes. Earthy. There's even a tobacco note here. Damn that's nice.  Taste is very strong dark roast coffee. Chocolate. A hint of vanilla. Nowhere near as sweet as I anticipated. There's a strong earthy tobacco-like note that sticks around on the finish. Fantastic.  Mouth is milky, oily and voluptuous.  Drinkability is nothing short of amazing. 8.3 abv is completely undetectible and were I not aware of the alcohol content I could probably put back a few of these.  This is a real knockout.

It has a thick, rich chocolate and coffee scent along with a bit of oatmeal dryness. The taste is awesome. Just like the KBS, it's loaded with malt complexity and tremendous mouthfeel. The chocolate and coffee character is huge up front and finishes with a bit of oatmeal mouthfeel. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This stuff is the nectar of the gods.

1199,11757,bonkers,3.68,"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer is aviscous, motor oil like brew. The tan head is very thin, and very sticky. The smell is an overpowering aroma of roasted coffee beans. The taste follows the nose, which I do not enjoy as much as I had hoped. It leaves a pleasant enough coffee after taste, but something seems missing. The beer is definitely a full bodied sipper. Breakfast stout is a decent enough beer, but it is not for me. I normally drink 3 cups of coffee a day, but maybe I want something different in my beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Big shot of dark roasted coffee wrapped in dark chocolate. Maybe a little burnt around the edges. Very rich.  Smooth, slick, oily. A mix of oatmeal and imperial mouthfeels.

1199,11757,PittBeerGirl,3.92,"Finally found this one at Vintage Wine and Estates in Boardman, OH.  A- Has a cloudy dark brown, nearly back body that pours with a 1 finger or so mocha colored creamy head. Head eventually fades to &lt;1/2 finger but leaves traces of lacing all the way down the glass.  S-Rich dark chocolate malts and toffee balanced with a nice roasted malt character. Nose is on the sweet side but rich and balanced.  T-The roasted malt notes come through much more in the flavor and are actually the highlight. Roasted dark chocolate malt upfront with some accents of bitter coffee and sweet caramel. The finish is a balance of roasted bitterness and characters mentioned in the nose. What lingers is a big roasted dark malt bitterness and hints of coffee, toffee, and a caramel sweetness.  M- Medium carbonation and thick, somewhat syrupy mouthfeel. As expected for a imperial stout.  D-The ABV is not detectable at all in this brew. Actually the roasted character is definitely the highlight. The smell is immaculate but the taste is more roasted than I like but still good.

Hardly any head is produced, what's there is a light brown that's almost frothy when swirled. Smells almost perfect. A nice balance between the roastedness and bittersweet chocolate. The taste is almost perfect. The chocolate holds up to the roasted malts, but the coffee could be a little stronger. When it hits your tongue it has a good amount of carbonation and leaves a silky feeling. The 8.3 abv makes this more drinkable than it should be.

It pours a very dark dark dark brown, almost black but with those brown hints. The head, which there was very little was a dark tan color. The smell is very coffee with some very nice sweet notes you also get a nice mix of roasted malts. Overall the aroma is fabulous and very complex. The taste matches the aroma nicely. Lots of sweet coffee tastes up front, the carbonation hits your tongue very nicely and then you get a very clean chocolate taste. In the after taste the roasted malt flavors get you big time. Over all great taste, I almost wish the coffee was a little more, it might of helped the mouthful feel a little less sticky and more refreshing. Highly drinkable for it being 8.3% ABV.

Completely different beer than I have had out the bottle. That being said, seek this one out on tap. Well worth it.  Delivered with a 1/4 inch of caramel head sitting on pitch black liquid. Lacing is thich as it drinks down. Smells of roasted malt, heavy cream and hint of coffee. The creaminess really comes through in the mouth and balances out with the acridness. This is what i found most enjoyable. The cream taste melded the flavors together incredibly. Finishes dry but sweet (not cloying) on the tongue. I would enjoy more than one. On a side note, I enjoyed the last half with flourless chocolate cake and it paired as expected.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Wetpaperbag,4.5,"A very huge thanks to tprokop7 for this one. I've wanted this for a long time. I've had the KBS and wanted to try this one and see how they compared.  A- When I was pouring this beer it was pouring thick, like oil thick. Wow very impressive. There was very little head, and what was there faded into the darkness of the beer. This gives the Abyss a run for its money in terms of darkness. Its like there is a void in my glass with mocha lacing as an accent.  S- Wonderful roasted malts, dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee are having a great time together. The smells come one after another and mix back and forth, its wonderful.  T- The taste is great. This is a solid breakfast stout. Very great roasted malt profile that isn't too smoaky or burnt. The chocolate is there, but as more of a supporting character to help sweeten out the bitterness the coffee brings to the breakfast table. The alcohol is very well hidden. This is a great tasting beer.  M- Now despite looking like it was something that could be leaking out of my 1954 Chevy Bel Air, this beer was thinner then I was expecting. Based on the look of the pour, this looked as though I was going to have to chew this beer. This wasn't so much the case. Don't get me wrong it has some viscosity to it for sure, but not as much as I was expecting.

1199,11757,doppelmeup,4,"The first comment I have about this beer is to make sure you let it warm before drinking. The drinking experience improves dramatically as this beer warms. If I were to close my eyes when smelling this beer, I would swear I was smelling a fresh brewed cup of coffee. Bittersweet cocoa and fresh ground coffee beans prevail. It is black as night, with a cinnamon (yes, the label is very accurate) colored head that is slow to build and leaves bits of lace dotting the sides of the tulip glass all the way down. As I drink this, I am reminded of dark chocolated covered espresso bean candies. Bitter cocoa followed by a bitter coffee flavor. A slight hint of alcohol is also present. Mouthfeel is fairly thick, with a definite warming all the way down. The flavor clings to my mouth, not wanting to really disappear even after several minutes. Overall, I had quite high expectations for this beer. I can't say it has let me down, but I am also not sure that it is the best big stout I have had.

What I like is that you can distinctly pick out each one of those flavors. They go well together, neither one dominating the other.  M: Poured thicker then the actually feel...but a good full-bodied beer.  D: Exceptional...could have half a six pack in one helping.

There are some subtle hints of dried fruits.  taste - Delicious coffee flavor blended with chocolate -- like liquid tiramisu. In each sip, coffee and cocoa flavors gradually yield to a long, slightly bitter finish. I'm not sure how much of that bitterness is from the coffee and how much is from the hops.  mouthfeel - Thick and syrupy, with a pleasant creaminess from the oatmeal.  drinkability - If it wasn't so hard to come by here on the East Coast, I wouldn't mind sipping on a couple of these over a few hours, so it gets high marks.

1199,11757,WanderingFool,4.23,"At last! I finally got my hands on some Founders Breakfast Stout thanks to a kind beer store owner who saved me a 4-pack from the one case he received.  The beer pours a thick, inky black into the glass with a small frothy brown head on top. The foam dissolves slowly to a sheet on the beer leaving behind clumps of lace on the glass.  The aroma has strong notes of coffee with hints of chocolate and roasted malt blended in. Each sip of this full bodied beer has a firm carbonated snap on the tip of the tongue. It's silky smooth on the palate and finishes dry. The flavor is full of coffee. Mixed in are notes of chocolate and roasted malt. At the end hints of nuts and a mild bitterness poke through. However, the bitterness could be coming from the chocolate or coffee and not the hops. Once gone the coffee flavor lingers on the palate.  For an 8.3% beer this one is easy to drink. I couldn't detect any alcohol in the nose or the flavor. I really liked this beer, but I'd like to see more balance with the coffee and chocolate. The flavor was pretty much 80% coffee with some other tastes mixed in.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

It leaves you with a coffee taste after you have swallowed, yet only for a second.  The mouthfeel is good somewhat heavy, not crisp, representative of a stout.

Served a little bit too cold (out of the fridge 15-20 minutes) so a strong poor did not give much head. 1/2 inch light brown head on top of the blackest beer I have had; no light gets through even on the edge.  Smells like a coffee stout should--fresh coffee and roasted malt. No alcohol on the nose.  As a huge coffee fan, the taste makes me very happy. Rich coffee flavor dominates. Some roasted malt taste but this can't keep pace...and I don't care. Hard to pick up any hops, although the roasted flavors give a nice bitterness on the back of the tongue. Chocolate is picked up as sweetness, but is not a prominent flavor.  Mouthfeel is medium and very smooth. Some stickiness as well. This is how a stout should be.  Despite &gt;8% ABV, this is fairly easy to drink. For me, I could drink this all day except for the $16 price tag for a 4 pack. Last year's purchase lasted nearly the whole year, and the beer only got better with cellaring.

S - Huge aroma of burnt coffee upfront, but there's a bit of bitter chocolate alcohol in the background. Maybe a hint of wood in there as well.  T - Again with the burnt coffee. It's not entirely unpleasant, but it is very dominant. Some chocolate tries to pull through near the finish but is quickly overrun by a moderate alcohol presence. Try as I might, I can't pick up much flavor in this stuff beyond the coffee.  M - The oats make for a very thick and silky body, but the carbonation remains just a little too high to full enjoy what the body could be.  D - Too much damn coffee and booze. Not a bad beer, but not a great one either, certainly not something I'll buy more of or revisit in the near future.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,phattysbox,4.52,"Thanks to clockworkorange for the extra!!  Poured 12oz bottle into snifter. Black, black and more black. Thick oily pour that delivers only a thin whispy lace - not a bad thing since the oat makes it so thick.  Smells initially of coffee followed by delicate chocolate and sweet malts. Very nice! Some vanilla pulls through and there is a slight warming alcohol in the nose. Taste is freshly brewed espresso and chocolate and bitterness that is probably more due to coffee/choc than the hops. The malt background is huge and balances out the coffee flavors nicely. Viscous, thick, and velvety from the oat makes the body very nice.  This brew is better when it has warmed up in my opinion, however torwards the end the coffee notes were getting a bit cloying, which brought the drinkability down for me. This might not be a bad thing, but I drank this at night right before bed and got me racing a touch.  All in all the best coffee stout I have ever had!  Seek and enjoy!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,PBoegel,4.52,"When RIS crashes into Oatmeal Stout and adds a little coffee and chocolate you should get sensory overload, but you get balance and wow.  Breakfast should only be so delicious everyday.  The rich aromas of espresso, bitter chocolates and caramelized and dried fruits just flow out of the glass. I get a particular rise of the taste of oats and their creamy mouth feel in the flavor presentation.  A lot of truly great big stouts in my opinion use wheat and rye to add complexity to the body and taste, amping up the oat is fantastic.  A truly worthwhile to seek out brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,champ103,4.7,"A big thanks to Deuane for this one.  A: Pours an opaque black color. A small tan head forms, and recedes to a rim. I did not expect much here. Though some great sticky, spiderweb lace is left behind. S: Dark roasted malt with coffee, chocolate and some alcohol. A nice aroma, but standard stout and not as aromatic as I would like. T: Lots of dark roasted malt again. Coffee and some dry chocolate flavors. A large oatmeal flavor that I love, and seemed to be absent in the nose. This wonderful taste lingers on forever, and no one flavor stands out and overpowers everything else. Simply amazing! M/D: A full body. It is exceptionally creamy, rich, and smooth. All the flavors are so well balanced and complex, which IMO, makes this amazingly easy to drink. I wish this would never end.  Om, ya, this is a damn good beer. Pretty much everything you want in a stout. The hype is well deserved.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,jraycee,4.47,"This showed up this week at my local beer store. Great to see it locally. Pours black with about an inch of brown head that shows a little retention before fading into a thick crown. Smelly like coffee, oak, and bitter chocolate. Taste follows same guidelines coffee first followed by wood, pine, oats, unsweeteend chocolate, and right back to strong black coffee. You know the kind of coffee thats been brewed way too strong then left on the burner for a couple days. The oats really give this brew a smooth velvety mouthfeel. The light carbonation is great for the style too. Where's the alcohol? It's so nicely hidden I almost forgot its an 8.3%!

The smell is of coffee and loads of toasted malts. The taste has a big oatmeal flavor with an even larger coffee flavor. It might be a little undercarbonated but the mouthfeel was wonderful.

Immediately hits you with an espresso aroma, and some bitter chocolate. This stuff is not kidding around.  Thick and chewy, tastes of dark espresso and bitter chocolate. Perhaps some cereal. Burnt acrid bitterness. Hint of licorice. It really does seem like it would be appropriate for breakfast. Personally, not my thing, it tastes like espresso in a beer bottle with some alcohol and much thickness. Its like drinking an oil slick. No balance. At least it covers the high alcohol content.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,bigkahunas4,4.57,"Poured into a tulip glass - thin tan head and fudgey black body. Not much retention but some decent lacing. Smell was of coffee and caramel. My girlfriend kept stealing the glass from me between sips to take in the aromatics.  Taste was excellent, mainly coffee with some chocolate. Also caught a bit of smokiness which was quite nice. Alcohol is completely masked. Was light yet creamy at the same time.. really had an exception consistency.  I loved this, and probably would call it my favorite stout up until this point. Whereas I feel some stouts go over the top with chocolate or coffee - this one really came off as simply awesome beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Matty1918,4.29,"Thanks to csmiley for this sample.  Poured into a pint glas.  Pours a deep black with a thin, brown creamy head. Not much head retention but some lacing.  Great aroma of coffee up front with traces of chocolate also. Smells just like a mocha shake.  First sip is of coffee. It tastes just like coffe that was fresh brewed, then put in the fridge to get cold. A nice subtle smokey flavor too. A faint hint of chocolate is there too.  The alcohol is well hidden in this baby. Not much carbonation but overall this is an enjoyable brew. I would buy this again in a second.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Shumista,4.58,"Poured half of the 12 oz. bottle I'm sharing into my snifter. A- Pours a syrupy jet black with an impressive looking dark brown head. (This actually may be the darkest head I've ever seen on a beer.) S- Very intense aroma. Lots of coffee, bitter chocolate and roasted malts. T- So much flavor here, this beer is a dessert just by itself. Dark, bitter chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and a lingering bitterness at the end. Extremely balanced. M- Thick and creamy. With everything else going on in this beer it would be easy to miss the creamy smoothness imparted on it from being an oatmeal stout. There is also a pleasant slightly noticeable alcohol presence as the beer warms. I really couldn't think of a better beer to sip after a great meal. D- I wouldn't want more than one of these but I'm still giving it a high drinkability because of how easy it goes down.  Bottom Line: The best, most well balanced imperial stout I've had to date.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Beautiful bubbly yet subdued head.This beer just looks like it tastes good.  Smell: Reminds me of chocolate chips and coffee which is a plus. However, the alcohol doesn't seem to be masked very well. Might just be because I had a big night of drinking and alcohol is not very appealing right now. Might have rated the smell higher under different conditions.  Taste: Oats, chocolate and coffee. It really does taste like breakfast. While I could smell the alcohol, there is very little alcohol taste.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy and almost no burning from the alcohol at all.  Drinkability: I could drink this all day. It looks a little daunting at first but there is no unpleasant aftertaste and the mouthfeel is excellent.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

You can get sandwiches here, and enjoy a beer. My beer of choice was Founders. Poured into a stylish crystal wine glass. Color was black as tar. Not much carbonation. Decent sized head that faded quickly. Smell was of delicious roasted coffee and chocolate. Taste was fantastic. Tons of deep, dark flavors of wood, cocoa, and coffee. Nice and thick mouthfeel too, which is the way all Imperial Stouts should be. This is not a beer that you can drink quickly, though. It was a nice and slow brew to savor with a nice sandwich and to sip on long after I was done with my meal.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,NCBeernut,4.87,"Opaque black. Old oil isn't even this black. Brown head, the color of coffee with a little bit of cream; decent retention for over 8%. Exactly what I expected.  Smell/Taste: Freshly ground coffee that you can smell if you are within 2 feet of this beer. Wonderful rich coffee aroma...maybe a more citrusy variety of coffee, maybe its just the hops. Dark chocolate. A touch of sweet aromas. Decadent. Coffee is still amazing in the taste. Nothing artificial tasting anywhere in this beer. I can't even imagine how much coffee they used to brew this. Chocolate is semi-sweet in the taste, and blends perfectly with the deep roasted flavors, which get a little help from the coffee. Soft citric notes come through a bit too...I think they are actually from the hops. I could make this my breakfast every day.  Mouthfeel: Silky and creamy. A little bite on the finish from the bitterness and roasted flavors contributed by the coffee...and maybe a little from the hops. Thick and chewy. Just what I was looking for.  Drinkability: A sipper, but what else could you expect. Do it justice. Still surprisingly easy to drink for what it packs.  The perfect breakfast beer. One of, if not THE best stout I have had. The caffiene from the coffee is noticeable, which I also like. I plan on keeping this in my regular rotation.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,jeremyd365,4.42,"Finally got to try this one--I've been looking forward to it for awhile. Poured an oily black with just the slightest remnants of a darker brown head. It smells deliciously of coffee and chocolate. It doesn't feel too thick-bodied and the flavor is wonderous--an explosion of cappicino, coffee, and chocolate, wit an aftertaste that lingers. This is a very drinkable and delicious imperial stout and I would highly recommend this one. I'll have to make sure I grab a 4-pack before they sell out for the season!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,bound4er,3.48,"My first Founders - very excited that it's Breakfast Stout. This stuff pours black - it doesn't let any light shine through it either. A hard pour produced about 1/4"" light brown head that fades fairly quickly. Some light wispy lacing remains.  It smells great - lots of roasted malt, coffee (with vanilla creamer added) and a caramelized brown sugar note.  The taste is a pretty big let down from the smell and appearance. Lots of bitterness - the detracting upfront kind that doesn't allow much flavor through. The bitterness hangs around on the finish too along with a hit of C2H5OH.  The beer does redeem itself with a thick, rich mouthfeel and moderate carbonation.  The bitterness keeps its drinkability down - I am not looking forward to my next sip - a bad sign for any beer.  Maybe this beer does need aging - I am not impressed at this point. I will revisit in a month or two.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,ThreeWiseMen,4.55,"Shout out to fogdog for hooking me up with this beast!  Appearance: Pours a heavy and slick, very earthy-colored black with a slow-forming brown head. This pour reminds me a lot of Ten Fidy. The head seems crawl from the murky depths, then breed and multiply. After reaching it's peak of about a quarter inch, the head dies back down leaving a skin of lace where it once was.  Smell: I can smell the dark chocolate and coffee from several feet away. As I approach, that same smell intensifies. Oats, butter, toffee, and burnt toast add to the mix. 'Breakfast Stout' seems to be a very suiting name.  Taste: Keeping with the breakfast theme, this taste seems to go from chocolate chip pancakes, to black coffee, to fudgesicles (not breakfast, but I definitely taste it). There's a great buttery-toffee flavor that seems to cover everything, yet it's nowhere near dominant. Finish is somewhat dry and bitter, with a pretty strong oat character.  Mouthfeel: Thick and chewy and very smooth. Carbonation is mild. Great warming. Somewhat slick. Really, really, enjoyable!  Drinkability: I want another, but I don't know if I have any more room in my belly. I was starving when I cracked this thing open, and now, three-quarters of the way through, I'm getting full.

A band of foam coalesced around the shoulders of the glass. Some lacing present during the tasting, but weak legs. Nose is coffee beans, brown sugar, malt and a grapefruit sweetness (weird and out of place, but I picked it up nonetheless). Taste follows nose as well as oats. Mouthfeel is medium and lightly effervescent. Could have had a little more body for the style. Finish was also a bit chalky. All and all, easy drinking and flavorful without being overly sweet. Alcohol was well-hidden. I'd make this a staple if it were more readily available. This beer definitely lived up to my expectations.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BDIMike,4.34,"Pours a completely black, oil color. There is very little carbonation that creates a thin, brown colored lace atop the crew. Smell has a very strong coffee bean smell to it. There is also a good amount oats in the smell and a bit of chocolate also. Taste is very strong with the fresh coffee beans and oats. Chocolate malts are prevalent with a good hop taste at the end of the sip. Mouthfeel has a nice smoothness with a very thin liquid. Leaves a bit of a chewiness in the mouth. Drinkability is very nice for such a complex beer. There is a good amount of coffee and oat and chocolate, but the subtle hop flavors are what keep the malts from overpowering your tastebuds. Very nice combination of tastes and a beer that would be great for any occassion, especially on a nice cold weather day.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,MMAJYK,4.7,"A- Pitch black with 2"" of milk chocolatey head; very fluffy and pillowy. The lacing is very thick down the sides of my large snifter. The perfect glass to welcome the expected outstanding beer in. I have had a lot of stouts but this one looks exceptional the way it threw up the nice head.  S- Very sweet from the malts. Chocolate malt, coffee malt, light black patent. Very creamy, caramel like, roasty, smoky, and a nice scent of brown sugar spiced oatmeal. The alcohol warms you if inhaled deeply, but well hidden if you are not digging so deep. This is one of the most amazing, welcoming smells I have ever witnessed in a beer.  T- Following closely to the nose with all the same malts. The smoke is a little more pronounced in the taste and is quite welcome to add to the balance of the sweetness. Very milky and creamy, like coffee that has been sweetened and a splash of creamer thrown in. The coffee lingers around in the end adding to the complexity. No alcohol to speak of in the taste; super well hidden for sure.  M- Thick and creamy like a bowl of oatmeal. The carbonation is quite high for the style, but I like it just fine.  D- Off of the charts for me. This is one amazing beer. I seriously could drink this beer all day on a cold, winter day. However, I think you would not make it very long with the punch this baby hits you with. Absolutely AMAZING!  To be fair, I matched this beer with dinner this evening; breakfast food. It consisted of: Biscuits and Gravy (an old Southern thing), scrambled cheese eggs, sausage, and bacon. Whether or whether not it was the food making this beer taste so damn good, I don't know, but I will say the pairing was PERFECT and I recommend it to anyone on a cold fall or winter evening.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ABHatter,4.2,"Conservative pour into Grand Marnier snifter produces a very tiny head which vanishes quickly leaving a coffee ice cream colored ring around the edges which seems to last throughout the entire glass.  A- Pitch black color with a quality consistency. I attempted to shine a keychain flashlight through the liquid, But just as I thought there was no shining through whatsoever.  S- Coffee! And tons of it. No this isn't your typical supermarket crap or Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks etc. This is some super kick ass coffee!!! I am starting to pickup a mild Mocha smell but the chocolate is very subtle, which harmonizes quite nicely with the exteme Java smell. Grinds and a touch of alcohol round out the nose of this tasty elixir.  T&M- Bitter dark chocolate, molasses, powdered cocoa & oats all match up well with the extreme Java rush. Mouthfeel is a little thick. Brief sweetness mid palate leaving a roasted creamy finish.  D-Quite good actually. It wouldn't be a problem consuming two of these consecutively.  I was lucky enough to find this the other day, So i picked up a couple of four packs. (Glad I DID!!)

1199,11757,ColoradoBobs,4.15,"My 400th review.  A pair of bottles, as shown, courtesy of shbobdb: one from 2005 and one from 2007. Side-by-side.  Upon pouring, the difference was obvious: the 2005 produced a huge head -- I couldn't get the whole 12-ounce bottle into my pint glass -- while the 2007 produced only a small cap. Both left ample lacing, however, bespeaking a pretty thick beer. Both had absolutely opaque brown-black body. Head was the same color: dark tan-yellow and tight.  The foundational aroma was pretty much the same for both: espresso, molasses, hoar-hound drop, rich oatmeal-cookie-dough. The 2007 had a sharper smell, however, with more citrus and pine hops evident, and a bit of ripe olive. The 2005 was notably more mellow, with softer and sweeter chocolate in evidence.  Taste was a bit of a let-down for both. Not as strong as the aroma. Espresso was there, along with molasses, and mild chocolate. The 2007 naturally had more hop presence than the 2005, but very little rich-oatmeal-cookie dough. The 2005 was much smoother.  Mouthfeel was also thinner than I was expecting for both, with the 2005 being marginally richer than the 2007.  Drinkability was good on both.  Overall, a worthy beer for review #400. Not nearly as good as the Kentucky Breakfast Stout, but still pretty fine. Thanks again to shbobdb for the mini-vertical.

While this isn't a bad brew at all, the 2008 just doesn't hold a candle to last years batch.

1199,11757,cvstrickland,4.63,"12-ounce cellar-cool twist-off topped stubby, poured into a large tulip glass, yields an opaque brown-black body with a cap of fine-bubbled mocha foam. Held against the growing morning sunlight, not a single solar photon penetrates the edges of the elixir, and the head recedes slowly into a thick sheet that leaves swatches of lacing on the glass.  The smell of the drink is potent and roasty, with acrid burnt notes, winey, dark roasted black coffee, dry black malt, and an undertone of baker's chocolate. Black coffee smells less coffee-like than Founder's Breakfast Stout does.  The taste is sweetly malty with dark, powdery cocoa and oily espresso. Husky oatmeal provides heft to the body, even as tangy notes of burnt barley and fine coffee bitterness play off the soft malty backbone, smacking it to the side, eventually dominating the drink. Sweeter, softer, and more mocha-milk-chocolatey as the drink warms.  Breakfast Stout is silky-smooth and full-bodied with light carbonation and the feel of a cool café au lait with just a bit of hearty grittiness from the oats. Succulent.  After waiting so long for Founders to arrive here in NC, I must admit my expectations for the goodness of this so-called 'Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout' were most likely unrealistically high... but the funny thing is that this big fat coffee-bomb of a brew happily blew those high-hopes and pie-in-the-sky expectations away.

1199,11757,jamsmad,4.88,"Got this at A-Wines up in Inman Square in Cambridge. It was the day before my birthday so when I saw it I knew I needed to just take the plunge and spend the money on it.  Opened the first bottle the morning of my birthday to enjoy a breakfast stout with breakfast before classes. With small sips it tastes just like a mocha coffee but with larger tastes it gets more complex. It starts out sweet, almost like a milk stout, then transitions slowly to a rich, bitter coffee flavor. The coffee aftertaste is ridiculous, like I'm still drinking the beer. Overall the beer is one of my favorites I've ever tasted (can't say it's one of my favorite beers though, it's too scarce in MA to say that). I count myself lucky that I decided to buy the 4 pack, can't wait to have more.  Now I just need to get my hands on a Kentucky Breakfast Stout...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smell alone is intoxicating..Coffee, chocolate, and a big hop punch.  First taste is complicated...it swirls around your mouth hinting at all it has to offer. Chocolate first a creamy hop second and a nice burst of coffee in the aftertaste.  Drinkability is good for the style.  I see why this brew has a following it does. Well done Founders.

Breakfast Stout is a big reason why. And now I have my hands on it again.  I won't go beer nerd on you. I will just tell you this beer is outstanding. It's exactly what it says it is: a Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout. And it's perfect. Not too much of anything. Easily the best stout I've ever had. It's just as good in the bottle as I remember it from the source.  Stout lovers, get this beer... at any cost.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The key difference to me was that it was quite a bit hoppier on tap, and the coffee was not quite as strong. Coffee was still there, for sure, but didn't seem quite as prominent as the fresh, bottled version. I liked the increased hoppiness, but overall I didn't like it quite as much as the bottled version.

Some sweetness in the smell along with bitter chocolate and coffee.  Up front the taste is full of coffee and bitter chocolate with lots of sweetness from the oats in the middle more chocolate in the end. Not boozy at all. Well balance.  Really nice mouthfeel, thick and creamy.  I can't pick up on any alcohol at all in here, which makes its rather drinkable for its ABV.

S: Big, big coffee aroma, along with malt and chocolate.  T: Like the smell, the taste was fairly big. Coffee, chocolate, malt, a little hops and a sugary presence. Not overly complex, but definitely pleasing to the palate.  M: A high level of carbonation and a somewhat slick finish. Full-bodied.  D: This is an excellent beer.

1199,11757,rhinos00,4.37,"Poured this beer from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.  A- the complexion of this beer was dark black with absolutely no visibility; after the pour a mocha-colored head appeared that quickly dissipated after a few seconds; a constant thin layer of mocha head remained as the beer was consumed and laced the sides of snifter.  S- the initial smell is dominated by bitter roasted coffee beans followed by a hint of sweetness.  T- like the smell, roasted coffee beans dominate. As it goes down there is a subtle taste of sweet mocha that follows.  M- very deceptive; the dark complexion makes it seem as if the beer will be thick; to my surprise the beer was thinner and smooth in texture, almost like an iced coffee; little to no carbonation.  D- I will admit, I am not a stout drinker. however, this beer is quite delicious and I can probably manage to drink 2 of these in a sitting based on taste alone.  Overall, it is a quality beer.

A mocha colored head grows from the darkness as I pour it into my glass and eventually settles to a whisper of a collar.  Smells both bitter and sweet. Baking chocolate, roasted malts, espresso beans, and burnt sugar.  My initial impression is, Wow! lots of coffee. The feel is thinner than expected, but smooth and milky. Intensely roasted bitterness, but underneath runs a sweet chocolate malt flavor. I was hoping for greater depth, complexity and a more full feel.  Very drinkable as the alcohol is nowhere is the scent or taste, but found in the growing warmth of my chest. I would enjoy this quite a bit post breakfast.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smells of coffee, milk chocolate, roasted malt, molasses, oats, and some alcohol but not much. Tastes of molasses, roasted malt and oatmeal, coffee, chocolate syrup, espresso beans, and slight sherry notes. Full bodied with good carbonation. Smooth and creamy with great balance of bitter and sweet. Definitely a beer I can't pass up if I find it on tap.

1199,11757,JamesS,3.47,"Pours a very deep black color with a very thin layer of initial, tan head that goes away quickly, and it also has very little lacing. Nice scent, the chocolate dominates, although there is a nice hint of coffee, although with very little burnt grain scent and a near undetectable (barely there) oatmeal scent. Very nice flavor, the different pieces come together very well, with chocolate on top, a nice coffee kick, followed by the oatmeal sweetness; I personally find it hard to think the flavors can completely mesh, but this did a good job of it. This beer is also very smooth and silky, very nice and barely rough from the relatively high ABV.  To be honest there are better stouts out there that you can get year around and are cheaper, but it's still well worth the try, even at its higher cost.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,bluemoonswoon,4.3,"12oz stubby brown bottle, poured into a brandy snifter.  A: Pours that standard, jet black, inky dark, midnight on a moonless night kind of deal that is pretty much standard for imperial stouts. The viscosity seems a bit low, coming out of the bottle at least, but picks up a bit when I swirll it around in the glass and after ever sip as the liquid slowly sinks down to join the rest of the beer. Long story short, this beer has some decent legs. Head forms quick and thick, a good half inch of mocha colored, pillowy soft bubbles. However, the head fades down into a cap not long after, but still manages to leave behind some spotty lacing. Not bad, but certainly not great, I've seen stouts much larger than this still manage to muster up some considerable retention and lacing that far outpaces what is being offered up here. Still though the overall presentation is beguiling.  S: In a word: dry. Dry, mildly floral hoppiness, coupled with cold pressed coffee grounds, bitter chocolate and a suprisingly sweet milkiness, which becomes more pronouced as the beer warms.  T/MF: While I think Peche Mortel has this one beat on taste and feel, Breakfast Stout does not dissapoint. It brings the coffee like not many other stouts can, while still retaining a good deal of complexity. There is coffee here and lots of it, but there is also tobacoo and licorice. This beer is also a great deal drier than other coffee stouts I've come across, not nearly as dry as Beer Geek Breakfast, but dry and constricting nonetheless. While this is not a bad thing, it is also not an entirely good thing as it detracts just a bit from the mouthfeel, which feels chalky at times, and the puckering of the taste buds covers up an otherwise complex beer.  D: An easy sipper, a real joy to drink. Goes great with a football game at night and no work the next morning. Makes for a very relaxing drinking experience, something that other beers seem to lack at times. That is to say, this is a beer that makes you want to take your time, makes you want to hold on and get everything you can out of it before the bottle is gone.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Still this looks formidable.  The coffee and bittersweet chocolate dominate with a little oatmeal and mega-roasted malt texture. Hop grass complements nicely.  Very complex texture of deep-roasted malt, coffee and natural, unsweetened chocolate. Chocolate further syncs up with a mild oatmeal texture to provide an austere and dry but painfully compelling stout profile.  There's nothing, I repeat...NOTHING bad about the mouthfeel on this one. Rich yet dry and even clean for something so huge. Full finish gives off a little oatmeal chocolate chip sweetness. Definitely Beautiful Chemistry working here.

Smell: The smell was weak with only the faintest sweetness that I would smell in an RIS, mostly it was the roasted malt I presume giving it the odor along with the coffee of course, of astringent very dark roasted malt.  Taste andMouthfeel: Lightly sweet in the front, and the roasted malt, very dark hammers you the rest of the way with a black coffee aftertaste. The coffee is everpresent but muddy, never really distinct. The feel is smooth and the more you work it the smoother it gets. For the price I'll take the Old Rasputin or a Sammy Smith anyday of the week.

Smell wise for me was freshly ground gourmet coffee (mmm....). The taste was exceptional. Upon the first sip was a very high coffe note which seemed to linger as I let the beer sit for awhile. One thing I did find was after it warmed up a bit the chocolate notes came out a little more.

S: The smell is of chocolate and coffee - great selections of each - with some mollasses. There's an underlying earthiness and vague fruitiness.  T: The taste is of rich, ROASTED coffee, rich chocolate - bittersweet. Light roast and bitterness balance sweetness. A touch of milk seems to come through as it progresses. Rich and complex with a slight acidic touch.  M: Rich, creamy full-body that is smooth.  D: Impressive offering, I'll have to try some more Founders.

T= This stout started with a bitter roasted coffee bite, followed by a short burst of sweet chocolate, then back to the acidic and oak-like bitterness. Alcohol warmed the chest and belly after each swallow.  MF= Lower carbonation and a medium body gave this one a silky feel. The body was just a tad too light in my opinion.

In short, its one damn fine looking beer. The aroma is incredible. Roasted coffee is dominant but there is more going on here, there is a bit of fudge as well. I can smell the coffee in this beer from a few feet away. Just after looking at and smelling this beer I cannot wait to try it. This beer does not disappoint. The roastyness is, initially less intense than the aroma, this simply serves to allow the malt, silky oats, and bitter chocolatey goodness to show themselves. There is a slight acrid character to this from the roasted malts (usually not something I welcome in beers but) it pairs incredibly well with the other flavors here. The roasted malts come after the chocolate but are replaced by a smooth silkiness from the oats. This flavor is overtaken by the coffee which lingers long into the finish. The mouthfeel is wonderful. At first it felt a bit thin but then as I let it linger a bit on my palate I was able to appreciate its greatness. It is medium-full in body and smooth as silk. It feels almost weightless yet heavy and robust at the same time. Drinkability on this is awesome, damn near exceptional. I'm trying to make the bottle last because it has evolved so wonderfully over the course on this glass that I can't wait to see how it'll change next.

1199,11757,cooncat,3.65,"Serving from 12 oz.(?) shorty bottle into my Stone IRS tulip crystal.  The pour is pure blackness .. opaque. Compared to the on tap version, the head is much smaller, but the lacing is good.  The nose on this, the bottled version, is no where close to the on tap version. Coffee is huge, but where is that delicious chocolate? It's missing! The nose is similar to many coffee stouts ... not bad, but one dimensional.  Taste of the bottled version is as disappointing as was the nose ... all coffee and no chocolate. The tap version was a balance between the two, but this is one dimensional; coffee only. It's as if instead of using chocolate malt (or extract) they substituted black patent malt. Which brings up the astringency. None in the tap version, but very noticeable in the bottled version. Mouthfeel has lost something as well. The tap version is smooth, full and creamy, like drinking a malted milkshake. The bottled version is medium full, but not creamy. Its more astringent, with inadequate carbonation. The alcohol never makes a showing, which is a good point.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a decent Imperial stout. I guess I am disappointed that the bottled version is nowhere near what the on tap version was like. At $16 for a four pack, its definitely on the pricey side. If it had tasted like the tap version, I would've paid $20 for a 4 pack. As it is, I think it should be priced closer to $10 a 4 pack. I confess to being a bit disappointed, but I'll still enjoy the rest of my bottles over the Winter. If you've never had the tap version, you will probably find this a very good Imperial Stout. If you've had the tap version, you may find the bottled version a bit disappointing; I did.  Na Zdravje!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Appearance- Beer pours solid molasses black with a red hued ring of foam around the sides that doesn't die for over an hour and a half. Beer was poured too cold so I set it aside and waited.

Dark fruits are quick to follow but not near as strong as the first upfront coffee and Irish cream smells. Black licorice and burnt malts. This beer smells amazing. The hops aren't overly strong on the nose and that's just fine with me.  Taste- Creamy, good god this is some amazing nectar. It is no surprise that I was unable to clone it perfectly. I did come close, but not as excellent as this perfected recipe. Coffee and rich creams. Almost a Kahlua style taste but so much better. Malty sweet roasted balancing acts with toffee, caramel, espresso, the great flavor just doesn't stop coming! Again with the dark and milk chocolates. Wonderful!  Mouthfeel- Creamy, thick, full-bodied, medium-high in carbonation, even two hours later, I can find no negatives in this beer.

What's there is dark mocha in color but doesn't last long.  The aroma is so pleasant it should be illegal. Fresh ground coffee and the chocolatiest chocolates. This is the very definition of olfactory hedonism.  Let me get right to the point here: DELICIOUS. Roasted malt and lots of it. Expensive coffee and chocolate (milk and bitter). Very sweet but kept in check by pleasant bitterness. Molasses. Warming. Chewy. Smooth like velvet.  Amazingly drinkable for a beer this big.

This is like pouring motor oil. There was a slight few brown bubbles that formed on the surface but disappeared pretty much immediately.  S: Aroma is dominated by that of fresh roasted coffee, with a slight presence of chocolate. No alcohol on the nose at all.  T: Obviously dominant on the roasted coffee flavors, but as it's swirled around the mouth the dark chocolate flavors come out to play. Flavor also consists of bitter oats, vanilla and molasses. The balance between the malted barley and hops is incredible. There's a light alcoholic warmth to this, but it's ever so subtle. The ABV is completely masked in the taste. I don't even like coffee that much, but this is quite delicious. I'm impressed with how the flavors are ""layered"" in that it's not all up front, they are released over time from when you take the first sip until you swallow the last. This definitely changes as the beer warms to room temp (as suggested by Todd Alstrom on his review). Highly recommended.  M: Mouthfeel is excellent. Medium carbonation lends for a smooth drinking brew that finishes of with a mellow, creamy feel.  D: Almost completely masked ABV, great taste and easy drinking.

When poured rather aggressively a nice three finder head turned up. Cappucino/cinnamon color. Slowly will settle with a lot of clingy lacing. Body is black, the only light which shows through comes around the edge leaving nice ruby/brown tones.  Even while still on the colder side there is big aroma. The coffee jumps right out. Deep roasted malt and chocolate smells are very noticeable up front as well. The brew opens up even more as it is enjoyed.  Once again the coffee is right up front in the taste much like the nose. Dark roasted coffee flavors mesh well with the dark chocolate and slightly charred malt. Bitterness seems to come across as combination on nice hop and bitter chocolate bite. Oatmeal can be picked up providing another layer and nice texture to the brew.  Definitely a full bodied brew. Very big but incredible smooth. The ridiculously big flavors hide much of the alcohol.  This is most definitely a sipper. Great brew to start out chilled and enjoy as it warms. You wil want to enjoy this one as long as possible.  Founder's has really put me in a tough place here.

I even thought I had missed out on it again this year, but a trip to a small store in a town where the typical college student buys swill made me a very happy man. Needless to say I wish I could afford a case...alas, I purchased the 4-pack.  Removed from the fridge and poured into a snifter after 1/2 hour to warm, this beer started out with a 1-finger brown head that dissipated somewhat quickly to minimal lacing on the sides of the glass. The liquid is murky black with almost no evidence of light penetration.  A deep smell reveals primarily roasted coffee beans, semi-sweet chocolate, a touch of vanilla, and not even a hint of the 8.3% ABV.  First sip nearly overwhelms the taste buds with roasty, chocolatey goodness. No alcohol harshness makes this a dangerous sipper. Mouthfeel is slightly thin for the style, but as smooth as any stout I've ever had (likely due to the oatmeal). Highly drinkable.

1199,11757,bonbini26,4.13,On tap @ the Tap Room  Appearance- This beer pours with some viscosity. Impressive. It's as black as eternity. A nice looking creamy brown head sits on top and recedes to a good sized collar in a minute. The lacing is sparse. Smell- The nose is nice. Coffee is the biggest component. Then roasted and burnt malts. Then wood and vanilla. Mouthfeel- The carbonation is light and the beer feels somewhat creamy in the mouth. Body is medium could be a little heavier Taste- The coffee tones come through in a big way on the palate as well. There's a nice bitterness attributed to coffee and roasted malts. It lingers nicely.  The alcohol is hidden nicely behind the bold coffee tones. Pretty tasty beverage esp if you like coffee,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ClockworkOrange,4.4,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this one yet. Here goes - Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Breakfast Stout shaker glass. Appears an opaque dark brown color with about two fingers of caramel colored head that fades rather quickly. Smells of dark chocolate and roasted coffee. Mocha! Taste is of both dark and milk chocolate, dark roasted coffee and a touch of hops. There's a pleasant bitterness followed by a warming alcohol burn on the throat. Full bodied, thick, rich and chewy with medium carbonation. A really great beer, but a little too rich to have more than a few of these in a session.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,tedsox31,4.85,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The color is a dark, rich brown with a tan head. There is beautiful thick lacing along the side of the glass.  The smell is of dark roasted coffee beans, chocolate, malts, a hint of caramel. I thought that the beer smelled more like chocolate as it warmed.  Taste is strongly of fresh roasted coffee. There is also a delicious chocolate flavor mixed in. The coffee flavor lingers even after I swallow. Perhaps a hint of grain. As it warms the chocolate comes through more than the coffee.  The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and a bit of carbonation although not much. The rich taste of this beer completely hides the higher abv.  A very drinkable beer. A well-crafted stout that is well worth its $13.99 price for a 4-pack. Plus this beer makes you patient and forces you to think a bit more, as the flavor subtleties shift around as it warms. Yum!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,jcdiflorio,4.87,"Poured this one into a 20oz nonic glass,sure wish my good BA buddy Sudsdog was here to enjoy with me. Thanks to the WVbeergeek for the hookup. I'll try to save you some! Did i mention this was from my home tap system? Now on with the review.Poured with a thick dense dark tan head with mocha swirls to it.Opaque, blackness,kinda like Texas tea. The head dissapated a bit on the quick side already leaving sticky webs of lace and clinging and sticking to the glass,the rest of the way down.  Intense roasty nose,freshly ground coffee love that aroma,lots of dark bittersweet chocolate,very earthy and woody with spicyness to the wood,vanillia and oatmeal,dusty chocolate and coffee and more coffee. Now i know why it's called Breakfast.  Intensely roasty right from the start as the nose would indicate. Taste again and again, a clean break before mid taste comes through pouding the palate with strong coffee and chocolate notes with oatmeal tastes and some astrigentness throughout. A clean very sharp bitterness balances out the malty rush nicely with a lot of woodiness and touches of smoke,lingering tastes of chocolate and coffee bean leaving the juices flowing.  Suprizingly drinkable with a more amazing light mouthfeel and creamyness. Has a good chewyness towards the finish. The alcohol is well hidden. Not an all-nighter by any means several of this would be in order though. Damn this beer is good. Come get some!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Taste - Abundant dark roasted coffee and some coffee fruit. Inky and hoppy with coffee bitterness intermingling in the finish. Bold, long and complex but not extremely so. Maybe I'm looking for liquorice and tar that I enjoy in other impy stouts.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Super long finish. Mouthfeel is good while drinkability is limited by coffee acids.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,SykDoc,4.95,"Poors like a fine motor oil with a very dark, opaque appearance. A tan head that does not last particularly long. Aroma of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Very pleasant. Taste is a great balance of chocolate malt and dark roasted coffee. The oatmeal taste is subtle, much the way the hops are. The coffee is definitely first, with more subtle flavors to follow. There is a full body, but on the lighter side of this, which is probably one of the few things I thought could be better. Overall, this is a great beer. It offers a great taste and hides the alcohol content really well. I could enjoy this by the fire on a cold evening, or pretty much any day.  I did have this another time and had it to compare against many of the best stouts there are. I believe my ranking might be a little lower at round 2 but wow, it is still a great beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Buebie,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no freshness date, into a tall snifter. Color is black, no light penetration at all. Nice foamy brown head, sits there for a good while. Leaving a ring of retention. Drapy thick lace with big un-popped bubbles.  Smell is bakers chocolate, coffee, mild sweet cream aroma, smoked oak.  First sip brings in the uber big dark chocolate grain bill. Followed by wisps of smooth carbonation, thick creamy textures. Through the swallow comes a woosh of coffee flavor, followed by a dry bite....mild hops with a good bitter mocha linger. No alcahol warming at the nose or on the pallette.  I shoulda had this one for breakfast. But after a long day at work and several weeks of starring this one down in the fridge. This one was a must for me to drink now. I recommend this delicious breakfast at any time of the day.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,treyrab,4.17,"Thanks to warriorsoul for this one! Poured into my pint glass at 55F.  A: Pours a beautiful black-as-night color with a small half inch mocha brown head; The head quickly dissipates to nothing, not even a disc of foam. FBS laces pretty good as well as I drink it.  S: Smells like my normal dark roast from Starbucks in the morning - of course with alcohol added. Strong coffee scent with some caramel added also.  T: Strong coffee flavors, but not much else to it. After the coffee hits you, it kind of leaves you wanting more flavors, but they just never come. I think at 25 IBU this could have used some more hops, but the coffee bitterness is there.  Overall, a pretty good brew, and is basically KBS without the bourbon. Try it if you can.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,brantadid,4.62,"Poured black with just a few brownish highlights passing through. A huge tanish head formed. Excellent head retention that left tons of lacing behind.  Smell is off rich, heavily roasted (not burnt) coffee and bitter chocolate. Slight hoppiness.  Wow. Layers and layers of flavor in this beer. Big and malty. Tons of wonderful coffee notes. The coffee flavors aren't bitter. The bitterness is left up to the chocolate flavors that present in the mid to far palate. Bittering hops present in the far palate.  Mouthfeel is heavy, coating, full, and rich. Wow. The flavor hangs in your mouth for a very long time.  Since the bitterness does not come from the coffee, and the bitterness that exists is well balanced by the malty, sweetness, this is one extremely drinkable beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,kels,4.57,"Picked up a 4-pack at Jungle Jim's near Cincy, OH after watching my brother drink the only bottle he brought with him when visiting. I knew he was a big fan, so thought I should get some while I could.  Appearance: Dark-chocolate brown - nearly black - with a short, chocolate-milk frothy head that held just long enough to take a big whiff. Lacing hangs around very lightly, but definitely present all the way up the glass as I continue to drink.  Smell: Strong at first while the head hung around, but faded to nearly nothing once it was gone. Rich, creamy chocolate-milk smell with notes of caramelly, toasty coffee.  Taste: The bitterness of the coffee beans in this brew is the most pronounced taste of all. It's a little much for me, kind of like chewing on a coffee bean accidentally. As I continue to drink it the dark, bitter chocolate starts to show up a little bit. It's slightly sweet and dry with a little bit of smokiness to the roasted malts - not pronounced like in a smoked stout or porter - just a little hint. Very pronounced roasted flavor and some caramel. Strong alcohol aftertaste. Slows me down a bit, but that's probably a good thing.  Mouthfeel: Fairly clear mouthfeel, and slightly notable sediment throughout. Very light carbonation keeps it from tasting too flat or watery. Goes down very smoothly despite the aforementioned bitterness. It's very much what I expected for the style.  Drinkability: Whew, definitely couldn't do more than one at a time, especially at 8.3%",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ColForbinBC,4.5,"12oz bottle poured into a pint  Appears the darkest chestnut brown known to man. An aggressive pour yielded a small, less than one finger mocha brown cap. Good staying power and very, very light lacing.  Aromas of bittersweet, dark chocolate, flakey oats and fresh ground coffee. Hints of alcohol and dark fruit.  Dominant roast coffee flavors rounded out by bittersweet chocolate and just a touch of oats. A lingering warming and roast coffee flavor hangs on for quite a while. This beer isn't that broad, but damn is it deep. Full, fresh flavors that really pop on your tongue.  Full bodied. Viscous while maintaining a smooth, creamy feel.  Not overly thick and adequately carbonated allow for this guy to go down pretty easy. I am not a coffee drinker and I thoroughly enjoyed this.  I would have to say that this beer lived up to its reputation. One of the better stouts out there for sure.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,LunaChick,3.7,"I don't review based soley on my taste for something. This was a super-hyped brew for which I had high expectations. I tried it, reviewed it and then kept trying it to see if my thoughts might change. It pours a very thick near black with a full, well retained tan head that laces the entire glass. The aroma is rich coffee. A hint of chocolate but mostly freshly ground coffee beans. The flavor again is mostly coffee. Strong, slightly bitter and even smokey. Chocolate does come through near the end. The oatmeal adds a thickness and sweetens it slightly but doesn't quite balance it. Alcohol is not present even as the beer warms. Not a big deal because this is a very thick brew that is best sipped and enjoyed over time to allow flavors to develop. Some vanilla comes thru as it warms but the predominant aftertaste is a smokey, bitter turkish coffee flavor. Very smooth and thick in the mouth with low carbonation. Full bodied flavor that clings all the way down. A sipping beer not meant to be consumed quickly or in large quantitities. I understand why the Kentucky version of this is so highly sought.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Natural510,4.27,"12oz bottling, 2008 edition.  A thick, black pour resembling motor oil. No head or lacing in appearance. Very pungent coffee aroma, along with that of sweet, dark roasted malts and a hop note. Strong roasted coffee flavor backed with bitter cocoa. Roasted malts come through along with a noticable piney hop flavor. Despite lack of carbonation, it leaves quite a notable mouthfeel with the distinct hop kick (not something I expected in a stout of this magnitude) and a reverbaration from the alcohol content. Overall a quite drinkable heavy stout; alcohol is masked quite well and the malt & hop characters meld niceley together. A bit heavy on the coffee, but I think that is what they are going for here.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,koopa,4.35,Appearance: quite opaque in color with a thin caramel head that quickly dissipates. Some lacing and an overall look of quality that entices.  Smell: Can you say coffee?  Taste: Notes of chocolate are overpowered by a dominant coffee character found in this fresh sample. A good amount of acrid/bitterness as well. Very nice taste and that is saying a lot considering I am not a coffee drinker! No alcohol presence.  Mouthfeel: I was very surprised by how thin the 2008 batch is. I really was expecting this brew to be a bit more hearty. Then again that only adds to the drinkability!  Drinkability: Much easier to drink than other full bodied viscous stout examples. The alcohol has no presence.  Overall this is a great American Stout and will be one of my go to stouts.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Neilio,4.23,"This is a great brew for the fall/winter. Very dark with a little brown head. Smells like over cooked coffee. Tastes very coffee with subtle chocolate undertones.

1199,11757,Nutleybeer,4.5,"Insanely good. Heavy and so rich, like a meal in a bottle.  Poured nicely. It literally resembled motor oil, pitch black in color. That doesn't sound enticing, but in this context it is. A mild charcoaly head remains after the pour.  A roasted scent hits your nose, leaves you knowing what is coming. A deep, rich flavor. Cooked cocoa/chocolate/coffee essence. Incredibly creamy, smooth and satisfying. The roasted taste just lingers on your tongue long after you swallow your sip. Almost like the best cup of iced coffee you ever had.  This is a serious beer. Not sure what I would serve with it. Would probably go well with desert (chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream).",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,BirdFlu,4.38,"Founders' breakfast stout really lives up to what one would expect from reading reviews on it, let alone the description from founders. It pours a dark black with a brown, cappucino-colored head. Smells of coffee. Not even just coffee, but moreso espresso. The flavor too, its much moreso a dark espresso flavor than just coffee. With the noticeable chocolate in it, as well, it is very, very reminiscent of chocolate-covered espresso beans. Thats basically exactly what this is.. a beer that is like drinking chocolate-covered espresso beans. Mouthfeel is fairly typical for a stout, though a little on the lighter side, definitely not as heavy as many stouts, which is a plus to me. Drinkability is, I feel, as good as a stout can be. That is, it's something to enjoy at home. Def. not for having while out at a bar or party (to me, at least).",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The smell is of chocolate and coffee - great selections of each - with some mollasses. There's an underlying earthiness and vague fruitiness.  The taste is of rich, roasted coffee, rich chocolate - bittersweet. Light roast and bitterness balance sweetness. A touch of milk seems to come through as it progresses. Rich and complex with a slight acidic touch.  It has a rich, creamy full-body that is silky smooth.  Rich and complex, yet so drinkable - dangerously so - esp. for abv.

1199,11757,dancinwillie,4.22,"A: Pours black, with a chocolate mousse-like dense, creamy head. I poured a little too aggressively into my goblet, and it almost got away from me. The head was actually hanging over the rim, but it receded and I didn't lose a drop thankfully. The whipped desert looking head has receded somewhat, leaving some lovely lacing.  S: Aroma is full of dark chocolate and good bitter coffee in almost equal portions. It smells very warm and inviting. Something in there reminds me of a cream/milk/sweet stout. Can you smell lactose? I don't know. But that's what it seems like.  T: Bitter chocolate, strong coffee, creamy goodness. Decent hop bitterness, although I'm not able to even get close to identifying the strain. Just enough to somewhat balance this malty brute. Alcohol is a little hot, but not too bad. A bit of cellaring might do wonders here.  M: I would drape myself in velvet, were it socially acceptable. Being that it's not, I will take my velvet in Breakfast Stout form. And that's the mouthfeel, liquid velvet.  D: Drinkability seems high, but I wonder if my palate would get fatigued a little. A lot going on here, and definitely a sipping beer. I could drink a few of these, but I would probably be ready to embrace sweet slumber at that point. Not to mention that it's a seasonal release, so ultimately I would have to say medium to high drinkability I suppose. Cheers.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,oneredarm,4.78,"Appearance - Poured a Dark Brown almost Black. Short head dissipated quickly leaving no head at all.  Smell - I get a big nose full of roasted coffee and chocolate, but also some hints of Vanilla. When I swirl it and smell it right after, I pick up on more hops.  Taste - The coffee is not overpowering like some other breakfast stouts. It makes is real smooth and light. An alcohol flavor makes a brief appearance but leaves quickly with a warm feeling in the mouth. The aftertaste of roasted coffee lingers in a good way.  Mouthfeel - This beer is solid, not too thick; just the right fullness for a stout.  Drinkability - I could down about two or three of these with no problem. Would be a great complement to a Saturday tailgate before a college football game.  I am blessed to live in Grand Rapids near this fine brewery. It is the halfway point on my commute home. I was pleasantly surprised to see the new batch of Breakfast Stout in the cooler and had to grab a 4 pack to go. I am reviewing the first one so I can relax and enjoy the rest.

1199,11757,Foxman,4.53,"It pours a black-hole, Stygian onyx, as featureless as a ""2001"" monolith. A finger of khaki tan head, fluffy and mousse-ish, sinks to fuzzy surface froth. Berms of lacing curb the inside of the glass.  In order to incorporate all that's there, this aroma demands a laundry list: charred malt, burnt sugar, black coffee, baker's chocolate, soy, crisp esters, dried sloe, black molasses, and alcohol, all in various and varying degrees.  Upon sipping, (and with great anticipation, I might add) roasted malt is dark with heated sugar, singed grain, and dark molasses, all granting an ensuing bitter bite. Rich espresso, sharp and of the earth from whence sprung the beans, melds with unsweetened chocolate. Dark dried fruit, soy, cocoa, and an understated spiciness move into an airy, warm wash of alcohol. Dusky grain is very slightly residually sweet, but esters are quite crisp and join the dark roast character to dry it promptly. The finish is bitter, crisp, dry, and exceptionally clean, which is quite an undertaking considering the flavor's density. It's rich, well-blended, and wonderfully complex, but not inextricably so.  Full bodied, it's thick, full-weight, oozing presence, with a sharp dry glow in the end that leaves the tongue wagging like a happy dog's tail.  The only thing that stops me from actually enjoying this for breakfast is the fact that I'm always in a rush early in the day, and not taking the time to reverentially savor this richly complex and artfully pieced-together brew would be a zymurgical sin. And the ABV be damned, an AM buss just makes this all the more worth experiencing. I'd only had a sample at a fest some months ago, so I had an idea what I was missing.

1199,11757,TheodorHerzl,4.64,"Breakfast stout pours a very dark black with slight brown highlights at the edges with a thin mocha colored head on it. The nose on this beer is an assult of rich and complex bitter coffee, bitter chocolate, roasted grain, oats, and wood. This is truly one of the best noses you will find on a stout. The flavor profile is a perfect match for the nose with a rich wave of bitter coffee at first quickly followed by a rush of bitter chocolate. The roasted grain also makes an appearance as does cherry and vanilla, but those flavors are lingering in the background when compared to the coffee and bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel isn't as thick as one would probably expect, but it is medium to full bodied and velvety smooth. I don't get a great deal of alcohol on the mouth, but I do feel the warming alcohol in my stomach.

The beer hits the palate with a surprising crisp and slams the taste buds with bitter french roast coffee, baker's chocolate, molasses, heavy roasted malt, and a piney hop finish that leaves the mouth very dry.

Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.  Appears a very dark and opague black with a half inch dark tan head that sinks down to a thin coating. It can easily be revived with a little swirl though. Leaves some spotty lacing on the side of the glass.  Aroma is wonderful. Loads of deep roasted coffee, dark chocolate, charred wood, and the lightest touch of caramel. A bit of alcohol is noticeable in the background.  Taste is even better than the aroma. At first there is a big burst of coffee. Then the chocolate flavors come out. They are strangely delicious, bitter and sweet at the same time. On the finish the coffee comes back to leave a lingering aftertaste. If there's any hop bitterness in here, the roasty flavors cover it up.  Mouthfeel is medium, but very smooth. I was expecting it to be a bit thicker. Really the only downside to this beer.  I was not let down by this one. If the mouthfeel was a bit thicker this would be even better.

The body is an inky, seal brown hue and capped by a creamy brown head. The foam shows no hints of receding, but slowly does minutes later, etching remnants of its bubbly goodness to the insides of the glass. The aroma of FBS is heavenly, with sweet espresso roast blended with dark chocolate smoke, and fresh hops. However, it came off as bit muted when compared to the best of the best american double stouts.  I expected a phenomenal taste to this beer and was far from disappointed; Breakfast Stout is delicious. Rich, bitter chunks of baker's chocolate give way to milky espresso, caramel, roasted grain husk, and hops galore. I was surprised by the level of hoppiness in this one--enough to bitter up the palate but not overpowering the more delicate chocolate malt complexities. I'd give the mouthfeel a ""6.0"" if possible, with its slick, creamy body and perfect carbonation level that wakes up the tongue and finishes strong. Overall, I can't say enough about this Founder's brew except ""Welcome to NC!!!"" Keep the good beer pouring, gents.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,abankovich,4.57,"Pours an intense dark black with faint hints of brown at the edges. A great tan head compliments the blackness perfectly. Tightly laced bubbles cling to the sides of the glass.  The aroma is the richest, bitter coffee smell I've ever experienced with a rich chocolate aroma following right behind.  The bitter chocolates and coffees are amazingly prominent with a mild alcohol burn throughout. The oatmeal keeps the smoothness intact the whole way through. There is also a great hop presence that works well. It's not dominant by any means, but it is there.  My only wish is that the mouthfeel was a little more full. It is definitely medium to full bodied, but I could stand it a little thicker. That said, this is a delicious beer that I would sip on all night and finding any fault in it at all is very hard to do.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,atsprings,4.45,"Judging by the number of reviews on-tap I am very lucky to get to try this one on-tap, thanks are due both to Flying Saucer and Tryon Distribution for blessing us with this at Founders NC launch! Served a dark opaque black with a nice tan head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves great lacing. Aroma is a wonderful blend of fresh ground espresso and bitter chocolate. The taste is also a great blend of espresso and chocoalte, with hints of burnt caramel and dried fruits in the back. The beer is fairly heavy, but a very endurable sipper. Having had Kentucky Breakfast and abosolutely loving it, I have to say this one certainly stands up on it's own merits. Welcome to NC Founders, keep the great times pouring!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,association330,4.57,"A - Pours a rich, opaque black with a thick, fluffy, mocha head. This is how a proper stout should look, to be sure.  S - Incredible waves of bitter chocolate, toffee, burnt sugar, oatmeal, coffee, and a slight alcoholic twang. This is truly one of the best beers I've ever laid my nose to, but the taste?  T - Equally impressive, though it starts and finishes very sweet, with rich flavors of cherry, chocolate, coffee, oatmeal and molasses. Alcoholic presence and overall flavor increase as the beer warms, so enjoy this one slowly for sure. The taste of bitter, roasted coffee grounds lingers.  M - Thick, oily, viscous and wonderful.  D - Half a point for alcohol content and half a point for sweetness. This is a fabulous brew, but it's best when consumed in heavy moderation.  To be honest, this is a dessert beer for me due to its very sweet and chocolatey profile, but it's certainly a new favorite of mine. Highly recommended, if you can locate it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,objectivemonkey,4.88,"""Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout""... I approve.  Into an imperial pint, pours jet black with no hints or hues, a lovely, fluffy tan head and lacing sticks in arches and blots. The head sticks around till the very end, and the lacing is left on the glass in varying intervals.  The aroma is heavenly, and every bit its billing. Lots of coffee espresso, chocolates are lovely, oatmeal, all playing together like good kids.  The taste, even better, brilliant really. Comes in smooth with light coffee notes and sweeter malt, chocolate, then the bitterness hits just like with coffee, only roasted malts joined hand and hand, sits there and tingles for a bit, then smooths out for a long, drawn out finish thats chocolate, coffee, oatmeal, stout. Imagine that. Smooth, full, velvety, creamy, a dreamy mouth, with hardly a hint of the ABV.  Perhaps even more remarkable, its so easy to drink, I could perfectly see sitting down to this beer for breakfast, joined by some eggs and bacon, some hash, some oatmeal, some fruits. My breakfasts will seem incomplete with out this beauty. Absolutely marvelous. I loves me my big full stouts, and this one is the class of a select few.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,JasonA,4.26,"Note, Ive had this sitting quite a while.  Not ready to rate the pour. I think ""lots of head"" is an over statement. Give me a minute for this to calm down so I can pour the rest of it. . . 5 minutes later ... . . Gosh, this head is dark and thick . . 10 minutes later. Whole bottle is poured, but I have a solid 4 fingers of foam. Not head, foam. Boy is this beer dark. Not sure ive seen a liquid darker than this.  Roasted coffee. I dont smell any hops, not really any malt.  Like a nice roasted coffee bean flavor. Almost like a cold, alcoholic coffee. Very rich, feels heavy and syrupy at the end. In a good way though. ABV is hidden VERY well. I cant tell there is alcohol, though its yummy. The 8.3 is not noticed one bit.  Awesome. Sits almost syrupy. Yummy, not full on sweet. Long lasting flavor. Reminds me of Saturday morning coffee at breakfest.  I definately want more of this. I could drink maybe 4 of these, any more my face would probably fall off, though in a good way.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,JoeMayo,4.77,"A- Pours very thick with a small cap of head  S- Slight smell of alcohol and a very pungent coffee aroma  T- The coffee is very much in the foreground. The two blends can be distinctly tasted and are well-balanced. The Kona coffee imparts its distinct flavor and a certain brightness, while the Sumatra coffee imparts a slight bitterness and certainly a roasted flavor. The chocolate comes through in the aftertaste.  M- Thick and smoothed-out by the oats  D- In spite of its thickness, it is very pleasant and goes down easy",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,beachbum1975,4.68,"Thanks to newtony for the opportunity to try this beer. 12 oz bottle with no freshness date. Per the trader, this is an 08 vintage.  Pours a highly viscous drak brown/black with a small dark tan head that doesn't stick around long. A small ring of foam remains around the edges.  Smells of rich chocolate, alcohol and heavily toasted grains including barley.  The taste is wonderfully rich and moderately complex. Mixes of heavily toasted malts, grains, and chocolate on the front. Cherry mixed with chocolate and rich coffee on the finish. Light to medium bodied and masterfully crafted.  There's no wonder this is a highly rated stout. This is a rich and flavorful brew that's highly drinkable. Outstanding for its' style. Highly recommended - I really enjoyed this one.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,thickerfreakness,4.14,"Many thanks to guezelover for this one. I think its a 2006 bottle.  Now I don't think I have given many 5's for appearance but man this one was awesome. Just an absolutely pitch black beer that poured like motor oil and had one of the darkest, longest lasting heads I have seen on an Imperial Stout. Great to look at.  Smells of light chocolate, coffee, vanilla, roasted malts, oatmeal, and a slightly odd spiced alcohol smell that rubbed me the wrong way. I think the smell might come from stale coffee.  The weird smell doesn't transfer to the taste. Its a nice chocolate and coffee dominate with a really pleasant lingering bitterness and other subtle flavors that translate form the smell.  A nice thick beer from the oats. It definitely coats the mouth and its very big bodied and still pleasantly carbonated.  That one smell was sort of off putting but otherwise this was a really great breakfast stout. I think I would like to try it again fresh. The ABV sort of hits hard after a while too.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Hops are present, but take a backseat....Nicely done!  M - Thick with a good carbonation.  D - Great Brew.

1199,11757,israel,5,"2006 vintage compliments of Jw347(thanks for opportunity to review this beer)  poured into an ommegeng tulip glass...  A - initial pour reveals a veryd ark beer with a thick coffee colored head that quickly disipates leaving just a thin head that mostly clings to the sides of the glass. Upon further inspection this beer is pitch black, so black that zero light passes through it even when held up to a light, wow.  S - the smell presents mild coffee flavors with a strong backing of chocolate, but very well balanced even in the nose. very nice, and very inviting.  T - I anxiously dive into this beer and I'm blown away by how amazingly balanced this beer is. This beer is so well balance it almost seems impossible to pick out individual flavors, but I'll try. The coffee flavors are there but definitely not in the foreground all the while a slight sweetness from the chocolate mingles with the coffee and just blows me away. On top of this the flaked oats add a smoothness that adds so much depth to this beer that I can't put it down long enough to get all my thoughts out.UNREAL  M - creamy, creamy, and creamier oh yeah and velvety. the body is medium with just enough carbonation to open the taste buds up...wow again  D - I can't say enough about this beer; it's amazing.

1199,11757,maximum12,4.18,"Gusher!  But before we get into that, big thanks to genog & WeisGuy who sent me bottles within days of one another, one an extra, the other part of the trade.  Popped the top & turned around to find invaluable beer foam puddling down the sides of the bottle. Quick pour produced a towering head that necessitated patience. Head is tan, beer is thundercloud-black. Head slowly collapses, but maintains a good bit of glop on top of the brew. Nose on it is surprisingly subdued; after the firecracker that is KBS I expected to be nasally assaulted. No dice.  Taste is very good. Plenty of coffee in the background of toasted chocolate on the tongue & a nice, creamy finish. Very nice! Very drinkable for a big stout, I'm having trouble typing as I have to keep sipping. As noted, creamy & silky & smooth going down.  Very, very good beer. While I love big beer, I believe this is better than KBS, which was spoiled a bit for me by the overwhelming coffee drowning out most of the other elements. This is better, more subtle, allowing the other ingredients to dazzle the palate.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Finished dry with baker's chocolate, iron & Folgers, damn near pulled a 5.0  MF: Oily, rich with moderate carbonation, just got chewier as time went by  Drinks pretty easy, the ABV is very masked, the coffee taste would get to me after a few or just completely win me over, not sure.

S: Dominate aromas of roasted coffee beans and espresso, with some vanilla and nutty undertones.  T: Starts off sweet and chocolately, then somewhat of an earthy and oat-like flavor presents itself before fading into a dry, bitter roasted coffee finish.  M: Semi-thick and velvety; enough carbonation that you can feel it tingle on the tongue after each sip. Very dry finish. A little lighter body than I was expecting, but it works.

1199,11757,bkilpatr,4.7,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. 05/10/08.  Pours a very pitch black, looks very thick going into the glass. A modest pour produces a giant 4+ finger puffy tan head. The head slowly fades back down leaving beautiful lacing around the glass. Heavy aromas of roasted coffee/espresso and dark chocolate.  Oh wow the taste is amazing. It starts with swirls of sweet milk and bitter dark chocolate. Then it continues with more roasty malt goodness. I finishes with a very nice bitter coffee flavor. All of the flavors are balanced well, none dominate the palate.  This beer is so smooth. About medium carbonation, just enough to keep it from feeling flat. Doesn't leave my mouth all sticky either. And did I mention it's so smooth? Drinkability is also great. The bitterness lays low throughout, and all the flavors are awesome. If the alcohol content were a tad lower, the drinkability would be perfect.  Overall, an excellent beer. I wish it were available in my area.

Lastly, lets note the mouthfell: its smooth for its coffee taste and holds on the tongue for a good while. Overall, this is a fantastic stout and if you have the means, grab more than one! :)  This is a review of this beer after almost 9 months.  The appearance is beautiful the head is very very dark. The smell is beautiful as well. It smells of coffee and chocolate. As for the taste coffee dominates this wonderful brew! It's so very tasty!! My god!! I love this beer so much. When I purchased the case I consumed a 4 pack that day! I really love this stout. It's simply amazing!!  Overall, this beer is still wonderful! I really am in love with this product! It makes me very happy!!! :-)  Newest offering!  Pours the same black brew but lacks the taste and smell of the previous year! Its not the same brew IMHO.

1199,11757,grandq,4.27,"Pours dark, opaque brown just short of black with a somewhat slight tan head. Smells of maple, honey, molasses, pear and coffee grounds. The taste is very coffee forward, like the bottom of a used coffee filter. That sounds like a knock, but I like it, not off putting or acrid, just bitter and heavily roasted. That note remains prominent throughout. A touch of prune pops up, along with a decent dose of semisweet chocolate. A drop of honey crops up toward the back. Hops seem nonexistent and the alcohol's pretty under the radar - really smooth. Coffee's where all the bitterness is coming from. The relatively thin (for the style) mouthfeel works here given the surprisingly mellow profile. Reminds me a ton of Mikkeller's Black Hole, but without the burn. Lacks a certain something, perhaps the abv kick the KBS gives, along with something to balance out the slightly too dominant coffee. I prefer the KBS myself, but my significant other with whom this was shared prefers the FBS.

The smell is bursting forth with coffee, really dominating the flavor, but there is certainly a lingering presence of sweet roasted and chocolaty maltiness. As the beer rolls over the tongue, the coffee again comes bursting to the forefront along with that malt characteristic that you would expect. This is very sweet and tasty. The mouthfeel is honestly a bit thin and very carbonated. I have seen a couple coffee imperial stouts come out quite carbonated (homebrew, and Terrapin's Wake-n-Bake) and wonder if this is a direct effect of the coffee.

Not even a glimmer of the shit will make its way through this glass of beer. Small head but the deep red-brown color is sick and the lacing is what I would expect of sausage gravy.  Coffee, coffee, prunes, fudge, coffee. Not overly complex but well defined and the prominent aromas take the word prominent to a whole new level. Meticulously balanced malts with a perfect amount of some citric hop character.  Coffee all the way through tis stuff. Sweet, dark fruits in the finish. Well hopped throughout. Very mellow when balanced with the malt. The oats are subtle in taste but very much evident in feel.  Oats. Yum. Like I said; not in the taste but in the feel. Very silky. Low carbanation.

1199,11757,SPLITGRIN,4.69,"I have had this beer a couple of other times but this will be the first time I have done a review.  I am doing a skip year vertical with the '05 and the '07. Although I will post notes for both, I will only point score the '07.  A strong pour of both and I only get a half inch of head on the 05 but nothing but a few bubbles on the 07. Head is chocolate brown in color. Body on both is pitch thick oily black. The nose on each beer is a very different beast with the 07 you get full up front roasty coffee freshness like a fresh opened can of Folgers. On the 05 it is much more dark fruit, very over ripe and almost port like. The coffee is still there but plays a much more backround role. On first sip you get a very well balanced stout with roasty coffee intertwined nicely. Sweetness is long and topped off at the end with an even mineral based bitter. Now with the 05 once again the coffee feel is much subdued. The entire flavor profile is very mellowed out with a cleaner smooth mouthfeel. The dark fruit feel and soft sweetness are very even. Mouthfeel is textured and doughy but nice. While the mouthfeel for the 07 is a little more coffee bitter and more desireable. Overall these beers are both super drinkable. I must say I do like what this beer is fresh better though. I will make my ratings based on the fresh version.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Intense coffee aroma - it was bursting with fresh roasted coffee, roasted malts, caramel, and some faint vanilla were also there.  The flavor of the beer had a rich and creamy coffee flavor. This beer had notes of chocolate, deep roast, vanilla, and sweet caramel malt. The hops provided a sturdy bitterness that complimented the chocolate.  In the finish there was a faint touch of that boiled coffee staleness that I've found in other coffee beers. This took a little away from the beer's overall flavor.  The mouthfeel was thick, but not too heavy. The beer finished reasonably dry, which aided its drinkability.

1199,11757,beavers,4.87,"I've been holding onto this one for a few months and its now time to crack this one open. I've had this one from my first trade. Big ups to pimpp for the chance to try this brew.  Pours a thick, viscous, sticky black liquid into a Duvel tulip, forming a good finger of khaki colored head and descending into a thin layer on top. Spotty lacing is left behind. Smells of rich roasted coffee, vanilla beans, dry oatmeal flakes, fresh cocoa beans. I get this in a lot of coffee stouts, but again I get notes similar to soy sauce. This is not a turn off in any way, just eludes to the potency of the malt character (4.5, smell). Taste is quite amazing, with the coffee character initially dominating but then falling back and letting the sweetness of the chocolate and vanilla flavors come forward. There is a nice bitterness in the finish that is reminiscent of the bitterness you would expect from a rich dark chocolate. Coffee character stays in the nose after a good mouth-full. The alcohol is completely masked in taste. I can only recognize the alcohol in a little heat that I get in my cheeks in the mouthfeel. The flavors really come together to give a strong contrasting, yet beautifully balanced profile.

1199,11757,yourefragile,4.8,"12 oz 2007 bottle poured into a snifter. Just reviewed a KBS last night so figured I should break out one of this for a comparison.  A: Pours a syrupy very dark chocolate brown color and settles into the glass a still near pitch black liquid. Hard pour leaves a bubbly two finger thick head, dark tan, mochaish. Not quite as retentive as KBS, dissipates to a very thin head with a large clump of medium sized bubbles. Nice, thick web like lacing. S: Not quite as overpowering or rich as KBS but pretty amazing regardless. My first thought is baskin robbins jamoca almond fudge ice cream and this definitely has a much stronger chocolate presence along with the coffee ground aromas. There is also a slightly stronger bitterness to this than the KBS and mild dark fruit smell. Not much of an alcohol presence anywhere. T: It's very obvious drinking these two side by side that the KBS isn't just a barrel aged version of this beer. There is a very strong, slightly bitter black coffee/ground taste that persists throughout this beer. However that is balanced with a strong sweet, milk chocolate like presence in the beginning. Near the finish is an oatmeal stout taste that balances the coffee grounds. The taste of this beer is incredibly persistent, just like KBS, that is very pleasant and leaves you wanting more of this. M: Thicker side of medium bodied, but not quite as thick as KBS. Still, very creamy, smooth. slight bitterness from the coffee and finish is like drinking a cup of coffee. Finish is not as clean or crisp as KBS, but still very pleasant. I always enjoy drinking this beer slightly cooler than room temperature and letting it warm up as the coffee and chocolate flavors will alternate dominating the taste. D: Only place that I rate this above KBS, as much as I enjoy the bourbon/oak flavors in the KBS that makes it more a special occasion beer and for me there's really nothing here holding me back from wanting more of this all the time. Great to sip on and I'm always left wanting more.

Initial mouthfeel is lighter than expected from nose and alcohol level. Big espresso blast - some hop flavors, a hint of dark chocolate. Mouthfeel builds nicely.  Nice balance of sweetness and hop bittering. A complex beer.  Tough to rate - if I compare to an Imperial Stout - this is below many - particularly Founders. I guess I like my IS without the shot of espresso! If compared to Coffee beers - at the top of what I have had.  This is one strong coffee beer, a double espresso with hop resins squeezed in.

Warm and dark all over, with light smoke, burnt wood, and earthy roots.  Taste is loaded with malt, blackened bread, bitter chocolate and of course, coffee. Hardly sweet at all, with traces soft vanilla and tobacco wrapping the strong dark roasted flavors. Finishes with a light bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium-full, nice for the style. Not at all syrupy, rather smooth and a tad chewy. Good moderate carbonation isn't overdone.  A very drinkable beer if you like coffee stouts. Very nicely balanced and bodied for the style. Strong without being intimidating. Flavors aren't overdone, resulting in a very nice double stout.

1199,11757,demcorhip,4.38,"Much thanks to CBA for this tasty brew.  The 12oz bottle opened with an incredibly loud bang. A very slow pour still produced a five finger whipped tan head overtop of a deep, opaque black body, that surprisingly allowed some light through the edges of the glass. Finely and mildly carbonated, after the initial burst had a chance to subside. Big and sticky clumps of lace formed fluffy little clouds that graced the inside of my beer glass.  Creamy oatmeal, treacle, black coffee, a slight metallic twang, hints of char, smoke, and milk chocolate greeted my nose.  Good stuff! Oatmeal creaminess is almost lost in the profound depths of roasted and charred flavours of coffee, anise, and flavours of milk chocolate. A touch of amaretto also managed to escape from the pronounced roastiness of this brew. A mild and earthy bitterness of decaying leaf gave way to a slight puff of smoke at the finish.  Full bodied, and a touch overcarbonated, especially initially. Smooth and almost velvety, although this effect was muted due to the active carbonation. Nice balance between creamy and charred grains. Coffee takes a backseat to the other flavours, but certainly lets its presence be known, much like the hops.  A big, tasty, and deeply flavourful brew. Some alcohol heat makes the 8.3abv apparent, but this is pretty damn drinkable for what it is. Highly recommended to fans of the style, may be too much for a newbie. Really has me looking forward to my bottle of KBS!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,macster,4.25,"Bottle sampled in a snifter at 55*F.  Pours a viscous inky jet black with virtually no head to speak of.  Exquisite, up front aromas of freshy ground dark roasted coffee beans and semi-sweet baker's chocolate with some licorice and molasses lingering in the background.  Mouthfeel is almost perfect for this style; round, slick, smooth and slightly oily.  Intense, rich flavors of espresso coffee, dark chocolate and black malt come agressively to the forefront, supported nicely with hints of vanilla, caramel, molasses and charcoal. Very well balanced overall, starting out slightly sweet but quickly finishing with a moderate, but long charred oak, hoppy bitterness with the alcohol warming the finish up admirably.

1199,11757,HopHead84,4.27,Acquired in a trade with Jw347.  Dark black with a 1 finger brown head that lingers for a short time. The smell is off the charts. Tons of coffee chocolate and oatmeal in the nose (big surprise). If I couldn't smell the alcohol and oatmeal I might mistake this for cappuccino. The initial taste is of freshly brewed coffee with some bittersweet chocolate. The alcohol is very noticeable. The taste of oatmeal is subtle but is a welcomed guest. The finish is mostly alcohol at the back of the tongue and lingers for a bit. Nice mouthfeel with good carbonation. It's drinkability is attenuated by it's noticeable alcohol presence.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,jeonseh,4.28,"Got this from a trade with Alexgash so a big thanks to him and I poured it into my crystal snifter.  A - wow now this is what a stout should really look like. The body is a clear, non hazy deep, chocolate brown/black. Does indeed remind you of that cup of black coffee coming out of the pot. The head is very thick and dense as one can see layers upon layers of carbonation lying on top of each other which makes this one sturdy head that refuses to go away. The color is a chocolate creme and it is big, puffy and leaves tons of lacing down the sides of the glass. Love it  S - first hit I get mostly a roasted coffee flavor attacking the nostril; however this is not a bitter coffee but rather it is sweet because there are also notes of chocolate and caramel coming up along with the coffee. There is also a slight hint of vanilla in there as long with some hints of the oats lingering around as if someone poured a ton of caramel and coffee over a packet of oatmeal before putting it in the microwave.  T - First impression is that the taste is rather sweet as I was immediately hit with vanilla and caramel flavors. After these faded away, the taste went more toward the roasted coffee and chocolate flavors as the aftertaste reminded me of chewing a piece of dark chocolate with a high cocoa percentage. There is a dark roastiness as well left in the mouth that goes along with the reminder of the dark chocolate flavors. Overall, have to say that the taste profile is along the lines of a bitter chocolate mostly with a bit of the coffee roastiness mixed in. Not to say that this beer is bitter as it is not by any stretch of the imagination but rather to say that you have to like that aspect of dark chocolate to appreciate and fully enjoy this one.  MF- has a decent body that seems to go along with the rest of the beer and kinda reminds you of the body of a coffee drink; there is only a light carbonation as one would expect and hope for in a nice stout and the mellow mouthfeel goes well with the more mellow flavors that lie within the brew.  D - overall a good stout that everyone should try. I think it does a job good at being nice and mellow and sneaking up on you out of nowhere. This is a beer that you could definitely have with breakfast and also as a dessert. Don't even taste or notice the high ABV as they do a good job at hiding it and the body does not make it a stout that is so thick that you can only have one. Defintiely worth picking some up if you have the chance.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Burnt woody, acidic smell. Extra bold coffee, with black licorice, and bittersweet chocolate. Very complex!  Taste starts off similar to eating a straight coffee bean - bitter - but fortunately this beer is very well balanced with a sweet, malty richness in the finish. Chocolate sweetness particularly comes thru as it warms.  Sharp, slightly bitter bite on the front and sides of the tongue, with a rich coating overall.

T- There is an out of control coffee and burnt malt taste going on here.

1199,11757,udubdawg,4.45,"12 oz bottle. judging by the notch location, this was bottled sometime in the last third to quarter of the year.  Great pour. Black in color, very little light evident at the edges, and a great slow-forming and equally slowly-receding dark brown head. The near absence of lace is the only minor negative, and I'm really stretching to ding it for that.  I like to think I have a pretty good nose, and that my palate can discern a lot of different flavors, but this beer defies my ability to do either. It smells like coffee - rich, fresh, with a little chocolate behind. Likewise the flavor is java-heavy, with chocolate again noticeable but less than the aroma. Delicious, and I'm not even a coffee drinker. I like it, I like it a lot. Near absence of any harsh acidity, and very smooth across the palate - I'm going to give the oats some credit here. I've had a few other coffee-stouts lately and I think this is my favorite mouthfeel.  This is one of those beers that won't get a very high score from me if I'm not in a certain mood for it, but knowing what to expect they are a welcome occasional treat. I find myself unable to help comparing to some other coffee-infused stouts. The alcohol is hidden as well as Bell's Java if not better, and both have a great intense coffee-ness with the Founders being even stronger. Body isn't as big as some but I think I actually prefer the incredible smoothness of this beer to Speedway. Speaking of which, I still prefer Speedway as it is wonderfully drinkable for the strength and has a more complex, interesting flavor and aroma. Not by a lot though, and if both were available I'd buy the cheaper Founders beer a lot more often. Drinkability is as high as Bell's and Speedway and just short of the tasty but thin Schlafly coffee stout. One of these is really, really drinkable. But after two I've had my coffee fix for the week.

On tap at Map Room, pours completely black with a thin but respectable tan head.  The aroma is coffeeish, and no, I don't mean that the way I do when I write it for every other stout-- this is seriously coffeeish, the smell of roasted coffee beans stands out strongly from the background of more typical dark malt character. Very little sweetness in the aroma; a hint of hops is detectable.  Tastes like it smells, like thick, carbonated coffee-- in a good way. Some sweetness is present early and mid-palate, but it reminded me of a bar of 93% cocoa dark chocolate I had once-- the sweetness was just enough to remind me that I was eating chocolate. Hops come in on th finish, which is bitter without being chalky. I was expecting a much sweeter beer, but for what it is, this is pretty good.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly light, but I guess it's ""only"" 8.3%ABV. I'd have preferred this to be a little thicker.  Drinkability is extremely good, owing to all the things that make it a really lousy style example-- light mouthfeel and dry flavor.

Smell - A huge coffee aroma is immediately noticeable upon opening the bottle - and that's about all I got from it. My initial thought was that it was too one-dimensional, but it actually works just fine. I love the smell of coffee, and this beer captures that aroma better than any other I've tried. As it warms, rich dark chocolate begins to appear.  Taste - Extremely dry. I was expecting a sweeter stout, but once I got used to the dryness it really grew on me. Flavors of espresso, burnt toast and unsweetened chocolate are most prevalent, with a subtle smokiness in the finish. An aptly named beer - I could see this pairing beautifully with bacon, eggs and potatoes.

D-This is a good strong stout. I have wanted to try this for a while. I think I prefer a slighty sweeter stout like Brooklyn's this one is a bit too bitter and possibly unbalanced.. Still I am happy to have had it and this would be in the rotation if it were local. Cheers to Unclejedi for the sample.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

After the first sip, all i can say is ""wow."" So smooth, so roasty. It's a little bitter but finishes very dry. The mouthfeel is sublime. Despite being very rich I would love to drink this all of the time! I can only imagine what a great breakfast this would make.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,crwills,3.81,"So I'm actually sitting here drinking this right now, while I catch up on my other reviews. I popped it open cause, well, it's my birthday so I figured I'd kick things off with a Top 100 brew. I got a couple bottles of this from Skinnyelvis in the Secret Santa 2007 and have been waiting for an excuse to crack this one open.  Things started off well - this beer looks fantastic. Dark, dark, dark, but that really nice looking obsidian-dark that makes you think ""damn, this is going to be good."" Aroma - very nice as well. More restrained than I expected (was anticipating chocolate/coffee explosion) but very nice. Reminds me of ""kicked up"" hot chocolate and for some reason, something in the aroma just connotes ""thickness"" to my nose.  Stop the presses -- my first sip reveals an overly bitter, unbalanced stout with too much of the wrong kind of hops. I must say, it was quite a disappointment. I don't know if it's that I haven't had an RIS in a while, but I really had difficulty getting past the first half glass; the grapefruity hops just killed the rest of the flavour, which includes some very dark, gourmet coffee notes and hints of dry dark chocolate. I think the oatmeal in this also adds to the sourness of the beer, throwing it off more. I have to admit -- as it's warming, I'm getting more into it. But I can't say I'm enjoying it nearly as much as I expected.  Back to the good -- the mouthfeel is really nice, and the aftertaste is like that of a freshly brewed cup of pressed dark roast coffee. Excellent body, although it's got so much ""stuff"" in it that it's almost overly sticky.  Anyway... I've got one more bottle of this. I'm not sure whether to try it again in a month or two, or wait a year and see if it ages (I'm not sure if this is that type of brew). I might save it for next Christmas, or have it during the next Toronto snow storm. We'll see. Hopefully I can come back and change the ""taste"" and ""drinkability"" numbers, but for now I have to be honest and leave them the way they are.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Boppar,4.34,"12 oz into a snifter.  A: Pours extremely dark brown, with a very thin brown head. Slight lacing.  S: Right off the bat, there are aromas of coffee, burnt malt, and chocolate. Alcohol is next, warm and spicy. Raisins, tobacco, and leather are also there.  T: Tastes very much the way it smells. There is also a faint, sweet licorice taste early on, and a mid-palate ripe berry sweetness. A dry, smoky finish rounds it out rather nicely.  M: Mouthfeel is awesome! Slick, heavy and chewy. It gets fluffier and chewier as I swirl it in my mouth.  D: The smokiness gets kind of obnoxious about halfway through, and begins to hamper the drinkability. One is enough for me.

Awesome mix of chocolate, coffee..vanilla, more chocolate...roasted grains  This one tastes just like it smells. Very nice balance of flavors. It has depth. I'm loving this one.

1199,11757,jspruit,4.4,"Got this as a gift from my brother for Christmas, and shared it with a friend here in Ireland.  Poured into two different small glasses from a 12oz bottle and shared. Pours very thick like a thick dark black/brown molasses oil or something, but looks great with a 1/2 finger cream colored head that doesnt stick around too long.  First smells are of coffee and chocolate, definitely what I would have imagined from Founders out of this one.  Deep flavors of coffee and chocolate come through in the first tastes-exactly what would be expected based on the smell. Well balanced I think and not too strong, but definitely has a kick.  Tastes great as it goes down and as smooth as a beer of this style can go down really-a bit sticky here and there.  I'd like to say I could drink this all night, as I do enjoy the taste, but I do know that it does pack a pretty solid punch. I have another one of these as well and look forward to a whole one myself.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Lupe,5,"Received as part of Black Booty '08 from ahatcher78 - many thanks.  Black as night, no light at all comes through. Looks thick and viscous while being poured. Cocoa colored one-fingered head that settles to a thin cap, and leaves sporadic lacing behind.  Incredible aroma - Lots of roasty and sweet malt goodness. Dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, a touch of vanilla, and a hint of alcohol. So inviting.  Flavor is similar to aroma. Starts of with roasted bitterness - bittersweet chocolate and espresso. The beer then instantly sweetens up with milk and dark chocolate, oatmeal, and vanilla. Some herbal hops and spice as well. Notes of sherry, oak, and a light warming alcohol burn. Finish is a battle between sweet malt and dry roast. Absolutely delicious.  Rich and full-bodied, velvety smooth, viscous, thick and chewy. Incredible drinkability - but this is my only bottle!! Perfect amount of alcohol. Wonderfully balanced. Just an exceptional beer that lives up to the hype.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

S- Not too strong a nose on this. Smells of coffee and dark malts.  T- I love this beer! Tastes at first of dark malts which quickly gives way to coffee and oats. This beer sticks around in your mouth for a bit which I really like.  M- Perfect carbonation somewhat of a medium carb but cuts through the thick brew very well.  D- This beer beckons to be drank. After every sip I am wanting another. I have yet to try this with breakfast but I will one day. And it will be glorious!,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Nice lacing.  S: Coffee, chocolate, and roasted grains. This is one fantastic smelling brew. It's got me excited for the first sip!  T: Similar to the smell, but better. Dark chocolate, a huge hit of coffee, and a mild alcohol bite are all present, complimented by the roasted grains. Absolutely well-balanced and damn tasty!  M: Smooth, creamy, and delicious.  D: If they actually distributed this to MA, I would have it in my fridge all the time. Sadly, I've never seen it on out shelves.

1199,11757,ConanDan,4.33,"First bottle from two 4 packs just brought back from a family holiday trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan by trusty tasting buddy Patrick.  Poured into a 16 oz pilsner glass. Viscous and engine oil dark. One finger head, luscious tan color. Smells faintly of coffee at first, then more perceptible as it warms up. Enjoyed over 25 minutes or so.  Very noticible tastes of coffee, chocolate, not overly alcoholy. Definitely a skim of oatmealy glutens to coat the tongue. One of the least bitter stouts of the many I have sampled.  One of the most drinkable stouts I have experienced. Even my wife, who leans to pilsners and the less wild belgians, said it was something she could drink a bit of.  I'd better hide these from her.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The color was very dark brown with a mocha colored frothy head. Sticky lacings abound all over the glass.  Wonderful rich coffee and chocolate bouquet, reminded me of cappuccino.  Tasted rich and creamy, not to bitter. Tasted nuts and oats. The alcohol is well hidden. Fantastic taste, very warming and easy to drink,... I had a hard time putting my glass down, I would have this for breakfast, brunch, or anytime of day. Excellent!! :)",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Coffee, with a smokey green fruit thing, Not sure what that is but it is different.  The taste is great man do I like the coffee beer, and this one is nice. Lots of coffee, mild amount of chocolate and a bit of smokey dark toast. Really lip smacking teeth licking good.  The mouthfeel is great, in the body a bit too much carbonation at first then creamy, and a bit chalky in the finish.

I had to wait a few minutes before pouring the remaining ounces. Super frothy tan-brown head, very bubbly and delicious looking. Huge coffee aroma...couldn't really smell anything else. First sip hit me with those huge coffee notes...wow! Once she warmed a little, I got an amazing mouthfeel of chocolate milky smoothness. Very creamy, with some hop sweetness with a touch of vanilla.

1199,11757,tapman,4.37,"Pitch black opaqueness, a dark roast espresso head barely makes an appearance. Instead an espresso mist graces the surface. Lacing is adequate.  Aroma is that of fresh ground Italian roast coffee, dark baker's chocolate, alcohol, and a small degree of astringency. When it warms caramel and burnt sugar (like atop a creme brulee).  Taste is espresso coffee, dark chocolate, chocolate malts, light and dark roasted barley, a medium degree of crystal malts, and chocolate milk (some lactose?) make up the malt and adjunct flavors (if there were any adjuncts). Hops are perhaps English and American if I'm guessing correctly. Possibly related to Golding and a Cascade-English hybrid, though I'm hardly an expert, just guessing.  Mouthfeel is thick yet velvety in its dexterity. Its also just light enough to be considered creamy. The only thing I'mmissing is any kind of carbonation, seriously its kinda flat. After reading other reviews I'm suspicious if I just had a bad batch...  Not a session at all for me. My four pack lasted two months, but each one was savored and thoroughly enjoyed. Very good with vanilla ice cream. Still, pretty big for repeat drinking.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Poured into a snifter, pours a pitch black with a serious carmel colored head that stays the entire drink. Smell is very impressive, I had the glass sitting on my coffee table and I could smell the roasted aroma from about 3 feet away, roasted oats coffee and a bit of sweetness like dark chocolate smells. Taste is wonderfull with strong dark chocolate, I taste a bit of bitterness and a aftertaste of strong coffee that I have never experienced before, simply amazing beer, one of the best that I have ever tasted.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,kdoc8,4.77,"Thanks to Nat and Konrad for this delicousness. It poured out of the bottle, thick and very dark, with a thin, brown, bubbly head that lingers for quite a while. The smell is amazing and strong and roasty with hints of coffee/espresso and chocolate. Completely black in color, with no hints of red or opacity. Taste - wow. So good. Creamy and roasted oak and chocolate taste is up front; a whiff of alcohol to the taste, but it's mainly covered by the roasty flavors. Thck and delicious, though in a lingering aftertaste, there is a burnt coffee flavor on the back of the palate. But that's no reason not to keep on drinking it. And 8.3%? I couldn't smell or taste it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,SaCkErZ9,4.5,"Thanks go out to hoppymeal (I think) for this one.  Dispensed from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours pitch black and with the consistency of warm molasses or motor oil. Small, coffee-with-cream colored head that doesnt amount to much sizewise, and quickly dissipates into a ring around the edge of the glass. With some swirling and agitation, the head regains a little of its form but falls into grace once again.  Aroma is full of coffee and backed with chocoalate. Smells like breakfast to me. Some slight alcoholic esters are in there as the beer begins to warm a tad, but doesnt detract a bit from the overall experience. As far as hops; not really much.  If there were a 4.25 in the taste category, I would go with that. However, without the choice, I will lean toward the 4 mark. Great coffee flavor. Kind of sweet. Dark fruits. Chocolate, toffee, licorice.  Overall a nice beer. I dont particularly agree with the majority on this beer, but a great example of the style. Personally, I prefer Terrapin Wake N Bake to this, but that is just me. I am glad I got a chance to try this and I would certainly love to get my hands on this in a draft situation. Full bodied and sticky on the tongue. ABV becomes a little apparent toward the end of the session, but it is a welcome warming.

I actually much prefer this to the KBS, which I had on tap @ Founders, as its strength is much more manageable.  I had a goblet of this at the Map Room when it was their beer of the month and I couldn't have been more pleased. Not even the semi-high ABV takes away from its drinkability.

Poured into goblet and was pitch black and went with chocolate waffles. Incredible head and body as well. Lacing also remarkable.  The smell was intense chocolate and coffee and just breaded deliciousness. The taste was tremendous and the alcohol was all but undetectable. This one played to what was advertised- not much to say than what hasnt already been said.  Bitterness was great and matched great with the coffee with a slim carbonated mouthfeel.

1199,11757,jaxon53,4.62,"Thankyou to Faro, for sending me this amazing beer in the Secret Santa '07. This isn't my first run at this beer, just my first chance to review it. Served at cellar temperature, in an Imperial pint glass, from a twelve ounce brown, stubby bottle. Poured a deep thick black, almost like a cup of freshly brewed black coffee. Good thing I used an Imperial pint glass, to hold the amazing, three finger, coarsely bubbled, chocolate brown head. A huge head from a rather gentle pour. Head seemed never ending, leaving generous gobs of thick, sticky lace on the glass. Smell was thick with black coffee, some bitter sweet chocolate aromas, and some nice roasted/toasted malts and oats. A great nose on this one. A great flavor to it as well. More bitter black coffee, some sweet chocolate notes, and tons of flaked oats. Finished rather smooth and bitter with a tiny bit of warming alcohol. Just the perfect amount of carbonation. A nice smoothmouthfeel that seems a bit thin, but thin in a perfect way. Very good drinkability. The perfect start to the day.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ejquin,4.22,"A: Dark black with thin brown head that fades relatively quickly and leaves little lacing.  S: Deep coffee smell. Almost as if there were grinds floating on the beer. This was mixed with a hop brightness. Dark chocolate.  T: In line with the aroma. Heavy on the coffee/espresso, fading to a dark chocolate, with slight hop bitterness on finish. There's some fruit in the aroma as well, orange peel or cherry. A combo of that bitterness, dryness and chocolate linger on finish with some perception of the alcohol.  M: Smooth, good carbonation.  Ovr: Very very good, but to me it wasn't unbelieveable. It's unique in the amount of cofee in the aroma and taste, and is balanced nicely. All in all a very nice stout beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,prototypic,4.4,"Appearance: It's a very dark brown (nearly black) color with a creamy, cocoa head. Head was rather minimal and retention was short. A chocolaty colored lace was left behind.  Smell: It has a strong, initial dark chocolate and espresso aroma. That's followed by a nice wave of roasted malts. It has a slight smoked smell to it and a hint of a cherry fragrance on the tail.  Taste: Very strong espresso taste dominates. Dark chocolate flavors and toasted malts filter in and give it a very robust, complex flavor. Hops are not very noticeable. Slight smoky taste rounds it out. Chocolate and espresso flavors stick with the palate.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's definitely thick and made for sipping. Carbonation is excellent. Extremely smooth and drinkable. ABV is perfect for this beer. Given its stature, it's a beer to savor. But, very drinkable nonetheless. Overall, it's a classic.

Smell is wonderfully complex. I smell tofee, caramel malts, chocolate, cofee, and roasted malts. Faint piney and citrusy hops pull through, very faint though. As the beer warms I get an undertone of mint.  Taste is sweet upfront with some caramel and chocolate malts. This is followed by roasted barley and cofee bitterness. Undertones of mint come out as well. As the beer warms I get a tofee flavor as well. Hopping is low but citrusy and coarse with a slight pineyness. Tannins are kept in check very well.

1199,11757,pmcadamis,4.46,"A - An inky black viscous brew pours out of the bottle, and immediately forms a growing dark brown, almost purple head that recedes to a cap and a fatter collar as it turns a lighter shade of brown. It's still a pretty dark colored head. The brew lets absolutely no light through, and swirling leaves a lot of really nice dark brown lace on my snifter while building up the head and turning the head a darker shade of brown. I've never seen any color change from swirling before.  S - Dark roast coffee, espresso, Count Chocula marshmallows, woody bark, and slightly burnt oatmeal. I'm picking up some Hershey's dark chocolate syrup too.  T - Rich dark chocolate and super dark espresso all over the place! I'm a big coffee lover, and this one has got ""chocolate mocha cappuccino with a few extra shots of espresso and with whipped cream and chocolate shavings on top."" This reminds me of those Starbucks cappuccino milk cold drinks that come in the little bottles....but with extra espresso and dark chocolate syrup.  M - Rich, creamy, extra full bodied, and smoothly carbonated with tiny tingly bubbles that never feel raspy. Silky and exquisite.

I actually think it's the thickest beer I've seen when pouring...yet it goes down normally. A dark brown head sits atop. A little lacing, but nothing too extreme. Smells a lot like coffee and a European-style dark chocolate cocoa. Roasted goodness! The taste is sweeter and more chocolate as the beer is cool, but it becomes very much like coffee as it warms. The oats mellow things out and make it go down way too easily. They also kill the over bitter, over roasted aftertastes of many coffee stouts. Wow. I find myself drink this way too fast. This is over 5%. You'd never know as it goes down like an oatmeal stout, but it has the flavor of the best imperials out there. I seriously wish I could have this all the time.

It was very black with not much of a head that went down very quickly and left a thin dark brown lacing down to the bottom of the glass. There was carbonation to my surprise when held up to the light.  I had flash backs to the smell of my grandfathers coffee brewing on the stove top and a hint of unsweetened chocolate and dry oats.  The ABV is not over powering but I would consider it a winter warmer. I sipped it very slow and enjoyed ever swallow. It felt very good swirling it around in my mouth before swallowing. I had a total of 3 bottles out of a 4 pack in a four hour period and I felt completely satisfied. Very filling in my opinion.

Very little lacing. I didn't have a snifter on hand so I had to use a stubby little tulip that had some room for swirling. Other reviewers report lots of head and lacing, maybe my glass wasn't clean enough or my pour not vigourous enough. Who knows, still impressive to look at.  Smell is almost all coffee, alcohol is there to warm the nose and mouth but it really isn't there in the smell (or is masked by the coffee). Excellent. I couldn't smell the chocolate until the beer warmed, and even then it was pretty muted. Good thing i love coffee.  Taste again is coffee, dominating at first. As it warms the other ingredients come through, chocolate and oatmeal, I didn't get any hops, but i didn't miss it. This beer looks, smells, and tastes delicious.  Mouthfeel--oh the mouthfeel. I think a big part of my dislike of stouts is the heaviness. This beer, although big and over 8% ABV, seems lighter than i would have expected. Medium carbonation and medium heavy body work perfectly for me. Didn't weigh me down at all.  Drinkability is so high. i had to keep myself from downing this too quickly. A truly world class beer from a terrific brewery--the best stout i have ever had, perhaps the best i will ever have as i tend not to like thick, dark, heavy beers. Now i just have to find the Kentucky BS.  2008 Version: Pretty much the same as I remember it. Coffee still dominates and chocolate plays a nice backup role that lingers and expands with time.

1199,11757,Floydster,4.43,"12 ounce bottle acquired in a trade with bassmantin last month, thanks for giving me the chance to try this beer  Review #425, December 1st  Poured into my Dogfish Head snifter with a black color and a two inch light brown/tan head, took two or three minutes to settle and left huge amounts of lacing from the very top of the glass to the bottom  Smell was entirely coffee, it pretty much took over anything else that was potentially in there, expected a lot of cocoa in the aroma but could not distinguish any, smelled like walking into a Starbucks store  Taste was enormous amounts of oatmel and loads of chocolate, the coffee smell was definitely in the taste as well, but mostly in the dry aftertaste that stuck around for quite some time, got sweet pretty quickly as it warmed, this one was purely malt, no hoppiness whatsover, very chewy and syrupy towards the end, also large amounts of nutty creaminess, did not like the taste near as much at the ""Kentucky"" version from Founders, good mix between three different things, nice oatmeal chocolate coffee taste overall  Lots of carbonation for a stout, maybe a little too much, the head was massive, and the body was extremely full and thick, overwhelming mouthfeel  Could probably drink a four pack of these, but slowly because it is filling, especially after a meal, again I could not picture myself drinking a breakfast stout in the morning, but the name is fitting, eight percent alcohol is well hidden and the beer is smooth, making it easy to drink  Another fantastic beer from Founders, definitely deserves all of its hype and I highly recommend it, a little disappointing after its barrel aged version, but still very good, I might be a little biased currently because I have drank so many amazing stouts lately as well, wih I could get this stuff regularly in California, wish I had another one in my refrigerator",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,letsgopens,4.56,"This selection pours a completely opaque black with no visible highlights. The frothy brown head holds well and leaves some good lace. Very impressive, certainly what I like to see.  Heavily roasted malt and cocoa in the nose. Some good coffee and a dark molasses sweetness. Not overwhelming on the nose and the best part is that it allows you to be surprised by the deep complexities of the flavor. One of the only times that a relatively mellow aroma is a positive to a beer of this style. Very interesting.  Deep and earthy. Bitter dark chocolate and some strong coffee grounds. Roasty and bold with just a hint of smoke and booze. One often overlooked quality that I look for in this style is a light note of leafy hops. Not too decadent or very sweet so the hops get to shine just a bit. Certainly adding to the complexity. Big, bold, and flavorful.  Heavy and syrupy with a great thickness that allows the flavor to really lie on the palate and linger. Moderately carbonated, brightening up the finish a bit. A nice bitter cocoa aftertaste as well. Really nice; an excellent example of how this style can vary in some really great ways. Founders rules again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,marksto,4.07,"Lucky enough to find a bottle at an Indy beer bar (Badaboomz), since all the retailers are already out of this year's version. Picked one up to take home and review in an optimal setting.  Poured into a snifter after allowing to warm up, appears black with a light tan head that lasts pretty well. Aroma is dominated by coffee/espresso and roast with a little light chocolate in the background. Flavor is again dominated by roasted coffee elements, especially up front, and then dark chocolate notes in the finish. The body is medium, I think a little more chewness might be more appropriate here. There is a nice complexity to the roast and dark chocolate flavors here, but to me this beer is accented a little too strong towards both - a little more body and sweetness would make for a better balance and offset the bitterness.  Overall, an aptly named beer, as coffee and espresso notes are definitely dominate and if you don't like these breakfast beverages you likely won't be big on this beer. I'm an occasional fan of them, and as such I like this beer but not as much as many others do. Worth a try if you get the chance, but not one to die for.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The head was a beautifully creamy and rich espresso brown.  Wow, this is a beer I could smell all evening wihtout having a sip and still enjoy it. There is a powerful aroma of fresh roasted coffe. It is surrounded by dark chocolate, oats and lots of roasted malts.  The taste is also of coffe mixed with sweet chocolates and malty oats. I would highly suggest letting this one warm up and everything will really magnify.  The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but well carbonated.

1199,11757,JDV,3.68,"Thick black pour. Very oily looking out of the bottle. Gives a nice sized brown creamy head in a snifter. Smell is of coffee grinds almost exclusively, and roasted malt. Taste is very coffee like. Not getting any oatmeal or sweetness, but rather big roasty malt, and burnt, slightly bitter coffee grounds. It could use a bit more sweetness to pull it all together in my opinion, but it is still good. Overall, too burnt, and not enough sweetness. Good coffee beer, but I don't get oatmeal or chocolate, nor do I like it as much as I had hoped...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,MiScusi,4.66,"Thanks to nflmvp for this bottle, 12oz twist-off bottle. There is no dating on it or anything, but I'm thinking it was probably bottled in the fall of 2006 or so, which would make it about 1 year old (the recommended cellar time per the brewery too).  As I pour the liquid into a mug it appears to be a very thick murky dark brown. It starts forming a huge brown head and leaves great lacing. The aroma I get is not as potent as I thought it would be. I was expecting coffee in the aroma but instead got chocolate and roasted barley- not too bad. The taste starts out with a lot of bitter coffee. That only lasts the first couple sips and then what I mainly taste is roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate. The coffee is always there, and strong, but the roast and chocolate can be detected more as you drink it.  The mouthfeel on this is slick, at about a heavy-light body or so. The carbonation hides within the viscous liquid so as to not tickle the tongue too much. I had this beer for breakfast (why not?), and I don't normally drink beer anywhere near that early, but this went down so easy.. Stands up to every bit of the hype that I've read regarding this beer. Just a great stout overall.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ThatWineGuy,4.6,"I was fortunate to bring one of these back from Dearborn last month, what better gift to oneself for a birthday - the legendary Breakfast Stout. Thanks to the helpful staff at Merchants.  Poured motor oil black with a thin tan head that cleared leaving a wispy surface and a good solid ring around the glass. There were three or four small-bubble centres, an understated carbonation emerging from all that opaque, almost viscose-appearing liquid. The lacing is impressive although thin; more than just legs, a film envelopes the upper part of the glass after a swirl and stays there. The same swirl reporduced a thin head right to the last swallow, very nicely done.  The smell impresses with roast coffee, dark chocolate, lots of smoke, burnt toast. Hints of malted milk to add to the layers of complexity. Taste is rich, dry espresso, dark chocolate, strong roasted backdrop, mocha-coffee with a pronounced nutty bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth and full, substantial body ... then a brazilnut or walnut dryness in a long, lingering finish that impresses. The finish is really quite remarkable as it just stays with you for a long, long time. Overall, there's a myriad of flavours and textures, complex, rich and rewarding; this is a real delight. The only drawback I thought was a bit of astringency that came with the long, drawn out finish. Not recommended for the timid, but essential for every other lover of well crafted beer. Way to go, Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,kpantz,4.35,"Executive Summary: Just as good as the Kentucky Breakfast Stout. Deep aromas and flavors and well-hidden alcohol. A beauty on a cool night.  Appearance: Opaque in my snifter with accents of caramel around the edges. Head is moderate, but reduces to a light film. Lacing is moderate.  Smell: Deep, dirty roasted notes. Coffee and dark chocolate.  Taste: Coffee and chocolate come through quickly...a mild residual bitterness balances the hefty malt bill. A faint alcohol flavor gradually appears as the beer warms to room temperature, but it's quite complementary.  Mouthfeel: Mildly carbonated with a distinct creaminess to it, presumably from the oats. Very, very smooth.  Drinkability: A bit high on the alcohol for a session brew, but I don't know of many Imperial Stouts that fit that description. Flavors are well-mingled and complex. Just a great experience.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,emerge077,4.33,"Poured from the tap with a volcanic chocolate milk head, foamy as could be. Head retention was above average, and there were spindly webs of brown lacing left behind. It was jet black in the fluted tulip glass.  Roasted coffee in the aroma, not huge, but certainly of high quality.  Medium level acidity from the beans, some dark fruit like grape or plum in the initial aftertaste. Deeply roasted chocolate malt serves as the major component, with an unparalleled smoothness from the oats. More drinkable than most beer, and most coffee. This seems slightly more enjoyable on tap, but the novelty may be playing into that for me.  Feeling slightly caffeinated afterward, but I could be just just projecting that. Already had two cups today anyway.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,benito,4.42,"This was one of the first beers that I ever reviewed on this site, and I hadn't been able to get my hands on a bottle in almost exactly three years. I was excited to see one last four pack on the shelves at Holiday Market, and three years turned out to be well worth the wait.  It's jet black with a cocoa-colored head and bouquet screaming of chocolate and coffee. The coffee flavors are really what keep the whole effort together, as it has a unifying and complementary presence throughout the pint. The taste is a complex and harmonious mix of licorice, marshmallow, and cinnamon at the start, chocolate through the middle, and tar, alcohol, and bitters in the finish. This stout has amazing length and flavor diversity as hints of new flavor come out with every sip. The aftertaste is long and lingering.  It has a surprisingly smooth, creamy mouthfeel (the oats must be kicking in here), and it hides the eight-plus percent ABV easily.  An excellent, special beer. One of Founders finest; hopefully, I won't have to wait another three years to have it again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Overlord,4.28,"Thanks to Tevering99 for the trade.  Mammoth pour, with a black, viscous substance coating the entire glass. A preposterously dark head settled down quickly to about a half an inch of carbonation. Great lacing throughout. I don't know if this was bottle conditioned, or what, but the head was gigantic.  The smell, and taste, are powerful and flavorful. Big, roasted chocolate (no surprise) abounds, with plenty of espresso, some dark fruits, and a smoky aftertaste. Delicious, heavy, and packs a wallop.  Not to be missed.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

If you want to impress to a newbie the value of smell, pour this beer and stand back. Strong coffee smell with a hint of cocoa and malt. More cofeee. This isn't just a beer, it is a scented candle.  T. As it smells. Coffee, chocolate and more coffee. Just the hint of sweet malt.  M. Very smooth. This beer just falls down your throat.  D. First, it is strong. Secondly it is rare here. Therefore, limited drinkability.  This beer deserves it's rating unlike many artificially high beers.

1199,11757,Monsone,3.95,"Pours thick and dark (think motor oil). Has a very small dark brown head.  Smells are some dark chocolate malt and BIG coffee scents.  Taste is about the same as the smell. Big coffee with some chocolate and other dark roasty malt flavors.  Mouthfeel is thick and smooth.  Drinkabilty suffers a little. The flavors seem a little too ""in your face"" to have more than one. This is from the '07 batch so maybe some time in the cellar will improve it.  It could be that I had a Surly Darkness on draft the night before, cause the Darkness blows this out the water. Overall, I found it to be pretty good, but I have liked others better (BCS, Darkness, Stone etc.)",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Upgrayedd,4.57,"This four pack is from the 2007 batch, so I'm going to cellar a couple bottles and see how it ages. This is quite possible the thickest beer I have ever poured. I wonder if it has something to do with a high final gravity and the oatmeal content? I brewed a Wee Heavy that had a FG of 1.022, but it did not have the silky smoothness and high viscosity of the Breakfast Stout. Of course it was a deep dark brown like what you'd expect. The taste was not as bold as I had prepped myself for. It had a really subtle roastiness and burnt toffee flavor. The term ""liquid leather"" comes to mind, but in a good way. I couldn't detect any hop bitterness or flavor, but that is to be expected with so many roasted grains.  In comparison to Imperial Stouts like Expedition Stout and Old Rasputin, this does not have that ""kick you in the ass"" boldness. But what it lacks in boldness it makes up for in roasted goodness.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

It subsides somewhat after a bit to reveal a very complex nose. Dark cocoa smokey wood and alcohol blend with the coffee.  t: Taste mimics the smell. Overwhelming coffee (espresso?) dominates for the first couple of sips. As it breathes cocoa and smokey malts reveal themselves. The alcohol is extremely well hidden.  m: I swear this beer is so chewy I think I saw oats floating in it. Thick and hearty.  d: The lack of alcohol taste makes this beer dangerous.

Good, but I liked the aged bottle more, more dry, seemed more refined.  T - Much sweeter than the '06 bottle in the entry. Lots of cream, sweet chocolate and fruit notes. I found the alcohol to be much more assertive. Bitter chocolate in the finish, with the alcohol giving a long lasting impression in finish.  M - A very good, full, silky body on this beer.

S: One of the best smells brews I've ever had the pleasure with. HUGE deep roasted dark coffee beans. Seems almost dominated by the coffee but nice bitter chocolate and just a slight subtle touch of sweet candy syrup. Alcohol phenols are much more subdued compared to the on-tap sampling I had. Very complex, especially for having such a strong coffee punch.  T/M: Smooth and creamy with plenty of body. Almost feels like drinking a good thick espresso. Big coffee body with a profound bitter, unsweetened German chocolate base. The just a hint of sweetness round things out from some Molasses. Also... bananas? Alcohol is again nicely hidden. Starts coming through a bit more as it warms further.  D: Just so damn good. This brew really does live up to the hype.

1199,11757,younger35,4.77,"Received this brew along with a bevy of other beauties in a trade with ClockworkOrange. Ive had the Kentucky Breakfast Stout and it was about the best brew Ive ever had, cant wait to try this one. This one is notched for September. Drank out of a Washington State Cougars pint glass while watching the USC vs. California game.  Appearance- Pours black as black with a decent one finger brown head that recedes fairly quickly. Leaves a lily pad like cap and a very thin collar. Leaves moderate lacing, not bad, not great. Smell- Holy Starbucks! The best part of waking up would be Founders Breakfast Stout in your cup! Oodles of dark roasted coffee shines along with some lightly bitter chocolate. A bit of roasted malt and a slight nuttiness round out the nose. Taste- Starts with a hint of bitter chocolate and lots and lots of sweet roasted malty goodness. After the smell I was expecting a huge blast of coffee but its a bit more subtle than the nose. The coffee is more in the background and semi bitter. A nice milky creaminess is also present with a hint of vanilla. Finishes with a nice bit of citrus hop that somehow manages to peak its head through. The 8.30% doesnt show one bit through all the goodness. Mouthfeel- Nice and rich with a bit of a milky and chewy feel. Medium to low carbonation that is perfect. Drinkability- Couldnt be better.

1199,11757,brewdlyhooked13,3.95,"Appearance - pours like motor oil. Looks a tad disappointing, all that fine black liquid and virtually no head to go with it. But like magic, the head materializes all at once, creating a 2-finger cap of creamy, cratery mocha. The glue-like lace sticks all over.  Aroma - monstrous amounts of roastedness, wonderfully intense coffee and chocolate syrup. A heady layer of alcohol floats underneath it all, pushing the flavors, enhancing them.  Taste - roasted malt to the point of char. A grassy element picked up also. Some elements of coffee and chocolate are fighting to get through, but the overbearing malt roast/burnt flavors ultimately prove to be too much. Spicy, herbal swallow, like jalapenos but not hot. If I wait, there is some better roast coffee and cocoa flavor on the downward side of the aftertaste. I would like more balance to the coffee/chocolate side. This is tasty but too one-sided toward the charred grain.  Mouthfeel - silky, velvety, very smooth. The carbonation is lively and mouth-filling.  Drinkability - I'd like to think the burnt character will mellow over time and some of the rest of the flavor profile can come through. As it is, this beer isn't one I'd go after for myself, but certainly for trades, unless the char eases up over time, then I would put several down for awhile.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Taste is right in line with the smell, coffee with a nice bitterness and some smooth cocoa in the background. Roasted malts and some of the alcohol start to show as it warms. Yum.

I really loved the way it was all blended together. Nothing really overpowering, but the whole mix was just soo smooth. Rich creamy full bodied feel, very thick.

Pretty incredible full mocha tan head envelopes the dark astringently filled dark body that simply eats all light. No ruby highlights here to note just a full jet black zone of color spectrum absorption, that is a thing of beauty my friends. Head dwindles slowly with even bands of evenly dispersed lacing. Aromatics full of deep grains meaning oats and other cereal supplements that are simply remarkable when it comes to beer components. Dark roasted chocolate malt out does all other spectrums when that is all my senses are receiving, quite easily the most amazing beer aromatics I've come across since day one in the beer hunting I've embarked since age nineteen. Flavors come off full of deep dark coffee notes without any cream or sugar straight up just the way us ""old timers"" like it. If we were playing a gracious round of kegs and eggs I would be winning with this dark baker's chocolate dryness and roasted coffee goodness this beer has to offer what can I say, ""I'm licking my bowl"". Yes I know that doesn't sound to manly but when in the moment there's no power higher here on earth. Pure coffee grounds are repeated for me in a beet formula, did I mention I feel this position alone is bliss. Mouthfeel is one of the fullest in the land, with malt outweighing most comprehension of body this beer is fuller than it's custardized midwestern friend that can't be mistaken.

S - Holy smokes. i've got a bad sniffer, but it was clearly a nice dark chocolate and coffee aroma, and I could distinguish the two - really very good.  T - Not very bitter, but rich, coffee and chocolate. Really very nice!  M - perhaps a little thinner than it should be, but good  D - excellent! This beer grows on you. It seems like it's a lot less alcoholic than Guinness, and yet it's certainly not a weak beer. If you expect the bitter bite in a classic, then you'll be disappointed. If you want a rich, darkly flavored tasty stout, this is very good!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Brad007,5,"Pours a very dark color with a head that looks more like chocolate milk, due to being brown and silky. Aroma is rich and creamy with a nice whiff of coffee. Lacing is minimal. Taste is very smooth and creamy with a beautiful chocolate aftertaste. So rich, so beautiful. Nice and chewy. Would make a great breakfast stout, hence the name. The aftertaste is excellent and the delivery totally rules. There's even a hint of oats in the taste.  While not as strong as Worldwide Stout, this beer is still a great sipping beer. Both are probably the only stouts that I've had so far that deserve their ratings.  In regards to Founders, you cannot improve a beer like this. I haven't had the Kentucky variant but this one alone is what a stout should be.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,jackorain,4.32,"I absolutely love the label on this bottle.  A-Pours like used motor oil. This stuff is so thick it glugs. It is pitch black with absolutely no possibility of light getting through. After the fairly aggressive pour into my Dvel tulip, a 3/4 inch coffee with lotsa cream colored head erupted. This head fell rather quickly to a thickish coat and tall collor. The coat and collar hung around for quite a long time during the imbibbing. There was only a modicum of lacing.  S-Dark roasted coffee, creamy iced latte made with dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate galore, Roasted Barley, grain, hint of molases.  T-Intense coffee flavor translates to a nice coffee flavor, dark and bittersweet choclate. Roasted grains, graininess. the molases from the nose presetns itself a little more asertively. There is a sour twang from the roasted grains or even the molases notes. The finish is long and bitter with a drying, astringent quality.  M-This is where this beer shines. Full body is an understatement. Creamy, chewiness throughout. Carbonation compliments the creaminess.  D-The initial, almost overwhleming coffee flavor hurts the drinkability for me on this one. Also hurting the drinkability is the lasting astringency on the finish. Don't get me wrong this beer is a fine, fine product that I will seek and out surely have again. But it is most likely a beer I could have only one or two (maybe) of before shelving for the future.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Smell of coffee and smoky roasted malts dominate the aroma. Taste of rich espersso with bitter dark chocolate, almost kalhua like taste makes it deliciously sweet with just enough bitterness to compliment the flavors.

1199,11757,becktone,4.66,"At a bar on a scrap sheet of paper:  Eye: Jet black in color with a tan head and some okay lacing and poorer than I expected head retention. Though I can't fault the head retention and lacing as so much of that depends on the cleanliness of the glassware. It could be the glassware, and most likely is in this case, as it is a glass from a bar that really only gets dipped in sanitizer solution, not much washing to go on to clean grease or other residue from the glass.  Nose: Massive chocolate and coffee aromas in this brew, not much to hop aroma. The largeness of the aroma makes it apparent that this is an American Double/Imperial Stout. Roasted aromas as well. Excellent aroma, couldn't stop smelling this one, just smelled so good.  Tongue: Here I find a nice roasted malt flavor, perhaps some black malt and chocolate malts are in there. Coffee flavors and chocolate flavors meld nicely with the roasted flavor. It is really easy to see why this one is called ""Breakfast Stout."" Seems to me that this would pair very nicely with breakfast just as coffee does, or I could even see this being a brew that would break one's fast in a very full and complete way.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: On the palate this brew is very thick and has a long lasting flavor that is of almost burnt, but not quite that harsh, roasted, toasted grain flavors. The brew is very smooth on the palate with medium, and appropriate levels of carbonation. This is a great beer to drink, not one to session though, 8.3% is a little high. As I said I could see drinking this with my breakfast, it is appropriately named.

Head reappears if you swirl the glass around and slowly runs back down the inside of the glass. Coffee smell is the first thing that jumps out along with some appetizing roasty and burnt malt smells. Great roast coffee flavor along with a sweetness in the middle of a mocha-ish flavor. There is a light booziness when it warmed up noticeable only in the smell, not taste.

A: Pours an Obsidian black, darker than a moonless night. It pours with a huge thunderous head with tons of tiny bubbles that get foamy on top, like sea foam in the gulf on a warm September afternoon. The head dies down to a nice cap but some of the foaminess is left behind sticking to the top of my snifter.  S: Wonderful smelling stout. TONS of chocolate and fresh brewed coffee. There are hints of vanilla and perfectly roasted malt. This reminds me of my favorite cafe mocha which I happened to sip at a sidewalk café in Paris.  T: I really like great stouts and this is one of them. The flavors are off the scale. BAM in your face. Tons of rich creamy chocolate. Reminds me of the cocoa my grandmother (god rest her soul) used to prepare for me on a cold Indiana morning as a child. So chocolaty, sweet, and warming. All of that is then overtaken by a coffee taste as good if not better than the best espresso known to man.  M: Medium bodied and a creaminess that is off the scale.  D: Man wish I had some more of this one. As I finish this one my brother is in an Indiana beer store trying to hunt me down the 2007 version. Let's hope he scores!  Overall: Founders make some of the greatest stouts in the world. Hands down, no doubt about it. This one is so rich and creamy, and the taste and aroma is out of this world 5 star no doubt about it.

A lot of coffee in the nose. LOTS of coffee. This beer reminded me a lot of the KBS which reminded me of a homebrew failure I made about a year ago. The coffee is just overpowering and then the bitter chocolate comes through and makes for a bit of a mess for me. Obviously I am not in the majority as this is, at time of review, #12 on BA's top 100. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for me, not watery, but with all these conflicting tastes in my mouth, I expected the malt to help balance a bit more, which for me means a thicker, maltier beer.

1199,11757,seaoflament,4.87,"First off I need to send mad props to Jay23 for this beer, thanks!  This is from the most recent batch. Poured at cellar temp.  Pours a dark chocolate color with some light brown foam.  Oh man the smell! You can smell this one as it pours. There is some sweet chocolate, powdered cocoa, coffee, vanilla bean, roasted malts, and oats; easily one of the best smelling stouts I've encountered. The aroma is, dare I say, orgasmic. I'm just taking my time with this one, letting it warm up a bit more to get some more aromas before I take my first sip. This is one of the most chocolate smelling stouts I've had in front of me, very nicely done.  Fist sip is pure bliss. The taste really holds up well with the aromas. Chocolate and coffee flavors upfront with some slight burnt barley and chocolate malts in the finish. Some oats also detected towards the end along with some bitter chocolate. Big aftertaste as well. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, rich and thick. This is a chocolate and coffee elixir. The slightest hint of alcohol is present to remind you that this is an alcoholic beverage.  The drinkability is very good but it could start to feel a little too sweet after one glass.  I could eat this stuff for breakfast. Screw Starbucks coffee, gimme some Breakfast Stout in the morning.  ***Update***  Thanks to Jay23 for this extra. 2008 edition.  Great looking beer, as always has been my experience with Breakfast Stout. Pitch black color with more than an inch of foam with some lacing and very good retention. (4.5)  A blast of coffee and chocolate at first but once I finished pouring, the smell coming from the glass was a little underwhelming. The coffee aroma doesn't seem as bold and robust, or even fresh as it has in the past. More chocolate and roasted malts with hints of vanilla and sugar cookies. Some whiffs of alcohol too. Has a somewhat acidic coffee aroma. (3.5)  The taste is similar to the aroma and also not as great as I remembered, or at least not as good as the 07 and 06 release. Faint chocolate, coffee, roasted barley flavors. Baker's chocolate in the finish. Roasted bitterness in the aftertaste as well as some cocoa powder. (3.5)  Feels a tad thin and watery but good overall. (4)  Quite easy to drink but I'm in no need of a spoon this year and that kind of sucks.

Head was a thick khaki beige. The smell is of strong freshly brewed coffee, dark chocolate, burnt sugar, and burnt/smokey malts. Taste of black roasty coffee, dark bakers chocolate, and burnt toast. (This would make a great dessert beer!) Some slight tart hops comes out in the finish. It seems to balance everything out. Mouth feel is thick, very creamy, lot of carbonation, coats your mouth, sticky. Flavors stay around awhile. A slow slipper for sure!

1199,11757,zdk9,4.58,"A- Pours an obsedian black. I search in vain for lighter highlights only to find an impenatrable wall of tar. Half a finger of dark cocoa foam resides briefly on the surface, dissipating to leave spots of thin residual lacing.  S- Coffee and espresso are the delicious forerunners in the nose. Quick on their heels follows sweet fruit- cherries, a delicious suprise. With more snifting a hint of alcohol comes out, refined and whisky toned.  T- There is a wonderful balance to this beer in which the espresso is strong but not dominating. There is more fruit here- cherries again, and also blueberries and sweet manderin orange. The chocolate flavor is faint; perhaps I can detect it in the sweetness of the beer, but that might just be malt, and I certainly can't pick out bittersweet chocolate over the bitterness of the coffee. Playing the beer over the back of my tongue reveals the touch of hoppiness which borders between Christmas Holly, and earthy mulch. Later the hops are strong in my burps.  M- A wonderful silkiness, getting better as the beer warms, and a true mouth coater. I also enjoyed that the bitterness of the beer didn't clench onto my tastebuds, but relaxed its hold and made way for sweetness to come forth, bringing a similar but new wave of flavor with it.

T - The taste begins with a light tickling carbonation and a bitter coffee taste. The taste remains light and bitter for a good while, the dark toasty maltiness finally comes in, creamy this time. The aftertaste is really an amalgamation of all the flavors tasted here, but more bitter than creamy.  M - The consistency is actually pretty thick here, which I prefer in a stout.

The smell is sweet sweet coffee with a slight chocolate background. The taste isn't as chocolaty as I remember and the mouthfeel isn't as thick either, but it could be all of the release of carbon dioxide.

The head has great staying power and lacing was tremendous.  SMELL: An unexpected citrusy hop aroma along with huge amounts of chocolate and coffee. Vague fruity undertones were also detected. I just wish I could smell better in smoky bars.  TASTE: Mega roasty coffee flavors. Just huge. Large amounts of chocolate as well. A mild citrusy hop flavor is present, particularly in the finish. Toffee and caramel hints begin to come out as it warms.  MOUTHFEEL: Huge and chewy. You may need a spoon for this one. Carbonation level is low to med level and appropriate.  DRINKABILITY: Simply excellent. Nothing more to say.  Thanks so much to Matt for giving me and so many others the chance to try this fantastic beer.  EDIT 8-21-08: Drinking a 1-year-old bottle, the hops have completely dropped out. Any roasty harshness is also gone. It's just a smooth, chocolate-caramel-coffee-fruity-toffee luxury at this point.

Tastes of a smooth, huge roasted barley with a touch of sweet cream. The trademark taste here is a green sappy, freshly cut twig. You won't find that anywhere else. There's also a perfect blend of coffee here along with some campfire roasted marshmallows. The finish is a delicate espresso.

Coffee, chocolate, leather, soy, tobacco, vanilla and some maple in the nose.  Starts sweet with a lot of chocolate then moves into earthier flavors like tobacco, fermented soy, and maple wood. Finishes with espresso with a nice amount of bitterness to counter the sweetness. I was expecting a very sweet and thick stout, surprisingly this is very balanced and never overwhelmed the palate.

First whiff is reminiscent of irish coffee, followed by levels of toffee, alcohol, coffee, sugary malts, then more coffee. Taste is as expected, warmingly alcoholic, heavy on coffee, with just hints of oatmeal. Unfortunately, although the aroma is somewhat balanced, the taste is unidimensional, overpowering coffee and more coffee. Full-bodied, it is a bit too heavy for ""breakfast"".

The taste, wow, to start off with, this is a very thick and chewy stout translating to a very nice mouthfeel.

A: Served pretty warm - approaching 60F(?). Huge creamy/foamy tan head, at least 3-fingers high. Lasted a long time before slowly receding; at one point I scooped some out for a taste. It was frothy like a latte and left behind some very pretty lace. Liquid appeared thick and virtually black.  S: All rich dark chocolate and enormous roasted coffee aroma, bitter yet sweet. Not quite as heavenly as the Kentucky Breakfast Stout (which is about as amazing as can be), but a very fine smelling strong stout.  T: Taste buds beware, this is full of very dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee and a bit of sour astringency that is delicious, tantalizing and tongue-twisting. Notes of fruit, molasses and vanilla keep the sweet/bitter/sour flavors in check, but they really do seem to dance with every sip, every inhale/exhale. A fine, complex & wonderfully flavored (strong) stout.  M: Creamy, carbonated abundantly but not overbearingly. Considerable stickiness on the lips and a little burning bitter/sour-ness left on the tongue. Full body and a little alcohol warmth.  D: Not the type of beer you want to drink alot of, but definitely one you want again. Excellent flavors and aroma, a beauty in most every way. I'm thankful we have a couple more of these to enjoy and highly recommend this beer to anyone fortunate enough to have access to it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ncvbc,4.97,"Definitely a top-notch double stout and probably my favorite for now. Basically pitch black forming a creamy tan head when poured vigorously into my glass. A tan ring remained on top throughout and left good lacing. Fresh coffee grounds almost like a black coffee straight from the pot. Some sweetness from chocolate also comes through. I would sit there and sniff on this all day but it's beer for a reason. Though I've had other great tasting double stouts, this one seems to hit the nail on the head. I'm sure I'll run into something that competes in terms of flavor but for now this is the pinnacle. Super dark coffee and a chocolate sweetness again with little to no alcohol to be found. Mouthfeel is close to full and very rich. Quite satisfying all around. Drinkability is exceptional as well. I've had plenty of beers and this is one of my all around favorites.  Thanks to jmp30 for the great trade.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Absumaster,3.87,"Thanks to todd1 for this one! A inky black colored beer pours very viscous and has a very small head which isn't even a head, but a thin brown layer against the glass.  Smell is deep, with coffee, chocolate and an oilyness, which reminds me of oats or barley. It is kind of boozy and also has some soy sauce in it.  Taste of cold coffee and dark unsweetened chocolate. The coffee and dark malts give the beer a good maltbitterness, much higher than the 25 IBU mentioned here. There is so much going on in the beer that is all best described as ""brown and dark"" tastes, one time the coffee is very pronounced, the other time there is the sweet malty chocolate. Mouthfeel is a little sticky and aftertaste is maltbitter and a little sweet.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,alohaC,4.37,"One of many fresh 07 bottles thanks to hoppymeal. Pours a deep, dark brown almost black with virtually no head. A thin, light brown/cinnamon head does bubble up, but quickly dissipates leaving a ring that clings to the glass with nice lacing. An aroma of big chocolate malts and dark roasted coffee hits you like a ton of bricks. Im a coffee lover and this just smells damn good. Balanced, smooth and slightly chewy on the palate with big coffee flavor punching through. A touch of bitterness like a cup of straight black dark roast coffee. Finishes smooth and slightly dry. Next to Peche Mortel, this is one of the best coffee stouts Ive had. If it had enough caffeine to offset the alcohol, I could drink this for breakfast everyday. Definitely a beer that lives up to its billing and a real flagship beer from one of my favorite brewers.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BMoney575,4.48,"Sampled on 4-13-07  Pours a very thick and viscous oily black, with a big tan head that tells you that it's serious.  Smell is of used coffee grounds, with notes of licorice and molasses.  Taste is fantastic! Like a good cup of coffee, with a good roasted malt character. Bitter on the finish, like coffee, super smooth with well-covered alcohol.  Mouthfeel is good, thick and creamy, it adds to the coffee flavor.  Drinkability is also good, but it's a big beer.  Overall probably the best coffee beer I've had. Even better with six months on it, I look forward to trying one at a year.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,cameraman,4.62,"A pitch black color, opaque, with a dark caramel colored head that forms slightly and dissolves away quickly. The scent in a word, DAMN! There is alot coming out when smelling this beer. It starts with a combination of chocolate and coffee fragrances, and it blends itself to a sweet oatmeal scent. The taste is well blended flavor of chocolate, then to coffee, and fianlly to the oatmeal, with slight touch of bitterness at the end. A rich feel, yet very smooth, light syrupy texture at the back, it does have very nice dry finish. Man, this is an excellent stout, an intense aroma, very strong flavor and a wonderful mouthfeel, make this a very drinkable beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,barefootbrewer,4.13,"This beer poured a thick oily black color with a dark tan/brown head  it filled me with anticipation. The aroma was quite coffee like with roasted notes and a hint of chocolate. The taste was bitter and had flavors of toasted coffee and malt. Chocolate was quite noticeable as well. This made for a bold beer with good flavor synthesis. The mouthfeel was thick and chewy  just what one would like from such a delightful brew. This is a very delicious stout  drinkable in that it is quite well balanced, but perhaps a bit intense to drink more than one or two in a sitting.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ultralarry2006,4.5,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Leaves less than a one finger espresso-foam-colored head that quickly recedes into only a foam ring at the edge, but it is beautiful while it lasts. There is a little bit of spotty lacing. Body is a deep and rich black. Very nice to behold.  Smell - Coffee, coffee, and oh, did I mention coffee ? Wow, this smells of both brewed coffee, and of espresso, as well as roasted coffee beans. There is also hearty roasted dark malt. Wake up and smell the coffee/beer ?, Wow !  Taste - as indicated by the nose. Bitter, rich espresso competes with hearty, rich roasted dark malt for your tasting pleasure, and the coffee frequently wins. Rich, bitter, and hearty. Ocassionally a taste of spicy alcohol adds it's two cents to the taste buds, but mostly the alcohol is very well hidden.  Mouthfeel - full, and very dry.  Drinkability - this is very, very good ale, and quite unique. The high abv holds down sessionability, but like I said, it's quite hearty and delicious. The coffee/espresso thing also makes it ideal for and/or with dessert. Yum, yum ! Enjoy often.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,drseamus,4.32,"I served this at cellar temperature into my DFH snifter. It pours jet black with a very thin mocha head that falls quickly. The aroma is all strong coffee and dark chocolate. There is also some sweetness in the background. The taste is really powerful. The coffee just smacks me in the face and brings its friends roasted and dark chocolate to work me over also. The dark chocolate lingers beyond the rest of the flavors and there is some sweetness as well. I expected a bit smoother flavor from the oatmeal, but it wasn't there. This is a good beer but certainly not a session beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,MICAMD,4.35,"A- Pitch black liquid settles into the tulip. The pretty light caramel head is about one finger thick and takes awhile to settle. Given a quick swirl, more head forms and leaves a nice thin layer for the entire drink. Leaves some nice lacing.  S- Coffee, coffee, and more coffee. At first it's a little overwhelming, but upon more drinking and warming of the liquid, more becomes apparent. Chocolate, cinnamon, oatmeal, a great roastiness. A good amount of sweetness. A little less coffee and a little more everything else and this would be a 5.  T- Same as the smell but with a little more emphasis on the roastiness. Same thing- would be a 5 with less coffee. We'll see where this goes with a little more time in the cellar.  M- Velvety smooth and just the right amount of carbonation. A little bit of coffee bitterness at the tip of the tongue. A little bit too thin.  D- Not something that I am going to dream about, but it is very good. I am very curious as to how this will age.

Nearing the end of my second 4-pack...If I could get my hands on this beer more often, I would more than likely become an alcoholic and probably make no apologies for it... Appearance-Dark like midnight during a new moon. It beckons me with a black caress looking like Elvis left his painting and all I'm left with is a frame full of black velvet. A small almost non-existant head but what is there is a dark rich brown that clings to the edges of my glass... Smell-Dark Chocolate, nuts and an awesome aroma not usually found outside a Starbucks. Dark rich roasted coffee...mmm.... make mine a double shot please... Taste-Unbelievable. The perfect balance between chocolate, roasted coffee, cream, oatmeal, and a mild alcohol warning lying in wait. Mouthfeel-Perfect. Thick, rich, and creamy. Perfect carbonation and the feel on my tongue and in my mouth is heaven. Drinkability-Near perfect. I could drink this for Breakfast...Lunch, Dinner, Bedtime Snack....whenever. If it wasn't for minor details like the 8.5 ABV, this would be a 5 in my book. Digs",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Metalmonk,4.5,"I actually had this for breakfast. Served at cellar temperature, no additional cooling.  Poured a thick toasted brown head under black black black color, good head retention with wild splotches and striations of lace later on.  Coffee dominates the aroma, with roasted nuts, chocolate malt-o-meal, and toffee. Everything has a toasty, roasted vibe.  Awesome flavor. I'm glad I enjoy good coffee, because that seems almost a prerequisite for appreciating this stout. Coffee, yes, but also toasted chocolate, with a delicate sweetness, rich but not overbearing. Also some roasted filbert nuts and chocolate-covered coffee beans. Pleasant toasted (almost-burnt) bread taste in the finish. A lactic sweet creaminess surrounds the other flavors.  Creamy and silky mouthfeel, not as thick and sticky as the flavors would suggest.  An excellent stout. The alcohol is almost undetectable, which also works in its favor if you really want to drink this for breakfast. Completely works as a stand-in for a breakfast shake, yet can hang with the best stouts on any occasion. But tomorrow it's back to the faithful raisin bran and OJ.

The head dissipates fairly quickly, leaving few clumps on the top and small lacing on the sides.  S: Pure coffee, roasted malts, and chocolate hit the nose first. Light Some slight oatmeal and grassy hops come out as well. Smells yummy.  T: Sure does bring the coffee. Bitter chocolate, some roastiness and some slight oatmeal is there as well. Thats some good coffee..Hops come in the end, leaving a surprising bite on my tongue.  M: Full/medium body with a medium to somewhat high level of carbonation- Im not too sure about this. To me, it would suit the beer a whooole lot better if it were more smooth or heavy.  D: Easily drinkable, especially if youre a fan of coffee. While I think it is over hyped (#12 on top 100?!) it is still enjoyable; Best coffee taste in a stout I have had.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Flavors are rich and full. There is a bitter chocolate flavor, and a definite coffee quality. Character is a bit dry, there is some creaminess from the malts, and just a hint of bitterness and crispness on the finish.  Mouthfeel is good, I was hoping for a bit more thickness, but it's still fine.  Drinkability is quite good. This is a tasty and enjoyable stout. Very drinkable for an 8.30% ABV beer.

M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Leaves the mouth feeling bone-dry.  D: A good stout, but for me, this one is far from worthy of the hype it receives.

1199,11757,leftmindedrighty,4.11,"4pk of this brew acquired in a trade with objectivemonkey  According to the notch on the label, this one was packaged in October, I'm assuming 2006  Smell is of solid coffee and alcohol, this brew smells hot, and that has me a little worried.  Taste brings about different realizations, big coffee and oatmeal notes really spank the taste buds, I love the oatmeal flavor its giving off, reminds me of an Imperial Oatmeal Stout. Alcohol is noticeable, scratch that, very noticeable, but keep in mind the dark flavors really balance it. I taste some bitter chocolates, but they are more of an afterthought to the oats, coffee, and alcohol, which really are the dominant forces in this one.  Overall, I really liked this one, and I'm glad I have three more. If you like stouts, whether they're Double, Cream, Coffee, Oatmeal, Imperial, or otherwise, I would bet dollars to donuts that you would like this beer a whole mess of a lot.

1199,11757,Oxymoron,4.69,"Thanks to jdoolin for the trade, and I see why this beer has all the hype. The pour is a black color with limited brown hues and limited transparency when held to the light. A darker tan head that did hid to the side of the glass and remained throughout the tasting.  The nose was awesome. Malt aromas blended through out with very nice distinct fragrances. Dark chocolate mixes with some oatmeal and rich vanilla bean coffee ester. Some light roasted notes and a slight lactic/milky feel as well. Overall very impressive.  The taste, overall very impressive. A malty flavor that emphasizes the coco chocolate flavor. Has a really nice rich, dark chocolate flavor. The oatmeal comes out more then the nose indicated and blends well for a smooth flavor. The roasted flavor is lighter and has more of an earthy flavor that blends lightly with the hops.  The body is great with a full feel with an easy to drink. There is a little silky feel and no phenolic or alcoholic esters that overpower. The carbonation is a bit high for feel but the nit-picky. Very impressive overall and a must have for every beer lover. Thanks again, jdoolin!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Kaluah, roasted coffee, and vanilla fudge.  Taste is very chocolatey, coffee/chocolate sweetness fades into coffee bitterness.

Anyway, the beer looked the same both times: black with a nice brown head. The mouth-feel was very smooth and the drinkability was pretty good. I liked this one a lot more the second time I drank it. I did enjoy this one more than the Terrapin Wake-N-Bake which is a very good beer itself.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Lacing was apparent on the sides of the glass. Smell is dark chocolate, malts and to a lesser degree coffee. Taste is pretty much the same with a touch of alcohol being present. I've been drinking alot of this years bottled version and on draft the coffee is nowhere near the level it is in the bottle. Mouthfeel is full, heavy, creamy and quite pleasant. Everything I would want in a stout. My scores would be higher if it had a little more of the coffee characteristics that this beer is known for. But that's being picky.

Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer pours and looks like motor oil and has a slim brown-creme colored head. Smell is pretty enjoyable, coffee and chocolate malt being the most prominent. There is quite a bit of coffee in the taste, in fact, mostly coffee. Starts out slightly sweet, but quickly transitions into a strong coffee taste with a slight chocolate lingering and a dry, bitter, coffee finish. A little too much coffee for me. The mouthfeel is full-bodied, chewy and with little carbonation. This beer is reasonably drinkable and in fact, the more I drink it, the less the coffee taste is bothering me. I'm going to bump the taste up to a 4.0. If you like coffee and beer, you'd love Founders Breakfast Stout!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Head is minimal and faint but a rim of deep burnt marshmallow colored bubbles hug the side of the glass.  S: Kahlua, roasted coffee, vanilla bean and fudge  T: Gobs of chocolate in this one. Starts gentle then pounces hard; syrup for just a moment before the icing sets in. Just when you thought it couldn't get any more chocolaty a huge front of fudge cascades down across the tongue. Abbrasive coffee bitterness starts at the tip of the tongue and moves all the way to the back, never ever leaving until the palate is cleared after the beer. Lactose and other rounded sweetness curls up in the center of the tongue, trying not to get victimized but the aggresive coffee tastes. Finishes with a noticeable hop bit, more fresh coffee grounds and slightly cloying dark chocolate.  M: Full bodied, somewhat fuzzy.  D: This is a really good beer with loads of flavor.

It took it's time to decide if it wanted to head up. When it did it was about a half finger's width. It receded to a mild ring. Smell is a sweet milky espresso. I don't detect much in the way of chocolate. Taste continues with the sweetness. Very milky. The chocolate comes through as a chocolate milk. Mouthfeel is very creamy and solid.

Now if only the Kentucky... Alas, on to the beer!  Pours black as squid ink and thick as motor oil into the center of a snifter. Struggles to produce a meek dark tan head that quickly recedes to the edges and escapes back into the abyss. Held directly up to the light it is COMPLETELY opaque. A black hole.  A cyclone of coffee aroma swirls around the snifter, flinging about notes of bittersweet cocoa, burnt caramel, and whisps of soy sauce. Nice!  Loads of roasted malt on the palate. Espresso-like. Or, rather, coffee grounds, and a burnt graininess. Nice dark chocolate. Very full bodied with a nice creaminess imparted by the oats. Finishes firm, roasty, and moderately bitter.  Very nice coffee stout. Still, I dream about the Kentucky Breakfast that I sampled at EBF a couple years ago. Maybe this year it will finally make its way to MA (damn you Illinois!!!), where I can have my step dad run around town to find us some, but this will have to do for now!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

A decent bubbly ring is it's child and bounds to the walls of the goblet rather nicely. Coffee and espresso notes, dark roasted barley, chocolate and traces of cocoa powder on the nose. Very rich upon the initial sips; an espresso-like creaminess with tons of flavorings, most notable are dark roasted coffee beans, brownies and chocolate. There is a sharp bitterness that couples with the massive flavorings of this gem! There are traces of oatmeal, hops and dark fruits--strawberries and pitted cherries.

1199,11757,phisig137,4.44,"Big thanks to Northertimber for this one.  Pour is viscous and thick, deep, menacing black all the way to the edges, and with a one finger brown head. Decent retention falls, leaving little behind. This is pure evil looking black.  Aroma is amazing. Huge coffee aromas of nice French press coffee, a little fresh espresso aroma, and a good amount of raw chocolate. This is not the usual cocoa aroma, this smells more like a grainy, raw chocolate, like you might experience at a chocolate factory. Just about perfect for what it is.  Flavor again is spot on. Up front tastes like acrid roasted coffee that cooled down to room temp, but then as you swallow, different waves of flavor take over. You can actually taste both lightly roasted beans, as well as beans that seem to be burnt. Good amount of char/roasted grain flavor, along with a bit of malty sweetness, and a smooth transition between flavors, possibly from the oatmeal. The finish is pure Willy Wonka, with big time raw chocolate flavors. Oddly, the apparent absence of hops is noted, but not missed. The roasted grains, bitter coffee, and seemingly bitter chocolate make up for the hops, and balance out this stout well. Mouthfeel is very heavy and thick, aided by little carbonation. Drinkability is great, considering the ABV.  Another real winner for Founders. If I were able to get this in my area, I think it may be my winter go-to beer. Truly an exceptional stout.

I received a bottle each of this brew in two separate trades this week so after I had the first I couldn't stop myself from opening the second.  The second bottle looks much the same but has a much stronger coffee aroma that also big in the taste as well.

Rich, potent nose, with some notable alcohol and just exploding with fresh ground dark roasted Kona coffee beans- simply wonderful and the highlight of the beer for me. The palate is equally explosive in the coffee department; bitter fresh ground beans with a sticky sweet stout body. Very smooth mouthfeel like fatty whole milk; it even gave me a beer mustache. Its a bit thick for my tastes, but it's a very wild and fun beer to drink. Extreme roasted flavors. Finishes smooth and semi dry, with a lingering bitter coffee bite that people will be sure to smell on you as you breath near them. Dehydrating and not very refreshing, not that that's a bad thing.

1199,11757,beveritt,4.15,"Presentation: Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a snifter. The label describes it as a double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout and has a picture I can't believe they got approved by the BATF.  Appearance: Pours with a 1/2 inch tan and creamy head. This fades to just the barest of coatings and a slight ring around the edge of the glass. The beer itself is completely opaque, maybe slightly brown around the edges.  Smell: A huge, intensely powerful aroma. Smells strongly of coffee and bitter roasted barley. Slightly sweet, milky chocolate undertone. A hint of hop bitterness.  Taste: A great balance of bitterness from roasted barley, coffee bite and chocolate. Enough residual sweetness form the oats to tie everything together. Nice lingering flavor.  Mouthfeel: Average level of carbonation. Body is nice and full.  Drinkability: A tremendously complex beer that lives up to the hype. Because of its ABV and strong flavors, this is a beer you sip for a few hours, certainly not a session beer.  Notes from 12/19/09 tasting of an 08 bottle: Surprisingly similar to those notes I have from a fresh tasting. Some sediment has developed, but the coffee, chocolate, and bitterness in this one still remain. If anything, some alcohol has faded. Incredibly smooth and enjoyable sipper. Maybe the slightest hint of ""wet cardboard"" oxidation. Wonder if this will change with the switch to pop caps?  Notes from 12/21/09 tasting of an 06 bottle: Once again, surprisingly similar to above comments. This one had great carbonation, poured with a 3 finger + cap of foam. Coffee is still present, though faded significantly. All in all, bitterness is down and semi-sweet chocolate flavors with smooth coffee are more forward. At 3 years, this one is great, could maybe even go a year or two more.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,jjayjaye,4.58,"Pouring this one with a lot of anticipation...completely opaque with a shallow dark tan head that fades fairly quickly to an obstinate ring. Evidence of some effervescence struggling unsuccessfully to keep the froth alive. Smells heavily roasted and dark chocolate. Deep silky smooth texture. First past was predominantly a whiff of dark chocolate with a lingering roast coffee chew on the tongue. As it warms slightly, and the aroma is deeper into the glass, the nose and taste are more of the coffee and oats. Almost a bitter cappuccino towards the end; demands your attention all the way.  Sixpoint Bolshoi had a similar coffee 'take-away but not the same flavor and less intensity... to some degree sweeter. Southern Tier Jah-Va is altogether sweeter. All very good in my book.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BeerCheese,4.18,"Poured from a bottle into my favorite glass about 3 hours after removing it from the fridge. Nice dark brown head on this black colored beer. Average head retention. Smelled coffee first, then chocolate. No real hop aroma. Really didn't care for the first taste, as I prefer a stout with a little less hop character. However, after a few drinks it began to grow on me. I preferred the taste in my mouth to the taste at the back of my tongue while swallowing, which was when the hops really presented themselves. Medium/full body with moderate carbonation.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Estarrio,4.83,"Many, many thanks to Tom at Julio's Liquors for this wonderful brew.  As might be expected, this pours like old, viscous, black motor oil. The darkness defines opacity. The full, sticky, dark chocolate head retains quite well, adding the only sense of color in this bewitchingly, black brew.  Heavy sweet, roasted and chocolate malt aromas in the nose with burnt sugar, caramel and molasses. The fresh ground coffee and espresso scents make me genuinely feel like I'm in a fine coffee shop, awaiting a gourmet cup of joe. There are also subtle hints of hops and a suggestion of alcohol in the nose.  The flavor of this fine brew is the very definition of balance. Sweet, roasted malt blends with chocolate, caramel, dark fruit, burnt sugar and molasses. The sweetness is dulled by an earthy, oatmeal presence and then countered by acidic coffee, espresso and a bitter hop finish. The flavor is complex, balanced and oh so smooth. At 8.30% ABV, the alcohol is nowhere to be found. This brew could replace my morning coffee, serve as my afternoon lunch, replace my evening dinner or make for a sublime dessert. The only problem that I see is that I could literally drink this wonderful beverage all day long.  This delightful stout has a thick, creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel with just enough fizz to remind me that I'm drinking a beer and not a wonderful coffee creation.  I've enjoyed quite a few extreme stouts lately, all with massive ABV and flavor profiles. This beer shows that you don't need an overcharged alcohol profile to make an outstanding stout. There is no criticism that I can offer for this superb creation. This is indeed the best double stout that I've tried to date.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Has a dry bitterness in it from the malts and hops. In the aftertaste coffee just dominates the flavors. Lacks complexity. M- Full body with low carbonation. D- I really wasn't a fan of this. Seems very simple and I really can't see the attraction behind it. Way to much coffee for me also.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Thin, whispy head dissapates quickly.  Aroma is coffee, no doubt. Nice, dark espresso.  Taste is insane. I have a bag of dark chocolate covered espresso beans sitting on my desk, and this beer is without question the liquid version of that. Amazing mouthfeel. Thick and chewy... a perfect match for the bitter dark chocolate flavor of this drink.  The alcohol is completely hidden. Very drinkable.

I'm looking for something in the middle (malt? chocolate?), and I can't find it. I know there's alcohol in here somewhere but I'll be damned if I can taste it.  M: Slippery smooth. Goes down easy, hops linger. The slight bit of carbonation helps.  D: Well, I certainly don't think I can drink this for breakfast... I think if I enjoyed black coffee I would enjoy this more.

1199,11757,malcontent,4.65,"Mastodons met their doom in thinner-looking stuff than this; just a thin layer of tan-ish head crowns the kettle-black brew.  Whoa! Did I just brew coffee? What else? Hmmmnope, just coffee. Good thing I drink pots of the stuff every morning as this smells just fine by me. OK, slight, and I mean slight, toasted oat in the nose as well.  There are hops?!? OK, there is a whole lot of java with a touch of mustiness and bakers chocolate as well but the hops are what caught me off-guard. They work beautifully, however, much in the same context that 3Fs used hops in their amazing Alpha Klaus; an unexpected boost to an already incredibly tasty beer. There IS just a touch too much bitterness on the end that seems to owe more to the baking chocolate taste than the hops.  Mouthfeel is less thick than I would have guessed but still totally satisfying. In fact, most double stouts are so thick that I like to savor one and me done with them. This I could actually see going back to the well for. Note to self; cut back to one pot of coffee per morning and increase consumption of Breakfast Stout.

Dark and murky brown...just one half of a shade lighter than black to the trained eye ;-p ... with a thin peanut butter colored head.  Aroma is strong on coffee with some bitter chocolate and faint crushed oats.  The flavor is practically a liquid form of the smell. It starts with a wallop of coffee that drags you into some dark bakers chocolate. The oats I picked up in the smell aren't really noticeable in the taste. A sweetness is present, but I can't figure out where it's coming from. I find myself enjoying this and I am not a stout or coffee kind of guy. Impressive.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy . Dry and slightly bitter aftertaste makes me want to take another sip to moisten my mouth once again. The alcohol is hidden very well. I should have no problem finishing this one as I usually can't get through an entire bottle of stout.

Alcohol is warming but never more than a sidenote with all the big flavors present, totally leaving any indication of the booze in the dust.  Mouth: Thick, sticky and creamy.

Wonderful whipped coffee mousse head that recedes to a brown film that resembles the crema (sp?), that lighter brown foam skim, on the top of a perfectly made espresso.  S: Huge nose of roasted coffee, toasted malt, and fresh-baked oatmeal raisin cookies.  T: Big and bold flavors flying all over the place! Roasted coffee, toasted malt, brown sugar, espresso, molassas, oatmeal, bitter chocolate, hops, and burnt stuff.  M: Thick and chewy. This stuff actually pours like Vitamin D chocolate milk so it's silky and creamy like liquid velvet. It completely coats the tongue allowing the finish to linger and develop.  D: Drinkability is off the scale. It's like drinking the best oatmeal stout and the finest espresso while eating a plate of homemade bitter chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin cookies. Alcohol?

1199,11757,orfeu,4.77,"Many thanks for the opportunity to try this beer must go out to hoppymeal and czoch75. Served slightly chilled in a 17-ounce snifter, this coveted beer is a thick obsidian color with a modest but dense and creamy looking light brown head, which settles to a very thin surface pattern and persistent ring. Lovely mocha aromas waft upward from the glass, with the bitter dark-roasted coffee scents swirling deftly with an extremely decadent bitter chocolate syrup bouquet. This melds into an overall aroma that conjures images of wet wood chips that have been soaked in mocha-coffee-infused rum. In a word, outstanding nose. Slightly bitter coffee flavor with some cocoa and walnut-skin character. A bit boozy as well. Some woody aspects emerge in the flavor as well, which is unexpected as I know that this is not a barrel-aged beer. Not as chocolatey in the flavor as expected, either; rather, there is a suitably complex grain taste that dominates the latter half of each sip. Overall, this seems to be primarily designed as a showcase for a skillful use of coffee in a stout. A very silky mouthfeel on this one, but surprisingly light in body, at least for the style, anyway. Not really a problem as this lends an incredible easiness to the drinkability. While not quite the elixir that is Kentucky Breakfast Stout, this is without a doubt an amazing accomplishment in brewing. I'd wish for a bit more chocolate in the flavor, since the label gives priority to chocolate before coffee and oatmeal. Regardless, one of the finest stouts to ever cross my lips and one I will certainly continue to enjoy and seek out.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,quasimoto,3.06,"A - Deep black, opaque. Faint ruby highlights are gleaming through. There is a nice big 2inch head on this thing and as I let it sit, it laces nicely.  S - Straight off the bat , it's old coffee grounds. Its not iced coffee, or a frappachino, but old coffee grains. There is a light mixture of some chocolate, in the middle but then turns to deep roasted grains.  T - The aromas transfer over to the taste and make it almost a balanced beer, but not quite. The deep coffee grain is turning to mud, and in turn taking the grains with it. The chocolate is no where to be found in true form but only a perceived notion of its previous existence is left behind. Out of all the reviews I have read, I cant believe no one has picked up the high rubbing alcohol flavor in the back of this beer. Either this needs to age, or this thing is a mess.  M - One of the good things about this beer is the mouth feel. It starts off smooth with the carbonation/bitterness, and then smooths out to a nice creamy mouth feel. The alcohol warms the as it sits, and then warms the throat.  D - I hope this thing needs to age. I really do. Maybe then it will be a true 93/Outstanding beer. But for a rather fresh beer.

1199,11757,shbobdb,3.76,"Now, I've had this beer before. Granted, it was a long, long time ago, well before I became a BA, so I was less familiar with what a beer can be.  But, it is worth noting that at the time I was really very used to German beers (especially Koelsches) so it is worth remembering that anything beyond weizens, Koelsches, and the occasional ueber-hoppy pilsners that almost-have-too-much-going-on-to-be drank like Grolsch and Warsteiner. Tja, it was a silly time.  But I remember really liking this beer. Really liking this beer a lot. For someone who thought that salvator was too alcoholic and tasted like malt liquor, that is saying a lot!  Because of that memory, this brew is a bit of a letdown. It is the 2005 (so most of us got it in early 2006, it is Dec. 29th, errr, just turned 30th 2005 . . . for those that follow year-to-year changes) and I've got to say that it definately has a strong smell and taste of old coffee. The kind that has been left at the office for far too long.  Too bad, because the chewy oats and bitter, bitter chocolate (the 29 IBUs come from the hops but make no mistake, this drinks like an 80 IBU beer because of the bitter chocolate. Lots of good roasted flavours, mixing with creamy, chewy, oaty goodness, and some solid chocolate tastes. The old coffee is just too much though. Upon further drinking, it isn't so much 'old coffee' so much as it is simply a cold, but very robust coffee. Perhaps a dark, acidic ethopian blend? It kinda reminds me of the really acidic coffee from Brueggers. I might warm up the next bottle to see how that goes.  Still a great brew, don't mean to nitpick here.

Taste: Semi-sweet chocolate maltiness soon yields to the more dominant coffee flavor which is much akin to a cold day-old cup of morning coffee. Some faint citrusy hops join the finish as it warms. Unfortunately, I find that the coffee character tramples unforgivingly over the other lesser flavors of chocolate, oatmeal, charred caramel and smoky cigars.

I paid $4.29 total for one 12 oz. bottle! That's much more than I am used to paying for a single 12 oz. bottle of American beer. I'm not sure it was worth it. Poured into a snifter. This beer is a very dark brown, opaque color. The tan colored head on mine was about 1/4 of an inch thick upon pouring. After 5 minutes or so it settled to a nice film layer sitting on the surface of my beer with a nice tan ring lining the inside of my snifter. Nice lacing too! Strong aromas of roasted cofffee beans with a hint of malt and dark chocolate. Tastes like black coffee with some sugar in it. Hints of chocolate and oatmeal are also present here. The chocolate notes come out more as the beer warms up. This beer really starts to warm you after a few sips, especially as the beer warms up a bit. These flavors are rounded out by a subtle trace of hops. Has a crisp, smooth, and medium bodied mouthfeel. Very drinkable, especially as it warms up. I've never had a stout quite like this one before. A winner for sure, but the price is a bit of a turnoff. Because of this, it is not something I'd buy all the time.

Despite the heavy coffee, this beer is incredibly balanced. The coffee flavors play nicely with the dark chocolate flavors, making individual flavors hard to pin down. Was that coffee? Or was it the chocolate? Surprisingly not overly alcoholic, mostly just smooth. Some hops, but basically acting in a supporting role.  M: Thick, viscous, full.  D: I see what makes this beer popular. I've had a few coffee stouts (even brewed one), but what sets this one apart are the hints of dark chocolate hanging out at the fringes. They really round out the flavor nicely. On the other hand, you really have to be in the mood for coffee when you drink this beer (unlike some coffee stouts, this beer is more than just a hint of coffee!). I drank it late in the afternoon, and found the coffee taste to be a bit too much by the end. I'll have to try it in the morning sometime soon (perhaps Chistmas?).  This is a solid beer, well-balanced and interesting. All that being said, I'm not sure it makes my top 10 or top 20 list. Happy to have tried it (happier still to have three other bottles to try), and I'll look for it next year, but I think once a year is enough for me.

1199,11757,scott,3.98,"Damn, if I didn't wait all year for this monster. V.06 Ink in a 12oz. snifter. Thin, chocolate head. Kona! Stout! This could have some other definition, but it decided not to. Big, robust coffee zing with a tart, bittered finish. Chewy, and very pleasant creaminess. Tremendous offering from an awesome brewery. Nicely done!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,eberkman,4.14,"Poured a thick, oozy jet black into a snifter. Great coloring. But no head formed whatsoever -- perhaps I served it too cold? Or was it a bad bottle that had been sitting around too long? Anyway, that was a disappointment. But the aroma was pleasing -- just like fresh-ground dark-roasted coffee. That was exactly the taste too -- like a glass of black iced coffee but with an alcoholic warming to it. In terms of mouthfeel, it was full-bodied and thick, but lacked carbonation. Again -- maybe a bad bottle? But it was still tasty -- mainly because I love coffee in general.  I'd like to try it again, because while objectively tasty, the full experience was sort of a letdown, beginning with the lack of a head. I'm disappointed because as a native Michigander, I was hoping to give top marks to a product from such a reputable Michigan brewer. It wasn't displeasing by any means -- it was enjoyable -- but not what I anticipated. Basically a glass of cold coffee that gives you an alcoholic buzz instead of a caffeine buzz. Not a bad thing at all, but not necessarily worth the hype.  All that said, I would happily drink this with brunch on a lazy Sunday or holiday in place of a Bloody Mary or Mimosa. And I'd more than happily have this with dessert or late in the evening when I want coffee but don't want to stay awake afterward.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Damian,4.29,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Liquor World, Somerville, MA  Poured a super deep, pitch black - thick like motor oil and completely translucent. A small tuft of caramel colored fizz coated the beer before quickly fading to a thick ring of lace.  The aroma of this beer was absolutely amazing. The first thing that jumped out at me was the ever so pleasant coffee aroma. Unlike most stouts that have a roasted, espresso-like coffee smell, this was more akin to freshly ground coffee beans (similar to the smell of a gourmet coffee shop). Notes of dark chocolate were also apparent, along with some vanilla and bourbon-like characteristics. Also, there was a hint of noticeable sweetness from the malts.  The taste was deep and rich like the nose, yet somewhat more bitter and biting. A mix of sharpness (possibly the alcohol) and sweet malts up front before the rich espresso, dark chocolate and heavily roasted malts appeared. Some oakiness was also noticeable. The dark malts appeared even stronger on the back of the palate. A touch of hops was also perceivable. Surprisingly, the roasted bitterness tapered off greatly in the aftertaste, where a bit of residual caramel-like sweetness appeared. Alcohol was nearly undetectable initially but became a bit more apparent as the beer warmed.  Mouthfeel was ridiculously thick, viscous, syrupy and quite creamy.  Drinkability was quite good for such a heavy and alcohol-rich beer. The pleasant aromas, flavors and mouthfeel made for a terrific sipping experience.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,DaveFL1976,4.06,"I changed the oil in my car this past weekend, and the oil coming out of the crankcase was no less black or viscous than this beer. This is about as black as beer gets. No light makes its way through the glass, not even the edges. The head is frothy and dark tan. Sticks to the sides, but settles down into a thin skim in only a few minutes. The smell is huge. There's a lot of beer in this beer. Roasted barley, dry cocoa, a bit of sourness which I thought was strange. The taste and mouthfeel are where this beer shines. The taste isn't as kick-you-in-the-teeth, scratch your tastebuds dry and roasty as I expected. It's smooth, and a bit sweet. Coffee beans are quite pronounced in the taste, as is some bakers' chocolate. The mouthfeel is the creamiest thing I've ever tasted. It's velvety smooth. Drinkability is quite good considering the density of flavors and the high ABV. There's just something a bit funky about the smell.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,alexgash,4.82,"Oily, coffee black body slinks beneath a dense, sticky, dark cocoa brown head. Meaty, roasty, rich, smoky coffee beans dominate the nose. Very fresh and incredibly good. Coffee sits over chocolate maltiness and dark fruits. Toasted, bitter coffee beans up front. Becomes roastier and smokier and more intense. Chocolate and dark fruits swell, providing some sweetness. The coffee flavor and roasted bitterness pretty much overshadow this though. The bitterness controls the finish, which is redolent of a mocha latte with a shot of peaty whiskey. Body is medium-full with an oily feel. Very good and perhaps the best coffee beer I've ever had (haven't had KY B.S. yet though).",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,mrasskicktastic,2.44,"A - Dark brown brew with a finger and a half of dark tan head. Small specks of lacing are everywhere on glass, but they are scatter and practically refuse to clump.  S - Extremely potent coffee. It smells exactly like intense dark roasted coffee beans. It smells like a coffee from a French press. I honestly don't like that smell much (I don't really drink coffee) - and definitely not when it is this pronounced.  T - The other flavors are completely overshadowed by the dark roasted coffee beans - an espresso-esque flavor. A touch of chocolate and burnt malt. The aftertaste is partially a slightly bitter coffee aftertaste, but mostly the unpleasant chemical aftertaste that I abhor in coffee. There is a bit of bitter burnt malt and even less dark chocolate in the aftertaste as well.  M - Medium viscosity, a tad subpar in smoothness. Not refreshing on the tounge, but it is on the throat.  D - Wow. I can't remember the last time I have been this disappointed by a top rated beer. I can understand why coffee achievers might be enthralled by the beer, but that it not me. A subtle coffee presence is appreciated, but drinking a cold carbonated mocha isn't what I want when I want a stout. The drinkability is pretty bad because the coffee chemical bitterness is relentless - it just never disappears. The mouthfeel isn't helpful - my tounge feels like a raisin.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,IntriqKen,4.35,Pours pitch black with a massive head...dangerously massive. I had to do a very careful three part pour to save this one. Tan head disappears to tan sticky lacing. Aromas are espresso and dark unsweetened chocolate. Taste is same as smell....mostly espresso coffee with a hint of bittersweet chocolate that melts to powdery baker's chocolate...slight citrus hops on the end. A little alcohol comes through both in the flavor at the end and on the feel. Aftertaste is pure sweet espresso with a bit of bakers chocolate. Nothing cloying...just sweet espresso. I seem to lose the chocolate as it leaves my mouth...but I also lose the alcohol except as a warmth going down so that is a good thing.

Pours black, dark brown almost reddish head, creamy looking. Smells and tastes of coffee, caramel, chocolate, and a hint of vanilla.

S: Roasted malts (plenty of chocolate with some molases & nut), coffee, bready/biscuity  T: Pleasant roastyness (not burnt or overly bitter). Slight hint of roasted acidity, but very smooth (thanks to the oatmeal). Bready, chocolate, coffee, molases, mild fruity ale esters, slight warmth from the alcohol (incredibly well hidden).  M: Full body is nicely attenuated, but not overly dry. Light to moderate carbonation.  D: Very good. Especially considering its strength.

1199,11757,FLAbeergutinMASS,3.93,"This is one beer I have been early awaiting to try. My first impression was WOW! This is what a stout should look like. Deep, thick, big body, with a slight tannic head and great lacing. Very intense. Literally smelled like you walked into a coffee shop that serves chocolate and baked goods. Again, very intense. Unfortunately, that is where the superlatives end, and the mortality of the beer shows up. I've had this cellared for over a year, so I was expecting so pretty deep, complex tastes, which there were, but all the characteristics that I hoped would accompany the nose where overrun by a stale aftertaste, almost like semi-sweet powdered chocolate.  An extreme beer to say the least. I felt like I had just left a buffet of highly powered chocolate and bread. Too much, almost unfinishable because it was so filling.

There are slight ruby highlights that reflect nicely off the creamy brown head.  S - Bittersweet chocolate, oats, coffee, slight lactic milkiness.  T - Black/roasty, almost burnt, coffee and bittersweet chocolate. I do not drink coffee so this one was a little overpowering but I do see how someone that likes coffee would love this one. This one would be exceptional if the coffee was toned down just a bit.  M - Medium to full and very creamy with a nice full mouthfeel.  D - I had this one right after breakfast and it was fabulous.

A firm drop in the last bit trying to raise a head showed a brief flash of deep tan froth that slipped quickly back into the ooze from whence it came. My mug looks like a black hole. Bright light showed about a millimeter of clear black that a few carbonation bubbles could be seen, but not else. Stuff looks freakin' great!  Flavor: Burnt coffee bitter is quickly soothed by slightly sweet roasted malt base and dark chocolate. The flavor is simple but delicious. The back end has a wet hop light bitter to give the beer a wonderfully round profile.  Mouthfeel: Medium heavy body, slick oatmeal texture, minimal carbonation. It quickly soaks into your chops to leave a dry, but lasting flavor.  Overall Impression: Wow. Deep, rich, simple, tasty: all the flavors both stand out and compliment each other in wonderful ways.

Pour was like thin mud, gorgeous looking. At first I almost thought there wouldn't be much head but I was proven wrong by a less than half inch cap of brown suds. Milky chocolate dominates the nose, along with a bit of roastiness and some chocolate syrup. I also smell a faint trace of hops.  This is one you'll want to let warm up a little longer than normal in my opinion. It's nice when it's cool but it kicks ass once it really warms. Taste is again, dark chcolate with a slightly sweet milkiness, a bare hint of tart sourness that I get in some stouts, espresso and an immense roastiness that I've never experienced in a stout before. I really like the finish ... you can definitely taste the oatmeal.  Mouth is on the medium side with carbonation that does the job quietly.

And you'll be allowing more people to sample your delicious beers on a regular basis. I WILL buy this beer ALL THE TIME."" Sorry...focus....focus...  OK so I love Founders brews, but this is the jewel. Pours opaquely black, thin wisps of carbonated lace cling to the edges of the glass.

Undeniably smooth as it goes down, the flaked oats and cereal grain flavors making their presence known in both flavor and feel.

Held up to the light, it has just a thin cola aura around the edges.  The smell is mostly smoke and coffee. There's just a scant fruitiness, and just a hint of hops.  Chocolately right up front, followed by weak coffee and smoke. There's an empty woodiness on the end. It's good, but after all the hype, I expected a bit more out of this one. I still wouldn't turn one down. (Oh, and WAY after the end, there's still a bit of soy sauce flavour left in my mouth- but not that low-grade swill Kikkoman. I'm thinking GOOD soy sauce, that's not 95% salt.)  Mouthfeel is very nice. Good and thick, and the carbonation hits low and fast. Nice and wet on the end.  Despite some of the spots that weren't as fabulous as expected, this is an easy drinker. I'd have seconds and thirds!  Be well -UF",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,nflmvp,4.03,"Pours black, with a hazy, coffee-colored one and a half inch, dense foam head. The head only lasted a couple of minutes before fading to a trace on the glass and very light skim on my beer. Very appealing.  Smell is coffee with hints of chocolate, smoke and fruit. Taste is very nice....chocolate, oatmeal, coffee, wood? Mouthfeel is fairly thick but pleasing. It leaves a nice coating on the tongue, even after the finish.  Drinkability is nice. I'll have to continue with this one and perhaps a second, just to make sure I haven't made any mistakes. ;-)",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,carln26,4.42,"Deep black in color with mild mahogany highlights. Its topped by a thin tan head that showed good retention. A lot of bitter chocolate in the nose, and you can pick up the coffee, more of a cappuccino in the finish. Just a little bit of black cherry there too. The flavor has a big coffee flavor all through the drink. Wow much more coffee than I expected from the aroma. Light chocolate, dark berries. The bitterness seems to come more from the coffee than then the hops. Hops, are there hops in this beer? Just a touch a bit of a citrus pinch on the finish. Full, thick, rich mouth feel. Good drinkability. It hides the alcohol well.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,hoppymeal,4.32,"Beer pours dark black with a reddish tan head that quickly dies away. Mmm, the smell is like walking into a nice coffee house; rich dark roasted coffee beans. The beer has a medium to heavy body with a nice low level of carbonation that just tingles on the tongue. Tastes of more roastiness, a little dark chocolate with a slight cola sweetness and a sour/acidic (not unpleasant) finish. Very enjoyable.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,mcallister,4.28,"Beer pours an extremely dark creamy brownish/black with a thickly carbonated head of tan nearly a half inch. Enticing aromas of coffee, choclate, roasted oats, vanilla, espresso, choclate malt,and heavan.  Beer has been decanting for nearly 25 minutes with still the same half inch head as the initial pour. Very bold freshly roasted coffee flavors. Intense choclate espresso. Roasted oats, with an slight hint of pure vanilla extract hiding on the finish. Even a little bit of dark fruits in there prune maybe. Oh and that choclate roasted malt. Very satisfying and true to the name.  A good minute long finish with bold hard tannins. This is the first I've tried this beer and have had the Kentucky Breakfast twice. This one has more boldness and masculinity, although the Kentucky has much of the same the bourbon barrels have cut some of the in your face black coffee flavors back a little, made them a little tamer, and made that beer slightly more drinkable than this.  Still a terrific satisfying stout.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,wingman14,4.95,"This beer is amazing. It pours jet black with a small dark tan head. It smells like freshly roasted coffee. A few other sweet tones but the coffee smell dominates. The taste is unreal. Mostly coffee flavor, but has so many small flavors that dance around you mouth as you sip. This beer goes so fast because it is so tasty. The mouthfeel is a exceptional, good carbonation with an excellent balance. I could drink these at any time of day and at any occasion. A bit more in price but so worth it. It took me awhile to buy this beer but I will always have one ready for any special occasion. This stout is now the new standard for all stouts that I will drink. Absolutely increadible, my highest recommendations for this beer. Enjoy!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ILiveOffHops,4.52,"Jet black, thin foam ring. Overwhelming coffee dominates the smell. Also dark roasted malty aromas. Taste is loads of coffee. Very appealing coffee flavor even though it may be a bit overdone. Also tastes of bitter burnt malt, hints of chocolate. Very smooth but also cloying mouthfeel-not bad for a huge stout though. Loved this at the Extreme Beer Fest, and it's just as great out of the bottle. Sessionable..I think not. But very delicious. Definitely a unique and tasty beer. Cheers to Founder's! Especially on New Beer Sunday. :-o",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,HoboAGoGo,4.87,"Poured from the bottle with a great picture into a snifter. Pitch black body with a very dark brown head. Even while pouring it, I can smell the coffee with a sweet hint of chocolate. Going down even closer I can smell strong coffee, it smells like cold coffee, but not coffee that has gone bad, more iced coffee. Chocolate hides in there as well, with a big grainy, beer smell. It tastes outstanding. Coffee is what first hits your mouth, but then chocolate comes in to share it. You don't get a dominant flavor, more like they begin to meld together until the coffee, chocolate and creamy flavor of the stout come together. The only complaint I have is that cold coffee sometimes can taste sour, and this has the sour coffee taste. All in all, I love this beer. I split one bottle amongst a few friends just so they could try it, and all agreed it was one of the best.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,OldFrothingSlosh,4.65,"12 oz. bottle courtesy of frozensoul327. Huge thanks for this one!  Finally able to snare this bottle from the DBF and give it a proper review. On the pour, the first thing I notice is how ""thick"" the beer is...almost as if it is reluctant to leave the bottle. Opaque darkness sits beneath the graham cracker color head. Thick, sticky head that not only stays at a finger-thick level, but also manages to leaves soapy splotches of lace on my glass.  Aromas are heavenly. A fresh pot of coffee wafts from this beer, mixed with some char and a nutty note as well...almonds? Slight vinous note as well. Chunks of bitter baking chocolate thrown in for good measure.  Flavor is wonderful. Chocolate-infused fresh coffe up front. Middle sees some bitterness creep in, mixed with flaked oatmeal. More of a ""no-bake chocolate cookie"" flavor, if you've ever had them. Finish really dries out quickly, leaving a powdery dryness on the palate. Very, very ""clean"" in the finish. There's definitely an aftertaste, but it's very crisp and pronounced. Wonderful.  So smooth on the palate. Each component of the beer makes itself known, yet doesn't overshadow any of the others in this blend of delicious flavors. The 8.3% ABV is only slightly noticed, well-woven into the fabric of this amazing creation. One bottle is not enough. This is one to seek out again. Thouroughly enjoyed and much-appreciated.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,bennetj17,4.82,"Thanks to BigDaddyWil for sending me this top 10 brew, Michigan must be a great place to live...  Viscous black pour, very dark, thin reddish-tan foam crust on top. Intense aroma of roasted coffee, chocolate, oatmeal, and campfire smoke. Very inviting. The flavor is beautifully strong! The fresh ground coffee/espresso taste dominates, but melds well with sweet chocolate notes and faint smokiness. The mocha flavor continues well into the finish and carries a fair amount of bitterness. Alcohol may be strong, but hard to notice behind all the powerfull flavors. The mouthfeel carries a solid thickness but is arousingly smooth due to the oats, and the carbonation is perfection. This is an ultimate coffee-like brew, and I don't even care for coffee that much, which says alot, because I could drink this all night...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,babyhobbes,4.69,"Got my bottle as a trade with Quasimodo! Thanks!!  Poured vigorously and still produced virtually no head only some slight caramel colored lacing on the edges. Color is deep dark brown, like an espresso.  Smells all coffee-y and chocolate malts. I want to dive right in!  This is very drinkable and the alcohol is just a small bite at the back of the throat. Very delicious. The taste is full of slighty burnt coffee....it's perfect, chocolately malts, slight oatmeal (but none in the nose). This beer is just fantastic.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Truh,4.27,"Enjoyed some of the instant stuff with this one on 3/21/2006, although the first bottle was gifted to me by my good friend Warriorsoul many months ago. 12-oz bottle poured in a Dogfish shaker.  After a vigorous pour, 1/8-inch film of head sticks plentifully to the sides, but dissipates quickly. Very little lace as the pour drains. Black, tar pit hue that is impossible to discern, to the point where your reflection grins back at you. Chocolate, molasses, and not unsurprisingly, oatmeal with a heaping helping of brown sugar jam around on the nose. Really a throttling of chummy smoke, black licorice, burnt sugar, caramel left too long in the sun, and other chocolate tones invade the mouth and stick. The alcohol is hidden behind the previously noted aspects, but pleasantly so.  Nice, wholly, holy nice. Had the Kentucky bourbon version at the 2006 EBF and it was best of show for me. This does not disappoint.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Phyl21ca,2.54,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a nice dark foamy head with average retention. Coffee aroma is quite overpowering with some subtle roasted malt. Taste is totally overpowered by coffee and as much as I like some coffee characteristic in my stout I cannot drink coffee. Total lack of balance or complexity, just an overpowering of coffee. Definitely not one for me.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,wedge,4.85,"Thick ebony with a solid creamy brown head on top leaving some patchy lacing. Rich aromas of fresh sweet coffee beans and delicious chocolate...oh baby. First sip is huge...smooth roasted mocha java flavors over some distant hop flowers. Fudge and oats...sweet and lightly dry. Full bodied, chewy, and velvety smooth with a soft bitterness on the back of the tongue. For such a big, rich stout, the drinkability is out of control.  Heavenly stuff. So velvety smooth and flavorful its a good thing I can't get my hands on this more often...its a bit pricey. Definately a treat. Double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout pretty much explains it...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,tastybeer,4.72,"Pours like in slow motion. Explodes out of my glass leaving a small warm black puddle on the table. (Not a rough pour either). Black (maybe a tiny bit of light makes it browner, but hardly) with a brown dense oily looking head about 1.5 inch. Thin lace here and there. Aroma of thick gritty roasted espresso coffee, dark chocolate, some kind of hidden fruit under the blanket, possibly cranberry. A great way to start your day. Taste. There's a lot of it. Roasted carmelized fruits surrounded by chocolate covered roasted coffee beans. The fruit lightens up the full grainy roastiness very nicely. Like a sunrise breaking through night. I might be associating this with breakfast too much though. I imagine its great anytime of day. The sweetness counters the bitter roasty character. Thick slick body. So smooth you notice the full body less, but not in a bad way. The loads of flavor don't take away from dinkability but instead make you drink it faster.  Clearly the breakfast of champions.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,waughbrew,4.09,"[generously provided by ghostwalker in a trade in 3/2006]  Black mud. Head is not very big, nor creamy, but has a nice light brown color. Smell is thick, strong coffee/chocolate fudge with a leafy presence. Flavor has a great burnt edge and alcohol presence to give it zip and some depth (which is good, because the yeast seems to add no other depth to this). Thin silky body goes down very easily and pleasingly at first, but the coffee-twang in the finish grew tiring for me, hindering the drinkability. Throughout, a vanilla nougat flavor shines. I don't know...it is a cool beer, but after half the bottle is gone some of the flavors grate on me a little. Nice, but strikes me as a bit of a novelty without too much enjoyable drinking potential. (Am I wrong? Let me know if you really drink this regularly) It gave me a headache. I should have expected it considering the strange amount of alcohol presence for an 8% brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Crosling,3.98,"Cheers to Ernest for sharing a bottle. Black as night with a small head of light tan foam. Deep aroma that shows deep coffee beans, chocolate, roasted malts and even more coffee. Deep coffee flavor. Extremely rich and just the perfect amount of hop flavor; barley any at all. Big coffee, chocolate, roasted malt flavor. Extremely thick. Very tasty.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Dithyramb,4.03,"Bottle purchased from the Wine Source in Columbus a week ago.  Poured inky black with a viscosity that was surprising. It was completely opaque with a dark brown head with excellent lacing.  Bitter malts, scotch, old coffee grinds, and choco on the aroma. Very ""heavy"" on the nose, but inviting, nonetheless.  Starbucks coffee, without the cream and sugar.  Medium to heavy mouthfeel, with bitter remnants. Definite turkish coffee flavors. I really think that I would enjoy this one as a breakfast brew to get the day started. Seemed a bit one-sided, though. Didn't have the sugary malty backbone to really call it complex. Left the mouth feeling warm and tingly.  Overall: Very nice, just didn't appear to be a show-stopper.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,GreenWBush,4.75,"This beer is black. As in absolutely opaque. A stricter interpretation: ""Being of the color black, producing or reflecting comparatively little light and having no predominant hue. Having little or no light"". In this case, its finally true in regards to a brew. This one also posesses a unique, almost yellow tanned skim and a 'cranked to 11' lace. Entering the bottle artwork into the consideration, this is a great presentation to say the least.  The nose is filled with hints of chocolate truffels, foaming mocha, bubbling oatmeal, almost minty-green herbal hop leaf impressions, molten coffee grounds swirled into caramel. Marshmellows. Intense, but not so much to be distracting - enticing is more like it.  Taste mimics smell but with a more focused coffee bombast: a rush of Arabica goodness swirls over the lips and onto the tongue in bitter bursts. Trailing right behind is an acidic roastiness that is matched and quelled by a silky, milky, oats impression. Hop burps drizzled in espresso.  I relay with a certain amount of chagrin that the mouthfeel is akin to Starbucks' frappucino. Vanilla and chocolate synergize on your tongue, echoed by the hops and roast and you want more.  Amazingly well-rounded and approachable while still being huge and complex: quite the feat! Even my dad really liked this!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,PatandDavid,4.12,"Thanks to fellow BA Stonecrusher for this one. Pour was ultrablack, and I was rewarded by a luscious coffee-crema style head. Coffee was present in the aroma, and my notes indicate some hazelnuts as well. Mouthfeel was thick but pleasant. Tastewise, I enjoyed the chocolate and coffee notes (does anything go better together?). I did notice some acridity in the finish, much like one can with coffee. Good Stuff.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,DeaconBluez,4.87,"thanks to northertimber for this sampling  pours pitch black night color. very thick looking. nice brown head that stays for while. nice lacing as well. it smell like you just walked into your local coffee shop. huge coffee aromas, with dark chocolates kicking in the background. very lovely. that taste is amzing. so complex. the coffee is the main man in this brawl. the bitter chocolate is not far behind though. and you can definitely taste hints of oatmeal. you can even taste notes of hops. and for some reason, as it warms, i can taste hints of cinnamon. i let mine warm up to almost room temp, and it brought so much out this brew.  this is highly drinkable, and a true joy to down. this is wake n bake's cousin on crack. what a beer",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,scruffwhor,4.16,"Appearance- There is something that seems to appeal to me when I see a beer like this. So dark, no highlights at all. JUST BLACK. The only thing that isn't black is the deep brown head the pour yields. Not only the color, but the viscocity. Thats right viscous. When I hear viscocity, I think motor oil. And this beer could be easily compared to motor oil. I like that this beer looks like something, that most people would not touch, yet alone drink.  Smell- Dark, dark bakers chocolate mixed with spent coffee grinds from your home coffee maker. Another anamoly in tasting in that I don't like the smell of cleaning out my coffee maker, but in this case I enjoy it.  Taste- Coffee, dark roasted coffee. This beer is flavored the same way I like my coffee. You know what More like a shot of espresso, at room temp of course. Also hints of some very dark European chocolate. A light hint of cream to give it a little sweetness. Only faint bitterness that I would associate with hops.  Mouthfeel- Very very heavy bodied and oily feel to this beer. Coffee dominates the overall palate with a bitterness I know and love from coffee, not hops. It just flows over my tongue like motor oil.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,soulfly967,4.75,"Poured nearly jet black with a thick caramel brown head that left tons of lace behind.  Smell was of fresh roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, some more coffee, and some roasted malts.  Taste was heavy on the coffee, just the way I like it! Had hints of bittersweet chocolate, burnt malts, and a slight bitterness in the middle and a lingering coffee and chocolate aftertaste. No sign of the alcohol in this.  Mouthfeel was thick, creamy, velvety smooth and utterly amazing!  This baby goes down with the best of 'em. Very drinkable. A simply stunning brew!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Pours black as midnight and thick as molasses. Excellent. Oozes down the side and forms only a little mocha head that doesn't last long.  Smells like spent coffee grounds. Awesome. Also some chocolate in there for good measure. Tastes just as great, though more complexity is more evident. Tastes like black coffee with hella roasted chocolate and sweet malt with a light touch of hops.  The body is amazing. I've never tried such a chewey beer. I absolutely love it. Very, very drinkable for a heavy stout with such bold flavor.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

I picked up coffee, chocolate, distinct malt and a few others I can't quite pinpoint...very complex. The taste is very much like a slightlty tamed espresso with bits of chocolate. I don't know whether to drink or chew this brew. Is it a beer or a chocolate pudding laced with coffee...outstanding. Although this brew has a higher abv, it coats the palate so nicely it's hard to notice, so you may have to be careful when having more than one. An absolutely great brew!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,PeatReek,4.19,"[The EBF reviews roll on!]  Super roasty aroma with a deep brown head. The roast also comes through in the flavor, with virtually no hop taste or aroma. Very malt-oriented. Fortunately, the malt profile is sublime... chocholate and coffee overtones, balanced with a prominent but pleasant CO2 bite. Reminds me very much of Kalamazoo Stout; is it something in the water over there?! Bell's Kalamazoo is one of my favorite stouts; now along with Founders Breakfast, it is one of my 2 favorites.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Sycodrummer,4.97,"I have been longing to try this beer since I first read reviews of it upon my joining BA. Was dissappointed to find out it was not distributed to Mass. but elated when I found out Bauer had a limited stock of it. I was fortunate enough to aquire a four pack and am very glad I did.  Poured from the stubby black bottle into a pint glass the beer was a pitch black color with a half-finger of light brown head that is quick to fade and left little lacing. No other outright signs of carbonation.  The smell is of dark roasted malt, burnt black coffee, dark chocolate, oatmeal, chicory, alcohol, and whiskey.  The taste is very robust and roasted with malt flavors screaming through the palate. A bitter blast of dark chocolate and chicory flavored coffee follows. Some soft dark fruits like figs and plums. Bitterness stays through the entire sip but the beer is suprisingly smooth but heavy to the finish. Very sturdy and malty and the alcohol is readily apparent.  Super thick and heavy on the palate with a thick, creamy, robust mouthfeel. Low levels of carbonation.  Wow! This was worth the wait and lived up to the hype for me. Thick and creamy this beer was not meant to accompany breakfast, but rather to BE breakfast. So hearty and rich that it fills you up and the alcohol warms you all over. An excellent stout when sipped and savored properly. Very drinkable if consumed accordingly, but not a beer to session by any stretch of the imagination.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Thin mahogany head, but nice lacings all the way down the glass. One nitpick  no bottle date.  Intense coffee and chocolate aromas, just as the label states  along with that 8.3abv  Powerful coffee taste (duh, breakfast stout), and just hints of chocolates. In fact, you can taste coffee several minutes after each quaff. Thick and creamy brew, this one does make quite an impression on you.

The bittertness is not overpowering just enough to make you know its there. Not a very dry stout either. It didn't leavneeding a drink to wet my whistle, which is a nice feel from a stout.

1199,11757,mentor,4.13,"Stopped in to see my buddy trbeer while on holiday and got this beer in trade. Thanks so much! Pours syrupy thick. Hard pour to get a three-finger dark brown head over a pitch liquid (even when held to light). Smells richly of dry coffee beans. Fresh ground, like when rounding the corner into that aisle of the local Whole Foods store (I don't drink coffee, so I can't describe the smell as any fresher than that). Beneath the coffee is a wet sweet. Way beneath. Tastes of coffee upon the draw and then a potent fresh groudn coffee bean flavor. Potent. Dry. Grutty mouthfeel, like there's tiny ground-up coffee bits stuck to my tongue. THe coffee has a bitter, but is isn't coffee bitter. It;s more like the kind of bitter you get from a dry chocolate candy. Beneath this is a wet malt sweet that may have some chocolate character. It's tough to tell, as the coffe is such a strong characteristic of this beer, The finish is simple and dry.  This beer is not as complex as I recall. It's more focused on the coffee than coffee intermingled with other flavors. Still enjoyable, but not the stunner that I was expecting. Thick thick body and modestly carbonated.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,BEERchitect,4.45,"This is an amazing silky smooth stout with strong overtones of espresso. Brewed with impecable balance and elegant strength, Founders Breakfast Stout is an ale for the ages!  The beer's appearance of motor oil carries a creamy visual weight, complete opaqueness, and a lush volumptuous quality. A delicate creme of foam muddles about in a thin sheet that skirts the glass and shows more legging than lace which further reinforce the viscous overall demeanor  Espresso, heavy cream, cocoa, heavy toast and roast all help to define the nose. Background notes of scorched molasses, walnuts, and charred woods all play into the roasty aromas.  Espresso also dominated the flavor. Stout characteristics of deep caramel, toffee, vanilla, and rudementary malt all play on the mouth with a succulent and savory taste that doesn't introduce endless complexity, but rather puts the coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and cream flavors in bold display.  Viscous, nearly chewy textures have a mouth-coating, creamy, thick mouthfeel that proved unwaivering until very late in finish. Bitterness from hops, roasted grains, and coffee give a strong rebuttal from the malts and accompany a moderate astringent seemingly of spent coffee grounds.  Any fan of strong brewed coffees are sure to fall head over heels in love with this beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Franchise,4.65,"This offering from Founder's is all that I expected and more. It pours onyx black leaving a creamy tan head that is sticky, and clings to the glass. The nose is fantastic roasted coffee beans, creamy vanilla under tones, and a warm inviting presence of alcohal. The taste on the palate is very nice, creamy, milky, it starts bitter, roasted espresso is very present. You can taste a toffee sweetness, also some bittersweet chocolate is infused in this brew, it then finishes syrup thick that coats the tongue.

1199,11757,twelvsies,3.62,"I hate to be the guy who disses a top rated brew, but I guess today I am that guy. Maybe I'm just sick of beers like this, but I feel like once you've had one double-imperial-chocolate-coffee-espresso-mocha-java-extravaganza stout you've had 'em all. The coffee and chocolate flavors are too much for beer, or too at least too much for this beer. I love a nice stout that has a more subtle coffee or chocolaty flavor that's imparted by the kind of malt they used, but this straight up infused flavor is too syrupy for me in general. Don't get me wrong, it is delicious, it's just not something I like in my beer I've decided. Appears a dark pitch brown color, a wimpy head that dissapears quickly. Smells extremely roasty and sweet, but with a ton of nice bitterness in the form of coffee and bitter chocolate. Maybe even from the hops but I can't really detect any. Taste could be full of complex flavors, and the potential is there, but the palate is really overrun with the intense coffee bean chocolate party that's going on in this beer. I've already talked about that part... The real saving grace of this beer is the mouthfeel. Soft and pillowy, it's so smooth and just velvety on the palate with a slight chewyness. If I had no tastebuds even I would drink this just for the texture. To finish up, it could just be me or a stylistic sort of preference thing, but the strong coffee flavors don't work for this beer I hate to say.

1199,11757,kmo1030,4.64,"this beer pours blacker'n hell with a consistency like motor oil, with rich dark brown head that lasts for a while. the smell is almost quite literally like smelling a cooled cup of expresso, bitter and hugely coffee-like, there is chocolate underneath that, with a smell almost like fresh split firewood, but not the traditional ""wood"" aroma. really incredible. the taste is more of the same. the expresso character is huge and imposing with chocolate taking a back seat at first and then getting sweeter and more predominant at the back of the mouth accompanying the bitter coffee flavors. i can't tell if any bitterness is from the hops and not just all dark roasted coffee. there is a little tang at the end. sort of mocha-ish too. full, rich and smooth as hell in the mouth, with delicate carbonation. the body perfectly matches the flavors and character of the beer. relatively dry too... bonus. awesome drinkability for such a big beer. breakfast lunch or dinner, this beer is going to impress. it's funny, in thinking about the breakfast theme, this seems like one of the few beers that i could drink ""the morning after.""",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,DaPeculierDane,4.75,"Just a wonderful beer in every way. Its chocolate and coffee flavors are virtually unsurpassed. Thick as a milkshake and black as obsidian, this one looks the part as well as it tastes it. Perfectly balanced oatmeal and brown sugar sweetness with chocolate bitterness, creamy smoothness with oaky acidity, a velvety chewy front with a dry sherry finish. This is one top notch beer and well worth the hefty price it commands.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,danielocean03,4.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours an opaque black like day old coffee with a miniscule brown head that fell away quickly to a light glass coating lacing. Aroma is just like a rich, inviting cup of dark roasted coffee, only smells a hint sweeter but still bitter, and has some undertones of malt present as well. Taste starts creamy and sweet, then lets the the bitter coffee/dark chocolate flavors take the helm. Leaves an appreciative bitter aftertaste like a good coffee or beer would, in this case, this seems to be both mixed into one. Mouthfeel is heavier bodied, moderate to light carbonation, feels creamy and silky smooth on the tongue, goes down nice and easy. Very drinkable beer, hardly hints towards it's unbelievably well hidden 8.3%.

1199,11757,jamie2dope,4.75,"Finally I get to try this! Here it goes...poured into a Magic Hat tulip glass ever so slowly. Appearance is thick black and velvety, with absolutely no light getting through and a dark tan head that doesn't last long. Smell is of burnt day old coffee and dark unsweetened chocolate. Taste is even more impressive, with huge coffee flavors and shots of espresso...you can literally taste the coffee beans. There are also traces of vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel is thick and robust, but still easy to drink. Finished up with a mocha character and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Well after all of the anticipation, I wouldn't say I was blown away, but still very very satisfied. If it were up to me, this would replace my daily cup of coffee. Thanks to Battlekow for the sample.

1199,11757,Jredner,4.34,Huge aroma of strong espresso and expensive dark bakers chocalate. DAMN this smells good. Deep black with a mocha colored pinky thick head. An enormous blast of coffee and choclate syrup are followed by a creamy smooth transition into a strong and firm hop bitterness. This is phenemonal.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The aroma is tons of bitter roasted (almost burnt) coffee with a touch of sweet creaminess.  The flavor is slightly sweet cream, some oak and a bitter (slightly acidic) coffee that pervades it throughout. It has a very crisp finish. The sweetness and the coffee are well balanced. The alcohol is well hidden but it sneaks up on you. The mouthfeel is medium to full and creamy.  Wow, this is nicely done!

The best Stout I've had yet.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Zorro,4.38,Pours an impenetrable black colored beer with a reddish brown head.  Smell is sharp strong black coffee. Lots of deep roasted aromas and a touch of smoke. Light fruit scents ride on the alcohol fumes mostly the aroma of cherry. Fairly strong acid scent in the tail end.  Taste is very thick with mellow chocolate and coffee flavor with a wine like tart snap in the finish. Later on a faint sweetness appears in the taste. Fruity flavors in the finish but it is difficult to identify them separately. This is very much a coffee flavored stout.  Mouthfeel is thick and velvety smooth.  Very nice drinkability with little hint to the high alcohol content. A great stout I will try again.,Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,unclederby,3.68,"Poured straight down the middle of my Smithwicks imperial pint glass. Very little head which promptly disappeared. Pitch, opaque black... no lacing.  Smells of dark roasted coffee and vanilla. That's right, vanilla! I give it a few swirls and a faint whiff of cocoa makes it's presence known. A little sweet smelling... hazelnuts? wheat toast? I just can't quite put my finger on it. Vegetative - that's it - smells vegetative too...  Taste like burnt, dark roasted coffee, smoked almonds, licorice and green hops. Drier really than i anticipated it would be, with a bitter middle and finish. Chocolate is subordinate to the coffee. Like it's the coffee that has notes of chocolate...  Medium bodied mouthfeel, with some chewiness. A notch below creamy but oily for sure. Coats the mouth and throat.  It's easy enough to drink if your a fan of dark roasted, black coffee. I almost forgot i was drinking a beer.  Underwhelmed. I would choose many a stout over this one, especially for the price tag... maybe it's just too bitter for my taste in stouts. That being said, pairing this with a rich dessert i think would serve to greatly highten it's drinkability...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Brian700,4.5,"This beer poured a dark black with a real dark brown head on it that stuck around for quite a while.  The aroma was of burnt malt, chocolate, and coffee.  The flavor was amazing the burnt malt hits you first, then major chocolate, and in the finish the coffee is most present leaving a little bit of bitterness. Very complex.  The mouthfeel is medium carbonation with full body.  This is a very drinkable beer that I have been searching for for a long time. My friend had one for me one night and man was I excited to try it. I highly recommend this one if you can find it.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,dciskey,4.47,"Pours dark, dense black, with a tiny brown head. Only average retention. Not much lacing; I expected a bit more head and lacing; 8.3% is above average but not so much to keep it down this much.  Smell is baker's chocolate and espresso. Taste starts out coffee, followed by chocolate and a touch of oats, though not as much as an oatmeal stout. On some sips a slight twinge of hops is noticable. Finish sweetens somewhat (a little bit of lactose?) and continues the coffee/chocolate.  I love the mouthfeel on this beer. Just enough carbonation to keep the viscosity from being overpowering. Still it's a thick beer that coats the tounge with flavor.  This beer is almost dangerously drinkable. The alcohol isn't noticable either in taste or in warmth in the mouthfeel, and there are no vinous qualities like other double stouts. I would love to have this for or with breakfast but I'm not sure about drinking it on an empty stomach! A stout-lover without some discretion could get into a lot of trouble with this beer. But it would be some of the most delicious trouble a person could have.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Aromas of citric and floral hops, coffee and roasted malta nose full! Tastes of espresso, chocolate, sweet malt and a substantial citric hop backbone. Full-bodied and low carbonation. Creamy and smooth in the mouth with a nip of hop bitterness at the end. Slightly drying finish.  An incredibly rich and complex nose, doesnt mislead about the equally amazing flavors that follow. The coffee notes are well-balanced by the sweetness and mild bitterness. Drool worthy.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ghostwalker,4.31,"Impenetrable black body with a solid finger of thick brown head. This stuff is easily as dark as Stone RIS.  Nose is fresh ground coffee beans.  Flavor is more fresh ground coffee, bitter chocolate, creaminess from the oatmeal. It's definitely different than any stout I have had to date. really great stuff!  Mouthfeel is thick and oily. A creamy, thick, chewy treat.  Drinkability is probably really good for a fairly big stout. I won't be finding out today, though. I had to drive to Michigan to get this stuff and it's $9.99 a 4 pack, so the remaining three will be rationed carefully.  Overall, a great specialty stout. If you can find it, it's worth the price.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,MuddyFeet,4.26,"I can only imagine what this beer is like fresh. Because as it is this brew is rocking my world. Dark as a blackhole. I held a candle up to the pint glass and cannot even get the slightest shimmer through the beer. Thick black, creamy head on top. The glass was coated in lace that slowly oozed into a stringiness. Nose is loaded with dark chocolates, burnt malts and coffee.  Flavor is not so much complex as an intense wallop of coffee and dark chocolate. The coffee flavor is similar to when the pot is left a bit too long on the burner and the beer sours and bitters. Not too bad, but enough to notice. Also, if it is possible, I swear that in addition to the dark chocolate there is also a bit of white chocolate dribbled in the flavor. Not much in the way of any hops. Maybe a bit towards the end but I think I have that confused with the bitterness from the coffee and chocolate. Heavy and thick body that just clings to the cheeks like a nice dark roast. Quite relaxing and soothing too. Extremely smooth drinking, but just make sure you don't mind the taste of coffee in your beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

It says it's a Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout at 8.3% ABV. I poured this beer into a snifter.  Appearance: The best way I can decribe the color of this beer is motor oil and like motor oil, no light coming through it what so ever. When I poured it, I got no head of foam, but did leave some tan colored rings around the glass though.  Smell: When I first popped the cap I got an aroma of hops but when I poured it, it had a strong aroma of dark roasted coffee up front and with some dark chocolate and roasted malt in the background.  Taste: When I first tasted this, I was surprised that this was even beer. It tasted exactly like dark roasted coffee with dark chocolate and roasted malt. Bascially it tasted like it smelled. If your a coffee addict, you'll love the taste of this beer. I didn't notice any oatmeal in the taste like it said in the description, but I don't care. Very Good!  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, rich, thick, and with a slight bitter coffee aftertaste.  Drinkability: Overall an excellent coffee beer, but is something good once in a while and is not an everyday kind of beer due to the strong taste and the price.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,GClarkage,4.74,"01/04/06- Purchased via mail order with Archer Liquors in Chicago, ILL.  Presentation- 12oz bottle with no freshness info. Has been aged for at least 6 months. Poured into my Elk Mountain pint glass.  Appearance- Blacker that soot pour. Closest to motor oil I have ever seen from a beer. Thick and viscous. Smaller 1/2 inch head and leaves light lacing.  Smell- Huge and I mean huge amounts of roasted coffee bean smell with a deep dark malt background. A touch of bitterswwet chocolate underneath all that. Reminds me of the smell of a ski lodge coffee shop.  Taste- I'm not one for coffee as a normal thing, but I do love it in beer and in ice cream. This beer is loaded to the brim with coffee flavor. Once you get past the coffee fix, the heavy fire roasted malt comes in and even deeper a dash of dark chocolate. After your taste buds are assulted by by all that the nice bitter hop blast comes in to finish you off.  Mouthfeel- Only, if only this beer was a bit more smooth. Carbonation level was a bit steep for a beer this thick and viscous. My only complaint about this beer.  Drinkability- This is one incredible tasting beer.

Smelled intensely of coffee, so I was nervous. I didn't like the Speedway stout at all, and it had a coffee component to it. But this was different... or 1 year between tastings is no way to compare. Anyway this tasted so good I couldn't stop sipping it. Kind of malty coffee.

Excellent coffee flavor marbled with dark chocolate and rolled oats. Full of black coffee bitterness.  The full mouthfeel is rounded out a polished light creaminess.  This is a hospitable brew that is very much like drinking coffee with just a touch of heavy cream.  Very straightforward and oh so delicious.  Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout.

1199,11757,Higravity,3.9,"Poured black with a tan head that told me this was getting most of its color form something other than roasted barely. Indeed from the frist sniff it is nothing but concetrated coffee and some lingering sweet smell of malt. The taste and the mouthfeel here interact to create a drinking pleasure. THe slight bitterness of the coffee and the smoothness of the proteins oats or otherwise add a nice combo. Overall the flavor is not horribly complex mostly coffee with some sweetness and a bit of nutty oats rolled in chocolate in the aftertaste. The drinkability is hurt a little by the fact that the flavors are so strong as I don't think I would want more than one at a time, but a nice beer and worth finding.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Huge coffee aroma, strong like espresso, with toasted oats in there as well; hugely roasty like really good restaurant coffee. Hints of nut and maybe prune, just like breakfast!  Great oaky taste, big mealy taste like oatmeal. Coffee right up front, bitter like cappuccino. Definite heavy fruit, like prunes. Cocoa-powder bitterness eases you into the finish.  Full bodied mouthfeel, but not oily at all. Very drinkable, though not session beer according to the new (and right-on) BA definition of a sesison beer.

The aroma is something to behold..very rich chocolates blend with the potent coffee-ish smell..yikes. Tastes are similar, with an oatmeal complexity that comes out and a bitterness that struck me a bit off-guard.

Poured out a thick almost syrupy stream of black and burnt copper. I was laughing a bit as I poured, not knowing what I was getting into. I slowly filled my glass trying to get a head. I managed to get a 1 finger but it quickly disapated. the espresso aroma is a little overwellming but I could still smell malt, burnt carmel, and molasses. Mouthfeel is smooth and thick with mild carbonation. The taste is definitely coffee and bakers dark chocolate. Has a small bit of Alchol burn right after it goes down.

1199,11757,UnionMade,4.65,"Thanks to Mike for this bottle! Used motor oil black, capped with a dense, dun froth. Cobwebs of lace. Giant coffee aroma, hugely roasty, very similar to smelling the empty can of Folger's I kept my MUSCLE figures in as a kid. A bit woody, hints of prune and nut. Toffee and chocolate. The flavor opens softer, gentler than expected, but much more complex. Layers upon layers of flavor. Silky smooth on the tongue. Velvety, lower levels of carbonation. Big coffee and roasted barley right up front, soft, flaky oatmeal mellowing things throughout. Wood, walnuts and cashew. Caramel sweetness adds to the softer touch of this brew. Real coffeehouse mocha cappuchino, chocolate syrup, with a dryer, cocoa powder bittersweetness easing into the finish. So soft. A slight dash of prune or raisin, some sort of dried, wrinkly fruit. Vague hop presence in the finish, overshadowed by the all encompassing malt. Just a short prickle of pine needle bitterness, as well as very slight phenolic clove. No hint of alcohol. Finishes dryish, with a long lasting aftertaste like a cup of coffee and a bowl of oatmeal at breakfast. Just wonderful. Big, bold, but surprisingly elegant and well put-together. For so much going on, the flavors integrate masterfully. Really very reminiscent of breakfast and sleeping late on Sunday mornings. If you love good coffee, this is the beer for you.

Smell: Rich toasted coffee, malty and carmel notes  Taste: Rich without being overbearing. Wonderful aftertaste. Toasted flavor throughout. Hard to believe the 8.3% alcohol because the other ingredients offset it.  Mouthfeel: Thick as a brick. One of the thickest I've ever had, which for this style is perfect. Many microbreweries have a dark-as-the- night colored stout that is thin as water, but not this one.  Drinkability: Surprisingly good for how rich the beer is.

I find that the chocolate comes in the nose than anything and lacks in the flavor. You smell some roasted coffee but mostly chocolate. One downfall to this beer is that I can actually smell green olives in there also.  Taste: Fantastic! Freshly brewed coffee with chocolate highlights. The oatmeal adds a slickness.

Much anticipated, since this beer is brewed in my home state, and has been given such high marks. I was so excited to try this beer after reading about on BA.  Appearance: Dark black in color, with a thin cream colored head. No light could pass through when held up to a light. It had a slight oily texture to it.  Smell: Strong smell of chocolate, coffee and a hint of oatmeal. It almost reminded me of cookie dough, a great dessert beer.  Taste: Wow!!! My taste buds were alive with flavor. Mostly chocolate and coffee, definetely a mouthful. Yummy!!!  Mouthfeel: I guess the best way to descibe it, is a meal in a bottle. Kinda heavy, but very tasty. I could'nt get enough.  Drinkability: I could only drink one or two in a sitting. Even though this stout taste great, one of these beers fills me up. I would highly recommend this beer, especially on a cold winters night.

Smell: Rish dark chocolate and definite oatmeal, smooth coffee. A distinctly rich aroma, tru to the description on the bottle (the part about double chocolate oatmeal).  Taste: That is one fine stout. Rich and sweet, full and smooth. Tons of chocolate and coffee. Oatmeal mellows the flavor slightly. Hops are present at the very end, but the dessert-like nature of this beer can't be denied.  Mouthfeel: Perfectly full feeling on the way down.

The taste matches the nose perfectly which is a damn good thing. Cold it was fantastic and as it warmed it was just as good. The aftertaste is so good that it mimics the effect of eating a piece of chocolate with a top notch stout. Skip the chocolate and just drink this.

1199,11757,connecticutpoet,5,"This beer was obtained in trade from Frozensoul327. Thanks Eric! And thanks in advance for sending a spare!  This one poured out a very dark brown/black, with a one and a half finger head that started out a dark chocolate brown and faded to a medium tan. I know it was clear when I poured it, because I could tell from what I was pouring... but I don't think a ruby laser could cut through this puppy now.  Aroma was bitter chocolate, some sweet dark fruits, roasted barley, and hints of coffee... very powerful and layered. Damn, this one was incredible.  Taste was of strong roasted malts, coffee, and some bitter chocolate. I could tell there was some oatmeal in there as well.  Mouthfeel was perfect... deep, rich, chewy, smooth, silky, all rolled into one. It held onto the tongue just long enough to impart all the nuances of flavor.  Drinkability... well, it is taking all that I have not to run downstairs and grab the other one I have in my special locked cabinet.  This was truly an interesting experience. For a long time I did not like the darker, roasted beers, but I have really gotten a taste for them now. I still prefer IPA's, but these are so different, I am really learning that you can love more than one style equally.  This is a bittersweet review, as well.

Since Founders says that it can be aged up to a year, Ive decided to review this beer after 8 months.  I poured Breakfast into a Chimay Chalice. I got an inky body with a big khaki head. Scents of French roasted coffee dominated the nose. Like in the smell, the beer tasted mostly like French roast combined with dark chocolate, tangy alcohol, and hints of licorice. As the beer warmed, spicy alcohol emerged as well as flavors of milky oatmeal. Towards the end of the beer, coffee flavors reemerged along with hints of earthy grains while the spicy alcohol dissipated.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Hints of dark chocolate try to sneak through. Taste: I'm not a big coffee fan, but I do enjoy the blend of coffee, oatmeal, and bittersweet chocolate flavors to be found here. Coffee dominates my palate, but the other flavors are lurking in every sip. Certainly a complex brew. Mouthfeel: The beer slides down the throat very easily, and feels just right - just thick enough, but not excessive. Drinkability: Goes down very easily, but I wonder - is there caffeine in this?? We'll see if I get a headache! Edit: I was informed that there is indeed caffeine in this - ounce for ounce the same as coffee.

1199,11757,Brewfan,4.68,"Thanks to Warriorsoul for this bottle. You rock Tom! Poured into my DFH Raison D'Etre longstemmed-oversized goblet. No head to the beer upon pouring. Whisps of tan lace surround the outer reaches of the beer, and stayed there for the entire beer. Color of dark burnt chocolate with some ruby highlights. You couldn't see through this beer with x-ray specs. First smell was earthy dark chocolate infused espresso. Thin aroma of hoppy-alcohol soaked kalamata olives in the background. Tasted of roasted bakers chocolate, heavy malt, toasted barley and cocoa powder dusted oatmeal. The coffee taste and smell is like the first espresso of the morning. The tastes change from sip to sip, really defining the complexity of this offering. The meadium body on this, along with the smells and tastes makes this one of the most drinkable stout I've ever had. I really don't want this beer to end, but I seem to be drinking more than reviewing. My sips have turned to gulps and I don't have the control to stop myself. So drinkable a stout this is. I'm down to my last sip or two and have to force myself to draw it out. Finishes like a well-done caramel mochiato with oatmeal thrown in for good measure. Beautiful beer Founders.

1199,11757,ClearDog,4.43,"Had a pint on draft at the Landmark 1850 Inn in Milwaukee.  Appearance -- Pure black with a thick, creamy, khaki two finger head. Head lasted for quite a while. Very nice to look at.  Smell -- Very inviting chocolate and coffee. The smell is very reminiscent of breakfast. It gets intense as the stout warms.  Taste -- The taste changed for me with each sip. Taste went back and forth between bitter chocolate and a strong coffee flavor. Complex to say the least. Warming alcohol is also apparent but by no means overwhelming.  Mouthfeel -- Thick and creamy. Very dense. I'm reminded of oatmeal or some kind of warm cereal.  Drinkability -- I could do one or two at a time. The flavor is quite rich. The higher ABV is also masked well so if you were to have a few I'm sure it would catch up fast.  One I'll seek out again, but not at a bar.

Rich dark chocolate aromas swirl with medium roast coffee. What am I doing still smelling this?  A rich blend of coffee, dark & bittersweet chocolate, along with some dark fruits. Some astringent flavours work their way in from the roast. Citrus & leafy hop flavours bring it home, becoming more pronounced as it warms, without ever being overbearing. Thick & velvety smooth, easy carbonation. Fabu!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,lostbearbrew,4.63,"While I really enjoyed this brew, the numbers somehow belie my personal thoughts. Maybe it isn't quite the perfect beer I thought it was, but it s SO very good, all the same.  Darker than a thunderstorm night in the backwoods camping. Amazing blend of coffee - you can smell more than one type of coffee I think, and then bittersweet chocolate in the nose of this one.  Flavors of both coffee and roasted malts mix together with chocolate for an amazing, intriguing touch. The coffee comes through two, maybe three times, distinctly, in a sip, almost as if you are swirling coffee and roasty, oatmeal stout in your mouth together.  I have to say the mouthfeel is amazing - slides right down the throat with VERY little resistance - mental or physical. I could happily drink a few of these gems in an evening.  One of my favorite stouts, and certainly one of the best flavor blends ever.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Good 'ol cmaruschak supplied me with one earlier which I shared and did not review...can't forget the great traders out there. Pours a dense black w/ a half finger of dark cocoa head that sticks around for most of the duration...thick lacing forms on the side of the snifter glass. The smell is robust coffee up front, some more coffee and dark italian chocolate. A gentle sweetness finishes in the nose w/ even a bit of green hops. Taste is one strong cup of mocha java...not overly sweet and a subtle bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is very well hidden, but a magnificent warming overcomes the body as I work my way through this offering. Mouthfeel is quite thick and the carbonation is contained and fantastic. I could enjoy a number of these on a cold evening such as this...simply great.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

This is a very fun beer, i will definitely be buying this again.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Frozensoul327,4.9,"A world class beer. By far one of the best brews I have ever had, and easily the best oatmeal stout. Poured out to a pitch black color that had the consistancy of motor oil. Very thick pour and a high viscosity. A thin layer of mocha colored foam covered the top of the beer, but overall this brew had a rather low carbonation level. Aromas of heavenly malt, coffee, chocolate, earth, smoke, wood and toffee made my mouth water in anticipation of this liquid treat. Taste was phenominal; truely amazing flavors of coffee, oats, chocolate, toffee, malt and earth blend perfectly. Mouthfeel was great; very thick and chewy, like a liquid granola bar. Near exceptional drinkabiliy, I think I could have this nearly everyday and never get tired of it. This is one of the best beers I have ever had. I can't wait to get more. World Class, and highly recommended.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,blackie,4.38,"appearance: The pour into the snifter creates a dark brown head that is not very thick, but dissipates very slowly, leaving a generous ring of bubbles around the side of the glass. The nice looking head is easily recreated with a few simple swirls of the glass. For all intents and purposes, this beer is black, save for a little dark brown coming through on the edges. Some lacing is left behind on the walls of the glass.  smell: The first smells I notice are espresso and dark and bittersweet chocolates. Smells very similar to the espresso-chocolate chip cookies I buy at the local grocery. The espresso smell is impressive and pervasive; I want to say that it is cloying, but for some reason cannot. Some smoky aromas are evident, as expected with the amount of roasted malt used in this beer. The level of sweetness is just right. I can pick out the hop aromas with some careful smelling, and they are present in the perfect amounts. Practically no ethanol whatsoever is noticeable, at least until my hand around the snifter warms the beer above room temperature.  mouthfeel: Carbonation is a low medium, and the body a high medium in thickness.  taste: On the nose, the coffee bean aroma I detected was espresso. On the tongue, though I still get some espresso, regular dark roast coffee is what I really notice. The chocolate is there, but it is hard to pin down, probably dark chocolate, but also some milk. Sweet and bitter, chocolatey and coffee...coffeey? Slight astringency. The finish is composed of lingering dark roasted coffee flavors and a mild hop bitterness, both of which persist for quite awhile. I would like to score the taste a little higher, but the coffee is a little overplayed for my taste.  drinkability: Tasty enough and easy drinking enough to have a few, but not more than, say, four. Though I cannot really smell nor taste the alcohol, I can definately feel it.  I took the beer out of the cellar-fridge about thirty minutes before opening, and drank most of it at room temperature. Thanks dirtylou for the four pack, delivered to my abode. The beers sat in my cellar-fridge for about three months before I had the nerve to crack the first beer of the four pack.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,blitz134,4.25,"Received in a BIF from feloniousmonk...thanks again...  I think the room got darker when I poured this beer out. So...body is the color of burnt motor oil. Head was about 1/2"" thick on the pour: dark chocolate milk in color. Slowly reduced to a think bubble layer.  Aroma is semi sweet chocolate with strong overtones of alcohol. A nice concotion of dark coffee with some toffee, fudge flavors swirled in. Alcohol is a bit stronger than expected but offers some additional complexity with the dark fruit aromas which I usually associated with higher abv stouts.  A near-perfect blend of all of the components which went into it. Individual flavors associated with chocolate can be picked up initially. Then a dark coffee comes through. The oatmeal is present in the ""dryer"" taste which works to meld the chocolate and coffee together. Also has a bit of a lactic/milk characteristic which gives it an overall sweetness. The only complaint I have is the alcohol strength which I find a bit astringent and reduces how smooth this beer can be.  Mouthfeel is oily, creamy, and silky on the tongue. Unlike any other beer I have had. This is the definition of full bodied.  Drinkability is brought down due to the alcohol. I generally don't mind strong brews and an alcohol presence, but I feel it is a little overdone in this case and almost astringent at some points.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Really just coffee. Smell there.  A bit disappointing in flavor. Rich, dark coffee, chocolate and toasty, gritty roastiness. Somewhat abrasive.  Surprisingly thin, chalky almost. Very low carbonation, nearly flat.  A bit of a disappointment. I expected a big stout, and this, I'd say is a younger brother to the big stouts. Still a very nice brew and you should try some.

Theres a lingering sweetness like youd find in a chunk of semi sweet chocolate. Nice grainy flavor in there as well. The harmonious mix of this beer is incredible.

This beer is just outstanding, and certainly deserving of its repuation. I'd like to have a bottle each of this and Bell's Java Stout at the same time to compare.

Midway it fades a bit to a chocolatey raspberry cherry infused sensation then ending with an eternal roastiness, some spicy yeast and earthy hoppyness. Lingers on forever. This is absolutely wonderful. Mouthfeel is very full with slight carbonation that really only plays a part at the start. I'm having severe trouble not draining this in 5 minutes.

There must have been a massive coffee addition to this brew. The taste follows the smell. Heavy doses of a double expresso with a bakers chocolate finish. The mouthfeel is remarkably smooth for a high abv and the coffee taste is not cloying. Unbelievable beer overall. Not really an everyday beer and not for someone who does not like coffee.

Taste: Sandy coffee and chocolate flavors with vanilla, soy sauce, and Hershey's syrup all coming in boldly but not too strongly. There's a nice hop ending to this beer that ingers along with a long, sweet, brown sugar finish. The aftertaste is bready and sweet. The flavor is great because it does not overdo it on anything. There not too much of anything but all the flavors are tasty and well represented.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy with a slight graininess that awakens my palate. So very well done on the feel.  Drinkability: This beer is great because no flavor or smell is overdone. A lot of stouts taste like cold coffee. This beer is complex and tasty without killing the consumer with one intense flavor.

To be honest, I think this one gets caught in between being an over-the-top coffee stout (like Bells Java Stout) and a stout where the addition of coffee serves to accentuate the existing stout characteristics (like Dark Lord). This seems to be a nicely crafted stout, but every time the subtle nuances (chocolate, caramel, vanilla) try to push their way forward, your palate is hit with burnt coffee flavors. Finish lasts forever. Could benefit from less coffee or more sweetness to balance it out a bit. However, being a fan of coffee, I cant help but like this beer.

The coffee hits early and sweet chocolate dominates late. This bottle came from the fridge, where it came out too cold. An increase in serving temperature (even to the 60s) definitely improved the complexity and taste.  Mouthfeel: Sharp as an oatmeal stout and gets smoother as the brew warms.

Lacing is fine and plasters the side of the glass as the opaque tide recedes. Initial rush of cappucino as I stole a whiff from the bottle. Once poured, the aromas where much more subdued--coffee with sweet chocolate. The taste is fairly sweet with a good blend of the milk chocolate and coffee.

1199,11757,CortexBomb,4.3,"Breakfast Stout pours out of the growler normal stouty black, and accompanies it with a nice off tan head and the alcohol noticeably clings to the glass upon shifting, just like I like my stouts. The smell is distinctly roasty with a strong coffee effect.  The taste is very coffee-ish up front, but not so much coffee as to absolutely overwhelm the palatte and make it unenjoyable. Baker's Chocolate and a creamy sensation are also very much present, and the vaguest hint of hops help put it over the top in the taste category...really well done. The flavour ends with an almost coffee groundish effect and leaves that wonderful stouty roasted flavour on the tongue to remember it by.  The mouthfeel is strong, but not quite tops for a stout, it clings, but isn't quite elite in viscuity. Drinkability for a stout is very good though, it's quite easy to put one of these down and I tend to buy it when I see it, though usually only on tap, which is fortunately fairly common in beer bars here in MI.

(my only gripe with this beer.)  S: Big whiff of dark coffee. Smells sort of like those bitter little gems of coffee I'd get when I was in Bahrain. Mild sweet chocolatey smells underneath the coffee. Barest hint of an alcohol smell. Very nice.  T: Bliss. From the smell I was expecting a big hit of burny coffee ground flavor. What I got was wonderfully different. Soft chocolate tastes that meld beautifully with a soft but bold coffee taste that reminds me of good coffee brewed in a French Press. Sweet malty flavor comes late. Finish is a touch of hops to give a bit of a bitter punch that just makes me want to sip again to get back to that wonderful flavor. Wow is this ever tasty!  M: Full bodied. Smooth as velvet feeling. Breakfast Stout indeed! This beer just feels like a meal in a glass. Moderate carbonation. Alcohol is warming in the belly, other than that I'd never guess that this one weighs in at 8.3%.  D&N: Highly deserving of being one of the Best of BA. Every sip offers a different view of this beer, the flavors and aromas meld and dance and change seemingly with every sip. Unbelievable complexity. This is a beer that everyone should try, and keep a few on hand if you are lucky enough. I can't thank you enough, battlekow, for sending this one my way.  Edit to add: One of the few beers that I looked into my empty oversized wine glass and just sighed...

1199,11757,Golden2wenty1,4.82,"Picked up a single at Riley's in Madison.  Pours a dark reddish brown, almost black with a nice caramel head with good lacing. Smells immaculate -- chocolate and coffee forever with a little alcohol.. Wow, very rich. Taste is more and more rich dark chocolate, roasted coffee and creamy, milky oatmeal with a slight hop note at the end. More like a dessert than a breakfast. Incredibly intense, intricate, and complex both on the nose and the palate. A real work of art. WOW. Amazing stuff here. Alcohol comes out a little more as it warms and in turn warms your belly. Mouthfeel is heavy and well-carbonated for a stout. Probably couldn't drink more than two of these, based on the heaviness and the 8.3% abv, but I don't want to stop. Just an outstanding beer here. Highly recommended to any stout lover. Easily lived up to the hype.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

Decided to treat myself to one of my bottles of Breakfast Stout aquired from a trade with Battlekow (my sincere apologies for forgeting that, how embarassing).  12 oz bottle. ""Founders Breakfast Stout. Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout"". Damn, this sounds better than a birthday cake.  Pours deep black with a thin tan head. Smells like expresso. Oh man this tastes really good. Rich chocolate up front, coffee with an oatmeal ending. So damn smooth! This would be great for a dessert after a nice meal.  It's been my birthday for all of 6 minutes but I've already guaranteed it will be a good day by drinking this beer.  Edit: The more I look at the bottle the more freaked out I get.

Smell: Those extra-strong turkish coffees that come in those miniscule cups, ground cocoa aroma.  Taste: Chocolate bitterness and roasted malt and somewhat subdued alcohol makes this a very round, rich elixir that I could have sampled again and again.

1199,11757,mynie,4.77,"(Special thanks to CRJMellor for a great trade)  This is the thickest-looking stout I’ve ever poured. Completely opaque blackness with a toasted chocolate head. You ever get some chocolate from a candy bar on your fingers and then accidentally smear some chocolate on a piece of paper? That’s how the head looks.  Smells like COFFEE! Chocolate, too. And mocha. I’m drinking this very close to room temperature and the sheer complexity of its odor is astounding. It’s like several types of stout all rolled in to one and with no conflicting scents. Absolutely wonderful.  Flavor starts out with coffee electricity, a dark roasted malt middle with strong nodes of a dark, bitter chocolate, ending with a more milk chocolate sweetness, an oatmeal stout finish, very dry with a slightly sour hint.  This beer is like candy. Like one of those iced mochas they sell at Starbucks only better. As strange as it may sound, this incredibly flavorful and highly-alcoholic stout would actually make a great cross over beer. It’s that tasty, and that inoffensive.  Great stuff. Perfection. Please please please start distributing to Iowa or Illinois so I can drink it more often.  I don't like giving out fives. Something sticks in the back of my throat, sputtering, making me really question myself ""Is this beer good enough? Is it really perfect? Why don't you just take the mouthfeel down a notch?"" I've put in a lot of thought, and giving this beer anything other than a perfect score would be a lie. Buy some. Right now.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,MarkBlackout,4.13,"My first 12oz. of this beer ( a couple days ago) left me somewhat disappointed. 'Am I missing something?"" I wondered. I very nearly dreaded drinking the other three. This afternoon, after a few other, less in-your-face beers, I decided to approach this one again. The mouthfeel is the stand-out feature of this beer. Incredibly thick and satisfying to drink. Upon my first tasting, I found the coffee elements to be too assertive, and the bitterness factor a bit high. It tastes like a different brew now (though from the same six-pack). Had I rated it, I wouldn't have done it justice. I would highly reccomend building up to this one in a session rather than beginning with. Despite the name, this beer would be much too much for me in the morning - though I do percieve (and appreciate) the coffee element.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,tavernjef,4.83,"Black lacquer body, I sense brown upon it but only see black. A chocolate milk brown top about an inch high sits on top with a lovely creamy rich denseness. Crown slowly percolates down to a whispy bubbled skim and the lacing is quite sticky and layered in sporatic thick webby curtains.  Oh my this is lovely! Wow, what a great aromatic display on this of bold, rich mocha java, sweet oats, chocolate, fudge, and loads of robust roastyness. Incredible little dollps of tangy prune and burnt molasses keep an almost sour undertone to it. Unfortunately it tends to mellow out and becomes less potent as it sits but still is a wonderment to let flood into the nasal aura.  The taste is the perfect carbon copy of the smell but set with much more adorned tones and length. Its heavy, rich, blanketing, and bakes long lasting flavors of big chocolate shavings covered on top of thick, fluffy Swedish french toast glazed with whipped buttered cream and molasses syrup. Sides with dark oatmeal cookie sweetness and is then followed with hardy coffee bean bitterness and milky dark chocolate bitterness, making this one hell'uva meal of a brew. Need I say more? De-fuckin'-licious!  Well rounded roast and bitterness creates a delicately silken full body. Unlimited amounts of roastified textures and darkly bittered chocolate/coffee delivers itself for eons across the playing field of the palate. Great oaty sweetness and mild sour pruneyness transcends underneath with an aloofingly amazing accuracy creating just enough balance to keep that roasty/bitter/burnt stuff from completely dominating. Satisfingly drinkable by leaps and bounds.

1199,11757,NeroFiddled,4.55,"From a fresh bottle, notched April. Beautiful label art. And.... enjoyed for breakfast!  The Breakfast Stout pours an opaque black body beneath a creamy tan of brownish-tan foam that holds exceptionally well and leaves beautiful walls of thin lace throughout most of the glass.  The nose is bright and exciting with notes of coffee/espresso, nuts, roasted barley, dark chocolate, and (amazingly) oatmeal. It's enough to make me want a cup of mocha java!  In the mouth, it's full bodied and superbly creamy with just a delicate tingle upfront due to its moderate carbonation.  The flavor is even richer and fuller than the nose leads you to believe, with mouthcoating flavors of delicate fruit (strawberries, maraschino cherry); sweetened mocha java; darker-roasted espresso; dark chocolate; fudge brownies; cereal notes (from the oatmeal?); and some grassy and leafy hops - all backed by a solid, underlying bitterness that ushers in its long-lingering, roasty and bitter finish (that's not too unlike a cup of dark black coffee!).  Its complexity lies within its richness, meaning that what you percieve changes from sip to sip as opposed to a beer that presents its characteristics in some kind of order repeatedly throughout the glass.  The alcohol is never noticeable; and it's hard to restrain the acidity in a beer that offers this much dark and roasty malt, but it's perfectly balanced and quite drinkable!  Not unlike the World Wide Stout from Dogfish Head, this pushes the envelope and deserves credit just for that... but it also delivers as well!!! Brilliant!!!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,MDekker,4.43,"Finally, my chance to try the mighty breakfast stout, the beer of many adjectives...the double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout.  I almost thought there was chocolate syrup coming out of the bottle, it was so black and inky. It didn't form much of a head, but what was there was light brown in color. Powerful coffee aroma with a chocolate background. Nice and creamy in the mouth with a light fizz on the tongue.  The roasted coffee flavors stand out initially, with a bitter aftertaste that reminds me of dark chocolate (yum!). I can't quite detect where the oatmeal plays a role, but that may be due to my somewhat novice beer drinking status. After half the glass is gone, I start to appreciate it more (maybe the alcohol is helping, although the high content just blends in well with the flavors and doesn't jump out at me).

1199,11757,RoyalT,4.5,"Appearance  Hahahaha! The pudgy Quaker Oats baby on the label just had me laughing my a** off. Sorry for the irrelevant remark, but that is some funny s**t!  Anyway, the beer pours a dark, murky brown thats almost black in color. The head is heavily-tanned and leaves some nice lacing.  Smell  The nose is very, very bitter and laden with spent coffee grounds along with bakers chocolate and maybe a pinch of brown sugar. Man, is this a good smell. Its not roasted malts but more like pure used coffee.  Taste  This tastes as good as it smells. It is very dry and bitter and, again, like a mouth full of coffee grounds but without the granular texture. There is a bit of milky cream in the taste that I missed at the nose. It truly is a stout for breakfast and, seriously, would taste well over cereal.  It also reminds me of a chocolate martini, if youve ever had one of those. This really is quality all the way. Its not malty at all and is in a class all by itself.  Mouthfeel  This is on the large side of medium-bodied, but still medium-bodied, with a nice creaminess in between the cheeks. I really enjoyed the fact that it didnt finish with a sugar rush like some examples of the breakfast stout style.  Drinkability  This is not one to guzzle or session but more to sip on like I do with my morning coffee. Its one of the better stouts that Ive had.

1199,11757,DrJay,4.79,"Inky black and completely opaque with a light brown, thin lace of head. Good retention and lacing. The aroma consists of coffee, nutty roasted malts, and bitter dark chocolate. A light smell of dark fruits and a hint of alcohol are also present. The flavour starts malty and sweet, big and roasted with plenty of coffee, and just gets better from there. Bitterness comes from both hops and the roasted malts, and carries through right to the finish. Plenty of chocolate as well. There's a hint of hop flavour that shows up towards the end, which finishes with a medium sweetness but still slightly dry from the grain. Viscous, full body with a smooth, creamy texture. Moderately low carbonation that allows all the flavours to stand front and centre. The alcohol is hidden very well.

1199,11757,Buildscharacter,4.08,"Thanks to GeoffFromSJ for trading me for this great brew.  It's my birthday, so I figured, how better to start my day than with the Breakfast Stout. So before noon I cracked open this bottle. As you can see from the image, there's a scary child on the label, but that didn't disuade me. The label says ""Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout"" sounded pretty promising.  I poured it into my pint glass and it gave a solid 1 inch head (vigerous pour) which was mud colored. Quite pretty actually. Smelled richly of coffee and hints of chocolate. Very malty smell.  After the head settled a little bit, I took my first swig. Overwhealming coffee flavors. Hints of oatmeal and barley. Sweet, but not overly sweet. Very well balanced. Mild bitterness, similar to a cup of cold coffee. I can see why they called this a breakfast stout.  Overall I enjoyed this beer, but I don't really feel that it deserves all the praise that it gets. It's a great great beer, don't get my wrong, but other stouts such as Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout and North Coast's Old Rasputin are much better in my opinion.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

The beer pours an impressive pitch black color with brown, not tan fluffy, creamy head foaming up to 2 cm easily. The aroma is rich and malty with chocolate, espresso bean, and some grainy scents mixing with just a faint wisp of earthy hops. Slow swirls allow the beer to leave tight lattice along the edges of the glass. First sip reveals a soft creamy texture with mild gentle carbonation that caresses my tongue and cheeks. The beer is amazingly silky smooth. Flavor starts with a brief hit of chocolate sweetness and some brown sugar as well. This rolls through the finish, but after the swallow I am left with a bitter coffee presence in my mouth that is slightly drying as well. I do detect a faint warming in my chest after each swallow as well, but otherwise I dont get much hint of teh 8.3% abv anywhere.

Mouthfeel is soft, and full of fine carbonation. All kinds of stuff going on in the flavor. There's some bitter coffee and cocoa up front mixed with some creamy yeastyness.

Appearance: Jet black without a hint of color shining through. Small head that probably measured a quarter inch or less.  Smell: This is what a double chocolate, coffee oatmeal stout should smell like. Not that I have ever smelled one previously, but no disappointment. I could easily pick out the coffee and chocolate overtones in the nose.  Taste: Really nice taste when it first hit the pallet. I will be honest that it wasn't exactly what I smelled, but still nice. I was expecting more of a overwhelming hit of roasted coffee, but it was more mild than that. Not necessarily bad though.  Mouthfeel: Smooth is the word that popped into my head.

No light passes through this bad boy, and it is capped by a brown cappacino colored head. Incredibly potent aroma blesses my senses. The nose is dominated by fresh roasted gourmet coffee, and enhanced by bitter chocolate and lots of roasted grain. Taste is oh so wonderful. Smooth dark malts begin the experience, with roasted grain and chocolate malt becoming more apparent. Unsweetened dark chocolate comes in and blends with the black coffee. Very subtle oats and slight charcoal make a quick appearance. The finish is great - big on the roasted grain and coffee, leaving an aftertaste that stays around til the cows come home.

1199,11757,BuckeyeNation,4.63,"Liquid devil's food cake. This may be the first beer I've ever seen that has no highlights. The liquid crowds the edges of the glass so snugly, and with such menace, that light dare not attempt to get a foothold. Most impressive. The dark golden, milk chocolate crown is a beast. It squats with an equally forbidding countenance in the top quarter of the glass, daring any lovers of fizzy yellow beer to approach, much less take a sip.  The nose is huge and is redolent of crushed coffee beans and melted dark chocolate. And then some more coffee beans. And then some more. This has to be the most coffee-dominant nose in the known universe. At least in my known universe. I am not a coffee aficionado by any means, but I have to give the aroma the respect it deserves. If I loved coffee, this might be my Holy Grail of beer noses.  Incredible palate-busting flavor. Thankfully, bittersweet chocolate is equally as prominent as espresso. So much so that the beer tastes like dark chocolate fudge made with black coffee as the liquid ingredient. I knew that Founders wouldn't disappoint in the hop department. The citric hops play an integral role in turning Breakfast Stout from what could have been an (admittedly incredible) two-trick pony into a three-trick thoroughbred. They deepen the flavor profile even further and firmly place this beer into the pantheon of Great Beer.  Sweet and bitter vie for supremacy, with bitter winning in the end. The finish is more than long, it's downright obstinate. Seemingly interminable echoes of chocolate-coffee/coffee-chocolate reverberate long after the beer has met its glorious fate in my warming belly. The body/mouthfeel is big, yet doesn't make it all the way to viscous or chewy. Still though, it's incredibly smooth and creamy and is sheer joy in the mouth. 8.3% ABV? Surely they jest. There is no hint of ethanol to be had.  FBS deserves its reputation and then some. My preferences run to the less java-intensive, but then it wouldn't be a breakfast stout, would it?

Incredible nose of roasted coffee and rich chocolate with a pleasing acrid edge.  Massive, full-bodied, velvety smooth, viscous, thick and chewy feel on the palate - thanks to the oatmeal, in part. Roasted malt astringent twang, with some hoppy character mingled in  some herbal spice and leaf. Bitter chocolate. Plenty of coffee flavors with an acidic bite, silky milk chocolate character soothes. Oak-y. Molasses notes. Stodgy cooked oatmeal in the flavor. Hints of sherry in the warming alcohol, with a low spice. Finish lingers with a play on sweet malts and dry, bitter savories. Sweet alcohol burn becomes part of the linger as the beer warms.  Breakfast Stout? Hell yeah! Thats when I tried my sample! What a way to kick-off my morning. Quite possibly one of the most interesting American Double Stouts on planet Earth. Absolutely delicious.

Brown head collapses and traces all the glass edges.  Poured at cellar temp, this starts with a huge representation of dark, bitter baking type chocolate. Coffee shows up and asserts itself increasingly. I don't know if it's from the rising temp or that coffee is on my brain after tasting it. By the end of the glass, though, this beer tastes more like coffee than coffee itself.  The mouthfeel is spot on for a big, girthy stout. Verey thick, frothy and soft. Oatmeal stout, to be sure. There's gotta be a bowlful in the bottle. I actually got full while drinking this, 3 hours after dinner.  One could say that this is clumsy and oafish. I'm sure somebody will sometime.

Let me start out by saying this is one of the best Michigan beers Ive had the privilege to enjoy, and I am a huge supporter of most MI breweries, albeit more from afar these days. The breakfast stout pours out a deep dark black molasses color, festooned with a thick and creamy dark brown head that looks like it could balance a dime. Aroma is heady and sweet, cocoa and coffee poking out amidst perfectly roasted malt.  Taste is very bold at first, with a surprising punch of hop bitterness at first, this seems to soften as the beer warms a bit. Quickly you are rolled along in a wave of rich, roasty, malty nirvana punctuated with a noticeable but pleasing nibble of alcoholic heat. Body is very full, without being thick. Super creamy and bold, but smooth as volcanic glass. Finish leaves you with the mouthwatering taste of dark chocolate and feeling like you just pounded a show of sweet espresso, and jonesing for more. A couple of these will get you through more than just breakfast..what a beer.

1199,11757,bditty187,4.75,"Stunning because of the absolute blackness of the liquid. I held my glass up to a light and it was a true abyss. It was a black hole. It was Palpatines heart. In other words, no light could penetrate it. Ive seen some dark beers before but this might be the most amazing. The head was brown in color; at the apex the foam was almost two-fingers in height. Head retention was very good; it slowly faded to a thin cap that didnt expose the liquid until a third of the liquid was sipped away. The subsequent lacing was spotty and unorganized. Overall, this beer looks great; the liquid is worth the price of admission alone. This is beer porn.  The nose is a dead-on match for an iced-mocha espresso. The first thing that popped into my mind as I took my first sniff was how much it reminds me of Thunderheads award winning Black Sheep Espresso Stout. I wish I could do a side-by-side sniff test. There would be no losers! I smell amble roasted coffee notes, dark chocolate, a hint of sweetness and a roasted/acidic finish. This beer is stunning. My mouth is watering. Complex. Deep. Oh, so inviting.  My mind smelled iced-espresso so the first sip really staggered me it was warm! The alcohol was upfront but not raw or unpleasant. The second sip was a wonderful mixture of espresso, coffee grinds, semi-sweet dark chocolate with a dash of chocolate sauce, the finish was similar to Achouffe coffee liquor. Yum. There is great flavor depth here; I dont see how this beer could taste any better. It is well balanced yet aggressive with just enough alcohol restraint and the hops are so secondary they are pointless to mention aside from the key fact they are keeping this beer from being too sweet. Bitterness from hops, probably a little bitterness from the roast, probably a little more. This is well-crafted. Tremendous! Flawless. This is the best beer Ive tasted of this sort.  Full body, low but natural carbonation, the mouthfeel was perfect and this sets this beer apart from any coffee stout Ive had, be it from Bells or Thunderhead. This is a sledgehammer. Fantastic. Bring on the NY cheesecake.  To ask if this beer is drinkable is insulting, have you not read my review? This is a damn great beer; Id drink this daily if I could. Id drink this for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or nightcap. This was an unexpected treat, thank you CRJMellor.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,beveragecaptain,4.6,"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a thick dark brown, nearly black, with a large dark brown head. The aroma is expresso chips, toffee, and chocolate. The flavor is more like coffee than any beer I've ever had. Sweet and bitter at the same time. Lots of big chocolate and coffee flavors. The mouthfeel is full and very smooth, from the oatmeal, I guess. For a minute, I contempleted whether this beer is too much. If I wanted coffee, I'd drink coffee, right? Eventually I decided no, this is not too much. It's simply a great beer. I applaud Founders for making so many interesting, extreme beers.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,kmpitz2,4.7,"This pours a deep black color with a small tan head that sits nicely atop the brew. The nose is really really nice. Almost like fresh ground coffee with a nice slightly creamy chocolate in the background. I really like the nose. The flavor is very nice as well. Good coffee tones that move into chocolate on the finish. I really do like it. The feel is a bit less than I had hoped. I expected thicker than thick, but it is just on the light side of thick with a carbonation that is a little too much. I could easily sit and drink this beer all damn day. One of my favorite brews.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,whartontallboy,4.72,"I made an hour or so detour on a road trip to be able to pick this one and their Imperial stout up. I think it was worth it, if that says anything.  Pours out a dark black into my snifter with a very thin brown head that disappeared quickly. A bit more of a head would have been nice, but that's my only real quarrel with this beer.  Smell is a wall of roasted espress in your nose. Seriously, it smells like putting your nose over a pot of coffee. There's some burnt and roasted malts in there as well, but the coffee dominates.  Hits the tongue with a thick and full mouthfeel that is full of, among other things, espresso, dark baking chocolate, and roasted malt. It's certainly a huge flavor, and it comes in waves, with the espresso dominating on the front end, but the chocolate really pulling through in the finish and lingering for quite some time.  Wow, this is ridiculously drinkable for a stout of its ABV. I only have four, and I immediately wanted to drink a second one. Quite good, and worth seeking out. I don't know if it displaces Storm King for me, but it definitely belongs in the same sentence.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,malty,4.5,"Poured from a stubby 12 oz. bottle - no freshness date (But I do know it was there Apr. '05 batch).  Black as night (no highlights at all) with a gorgeous fluffy, multi-sized bubble khaki head that stood tall and shrank to a consistent 1/2 inch. Great lacing.  Scent is heavenly: Whole roasted coffee beans mixed with malted milk balls and dark bitter powdered chocolate. There's even a hint of raspberry preserves, and yes, golden brown toast.  Beautiful balance of high grade fresh coffee, hearty dark roasted malts and a fair amount of fruit zest (from the hops of course). Not at all burnt tasting (as many BA reviews noted), just very roasty and (again) beautifully balanced. 8.3% ABV is well hidden.  Mouthfeel is spectacular. Creamy, fluffy and a bit oily. Carbonation is perfect, giving this heavy bodied beer more texture and 'life'.  Drinkability is very high. Not at all cloying.  Overall a splendid stout from a local brewery that's been producing some fine offerings over the past couple years. I'm a coffee fan, but more of a 'foo-foo' coffee guy - never drink it black. This stout will please the die-hard java heads and the over-priced latte lovers (like myself). I was surprised at how creamy and silky smooth this stout was, almost like a cream stout with just the right amount of bite.

1199,11757,beerinator,4.35,"Appearance: Black gold, texas tea... Minus the gold part. This beer pours thick and black. It leaves a nice dark tan head with divine lacing on the side of the glass.  Aroma: Roasted Burnt Coffee. You can almost smell the texture of the ground beans. There is a bit of sweetness in the beginning, but almost everything in the smell comes from the coffee.  Taste: The beer rolls across the tongue, picking up bitterness as it heads back. The finish isn't too dry, but it is definately roasty and bitter. Burnt roast lingers in the mouth as you contemplate the next sip. The mouthfeel is solid, if a little oily.  Notes: Don't drink this if you hate coffee. I'm not a coffee fan, but this because of the roasty bitterness this one wins for me. The aroma and flavor both make me think of coffee grounds. And I can almost visualize them in the beer, because the images conjured from the smell is so powerful. Good big stout.

Thick pour, almost viscous. No head to speak of (I don't pour from any great heights). The nose is fabulous- smoke, bitter chocolate, dark-roasted coffee, buckwheat honey and even hints of soy sauce. The palate mirrors the nose. It's huge, but balanced. No flavors overwhelm the others, and there's a bit of a nice bitter coffee note in there that lends structure. It's no session beer, that's for sure.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,ppoitras,4.97,"12oz bottle obtained via trade with CRJMellor. Thanks for the opportunity...  Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" dark brown head over the opaque dark dark brown/black brew. Lacing is minimal to average, but acceptable for the style, and the head fades to half height and holds steady. Aroma is filled with coffee and chocolate malts, and some dark fruit essence hides in there as well. Even smells hearty. Taste starts with sweet chocolate grains, hearty oats in the middle, and fades to a somewhat bitter, dry coffee close. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, apr for the course for a heavily oated brew, and drinkability is excellent as well. High alcohol? I see no evidence, probably will feel it later. Worth the hype.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,SupaCelt,4.05,"My breakfast was pert near black Thick like crude. A ruby hue characterizes the small one centimeter sized head. This head retreats to assemble a thin ring of the same ruby-cocoa colour before vanishing for good. Mild carbonation struggles to travel through the thickness. No lace. Just beer. I imagine Cheerios floating in it.  The smell is a whallop of coffee and alcohol. Repeated sniffings find the alcohol to have diffused out of the scent leaving just the coffee to flourish. This old stout smells fresh ground from Columbia. Burnt toast crust pops into my mind ( in keeping with the breakfast theme of course ) as another layer of aroma. Smells hearty and stout.  The taste had a heavy chocolate influence with coffee being the lesser pronounced flavor at the outset of the taste test. The chocolate flavor eased into the background to leave just a subtle sweetness behind the coffee as breakfast wore on. One lump, not two. A perfect end is found in a softly expressed creamy finish which rounds out the delights of this alcoholic coffee. If you like black coffee and thick beer, this is the trick. A more than suitable early morning eye opener to prime the pump for an all day excursion, or just to compliment a fine meal or wind down after a long day.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,ScottS,4.69,"Pours like motor oil with very little head that quickly disappears. The aroma is a whole lot of coffee with bits of chocolate. The initial taste is coffee and dark chocolate. After a minute or so the aftertaste turns into nice hoppy stout taste. The coffee and dark chocolate provide a nice bitterness to balance the malty sweetness. A very well balanced, interesting, complex beer. As I sip on this more, there is a slight lacing left on the glass. The carbonation is just right.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,cokes,4.52,"Ink black with a squat, stern yellowed brown head. Deeply chocolated nose, backed with pangs of acrid roast beans, vanilla, pine, and liquor denched berries. Inhale deeper and there are cinnamon-sprinked cedar boards, bourbon, and liquorice. Enters with a molten sludge of chocolates. Milk, bittersweet, and fudge. From this very pool, a java notion arises, bringing a persuasive roastedness and, in tow, some caramel nougat suggestions that fan outward into vanilla extract and molasses. Booze seeps in, full of bourbon and vodka, as it conjoins a raspberry and cherry fruitness. This is verily liquidized raspberry truffles. A oat-induced sense of flake is noticed, but is pushed aside by the richness of everything else. Pinecone bitterness dots the close, with a mouth still coated in malt and adjunct sludge, as well as a flickering flame of vodka and cranberry. Lavish and broad in the mouth, and nearly suffocating at times in its richness. It maintains a general fat feeling, but also a gluttonous (though slow) drinkability. Each of the additives is explicit, clearly defined, and right at the fore. Despite this, and because of it, it retains a sense of cohesion and purpose, even if it borders on grandiose. This might be too strong and rich for breakfast, but seems rather appropriate at the opposite end of the day.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,OStrungT,4.3,"This beer pours an inky black. The head is very dark tan. The head never really fades. It just kind of sits there. It leaves laces that also dont want to go away. They coat the glass very thickly. It smells very strongly of chocolate. Also, there is a strong aroma of coffee. This stout is good. It tastes like coffee with chocolate mixed in. I also taste rosted malts. This beer is very rich. It is also quite thick. The flavor is very aggressive. It leaves my mouth tasting like I just sucked on a coffee bean. This beer is carbonated just right. This beer is very god, but I dont think I could drink it all night long. It is so very rich and filling that I would probably feel bloated after a few. Also, it is just a little high in alcohol, so some people might not be able to consume too many for that reason. If I ever see this beer in California, I will definately buy it.

I has been forever since I got this one in trade and I have been trying to decide if I should wait for an occasion or share it, or bring it for a tasting... screw it! Man do I feel bad now! Deep, dark and chocolate brown that you cannot see anything through at all... thick, dark mocha head with some nice large bubbles in the mass that look like they were dipped in chocolate syrup! Freaking beautiful sight... The head finally reduced down to large bubbles on the one side, a thick creamy ring, and a nice dusting across it all. OMFG. Finally got the glass towards me. Intense chocolate and espresso... dark caramels... Looking at it you almost expect it to be thick and heavy, but the body is more towards medium, maybe a step up? Creamy and bitey, almost ""fluffy"" feeling if you can understand what I am thinking.... a nice doughy, chewy feeling, very cool. Hoppy bites and dark espresso blackness. Godiva dark chocolate liquor in a glass of strong, cold, black coffee. Chocolate covered expresso beans. Nice dark roasted malt flavors, bit of merlot coming through.

1199,11757,LuckySevens82,4.9,"12 oz bottle courtesy of clvand0...thanks Chris! Pours a foreboding black. Initial head is near ruby in color, but when it finally settles, a light brown head emerges. The head is dense and easily 2 fingers, lacing is impressive, as is overall retention. Smell is amazing, even if a bit mild. Chocolate, rolled oats, coffee are in the forefront. Roasty malts are backed by just a hit (a whiff, a smidgen) of hop aromas. The smell just screams: ""c'mon wuss...Sure it's 7am in the morning, but you don't need to go to work today, all you need to do is drink me."" Although I'm paraphrasing. Well okay then, I suppose I will succumb to temptation and have a sip. Holy crap! Rich, dark, chocolate. Smooth, rolled oats. Bitter espresso coffee. A bit of hop bitterness is buried in the background. The dominant character is the espresso though, although the chocolate is a close second. The word decadent comes to mind. The flavors mingle and create such a nice experience, it's almost like the best coffee you've EVER had. Screw Juan Valdez, I say drink this. This beer is an experience, and a great one. I can't really find a single problem here. Drinkabilty suffers slightly because it's not an every day sort of thing, at least I couldn't drink this every day. Even if you break this down to its components, it's still great. As an oatmeal stout, it's good. As a double chocolate stout it's excellent. And as a coffee stout, it's amazing.

Some lawsuit happy dumbass might be tempted to sue Founders because it could appear to be a children's drink (if a person was really stupid). Cute label. I like it.  Pours a dark dark ebony with a dark brown short-lived head. Minor lacing on the glass looks like some sort of alien language.  Smells of slightly oxidized espresso/strong coffee and dark chocolate. Hints of an acidic coffee smell in there as well.  Tastes is the same as the nose. A strong coffee (slightly oxidized) and dark chocolate flavor lead with a nice coffee bean bitterness on the end.  Mouthfeel is slightly too prickly for my tastes. Would like to see this creamier like Expedition. Maybe ageing will help?

Pours from the stubby brown bottle a deep, slightly thick syrupy black with a dark tan head that slows rises from the black hole upwards. Looks like a glass of black coffee after someone has gone out of their way to make it extra strong. First sniff is like opening a can of fresh ground coffee and inhaling deeply...damn do I love that...combined with chunks of rich dark chocolate. Roasted oats and burnt molasses round it out. Yum...screw my morning cup of coffee...give me this instead!  First sip is an explosion of rich coffee flavor along with a massive dose of chocolatey goodness. Roasted and burnt oatmeal gives a slightly nutty flavor as well. Hints of molasses and toffee come in and out. Everything works so well together here and each sip leaves me salivating for more. WOW.  Big, syrupy rich full mouthfeel that coats the mouth and is perfect for a big, tasty stout in my mind. Just enough carbonation. This is an incredibly tasty stout and ranks up there as my favorite so far. How I wish I had a case in my cellar. Highly recommended and well deserving of the hype.

The aroma is of expresso like coffee bean and oatmeal. The taste carries the oatmeal in the taste as well as the coffee, bakers chocolate and alcohol.

The box from BeerAdvocate CRJMellor that included this Founders Breakfast Stout surely will rank among the divine gifts category. The beer came in a 12 oz. brown bottle with an artful label. Pouring this beer turned my pint glass into a black hole through which no light could escape. Even holding the glass an inch from a 100 watt bulb revealed nothing about the interior. The head was dark brown and thick, and left gobs of clumpy brown lace all round the walls of the glass. The aroma was laden with coffee, chocolate, and raisins. The dry and roasty taste was that of burnt oats, coffee, and chocolate. The mouthfeel was thick and chewy, and aftertaste a bit warm. Like eating a coffee cake (without too much sugar), this meal in a glass satisfied nearly all senses, and left me in a state of fulfillment, and in grateful appreciation of the art of brewing.

Great stout - coffee perfectly balanced by a residual sweetness that smooths out the rough edges and oiliness common to coffee stouts.

It's as black as eternity. Damn black. A nice looking creamy brown head sits on top and recedes to a good sized collar in a minute. The lacing is sparse. The nose is nice. Coffee is the biggest component. Then roasted and burnt malts. Then wood and vanilla. The carbonation is light and the beer feels somewhat creamy in the mouth. Body is medium to medium-full. The coffee tones come through in a big way on the palate as well. There's a nice bitterness attributed to coffee and roasted malts. It lingers nicely.

1199,11757,Gueuzedude,4.08,"Pours an opaque almost completely black color with only a wispy brown head. When roused it forms a frothy deep brown head. The aroma is like smelly a cold sharply acidic burnt cup of espresso, and burnt barley malt husks. The aroma is quite husky, with grassy notes as well as notes of roasted barley. There is actually some nice notes of chocolate and aromatic coffee under all of this burnt huskiness, though I wish that it showed through a bit more.  Wow, the taste is thick on viscous, I should have guessed at the viscosity of this brew seeing as it has oatmeal in it. It is certainly breakfast in a bottle, it is thick and chewy almost approaching syrupy, though it does not compare to the Dark Lords thickness. The taste is full of roasted burnt notes, at first the burnt grain husks, that are in the nose, are evident in the taste as well. Thankfully this soon dies down, and the burnt acrid bitterness of this beer smoothes out a bit. Certainly there are notes of concentrated express roast, roasted barley, and burnt toast, but also underneath are notes of creamy, dark, semi-sweet chocolate, and hints of licorish. As noted, this beer hides the alcohol quite well.  As this beer warms up it becomes much more smooth (though that might just be my palate becoming acclimated to the roasted notes), more creamy almost like a melted dark chocolate milkshake. Interestingly enough the nose retains the sharply acidic roasted grain husk dominance. This is certainly tasty, but I am a little turned off by acrid notes.

Aromas are a mix of coffees and chocolate with hints of creamy oats and a bit of roast. The flavors to this brew were simply amazing. Initially there was a heavy dosage of expressos and chocolates. This was followed by a nice dosage of oast and creaminess. The finish was roasty and chocolately without a hint of astringecy and a mild bitterness that just rounded things out. The mouthfeel on this brew was out of this world and I could honestly see myself drinking this brew every morning if I had the chance to.

Taste is very strong and bold. Initially coffee, followed by some chocolate, then finishes with malty, stouty elements. Coffee tastes like good, rich breakfast-diner brand (the kind with the white ceramic cups served by a waitress named Flo or Sue Ellen), nothing fancy, just strong and uncut. Chocolate portion rides low, not adding much sweetness, keeps it dry and bitter overall. No trace of alcohol but the bitterness holds me back.

Presentation: States that it's a double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout...sign me up!  Appearance: Pours syrup-thick and midnight black. Virtually no head to speak of but the little that was there was tan.  Smell: roasted nuts, some burnt coffee flavor, and definite smoky presence. Cocao notes as it warms. Almost smells like an imperial stout.  Taste: Baker's chocolate, espresso, mild nutty presence throughout. Smokiness is definitely present throughout the beer. A bitter chocolate aftertaste that fades into some sweetness and carmel presence. Very complex.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy. I think this is where the oatmeal comes out to play. Warming alcohol numbs the lips just a touch.  Drinkability: One to enjoy and savor. Especially since it's so dang hard to come by!  Notes: This reminds me of the '03-'04 Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout (my top rated RIS to date). This is definitely one that I would have in my regular rotation if it were readily available.

1199,11757,nomad,4.5,"After being thoroughly non-plussed with the Devil Dancer, this special brew from Founders was quite a turnaround. Pours out a dark chocolate-black with a voluminous head, as dark as foam gets, reeling in carbonation and staying put through out the session. Surprisingly the lacing was not too good, but I'll just blame that on the oiliness oatmeal can give to a beer.  Smell was chocolate, medium-dark roast coffee, a hint of cream, and a nuttiness somewhere between mascarpone and crushed almonds. Full and alluring and one of the few times I feel like my attempt at description fits the experience - very much chocolate and coffee and all those scents.  Surprisingly smooth! Most coffee stouts and porters show their coffee a little too much, but the flavor comes across here like chocolate-covered espresso beans. Sweet but roasty in a slightly refined way. Nips of toffee show here and there with a requisite roast barley snap, though altogether smooth and pleasing. Mouthfeel is moderate and slightly slick, but not too much so. Very smooth finish, again surprising, as the overall flavor impression is a rising tide that crashes rather quietly (for a stout).  Very solid and bursting with flavor yet balance between all of the big things going on - high gravity, plenty of roast malts, chocolate, coffee, just about everything but the kitchen sink, yet it all integrates well. The most surprising point was the drinkability - its a strong-flavored stout yet it resides, not wrecks, on the palette.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100

1199,11757,Skidz,4.97,"It's 1:00 PM, I just woke up. This is my breakfast.  Pours out a thick, motor-oil black. 1983 Chevy S10, the oil has never been changed, 100,000 miles and running. Sits deep, dark, brown, black, empty. All the colors of the anti-rainbow. Big brown head caps it off, surprised it's not black too. Leaves rings up and down the glass and holds a good thick skim on the surface.  Once the aroma gets into your nose, your eyes widen with the sudden jolt of caffeine laced, rich coffee aroma. Deep, dark and roasty. Creaminess never smelt so good. Big chunky notes of bakers chocolate fill you head with melty sweetness. There is no end.  Tastes equally powerful. Coffee is jammed into every single corner of your mouth, providing a broad spectrum of bitterness. Roasty, nearly burnt flavors leave your tongue feeling black, thirsty for more. Sweetness is the savior of the beer, like having a big spoonfull of cream dropped into your morning cup. Rich and chocolately...my teeth ache. Finishes with a strong, awakening bitterness that tugs at every cell in your mouth, crisp roastedness then replaces every feeling your mouth.  Dripping, gooey, molten chocoate-like, absolutely thick and viscous. You could paint your house with this beer. Carbonation is light and well suited for the overall experience. I like it.  I don't usually like drinking when I wake up, but this beer has changed my opinion on the subject. I also don't like the watery feel of coffee, but love the flavors and aroma, suitable replacement? This is now the #1 reason why I love Founders. I'm going back to bed, wake me when it's time for another.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,meathookjones,4.47,"Sampled on 1/09/05 from a 12oz bottle. Pitch black body with a healthy dark brown head sitting on top. Decent scattering of lace was left around the glass as I drank this. Strong roasted coffee in the aroma that really dominates. Along with that is dark chocolate and a slight nuttiness. Maybe a touch of caramel as well but damn that coffee is kicking. Flavor is full of coffee, bittersweet chocolate and a light sweet caramel. Very strong flavors that mixes together quite well. A bit of oatmeal and roastiness are adding to the complexity. A nice lingering roasty coffee is what you get on the finish, mmm. Mouthfeel is thick, smooth going down and creamy. I could have a few of these, if I had a few of these. Great brew that keep me really impressed with Founders and disappointed that its not available anywhere near where I live. Thanks to tikkigodxxx for this great brew.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,francisweizen,4.7,"what an awesome brew from this new-to-me bre-we-ry:-) Dark opaque black with a nice tan head of foam as well. This one leaves nice lacing as well, impressive. Aromas of chocolate, nuts, coffee, caramel, alcohol, dark fruits, and more. The taste is oaty, nutty, and chocolaty with some other lovely hints of coffee, booze, and more. The mouthfeel is thick, slick, and truly awesome. Drinkability is damn good for a stout of this nature and power as well. What a damn good, flaky oatmeal stout. Lovely, on all accounts. Vicar, can I have some more? VICAR!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,putnam,4.01,"Opaque crude oil-colored liquid and creamed coffee brown-colored foam. Intense aromas of various roasted, fermented and re-roasted substances: cocoa, coffee and coffee-liqueur pudding. On the palate it is very sweet, sugary even, and creamy-textured. The flavors are intense, like essential oils, and suggest brown sugar-sweetened espresso, m&m candy and charred malt. Vegetal notes accompany the roasted ones, reminiscent of steamed nettles and baked bell peppers. As expected, quite ambitious and, in a sense, perfectly executed. A little too sweet and alcoholic to re-drink very soon. Perhaps this will improve with some age...",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,marburg,4.3,"I originally had this back in July 2003 at the Michigan Beer Fest. I don't know if they've dulled the sheer impact of this or if my palate is simply more adjusted to big, burnt flavors; but either way, I feel this is much better -- more well-rounded and balanced, perhaps -- than that initial tasting.  Black, robust looking brew with a fleeting tan/putty-colored foam. Coffee and crispy, burnt toast provide a logical counterpart to layers of dark and semi-sweet chocolates. Carries through to an inititally thick, chocolatey, almost sweet flavor. That's pushed aside rather rapidly by some burnt malts and some double-pump-chocolate Starbucks concoction. Some hop bitterness emerges as well, pushing its way through the more natural roasted flavors.  Surprisingly smooth, silky even, in the finish for all of its rough edges. They probably could have reduced the hop load just a bit. The roasted bitterness and burnt chocolate flavors tame the sweetness well enough on their own. Then again, maybe not.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,merlin48,4.82,"I'm surprised they get away with the label(as pictured), with a toddler eating his cereal. Bib is optional. Label says this is a double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout. Never doubt Founders at their word. This pours about the thickest, richest looking, opaque stouts I've ever witnessed. Dark and opaque would be appropriate. Small, light brown head is shortlived, but is easily revived with a swirl of the glass. Garnet red hues are noted on the fringe and collar. Nice lacing effect exhibits sheets and patches. Aroma is exceptional. Fresh roasted Kona coffee beans, from a specialty coffee shop, are first noted. More fun soon follows, with anise, burnt toast, and softer notes of cocoa and oatmeal. Grassy and earthy hops lurk in the background. Mouthfeel has a velvet feel from rolled oats. Robust and full bodied, with a sharp and bitter feel from the enormous dark roasted malts. Taste is an incredible blend of dark roasted malts. Lots of different coffee flavors, cocoa, carob, tobacco, and old baseball glove. Grassy and earthy hops are a bit restrained, but add a nice touch. The finish is of day old coffee bitterness. Very complex and full bodied. Very filling, and much like the liquid food that I think the brewer had in mind. I'm beginning to prefer Founders, over Dogfish Head, when it comes to pushing the boundaries of certain styles. Thanks to mentor for sharing breakfast.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,feloniousmonk,4.5,"I'm having this bottle with leftovers from dinner, but it is 4:30 am, so that's close enough to call it breakfast, right?(Funny how what began as a common joke, ""Oatmeal stout? You should have it for breakfast!"" is now coming into it's own as an individual style.) Enough with the whimsy, time for the beer!  This one is just what I need now, as the sub-zero wind-chill and the weather in general puts that witches teat to shame, and summarily lays waste to the well-digger's bum. I need something warm, rich and fortifying...is this it?  Pours out a thick, impenetrable blackness, solid ebon, with slight ruby highlights at the foot of the glass. Head is mighty, massive, twisting slowly down to a most 1/2 "",burnt-toast brown, like chocolate shavings mingled with coffee grounds.  Aroma is right on for the style and then some! Espresso is featured first, then chocolate, roasty all the way, gritty and earthy, rich and thick...a coffee stout that nears an Imperial. Almost like what happened the last time I mixed Bell's Java Stout with Expedition ...almost.  Velvety feel on the tongue, almost magical the way this warmed-up stout lightly lays over the senses, drifting it's wonder throughout the mouth. Hops up front, rich coffee texture, tangible in the mouthfeel, a little hot and spicy, backed up by prodigious malt. Full-bodied, with a long, cocoa-coffee finish, plays delicately on the tongue, but lingers long.  This is a very satisfying stout, one that meets almost all of my expectations. I have had coffee stouts with bigger coffee flavor, though, and oatmeals that are smoother and more richly rewarding, as well as chocolate stouts that bring that flavor in full force...this is a very accomplished blend of the three sub-styles of stout, it succeeded in it's mission quite well, which is to make me consider having this in my coffee cup every morning, inside of the usual dark roast Columbian!  Damned good! Another impressive offering from Founders, and another very attractive label, even if it does suggest that a child has been consuming the product...watch for for the Grand Rapids Board of Health and Human Services, guys!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Rastacouere,4.15,"Black pour without much head, but what is there is intimidatingly dark brown. Strong roasty aroma. Overwhelming dry coffee flavors (seek this one out if thats your thing), grainy/oatmeal-ish, cocoa abundance. Rich dark malts components. More of the same on the tongue. Well developped sweet/bitter balance. Roastiness is deep and expressive over a small hints at green oily hops. Smooth going. Very dryish mouthfeel, powdery like the cocoa it includes which make it feel almost chalky. Firm and enjoyable medium to full body. Remarkably good. Among the good stouts available Id say, Id even rack this among the imperials, as a smaller and less desserty Péché Mortel.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,walleye,4.08,"from the bottle. poured a dark brown with garnet around th edges, with a medium sized brown head. aroma roasted malts, coffee, plums, chocolate and a nice sweetness. flavor. coffee, more like coffee beans,dark fruits, brown sugar, raisins, roasted malts, and a smokey, molasses on the back of the tongue. this is a very good beer, I am glad I got my hands on this one. It looks like I was lucky to get to get this 4 pack. went back and got another 4 pack to hold on to for some future use",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,proc,4.58,"This is an excellent beer.  I don't hand the ""5's"" out in any category very easily, but this one deserves it in the ""taste"" category.  Pours out to a dark-as-night black in the glass with a decent-sized, light brown head, that reminded me of foaming brown sugar. The aroma is that of roasted malt goodness and licorice. The taste is superb, and in my opinion, perfect. There is a wonderful chocolate presence that is accompanied by anise and pumpernickel bread. This beer finishes very nice with no hint of its 8% ABV.  Excellent. Outstanding even.  A meal in a glass.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,deejaydan,4.43,"This is an impressive beer. Pours very thickly into my pint glass. A creamy head that actually hangs out for a while, given the ABV of this brew. Taste is an exposion of coffee up front, followed by a following of chocolate, then some english hops in the aftertaste. Smells sweet and slightly nutty-roasty. This is a thick beer in the mouth and it is quickly becoming one of my favorites.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,beergeek279,4.6,"Served in the 12 oz. stubby into a pint glass. The color is jet black with a nice brown head. The smell is a strong rich dark chocolate with a bit of oatmeal in there. The taste is a wonderful mix of a nice coffee bitterness, a good rich dark chocolate flavor, and a bit of the oatmeal sweetness, along with a slight touch of warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, with a good creamy body. As for drinkability, this is an amazing beer, so rich and flavorful that I could only have a few!!  Thanks to deejaydan....err, Santa...for this amazing beer!!! I remember the recent thread about how Founders had just passed Kalamazoo, and after this one as well as the Devil Dancer I absolutely see why. This is so beautiful, literally breakfast in a bottle with so many of the flavors that makes breakfast so wonderful. Just as you can't live without breakfast, neither should you live without Breakfast Stout, and this is one of the ones I'll seriously try to use to get Founders distributed in PA (though for now can fortunately go to Ohio), and this is one I'll certainly have again!!!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,frazbri,4.78,"Pitch black body, very appealling mocha head with excptional retention and lacing. Aroma of freshly brewed black coffee with very little hop aroma. Flavors of coffee and chocolate with a hint of fruitiness and smoke (just a hint). Low to moderate carbonation very thick rich body.  I've been looking forward to this stout for a long time, and I am not at all disappointed. The name Breakfast Stout is earned by its substantial body, but I think I'll drink this to end my nights, rather than start my days.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Mitchster,4.23,"Brewed with flaked oats, bitter and sweetened imported chocolates, Sumatra and Kona coffee.  8.3% ABV. 25 IBU.  Pours out to a tenaciously thick pitch black, forming a large very dark brown frothed milk head with superior retention and solid sticky sheets of lacing. Wonderful looking brew. The aroma is absolutely intense...rich with tons of coffee (like a cold Frappucino), real chocolate, deeply roasted malts, black walnut, burnt marshmallows, chalk, limestone...very intense. The mouthfeel is silken smooth with a very dense body and rich finish. Carbonation is mild to moderate. The taste is really an impressive echo of the aroma, however it begins with some abundant herbal hops which display themselves more towards the middle with a green, oily flourish. There is a distinct touch of alcohol and metal in the middle as well, and a strong chalkiness in the finish.  The metal and alcohol twang kinda hurts it's otherwise excellent profile...this is a huge beer and I celebrate Founder's willingness to push the envelope and craft such amazing brews. These guys just blow me away with their excellence, and this is no exception. One hell of a beer...this is an entire meal in a bottle. Try it!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Bierguy5,4.63,"12 oz. bottle, no date. Pours a black liquid, that seems fairly thick. Thick creamy dark tan head that remained for a good time. Good lace on the glass. Smells of dark roast coffe, maybe even espresso. Maybe some chocolate in the nose as well. Roasty sweet flavors, followed by coffee. Sweet milk chocolate, carmel. Silky and creamy, with low carbonation. This is one spectacular brew. I am a fan of coffee, and coffee flavors in beer, and this has it and more.

1199,11757,SheepNutz,4.38,"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep jet black color with three fingers of dark tan head. Great lacing. The smell is all coffee baby. Rich roasted malt and lots of coffee, I'm buzzin' already! The taste is about the same, all about the coffee. Some caramel and molasses sweetness up front, but lots of fresh ground espresso bean flavor takes over. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy and it's pretty smooth. The drinkability is good for an 8% brew too. An awesome brew!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,CRJMellor,4.67,"Pours dark black with a deep tan head. Head quickly disappears after the pour but leaves streaks of lace on the glass. Aroma of chocolate, oatmeal, coffee and roasted nuts. Flavors of milk chocolate, very dry roasted coffee, a hint of honey and oatmeal. Incredibly rich and deep flavors. Mouthfeel is very lush and full-bodied. Definitive roasted coffee in the middle and finishes with a burst of bitterness. Drinkability is high and at 8.5 ABV tough to call a session brew but it tastes so could and goes down so easily it could be. Richness makes it a very filling but great beer.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,clvand0,4.77,"What a cool name and idea. A breakfast beer. Described as a double chocolate, coffee, oatmeal stout. I'm intrigued. Pours a very dark color with a small tan head that quickly disappears and lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma was big and filled with expresso and chocolate - dark malts. The flavor was not at all what I was expecting. The first thing that hits you is a very strong dark coffee flavor, as this is the predominant thing. Next there is a bitter coffee and dark roasted malts. Incredibly smooth and creamy mouthfeel. If I liked coffee a little more, I would drink this one all night long ... or at least until I passed out, because it's got some alcohol in it. Great beer!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Wildman,4.35,"This beer is now available in a four pak for people outside of Southern Michigan to enjoy. This beer poured pitch black with no light getting through this one. If formed a nice dark tan bubbly head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A heavy aroma of coffee, chocolate (or mocha coffee if you will), malts and some smokiness. The flavor was of malt, and very heavy on coffee, particularly a burnt aspect of it. Not as much chocolate comes through in the flavor. A slightly creamy body with a bit of a burnt finish. A heavy beer that leans towards an imperial style and gives Java Stout a run for it's money.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,Loki,4.85,"Sampled from a 64oz growler.  Appearance: Completely opaque, solid mass of blackness that builds a healthly cocoa colored head. The head is a bit unique in that from the side it looks like layered bubbles, yet from the top it is smooth for just a few depressions and looks like a brown sponge.  Smell: Rich coffee, creamy smooth chocolate, rich malts, and hints of smoke. Smells like a fancy coffee house iced latte with something extra. I could wake up to this every morning.  Taste: Coffee, bitter chocolate, and roasted malt. At first I thought it tasted like a cold cafe mocha coffee, without the cold coffee taste; but it almost exactly like chocolate covered expresso beans. Simply fanstastic. It makes me long for a cup of good, fresh java.  Mouthfeel: creamy and cold beginning with a slightly bitter finish. Maintains a refreshing wetness and finishes increadibly smooth. I was amazed that my mouth felt this wet with some of the coffee and chocolate bitterness.  Drinkability: Fantastic, impressive, somewhat unique. I could have this at anytime of the day and may try it tomorrow with breakfast!  Thanks granger10 for the wonderful beer!",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
1199,11757,granger10,5,"Holy crap this was one incredible coffee stout brewed by Founder's! This beer poured a super dark black color with a really dark tan head that was frothy in texture. Lots of lacing. Smell has an intense roasted coffee note to it, like opening a package of Starbucks whole bean coffee. The flavor on this baby was really, really intense. I you like coffee, you'll love this! Even though roasted coffee was the main flavor there was good balance here. I noticed some malts and some cream flavor and maybe some bittersweet chocolate in the finish. This wasn't a beer one could drink a whole lot of, even though I did have quite a few, because of the intensity and alcohol content (I don't know what it is but it must be somewhat high). This is the most flavorful coffee stout I have had as of yet, and I don't think it could get much better than this. Better than Bell's Java Stout IMO. original rating: 4.85 (all 5's except drinkability was a 4)  Review edited: After having this about a gazillion times at the brewery and going through 5 four packs of this since it's been released in bottles I have realized that this is my beer and only straight 5's will justify my love for this beer. I love the roasty flavors mixed with the rich coffee experience then milky chocolate, bitter chocolate, creaminess and smoothness in a thick body. I thought that maybe I would get sick of it but it appears I need it more and more the more I drink it. Just an amazing beer and one that I can get nearly all the time at the brewery. Thanks Founders.",Founders Brewing Company,"Michigan, United States",Oatmeal Stout,100
